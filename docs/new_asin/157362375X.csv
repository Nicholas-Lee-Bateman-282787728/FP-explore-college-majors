Just finished viewing this movie for the first time and it is excellent.  Rosanna Arquette is exceptional and equals such stars as Ingrid Bergman, Barbara Stanwyck, Rita Hayworth and many others as she shines in this movie playing the ""wild and seductive Alex Langley.""  The video back says: ""When an 18 year old Lincoln Muller, and his jock college friends encounter wild and seductive Alex, they think they're in for a night of explosive passion.  Instead, she steals their car...""

And what a way of doing it.  By convincing them that she will drive Lincoln home and return for a wild night of passion--all the time knowing she has no intention of returning but stealing the car and Lincoln with it as her hostage.  The two of them then set out and after several encounters arrive at Arquette's movie mother--who is extremely ill and dying.

""I see you still have that old tv,"" says Rosanna to her.  It's plain to see that the two of them have not been close and Rosanna may be hoping to use this time to get closer.  But to no avail.  The brief encounter is too moving as it explores their relationship--one most touching and certainly loving in spite of their distance.  Then, Rosanna and the maid take her mother to the hospital and while gone, another person shows up.  Not a good person either but one claiming to have been her former lover.  He comes with evil on his mind and a gun in his shirt.  He kidnaps Rosanna and the young Lincoln.

While making their get-away, the three of them stop at a small store and a shooting erupts.  Rosanna is shot in the stomach and is destined to die.  Young Lincoln, having already told her he loves her earlier, is stirred to emotional heights as he tenderly, gently returns her to her mothers home.  There he ever so lovingly carries her dead body and places her on the bed.  He washes the blood from her mouth, kisses her, removes the handcuffs, covers her and tells her she is safe now and no one will hurt her again.  He leaves the large TV set he bought on the way for her mother and then drives away--heading back to his own home.

A home where his mother is emotionally disturbed and waiting for him.

THe only thing I didn't like about the movie was that Rosanna was shot and killed.  I may be 56 years old but I could not stand seeing her die and now, as I write this review, I am wiping the tears from my eyes as I type because it was so sad to see an actress that I certainly love die in a film.  It was too realistic for my heart to bare.

This movie rates her #2 in all I've seen of her--only behind the Black Rainbow--which is my favorite of her films.  It was well worth the money and I shall watch it again.  I loved it.",1092873600,5,2696,4.327345309381237
