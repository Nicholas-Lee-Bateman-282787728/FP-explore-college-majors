8412719,3,B0041EPUO2,"WARNING: The majority of these scenes show NO PINK.  But then they go and let you see a couple of scenes that show insertion (albeit concealed with hand placement).  Are you guys insane??  Talk about some frustrating editing, some even more frustrating camera work, and just overall feeling completely baffled at this self-censorship in 2005 after such promising work you did in 2004!  Not to mention, in this DVD it's all over the place, some scenes are cleaned up until it looks like it was cut for cable, while others are almost fully explicit.  The two scenes that let us have some real passion are the only thing making me give this three stars - based on the strength of the other five or six scenes, this would be among the worst of Penthouse's conflicted creations.

Intro scene: yeah, no.

Scene 1: wow, a lot of enthusiastic crotch rubbing when your bottoms are on - as soon as they come off, NOTHING.  Then the scene wraps and bye bye.

Scene 2: complete BS.  Long shot of her fingering where the camera deliberately won't show anything below the top of her landing strip.  WTF.

Scene 3: shes constantly touching herself but the camera and editing constantly run interference so we see NADA.  theres 3 frames of finger in labia only barely visible in a crossfade panning shot, the rest is an editing fest of annoying crossfades, pans, framing the action out of shot, anything to stop us from getting a view of her crotch or finger tips. YFG.

Scene 4: I don't get it, three scenes of stupidly censored action, then you show a girl clearly fingering herself in a long shot of full insertion.  oh now I see, shes using her hands to block us from actually seeing pink, you can totally tell her finger is BURIED in her but theres no point-of-contact visibility - all the more open reclining shots are edited like the other scenes. still a pretty good scene and we can occasionally see, yes that finger is IN THERE and we can hear her moaning too (mixed with the background music).  Thank you, Luca.

Scene 5: now were back to the BS editing.  extremely short pointless scene too.

Scene 6: interesting leather outfit. dumb faux masturbation under her panties.  another brief scene.

Scene 7: again, don't understand why camera gets shy as soon as the panties come off, then BAM full insertion masturbating.  And we see it, finger IN THERE with some moaning and everything (kind of faux but still pretty explicit).  So thank you Samantha, very nice scene.",1421971200,,2462,4.635103926096997
