The other, ""Cain's Cutthroats"" ,deserves 5*.I agree with other reviewers ,that the reproduction quality is abominable. And that is not all,the movie itself has a pathetic storyline,the characters are poorly developed and not interesting. There are only 2 scenes to bother watching. The first is a scene where a grave is opened and the coffin is opened. It is muddy and in the dark.,more like a Frankenstein movie. The other, a dinner scene,which is as sensual as the other scene is ghoulish.'nuff said.
 The other movie,Caine's Cutthroats"" is a real good western The repro quality is fairly good;the storyline reminded me of Quantrille's period in the South after the Civil War. A real cliffhanger,lots of action,and a good Western by any standard,fully deserving of 5*.",1442534400,,913,4.96078431372549
8226958,2,B000X5XFV8,"I cannot recommend this dvd.  The movies are badly transferred, very had to watch on a big screen especially.  Can't comment on the stories or filming since it was so bad conditioni.",1384732800,,182,4.65625
8226959,5,B000X5XFV8,"These are very old westerns I had not seen since the 70s and just happen to remember Cain's Way and was so surprised I was able to find it and more surprised to find it on amazon.com. I got an extra bonus with the very low price. I love westerns and am proud to be able to add these to my collection.
If you like westerns and you have never watched the 6 hr Lonesome Dove........please get it......one of the best movies that has ever been made (just wish Clint would have been in it, would have been the best then!)  :)",1370736000,,520,4.098039215686274
8226960,3,B000X5XFV8,I'm an afficnado of schlock and this from the era where John Carradine would do anything for a buck so he could paly the ponies. He was a great guy. Cains Cut Throats is a fairly decent bad film and the L.A. times had to do and an interview with Carraidne because in a review of Cain's Cut Throats the writer erroneously reported that the film had a supporting role from the late John Carrine. The very much alive Carradine took offense to this because it might keep him from getting further offers. LOL. The double bill is worth every penny I paid for it and that's how much I paid for it.,1309564800,,590,4.230088495575221
8226961,3,B000X5XFV8,"These are two decent low budget westerns. Both of the films have good story lines with CAIN'S CUTTHROATS the much better of the two. It's a good tale of revenge. DEAD FOR A DOLLAR is a cheap version of THE GOOD, THE BAD & THE UGLY. The quality of the transfer to DVD is poor.  The color of both films is washed out. Both films look like third generation VHS tape copies. I would not pay over five dollars for these two. You might be able to find them in one of the other multi-movie sets. I can not imagine the transfer quality getting much worst.",1286064000,5,547,4.160377358490566
