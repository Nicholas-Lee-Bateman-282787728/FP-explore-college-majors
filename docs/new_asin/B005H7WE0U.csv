8472728,5,B005H7WE0U,"I am very sorry for the listener that wrote the previous review for this wonderful concert. For my taste it is one of the most beautiful and solemn Magnificats and the most important thing - it is ALIVE! The music lives, pulsates, moves! Not museum-ready ""specialists"" barockists performance without vibrato, without nuances and without soul that makes you vomit. Stravinsky is wonderful as well, but Bach is more than wonderfu, it is absolutely GENIAL, so do not listen to the ""authentic barocco"" lovers, this is a must-have concert!",1364860800,3,534,5.079545454545454

I had read many reviews that said that Koopman was using the wrong tempo, so I wanted to see the difference for myself. Well, I may be in a small minority, but Koopman's version thrills and inspires me while, just now as I watched it for the second time, I couldn't force myself to watch Bernstein's performance to the end. I'm not sure why I feel that way, but I had been thinking that Bernstein was in black and white while Koopman  was in color. That was wrong. On my second viewing, I saw that Bernstein's version was also in color; however; to me, the difference between the two is like the difference between black and white and color. For some reason, I find Bernstein's performance to be tedious and almost boring, and that's the first time I've ever felt that way about The Magnificat. Usually, I find it to be an overwhelming experience. I've seen Magnificat enough today, so I'm not going back to check on how Koopman handled it, but I think that the difference for me between the two performances is probably in the magnificent church setting and the camerawork in Koopman's version. Irrelevancies for judging music, many would say, but important to me in this case. After all, it is sacred music, and the proper setting can add to the overall effect. All I know is that I'm now going to buy the version that I've watched many times on YouTube, Koopman's. I'm also going to give it to a friend for Christmas.

One last thing: Do yourself a favor and check-out the different versions on YouTube (there are at least three or four complete versions there) before buying one.",1323475200,4,1891,5.093548387096774
