8008868,3,B00019U9V0,"The contact series were made to sell the Tae Bo punching bag that is used in the workouts. Some fans may not be impressed by the slowness of the workouts, as it mainly focuses on the upper body. I recommend wearing a pair of weighted gloves, and do the workout without a punching bag by using your own body weight. It can be a good workout for your arms, but it is not a great cardio workout.",1338422400,,392,4.103896103896104
8008869,2,B00019U9V0,"This DVD was not what I expected at all.  First, in order to be able to do most of the workout, you really do need Billy's special ""upright speed bag,"" aka a ""bobo doll"" for adults, as another reviewer described it.  I was under the impression that I could substitute a heavy bag, especially since Billy says in the beginning if you want to really hit hard, go get a heavy bag, but you really can't.  I realize that is my mistake, which is why I gave the product two stars instead of one.

Second, Billy moves so slowly throughout the workout that I literally did not break a sweat after 43 minutes (I did all of the punching on my heavy bag, and when there was an exercise I could not do without the special Billy bag, I did squats, lunges, jumping jacks, anything to keep moving).  I honestly don't know why the people on the DVD are dripping, unless the studio is excessively warm.

Finally, in typical Billy Blanks fashion, he makes things up as he goes along.  Ordinarily, I'm not too bothered by uneven sets or mistakes in counting; I can get past that.  But he literally announces mid-way through the tape that he ""just came up with an exercise"" while we were doing something else a moment before.  For some reason, that really irked me.

All in all, if you have never done Tae Bo before, there is a nice intro to punches and kicks in the warmup, and it is better than doing nothing.  However, do not expect to get much of a workout if you have been working out consistently for any length of time previous to this tape.",1207526400,12,1527,4.32280701754386
8008870,4,B00019U9V0,"I tried this out for the first time today.  The workout is based from a punching bag which looks like a sock'n bop for adults.  I don't have the bag but I was able to get a solid workout without it.  You could get imaginative if you have the Billy Bands or other tension bands.

  I enjoyed it.",1146009600,2,294,3.9827586206896552
8008871,5,B00019U9V0,I've always been a Tae Bo Fan from the very first video.  And now I'm a fan of this DVD and it has definitely been working.  Everyone has been telling me that I'm losing weight and looking so much better and it's all because of Tae Bo.  It's changelling but worth it.  I even ordered the punching bag and that's so much fun.  I would definitely recommend this product to many people.,1141862400,,383,4.263888888888889
8008872,4,B00019U9V0,"You are going to feel it too.

Nothing is worse than working out to a tape where the host hasn't even lost their breath to catch it, and you're scraping yourself off of the floor.

THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  By the end, everyone is pouring sweat and grunting, and you will be too.

This was my first Tae Bo DVD.  While I do have the advantage of limited martial arts experience and years of yoga, this was still a carido challenge.  It's simple and FUN!  This workout accomodates limited space, it's easy to understand, he's fun and not cheezy.",1118534400,31,540,4.34
