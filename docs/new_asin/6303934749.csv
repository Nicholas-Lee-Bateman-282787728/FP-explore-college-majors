740644,3,6303934749,"First things first: This edition is as bad as stated.  I have an ancient VHS version that is better--slightly.

In the Roaring Twenties, Chicago was the most raffish newspaper town in the world.  Reporters who had seen it all--and seen it many, many times--covered Prohibition-era beer wars, pin-striped gangsters several times larger than life, crooked politicians of every conceivable stripe, Red scares, labor strife, mesmerizing mouthpieces who reduced juries to tears in order to save thrill killers from their justly deserved dates with public executioners and any other mad thing that turned up by land, sea or air.  Pop culture of the day was fascinated by it all and two contemporary plays have survived into our time to remind us of those hard-charging times: ""Chicago"" and ""The Front Page.""  ""Chicago,"" of course, was a hit play, that became a hit movie as ""Roxie Hart,"" that became a hit Broadway musical, that became a hit retro-movie musical.

""The Front Page"" was an even bigger hit on stage in its first go-around.  It was written by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur who had served time in the news bullpen at the Chicago City Hall and had finally escaped to write for other venues that were not a bit more respectable but paid a whole lot better.  Their protagonists were Hildy Johnson, a reporter working his last day in the bullpen before escaping into the real world and his boss Walter Burns, the amalgamation of every cynical editor who'd ever run a beady eye over Hecht and MacArthur's deathless prose.

I should point out that Hildy Johnson in the play and in this movie is a man (for he would undergo a sex change in the great remake of this film and be played by Roz Russell.)  There actually was a Hildy (short for Hilding) Johnson who happened to be a bullpen reporter at the Chicago City Hall.  Hecht and MacArthur were acutely aware that Johnson would be in the theater on opening night to observe the antics of the fictional Hildy on stage.  They must have hoped that he could take a joke.  By all accounts, the real Hildy was a large and formidable Swede.

In very short order, the play was faithfully transferred to the movie screen with young Pat O'Brien as Hildy Johnson and dapper Adolph Menjou as Walter Burns.  Because of the fame of the remake, ""His Girl Friday,"" the original film is largely forgotten today, but it remains well worth watching.  It was the first major film of the talkie era in which the old fluid movement of the silent film camera was re-attained.  (Just look at the continuous take in which Menjou argues O'Brien all the way around the press table.  How in the world did the director pull that off with the technology available to him at the time?)  Menjou and O'Brien are both terrific, as one would expect.

To my knowledge, there have been four filmed versions of the old play and at least one made for television.  Walter Burns, the most memorable character in the piece, has been portrayed by Adolph Menjou, Cary Grant, Walter Matthau, Burt Reynolds and Robert Ryan.  Grant's performance is the best remembered but Menjou is formidable and much, much closer to the intent of the original authors.

This is a good and completely authentic version of a great old warhorse and gem of the American theater.",1171670400,4,3266,4.721340388007055

Based on the famous 1928 play by Charles MacArthur and Ben Hecht, this gem isn't exactly the jewel HIS GIRL FRIDAY is - but it's definitely worth a look. Better than you'd think! It's a virile, dizzy-plotted drama which is considered by many to be the epitome of newspaper reporter flicks. A brilliant early talkie which perfectly transfers a 2O's stage classic onto the screen - with zesty aplomb. Superficially, a shade or two primitive due to its age, it should be seen by every serious student/fan of classic pre-code cinema. The plot is just the same as the one used in HIS GIRL FRIDAY, except that Hildy Johnson is as originally written - a man - in the form of Pat O'Brien. In the aforementioned, casting Rosalind Russell and changing Hildy's sex was an inspired stroke of genius: Howard Hawks should be commended. Menjou is terrific as Walter Burns: he won a BA AA nomination. Originally Louis Wolheim was to play the role, but he up and died suddenly. Nominated for Best Picture & Best Director AA as well.

740849,3,6303934749,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Movie fans are well aware of the story of THE FRONT PAGE. The movie has been remade more than once as HIS GIRL FRIDAY with Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, THE FRONT PAGE with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau and SWITCHING CHANNELS with Burt Reynolds and Kathleen Turner. But it all started as a stage play and this is the first time it was brought to film.

The movie tells the story of ace reporter Hildy Johnson (Pat OBrien) who is about to give up his job as a reporter to marry the girl of his dreams Peggy Grant (Mary Brian), move to New York and take up a career in advertising. But Hildy is the best at what he does and with the execution of accused murderer Earl Williams Hildys boss Walter Burns (Adolph Menjou) will do anything he can to prevent his leaving. Anything!

The movie is presented much like a stage play with almost all of the action taking place in the press room near the execution area where Williams is to be hung. It may seem a bit claustrophobic and the smoke filled room will certainly not appeal to the PC crowd but that was the way things were then. Also like the play the film is filled with quick back and forth banter between the characters, so fast in some scenes that I was disappointed that a subtitle function wasn't offered with this release. It would have made some dialogue that I couldn't catch much easier to understand.

While the film only runs 101 minutes it feels much longer. I don't know if thats a good thing or a bad thing. Yes, it did entertain for the most part but at the same time it felt like it could have been tightened up in various spots. But there was more story here than in numerous films being made today so maybe it was just my own problem. Ive said before that being a part of the MTV generation has spoiled me for movies made in the past, wanting things to get to the point quicker than was done then. If you know that going in the movie becomes much more entertaining.

While the dialogue can overwhelm at times it also shows how incredible the acting is. Had this been on stage it would have been amazing to consider that someone could remember all of their lines. As fast as they are delivered to memorize them must have been a chore. Even on film with long takes being used it is amazing. The wit delivered in many of the lines shows that the writing supersedes much of what is coming out today on both television and in movies.

On the down side the acting also seems caught up in the stage presence of this film. Actors tend to bellow their lines and offer looks that seem destined for the upper balconies. One would think that by 1931 when this film was made actors would know they had to adapt from a huge to a small presence when being filmed. Thank goodness both OBrien and Menjou seemed to learn this fact in their later films.

So why would anyone want to see this movie? What makes it special? Perhaps that lies in the fact that it is the most complete version of this film to ever be offered to date. The film has been chosen as one of the films to be included in the Library of Congress collection. If you're not aware of how this works or of the Library of Congress collection then you cant really be a film fan. Seek it out, be aware of how it works and what it does. Youll appreciate film even more if you do so. One of the extras on this release talks about just that and is worth watching as well. A quick note on this topic: there are many movies that have disappeared from existence because of the deterioration of the film stock they were put on. The preservation of films done through this group has been amazing but needs to continue not just with old but newer films as well.

Kino Lorber has done a fantastic job with this movie. It brings it all together using various sources included original 35mm prints that have been saved. The quality of the end product is the best version of this movie you will ever find. It also offers a radio version of the play to be listened to as well.

If you love old movies, if you love comedies, then by all means make sure you add this to your collection. And get involved in the preservation of classic films. Kino Lorber has been a long supporter of classic films and thank goodness for that. Make a point of showing these films to young people, especially those who think that black and white films aren't worth watching. Theyre wrong. Theyre just as good today as they were when they played theatrically years ago. Not only that, they're part of our history and thats something that no one should turn their back on.",1440547200,,4606,4.315606936416185
740850,5,6303934749,"Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's fast and funny Broadway hit, THE FRONT PAGE, was first brought to the screen by maverick producer Howard Hughes in 1931. For many reasons, this early talkie version can be cited as the forerunner of the screwball comedy genre that took off in the 1930's and '40's. Howard Hawks remade it in 1940 as HIS GIRL FRIDAY and Billy Wilder gave it a shot in 1974 under the original title and with the play's  profanity intact.

 While Hawks' version, which changed the gender of reporter Hildy Johnson to a woman, is the most popular incarnation of the story, the '31version has the advantage of having been made during the pre-Code era which gives it a grittier edge, allowing it to be more faithful to the source. Although the vulgarities in the play had to be toned down for the film, the risqu content that was retained such as photos of topless women adorning the pressroom walls and a character flashing the finger, would never have been allowed after the Production Code was enforced in 1934.

The plot concerns the Chicago press' coverage of the upcoming execution of anarchist Earl Williams during a crucial election. Star reporter for ""The Morning Post"" Hildy Johnson is about to quit his job for marriage and a better career in New York. When Williams escapes and wins Hildy's sympathy, Hildy hides him in a roll-up desk. The ""Post"" 's manipulative editor, Walter Burns, uses the Williams break as a means to appeal to Hildy's love for a scoop and convinces him to stay and write a headline story that would expose the corrupt politics of the city's mayor and sheriff.

Stylistically directed by Lewis Milestone, THE FRONT PAGE is innovative in its use of a mobile camera within an enclosed set and in its rat-a-tat dialogue delivery.

The performances in this riotous movie are terrific. Dapper Adolphe Menjou is perfect as the control-freak Burns, as is newcomer Pat O'Brien in the role of Hildy. Pretty Mary Brian is sweet as Hildy's girl Peggy, and Mae Clarke is a standout as the prostitute Molly, the only friend of Williams who is played by diminutive character actor George E. Stone. The other hard-boiled reporters are played by familiar Golden Age faces, including Edward Everett Horton, Frank McHugh, Walter Catlett and Phil Tead.

Kino Lorber's Blu-ray of THE FRONT PAGE finally allows us to see the film in the best condition since its initial release, having been transferred off an archival 35mm print acquired by The Library of Congress in 1970 from East Germany. Age-related issues in the image and soundtrack are still evident, although they're very minor. Sharpness and contrast levels are excellent, and inherent grain is preserved to afford a very pleasing, film-like viewing experience. Extras include a fascinating audio commentary by filmmaker/historian Bret Wood, a documentary on the Library of Congress' preservation methods, and two radio adaptations - one from 1937 and another from 1946 starring the film's original stars Adolphe Menjou and Pat O'Brien.

As Bret Wood mentions in his commentary, THE FRONT PAGE is an underrated classic. I couldn't agree more; it is an early sound masterpiece and a must-see for film buffs. For my money, this one beats the remakes.

Highly recommended.",1439424000,3,3253,4.954128440366972
740851,4,6303934749,"The Front Page is the first of three film versions of the Ben Hecht/Charles MacArthur play that became a standard setter for many screwball comedies to follow.  Hildy Johnson (Pat OBrien) is an investigative reporter about to get married and looking for a more lucrative profession. When an accused murderer (George E. Stone) escapes from custody, Hildy sees a chance for the story of a lifetime. When he finds the criminal, however, he learns that the man may not be guilty. With the assistance of his editor (Adolph Menjou), Hildy attempts to stash the convict in a roll-top desk in the prison pressroom, uncover the conspiracy that incriminated him, and write the biggest scoop of the decade.

Directed by Lewis Milestone (All Quiet on the Western Front), The Front Page bristles with sharp, witty dialogue and a rapid pace that later comedies would adopt. The storys stage origin is evident in the movies limited sets, which would usually be a detriment to visual story telling. But the performances are so lively, and the basic story of political corruption so engrossing, the picture doesnt at all suffer. The movie was remade by Howard Hawks in 1939 as His Girl Friday and once again by Billy Wilder in 1974, starring Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Carol Burnett.

The Blu-ray release was mastered in HD from 35-mm elements preserved by the Library of Congress. Special features include a short documentary on film preservation efforts of the Library of Congress; audio commentary by film historian Bret Wood; a 1937 radio adaptation starring Walter Winchell, presented by Cecil B. DeMille; and a 1946 radio adaptation starring Adolph Menjou and Pat OBrien.",1439164800,,1665,5.02536231884058
740852,4,6303934749,"THE FRONT PAGE by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur is one of the great plays of the American theatre.  This classic satire of the newspaper game has served as the basis of four theatrical movies, as well as more than one television special.

Under the direction of Lewis Milestone, Howard Hughes produced the first movie version of the play in 1931.  Its not the most memorable filming of the work.  That honor, arguably, belongs to Howard Hawks HIS GIRL FRIDAY (1940), which starred Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell and switched genders on one of the key characters.

The 1931 version, however, does boast an top cast that includes Adolphe Menjou, Pat OBrien, Mary Brian, Edward Everett Horton and Mae Clarke, and it captures the hectic activity that occurs in the press room of a Chicago prison on the eve of an execution when the condemned man escapes.

With hard-boiled reporter Hildy Johnson (OBrien) and his brash editor, Walter Burns (Menjou) on the job, no stone will be left unturned, no lie will be untold and no law will be unbroken in order to get the exclusive on a hot, breaking news story.

Mastered in HD from 35mm elements from the Library of Congress, Kino Classics has now released THE FRONT PAGE is a sharp Blu-ray edition.  The sound track still has some issues, but my hunch is that, because pristine sound quality had not been perfected in the early years after THE JAZZ SINGER, these problems are inherent in the original film, rather than through any deterioration.

Extras on the Kino Lorber disc include 1937 and 1946 radio adaptations of the play, audio commentary by film historian Bret Wood and a short documentary of film preservation efforts by the Library of Congress.

Look closely and you may see uncredited Clark Gable as ""Reporter with hat at table in the prison."" (Note that his participation is unconfirmed.)

Produced by Howard Hughes and director Lewis Milestone, who has a brief cameo. Screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz also does a walk-on.

Here, a group of reporters has gathered to witness the rope execution of Earl Wlliams (Stone), a presumed Commie who shot a cop to death. This is backdrop to a personal story: ace reporter Hildy Johnson (O'Brien) who's quitting his job in favor of marriage (to Brian), and his manipulative boss, Walter Burns (Menjou), editor of the Morning Post.

The condemned Williams escapes, and all the reporters race out of the press room. Williams eventually climbs in a window while Hildy's alone.

He's also aware that Williams' conviction is a result of corrupt city politics. Hildy hides Williams in a rolltop desk while he calculates how to help him get away. As much as he doesn't want to, asking Walter Burns for assistance may be the only option.

Perhaps this film's most surprising moment occurs prior to Hildy and Williams meeting. One of the reporters phones in a desparaging report on the mayor and sheriff as the two men stand by and listen.

741048,3,6303934749,"""The Front Page"" was made in 1931 by Howard Hughes during his most productive years in Hollywood. In 1928 his second film, ""Two Arabian Knights""  won an Oscar for Best Director and his third film, ""The Racket"" was nominated for Best Picture. He went on to make ""Hell's Angels"" (1930) and ""Scarface"" (1932) both of which were major films.

The film is based on a 1929 play and the characters are based on real reporters and real events  known to writer Ben Hecht from his days in Chicago. The prodigious Hecht worked on more than 150 screenplays, was nominated 7 times, and won twice (""Underworld"" in 1927 and ""The Scoundrel"" in 1935). Other notable films he worked on include ""Scarface"" (1932), ""Stagecoach"" (1939), ""Gunga Din"" (1939) and ""Notorious"" (1946). Hecht was referred to as the ""Shakespeare of the movies.""

The film stars Adolphe Menjou and Pat O'Brien with Edward Everett Horton. It's an early example of the ""screwball comedy"" films that emerged strongly in the mid 30s and early 40s - ""It Happened One Night"" (1934), ""My Man Godfrey"" (1936), ""Bringing Up Baby"" (1938), ""You Can't Take it With You"" (1938), ""His Girl Friday"" (1940), ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1940), ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" (1944).

Director Lewis Milestone (1895-1980) worked with Hughes on the Oscar nominated ""The Racket"" (1928), on this film, and also on Hell's Angels"" (1930). He made more than 50 films, was nominated three times and won twice (""Two Arabian Knights"" in 1927, ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" in 1930). Among his many films are such diverse projects as  ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1962), ""Ocean's Eleven"" (1960), ""Pork Chop Hill"" (1959), ""The North Star"" (1943), and ""Of Mice and Men"" (1939). Milestone was not known for comedies, much less screwball comedies, and ""Front Page"" is his only entry in this genre. Generally speaking, screwball comedies were most effective when they came from directors who specialized in this form - e.g., Frank Capra, Preston Sturges, and Howard Hawks.

Suave Adolphe Menjou (1890-1963) was nominated as Best Actor for his role as the newspaper editor. Menjou made more than 150 films, starting in the silent era with standout performances in ""The Three Musketeers"" (1921) with Douglas Fairbanks and ""The Sheik"" (1921) with Rudolph Valentino. He's probably best known for his outstanding job in ""Paths of Glory"" (1957) as the villainous French General. Famed director William Wellman said of him - ""There has never been anyone like Menjou...Brilliant, opinionated, smart as a whip, lovable, and a character.""

Pat O'Brien (1899-1983) was everyone's favorite Irishman. He was a very good friend of Jimmy Cagney and they appeared in 9 films together, ""Angels with Dirty Faces"" (1938) being their best pairing. O'Brien and Cagney were among the original ""Irish Mafia"" that included fellow co-star Frank McHugh, Allan Jennings, Spencer Tracey, Ralph Bellamy and others. O'Brien is best remembered for his role as the coach in ""Knute Rockne"" (1942) where he asked the team to ""win one for the Gipper"" (referring to Ronald Reagan).O'Brien plays a newspaper reporter.

Edward Everett Horton (1886-1970) specialized in playing the comedy sidekick in more than 100 films and on TV. His memorable film roles include the Mad Hatter in ""Alice in Wonderland"" (1933), Horace Hardwick in ""Top Hat"" (1935), and Mr. Witherspoon in ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" (1944). He had a recurring role in ""F Troop"" as the Roaring Chicken (1965) and in ""Dennis the Menace"" as Mr. Matthews (1962-3), and was the Fractured Fairy Tales narrator on the ""Rocky and His Friends"" series (1960-1).

Mae Clarke (1910-92) has a small role as Molly, O'Brien's fianc. We remember her best as the girl in ""Public Enemy"" (1931) who annoys Jimmy Cagney so much that he pushes a grapefruit into her face. She also played Dr. Frankenstein's wife in the classic 1931 version.

Slim Summerville (1892-1946) was a busy comedic actor who appeared in more than 200 films beginning with the Keystone Kops in 1912. He's most well known for the series of films he made with Zazu Pitts (e.g., ""The Bad Sister"" in 1931, ""They Just Had to Get Married"" in 1933) although he did some good dramatic acting in films like ""Western Union"" (1941), ""Jesse James"" (1939) and ""All Quiet on the Western Front.""

Funny looking Walter Catlett (1889-1960)appeared in more than 100 films, playing a nervous type in many comedies (""Bringing up Baby"", ""Daddy Knows Best"", ""Fibbing Fibbers""). He had memorable roles as the barber in ""Lil Abner"" (1940), the stage manager in ""Yankee Doddle Dandy"" (1942), and the drunken poet in ""Mr Deeds Goes to Town"" (1936).

Frank McHugh (1898-1981) provided comic relief to over 100 films. He was part of the original ""Irish Mafia"" and appeared in a dozen films with fellow mafia member Jimmy Cagney and 13 films with mafia member Pat O'Brien. ""Front Page"" was their first film together, and McHugh worked with O'Brian through 1958 in ""The Last Hurrah"" that starred mafia member Spencer Tracey.

The film was nominated for Best Actor, Best Director, and Best Picture, but didn't win. In 1931 the best picture was ""Cimarron"", the best actor was Lionel Barrymore in ""A Free Soul"", and the best director was Norman Taurog for ""Skippy"". ""Front Page"" was re-made in 1940 as ""His Girl Friday"" with Rosalind Russell playing the O'Brien part and Cary Grant playing Menjou's role. It was re-made again in 1974 by Billy Wilder with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau

As a film about the goings on at a newspaper, ""The Front Page"" is among the best. Unfortunately, ""Citizen Kane"" falls into that same category (1941).  Other good films that feature newspapers include ""All the President's Men"" (1976), ""Deadline USA"" (1952), ""Sweet Smell of Success"" (1957), and ""Ace in the Hole"" (1951). Apart from ""Citizen Kane"", my personal preferences would be ""Sweet Smell of Success"" and ""Absence of Malice"".

Looked at nearly a century after it appeared, the film certainly seems racist, sexist, and all things politically incorrect. In addition, the sound is difficult to hear, and some of the photography is pretty dull. If you can put that aside, the film is a riot, capturing the ambiance of newspaper work in the early 1920s in one of the most corrupt cities in the U.S.",1274140800,4,6237,4.987487969201155
741049,3,6303934749,"The previous reviews, read carefully, make it clear that this ""remastered"" edition still shows its age. Milestone is a fine director of early sound films--his All Quiet on the Western Front is a masterpiece--who overcame the drawbacks of the new and still being developed early sound technology. But do be warned--even though The Front Page is a fascinating and still vivid film, with obvious interest for anyone trying to look into the antecedents of His Girl Friday, this DVD edition will tax your eyes and ears! If ever a film was in need of a high quality digital restoration, this is it!  I had hoped to use this is a film studies class, but now I am not so sure.

On a side note, the film is a window into some really good acting techniques ca. 1930: the character actors playing the various reporters are terrific, one and all. And the pre-code frankness of Edward Everett Horton's effeminately ""gay"" performance as Benzinger is a delight.",1252022400,6,946,4.7272727272727275

Small talk reveals their character. Editor Walter Burns asks Louie to find Hildebrand Johnson. One woman wants her $2! Hildy plans to get married and move to New York. Working for Walter Burns is like being in a sewer. [$500 was a lot of money then.] Does Walter Burns have scruples? The scenes say `No'. ""Those were the days."" [Note the high crowns on hats.] Hildy stops by the press room to say goodbye. He will earn $150 a week in advertising! [Do newspapers and advertisers lie to the public?]

Will an execution of a poor man win votes? [Yes.] A new alienist will examine Earl Williams to test his sanity. Will this thwart the Red Menace? Molly drops by to complain about the stories made up about her. [Does this still happen?] The alienist experiments on Earl Williams, who escapes! This brings Hildy back to work with a scoop. [Do they still pay for news?] The talk explains the events. A messenger from the Governor brings a reprieve, but there is a trick here. Hildy gets some money from Louie. Then there is a surprise visitor! Hildy calls Walter Burns. Is Humanity more important than one life? [No, humanity is made up of lives ""no man is an island"".]

After 80 years this story still entertains with few dull spots, but shows its age. There was a newer version made around 1975. Do we need a newer version?",1251504000,2,2754,4.648870636550308
741051,5,6303934749,"I had a DVD of this film, which must have been one step up from a home taping job, because the sound quality was dreadful (to use a favorite Edward Everett Horton word). It was better than nothing, but still left a lot to be desired.

Then I discovered this remastered edition. I got it and watched it and was very pleased. Now, don't get me wrong; this film does not look or sound like something done yesterday, even with the remaster. The picture is still blurry to look at and there are some jumps, but you have to remember that this movie is nearly 80 years old, so it's bound to show its age somewhat.

What is new and better is the sound quality. The dialogue is completely audible, unlike on the previous DVD, where about half the dialogue was muffled to the point of inaudability, and it comes out of both channels on the speakers instead of just one, and you don't have to have the volume at the maximum to hear it. There is still the roar in the background that comes with many very old films, but you can still hear what the actors are saying above it. And the talking is what this movie is all about.

The reporters are acerbic and cranky and mean, but have some humanity, as they sit and wait for a man to be executed. There is a wonderful subplot about the fact that the man is a political pawn and not guilty of the crime, which sheds some light on 1930s politics. Edward Everett Horton has a choice role as one of the men in the press room; it's a serious take on his usual character, an effete hypochondriac, but he doesn't play it for laughs this time. Adolphe Menjou and Pat O'Brien star as the editor and star reporter pair; if you have seen either remakes of the film, the Cary Grant-Rosalind Russell His Girl Friday, or the 70s version with Lemmon and Matthau, you know the basic story. Hildy is trying to quit reporting to get married, but Burns connives to keep him at the job.

There is a lot of pre-code stuff in the movie, which makes it somewhat shocking even today; at one point, one of the reporters actually flips off the Sheriff. The streetwalker is called just that, no euphemisms. There are other things, but I don't want to spoil it for you.

The movie is well worth watching, and learning from. I recommend it for anyone who has seen either remake, just to see where it all started.",1249171200,18,2318,4.319540229885058

741053,2,6303934749,"Having just watched two Movies directed by Howard Hughes close together It suddenlly dawned on me this guy had some oddball agenda.

  Also having watched this movie by lottery twice in close proximity as well, I began to see some serious flaws I overlooked the first time.
  The first time I Watched this it was kinda fun and with lots of famous faces before they were famous, so it was neat for that too.

  But watching it the second time I noticed it was almost annoying to watch.
  Afterward It dawned on me that there were only two people in the show that were treated like real genuine people with emotions and a social conscience...the killer and the ""Streetwalker"". ( the girl who befreinds the killer). Everyone else was acting like a selfish inconsiderate jerk, a liar, or petty, or coniving, or stupid, or antisocial,or downright criminal...and these people included newspaper writers, police, the mayor and a sheriff. (In fact it became clear that Hughes felt they should all be in jail and the killer no where near one) When compared to Hughes other work I recently watched (Billy the Kidd) It dawned on me that Hughes had some sort of axe to grind with society. Probably part of why he turned into a weird recluse.

  This movie is supposed to be funny, and there are a few laughs, but I found the attitudes of everyone depicted incessantly negative. Furthermore though I like many of the actors in this movie normally, none of them shone in any way whatsoever, meaning Hughes obviously put the brakes on thier capabilities to pursue his own agenda.

  As for the quality of the video. The DVD I have appears to have been recorded from a quality VHS with the occasional glitch to give that away.

  But the original recording and camerawork were very poor.
  The sound was inconsistent and usualy poor. The camerwork was unimaginitive and I only recall one shot with a decent angle. The camera was constantly moving in circles or in straight lines...and at one point I almost sucumbed to vertigo.

The story was generally OK but it then took a bizzare and completly unrealistic turn to get where Hughes(?) wanted to get to, with the most rediculous escape you have ever seen. Furthermore the complete disregard imputed to the newspapermen toward the girl further extend the rediculousness of the story.

7857061,3,6303934749,"Hey, am I having a senior moment didn't I review this film already. I know the plot of the film under review 1931s The Front Page seems very, very familiar. And I don't mean that I have reviewed the play by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, weren't they Algonquin Roundtable guys with Dorothy Parker, on which this film is based. I am not that senior moment bound or that old to have reviewed a 1920s Broadway play.

Let me give a rundown and maybe I can refresh my memory about where I have seen this story line before. A bunch of old time police beat reporters, print reporters if you remember that dying profession in the age of 24/7 cable niche and blog citizen reporting, are doing death watch duty in the press room of the local law enforcement building in Chicago, Chi town so watch out. The death watch is for the execution of Walter Mitty-type cop-killer Earl Williams who is set to fry, set to be hung out to dry for the dastardly deed come midnight unless the governor grants a pardon based on him being a cuckoo who had delusions of grandeur. A run of the mill story for the cynical boys who man the crime beat desk (in those days really mostly men so man. Except a funny thing happens to upset that very applecart. Earl, while being examined by a shrink to see if he really was cuckoo, escaped the clutches of the law.

Now that is big news, front page news I would say even in a jaded age like today. In those days, like today as well, the reporter and newspaper of whatever ilk who can get a an angle, get the scoop on the magical realistic escape of a cop-killer, an anarchist cop-killer when the word anarchist had even more sinister implications than it does today to boot, would certainly get a boost in circulation. Enter one Hildy Johnson, played by Pat OBrian, who had supposedly given up the racket to go find Elysian fields in an easier more regular hours line of work with a civilian sweetheart. Well almost given up the racket except he was there in the press room when Earl sprung himself loose. And guess where baffled cuckoo bird Earl landed in his escape. Yeah, that very press room. So Hildy, once a newspaper man always a newspaper man, cajoled by his tyrannical boss Walter Burns, played by Adolphe Menjou, postponed his wedding plans for just a minute to grab one last glory by-line headline.

The whole trick for Hildy and Walter is to keep those other newshounds cut out of the scoop, and to see what makes this Earl Williams tick. Along the way Hildy found out two important pieces of news, well three really. First Earls escape was aided by the incompetence of the sheriff and his minions who are part of that well-known and oiled Chicago political hack machine which Burns newspaper was interested in getting the goods on. Second the Governor has sent one of his minions to grant Earl a pardon which that corrupt machine is set on intercepting to avoid looking stupid and even more corrupt than normal. Third Earl didn't do any dastardly deed he was framed for his political views. Naturally ace reporter Hildy solved all those mysteries and tied them with bows in this screwball comedy. Meanwhile his sweetheart was getting short shrift. Oh well it will all turn out for the best.

Hey, wait a minute, I knew I knew that plotline from somewhere. Sure except it was from the distaff side, nice word right, from Howard Hawks His Girl Friday where Rosalind Russell was Hildy and Cary Grant the newspaper boss. That one was classic with the added twist of a little off-hand romance since Hildy and Walter in that one had been divorced and Hildy was supposed to get re-married to some safe insurance salesman.

In August 2016, the New York Times published a lengthy Sunday feature on film preservation work and spent most of that article focusing on the restoration of this classic newspaper-satire.

Here's the problem: ""The Front Page"" has been released (and reworked) many times! So, that's one source of confusion. You may be wanting&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Front-Page/dp/B0007QJ1Y8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Front Page</a>&nbsp;I'm a big fan of that version, too.

The Howard Hawks version (His Girl Friday) is infamously available from so many different companies that you're as likely to get a bad copy -- as a good one.

Then, the original 1931 ""Front Page"" with Adolphe Menjou and Pat O'Brien has been sold on the cheap (or packaged in combination DVD sets) countless times over the years. As the New York Times pointed out, nearly all of those knock-off versions lacked key elements that were only recently restored to the film -- not to mention the fact that the picture and sound quality often was so dreadful that these cheap versions were tough to watch.

Remember that in 1931, Hollywood sound wasn't what it was today. Even in this beautifully restored version, the sound quality varies. Often, it had to do with how close the actors were to the microphones strategically placed around the set.

So -- if you've read this far -- you already understand why ""The Front Page"" is considered one of the all-time greatest newspaper movies. You're simply trying to make a smart purchase. My review is mainly aimed at saying -- if you're finding my review of the movie on the product page for the KINO DVD with the Library of Congress logo on the cover -- that's the ""good one.""
