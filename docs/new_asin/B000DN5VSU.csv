Good stories without all the SEX and Bodily Functions required in todays TV shows or movies.  The STORY is the reason for the show.",1185408000,,260,4.078431372549019
8102837,2,B000DN5VSU,"I got this for my 7 and 10 year old boys who are really into Robin Hood now.  They watched the old disney movie of Robin Hood and loved it.  However, the picture in this is often very dark making it difficult to see the actors.  Also the sound is very bad.  Some of the plots are a little boring.  But I think my kids would still be okay with watching them if it was better quality.  I wanted something not so violent or fraught with sexual innuendo, which this isn't.  I just wish it was easier to watch.",1169337600,,505,4.040404040404041
8102838,5,B000DN5VSU,"I purchased from Amazon.co.uk each of the four seasons of ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" - all 143 episodes - for about $20 per season.

Digital transfer was excellent and our entire family has enjoyed the series. Packaging involved sturdy plastic cases, each containing 2 DVD's, with 8 episodes per disk. I found this a great value and wanted to recommend it to others interested in the Robin Hood series.",1147219200,,406,4.8
8102839,5,B000DN5VSU,"This DVD contains 4 of the better episodes of the Classic 50's TV series.

THE ROAD IN THE AIR is a great yarn about a lord determined to take over a mill by forcing people to pay a toll to get to it.

CARLOTTA is an excellent story of Little John falling for a dancer from London.  Is she a spy for the Sheriff and even if she is not what will Joan the barmaid (His previous interest) of the Blue Boar say or do about it?

THE GOLDMAKER tells of an alchemist who finds himself at Sir Richard's Castle, does he really have the secret of making pewter into gold?  What will Robin and the Sheriff do about it if he does?  (The episode THE GOLDMAKER'S RETURN was in Vol II, by rights their positions should have been reversed).

THE SCIENTIST tell of a  man who has the potential to create a weapon able to defeat King Richard before he even lands back into England.  Is Prince John tilting at windmills or does Robin have to take a hand?

A lot of quality for a small investment.",1144454400,2,977,4.148936170212766
