8643278,3,B00ILETN50,"This 3-pack consists of films you would never normally purchase separately. ""The 7 Adventures of  Sinbad"" is a modern story that is not well defined. The characters are not developed or likeable and the adventures are ill defined. There is even some fake nudity in this as women seem to go topless but wear leaf-like pasties.

Thor is a cheesy mouth-breather, deer in the headlights character who fights with and against unlikely characters with accents you wouldn't expect in the film.

""John Carter of Mars"" is a re-titled ""Princess of Mars"" starring Traci Lords who keeps her clothes on during the film. It was the forerunner to the better made flop ""John Carter."" Not a bad film, but there is a reason you never heard of this underground near-classic.

Something you might get for a tween male but not for yourself.
