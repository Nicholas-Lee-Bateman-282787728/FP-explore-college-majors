8203069,3,B000RY6Y4U,I was disappointed that this was an edited version of Ilsa She Wolf of the SS. I am not a fan of censorship even if I don't like everything in a film.,1441238400,2,150,3.71875
8203070,2,B000RY6Y4U,"I like naked women as much as most guys do. However, torture and brutality are just not my thing, especially when we know the history behind the portrayed events.",1390089600,,162,4.620689655172414
8203071,1,B000RY6Y4U,"If you, like me, are interested in Ilsa movies because of their cult-like reputation and the expected titilation that goes with a women in prison movie, then you should look elsewhere.  The partial nudity is nothing to write home about.  The torture that you've heard about is mostly off screen.  Of the two movies ""The Wicked Warden"" is better but only if you mesaure in centimeters.  The only reason I say that I say ""Warden"" is a little bit better than ""She Wolf"" is because it had one scence that I really liked.  The scence takes place in the prison bathroom.  When the Ilsa's lesbien lover, and leader of the inmates, is setting on the toilet and another woman enters the bathroom looking for information on her sister's whereabouts, the woman on the toilet bullies the other women into ""cleaning"" her bottom after she gets of the toilet.  You can probably guess how the cleaning takes place, if you can't guess then here's a hint.  The woman who does the ""cleaning"" has to vomit afterwords.",1300320000,3,997,4.6571428571428575
8203072,3,B000RY6Y4U,"Nazi dominatrix, naked women, b-grade entertainment? You bet! This cult classic should be part of every bad boy's movie collection.",1275436800,,131,5.6
8203073,3,B000RY6Y4U,"Nudity, half hearted graphic violence, fake blood, poor editing, loose attempt at a story, and B movie acting(which was the only thing entertaining about these pictures). What I thought would be titular shockers, are just a couple of showcases for female actors to expose themseleves. If your a real fan of Ilsa movies you should enjoy them, but they were not my cup of tea.",1260489600,,374,4.769230769230769
8203074,5,B000RY6Y4U,I ordered the Ilsa Shewolf of the SS and Ilsa the Wicked Warden.  The price was fantastic for these two hard to find films and they were shipped and arrived well before I even expected them to.  I have nothing but positive remarks here.,1200528000,4,236,4.340909090909091
