856942,5,630438100X,"This is the best adaptation of a Vonnegut novel to film yet.  I would even say that the movie had more of an impact on me than the book.
Howard Campbell, Jr., ""The Last Free American,"" is an allied spy who broadcasts Nazi propaganda from Berlin during WWII, but his copy has been marked up by Allied intelligence in such a way that coughs, pauses, emphasis in his delivery are sending out intelligence to the west.  The question is should he be condemned for who he is pretending to be and for the overt message of hate that he sends out on the airwave; or should he be absolved because his covert (unconscious) communication is providing vital information to the Allies and thereby freeing concentration camp prisoners and defeating the Nazis?
Campbell is a character who really doesn't know what he's saying. He spews hate and believes he is sending out useful hidden information, but he can't be sure.  He doesn't believe in the propaganda -- it's a useful cover for speaking the deeper truths in a society that will only hear what it can hear.  Ironies and ambiguities compound on one another until Campbell loses sight of who he is or where he belongs or where he can go. He comes to a dead stop.  He has no reason to move in any direction.
Vonnegut is a moral writer -- funny, but moral.  There is a small bit of humor here, e.g. an African-American Nazi! Irony taken to absurdity. And as a GE-brat myself, I can always count on Vonnegut to work GE (Schenectady in particular -- his old employer)into the storyline somewhere.
The moral of this story seems to be two: ""You must be careful what you pretend to be, because in the end, you are who you pretend to be.""  On this basis, Campbell would be condemned.  And so he is.  The other bon mot of note is from Alan Arkin's character -- a painter friend of Campbell's who turns out to be a Russian spy -- who says, ""Maybe art is the one thing you can't fake.""  But of course art is faking it -- art is making it up, telling the lie that reveals the deeper truth (Picasso). In the end Howard Campbell because the charcter of his fiction and as the creator and writer of that man's tale, is able to pass judgement on his character.  The end of Campbell is of a piece with his life.
Nick Nolte, Alan Arkin, John Goodman, Sheryl Lee all turn in great performances.
Its a terrific literary film. Highly recommended.",997574400,11,2364,4.436489607390301
856943,4,630438100X,"This is a wonderful film for a variety of reasons. First of all, it touts a remarkably well adapted screenplay, probably because the novel of the same name is one of Vonnegut's most conventional works. Both the book and the film are wonderful, and I do not mean to discredit either. From what I have seen, most people coming into this film expect to see a WWII spy thriller. I cannot stress more how I disagree with this assumption, however. It is instead at heart a love story, detailing the love between two characters and how the machinations of the world and a war strive to destroy what they have. It also examines the question ""Do your beliefs or your actions determine who you are"". This film features excellent performances by both Nolte and Lee, but I think Sheryl Lee is the true standout. She delivers an emotional raw performance, proving she is an actress who has not received the serious attention she deserves. Suitable for a variety of palates, I would reccomend this film to anyone.",992304000,4,999,4.649717514124294

Nolte is excellent in the lead and John Goodman also stands out as the American agent who recruits  Nolte's character as an allied spy.  The story is interesting and, I think,  believable.  I will, however, say that I found the experience of watching  it rather downbeat and depressing.

857073,5,630438100X,"it's a well established fact that practicioners of comedy are more likely to be capable of the transition to drama than those of drama are to humor. for my money it's not often worth it, because the comedic gifts being suppressed tend to be more unique, but that's hardly a hard-and-fast rule. Kurt Vonnegut, first instance, made his most perceptible mark as a social satarist, but he turned out to have at least one quite rivetting thriller in him. (the title MOTHER NIGHT, taken from FAUST by Wolfgang Goethe, doesn't have a great deal to do with this story, but it's still a cool title, so so what if he couldn't think of a more relevant one?)
this is the story of one Howard W. Campbell, Jr., an American playwright living in Berlin just as the Nazi menace was beginning to build up steam. inspired no doubt by the odious radio progagandist known as ""Lord Haw-Haw,"" Campbell finds himself with a weekly radio series where he spouts Nazi rhetoric. only, it's been set up for him by the Allied Forces, and what he's actually doing is sending information to the agents of democracy, through a code of inflections, throat clearing, that sort of thing. only a few people are in on this - even Campbell never knows for sure just what vital data he is transmitting - so the world at large comes to know him as a tyrant, a champion of evil.
the story cheifly concerns the aftermath. in the early '60s, years after his heyday as a despot, Campbell falls in with sincere white supremecists, gets caught up in their schemes, and finds himself in Israel to stand trial for his ""war crimes."" because security dictated his true activities be hush-hush, only a few ever really know what he was doing, and there is therefore no one to come to his defense now.
basically the story is a character study in the form of a Rorshach test, asking just how you feel about this hero with villain tendencies. interestingly, one of the ones who'd most firmly made up his mind is Campbells' creator: it is related in the commentary that the producers asked Vonnegut for his assessment, but instead of the debate they were expecting he simply said up-front ""he was a monster"".
you might say Howard W. Campbell, Jr., is the anti-Dexter. being a serial killer, Dexter should give us the mother of all screamin' heebie-jeebies. but because we accompany him in his attempts to decipher how emotion and/or morality work, and of course because he see him reseve his ""gift"" for the genuinely evil, for people we've seen do truly horrendous things, Dexter comes off as having as close to a nobility about him as someone in his condition is capable of attaining.
conversely, Howard Campbell should have his own nobility, since he's doing a job for his country, for the cause of freedom and democracy. and his efforts were apparently of some value, since the Nazis did fall. but the thing is, we never hear what specific good he did. neither the book nor the movie ever mentions prisoners being rescued or skirmishes being sidestepped or whatever thanks to Campbell. we witness only his affect on the ""lay"" people, mostly the loathing and outrage his hate-mongerer facade provokes. in the single most disturbing incident from both the book and the film, a high-ranking Nazi officer states that he came within a hairsbreadth of forsaking Germany when the tide started to turn, and thanks Campbell for convincing him his homeland hadn't lost it's collective mind after all. so Howard Campbell should seem like a hero but just doesn't FEEL like one.
Vonnegut didn't goof. this lopsided statement of the case was a deliberate artistic choice. as he has said more than once, this is a story with a moral: we are what we pretend to be. he's actually asking you, does even the defeat of ""Der Furer"" justify transforming oneself into a monster?
so does it, or what?",1369440000,2,3822,4.688988095238095

857142,3,630438100X,"I am happy to report that ""Mother Night"" is a far more superior adaptation than the embarrassment that was the film version of ""Breakfast of Champions.""  Here is a movie that really does its best to stay true to the original source.  Things are left out at times, sure, but the overall message is left in tack.  Still, it is with regret that I say the movie doesn't completely work for me.  It came close, but I have to say that this adaptation is a helluva lot better than most.

The story concerns one Howard W. Campbell Jr., who awaits for his trial in Israel for war crimes.  Born in America, Howard ended up being a powerful and forceful tool of the Nazis, as he has a knack for writing and was well respected by the Nazis when he and his wife moved to Berlin where he wrote a number of plays.  Howard spreads propaganda during the war where his voice is heard by many through his infamous radio broadcasts.  Only thing is, Howard really isn't a Nazi.  No, he is an American Spy posing as one.  He had been hired by a man who works for the U.S. Government, although he cannot seem to prove he really exists.  The problem is that Howard does a little too good of a job pretending he is a Nazi, and his speeches end up being a lot more horribly effective than he could have ever dreamed of.  As Howard writes from his jail cell about all of the events that have occurred to land him there, he is forced to define himself as a human being, and wonder what exactly has he accomplished.  Was it for good?  Did he do the right thing?  Did he do the right thing for the right reason?  These are questions that tend to haunt him as he tells his story.

The movie is well directed and acted.  Nick Nolte does a fine job with his role.  I couldn't have asked for anybody better to play ""Howard W. Campbell Jr.""  Alan Arkin and John Goodman are also terrific in the film.  There are some genuine funny moments, along with some heartbreaking ones as well.  The movie, as I've said in the beginning, does a really good job of not betraying the book.  The DVD has a few neat extras, like an on-the-set interview with Kurt Vonnegut and Nick Nolte, and some deleted scenes.

So why only 3 and a half stars?  The main problem I had with the movie was that I found it to be a little too artsy and somber.  Vonnegut is very hard to present on film, as most of the humor and insight comes from the writing itself.  I felt that the transition to film ended up leaving out a lot of the dark humor that is in the book.  Not on purpose, mind you.  And while the book wasn't meant to be a laugh-riot, the film feels a little overly sad.  If I had seen the movie without reading the book, I probably would have enjoyed it more.  Still, this is a far better adaptation than most.  I admire the fact that the movie does not try to go for a clean Hollywood ending and lets it end the way it was meant to be concluded, just as it happened in the novel.

If I never read the book when I saw this film, I'd probably give it 4 stars.  I know you should always consider the book and movie to be two separate things, but that's not always easy.  Especially if you really love the book.

""Mother Night"" is by no means flawless, but it does a good job with Vonnegut's words.  It's a fascinating story with a lot of twists.  If you haven't read the book, there's more of a chance that you'll end up liking it.  If you loved the book, I think there's still a chance that you will also enjoy it, even if you don't end up loving it.  It's definitely worth a rental.  And if you haven't read the book, I highly encourage that you do so!  - Michael Crane",1258761600,,3616,4.151296829971182

857259,4,630438100X,"This is the story in which Kurt Vonnegurt tackles the heavy topic of a fictional character:- an American Nazi Collabotator, at least partially based on the true-life examples of 'Axis Sally' and Lord Haw Haw, American/British collaborator who worked for the Reich Broadcast Service and beaming out anti-Allies propaganda in WWII.  A dangerous and difficult topic at best of times, an explosive one if it is not handled well.  But the director pulls it off with great skill, sensitivity and panache with this adaptation, blending the tension of war, personal tragedy, picaresque twists of fate and ""X-files"" like paranoid conspiracy theory.  A remarkably keen-eye and un-preachy treatment of the issue of Nazi collaborator and their subsequent lives living incognito amidst their arch-enemy, America. The director wisely avoided moralising, crude evil/good comparisons, and cut-out stereotyping of Nazis as ogres or monsters, but instead produced a thought-provoking & sensitive account of the picaresque twists of fates endured by the lead character, an American Nazi Collabotator who married the daughter of the Chief of Police of Nazi Berlin.  If you are interested you may also wish to try 'Apt Pupil' (DVD also available on Amazon.

857261,4,630438100X,"This 1996 film, starring Nick Nolte, is based on a 1961 novel by Kurt Vonnegut.  Knowing the author's work, we can expect a few satirical scenes and this is what is both the strength and the weakness of the adaptation by John Gordon. The opening segment is in black and white and is set in an Israeli prison in the 1960s.  Nolte has just been arrested for war crimes.  He is put in a cell and told to write his memoirs. He is given a manual typewriter and a ream of paper.  He begins to type.
Now we switch to color and we see Nolte's story.  He's an American living in Germany in the 1930s.  He's a successful playwright and is married to a famous German actress who he loves dearly.  When John Goodman, an American agent asks him to spy for the Americans, Nolte accepts the challenge. It's a very unique challenge too.  Nolte is to write anti-Semitic [news articles] and broadcast them over public radio, in English, to be heard around the world.  However, every time he coughs or pauses or clears his throat, it's really a coded message to the Americans.  The Germans love him and he holds a high status.  At the end of the war, there is nothing but devastation for him.
At this point John Goodman returns and tells him the Americans will never acknowledge his work but they will bring him to America to get lost in the crowd.  He now moves to Greenwich Village, and this is where the story goes a little out of control.  Alan Arkin is cast as his neighbor.  And his role is a mystery.  There's also a neo-Nazi organization, which is so comical that I had to laugh out loud.  And a silly story whereby a beautiful woman who might or might not be his former wife, comes into his life.
The story was interesting and moved quickly.  But it was clearly just fiction, and sometimes taken to such extremes as to be silly.  Nolte is one of the finest actors around and his acting is terrific.  The role calls for him to not be really patriotic towards either of the regimes.  He chose to do what he did because of a personal adventure.  And therefore is not a sympathetic character.  It's a film designed to be clever rather than one that pulls at your heartstrings in spite of the interesting theme.  And it's done well.
The DVD has an interview with Nolte and Vonnegut during the filming.  It didn't add much to my appreciation of the film, but its nice to see the work in progress.  ""Mother Night"" is clearly a showcase for Vonnegut's talent and a good role for Nolte.  I do recommend it but don't expect to be moved or enlightened.",1044144000,14,2531,4.3661670235546035
857262,4,630438100X,"This was a brilliantly frustrating film about a confused man named Howard Campbell (Nolte), a brilliant if ill-fated playwright who led an ambiguous life for an American in wartime Germany.  Recruited as a deep-cover allied spy, Campbell ingratiated his way into the inner circles of the Nazi high command, then passed his secrets to our side through special coded messages.  Unfortunately, to earn the Nazis' good graces while providing an open avenue to transmit his secrets, Campbell becomes a German propaganda hero - ""The Last Free American"".  His cover proves too convincing by war's end, earning Campbell a spot next to ""Lord Haw-Haw"" and ""Ezra Pound"" in the victorious allies' hall of shame.  Though victorious, the allies maintain the secret of Campbell's wartime service against the Nazis, mostly because disclosure would muck up America's complicated post-war position (i.e., the ""cold war"").  Others, chiefly an OSS officer named Frank Virtanen (Goodman) are less convinced that Campbell's act was really an act, doubting that Campbell himself would have revealed himself to the Nazis had they won the war.  Campbell suffers a quiet obscurity in `50's NY, until a resurgent band of Nazis plucks him out of hiding, returning him to the public eye and its scorn.  Campbell finds himself targeted by thugs who may work for the Russians, while being essentially spat upon by everybody else.  In a twist, the only asylum he can find is with the Nazis - especially painful because their devotion undermines the only source of strength he has left: his belief in his own innocence.
This was a brilliant film in that it works to achieve two seemingly opposite ends - both to exonerate and condemn the hapless Campbell.  On the one hand, we never fall for the idea of Campbell really would have thrown in his lot with the Nazis had America lost WWII.  On the other hand, like Campbell, the Nazis were also self-invented figures - actors who took their roles as genocidal supermen too seriously.  Though revealing their secrets to the allies, Campbell's propaganda-laden messages inspired the Nazis to press on, even as their shattered armies contracted further into the defeated Reich.  Years later, Campbell is forced to consider the possibility that his mission and intentions may not have been enough to outweigh the harm inflicted by a Nazi assault that took its stage cues from ""The Last Free American"".
It's a challenge the script doesn't quite meet.  It would have been better had the Yanks kept Campbell on its public-enemy list because they shared Virtanen's suspicions - cold-war intrigue just seems a cheat.  The post-war Nazis themselves seem darkly laughable, but laughable is laughable, like an episode of ""Hogan's Heroes"" scripted by Roald Dahl.  A cell of these guys turns out to be, unsurprisingly, a group of old men who spend less time planning their conquest of eastern Europe than watching old propaganda movies -  including some vintage reels starring Campbell.  (I think there's something of a joke in that the decrepit surroundings in which the old Nazis take refuge is meant to recall the ""Secret Annex"" from ""The Diary of Anne Frank"".)  The frustration comes at the end when Campbell loses his faith in himself.  By then, despite signs that even the hard-hearted Virtanen may rise to his defense, Campbell surrenders himself to the Israelis for the purpose of being tried for his crimes.  Sharing an Israeli cell next to Adolf Eichman. Campbell bares the ultimate and final insult.  Though the film seeks to clear and condemn Campbell, the ending seems an unambiguous conviction.  So much for the good war, says Vonnegut.
This was a great movie, with winning (if subdued) performances by Goodman and Nolte, but also Ala Arkin as a character who seems to suggest the Yossarian character he played in ""Catch-22"".  Also watch for Vonnegut himself as an unspeaking character Campbell encounters during his denoument.",1038787200,3,3941,5.06656346749226
857263,3,630438100X,"Mother Night:  A War Depiction
 The movie Mother Night was a well-done piece of work.  The depiction of the prejudices in Germany and America during the time of World War II was accurate.
The movie was a thought provoking film, in that everyone had an important role to play and everything was pulled together smoothly for later reference.  Kurt Vonnegut did a fairly good job with this plot of this movie.
 The movie opens in black and white, with an older gentleman being put into prison and Bing Crosby's ""White Christmas"" playing.  He is thrown into the prison cell in Haifa, Israel in 1961 and given a typewriter to prepare his memoirs.  As the movie progresses, we find out the name of the prisoner, Howard W. Campbell Jr., and that he is an American.  As he begins his memoirs he has flashbacks to earlier years, and he begins to narrate his life.  Howard Campbell Jr. is an American who moved to Berlin, Germany with his parents.  Once his parents moved backed to America, Howard remained in Germany to become a playwright, and he married a German actress, Helga.  Howard becomes a successful playwright and very prominent.  One day his life changes when Howard's ""Blue Fairy godmother"" gives Howard the option of becoming an American spy in Germany, and from then on Howard's life is never the same.  Howard does a radio show every Sunday afternoon and calls himself the ""last free American.""  The show seemed as if it was propaganda against Jews and any other races that were not German or Caucasian, but the real purpose of the radio show was to send secret messages through code words to the American army.  After paying his duty to the American army, Campbell moved back to the states to begin a ""new life.""  As time progressed, life became just another hobby for Howard, until he encountered more life altering incidences.  Soon he found himself in Israel surrendering.
 Mother Night had a good story line.  The movie had interesting twists and turns to keep the viewer ""on edge.""  Some parts of the movie were humorous, while others were used to lighten the mood of the previous scene.
 The idea or concept of switching from black and white to color had a great affect in the movie.  The two color schemes were clever ways to keep the audience's attention, and made the movie more interesting.  The historical aspect mixed with humor and the different color schemes made the movie enjoyable.
 The movie did have a few flaws.  The movie did not need the sex scene.  I understand the point of a nation of two that they were trying to make, but love is not always expressed through sex.  I appreciate the fact that Howard and Helga were married and that the movie did not show two unmarried people together.  I believe the movie could have been just a good without the sex.  I also found the depiction of minorities slightly offensive.  There was the ""token black man"" who was only a dumb limousine driver, and I felt that he was the ignorant humor of the movie.  Some of the other characters were mindless as well, but not totally ignorant to everything around them.
 The movie  Mother Knight had an out of the ordinary plot for my taste, yet it was able to get my attention and hold it.  Some parts, I did not think were necessary to make the movie good, but for the most part it was an enjoyable movie.  I probably will not recommend this movie to many people, because of the fact that there is a sec scene and I do not think that the movie is geared toward my age group.  In order to appreciate the movie, I thing one needs to like historical fiction and war time movies and know a little about them.  I was able to enjoy Mother Night, but I think it will be enjoyed and appreciated more by generations with people older than myself.",1037923200,,3749,4.550074738415546
857264,5,630438100X,"We are what we pretend to be to everyone but ourselves, aren't we?  That is one of the recurring themes in the film adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut's novel  Mother Night.  This film pushes at a person's psyche, causing one to think on several different levels. The underlying themes are what make the major impact in this film and can be applied to anything as well as the themes' cloak, World War II.  Armed with Vonnegut's caustic humour and subtle irony, the filmmakers created a weave of themes for the watcher to unravel;  themes ranging from a person's existence to ignorance.
 The movie's opening sequence is enough to reveal to the watcher that this movie will be rife with ironic occurrences.  The sequence begins with a black and white depiction of the Israeli flag while Bing Crosby's ""White Christmas"" plays over the scene of guards escorting an elderly Howard W. Campbell to his cell.  There he is instructed to write his memoirs.
 We are taken back to when Campbell was an American child in Germany, and from that point he grows into a promising playwright.  He become a sort of golden boy in the German stage circuit.  He is later recruited into the American spy world and becomes one of America`s most effective agents.  Each week, Campbell broadcasts a fiery speech about Nazi ideals.  These speeches are heard throughout the world, causing most people to hate Howard W. Campbell, Jr., while the Nazis idolize him.
 The catch with Campbell's speeches where the coded messages inside of the words.  Campbell would write his speech then send it to his ""editors"".  These people would then send it back with notes on when to pause, cough, clear his throat, and other such gestures.  These breaks where relayed over the radios and to America, where someone interpreted the signals.
 Here  is where Campbell`s dilemmas begin and here is where the themes of this movie are introduced.
 ""You are what you pretend to be""  is the most significant of these themes. We are what other people believe us to be.  With the exception of four people, Campbell included, no one knew that Campbell was actually a spy relaying messages to the Americans.  In his eyes, Howard W. Campbell, Jr., was a good man.  To the rest of the world, Howard W. Campbell, Jr., was a good nazi.  His weekly speeches stirred the passions of German citizens.  The speeches struck the citizens' emotions, causing the people to stand stronger and fight longer for their worthy cause.
 I found another theme inside of this film, one that struck me as most disturbing.  The theme of the danger of ignorance.  When Campbell is in Germany, there is true, unabashed hatred for those who were not German.  Nazis actually hunted down these people and murdered them, because the Nazis just knew that those people where the scum of the earth.  Later on when Campbell is living in New York City and the white supremacists find his address, they offer what most people write off as simple comic relief.  The dentist turned reverend studied the jaw lines of paintings of Jesus.  His conclusion was that Jesus was not a Jew because he had no Jewish jaw line.  The reverend wrote a book on just that subject.  The willing death of Mr. Krapptaur at the feet of Campbell, his idol, was strange and sudden.  These actions seemed to be much more than a simple farce to me.  It was like some twilight zone.  The actions made me wonder if those men actually understood the consequences of what they were doing.  Those men should have been taken to the death camps to see with their own eyes what their immature hatred was capable of destroying.  Would they then bow before Howard W. Campbell, Jr.?
 So the circle of the movie goes on, the plot running into and over itself, weaving over holes and through history.  Themes that apply to a world now as well as a world when Vonnegut concocted this novel, and themes that will always apply to this unending circle of history.  The difference between how you see yourself and how others see you is outlined in this film as well as the factor ignorance plays in our lives.  Mother Night is a movie for someone who appreciates irony, and it is a movie for someone who is not afraid to be confronted with the truth that you are what you pretend to be.",1037923200,2,4245,4.655450874831764
857265,4,630438100X,"Throughout his acting career, Nick Nolte has never particularly inspired my admiration. Until MOTHER NIGHT, that is.
In a film adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut's novel of the same title, Howard Campbell is an American playwright who grows to manhood in Germany before World War II. He marries Helga, a German actress. During the war, he elects to broadcast anti-Semitic speeches for the Reich Propaganda Ministry. Unknown to his Nazi bosses, he was recruited as an agent by the U.S. Defense Department shortly before the outbreak of the conflict, and Howard's radio sermons pass along coded messages to the Allies. Only three other Americans know of his role: his mysterious recruiter Frank (John Goodman), FDR, and the head of the OSS. Frank tells Campbell that the American government will eternally disavow his heroic actions as the Soviets would twist the story into some sort of anticommunist German-American plot.
By the war's end, Helga is dead. (Or is she?) Campbell is captured by the U.S. Third Army, but then released, apparently on the intercession of Frank, who also manages to spirit him to New York to restart his life.  After 15 years living there unnoticed, Howard's role as Hitler's tame American is revealed to the public by an admiring neo-Nazi organization. Both the Israelis and Soviets clamor for his repatriation to stand trial.
MOTHER NIGHT plays more like a live stage production. It begins with Campbell being escorted to an Israeli prison to the song of Bing Crosby's ""White Christmas"". The film is a series of long flashbacks. At one point, Howard observes in a voice-over to the viewer that one must be careful what one pretends to be for that is what one truly becomes. Although MOTHER NIGHT has been criticized for its lack of a message, I rather believe that it's that an individual must in the end take responsibility for his/her actions in life regardless of the role, real or pretend, that's been played. For Campbell, realization of the consequences to humanity of his wartime persona comes at three widely separated points. The first, as the Red Army drives on Berlin's outskirts, Howard's father-in-law, the Chief of Police, tells Campbell that even though he (the Chief) suspected his son-in-law of being a spy, he now realizes that Howard served the Reich more than he might have ever served the enemy. Why? Because Campbell, with his broadcasts, made the Chief (and presumably other Germans) better Nazis. The second point comes in New York as Campbell views archival footage of one of his more rabid diatribes. And the last, in the Israeli prison, when Howard has a stunning insight during a conversation with Adolf Eichmann regarding the amount of self-credit the latter takes (or not) for the annihilation of 6 million Jews.
I can't give MOTHER NIGHT five stars for the simple reason that the neo-Nazis that Campbell eventually meets in New York are rendered as almost comic characters whose racist views don't come across as menacing as they truly are. Had they been portrayed with more seriousness, the overall impact of the film would have been, I think, greatly enhanced. Nevertheless, MOTHER NIGHT is well worth viewing.",1024617600,22,3165,5.0056925996204935
7869383,5,630438100X,"Its a great book. Its theme (announced immediately by Vonnegut) is: You are what you pretend to be, so be careful of what you pretend to be. I teach this and find it intrigues students no matter when I teach it, as evidenced by the papers students choose to write about. It applies to all of us, especially the protagonist of this book who writes plays but is asked to take on another, more difficult role.",1515369600,,406,4.355263157894737

7869386,5,630438100X,"This is a film that concerns the narrative of Howard W. Campbell, Jr a man who is politically apathetic and deeply in love with his German wife.

His job is to get in with high ranked Nazi's and send secret messages to the American's via his weekly radio show. Consequently, Campbell begins to make his way up through Joseph Goebbels' propaganda organization to become a Nazi propagandist. A vision of Lord Haw-Haw comes to mind. He does this through carefully orchestrated eccentricities that come to fruition in Campbell's speeches, such as - deliberate pauses, coughing, etc. Nevertheless, when the war ends he is condemned as a war criminal but escapes to New York, where numerous odd plot twists await in the form of a Soviet illegal and an African American Nazi.

The plot is carried through with skill, and apt self-confidence. In addition, there are some fabulous moments of black comedy involving three rightwing Christian fundamentalists and a very highly ranked Nazi in a prison cell. This is perhaps one of the best roles Nick Nolte, which he has played. This is an excellent and thought provoking film and thus comes highly recommended.",1474070400,,1281,4.8493150684931505

7869388,5,630438100X,"A: I love Nick Nolte, B: I have read Kurt Vonnegutt many times but not this particular.book, however the movie does not disappoint.  It does a marvelous job in moralizing as you really don't know just who this Campbell man is. Yes he is hired to do a job of good but in so doing, he himself does not know what good he is doing and yet verbally he is spewing hate, just as the nazis did. He even endseach broadcast with the familiarheil hitler, ( failure to capitalize those words were purposeful).  He has Americans hating him, nazis love him and Jews hate hhim, all for good reason. The ending when he asks goebolls(sp) if he takess responsibility for six million jews and his reaction to the latters reply of that Campbell could take responsibility for a few, was not far off. The theme of you are who you pretend to be is so appropriate. The movie plays more like a play and at times you wonder if his flashbacks aren't fantasy. For instance the black nazi officer played by Franke Faison seemed a lot like seeing a jewish nazi, would not happen. Never-the-less it is an excellent movie, one I would highly recommend even for its darkness. It is true, I don't mean a true story but the theme, moral etc is.  It holds your interest and is fascinating. Buy this one for your collection. The special features alone are worth the price. But you also get a movie with Nick Nolte lead which to me is worth the price of admission.
Don't miss this one. I'm telling you, it is wonderful. Alan Arkman as usual does a masterful job. You have to watch it for its surprises and twits that you'd never believe until you see it. No give aways here. I don't want to ruin it for you.",1469491200,,1669,4.342948717948718
