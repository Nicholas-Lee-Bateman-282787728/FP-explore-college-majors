3864965,5,B0027CT65E,"I really liked this movie! It tells the story of how Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy, and Scooby met and how they formed Mystery Inc. After a misunderstanding on the bus, they all receive detention and get to know each other. Soon, some ghosts pop up and ruin the school pep rally and the gang are accused of doing it, so they are expelled. They try to disguise themselves and go back into school to figure out who is behind bringing the ghosts to life. (I think Daphne looks incredibly hot disguised as a goth girl!) When they figure out what the ghost is after, he kidnaps Scooby and forces the gang to look for a time capsule. I highly recommend SCOOBY DOO: THE MYSTERY BEGINS!!!",1253145600,20,678,4.432
3864966,1,B0027CT65E,"It blatantly contradicts continuity established in the television series ""A Pup Named Scooby Doo"" Plus it's atrociously written and performed. All involved should be ashamed of themselves...",1253145600,6,190,6.074074074074074
3864967,4,B0027CT65E,"We watched this the other night on Cartoon Network, and for a made for TV movie this was a riot! The kiddos loved it, and of course us grown folk did too. This will become part of our library once it's released.",1253145600,5,211,4.0476190476190474
3864968,3,B0027CT65E,"First, I want everyone to know that I love the first two Scooby-Doo live action films. I thought the casting was done well, the stories were fine, and they looked good. I thought the second one was a little cooler because it had a lot of the ""monsters"" from the original Scooby-Doo, Where Are You? series coming to life.

With that being said, I was a little concerned with this third entry in the series. Usually a movie with this many red flags spells absolute disaster and almost guarantees a turd of a film. Let's spell out the red flags: its direct-to-DVD, it's a prequel, it's totally recast, and it's got a new director. Wow. That's a lot to have going against a movie. Interestingly enough, it didn't prove to be true for this flick.

Scooby-Doo: The Mystery Begins somehow rises up above the crowded direct-to-DVD sequel / prequel cesspool and actually is successful at being entertaining and not completely cheap-looking. You can tell that director Brian Levant really wanted to escape the stereotype that these types of movies get and show that he was serious about the subject matter and franchise. Warner definitely played it smart with Levant, being that he is responsible for bringing to the big screen some very successful family movies and iconic animated TV shows like Beethoven, The Flintstones feature films, Jingle All The Way, and Are We There Yet?

The casting was done pretty well. All the actors fit the parts, although not without a few minor problems. Robbie Arnell would have completely been convincing in the part of Fred, except that for some reason he wasn't made to bleach his hair blond for the film. What was the reasoning behind that? I mean, he did take the part of an iconic blond character. The least he could have done is bleach his hair out to put the finishing touches on the role. My only other problem was with Nick Palatas' performance as Shaggy. He was really good and definitely looked the part. It just seemed like he was going a little overboard with the cracking squeaky voice sometimes. It seemed a little forced at times. I thought it was cool that they kept Frank Welker as the voice of Scooby-Doo, as he has been doing the character for the past seven years in different series and movies.

Even the special effects were done well. The ghosts all looked just as good as any of the ones in the two movies they released in the theaters. I have to say, though, that there were scenes of the Scooby gang that were missing Scooby-Doo that felt kind of awkward. It almost seemed like they cut him out of the scenes to save money on their CGI budget. There were some parts with Scooby that looked a little less than stellar and where it looked like the actor in the shot with him was having trouble interacting with an invisible dog. They were all minor problems, though. It shouldn't take away from your viewing pleasure.

Overall, I have to say that I was pretty impressed with this movie. It was kind of fun to see the gang paint The Mystery Machine, meet each other, and solve their first crime together. If you're a Scooby-Doo fan, I'm pretty sure this movie will live up to your standards.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scooby-Doo-The-Mystery-Begins-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo-Digital-Copy-Blu-ray/dp/B002FGTPRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scooby-Doo: The Mystery Begins (Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy) [Blu-ray</a>]",1252972800,7,3400,4.937062937062937

3864970,5,B0027CT65E,"Ever wonder how the gang got together?  Such a group of investigators just didn't answer a help wanted ad.  ""Mystery Hunters wanted.  Apply at the haunted house on Wilkinson Lane"".  Don't think so?

What about a discipline hungry vice principal who thinks four 'trouble' makers who ruined his 09 Mustang should get detention for a month?  Yeah, that's how Shaggy, Velma, Daphnie, and Fred met, then realized when a ghost appears during their 'time' that something was up.  Common interest in mysteries, and a insatiable need to find out WHY!  Coolsville High School will never be the same once the secret behind the hauntings is uncovered.

As with any of the live action Scooby films, we have the Mystery Machine fresh from Dapnhie's garage, Shaggy's basement pad, and the secret behind Scooby snacks.  Lots of 'The story of' in this one.  There is enough action, enough traditional Scooby Doo elements to keep any fan happy.

[...]

I look forward to the next Levant production.

Scooby is the the only cartoonish one in it, the rest are all real people.  Even the people playing the teenagers look like what they look like later, which is nice.

3865035,5,B0027CT65E,"I bought this fully expecting to be disappointed.  Although I'm sure I enjoyed the other movies in the past, the cartoons have always been my favorites since I watched them as a kid.  I had my oldest son next to me when we watched the previews on the Amazon page and his mouth dropped open and he said we HAD to get it.  Most previews hype up a movie so much and then we end up disappointed so I made a compromise with him and we bought it.  The day it came in I put it in the DVD player to let the kids watch it and had planned on doing something else myself.... but I got sucked into the movie!  At first it was because I thought it might have been too scary for two young kids but then I just wanted to see how it ended.  It was definitely a lot better than I thought it was going to be and kept me entertained.  The kids LOVED it... and although the ghosts are a little on the scary side there is quite a bit of humor in it that makes it a little less scary.

For sensitive kids, I would be a little cautious with the movie.  The ""bad guys"" ARE a little more on the scary side.  Even my children (which are pretty obsessed with scary things already from watching their father play video games) were talking about ghosts in the house after watching the movie.  All of us have very active imaginations so I try to be careful on what gets put on the TV... but this is almost borderline for me.  If the bad guys weren't so creepy then I would say this is a MUST HAVE for any Scooby crew fan.  However, I would be cautious with young children.

As for the acting... it's not the best and I kept thinking I knew the actor who played Fred from somewhere and after looking it up I finally realized it was from How I Met Your Mother where he played a character named Scooby!  That completely cracks me up!  I don't think the acting is horrible, but I couldn't fall in love with all of the characters.  I'm not sure if it was from their acting or just the fact that there were some differences from the cartoons.  I read a negative review that I agreed with only ONE thing out of and that was the fact that Scooby didn't seem to be in the movie that much.  In fact, I felt like they had to work hard to get parts in the movie for Scooby.  However, I like the fact that they explained how everyone met... and I didn't think the ""plot"" was missing.

Overall, I think it's well worth the purchase and I KNOW that we will be watching this more than once in our house.  The kids already want to have a movie night with their Grandma to watch it with her (she is a huge Scooby fan, too).  My kids are younger and although it was a little long for them, we only had one or two interruptions and then they went back to watching it again.",1438128000,3,2723,4.039179104477612
3865036,4,B0027CT65E,I saw this movie once I thought I wasent gonna like it I thought it was gonna be stupid but I watched and rented it for the first time on iTunes and loved it I like it so much that I even ordered my very own movie of it get it worth the money good movie it is different then the cartoon TV show but it is still just as good was not crazy about the movie called scooby doo or scooby doo 2 monsters unleashed or scooby doo curse of the lake monster that is the second one of scooby doo the mystery begins didn't like the scooby doo curse of the lake monsters but I love scooby doo the mystery begins it is the movie that takes you back to when the gang first meets it is a awesome and funny movie like shaggy driving thought it was Fred's job driving lol because shaggy didn't even know what he was doing or on how to start the mystery machine up and it is the movie where they first see and get the mystery machine and painted it telling you good movie a must see for any scooby doo fan defently worth the money and time let kids watch it if they are a scooby doo fan they will love it I would recommended this movie but poor scooby nobody wanted him until he met shaggy good movie a must get,1429574400,,1191,3.925619834710744

It's almost like they were in a hurry to get this one released.  Plot is very flat.  Maybe a 4 to 7 year old kid would enjoy it, though.  I bought it for two reasons.  Price was the first, then I wanted to own all of the live-action Scooby Doo movies.  Been a Scooby Doo fan since it first came out but don't want to buy every one of them.  I'd run out of space!!!

3865188,4,B0027CT65E,"Like, zoinks! I wasn't sure what kind of miserable hell I was in for when the kids tuned in to the Cartoon Network and this came on. SCOOBY DOO! THE MYSTERY BEGINS is a live-action movie with a CGI Scooby, only it doesn't trot out Matthew Lillard or Sarah Michelle Gellar, nor was it ever intended for a theaterical release. Instead it debuted on the Cartoon Network in 2009 to commemorate Scooby Doo's 40th anniversary, with a revamped cast of actors and catering more obviously towards the children. The big hook is that it's an origin story. So if you'd ever been curious about how Shaggy met Scooby or how Mystery, Inc. came about, then this is must-see programming. Never mind that it subverts the continuity behind A PUP NAMED SCOOBY DOO (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Pup-Named-Scooby-Doo-Complete-1st-Season/dp/B000ZIZX54/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Pup Named Scooby-Doo: Complete 1st Season</a>) by having the meddling kids meet in high school instead of elementary school.

In Coolsville, Ohio, a scuffle on the bus consigns four mismatched kids to the school library on an extended detention, and because John Hughes didn't direct this thing, the kids don't indulge in heavy angst but rather discover their mutual love of mysteries. And when these kids are later accused and suspended from Coolsville High for pulling a supernatural prank, Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley, and Norville ""Shaggy"" Rogers band together to chase clues and clear themselves. But as bright and enthusiastic as they are, their snooping wouldn't have gotten anywhere if not for the contributions of a ridiculous dog that nobody wanted.

As per usual, there's a spooky apparition that eventually gets exposed as a crook rigged up in a silly costume. Mystery, Inc.'s first case involves a time capsule, a suspicious vice-principal, lots of undercover excursions and running away from ghostly attacks, and a turn-of-the-century flood that demolished the town that now lies buried under the present incarnation of Coolsville. SCOOBY DOO! THE MYSTERY BEGINS rides on the strength of forty years' worth of nostalgia, forty years of being invested in these characters from childhood on. Folks not familiar with the cartoon may dismiss how silly it all is, the ghost story and the gags and the ""Zoinks!"" and the ""Jinkies!"" But all that is kind of like comfort food to me. Although it's a contemporary treatment, it's more of an homage to the classic toon than the two theatrical releases ever were. For whatever reason, my favorite nod is the zigzaggy ""ninja"" route Velma applies when sneaking up on some mysterious building. It just struck me as funnier when a real person is doing it. There's also a late montage that references the famous cartoon's opening credits. Anywho, I ended up liking this movie and this unknown cast of actors. We're made privy to the first ever batch of Scooby snacks and to the shaky maiden voyage of the Mystery Machine a.k.a. Daphne's rusty old van. Those devoted to Fred Jones may mourn the absence of the ascot. At least Shaggy and Velma tend to stick with their traditional color schemes.

Nitpick: Scooby Doo could've gotten a better CGI treatment, but I realize that this is a made-for-television venture and that the budget probably isn't enough to buy a sack of Scooby snacks. Still, there are too many scenes absent of Scooby Doo. I guess I was okay with this. The kids, though, were clamoring for more of the hyperactive Great Dane, never mind that the film also tries to impart the values of friendship and being observant and taking up the hobby of philately.

3.5 out of 5 stars for SCOOBY DOO! THE MYSTERY BEGINS. For those who can't get enough, there's a live-action sequel titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scooby-Doo-Curse-of-the-Lake-Monster/dp/B004Q8O3BE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scooby-Doo!

3865219,5,B0027CT65E,"This is a wonderful live action adaptation to the beginning of the Scooby Doo series, except for a few story line problems.
#1. The beginning says that it's the year 1969, which would be correct according to the original television series, however the problem lies with the fact that Shaggy Rogers (Nick Palatas) later claims in the movie that he has CD's, DVD's and MP3's at his house... A 10 year old child may not see through this as an exaggeration of the truth, however the blueprints for an Optical Audio Disc were not drawn up until 1974 by L. Ottens, a director of the audio industry group within the Philips Corporation, and the first CD was not printed and finalized until 1976.
#2. the Digital Video Disc was not invented until 1995.
#3. Mp3's were not fully developed and downloadable until 1993.
and last but not least.
#4. Magnesium Chlorate has no recorded analgesic or effects of rendering subjects unconscious... this is the same theory in the movie ""Evolution"" when (David Duchovny) claims that selenium is an active ingredient in Head and Shoulders shampoo. Again, IT IS NOT!!!!....

Oh and one more thing ""Hayley Kiyoko is SO DAMN HOT""...",1342224000,,1158,4.79
3865220,5,B0027CT65E,This movie was awesome. Just as it was described and didn't take long to get here. Packaging was a little big but was sealed tight so my movie didn't move around.,1341532800,,162,4.258064516129032
3865221,4,B0027CT65E,This movie is not bad it is a solid scooby doo case but its nothing that makes me say WOW! This is a good movie to be a lower budget movie.i still prefer the first theatrical movies but good.,1336867200,,191,3.923076923076923
3865222,3,B0027CT65E,"First off, let me say that the kid that played Shaggy was written just fine, looked just fine, and SOUNDED dead-on right. He really came across to us like Shaggy Rogers. I did like that they put on the bus the number 1969, that was a cool shout-out for the original series.

Scooby was just fine--- except for his introductory storyline. Scooby an abandoned grown dog that no one ever wanted? NO... Scooby and Shaggy had been together since Scooby was a puppy. Even if you IGNORE ""A Pup Named Scooby Doo"", they've mentioned it in the original cartoon series. (Also, if you're going to show Shaggy at home, at least MENTION that he has a sister-- her name was Suggie, and they had her on ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You?"" for one episode (the gang went to her wedding) and on ""A Pup Named Scooby Doo"".)

Now, for the rest of the ""gang""... No one looked right. Come on, people-- even Freddie Prinze Jr., with his dark haired Latino gorgeousness put on a blonde wig when he was Freddie Jones. (And did a perfect job, as did his wife, Sarah Michelle.) And while Daphne had strawberry blonde hair, it was red enough for acceptability, but... her dress and the way she carried herself... not Daphne. Velma... anyone can put on square glasses and have a severe bob cut, but that doesn't mean you look or sound like Velma. (Linda Cardellini did such a great job it's a hard act to follow, I admit--- Velma looked right off the cartoon but still gorgeous and SOUNDED right...) This girl couldn't act and kept making these... FACES... just the facial expressions killed me.

They barely bothered with proper costumes except for Shaggy, which is part of the characters as well. And I don't buy the Mystery Machine being Daphne's-- it was Fred's mostly, or Shaggy's and he let Fred drive. Either way is acceptable. The ""What's New Scooby Doo?"" Theme at the end when they were painting the Mystery Machine, however-- yes, that was adorable, I admit.

And I don't buy them not being friends until senior year of high-school; I see them more being friends since grammar school or even junior high. And, Fred was a jock-type, but not a stuck up jerk. I see him in high-school as if someone was bullying his buddy Shaggy, he'd pick them up by the neck and give them a toss. (And, yes, I know they didn't know each-other yet--- like I said, don't buy they wouldn't have gotten to know each-other yet.)

Also, Velma was smart-- but you don't have to have her sound like Reed Richards. She talked like a normal person until she was on to a clue. And Daphne would NEVER have worn those outfits. NONE of the outfits her character wore.

All that being said, it had it's moments, but Shaggy, Scooby, and the painting the Mystery Machine montage scene were the only things that made this movie palatable.",1336262400,2,2775,4.54

3865224,3,B0027CT65E,"I am sure this is very entertaining for a child, but not for me. I loved Scooby Doo (the cartoon) growing up, but I found this a tad bit annoying. The guy who played Shaggy did a good job doing his voice, but I guess listening to a live human speaking that way makes it annoying, but it isn't annoying as a cartoon. I will still watch the other Scooby Doo movies, but probably would not watch this one again.",1328054400,3,408,4.1125
3865225,4,B0027CT65E,"My kids are going through a Scooby Doo phase and so I got to experience The Mystery Begins CD. I must say, I was a little put off seeing a brunette Freddie and an Asian Velma, but the group worked OK in their roles. Shaggy initially sounded more like a teen going through puberty than the character I grew up with, but he grew on me. Animation for Scoob is not as good as the original movies, but it is adequate for the target audience. Overall, the movie is worth the price (when discounted) if you have a young Scooby fanatic in the house. Older fans may initially be put off, like I was.",1328054400,,590,4.184210526315789

3865227,5,B0027CT65E,"Just what I said. It's the origin story of how the Scooby-Doo gang first got together to solve mysteries in high-school, and as much as I loved the first two live actions films and of course as great as Matthew Lillard was as Shaggy, and as much as he channeled Casey Kasem & the animator's vision, I must say that Nick Palatas as the young Shaggy is titlting in my favor as a winner. I hope they do another one with this cast, maybe explain how Fred turns blond?

The Scooby CGI is a bit rougher than the first two, tricky to say because the budget was smaller but CGI has improved overall, so it's close to being the same, do I make sense?

Great for the kids, hardly any fart jokes this time around. I have the 2nd ""Lake Monster"" prequel sequel but haven't watched that yet...",1316736000,,779,4.256756756756757

3865258,2,B0027CT65E,"My kids LOVE Scooby  Doo. We have seen every movie and episode both real and cartoon. This movie was terrible.

The cast is all wrong. Shaggy is really annoying and Fred looks nothing like the character. This cast unlike the original cast never clicks and we just did not like them. The store was okay given the use of real ghosts not masked ( very much  like Zombie Island)",1299369600,2,374,4.391304347826087
3865259,4,B0027CT65E,"I was skeptical about Mystery Begins at first, after all, going back and doing prequels of movies has had some major failures.  I thought it would be hard to top the original Scooby Doo movie because Matthew Lillard, Freddie Prinze Jr., Rowan Atkinson, Sarah Michelle Gellar lord the whole movie was just an all star cast and very entertaining (to me) in a true Scooby fashion.  However, I think Mystery Begins pulled it off.

This is a simple movie, fun for all ages, even those of us who grew up on the old Scooby Cartoons.  I would say that it targets the younger crowd mostly.  A little immature, simple plot, not a lot of special effects or high action scenes.  The only problem I had with the casting was Frank Welker performing the voice of Scooby.  He does a good job, but there is something about it that doesn't click like Neil Fanning's. Nick Palatas shocked me with his performance of Shaggy.  A few spots it seems a little forced, but as a whole he does a great job becoming a very tough character! Kate Melton and Hayley Kiyoko are wonderful as Daphne and Velma and interact very well together.  A very good pair to play a female team. Robbie Amell was a decent Freddy, but he just kinda didn't fit the Freddy look.  His facial structure, build, just is off.  His hair color is distracting (but if you've seen Curse of the Lake Monster, maybe we will see the evolution of the bleach blonde :) But still, I can live with his part.

The plot of the movie is very interesting, it caught my attention more than I had expected and it really shows how Mystery Inc. come to grow close to each other.  The ending, however, kind of does away with everything that was built up throughout the movie.  Its just weak and stupid, even for Scooby Doo, I'm sure little kids would even be like ""Seriously?  This is what it all amounts to?""

Overall, I do like this movie.  They kept it sweet and simple while keeping the magic of Scooby Doo.  This movie has also led to Curse of the Lake Monster and I do believe the cast was contracted for 3 movies, so I'm sure we can expect another.  I'm very excited, I was hoping for more Scooby movies and these straight to DVD/TV special premiers are doing exceptionally well, so I'm hoping it spawns a more high-budget project.",1298332800,,2265,4.427536231884058

I thought these characters were much more likeable than the Freddie Prince/Matthew Lillard gang.  My friend's 16 year old sister even liked it, and said she liked the fact that they looked updated and not 70's.  This is a fantastic movie for the whole family and we can't wait for the sequel!",1289779200,,506,4.704545454545454
3865262,5,B0027CT65E,"I will say right off the bat that I am not a huge fan of the Cartoon Network movies, The Mystery Begins and Curse of the Lake Monster, only b/c I have been a die hard SD fan since childhood. My favs growing up were SD meets Sonny and Cher, Adams Fam, Sandy Duncan, etc...the New Scooby Doo Movies. I also loved the 13 Ghosts, the original mysteries, etc. Even as a teenager I still loved Scoob and had Scooby blankets, pillows, pjs, keychains, etc. I've loved SD since I can remember and have always watched any Scoob shows/movies I could get my hands on!
  The couple of reasons I don't care for these newer characters is basically...well just that...the characters themselves...I just can't get over the fact that Fred has brown hair, lol. Even my 3 and 6 yr olds ask about that! Shaggy's voice is also super annoying (sorry folks but it's true...wish he would clear his throat already) The animation is pretty cool, but I just feel no connection what so ever to this cast of characters. I had no problem connecting with the Scooby Doo Movies 1 and 2 (Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prince), so I know it's not a predujice against non cartoon characters, lol.
  That being said, I am so happy that Cartoon Network is still making new Scooby movies! This is a great set for the younger ones with no SD experience. It's certainly more modern and hip for the new SD generation. I do show my kids the older episodes I knew/know and love, and luckily, they love those just as much!
  Again, I know I had some complaints yet still rated a 5....my reasoning is that we'll take Scooby any way we can get him and I'm just happy that SD is still being made, especially ""cooler"" versions for the new Scooby fans!!!!",1289606400,,1709,4.444089456869009

3865264,3,B0027CT65E,"The good
1.) the mystery - when it was front and center - was interesting.  I was surprised by the villain at the end.  Even with Scooby tradition, I didn't see it coming.

2.) Shaggy and Scooby's relationship felt true.  If they were going to disregard ""A Pup Named Scooby-Doo"" at least they kept this bond strong.

3.) Daphne wasn't an airhead. Fred was leader. I kinda enjoyed that Velma didn't know everything but was still smart.

The bad.

I would have really liked to know that they turned subtext into full text - especially with regards to Fred and Daphne.  I am in the vast minority but I have NEVER seen romance between any of the characters.  They've always been close friends.  Making it text gave this movie several squick moments that I had to ff through.  Only at the end did they shake it off - mostly.

Why was Shaggy older than the gang?  Shaggy may not have been brilliant, but he's never been written as someone who repeated school.  Established fact, Shaggy is a gymnast and a track man.  Academically speaking, he wouldn't have been on the teams if he couldn't make the grades (""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?""). Why was his character changed?

This is not an insult to Nick Palatas' performance.  He was rather exceptional, but it just wasn't Shaggy.

The rest of my complaints are more nitpicky - Velma functioning without her glasses? Fred, not driving?  He's always been the driver.  And his not blond hair?

Yes, I would recommend this movie to anyone but would add that they should be cautious for it's not really a beginning to ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?"".  It's more like a prequel to the live action movies.",1268006400,,1636,4.607638888888889

Its a great look at how the gang got together in the first place.",1262736000,,462,4.088888888888889
3865291,3,B0027CT65E,"I enjoyed the theatrical films for their sense of nostalgia mostly.  Though, obviously targeting younger audiences almost exclusively, rather than designed to appeal to us (ahum) aging fans that grew up with the cartoons, it was still fun seeing the characters I loved in my youth, come to life in a new way.  Watching the first two films with my niece and nephew (6 and 8 yrs old) enhanced the experience even more, as they were screaming and giggling like I probably did when I was younger.  This new direct to video sequel was a disappointment for me as an adult.  The nominal production values encouraged keeping the remote close and my finger on the fast-forward button (the button where you can still hear what's being said, but the film is just slightly sped up).  But my niece and nephew were just as excited as they were with the feature films and seemed to love this one just as much despite an effort by Warner Bros that seems almost shamefully exploitive of a wonderful franchise.",1261872000,,992,4.645714285714286

All the cast was perfect!  Adults and kids can watch this for a good family movie night.  Of course there are ghosts so perhaps some kids may think they are scary- mine are 7, 5, 3, and 1 and they all loved the movie.  All in all I think it's worth the money!",1260489600,,429,4.0
3865293,4,B0027CT65E,"We watched this movie before we watched the other two previous action movies with the big stars. At first I thought it was a bit cheesy, but our five year old daughter loved it. I really liked how people could relate to the characters, Velma was not an obnoxious nerd and Shaggy was very loveable, it was hard not to not like him. I thought Fred was cute and I loved that his traditional blonde locks did not make it in this film. The credits show you a picture of what he would have looked like with the hair....AWFUL! Daphne is down to earth and not some rich snob. Yes there was a mystery and plot to this movie. The only thing I really wasn't to fond of was the ghosts, they looked really scary to the point where our daughter wanted to stop watching the movie at first. She got over it quickly but even I was bothered by them.

After watching this a couple of times, we then rented the first dvd movie with Sarah Michelle Gellar, that movie was just awful. Bad acting and over produced, I wished for nothing but the movie to end quickly. Our daughter ended up not liking it either, if that tells you anything.

I look forward to hopefully seeing more of this cast in more Scooby movies to come!",1258934400,,1199,4.254385964912281
3865294,1,B0027CT65E,"NOT a scooby doo mystery at all!!!  There was a faint mystery in the story line.  NO plot! The story jumped around too much for a kids movie.  Characters were very annoying and not fun to watch in the slightest!!! F & D crush on each other....kids don't want to see that! V really isn't that smart...FLAW. Shag...couldn't get more annoying and finally Scooby doo is not even the main character in this flick. The title is ""Scooby-Doo"" and not ""The Kids with the Occasional Dog"". My children are Scooby doo EVERYTHING!!!!! They love ALL the Scooby doo chartoons (old and new) and the 2 Hollywood movies too. My boys loved even the old globe trotter, Addams family Scooby doo cartoons. But this one......DO NOT BOTHER!!! My boys were bored and got up to leave a dozen times through this one. Did NOT keep their attention the least bit!!!  They were so excited to see the NEW Scooby doo movie and was a HUGE let down!!!!

The fact that I am taking my time to write a review (my first review ever) should let you know just how bad this one is!!!

If there was an option for NO stars...............Guess what??",1257811200,4,1105,4.472636815920398
3865295,5,B0027CT65E,"I have to say this movie exceeded by far the expectations I had for a made-for-TV movie debuting on Cartoon Network. They managed to pull it off nicely by delivering a nicely produced Scooby Doo movie! I really can't say anything but good things about the movie, because it was really GOOD. I'd say it was probably at par with the other two live actions films, which were released to theaters worldwide and had a way bigger budget. This story is a bit more reminiscent to the original formula of the show, although it does include real ghosts also, which I think made an interesting combination. All in all, they exceeded 100% in making this film, which tells about the beginning about everyone's favorite detective team in a very enjoyable way. To me, with a bigger budget and slight modifications this movie could've been released to theaters. If you're a Scooby fan, this film will prove to be very exciting and well worth the purchase.",1257811200,,939,4.696969696969697

There were quite a few laughs.  Our biggest overall complaint throughout the movie was ""why does young Fred have dark brown hair?"".  I know that the actors/actresses do not always look like the cartoon character but come on now Fred has bright yellow hair!  All-in-all a worthwhile movie for our collection.",1257120000,,482,4.759036144578313
3865298,5,B0027CT65E,"Every bit as good as the first two non-animated Scooby-Doo movies.  The actors were totally different, but just as good.  They fit the new cast to the characters exceptionally well. Even though Fred was a brunette and not a blond, it worked.  My grandchildren loved it!!!",1256688000,,271,4.8478260869565215
3865299,2,B0027CT65E,"Scooby and the gang once taught kids to be skeptical and that there was always a rational explanation to be found.

""And I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling kids!"" was said by every villain in a mask for the entire run of the original series and for the majority of the spin-off shows.

However, this is the latest in a string of Scooby movies and cartoons that break that ""formula"" and trash the source material by implying things like magic, monsters & spirits are ""real.""  We have enough adults who choose to believe in that sort of stuff without encouraging impressionable children to do so too.

3865301,3,B0027CT65E,"Scooby Doo: The Mystery Begins  has it's cheesy moments, yet it's surprisingly much better than the other 2 live action films. Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini were the only good casting as Shaggy and Velma in those movies. While here Nick Palatas and Hayley Kiyoko are also good as Shaggy and Velma. But Robbie Amell at least is a much better Fred than Freddie Prinze Jr. who over-acted and tried too hard to look cool when he just came off dorky. While I liked how Kate Melton doesn't act as dimwitted as Daphne as Sarah Michelle Gellar. Her Daphne is actually pretty smart and uses her brain just as much as Velma.

  They all bond Breakfast Club style in detention while reading mystery novels. I doubt Sarah Michelle Gellar's Daphne could even read. Daphne isn't meant to be stupid, while Fred was simply just played awful by Freddie Prinze Jr. This movie took a much better approach that's more like the show, well the way the characters act anyway. It didn't really need the scene where Shaggy is testing a gas mask by having Scooby fart lol. I still actually found the movie to be fun and I think they should make a live action show with this cast.",1254355200,21,1160,4.535885167464115

Last I checked there were no laptops, MP3 players or '09 style vehicles in 1969.  Which is the year Scooby-Doo debuted.  Another minus for me was the intro song.  They used the intro song from 'What's New Scooby-Doo' instead of the 'Scooby-Doo where are you' theme.  Oh well, like I said before.  It was a rock solid Scooby movie but, in my opinion, the title should be 'Scooby-Doo: The Mysteries Continue'.",1253664000,2,581,4.663366336633663

Although there are many elements of the old cartoons, it's so great to watch an updated, modern version.  It's hip, funny and incredibly fast-paced.  The casting works really well and the story line of how Scooby, shaggy and the gang met keeps you engaged the whole time.
