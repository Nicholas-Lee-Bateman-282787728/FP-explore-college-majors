7473293,2,B016JB0JPE,Very predictable plot. B movie of Rocky type.,1457481600,,45,4.75
7473294,3,B016JB0JPE,"Spoiler Alert! I like all boxing and underdog movies. I actually liked ""The Challenger"" (Ugh! Generic titles). This movie was really the same story line as Rocky, except the white boxer keeps calling a black woman Mom.  I couldn't help thinking, ""Who is this guy? Steve Martin? Doesn't he know he's white? Does he know his special purpose? Couldn't they find a black actor to play this part?"" Okay, so finally we find out he's adopted. By then I was so distracted that I missed a lot of detail in the story line. Didn't matter though. What mattered was the fight at the end. Oh man.  He wins. The movie should be called ""The Challenger Who Beats The Champion After Getting Trained by the Guy That Was Living With His Mother, and Who Didn't Want the Responsibility of Raising a Kid, So She Splits With Him, Because If He Left Her He Wouldn't Be a Likeable Character, but Anyway, the Mother Has a Heart Attack So That The Challenger Can Box to Support His Mother Even Though She Didn't Want Her Son to  Box Because of Her Experience She Had With The Trainer, You Know, The Guy From The Green Mile Who Is Incompatible With The Mother, The Woman From Law and Order"". That might seem like a long title, but it saves a lot time having to actually watch the movie.",1457222400,2,1257,4.4094827586206895

7473296,4,B016JB0JPE,"Really a good movie, slow at times but overall very good. Kind of a low budget Rocky type movie. I would not miss a night out for it but if you are going to stay in and watch a movie that is a heartwarming feel good movie. This is a great one to watch.",1456790400,,252,3.685185185185185
8736575,4,B016JB0JPE,"I like the moral of the story--not to give up, all things are possible regardless of a person's background.  The only issue I had was the fact that the movie started a little slow.",1515456000,,180,4.294117647058823
8736576,5,B016JB0JPE,"I just loved it, and I give it a 10 stars.",1501372800,,42,2.909090909090909
8736577,4,B016JB0JPE,"Really, 4.5 stars. First, not a real fan of boxing movies but I am a fan of Justin Hartley who is the antagonist boxer that will eventually fight our hero, Kent Moran. Let me say this about Kent Moran...WOW....I believe he wrote the story which is a bit different here and there and he directed it too and starred in it. This is a very talented young man and he needs to get more successes. I thought he was superb. This story offers much the same fare as all boxing movies but it has a few differences. He was adopted by S. Epatha Merkenson and she is wonderful and the mom with the heart problem. Our trainer is the late Michael Clarke Duncan and he is wonderful too, there is more to his story also. The final fight is grueling for both combatants and this whole movie is worth your time. Bravo to all and especially Kent Moran.",1487030400,,831,4.265822784810126
8736578,5,B016JB0JPE,Kent Morran is a good actor,1475712000,,27,3.6666666666666665
8736579,5,B016JB0JPE,"Couldn't have enjoyed it more.  Kent Moran is truly a rising young star.  Hope to see more of him.  Yes, it has a similar story line to Rocky, but then how many times has Sleeping Beauty been remade.  We all know the ending, but enjoy getting there.  Highly recommend.",1472342400,,268,4.387755102040816
8736580,5,B016JB0JPE,"I was expecting to see yet another boxing movie and came away feeling a deeper understanding of many issues facing our nation at this time. The Challenger in many ways is a metaphor. The main character is raised outside of racial division, reminding us that love is colorblind. The coach redeems himself through a second chance at a missed opportunity, not only fulfilling his life path but that of his own father. A young man must overcome the drudgery of poverty to live a life of purpose, so desperately needed in the hearts and minds of our youth. The movie itself, created by an independently owned and operated entertainment production and distribution company, must beat the odds to challenge the giant industry of corporate films, for a chance to shine. A poignantly beautiful ending for Michael Clarke Duncan in his last film role. His generous endorsement of this film in the closing credits is a testimony to the indomitable talent of producer, director, and actor, Kent Moran and his team at Wishing Well Pictures Inc. Five stars for this champion production!",1469404800,3,1071,4.922651933701657

8736582,3,B016JB0JPE,"i rented this because i love the trailers inspirational quotes, sometimes you just need to hear and watch things to inspire you to get back up and keep moving forward. In that reguard this movie did that for me and didn't disappoint. However.... the boxing scenes just look poor, cheap, 2 dimensional and very unrealistic. With that said i still like the movie but just was annoyed with the boxing scenes.",1464393600,,405,4.71830985915493
