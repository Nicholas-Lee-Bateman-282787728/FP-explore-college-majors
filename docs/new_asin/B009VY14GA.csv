5369798,2,B009VY14GA,"I really love the Top Gears series as a whole. But I was truly disappointed with Top Gear second season because not only do I like watching the show, but so do my kids and they now can't watch it because of the unlimited amount of cursing, that at times trumps some rated R movies, of which my kids don't watch either. I was disappointed that the cursing wasn't bleeped out, and also because there were no ratings on the package, or in the product description before I purchased it. This was really something I wanted my kids and I to enjoy together, but now I have a DVD I can't return because it's already opened.",1362009600,,615,4.310344827586207
5369799,3,B009VY14GA,"Wow! What a shock when I recieved my much waited for copy of Top Gear season 2.
We have been enjoying the UK version for afew years now and liked the first season of the US verison ok. Im a mother of 8 sons and have street raced cars and had my share of auto shop in high school. I love cars and trucks of all kinds and have passed that onto my boys. So Top Gear was awesome for us. Until I got my second season. Totally uncut and full of the F bomb. It's used by celeberty and host alike. Along with other cuss words. Im just heart sick about this,and really unsure as to how this is out there. Is this the way it aired on T.V.?  There are NO warnings on the case and none through Amazon when ordered.
I will say Tanner Foust seems to be able to keep his mouth under control. So besides being a amazing driver(which he proves again,an again) he has a better IQ than the other two knuckleheads. At one point Wood looks to the camera and tells his kids its not ok to cheat, unless its to beat your friends. So they get to watch dad cheat and swear. The show seems to not be reviewing cars as much as staging little stunts. So there you have a mothers view and a gear heads view. As for Tanner, he is still fun to watch drive. Just wish my youngest could see it. But its honetly bad enough that I won't let him see it and I will probably donate it to the library with a warning of my own on it. Such a shame...shame on History Channel....shame on Top Gear....shame on those 3 knunkleheads for not being able to control there mouths. SHAME!",1361750400,,1537,4.055921052631579
5369800,5,B009VY14GA,"The first season of the US version of Top Gear was hit and miss. In trying to be an almost exact replica of the British version, too many things felt overly scripted and forced, and tried to shoehorn the three US hosts into being copies of Clarkson, May and Hamster, which they most definitely aren't. Still, they had some good challenges, and their ""specials"" especially were good fun to watch.

Fortunately the US producers of Top Gear quickly realized where their show's strengths lay, and season two (and seasons 3 and 4 after that) are basically nothing but ""specials."" The hosts thrive in this environment, and quickly become a lot funnier and interesting to watch, especially once their identities get settled and they stick to them, and they don't have to try to be as dry and sarcastic as the British trio.

Though the US show still imitates the British show here and there in the types of specials it does, it definitely tries to divest itself from its British idol this season and does a good job of finding its own formula.

Really the only downside for this set is that it took WAY TOO FREAKING LONG to come out! :(

If you enjoy the British version of Top Gear (and who doesn't? Seriously, who are you people??) and are looking for more, I can heartily recommend Season Two of US Top Gear. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1360540800,6,1341,4.575
5369801,5,B009VY14GA,"Season 1 of the American Top Gear was solid. It was certainly no worse than the very early seasons of the British Top Gear. That show improved over time until it eventually became the powerhouse that it is today. I don't think that the American Top Gear will get anywhere near that, but Season 2 showed alot of improvement. In Season 1 of US TG, some of the challenges lacked imagination. They were almost an exact copy of the challenges seen in the British Top Gear. In this second season, some of the challenges are still similar to the British TG, but there just as many original challenges. Another improvement is that a few minor changes were made to the show. The format for the celeb laps and interviews was slightly changed, the news segment was removed and this second season uses its own original theme music at the beginning of the show. I liked these changes because it showed that the producers were going to give this show its own identity rather than imitating the British TG which is partly why the Russian and Aussie versions got canned so quick. Perhaps the biggest improvement is that the hosts have alot more fun in this season. In season 1 some of the jokes seemed very scripted and could almost be predicted before they were actually said or before they happened. The humor in this season just comes more naturally and it is funnier than the first season. I recommended season 1 on DVD and since season 2 is a huge overall improvement, I'd say that season 2 is a must have DVD.",1360281600,5,1499,4.514705882352941
5369802,5,B009VY14GA,"I like the British version of top gear, but when this show came out, I perfer this one now. I feel like this version does give us cool cars(that most of us cant afford anyways) and some incredibly funny moments. Each guy does some incredibly stupid things in this season.

I would recommend it to anyone who likes cars and some laughs with it.",1359417600,8,343,4.359375

5369854,4,B009VY14GA,"Okay, I've never even seen the Brit original, but I sure do like the American spinoff. The three guys have great chemistry together--the race driver, the comedian, and the nerd. And they pull of some amazing driving stunts as they ram their jalopies (and finer vehicles) across the American landscape. Consider when they're off-roading 400 miles to Vegas. One of the rules is that their tires don't touch pavement until a certain point. They run up against a blacktop road they must get across, or it's all over. You should see their ingenious solutions. One rolls across on boards on roller pipes; the next tips his SUV on its side and has the first guy winch him across; the third makes a giant loop of carpet and drives over it like its a tank tread. Great fun.",1394841600,,764,4.583941605839416

5369866,5,B009VY14GA,"I loved the British version so when I heard here was going to be a Top Gear Us I was very, very excited. After an awkward learning season 1, this season is great! The hosts chemistry finally shows and I just can't stop laughing. The ""Big Star, Small Car"" Segment is more fun. I really enjoyed the fact it was unedited, I thought it made it even more funny. Also I think some scenes that didn't air on TV made the cut for the DVD. I understand people complaining about the language but I find myself thinking that Top Gear's target audience is not young children. If you watch the show on History there are bleeps and 99% you can read lips and tell what they are saying anyway.
If I'm going to buy something I want it unedited. Another thing to note is the bonus features. I was excited that they included deleted challenegs, Behind the scenes, and more. I was completely entertained. I enjoy the American version because it is easier to relate to the hosts, the challenges, and the cars. I've watched over and over! I have even already preordered Season 3!",1373068800,,1056,4.420512820512821

5369868,5,B009VY14GA,"These three guys are at least as funny as the UK Top Gear team - in fact I'd go so far to say that Top Gear USA easily beats the quality of some recent Top Gear UK series.
Adam, Rutledge and Tanner are heading into ""more challenges and less studio time"" territory which suits me down to the ground.  They seem to get on really well with each other and have settled into their stride now.

5369887,1,B009VY14GA,"Now, let me first preface this review by saying that I am not a person offended by language when I watch movies or shows.  However, as a parent, you must be warned....there is some strong language in this.  My son is a huge fan of the series on television.  When his birthday came up, I thought he would love to watch this when we go on trips.  So, needless to say, I was a bit shocked to hear (in the space of 5 minutes) the ""F-Bomb"" and ""Axxhole"".  At first I thought I was just hearing things.  However, that was not the case.  I blame the manufacturer for not putting a rating on the product or a warning for language.  I believe this to be a HUGE oversight...they should realize that there are younger viewers for the show.  I just wanted to let other parents know before buying that this is an unedited version of the show.  Which again, is fine for an adult....but not for children.  I am giving a 1 star for not ""clearly"" warning parents.",1367625600,6,946,4.258426966292135

5369892,5,B009VY14GA,"Item arrived on the day Amazon said it would.  Bought it as a late Valentines gift since the show was a preorder item.  My husband enjoys Top Gear, and as always the Second Season was a hit.  It's the kind of show that one can sit down and relax to after a hard day, and be humorously entertained.

With Adam Ferrara, Rutledge Wood and Tanner Foust, there is never a dull moment as the three showcase vehicles of all makes and models, through insane obstacles and conditions; while more often than not, roadtrips on and offroad are in order for them to complete their unexpected challenges.

We love Amazon; for we can get better deals than driving to any Eletronics Department retailer.",1363824000,,687,4.598360655737705
5369893,2,B009VY14GA,"This is going to echo what a couple of reviewers have already noted, but I felt it was important to add my two cents.

The second season of Top Gear USA is a vast improvement over the first, which I personally found to be virtually unwatchable. I don't know if it was because so many of the stunts were carried over from the UK version, the painfully forced studio segments or what, but the first season was bad. Really, really bad.

Then came Top Gear USA 2.0. The guys were actually funny, and now that the show has hit its stride in season three, it's a very close rival to the original UK show. That's the good news.

Here's the bad. I do not appreciate the fact that there's no warning anywhere on the season-two DVD packaging that it's an unedited version. And we're not talking a ""damn"" or ""hell"" here and there ... through the first three episodes or so, there are several uses of the word ""s***,"" at least one ""g**damn"" and even an f-bomb or two. That's just part of the first of four discs.

If the hosts cuss, that's their choice. Just give some kind of warning or something ... or at the very least an option to pick up the original broadcast version.",1363564800,4,1163,4.321100917431193

I was looking forward to season 2 and got it as soon as it was available.  What a disappointment!  They needed to label this unedited because for whatever reason they decided to leave in the foul langage.  I kept hoping the language would get better but it only got worse as the season went on.  I only made it half-way thru when I had enough and threw it away.  I thought a TV show from the History Channel would be ok for family viewing, I was wrong.  Buyer beware!",1362528000,4,574,4.25

8544600,5,B009VY14GA,"Top Gear US is worse than Top Gear UK 1, but far superior than Top Gear UK 2.

I've been watching the 4 seasons of TG: US while I wait for ""The Grand Tour"" AKA, Top Gear: Amazon to come out and while the studio portions are hard to watch (I fast forward through them), the challenges are great. Adam, Rut, and Tanner are younger than Jeremy, Hamster, and Captain Slow so are able to do the challenges that the TG: UK hosts were able to do 8 series ago. I've watched all 24 series of TG: UK and I've laughed out loud probably half a dozen times but I love the chemistry that the hosts have. Watching TG: US, I can say I've laughed hysterically until I was crying and my sides hurt at least 2 dozen times. The TG: US hosts don't quite have the same chemistry together, but individually, are all extremely likable.

Season 2 of TG: US has some of the most entertaining challenges out of all 6 seasons of TG: US. Unfortunately, they still were using the TG: UK model (studio and celebrity bits) and those parts fall horribly flat. Thankfully, they abandon them starting in Season 3.
