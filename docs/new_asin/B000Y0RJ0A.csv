8230513,3,B000Y0RJ0A,The film was meant for a Korean audience. I did not approve of the use of black balloons to censor many scenes.,1406160000,,111,4.090909090909091
8230514,3,B000Y0RJ0A,"'BEYOND THE CLOUDS' is a melancholy film by famed director Michelangelo Antonioni in which he visualizes segments of his own book of short stories, ""The Bowling Alley on the Tiber.""  The film is capable of transporting the viewer to another world - a world encapsulated in an un-ending sadness, in which Antonioni revisits themes from some of his earlier films. The characters in each segment seem to be obsessed and trapped in an existential dread, seeking time and time again to find true love and meaning to his or her life. In the final segment, a young man, disillusioned with life and the futility of finding his dream lover in this hostile world, happens upon a resplendently beautiful young woman - he begins to follow her, day after day, night after night,ultimately follows her into church one day as he falls, ever so deeply, in love. Soon he watches, in agony, as she enters a convent - thus dooming his last chance at finding true love.

8230515,1,B000Y0RJ0A,"Antonioni's last film has a lot going for it, and it is frustratingly out of print in the US, but getting this censored, badly transferred
version isn't really an answer.

You're better off looking for reasonable deals (here, ebay, ioffer, etc) on the used US version, or if you have
a region free player getting the current UK release, then seeing this mangled mess.",1297987200,,367,4.734375
8230516,2,B000Y0RJ0A,"Feels like 3rd generation copy. No film studio identified on (sub-par printshop) cover, package seems copy-ish and mostly in korean characters, film less sharp but slightly more jittery than hollywood. Way better than bootleg quality though, and great price(considering it's out of dist)/ reliable shipping. NOW: this says unedited version but it IS very censored ! NO CROTCH SHOTS!! Only big black
conspicuous circles instead. This is not the bargain version you've been waiting for! --unless you are the ""censorship priest"" from Cinema paradiso. Well, you get what you pay for. Maybe we should Petition Canal+ for re-release!!",1205971200,11,628,5.418367346938775
8230517,2,B000Y0RJ0A,"Im writing this review to let you know to beware of whom you get this movie from. amazon unfortunately doesn't carry this movie so you have to get it from someone else. Just to let you know the Korean version is edited with bib black circles. It's no ones fault , but the sellers of the DVD don,t seem to want you to know that. Esp. bestbuyvds. When I mentioned my dissapointment with the DVD to them they were very defensive and unprofessional about it. Just a little heads up. If you can get a good version of the movie go for it.",1198713600,13,532,4.174757281553398
