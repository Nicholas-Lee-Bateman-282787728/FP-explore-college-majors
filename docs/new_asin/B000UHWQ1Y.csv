8213351,2,B000UHWQ1Y,"I bought this video as a reminder of a similar trip made in Eluthera, I had hoped for a bit more scenery, a bit more unique sights and a bit less of the interviews.  The biggest disappointment is the homemade video - the sound quality was very poor & clipping incessantly from 1/2 way on and there were no chapters to the video so one is stuck fast forwarding through the entire film to get to certain spots.  It was also strange at the end as he commented on surviving the tough trip it was - basically a three hour car ride.  All things considered - visit Eluthera in person, this film does it no justice.",1350950400,,607,4.2155172413793105
8213352,1,B000UHWQ1Y,"I was disappointed in this dvd, it had the appearance of a hand made documentary.

It was a story of one young man look at his own island in the Bahamas, as he toured along in a SUV(that he couldn't drive because it was a stick shift) with only the camera man for company.

I have to admit the scenery is quite beautiful though.",1207612800,,328,4.109375
8213353,5,B000UHWQ1Y,"While some have referred to this film as a documentary, I'd prefer to call it a trip report. Nonetheless, it shows the filmmaker's keen sense of observation and carries a lighthearted humour from beginning to end - not without a much appreciated portion of self-irony. To keep it short: One of the most refreshing pieces of story telling the Bahamas has produced in a while! Watch out for more films by Kareem Mortimer!!",1200873600,,420,4.767123287671233
8213354,5,B000UHWQ1Y,"This is a delightful film made with love and honesty. This movie is very engaging, humourous, colourful and refreshing. A totally ""must see"" for people who yearn for island living and the simplier things in life.",1198281600,,212,4.916666666666667
8213355,5,B000UHWQ1Y,"This was an awesome presentation and truly enjoyable! As a Native Bahamian I am proud of this ""true true"" depiction of the island of Eleuthera! It made me so home sick as well as gave me an even deeper appreciation for my rich heritage. (I am a Savannah Sound decendant!) Hope to see similar productions for every island!  Highly recommended for anyone with an appreciation for well produced documentary with a down to earth simplistic flare!",1197849600,,442,4.815789473684211
