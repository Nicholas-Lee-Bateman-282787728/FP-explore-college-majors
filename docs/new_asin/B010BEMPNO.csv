8721751,5,B010BEMPNO,"Superb documentary. Highly recommend for history aficionados regarding combat aviation heroes. Some extraordinary stories that seem to be mostly, if not entirely true. Some true stories of extraordinary circumstances and heroic responses. A combination of narration, file footage, computer animation and reenactment is used to tell and portray some extraordinary heroic historical moments in aviation combat.

This seems to be marketed and made for the European region, so I was afraid the DVD region mode might not be compatible with my North America USA equipment. The copy I received worked with my USA region equipment, so the DVD I received might be compatible with all regions.",1529020800,,683,5.443396226415095
8721752,5,B010BEMPNO,"My father volunteers at the National Museum of the Mighty Eighth Air Force in Savannah/Pooler, Georgia and had seen these episodes on the Military Channel a while back and was really wanting to have the DVD.  I was worried that the DVD's were BlueRay but they were not and played on his regular DVD player perfectly!  Great episodes and great product.",1514764800,,351,4.737704918032787
