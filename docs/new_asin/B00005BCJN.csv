7937153,4,B00005BCJN,"Michael, a forensic scientist, comes back to town to look into his twin brother's disappearance. It turns out that the mayor is involved and takes measures for the truth to stay buried.
The first time I viewed this movie it tended to drag in the first third. The motive of the story was hard to understand and my beloved Robert Patrick (RP) wasn't seen often. It picked up very well after that, lots of RP appearances and much more action.
The feel of the movie is like you're actually standing in the same room with the cast. They are all excellent actors - their lines were not forced but totally natural. Also the wobbly camera work and the eerie music added to the ambience of the movie. Well done studio guys.
Okay - it's not a blockbuster type movie but it's a MUST for the Robert Patrick collector
Robert Patrick plays Russell Stark, a police detective in league with the Mayor. RP plays baddies so well. My spine tingled and my heart rate went sky high each time I heard that gravely voice, watched him chewing gum and witnessed his confident yet eerie interactions with all whom he associated.
RP fans may be a little disappointed that he is not seen more in this movie as much as they would like. However he's actually in it more than we think. I loved the ending to this movie - wow.  Sorry guys, no more hints.
I have seen this DVD about ten times now and still love it. It's not everyone's first choice thus my rating.

7937154,3,B00005BCJN,"The creepy and cold atmosphere of this film, plus good work by several solid actors almost makes up for the predictability of the plot and the ending.  Dana Ashbrook plays Michael Daniels, a forensic pathologist who has returned to his home town after a long absence, ostensibly to solve the disappearance of his twin brother, Jessie, ten years ago.  Michael insists that Jessie is still alive somewhere, and his return stirs up several of the city's dirty secrets.
There are few surprises.  Viewers will be able to peg who the good and bad guys are right away.  Roy Scheider is appropriately ruthless as the power-hungry mayor positioning himself for re-election, snarling at his underlings when he feels threatened.  Ashbrook, as Michael, looks like a sad fallen angel, poignantly flashing back to happier childhood times with his missing twin.  Robert Patrick provides an excellent performance as police detective Russell Stark, the corrupt mayor's right-hand man.  The best scene of the movie is between Patrick and Scheider.  While others are present, Stark is the epitome of a professional, competent detective on the trail of a murderer.  Once the two are alone, however, Patrick chillingly transforms the character into a menacing psychopath, tauntingly whispering the words of a opera into his former ally's ear.
Even though the ""big"" twist near the end probably will not come as a total surprise to most viewers, the movie is still entertaining and maintains an interesting pace up through its necessary and predictable conclusion.",1014422400,,1541,5.206477732793522
