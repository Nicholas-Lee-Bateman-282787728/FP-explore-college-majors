584200,2,6303161944,"This tape really should have an accurate description of what it offers prospective buyers.  Based on the title I thought I was getting a tape of World Cup competition.  What I got instead was performances by a group of former Olympians who were apparently on tour together.  It is important to note that these skaters are performing on a stage as opposed to a regular ice arena.  This means that they have only a 60 foot by 40 foot space on which to execute their moves.  It is literally a stage, like those on which plays are staged, that has been covered with ice.  Needless to say, the limited amount of space restricts their ability to perform.
In addition to the pared down skating, the filming leaves a lot to be desired.  The cameras, trying for dramatic effect and unusual angles, shift and change focus in the middle of jumps, spins and complex footwork that you naturally want to see.  I found this very irritating.
Finally, the commentary by Tai Babilonia and Randy Gardner (themselves exquisite skaters who should have a lot of insight to offer) was dull, sporadic and awkward.  At one point, for example, Tai has this to say about the skating of a Russian pair: ""What I like about their skating is that it is influenced by ballet.""  Gee, really?  Who would ever have guessed that Russians were influenced by ballet?  Likewise, Randy's comment about Caryn Kadavy's skating does little to help the viewer.  He says simply that she has really improved in the last year, then lapses into a long silence. He doesn't say how or why she has improved, or what distinguishes her skating from that of other top performers.
All of the problems aside,  there is some exquisite skating to be seen.  Peter Barna's Tango piece, Elizabeth Manley's immitation of a cat, skated to music from Cats, and the opening ensemble come to mind.  However, you can forget about the stunning jumps and throws.  There simply isn't room for them on the stage.  Had I known what I was getting, I would never have purchased this tape, and honestly cannot recommend it to others.",1014768000,56,2058,4.669444444444444
584201,4,6303161944,"UFC XXI highlights some up and coming fighters, along with some of the old veterans.  It is not a spectacular tape, but well worth owning and watching for the UFC / Mixed Martial Arts fan.
Some hightlights:
Pat Miletich throws down against wiley Andre Pederneiras
Jeremy Horn puts on a seminar on how to strike from the side mount and full mount: worth it to learn the techniques!
Tim Lajcik and Tsuyoshi Kosaka clash in a very technical and lively fight.
Old veterans Maurice Smith and Marco Ruas are back in the ring: it does us old guys a lot of good to see them back at it, even if they aren't as fast as the young kids.

584203,3,6303161944,"UFC XXI. (Return of the Champions) held it's own, until the ""champions"" fought. Every fight was intense, except the last one. The main event certainly was no Shamrock-Severn II., but was nevertheless a disappointment.
The night kicked off with local favorite Royce Alger against Eugene Jackson. Alger was a former Iowa wrestling all-American, who was back in the octagon anxious to avenge his unsuccessful debut. Jackson on the other hand was making his UFC debut, but was already a veteran of MMA-style fighting. The fight would stay on the feet for the most part and end with a vicious knockout.
Accompanying Eugene Jackson would be his friend Tim Lajcik; making his debut in the octagon. He would use his knowledge of wrestling against veteran Tsuyoshi Kohsaka and his famous ""TK guard"". Lajcik would be the aggressor, while Kohsaka played the patient guard game. The result was rare, but not surprising considering the amount of energy used fighting in MMA fights.
Next up was a classic wrestler vs. jiu-jitsu match up. Veteran Paul Jones, already experienced in other organizations was ready to make his UFC debut against Brazilian jiu-jitsu fighter Flavio Moura. The way this fight ended, l left me surprised and the loser embarrassed.
Since dropping his first two fights in the UFC, Jeremy Horn
rebounded and scored an impressive victory over Chuck Liddell in an earlier show. Now he was back to face Japanese fighter Daiju Takase. The fight was very lop-sided, but exciting.
In his home state, Pat Miletich is a hero. While not to the extent of a Dan Gable, he is very well received. In his home state he would defend his lightweight belt against BJJ fighter Andre Pederneiras. Were we to see another ""scientific"" fight, the answer was no. Miletich knowing of Pederneiras and his ground game would keep the fight on the feet.
The main event would pit Maurice Smith against Marco Ruas. While each are legends in the sport, this fight should have really taken place 5 years ago. Nevertheless, it was an intriguing match up. We had Ruas on one side; a complete fighter with a strong muay-thai background. Then we had Smith a kick boxer, with great all-around skills. The fight was a disappointment, I'll be honest. After the first round the fight was over, that is all I can really say. It remains one of my all-time ""what-if"" fights",999820800,4,2338,4.862155388471178
584204,4,6303161944,"I think the person who said that the Smith-Ruas fight was grueling and hard-hitting just wanted to win the gift certificate for writing the first review.  The Smith-Ruas bout was far and away the most disappointing match of the whole card.  I certainly expected more from Ruas after following his earlier UFC matches...(the beat down on Paul Varleans comes to mind).  Eugene Jackson had an excellent fight vs. Royce Alger, if you like knockouts.  There was quite a lot of blood loss in this event, particularly in Tsuyoshi Kosaka's match vs. Tim Lajcik.  Jeremy Horn looked impressive and much more fit in his bout vs. Daiju Takase.  There were a couple towels thrown in and a couple heavy hits...all in all a fine event.",987638400,4,721,4.774193548387097

The ladies' event was really a blockbuster.  You can see how technically competitive the Ladies are.  In the men's field, the triple axels were flying on both sides of the rink....

Five Seasons Events Center

Cedar Rapids, Iowa

Royce ""The Farmer"" Alger vs. Eugene ""The Wolf"" Jackson:

The UFC is still developing slowly... Before the figt, you can hear John McCarthy ask Royce Alger to remove a ring that he is wearing. Alger is the hometown Iowa boy and Jackson makes his UFC debut. Alger is s decorated amateur wrestler, while Jackson has a pancrase background. Hoping to utilize his wrestling skills, Alger takes this one to the ground in the first and appears to be doing well. He gets the mount and lands a flurry of punches. Jackson gets out and lands a good left. Very good action. After an exhaustive 1st round, this fight goes to the fresher fighter in the 2nd by KO.

Tim Lajcik vs. Tsuyoshi ""TK"" Kohsaka:

Kohsaka's last fight was against Bas Rutten, where he lost in the last minute of a fight he was arguably winning. I'm sure he had redemption on his mind for this fight. He is controlled by Lajcik for almost the entire 1st round. He manages to take control in the last minute of the round and Lajcik's corner thrown in the towel AFTER the round, as Lajcik is ""dizzied"" and out of sorts, stumbling around. This ending was quite anti-climatic, especially for a TK fight.

Flavio Luiz Muora vs. Paul Jones:

Moura is 21 years of age. Jones is 36. This doesn't play any part in how this fight comes off. Moura staggers Jones immediately with a strike, but it's all Jones after that...

Daiju Takase vs. Jeremy Horn:

Horn had just defeated Chuck Liddell in his last fight. He was now back to winning after dropping a few to the UFC elite. Takase makes his UFC debut, from Japan. Horn controls his smaller opponent and this fight is stopped for some mean ground & pound. A good showing for the winner, while the loser is pretty well jacked up afterwards, not rising from the canvas for quite some time.

Pat Miletich vs. Andre Perderneiras:

This fight is for the lightweight title. Miletich keeps the fight standing and is very methodical in his attack. As everyone had said, Miletich is not flashy, but he finds a way to win.

Maurice Smith vs. Marco Ruas:

Smith is coming off of two straight losses: to Couture and Randleman. Ruas hadn't fought in the UFC in over 3 years. I don't think anyone knew what to expect from these two great fighters, now both in their late thirties. Ken Shamrock sits in a a guest commentator for this bout.

Ruas gets the takedown, but he hurts his knee during the round. The fight is halted in-between rounds, when Ruas says he is not able to continue due to the damage to his knee.

Due to the short main event, they show a preliminary bout that had taken place earlier in the evening. Ron Waterman vs. Andre ""Chief"" Roberts:

Waterman (who is in much better physical condition) lands some quick shots on Roberts. He bloodies Roberts and begins hammering away. This one has an exciting ending. Good fight.

This is a decent UFC event. There are a few good fights, with a dud of a main event, but hey, it happens. I would recommend at least checking it out.",1154476800,2,3037,4.500910746812386
