500647,3,6302712017,"Ocean's 11- The remake of the rat pack movie.
Well, here are some of the positive comments on the film:
1.  This movie has an incredible cast: Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, George Clooney, and Julia Roberts
2.  It's directed by Steven Soderbergh, last year's Oscar winner for Best director (Traffic and Erin Brockovich)
3.  It's a remake but the story is completely different this time.  And the tools are advanced and it's more modern
4.  It's a stylish heist movie.
Now the negatives:
1.  It's a heist movie located in Las Vegas.  How many films have we already seen that involoved stealing in Las Vegas.
2.  The story is too shallow: Knock off three banks on the day of a boxing match.
3.  There is nothing revolutionary about the film.  Nothing you haven't seen before.
So over all, this is a film to relax and enjoy.  It won't be a masterpiece or a classic.  It will be remembered as an ordinary heist movie with extraordinary stars.",1006646400,18,944,4.553571428571429

500830,4,6302712017,"Good stuff. Not a fan of how easy it was to steal and keep the pinch. Where was the pursuit? How did they keep it from being caught? For sure, at least, switch the color of the van at least after stealing the pinch. Whatever though; still a good watch. :)",1498953600,,255,4.019607843137255

500832,1,6302712017,After many years it has finally dawned on me why I hate these Ocean's movies.  They insult my intelligence.  Sure they are a fine drama and mindless entertainment but seriously...the cast is filled with Hollywood's top actors.  These are the AAA+ actors.  Top of the line.  Most attractive men in the world.  So these men are going to be cunning thieves and pull off the heist of the century?  I don't think so.  Men this attractive are going to go to Hollywood and become multi-millionaire actors.  In real life four of them put together couldn't or wouldn't change a flat tire.  Nothing about this plot-line is even remotely plausible.,1497916800,3,637,4.761467889908257

500835,5,6302712017,"A charming, naughty, fun, delightful romp.  Bad guys get their comeuppance, good guys overcome impossible obstacles, suspense is sustained, humor is generous, music is great, production, direction, script, all",1497744000,,209,6.206896551724138
500836,5,6302712017,"Original Ocean's Eleven dated back to August 10th of 1960.
This one was released at December 7, 2001. I watched both many times. The last one is awesome.
Its hard to find any imperfection in it.
Ocean's Eleven is the Gold Standard for heist movies genre.

Writers made outstanding work.
History is built around the robbery of three casinos. The jackpot should be more than $ 160,000,000. The film perfectly conveys the spirit of Las Vegas. If you have never been in Las Vegas, NV - this movie is for you. :)

Music is really nice. The compositions are so organically intertwined in the action of the movie that they create an unforgettable feelings.

Steven Soderbergh directed Ocean's Eleven and 2 sequels. The sequels are good too. Yes, its the Oceans trilogy already. Thumb up!!!

There are number of starts - George Clooney,  Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Matt Damon. Actors performed outstanding. It is team work. All of them so nice fitted together, that every scene is perceived naturally.
There are two cameos - heavyweight champions Lennox Lewis and Wladimir Klitschko.

Ocean's Eleven can be watched over and over again.",1497657600,,1590,6.6201923076923075

500860,3,6302712017,"The best part of this movie is the cast....i guess.  Lets take a bunch of big name actors put them in a by the numbers heist movie. Every single one of these actors has been in a thought provoking comedy with more originality than this.  Is it bad....not really i mean the script is too inoffensive and the cast is having too much fun for it to be awful.  What i'm trying to figure out is why I would want to watch it.  If anything I get tired of the squandered potential of these kinds of movies.  If you're gonna toss down this much money in actors  why not hire one less and use the mountain of money to get a compelling script.  If you just really love seeing all these actors regardless of content give it a watch.  But  otherwise don't spend money on this, the cast really doesn't need the money and should have to put forward a better movie than this to earn it.",1496707200,,869,4.155688622754491

501791,4,6302712017,"The first of the Ocean series.  Daniel Ocean (George Clooney) is con man who steals for a living--big heists--and he is just getting out of prison when this movie begins.  He proceeds to plan his next big heist (when did prison ever deter a thief from his 'occupation'?)  and gathers together 10 other guys to help him share in the 160 million dollar take that they steal from a casino in Vegas--but the fun is in the planning and the getting away with the caper that makes this movie what it is--so my hat's off to the writers and directors.  The acting was good, not academy award winning, although the cool confidence of the thieves was enjoyable since we all like to think of ourselves as the 'heroes' in the movie and that we walked away with this kind of money.  An entertaining little flick that is timeless, despite the amount of money would not be as great today as it was then and, too, the outdated clothes and the youthfulness of the actors.  Scott Caan looks so much better now in his TV series.  Brad Pitt looks young.  Matt Damon, too.  And Casey Affleck. Bernie Mac looked good--miss him since he died in 2008.  Andy Garcia was a fox back in the day.  They even stuck Eydie Gorme, Steve Lawrence and Angie Dickenson in it as Boxing spectators.  There  is definitely a full cast of impressive actors.  But, as stated, it wasn't the actors as much as the
cool story line that made this movie.  The sequels were not as good.",1476748800,9,1437,4.431297709923665

502897,4,6302712017,"I love all the Ocean's films (at least the 3 remakes), so I'm probably a bit biased. But they're pure fun, caper-y heist movies. The plots, while fantastical, are thoroughly enjoyable. Just don't think too much about them, as another reviewer pointed out. :)

Watching the banter between George Clooney and Brad Pitt is a real treat, they way they'll finish each others sentences, and make inside references to one another that make you go ""What the hell are they talking about?"" It really makes it feel like those two particular characters go way back, which strengthens the bond and makes the subplot with Tess a little more interesting.

Andy Garcia is great as the steely, unflappable Terry Benedict. You really get the sense of danger they're all facing by engaging in this heist.

The supporting cast is top-notch, watching them interact and mess with each other is another hidden joy within the movie. Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle (uncredited!), Carl Reiner, Eliot Gould, Casey Affleck, all the others - every one of them is perfectly suited for their given role, and they play them to the fullest.

David Holmes' soundtrack is *brilliant*, I hold it up against the likes of John Williams, Danny Elfman, and Hans Zimmer for how perfectly he crafted the musical story to match the action of the film.

If you're looking for a solid hour and a half of a fun (if a bit unrealistic) ride that definitely doesn't take itself too seriously, it doesn't get much better than this.",1472342400,3,1474,4.78740157480315

Ensemble casts can be dizzying to maintain, but not every character in this story needs to solo, leaving the heavy lifting to Clooney, Pitt, and Damon. If you've been to Las Vegas, you will recognize may of the locations, which are set in and around the many on the strip.

504138,5,6302712017,"I have seen the original Ocean Eleven. The appeal there was the old Rat Pack, so the plot was okay in that one and you watch it for the interaction of those favorite stars. In this updated version, the characters and plot are better, witty, and enjoyable to watch. The best interactions are between Clooney and Pitt. (notice Pitt eats through the whole movie !). They leave you the impression that this is a long, tried & true friendship/work relationship, one starts a sentence and the other completes it without talking, perfect timing. These are the best at what they do. Each specialty is a part of the whole. Hand picked by Mr. Ocean (Clooney) to do an impossible job, rob a impossible vault. It's Mission Impossible/ The Sting format, you know it is wrong to seal....but you want these cool dues to pull it off. Great typecasting, with the ""good bad guys"" and the ""mark"" very bad bad guy. Matt Damon is fun to watch trying to do his part. One of Bernie Mac's best parts. So much delight in seeing the great Carl Reiner, and Elliot Gould. Julia Roberts is stunning and plays her role well. So be prepared for having a good time as the gang let's you tag along. Well made movie, enjoy!",1469491200,,1189,4.483870967741935

Lots of ""action"" without even a corrupt Supreme Court to get the borking murderers of an organized crime figure off scott free after being arrested en route to stealing the $7 million of silver he had stashed.

So when you are too busy and can't be there, watch the movie and remember and anticipate your next trip.

504825,5,6302712017,"I have seen this movie multiple times now and have listened to the director's and partial cast commentary.  The character development is great from the very beginning of the movie and the idea of the heist they find themselves pulling off isn't too unbelievable.  Of course, once they start outlining the details of HOW to pull it off, then it gets a little questionable.  Is something like what is outlined in this movie possible.  I doubt it but the movie doesn't make you stretch your mind too far to imagine it happening in a slightly different way.

After listening to the cast commentary it is very apparent that they not only found the script wonderful and the director easy and fun to work with, they also had a great time on set with each other.  I always think this is very important.  If even one actor doesn't like the movie they're doing or the people they are working with, it ruins it for the entire movie.

The other plus for me in this movie is it's lack of special effects and overuse of ""space-age"" technology.  Everything the characters use in the movie exists.  Also, it appears as if the story line and character development were number one on the writers' and director's mind.  Every scene advances the story with nothing thrown in just for filler.",1456963200,7,1271,4.604444444444445

505000,1,6302712017,"The only thing Ocean's Eleven has going for it is a line up of popular actors. If the roles had been given to less famous actors it would have been a box office flop. I found nothing at all in this movie that was even remotely entertaining. The gizmos and devices and situations were cliche. The EMP device was just silly and the script in places even more so. The music was ripped from previous movies of that genera. Try to watch this again and not think of the Pink Panther films. But if they throw in a little Debussy at the end it makes it all classy, and stuff.  Certainly the sets were grand but that is really all this had going for it. It was hardly ""action packed"" but actually dragged in places. Threatening to blow up the money (shades of Goldfinger) is just rot as it would be replaced by the Treasury Department. Certainly the twist about getting into the vault was fun but not believable except for the scene of where they descended the shaft. How exactly was that necessary but to fool the audience? This movie is proof once again that no one will ever go broke by underestimating the intelligence of the public.

505043,5,6302712017,"""Ocean's Eleven"" makes a deal with you. It asks you to promise not to notice the plot holes and inconsequentiality that runs through its labyrinthine narrative. In return, it offers more star-wattage in one sitting than any five other blockbusters combined. For the most part, I'd say, it's a fair trade. For the most part.
The film doesn't live up to this deal in several ways. First, we get some pretty silly casting choices. Matt Damon is a complete waste. Didn't he write ""Good Will Hunting"" to get out of playing underwritten cardboard parts like this? Julia Roberts (She's called Tess, as in Tess Trueheart. You must be joking) is not the least bit sexy, desirable, or tough enough to be caught in a love triangle with two very vital men. Andy Garcia, as one of those vital men, is not as vital as he could have been. Nor is he as menacing a badass as the movie would have you believe. They tried to tell me that anyone caught robbing his Casino would be in for a world of pain. Well, you don't scare me just by telling me. Film is a visual medium. Show me! And Steven Soderbergh, well, he's always been hit or miss in my books. ""Out of Sight"" was enjoyable, and the one film in his oeuvre that would lead you to believe he could direct ""Ocean's Eleven"" capably. But Soderbergh does what he always does: he gets in the way too much. Too much needless visual style, which does nothing to advance the plot, or keep you interested. Why can't you just let your movies breath, Stevie? Oh, and check out the awshucks fountain ending he tacks on. Blech.
I suppose one could read the above bile-filled paragraph and come to the conclusion that I didn't like the movie. Well, you'd be wrong. I liked it a lot. And now I'll tell you why.
It gives us some cool dudes who have serious chemistry together. Bernie Mac is underused, but shines as an Atlantic City dealer/con man finally given a shot at the big score. Don Cheadle has a ridiculous cockneyfied accent, but is entertaining nonetheless. His character, a munitions expert named Basher (natch!), even manages to throw in a bit of rhyming slang. Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould do their best to show the rest of these young whippersnappers how to chew scenery with style. Reiner looks like he should be living out his golden years in Florida, but still has the strength and will to be a vital con man. Gould couldn't look tackier (bushels of gold chains compete with abundant fur for space on his exposed chest), but he chomps on his cigars and delivers his lines with the gusto of a true pro. And there are a couple of other guys in the cast who also deserve a mention. Such as...
Clooney and Pitt. Pitt and Clooney. They're asked to replace Sinatra and Dino from the original ""Ocean's"", and do so with style and cool to spare. George rarely breaks a sweat, relying on his considerable charm (the mega-star's stock in trade) to carry him through the picture. Even in the face of danger, he's always having a good time. Brad is more low-key, the Vladimir to George's Estragon. He begins the film as a bored card sharp, teaching poker techniques to bratty young Hollywood actors (Topher Grace gets mobbed for autographs, while Brad Pitt is left alone to ponder his existence? What a wonderful parallel universe we've stumbled on, here...). But when things get going later on, it's Pitt who leads the way, having more fun than anyone. And they both have such fun wearing a variety of super cool clothes. George even leaves a four-year prison term wearing his tuxedo, tie left dangling around his neck, as if he's just come from a long night of gambling rather than a spell in the clink. Brad is not to be outdone. He has more costume changes than Elizabeth Taylor in ""Cleopatra"". Male vanity, when done right, can be highly entertaining. These two actors, who I've always enjoyed in a variety of other roles (""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", ""Seven"", and ""Fight Club"" come quickly to mind), team up wonderfully here. Neither one steps on the other's shining moments, and when they have to work together, their chemistry is just right. More of Clooney and Pitt (or should it be Pitt and Clooney?) in the future, and I'll be a happy film fan.
You can't possibly go into this film expecting anything more than a glitzy style parade. But as glitzy style parades go, this is one of the best. It's entertaining, and that is the bottom line.",1438300800,,4401,4.558080808080808

505063,5,6302712017,"For some reason, I never tire of seeing this film. It's not an academy-award winner, it doesn't make a statement about the human condition, and it certainly doesn't reference anything remotely truthful about real Vegas casinos. What it does do is simply entertain at a first-rate level for roughly two hours. And it's 100 times better than the original offering from 1960.

In 1960, several of Hollywood's biggest name talent, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop, turned up in Las Vegas to shoot a movie called ""Ocean's Eleven"". They shot the film by day and played the Vegas strip by night. These live acts proved so popular that the group returned to Vegas many times for years after the sets of the film were torn down and the production moved back to Hollywood. The film was about a Vegas heist by some amateur gamblers, but the live act, made up of the legendary ""Rat Pack"", became ever-associated with Vegas. However, the original ""Ocean's Eleven"" does not share the status of the Rat Pack's live offerings of the 1960's. Apparently, while shooting, Frank Sinatra refused to do multiple takes in many scenes as if he was bored with the project, and consequently the final cut of the movie suffered immensely.

Fast-forward 40 years. Stephen Soderbergh, on the heels of ""Traffic"", was given a large budget to remake ""Ocean's Eleven"". The cast is a host of current Hollywood notables, including Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Julia Roberts, and George Clooney as Danny Ocean, the character played by Sinatra. Strangely, the original 1960 production seems like a low-budget bad Vegas show when compared to the 2001 version. Not only is the more recent production much slicker and more finely tuned, the acting and the plot are far more compelling. Sort of like comparing the Flamingo Hotel to the Bellagio or the Venetian Room. There's no comparison.

The plot itself is simple enough: Danny Ocean and eleven brilliant but shady characters attempt to enact a heist on one of the major casinos in Vegas. Add to the stew, Tess, played by Julia Roberts, who was previous Ocean's wife but is now hooked with the casino's head-honcho, Terry Benedict, played with mostly cool detachment by Andy Garcia. This is not akin to robbing the Sands Casino when the strip was made up of these little 6-floor casinos where you could get a room for less than 10 bucks. The new version is like trying to rob the MGM Grand where billions of dollars enter the casino every year. The ultimate outcome is an outstanding textbook example of misdirection that is well worth a DVD purchase. It seems unusual today that there are few productions that are both as well-produced AND well-written. Unfortunately, the subsequent sequels do not measure up nearly as well.",1432771200,,2787,4.875527426160337

505070,4,6302712017,"For years, I had avoided the Ocean's franchise like the cholera morbus.  I'm not a fan of Clooney or Pitt, and the multi-faceted cast ensemble looked too complicated to keep up with.  But then I started learning more about producer Jerry Weintraub.  Any Hollywood mover and shaker who can talk Elvis into touring to revive his career, and on top of that get Sinatra to go on tour has got the cajones for a lot of respect.  So recently I viewed OCEAN'S ELEVEN, a handful of times, on cable.  Not only did I find it entertaining, but clever, insightful, and downright charming.  This conspiracy of misfits to rob over $100 million from a Las Vegas casino--run by an arrogant big shot just begging to get pinged--guarantees a series of cat-eats-canary grins.

George Clooney plays Danny Ocean, an exceptional con man fresh out of jail, who has his eye set on robbing Las Vegas's most extravagant casino, run by a soft-spoken villain (Andy Garcia is fantastic) who also is in a relationship with Danny's ex (Julia Roberts, who adds nada to this film).  He teams up with another con man (Brad Pitt), and together they assemble a group of misfits who will all play a role in pulling off the heist.  (Members of Ocean's ""eleven"" include Matt Damon, Elliot Gould, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Scott Caan, Casey Affleck, and the immortal Carl Reiner.)  The conspiracy is set in motion, and of course there are setbacks and road blocks, yet the group pulls together in effective, albeit dysfunctional, fashion.  The actual heist--and the events leading up to it--is grand fun to watch, and is it ever clever.  The twists and turns are amazing.  Disregard the two mind-numbing sequels; they're lame pizza supreme.  For a witty and fresh portrayal of a multi-layered con, OCEAN'S ELEVEN is as good as it gets.

505145,4,6302712017,"I saw this movie originally on TV and liked it enough to acquire the DVD.  It is basically a heist movie and should be enjoyed as such.  The story is certainly well written and entertaining even though (as one reviewer pointed out) the premise is a little thin.  The dialogue is very entertaining and nearly all the actors do a very good job of playing their parts; the exception being Julia Roberts.  Not a fan of her work and never have been, but her part didn't require all that much anyway.  The heist is (or should be) the main point of the movie, and in that respect it works very well. I would recommend this for anyone who enjoys intricate plots or enjoys character studies.",1405814400,,682,4.424
505146,5,6302712017,Great movie!,1405814400,,12,5.5
505147,1,6302712017,"The story is about a man who desires to loot the vault of a sleazy casino owner, and also to win back his former wife from said owner.  He gathers up a team of various people to make plans to loot said vault, which is actually shared by three different casinos with the same owner, and to do it on ""fight night"" when a boxing match is held in Las Vegas and the vault would be fullest.  Sounds exciting, right?

Except that the movie did everything wrong.  Despite the all-star cast, the acting is utterly terrible.  The villainous casino owner comes across as scary one moment and stupid the next.  Even the actual robbery and getaway is dull and anticlimactic.  Yet this movie inspired several sequels.  God knows why.",1405728000,,719,4.51937984496124
505148,2,6302712017,"Just to get it off my chest up front: with the exception of her work in ""Steel Magnolias"" I've never been able to stand Julia Roberts.  I was grateful her role was almost non-existent.  George Clooney's self-absorbed suaveness bordered on smarmy &, with the exception of Carl Reiner & Don Cheadle, I thought the actors walked thru their performances.

I stand with all the others who find the original a far more engaging production (aside from its dated stereotypes).  There were better character sketches, more interplay between the characters & a more suspense-filled caper.  In the remake they relied on 'shiny things' to compensate for thin writing.  For instance, every component of the preparation for the heist just happened - mostly I suspect because the film had to come in at a sensible running time.  Need a ""pinch"" device (an electromagnetic pulse generator) powerful enough to blank Las Vegas?  (Skip for a moment that this isn't even possible, see ""The Physics of Ocean's Eleven"":  http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200203/oceans-eleven.cfm  )  Roll one out of its facility & into a van.

In the 2 weeks between meeting their money man  (Elliot Gould) & the ""go time"", they acquired a SWAT van as well as the other props for the cons they ran.  And speaking of the other cons, they mentioned several by ""name"", altho never gave any explanations of what they were - altho, to be fair, most of them were pretty self-explanatory as they showed up during the film.

So in addition to the original Rat Pack version of this, let me recommend a couple of caper films not usually mentioned with the classics like ""The Sting"" : 1972's ""The Hot Rock"" (novel by Donald E. Westlake) with a great ensemble cast led by Robert Redford & including Zero Mostel, George Segal, Ron Liebman, Paul Sand, Moses Gunn, etc.  Also a good time can be had with the 1989 HBO movie (available on DVD) ""The Heist"" with Pierce Brosnan, Tom Skerritt, Wendy Hughes & a great supporting cast of character actors that you'll recognize even if you can't place them from their names, including Noble Willingham & Robert Prosky.",1405641600,,2111,4.904225352112676

505172,4,6302712017,"Recently in reviewing George Clooneys Ocean 13 I made the following comment (Yeah, I know I am a little off on the chronology of the series but viewing that one go me back to watching the long gone granddaddy of stick-ups, modern version, unlike the shoot-em-up cowboys and the rat-tit-tat-tat gangster films of the 1930s and 1940s):

Everybody likes to see a bad guy get his comeuppance. Nobody likes to see a guy screw his partner (not in the old days anyway maybe now things are different in the raw dog-eat-dog world). Everybody likes to see a bad guy from Vegas get his comeuppance in duplicate and that is the premise behind Danny Oceans action in this third of the modern Ocean series (the old Frank Sinatra-led pack in the 1960s or so being the classic). Danny (played by George Clooney) and Rusty (played by Brad Pitts) are once again called to right some Vegas wrongs in the film under review, Oceans 13.

And not so strangely since nothing succeeds in Hollywood like success the plot-line for grandpa was just as simple, and similar- Danny Ocean (played by, ah, George Clooney), a beguiling ex-con who had been put always for being in the wrong place at the wrong time had plenty of time in stir to think up the heist to end all heists- the big enchilada- the trifecta-three big hotel casinos all in Vegas (forget that Las Vegas gag by now for we are all honorary citizens having now waded through two of these films).  The take- about 150 million, nothing to sneeze at even today, if things go right and even I am in on this one if that is the pay-out. All owned by a bad guy, Terry (played by Andy Garcia), the guy who stole Dannys wife away (played by Julia Roberts) while he was in stir, and who has many enemies, many guys glad to take him down about seven steps, maybe more.

Danny and the guys go about their business of doing this deed using all the high tech skills available to the motley crew of expert do-gooders. See, what they do is draw all the resources from the top to bottom by hook or by crook, including a raid on a a campus power source, to grab the money. And they would have made as the old master burglary Willie Sutton proud. So between the individual hi-jinx necessary to pull the plot off and Dannys thoughtful plan to gain revenge Brother Terry has egg on his face, no question. Danny though just keeps trucking on in the sultry Vegas night (with that fickle leggy ex-wife so who needs dough). Yes, as easy as these guys made it look I am in if they ever need a guy when they  make an Oceans 14.",1397260800,,2534,4.382978723404255

505194,4,6302712017,"Back in the day when I was involved in community and school musical theater one director insisted on casting as many kids as  could could fit on the stage even if they could not sing or dance ,,even if it was only for one scene. I asked why, I mean they are a handful and take a crew of nanny types to keep them occupied whenever off stage (which was 90% of the production). ""Its simple"", he said, "" every one of these urchins have family...parents, grandparents, cousins, aunts, uncles, family friends...and every one in their extended family will buy a ticket to see their ""star"" on stage...most of them will be here for every performance. Our job is to keep these kids healthy and in costume for their scene. If we do that we will always have a sold out house.""  He was right, absolutely right.
When you pack a large number of stars on the screen at the same time you bring with them all their separate fan base. Add to that the ""what ifs"" ..what if Clooney and Roberts did a picture together?..what if Brad and Julia did a movie together?..and on and on and you get a star tour that brings in the audience.
Even though a remake of a film that was done well the first time, Oceans Eleven 2001 is well written, well crafted and well acted. The scenes between Pitt and Clooney alone are worth the ticket. With the reputation of off screen pranking these two have, the sense of inside jokes and hidden references fairly drip from the dialog between their characters.
The original Oceans 11 had that Rat Pack ""cool factor"" working and the 2001 version features the Rat Pack of todays Hollywood.
Kudos to Brad Pitt for another well crafted character. Considering the pretty boy roles he began his career with he has consistently worked to make his characters less pretty but far more interesting to watch, (12 Monkeys, Se7ven (sp), Fight Club and now The Counselor to name a scant few) His character in Oceans 11 2001 is just another example of his good work)
With all the sequential franchise releases of the new Oceans series I still prefer the 11.  Its repurposed, recrafted and contemporary even now, a decade and more after its release.",1394064000,,2139,4.536269430051814

The remake with Clooney, Pitt and company had a much better plot - making something at face value highly unbelievable seem like ""ok I buy that"". The cast has such a good time they get you caught in the fun. Speaking of the case - this movie has so many really good actors in the cast - they are a joy to watch.

This is a movie I watch every time it comes on cable - even when they play it 30 times that week. It like a comfortable pair of jeans or shoes.

Clooney plays Daniel Ocean, ex-con who plans on robbing three casinos. He gathers his crew and plan the impossible. Later we find out his ex-wife (Julia Roberts) is the girlfriend of the owner of said casinos.

The coolest male stars of the time, plus Julia Roberts, performing an elaborate caper in America's fun capital, Las Vegas.  The casinos and the cars and the caper itself are all different, as befits the change in time and technology, but the two main differences from the earlier film are that nobody sings, and the ending is happier, if not quite as amusing.  I watched the Clooney and company version in a theater when it first came out, and not since until I watched this DVD on Amazon Prime Instant Video the other night, and I was surprised how fresh and new it all seemed to me.

still no lossless audio option. decent, however. i was surprised about how much LFE output there was (not much, but present). audio was still clear but with a better remastering, could sound more dynamic.

Danny Ocean (George Clooney) has been just paroled and he has a plan, but he needs a crew, to pull off one of the biggest heists ever done.  He plans to steal $150 million from the high security vault that holds the money for three of Las Vegas' largest casinos.  His key partner is Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) and they meet up with a former casino owner Rueben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould) to bounce the plan off of him and get him to help finance it.  They recruit eight specialists to pull off the heist and they are all the best in what they do.  They are con men, mechanics, explosives expert, acrobat, an electronics expert and a pick pocket.  They all know each other and they begin the planning stage of the robbery.

They are all in it for the money but Danny Ocean has revenge on his mind.  His beautiful ex-wife Tess (Julia Robert) is the casino owner, Terry Benedict's (Andy Garcia) girlfriend.  Rueben also has no love loss for the Benedict and anything that hurts him would make Rueben happy.....

This is a funny and high action movie with top notch stars that just make the story better.  With all of the great acting personalities in the movie the interaction is just interesting to watch.

I may have been mislead as to the description of the product.  I bought this movie 'used' and its condition was prescribed as 'good.'  I figured that since it was labeled as 'good' then the viewing quality would be good.  However, there were multiple scenes that would not play due to the extremely scratched nature of the disc.  At least three of the scenes in the movie were impossible to watch and when reached during the flow of the film, the screen would pause.  I could not change scenes or fast forward from this point.  The movie stopped completely and ceased to run.

I still made it through the movie by reaching these scratched scenes, stopping completely, then skipping that scene and choosing a previous one in the scene selection part of the main menu.

The theatrical release was very grainy, had inconsistent color and orange skin tones throughout. So it's no surprise (to me at least) that Steven Soderbergh preserved his experimental look for this blu-ray. The blu-ray is actually a considerable improvement over the theatrical release. Here the picture is sharper and the grain is less present. With that said, some picture artifacts can be seen. Overall it's a great movie with a nice transfer that Soderbergh intentionally wanted to stand out among the pack.",1339632000,,659,5.346153846153846
505792,4,6302712017,"My movie for last night came out of our archives. Apparently my wife bought ""Ocean's Eleven,"" together with 12 and 13 and stacked them away for future viewing. Okay, I tried out 11. It was  an interesting and entertaining movie. The photography was excellent as was the sound. The acting was good. It was interesting to see Las Vegas on a close-up scale. All in all, it was a worthwhile movie.

The movie involved the principle character (George Clooney) getting out of prison and immediately starting an elaborate plan to rob a major Las Vegas Casino of it's treasure, which ultimately involved about 80 million dollars. His last name was Ocean and the plan involved 11 people. Okay? Well, it was one of those totally implausible Hollywood constructions that reminded me of the old tongue-in-cheek ""Mission Impossible"" TV shows. Everything had to work in a precise and elaborate way, and of course, it did. It was well done, however implausible, and fun to watch and required no deep thinking. Here and there were bits of light humor. The plot was intricate enough and moved at a rapid enough pace that boredom didn't set in, despite the lightweight  character of the movie. It was good, easy-going entertainment and might have been even better with the Mission Impossible music..

505816,3,6302712017,"George Clooney, Brad Pitt and dozens of their elite Hollywood buddies get together to remake and rejuvenate this rat pack classic from forty years prior. The end result is a slick, mildly overproduced adventure that's smart and suave, though not quite so much as it seems to think it is. Much of the movie is blown on excessive, ""look what we can afford to do"" antics that are, admittedly, fun to watch but ultimately do little to endear the cast to their audience. Rather than a case of pillaging the rich to fill the coffers of the poor and desperate, this first installment of the Ocean's franchise feels more like a case of the filthy rich reaching into the cookie jars of the filthier. The heist genre loses a bit of its inherent suspense when a film's protagonists have access to a garage full of police paraphernalia, server racks spilling over with imaginary ""future tech"" computer equipment, Italian sports cars, cushy upper deck hotel rooms and access to all the blueprints they'll ever need. Clooney's charisma does buy him a degree of invulnerability to this phenomenon, which makes him an ideal centerpiece, but after the first viewing most of the team's close calls seem far too easily resolved. With these resources, Beavis & Butt-Head could have a pretty good shot at making off with a casino's millions. Good for a few action spots, at least.",1327190400,2,1359,4.787234042553192

505821,3,6302712017,This film died from a happy ending. It wanted to be another version of The Sting so hard then it decided that it wanted to be a romance. You can't have it both ways. Tess would have put a bullet into both men. It started to lose credibility when she spots one of Danny's cohorts talking with her husband over the phone. She has just made it clear that she doesn't want any part of Danny in a prior scene! So rather than advise her husband she just keeps quiet. Ow that was great love. She retreats into her apartment until a cohort of Danny directs her to a particular channel and watch Danny show her what a poor choice she made with the other guy. So if she was wrong about him then she was wrong about Danny!! The writing is genuinely stupid. Still what can you expect from a cash cow? Its only purpose was putting money in everybody's pockets and if a happy ending was part of the formula then we will get it. That's too bad. It could have been a better film with Tess or without her.

A complicated security set up but nothing impregnable because impregnable is not in Hollywood's dictionary. A whole set of gangsters led by Brad, Matt and George, and enjoying themselves very much. Of course they succeed with a little bit of high tech. And they stage the whole thing for the casino entrepreneur who falls in the trap of what he sees on his video cameras and on his surveillance screens and then he finds out he has been tricked and that the bill of the trick is something around 163 million dollars, maybe less, maybe more, who knows, but sure more than the trick his female, or male, employees are selling to the hotel and casino customers. It is apparently easy to lure this business gangster or this gangster businessman: flatter his vain and arrogant ego by flattering his security because he believes he has the best security in the world, and then you can go through. Apart from that tricky complicated situation, the film is very simple, if not ordinary. But after all it is only a matrix: it has to remain simple to breed good sequels, and this one bred two sequels. Good entertainment, for the actors too I guess.

505917,4,6302712017,"Slick, cool, stylish. Danny Ocean is going to rob three casinos in one night, all of which are owned by the same man. To do this he's gonna need a team, a team of the most lighthearted criminals on the planet. They'll need wits, they'll need brains, and they'll need a heck of allota character developement.

From director Steven soderbergh comes an extremely fun, if not rather confusing story about a bank heist, the likes of which you will prbably never see again.

For the sake of being honest and fair I think I'll start on the negative note. This film is sprinkled with some small problems, the largest of which is that the viewer has to stretch their mind like laffy taffy in order to understand the endings twist. The reason this flaw does not ruin the movie is because it doesn't really change the outcome, fortunately for anybody who doesn't want to hurt their minds just to understand the film.
One of the smaller flaws of the film is that it often relies on face-recognition in order to understand what is currently going on. A viewer might have t ask somebody ""who is that again?"" to understand a specific scene. All the negative parts of this movie revolve around lack of clarity, though this does not, in anyway ruin the movie, or make it completely incomprehensible.

Now for the good stuff. ""Oceans 11"" is filled to the brim with laughs, good acting, taste, style and.., well Vegas. The film dazzles the screen with lights, enough flash to catch the eye, enough class to stay cool.
I must particularly congratulate George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia and Don Cheadle for their contribution to the movies characters, bringing them to life, each with their own distinction. The casting for the film was amazing, all the way down to the small roles. Each character was memorable, and fun to remember, full of personality, but also well developed, so the audience can feel a connection with them.

Overall I would say ""Oceans is very much worth a watch, definitely a good movie (and series) to watch in the summer, at the beach maybe.

Maybe even playing some cards....... maybe.

505919,3,6302712017,"I will admit that the casting here is delicious (that applies, right?) and so my appetite was wet and my interest was peaked long before sitting in the theater.  George Clooney, at the time, was one of my favorite actors (he's suffered from overexposure for me; 2005 did it for me) and you can't deny the charm and appeal of actors like Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and the undeniably brilliant Julia Roberts.  Add to the mix funnyman Bernie Mac as well as brilliant actors like Andy Garcia and Don Cheadle, not to mention a slew of young actors like Casey Affleck (who would have ever thought he'd rise from this to become `Robert Ford'), Topher Grace and James Caan's son Scott and you have yourself guaranteed success; right?

I would think you, so sadly there is just something about this movie that doesn't work.  I think the main issue is that when all is said and done `Ocean's Eleven' is just not that memorable.  Sure, the cast is great and everyone does a superb job.  Sure, the plot is decent and the dialog and funny, but in the end it all just kind of rests there, never `popping' so-to-speak.  I just expected to be wowed and I truly wasn't.

It was kind of dull.

The plot revolves around Danny Ocean, recently released from prison, who bands together with his ten partners in crime to knock off three successful Las Vegas casinos.  Sure, the money is a huge bonus, but the real reason for the caper is to win back Ocean's ex-wife Tess who is now attached to the owner of these casinos, Terry Benedict.  Benedict is not only money hungry but he's ruthless and thus it makes the job all the more difficult for Ocean and his crew.

Director Steven Soderbergh is good at extracting wonderful performances from his cast (just look at the effortlessness that permeated the sets of `Traffic' and `Erin Brockovich') and here is no different.  George Clooney is his charming, natural self (I much prefer this side of him to his over praised dramatic work) and Brad Pitt is actually quite funny.  Julia Roberts is really the heart and soul of this film though.  From the minute she walks on the screen the film turns on its head.  But even she can't save it from mediocrity.  The film as a whole just doesn't do anything special, it doesn't become anything memorable.  In the end it is nothing more than a decent buddy flick with some laughs.  It's not a movie you can really enjoy multiple times, which is sad to say since the cast alone should have guaranteed the films longevity.

I have yet to see the two sequels, yet I hear this is the best of the three so it's not a good sign.  A lot of people enjoyed this movie, but it appears after reading many of the reviews that they feel as I do.  Sure, this film has its moments and it is in no way shape or form a bad movie.

The story involves Daniel getting out of jail, hiring his crew, setting up the robbery, executing the robbery, and I won't tell you the rest.

""Ocean's Eleven"" is almost a runway for it's all-star male ensemble cast.

George Clooney and Brad Pitt lead a very likable and humorous crew on a what's perceived as an impossible heist from a Las Vegas casino have security which on a par with Fort Knox. The team assembled is certainly shady given their tarnished backgrounds (accomplished via impressive flashback clips and clever montage sequences which are informative as they are entertaining) and couldn't have less in common personality-wise yet collectively gel into a well-oiled machine which convince you their mission could actually be attainable. Even with the given skeletons present in their respective pasts you still find yourself rooting for these 'bad' guys. Andy Garcia is great as the stooge and ultimate fall guy who gets a deserved comeupance and the added tension of Clooney's team attempting to pull off the caper with unexpected hurdles makes the confusion and chaos a more than welcomed plot entanglement. Great shots of Vegas throughout - especially the night sequences - and Julia Roberts is very graceful as the independent gal caught in between two demanding men.,1197158400,,1189,5.329787234042553

Anyone who goes to a casino will feel, ""wait!! that wouldn't happen that way!"" It's difficult to sit through because it doesn't satisfy some basic requirments of reality of casino security, even from someone who isn't involved with security. The premis of planning a big heist basing a major part of the plan on seducing a wench of a general manager with some pheromones and hoping she will bring this newly met man to the high security area where the diamonds are kept and turn off the security system so she can make love to him is a far fetched plan. You'd think they would have shown that they researched her prior love life and came up with her ideal guy or something remotely believable. Not that he just puts on some pheromones and hopes that she becomes so intoxicated that she brings him to the most secure room in the casino because there are no more vacancies at the casino hotel and he doesn't want to make love in his room. I would have thought that she would have brought him to her office, since she is the general manager. These sort of problems plague the movie.

The casting is brilliant: Cheedle is always fun, as is Matt Damon, but the real stars are Elliot Gould, who manages to play his signature role, the shlump, to perfection, and Carl Reiner, who is, in my opinion, the last survivor of the greatest generation of comic geniuses. Reiner has more talent in his pinkie than most actors today. It's all in the timing, no profanity, fabulous facial gestures. His son pulled a great deal of attention away from the grand master himself; it is good to see him again. The entire enterprise works, because the dialog is clever, the story engaging, and the location fits the plot to perfection. Is it a great film?

Other than being a parade of Hollywood's hunkiest.  Ocean Eleven has a good, solid story.  Danny Ocean fresh out of the joint can't take being on the straight and narrow, plus he wants his wife back.  Lucky for him and his gang-she just so happens to be dating a powerfully rich casino owner. Instead of taking his anger and frustration out of her, he figures the way to win her back is to rob her boyfriend and prove to her that the casino owner would choose his money over her.  Is this even a question?  We're not talking about $20.  Daniel was trying to steal 163 million dollars.  Not to betray my sex, but no woman is worth that amount of money.  And it's an unfair question because Daniel would most likely choose the money too.  Because by his own question, he could have given it back and simply taken Tess.  But that minor fact seems to escape Tess and she goes running back to her hubby.  Other than, this is a slick sort of hustle from a team that should be in the circus.

505939,5,6302712017,"Once Upon A Thyme, children, there was a movie called ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring."" It was a movie based on a 50 year-old book of the same name, which had 2 sequels. Those 2 books were also made into movies, and those 3 movies were very very very good, and all was right with the world.

THEN ... The Powers That Bee decided that because those 3 movies were so very good (and so very profitable) then ALL successful movies must now come in threes: and lo and behold we had 3 XMens, 3 Spidermans, 3 Austin Powers, 3 Pirates, and of course 3 Oceans. Never mind the fact that the ""Rings"" movies came in a trilogy because the original novels came that way. None of these sequels had any reason for being, other than the first movie made a lot of money. And in every single case, the third movie was the worst of the bunch, the inspiration and steam that made the first movie a success long, long gone.

This is an olde, olde story children. Witness 4 Jaws, 3 Rambos, 6 Rockys, 742 Bonds, 3 (and counting) Indiana Jones, ad infinitum. We can even go back 70 years to 6 Thin Mans, the last 3 of which weren't so great. But no matter. Don't expect H'wood to learn from the dearth of joy in their sequels, because we keep lapping them up.

Nevertheless, there is always the FIRST of all of these movies to return to, and that is what we must do when all is said and spent. Go back to the original (well, the remake of the original, anyway) and remember a time not so long ago when charisma had a name, and its name was ""Ocean's Eleven.""

But OCEAN'S ELEVEN is fun, fun, fun--and Hollywood is short on that, too, these days.

There's another thing that makes this movie both good and rare: an ensemble cast. Really, friends and neighbors, how often do you get this caliber of a cast in a modern movie: Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia, and yes, Bernie Mac? Good gravey, I haven't seen the likes since THE LONGEST DAY. And they all play their parts unselfishly (except, perhaps, for Clooney--but he's the star).

When I first saw this film I was blinded by the star power and ended up purchasing the DVD, but upon watching it again, shortly after buying it, I realized something.  I don't really like this movie.  It bores me a bit and doesn't leave a lasting impression.  In fact, I have no desire to see `Oceans Twelve' or the upcoming `Oceans Thirteen' although I will most likely end up seeing them some day.  The plot could have served up a great movie, but so many areas of this film run dry.  It's hard to explain really because nothing seems to be wrong with it.  Great cast, decent script, good plot...it should be wonderful but something...I can't place it...but something is horribly wrong!",1167350400,2,892,4.462962962962963
506015,4,6302712017,"I enjoyed this movie.  It started with an interesting premise, a guy by the name of Danny Ocean gets out of prison with a plan to rob 3 casinos in Las Vegas.  Instead over worrying too much about parole, he immediately begins assembling his crew of eleven people to do the job.  Brad Pitt as Rusty Ryan, his second in command, Matt Damon as the pickpocket to get the codes from the casino boss, Carl Reiner as the high roller to help get some tools into the vault, Don Cheadle as the explosives expert to knock out the power briefly, a Chinese acrobat/contortionist to get smuggled into the vault in a cash cannister, Bernie Mac as the Blackjack dealer on the inside, a technical guy and couple of drivers round out the team.

The target:  The vault at the Belaggio which is also shared by the Mirage and the MGM Grand, all owned by the same man Terry Benedict played by Andy Garcia.

The twist:  Casino Boss Benedict's girlfriend is none other than Tess Ocean, Danny's ex-wife played by Julia Roberts.

All in all, this was an entertaining, fast-paced movie expertly put together by director Steven Soderbergh.  The editing of this movie was absolutely excellent.  From the beginning scene of Danny Ocean in front of his parole board to the scene on the train where he's watching Matt Damon's character in action, to the complicated scenes of the heist itself, the editing really makes his movie.  They did an outstanding job of making a picture worth a thousand words.  A perfect example is the scene where they are blowing up the old casino to make room for a new Benedict mega-casino and the entire crowd except for Danny Ocean turns around to watch the building come down.  Ocean's eyes stay fixed on the stage where his ex-wife stands next to Terry Benedict as he depresses the plunger to start the explosion.  In that instant, you know that Ocean is motivated more by his ex-wife than anything else including the money.  And they told you all that in a flash of a  scene, just amazing.

But the editing has to be first rate in a movie like this.  You have to be able to see things unfold, especially in a scheme as complex as this.  And they do a fantastic job of it in this movie, I had no trouble keeping up with what was going on.  And was just as fooled in the end as Benedict and his men were.  Just great!

On to the acting, which is where I thought the movie was a little deficient.  Where the movie stumbles is in it's overabundance of camera hogs.  There's just too much star power and not enough feet of film to satisfy them all.  Clooney, Pitt, Damon and Bernie Mac end up battling each other into mediocrity in their scenes.  Cheadle is downright irritating, and a piece of furniture would have brought more to the role of Tess Ocean than Julia Roberts did. The rest of the team is totally faceless, they could have been played by anyone.  The two actors that really stand out are Andy Garcia as Terry Benedict, the casino owner and Carl Reiner as the aging con man Saul.  Garcia's portrayal of the casino boss is chillingly perfect, the ever gracious host with just the right hint of a threat of violence below the surface if you don't play by the rules.  And Carl Reiner is totally cool playing a character within a character and pulls off Lerner Zerga, the wealthy east European arms dealer with aplomb.

My only other gripe about the movie is the stupid plot idea of the ""pinch"" something that supposedly simulates the elctro-magnetic pulse of a nuclear bomb.  First of all, there is no such thing, certainly not one you could load into the back of a van.  Secondly if there was such a thing, you couldn't steal it. And thirdly if you did set it off in a large city like Las Vegas, the power wouldn't come back on after two minutes, it would take more like five years to completely rewire the city.  But the ""pinch"" is a typically lazy Hollywood plot device that gets around the problem of howintheheck are these guys going to cut out all power, even emergency power, to the heavily protected and secured vault for two minutes.

If you can ignore that and some of the sub-par acting, this is a great movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and I'll have to check out both the original and the sequel sometime soon.",1161475200,,4229,4.469361147327249
506016,3,6302712017,"""Ocean's Eleven"" is only an average movie. It hardly excels in either the Frank Sinatra version, or in this remake, the George Clooney version.

The story: Can Danny Ocean bring together a hodge-podge of characters to pull off a great heist in Las Vegas? The rest, like seen in later movies like ""The Dirty Dozen,"" involves the preparation of the attempt, with a dramatic crescendo as they attempt the impossible.

As a collection of stars goes, ""Ocean's Eleven"" is second only to the Academy Awards in bringing together the best known faces in Hollywood. However, the screen is too crowded to give each their due. Their personalities aren't exposed as much, and rely on quips and face shots to get the point across that the movie is supposed to be cool. As a result, it isn't as cool.

What is the difference? Why is the original better than the remake? Sammy Davis, Jr. could be one reason. He had it all, like Frank, plus he could dance. Dean Martin is another reason. These guys were all multitalented stars, where as in this version, all we have are pretty boys with a modicum of acting ability.

Don Cheadle is loaded with talent - just see ""Hotel Rwanda"", and all of that is wasted here. Brad Pitt is basically a less masculine Matt Damon. There is not enough distinction, and neither has a chance to stretch their skills that made them stand out in the first place. This is not ""Meet Joe Black,"" or ""Good Will Hunting.""

The movie is entertaining, but not because they go for the biggest game or a strong cast fills the ranks. It is tightly directed and edited, with great production. Everything looks perfect, and they take an average story and milk it well.

506017,4,6302712017,"I really liked this movie.  It was done stylish, but not over the top.  George Clooney was really good in this.  I loved how it ended :) and wish they would've left it at that. cuz '...twelve' was a snoozer.",1151712000,,207,4.125
506018,2,6302712017,"This film is a perfect example of how straight action and big-name stars cannot replace the necessity of well written drama.

I will not give away the plot -- although that is admittedly hard to do since there is so little of it. Basically Clooney's character Mr. Ocean, a career burgler, is released from prison with a plan to rob the vault of a Las Vegas casino. So he recruits 11 men, each with a talent to add to the operation. This is where the trouble begins. The viewer is given no reason at all why he should sympathize with any of these characters. There is almost no introduction to many of them, and barely even a mention of their names. Literally half an hour into the film ""the eleven"" are assembled and they're already robbing the casino. How's that for plot development? And that's basically it ladies and gentlemen: go to Vegas, rob casino, go home, movie over. Some of the ""good guys"" are even outright repellant. Our would-be heros' enterprise is bankrolled by some greasy Hollywood tycoon. Am I supposed to like this fat weasel?

The only reason we are given to sympathize at all with at least Mr. Ocean, is that the guy he's robbing, the casion owner, is a really bad guy. Supposedly he has people killed 'n stuff. (This actor played a bad guy in Godfather Part 3). But we never see any real evil deeds. In fact, he just seems like a handsome, polite, very prosperous businessman. He manages to raise his voice for just one line in the entire film. Mr. Ocean on the other hand, and his cohorts, are career criminals. But the guy they're robbing is an even greater criminal, you see. So that makes it OK. And really, if you were being robbed, wouldn't you want to be robbed by George Clooney and Brad Pitt? They're such nice guys. That makes getting robbed fun. Just a couple of nice guys stealing from another nice guy. How thrilling.

This entire film is a rushed series of action sequences punctuated by a few soap opera moments with Julia Roberts. There are a few minor things going on in the backgroung, like a boxing match, which are essentially irrelevent. Throughout there seems to be vital information missing (like say, a plot). Soderbergh simply did a terrible job of making me care what happens to Clooney and Roberts.

This film is also horribly cut. Several times what seemed like vital plot details were intoduced, and then completely forgotten about. Take the scene where Pitt and a buddy are casing out the joint and the casino's owner makes an appearence. The folder he has just been handed, explains Pitt, contains secret security codes. You would think that would be something important right? You would think they will need to get those codes. Well, wrong. In fact you won't hear or see a single thing more about them for the rest of the movie. They introduce what seems to be an important detail and then totally abandon it without any development. And that happens all the time in this movie.

In fact Mr. Ocean's team gets down the secure elevator shaft and into the vault with only minor difficulties. (And boy, they started repelling down that shaft quick, didn't they? You didn't even know they were robbing the place yet. Wow, these guys are good. Or maybe Steven Soderbergh is as over-rated as his film.) They make it look easier than breaking into the safe at 7-eleven. This, after Mr. Ocean briefed his crew at the beginning on the nearly impregnable security measures the vault was supposed to have.

One would hope this film would at least end strong. But Soderburgh makes the final scene open ended in such a way as to leave the audience confused and disappointed. We are left wondering whether the ""eleven"" actually got away with their caper...or worse. What a way to completely overturn the mood of a movie that at least had the merit of being light-hearted. The writer of the screenplay even said as much in the audio commentary to the DVD! (As did the actors in their commentary.)Probably the best moment on this DVD is hearing the screenwriter tell Soderbergh to his face that he screwed up the ending.

I am loath to give either 1 or 5 stars, since hardly anything is absolutely good or bad, but this film comes very close to 1 star. This is your standard artistically worthless Hollywood product. It is big on budget, big on bling, and low on story. I suppose if you just feel like wasting some time, this is as good a way to do it as any. Personally I would rather have a story with more substance.",1150243200,2,4459,4.5732165206508135
506019,4,6302712017,"I usually don't like remakes but this one is great! My family and I watched both the original and the new version and agreed that this will become part of our collection.

506021,4,6302712017,"One's attention is immediately drawn to this movie for its many famous stars such as George Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts. It is a bit odd storyline from the beginning that Daniel Ocean, played by George Clooney, risked robbing the casino for love and revenge. However, I liked how they planned the whole thing out carefully and how the movie proceeded speedy. I liked the part when Rusty, played by Brad Pitt, calls Terry Benedict, played by Andy Garcia, and tells him that they are robbing his casino. And yet, Benedict wasn't able to get anything, neither the money nor his woman. Also, I liked how it let Tess, played by Julia Roberts, know Benedict preferred money to her. I thought it would have been better if the casino heist weren't so perfectly planned and that there were some critical moments or tensions. Though I now know there is a sequel of this movie, ""Ocean's Twelve"", when I first watched this movie I predicted that there would be another one. Because at the end two of Benedict's staffs follow where Ocean and Rusty were going. All-in-all this was a hilarious and well-acted movie overall.",1148860800,,1130,4.741116751269035
506022,5,6302712017,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie when it first came out back in 2001, despite some excruciating emotional turbulence that I was going through at the time. That I was able to enjoy the movie through a cloud of depression was surprise enough but I was even more surprised - pleasantly so as well - to find I enjoyed it even more a second time, when it was screened on cable TV a while back. That's when I decided to get it on DVD and after watching it a third time I can honestly say I look forward to watching it again sometime. It's a welcome addition to my collection.

Most folk know the story by now. George Clooney and his A-list buddies have a blast in the Las Vegas sun, in a slick caper directed by Steven Soderbergh. A loose remake of the 1960 Rat Pack venture of the same name, Clooney comfortably (and ably) steps into Frank Sinatra's shoes as Danny Ocean. Ocean is fresh out of jail but this doesn't seem to cool his enthusiasm for putting together an audacious heist with the help of a ten-man crew. His star cronies include Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Don Cheadle. Much has been said about Cheadle's cockney accent and in my opinion, those (mostly UK journalists) who have described it as ""appalling"", ""awful"" or ""the worst you've ever heard"" are just miffed that an American was able to carry it off. Or that a British actor wasn't chosen to do it. Maybe they're upset about both things. All I can say is that he sounded like a true cockney to me and I lived in East London for many years. Kudos to him.

Anyway, the plan is to hit the vault containing the take from three of the biggest casinos in Vegas, all of which belong to tycoon Terry Benedict played by a suave Andy Garcia and he just happens to be dating Ocean's ex-wife, played by Julia Roberts. It all kicks off from there. Amazingly, and thankfully, the mechanics of the heist (not to mention the implausibilty of its success) take second place to the glorious interplay of a stellar cast that is clearly having lots of fun revelling in the sharp, quick fire dialogue and the neat paced action. A first rate movie worth watching again and again.

Apart from the DVD extras mentioned, mine also had one interesting feature that will be a must for the fashionistas: Called ""The Look of the Con"", it explores how the costumes were designed for each of the stars. Yummy.",1148169600,3,2339,4.434883720930233
506023,4,6302712017,"Ocean's Eleven is a fun heist movie blessed with an A-list cast who defines cool in our current generation of actors, a funny, intricate (kinda convoluted) script and a director who knew what he was doing and was having a blast doing it. This is a remake of the pretty dull 1960s Las Vegas heist movie of the same title starring Frank Sinatra and the rest of the Rat Pack. I've seen both films and I must say that this is one of those rare exceptions where the remake improves on the original.

Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is an ex-con newly released from prison who immediately jumps back into the shady life. He already has a larcenous scheme in mind and enlists his old right-hand man Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) to help him recruit a thieving crew. Oh and what a crew: Matt Damon as the rookie, quick-fingered and well versed in pickpocketing; Bernie Mac as the inside man; Don Cheadle, the explosives expert, comes armed with a great Cockney accent and that weird Cockney way of rhyming (""We're in Barney""; Clooney makes a nonplussed gesture; ""Barney Rubble - Trouble!""); old-school Carl Reiner plays the old con-man out for a last con; Casey Affleck is the nerdy computer/surveillance technoman; etc. Ocean and company target the super-protected vault underneath the Bellagio casino. This vault stores money for three casinos: the Bellagio itself, as well as the MGM Grand and the Mirage. Apparently, on weekend nights of big boxing events, the vault by law has to house at least $150 million to cover all bets. The man who owns the Bellagio is Terry Benedict (played with smooth, reptilian menace by Andy Garcia), who is also the current love of Ocean's ex Tess (a radiant Julia Roberts). Hmmm, you start to think.

Ocean's motivations are not the only thing that'll keep the viewer guessing in this funny, fast-paced, twisty film. The director Steven Soderbergh skillfully plays fast and loose with flashbacks, dizzying, continuing pan shots and sleight-of-hand camerawork. There is plenty of false jeopardy played out in the course of this movie, numerous plot reversals. Don't take anything for granted until the end credits come up.

Steven Soderbergh directs this remake with such a light touch that it seems as if all he's done is throw all these high-profiled megastars in the same room and direct them, with perhaps a nonchalant wave of a hand, to simply wing it. The performers deliver their lines convincingly and with panache. They are, after all, all damn good actors (check out the dvd actor commentary with Damon, Pitt and Garcia, who have a chuckle over the talented serious actor Don Cheadle, who delivers his lines while covered in poo). I had a sense that everyone involved genuinely liked each other and had a great time bouncing off each other in their scenes. Clooney and Pitt, in particular, seem to have great buddy rapport together, whilst romantically, Clooney and Roberts sizzle. Andy Garcia is a great villain, suave yet intense, worthy of going up against eleven crafty adversaries. Soderbergh does a masterful juggling act in this one: ensuring that everyone in the film gets his/her day to shine, managing to stage every scene so that every shot is interesting and keeping the topsy-turvy plot on point. Kudos, too, to the music, which works to great effect and greatly influences the mood of every stage of the film (I thought actually purchased the soundtrack). Great job by everyone involved. A four star effort.",1146614400,,3448,4.890598290598291

1) You are supposed to like the charachters/bad guys. Any movie that has you rooting for the casino and against the criminals is bad.

2) Why does anybody think that Julia Roberts can act? Another horrible performance. Sadly, it's not the worst one in the movie. Matt Damon phones in his lines. George Clooney looks bored.

3) There are holes in the plot that you can drive a truck through. For example the Bellagio and Mirage banks are somehow connected. Someone forgot to mention that Ceasars Palace is between these two properties. Doesn't anybody do location scouting in these movies.",1145232000,4,727,4.708661417322834

In addition to the character development, you can tell that the actors really had fun doing this movie and everyone just about had an equal part regardless of the main cast members. What really impressed me was how well Daniel Ocean's team had to work in attempt to pull off a near impossible heist. If you are looking for a film that offers a good thrill, Ocean's 11 is definately worth viewing and worth a second or even third view at that.

506047,5,6302712017,"In Oceans Eleven, cool colors are used throughout the entirety of the film because it helps calm the audience from then building suspense when the colors the actors are wearing are relaxing and soothing and because when the surroundings are not vibrant and explosive the mood seems to change and contradict the plot. However, Julia Roberts character, Tess, her clothing color choices are warm, which reveals the importance of her character.

 My experience with this film has always been an enjoyable one. I have seen this film on various occasions, my first being at the local movie theater in town. I bought this movie when it first came out onto DVD for my sister.

 The cool colors that the actors wore, mostly blues and greens and browns, were very soothing to the viewer. The characters had to keep their ""cool"" throughout the film because they had to pull off the impossible feat which was attempting to purloin three huge casinos in Las Vegas. By wearing certain colors they were able to keep the audience under control and not cause any hyperventilation from the insane unending suspense. For example, throughout the planning and the first steps of the actual Bellagio robbery attempt, the characters were faced with a few major dilemmas. After they got the person inside the container and inside the vault, they noticed that the person had placed a briefcase on top of the container, and since his breathing time was running out the other characters were forced to figure out how to get him out of the box, without bumping off the briefcase and without setting off any of the alarms. With the cool color choices, the low key lighting, keeping the scenes darker, and the cool colors, the characters were able to pull it off, without being forced into frantic.

 The cold colors are not depressing at all due to the contradiction that they served. They were used throughout the film in not only the clothing choices but the scenery as well. All the furniture and props that were used all considered within the cool color range. They were all very relaxing and seemed very comfortable and soul soothing. For example, when they are in the room waiting for everything to follow through with the plan and waiting for the next person to do their part, the room has a ""cool"" feel.

 However, the cool colors, the blues, greens, and purples, weren't always used appropriately for say through out the film. As previously mentioned Tess's character threw off the serene feel that the other characters were attempting to produce. She was commonly found wearing red. She was drawing attention to herself in hopes to throw off her ex-husband and sidetrack him so that he wouldn't be able to finish his task even though she didn't know exactly what he was up to. She was a symbol of what was at stake for Danny, who was played by George Clooney. He could loose her again if this whole thing flops, conversely he doesn't have her back. Her vibrancy is an obstacle that is being forced upon Danny. The real challenge for Danny may possibly not be to rob the casinos, but to be able to do so without the interference of his ex.

 The movie Oceans Eleven has an overall uplifting theme that can make anyone smile.",1134518400,,3204,4.715563506261181

Are you ready to see some of Hollywood favorite actors playing crooked and unabashed criminals, without any other pretension than to entertain us for two hours? Because Ocean's 11 do not keep any deep moral message; is pure escapism, first class.

We have George Clooney in the role that Frank Sinatra once played, a thief and a liar that doesn't let pass 24 hours after being released on parole when he is already organizing his next job. And what better right hand to orchestrate the operation than Brad Pitt? His Rusty Ryan is an expert con man that curiously is always eating and backs up Ocean in every step.

Together, they gather a team of ex convicts and professional thieves. The target? 150 million dollars safely hide underground the vault of three of the largest casinos in Las Vegas, whose owner is Terry Benedict (Andy Garca), a multimillionaire that happens to be dating Ocean's wife, Tess  (Julia Roberts).

Brilliantly directed and written, Ocean's 11 is a criminal adventure without violence but packed with energy, humor and cleverness. The restless camera of Steven Soderbergh captures Las Vegas' world of extravagances and excesses, the perfect scenery for the plot.

""Harmony"" from the television series of The Little Mermaid featuring the beautiful voice of Jodi Benson as Ariel is next. Afterwards we're back to the classics with ""Let's Get Together"" from the original version of The Parent Trap and ""That's What Friend's Are For"" from The Jungle Book. Finally, we get to sing along with ""A Whole New World"" from Aladdin, as well as having the opportunity to sing Friend Like Me once more.

506085,3,6302712017,"As I mentioned in this review's title, I actually saw Ocean's 12 first and after finding that to be no particular thrill I was curious to see the first (not original).  So I did, and all in all I can see this was definitely better than the sequel, but really not by much.

You have the cast with the big names lining up a heist, which is elaborately achieved.  In addition, like the second one there is some misleading of the audience about what's happened, who knows what and that sort of thing.  Thankfully all of that is left to a believable level though, which is what really ruined the second film for me.

However, I felt no stirring of excitement, or really interest while watching.  Maybe this is because the sequel had dampened my opinions of what the first would be, or maybe this film really wasn't that special.  Which is why I leave it at three, because in honesty I felt Ocean's 11, and I quote myself, really wasn't that special.",1121126400,,944,4.421965317919075
506086,4,6302712017,"After receiving huge box office and critical success with his daring dramatic films, ""Erin Brockovich"" and ""Traffic"", director Steven Soderbergh moved on to a much lighter and more fun loving film with his next directorial effort.  Helming the remake of the Rat Pack classic, ""Ocean's Eleven"", Soderbergh shows that he not only has what it takes to deliver tight dramatic pieces, but also has the directorial capability to deliver a drama that is much more light hearted yet still compelling, and providing audiences an entertaining film and remake that can stand up to the original classic without any problem.

""Ocean's Eleven"" follows a recently paroled thief, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) as he attempts to put his life back together by trying to get his ex-wife, Tess (Julia Roberts) back from Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) who just happens to own the Bellagio Casino in Las Vegas.  To accomplish this, Danny has devised a plan to steal 150 million dollars from the Bellagio during a pay-per-view boxing match.  In order for this mission to be a success, Danny must enlist the aid of friends and fellow cons or all is lost.

""Ocean's Eleven"" achieved several feats that are very difficult to accomplish in one film; the ensemble cast, remaking a classic and possibly surpassing the original, and presenting fresh ideas.  Most films can only hope to achieve one of these points, if any.  The ensemble cast for ""Ocean's Eleven"" is basically a who's-who of Hollywood A-list talent, from George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and Bernie Mac; to legends, such as Carl Reiner and Elliot Gould.

Anytime a director or studio hopes to remake a classic film that is loved by many people, especially Sinatra fans, you're just asking for trouble.  First, you're expecting the fans to forgive changes that you make to the storyline, second you have to compete with an already successful movie in it's own right, so to even be remembered a remake needs to be better than the original which is not easy to do.  What makes remaking a film even more difficult, is that in this day and age it is increasingly difficult to present new and fresh ideas to the big screen, and when you're core story is based on a film from 1960, this task is even more difficult.

Thankfully ""Ocean's Eleven"" manages to please on all levels, giving audiences an entertaining caper film, that gathers the best of Hollywood and presents a new take on a classic film.

""Ocean's Eleven"" is rated PG-13 for language.",1120608000,,2494,4.869976359338062

The 1960's original version with Frank Sinatra and the infamous Rat Pack was fun, too, but this contemporary one makes full use of all the modern cinema techniques that make action/adventure films such fun to watch.

The whole setup (a plan to rob several Las Vegan casinos owned by a guy who has `taken possession' of Danny Ocean's ex-wife) is convoluted and sometimes difficult to follow - and frankly, rather than hit replay and try to figure it all out, I'd just advise suspending disbelief and going with the flow.

Today Las Vegas is a monument to commercialism with no sense of personality. Gone are the big name entertainers, the free shows, reasonably priced meals, and unless you drop huge amounts of money, the personal and high class service.

506108,4,6302712017,"I watched this one on DVD last night and was pleasantly surprised at what I saw.  Bear in mind that I'm writing this review from the perspective of one who has not seen the original 1960 version of this movie (featuring Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., et al.).  Therefore I know nothing about how the two versions compare with each other, and frankly I don't care.  This version stands on its own two feet quite nicely.

George Clooney plays just paroled con-man/convict Danny Ocean.  On the very day he gets out of prison, Danny starts to set in motion a plan to pull off the biggest scam ever -- to raid the vault that holds the earnings of the three hottest casinos in Vegas, to the tune of $160 million.  The vault is described as having a security system comparable to that of your average nuclear missile silo.  Oh, and by the way, these casinos just happen to be owned by the man who stole Danny's wife, Tess (Julia Roberts), so there's a little extra motivation to stiff this guy but good.

Joined by his right-hand-man, Rusty (played by Brad Pitt), Danny begins to assemble his squad of top-notch crooks (one of whom is played by Matt Damon), each one an expert in one or another necessary skill, and each one with his own little quirks.  Once the plan begins to develop, it's likely poetry in motion.  Watching these consummate professionals in action was a total treat.  The element of suspense was limited throughout the film, as the focus was more on watching Ocean's crew in action.  However, there are a few nailbiter scenes, and the surprise twist at the end was wonderfully unexpected.

If you haven't seen this movie, you really should.  Don't get hung up on how it compares to the earlier version, or you'll miss all the great stuff in this one.  Clooney and Pitt do a bang-up acting job, but Damon's character is a bit marginal.  I'm definitely looking forward to the sequel, ""Ocean's Twelve"".",1103500800,4,1926,4.604105571847508

506110,4,6302712017,"Well, it may seem ridiculous to give a good review to a movie which is, let's face it, essentially a piece of Hollywood glitter - glossy, with no real substance. But this is the reason I like it. Despite Julia Robert's annoying, predictable role as the love interest and the worryingly bad attempt at a Cockney accent by Don Cheadle (who, nonetheless, I applaud for his characterisation of a demolitions genius), this film quite simply rules. In my books, this film falls into the same category as 'Gossip' - another film that most of the newspaper critics hated, reducing it to simply `more teenage rubbish'. I, on the other hand, loved it. Films like these two are great because they are pieces of slick, empty, stylish Hollywood trash, not bad because of it.

`Ocean's Eleven' has very little storyline. Steven Soderbergh was preoccupied with getting as many established Hollywood film stars as he could, and tried to make the film more cool by adding in stars playing themselves, such as Joshua Jackson and Holly Marie Combs. The sheer number of leads in the film means that any characterisation (save a little for George Clooney) is joyfully tossed out of the window.

But, I have to argue the other side.

The filmmaking is slick and stylish, and despite not really an intentionally funny film, the understated humour sometimes made me laugh out loud (difficult to do) in enjoyment and satisfaction. The music is great, perfectly timed and perfectly selected. None of the actors are exactly taxed during this film; the lack of characterisation means that they have little part to play. Brad Pitt does what he does best - looks beautiful. I don't think Brad Pitt is a particularly good actor, but I do love what little character he has in this film - the constant eating was a quirk I particularly liked. Probably something I relate to.

This is a smooth, streamlined film which I love so much because of its simplicity, not in spite of it. It revels in the effortless presentation of a not particularly imaginative premise (how many similar films sucked? Let's not mention `Welcome to Collinwood'). Basically, this film is cool.",1101600000,,2134,4.838356164383562
506111,5,6302712017,"No major special affects, no grand CGI animation, no promise of a violent showdown between the protaganist and antagonist.  Ocean's Eleven is a tribute to simple film making that relies on characters, dialogue and pacing.

Considering the cast, it's amazing they were able to make this movie.  George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia...where does it end?  If this was the NFL they would have broken the salary cap five times over.  I think the money they cart out at the end of the movie was their paychecks.  It was reported that George sent his buddy Julia a twenty dollar bill in his request for her to be in the movie.  The quote inside; `I hear you work for twenty these days'.  This kind of simple charm has worked it's way into the movie.  Clooney and director Steven Soderberg have created a masterful remake of the Rat Pack movie that is far superior to the original, which starred Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr.  The 1960's version was widely known to be a stinker, so you may wonder why anyone would re-make a bomb?  Why ask why?  The new version is witty, quick and sharp as a ginsu.

Everyone is in top form playing characters who are specialists in one way or another.  Don Cheadle is especially note worthy speaking with a British accent, playing an explosives and electronics expert.  Clooney's character, Danny Ocean, pulls together a group of professionals to pull off one of the biggest Las Vegas heists in history.  Timing and intelligence are key, as well as the delicate art of the con.

The story unfolds however to reveal that Ocean's former wife, Tess (Julia Roberts) is now married to Terry Benedict, the man he is trying to con, and rob over 200 million dollars from.  He knows Terry doesn't care about Tess like he does and in the midst of the robbery, he proves it.  Don't worry, I haven't spoiled anything for you.  Trying to keep track of everything going on can be a little exhausting, but in the end, everything is made clear.  And if not, don't worry because you will want to watch the movie again.  I'm really looking foward to the sequel.",1099612800,2,2129,4.6063829787234045

The only exception would be when the spherical matting on top and bottom is removed to expose the full camera aperture, removing NOTHING from the sides. That STILL doesn't represent the director's intended composition, but that is FAR more acceptable than pan + scanning. So it is with great surprise that I find myself really liking the ""full frame"" edition of Ocean's Eleven. The widescreen version is preferred definitely, but Soderbergh has truly pulled off dual framing with exceptional results. Ocean's was filmed in the Super 35 format, which allows a filmmaker to alter between a widescreen and 4:3 aspect with minimal compromise; far less disastrous than if the principal photography was filmed solely with anamorphic lenses. I find either aspect ratio works. The ""full screen"" in this case, is completely acceptable. Not only that, but the movie itself is sooo good - it's like a great song you can listen to over and over again and never tire of it.",1099008000,,1002,4.970238095238095
506115,5,6302712017,"Wow, Amazon opinions are really up and down with some passionate negative reviews.  Fine by me, but here's 11 reasons to love this film:

1) Style - this film is a 2hr swinging martini! Some here have criticized Soderberg's direction?  From color to camera to pacing, this film is extremely well directed and it does have a definite style but it works well and serves the tone of the piece (ie: it is not distracting)

2) Frank Sinatra - it's based on a previous film starring ol' blue eyes... reason enough

3) The cast - incredible of course and they all jell perfectly with obvious chemistry. It's true Julie Roberts has little screen time, as some have mentioned, but her scenes with Clooney are fantastic (classic 40's style)

4) The soundtrack - music by David Holmes is outstanding, original and fresh. If you appreciate music - you will notice this soundtrack as you view the film, it really drives and enhances the film. It's not often that a non-orchestral piece catches my attention or sticks in my head after viewing but this one did (similar in effect (not style) for me to 'Good Will Hunting' or 'Slingblade')

5) Screenplay - clever - I've mentioned the 40's banter already but the whole script is very original and tight (it's amazing how the whole ensemble gets a piece of the action)

6) Big Stars?  Clooney - I'm not the biggest fan (aside from O'Brother..) but, I love him in this. Pitt - I'm less of a fan, but think he's great here.  My point being, that it's not just the 'big cast' that makes this movie work for me.

7) The heist is well designed and fun. Some have said it's too incredible or unbelievable...  uh,  yes it certainly is - I think that's the point.  Comparing this heist or the movie in general to the remade Italian Job?  please - there is no comparison. This movie does not end with the villian buzzing his helicopter rotor across the hero's car, it ends with...

8) A touching ending at a water fountain (ripped off from the Right Stuff!) - Well sort of, but it really works and is followed by an even better ending back at Clooney's tuxedo-wearing prison which is very clever although not to some Amazon reviewer's tastes I guess...  It's like the difference between a beer and a martini.  We all like beer, but this movie is a Martini so you should enjoy it like one.

9) Carl Reiner is in this movie and so is Elliot Gould. And they are good and great.  Garcia is really good. Damon is fine but hopefully with more to do in the sequel.  Bernie Mac is king.

10) Vegas!  This movie (Soderberg) makes Vegas look and feel like we think Vegas is supposed to look and feel like...  It really doesn't of course - but in this movie, Vegas really shines.

11) The DVD commentary by Damon/Garcia/Pitt is fantastic. Better than the FOTR cast commentary even.

thanks, just my opinion

12) No character development..?!?  who is Matt Damon's dad ?!? What movie are you reviewers watching?  This is a big ensemble cast in a stylish heist film. It's a ride.  What were you expecting? Have you anaylzed the lyrics to ""Fly Me to the Moon"" for content or character development?  Don't bother - it's about joy and being in love (or making a lot of whooppee)",1098316800,2,3185,4.496515679442509
506126,5,6302712017,"Any movie with stars such as George Clooney, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts, just to name a few, is linked to sensation, which is exactly what ""Ocean's Eleven"" is.  The remake of the 1960's Ocean's 11 starring Frank Sinatra and the rat pack is plainly and simply a GOOD movie.  The range and number of star characters in the movie make every scene a delight to watch.  There wasn't one scene where I found myself uninterested in the story, or in any way bored.

 Brad Pitt and George Clooney head up a clan of eleven people total to eventually rob three of Las Vegas' largest casino's, all of which are owned by the same man, Andy Garcia, who just happens to be dating Clooney's ex-wife Julia Roberts.  The fact that Andy Garcia is dating George Clooney's ex-wife brings up several small controversies between not only Clooney and Garcia, but between Clooney and his clan.  The movie actually has a lot to do with this small love affair, which brings the movie even more interest.  The movie is full of surprises and clever and unique scenes.  It is a creative and very amiable film that should not be overlooked.

 With the star studded lineup in ""Oceans Eleven"" every character plays their role to its best.  Brad Pitt plays one of the leaders of this group of thieves and plays it to perfection.  During the movie he plays a very sleek and cool character that is the best in his field.  George Clooney, much like Brad Pitt's character, plays the role of a very educated ex-con who knows the ropes of being one of the best in his field.  Matt Damon plays the role of a very young man who is very inexperienced in the world, but is very good at what he does, being a thief.  Andy Garcia is the owner of the casinos; he is very up tight and always on top of things.  His characteristics make the robbing of the casinos that much more difficult, which in turn, gives the movie more suspense.  The rest of the characters bring a great deal of comedy to the film, which is why it's is so good.

 Ocean's Eleven is a film with the perfect mix of espionage and comedy.  While the plot is very clever and unique, it doesn't seem far fetched in the least.  This is by far one of 2002's funniest and most interesting films.  It is one of those movies that you can buy and watch several times, mainly because there is always an interesting or funny scene that you'd want to see again and again.

I shied away from it for a long time because I don't like to see crooks win, and I didn't want to watch them get caught either.  I will not give away the plot.  I thought the movie was only passing interesting, it was all the nuts and bolts of robbing this casino vault (compare it to Audrey Hepburn, Peter O'Toole and I think Hugh Griffith in ""How To Steal A Million""), it had almost no human contact, feeling or drama (note I said almost), Julia Roberts was in it only a miniscule amount of time (practically a cameo), it had lots of clever remarks and zingers, well-turned phrases (and frankly if it hadn't been for those I wouldn't have finished it or given it even 3 stars), their plans for overcoming the obstacles only partly made sense to me (duh, so there I sat for almost 2 hours not understanding what I was watching), I was both entertained and disappointed.

The whole setup was so elaborate, it reminded me of the old TV series ""Mission Impossible"".

However, there was one detail that threatened to derail the whole plot.  The character played by Julia Roberts, over whom George Clooney and everybody else in this movie was supposed to yearn over.  They all spoke at length of her beauty, etc.

And then poor Julia shows up in front of the camera.  I am no Julia Roberts fan, but I think she was incredibly ill-served in the clothes she was made to wear, the lighting, the lines she was given to speak (the character she was made to play was certainly unencumbered by charm), you name it.  When she first hove into view, precariously lumbering down a stair and lurching across the set, in a barf-brown short-skirted suit, with her hair scraped back, and no makeup that I could see, she looked like the world's most unconvincing female impersonator.

506131,3,6302712017,"Perhaps understandably, Steven Soderbergh wished to make a film for the fun of it, after his more serious and critically aclaimed Traffic and Erin Brokovich.  With that criterion, Soderbergh succeeds beautifully - this is a fun film, a popcorn movie in the best sense of the term.  Unfortunately, it doesn't quite pull itself up enough to be a film that one would wish to watch over and over.

The story - Danny Ocean, newly released from prison, hatches a plot to rob the vault at a Vegas casino, estimated to be worth 150 million.  He gathers 10 associates to help and we're provided with a complex but not complicated plan to break into the vault and more importantly, to escape with the loot.  To Soderbergh's credit, he keeps us guessing as to how the plan will ultimately unfold, and his solution is both deceptively simple and elegant, without cheating (a VERY important point!).

However, Soderbergh's most important contribution is his reputation as a director, enabling him to bring in big names for relatively small parts.  This makes the film work, as the audience immediately recognises the actors and can therefore keep each character straight in his/her mind.  With 11 heist plotters, plus the casino owner and his girlfriend, gives 13 major characters - quite a number for a 2-hour film!  In fact, much of the fun is provided by the performances - Brad Pitt (for my money, the best actor of his generation), Julia Roberts (arguably the biggest movie star in the world), Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner, Andy Garcia, Matt Damon, etc., etc., etc.  George Clooney, the putative #1 star, makes no attempt to hog screen time and all seem happy to be part of the ensemble.

But..... The film never really rises above its genre.  It's fun, but you don't take it home with you.  Enjoy it for the couple hours it runs, but it's unlikely to leave much lasting impression.  Part of that is because there's no reason to buy this DVD.  It consists solely of a 15-minute making-of featurette (possibly the most annoying, self-agrandising featurette I've seen in years!) and 2 audio commentaries.  The one by Soderbergh and his screenwriter is informative, but the second, by Andy Garcia, Matt Damon, and Brad Pitt, is the only real reason to buy the DVD - it's almost as much fun as the film itself.  (Pitt, especially, seems to have taken an interest in doing commentaries, and I welcome actors' contributions to them).",1091923200,2,2414,4.806295399515738
506132,2,6302712017,"A dud pure and simple. Period. Agreed some films call for a suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer but this is ridiculous. Clooney and Pitt play ultra cool crooks in this ultra cold turkey. They spend their on-screen time looking good and talking smooth while hatching a harebrained plot to rob a casino owned by Andy Garcia, who looks his usual quiet menacing self. There's the mandatory (and wholly unnecessary) love interest in the form of Julia Roberts... what's SHE doing in a dud like this?

The only reason I've given this movie 2 stars is because of the star cast.

I got so bored watching the movie the first time that I switched it off after the first few minutes. It was only because a friend had lent the DVD to me that I decided to watch it once before returning it. Big mistake.

My advice: this film's not worth buying - it's not even worth renting, unless you want to waste a precious couple of hours of your life.

506134,4,6302712017,"This smooth, highly entertaining film proves that you don't need non-stop action, blood and gore, or CG special effects to enjoy a movie in this day and age. Steven Soderbergh assembled a fine ensemble of superstars willing to work together instead of trying to outdo each other; the result is stylish good fun suitable for the entire family. (Okay, there are a few four letter words here and there.) George Clooney is perfectly cast as Danny Ocean, ringleader of a motley crew of criminals preparing to rob not one but three Las Vegas casinos. Brad Pitt turns in a sharp and snappy performance as his right-hand man; the two play off of each other very nicely. Matt Damon is appealing as the youngest of the bunch (the scene where he receives instructions from Pitt is hilarious in an understated way), and Don Cheadle is manic and entertaining as their demolition expert. The rest of the cast is quite good too--and it's nice to see old-timers like Carl Reiner and Elliot Gould. The lovely Julia Roberts isn't quite up to the gentlemen in this flick; as attractive as she is, she seems to have mailed in her performance. Well, maybe she's supposed to act shell-shocked after Ocean, her ex-husband, suddenly resurfaces in her life. You may need to see this more than once to catch all of the little tricks pulled by the thieves, but the film's worth it. And of course there's plenty of eye candy for the ladies.

how really great it is to be a thief.....And they managed to use, in my estimation, the top worst to do it.
Clooney, who always portrays himself in no matter what role he takes...Pitt who walks thru his role like a zombie throwing in one liners to make it interesting???? And let's not forget the token female, Roberts, who I am still trying to figure out how she can be the most beautiful woman in the world, or is it one of the top five in the world? I forget......
The only redeeming thing about this film was the presence of Garcia and maybe the Las Vegas location. I have no plans to see the sequel as I am sure it will be more of the same humdrum

Hey, wait a minute! Steven Soderberg directed that one, too! This man has a gift for bringing out the best in his performers, as well as crafting a film that is a feast for the senses. ""Oceans 11"" sounds good, looks good, and, if it were edible, I think it would ""taste"" good.
All the actors are fantastic in their respective roles but I must tip my hat to an un-credited Don Cheadle with his Cockney accent, legendary Carl Reiner, and Andy Garcia who is classy yet effectively menacing as the casino owner robbed of his millions by Clooney and company. Julia Roberts makes great use of her limited screen time, looking exquisite as the woman torn between two men.

I love the plot of the film, I LOVE the scene after they were done with the Job, all of the theives are standing watching the water fountains, each one walking away one at a time.  The music is classic, and really adds to the value of the film.  By FAR, one of the best films I have ever seen.",1089504000,3,471,3.8247422680412373
506157,4,6302712017,"Some people are really taking this movie way too seriously, but I am glad that I read many reviews on this site before taking a chance on it on DVD as I did not get around to see it when it first came out.
Where do I start with this ultra-cool flick (which by the way is a remake of a movie that I did not see)? I can safely say that it's the most fun I've had seeing a movie in a long time. The cast is sublime and just they sink their teeth into these ultra-cool characters and don't let go until the final frame. I am always impressed by George Clooney's quiet strength and humor, but I was knocked out by Brad Pitt. I have not seen him this self-assured since his star-making supporting performance in ""Thelma & Louise"". In my opinion, although this is an ensemble cast from heaven, Pitt's role is just to cool for school and with the aforementioned exception, I've never been a big Brad Pitt fan. There is a scene in which Pitt is teaching something (I won't give it away) some current teen stars in Hollywood (playing themselves) that is priceless. The only casting choice that I question is Julia Roberts. She has an amazing stage presence and deserves to be the major movie star that she is, but I just don't see the sparks fly between her and George Clooney (to see an example of scorching chemistry with George Clooney catch ""Out Of Sight with Jennifer Lopez, when she was not annoying beyong belief and looked like a really promising actress, but I digress) and this movie is all sparks. However, her relationship with Andy Garcia is believable.
This movie is a hoot and I found myself wanting the movie not to end as it moves at lazer speed but it's not like some movies where the stars are secondary to the screen. Here the effects support the actors and give them a playground. The cinematography is gorgeous as are the director's choices with colors. The scenary is lavish and as is the case with movies from directors like Martin Scorsece, here you never doubt that you are where you are supposed to be. I can smell the money and the Vegas mood in a way that is rarely accomplished by lesser directors.
Possible spoiler: Some reviewers have qualms with a couple of story limitations and I never noticed the first one and there is some validity the comments. With regard to the ending, although part of me wishes that the movie had ended with the group watching the fountains dance; I don't agree with those who claim that the ending is flawed. Do you think that the story really ends that way? I think not, there will be a price to pay and the goons in the car are not going to play nice. I think that the director chose to focus on the dance, while the price that they will pay belongs in a different genre and I am glad that we got all dance.
In a nutshell, if you want to put aside all your everyday troubles and enjoy some well cast escapism performed by actors at the top of the craft and directed by one of the most interesting directors working today, see this movie now. Unlike others in the genre, it does not try to be all things to all people and just focuses on being a thrilling ride. I usually reserve 5 stars to classics, but I give this almost 5 stars because it manages to go exactly what it set out to do and made me want to watch it again as soon as I finished it. Not many movies, if any, have given me that thrill.",1089158400,3,3351,4.287066246056782
506158,5,6302712017,"It's not easy for me to review this movie, as I couldn't possibly comment on the likelihood of them accomplishing what they set out to accomplish. But this is fiction, and I expect that Las Vegas casino owners or security personnel who saw this film found themselves rolling in the aisles. That's just my guess.
That aside, this was a brilliantly directed and acted film. It's difficult to direct an ensemble of three characters and have each of them fully realized. More difficult by far to have an ensemble of eleven. But Soderbergh pulls it off admirably.
Casting decisions were also well made. I didn't see the original movie (although I intend to), so I don't know who was who, but it was fascinating to watch Brad Pitt and George Clooney (both often selected or at least short listed as the sexiest men alive) engage in discussion, the camera switching from one face to another. One can imagine half of the women (and some men, let's be honest here) in the audience swooning for five seconds while the camera rests on Clooney, and they the other half swooning for Brad.
Other than Clooney and Pitt, Scott Caan and Casey Affleck (the brothers) had a perfect onscreen banter. You really felt for Matt Damon's character (another sexiest man alive short-lister) when he was shut up in the van with them, and his reason for fleeing. Damon himself demonstrated his usual talent, nervous while being instructed on how to play the role of a Nevada Gaming Official, but playing it perfectly when it came time.
Andy Garcia had just the right amount of frigidity and rigidity, but not enough evincible power.
To me, this was a movie about some the high jinks of the robbery and the comedy that some of these high jinks produced, and the terrific banter of the various characters. The ending was very satisfying, kept me in suspense, and surprised me (I didn't see it coming). This is what movies are supposed to do.

Secondly, a lot of people could relate to the premise of the story: taking down Vegas!  The flow of the movie was also very fast-paced.  There were hardly any slow moments and the scenes were shot well.
Lastly, the DVD extras included some solid documentaries and views from the cast and crew.  A lot of other hit movies either embellish on the extras or come up lacking, but this one seemed to have just the right amount.

506161,2,6302712017,"I heard a great deal of good things about this movie, probably made me more critical to everything about the movie. Though I did not enjoy some of the movie, the heist scene was a little clever with the whole switching of the money... everything else just was there. The star-studded cast was what helped the movie most; it seemed the characters just being there was enough to help the movie gravitate along. The directing of the movie was horrible... camerawork was random and all over the place and the attempts to put 'creative' work into the movie by the director killed it furthur. Some of the reasons might be straight from the movie... so sorry to anyone who might be detered by this review. But if I can pull [11] reasons not to watch this movie... then ask yourself if it's a movie you really want to watch.
1. The movie was filled with a superb, stellar cast: Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, and Brad Pitt... imagine the movie with some unknowns or less known actors. Not as good is it?
2. Heist movies are getting very boring. The movies with clever, well-planned schemes to make major heists have been done, and done, and done... but it takes a great writer to make the story great. Take ""The Italian Job"" for example, an awesome movie about a major heist, where they use the same tactics to steal the money again... hesit movie yes, but idea of heist was original. Come on, a little Chinese guy with no air for 30 minutes snuck into a high-security vault?
3. Character developments were not even apparent... all you know is that Danny Ocean (Clooney) wants his ex-wife, Tess (Roberts), back, Rusty (Pitt) is Ocean's old friend, and most of the other character's have been part of a previous heist group. Where the heck is Damon's character from? He is someone's son, whose son again? There is little character development, if any.
4. The movie was unpleasant to watch, there were so many... 'Why is this going on?' scenes. Many parts of the movie seemed unnecessary to have at all.
5. The director tried too hard, which was very apparent. In one scene I noticed it zoomed in on a car freshener. The green pine-tree freshener. Everytime an object is focused in on; usually there is some relevance to it. So later in the movie it zooms on the same freshener in the S.W.A.T. truck. What was that all about?
6. The weird angles and ""artistic"" camera work were rather annoying... another attempt by the director to make the movie more original, or interesting to watch.
7. The scene after the heist when everyone is standing there watching the water fountain, and one by one they leave silently... what is that? Another act by the director...
8. There is no way that they could have timed the exact movements of Garcia's character, sure it said that he did everything on the clock by schedule, but a heist is something you cannot plan for. It was all too easy... and timed. Which made it all the more un-believable?
9. If the group was that prepared and went over everything as to even create a mock vault, which was to distract the security but also for practice purposes, how would they not have fresh batteries in the remote for the bomb? And how did that Chinese guy even get his hand stuck? One minute he's planting devices in the wall, next minute he's stuck. He could have just taken off the bandage as well...
10. How in the world did Bernie Mac's character get complete access to the blueprint of the vault and security system? A blackjack dealer getting full access? Garcia's character was also noted to be very exact and all-knowing of everyone and everything in the casino. So how would Bernie Mac, a supposed ex-convict, become a dealer in his own casino?
11. What was the ending about? It said '3 to 6 months later?; when Clooney said the exact same thing for what time he would get out of jail. Garcia's men from the casino are following them... probably a lead into Ocean's Twelve.

But after watching it, I must say I was wrong. Ocean's eleven really goes well all along the film. It's easy to follow, enjoyable and actors do what they have to do. The plot is not only imaginative, but well carried on.
But it reminds me ""The Sting"" (Paul Newman and Robert Redford) so much. The main couple of actors have the same role: both handsome and charming, Clooney acting as Newman (the real commandeer-in-chief) and Pitt acting as Redford (the right hand).

It moves smoothly, the entire cast plays it cool and easy and Steven Soderbergh directs it with flair and intelligence.
Yes, it's light, yes, it's a trifle but it's so fun! I really loved this film. Affleck and Caan are hilarious as bickering brothers.

I don't mean in the ""wow it's really great you should see it"" cool. I mean -- it's cool. The movie is genuinely cool. Watching it, you are convinced you probably look cool. Walking around with the DVD, you can imagine it will help you pick up chicks (it won't). But still, you can hope that the coolness inherent in this movie to rub off on you. It's THAT cool.
And with good reason. George Clooney. Brad Pitt. Bernie Mac. Matt Damon. Julia Roberts. That's a lot of slick actors in one package.
Clooney plays Danny Ocean, a recently divorced, recently released from prison con man. His ex-wife, who he is still very much in love with, has shacked up with a real creep -- an arrogant man who puts money before everything else. Danny sets out to get back at him in a rather extravagant way. He gets ten of his old buddies together and they take on the most oturageous heist in history.
The plot is about taking down not one, not two, but THREE casinos at the same time. It's full of manly, geeky fun. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously (how could it?), but the cast is obviously having so much fun that you can't help but enjoy yourself. I never saw the original -- but if it had half the charm this movie does, it must have been cool indeed.
Carl Reiner is excellent as a grumpy old conman. Shaobo Qin players a convincing acrobat (who doesn't talk much). There's two brothers who bicker all the time and you can't tell if it's part of the con or not. In fact, the whole movie plays with the audience -- is it really a con? Because of its playful tone, you forgive it for fooling you more than once, sometimes with the same trick.
The one weak point is Don Cheadle. He's a black guy playing a black guy with a...bizarre (Australian? Cockney?) accent. It sounds like me doing an accent. And I sound fake when I do it.
There are a few other moments that dim the glow of this movie -- Maleficent pointed out that Julia Roberts can't walk like a lady and apparently either no one's telling her or she just doesn't care. She stumps around onscreen like Lenny from the Grapes of Wrath. It's embarassing. The director tries to compensate, but fails -- in one scene, she's supposed to be sashaying across the screen, but instead ends up gallumphing by instead. For such a pretty lady that's supposed to be a real class act, it shatters the illusion.
But that's me being nitpicky. This movie is excellent. For any guy who has ever wanted to be cool...or in this day and age, isn't sure what cool is in anymore...this movie will help guide the way.",1079913600,5,2570,4.378661087866109

What added to the movies entertainment value was the fact that along with all of the above it was funny and well acted.

Oceans 11 is a fun story. Danny Ocean(Clooney) has just gotten out of jail. He wants to steal $150 million dollars from Terry Benidickt(Garcia). In the process he wants to also get his ex-wife back and he gets an all star gang to help him pull this caper off.
George Clooney was great in the film. I've always had mixed reactions for Clooney on the big screen, because he does a hit movie and then goes and does a bunch of duds. I don't get why he does it. He's great in this one and his fans will be well pleased.
Brad Pitt was the best in this film. He was cocky, arrogant, and so dang cool all at the same time. Him, Garcia, and Damon really drove the film for me. It's such a slick film, and Pitt has the slickest character. Awesome performance.
I didn't like Julia Roberts in the movie. You don't see a whole lot of her, but they advertised her name like crazy for it. SHe doesn't do all that bad, I just don't care for her to much.
Matt Damon was great in the movie. This guy really is a great actor. He doesn't get the kind of attention he deserves. He's signed on to do the sequel to this alond with Pitt and Clooney. Damons fans will be pleased with his job in this.

506193,3,6302712017,"Steven Soderbergh continues to lead a blessed life of filmmaking. Here he wrangles an insanely high-profile cast into a lighthearted, breezy, ensemble heist film. This film shares it's title and it's main character's name with the Rat Pack original, and virtually nothing else. Whereas the original was a slower-paced showcase for the singing/acting talents Sinatra, Davis, and Martin, this movie hits the ground running and instead leans on the charisma and comedic timing of it's richly gifted cast. While George Clooney plays the titular Danny Ocean as the swashbuckling leader, the film is really made by Brad Pitt as the #2 man/cardsharp, Bernie Mac's subtly funny blackjack dealer, and the perfect comedic delivery of Elliot Gould as the bankroll and Carl Reiner as the flimflam aritst. The rest of the cast ranges from ""good enough"" (Julia Roberts) to ""pitch perfect"" (Andy Garcia, Matt Damon). Ultimately, this film lives off it's quick pace, and the charisma of Ocean's team as the undertake the seemingly impossible heist. Had Soderbergh let this film drag at all, the many Sherman tank-sized plot holes would have creamed the viewers enjoyment, but like a good magician, Soderbergh keeps you distracted just long enough to get a couple hours of enjoyment out of this highly polished film.
The film then falls flat on its face with the DVD packaging. Setting aside the lousy cover (when the movie's posters were far superior), the special features are at best weak. The cast commentary consists of Matt Damon and Andy Garcia both talking together, interspersed with another track of Brad Pitt. While there is some useful insight, it is not, on the whole, interesting, and I frequently found myself wishing they would shut up so I coudl hear the dialogue. Steven Soderbergh's commentary ranks somewhere between watching paint dry and watching ice melt. In particular, his repeatedly complaints about the lighting in this scene or that (invariably when the lighting was at its most distinctive) but not wanting to reshoot because the scene went well.
If you liked the movie, it's a good copy of the movie, but the overall DVD package is nothign special.",1073952000,,2161,5.090140845070422
506194,5,6302712017,"I'm a typical 16-year-old girl who mostly frequents the cinemas for romantic comedies and Harry Potter. I never thought that i could be interested in a movie about robbery, like Ocean's Eleven. I only saw Ocean Eleven when my dad bought the DVD a year after it was released. I was hooked on the movie right from the start. The movie was entertaining as it was intelligent. At first, i was confused with the plot, and i had to ask my dad every once in a while for a commentary on the movie! He got pretty irritated after a while!! So, feeling dissatisfied and wanting  more of Ocean's Eleven, i saw it again the next day, and this time, i was really blown away! I swear, there was never a moment in this movie, when i went 'Oh, why didn't they cut out this part? It's so draggy and boring'. The movie was PERFECT and almost FLAWLESS. I said, ALMOST flawless, because, as much as i LOVE Julia Roberts, i didn't think that she was best suited for the role. She had great chemistry with George Clooney, but she just didn't look the part as girlfriend to the ruthless Benedict (Andy Garcia).
The movie was so exciting and it actually made, robbing a casino, a pretty cool thing to do. At some point, i was kind of wishing i was the twelth member of Ocean's team!! They're robbers, but they're not dumb robbers, the kind that grabs the bag with money and make a run for it!
They are a group of intelligent individuals with each a specialty of their own. Without one member, the robbery would have gone haywire. The robbery was well thought-out and was done almost effortlessly.
The movie must have been very expensive, as they had Hollywood's biggest names involved. I think the cast was one of the reasons that made the movie so incredible. You're blown away by seeing so many of your favourite stars, being together in one place, and communicating with each other to make the best out of the movie. As they were talented actors, all of them brought out the characters beautifully.
I have seen this movie many times over, that i lost count. Treat yourself to Ocean's Eleven, you won't be dissapointed.",1072396800,3,2096,4.486910994764398

This is a movie that you must watch from beginning to end to really understand what all has happened, and it even took me two times to really get it. Ocean's Eleven is about a group of con men trying to rob the Bellagio, MGM Grand, and the Mirage in Vegas, which is pretty much impossible. I love this movie for a few reasons:
1. Great cast!! So many big names in this movie and they all do a fantastic job!
2. I found this movie very unpredictable. Just when you think they are going to get caught in the middle of their heist - they surprise you!
3. Although this movie is mainly a suspense/drama type movie, it does have some really funny moments.

506215,5,6302712017,"After ignoring this film for nearly a year after its original release, Ocean's Eleven is one of the most pleasant surprises I've encountered on film in a very long time!  I tend to be somewhat skeptical of George Clooney, depending on the particular role he is playing.  Regardless of this nominally respected opinion, Clooney fits the part of Danny Ocean very well.  In fact, I am extremely challenged to think of anyone else that could have been substituted for him.  All the other actors (Damon, Affleck...Casey...not Ben, Reiner, Cheadle, etc.) also do an excellent job.  Their characters are unique, strong, and believable.  The dialogue throughout the film is sharp and witty, and the soundtrack (by David Holmes) is a work of art in its own right.  The music is extremely appropriate for each scene and strongly enhances the variety of emotions conveyed throughout the film.  I cannot say enough about the soundtrack.  It is definitely addictive, just like the film itself.  If asked about any weaknesses in the film, I would have to say that it stems from Julia Roberts in the part of Tess, although one is able to quickly adapt to her acting and appreciate her in this role.
Although there are many memorable scenes throughout the film, two deserve mentioning.  The first is the glare of Terry Benedict (played by Andy Garcia) as he is being robbed and is watching from the ""Eye in the Sky.""  Again, the mere motionless glare of nearly a minute is enhanced by the soundtrack.  The second is the group of eleven watching the water spray in front of the casino while Debussy's Clair de Lune plays in the background.  Both scenes, if you'll notice, have absolutely no dialogue.  The images and soundtrack are sufficiently strong enough to leave a lasting impression.  You won't be disappointed.
Also, if you rent/buy the DVD, you might want to consider watching the special features.  I found the commentary on the clothing being reflective and/or enhancing the personality of each character to be extremely fascinating.
(I refuse to compare this film to or rate it against the original Ocean's Eleven.  Each one is unique in its own right and is appropriate for the time/era in which it was produced)",1070582400,,2207,4.871313672922252
506216,5,6302712017,"Talk about your perfect remake. Take a swinging Rat Pack comedy from the 60s, bring in a crop of Hollywood's hottest leading men (Clooney, Pitt, Damon), add timeless Hollywood funny men (Carl Reiner, Elliot Gould), one of Hollywood's slickest actors for the villian (Andy Garcia), and Hollywood's It Girl (Julia Roberts), add the amazing director Steven Soderbergh, and you have a winner of a movie! The script is fun and freeflowing throughout, and it is obvious from the film how much fun the actors had making it (which Soderbergh should be proud of, given the number of stars he had on his hands). The camerawork is superb and Soderbergh's quick cuts and often frantic pacing help to enhance the fun fast-paced rhythm and tempo of the film. The jazzy score adds to this tempo as well. As for the DVD, while there is not much in the way of behind-the-scenes extras, the commentary track, which features Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and Andy Garcia, is fun to listen to and enhances the movie experience. Defiantely worth owning, as it was one of the best films of 2001.",1070323200,,1066,4.736559139784946
506217,5,6302712017,"This movie is a remake of the Original Ocean's Eleven which starred the Rat Pack. I think it was better than the first, although that's just personal opinion.
This movie is funny, smart, hip, modern, and entertaining with a dream cast: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner, Elliot Gould, Casey Affleck, and more...
Danny, a convicted thief, (Clooney) has just been parolled. But he doesn't even have a change of clothes on before he's plotting his next job. He gets together the crew of a lifetime to pull of a job that has NEVER before been sucessfully accomplished - They are going to rip off TWO Las Vegas Casino's and walk out the front doors with the money in their hands! -(and hopefully, if things go according to plan, Danny will win back his ex-wife -Julia Roberts- also)

Smooth dialogue from bad guys ya love and the good guy who is really bad gets it in the end.  Good but not great.  Everyone's in on the joke and that's what makes it easier to watch the second time.

506219,4,6302712017,"Ocean's Eleven tells the story of one of the best fantasies today.  To rob three Las Vegas casinos without anyone finding out and outsmarting the person you are stealing from while you are right next to him.  Johnny Ocean assembles a team of his buddies to rob three casinos, especially the casino that belongs to a jerk that isn't considered one of Johnny's best friends.  The whole movie is a maze of twists and turns so when you think you understand what is going on, you don't.  If you try to figure it out the first time, you are going to miss half the movie while you are trying to tie it all together.  This movie is pretty serious but it does cause some laughter with the antics of the guys in the group that is sure to make you at least chuckle.  The urge to watch this movie every week or so is not there because once you understand the plot after watching it a few times, it loses it's novelty.  It is a good movie to watch after you have let it collect dust on the shelf for a while.  Not really pinned as a party movie, it is a good movie to show when it is just you and a couple of friends.  Most people that I have watched Ocean's Eleven with or discussed it with have enjoyed it, but I have learned recently there are some that absolutely hate the movie.

506221,5,6302712017,"This movie has it all.  I would like to hit on the major ones. First off just the cast list itself is incredible. The movie boasts such amazing and credible actors including Brad Pitt, Gerorge Clooney, Matt Damon, Carl Reiner, Andy Garcia, and Julia Roberts just to mention a few. Such an incredible cast and all exact for their roles. Everyone fits naturally into their roles. With such a perfect cast that all respect each other as professionals, you are able to get further in to this movie. When you know that people have had a great time filming the movie you cann relax and just enjoy its beauty.  This movie grabs you right from the beginning and does not let go of you until the credits being to role. The script is excellent, some amazing work by Ted Griffen. Steven Soderburgh does amazing things with the camera work. What other directors will capture in 3 shots he can get in 1 and it works beautifully with the movie. The costumes are perfect and fit exactly with each character. Just by looking at their outfits it tells you something about their character which adds even more to the movie. Even the way they portray Las Vegas is enitsing. Vegas in this movie is the vegas we all wish it was. This movie gives you Las Vegas as very glamorous and shiny, which brings an interesting cadence to the movie. But most importantly, this movie has the greatest soundtrack I have ever heard which adds so much to the scenes.
Here are the stakes 160 million dollars from the 3 most powerful casinos in Las Vegas. 11 of the worlds greatest con artists. One ruthless owner of all three casinos (Andy garcia), 1 wildcard (Julia Roberts,) and hundreds of things that could go wrong. This remake does the original all the justice it deserved and more. When the final scene ends you will be begging for more, because it is such a beautiful movie that is so well cast, well written, and well filmed. The good news? You only have to wait a year and a half for the next one.",1063584000,,1970,4.469444444444444

I would recommend watching the original with Sinatra/Sammy Davis - RatPack first, and then watch this version.  The ending throws you for a major league curve ball in the original version.  This version takes you on a roller-coaster ride right down to the ending. 5 Stars. Good Luck in Vegas! - Chad Castorina",1062374400,,556,4.4950495049504955
506266,5,6302712017,"This is the movie the Rat Pack SHOULD have made. The original had everything going for it-- Sinatra, Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., the sixties, a swingin' soundtrack --but somehow fell flat. For a crime flick that should have been fun, it left you slightly down at the end and the entire tone was heavy and serious as the morgue the last scene is filmed in.
But the new version with Clooney, Pitt, Damon and Roberts? Now HERE is a movie worth watching. The plot has been tightly updated and the whole film has been shot in a slick, nostalgic, hip style that is a little bit retro and a little bit whimsical. The whole feel is successful and the movie unabashedly delivers simply a good time. The twists are fun, but not mind-bending (the narration of how the heist will be pulled and the repeated rehearsals leave the audience with a fairly clear idea of how to pull off their very own perfect crime) and the characters are quirky and fun to watch.
It was an excellent update to classify all the eleven con artists into types: ""the idea man"", ""the grease man"", ""the high roller"", etc, as it helps you distinguish them all (a fairly impossible feat in the clumsily-edited Rat Pack version) and gives the movie a smirky touch. This isn't a movie about a heist, this is a movie about a fish-tale of a heist. This is fantasy, but it is so nicely achieved that you feel great about having seen it.
Frankly, I liked Brad Pitt and George Clooney better in their roles than Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra. They seemed to have a better on-screen friendship. I rooted for this group more than I did the Rat Pack-- I WANTED them to get away with it! Also, Andy Garcia delivers such a deliciously cold, shark-like performance that you can hardly wait to see him get ripped off big time.

Besides the obvious reasons - the big name stars, the heist storyline... this movie had the balls to have a heist movie without everyone backstabbing each other.  It seems like every single heist movie you watch these days has people working together, then one guy turns out to be a bad guy... that doesn't happen here.  It's purely about how they pull off the greatest robbery of their lives and it's fantastic.
Besides the heist storyline, there is also the love story between Tess (Julia Roberts) and Danny Ocean (George Clooney).  I wish Julia had had a bigger part, it seemed like she was mostly eye candy.  I think she had only a few lines the entire time.
Overall it was great.  It's not deep, it's just pure fun.  I give it five stars. :)",1058313600,,767,4.474820143884892

There's a certain rhythm to the movie and it never misses a beat from start to end. The dialogue is amazingly clever and everytime you watch you find something new. I hear people complain about the lack of character development. I don't believe that was the point and you can be pretty sure that's not what Soderbergh meant for it to be.
Funny, clever and incredibly stylish.  Just a great flick all round with nice little touches. The DVD is equally great with behind the scenes looks at casting and how the dialogue pretty much emerged from the actors themselves. I highly recommend this.",1058054400,,915,4.319767441860465

But the script is painfully sophomoric.  The romantic triangle is played out at an emotional and intellectual level you might expect from 12-year-olds going steady and breaking up during summer school.  The jokes are cliches -- delivered with panache by stars milking them for all they're worth, but still they're jokes you've heard before and can expect to hear again in many a B movie after this one.  The ""caper"" we all paid to watch is handled just as slickly -- meaning, holes in the plot are zoomed past with a throwaway line to disguise the shortcoming -- but frankly you could cover most of the same ground by watching a couple of old Columbo TV shows.
At least it's a moving target.  Events follow quickly upon one another, and before you're done marvelling about one tired old idea they've trotted out before your eyes, they've got the next tired old idea up for you to look at.  For a long time I kept hoping it would get better.  It didn't, but I did keep the DVD playing until it was over, so I'll give it 2 stars instead of 1.",1057363200,2,1144,4.519417475728155

The print of this film for this DVD was not the high quality I expected. I had to turn the brightness up twice. Looks like an old print for television on a lesser channel.

  Thank God for Elvis Presley music. ""A Little Less Conversation"" is from the movie, Live A Little, Love A Little (1968) It was remixed by Junkie XL in 2002 and was later used in ""Las Vegas"" tv series (NBC, 2003-08).
  I liked the original Ocean's Eleven (1960), but if they made a sequel to this 2001 version, I would probably watch it. I disliked the ending of this version.  Shaobo Qin is certainly a scene stealer, isn't he.  If they make a sequel I hope Qin is in it too.  Like the original film, this was filmed in Las Vegas too.  That's the way it should be.  Interesting Audio Commentary.

506295,4,6302712017,"Ocean's Eleven is a remake of the film made by the Rat Pack in the 1960's.  The story is about a group of crooks and conmen to rob three impregnable casinos in Las Vegas.  They are led by ex-con Danny Ocean who wants to get revenge on the man who is now dating is ex-wife, Tess.  The man just happens to be the owner of all three casinos.  This is an extremely entertaining film with an all-star cast.  Sure, the plot has holes in it, but that's not the point of the movie.  This was supposed to be an entertaining movie that was fun to watch.  With this kind of cast and still an excellent story, there's no way you can miss with this remake.
 George Clooney stars as ex-con Danny Ocean, the man seeking revenge from his past.  His ex-wife is played by Julia Roberts who is now dating casino owner Andy Garcia.  Ocean's team consists of Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Carl Reiner, Bernie Mac, Scott Caan, Elliot Gould, Casey Affleck, and in a very funny role, Don Cheadle.  This was a great cast for a really fun movie to watch.  The movie effectively shows how impossible it is to rob a casino with all the high tech security that is used.  The actual heist is probably the best part of the movie with plenty of action and humor.  The DVD is very good with several mini documentaries, two feature length commentaries, widescreen presentation and several trailers all included.  For a fun couple of hours check out Ocean's Eleven for a good time!",1055203200,2,1439,4.3977272727272725

No, this isn't the guest list to an Oscars afterparty, it's the cast of Ocean's Eleven. Add to the list Bernie Mac, Elliot Gould, Carl Reiner and bit parts from Josh Jackson, Holly Marie Combs and Topher Grace, and you have arguably the greatest line up assembled in modern times.
Give such a cast a great script, great filming locations and the best storyline in an action flick for years and you have yourself a winner!
Oceans Eleven is the cover of the 1960s classic starring the original rat pack of Sinatra, Martin and Davis Jnr., and revolves around eleven guys lead by Clooney and Pitt attempting to rob three of Las Vegas' biggest casinoes, all of which share one very sophisticated money vault.
A great movie, with an unmissable twist at the climax that will have you laughing at how amazing it is, and this DVD offers brilliant sound and picture quality.
The extras are good, but not great, although they don't need to be, as the movie itself is one you will find yourself watching over and over. The piece on the costumes used in the film is suprisingly good, and helps you appreciate how much work goes into a Hollywood blockbuster like Ocean's Eleven. It is interesting when you watch the film again to see how much the clothes do say about the characters after learning that there is really more to dressing an actor than the average viewer thinks.
A five star cast and plot makes Oceans Eleven one of the best DVDs available, and a must for any fan of action movies.",1054944000,,1520,4.591911764705882
506297,5,6302712017,"The first time I saw Oceans Eleven, I wasn't that impressed - granted, I was watching it on an 11 hour international flight on a small screen...
Upon repeated viewings (and being somewhat more alert!) the film grew on me AND my husband, who immediately went out and bought the soundtrack (which is GREAT).  As has been stated in previous reviews, there IS a place where the plot has a pretty big hole - also the ending is not all that satisfactory IMO.  I don't like doing spoilers, so I'll just say it was the very last shot before the credits.  Who wins??
The cast is uniformly excellent, with the POSSIBLE exception of Julia Roberts - but she's never 'sparked' for me anyway, so it might be a personal preference.  I can't think of anyone else to put in the role of Tess.  I LOVE all the ""bad Guys"" - they are all wonderful - some hilarious moments from the young actors who play the Utah brothers...George Clooney I believe is the successor of Clark Gable in his good looks and presence.

506299,1,6302712017,"This movie has to be one of the worst pictures of all time. I knew after seeing the original I'd probobly be dissappointed, but I was in for a shock. This movie is truly horrid. First of all, in a crime caper YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LIKE TO ROBBERS.
In this stinker, I find myself actually rooting for the Casino!. None of the characters are likeable, these guys are just a bunch of jerks out to steal money. How could the director forget this simple idea?
If you've ever been to vegas, there are enough holes in the plot to drive a truck through. In fact , the original oceans's eleven plot was more believable than this movie. The only thing is that in the original movie, everyone knew that the caper was a gag. The movie never pretended to be serious. Plus, you were actually rooting for the robbers in the original. The sequel, in which the plot is supposed to be serious, is so laughable that it's not funny.
What made the original movie so great was the ending. (I won't spoil it if you haven't seen it). In this movie they have to do the stupid Hollywood movie cliche of the last 20 years, that the bad guys get away with the caper. Everything is resolved in the end. Everyone is happy. Make me puke.
If anyone saw ""The Big Chill."", they will know what I'm trying to say. In that dog, the characters have these tremendous unresolved emotional conflicts.  They conviently settle these complex emotional conflicts by fornicating with each other before they have to go home. Everyone is happy. What vapid film making.
At least the Big Chill had some good performances. I especially liked Kevin Costner's.
If you really want to see a good movie, get the DVD version of the original.
Sadly there is going to be a sequel to this movie. As one famous wag commented, ""No one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public.""

506301,1,6302712017,"Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jnr, Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop. If those names aren't impressive enough try this on for size - 11 guys, 5 casinos, and 15mins to liberate millions of dollars. A plan that was destined to fail, one would think. Danny Oceans clan devised the plan, made away with the money and there was no double cross - everything you would expect from a movie with a scheme as risky as that. It was the perfect plan, or was it? Just when you are expecting the credits to role, a final act of greed saw virtue step in, and see them lose everything. A welcomed twist. If it were indeed that easy to rob casinos, everyone would do it. This is the sensation I felt from the remake of Oceans 11. Clooney, Pitt, Damon and company make it all seem so easy. You waltz in, take the money and live the high life - no questions asked. A scheme of that calibre cannot be as easily achieved as the remake suggests. Yes, it is just a movie, however, there is a wonderful, delightful thing called reality. Reality has to kick in, in movies sometime doesnt it? Or did I just expect too much?
The remake of Oceans 11 is everything Rat Pack fans feared: a cold, modern, revisionist take on the original plot with no semblance of classic cool or even any references to the Rat Pack - it is nothing more than another contemporary ego-driven franchise which bears no resemblance to the source it steals from. It is obviously trying to appeal more to mainstream fans than to hardcore Rat Pack loyalists, however I am sure that their intention was to draw in both crowds. As with ""Psycho"" this popular cynical marketing scheme backfired, totally missing both the demographic that cherished the original and the younger generation who are ignorant of it.
Remaking THE Rat Pack film without the Rat Pack is not only a stupid career move for all involved, it is a rip off of a legacy to which these bland contemporary stars did nothing to contribute, and it robs modern moviegoers of an original ensemble project that is purely a product of our times, not a warmed over take on a previous era's iconic time capsule. The main difference between the original cast and the modern cast is simple: Frank, Dino, Sammy and company were cool and stylish in real life; George, Brad, Matt, Julia and others are acting cool and stylish, which is boring and empty.
The advertisement for the remake asks, ""Are you in or out?' I am definitely out due to disgust at how they have mangled the reputation Oceans 11 upheld for so many years.",1050624000,6,2525,4.5152838427947595
506302,4,6302712017,"Ocean's Eleven is a witty, stylish movie about a grand theft.  It is perfect entertainment - fun, energetic, simple but not stupid, and witty through and through.
George Clooney has much to do with the success of the film.  This is easily the best vehicle for Clooney's non-challante charisma and he does the best of it.  Constantly clever on his feet, Clooney is always likeable.
Daniel Ocean (Clooney) is released from jail, and decides to rob not one, not two, but three Casinos at the same time.  For that he recruits a large group of professional thieves, from Computer experts to a Chinese rubber man.  The large and excellent cast remains for the most part in the background, with only Ocean's friend Rusty (Brad Pitt) being a substantial part of the film.  The rest get at best a couple of meaty scenes.  This is not, however, a disadvantage - Ocean's Eleven simply moves too fast for more than the bare essentials in terms of character development.  Still, the fine, fine writing and even better acting ensures that the entire cast is memorable, with Carl Reiner particularly impressive as Saul Blum.
The plot gets more complicated, because the villain, Casino owner Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia, in a surprisingly weak performance from an otherwise fine actor) is now dating Ocean's ex wife Tess (Julia Roberts).  This leads to the predictable scenes when Tess tells Danny she won't go back to him, and to the inevitable kiss at the end of the movie, when she does.  All very formulaic, but also very watchable - again, fine acting, directing and even dialogue manages to keep the Schmaltz level to minimum.
The great robbery proceeds head on with all the expected twists and turns, rarely truly surprising but constantly keeping you on your toes - you're never entirely certain what will happen next.]
I can whole heartedly recommend Ocean's Eleven as one of the finest of its genre - pure entertainment, fast paced, sexy and thoroughly enjoyable without insulting your intelligence.",1048636800,,1993,4.904761904761905

Outstanding performances by George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon and Andy Garcia all make this film a resounding success!  This movie is just plain old good fun!
The premise:
George Clooney plays Danny Ocean, the ""idea"" man who apparently made a mistake five years ago and ended up in prison.  We begin the movie with him just being released from prison on parole.  He immediately starts looking up his friends; for he has a plan for what he hopes is a successful heist of several million of dollars from three different Las Vegas casinos.  For me the part that was highly entertaining was the early part of the movie where George Clooney and Brad Pitt's characters were gathering their pals for the heist.  This whole ""gathering"" is more or less clich for this type of movie, but it was done well.  All of this culminating into an extremely well done robbery of a Las Vegas Casino vault, that is very suspenseful as you just don't know if they're going to be successful or not.
Overall this film very well done and I would highly recommend to any and all fans of this type of film.  {ssintrepid}",1047168000,4,1373,4.613168724279835

But it was, and whatever was left behind was left there for good reason.  The idea and the story did survive however, and thank goodness Steven Soderberg took it upon himself to deliver this burst of pure fun and joy.
The list of actors alone is enough to raise the eyebrows of film-buffs and casual movie-goers alike.  George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Julia Roberts are certainly well known for their abilities to carry movies themselves.

506384,4,6302712017,"They may be a modern-day version of the famous 'Rat Pack', this cast of the remake of ""Ocean's 11"".  There is just such a smooth 'coolness' that emanates from this movie that they viewer can't help but enjoy it.  In an era where film studios and directors try to smash the audience over the head with what they think the audience should think is popular and cool, it's refreshing to see a movie that lets its 'cool' develop on its own.  Director Stephen Soderbergh to a break from such serious, award-winning movies as ""Traffic"" and ""Erin Brockovich"" to direct this film that was essentially a recreational activity with a group friends with names such as Pitt, Damon, Clooney, and Roberts.

  The plot of ""Ocean's 11"" centers on a plan by con-man Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his partner-in-crime Rusty (Brad Pitt) to pull off biggest heist in Las Vegas history: the seizure of $150 million from a secure vault that services three of Vegas' biggest casinos.  This does present itself as an easy task to accomplish.  In a humorous aside, the man who will be financing this heist (played by Elliott Gould) tells Ocean and Rusty about the three most successful heist attempts in Las Vegas history.  Each one failed to make it past the security and each one incurred some major injury in the process.  These were the most SUCCESSFUL heists(!), and now Ocean is trying to break into the most secure vault this side of Fort Knox.  Obviously, in order to pull of this caper, many players will need to be involved and have to ply their respective skills in order to make this plan work.  However, beyond just the security issues, there are a couple of issues that put this plan in jeopardy.  #1: The casino vault is controlled by ruthless casino owner Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) who, when crossed will ""kill you, then he'll go to work on you"".  #2: Ocean's motives seem suspect when it becomes known to Rusty that Ocean's former wife, Tess (Julia Roberts) is now the girlfriend of Benedict.  Is Danny committed to the success of the heist or will he compromise everything to show up Benedict in an attempt to get Tess back?

  Clooney continues to develop into a top-notch leading man by improving on the smoothness he first demonstrated in earlier Soderbergh film, ""Out of Sight"".  He brings a swagger to the screen that is reminiscent of Sinatra's 'Rat Pack' days.  Garcia is perfectly cast as the menacing Benedict in this film.  The viewer can taste the venom dripping off every word he utters.  The performances of Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Brad Pitt, Bernie Mac, and Elliott Gould add a degree of panache to the proceedings.  The Asian actor who played the contortionist was a unique 'twist' (no pun intended).  The Malloy brothers, played by Casey Affleck and Scott Caan don't really bring much to the screen other than there juvenile bickering, but they are necessary to plot.  The one truly disappointing performance is turned in by Julia Roberts as Tess Ocean.  Roberts seems like she has very little to do here other than pose as window dressing and upbraid Danny for being a 'bad boy'.  I don't know if it was just the material are just a poor performance, but an actress of Roberts' caliber shouldn't fail to register in a movie like this.  That gripe aside, though, ""Ocean's 11"" is as good a time as one can have at the movies.  If only more 'fun' flicks like this could be made.",1043625600,2,3404,4.673949579831933
506385,4,6302712017,"""Ocean's Eleven"" is a Ferrari of a movie: cool, stylish, and classy. And if, like a Ferrari, it doesn't always work, that's OK - who will complain when it's so stylish?
The premise is lifted right out of the 1960 Rat Pack original: Danny Ocean (George Clooney, suave as hell) is released from prison, and plots to steal over $163 million from the vault of a Las Vegas casino during a heavyweight fight. He recruits his old buddy Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), and they put together a dream team of crooks, each of whom has a specialty. There's a computer geek, a demolition expert, a con man, a pickpocket, and so on.
And, of course, there's Danny's ex-wife, Tess (Julia Roberts), who's now involved with the manager (Andy Garcia) of the casino Danny intends to rob. So, Danny's not only after money - he wants his girl back as well. But she's having nothing of it, as evidenced by this neat dialogue piece:
Danny: ""I've paid my debt to society.""
Tess: ""Funny, I haven't gotten my check yet.""
Dialogue like that is one of the great pleasures of this movie; watching it delivered by the likes of Clooney, Roberts, Pitt and the stellar supporting cast (Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Elliott Gould, et al) is the other.
And, in fairness, it's a good thing that the dialogue and acting is so good, because as a pure caper flick, ""Ocean's Eleven"" is, to be charitable, a little thin. In the best caper movies (""The Heist"" comes to mind), the theft itself is the star of the movie - the intracicies, the backup plans, the intrigue. In ""Ocean's Eleven,"" we're expected to believe that a casino with over $150 million in its vault wouldn't have a backup power generator, or that the vault's security system wouldn't have a motion sensor.
But criticisms like that are akin to nitpicking that red Ferrari 575 because it has a small trunk - the point isn't realism, it's style, and like a Ferrari, ""Ocean's Eleven"" has it in droves.",1043193600,79,1922,4.590116279069767

The nearest beach on the Atlantic was a four-hour drive east, to Ocean City, MD, and vacationing there was known as going Danny Ocean. Curiously, that is the name of the title character (George Clooney) in this remake of the 1960 Rat Pack film, Ocean's Eleven. My little bit of trivia was about the most interesting thing going on in my mind while watching this technically perfect but soulless film.
There's nothing wrong with the plot; the plot is brilliant and perfectly set up. There just aren't any surprises. Danny Ocean, just released from prison, collects colleagues for his biggest heist: cleaning out the vault shared by three Las Vegas casinos: The Bellagio, the Mirage and the MGM Grand. All three are run by a precise and ruthless manager, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), who just happens to have stolen Danny's girl (Julia Roberts). His fellow conmen-thieves include Linus (Matt Damon), Rusty (Brad Pitt), brothers Virgil and Turk (Casey Affleck, Scott Caan), Rueben (Elliott Gould), Saul (Carl Reiner), Basher (an uncredited Don Cheadle), and a gymnast named Yen (Shaobo Qin), among others. Through clever misdirection, they pull off a masterful crime - in fact, everyone gets what he wants in the end.
Except the audience, that is. As much as the story unfolds with clockwork precision, I found myself wishing I were watching human characters rather than Swiss movement. Director Steven Soderbergh, who has had a string of excellent films - Solaris (2002), Traffic (2000), Erin Brockovich (2000), Sex, Lies and Videotape (1989) - is undone by the intricacies and loses sight of the human element. Amid all of this talent, there is just nobody to care about. Andy Garcia's character was one-dimensional.

506444,4,6302712017,"Steven Soderbergh's ""Ocean's Eleven"" is a triumph of pure style over substance, which is a change for the talented director.  The film is about Danny Ocean(George Clooney), a con man just released from jail who gets his old gang back together to hit three Vegas Casino's in one night.  Along for the heist are Brad Pitt as Oceans old partner Rusty Ryan, Matt Damon as the new guy, Bernie Mac as a fellow con artist, and various others who's specific talents will help them pull off the crime of the century.  Rounding out the cast are Andy Garcia as Terry Benedict, owner of the three casinos Ocean plans on hitting, Elliot Gould as a rival to Garcia and bankroller of the heist, and Julia Roberts as Ocean's ex-wife and Garcia's new main squeeze.
The plot is basic: The guy's have one night to do the job, and everything depends on each member's ability to play their role to perfection.  As long as the movie is focused on the heist, it is a joy to watch, exciting, funny, and full of twists and turns.  It only falters in the Julia Roberts subplot.  Ocean wants her back, she hates him, he tries to win her heart, etc.  The film loses focus in these scenes, as it's hard to believe that Ocean was ever married to Robert's character, and Julia Roberts has no range as an actress, so her development throughout the film is sort of a joke.  But no matter, the film is mainly about the heist, and it is wonderfully pulled off.
Soderbergh makes all of his film's his own, often polishing the screenplay and always acting as his own cinematographer.  So you can tell he had a blast with this one, with flashbacks, quick cuts, and a very stylized use of the camera.  His direction is pitch perfect for the film, and it is a wonder how he can switch gears and then film something like Full Frontal or Solaris, which are so totally different in tone and style.
Clooney is great as the always calm and collected Danny Ocean, Brad Pitt hasn't had this much fan with a role since Fight Club, and Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner have fun with their roles as well, with Reiner playing a master of impersonation one last time and gould hamming it up as an old-school Vegas hand.  Garcia's Terry Benedict is also pitch perfect, a rich, sadistic Vegas tough guy who can be cool one minute, angry the next
The film is loads of fun to watch and re-watch, as you figure out who did what when, and spot a few plot holes, which thankfully don't detract from the plot too much, unless you know alot about EMP.  Soderbergh obviously wanted a fun project, and the screenwriter and actors gave him one.

506446,4,6302712017,"Of the three heist films to come out this year (the other two being The Score and Heist), this is far and away the king of them all! An all-star cast glides smoothly through Steven Soderbergh's perfectly-edited, beautifully shot remake of the 1960 Frank Sinatra snoozer, one that is unmistakably modern but delightfully sports a classy fifties Vegas-Rat Pack feel that is impossible to resist. George Clooney is a thief fresh out of prison who decides to try and win back his ex-wife (Julia Roberts) by gathering eleven other robbery experts in various fields and ripping off three casinos belonging to her new boyfriend (Andy Garcia); naturally he insists that it's all about the money, but cohort Brad Pitt knows better. Pitt is excellent as the right-hand man, a smooth operator who puts the whole group together and helps him lead them through a ...robbery in one of the most complex security systems ever seen on film. Though Clooney's suave style is what heads up the entire operation, it is Pitt's strength that the film really leans on for support, and he outdoes himself with immeasurable ease. Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Elliott Gould, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner and especially Don Cheadle all perfectly round out the cast, and Soderbergh's direction is, as usual, infallible. Only low grades go to Roberts, who is so wonderful to see here working for the man who directed her to an Oscar, but it takes effort to really see her in the part even while you're watching her play it. Yet another victory for the indefatiguable director.",1041984000,,1551,4.878787878787879

Brad Pitt looks like he regrets agreeing to join this mess. There is no chemistry between any of the actors. The dialogue is trite, stale, and lazy. The photography is mediocre and the settings are cliched. One dreary scene follows another, to be followed in turn by another, and then another. Nothing crisp, nothing fresh, nothing original. ""Ocean's 11"" is a very weak echo of the wonderful caper movies of the 1960s. If Soderbergh doesn't like caper movies, then why did he bother to remake the genre's quintessential example? Is this really the director who made ""The Limey"" and ""Traffic""? Hard to believe. Avoid ""Ocean's 11"".",1041465600,2,779,5.09375

No amount of understated pinache was too much for director Steven Soderbergh - the ultra-trendy costuming, the casting of Hollywood's most groovy ""it"" guys, the hip and funky soundtrack, and Vegas, baby, Vegas.  It all adds up to the most stylish and enjoyable movie in years.  It's as if they took the best of Rat Pack swank and injected it with 21st Century growth hormones.  Somehow Soderbergh manages to perfectly balance all this groovy glam with steady camera work and solid storytelling and ends up with a film with great style, substance, and super-confident modesty.
How could you go wrong with this cast?  Clooney, Damon, Garcia, Pitt, Affleck, Caan, Cheadle, Gould, Mac, Reiner, Roberts... each one very successful in their own right somehow manage to ""play nice"" and work as a fabulous ensemble.  When given camera time each character shines, and Soderbergh juggles their scenes expertly allowing each to bring their flash and pinache to embellish the story with flair.

It was especially great to see Carl Reiner play the emotional center of the film as an aged con man making a come back one last time for the biggest caper of his life.
The story is partly a revenge story - Danny Ocean (Clooney doing a Cary Grant type role) is planning to rob 4 casinos owned by the man (Andy Garcia) who is dating his beloved ex-wife, Julia Roberts. He recruits a crew, lays out the plan, and executes it perfectly. There are many fun moments such as the scene where Brad Pitt teaches television celebrities - all recognizable stars - how to play poker. The audience roots for Clooney and Reiner all the way.
I saw this film in the theater and left happy and satisfied until I realized a major plothole.
Don't read the rest of this if you don't like spoilers!
How did they get the bags of fake money into the vault so that the security guys could take it out and think they had the real money? Hello? I listened to both audio tracks - the one with the actors and the one with the director, and the director did admit to the plothole but just thought no one would catch it - he sure didn't until right before production and then it was too late.
I also didn't buy into the fantasy of a billionaire letting some con man get away wtih ripping him off, content with just letting his stooges follow him and get lost. In the real world, Andy Garcia's character would have had George Clooney's Danny Ocean killed and everyone he knew killed no problem.
The movie also did not translate well to the small TV screen. Much of the finer moments were blurred, nicely subtle on the big screen, almost completely lost on the small screen.
The audio track with the actors talking, well, even though I like all of the actors and eagerly listened, I have to say this is probably the 2nd most boring audio track I've listened to. All they do throughout the entire movie is pat each other on the back for the great job they did, and compliment everyone they worked with. I'm glad they had a great time, but couldn't they have shared the details we WANT to hear? Like mistakes, what was really happening while the scene was being filmed, etc? (the most boring audio track I've heard is director Emmerich's to ""The Patriot."")
I buy DVD's not only for their higher quality but to get those extra features. In this case the extra features weren't worth much. It's still a very fun popcorn movie, finely crafted with a great ensemble cast, and I really love con game and caper movies, but this is no ""The Sting.""",1041206400,,2688,4.432323232323232

506503,4,6302712017,"Director, Steven Soderbergh is one of the few director's today, who has both the clout, respect and talent to get a superstar cast together (and forgo their multi-million dollar salaries) and actually being able to pull it off by making a good movie. His remake of the '60s Ratpack, film vehicle, ""Ocean's Eleven"" does just that, with the operating word being 'fun'. This movie is in the genre known as the 'caper picture'. The whole fun of the 'caper picture'is watching how a complicated plan unfolds to pull off some criminal endevor. In this case the plot revolves around recently released thief, Danny Ocean, (wonderfully played with a wink by George Clooney)who has an audacious plan to knock off three Las Vegas casinos, all at once. He and his buddy, Rusty(played by Brad Pitt) put together a motley crew of experts (which include actors, Matt Damon, Elliot Gould, Carl Reiner, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac) each of which has a field of expertise (demolitions, survelliance, cons etc.)Its sort of like the ""Dirty Dozen"" minus one. Once the 'crew' is in place, the viewer gets to lay back and watch the convuluted plan unfold. Our heroes go head to head with a rather cold, nasty, casino boss(Andy Garcia), who also happens to be dating Danny's beautiful ex-wife (Julia Roberts). No, this movie isn't going to win any Academy Awards like some of Soderberg's other film vehicles such as ""Traffic"" and ""Erin Brokovich"". And it dosn't have the critical acclaim like his ""Sex, Lies and Videotape"". But, what drives this movie is just good old fashion F-U-N. The light hearted, script is well written (at least for Hollywood Blockbuster standards) and constantly keeps the viewer guessing what will happen next. The actors play their roles rather 'tongue in cheek' and they have loads of chemistry together (especially Clooney and Roberts).The cinematogrphy is a cut above the usual and some of the hotel scenes remind me of Soderbergh's other great 'caper' picture, ""Out of Sight"". A special mention should also be made for the jazzy, pulse pounding score which seems to help propel the movie's action.

To be sure, this film is chock-full of cliches- the Las Vegas heist, the smoothly dressed, sophistocated yet sensitively in love criminal, the fast-walking, cigar smoking casino owner - you get the point!!!
  Still, this movie had no pretensions of ""deepness"" and every pretension of entertainment of the highest order and that is what we get. First, the cast is not only brilliant (Clooney, Pitt, Damon, Reiner, Cheadle) but their chemistry is phenomenal- especially that between Brad Pitt, Geoerge Clooney, and Matt Damon. Second, the direction and script are sophistocated and flowing. Really, there are no weak points in either (aside from a few logical inconsistencies in the plot's technicalities but it takes quite a while to get hold of those.) Another strong point in an already strong film is the music. This soundtrack alone deserves five stars and since Oceans 11's release, I've heard other films use some of the music composed for this one (especially the thing with the horns at the end of the hiest.)
  Get some popcorn, mix up a 'rusty nail,' (just don't eat and drink these together, alright?) and pop this in for a really good time. You will certainly not regret watching ""Oceans 11.""",1040083200,,1311,4.865470852017937

506557,4,6302712017,"Back in 1989 when Stephen Soderbergh triumphantly arrived on the movie scene with the multi-award winning debut movie Sex, Lies and Videotape the world seemed at his feet. Then followed 9 years of relative obscurity before the release of the excellent 'Out of Sight', starring Jennifer Lopez and George Clooney. Since then of course Mr Soderbergh's career has gone from strength to strength with critical and popular acclaim for Traffic and Erin Brockovich, not to mention the small matter of Oscar recognition.
So what of 'Oceans Eleven', the star-studded remake of the 1960 Frank Sinatra/Rat Pack picture? Well, first off, when it was announced as Soderbergh's next movie, it certainly seemed like an odd choice. The original movie was after all, by all apparent accounts, (to put it kindly) not that good and it was generally felt that it had been something of a vanity project for Old Blue Eyes. Then of course details of the cast started to emerge, and what a cast it is, which includes; George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle (with a silly and pointless English accent), Elliot Gould and in a cameo appearance, world boxing champion Lennox Lewis. Surely the combination of Soderbergh, Clooney, Roberts, Pitt et al could not miss, could it?
The story revolves around Danny Ocean (George Clooney), a career criminal who has just emerged from a stretch in jail (cooly wearing a blue tuxedo, of course) and his attempts to put together a crew (of eleven) to rob three Las Vegas casino's. Not only is it his aim to spirit away $80m from a seamingly impenetrable vault but all this is to be achieved whilst wooing back his ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts) who is dating the sleazy casino owner Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). To help in achieving this aim Danny contacts old friend Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), and gets bank-rolled by an ex-Vegas tycoon (Elliot Gould), who has a personal grudge against Benedict. Together they form a crew including a Chinese acrobat (Shaobo Qin), and a Jewish con man (Carl Reiner). Precisely what everyone's role is in the heist and indeed the movie is not always clear and perhaps because of this Matt Damon kind of gets lost among the myriad of stars and Julia Roberts is only really required to smile and look good (which of course she does).
Much of the pleasure in this movie is seeing all the plans of the heist fall into place with the odd twist and turn. It also has plenty of humour to bring a smile to your face and although this may not be the most exciting heist movie you will ever see, it is none the less everything that that the original tried and failed to be; smart, stylish and quintessentially cool.",1035244800,2,2684,4.749464668094219

that said, this is NOT a movie that insults your intelligence either. i find it stimulating enough, thank you very much. not too mention that as a light-hearted flick it is quite clever! unfortunately i have not seen the original ocean's 11, and as such i can't compare both productions.
but what i do know is that i think this is a great movie, where all the characters were perfectly cast and i find the plot interesting. there are so many moments in the whole movie where you can't actually guess what is the real motives behind each of the character's behavior - only by the end of the movie we will realize the truth.
i think clooney is likeable as danny ocean, the man on parole who masterminded the whole heist stunt. we can't help but want him to get both the cash and the girl. brad pitt, is as usual plays the cool, slick and inscrutable rusty - the right hand man of ocean. somehow, rusty kinda reminded me of tyler durden, pitt's character in *fight club* - eventhough i can't pinpoint what actually made it so. one thing is sure though, rusty is uber-cool... bernie mac is also hilarious as the casino dealer.
i feel that many would disagree with me on this, but i don't think there was anythig exceptional about julia robert's character tess. granted, the movie is not so much about romance but about the heist so i guess it kinda fits the pattern. i can't help though but feel like her character seems under developed. andy garcia is also magnificient as the cold and distant benedict - the animosity between him and ocean is most palpable.
all in all, i find this a very good movie - exceptional casting, direction and photography. although the movie itself is not perfect, i think no one can argue that it is very entertaining. with that in mind, i salute soderbergh for yet another enjoyable movie...",1034553600,,2069,4.594594594594595

Jennifer Conolly of ""A Beautiful Mind"" might be, as are a few older retired/deceased actresses I might mention [Grace Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor and Audrey Hepburn come to mind.]  There isn't any chemistry between George Clooney and Julia Roberts either, which doesn't help any.

506595,3,6302712017,"When the high cost of top draw actor's salaries limits the number of big stars, any one movie can have, it's nice to see that the ""remake"" of Ocean's Eleven does succeed in gathering together a cast of some rather highly paid actors.  The ""all star cast"" includes George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, and Julia Roberts.  The second tier group of actors includes Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, and Hollywood veterans, Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner.  With such heavyweight talent, and a setting in Las Vegas, one might expect spectacular results, but they never quite materialize.  Director Steven Soderberg's production is a slick, and well-structured, yet superficial and lacking in passion and emotion.  The tale is well told, but never aims for, or touches the heart.
Low key, analytical, and in control, George Clooney, is Danny Ocean, the man with an audacious plan to rob the vault of the Bellagio casino.  Andy Garcia is Terry Benedict, the owner of the Bellagio, who's current love is Ocean's ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts).  Ocean's team is headed by Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), who does most of the recruiting, and oversees the elaborate operation.
Lack of passion?  Well, we don't really hate Benedict, the intended victim, who just comes off of as ultra competent.  Andy Garcia, plays his character as very straight and reserved.  Clooney, while a good actor, is not the ideal choice as a fiery romantic lead.  Julia Roberts is the lone female, and her performance is also subdued, rather than stunning.  What emotion there is, is mostly present in undertones.
The other performances are solid, but there just isn't any special chemistry to be found between any of them.  Pitt is steady, not flashy.  Don Cheadle's character ""Basher"" an electronics expert, uses unfamiliar English slang, to perhaps impart ""authenticity"", but it's more of a distraction (""naused?"").  Some performances do sneak up on you.  Carl Reiner, is wonderful, and scores big time, playing a rich tycoon to perfection.  And versatile Matt Damon, is the ""kid"" forced into a primary role, in the biggest job of his life.  Just a tip, no more shots of Elliot Gould with his shirt open,
If you are satisfied with just a smoothly-executed, and rewarding heist, then give this a chance.  There's not much suspense or humor however, and character development is minimal.  The focus is on the task at hand.  The music, adds to its slick feeling, keeping things light and flowing.  Oscar winning director Soderberg draws top stars to his projects, and making a lightweight ""fun"" picture is certainly no crime.",1032652800,,2585,4.990654205607477
506596,3,6302712017,"Many will say Steven Soderbergh is capable of much more than Ocean's Eleven, after such films like ""Traffic"" and ""Erin Brockovich"" he seems to be doing this for sport.  Being capable of such great things raises the bar to a higher level than comfort often permits, see ""The Color of Money"" which was by Scorsese.
Loosely based on the 1960 Rat Pack original OE is a stylish caper comedy appropriatey missing the tension of such action films as ""The Score"". The plan is to rob 3 Las Vegas casino's simultaneously, all owned by the ruthless Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is paroled from prison within 24 hours he already gets his plans underway with the help of his long time partner Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt).  Within days they recruit there old friends and some new ones to help them out, ending up with 11 hence the title.
All this is wonderfully entertaining but a bitshallow, the movie is a stylish exercise and little more.  The film though, lends itself well to the casino's almost visceral style and color, with great use of music and detail.  The dialogue will have you grinning with it's wit and cleverness.

506646,4,6302712017,"I have to agree with what another reviewer said regarding this not really being much of a remake of the original movie of the same name that starred the so-called rat-pack of Sinatra and friends. Indeed, the topography of Las Vegas has changed so much since the making of the original film that even using the same set of circumstances likely didn't make much sense, either. What does remain of the plot is that it is, like the original, a superb caper film that uses the casino backdrop to the sequences in a buddy-film employing a pantheon of current box-office draws.
Thus, we have George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and the intriguing Don Cheadle as the team of thieves who are attempting to rob three casinos by cracking the super-vault all three use. This is a wisecracking and fun-loving band of bad-... buddies, and the repartee is the thing. There is plenty of gadgetry and quick plot twists to keep the action moving and the dialogue flowing, and we even have a conniving Julia Roberts as Oceans still-provocative ex-wife.
The cast is key to the movies success, and Clooney is especially good as the sardonic, charming, and smooth operator who can handle everything life throws his way with good cheer and a good dose of old-fashioned bravado. Brad Pitt is also excellent as the glue cementing together the technical details to make the scheme work, and although he is acting against type here, he is very good. Damon and Cheadle are also excellent, and the team works together very well as an ensemble act.  Although anyone familiar with caper films knows the ending is never really in doubt, and we are delivered to the conclusion with a rollicking good time and a sense that all is as it should be.

Pitt, Clooney, Garcia, Roberts and Damon all give excellent perfomances and I haven't even mentioned the supporting actors like Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner and the always talented Don Cheadle. There are also some very terrific cameos by Topher Grace, Barry Watson, Joshua Jackson and more.
  The Movie Starts with Daniel Ocean (Clooney) leaving prison after having been there for four years. He Finds Out where Rusty (Pitt)is workin (Hollywood) and Daniel feeds his Idea of robbing three casino's. They Get a Crew of 9 more guy's (which makes 11) who will participate with the heist. Linus (Damon) the rookie is my favorite character due to the fact that he is both cool and a little geeky in the way that he carries batteries around with him. The Casinos they choose to rob (The Mirage, The MGM Grand and The Bellagio) belong to Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) who is dating Tess (Julia Roberts), Daniel's ex-wife. He needs to trick Benedict in order to steal the money and his wife back.

First of all Julia Roberts played such a small role and had such few acting scenes that it could have been played by any pretty face. Matt Damon's part was equally as small and required perhaps a little more acting, but it still could have been played by any smooth, yet lesser known or even unknown actor. All of that said again the movie is actually quite good. Some of the best acting is done by Andy Garcia.
Here is the basic story...Daniel Ocean (George Clooney) was recently released from prison, and as he walks out, a plan that has been developing in his mind while in prison is ready to be carried out. First he must re-recruit his old team. First is Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), a cool headed card dealer who is currently teaching hollywood stars how to play poker. After recruiting Rusty, the two begin to plan their big heist...Three casinos in Las Vegas...The MGM...The Mirage...The Bellagio. All owned and operated by the ruthless Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). What the others don't know is that Daniel Ocean has more than just a monetary intrest in Terry Benedict. Benedict is also dating Ocean's ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts). So the question raised is can Daniel Ocean put aside his personal feelings and perform the job right?
Like I said the movie is very slick and very good. I was dissappointed probably by the fact that there are so many great names. I think I personally would have enjoyed it much more if the ""big"" names had been replaced by some unknowns.",1029715200,,1652,4.58445945945946

506709,3,6302712017,"Steven Soderbergh's remake of ""Ocean's Eleven"" is a stylish heist picture featuring some of the brightest stars in moviemaking today.  The cast includes George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, and Matt Damon from the A-list, as well as such established veterans as Andy Garcia, Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner in there playing along with them.  Coming right off the heels of two highly acclaimed, award-laden serious dramas (""Traffic"" and ""Erin Brockovich""), it's understandable that Soderbergh might have been in the mood for something a little lighter in tone right about now.  Well, he has certainly found it with this property, which sails along smoothly like a well-oiled machine, with no angst-filled messages or heavy-handed themes to gum up the works.
Taking the basic premise from the original 1960 film (which featured a who's-who of Hollywood stars of its own day), Soderbergh has updated it to reflect the advanced technological realities of the 21st Century.  In this film, recently paroled Daniel Ocean (Clooney) has decided to mastermind the robbing of not one but three major Las Vegas casinos all owned by the nefarious Terry Benedict (Garcia).  The rub is that Benedict has also recently added Ocean's ex-wife, Tess (Roberts), to his list of assets, which gives Ocean additional incentive to take Benedict for everything he's got. One of the amazing things is that the filmmakers use an actual casino as their target (the Bellagio) rather than devising a fictional one for their story's purpose.  One might think it could give certain audience members the wrong ideas.  Be that as it may, the director does a fine job exploiting the Vegas setting, taking us right into the heart of casino operations.
A film like ""Ocean's Eleven"" stands or falls on the charisma of its stars, the intricacy of its plotting and the plausibility of its actions.  Luckily for the audience, the film pretty much succeeds on all three counts.  Scenarist Ted Griffin does a fine job gathering together the men who will participate in the heist, allowing each a moment or two to define his character and to become part of the team.  The details of the plan itself are explained in very clear terms so that we rarely feel as if we are not able to follow the action.  There is even an inspired use of ""Clair de Lune"" near the end of the picture to lend an air of romanticism to the accomplishment, for who would deny that such large-scale thievery has often carried with it a certain element of idealism and romance?  After all, look how many books and films have featured robbers as heroes.  It perhaps explains why Tess can go from being a principled, law-abiding citizen at the beginning of the film to being an accomplice in crime at the end, all for the love of a man - and we cheer her for it.
Unlike in Soderbergh's other films, we do not find hidden depths lurking beneath the shining handsome surface of this movie, and we certainly carry no nutritious food for thought away with us from this film as we did from the others.  In fact, ""Ocean's Eleven"" is all ABOUT shining handsome surface and it makes no pretension of being about anything else.

506713,4,6302712017,"There is little question that OCEAN'S 11 is an entertaining film.  The cast headed by George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and a surprising Julia Roberts in a supporting role, bounce off each other in all the right places.  Clooney, fresh out of prison, plans to rob three casinos owned by Andy Garcia, and enlists the aid of Pitt, Damon, Elliot Gould, and Carl Reiner, each of whom has unique skills for the heist.  This movie does not pretend to explore the motivation of the crooks nor does it show any meaningful evolution of character.  The one attempt at character development is between Clooney and his ex-wife Tess, who is now Andy Garcia's girlfriend.  This connection between Clooney and Roberts falls flat and does even have the sparkle that exists between Garcia and Clooney when Garcia finds out that he is being had.  This movie has one point: to show how a security-conscious casino can be robbed for millions while all the while doing so amidst the sparkling glitter of Las Vegas.  There is a certain perverse attraction in seeing how Clooney accomplishes this.  Director Stephen Soderbergh manages to heighten suspense by withholding until the last minute needed plot contrivances to make it all seem plausible.  Clooney and his gang pull the heist successfully and retire with their ill-gotten gains.  The problem with all this is one that Hollywood has had to reckon with since the gangster melodramas of Bogart's day. Is the purpose of crime films to entertain or to instruct? In the 30s, Hollywood was careful to emphasize the entertainment aspect with bravura performances by Bogart, Cagney, and Raft, but by the time the concluding credits started to roll, evil had to be punished and society had to be purged of the very personalities that the audiences paid to see in the first place. Today, Hollywood has abandoned its long-held role of guardian of public morality. In this film, at least, the bad guys seem not so bad.  They are attractive, articulate, intelligent, and resourceful.  Their target is a casino owned by Andy Garcia, who plays his role as if he were still the ascendant thug from GODFATHER III.  Garcia is the one with all the negative qualities.  He even agrees to dump Julia Roberts if by so doing he can get his millions back.  What is lost in the glitter of attractive people breaking the law is the realization that morality is a relative concept, and that if one wishes the key to the executive bathroom, then lifting it from its rightful owner's pocket is quite all right. This is the not so subtle message and I fear that a youthful audience will only be too willing to embrace it.",1027468800,,2632,4.77924944812362

What I like about it is that it never took itself seriously.  However, the supposed love between Danny Ocean and his ex-wife Tess is utterly unbelievable.  No chemistry between them and no playful confidence and intelligence in Julia Roberts, either.  If I were the casting director, I'd pick Cate Blanchett as Tess, because she is sophisticated, altra-cool (in matching with the male cast), stylish, and smartly funny and playful, so to win the attention of a master thief and a wealthy, powerful, being-there-done-that owner of a mega gambling group.",1027296000,,729,5.1440677966101696

Hats off to Clooney, Pitt and Garcia for their strong work. Hats off and take a bow for Bernie Mac, he steals the movie in every time he opens his mouth.
This film works on the characterization and the actors chemistry, the story is a bit... there are some story holes, but you will overlook them because of the energy this film gives off.
Great commentary on the DVD as well. Soderberg keeps it VERY light, but he does slip in the informative tidbits if you're looking for an insight to how he directs, in regards to making your own projects better (if you're a filmmaker) - which is the reason for the breezey tone, I imagine.
Not as comprehensive a DVD presentation as the Criterion TRAFFIC, but that would be overkill for a film like this. Great fun, terrific filmmaking and electric performances, not much more to ask from a Hollywood film of the early 21st Century.",1026691200,3,1120,4.522167487684729

But this one...Fantastic! This group of eleven people were just so clever at their sneakiness! Brad Pitt is in his best role since 'Fight Club'.If you didn't know, he in eats in all but four scenes. Just pay attention and count the ones you see. This is Steven Soderbergh's best film next to 'Traffic'. Actually they are EQUALLY good. This film was so stunning. I especially liked how they robbed one of my favorite casinos...THE MGM GRAND. I stayed in Las Vegas once, and I think they had no errors in the geography of the city. I think they were right on the spot. This is now most likely on my top 5 favorites of 2001. The first one being 'Lord Of The Rings'. This is actually my second favorite (There weren't many good movies for 2001, sadly). If you ever want to buy this on DVD, get widescreen. It's WAY BETTER. I got this movie on friday and I've been watching it everyday. I think my favorite special feature is on the DVD-Rom (I have DVD on My Comp, Just to tell you). You play this game called 'In Or Out'. You do such things as crack a code, and play blackjack. The makers of this DVD are just simply brilliant! Hopefully, they will come up with an ULTIMATE DVD.

It's not an intellectual film, nor is it a film with tremendous character development or a powerful plot.  It's just a simple diversion, and it succeeds magnificently.  Don't watch this if your idea of entertainment is something from Cannes or Sundance; to use an analogy, this is more akin to one of those novels by the checkout lane in the grocery store than to something by Milan Kundera.

What struck me was the sophisticated air of the film. It suceeds where its 1960's predeccesor does not - it's very classy. Even though Clooney's character is a complete (fool), you can't help but love him.

Danny Ocean, portrayed by the increasingly handsome George Clooney, conceives a complex and risky heist of the super-secure Bellagio casino, not just as a means to enrich himself and a few friends, but to also wrest his ex-wife, played to the strutting hilt by Julia Roberts, from the villianous arms of casino owner Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia).  Aiding Clooney in his quest are such luminaries as Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Carl Reiner, Casey Affleck, Bernie Mac and my personal favorite, Don Cheadle, affecting a strikingly accurate Cockney accent.",1026345600,,759,5.007936507936508
506753,3,6302712017,"This is a slick and polished piece of entertainment fluff. It is a wholly plot driven movie, with little character development. George Clooney, as engagingly charming as ever, plays the character of Daniel Ocean, a thief, fresh out of prison. He, together with his good buddy, Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), assemble a team of like minded individuals, eleven strong, to pull a heist at a casino. This heist is to net them a total of one hundred and sixty three (163) million dollars, share and share alike. Ocean, however, also has another agenda with respect to the heist. It appears that his ex-wife, Tess (Julia Roberts), is hot and heavy with the casino owner, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), and he wants to win her back.
Well directed by Steven Soderbergh, the action seamlessly takes place, as each member of the team gears up for his part in this elaborate scheme. A cleverly executed and well orchestrated heist, the members of the team overcome and circumvent technologically driven, state of the art security. There is, however, a moral quandary. One finds oneself actually rooting for the bad guys, so charming a group are they, as a whole. The casino owner, on the other hand, comes across as a greedy, sinister gangster of sort, who seems to deserve what is to happen.
The all star cast, for the most part, gives excellent performances. Most notable are the performances of George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Carl Reiner, Matt Damon, and Andy Garcia. The least notable performance is that of Julia Roberts who, while devastatingly attractive, musters up as much energy as a clothing mannequin. The relationship between Daniel and Tess is less believable than the intricate, complex heist. All in all, however, if one is just looking for some light, fast paced entertainment, this is a film one will enjoy. Moreover, while I only liked the film moderately, it should be noted that my twenty year old twins loved it and would have awarded it five stars.

George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Julia Roberts, and Elliot Gould, among others, make the picture sparkle with superb acting, while excellent directing from Steven Soderbergh keeps the picture down-to-earth, funny, and interesting without losing the element of suspense.

The plot, based on the 1960 Rat Pack film of the same title, is equally good; the characters especially are well written and casted.  The Ocean's Eleven, as well as other main characters are unique and realistic, and very well interpreted by the cast.  Even the costumes used help to make the film unforgettable.

Definitely a firm recommendation for anyone who likes a good movie--this one's got it all, supense, humor, and action.  Just be careful while laughing on the edge of your seat; it tends to be dangerous.

But good things come to those who wait. After the first five minutes, be ready to go on the most exciting film ride other than LOTR and Harry Potter this year.
The protagonist is Danny Ocean (George Clooney) a former convict, who, after he tells his parole officers that he's gone clean, immidiately breaks his parole and starts planning the perfect crime--He plans to rob three casinos all owned by Terry Benedict, a very powerful and vindictive millionare, who also happens to be going out with Danny's ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts, who has definately looked better). Danny hooks up with Rusty (Brad Pitt) a man who teaches blackjack to celebrities. (a job that Danny himself used to do)Rusty helps in recruiting several people for the heist. among them are an exsplosives expert (Don Cheadle) a former casino owner with a grudge against Benedict (Elliot Gould), a retired con man, a rookie con man (Matt Damon), a contortionist, a surveilance expert, and a blackjack dealer (Bernie Mack).
I won't get into the complicated details of the setup of the safe our heroes plan to rob (it's too confusing, and, frankly, I don't remember a lot of them myself) but it basically calls to mind the old ""Mission Impossible"" TV shows.

I happen to think that George Clooney steals the show.  If you plan to watch the film, the ending makes the entire film worth it.  I don't want to spoil it, but it's really, really good!

Now, come on, that's impressive. Plus, Ocean's Eleven has another thing going for it- a great plot. It's an amazingly cool and complex tale of a man on parole who gets 10 men together and attempts to pull off a heist on three casinos. This movie made me laugh and worry and wonder.

506915,4,6302712017,"The 2001 release of Ocean's Eleven, produced by Jerry Weintrab and directed by Steven Soderbergh, is best described as a total makeover rather than a remake of the original 1960 release starring Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis, Jr. Other than the title character of Danny Ocean and a plan to rob a group of Las Vegas casinos with eleven people, very little of the original 1960 screenplay makes it into this version. That said however, this effort produced a far more entertaining film than its namesake.
In this outing, Danny Ocean, played by George Clooney, is an ex-con, who with buddy Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) plans to rob three Las Vegas casinos, all of which share a single undeground vault, and are all owned by one Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). But Ocean has another reason to chose Benedict as his target. Danny's ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts) is now with Benedict and he wishes to win her back. Danny and Rusty spend a few scenes recruiting a team of criminal specialists, (Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner, Elliot Gould, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Edward Jemison, Don Cheadle, Shaobo Qin) then they get down to the planning and setting into motion the crime of the century. The fun of this movie is watching how  can the eleven successfully rob Benedict's vault and whether Danny might somehow win back his girl.
Although there are a few sight gags that harken back to the original Ocean's Eleven (the house of cards on the diving board is one), the screenwriter Ted Griffin appears to get much of his inspiration from at least two other heist/con movies, 1973's ""The Sting"" starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford, and 1978's ""The Great Train Robbery"" written and directed by Michael Crichton and starring Sean Connery and Donald Sutherland (both of which are great movies by the way and available on DVD.) Several scenes in Ocean's Eleven appear to refer to these two earlier films (Danny's inital meeting with the pickpocket Linus Caldwell, played by Matt Damon, echoes the initial meeting between Connery and Sutherland in their film right down to the complementary ""Nice pull!!"") as well as much of the build up toward the heist and the characterization of Terry Benedict. Just as importantly, much of the humor of these two films as rubbed off onto this screenplay.
In fact, this version of Ocean's Eleven succeeds at what the original intended to do but often times failed, it really looks like a movie where the characters are having a good time, and the audience is invited to come along. The screenplay is not perfect, the scenes with Danny and Tess do not seem to blend into the story as well as it could, one sometimes wonders whether this subplot is really necessary. Some may not like the way the movie ends. However, the general plotline is excellent, the acting is first-rate and most audiences should enjoy this movie.
The reviewer screened the widescreen DVD of Ocean's Eleven, which has an excellent print that displays very well on a large widescreen television screen. It has five audio tracks (two English, one French, and two commentary) and a couple of ""Making of..."" documentaries that are of the usual variety.",1024790400,2,3159,4.85

506919,5,6302712017,"I saw Ocean's Eleven only recently, and I was completely blown away by it. Only a few scenes in, I told myself that I must own a copy of this movie, and everything I saw after that only reinforced that conviction
But I'm more than a little baffled by all of the negative reviews people have posted here. Having read maybe half of them, I have one thing I'd really like to say to everyone who's coming to give this movie a low rating because the plot is thin, shallow and/or unbelievable:
THIS IS A CAPER MOVIE.
The joy of a caper movie is watching the characters' plan take one wild turn after another, a tangled network of nifty gadgets, daring near-misses, hair-trigger timing, and ballsy cons, all the while slinging one-liners and picking fights with the villain and/or each other. There's no point in watching a caper movie for its deep, thoughtful, realistic plot, because it doesn't have one. What it has is style, wit, flash and sparkle, easygoing camaraderie, a sense of glorious immaturity in its thrills, and the sort of sharp left turns that, if you're in the proper spirit of the thing, should have you sitting straight up in your chair yelling gleefully at the screen, ""NO WAY!""
Ocean's Eleven has that. The heist plan loops in and out and around itself so many times expressly to allow for multiple fake-outs and to keep the watcher guessing. The whole point of the movie is to have some fun. The cast certainly seems to have done so. With the exception of Julia Roberts, who spends the entire movie seeming stilted and tense, all of the actors contribute to the movie's charisma. On the DVD's actor commentary from Andy Garcia, Matt Damon, and Brad Pitt, they say that the movie was very laid-back, easy, and fun to film, and it certainly seems that way to watch it.
The rest of the complaints, dealing mostly with pacing and dialogue, seem a matter of taste. Personally, I loved the dialogue, which was frequently delivered with such deadpan wit that what the characters *said* takes you by surprise. I dig the sort of sense of humor that comes up with lines like ""They've got enough armed security to occupy Paris!--Okay, bad example,"" makes Chinese acrobat Yan's single English line ""Where the **** you been?"", and lets Don Cheadle's character speak in Cockney rhyming slang.
If you want a deep movie, see a drama. Ocean's Eleven is a heist flick; it's all about audacity and flair, and it's got that in spades.",1024617600,,2430,4.653488372093023
506920,5,6302712017,"Okay I am 14 and this is the best movie in the world-""...we're in a whole lota rubble. Barney Rubble? Trouble!"" That's the best line.

506921,5,6302712017,"An exciting remake of the ""Rat Pack"" Film ""Oceans Eleven.""  George Clooney doesn't sing, but the acting and twists and turns and action scenes were tremendous.  I am usually critical of Hollywood's lame attempts at remakes, but this was very well done.

506922,5,6302712017,"George Clooney, Brat Pitt, Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Don Cheadle, Elliott Gould, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner, Edward Jemison and Shaobo Qin are all brought together in one of the best ensemble cast films I have seen in a long time.  That takes care of Ocean's Eleven (Danny Ocean played by Clooney) but they are matched against Andy Garcia & Julia Roberts.  Steve Soderbergh (Traffic; Sex, Lies & Videotape) directs a masterpiece of action/drama with some of the biggest names in the business.
The mystique of Vegas, the lure of cash and the romance of life make this a film for everyone.  Great dialogue, excellent dramatic shots from Soderbergh and incredible acting by the entire cast put most other crime based movies to shame.  Andy Garcia makes you hate him, you feel for George Clooney, but you also see the reasoning in Pitt's character and Reiner's performace is great too.
Anyway, if you enjoy the James Bond movies, the Mission Impossible movies, or any other fun action films, you should give Oceans 11 a chance.  DO NOT base your viewing of this on the original Sinatra and the Rat Pack film.  The only similarities are the ensemble cast, Vegas Casinos, money and the title of the movie.

Second, I really enjoyed the characters especially the individual fashion sense of each character (explained in a featurette on the DVD)
But the one thing that has troubled me about this movie was the ending.  And to confirm how I felt about the ending, listening to the director's commentary, it seems many people felt the same way.  It blew me away to hear the commentary of what if we could of reshot the ending and talking of how they wish they could of done it.  Hmmm...
Anyway, the DVD has a lot of good features in it and the plot was interesting but I felt with so many talented individuals, I was expecting more from this movie.  Anyway, it's an ok movie.

Can they pull it off?  And does Danny have an ulterior motive that might compromise the entire mission?
The movie itself is ok.  There are some funny scenes, and the actual robbery is very suspenseful.  Over all, it does seem to drag a little.  Tighter editing would have made for a better film.  The cast works well together, and it's obvious they're having fun making this movie.
My biggest problem with the movie, however, is that there is really no one for the audience to root for.  Our ""heroes"" are a group of thieves.  And the casino owner is way too ruthless to be sympathetic.  I honestly didn't care what happened either way.  Further more, none of the characters are really developed beyond very broad strokes.  Even if the characters were more honorable, I would have had a hard time caring for them.
It's unfortunate that these stars couldn't find a better film to star in.  One that would stretch their acting so we could come to care for the characters.  As is, I won't waist my time on this movie again.",1024358400,4,1196,4.553990610328638
506936,5,6302712017,"An assembly of a great cast (aside from Julia Roberts), good script, and interesting and humorous plot, Ocean's 11 is worth seeing. George Clooney's character, Danny Ocean, gets out of prison and immediately rounds up a team of ""experts"" to pull off the biggest heist in Las Vegas: rob 3 of the most profitable hotels owned by Andy Garcia's character, Terry Benedict, who just so happens to be courting/living with Ocean's ex-wife, Tess, played by Julia Roberts. Ocean still loves her and wants her back and comes up with a plan to not only get her back but get even with her new boyfriend by stealing all his millions. How he and his 11 do it is just ingenius.
Although I am not a fan of either George Clooney or Brad Pitt, I must say they put in some great performances. Clooney is suave as Danny Ocean and Pitt is the cool, fast-talking, scheming, and always eating Rusty Ryan. And they look very good in every scene, except for Pitt when he's the doctor (see the movie, you'll know what I mean). Carl Reiner is superb as Saul, the ""retired"" crimester living in Florida who becomes part of the gang of heisters when Rusty pays him a visit and offers him to be in on the plot. Also good is Matt Damon, the young and naive pick-pocketer whom Ocean selects as his 11th. But what I think really makes the movie effective are the lesser-known actors who make up the remaining 11. Very, very funny characters. And what's more, they're all believable and superbly cast. Except for Julia Roberts - she just doesn't pull it off as Tess. Roberts is not beautiful or sexy, and she can't even walk in those high heels! Michelle Pfeiffer or Sela Ward would have been a better choice.
Ocean's 11 has a lot of action-packed scenes with a lot of humor and great dialogue. I love the music, too - can't wait to get the soundtrack! Very enjoyable for adults but not recommended for kids under 21 (yes, 21) since the message is do anything to get back the one you love and do in the one who is with him or her AND get away with it. But notice what happens at the very end of the movie. Can't wait for the sequel to come out!

The characters were very well-played - despite the long list of big-name stars (George Clooney, Julie Roberts, Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, etc.), most of whom appear in small, supportive roles without which the story couldn't have been told successfully.

George Clooney and Brad Pitt basically phone their performance in, while Matt Damon runs over during the intermission. And for Pete's sake, if Julia Roberts grows any more teeth, they'll have to go vertical.

506940,4,6302712017,"I'd seen the original back when it was released.  My dad was a ""rat pack"" fan back then.  My daughter, who's in high school and into drama, asked about the original ""rat pack"" a couple of years ago and I rented Oceans 11 and we watched it.  Although I had fond memories of the flick, on seeing it again I realized it was a pretty lame movie--a lot of the ""action"" consists of the guys standing around hotel rooms with a drink in one hand, a smoke it the other, blabbering with one another.
The retelling of Oceans 11 results in a much better film.  Other than the underlying concept of ripping off the Las Vegas Casino's, there's not really much resemblance between the two flicks.  In point of fact, there's several functional differences.
First of all, there was no--and I mean zero--romantic interest in the original.  The Clooney-Roberts thing in the new one adds some intensity without detracting from the story.
One element the movies have in common is the character bankrolling the caper.  The new version handles this much better than the old.  In the previous version, that character was such a doofus you always wondered why someone didn't just shoot him and get it over with.
The caper itself is much more complex--and believable--in the newer version.  The older movies had a long segment where guys were spray painting doorknobs and such--pretty tame and boring as well.  This new version is anything but boring.
There is one really glaring lapse in the reimagining of this tale--the ending.  The ""surprise"" ending of the older flick had a lot to do with it's appeal--failure snatched from the jaws of success, as it were.  Obviously just recycling the old ending wouldn't have worked, but you'd think that a team that was so effective in reimagining the tale to current standards, technology and sensibilities could have come up with something more appropriate and true to the original.
That's the only real complaint.  The acting is good for an escape flick, everyone is obviously enjoying themselves in this effort, and the result is a fun, action packed and stimulating escapist film.  Perfect summer time viewing!",1024012800,,2131,4.8347107438016526

All the actors did a terrific job, as always.  The only waste of a character was Julia Roberts.  I think that they could have expanded on her role and made her character more interesting, and in the end, it would have made the movie better.
Steven Soderbergh does a good job behind the camera.  He set a tone throughout the movie and stuck to it.  It brilliantly unfolded before your eyes with only a few small glitches.  I didn't like the story line between George Clooney and Julia Roberts.  It made the movie more of a cliche.

From the perfectly matched jazzy music of the larger film, to the elegance of Dubussy's ""Claire de Lune"" woven throughout, the film truly boasts a unique attention to musical style as a means to convey a central aspect of the atmosphere of this film.
The characters themselves seem perfectly fitted to their roles as well. Although, as one reviewer correctly points out, the film does not contain ""action"" persay, the lack of this aspect is more than made up for in the expertly defined character creation and witty script. The dexterity of this cast in character acting is dauntless, which is probably a good thing considering the clout of the names in this film in the acting world.
The plot, although perhaps far-fetched in areas, is really quite complex, and demands respect for the minds who were TRULY capable of creating such an intricate screenplay.
Although the film is, and never will be, an award winner, I must assert that this is the greatest and most cleverly designed purely entertaining movie to come out of Hollywood in quite some time. Soderbergh has it!",1023580800,,1436,4.841463414634147
506998,4,6302712017,"""OCEAN'S ELEVEN"" is smart, funny, and satisfying. It's storyline is complex and fastpaced. The movie's casting was excellent too. but something bothered me. I haven't seen the original, but it seemed that some material in the movie was something that has been completely overused, and it made the moment seem awkward. But that's just my opinion.
Anyways, I only saw it in the theater, but the special features on the DVD look kind of interesting. I might want to rent it someday. But if you go off and buy ""OCEAN'S ELEVEN"" I am sure it is worth it.",1023408000,,548,4.6020408163265305
506999,4,6302712017,"Pros:
The new version of the hit ""rat pack"" movie OCEANS ELEVEN kicks [rear]! This movie is awesome, the plot is a little out rageous, but they pull it off, and its not what your expecting. It just keeps you on the edge till the last 5 min of the movie..awesome ending!
But your like oh my goodnes! when are they coming out with a new one?!?!? Although it finishes this story..your like..what are they gonna do now? The movie finishes in the way that you know there is gonna be a sequel, and i believe its box office success secures that.
Pitt and Clooney (dont take this the wrong way) work so well together on screen, its like you want them together all the time, cause they're hilarious..almost like geere and roberts..just not in that way! I actually saw this movie for Damon, and i honestly thought he would steal the movie, but no, brad did..when he dressed up like a doctor is when i lost it.
Cons
One of the things (not a major deal) is that characters (ecspecially pitt) would just disapear from the movie for a while, and trust me, pitt could've been in this movie more!
This movie is awesome, and THE MOVIE get's 5 stars, and if i was reviewing the movie, that's what i'd give it..but im sorry the dvd [stinks]! Don't get me wrong, i bought it! But, it just would've been better if well...a little more money was put in it!
For one thing, there are two different versions (more dvd's are doing this now), instead of making it a double disk with both wide and full screen, there is the widescreen dvd, and the fullscreen dvd..so if for some reason you like fullscreen...(you do get a better picture experience from widescreen!) and then you want a widescreen..you'll just have to get 2!
There is a ton of features, but just not a lot of glitz, i know its only the movie that counts.but it gives u  kinda the feel you get when you purchase one of those 7.00 dvd's from [a local store]..not to much..no flashy intros really..cool game though.
The packaging is also very poor, going back to the original cardboard and plastic case, instead of full plastic...you know what this means....SPECIAL EDITION! Look at Men In Black there wer like 3 versions...and all of them just got glitzier and glitzier....so theres hope for that..
Well there's my review...buy the movie, its awesome, you won't be disapointed!",1023408000,,2313,4.533492822966507

507001,4,6302712017,"Okay, I won't repeat all the good things that everyone has said about this movie because that would be completely redundant. There are well over 100 reviews. But I do think that people have unjustly given this movie one or two stars.
The first complaint I have read concerned the dialogue. For one thing, Ocean's Eleven was written in such a fashion so as to mirror older films from Hollywood's golden era. This was the style in which their scripts were written. Watch an old movie and you'll see that this is how they talked. The dialogue is very smooth and witty. You'll hear a lot of zingers being delivered. Just because people don't get some of the jokes doesn't mean that the script was stupid. It just means that the viewer has a different taste and/or needs to catch up on his or her movie history. There, I said it. Watch an old movie now or you have no right to even be reviewing this one.
Second, the plot is all a matter of taste. Some thought it was slow. They were planning a major heist for millions of dollars in a seemingly unpenetrable vault...of course the characters are going to take the time to plan out the whole thing right! They're not idiots! And I personally thought that it was interesting to see the ingenuity that went into the theft. I'm genuinely sorry that some people have such short attention spans that they can't get out of ""give me lots of action"" mode. If people want lots of explosions in casinos then they can rent 3000 Miles To Graceland. Of course, some people just don't like this movie because it's really not their cup of tea, which is fine. But just because someone doesn't like a movie doesn't make it bad. I hate Casper but I recognize that it really wasn't a bad movie.
People complained about the wierd style the movie was filmed in. Again, watch an old movie. The people who made this film obviously decided to add influence from the era from which the original story was generated. The result is a film that is modern in terms of technology and pop culture but classy and clever like older films.
And finally, I've heard many unfavorable comparisons with the original Ocean's Eleven. That is strictly a matter of taste. But also, I think that some people need to remember that just because it came first doesn't mean it was better. In fact, it isn't even considered a classic except among Rat Pack fans. It was ill-received in its day and isn't recognized as a good film even today. The only reason to watch it would be to see the Rat Pack because they have that enduring coolness factor.",1023408000,,2541,4.490280777537797

They are a motley assortment, these eleven rogues, and it is wonderful to see how each contributes as the ingenious robbery unfolds. Timing is everything in such a story, and there are moments when you are hanging on the edge of your seat waiting to see if anything will go wrong, and if so, how it can be overcome.

Although the cast was terrific, with dialogue sharply delivered by top billing box office stars, as well as veterans Carl Reiner and Elliot Gould in amusing roles, something is missing within.  That something is true character development.  Despite all the aforementioned positives, this missing element takes away a dimension from the story.  Who are these people?  Roberts was married to Clooney before he was sent to prison, but I couldn't find the emotion between them until the very end of the film.  There didn't seem to be much fire between Roberts and Andy Garcia's elusive, cold and non-descript character either. Garcia is a favorite of mine, but he doesn't shine with his usual  warm, emotional performance here.  ................. Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt?  I never really got a good idea of any of them.  So, despite the fantastic ensemble cast, exciting Vegas atmosphere, intriguing premise and Soderbergh's expert direction,  this ""Ocean..."" left me somewhat dry.  ............... While ""Ocean's 11"" is a movie that will certainly entertain you fleetingly as you view it, the desired effect while  we watch, it's not one I'd see again and again.  There are films that you know you can view repeatedly without tiring of them, and then some where you say, once IS enough.

Clooney assembles a who's-who of the bank robbery world to accomplish the mission. The movie's got plenty of twists and turns, as well as sprinkles of humor throughout. Bottom line?

The plot is pretty simple: Danny Ocean (Clooney) organizes a group of eleven highly skilled criminals to simultaneously rob three of Vegas' biggest casinos. Their plans are over the top and outrageous-and you can't help but smile watching them put into action. There are also some really memorable touches in the movie: including Brad Pitt teaching Shane West and Topher Grace how to play poker. This movie kind of serves as a who's-who in Hollywood.

Everyone involved in this film seems to be having fun and so do we watching it!
The film is full of gorgeous people dressed in gorgeous clothes doing things that such people do when dressed in such clothes.  The characters are vivid and played to the hilt by really good actors.  The sets are .... well, they are really Las Vegas... and you can't get much more cool than that!  The story...it's good, but the cohesiveness of the story is the last thing that you should worry about.  The story works - this is far better than its 60's counterpart - but you won't watch and re-watch this film because of the story - you'll do so because of the characters and the actors.
Clooney and Pitt have a chemistry that just sizzles on the screen.  Damon breaks new ground as a ""aw shucks"" sort of con man and pick pocket.  Casey Affleck and Scott Caan play the Heckle and Jeckle (or Abbott and Costello, if you prefer) of the film.  In short, there's not a poorly drawn character here - well, almost....
I love Julia Roberts - I mean I love Julia Roberts - but she just wasn't right for this film.  Angie Dickenson played her part in the original.  Four decades later, Roberts is not comparable to Dickenson.  Roberts is more uptown though awkward than Dickenson's street-wise trashy over peroxided blond.  I think the producers wanted ""elegant"" instead of ""trashy,"" but Roberts isn't elegant either.  She's coltish (let me explain) - watch her walk in heels - she can't - she seems ill at ease in heels - she bounces around and seems as if she is going to fall off of them at any moment.  I got the impression that her character was supposed to be elegant and sexy.  Her character should glide across the room, not bounce.  Roberts is sexy, but not elegant.  Catherine Zeta Jones is elegant.  Gwyneth Paltrow is elegant.  Roberts is not elegant.  That said, it certainly didn't dimenish my overall impression of the movie.

507068,4,6302712017,"I have trouble calling this a remake, because it doesn't share much in common with the ""rat pack"" original except the name of the lead character and that it is a casino heist.  Actually, this is a better film than its namesake, apart from the fact that the cast of the original was filled with entertainment legends.
Director Steven Soderbergh (Erin Brockovich, Traffic) takes a vacation from serious filmmaking with this film, which on his resume is something of a lark.  Everyone seems to be having a good time and it is clear that the actors enjoyed making this film.  The overhauled screenplay pops with snappy dialogue, riddled with deadpan humor and a decent, though somewhat far fetched plot.  It has a little of the whimsical feel of ""The Sting"", though the screenplay isn't as strong.  A crew of professional thieves plans to knock over three casinos on a fight night by raiding the impregnable vault that serves all three.  The plan is elaborate, full of high tech wizardry, daring deceptions and acrobatic stunts.  The caper runs into more than the normal amount of foul ups, but our devious team of burglars is always up to the task of working around the glitches.
The cast is very solid.  George Clooney is perfectly cast as the brainchild of the scheme.  He is dapper, macho and smooth with a sardonic wit that keeps the film's tone serious yet light.  Brad Pitt plays the always eating Rusty, who is really the brains behind the operation, coordinating it flawlessly.  Except for ""The Mexican"", this is much lighter material than Pitt usually tackles, yet he gives a suave performance seeming very comfortable with his character.  Despite the fact that this is an ensemble cast, Pitt carries a lot of the weight and makes the story as close to believable as could be possible given its improbable nature.
Don Cheadle continues to impress, rendering a terrific demolitions expert.  His cockney accent is great and with this part Cheadle shows once again what a terrific character actor he is.  In a little twist of irony, Cheadle plays an analogous part in this film to that played by Sammy Davis, Jr. in the original, and he also played Sammy in the TV movie entitled ""The Rat Pack"".  Poor Andy Garcia has the thankless task of playing the heavy in a tongue-in-cheek film, but he does a marvelous job.  Matt Damon plays the rookie, giving the character a charming naivet and a mischievous bent.  Julie Roberts is nothing more than a throw in, with a minor role as Ocean's ex-wife.
If you don't take this film too seriously, you are in for an entertaining evening.  It is smartly done without too much melodrama, and provides just enough suspense and realism to keep it from being a farce.  I rated it an 8/10.",1021852800,14,2724,4.72093023255814
507094,4,6302712017,"It is too bad the critics didn't like this film.  Ocean's  Eleven reminded me of the old buddy films of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis and featured one of the most entertaining scripts and set of supporting performances I have seen in a long time.  The ensemble cast and director blend their talents, weaving a fast-paced tapestry of humor, suspense, and action.  No one artist gets the screen for too long, so if you are buying this for two hours of Clooney, Roberts, or Pitt - you'll be disappointed.  And the jazz soundtrack composed for the film is simply spectacular.
Daniel Ocean has just got out of prison, starts to work on another heist, and puts together the most entertaining scam since The Sting.  The Score (with DeNiro and Brando) was a good film, but too serious in tone to enjoy watching more than once or twice.  I found myself watching this film two times in a row.  There's no message here...just two hours of fun.  You'll never see this many stars having this much fun acting their brains out again.  Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner, and Elliot Gould turn in unforgettable performances.  I just hope Steven Soderburgh realizes what he has here and uses these folks together again.  There is magic here, and I am one movie fan that would like to see more of it.
Just one word of caution.  The DVD says there is an special feature entitled ""The Look of the Con."" but this feature is nowhere to be found on the DVD.  However the one featurette that is on the DVD is quite good.

They did put together an impressive cast. Clooney in the title role does the job he always does, and he does it well. Brad Pitt as his right hand man delivers the phenomenal performance that is typical of Pitt (in my opinion one of the best living actors). Matt Damon's role was small and irritating. Julia Roberts not only does one of her worst performances, but she also looks horrible in this film. Andy Garcia is over the top. And whoever decided to give Don Cheadle that accent ...
The dvd contains two commentaries, but I haven't watched either one--the movie just didn't impress me enough to watch it that many times. There is a behind the scenes segment which doesn't tell much. There is also a short documentary dealing with costume design. It could have been very interesting, since the costumes were great and important to the film (you can see the Sinatra influence on Clooney's costumes), but the documentary fell short and didn't really go into it.
I wouldn't buy this dvd, but I'd say it is worth the rental money.",1021420800,,1862,4.447368421052632

This is true for Ocean's Eleven, though it's one of the worst films that I've ever seen.  The script is awful, the plot is stupid, and the heist is utterly ridiculous.  I have two peeves in particular with this film.  The ludicrous love story that was weaved into the film (Clooney and Julia Roberts), and the fact that Don Cheadle (one of my favorite actors) had such a poorly written, ridiculously directed part.  This movie works on the premise that we, the movie-going public, don't care about script, plot, or decent character development.  Hollywood might as well gather as many stars as possible, put them in a room together, film the interactions, and call that a blockbuster!  This movie is a stinker.  And by the way, I neglected to mention the completely asanine heist in which they casually steal the rare, expensive piece of scientific equipment as if it were as easy as taking candy from a convenience store.

507173,5,6302712017,"I'm usually hard pressed to name what my favorite movie from any given year. That's because I tend to categorize them. So, in the category of `Most Entertaining Big Budget Hollywood Mainstream Movie', there is an easy answer for 2001. It's ""Ocean's Eleven"" by a nautical mile. This is one of those classics that gets overlooked at awards time, but, I suspect, it may be fondly remembered long after some prize winners have been forgotten.
The original ""Ocean's Eleven"", released in 1960, was a big hit because it starred Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack friends. It's not a great movie; in fact, if I made a list of a thousand movies someone should remake, it would not be on it. Director Steven Soderbergh obviously saw things differently. He lifted a few savory elements out of the original, added in his own ingredients and came up with one delectable movie. He reversed the order of things by taking a very ordinary film and turning it into an original.
Charming con artist Danny [George Clooney] is fresh out of jail. Learning to make license plates has done nothing to reform him. He used his time in jail to dream up his ultimate heist. Soon he's presenting his plan to his favorite partner in crime, Russ [Brad Pitt], who has been reduced to teaching the Hollywood elite how to win at poker. The idea is to relieve three Las Vegas casinos of $150,000,000. Russ is skeptical to say the least, since security at these casinos makes Fort Knox look like easy pickings, but he agrees to round up a crew. Meanwhile, in Vegas, Danny's ex-wife, Tess [Julia Roberts], is now the mistress of the three casinos' owner, Terrance [Andy Garcia]. Knowing this, you will not be surprised to discover that this heist is also a bit personal for Danny, who conveniently forgets to tell the rest of the gang about this little fact.
There is enough star power in Ocean's Eleven to light a small country, but this is less of a vanity project than you might expect. It's more like watching an acting troupe that happens to have some very famous members. The script is smart and sophisticated and provides enough interesting characters and memorable dialog for all the players to sparkle without resorting to upstaging.
This is NOT a `guy' flick, even if it is all about a bunch of guys doing guy things. Julia Roberts, the only `chick' present, has the weakest role. And everyone involved, including the lady herself, knows it. In a sly wink at the audience, her credit reads ""and introducing Julia Roberts as Tess.""
Soderbergh has become one of my all time favorite directors in the last few years. He's something special, a brilliant director who seems dedicated to reviving the notion that popular entertainment can also be intelligent entertainment. Instead of `dumbing down' the audience, he's out to smartening it up. What a cool guy! And what a cool movie! [NOTE: Admittedly, this is entertainment pure and simple. I try to rate movies within the range of what they seem to be trying to accomplish. So, within the confines of 'purely entertaining', I gave ""Ocean's Eleven"" Amazon's highest rating because it succeeds brilliantly on that level.]",1020902400,,3134,4.784132841328414
507174,4,6302712017,"""Ocean's Eleven"" is one of those films that does not attempt to be a stirring social commentary or a barrage of poop jokes that's supposed to be a comedy (although there is only one joke involving human waste in this film).  It is simply meant to entertain, and it does just that.  George Clooney stars as Danny Ocean, a paroled thief who decides to rob a major casino owner (played by Andy Garcia) of his casino's earnings during a boxing match.  He assembles a crew of eleven theives to pull of the heist, but why would he want to go through with this seemngly impossible job?  Is it because of the $160 million dollar pay off?  Or maybe it's because his ex-wife (Julia Roberts) happens to be the casino owner's new girl?  What do you think?  This movie manages to put together a nice ensemble for our crew (including Bernie Mac as a con artist, Carl Reiner as an aging thief, Don Cheadle as a explosives expert, and many, many others) and the solid performances and brilliant dialogue managed to keep this movie from being an empty, flashy caper flick and makes it an enjoyable, flashy caper flick.  The DVD itself has some nice additional stuff, including a commentary with the director and writer (dry, but funny nonetheless) and one with several of the stars (such as Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia, and Matt Damon) that's just as fun.

Everyone must be smoking something wacky that wrote these reviews - this was a terrible movie.
First of all the plot was so unbelievable I couldn't stand it.  A bunch of dimwitted idiots break into the most secure vault in the entire world.  Right.  Gee - they must have really done their homework on this one.  It was so easy for them to get the blueprints of the Casino and con all those really tough guys running those expensive casinos in Vegas. Heck - Brad Pitt had it figured out all by himself!
Second - the script and acting were both terrible.  I guess if you assemble enough BIG NAME STARS - you don't need a good script or acting right?  All we have to do is look at actors  like George Clooney and we forget all about what good acting is.  He's such a hunk!  Oh - and that incredible chemistry between Julia and George - I just couldn't get enough of it.
I could go on and on about how this movie drags, how the actors have no chemistry together, the terrible accents some of them use, (not to mention the terrible color transfer of the DVD) - but I won't. (Oh I do have to mention how believable breaking into the University bomb lab was and stealing a sort of Nuclear proton thingy that doesn't hurt people but simply knocks out the electricity of an entire city - now that was incredible!) (Or how about the way they duplicated the actual vault - built it in their spare time out of parts they purchased from their local Radio Shack and then filmed a fake event to fool the Casino guys while recruiting a real live Swat team to get the money......ok ok I'll stop.
I don't want to spoil one of the greatest movies experiences of all time for many of you.

Ocean's Eleven, remake of the 1960 film, staring the Rat Pack, proved it needed no introduction as actor George Clooney and director Stephen Soderbergh worked together in creating this stylish action packed drama. This remake is definitely worth the wait.
Danny Ocean (George Clooney) devises plans amongst prison walls to bring together eleven men to perform a casino heist and win back his ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts). The success of this movie comes from a thrill seeking adventurous storyline, and from casting some of the finest actors on set to create a movie that is only to be applauded. With the likes of a young pickpocket Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon); Ocean's main man, the smart and stylish Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt); casino owner Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia); with Ocean's ex-wife Tess, played by the stunning Julia Roberts; and Danny Ocean portrayed by none other than George Clooney himself, where could the acting go wrong? The cast took the film to another level, one of class and excitement.
Ocean's Eleven is a film with no dead spots. As Clooney and his carefully selected crew continue to make adjustments to their plans, so continues the action and suspense for the audience. The movie allows the audience to have fun and be part of the action, as well as being able to witness a well thought-out (yet non-realistic) plan. The stakes? Win more than $150 million dollars or loose eleven people's freedom.
The team of eleven all have their individual moment or two in the limelight throughout the film. The bigger names in the entertainment industry such as the Clooneys and Roberts didn't exactly have to be the center of focus to make this movie work. This allowed a different perspective on character input into the film to arise, and those less highly profiled actors such as explosives expert Bashar Tarr (Don Cheedle) and electronics expert Livingston Dell (Eddie Jemison) get to show off their talent and love for performance. These techniques made Ocean's Eleven different from other movies while maintaining at high level what I see as an insightful and interesting drama film.
With an experienced director such as Stephen Soderbergh, Best Film Academy Award last year for two of his previous films, Erin Brockovich and Traffic, I didn't expect anything less than an outstanding movie, and that's what I got. I felt that Soderbergh set out to do no more than create a quick and fun film, and Ocean's Eleven matched up to, if not improved upon, my expectations.
After walking away from this smart, clever, and stylish film, I would highly recommend Ocean's Eleven to all those who are prepared to play along with adventure and drama. Ocean's Eleven will show you a good time, as it doesn't pretend to be anything it's not.",1020297600,,3279,4.985401459854015

But George Clooney plays Danny Ocean, who heads up the title undecemvirate, who plot to pull off the ultimate casino heist. Danny Ocean targets casinos owned by Terry Benedict (Garc&iacute;a'a character), claiming at first that his choice has nothing to do with the fact that the woman Benedict is romancing (Roberts's character) just happens to be Ocean's ex-wife Tess. Not surprisingly, we find out differently as the movie goes on. Still what makes the movie entertaining is how the gang of eleven contemplate and then plan and seek to carry out the heist. They discuss it as essentially a mission impossible, then resolve to do it all the same. There's plenty of suspense and intrigue as they set their plan into motion. As I bet you guessed, part of Danny Ocean's motive is that he wants his ex-wife back and wants monetary revenge on the one he sees as having stolen her away. But that subplot is scarcely even window dressing on the story as a whole. The thing that makes this passable entertainment is the action you can watch unfold if you're willing to suspend ethical judgement and pull for the outlaws.",1019433600,3,1225,4.783018867924528
507218,4,6302712017,"This movie is an entertaining remake of the Rat Pack's 1960 flick of the same name. As many have noted, the 2001 version is a cut above the original. In terms of production, acting, directing, script, concept, and music, this remake is successful.
Not to say the original OCEAN'S 11 isn't worth seeing. Just watching Dean Martin staggering around is priceless alone. Some of the dialogue is great, and it's a classic period piece saluting chauvinism, alcoholism, arrogance, and Las Vegas glitz.
The 2001 movie has its share of implausibilities, but implausibility is kind of the fun of it. As Danny Ocean, this is the kind of role in which George Clooney excels, patronizing supremely arrogant with just a touch of self-deprecation. It's fun watching a bunch of guys wandering around in great clothes pulling off con after con.
They pay just enough props to the original movie to make its devotees happy, but at the same time they exceed its limitations. In that way it is a great remake, we can appreciate its homage to the quirky original while not knowing what is coming next. For instance, in the original a central part of the plot was that none of the crew had records as criminals, while this movie starts with Danny Ocean being released from prison. This made me suspicious at first, but it's a good movie, so there's no point nit-picking something like that.
 The story moves quickly, there is a lot going on, but is never hard to follow. The music is excellent, classic Perry Como and Presley surrounded by fast jazz jam funks. They got too cute producing the soundtrack, unfortunately, and turned a great collection into mostly rubbish by overlaying dialogue on the tracks. We've already seen the movie, guys.
At any rate, the new OCEAN'S 11 is pure entertainment. That's what movies are for, after all. Many professional film critics, out of their own sense of validation, have this idea that all movies MUST entail some self-flaggelating comment on the human condition or something, but why? OCEAN's 11 spitefully rejects such notions, and consequently we have a movie worth watching.",1019347200,,2097,4.873949579831932

Steven Soderbergh's slick upgrade of the of the 1960 rat pack ""OCEAN'S ELEVEN"" glosses the original with stellar casting, and an au courant storyline.  Soderbergh's smooth, flowing touch behind the camera is another big plus.  This entertaining fundamentally meaningless film in many ways resembles a Mission Impossible assignment.  The real pleasure is watching the process unfold in the hands of the A list stars.  George Clooney is Danny Ocean, the role originated by Frank Sinatra.  Clooney makes his screen entrance just out of the slammer -- in a tuxedo no less.  And he wastes no time in laying out his plan to steal $163 million from the state of the art vault of Las Vegas's Bellagio casino.  But it's not just the bucks he wants.  See, he his ex-wife is Julia Roberts, mistress of the casino's cool, implacable, merciless owner Andy Garcia.  This movie epitomizes contempo cool.  Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle share star billing with the aforesaid Clooney and Roberts.  Clooney's not nearly as cool as he thinks but his remake is better than the original and the numerous and extensive extras, including multiple audio tracks with director, select stars and screenwriter make this disc worth considering.

To have all these stars in the same screen I thought this movie would even beat ""Titanic"" in my TOP MOVIES LIST. But it didn't after all.
The plot of the movie is a mix between love and the cleverness of those 11 people who wanted to have all the money from three of Las Vegas top casinos for themselves. Nothing really surprised me more in this movie than the end, where they explained what REALLY happened during that night when the crime was committed. At some points the movie seemed really repetitive and boring (I even had my sleep once). but at the end you could understand everything that was going on even without watching the whole picture. This is why I personally think the movie wasn't that good. I don't think it was a good idea to put all this cast together and leaving the plot of the movie behind. A cast does not make a blockbuster, sorry!
Overall, this movie is NOT bad at all, but it's not the best movie of the year either. So if you haven't checked this one out, then you should!!!",1019260800,,1181,4.422018348623853

I could not believe the star power they had in this movie. It's too bad that some actors couldn't shine more. ""Ocean"" is the main character fresh out of jail and he gathers ten more con-men to pull off the greatest heist in Vegas history. But, its not an easy task at all with todays high tech security in the casinos. I feel that all the actors did a great job and there were no miscastings. Each has a specific role and purpose, which makes movie fun.
Some of the movie got to be a little too hokey but there was always something going on and I can't ever remember a lull in the movie where I got bored. It's filled with action, comedy, drama, and twisting plots that keep you guessing what is going to happen next. Rarely are you correct in your guesses! That is my idea of a great movie!

507257,5,6302712017,"Is Steven Soderbergh the most entertaining director working in mainstream film?  If not, he certainly is the most effective.
Wonder-kid Soderbergh, not yet 40 at the time of this writing, made his first film back in 1989, ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape.""  The production of that film is now made of legend(He wrote the movie during an eight-day drive to Hollywood on legal pads), and is today considered, by many critics, one of the first films to usher in the American independent era that dominated the 1990's.
After the smash hit of ""Sex, Lies""(It won the Palme d' Or at Cannes), Sodbergh quickly returned behind the camera and continued to release films almost on a yearly basis throughout the 90's.  Some of them were well received by critics and audiences(""King of the Hill"" is one of the great film of the 1990's)and others were not(I could have done without the murky ""Kafka). Regardless, Soderbergh has never made a boring film, and he is one of dwindling number of younger directors who has a respect for the medium both as a historical institution and as an art form. It wasn't until 1998 that he hit his ultimate peak and, the beautiful thing about it, he has not slowed down since.
Within the last 4 years, he has released the neo-noir ""Out of the Past""(also with Clooney), ""The Limey""(an undisputed gem), and two film with social commentary, ""Erin Brockovich"" and ""Traffic""(The film that gave him Best Director at the Oscars).
Now comes the remake of the 1960 not so classic, ""Ocean's 11"".  When I first heard about the project, I thought I would be disapointed. I believed, at the time, that it would be one of those films, like so many in the past, where the film collapses on its own star power(big egos working against each other=bad movie).  What I thought was going to be a failure ended up being the most surprisingly fun movie of 2001.  With the exception of ""Memento"" and ""Mullholand Drive"", I can't thing of a film in 2001 that gave me such an exhilarating ride.
The premise of the plot is not complicated.  Danny Ocean, played by possibly the most natural actor working today, George Clooney, gets out of prision on a prior charge, and quickly gathers a group of his fellow criminals to pull a heist in a Casino owned and operated by Andy Garcia(Untouchables).  Clooney's group include characters played by Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Scott Caan and Carl Reiner.  What is complicated, on initial glance, in the method and plan Ocean and his friends reveal in their attempts to steal money from the Casino vault.  What makes the film a triumph, is the ease in which Soderbergh directs the details of the heist.  There was not one moment in this movie where I felt lost or did not know what was going on during this elaborate plan.  That is a huge credit to Soderebergh who directs a film about a casino heist as natural as a person taking a breath.
Ultimately, the greatest thing about Ocean'11 is that its so much more about than simply a casino heist.  It's about Clooney and his swagger which echos Sinatra; it's about Brad Pitt's confidence and his brilliant display of top notch suits; it's about Vegas and the cool vibes that surround that desert town; it's about one of the greatest introductory scenes of a character I've seen in a long time(check out Matt Damon's entrance set to blues music); it's about the guy winning the girl; it's about great ""old time"" actors making welcoming appearances(Carl Reiner).  It's about a director, with such vision, who has ""kicked back"" and has made a party of a movie.",1018656000,,3541,4.690322580645161

The story in this movie is amazing, a bank heist unlike any before. All under the leadership of Danny Ocean (George Cloony) these 11 people (hence the name of the movie) must break into a casino on one of the biggest and busiest nights, hoping to steal millions upon millions of dollars. All of the actors work well together throughout the movie, and when it comes down to the end, there is such a twist, that I doubt anyone would be able to see it coming.

Instead it's about watching famous faces having a great time, similar to the event movies like Towering Inferno. My only two quibbles, one of which agrees with another reviewer, are firstly, that they missed the perfect ending. Instead of using the comic moments at the end they should have used the classical piece of music that was very poignant and seemed a trubute to the original as well as the career of the great Carl Reiner who is also excellent in the film. Secondly, Julia Roberts is lit very badly in the film, whereas Clooney and Pitt are. I don't know why this is because Roberts is seen as this fantastic catch.

  and i must say it didn't disappoint. This has been one of the biggest
  movies in recent months, displacing 'Harry Potter' and 'Lord of the
  rings' from the top at the box-office(so naturally one couldn't avoid
  having some expectations, even though it's a good idea in general not
  have any!) ............
  The story is simple enough - Danny Ocean (Clooney), just released from
  jail, plans a daring heist on three of the biggest casinoes of Las Vegas;
  but this requires a lot of very skilled men, so he assembles a team -
  hence the 'eleven'.
  They plan everything in great detail, but the operation is still fraught
  with danger, as there are several possibilities of even the slightest
  mistake resulting in the whole plan blowing up in their faces.
  Oh, and Danny has a 'hidden motive' - the casino owner Terry (Andy Garcia)
  has stolen his girl Tess (Julia Roberts) .......
  The rest of the movie is a slick, breezy account of what happens as they
  try to implement their meticulous plan and how events unfold, occasionally
  in somewhat unexpected fashion.
  Even though this is not great cinema, it's an excellent way to spend
  two hours, watching an expert director deftly handle a great ensemble
  of performers and to make guesses at the sequence of events for fun.
 Steven Soderbergh chalks up a hat-trick of successes with this one,
  following 'Erin Brockovich' and 'Traffic' - and the best thing is that
  they are all quite different sort of movies, making one look forward
  all the more to the next venture of this director at the top of his form.
  The cast is huge, so naturally most of them don't have big roles - in
  fact, Clooney & Pitt are the ones with big roles, and both do very
  well. Julia Roberts, Matt Damon & Andy Garcia are under-utilised, as
  are Dan Cheadle & other support actors, but they all do admirably in
  whatever they're given by Soderbergh.
  The movie also features some sharp & witty dialogue,  especially when
  Clooney's around; and the production values are first-rate.
  All in all, even though i wouldn't call this a 'must see', i'd say it's
  a movie that lives upto expectations - what more can one ask for ??",1015113600,,2257,4.634961439588689

Then, as always, Uh-oh! Somebody [messed] something up! Will they recover? Will the alarms sound? How will they get away? It's not Jaws-like suspense, but a more enjoyable, mellow, ""gee, I really hope they pull it off"" kind of intensity.
Ocean's Eleven is a really entertaining movie; the cast is excellent, and they all seemed to enjoy their roles. It's not an Oscar-winning film, it's not a gut-bustingly funny film, but it's a good ""romp,"" with wit and charisma. It just lacks...luster, somehow. George Clooney does a great job as Danny Ocean, Matt Damon is his usual affable self, and Don Cheadle (in an uncredited role) is fabulous.
The science is flawed, as it almost always is in these sorts of films, but it doesn't really matter, because it's the flow of the story and the character interactions that's important - this is meant to entertain, not to stupefy with exact mathematics and physics.
If you missed it on the big screen, it will do equally well on your own television, and I'll bet the DVD will have some great outtakes and behind-the-scenes shenanigans; the team really has a lot of onscreen chemistry, and I'm sure they had a really good time shooting this movie.

Backed by a wealthy buisinessman who has personal issue with the casino owner (Elliot Gould) the team comprises of Ocean's longtime friend and point man (Played aptly by Brad Pitt) an explosives expert (Don Cheadle) an escaped contortionist from the circus, and electonics expert, as well as a rough and crude rookie pickpocket (Matt Damon) etc. The viewer encounters the trials and tribulations of these characters as the try to battle past Uzi weilding guards, an impossible safe and an amazing security system.
In the film we can't help but love the characters. Each of them is hilarious in their own right but it seems that Clooney and Pitt are the glue that holds it together. The performance by Julia Roberts as Daniels Ex wife is also fantastic.
The amalgamation of styles in which director Stephen Soderbergh utilizes is fantastic and gives the film a whole new film, meets old film style, which is great. Technically the film is nothing special aside from fantastic cutting and camera work. There is nothing new, or innovative wise but the film is nevertheless great. This film must be seen by everyone who enjoys a great comedy as well as the work of Soderbergh. It is undoubtably one of the best accomplishments of the year.",1014681600,4,2272,4.72544080604534
507312,5,6302712017,"OCEAN'S ELEVEN is one of the five best films of 2001. I mostly wanted to see it because some of my favorite actors- Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon- star. I was disappointed that Julia Roberts didn't even show up until 45 minutes into the movie, and didn't even speak until several scenes later. She has a pretty small part, but when she is on screen, she steals the spotlight.
Here's the basic plot of the movie. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is a thief just getting out of jail. He meets up with Rusty (Brad Pitt) and comes up with a scheme to rob the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas. The vault in this casino contains more than $150 million (including money from the MGM Grand and Mirage casinos). The catch is that Danny's ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts) is dating the owner of all three casinos, Terry (Andy Garcia). So Danny hopes to win her back while robbing her boyfriend. To help him pull off the elaborate heist, he seeks the help of eleven men, all with different expertises. Two are great with explosives or electronics, another is a pickpocket,two are drivers, one is a casino security expert, another is a former casino dealer, another is a acrobat, and two others are professional theives. The men are introduced, and after training the men (some of which have no skill in stealing whatsoever) the robbery comes into action. The plan to rob the casino is so detailed it's a little difficult to keep up with. There are a few surprises, including the fact that they actually call Terry and tell him they are robbing him (don't worry, that doesn't give away anything). I'll let you see the rest when you go see this great movie. Most kids could probably see this. The reason this film was rated PG-13 was mostly language (a certain four-letter word is heard once or twice, and the finger was shown) but also for a little sexual content. Most kids over 11 are probably mature enough to see this.
I don't quite know what category this movie fits into. Drama, I guess, although there is some comedy and romance, and certainly action. I would recomend it to anyone. I have yet to meet someone who didn't like this. It's great entertainment that Hollywood could use more.
THE BEST THING: The twists in the plot that
even fool the audience.
THE WORST THING: Julia Roberts is not on
screen nearly enough, but she does do a good job with the acting, as usual.
I hope you see this movie, and I also hope this movie gets nominated for the Oscars' Picture of the Year. It certainly deserves it.",1014595200,20,2498,4.541019955654102
507343,5,6302712017,"Ocean's 11 just happens to be the best crime film in a long time. Not since films such as ""The Sting"" has a movie emulating common criminals come off as such a huge success story!
Starring an unbelievably talented cast (George Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts are the big names) and directed by the sublime Steven Soderberg, Ocean's 11 is the third ""classic"" of the 21st century (the others being Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter & the Philosopher's Stone).
The film opens with Danny Ocean (Clooney) being released from jail for a crime we are given little information on. While behind bars, his wife, Tess (Roberts) has divorced him and hooked up with the villain of the story, Terry, who happens to own three Las Vegas casinos. So Danny sets about using his newly found freedom to rob Terry of both his money and his woman. To do this, he enlists the help of 11 eccentric master criminals, including a pickpocket (Damon), an electronics boff, an East Asian circus gymnast, an aging con artist with ulcers and a host of others.
The plan is to rob the central vault of the three casinos, which, in the words of Ocean, ""is better protected than a nuclear missile silo."" It contains over 160 million US dollars.
So do they get away with it? Far be it from me to spoil the ending of a film as good as this one. I'm afraid you'll have to watch it yourself...you won't be disappointed!",1014336000,6,1398,4.5078740157480315

507345,4,6302712017,"There is an amazing shot in 'Ocean's Eleven' to be found, appropriately, in one of the many throwaway digressions that punctuate this most musical of films.  Elliott Gould is telling his reckless young proteges George Clooney and Brad Pitt, who have come to him with a proposal to rob three casinos, about three equally reckless young men who came the closest to such a coup.  Two were stopped before they even left the building, but a third made it, only to be shot in the back by secruity.  As the camera races back to get a full view of this failure, the fan-like rise of the casino's front matching the banknotes fluttering from the dying man's hands.  As they inevitably rain on his prone figure, so a fountain to our right mimics his downfall.  It's a small moment, over in seconds; it doesn't even have anything to do with the lead players, except as an awful warning.  But is encapsulates what is so treasurable in Steven Soderbergh's cinema, and 'Eleven' in particular.  It inextricably links its characters' fate and struggle and endeavour to a precise place, the casinoscape of Las Vegas, a faceless monolith mocking all who presume to defeat it.  Soderbergh's vibrant, colourful, authentic filming of this milieu, with its vaults, corridors, secret passages, traps and panopticon transforms it from a gaudy joke, into a Beckett-like landscape of the soul (Las Vegas is, after all, surrounded by desert), where someone you can't see is always watching.
Yes, in effect, 'Eleven' is updated John Huston.  But Huston went into his films already convinced of his philosophy - that human endeavour is doomed to failure - with an often deadening effect on his films.  Soderbergh is more open, more ambiguous, less convined of the rigidity of Fate.  He knows the dangers, but he knows the graces too.  He is more interested in certain characters than others - Clooney, Matt Damon and Carl Reiner especially - but all are ennobled by the job, by the communal bonhomie.
For most of its running time, 'Eleven' just about misses out on classic status - the fleetfooted direction, giving every sequence a fresh tweak, novelty and resonance that keeps us expectant and fuelled; the engaging guy-play of the actors; the foot-flicking momentum of the jazzy soundtrack; can't quite hide the fact that the script is a bit flat, only funny because Clooney, Pitt, Gould and co. are great kidders, not because of its inherent qualities.  The Julia Roberts subplot seems initially like a bit of a sell-out that slows things down.  But, in the last 20 minutes - and I won't tell you how it happens, but you'll see what I mean - the pitch is raised, loose-ends don't so much come together as fruitfully coalesce; emotion seeps in with all the quiet, epiphanic rush of a Debussy moonlight.  The heist film escapes its mechanical grid and becomes something else, something provisional, doubtful, vulnerable, but quite beautiful - you realise that if you saw the film again, it would reveal so much more.",1013990400,,2989,4.856299212598425

Andy Garcia as the Head of the Casinos is brilliant. Suave, In control and dirty!! Matt Damon as the two-pie pickpocket excels in his bit performance.

Honestly, I'm not too fond of Julia Roberts, but this certainly did not effect my mood of the movie. Having all these hot guys in action is the greatest thing to see anyway. The movie wasn't all about greed. It was about the meaning of really taking risk for people you care about. Risk is sexy, and flattering. For someone to give up everything he has just to make me notice him is the sweetest thing a guy could do to win me over.

Not true.  One thing I liked about the movie is that all the stars got a chance in front of the camera.  Yes, there is more George and Brad, but I never got the feeling that this was their movie alone.  It was odd that Julia did not have a larger role.  Perhaps with her star power, anything more would have eclipsed the other actors.
The movie never drags.  The pace is steady without seeming too quick.  There are special effects, but not so elaborate that it detracts from the movie.  It has an exciting, yet comfortable, feel to it.
The script is fresh.  Usually, when actors get in a jam, some divine intervention steps in to save the day.  Here, you may follow the plot and see some of the foreshadowing, but parts of the ending will surprise you.

507412,3,6302712017,"Ocean's Eleven (Steven Soderbergh, 2001)

Soderbergh, coming off two films that everyone but me seemed to like, returned to the big screen to helm a ""remake"" of Rat Pack wunderfilm Ocean's Eleven. George Clooney was heard to say that the remake, in fact, had nothing in common with the original but the name, and he couldn't have been more right. It takes a little stretching and a lot of devil's advocate-playing, but if you look at Soderbergh's creation as its own film and don't try to compare it to the vastly superior original, you can have a good time for the hundred and fourteen minutes plus assorted commercials and previews you'll be in the theater.

The plot bears a strikingly similar resemblance to the original-- Danny Ocean pulls together eleven guys to rob a bunch of casinos in Las Vegas. The number of casinos has changed from five to three (thus allowing 1.8 more guys per casino. Jeez, what a ripoff!), and the band of merry men have gone from Ocean's old wartime paratrooper unit to a loose collection of professional thieves. But then, security in 2001 is a whole lot more stringent than it was in 1960, so the original caper would have been impossible to pull off. Oh, well. Can't win 'em all.

Once you've changed the premise, everything else goes its own way. Julia Roberts reprises Angie Dickinson's original role as Danny Ocean's wife, but Roberts has a much, much larger part in this film than Dickinson did in the original-- in fact, she's dating the guy (Andy Garcia) who owns the casinos that the guys plan to knock over.

There's nothing here that's too terribly surprising, and the twist at the end, while nicely delivered, doesn't even have the punch of the ending of Heist, much less the last line of the original film, which is a twist ending right up there with that of The Usual Suspects. Still, despite a pedestrian script and Soderbergh's usual ""just act as if I'm not here-- no, really"" directing style, a high-power cast makes it an enjoyable two hours. Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Elliott Gould, and a really-not-aging-well-at-all Carl Reiner head the band of thieves, and the less-known members of the band of merry men (including Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, and the seemingly-ubiquitous Bernie Mac) prove, within the boundaries of the script, that they do have what it takes to stand in the glare of all this A-list talent and still be seen. The real treasure though, as he is in any movie in which he makes an appearance, is Andy Garcia. Despite looking rather like a Baldwin Brother, fear not; Garcia's got all the talent the collective Baldwins think they have, and it oozes from him every time he makes one of his big screen appearances. He gets a whole lot less screen time than Clooney, Pitt, and Damon, but that makes the time he does spend up there that much more enjoyable.

But getting back to the film, this was a remake of a '60s classic by the same title starring Frank Sinatra. I didn't see the original, but I heard from many people that this version was better than the original.
OCEAN'S 11 is about an ex-con named Danny Ocean (Clooney) who is released out of jail and decides to get back into the business of robbing. He meets up with Rusty Ryan (Pitt), who teaches celebrities how to play poker in casinos. Danny tells Rusty his plan, and gets him involved. His plan is to rob big casinos in Las Vegas like the MGM Grand and the money will be worth about $150 million. But they can't do this alone, so they hire 9 other guys who are willing to risk their lives for the $150 million, which they all plan to share. The 9 other guys involved in this plan include Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Casey Affleck, and Scott Caan. They also have to get past the MGM Grand owner, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), and Danny tries to get his ex wife, Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts) back, because she is dating Benedict.

507440,4,6302712017,"...The movie is ten times better than the mediocre original. Danny Ocean(George Clooney), is released from prison. It doesn't take long for him to get back to his old ways. He devises a plan to steal $163 million dollars from the tightly guarded vault of the Las Vegas casino The Bellagio. To do so, he needs to round up a crew of men to pull this very tough heist off. Enter the rest of the 'Star Power' cast. Brad Pitt plays Clooney's right hand man, Rusty Ryan. Matt Damon plays a talented pocket picker named Linus. Don Cheadle really has a nothing role, but makes up for it with his lively and entertaining accent. Comedy legend Carl Reiner is also on hand as an aging thief. Comedian Bernie Mac(one of the stars of ""The Kings Of Comedy"" film)is one of the gang as well. Andy Garcia plays Terry Benedict, the owner of the casino they are going to hit. Terry is now with Danny's ex Tess, played by Julia Roberts. There isn't anything new with the film really, but who cares?. It was designed to be a fun crowd pleaser from beginning to end. It delivers on all sides. There are numerous one liners that come fast and sharp. The actors deliver them with full force. The funniest gag is Pitt's character teaching young T.V. stars how to play poker. Those stars being Joshua Jackson from ""Dawson's Creek"", Topher Grace from ""That 70's Show"", Holly Marie Combs from ""Charmed"", Barry Watson from ""7th Heaven"", and Shane West from ""Once And Again"". The ""Chewing Scenery"" award goes to Elliot Gould, who plays a casino owner equipped with big glasses, cigar, and lots of jewelry sprawled out in dark chest hair. It's a comical highlight. Good for him. Reiner gives a wonderful performance. It's nice to see the legend has still got it. Our stars are wonderful too. Clooney brings new meaning to the word ""charming"". If there was anyone to have that cool, calm charm like Sinatra, it's Clooney. Pitt is enjoyable as well. The only fault this film has is the horrendous underuse of Damon and Roberts. People will be surprised to learn how small this Oscar winning mega star has. Could've been used so much better. Garcia balances his villain role just right. He stays on line and doesn't whoop it up and make it seem like some cheesy caricature of characters gone by. A nice, rather subdued, performance. I can't stress enough how much of a good time the film is. Director Steven Soderbergh is on fire. He films the town nicely, and, of course, the stars. It's almost hard to imagine this was the same guy who did ""Traffic"". Ocean's 11 might not be Oscar material, but it is most definitley the nicest, most insanely entertaining film so far this year. Hands down. No if's, and's, or but's about it. It would definitley not be a bad thing to have an Ocean's 12, or 13, 14, 15, 16. This is a movie for people who like movies. If, like the one star negative reviews are any indication, you hate movies, then you will probably hate this one too. Ignore those reviews. Those are grouches who don't enjoy good, quality films.",1008806400,9,3014,4.552486187845304

Carl Reiner steals every scene he's in, Elliot Gould and Bernie Mac are riots and Scott Caan and Casey Affleck are great playing stooges, albeit clever ones. Steven Soderburgh has proven yet again that he is at the pinnacle of his career with his great direction and cinematography (he filmed this one himself). Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Julia Roberts and Andy Garcia are all fine in their roles (Julia is relegated to eye candy, but shines in a small role). But, this film belongs to George Clooney. He, too, is at the top of his game, from the first scene to the last, he is the MAN. His perfect balance of suaveness and desperation (the girl is his ex, now dating the owner of the casinos their targeting) sets the tone for the entire film.

507443,2,6302712017,"One has to wonder why Hollywood hasn't realized that throwing an all-star cast, a glossy appearance, and/or an edgy approach at a script isn't the answer to a successful film. Steven Soderbergh, who gave us the winning ""Erin Brockovich"" and the hard-hitting ""Traffic,"" delivers his usual trademarks in ""Ocean's 11,"" a remake of the original Rat Pack classic that fails to engage the audience in any sort of intensity or comic relief as it meanders through a borish plot, banal, worn-out dialogue, and stylish setpieces.
The film opens as Daniel Ocean (George Clooney), convicted of confidence scams and fraud, is being released on parole from prison. He heads to Las Vegas, where he has a score to settle with Harry Benedict (Andy Garcia), the wealthy owner of three luxurious casinos that are among the city's richest establishments. Assembling a group of men to carry out a plan that involves knocking over all three casinos in one night, Ocean begins to exact his revenge on Benedict, whose latest girlfriend just happens to be Ocean's ex-wife, Tess (Julia Roberts).
The members of Ocean's group each possess a quality or a knowledge of a powerpoint vital to their success in pulling off the heist. There's Roscoe (Don Cheadle), an expert in explosives; Linus (Matt Damon), who impresses Ocean with his suave ability to lift goods without breaking his stride; Dusty (Brad Pitt), Ocean's partner in formulating and planning, and various others including a bartender to scope the casino and a Chinese gymnast who can easily move around a mock safe without activating alarms.
The movie is never short on star power, to be certain. The presence of such fine actors like Clooney, Pitt, and the delightful Roberts, not to mention Damon, might have been enough to carry the movie if not for its sole focus on these cast members and its ignorance of the supporting cast. Cheadle is wasted in a throw-away role that barely reveals any of his talent, while Elliot Gould, Bernie Mac, and Carl Reiner are hardly present throughout the script.
The film reminds me of two movies released earlier this year, ""America's Sweethearts"" and ""Bandits,"" both of which showcased superb cast members, yet proved to be little more than star vehicles. Here, we have not three, not four, but an overload of well-known actors and actresses, some of whom come and go in the blink of an eye. As much as I love most of the talent that has come out to play in Soderbergh's backyard, I have to ask: what else is there to enjoy?
Not much outside of the A-list cast, one of Soderbergh's usual devices, along with his visionary sense of style. Seeing this film reminded me of his ability to cast a certain sheen over his individual films, most notably ""Traffic,"" with its distinct use of color to evoke atmosphere and emotion. Here, he employs smooth movement, lots of bright colors, and a hip soundtrack that recalls those of past caper movies with sheer whimsy. All of this would be better were it backed by an interesting plot.
The story is one of the year's great disappointments, ranking with such blockbuster letdowns as ""Hannibal"" and ""Pearl Harbor,"" which looked promising but delivered little excitement. ""Ocean's 11"" contains no energy underneath its glossy cast; there is almost no suspense to the heist sequence, nor is there any interesting premise to set it up. We already know the mastermind and his cohorts; we've been made aware of their plans and tactics; every obstacle is easily overcome... it follows a routine that buries any and all surprises beneath a barrage of predictability.
The critics have already expressed adoration and admiration for ""Ocean's 11,"" though I have to wonder what it is about the film they're enjoying so immensely. For me, Soderbergh throws so much style and so little substance our way that there is little to do except point out actors and try to remember what movies (most likely better ones) they've played in before. His failure to engage us with a likeable premise is surprising, given his past successes; could this once unconventional director possibly be succumbing to the stereotypes and cliches of Hollywood? Let us hope not.",1008547200,5,4150,4.921540656205421

507445,4,6302712017,"As with any remake, even if the original wasn't that good to begin with, people will constantly compare the new to the old. In the case of ""Ocean's 11"", it'll probably be worse. But have no fear, because even though Frank, Dean and Angie were terrific in the original, George, Brad, and Julia are excellent in the updated version. Director Steve Soderburgh knew what this movie was about, and thankfully, he never strayed. It was about a heist, plain and simple. Clooney's title character Danny Ocean brings the whole thing together, constructing a plot to rob three Las Vegas casinos of over $150 million in cash. To do this, he seeks out buddy Pitt and nine other guys who all need to work together to pull this thing off. And that's the movie. The heist is the focus of the movie, although we should be aware that this is Ocean's job, hence ""Ocean's 11"". It's HIS game. And when thinking about that, the movie is satisfying. Soderburgh shows the heist in all its complex details, and of course, we find ourselves rooting for the criminals instead of the victim, the menacing Andy Garcia, who plays his part to perfection. Supporting cast members are also excellent, including Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac (underused, however), Scott Caan, Casey Affleck, Carl Reiner, and a terrific Elliott Gould. Danny's love for his ex-wife (Roberts' Tess, who is now dating the casino owner, Garcia's Benedict) is brought to the forefront of the picture, but Soderburgh handles it perfectly, not creating a sappy love story but rather a crime caper effectively pulled off by some of Hollywood's latest heavyweights.",1008547200,,1611,4.883211678832117

Starts off with George Clooney getting out jail and reconnecting with old acquaintances for the biggest heist ever planned.  His scheme is elaborate, a little too much so.  His plan is easy to follow, that wasn't the problem, it was too absurd.  The thought that someone could construct a plan so precise as this is nearly impossible.  That was my only real quarrel with this movie, his outrageous plan.  Other than that, it was very action packed and humorous, with depictions of Brad Pitt eating whenever in view.  The movie hides a little from you until the end, but I think this was necessary to build up the finale.  You can imagine the ending of this movie pretty easily, it was predictable but enjoyable.

It is in fact one that surpasses the original starring Rrank Sinatra and his Rat Pack pals - and part of the luminous glow attributes to Soderbergh's stylish directing and cinematography. The Las vegas glamour and casino burst in full glory with the cameras - consistent with the brilliance of the mega stardom. Danny Ocean played by the enigmatic George Clooney decides to erase criminal history with a heist on the casino tycoon Terry Benedict. He conjures up a plan to penetrate the 200 feet vault and ultimately the 150 million prize. Yet his motives run deeper - his ex wife played by Julia Roberts is now Terry's interest. Danny joins forces with a motley of swindlers and pickpockets - including Matt Damon as Linus Caldwell, Brad Pitt as Rusty - his sidekick, Don Cheadle with his British accent as a bomb expert, Shaobo Qin as a acrobat, Carl Reiner as an experienced hustler et al.
Despite the first hour of the movie rounding up the characters, there is never a dull moment. That's where Soderbergh's storytelling confidence takes full fledge - each is with his distinctive personality; their rapport and chemistry has bolstered the good-natured fun. The plot remains outlandish with a slight twist or two, speckled with some smooth humour and sleek moves in the action department. This year's best heist thriller? It is an intelligent plot serviceable enough but not much powerhouse acting like THE SCORE. Ocean's 11 has no plans to outshine or compete - the mood is dexterously imbued to entertain the audience with some light fluff and clean fun.

When George Clooney's Danny Ocean, a thief, is released from prison--wearing a tux that looked like it never wrinkled the whole time he was behind bars--he teams up with Brad Pitt (who's teaching young Hollywood celebrities how to play poker--ultra cool, dude), and then a whole team of other crackerjacks to take down Vegas' Bellagio casino, the repository of a cool $163 mil on the night of a big fight between Lenox Lewis and some other guy.
The team includes an experienced con man altekakke (that's old guy to all youse who don't speak Yiddish), played by Carl Reiner; a short Chinese gymnast, a Cockney explosives expert (Basher, played by the amazingly talented Don Cheadle), two always-arguing younger thieves (Scott Caan in his best performance to date, and Casey Affleck); a high-tech computer nerd; an experienced puller (pickpocket) played by Matt Damon; an inside man (a croupier), and Elliot Gould's gay altekakke, the former owner of another casino taken over by Terry Benedict, the violent, really rich owner of a bunch of casinos.  Here, Andy Garcia does a fine job.
Julia Roberts as Tess, Danny Ocean's former wife, now hooked up with Benedict, is also on hand to supply the love interest, but it's really the comedy-laced interactions of the 11 and the snap, crackle, and razzle-dazzle of the heist plotting and execution that supply the fun.  And fun is here--tons of it.  The super sharp intricacies of the film--from Danny's initial assembling of the team to the final ambiguous ending--are a terrific pleasure.
The music, too, by David Holmes, is as ultra cool as the movie--a perfect blend of trip hop and 50s jazz, it updates the feel of the original film to deliver just the right aural atmosphere for the dudes that go all out to rip off the man who stole Danny's wife and another dude's casino.

Among the 9 are Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, and Bernie Mac. Outstanding job from all of them.

507476,4,6302712017,"""Ocean's Eleven"" makes a deal with you.  It asks you to promise not to notice the plot holes and inconsequentiality that runs through its labyrinthine narrative.  In return, it offers more star-wattage in one sitting than any five other blockbusters combined.  For the most part, I'd say, it's a fair trade.  For the most part.
The film doesn't live up to this deal in several ways.  First, we get some pretty silly casting choices.  Matt Damon is a complete waste.  Didn't he write ""Good Will Hunting"" to get out of playing underwritten cardboard parts like this?  Julia Roberts (She's called Tess, as in Tess Trueheart.  You must be joking) is not the least bit sexy, desirable, or tough enough to be caught in a love triangle with two very vital men.  Andy Garcia, as one of those vital men, is not as vital as he could have been.  Nor is he as menacing a badass as the movie would have you believe.  They tried to tell me that anyone caught robbing his Casino would be in for a world of pain.  Well, you don't scare me just by telling me.  Film is a visual medium.  Show me!  And Steven Soderbergh, well, he's always been hit or miss in my books.  ""Out of Sight"" was enjoyable, and the one film in his oeuvre that would lead you to believe he could direct ""Ocean's Eleven"" capably.  But Soderbergh does what he always does: he gets in the way too much.  Too much needless visual style, which does nothing to advance the plot, or keep you interested.  Why can't you just let your movies breath, Stevie?  Oh, and check out the awshucks fountain ending he tacks on.  Blech.
I suppose one could read the above bile-filled paragraph and come to the conclusion that I didn't like the movie.  Well, you'd be wrong.  I liked it a lot.  And now I'll tell you why.
It gives us some cool dudes who have serious chemistry together.  Bernie Mac is underused, but shines as an Atlantic City dealer/con man finally given a shot at the big score.  Don Cheadle has a ridiculous cockneyfied accent, but is entertaining nonetheless.  His character, a munitions expert named Basher (natch!), even manages to throw in a bit of rhyming slang.  Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould do their best to show the rest of these young whippersnappers how to chew scenery with style.  Reiner looks like he should be living out his golden years in Florida, but still has the strength and will to be a vital con man.  Gould couldn't look tackier (bushels of gold chains compete with abundant fur for space on his exposed chest), but he chomps on his cigars and delivers his lines with the gusto of a true pro.  And there are a couple of other guys in the cast who also deserve a mention.  Such as...
Clooney and Pitt.  Pitt and Clooney.  They're asked to replace Sinatra and Dino from the original ""Ocean's"", and do so with style and cool to spare.  George rarely breaks a sweat, relying on his considerable charm (the mega-star's stock in trade) to carry him through the picture.  Even in the face of danger, he's always having a good time.  Brad is more low-key, the Vladimir to George's Estragon.  He begins the film as a bored card sharp, teaching poker techniques to bratty young Hollywood actors (Topher Grace gets mobbed for autographs, while Brad Pitt is left alone to ponder his existence?  What a wonderful parallel universe we've stumbled on, here...).  But when things get going later on, it's Pitt who leads the way, having more fun than anyone.  And they both have such fun wearing a variety of super cool clothes.  George even leaves a four-year prison term wearing his tuxedo, tie left dangling around his neck, as if he's just come from a long night of gambling rather than a spell in the clink.  Brad is not to be outdone.  He has more costume changes than Elizabeth Taylor in ""Cleopatra"".  Male vanity, when done right, can be highly entertaining.  These two actors, who I've always enjoyed in a variety of other roles (""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", ""Seven"", and ""Fight Club"" come quickly to mind), team up wonderfully here.  Neither one steps on the other's shining moments, and when they have to work together, their chemistry is just right.  More of Clooney and Pitt (or should it be Pitt and Clooney?) in the future, and I'll be a happy film fan.
You can't possibly go into this film expecting anything more than a glitzy style parade.  But as glitzy style parades go, this is one of the best.  It's entertaining, and that is the bottom line.",1008115200,32,4452,4.558080808080808

It's one of the most entertaining movies of the Christmas season.",1008028800,,980,5.0184049079754605
507478,5,6302712017,"Okay, so no one could ever be as cool as the Rat Pack, but these guys come pretty close. The film is a VERY loose remake of the the orginal of the same title. This one, however, is far superior. Aside from the technical improvements over the original, the film also improved on the acting and script of the orignal. Lets face it, the original wasn't very good all around. It was just the idea of it that was good. Anyway, Soderbergh, in his first real mainstream film, does a pretty good job. Obviously the material isn't as good as, say, ""Traffic"" or ""Out of Sight"", but he keeps the film moving and uses some of his signature techniques to make everything look a little less ordinary. As for the cast, the leader of the pack, George Clooney, pretty much plays himself. Normally, that's not something that I would enjoy seeing, but he was perfect for the role. His charm and wit go a long way in making you believe that anyone could talk these guys into the preposterous. He was the epitome of cool. Brad Pitt also turned in a good performance. I happen to think that he is one of our most underrated actors. This film was the perfect showcase for any nonbelievers. The rest of the cast was pretty much by the numbers. Aside from Carl Reiner and Elliot Gould, bland is a good way to describe them. Matt Damon, to his credit, did okay with what he had to work with and Julia Roberts was pretty much just there. Clooney and Pitt are the ones who really hold the thing together. The onscreen chemistry between the two was amazing. The same can't be said for Clooney and Roberts. Like I said, she was kind of just there. That was pretty evident in most of her scenes with Clooney, which is a shame 'cause they were so well written and everything he said crackled and then died when she responeded. All in all, ""Ocean's Eleven"" is not the best film ever made by any means. It is however, one of the most entertaining film that I've seen in recent years. See it for the stars and for two hours of non-stop fun! PSIt's not supposed to be serious. So, if you go into it thinking that it's anything more than pure entertainment, you WILL be dissapointed.",1007942400,,2146,4.380952380952381

507500,2,6302712017,"Soderbergh turns in a ring-a-ding dud.  It's good, but not great.  I was disappointed: after catching the original on cable and loving it, I thought Soderbergh would do a bang-up job.  Turns out the original has more punch.  It's very uneven: some great acting, some atrocious; some great set pieces, other parts with bad editing and pacing.  Plus a lame new Soderbergh-esque ending.  Brad Pitt and Elliott Gould shine, but Julia is wasted and Andy Garcia thinks he's playing Dracula Corleone.  There is subzero chemistry between Clooney and Roberts...ditto Roberts and Garcia...and her part is stunted compared to Maureen O'Hara in the orig.  The fancy gadgets and sweet costumes don't make up for some bad plot holes, and the wonderful score only crops up a few times.  It's funny, but also too slow for a caper, and the ending left the audience literally scratching their heads.  I felt cheated: Soderbergh picked a few parts of the original and made an homage to them, but chopped out the parts that made it coherent, replacing them with modern touches.  My advice, rent the original first, and enjoy the low tech-ness: they rob the casinos by posing as garbagemen!  By comparison, the new one is a knockoff, borrowing from Mission Impossible, David Mamet, Go and Swingers, Boogie Nights, and even Out of Sight.  He should have watched Heist and Get Shorty instead.  Soderbergh should stick to original material.  He tried to make this into a romance (?!) when it should just be a heist movie.  Funny note, though: Julia and Brad have more screen time together than they did in The Mexican, where they played a couple!  Also, great cameos from Joshua ""Pacey"" Jackson and That Kid From That 70's Show (and Traffic).",1007942400,5,1718,4.86896551724138
507501,4,6302712017,"If you're like me, you planned on seeing this movie as soon as you heard that Steven Soderbergh was directing.  Yes, Traffic was a little weak in spots (and I'm sure Steven was aware of that),  but Erin Brockovich, The Limey, and Out of Sight were all very entertaining refreshing films chock full of subtle new ideas and certainly a lot of subtle acting.  Anyway, I'm in love with Steven, I admit it!  I want him to have my child.
There are a couple very small problems with Ocean's Eleven, but I don't want to draw your attention to them.  The  bottom line?  There are no glaring inconsistencies.  Nothing that makes so little sense, it pulls you out of the movie.  This is actually quite an accomplishment.  How many thriller movies have we seen where the plot hinges squarely on some particularly unrealistic event?  The details of the robbery are pretty complex and it's hard to keep up with it all.  Ideally, we just let go and enjoy the whirlwind excitement of megawatt star-power, a dazzlingly audacious heist, non-stop humor, great cast chemistry, and Steven's inspired camera work (yes, he's the cinematographer as well as the writer and producer (along with George).

507503,4,6302712017,"I had occasion to see Ocean's Eleven on this opening weekend for the updated 1960 flick.  This is a two part review:
Part I - 2001 Ocean's Eleven - This is in the same genre of many recent technology flicks that we expect to see.  This film has been brought into the 21st century with all the latest gadgets and its flamboyant stars.  Frankly, I had forgotten almost everything about the original film (1960) and therefore was able to enjoy this one as if it were a brand new film.
It is slick, comedic and a little suspenseful.  What I miss from Mission Impossible (the TV show, not the movie) is all of the preparation that goes into planning and pulling off a heist like this.  And, while the movie does show a lot of the planning, it doesn't show all of it, and as a result, there are some delightful and unexpected surprises awaiting you when the robberies take place.
Go see and enjoy.
Part II - 1960 Ocean's Eleven - I had occasion to see this movie on satellite the next day.  I remember seeing the movie when it first came out and enjoyed the comradery of the 'Rat Pack' and probably thought it was a pretty good file at the time.
I now can't believe how lame this film is and without the modern technology and gadgets we have now, this film certainly doesn't hold up today.  And, in fact, the simplicity of what was done to break into the casinos and the lack of security in manpower in the cashier's cages, makes it unbelievable.
The film languishes in self-admiration for the stars, including Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin singing parts, and the movie is more about themselves than the casino heist.
I didn't remember the surprise ending of this film until the funeral scene and this is one of the film's redeeming qualities.
Don't waste your time.",1007942400,,1762,4.453416149068323
507504,5,6302712017,"Well, my high hopes for this film were far exceeded.  What a rush!  Steven Soderbergh has such a confident, fun style with this glitzy, slick, and unpredictably fun caper.  Sure, it isn't full of gravity like ""Traffic,"" and it isn't supposed to be.  Soderbergh and his four-star cast just want to have fun, and they let us as audience members join in the fun with them.  Soderbergh's inventive flourishes and gorgeous photography combined with the lively performances and sharp script means an intelligent, funny, exciting and visually breathtaking cinematic experience.  Definitely one of 2001's best films!",1007856000,,608,5.28125
507505,4,6302712017,"After directing gritty movies like ""Traffic"", ""Erin Brockovich"" and ""Out of Sight"", Steven Soderbergh decided to take it easy and create a movie whose sole purpose was to entertain.  He's done exactly that with ""Ocean's 11"", an entertaining piece of fluff that mostly delivers.
George Clooney leads an all-star cast in this remake of the 1960 Rat Pack caper picture.  Thief and ex-con Danny Ocean (Clooney) has recently been released from prison and is already planning his magnum opus: the theft of $150 million from a Las Vegas casino owned by Terry Benedict (a glowering Andy Garcia).  But Danny can't pull it off alone, so he recruits his friend Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) and a motley group of shady characters, including Cockney demolitions expert ""Basher"" Tarr (Don Cheadle), con man Saul Bloom (a scene-stealing Carl Reiner) and light-fingered pickpocket Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon).  The larcenous crew is rounded out by card sharp Frank Catton (Bernie Mac), money man Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), Chinese acrobat Yen (Shaobo Qin), and bickering drivers Turk Malloy and Virgil Malloy (the frequently hilarious Scott Caan and Casey Affleck).  Complicating things (and fueling Danny's quest) is the fact that Benedict is involved with Danny's ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts).
""Ocean's 11"" unfolds smoothly through the standard caper-movie set pieces: the setup, the heist and the getaway.  There's lots of snappy patter, played very nicely by the talented cast, and fantastic music--I'd like to see Soderbergh's record collection.  Clooney exudes movie-star charm and hipster cool in the role Sinatra originated as ringleader Ocean; it contrasts well with the smoldering Garcia.  Cheadle is a hoot, if vastly under-used, but that's the problem with ensemble movies.  Brad Pitt, in a standout role, manages to act rather than just coast on his good looks.  Ocean and Ryan are a natural fit, like Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock.  I'd like to see their characters in another picture.
The only real stumbling block in my mind is the romantic triangle involving Danny, Tess and Terry.  Roberts and Clooney just don't click.  There simply are no sparks between them, as there were between, say, Clooney and Jennifer Lopez in the crackerjack ""Out of Sight"".  This made it difficult for me to care about their fractured relationship, and whether or not they would ever make up.  In fact, it was pretty much the only sour note in the movie, but it was a big one; it just felt tacked on (pretty much like Frank Sinatra's and Angie Dickinson's relationship in the original).
And so, to sum up this too-long review:  ""Ocean's 11"" is not a classic like ""The Sting"", but it's pretty good nonetheless. My grade:  B+.",1007856000,,2701,5.074660633484163
507506,5,6302712017,"I have to admit I was skeptical of Ocean's Eleven and all its hype, and I'm not the biggest George Clooney fan, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I wasn't a huge fan of Traffic, but I did enjoy Soderbergh's cinematic style, and he does it again with Ocean's Eleven.  After a few minutes into the film, you're already rooting for the bad guys.
The movie has a solid cast, with George Clooney and Brad Pitt as the two main characters.  They're both charismatic and the rest of the crew are great complements.  Matt Damon and Julia Roberts both do really well in their roles.  I enjoyed seeing the level of detail and planning put into the heist.  The special effects and how they manage to circumvent the myriad of security measures in place were an interesting dimension to the movie.
Bottom line, this is a really fun movie to go out and get engrossed in.  It may not be entirely plausible or full of emotion, but it is fast-paced, exciting, suspenseful, and just generally a nice movie to watch - the stars are all excellent and Soderbergh does a great job directing.  There's also plenty of comedic moments.  I loved it and want to go see it again to catch all the little things I missed the first time around.",1007856000,8,1216,4.46606334841629
507507,5,6302712017,"Even though I am wary of Hollywood fare I went to this with a feeling of trust becasue as many know George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh really put their heart into this movie as well as the rest of the cast who took a big paycut from their regular paychecks. Actors should do this more often for the sake of a good movie. Their main goal was to provided first class entertainment that people should normally expect from Hollywood but don't always get and they succedeed brillaintly. This movie is one heck of a good time! Even if you have seen this plot before it doesn't matter, this movie is a fun ride. It makes me nostalgic seeing them in all their Hollywood glory just like in the good old days, especially Clooney who almost steals the show though Brad Pitt almost does the same as well and since Julia Roberts only shows up now and then the audience relishes her every appearance. The rest of the cast also does a great job as well. All the guys are so diverse that it's interesting and funny seeing all their different personalities and how they interact. This is probably the best thing about this movie aside from the direction. The direction is of course stylish. There's lots of great shots of the sights of Las Vegas and the movie keeps up at a very brisk pace though the direction never borders on turning into a music video from MTV. The suspense comes not from whether they will end up with the money but how they will pull it off and Soderbergh showcases a lot of new technology to make the heist very exciting and he makes it look like it's easy to rob a vegas casino even though it isn't but I believe this was intentional. Some of these guys barely break a sweat! Throughout the whole thing Clooney and Pitt more or less keep the kind of cool,nonchanlant attitude we would not expect from people in real life but hey, it's the movies! This movie is first class entertainment which almost anybody can enjoy. So while watching this let the little gray cells take a vacation and have fun!",1007769600,,2006,4.439024390243903
507508,4,6302712017,"Steven Soderbergh is on a roll. Last year he awed the movie industry with his double-whammy of ERIN BROCKOVICH and TRAFFIC, becoming one of only a slight few directors to ever be nominated Best Director for two different films in the same year. Now, Soderbergh strikes again with OCEAN'S ELEVEN.OCEAN'S ELEVEN is a classic heist movie, but updated with a post-modern sensibility. The story is simple, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is released from jail and immediately sets into motion a plan to rob three Las Vegas casinos. He meets up with an old pal and confidante (Brad Pitt) and the two form an ensemble team to pull off the heist. Ocean has personal reasons for this particular job, mainly to get his ex-wife (Julia Roberts) back from the malicious casino owner (Andy Garcia) who stole her. Clooney and Pitt have the bulk of the dialogue, but the ensemble cast also includes such stalwarts as Matt Damon, Elliot Gould, Carl Reiner, and Don Cheadle. Each performer brings just the right nuances to their roles, and though most of these actors are stars by their own right, none break the unity of the ensemble cast and steal the show. OCEAN'S ELEVEN is engaging (I only looked at my watch once) and seems to be a better movie than the Rat Pack version from which it originated. In fact, the film seems more like THE STING or THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR than the original OCEAN'S ELEVEN.Though the plot is perdictable; you know almost from the start that Ocean is going to succeed in his scam; knowing that doesn't really take anything away from the movie. However, the suspense leading up to the heist could have been built up a little more. Also, there were a few elements that could have added to the actual suspense of the heist itself (the grease man gets his hand smashed in a door-that could have been used a little more e.g.).Overall OCEAN'S ELEVEN is an entertaining movie that is sure to bring Soderbergh and Clooney (one of the film's producers) more kudos and perhaps bring about more movies with all-star casts that don't cost much to make (the film was made for a relatively low $30 million). It's a nice piece of stimulating movie mind candy.",1007769600,,2156,4.691292875989446

The all-star cast carried the film so well. I have to admit, it was quite hard paying attention to the plot when Brad Pitt, George Clooney, and Matt Damon are on the same screen but I managed. I would say this movie combined the action of ""Mission Impossible"" and comedy of ""Bandits"". Every line was hilarious and allowed the script to escape from the ""action movie"" serious mood. Julia Roberts portrayed her character wonderfully and was a perfect match for George. I was a bit confused at the end but still loved every minute.

507520,4,6302712017,"Finally someone in Hollywood has realized that re-making a great movie never works; try updating a dud instead. And Ocean's Eleven was a dud....self-indulgent and lifeless, it seemed to exist just so the Rat-Pack could get paid to hang out together.
  So here comes the remake. I have to admit that I wasn't interested in seeing it, but the good reviews made me take a chance. And I loved it! Steven Soderbergh's film just zips along, and is fun the whole way through. I had a smile on my face from beginning to end.
  Daniel Ocean (George Clooney) has just been released from prison, and is barely out the door before he's getting a crew together and plotting an audacious heist that, if successful, could net his 11-man team a cool $160 Million. The team is comprised of, among others, Matt Damon, Elliott Gould, Carl Reiner, Scott Caan, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, and Brad Pitt. (Pitt is especially good as Clooney's unflappable sidekick; I thought he stole the film away from Clooney.) Andy Garcia is the cold-as-ice Casino owner; he makes a great villain. It's funny how the movie gets us to root FOR the bad guys (the theives), and boo the person who, in any other situation, would have our sympathy. Very well done, indeed.
 If I loved the movie that much, why only 4 stars? 2 words: JULIA ROBERTS. I don't like her. The movie grinds to a halt whenever she's onscreen. I found her character to be a pointless distraction, and she serves no point in the film, other than as Marquee value. And her mouth is HUGE!!!! Her lips look like two raw clams are stuck to her mouth.......(Sorry, but I just don't like her....)

So when I say that I almost completely forgot about the original while watching this movie, I mean that as high praise.  George Clooney makes the part of Danny Ocean completely his own from the moment he first appears.  I would point out that he's ably assisted by his supporting cast, but considering that cast includes Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia, Julia Robberts, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner, Casey Affleck, and Elliot Gould, that should be self-evident.
Perfectly paced, this caper movie hoodwinks the viewer as cleverly as it does the marks in its story.  The pieces are all there, but director Steven Soderbergh doesn't reveal all the information in a straightforward manner, and keeps from spoiling the fun.  We don't know every aspect of the plan, so the surprises are genuine.  On the one hand, it never seems like anything is being left out, and on the other, it never feels like the movie cheats.  It's a delicate balance, but the movie pulls it off magnificently.
And then, when you think it can't get any better, there's the ""introducing Julia Roberts"" credit at the end.  I smell another Oscar nomination in Mr. Soderbergh's future ...",1007769600,,1237,4.829383886255924

It's all executed through confidence scheme after elaborate confidence scheme using high-tech surveillance equipment, low-tech costumes & props, and even borderline terrorism with EMP bombs.

507523,4,6302712017,"""Ocean's 11,"" directed by Steven Soderbergh, is a remake of a 1960 film of the same name. That first film co-starred the notorious ""Rat Pack,"" which included Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. Soderbergh's version stars George Clooney as Danny Ocean, an ex-convict who organizes a team of 11 criminals for an audacious plot: to rob the vault of Las Vegas casinos owned by super-rich Terry Benedict (played with a nice edge by Andy Garcia).
""O11"" is a very entertaining film: an effective mix of humor, character drama, inventive plot twists, and high-tech thrills. The superb ensemble cast includes Julia Roberts (as Clooney's love interest), Matt Damon (as a pickpocket), and Brad Pitt (as a master card player). The ensemble members have great chemistry together. Clooney follows up terrific roles in ""The Perfect Storm"" and ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" with his role as Ocean. Clooney is charming and likeable, and his expressive eyes bring a nice wistful touch to his performance.
The film is also greatly enlivened by the versatile Don Cheadle as a British demolitions expert. Elliot Gould is hilarious as a rival to Garcia's character: watch out for his outrageous costumes. But my favorite performance in the film belongs to show biz legend Carl Reiner as an aging con man; he is outstanding, and quite endearing, in his double-layered role.
Some aspects of the plot are a bit far-fetched, and I must admit to a degree of unease with a film that essentially glorifies destructive criminal behavior. But the film's strong points are evident. I particularly like how the film evokes the excitement, glamour, and intrigue of the high-stakes Las Vegas scene.

507527,5,6302712017,"Call it improbable, or even a highly imaginative flight of fancy; either/and/or, all of the above are correct.  But whatever you choose to call it, this is one of the sleekest and slickest caper movies you're ever likely to run across, and what you're really going to end up calling it is pure Entertainment (yes, with a capital ""E"").  Incomparable escapist fare, impeccably crafted and delivered by director Steven Soderbergh and a dynamite cast, ""Ocean's Eleven"" is a joy ride that gives you a chance to root for the bad guys and feel wickedly good while you're doing it.  Because, after all, what's so bad about a bunch of regular guys ripping off a bazillionaire casino owner, who in the first place isn't such a great guy himself?  Remember, the key word here is ""escapist""; don't worry about moralizing while you're watching this one, because a movie like this is made to let you to live vicariously for a couple of hours, so just sit back, relax and go with the flow.  Just remember:  These are professionals; don't try this at home.
 When Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is released from prison, he doesn't waste any time.  Taking a rather indirect route after leaving the place he's called home for some time, he winds up in Las Vegas where he quite simply plans to rob three casinos owned by one Harry Benedict (Andy Garcia), an extremely meticulous businessman, who is also-- if his reputation serves correctly-- an extremely ruthless individual.  He's not a guy you want to mess with.  So why does Ocean want to pick on Benedict, who has the means and the muscle to crush him like a bug with a mere nod of his head?  Suffice to say it has something to do with a personal agenda, as well as the possibility of a paycheck worth around $160 million, which-- even after splitting with the ten other guys he's about to recruit for the job-- will land him a share that won't be too bad for a day's work.  And, of course, there's the challenge; Danny Ocean and his buddies are about to attempt the impossible.  What he is proposing is something that has never before been accomplished, a gamble with nearly insurmountable odds; but, hey, this is Vegas-- and that's what it's all about.
 To be sure, Soderbergh had the deck stacked in his favor right out of the chute with the cast he assembled for this film; but like any self-respecting odds-makers in Vegas will tell you, nothing is a sure thing.  Soderbergh still had to mix all the ingredients just right-- cast, story, photography, music, action, humor-- to make it cook.  Well, he may not get the Oscar for Best Director for it, but if there's a Golden Chef's Hat Award, he's a shoo-in for preparing this feast.  This is a veritable smorgasbord for the senses; it's easy on the eyes, it'll give you some laughs and make you feel good, it's easy to digest and in the end is a totally satisfying experience.  There may not be anything ground breaking about this movie, and certainly nothing especially new, but Soderbergh presents it with nuance and finesse, as well as that special artistic touch of his that is so definitive of his work.  Neither was a haystack anything new in Monet's day when he chose it as a subject for one of his paintings, and the rest is history.  It's how the artist renders the subject on canvas that's important, and it is in this that Soderbergh excels.
 As Danny Ocean, George Clooney demonstrates that he has the charm of Grant, the magnetism of a young Brando and the down-home agreeableness of Jimmy Stewart.  With his personality alone, he defines Ocean in no uncertain terms.  From the opening frame you know exactly who this guy is.  Still, there are a few surprises along the way that keeps him interesting.  Mostly though, he's just enjoyable to watch as he puts his plan into action, and it's easy to believe he's who he is and doing what he's doing.  And that's part of the charm of this movie and, moreover, goes to show you what a good performance Clooney actually gives here.  Unlikely as the story may be, he sells it in such a way that it works; and as the customer, you not only buy it, but walk away with the extended warranty and go home satisfied.  And that's a good bit of acting in anyone's book.
 And though Clooney is clearly the star of the show, Brad Pitt checks in as Ocean's friend, Rusty Ryan, and emerges on fairly equal footing with his illustrious co-star.  Like Clooney, Pitt turns on the charm and serves up Rusty as a credible enough figure, with a performance that may not be much of a stretch for him, but one that is certainly engaging.  The character is lacking somewhat in depth and definition, but Pitt manages to give you a clear idea of who Rusty is without too much by way of development.  Call it a fast-food characterization; nevertheless, Pitt does a good job, and for all intents and purposes, he makes the character work.
 The single question mark in the casting may be with Julia Roberts as Tess, Ocean's estranged wife.  She looks good and gives a solid, if not memorable performance, but she seems to miss the mark slightly in capturing the true essence of the character, which may have been better served by someone like Catherine Zeta-Jones or even Rene Russo.  But that's a purely subjective observation, and I'm sure there are those who will argue that Roberts was perfect for the role.  In either case, Tess is an integral part of the story, and Roberts neither enhances nor distracts from the overall proceedings; most importantly, she does make Tess believable.  And in the end, with a terrific supporting cast (too lengthy to mention here), ""Ocean's Eleven"" is one you don't want to miss.",1007683200,,5634,4.609218436873747
507528,4,6302712017,"I saw Ocean's Eleven last night at a sneak preview screening in Los Angeles. Overall it was an entertaining film that lacked edge and originality. Soderbergh must have made the studio suits happy with this one--mainstream, marketable and extremely safe. No risk-taking for Soderbergh on this film. The only gritty Soderbergh trace was that he rebelliously shot handheld from time to time--(just like he does on all of his movies).
A positive note is that it's fluffy entertainment for the whole family. It's a Disney bank robbery movie with the highest paid actors in film history running around Las Vegas in shiny suits. Its so cookie-cutter you could take your six year old with you only be ready to explain to him why he can't have the Clooney action figure in the Valentino tux this Christmas after the show.
Other positives: Casey Affleck and Scott Caan were funny as bickering mormon brothers. Andy Garcia did a good job considering the cliched writing for his character. Julia Roberts was Julia Roberts.
To sum it all up,worth seeing if you bring your suspension of disbelief hat with you, your happy ending sweater and the youngest member of your family so that he can enjoy the first ever made-for-kids heist movie.",1007683200,,1224,4.889423076923077
507529,5,6302712017,You are crazy if you don't get into your car and drive to the nearest theater that is showing this film on Dec. 7th.  I would say that this is the biggest hit of the year. Not only for the reasons of the cast; which is by far the strongest we've seen in a while.  The plot is interesting and keeps you engaged for the whole time the movie is showing.  There isn't one slow moment in the film.  The storyline is great and I would recommend this movie to anybody at all.  You can take any age person to this as there are no scenes than would be innapropriate for anybody.  I would say congratulations to the crew of this film for making the biggest blockbuster of the year.,1007078400,35,671,4.123076923076923
