1691877,5,B000063S6O,"I use this video for my own child and with children I baby-sit for.  The parents are so impressed with the ""lessons"" their children are getting, and I am thrilled that my daughter is learning French without MY bad accent.  The video covers manners (words like please and thank you) and a basic vocabulary for a young child.  There is enough repetition so they can really pick it up, but it is done with a sense of fun, and even some French music.  My daughter can count to ten in several languages, at the age of three, thanks to the wonderful folks at Brainy Baby!",1046044800,4,565,4.352380952380952
1691878,5,B000063S6O,"I enrolled my twin toddlers in French classes this fall (2002) and purchased this video as added lessons at home.  My little ones enjoy it so much that sometimes they watch it two to three times in a row.  What is truly amazing is that now when they see the picture of an object in the video, they say the word in French before hearing it first!",1038700800,6,345,4.134328358208955
1691879,5,B000063S6O,"the tape is simple with limited vocabulary.  It is organized well with lots of smiling children and songs interspersed between the vocabulary.  My one year old granddaughter can count for five on her fingers in French, thanks to this group.  I wish I could find subsequent tapes in the series.
Tre Bien!",1037318400,8,303,4.788461538461538
1691991,5,B000063S6O,"Our son is almost 2 and is half French, half Chinese.  This DVD has surpassed Elmo in demand, which is amazing.  He is distinguishing between the two languages, as well as English, and this DVD entertains him with its comfortably slow pace, repetitive frames, and vivid colors.

He repeats the words as he hears them which to us, is the sign of a successful learning aid.

Ignore the negative reviews, particularly those with bad spelling ; )",1113004800,6,442,4.701298701298701
1691992,5,B000063S6O,I purchased this DVD for our 3 year old daughter and within 2 days we had her counting in French. It was very slow paced and repeatative. She loved it and we were able to refresh our skills as well. Ignore the negative ratings and give this a shot. You will find yourself speaking French in small amounts but something is better than nothing.,1110585600,6,342,4.359375
1691993,4,B000063S6O,"I'm pretty pleased with this title as my little one has managed to grasp a couple of french words. He is only 20 months (1yr 8mths), but he understands and can utter a few french words and can now count from 1-10 in french.

We are from Malaysia, therefore English and Malay are our first two languages, (which my son already understands and converses in pretty well for his age). I wanted to expose him to other languages, so that is why I bought the French and Spanish Brainy Baby titles. I have yet to start him on the Spanish title though.

It's a good introductory DVD, but I guess the only way you will get your children to be fluent in any language is to converse with them on a daily basis in the languages that you want them to be fluent in. So basically I would recommend this DVD to parents who would like to expose their little ones to French. I won't recommend it to parents who expect their little ones to be able to converse fluently in french by watching this dvd. For that they should hire a french tutor!",1108857600,9,1022,4.262886597938144
1691994,4,B000063S6O,"I almost didn't buy this DVD for my daughter based on the few negative reviews of it. Well, I'm glad I didn't listen to them, because I think this DVD is quite good for young children learning French. It's true that the DVD should include the articles with nouns (it should say ""une balle"" and not ""balle""), but I watch it along with my 2 year old and say UNE balle or UN livre where appropriate. As for the voice on the DVD, my French husband and mother-in-law could not say for sure if it was a native French speaker, but they agreed that her accent is perfectly good and will not lead your child to pronounce French improperly.

  We just got this for Christmas and my daughter has requested it several times. Although her father and I often talk to her in French, she only speaks in English. I'm hoping this DVD will help her feel confident in her French. Already she is having fun repeating the words along with the DVD, and it brings us great joy to hear her speaking French, even if it is just repetition!",1104364800,12,1012,4.315789473684211
1691995,1,B000063S6O,"I too am very disappointed in wasting money on this video.  You just can't use the simple noun without the article when speaking French.  And there are mistakes in the video as well.  If you are teaching your child how to speak a language, you want them to learn it correctly.",1077840000,27,276,4.372549019607843
1691996,1,B000063S6O,"First of all, the above is true. I made the poor mistake of buying both --mostly because the other one was so terrible and I thought this one would be better. It was terrible for all of the reasons the reviewer below describes and I'll add a few more: 1. I really hate the fact that the words are not introduced with their articles, as they are supposed to be in French. You never just say ""ball"" in French as we do in English, you would say either ""un ballon"" or ""le ballon"" (""the ball"", ""a ball""). Moreover, without the articles, you don't learn the gender of the nouns, something we don't have in English and one of the most difficult things for us to learn in foreign languages. I am STILL struggling with genders after 20 years of speaking french (because I am not a native speaker but have lived in France for many years). More aggregiously, instead of including one of the many charming French childrens songs, in their only musical selection, they include a translation of ""Mary had a Little Lamb (it doesn't even rhyme). This is all quite disappointing bc the whole point of teaching your child a foreign language at this age is that they don't need to learn it in translation (or in an English language context) they can learn it within the French language and cultural context. PLEASE, don't waste your money. I can only imagine that the Spanish language version contains all of these same problems. ........",1072915200,116,1419,4.568627450980392
1691997,5,B000063S6O,"This DVD has been indispensable to me.  I have worked on the French language with my daughter and she has done beautifully with this DVD.  I have also used this DVD with children who already spoke French.  They all loved it.  The vocabulary is directed at preschool age children.  I suspect that the editors just know how to hold a child's attention, the happy children we see are just charming (and from many races too, which I LOVE!) and the music is fun too.",1053388800,8,461,4.440476190476191
1691998,3,B000063S6O,"My 2-year old does not really like this video. He gets bored and does other things when he is watching it. The fact that he already speaks some French may contribute to this, I am not sure. I was not impressed either.",1052092800,6,217,4.190476190476191
1691999,5,B000063S6O,"I bought this video to introduce my son to French. I am very pleased with all that it covers. It reviews the numbers 1-10, colors, common nouns, some parts of the body, Mommy, Daddy, common verbs, hello, goodbye, yes, no, and how to say please and I love you. It does some reviews with questions and answers for things like, ""How many books are there? There is one book."", or ""What color is the snowman? The snowman is white."" (obviously in French). The words for all of these are displayed in French on the screen in large print and in English in small print. There is a lot of repetion to reinforce the lessons. They missed some obvious things, like how to say thanks you and some parts of the body (like arms), but I guess you can't get everything in.  They also sing Mary had a Little Lamb in French(no words are shown onscreen while doing this, which would have been nice, but they are available in the music video segment). But, overall, a very good dvd and worth purchasing.
The Brainy Baby Spanish DVD uses the same content, but in Spanish. I also recommend it.",1047859200,15,1069,4.426395939086294
7959720,1,B000063S6O,"The dvd begins with way too much advertisement for the company (Brainy Baby), and is slow in progressing through the stages. The faces of the babies are attractive for toddlers to watch, but this is a product for babies 6 mos- to 1 year maximum.
At one point, the translation was ridiculous: for toes, they translated it to ""les doigts des pieds"" Really???? What happened to the correct translation which is 'orteilles'?
The content was over simplified and then suddenly broken off without warning. Half of the content was not on there. Please don't waste your money on this. If I didn't have to pay for return shipping charges, I would send it back. Very bad value.",1514073600,,666,4.700854700854701

7959722,5,B000063S6O,"I gave this to my best friends little boy who is 3.  He takes French lessons at his school and loves it so I decided to get him this video.  When he opened it, his mom put the video in for him to watch and he didn't move. He loved it so much.  He was mesmorized from beginning to end.",1231200000,,284,3.7
7959723,2,B000063S6O,"Yes I do agree with other reviewers that this program has 2 major flows, for a good part of the words introduced there is now article (very important in French) and why didn't they pick a French narrator? (her French is pretty good and her foreign accent only shows in some words and sentences, still when you make a language video pleeaaase take a native with a standard accent). Same for the script, some awkwardness to it (for instance homme de neige instead of bonhomme de neige) shows that it was not made by a native. Another problem with this program is that they mostly introduce words, some times with articles and adjectives but not really sentences. I think it is very important for children to get the music of the language early and also to be able to recognize a word once it is in a sentence. For this reason I would really recommended the Little Pim 3 DVDs series over this one. In that program (which has the articles and is narrated by a French native) after being introduced alone with their articles, the words are used in simple every day sentences. When I see Little Pim French program I always think it is like someone was reading in my mind when I was thinking all the flaws of Brainy Baby and what should be done to improve it and made this perfect program that kids love.
So as a conclusion I would say when Little Pim was not here, parents who do not speak (well) French could certainly show it to there kids, but now I would say without hesitation get LITTLE PIM first:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Pim-3-Disc-Gift-Set-French/dp/B0010GWP2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Pim: 3-Disc Gift Set (French)</a>",1225065600,4,1682,4.905263157894737
7959724,1,B000063S6O,"I was very disappointed in this product. The whole quality of this DVD is very much bellow all its similar competitive DVDs.
The picture quality is bad. The whole layout for the scenes is very poorly done. As if someone had done the whole thing on a home video over night. The  narrator's french  has a very heavy accent (which I do not recognize the origin).
I do not recommend this product. I would however recommend the Baby Einsteins series. They have a multitude language selection and their french audio is good.",1210118400,3,518,4.619565217391305
7959725,4,B000063S6O,"I really like it and my son found it very benificial
The only comments i have are:
1- It is the same DVD as the english one (it has the same content), i could have run it from the previous DVD, using the Frensh language.
2- I wish to be able to scroll through the DVD to see the content of each chapters
3- My Son loves the extras that are provided in the menu",1202601600,,360,3.8133333333333335

This DVD is proving to be very helpful in reinforcing the language during the rest of the week.  Yes, it is true that the articles are not given with many of the words, but this should not be the only tool used for teaching your child another language.  The images are beautiful and completely capture my daughter's attention.  I am very happy with it!",1177632000,2,466,4.395348837209302
7959727,3,B000063S6O,"I saw this product and was instantly interested and excited. That is, till I read the reviews, which lead me to investigate Netflix to see if they carried it since I know none of the local rental stores have this series. Netflix does carry this line of dvds enabling one to rent it and test it first before buying. I, like many other parents, want the best educational products for my children to learn and grow and be exposed to culture and other languages; therefore, I believe being able to read reviews, getting other parents' and educators' opinions, and test products before buying is essential! I plan on testing this product and then most likely purchasing a few from this series of Brainy Baby dvds, as I already have all the Baby Einstein dvds that my children still love (1 & 2 1/2). I hope this was at least a little help to someone out there and I will leave another review after I've actually seen the dvd.

7959728,3,B000063S6O,"This item is definitely more useful than it is not.  After only 3 viewings, my almost 3-year could count to 20 in French and his 20-month-old brother started labelling objects in French.  I was amazed as French will be their third language.

My only reservation now is that I do hear the non-French accent coming out when they speak.  My French is very good, but of course they think the DVD's perfect and don't think Mom knows what she's talking about!  So, I'm looking for a slightly more advanced product geared towards young pre-schoolers...",1140739200,10,545,4.75531914893617

It really helps that the images are REAL and not animation or puppets that babies don't relate to! For a beginner french for babies, it is fine, although, yes, there are a few mistakes, (i am from Quebec), but not enough to make any real difference for babies to learn french. I like that the ENTIRE video is to TEACH french, and Baby Einstein is mainly images and music, NOT enough spoken french at ALL.  I am finding trouble finding ANTOHER dvd like Brainy Baby. I would like more of these.",1136073600,9,644,4.35
