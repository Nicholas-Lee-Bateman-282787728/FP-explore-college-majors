8367416,4,B002EB6LVA,It's a bootleg but you won't find the original english dub films cheaper and are of excellent quality.,1456963200,,102,4.722222222222222
8367417,5,B002EB6LVA,"My daughter and I were so excited when we received this yesterday and we were singing the theme song the whole time while I was unwrapping the dvd to put into the player. However within 5 minutes of the dvd playing it started freezing. It wouldn't be for like maybe like 2-3 seconds but it was doing it every 30 seconds to a minute. this makes viewing the movie not as enjoyable since you are getting frustrated with the constant freezing... Maybe I got a bad product so I have contacted the seller. The quality is not bad at all.

Update: I contacted the seller and got an immediate response! They asked which disk was defective and sent me a new one!! I have now changed my 3 star to 5 star! My daughter and I have watched it over a dozen times now!",1456963200,,751,4.215277777777778
8367418,4,B002EB6LVA,"Might be bootleg... At this point, I don't totally care, as I know I'll buy the official ones later on, but to have the voices I grew up with... Man I'm so happy. Quality is fine, could always be better, but I didn't expect it to be amazing. If you are okay with that, and can handle it, I'd say this is a fine investment.",1454889600,,322,3.9692307692307693
8367419,5,B002EB6LVA,"My daughter (4) has every season of Sailor Moon, a blanket, shirts, posters, birthday party, you name it. She loves Sailor Moon. So I knew I wanted to find her the movies as well with out having to send my first born and an arm. I found these and thought ""What the hey."" Was worth the $20+shipping. I would have paid double! Worth every penny and then some. Has English and Japanese audio and also both for subtitles. Great case, artwork and discs. I'm sure it's a bootleg, but you can't tell! Thank you so much for providing these at an affordable price!",1423785600,2,555,4.398058252427185

8367422,1,B002EB6LVA,"The Sailor Moon Movie collection was never released like this but released in what was called the Dream Collection (Pioneer - VHS Pink Box or Geneon Signature Series - DVD blue box).

This particular set pictured is region free and has Chinese characters on the box which are a good indicator this is a definite bootleg.  As seen on Sailor Moon - ebay guide bootleg list, this set is a fold out with cheap packaging and includes art from all 3 movies in the inside of the set.  The legit set is not like this!

All official US Sailor Moon boxsets are region 1 and Pioneer/Geneon signature releases. If you want the Sailor Movies as a boxset this is the legit set:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sailor-Moon-The-Movies-The-Dream-Set-Uncut-Special-Edition/dp/B00005NX1M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sailor Moon: The Movies - The Dream Set (Uncut Special Edition)</a>.
