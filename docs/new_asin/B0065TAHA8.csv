8493587,4,B0065TAHA8,"It really is a good drama and good subtitling but I only gave it 4 stars because the lead actor goes a little overboard in trying to be a badass.

8493590,5,B0065TAHA8,"The title pretty much says it all. I watched this on Hulu and I was completely blown away by it. The story had just about anything you can want: action, romance, political intrigue, comedy, human drama, and a bittersweet finale. The actors play their roles perfectly and the attention to setting and costumes rivals that of Game of Thrones. This medieval story centers on Dae Gil a nobleman who has taken up the mantle of slave hunter to find the runaway slave that he'd fallen in love with years earlier. In the process he gets caught up in a slave rebellion and a mission to save a prince from assassins.",1351987200,4,606,4.5181818181818185
