7893738,1,6305621640,"One of the worst action movies ever. The acting that was bad. The special affects were awful. The ending just plain stupid. As usual the delta team wipe out huge amounts of bad guys and never even get touched dispite the fact that you couldn't miss em with a BB gun let alone an AK 47. The ending was stupid some how one of the main characters manages to escape an exploding sub thats 300 metres under water. The special affects looked like someone had used cardboard models, and every time an explosion goes off it looks like a firework display. Save ya money.",1092441600,2,561,4.403846153846154
