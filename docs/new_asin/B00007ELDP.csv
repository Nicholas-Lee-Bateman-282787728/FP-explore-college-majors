1808291,5,B00007ELDP,"The title of this review is quote of what Charley said at Willy's funeral and he is absolutely right. It is true that Willy's deluded and unachiavable dreams lead to his miserable downfall, but it is also true that it is that exact illusions and dreams that keep Willy alive in the first place. They are his only weapon against the toisome reality that surrounds him. As Hap mentions just before Willy comes to the restaurant, Willy is never as happy as when he is looking forward to something. What he is constantly looking forward to is the fulfilment of his dreams.
In his essay ""Tragedy and the common man"" Arthur Miller says that each tragic hero is characterized by a 'tragic flaw'. It is the desire of that character to oppose what he does not like and this leads to his decline. Willy does not act ""act agains the things that degrade"" (Miller, Tragedy and the Common Man) him, he dreams against it.
I very much enjoyed this movie, because it reaches deep into the mind and the soul of a common person just like me. All of Willy's innner struggles are more or less something we all have to go through in one form or another. Willy's experience can be a lesson to all of us, the common people.",1070496000,2,1199,4.429864253393665
1808292,5,B00007ELDP,"Dustin Hoffman stars in this film reproduction of the play, Death of a Salesman by Arthur Miller. It contains superb acting, especially on behalf of Hoffman and by one of my favorite actors, John Malkovich.
The story delves into the hardships and broken dreams of the main character, Willy Loman, who represents the average joe. Because of this, it is very easy to become entrapped in the life of the struggling characters that are representative of the all too common man.
This movie is a compelling drama; the audience becomes sucked in and sympathetic towards the deteriorating family. It is the ultimate representation of the failure of the American dream.
The movie at times may drag for those who are only interested in action and special effects.  There is no focus on elaborate scenery or props; instead the main focus is directed towards the poignant acting that is very well delivered by a well chosen cast.",1070496000,7,917,4.878205128205129
1808293,5,B00007ELDP,"This is a wonderful movie. Even though it was mandatory for my literature course, I can say I really loved it. I even borrowed the DVD from my professor to watch it again back home ...
Most people look pessimistic when directors try to recreate some world-famous literature masterpieces in their latest movie productions. Even though they might be right, one should take into account the stellar cast and the director as well. With such an actor as Dustin Hoffman, an Academy Award winner who received an Emmy Award for his role of Willie Loman in the movie, and internationally renowned German director Volker Schlondorff, the success of the production was simply inevitable.
With so many action movies out there full of stunning effects and computer graphics, the viewers were thirsty for a real old-school type production. When this DVD came out in January 2003, it filled this genre gap and, to my opinion, achieved good popularity not only among the connoisseurs. To my opinion, it is a brilliant asset to the film world...",1070496000,2,1028,4.913793103448276
1808294,5,B00007ELDP,"Seeing the filmed version of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman left me with an intense feeling of sadness. It is a real-life story without any ""decorations."" It a story about the choices we sometimes make and their consequences.
Willy Loman is a common, fallible man, who realizes that in spite of his high hopes and efforts he has not achieved anything real in life. His sons are not what he wanted them to be, especially Biff. Willy  made some major wrong choices and he is definitely not the ""winning-type"" of a man but he loves his family.
I personally saw something of my father in Willy Loman, and probably that is why it was so appealing for me. But I do not think I can see the movie again. I will simply not be able to.
Volker Schlondorff did a wonderful job, in my opinion. The actors' playing is more than excellent. I think Willy Loman's role is the best one Dustin Hoffman has ever played. John Malkovich also makes a remarkable performance as well as all the other actors",1070409600,3,987,4.45303867403315
1808295,4,B00007ELDP,"I was glad to find this DVD just shortly after reading the play.  While I enjoyed reading it very much, I found the play to be very confusing.  Just from the text alone it was hard to tell what was real and what wasn't.  Seeing the film version of this triumphant play really helped a lot.  ""Death of a Salesman"" is a sad and tragic drama that emotionally involves you from start to finish.
Willy Loman is a tired and heart-broken salesman who no longer lives in the world of reality.  Instead, he is trapped in his world of delusions.  Each day that passes by seems to be worse and worse for Willy.  He spends way too much of his time in the past when he needs to be focusing on the future.  His wife and two sons have no idea what they should do for him as they know that he is heading towards disaster in this unforgettable drama.
Like I said, to actually see this really made me appreciate the play more than just reading it from the text.  It can get confusing when you only have the words, but when you see it performed it all comes together and make sense.  The acting is terrific.  Dustin Hoffman really does an outstanding job of playing Willy Loman.  Not only does he just ""act"" the part out, he ""becomes"" Loman.  I admit that I had my doubts at first, because I didn't see him playing the part.  My doubts quickly fled from my mind after the first 10 minutes or so.  Everybody else is also terrific as well.  (Wow, look how young John Malkovitch looks!)  I think the movie does a fine job doing Arthur Miller's play justice.
The DVD is pretty neat as well.  The picture quality is good, considering the fact that it is an old movie.  The DVD also includes a feature length documentary behind the movie, which is really entertaining, and a still gallery.  While it may seem like this DVD doesn't have a lot to offer, the documentary really makes it worth-while.
""Death of a Salesman"" is a powerhouse drama that hooks you from start to finish.  Reading it is one thing, but to actually see it makes it much more enjoyable.  If you just read the play from the text it can be pretty confusing at points.  If you're looking for a great dramatic movie with great acting and writing, then this is something you should really think about checking out.",1044489600,50,2254,4.339712918660287

1808313,5,B00007ELDP,I saw this version of Death of a Salesman in College in 1987.

Comedian George Carlin was famous for saying the only thing truthful about the American Dream was it's name because you had to be asleep to believe in it.  I think that is too harsh. The American story is full of rags to riches stories but I do think the message this film conveys is dreaming is not enough you must be doing and building.  I have seen other Death of a Salesman and this is the one that is perfectly cast and nothing but talent. Each actor is perfectly cast for their part.

1808318,5,B00007ELDP,"By Darrell Stoddard, darrellstoddard@gmail.com

This motion picture staring Dustin Hoffman and the 1951 production staring Fredric March as Willie Lowman, rank among the highest Cinematic achievements of mankind. I spent a big part of my life in motion pictures so this is no idle comment.

Several years ago I read all of the books on the reading list for English majors at BYU. The only thing on the list that was written after World War 2 was Arthur Miller's Pulitzer Prize-winning play ""Death of a Salesman"". The superb motion picture with Fredric March playing the part of Willie Loman, I thought could never be surpassed, but Dustin Hoffman equaled it. Both films have elements that are unsurpassed.

You cannot find in motion pictures a more compelling story than either of these two great films.

See all of my Reviews. I write only about books, events, or motion pictures of eternal significance that have changed the course of history or unforgettable books or motion pictures that will totally change peoples lives.

1808322,5,B00007ELDP,Very well cast and very well scripted. I highly recommend this movie for teenager through adult. I've seen it twice now and have thoroughly enjoyed it both times. Fine acting and very professionally done.,1342915200,,204,5.029411764705882
1808323,1,B00007ELDP,"I warn you, I am not objective about this movie. My father was a lousy salesman, but he did not commit suicide. Instead, he went into a mental hospital in 1963 and never came out again, except to run away and have the state police bring him back.

I am also not objective about suicide because late husband committed suicide. I won't go into detail, but there is a lot of conflict in me about this topic, and therefore about this movie.

Willie Loman is a salesman who is losing his grip on reality. He lies, he has done so much lying that he doesn't know himself what the truth is anymore. He keeps hallucinating his wealthy brother and talking to him when the people in the room think he's talking to them. He shouts at people, won't give them a chance to talk, won't listen when they do. He's taught his sons to lie to him because they learned early on that it was necessary to tell him what he wanted to hear. When they try to tell him the truth, he does not listen.

But we are supposed to feel sorry for him. Feel compassion for him. I feel a great deal of compassion for his wife and his sons, but compassion for Willie himself comes a lot harder. However, Dustin Hoffman is such a great actor that he actually got me to cry for Willie a couple of times. Still, when he decides that he is worth more dead ($20,000 insurance policy) than alive, I can't help agreeing with him.

I'm not going to put any stars on this movie. Like I say, I'm not objective. But if you want to see a gut-wrenching performance by Dustin Hoffman as Willie Loman and John Malkovich as his son Biff, and if you can handle the surrealistic ""stage play"" type set, which annoyed the heck out of me, then watch this movie. I can't. Not again.",1337385600,5,1720,4.250764525993884
1808324,1,B00007ELDP,"The main trouble with this version of ""Death of a Salesman,"" in my opinion, is that instead of clarifying some of the dangers of our highly competitive culture, main character Loman is here made to seem a mental case, a victim almost entirely of his own little abnormal delusions as opposed to being affected by anything questionable in American society.  Therefore his story becomes of very little significance.  As at least two other people have concluded, Hoffman's portrayal makes Loman into an ""insect-like"" little man.  The story is much more worthwhile if, as in other versions, one gets the feeling that Loman's problems could happen to a great many of us.  Lest you think I'm a Communist or something, I'm definitely not against our capitalist system, but I do think that some of us get too viciously competitive; at least one doesn't have to have contempt for those with less ability than oneself.  Another problem with this version of ""Salesman,"" as I see it, is that both Hoffman's and Malkovich's acting is way too low-key, lacking the giant passions I like in the acting of such performers as George C. Scott or Lee J. Cobb, or even the understated but effective expressiveness of an actor like Gregory Peck or Henry Fonda.  Here, the cast shows far too little feeling to get me substantially involved.  No offense intended, but I won't lie about how the production seemed to me.",1303603200,19,1393,4.8277310924369745
1808325,5,B00007ELDP,"Director Volker Schlondorff's version of the Arthur Miller play really hits on all cylinders. The mood, pacing, characterization and accuracy of Death of a Salesman are masterfully blended into a well-thought production. One underappreciated aspect is successfully incorporating a play into a film.  Many times we have read a play only to watch a film version seem trite, forced or disappointingly unable to make the transition; Death of a Salesman doesn't have this problem, as many significant scenes, such as Biff's epiphany and confrontation with Willy, keep their power. Also, the key quotes from characters are given their moment.  Unlike many other reviewers, I haven't seen the Broadway Production of Death of a Salesman, so I can't compare this one to any other production, but I think this version will hold up nicely to other successful versions.

As far as the story itself, Death of a Salesman is a classic case for the failure of the American Dream. Willy Loman, an aging traveling salesman, is a tragic hero who loses touch with reality as he wavers between the present, 1942, and the past, 1928. Willy's tragic flaw is that he has false values that he takes as the proponents to success. Not only this, but he pushes these values onto his two sons, Happy and Biff. Willy's false belief that success in life can be attributed to personal appearance, being liked, and connections lays foundations for present day failures. We come to understand that Willy's glowing vision of the past is only an exaggeration for his idealistic hopes.  Willy not only has visions of the past, but seeks the answers to life from his dead brother Ben, who, unlike Willy, was a success early in life. Much of Willy's success as a salesman is exaggerated; his false pride gets in the way of any transformation. Happy and Biff, because of Willy's outlook, are also lost in the world, lack identity, and represent failures. Willy has inflated Biff's ego to the point where Biff lacks responsibility, and, as a result, Biff can't hold down a job. The film investigates the negative aspects of having wrong values, and how it can destroy hopes of the American Dream. Although Willy's state of mind is quite fractured, Linda (his wife) and the two sons, for the most part, do not attempt to confront him or his suicidal tendencies, ignoring the problem and thus emphasizing false perception. Biff, however, is the one character who finally wakes up and challenges Willy's views, and ""sees the light"" about the lie he's been living. Death of a Salesman proposes that having the wrong dreams can lead to tragic results.

A great job was done assembling a cast that really made this play come to life. Dustin Hoffman really gives the edginess to Willy Loman, yet he also makes Willy a sympathetic character, one who you feel sorry for by the time the credits are rolling. The other actors also do solid work. A young John Malkovich does a commendable job as Biff Loman, the one who Willy has high hopes for.

Also included within the DVD is Private Confessions, a documentary which sheds some light on background into the play and the idea of the traveling salesman. If you haven't read the play, this might be a good way to begin before viewing the film.

Over all, this is an excellent job of bringing Arthur Miller's play to life.  This is also is an exceptional resource for either a teacher or student who wants to use the film to help with the study of the play, which can be confusing to read with the various time shifts.

Fantastic production! Definitely recommended!",1276300800,6,3561,4.7960848287112565
1808326,5,B00007ELDP,"I will not insist on the plot which is so well-known that to ignore it is a proof of incompetent a-social behavior. I will insist here on the performance of Dustin Hoffman, hence on the particular rendition of this play that is kept as a play with real sound stages like in the old days of the thirties or forties. Dustin Hoffman makes this Willy Loman a lot worse than I was used to read it.  He is shown, and as soon as his prime, at least, when his sons are in high school, some seventeen years before, he is shown was I saying as a completely paranoid and deranged person. Not deranged because of some kind of gene. But deranged because first of all he got and kept a job even when he was failing, though he was not done for that job. A salesman has to be a born hypocrite and has to be a conqueror: any argument is good provided it brings in the proper signature. So he is rather misplaced and his derangement comes from that misplacement. What's more he was discovered in his total hypocrisy, though in no way commercial and hence unacceptable from the salesmanship point of view since this woman was bringing him nothing but was costing him a lot, by his own son who was coming after him to get the help he needed, but a help that could only be effective if it were based on the truth, truthfulness, confidence, trust. And Willy Loman was lower than low at that moment. It threw his son into some totally absurd and paranoid a-social attitude, a derangement of its own due to the misplacement of his trust in his own father. When that trust was placed back where it belonged, that is to say in the trashcan, the son only had his eyes to cry, his fingers to steal, his flesh to suffer, in prison if necessary. This film pushes the character of Willy Loman slightly too far and his derangement explains then his suicide: he completely lost control of himself. But I would assert the idea that this is not true of that character who in fact commits suicide when he discovers and finally understands that he had not forgotten that silly episode of his son discovering him in the cradle of the revolution with another woman than his mother. I would like to believe that this last act in his life is not the result of his derangement but of his last flash of guilt for having failed and cheated so many people, in a word a suicide of divine justice coming from the last flash of consciousness of that man who might have been able to be anything but a loser. Even if I disagree with the vision of Schlondorff, I must say the rendering of the character, the acting of the actor and at times the overbearing-ness of the over-acting of the actor is absolutely remarkable and logical and of one piece from beginning to end. That man is not old. That man is not worn out. That man is not vain. That man is not a perambulating lie. That man is sick in his head, crazy, deranged to the extreme point of insanity and thus extremely dangerous since he projects his hatred of that unbearable situation onto everyone around him, even, and particularly, those who love him.

This movie is about hard-working, traveling salesman Willy Loman (Dustin Hoffman), a man whose life has become a permanent nervous breakdown.  He's about to lose his job, he can't pay his bills, and his sons Biff (John Malkovich) and ""Happy"" (Stephen Lang) don't respect him and can't seem to live up to their potential.  His wife (Kate Reid) still loves him but she is caught up in a state of  ""bitter helplessness.""  Willy, now in his sixties, wonders what went wrong (after all, his dream of monetary success should have come true by now!!) and how he can make things up to his family.  He is now indeed a ""low man.""

A talented, sensitive director (Volker Schlondoroff) with a topflight main cast (stated above), under the supervision of the original author who penned the Pulitzer Prize-winning play in 1949 (Arthur Miller, Oct. 1915 to Feb. 2005) on which this movie is based, make this movie an unforgettable viewing experience.  The emphasis of this entire movie is on the excellent performances.

Hoffman (who won an Emmy and Golden Globe for this role) gives a standout performance in this movie as the bewildered Willy who now is suffering a crisis, a kind of ""success mania.""  Malkovich gives a superb performance as Biff, the son that Willy has decided to transfer his failed ambitions too.  Also look for Linda Kozlowski of ""Crocodile Dundee"" fame in a small but sharp role.

Finally, the DVD extra called ""Private Conversations"" is a ninety-minute documentary with the entire cast that especially features Hoffman, Malkovich, Miller, and Schlondoroff.

In conclusion, this is an unforgettable movie with outstanding performances that's based on an award-winning play.  Thus, you can't go wrong in watching this movie!!

What is fate?

In this case, Willy Loman is bound by his belief that personality alone, of being liked, is enough to make it to the American Dream. Unable to reconcile that those days never existed, and that hard work involved more than a firm handshake and a smile, he becomes despondent as he thinks of the lost potential. He is reminded in flashbacks and visions of relatives and friends who have succeeded.

His two sons are also confined to Willy's delusions of grandeur. Biff, played by Malkovich, had a future as a football star, but was handicapped by his dad's inhibitions and lack of reality. When he realizes his dad is a failure without integrity, after idolizing him, he concludes he too will be a failure.

Hap, on the other hand, Bif's brother, played by Stephen Lang, is a young Willy. He thinks his dad is right, and although he lives in futile mediocrity, believes dreaming is enough.

Kate Reid plays Willy's wife, Linda. She knows Willy is a failure, but tries to exist within the lie. She never declares the truth, but instead allows Willy to dream without substance.

Willy's hopes are shown worthless when he meets up with those, like Bernard, the nerdy math geek when Bif and Hap were children, and now practicing law in front of the Supreme Court. Willy asks what the secret is. His dream is nothing but the puff of a distortion of a Horatio Alger story, but he won't accept it. Bernard's father, Willy's neighbor, offers him a job, but Willy refuses.

The conflict is about encountering reality, and who will meet the truth. Can Biff live his simple dream of working outside with his hands, but by doing so must destroy the family structure. He knows it, and so he struggles.

Willy Loman's failure is like the hope of an old spiritual show follower, looking for salvation, but not willing to commit to what gets paired with it. It is a search for meaning. Despite a pessimistic premise, there is hope resident in this amazing film.

I fully recommend ""Death of a Salesman.""

1808334,5,B00007ELDP,"Before I watched the film version of Arthur Miller's classic play recently, I thought I was the only person on the planet who had not read or watched a version of his work. I had a good idea of the general outline of the whole thing before I went in, of course, thanks to years of pop culture references to Willy Loman, but I just never got around to sitting down for a look. Every once in awhile, I get frazzled that I haven't seen or read things that I feel every educated person ought to experience, hence it was way past time to see this one. So many different versions of the play exist, mostly made for television adaptations, that I worried a bit about which one was the best. I finally decided to view this 1985 Dustin Hoffman version simply because it was the only one I could find. Easy, huh? Yep, it was, but the subject matter of the play, and Hoffman's soul stirring performance as Willy Loman, did not make this an easy program to watch. ""Death of a Salesman"" is a depressing, sad play that makes you ponder ideas we Americans take for granted. Miller's work effectively tosses a bucket of ice water over the idea that the American Dream means everyone who works hard will ultimately succeed beyond his or her wildest expectations.

Willy Loman is a salesman who cannot escape the lure of past triumphs. He continually flashes back to earlier, halcyon days when his two sons, Biff (John Malkovich) and Hap (Stephen Lang), were in the prime of their life. These were good days, days full of big paychecks, hard work, a happy family, and sons whose athletic prowess promised great things. Biff especially looked as though he would have a wonderful future. His abilities as a football star virtually insured that he would end up at a great school, with even more promises to come. But a certain horrific event concerning Willy and his life on the road destroyed forever Biff's bright future, and life took a decidedly bleak turn in the intervening years. We gradually come to learn that Willy's existence has been one big failure. His age is a factor working against him at his firm, where the son of the original owner seeks to force Loman out. Debts of all sorts begin to press down on the family. And Biff and Hap, both over the age of thirty, largely failed in life. Hap is a schemer and womanizer who moves from one small job to another. Biff doesn't work at all, and even left for points unknown for a few years before turning up on the Loman doorstep. The only loyal trooper in the bunch is Willy's weathered wife Linda (Kate Reid), a woman that never fails to praise her husband's meager accomplishments.

What happens to those of us who fail at life? You certainly won't see these poor souls on television or in the movies, two mediums that tend to emphasize the glamorous, the successful, the wealthy, and the talented. The only place you will see the teeming millions not making the cut are on shows about crime and prison. Society doesn't wish to acknowledge people who slaved away for years without making appreciable gains. Perhaps that is why ""Death of a Salesman"" is such a tough program to watch; we see by increments a grown man crumble away to a pitiful fate despite his best efforts to succeed. And Willy Loman's descent into despair and ruin is about as painful as you could imagine. Hoffman plays the character as a withered, blundering, bland sort of fellow prone to frenetic outbursts of disassociated ramblings, which I think works in many ways. By appearing as an anonymous looking chap you wouldn't notice if you walked by him on the street, Hoffman manages to convey the sense of the ""every man"" that Miller's play strove to immortalize. Loman resembles most of us because he doesn't look glamorous, doesn't look successful, doesn't look wealthy, and doesn't look talented.

I should mention two other very important aspects of this production. First, the makers of this version of ""Death of a Salesman"" chose to shoot the program on a half film half stage set. Rooms in the Loman household don't have roofs or walls in certain places, and the neighboring buildings are obviously one dimensional structures. I'll bet this annoyed some viewers, but not me. I took the noticeably fake set pieces as a symbol of the failures in Willy's life, and as a symbol of the charade of the American Dream. Too, ""Death of a Salesman"" is a play and the producers probably wanted the production to have that feel. Second, the performances here are magnificent. John Malkovich proves once again that he's a performer capable of totally immersing himself in a role. I started to worry when I saw this actor running around in a football uniform tossing a ball around since I didn't think he looked like a teenager. The later scenes where he confronts his father blew my earlier conceptions out of the water. Malkovich delivers his lines with an emotional intensity that's tough to watch.

I wasn't as impressed with ""Private Conversations,"" a lengthy behind the scenes look at the production. This extra on the disc provides little of interest with its inclusion of assorted blooper footage, a couple of interviews, and other odds and ends. Just skip ""Private Conversations"" and watch ""Death of a Salesman"" instead. The emotional power of Miller's play is undeniable, and stands as a cautionary tale about dreams and those who fail to attain them.",1093132800,48,5367,4.688229056203605
