7894241,5,6305714940,"RESTORE TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL. I love every episode of Touched by An Angel!  They should have kept it on TV but like everything else that is saying positive things about God, it was removed. Sad but that is the way of the world.  I hope to get as many episodes as I can before they're no longer available.",1387152000,,303,4.11864406779661
7894242,5,6305714940,"this is about how the past impacts the present and carries us into the future.  The first episode deals with predudice that still happens now in society.  Predudice cannot be overcome just by laws but the change of a person's heart, Rosa Parks guest stars in this episode. The second episode deals with fear and how one can put to much faith in science but when a tragedy happens an astronaut experiences fear for the first time.  She learns that faith in God is all one needs, Sally Ride guest stars in this episode.",1330387200,,517,4.4787234042553195
7894243,5,6305714940,"At various times, we add the ""Touched By An Angel"" video series to our library.  Each one offers insight into the ethics and morality of the human race that are intertwined into God's love and purposes for His children.  Some of the pieces create joy and/or sorrow to a humble, growing heart -- hearts that at one time or another had walked away from God or stopped believing in God because of a grievious point in their life.  Throughout each video, each lesson (or series) creatively teaches us about the love God has for each one of us . . . and that Love will never cease.  Salute to Heroes incorporates two sections:  Racism/Rosa Parks and Death/Space Shuttle.  It is a well-thought out piece.",1156982400,,698,4.588709677419355
7894244,5,6305714940,I loved the series and I was grateful when I happened to find this video while shopping with my daughter (actually she spotted it first).  We used to watch the series together.  I've watched the video several times with her and I've  passed it along to friends.  The first episode deals with issues of racism with sensitivity and realism; the second with finding faith in one's own special way.  I really feel uplifted whenever I watch the episodes which are aired as reruns.  I am pleased that Amazon.com has other episodes available.  Thanks.,1080172800,,544,4.78494623655914
7894245,5,6305714940,"I recently bought this video because I found out that the late great John Ritter had starred in the first episode on this tape entitled ""Black Like Monica."" The story was a bit strange especially seeing Monica in Black make up and wig but it got its point across in showing the evils of racism. I thank the producers of this show for grappling this topic.",1071014400,,355,4.393939393939394
