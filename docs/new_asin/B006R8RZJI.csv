5014701,4,B006R8RZJI,The program itself is great but the special features are pretty stupid lots of em have the same highlight in different catergories. Im pretty sure they could have found enough good dunks to not have so many repeats. I would have given it 5 stars but too much of the same thing on the special features.,1334016000,5,301,4.392857142857143

5014730,5,B006R8RZJI,"Very up-to-date (made in 2011) yet has A LOT of the 1986 contest dunks of Spud Webb, and many others from previous years including Dr. J. from 1976 onward.

Lots of dunks, nearly all showed ""live"" and then again in replay, and lots of good (current) interviews of the players.

Well put-together production (the credits are massively long)--a VERY professionally done show-- with great music, too.  Mostly in film, not (preferred) video, but the film is sharp.
