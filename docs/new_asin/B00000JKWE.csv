1232907,4,B00000JKWE,"Jet LI plays young swordsman Ling in this epic tale. He loves wine and woman and through out the film he wants to find the strongest wine. Besides being a drunk in this movie he does pull off some super fast swordplay. This movie will have you rewinding fight scenes to see what exactly happened. Even in slow motion it's hard to follow.

1232914,5,B00000JKWE,"There are like 3 versions of this movie: 1- The Legend of the Swordman, 2- Swordman II, 3- Swordman II Special Edition (this one).

The first version has the best image and sound quality but the language is only in English and the violent scenes are edited, the second version has only the chinese languages and it's uncut but the dvd is not so easy to control, this version has only the chinese languages, it's uncut and easy to control but the image and sound were not SOOO remastered.
Maybe the perfect version will be released from Dragon Dynasty.

The movie is GREAT if you like japanese ninjas fighting chineses in a CrAzY way, but don't expect that Jet Li will be the one man army! This movie is more like fighting together as a team.

WARNING: In this movie, most of the BEST fighting scenes are at midnight! I hope that doesn't bother you.

1232915,4,B00000JKWE,"Fans of Hong Kong cinema will definitely want this famous martial arts epic in their personal library.  This was Jet Li's highest grossing HK film and it made Brigitte Lin a star.  The martial arts are entirely of the supernatural wuxia variety here so don't expect something realistic like Li's ""Fist of Legend"".  The visuals are eye-popping and you won't believe your eyes as you watch ninjas ride supersized airborne shurikans as though they were magic carpets, sexy Blue Phoenix shoot snakes out of her shirt sleeves, and Master Wu's ""Essence Absorbing Stance"".

In addition to the frenetic action, the plot and character development is interesting, although significantly hampered by the terrible subtitles.  Rather than using the subs in the theatrical and laserdisc versions, new, incomprehensible subtitles have been added.  A lot of the subtlety has been lost and I particularly was frustrated that villian ""Asia the Invincible"" was referred to simply as ""Dawn"" in the new subtitles.  The whole point of the movie is that Asia has become seduced by his/her newfound power to the point that she starts referring to herself as ""Invincible"".  ""Dawn"" just doesn't convey that sense of overconfidence.

Each character wrestles with their own conflicts.  Jet Li wants to retreat from the world of martial arts with his ""brothers"" and do nothing more than drink wine, yet he gets pulled into an epic conflict.  Kiddo can't decide whether she wants to be treated like a lady or one of the guys.  The tribal leader wants to tell Jet Li that she loves him but feels her first duty is to protect her troupe and find her father.  Blue Phoenix wants to be a loyal second-in-command but can't help but mouth off one too many times.  And Asia the Invincible makes an incredible personal sacrifice to bring power to the oppressed Sun Moon Sect, but is ultimately seduced by the incredible power without realizing it.

This is one of my favorite HK films, but the awful subtitles kept me from granting it the full five stars it deserves.  I have no idea why they got rid of the original theatrical subtitles, but that was clearly a mistake.  Still, if you're a fan of over-the-top action and films where characters are trapped between their desires and their duties, this is a must-have movie.",1170892800,3,2285,4.8782383419689115
1232916,2,B00000JKWE,"I had fond, but vague memories of this movie from years back... then watched it again in this dubbed version and was apalled.  Even beyond the dubbing, the movie itself is just so cheesily directed and cut that even the martial arts don't play well.  It just doesn't hold up to the best of the genre, especially now that it's been taken to such a higher level with recent films like House of the Flying Daggers.",1170288000,,411,4.394736842105263

Very much like the original Swordsman. La La la la la la, la la la la la. Listen to the singing of the Sun Sect. How two old men unite after many years and sing this song.  Jet Li and Kiddo sing as well.  How one takes possesion of a stringed instrument. Watch the movie. Makes you want to la la la.",1162339200,,475,4.0978260869565215

  Lots of Wuxia goodness here! Jet Li is very good (and young as this movie is old) and you quickly get to like his character. It's a great price here on Amazon and a great addition to your DVD collection!",1133308800,4,418,4.333333333333333
1232919,4,B00000JKWE,"This movie can be regarded as the father to crouching tiger, so if you liked that movie, it's very likely you'll enjoy this one also. Swordsman is not really a martial art movie but it's more a fantasy tale. The fighting scenes are are all ""fantastic"" in the sense they are not ""real"" but based mostly on magic so don't expect true kung fu action since you'll see men (and a horse) cut in two halves by a sword at 20 meters of distance! If you don't care about these magical skills (which are much more intrusive here than in Crouching tiger) then you'll surely like it: this movie has a much more emotional involvement than other similar films and it has also a good amount of humor (it was the first time I saw Jet Li playing a not really serious character who does also funny jokes at times: usually all his roles in Western movies are simply ""serious"" and dramatic while in HK movies a good amount of comedy is always present for all the characters involved!) and, at the end, we even regret the evil one was killed since the character Jet Li helps, shows to be even worse than the evil they defeated.
Overall a very interesting and not trivial movie, recommended mostly to fantasy lovers than to real kung fu aficionados.",1084147200,,1226,4.429203539823009
1232920,5,B00000JKWE,"""Swordsman II"" kicks off one year after the events in ""Swordsman"", although it is not necessary to watch the first movie in order to appreciate its sequel.  Both movies are adaptations of Louis Cha's novel, ""The Hero who Laughs at the World"" (""Xiao Ao Jiang Hu""), although extensive changes have been made to the original story.  Most of the main characters from the first movie return but are replaced with different actors.  In ""Swordsman"", the leader of the Huashan clan sacrificed many of his disciples in order to obtain a sacred martial arts manual called the ""Sacred Flower Scroll"".  Disillusioned by his betrayal and by the constant power struggles in the pugilistic world, his remaining disciples, including eldest disciple Ling Huchong (Jet Li) and daughter Yue Lingshan (Michelle Reis) decide to retreat to the Ox Mountain for a life of seclusion.  Unfortunately, the Scroll has fallen into the hands of a power-hungry warrior called Tongfang Bubai i.e. ""The Invincible Dawn"" (Brigitte Lin).  Dawn has captured the father of Ling's old flame, Ren Yingying (Rosamund Kwan), and usurped his position as leader of the Miao tribe.  He now plans to march north to the Chinese capital with a troop of 300,000 to overthrow the Ming Emperor.  Ling agrees to help Yingying rescue her father, and the last of the Huashan disciples are again drawn into a deadly power struggle.  ""Swordsman II"" is absolutely the best martial arts movie ever made.  Jet Li is at his charismatic best and is far better as ""the hero who laughs at the world"" than Sam Hui was in ""Swordsman"".  Ling is not a perfect person - in fact, he is a drunkard and a womaniser, not the best of role models - but he is also upright and loyal, and Jet Li plays him with such good humour and optimism that we easily forgive Ling's flaws.  The three lead actresses who play Ling's love interests also give wonderful performances - not to mention they are amongst the prettiest faces in the Hong Kong movie industry.  Michelle Reis (who takes over Cecilia Yip's role in ""Swordsman"") is excellent as the nave, jealous and tomboyish Lingshan, whom Ling treats as his ""little brother"".  Rosamund Kwan is also great as the world-weary Yingying, who would love nothing more than to leave for a life of seclusion with Ling but remains tied to her father and her people.  But the greatest accolades must go to Brigitte Lin for portraying a complex (and male!) character, the Invincible Dawn, a villain for whom audiences could feel empathy.  Dawn starts off as a man (Brigitte Lin's voice was replaced with a man's voice in the early parts of the movie) but becomes increasingly feminine as the movie progresses, for reasons revealed later in the movie.  He sacrifices everything for power, not for himself, but for the sake of the oppressed minorities he leads.  He is quite invincible, except for the fact that he lets his heart and emotional attachments get the better of him during a crucial battle (note: this movie is actually a disguised gay romance!! *grin*).  Brigitte is wonderfully icy cold in some scenes but also remarkably vulnerable as the lonely and misunderstood villain in others.  So successful was Brigitte (who was a popular actress in romance movies in the 1970s) at portraying Dawn that her acting career, in the doldrums since the 1980s, was spectacularly revived.  She later reprised her role as Dawn in the audaciously spectacular but silly sequel ""The East is Red"".  Two other supporting cast members deserve mentioning - Fannie Yuen as Blue Phoenix, Yingying's lieutenant and confidante, and Candice Yu as Dawn's lovely concubine.  Fannie was so good as the vivacious Blue Phoenix in ""Swordsman"" that she was the only character not replaced with another actor in ""Swordsman II"".  Candice, a great favourite amongst Asian TV audiences in the late 1970s and early 1980s, was drawn out of retirement for a cameo in this movie.  And finally, while the fight scenes in ""Swordsman II"" do not have the poetic beauty of those in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" nor the authenticity of those in ""Iron Monkey"", it uses wireworks to excellent effect.  After over a decade, ""Swordsman II"" is still the definitive martial arts movie yet to be topped by another.  Zhang Yimou's ""Hero"" comes close, but not nearly enough. Tsui Hark (the producer) and Ching Siu Tung (the director) are still my favourite Hong Kong movie makers.",1059091200,27,4397,4.890835579514825
1232921,5,B00000JKWE,"If there is a movie that is comparable to the 2002's Zhang Yimou epic - Hero, Swordsman 2 is a movie that matches it from on paper to the all-star cast. In fact made in 1991, Swordsman 2 also questions the idea of 'who is a real hero?'. With an all-star cast during the early nineties of Brigitte Lin, Jet Li (at the height of his fame), Michelle Reis, Rosamund Kwan and a bunch of well known HK stars with minor roles. It is also comparable to Hero in terms of box-office takings, in fact Swordsman 2 is Jet Li's highest grossing HK film and Hero is Jet Li's highest grossing film in China which broke numerous of records. The action director of Hero is Swordsman 2's Director - Ching Siu Tung who although is not as artistic as Zhang Yimou is right up there in terms of the visual and mind-blowing display. Despite being a sequel to Swordman played by Sam Hui, Swordsman 2 is better than its predecessor in nearly all departments. Although, Sam Hui plays the womanizer, drunk, best swordsman with great success, Jet Li is right up to par in terms of his acting and when combining with action, the role is really his. This is even more shocking as Jet himself say by playing Ling, it was a role that he could not relate to in real life which turned out to be one of Jet best performance in his entire movie's career. Brigitte Lin plays the role of Dawn even better as she played a man who turned into a woman. The chemistry between Lin and Li is also a highlight of the film and eventually creating a response from the viewers about whether their love is possible. Surprisingly, Li chemistry with both Michelle Reis and Rosamund Kwan seems natural and believable and the performance of Reis provides some much needed comic relief. Fennie Yuen is also another star that shown great presence in her minor role and performed especially well. If you come into Swordsman 2 expecting lots of fists to fists fight, then you will be disappointed as this is a wuxia film, with people flying around. The absorbing fist is a cool invention and well used in this film with the help of some mind-blowing special effects despite made 12 years ago. With all-star pretty girls, presence of Jet Li, direction of Hero's action director Ching Siu Tung, and produced by Tsui Hark, in a near perfect HK film which despite being a sequel could well stand well alone. Whenever watching Swordsman 2 it always reminds me of the great times that HK used to be and whenever hearing the theme song 'Laughing Swordsman' put a smile on my face. If there is a film comparable to Hero, then Swordsman 2 is right up there plus comedy.?? ???",1058227200,,2608,4.469601677148847
1232922,5,B00000JKWE,"I just saw this movie (the past Sunday) and at the end I was completely stunned! I didn't read the storyline before watching it, so I just knew it was about a... swordsman. And of course that it was a Jet Li movie.
The story seems to be not so origianl: the master betrayed by his brother, a cool guy hanging around with his pals and all the girls in the movie chasing him (well, not only girls...). In the end I found it very funny and that has some great action scenes (sometimes a bit confused). And YES, Jet Li is so cute...
I'm Italian and sometimes watching a movie in English is a pain in the neck, but thanx got there are subtitles! Anyway, a movie in its original language is always the best in my opinion... even in Chinese...",1044316800,2,736,4.190140845070423

The Arch villan never does anything but wave his/her arms invoking supernatural forces, making people explode etc. and fling some sewing needles...really! ... I usually do not review movies but this was sooo bad and almost everyone else cannot say enough good things about it,  I felt obliged to at least put some doubt in the minds of a prospective buyer.

For the decade or so it's been out, Swordsmans 2 has never been surpassed and it probably never will be. Jet Li gives an equally good performance here (if not better) as he did in Fist of Legend. Swordsmans 2 is a classic for any movie lover.",1039046400,2,368,4.426470588235294
1232925,4,B00000JKWE,"Most of the people in these reviews who are UNhappy with the DVD are so because they bought ""Legend of the Swordsman"", the one with the ""Jet Li Collection"" notation on the cover.  DO NOT BUY THAT VERSION.  These reviews are shared between ""Swordsman II"" and ""Legend of the Swordsman"", so some of the reviews that instruct you to buy the ""other one"", are erroneous, depending on which version you're already looking at.  Make sure you look at 2 things which will tell you if you are buying the right one:
1) the title - just to reiterate, get ""Swordsman II""
2) the DVD cover - It should by an orange/red, with Jet Li, Bridgitte Lin, Rosamund Kwan, and Michelle Reis on it, total of 4 people.  It also spells ""Swordsman"" with only the first ""s"".  You don't want the one that *only* has Jet Li on the cover.
Whew.  That all said, this movie is epic.  Even admittedly confusing at times.  Some say it's unecessary to have seen the first one, but right at the beginning, they hit you with a lot of information about what sect is doing what, and how the japanese are interfering, etc... and the english translation isn't superb, so unless you're willing to pause and read the subtitles over a couple times, you will miss information.  This is less so the case if you've seen ""Swordsman"".
Nonetheless, even if you don't understand everything, there is a plethora of things to enjoy in this movie.  I first watched this movie when I was about 14.  I only fully understood what was going on when I bought the DVD when I was 23.  I watched the movie periodically throughout my life, and enjoyed it every time.
It's a skillfully done movie, excepting the translation.  The subject of the transsexualism is treated VERY well.  It is neither overly graphic and sensationalist about it, nor is it too prudish.  The fighting is good, though if you're a martial arts fanatic, you might be dissapointed because the scenes are more about spectacle than display of kung fu skills.  Flying and diversity of weapons and fighting methods play more than single-human prowess.
And one other thing - the translation isn't a good one at all, but I really don't think it should take the rating down more than one star.  The movie is still great and exciting, and the poor translation doesn't prevent you from understanding the important drama when it happens.",1037923200,26,2332,4.621359223300971
1232926,5,B00000JKWE,This movie has one of the nicest fighting stunts out of so many chinese kung fu shows. I feel that this show is the best out of this series trilogy.

I own the VCD version of this movie and I first watched it on my computer's DVD player.  No subtitles, so I had no idea what was being said.  A year later I pop it into my regular DVD player and suddenly I see subtitles.  They made the difference with this movie.  I now understand why one of the characters was laughing all the time and it made the movie much more enjoyable.  That's why I always play chinese movies in original language and read subtitles.  I've found that English dubbing can really botch the original dialogue with adlibbing and incorrect translations (perfect example is Wing Chun).  This movie is one of my favorites.  5 stars, Brigitte Lin--need I say more?",1023321600,5,873,4.509554140127388
1232929,5,B00000JKWE,"The excellence of this film is difficult to convey.  It can be enjoyed on so many different levels.  First of all, the swordfight sequences are all dazzling and handled effortlessly by the venerable Tsui Hark and company.  They almost make it look easy.  From start to finish, there isn't one dull moment.  However, the reason I loved this film so much was for the emotional level.  Swordman II easily contains veteran Chinese actress Brigette Lin's finest and most stunning performance as ""Asia the Invincible"".  Her ambiguous and ultimately tragic relationship with the main character (Ling Hu Chong, played by Jet Li) is handled with pure craft and skill by the actress.  Brigette Lin perfectly conveys both the sexual ambiguity and undeniable feminine allure exuded by her character.  Her fascinating and complex relationship with Jet Li's character is both delicious and disturbing to watch.  Even after the breath-taking fight scenes, it is that relationship that will keep you thinking about the movie long afterwards.  That said, I must warn Western viewers that this is a fairly ""hardcore"" Chinese movie, filled with references to Chinese culture and mythology.  Think of it as the Chinese version of Lord of the Rings.  It's a self-contained universe that a Chinese viewer would easily accept and understand, but Western viewers might find it a little hard to swallow.  I recommend that Westerners just starting out to opt for some of the ""softer"" Chinese movies that are more suitable for Western consumption.  However, once you've got the ""hang"" of it, treat yourself to this masterpiece of Chinese Hong Kong cinema.",1010016000,17,1628,5.136882129277566

It had the standard martial arts but the story line and the chemistry between the stars was what elevated this movie above the rest.  Hong Kong fantasy/martial arts film tend to be incoherent to people because it tries to condense too massive of a story line into a 2 hour movie.  Generally, these tales are filmed in a serial format for prime time television broadcasting.  When watching this movie, don't try to understand all the detailed story line.  You won't.  The translation is atrocious.  Just go with the flow of the film.  Suspend your rational brain because a lot of the movie's actions are outrageous.

1232934,5,B00000JKWE,"I vividly remember watching this movie back in jr. high school.  I absolutely fell in love with it back then because of awesome, i mean awesome sword-fighting scenes.  If you thought the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was the best sword-fighting movie, then this one might change your mind.  I think Crouching Tiger is more geared toward 'proper, reasonable' sword-fighting, where swordman is much more geared toward fantasy-like/fast action, yet it was very believable, meaning the whole thing was done in such a perfection.
  If Crouching Tiger added the question/theme of finding one's self, discipline with the addition of romance and swordfighting, then Swordman's main theme, which becomes much more apparent toward the end, deals with the question of the essence of love.  Of course, a Chinese action movie isn't complete without the breathtaking action and the essence of romance.  But this movie does an excellent, excellent job on both department, especially in romance.  It's not an ordinary love story and I don't want to give out the story here.  But toward the end, Jet Li asks Brigitte Lin this one question: ""Are you the one who stayed with me that night""  It was very important for him to know the answer and he does that by saving Brigitte, holding onto this rope.  However, Brigitte doesn't answer that question. and falls down again.  And Jet Li, this time, throws that rope away to tell Brigitte something and Brigitte uses the last ounce of stregth to save him, still without answering his question.  Why didn't she answer him, and why he didn't care about his life to tell her someting?  why?  Man, I'm telling you, Brigitte's last facial acting was just incredible, just incredible... This movie will be a much more meaningful experience if you ask yourself why Brigitte didn't answer his question, and why he threw away the rope of life he was holding onto to tell her something.  This movie will throw this one question at you, ""what is the essence of love""  Pay close attention to their facial acting/change from the beginning of the last battle to Brigitte's unforgettable finale.
  Like all the great Chinese movies do, this one will leave you with this sense of 'unexplicable feeling', feelings you get from dejavu, or good memory.  By the way, the title should've been ""Dong Bang Bul Pae"", literal meaning is undefeated in Eastside/Asia.  And to add one more, Brigitte Lin was much more popular than Jet Li back then, and she still is! (and I watched with korean subtitle, done a good job there.  But they need to work on english subtitle, since they don't explain certain part in detail or certain things sound cheap and funny)",989539200,9,2659,4.888392857142857

Fine, it was cute to see Jet Li boozing it up every other minute...I totally returned this DVD..the picture is not enhanced at all.  While I thought the plot of Lin being a man turned woman was cute (We know how the HK films love to play with gender), the story was completely fantastical...the sword fighting wasn't that clear, absolutely no martial arts.  And mostly unlikeable characters.  I'm sure the only reason it made so much money in HK is that Bridget Lin was in it...her movies always make tons of money.",989366400,2,617,4.482142857142857

I have a video tape copy of the Swordsman II, it's a great movie so I was really excited about upgrading to DVD, but the subtitling makes this movie unwatchable.  I've seen it, I know what this movie's about!  Unless you speak Chinese you won't have any idea what's going on in the version by Mei Ah Laser Disc company.  Get the Tai Seng VHS version.  I could have done a better job and I speak neither Cantonese or Mandarin.  Whoever did this knows equally as much English.  But it starts right there on the cover, what's a Swordman?

1232939,5,B00000JKWE,"First of all, the movie.  I started watching HK movies just a little under a year ago, and mostly because I was very impressed with Jet Li's performance in ""Lethal Weapon 4"" and ""Black Mask,"" and thus wanted to see some of his earlier work.  A year later, I have now watched over 80 HK movies since (all movies by Chow Yun Fat, Jackie Chan, Michelle Yeoh, as well as by those lesser-known (at least in the US) Brigitte Lin, Ekin Cheng, Aaron Kwok, etc.), and it was all because of this movie.  Looking back, this movie was a terrific introduction to the HK swordfighting, fantasy genre.  The fight scenes are spectacular and the cast is first rate (Brigitte Lin steals the show, though).
The DVD?  Yes, the subtitles are bad, but not distracting, and after a couple of viewings I followed the story easily (I absolutely HATE those VHS subtitles which are nearly impossible to read, especially against a white background).  Plus, Director Tsui Hark's wonderful use of colors (contrasting blues, reds, yellows) can only be done justice by the DVD format.  The sound is in Dolby 5.1, which helps, and the transfer is pretty good.  The menus are also presented nicely, better than any other HK DVD made around the same time.  Although this was the first HK DVD I purchased, it is still my favorite.  Highly recommended.",980121600,5,1315,4.678260869565217

The Daijo-sai or the Great Thanksgiving Festival is the third and most important--and also the most controversial--of the inauguration rituals, because it is the one in which the emperor is united to his Imperial Ancestress in such a way as to share in a unique way in her divinity. The ceremony is not mentioned in the Constitution imposed by the American occupation forces, and so its present constitutionality was questioned at the time of the accession of the present emperor Akihito.

Akihito in Final Ritual of Passage : Japan: The emperor communes with his mythical ancestor, the Sun Goddess, in a nighttime, controversial rite of enthronement
November 23, 1990
TOKYO -- Wearing the white silk robes of a high Shinto priest, Japan's Emperor Akihito communed Thursday night with his mythical ancestor, the Sun Goddess, in a torchlight enthronement ritual that was clouded by controversy over the constitutional separation of religion and state.
The government-funded religious ceremony climaxed Akihito's elaborate rite of passage into emperorhood, which began nearly two years ago with the death of his father, Hirohito.
To some conservative Japanese, the secretive goings-on inside the darkened enthronement huts symbolized Emperor Akihito's final transformation into a divine being. Various interpretations of the rite, some with scholarly grounding, hold that Akihito receives the soul of the Sun Goddess or joins with her in symbolic sexual union--a theory derived from the presence of vestigial straw beds in the huts.",1407110400,,1771,5.5036764705882355

Also true, the wirework and acrobatics can be a little absurd at times.  But isn't this what you watch these movies for?  The story is decent and Jet Li and Brigitte Lin do a great job with their roles.  Be aware, though, the DVD menus are strange and confusing.

If you're a fan of martial arts/action movies, especially Jet Li's other older titles, check out Swordsman II.",1390953600,2,529,4.695652173913044
