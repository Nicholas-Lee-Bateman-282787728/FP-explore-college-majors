1082343,3,6305836957,"Bad rip off of the original Freaks movie.  If you like bad, B rate movies, this ain't to bad.  Otherwise.. you probably won't enjoy it at all.",1350000000,,142,4.222222222222222
1082344,3,6305836957,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  I just want to give some thoughts on this movie...

If you like watching B horror movies that were suited for the drive-in movie crowd of the '60s, then definitely check out She Freak (1967).  This carnival-based horror movie is pretty much a remake of Freaks (1932).  It has basically the same plot.  However, She Freak is clearly inferior to Freaks.  For one thing, the acting is sub par, the fight scenes are laughably fake, very few actual ""freaks"" appear in the movie, and most of the music throughout the movie sounds like cocktail music.  However, it is worth checking out not so much for the story, but for the carnival setting.  The opening credit sequence lasts about five minutes and features a lot of good footage of every aspect of a then-modern day carnival.  The camera angles are pretty cool during this sequence.  The aerial shots are cool.  From there, the movie gets into the story, which as I said, is a basically Freaks done all over again, but with less emphasis on the actual freaks themselves.  Instead, there's a gold-digging former diner waitress who joins a traveling carnival and seduces the owner and another man who is a worker.  You'll also see a sword swallower, a snake lady, and the typical attractions one would see at a carnival from 45 years ago.

This movie holds my attention throughout, even though the music and the acting bring it down a couple notches.  If you're a fan of carnival and circus based movies from the 1960s and 1970s like I am, this is one that is worth checking out.  There are better carnival and circus based movies from the era of the 1960s and 1970s, but this one does have that nostalgic carnival/circus atmosphere.  I actually prefer Carnival of Blood (1970) to this movie, even though Carnival of Blood is an amateur B movie if there ever was one, with bad acting, bad direction, bad lighting, etc.  The strengths of Carnival of Blood are the night footage of Coney Island Amusement Park, the folk music, and the grainy appearance of the film.  These things add to the feeling of nostalgia.

She Freak?  Worth a look.  Not bad.",1335484800,7,2150,4.647214854111406
1082345,4,6305836957,"From the very opening scene this movie had me hooked.  The setting was wierd, and the wierdness built up throughout the movie.  We see many shots of an amusement park circa 1967, some shot from overhead from a low flying plane.

A pretty girl working as a waitress in a tiny diner in the middle of nowhere dreams of better things and finds herself a job working as a waitress at a traveling amusement park's refreshment stand.

A specialty of this amusement park is it's assortment of ""freaks"".  The tawdry plot is a classic.  Everything about this amusement park is smarmy.
The setting seems to be a genuine amusement park.  The storyline is
simple, steamy and trashy, in a good way.

I was thouroughly entertained and considered giving this five stars simply for the amount of enjoyment I got out of it.  I couldn't do it however as the acting and general filming was borderline amature in most places, and yet,
there was that overall wierdness and seediness that I haven't seen captured so well in most movies of this grade B ilk.

There were numerous shots of the rides both at night and in the daytime, cotton candy, stuffed animals to be won, the barkers drawing people into the attractions, the colored lights on the ferris wheel and other rides, and it felt as if I were really there, in another place and time,
wandering through the park, and the feeling I got was almost visceral.
This movie created the mood and scenes very realistically and yet it wasn't in a Hollywood way, more like a very well shot amature film.  There was a quality here that transported me, and I am having a hard time describing it, being as unique as it was.  It created the mood of an amusement park from another time as well as any movie I have seen.

This DVD was a copy of the original tape.  It included a section of additional scenes of an amusement park apparently from the 1940's or 1950's with many wonderful shots of side show barkers hawking the freakshows.
I'm glad someone thought to capture this fascinating bit of amusement park
history on film since this is a relic of a bygone era.  We see at the end a few siamese twins, who are shown in two cases with fiances who want to marry them, or at least one of them.

If you enjoyed the movie Freaks you will enjoy this as there are some similarities.  I can highly recommend this to anyone who loves well done grade B cult movies that include amusement parks.

Thank you joker for including this on your list of circus and amusement park movies.",1335312000,,2493,4.477876106194691
1082346,4,6305836957,"I didn't expect much from this movie, but it turned out to be one of my new favorite trashy flicks, a small town diner waitress with big dreams and high hopes joins the carnival when it comes to town and tangles herself up in a web of greed and ambition she can't escape from. This film is remarkably captivating for a no budget flick from 1967, the dialog and acting are atrocious, but it's paced well and not unlike the freaks themselves, you just can't look away. For fans of ""Bad"" and ""So Bad It's Good"" cinema this is a real gem, for fans of whatever the latest big budget hollywood drivel churned out is this week is, this is not for you.",1304380800,5,644,4.2439024390243905
1082347,3,6305836957,"Not in the same category as the classic 'Freaks'but I enjoyed 'She Freak',just in a different way. The carnival atmosphere of 1967 goes a long way since there really aren't freaks or monsters till the last 30 seconds of the movie,then you get one freak in total. Atmosphere is key here. Don't be alarmed by the cheap looking cover art,[cheezy flicks]the picture quality is actually good for being the low-budget schlockfest that it is. Look out for the fantastic ending that is in those something weird video openings(the reason I had to own this in the first place).Keep your expectations low(I mean LOW!!!!!)and you will love this crap just as much as I did. Great piece for the cheezy movie library. Really I mean it,I'm being honestly sincere. Now pass the cheeze Louweez right into your shopping cart. Then when you get home have a candle light dinner with the 'She Freak'",1239235200,10,877,4.776315789473684
1082348,4,6305836957,"She-Freak is a 60's B-movie horror flick with incredible real-life sideshow performers. It is essentially a take-off of the original 30's classic ""FREAKS"" by Todd Browning.  A scandalous tale of a scheming seductress who scams her way into the heart of the man who runs the midway. When she gets more than she bargained for the real-life freak show performers settle the score!  A low-budget indie cult classic from an infamous Drive-In B-movie producer. The original VHS video release by Magnum Entertainment seen here on this [...] product page is actually superior in quality and coolness to the cheap-o dvd release of the same film by Something Weird video. The opening credit sequence uses real shots of midways and sideshow banners. Worth viewing just for this rare footage.",1209859200,,780,5.0859375
1082349,3,6305836957,"This reinterpretation of Tod Browning's wonderfully transgressive ""Freaks"" is not one of David F. Friedman's better films, although it is his personal favorite for reasons obvious to anyone familiar with his career. Something Weird mutants expecting gore-n-gals are barking up the wrong tree here, as ""She-Freak"" is strictly a general release picture, and quite tame even by those standards (Dave explains why in his commentary). The closest thing to skin is a fully clothed striptease by Lynn Courtney, and the only gore is a screwdriver through the hand bit on the illustrious Bill Bagdhad (Astro-Zombies).

You've seen ""Freaks"", right? Then you know the story...just substitute a waitress for the acrobat and a sideshow owner for Hans. Unlike ""Freaks"", ""She Freak"" is vibrant and colorful, and the shots taken from the California State Fair are some of the most impressive carnival footage yours truly has ever seen. In fact, they've been sold as stock to many other producers over the years. With the exception of a lone midget, there are no real human oddities in the film. Friedman was constrained by a California state prohibition on the exhibition of 'freaks' for profit, so rather than pack up and film somewhere else, he decided to have Harry Thomas create some monsters for him. Even those faux deformities only appear at the very end.

As I said, not one of Dave's better films, and sadly, not one of his better commentaries either. Mister Friedman has set the standard for the audio commentary medium, always entertaining and full of stories, but here he seems less lucid, and makes a surprising number of factual errors. Even so, the history of the American carnival business and the primer on carney  talk make this worth a listen, even if you've heard the same bits about Lee Raymond and Byron Mabe before.

SWV transfered ""She Freak"" from the original negative, and does it ever look amazing compared to the older VHS versions with faded colors and an improper aspect ratio. Proof positive of the wonders of DVD...long unavailable, word-of-mouth exploitation films are only a mouse click away, and presented in such amazing condition that those of us raised on murky looking video cassettes are just awed. The only bonus features beside the commentary are a trailer and an eight minute reel of carnival footage from the 1930s with the Hilton sisters (Freaks, Chained for Life), pinheads, talkers, sword swallowers, the whole bit. Not a bad purchase, but not the first purchase if you haven't seen the original Freaks, or the Blood Trilogy, yet.",1182297600,7,2561,5.0188235294117645
1082350,3,6305836957,"After watching Frankenstein's Castle of Freaks (1974) the night before, I actually enjoyed myself somewhat last night with this film, titled She Freak (1967)...I'm not saying She Freak was a great movie (it wasn't), but it was a short sight better than that other flick, which really wouldn't have been a difficult task to accomplish, so in essence, I'm really not saying a lot (what else is new?).  Written and produced by David F. Friedman (The Defilers, The Notorious Daughter of Fanny Hill, The Acid Eaters), a name instantaneously familiar to fans of sleaze cinema, and directed by actor/director/producer Byron Mabe (A Smell of Honey, a Swallow of Brine, The Head Lady, Space-Thing), the film features Claire Brennen (The Touchables, The Domino Principle) as Jade Cochran, a country girl of humble origin who, desperate to better her lot in life, flew too close to the sun on gossamer wings made of feathered dreams and wax ambitions...also appearing is Lee Raymond, who would later direct a couple of pictures for Friedman including Love Thy Neighbor and His Wife (1970) and The Adult Version of Jekyll & Hide (1972), Lynn Courtney, and Bill `Squeal like a pig for me' McKinney, making his silver screen debut here.  Most probably remember Mr. McKinney as the wild eyed, funky toothed mountain man who loved Ned Beatty just a little too much in the film Deliverance (1972).

The film starts off with shots of a carnival, accompanied by some fairly groovy, non-descript instrumental music.  Ahhhh, nothing like watching carny folk ply their respective trades, all of them seeming to involve the ripping off the rubes...this goes on for a good five and a half minutes before we cut to a rural, greasy spoon, i.e. a diner, and we meet Jade Cochran, who works as a waitress, and her slightly sleazy boss, who'd I swear is played by actor Claude Earl Jones, but he's not listed in the credits.  Anyway, Jade's obviously displeased with her lot in life, believing anything would be better than `wasting time in a filth pit', including signing on in some fashion with the recently arrived traveling carnival.  This decision elicits a story about a pig (I wasn't sure if he was talking about an ex-employee or a real life farm animal), along with the following temperamental tirade from her employer...

`You gonna run off and join that lousy carnival, hunh?  Too good to work for me, hunh?  What the hell you gonna do in the carnival, Jade?  You gonna dance the hootchie cooch?  Show the farm boys what you got?  You know where your going girl? Your going down, all the way down!'

Jade splits and joins up with the carnival, as...a waitress, serving and cleaning up after the carnies (she even gets to wear the same uniform she did while working at the diner).  She makes friends with a stripper named Pat `Moon' Mullins (Courtney), cozies up to Ferris wheel man Blackie Fleming (Raymond), eventually setting her gold digging sights on the well to do freak show operator Steve St, John (McKinney), despite her disdain for freaks in general.  The two marry, while Jade maintains a relationship with Blackie which eventually spawns a violent confrontation that ends in Jade, who's turned into a real a-hole, inheriting the freak show.  Jade's recent good fortune is short lived as the freaks seek gruesome justice for their former boss, benefactor, and friend.

I was somewhat disappointed in this film mainly because it featured so little sleaze (no nekkidness), something producer Friedman known for in his other films.  There also seemed a real absence of actual freaks throughout the film...there was a sword swallower, a snake handler, and even a sneaky midget (or little person, if you prefer), but this hardly met my expectations given a good hunk of the film dealt with the freak show aspect.  The advertising on the DVD case relates this was sort of a homage to Tod Browning's controversial 1932 film Freaks, but I'd hardly call this a homage...a more apt description would be rip off, as the plot structure is almost identical, lacking any of the worthwhile character structure, poignant touches, or memorable visual imagery featured in that earlier film.  The story here is so minimal, bolstered up by endless filler sequences of carnival in operation, packing up to move, or setting up once it reached a new location.  These were sometimes interesting to look at, but after a while they only served to illuminate how little actual story there was...at the very least, during these extended filler sequences, one can switch to Friedman's commentary track, which is fairly interesting and fun.  The acting was so-so, the worst being, in my opinion, Claire Brennen with her phony, southern drawl.  She was somewhat attractive (nice rack), but her face had a sort of mannish quality that made me wonder at times if she was a transvestite.  Throughout the movie there were a number of characters that used the term `with it' in some context or other...apparently carnie folk are a lot more hip than I would have thought.  I wasn't quite sure what they actually meant when they used this term, but it did remind me of a line from The Simpson's animated show where Grandpa Simpson describes to Homer how he lost his `hipness'... `I used to be with it, but then they changed what it was. Now what I'm with isn't it, and what's it seems weird and scary to me, and it'll happen to you, too.'

The picture quality, presented in fullscreen, on this Something Weird Video DVD looks very clean and sharp, and the Dolby Digital mono audio comes through very well.  As far as extras go, there's a theatrical trailer, an entertaining commentary track featuring writer and producer David F. Friedman, a film short featuring some freaks (8:29), mainly a couple female Siamese twins, and a lengthy gallery of David F. Friedman exploitation art, materials used to promote his various cinematic ventures.  All in all this is a great presentation of a flimsy exploitation film, with lots of excellent, colorful, kitschy shots of a carnival circa the late 1960s, if that sort of thing interests you.  There are a few different DVD releases of this film floating around, so if your interested in purchasing this film, it would be wise to make sure you're getting the version you want.

By the way, I saw Friedman is currently producing a remake of this film, one supposedly slated for a 2005 release, but the production appears to have stalled...",1134000000,6,6446,4.8700823421774935
1082351,2,6305836957,"Exploitation meister David Friedman was an expert at churning out low-budget skin-flicks and drive-in masterpieces. ""She Freak"" has been restored in clear detail and colors and you can see for yourself that Friedman blatantly ripped off Tod Browning's 1931 masterpiece, ""Freaks."" The movie starts out with promise, giving us glimpses of a real-life carnival, circa l967. But after awhile, it becomes boring. There's no skin shown, no soft-core sex, no violence and no suspense. There's even a scene taken literally from the ending of ""Freaks"" in which the devious heroine is transformed into a monster--bad make-up and all.",1106006400,14,623,5.36734693877551
1082352,3,6305836957,"David F. Friedman, former collaborateur of H.G. Lewis, produced this low budget horror film as an hommage to the travelling carnivals of the US. He  took the storyline of ""Freaks"", the Tod Browning classic, and  transformed it into a rather tame film with lots of carnival atmosphere, a  little bit of horror and  a little bit of skin.
