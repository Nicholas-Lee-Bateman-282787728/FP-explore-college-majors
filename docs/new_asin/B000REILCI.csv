8200031,5,B000REILCI,"In 1943 Denmark, under Nazi occupation, director Carl Dreyer fashioned a strange, haunting epic still heralded today: ""Day of Wrath"". The director reportedly had to flee the country when he angered the government with the film's political content. In 1623 Denmark, a haggard old woman seeks refuge from villagers who attack her for practising sorcery. She is turned over to priests, who strip her naked to the waist and torture her with ropes; seeking a confession. Off camera, we hear her scream. She is burned at the stake. Beautiful young Anne(Lisbeth Movin), the second wife of a Danish pastor, loathes her husband. She falls in love with the minister's son. The locals hear her wishing for her husband's death. When he dies of a stroke, she is accused of withcraft, punishable by death. Anne is traumatized and tortured to the point that she believes she may be a witch....""Day of Wrath"" opens quietly on a country farm-house. The camera pans slowly, rigidly, across the deep-focus set. A door opens, and an old lady walks out into bright sunlight, in the same shot, showing that the set is not a studio at all. Dreyer's slow, long, pregnant panning shots anchor the entire film. Carl Theodor Dreyer was born in 1889 Denmark. He was the illegitimate son of a farmer and grew up in foster homes. He was adopted by a strict Lutheran family. By the late 1920's, Dreyer was hailed as Denmark's greatest director. A fanatical perfectionist, his career was dogged by problems with the financing of his movies. Dreyer directed the famous ""Leaves of the Book of Satan"" in 1921. It contains slow, episodic tabloids of Jesus and Satan. At the height of his powers, in 1928, Dreyer directed ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"". A beautiful young girl is tormented by zealous priests, and forced to admit to witchcraft. A heart-rending performance and a directorial masterpiece produced a film classic never seen again. The 1930's brought the horror-film cycle, and Dreyer directed ""Vampyr(1932)"", a mild take-off of ""Camille"", with lesbian vampires. ""Day of Wrath"" is a sparkling Criterion DVD transfer(97 minutes). It includes a menu, a photo gallery, and two extended interviews with Lisbeth Movin and Preben Lerdorff-Rye, the stars of the film. According to the interviews, Dreyer was intensely introverted; captivated by his own life. His own ideas. And his own films. His wife was the script girl. Supposedly, when he retired, Dreyer lived in a house next to another famous director; the German Fritz Lang. They passed each other often, but never spoke a word.",1285372800,4,2552,4.964953271028038
