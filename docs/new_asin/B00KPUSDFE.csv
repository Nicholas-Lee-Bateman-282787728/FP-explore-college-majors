No one film (as I have viewed to this date) contains ALL the truths about this subject, whether ""anecdotal"" or ""scientifically verified"" .

Just because everybody else does it, doesn't mean that you have to especially when you have no idea what they contain or the contraindications are.

This is by far THE best thing that we did NOT do for our kids...and they are well adjusted and not sick, unlike our friends who follow the set pattern of injections and are now dealing with allergies, disease, sickness, hearing loss, dental problems, asthma, so many thing in these young people that should not be there...",1364774400,8,881,4.472049689440993

I also learned - from the same professors - that some of the ingredients that are put in the vaccines are... toxic! Please remember that doctors used to advertise the health benefits of cigarette smoking. Therefore, while I will always play by the rules and tell the parents of my patients what I have to, my private opinion is: We cannot claim that anything is 100% safe, especially with the very little long-term research currently available to us. Please do not discredit people who lost their children - just shut up and listen to them first, then investigate, allow independent research, and show us the data.",1501977600,18,743,4.723076923076923
6438005,1,B00KPUSDFE,"I watched this on Prime Video. The description claims it's a balanced examination of issues surrounding vaccines. This is anything but balanced. There are several heartbreaking accounts of people who have been vaccinated and have been diagnosed with an autoimmune disease or CNS affliction. As a scientist with no horse in this race, I can say, without a doubt, that no evidence is presented in this documentary, that shows a causal link between any of the vaccines discussed and any subsequent health issues. What is absent is any actual information (data) discussing the actual likelihood that receiving say the HPV vaccine (Gardasil) and then diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. The data indicates that for every 100,000 people who get the HPV vaccine,1 is diagnosed with an autoimmune disease or related condition. From my vantage point these data don't indicate a strong causal link between the vaccine and autoimmune diseases.",1501632000,5,934,5.275167785234899

6438007,1,B00KPUSDFE,"To paraphrase the featured spokesperson of this documentary, Barbara Loe Fisher, until we find scientists who are not influenced by science, we will never know the truth about vaccines. A handful of tragic stories are offered as a challenge to historic fact, on the basis of supposed weaknesses in the scientific evidence. On the other hand, there are no unchallenged scientific proofs that the cases featured had anything to do with vaccines other than coincident occurrence. One might make an equal case for having a chocolate milkshake or eating strawberry jam the day before the problems started. We have no assurance that these people are even telling us the truth, let alone offering valid scientific challenges.

Are drug companies guilty of overselling their products, of using deceptive practices, of exaggerating real problems? Of course they are. It's the American way. Are advertising companies responsible for the gullibility of the American public? It's never been the subject of a scientific study, with a control group who've never seen advertising, so the jury is still out.",1500681600,2,1091,5.2701149425287355

6438012,4,B00KPUSDFE,"People saying this movie is unbalanced probably didn't watch it or the ideas about problems with vaccines were so new they loomed larger in their minds.  This movie had a doctor saying the science is settled and vaccines don't cause autism to contrast the story of a bouy with autism whose parents believe vaccines caused it.  It had a doctor saying vaccines are safe and have saved us from disease and talking about children he saw die from measles when a vaccine could have prevented it.  It had a doctor supporting mandating vaccines.

Vaccines do cause injury in some people. Calling for more research and improved oversight, improved vaccines, information about who is most as risk for the injuries and reactions is not ""anti-vaccine.""

The flaw this movie had to me was a lack of clarity.  Because it included both sides of the issue, there was n o clear conclusion...but that is reality.  Not enough research has been done to have a clear picture on which vaccines are safe, and which kids are most at risk.  There are so many areas of research and knowledge the movie didn't even touch, like ""herd immunity,"" which is most likely not something vaccines can ever create due to the high number of people who do not get immunity from vaccines.

The most interesting part of the movie was the personal stories of the people in it.  I wish they had presented more background for some of the stories.  I watched a documentary done in Sweden (?) I think about Gardisil and how active, sporty girls were having complications at high rates--dozens of girls like the one in this movie.  I saw a documentary that looked at ""sudden onset autism,"" which is a narrow subset of autism and how it could possibly related to vaccines, whereas traditional autism is not.

6438027,1,B00KPUSDFE,"I am a fairly open-mined person, so let me just say I will concede the movie had a valid point that there needs to be more oversight and research into vaccines, and not done primarily by pharmaceutical companies. However, it does not logically follow that therefore vaccines are harmful, and furthermore this film does nothing to convince you that they are indeed harmful. There is instead an alarming and complete lack of data presented in this film.
It follows instead a sample size of three families whose children become ill. Do we know it was from vaccines? No. And, even if there is small percentage of children with adverse affects it does not follow we should allow a large number of children to be injured or die because of a lack of vaccinations.
It tells us there is mercury in vaccines. There is also mercury in fish...which is why I avoid high-mercury fish. Any data on how harmful these levels are in vaccines? No.
And if your going for pathos as your main argument, please show more pictures of children with childhood diseases who were not vaccinated. Please show the third world countries where they do not vaccinate, and children die.
Conclusion: Until we have ANY evidence to the contrary, we must vaccinate children FOR the greater good.",1483574400,4,1257,4.770642201834862

I felt that there was a very good balance of anecdotal and scientific evidence presented - overall giving an extremely well-rounded view of the vaccine issue. Neither ""pro-vaccine"" or ""anti-vaccine"" it is very much a strong word for the INFORMED, CHOICE on vaccines.

Information should MOST definitely be given out by doctors, if nothing else. I was very outraged at the fact that the one mother, a psychiatrist from Texas who lost her daughter Victoria due to vaccine injury, said that even though all four of her children had been vaccinated according to the routine schedule - her doctor had NEVER ONCE given her the REQUIRED ""vaccine risk"" information sheets at ANY of her FOUR children's appointments.

Really? I'd find a new source of medical care for my child if that were the way their pediatrician practiced. Listen to mom yes, but accepting her ""feelings"" as medical fact is irresponsible.

This film is very clearly biased toward the anti-vaccination side of this issue. You can even tell where the interviews were cut to bias the statements of the interviewees that are pro-science (pro-vaccination).

This type of rhetoric and reporting isn't just dishonest, it is epistemically irresponsible. You're raising doubts in the face of overwhelming evidence that supports the safety and efficacy of vaccines. You posit the notion that we need to rethink how we prevent epidemics by suggesting we increase those (already containable) risks until an unrealizable degree of certainty is reached.

And they failed to mention that... Or explain the scientific details they are demanding of vaccine supporters. And they talk about a fund to pay for law suits but no fund to pay for more research...? They show glimpses of both sides but no organized view to compile the two: just a video of a girl missing a school dance.... Right, but what about the science? And then not questioning any of the pharmaceuticals she is on? Idk. I was hoping for more actual facts and both sides recognizing their own limitations, but that's not what was presented here.

However, I'm not sure if it will change anyone's mind if they already have chosen a side, at least not for me. I'm not saying vaccines do not help the greater good, I am not a Doctor but I do believe it is a big money maker for the pharmaceutical industry and my biggest concern is if you look at data of when each vaccine is introduced, the disease for which it is trying to eradicate was already on the decline and it seems to look like the vaccine is the reason why when it was already going down. My 2 cents, if you want to vaccinate I suggest doing it on your schedule not the Doctor's so maybe not so many at once and not so young and maybe not all of them.

6438113,2,B00KPUSDFE,"Ugh... As a vaccine centrist, I was actually really looking forward to seeing this film as a balanced approach to the vaccination debate, in hopes of sharing with pro-vax friends. And, I still appreciate the sentiment behind the film. If someone were brand new to the vaccination debate, they might walk way feeling like they've learned something. And, if they never bothered to research the claims and sources found within the film, they'd never know that a great deal of the content in this film had been debunked for years before the cameras ever started rolling.

Unfortunately, while the film ""looks"" professional and reputable, the filmmakers made a number of poor choices in research and casting. Within the first couple of minutes of the film, their choice to feature Dr. Plavensky stating that babies aren't in danger of Hep B, I got nervous. For the most part the film continued to go downhill, filled primarily with anecdotal hearsay and questionable experts (not to mention, some startlingly disingenuous interpretations of history and science). What the film lacked in credible data, it makes up for in manipulative emotional blackmail. I was hopeful, but walked away disappointed by the filmmakers blatantly myopic approach.

Later on in the film, Plavensky goes on to irresponsibly scare a group of parents about mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, going on to say ""No one in science can explain how the body processes these compound because nobody has ever looked."" Of course, this is all blatantly false, hinting at rumors and false science that all been thoroughly debunked countless times by countless studies (go a quick web or PubMed search).

Ugh... I was so hopeful to meet some new faces, peer reviewed science, and reasonable logic to share with my strictly pro-vax friends. Instead, I found a film filled with previously debunked rhetoric juxtaposed by emotionally driven anecdotal horror stories that, if we are honest, lack any ""smoking gun"" substantiation in medical fact (just wild assumptions).

All in all, my greatest frustration was that anytime they'd bother showing a ""pro-vax"" expert to give the impression of unbiased approach, they would immediately follow-up with bizarrely biased experts feeding soundbytes that are simply unverifiable (opinions of parents), or conjecture (not based on actual science).

Is it hard to watch a mother cry, grieving over a baby who apparently died of anaphyactic shock? Of course! as an autopsy performed with an expert witness testifying that a vaccine was the cause? No, unfortunately - just a crying mother giving her opinion that it was a vaccine that killed her child (not a food allergy, environmental condition, genetic mutation, etc...) This is a cheap and irresponsible trick to manipulate viewers into making irrational decisions based on empathetic reactions to somebody else's anecdotal pain.

How much time did the film dedicate to the effectiveness and safety of vaccines? About 30 seconds... :-(

But, of course, the film receives high praise. Why? Because birds of a (biased) feather flock together.",1450310400,19,3085,5.245436105476673

6438116,2,B00KPUSDFE,I noticed the one sided nature of this film almost immediately. It has a lot of anecdotal evidence. There were a couple of doctors completely pro vaccine and the always showed clips disregarding what they said right after they said it. Also they showed kids or parents affected by vaccines but none that were affected by not getting vaccines. Right in the beginning one of doctors noted that he saw preventable deaths from measles but none of those parents were shown and no parents with immune compromised children were shown. I agree that vaccines should be tested further by people not being paid by drug companies but this film was completely one sided. In order to balance out anecdotal evidence on one side there should have been some available on the other side. Also they ignored all facts that contradict the films obvious anti vaccine belief. Has good information but don't take it as gospel as it only has half the facts.,1446681600,3,932,4.7592592592592595

6438118,1,B00KPUSDFE,The film is well made and is entertaining. They deserve any awards for filmmaking they got.  It's the dishonesty out of the gate attempting to claim they are looking at both sides fairly that I object to.  This is clearly a propaganda film for those against vaccines attempt to get their message out there.  I think that if their message still held water this would be a much bigger issue and so many people would not be dismissive.  I hate corporate greed and money in politics more than most but to ask me to believe that there is a conspiracy to withhold information that vaccines are harming our kids is silly.  This would mean that every scientist that has research this along with every health professional and elected official is in on this with all the big pharma companies and their employees and not a one of them care enough about our kids because of the money they make or fear of something.  Really?  Nobody with access to smoking gun information that might blow the lid off this for all the anti-vax folks is willing to come forward in all the people in all the fields related?

I have to admit that I couldn't make it through the whole ""documentary"" (I use that term very loosely - it would be more accurate to call this propaganda), because I was so disgusted with the lack of scientific integrity.  In the medical community there are not really 2 sides to the vaccine ""debate"" and there is really very little controversy. You know why it's so hard to find a pediatrician to sign a non-medically-necessary vaccine waiver? Because science shows that the benefits of vaccines far outweigh the risks. The vast majority of medical professionals support vaccination and fully vaccinate their own children. And we don't make a dime from it.

I have not found any and no doctor has been able to direct me to one.  I have also asked for studies where sanitation has been excluded from the data.  No one has been able to provide this.  I was looking for a reason to vaccinate.  I feel that information is crucial and the dismissive attitude by ""experts"" including the cdc, are cause for concern.

Through expert testimony from both sides of the debate and the middle ground in between, as well as interviews from families that have been negatively affected by vaccines, the issues are comprehensively addressed. Although some vaccines can be credited for preventing communicable diseases, no vaccine can be deemed 100% effective or safe. With any medical procedure or medication, there are always risks. The question is, does the risk of vaccinating outweigh the risks, or even possibility of contracting the disease? Can the vaccines be given selectively, one at a time, with greater time between doses?  These are all questions that are explored in this film. Since the 1980s the amount of required vaccines have tripled. On the same hand, cases of autoimmune disease, allergies, and neurological disorders have also increased due to mercury - thimerosal, aluminum, allergens(egg, latex, etc), and other components of the vaccines. To date, $2 billion has been paid out to families affected by vaccine injury. There have to be measures put forth in order to make vaccines safer.

6438143,5,B00KPUSDFE,"I wish this film had been out and I had known about it before I had my kids. I could have saved myself hundreds of thousands of dollars and years of driving them to auditory processing therapy, vision therapy, speech therapy, motor therapy, chelation. I had to see my kids suffer 44 ear infections by the age of 3, go through a combined 8 ear tube surgeries, 50 doses of antibiotics, and many other health interventions to restore their health, which was damaged by vaccines.  This film is touching from beginning to end. Gabby's story of a vaccine injury from the HPV vaccine (which now contains double the amount of aluminum as it did when Gabby got it) is heartbreaking. I have followed her story and she is still suffering many years later with seizures and other after effects from the vaccine. The boy who developed autism and had extremely high mercury levels was just like my child, so that story really hit home with me. Every parent wants to see their child live to their potential, and vaccines steal that potential away whether it is from autism, food allergies, asthma, learning disabilities or other debilitating illnesses, that are only increasing in children, not in adults who are much less vaccinated. But this makes no sense, because if the problem were with food or the general environment, adults have lived longer and have been exposed to more toxins. So adults should have more autism than kids if it was not the vaccines. Vaccines are the only intervention that kids are getting more of than adults.

The story of the Christner family was so enlightening, because she pointed out that even though she went to medical school, she was never taught about vaccine ingredients or vaccine reactions, so she had no idea how to recognize that her daughter was reacting severely to her vaccines until it was too late and the baby died.

The film talks to experts from both sides, so it respects the viewer's intelligence and allows them to hear unfiltered opinions from medical professionals who have opposing viewpoints, which lets parents make up their minds which makes  more sense or is more credible. The film points out how the system has built in conflicts of interest that prevent the proper science from being done and allows manufacturers to influence vaccine policies that affect their profits.

This film is moving - you won't get through it without crying.

It is professionally presented, giving an overview of the all the major issues, with testimony from a variety of doctors, researchers, even the CDC, FDA, and Pharma representatives, woven through compelling personal stories.
What is presented here are BOTH sides to the debate around: Herd Immunity, Gardasil, Cost vs Benefits of vaccines, what VAERS is (the vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System), the concept of delayed schedule, whether parents are ""smart"" enough to make these kinds of decisions for themselves, that big Pharma is not liable at all for vaccine injury, fear of an unvaccinated backlash and the risk that would pose, media bias, and ""crazy"" moms.

Our son had documented vaccine injuries back in 1993, when, as an infant, he suffered with horrific reactions (all documented by his pediatric staff in his medical records).  We didn't have the internet at this time; my attorney husband and I poured through mainstream peer reviewed medical journals, looking for any answers as to what had happened to our son.  People accuse us of being anti-vaccine, but they fail to understand THAT WE WERE VACCINATING OUR SON at the time he suffered with these reactions.

Vaccine reactions/injuries are REAL.  Vaccines are drugs and as with any pharmaceutical product, they can and do, cause harm and even death.  Vaccine injuries are NOT rare.",1433289600,5,823,4.956204379562044

""The Greater Good"" is a welcome and important addition to the ever-growing body of resources to which one can go to learn more about the dangers and inefficacies of vaccines, not to mention the vast corruption behind them from manufacture to mandate (hopefully, this movie will also stimulate one to question the wisdom of assaulting the body with such toxic and inflammatory invasions time and time again).  For anyone new to investigating vaccines for their children or themselves, this movie is a real eye-opener, and the viewer will not only be astounded by the new wealth of information they will learn, but they will be compelled to continue on their journey to discover the many hidden truths about vaccines that our government, pharmaceutical companies, and medical trade industry groups don't want you to know.

6438177,4,B00KPUSDFE,"My wife and I are in the middle of our research for vaccinations for our children. I came across this movie, and I purchased the five-day stream from their website, and we watched it tonight. It is high-quality and very engaging. Is this movie biased? Yes, it is. However, I also believe it is fair, especially compared to what is fed to us by politics and rich news channels.
In the documentary, they present the opinions and thoughts of many different camps. Unfortunately, those who simply ask for research are so quickly and unfairly placed into the anti-vaccination camp. However, the main plea of this documentary is not Stop the vaccinations! Its Give us the science, and give us the choice. It does not cram down your throat anti-vaccination propaganda. Instead, it begs for true science to be done so that all parents can make educated choices. Even three years after this movie was released, it is still popular. If true research and science were done, no matter what the conclusion, this movie would be stopped in its tracks.
What makes this movie powerful and dangerous to vaccination companies is the emotionally-driven stories of three families. However, this film also gives a seemingly fair voice to the pro-vaccination people, including the presidents of vaccination companies and developers of vaccinations. Of course, we don't have everything they said when the cameras were rolling. Instead, we just have what the production company wanted us to hear. So, what does this mean? Watch this movie with your brain and not your heart. Understand that it was produced for those of us on the fence and is powerful enough to persuade us. I definitely recommend you watch it if you're researching this topic. Watch this movie in ADDITION to your research not AS your research.",1411776000,6,1787,4.940199335548173
6438178,4,B00KPUSDFE,"The video contains the stories of three families that have had children injured or that have died as a result of getting a vaccination. The story of the family from Oklahoma that lost their baby girl is absolutely heartbreaking.

The story of the teenage girl that got the vaccination for HPV and was handicapped should be shared with every family that has a teenage or pre-teen. Just think; Rick Perry (the temporary best hope of the Republicans in 2012) was going to force every teenaged girl in Texas to get this vaccine. This is also important for those of us who live in the socialist state of California; our Democrat lawmakers have made it possible for a teenager to be approached directly while at school, the teenager can consent to getting the vaccination and all without the parents knowing anything about it. Since when is teenage consent legal?

For the third family; the one that has an autistic child, I would research alternate medicine on the internet; there must be something else that can be done. If this happened to my family; I would start my research with detoxing heavy metals and heavy metal cleansing.

I found the mention of the research on the effects of injecting aluminum into the bloodstream interesting, This is the first that I have heard of this research; it probably should receive more attention. That was the positive comments; now the bad.

I disliked the fact that this movie presented both sides. We can hear the pro-vaccine propaganda on the news, in the schools and in the doctors office any time we want. I think that presenting it here; mixed together with the anti-vaccine portions would only confuse someone that has not already made up their mind about vaccines. I found the movie more enjoyable when I fast forwarded through any of Paul Offit's statements. I can think of a Bible quote that applies to these pro-vaccine mouthpieces; ""If you were blind, you would have no sin. Since you say ""we see"", your sin remains.""

Do not be confused by this ""balanced"" film.  Don't learn about vaccines the hard way. Don't wait until someone you know and love has their life destroyed by this mixture of toxins. Do your own research. If you live in a state that does not allow an exemption for personal befief; vote with your feet - move to where your family will be safe. I wish you the best.

Being someone in the science's I would have preferred the movie focus on scientific research, and less on anecdotal evidence.  Unfortunately, 'The Greater Good' decided that anecdotal evidence was the mode of communication for this movie.  Seeing a mother cry for a lost child or explain how their child deteriorated following a round of vaccines only has so much of an effect.  Anecdotal evidence such as this supplies scientists with the hypothesis that vaccines cause more harm than is good/advertised, but to truly sway people and other doctors more scientific research would need to be done.  Some of this research has already been done, and should have been presented more thoroughly in this movie.  I would have liked the movie to focus more on the research that the psychiatrist (the woman who lost her child) did when researching vaccines after the death of her son rather focusing on what actually happened to her son.  All these stories are tragic but can be brushed off as very infrequent unfortunate side effects by the greater scientific community, but when you look at data from larger studies to make your point it becomes harder to refute.

Scientific data is more objective and less biased than anecdotal evidence, and the greater scientific community will be more willing to accept this conclusion if given more data and less stories.",1375056000,28,1545,4.938223938223938
6438187,4,B00KPUSDFE,"When I first put this DVD in, I couldn't get the pause, rewind, or other features to work.  That was very frustrating.  Evidently that was just a glitch, because later when I took the DVD out, and put it back in, those features were working. There were several times I hit ""rewind"" and watched parts a second and third time.  For 30 years I have been out of the mainstream just a little bit when it comes to my opinion about pharmaceuticals in general - vaccines included.  I bought the video to preview before recommending to my own daughters so they could begin their own pursuit of educating themselves about the options and consequences of vaccination practices.  Many pediatricians in our area are refusing to see patients whom they aren't allowed to vaccinate according to their schedule.  It has been our experience that when you go in with intelligent information, they will at least listen.

I don't think you should make your vaccination decision based solely on the information in this video.  It is a good start - to get you thinking; doing your own research and reading.  The internet makes it so much easier to access information than when I began my search 30 years ago.  Take advantage of the opportunity to educate yourself.  You will come across as less of a lunatic, regardless of your position, if you have a well-versed and researched position when questioned by family, friends and physicians.",1373241600,,1415,4.7818930041152266
6438188,1,B00KPUSDFE,"Paranoid nonsense by nitwits with a dangerous agenda.

The authors allege that the pharm companies, pediatricians and world health officials are engaged in a massive cover-up of vaccine dangers. A handful of doctors are interviewed along with parents who believe their children were endangered by vaccines. No scientific evidence is presented to back up such claims.

Low profit vaccines are alleged to be huge wage earners. Meanwhile the claims of anti-vaccine lawyers who hope to make a tremendous amount of money suing pharm companies are presented uncritically. Why are we supposed to believe that the vast majority of peds are engaged in a cover-up to hurt children while lawyers hoping to make a fortune suing have clean hands and pure motives?

Much of this focuses on the Gardasil vaccine. HPV is a dangerous illness that has infected millions of Americans. Thousands will develop cancer as a result. Rather than being presented as an incredible good that we have a way of preventing this disease, the film editors ignore this fact in favor of a bizarre series of unbacked assertions that the vaccine is harming children. What kind of human beings fear safe and proven methods of preventing cancer causing viruses? What kind of human beings shrug off deaths from cervical cancer (as Ms. Fisher does!) as of no consequences?

Other nonsensical claims are also presented equally uncritically. We are told that vaccine contain formaldehyde without being told that the average pear also contains formaldehyde as well as your very own body. Dangerous diseases like hep b are utterly downplayed while the minor risks of vaccination are hugely exaggerated. We are told that large numbers of unknown children are being sacrificed so that vaccine makers can earn a profit. The film ignores that vaccines are tested extensively and have been used to prevent disease for over two hundred years.

This argument makes no sense at all. We have no evidence that vaccines are endangering children. We also have no evidence, contrary to the assertions in the movie, that spacing out or delaying vaccines does anything but putting children in danger needlessly while offering no benefits. We certainly have no evidence that doctors and pharm companies and world health officials are involved a conspiracy, as this insane movie argues, to hurt massive numbers of children and then cover up that fact.

Ms. Fisher and her cohort of paranoid lunatics should be completely ashamed of themselves. If a single young woman gets cancer or hepatitis b because of their efforts, that will be to their eternal shame.",1371945600,29,2595,5.1084905660377355
