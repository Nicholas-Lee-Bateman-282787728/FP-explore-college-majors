8709176,2,B00V4TUE2A,"With a title like this, this one should have been all about a group of older, wealthy, & decadent lesbian women visiting a strip club where they proceed to get sexy, sensual nude lap-dances from beautiful young female strippers that each woman has personally selected, but for that concept to work you'd no doubt need a creative and talented director with a penchant for erotic scriptwriting, and that doesn't exactly describe Thomas Coven, who directed/wrote this one.  No, Coven's put together a DVD showing four already lesbian-couples engaging in everyday I-do-you-then-you-do-me sex with one another for no other reason than that they're together in the same bed.  He's also added three solo-vignettes involving a woman dancing NOT for another woman, but for the camera.  It's really kind of bland and not all that great!",1441324800,6,826,5.149253731343284
