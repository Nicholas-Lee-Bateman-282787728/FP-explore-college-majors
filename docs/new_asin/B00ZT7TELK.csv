7294665,5,B00ZT7TELK,"Saw this film here in Los Angeles at The Arena Theater and was pleasantly surprised. The cast is phenomenal, really good casting and acting. Story line was really interesting and very suspenseful , you never really knows whats going to happen next. The cinematography is also very good and adds to the atmosphere of the entire movie. its too bad this film never got an official theatrical release because I feel it really was that good. Now be warned that this movie isn't for the squeamish - its bloody, it can be offensive in some scenes, but it all seems to work as a whole.  If you a fan of horror I say give this film a try. Very good job by Director Madeleine Paxon, I'm curious to see what she does next.",1441584000,3,711,4.345864661654136

7294674,3,B00ZT7TELK,"It was neat, and a cool idea. Reminds me of those 90s thriller films. My biggest complaint honestly is the sound effects. A lot of the sound effects in this movie were just horrible. All of the gun shots sounded like they were recorded from an episode of Bonanza, which is really out of place and breaks the immersion. Aside from that, a decent movie. Worth watching if you want something mildly entertaining.",1470787200,,409,4.616438356164384

Great producing, scripting, acting, and directing.  I would recommend this to any adult.  While there is no nudity, there is a lot of graphic violence, drug use, and profanity.",1466812800,,320,4.526315789473684
7294680,4,B00ZT7TELK,"A very interesting story with good acting all around and a well written script. While there are moments of predictability, overall this movie was novel and a pleasure to watch.

7294681,5,B00ZT7TELK,"Normally, this repeating the day thing gets on my nerves. lately I have seen 2 such movies this one and ""Premature"" both are very different, Premature is hysterical. As for Blood Punch, this is basically a 3 person movie and these 3 persons are terrific. The 2 men Milo Cawthorne and Ari Boyland are outrageously perfect in their roles. The girl of the piece Olivia Tennet as the chainsmoking love interest of the 2 men is perfect, too. You have the shy and demure thin guy the bandits need to cook the meth and you have the girls psychopath of a boyfriend and the whatever type of girl attitude. I won't tell you anything about it because you will need to experience it, some things are rather predictable but still excellent. there is a bit of VERY dark humor here that I really did love and thought was terrific. The performances....terrific and the only negative would be the ""near"" end, not the very end itself....I hate the ""I will sacrifice myself for you even though you are a terrible person"" thing.",1465430400,2,1008,4.574585635359116
7294682,5,B00ZT7TELK,"Not really, but if that doesn't at least intrigue you, then ""Blood Punch"" probably isn't for you. As far as I'm concerned, it's better than that might suggest because it's not imitation Tarantino, which is a good thing. Imitation 'Tino is always a little weak for being imitation, no matter how good. It's also not quite the blood-soaked high energy action rush the title suggests. It's smarter than that. It's a puzzle pic that the audience gets to play along with. It's an intense mystery a la Russian Roulette with a bullet in all but one chamber. There's never any doubt that bad things are going to happen; you can feel it all the time. And they do, over & over again. And fortunately, despite its smarts, strong direction, clever story with twists galore, wonderful cast & characters, plus everything else that makes low budget thrillers genuinely thrilling, it doesn't cheap out on the violence, blood, action & thrills.
  Anyway, read the other reviews for the synopsis. What I'm saying is that if ""Blood Punch"" hasn't already become a cult classic, just as Groundhog Day & most of Tarantino's films have, it will. But don't be a dope & expect a great big-budget Hollywood film. If you do, you will be disappointed. Nevertheless, first time director, Madellaine Paxson has made a memorable debut film, well worth 100 minutes of your day. And one last thing, would it be a spoiler to let you know that you'd probably never guess that the appealing cast are almost all New Zealanders? Excellent accents.",1463616000,,1509,4.8
7294683,5,B00ZT7TELK,"""Blood Punch"" is a slasher film meets ""Groundhog's Day."" Olivia Tennet plays an over-the-top Skylar in a wicked dark humor role. Milo Cawthorne plays a slightly meek, geeky Jesse Eisenberg type character, complimenting Skylar. Wickedly funny. This is more of a dark comedy than horror.

7294688,4,B00ZT7TELK,"a fun hip, dark and violent take on Groundhog Day.  I would say it's Groundhog Day by way of Fight Club, perhaps not as great as those two films are in their own right, but Blood Punch features a fun cast and a scenario that starts to lose some steam just before it wraps itself up with another big wink at how cool it is trying to be. It comes close, very close. If you like Milo Cawthorne in Deathgasm, he shines here playing a different role. I hope he continues to luck into very fun and gory films, because I'd count myself as a fan now.",1461024000,,542,4.065420560747664

There's a much more developed plot than you usually see in low budget first features, but it's ultimately pretty cliche, and the inexperience eventually becomes impossible to ignore.  I had to quit after the 70 minute mark - a showdown at the airport was horribly amateurish.  If you just don't have time in your life to waste on beginner cinema, skip this one.

7294715,5,B00ZT7TELK,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

WOWI just finished BLOOD PUNCH, and I am happy to proclaim this film is now in the running for Best Horror Movie of 2015 in my book!  I didn't quite know what to expect going into this one, so I was delightfully surprised to discover just how good this movie really is.  Chocked full of intensity and dark humor, with brilliant writing and an enthralling storyline, this is one film you will want to visit over and over.

After pondering it for a bit, Ive concluded that I cannot say anything negative about this film at all.  This is a monumental feat, as I usually have one or two reservations about most of the movies I watch.  A lack of constructive commentary certainly signifies a winning title here.

BLOOD PUNCH is shot well and looks good onscreen.  When the movie first started, I was worried about the budget and how cheap the film might appear.  Thankfully, my concerns were unfounded.  The production value of the film looks modest, and the crew does a great job with the budget.

The acting in BLOOD PUNCH is very good, with Milo Cawthorne, Olivia Tennet, and Ari Boyland as the leads.  Cawthorne is a great geek as Milton, while Boyland shines as the jerk Russell.  Tennet stands out, however, as the multi-faceted Skylar.  These three share an onscreen chemistry that is almost magical.  This could be, in part, due to the fact that the three actors appeared together in POWER RANGERS R.P.M. several years ago.  This aspect of their dynamic made me smile; all three have come a long way since those days.

The special effects are also a winner here as well.  The carnage appears real, and the gore looks fantastic.  One of my favorite effects comes about when one of the characters steps inside the houseand right into a bear trap.  The resulting blood splash almost made me stand up and clap.

BLOOD PUNCH is a major win for me, and I highly recommend it to every horror and thriller fan out there.  It is very well written, and the story is mesmerizing.  The final scenes are the films ace-in-the-hole, and I found the ending thoroughly satisfying.  This movie has everything, and you just cant ask for much more.  The film is available now, so give it a look.",1444780800,4,2251,4.553615960099751
7294716,4,B00ZT7TELK,"A hellish horror blend of ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Breaking Bad"".  It's funny, irreverent, and keeps you guessing the whole time.  Oh, and all the wonderful kills that will cause you to ooh and ah.  Director Madellaine Paxson delivers a fun-filled freak of a show.  This is one to own, show to friends and watch their reactions.",1443657600,,324,4.732142857142857

7294718,4,B00ZT7TELK,"Surprisingly good indie film that makes the best use of low-cost settings. A good director, moderately-tight script, and capable actors together bring us a movie that is part film noir, part heist movie, and part Groundhog Day. While the pace was just slightly slower than I liked, I think the film made up for it with clever visual humor, interesting (and delightfully over-the-top) characters, and sheer fun.

Despite the movie poster---and the title---there is not an especially high degree of blood. I mean, there's SOME, but it's not like a Dario Argento film, and it doesn't come anywhere near the bloodiness of films like ""Pulp Fiction"". It is also, in my opinion, not a horror movie. I certainly was never horrified, or even particularly scared. But it engaged my brain, which is something I treasure in a movie, and it did so with wit and a fair bit of chutzpah.

Definitely recommended.",1442620800,3,896,4.8881578947368425
7294719,4,B00ZT7TELK,"I can't stress enough that all the special effects cannot save a movie that has a weak script and shallow characters.  Blood Punch is a nice departure from so many horror/thriller movies that put all the money in the flash but forget these two most important factors.  I would give Blood Punch a solid 3.5 stars.  The movie was driven by the clever script and strong performances from the two lead characters Olivia Tennet playing Skylar and Milo Cawthorne playing Milton.  The movie had a nice mix of suspense, humor, and gore.  If you enjoy black comedies think you will find that it is worth your time.",1442620800,2,605,4.616822429906542

A trio of stock characters that you've seen in many movies (the normal guy, the psycho guy, and the sexy femme fatale) end up in an isolated cabin together to cook up a huge batch of crystal meth so they can sell it and retire.  But from there, this traditional love-triangle set up quickly starts taking supernatural twists and turns that send the story corkscrewing off in amazingly unexpected directions. It's a weird movie, definitely not for everyone.  But it's fresh, clever, inventive and has a great (albeit very dark) sense of humor.  If you like having your mind messed with (in a David Lynch meets Philip K Dick meets David Cronenberg meets Harold Ramis kind of way), I'd definitely recommending giving this one a spin.",1441756800,,959,4.644970414201183

8720858,4,B00ZT7TELK,"""Blood Punch"" seems to be bunched in with 'horror' as a genre.  Actually this should be bunched in with a separate [never unmentioned] genre- 'the weird'.  'Weird' can be a very good thing, most ""Twilight Zone"" stories dwell there.  ""Blood Punch"" isn't Sci-Fi, either.  Maybe ongoing 'folklore/superstition'.
  When I started the DVD, last night, I had a very bad premonition.  The trailers that were on before the movie were poorly lite, acted, and looked  bad, all-around .  Not to mention Shot on digital, not on film.  But those premonitions were squelched after the first few scenes.
  ""Blood Punch"" starts off in/on terrible sets.  They took some crappy old building and used it an institution for- lesser criminals and addicts- as half-way house and rehab facility.  But the main characters are leaving there, and so it soon becomes nothing more then a footnote.
  I assume that the whole movie as shot on 'digital' but they used good lighting and kept away from very dark scenes.  Thus, those nasty digital artifacts were left to a minimum.  The directing and acting are well done, alone with the camera work.  Nice plot, pretty good script.  The over-all story was very nice and loose ends seem to have been nicely tied. **Remember- this is a film without much of a budget.**  So, if you can only deal with BIG ""Hollywood"", then all low budget films will fail for you.
  Basic plot:  Break chemical wiz-bang out of half way house to make crystal meth at secret location.  Use a girl as the 'romance/candy bait to make the wiz-bang hooked.  Take wiz-bang to secret, remote, valley cabin to make drugs.  Then find out that the valley comes with curse.  Work on resolution [which finally comes.]
  I really liked this movie and am glad that I bought it.
  SIDE NOTE:  I kept thinking: I've seen this guy before, where?  Finally: ""Jack Burton"" from ""Big Trouble in Little China"".  I love ""Big Trouble in Little China""  and have, always, wanted sequels.  Ari Boyland can take the torch from Kurt Russell.
