8475182,3,B005IX3C4A,"""Mad Dog Coll"" was but one of a flurry of grade-B gangster films churned out by the Hollywood studios during the late Fifties and early Sixties.  John Chandler, in the title role, played it to the hilt as a sneering, snarling, toothy, droopy-lidded  psychopath who seemingly got off sexually when killing.  Aside from the fact that a gangster named Vincent Coll actually had run amok in New York City during Prohibition, most of this film is highly fictionalized.  Several of the actors in the movie, however, were destined to emerge as major players on the celluloid screen. Telly Savalas plays the detective lieutenant who monitors Coll's meteoric rise and fall; Vincent Gardenia portrays Coll's nemesis ""Dutch"" Schultz; Jerry Orbach is ""Joe,"" a member of Coll's gang who is not quite cut from the same cloth as the rest of the boys.  If you blink you may well miss a young Gene Hackman in a non-speaking role (his first) as a policeman which lasts for all of maybe a minute or two.  There's plenty of violence and, as long as you can overlook the fact that this movie plays fast and loose with the facts, I suppose it can be considered entertaining in a corny way.",1454716800,,1167,4.668292682926829
8475183,4,B005IX3C4A,"Solid, low budget gangster film. The late John Chandler, an underrated actor, fills the roll well. The most interesting aspect of the movie
is its young cast who would later move on to greater parts: Jerry Orbach, Telly Savalas, Vincent Gardenia. Look for Gene Hackman
in a non speaking part as a cop early in the film. Very violent for its era but still recommended.",1426204800,,367,4.661538461538462
8475184,4,B005IX3C4A,"If you think about it, in any gangster movie you see, the gangster has some redeeming quality.  Al Capone was a bon vivant, cracking jokes and opening champagne; John Dillinger wrote jokey letters of appreciation to Henry Ford for making swift cars; Scarface rebelled at the prospect of blowing up a mother and her kids; Don Vito Corleone was a wise and benign paterfamilias who offered thoughtful bromides like, ""Women and children can afford to be careless, but not a man.""

  Then there's Vincent Coll, the ""Mad Dog,"" disturbingly recreated by John Davis Chandler in his screen debut.  An abused child grown into a monster, he is pure, unadulterated evil.  He carries a tommy gun under his trench coat like an Englishman carries an umbrella.  He laughingly mows down four dock drudges unloading Canadian whisky, gurgling in afterglow, ""You was in the way!"" He smashes a pretty, sensitive girl's violin then rapes her.  Most despicably, he recklessly sprays bullets at some rival gangsters and kills a couple of little kids.  This last episode was what earned the real Vincent Coll the epithet ""Mad Dog.""

  ""Johnny"" Chandler was the perfect choice to enact Coll.  Fair-haired, smirking, with half-closed eyelids, he sneers, whines, rages, and spits out hard-boiled lines like, ""Here we are just pickin' pimples and lookin' dumb!""  Coll manages to make up a gang of four, inexplicably including Joe, an essentially nice guy (Jerry Orbach).  Coll's racket is victimizing the Dutch Schultz gang by whisky hijacking and kidnapping.  Detective Telly Savalas notes Coll's underworld rise and steadily plots his fall.  The final judgement for Mad Dog sticks close to the facts of the 23-year-old psychopath's undoing.  Vincent sums up his life:  ""Hate! I hate!!""

  The makers of ""Mad Dog Coll"" are to be commended for daring to tell the story of a hood who was rotten down to his shoes, without any apologies for the harsh narrative.  John David Chandler, in real life an unassuming practitioner of yoga, was typed as Coll-like creeps for the rest of his career.  He was not able to shake the shadow of his memorable portrayal.  He went on to act for Sam Peckinpah several times, and also played a whiny mama's boy sitting down for breakfast in a mid-1970s Eggo commercial!",1410566400,3,2270,4.957559681697613

8475186,5,B005IX3C4A,"This is probably one of the most under rated gangster films of all time, I had always seen it on TV growing up with commercials. It is truly awesome that after several decades it finally surfaced in a DVD format. The cast and script is one of the best of all time, John Chandler hold's his own along with film gangster icons like Bogart and Cagney! not to mention Telly Savalas and Jerry Orbach are you kidding me! If you love classic gangster movies this one should not be missing from your DVD collection!",1402185600,,507,4.404255319148936

8475188,3,B005IX3C4A,"You can go on Wikipedia and read the TRUE history of Vincent Coll. The movie really plays fast and loose with historical events. The star played the the part well, but there was way too much romance involved and not enough action. Could have been much better, even back when this was made. For a better mob movie, check out ""Murder Inc."" with Peter Falk.",1388188800,,354,4.461538461538462
8475189,5,B005IX3C4A,I saw this movie recently on TCM and it was really good. Mad dog Vincent Coll was played brilliantly by Chandler as he really seemed insane. Telly Savalis plays a Detective who is after his gang and Jerry Orbach from none other than Dirty Dancing in it as one of Coll's friends. All in all the acting was superb and the story was great although I'm not sure how true to life it was as I have not researched the life of Mad Dog. Anyone who like gangster noir films will like this movie to watch and for their collection.,1337904000,5,519,4.2
