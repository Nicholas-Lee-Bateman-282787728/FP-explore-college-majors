2452577,4,B000C3L2P2,"Steven Soderbergh got his start with a little independent film called ""sex, lies and videotape"". The film changed the Independent film world in many ways and Soderbergh himself has gone on to make a dizzying variety of films, some great, some terrible, but almost always interesting. His new film, ""Bubble"", is both a return to his roots and a bold new experiment. The film first.

Martha (Debbie Doebereiner) and Kyle (Dustin James Ashley), work together in a doll factory, in a small West Virginia town, providing one of the few places for steady employment. The work is dull and repetitive, but it helps them survive. Martha, a portly woman who also provides care for her elderly dad, is a good thirty years older than Kyle, but she has a crush. She gives him a ride to work every day and part of their routine includes stopping for doughnuts every morning. Then, after a few hours, they take lunch together, driving to nearby fast food places and bringing the food back to their communal, bright, and empty lunch room. After work, Martha even drives Kyle to his second night job before she returns home, to sew, and watch television with her father. Soon, the factory gets a new order and they hire Rose (Misty Dawn Wilkins), to help with the increased work. Much closer to Kyle's age, the two seem to bond, more out of boredom than anything else. Martha doesn't appreciate the intrusion.

Soderbergh is one of my favorite directors due in a large part to his constant experimentation, both in narrative and the technical aspects of his films. In previous films, he has experimented with shifting time; in a scene, we hear dialogue from the characters we are watching, as they finish eating, or fighting adding a level of urgency to an otherwise mundane scene; using monochromatic colors to create a modern form of Film Noir (see ""The Limey"", ""The Underneath"" and ""Out of Sight""); more mainstream dramas, such as ""King of the Hill"", one of the most underrated films ever, and ""Erin Brockovich"", which was more mainstream but still contained variations of the previous elements. But Soderbergh got his start in Independent Film, so while he may make the occasional clunkers like ""Full Frontal"", one of the worst films I have ever seen, and a remake of ""Solaris"", starring George Clooney, he also makes films like ""Bubble"".

If you go into ""Bubble"" expecting the all-star casts of his current crop of films, you will be very disappointed. ""Bubble"" is the story of three people, and all three are played by unknowns. Their unfamiliarity helps to make the story and their situation much more believable. The film spends a lot of time setting up their lives, their personalities and how they fit together. Because of the relatively rural location of their lives, and the dullness of their existence, this doesn't take long. But it is important for us to see this, to get their situation, to understand and experience a portion of the mind-numbing boredom and loneliness they experience on a daily and hourly basis.

I would be very surprised if this film cost more than a million dollars and took more than a few weeks to shoot. Because the film follows the unknowns into their simple homes, and uneventful lives, the film has a unique feel, giving the audience the feeling we are eavesdropping. Adding to this illusion, Soderbergh rarely moves the camera. It sits and records these newcomers interacting, giving the film a unique `documentary-like' feel. In one scene, Kyle and Martha are sitting in the doughnut shop. Martha tells him she wants to take his picture, because he's such a good friend. He stands up, blocked from our view by a hanging plant.

""Bubble"" is all about these three people and presents a unique character study. We understand why 50-something Martha, overweight Martha, would feel attracted to 20-something Kyle, skinny Kyle. Martha is so bored with her life, and has been bored for so long, she now accepts it. Martha is the type of person who becomes excited about a possible $50 bonus, Martha and Kyle are the type of people a $50 bonus would mean a lot to, as they are always dreaming of taking trips or saving up for new cars. Kyle is no great prize, as he spends little time outside of his two jobs or his bedroom where he smokes pot. When Rose enters the picture, she is new and exciting to Kyle (he actually smiles, but only briefly) and a threat to Martha.

The previous collaboration from director Soderbergh and writer Coleman Hough was the dismal ""Full Frontal"", one of the worst films I have ever seen. ""Bubble"" is a far better film, which isn't saying a whole lot. This isn't a fast-moving film, but it presents a unique slice of life in a way that we really feel we get to know these people. And for that reason alone, it is worth watching.

Now, about the experiment...

""Bubble"" is an experiment, of sorts, in distribution. I can see both benefits and problems to this experiment and I think the problems far outweigh the benefits.

The film was released simultaneously in theaters and on DVD and will play on some cable networks beginning a few days later.

From what I understand, this is the brainchild of Mark Cuban, the billionaire who owns the Landmark Theaters chain and also an independent film distribution company. Normally, an independent film will play in a handful of theaters in New York, Los Angeles, maybe San Francisco and Toronto. As they play in these large cities, the film would ideally build both word-of-mouth and critical praise. As momentum builds, the distributor can move the film into more theaters in more cities and states, gradually increasing the run. Sometimes, you have a breakout and the film begins playing in large multiplexes. More often than not, the film follows a set release pattern, playing many theaters, but in a slow, prearranged pattern. Some states and cities may never see the film, there just isn't enough interest.

Until the film is released on DVD. The revenue generated from DVD sales and rentals far outweigh the box office generated from any film. Now, a theatrical run is viewed as promotion for the inevitable DVD release. This is why a film like ""The Legend of Zorro"" takes a scant four months to reach DVD. Naturally, independent films take longer to reach DVD. The companies are smaller and they want the theatrical release to catch the attention of all of those mom and pop video store owners.

So how does releasing ""Bubble"" concurrently in theaters and on DVD, with a cable run close behind, benefit the film or the public? As mentioned, many people never have the opportunity to see an independent theater in a film in their community. Either the film is too small to play in the local theater, or there isn't enough interest. These people have to wait for the DVD. If the film is released on DVD on the same day it appears in theaters, they don't have to wait. But how will they know about the film? Will they even want to see the film before they have heard any comments about it? Will the Blockbuster in Pocatello, Idaho even bother to carry it? If the film receives a lot of pre-release publicity, they might know about it. But many independent films won't benefit from this. I can't imagine a lot of people running to the video store to rent ""Junebug"" on the day it opened. Because it was just beginning to receive a lot of critical praise and attention.

If a film is released on DVD the same day it begins playing in theaters, and you have access to both, why should you see it in the theater? A lot of independent theaters are small, boxlike environments which don't offer state of the art projection and sound. Thankfully, this is becoming rarer, but these theaters have a long way to go. When they depend on a new Woody Allen film or a new version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" to create a lot of box office, helping them stay open, what happens when people can watch these films at home, instead of spending a lot of money going to the movies? Clearly, the movie theaters lose and the viewers lose. As the audience decides to stay home, theaters lose money and there may end up being even fewer venues for some of these films to play. The audience loses as well. There is simply no substitute for watching a film in a theater with a bunch of other people. If you are watching a film at home, you aren't going to react the same way you would if there are a bunch of like-minded people ready to enjoy the experience with you. Check out the new DVD edition of ""Sin City"" for a great example of how this works.

The real key for this test will come with the first simultaneous release of a Tom Cruise or Julia Roberts film. I doubt this will ever happen. The movie studios aren't willing to risk losing the $100 million or so they generally get from films starring the A-List. Yes, the DVD revenues eclipse theatrical, but studios are almost guaranteed at least $100 million from a Julia Roberts or Tom Cruise film. Why would they give up $100 million and then additional money from future DVD, Cable and Television showings? They wouldn't. I wouldn't. I don't think you would either. Perhaps I am wrong, but I don't think I am.

From what I understand, ""Bubble"" is playing primarily at Landmark Theaters. This is the chain recently purchased by Mark Cuban. And many of these theaters are very nice. It seems a shame that he I willing to rob his own venues of potential revenue. But then again, he owns the company that produced and releases ""Bubble"". He doesn't seem to be losing anything. The audience is the only potential loser.",1138665600,3,9541,4.667459845330161
2452578,4,B000C3L2P2,"""Bubble"" is a faux-documentary.  It explores the numbing boredom of factory work and the need of people who have no ability or appreciation of how to ""get a life,"" with the universal desire to connect.  The photography and cinematography are outstanding, often evocative of Edward Hopper, and just as poignant.  The non-professional cast is exceptional.  The movie may be a turn-off to the cineplex movie-goer, who expects slick production values and polished performances. Kudos to Soderbergh and the Wagner/Mark Cuban production duo for giving the serious movie-goer a thought- provoking 75 minutes in the dark.",1138492800,20,613,5.421052631578948
2452579,5,B000C3L2P2,"Another brillant piece of work from the director who refuses to be pigeon-holed, his work reminds one of not only American indie stalwarts like Jarmusch, the Coens, etc... but also European and Asian minimalists like Kiarostami, Antononi, Wong Kar Wai, Kaurismaki and Renaisis.

Soderbergh coaxed great performances for the non-professional cast and his visual is a treat as always.

Definitely not a plot-driven multiplex fare, not a masterpiece, but a must see nonethless, for any who values cinema not only as a storytelling medium BUT rather, a VISUAL-AUDIO experience.",1138320000,39,573,5.426966292134831
2452580,1,B000C3L2P2,"Rarely in the history of cinema marketing (think Cinerama, 3-D, even John Waters' ""Smell-O-Rama"") has the initial exposure of a process or ""gimmick"" led to a more dreary filmgoing experience.  Simultaneous release of a motion picture in theatres, TV, and DVD should be set back years and possibly terminated immediately by ""Bubble"".  When you use non-professional actors, what appears to be washed-out Super 8mm film (its actually hi-def video), and have no motion (essential to ""moving pictures"" or we call the medium ""cave painting"") what can you possibly hope to achieve except ""amateur night at the movies"".

If you want to know what average people talk about (or in this case, mumble about)visit a diner, but don't waste your time trying to maintain a conscious state with this dud.",1138320000,12,787,5.0852713178294575
2452591,4,B000C3L2P2,"Soderbergh's ""Bubble"" is definitely one of his less ambitious ventures, but still provides a thought provoking experience.  Using non-professional actors in a remote, impoverished small town in Ohio, Soderbergh is not unlike Gus Van Sant in being able to make a big something out of a big nothing.

Martha, an obese redheaded woman who works at a doll making factory with a mighty strange young co-worker named Kyle, has a very lonely and unfulfilling life.  She has a generous heart and takes care of her elderly father while working constantly.  Her attraction to Kyle is apparent from the first scene, perhaps because he is a good listener; aside from working and smoking weed, he does and says very little.  We discover later on that Kyle suffers from panic attacks and was forced to drop out of high school because of them.  Both are vulnerable, banal, good people, which makes the events later in the film even more tragic.

Rose, a seemingly ordinary and attractive young woman, comes to work with the two of them.  This is when Martha's deeply, deeply repressed rage begins to surface in very quiet ways.  As she sits in a Baptist church, a light begins to shine on her face, a bluish hue, and suddenly the church is abandoned and she is all alone.  Kyle and Rose start to flirt a little. The film's ""main event"" happens so quickly and with such a mysteriously ordinary logic that it leaves one in a momentary state of shock.  The most sympathetic character is the most monstrous one, and it is hard to swallow while being entirely believable.  The question Soderbergh fails to answer and that is most important is:  is the ""villain"" responsible or not responsible for what she's done?

I think Soderbergh called it ""Bubble"" because everything takes place in such a non-dramatic, non-descript way, and the quality of the character's lives are very low.  Even out of this melancholy framework, though, an act of passion can emerge.  A chilling and memorable movie.",1221955200,2,1971,4.821428571428571
2452592,5,B000C3L2P2,"Working with a miniscule budget and solely with non-actors, Steven Soderbergh (of ""Sex, Lies and Videotape"", ""Traffic"" and the ""Ocean 11"" series) has made a minimalist masterpiece with noir sensibilities that dissects the veneer of small town America in ""Bubble"", one of 2006's great films.

Look beyond the non-professional surface of this film (photographed completely in Digital Video using houses of the cast as sets, and employing their natural light and found props, as well as lots of improvised dialogue) and you'll find a film that approaches the essence of pure cinema. It tells a story of three very ordinary people in a small Midwestern town whose inhabitants mainly work in a doll factory, but what occurs reveals so much truth as to what's repressed under the depressing sadness of working class Americans. Under Soderbergh's inspired directing, it's astonishing how much you find yourself feeling for all the characters and how finely-tuned your senses are to every subtle gesture and expression of these lonely people. A great human document, and a magnificent film experience you'll not likely forget.

An interesting note: Soderbergh planned the making of this film as an experiment, and decided to release it simultaneously in the cinemas and on DVD at considerable risk.  I am guessing it didn't pay off monetarily, but it certainly did succeed as a work of art. One of these is worth a hundred Oceans films!",1221004800,5,1428,5.120171673819742
2452593,5,B000C3L2P2,"If you're looking for a blockbuster with exploding cars and crashing trucks, this ain't it. Bubble is a simple, understated, moody film that spins itself slowly into greater and greater complexity. Using non-actors, Soderbergh manages to pull realistic and revealing performances and create an overall subtle but suspenseful mood. This film is all in the nuances. Take a deep breath, sit back, and let this film flow by and amaze you.

This film also stands as a shining example of the filmic possibilities opened up by new technologies, not in terms of the flashy special effects we're constantly bombarded with, but in terms of being able to take a high def digital camera and, using available lighting, create a beautiful professional looking film. Every budding director should see this film and open their minds and eyes to what can be done with very little equipment and a big dose of talent.",1217203200,8,898,4.947019867549669
2452594,5,B000C3L2P2,"I loved this movie, although that wasn't my initial reaction (at first I thought, ""Good Lord, this is like watching paint dry""). But here it is, the next day, and it still haunts me, the images burned into my brain. I have been reading the negative reviews on here and can see some of the point to many of them. But what many people seem to miss (I think) is that this is a very complete film about people trapped in a dead-end place in dead-end jobs. These are people whose lives offer little in the way of hope or excitement. The murder that occurs in the film made perfect sense to me and the epiphany moment near the end where the murderer realizes truly what she's done is one of the images that stays with me. I grew up in a little town very much like Belpre, where Bubble was shot (and not that far from it) and I thought Soderbergh really got beneath the surface of these people and portrayed them with a sense of honesty and dignity. The simplicity of this film is what makes it stunning and so arresting artistically...although it is simple, it is never simplistic. Soderbergh proves him craftsmanship here as an artist: he never tells, he just shows. And the discerning viewer is definitely rewarded.",1214179200,4,1211,4.45945945945946
2452595,5,B000C3L2P2,"Much has been written about the minimalist approach taken for this film but I'd like to comment on the setting.  The bleak scenes of factories, a trailer park, restaurants, a pawn shop, a bait shop, and even a cemetery provide another character encased in the ""bubble"" of the title.  While I enjoyed the film, the setting left me claustrophobic, which was probably the intention of the director.

Just to be fair to the Mid-Ohio Valley, the Belpre, OH and Parkersburg, WV area is actually filled with beautiful homes, parks, and buildings.",1210896000,3,539,4.9010989010989015
2452596,1,B000C3L2P2,"This movie is in my 10 worst by far.  Very boring direct-to-HDNET Movies-movie that really accomplished nothing.

Just save yourself sometime and avoid this one.",1200441600,,161,5.4
2452597,4,B000C3L2P2,"Soderbergh's minimalist ""experiment"" has been called a masterpiece of subtlety and an art-wrecked pastiche of boredom.  Brilliantly conceived quietude and undercooked social commentary.  Amazing or just plain dull.

What you feel about it depends on your level of patience.  The story behind ""Bubble"" is not much of a story at all.  Red-headed and middle-aged Martha works at a doll factory with the lanky, dead-eyed Kyle.  They have the kind of thread-thin friendship that can only exist between employees suffering under the same deadening, colorless job.  Their conversation is the same watery teal as the drab Ohio horizon into which they drive every early morning.

Enter: Rose.  A pale single mother with a beauty as fragile as her glances, another slight mid-western soul whose life is equal shades of futureless blue and inert, raging red.  Like Martha and Kyle, Rose keeps her head down and scrabbles a personality out of her habits, hobbies, and adamant lack of hopes.  When the three have a lunchtime conversation around bags of fast food, the interplay is so real, you may either be fascinated or bored.  Having been raised in the rural mid-west and now pushing my life through the metal dust of downtown Seoul, I found this part of the movie to be the most dismally touching.  Three hearts that have already been broken long before the film has been exposed to them.  Can they be broken again?

Maybe.  The movie credibly coalesces around a murder ""mystery,"" taking as much patient time as the investigating detective, and just as adamantly refusing to take sides or seep with a single drop of tear or sweat.  What happened and by whom, well, it's not that big of a deal.  It's the whys which are the greatest presence here.  People who have no hope can still have fears, can still feel thwarted by life.  What happens when those contained blues and reds bleed one into another?

The actors are all regular Joes and Janes found by Soderbergh and company among the working class of West Virginia and Ohio.  As many have said before, they turn in performances as rock solid and sure as any of the million-dollar names today, with the exception of Dustin James Ashley, who plays Kyle at such a neutered remove that he is about as expressive and engaging as the plastic dolls he spends all day making.  I'm sure that was the point, and it plays well into the hands of the movie's pregnant soul, but it's also not very impressive.  Anyone can play a blank.

The movie may seem as empty as a blank to viewers with more conventional tastes, but there's a hypnotic rush to every frame.  It's the ache of a muscle that has not been unclenched in a long time, a fist that is only slowly pried open, a dark bubble that won't pop, even when it's poked by the bony hand of death.  Not much happens, sure.  But then again, everything does.",1200355200,7,2838,4.690283400809717
2452598,1,B000C3L2P2,Neat experiment but unfortunately one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I think I read like they ad-libbed the script or something? I'm sure someone will say they didn't and the genius of the movie was that it looked like they did. God-awful boring.,1200355200,,251,4.6
2452599,4,B000C3L2P2,"I was excited to get 'Bubble,' as this would be the first HD DVD I owned that came directly from HD video, instead of being a downgrade from 35mm film.  I'm happy to report that it's got all of the advantages you'd hope for: there's nothing in the way of specks or print damage (no print!) and the image is remarkably stable.  It's also about as good-looking a movie as I've seen made with HD video, photographed by someone who knows how to light for it and get some terrific results.  Even in a quiet, non-showy movie like this, there are a few shots with breathtaking detail and color.  Its reproduction on HD DVD is stellar.

Unfortunately I can't speak for the sound, as I don't yet have the proper equipment, but this is a pretty uncomplicated sound mix with only three channels, and if the Dolby Digital Plus track sounds as clear as it does on my built-in speakers, I doubt it or the DTS-HD track will disappoint.

As for the extras, they include a commentary track with Steven Soderbergh and Mark Romanek (I have yet to listen to it, alas) and an episode of the HDNet show 'Higher Definition' in which Soderbergh is interviewed about the film and its unusual distribution scheme.  There are also a handful of trailers for other Magnolia high-def releases.  The trailers and the TV episode are all presented in HD, which was a nice surprise given that so many releases from bigger companies opt for 480p/480i for special features.

Unfortunately, while the ""Higher Definition"" episode is exclusive to the HD DVD/Blu-ray releases, both of them are missing quite a few features from the DVD.  If you want the cast commentary track, a deleted scene and alternate ending, the making-of featurette, a photo gallery and audition footage for the three leads, the DVD is the only place to find it.  If you loved this movie as much as I did, I'd say pick up the HD version for the movie itself--it's beautifully done, believe me--and look for a used copy of the DVD (they run veeery cheaply at chain video stores and Amazon) for the remaining extras.",1198195200,2,2048,4.6143250688705235
2452600,5,B000C3L2P2,"""Bubble"" is a small film that captures the lives of the working poor in the U.S. better than any film I've ever seen. Caught in a poor area on the West Virginia-Ohio border, the characters here move through their lives like mute beasts, holding down two jobs, going to down-at-heel bars for amusement, and living lives of crushing boredom on the edge of poverty. Martha, a large, middle-aged woman with flaming red hair and a quiet, generous soul, lives with and cares for her father. The only bright spot in her day is seeing Kyle, a twenty-something high school dropout who works in the doll factory with her, and whom she drives to work. The scenes in the factory are surreal--the women workers paint cheery bright faces on the dolls, while their bodies are born when Kyle pulls them out of hot rubber molds with a tool that looks like forceps. The body parts pile up in lifeless heaps, stillborn. A single inexplicable event shatters the calm of these lives of ""quiet desperation."" This is a very sad film, painful to watch, but moving. You may or may not love it, but you won't feel you wasted your time.",1197244800,2,1109,4.577889447236181
2452611,4,B000C3L2P2,"I liked this movie.  The filming was beautiful.  The strumming acoustic guitar soundtrack was perfect.  And the story was interesting!  It's genius was in how un-decorated by popular stereotypes the characters in this movie went about their business.  The dialogue was interesting and (mostly) believable.  The only thing I had kind of a hard time believing was the relationship between the kid at the factory and the older lady.  We were given no reason for her devotion to him.  It didn't feel like it was reciprocated on his part - we know she likes him - but why?

Still, this movie is well worth the watch.  I give it an A-.  Very refreshing.",1195516800,,647,4.6371681415929205
2452612,3,B000C3L2P2,"Some reviewers mention that one is left wanting something to happen or that it is a boring film.  I think the point is that nothing really spectacular happens. Even the ""spasm of violence"", as another reviewer puts it, is low-key.  Everything that happens before and after the murder (and even the murder itself) is supposed to make you feel the monotony and drabness of the characters' lives and hurt you (maybe to the point of making you want to escape from the drabness and monotony of your own life even though you probably can't) once the movie is over.  Which brings me to another point: the movie is a whole which makes the first part worthwhile and not just an exercise in masochism.
Everything aims at conveying the quiet despair: the scenery, the music (trying to strike a note of energy but coming off melancholy and listless) which is repeated throughout the movie, the absence of music throughout most of the movie, the dialogue, which is the dialogue between people who have little to say to each other, etc.
So when a reviewer complains that the murderer knew the victim for only a week she should consider how few dreams (illusions really: aruba) she has left and how much bitterness and hopelesness there is in her, and that in a fit of rage one hardly stops to think: Oh, but I have know this woman for only a week.
The ""acting"" seemed convincing and the dialogue reminded me of how people really talk.  Maybe people who expect dramatic outpourings of emotion consider the absence of these bad acting.
All in all I think that some reviews are unfair and some are manifestations of poor understanding or sensibility, but I don't think this is a movie you'd want to watch often (or even twice) or call your favorite. I found it painful but that's not necessarily a bad thing if it tells you something is wrong.",1189814400,,1826,4.609230769230769
2452613,4,B000C3L2P2,"First off, I would like to dispense with the idea of summarizing the action of this movie, 1) because its brevity doesn't allow for many hidden plot twists, and 2) I have found that movies in general are a lot better when I know little or nothing about them beforehand.
Secondly, let me go on the record saying I think Soderbergh is the victim of a double standard with regard to this movie. Had it been made by a down-and-out rookie from Belpre and distributed in the accepted fashion, you'd more than likely be reading scores of positive reviews about a sparkling young talent ready and willing to revolutionize American independent cinema as we know it and change the way we look at movies per se. But because this is Steven Soderbergh, who already did that (or something like it) back in the late 80's. Hence the typical reaction I see here accuses him of squandering his financial assets and reputation on ""minimalist experiments"". A movie is a movie, I say. The notion that Soderbergh should stick to the big leagues and leave these little arthouse pictures to those whose budgets are already very slim strikes me as pointlessly restrictive. I wish there were more big-shot filmmakers out there with enough nerve to return to their humble origins like this.
That being said, it's also worth noting that his aesthetic approach is not unprecedented. The old stay-true-to-life, pure-improvisaton movie has existed in various incarnations at least since John Cassavetes' SHADOWS (1959). Soderbergh's decision to release BUBBLE simultaneously through three different media outlets does not have much significance to me, outside of its being boycotted by certain theaters, which was probably a good thing. It's just too bad they couldn't find a better movie to boycott.
Much as I admire BUBBLE as a movie, I wouldn't go so far as to call it ""beautiful"". The moments of beauty in it are few and far between, but the fact is they count for far more than whatever approximations of beauty Steven Soderbergh could muster in his big-budget genre productions. 'Nuff said.",1188000000,,2065,4.919770773638969
2452614,3,B000C3L2P2,"Director Steven Soderburgh headed this story of factory workers on the Ohio/West Virginia border who become involved in a murder.  Soderburgh uses real area residents with no acting experience and their homes to portray his characters and locations and I do applaud him for showing an area of the country and a class of Americans way under represented by the typical Hollywood film.  However as a former resident of Ohio (though the opposite side of the state) and a daughter of two blue collar workers until their retirement and a veteran of four summers working in Ohio factories for college money myself I find his character portrayals condescending and stereotypical as well as a bit offensive. Some spoilers follow but the film is more about character than plot.

Martha, the main character, is overweight and middle aged but seems to take pride in giving her elderly father good at home care so he can stay out of a nursing home, is treated well and seemingly appreciated at her doll factory job (though probably underpaid) and has interests we are shown in sewing, television and her church.  Sure life as the privileged know it has passed her by and like many unattached middle aged ladies she seems to take too much interest in other people's business but she looks  way too stable to commit the act she is later imprisoned for especially on a victim she has known for a week!  Perhaps we are supposed to believe her excess weight and her uncomplaining acceptance of her life are signs that she is about to strangle with her bare hands a young woman whose child she just competently babysat while said child is asleep in the next room.

Kyle is a cute twentyish young man who also works at the doll factory  and (I admit I thought this was weird) Martha considers him her best friend and drives him to work and eats lunch with him.  The script lets us know he has had panic attacks which caused him to drop out of high school supplying the reason he still lives at home with his mom, is still saving money for a car and still living in this part of the country.

Rose is about Kyle's age, an attractive single mom with a penchant for using people and sneaky acts like pocketing a watch on a dresser when she is at her job as a cleaning lady.  She is hired at the doll factory because of the ""big rush"" becomes friendly with Martha who she uses and asks for favors and with Kyle who she dates on the last night of her life and robs him of ""dresser drawer"" money while he is getting them a beer.  Martha is clearly threatened by Rose and we are not sure if it is just her budding relationship with Kyle or because she is young, pretty, thin and sneaky.  Yet still in one week's time could any functioning person likely do what Martha is accused of doing?

I think the film would have worked better as a slice of lower middle class life without the murder which has many gaping plot holes that strain credibility. Another problem with the film is the symbolism between the characters and the doll factory as well as the title of the film are not made fully clear.  Many of the supporting actors do do outstanding jobs with special note going to the men filling the roles of Martha's pleasant elderly father, the detective who interviews the suspects and Rose's former boyfriend.  I admit I ""googled"" Steven Soderburgh and on finding he has apparently no blue collar roots (his father was an academic dean in Louisiana) or experience of any kind with the type of people he is filming my opinion of him was not enhanced and he seems more guilty of exploiting both the small town(s) and its residents in this film.",1186099200,,3617,4.5160796324655434
2452615,5,B000C3L2P2,"Hollywood likes its melodrama. It likes every cop to come across as a dire grim reaper of the law, every wayward young adult to be bouncing off the walls with angst, and every middle-aged person to be attractive and professional beyond what most people are. What amused me most about watching Bubble is there's no attempt at all to mold the story into the practically taken for granted cliches that now ooze out of movies. It cuts close to reality by using unknown actors, shooting on location, and letting us try to understand the characters in it on our own. Some people may say this is boring, but I enjoyed it more than any blockbuster I've seen lately.

The basic plot begins with a young man Kyle, and a much older woman, Martha, working together at a doll factory, where they assumedly make just getting by wages. The events that unfold are better left to be watched, but suffice to say there is tragedy in the movie. However, I'd say really it's a slice of life movie more than anything. Short and sweet at just over an hour, but I wouldn't pay too much considering that length.",1185840000,,1086,4.5126903553299496
2452616,3,B000C3L2P2,"That's the best summary for this film.

My first experience with Steven Soderbergh was TRAFFIC. Loved the ultra-stylized shots and pacing of that movie. Saw OCEAN'S ELEVEN and liked the smart storyline and slick shots of that one, too. So I coupled my love of cinema--especially experimental cinema--with some enjoyable Soderbergh of the past and kept my fingers crossed that his latest offering, stocked with non-professional actors and mostly-improvised dialogue, would entertain me nearly as much as the two aforementioned titles.

A slow, horribly-acted, extremely self-aware and yet surprisingly captivating movie ensued. Slow because it took more than 50 minutes into a 73 minute movie for any real action to occur. Horribly-acted because Soderbergh didn't direct these people very well; regardless of their non-professional status, bad acting still lies on the shoulders of the director. Thumbs down to Soderbergh there. Extremely self-aware because the entire movie felt like a documentary and nothing more, a cross between AMERICAN MOVIE and a first year film student's final project.

Despite all that (or maybe because of it), BUBBLE is riveting. You see the insides of some very despondent lives, feeling as stuck in small town Nowhere, U.S.A., as the characters. Having grown up in a small town that holds no promise, I saw many of my friends and neighbors reflected through the main characters as they become numb to their routines and watch their dreams die. It's sad, and made me extremely grateful that I got out of my hometown when I did and am currently pursuing my dreams.

That said, BUBBLE is like a graceful, slow motion ten car pile-up with no injuries, just people who walk away to drive another day. It's got very little good cinema in it, but what it does have is tremendously moving. If you want a taut thriller or drama, rent THE DEPARTED. If you want to look into lives filled with quiet desperation, rent BUBBLE.",1179964800,,1943,5.0625
2452617,4,B000C3L2P2,"Steven Soderbergh's BUBBLE is extremely interesting in the way the movie leads us to think about cinema and its reality. Take, for instance, the scenes when the police officer tells Martha, Kyle and Kyle's mother that Rose has been murdered. In a mainstream movie, the director would have emphasized the surprise or the emotional shock felt by the characters. In BUBBLE, the actors react with such sentences as ""Gee, I can't believe that"" or ""Sorry, could you repeat ?"" or even silence, reactions that are not very cinematic but maybe closer to reality than the cinematic tears flowing over the face of a well-known star.

So I don't understand certain ultranegative reactions found here at Amazon. It's clear that movies like BUBBLE don't represent the future of cinema but they are certainly worth a look. To be a movie fan is to try to appreciate or, at least, tolerate the movies that are not one's cup of tea. In every film, there are at least five minutes of pure cinematic pleasure. Not to miss them is one of the greatest pleasures the seventh art can provide to any serious movie buff.

2452618,4,B000C3L2P2,"`Bubble,' a low budget indie release, has more to it than meets the eye.  Seeming to enact a mundane slice of life with a sudden catastrophe, the film shines with authenticity and a haunting, lingering presence long after the credits roll.

Taking place in a small town in Ohio, we follow the plodding lives of three workers at a local doll factory.  All the details flow from scene to scene.  They talk about the long hours and the humdrum facts of their existence in the break room.  Martha (Debbie Doebereiner) is high in seniority.  Not much excites her in life.  She is there to help in a neighborly way and clarify the finer points of work and fringe benefits at the plant.  At home she takes care of her father (Omar Cowan), who, without her help, would probably be put in a nursing home.  Kyle (Dustin James Ashley) is her younger co-worker.  Everything seems normal until Rose Hilliard (Misty Wilkins) comes to work at the factory.  Rose fits in early and well.  She has many stories to tell about the nursing home from which she resigned.  Subtly, they show some signs of resentment, but, dutifully, church-going Martha builds a bond by agreeing to baby-sit for Rose's two-year-old child, Jesse, while Rose goes out on a date.  A surprise to Martha, Kyle arrives to pick up Rose.  Even more surprising, Jesse's estranged father, Jake (K. Smith), shows up at her apartment angrily contesting some missing merchandise at his place.  It isn't apparent if it is a true accusation or the new date that sets him on a tirade.  After the evening is done, a murder takes place, and it isn't until we reach the very end that it all becomes clear.

`Bubble' is so genuine, particularly with police detectives that seem so true to life.  They're very official, but friendly, yet probing, in a familiar way--not like James Cagney or Dirty Harry.  Stephen Soderbergh sets up the story in the sparest way possible.  (It clocks in at about an hour and a quarter, which is not a flaw.)  In the end, we find murder in all its passion and in all its trivial pursuit.  What makes 'Bubble' so effective is its portrayal of ordinary people who believably act out the inconceivable behind the headlines.",1170979200,5,2190,4.660574412532637
2452619,1,B000C3L2P2,"Going boldly where no film has gone before, BUBBLE was released simultaneously on DVD, cable TV, and in theaters. Many Silver Screen operators ostensibly boycotted the film in protest over this novel marketing approach. I suggest that, perhaps having gotten a sneak peek at the reel, they decided nobody would pay $10 to see it in their auditoriums once word got out, so avoided it like some hemorrhagic fever.

Set in a moribund mid-western town, citizens Martha (Debbie Doebereiner),  Kyle (Dustin Ashley), and Rose (Misty Wilkins) work in a somnolent doll factory. Martha is an unattractive, middle-aged spinster living with Ol' Dad. Kyle, in his irresponsible twenties, is the sort who would benefit immeasurably by a tour with the Marines. Rose is a reasonably attractive single-mother trying to make ends meet. Kyle and Rose start to date for no other apparent reason than they like to take smoke breaks together. One of them is subsequently murdered. Presumably, the crime and its solution are the core of the film's plot, though you wouldn't know it; BUBBLE desultorily dribbles on 45 minutes of its 73-minute run time before the arrival of the police at the crime scene is unexpectedly thrust at the audience. My initial thought was regret that somebody hadn't slaughtered all three.

BUBBLE has been called an ""ultra-low-key drama."" Gee, you think? I've seen more action and heard more scintillating dialogue on Thanksgiving Day as the dysfunctional family sits around in a slack-jawed, glassy-eyed stupor after the festive overindulgence.

The point of BUBBLE is, presumably, to illustrate the stultifying drabness and banality of everyday life, even when it involves a spasm of violence. But I come to that realization every morning when I drag out of bed, clean the cats' litter box, and trudge off to the 9 to 5. When I go to the movies, I want escapism, and it doesn't even have to be of the uber-action, ultra-FX sort. It only needs to be minimally clever and engaging. BUBBLE falls short of that by any creative yardstick imaginable.

BUBBLE isn't worth the postage the Web-based DVD rental company paid for its roundtrip to and from my mailbox. Boy, did they get snookered.",1170115200,,2191,5.008241758241758
2452620,5,B000C3L2P2,"Barely forty years old and with films like Sex, Lies, and Videotape, Ocean's Eleven, Traffic, and Erin Brockovich to his credit, anything director Steven Soderbergh does is worth a look. In this innovative film he moves from directing mega-stars like George Clooney and Julia Roberts to using non-professional, local people as ""actors,"" who participated in the script, to tell a simple, powerful story. The film was set in their homes and made for a measley $1.6 million. In real life Debbie Doebereiner worked at Kentucky Fried Chicken for twenty four years. In the film she stars as Martha, an overweight woman with orange hair whose life consists of working in a doll factory in Parkersburg, West Virginia, and taking care of her invalid father. Her younger co-worker Kyle does not own a car (he lives in a mobile home with his mother), so she taxis him every day, and generally mothers him. The two are joined in the doll factory by Rose (in real life Misty Dawn Wilkins, a hair dresser), a single mom who like Kyle did not finish high school and who works two jobs struggling to get ahead. The night that Martha babysits Rose's daughter so she and Kyle can go on a date ends in tragedy. These extremely ordinary people are trapped in the banalities of life as grey as the Ohio Valley landscape, living on the ""bubble"" that in their case bursts. Bubble also makes history as the first film released simultaneously in theaters, on pay-for-view cable television, and on DVD. I loved this deeply human film.",1169596800,4,1508,4.759541984732825
2452621,1,B000C3L2P2,"Director/Producer Steven Soderbergh has given us some great cinema. From ERIN BROKOVICH to A SCANNER DARKLY, he's been involved in some of the best productions to come out of Hollywood for a little over a decade.

Having heard a few upbeat comments about BUBBLE, one might be tempted to check out Soderbergh's attempt at low-budget filming using no-name actors, a HD camera (not 35mm), and a very short run-time (73 minutes).

Many struggling directors/producers first got into film making via the independent market. Now there seems to be a reversal in where successful directors/producers are looking toward independent cinema to get movies out that are otherwise overlooked by MGM, Paramount, and the other big boys in the industry. There must be a lot of films that never get greenlighted for production. Surely some of them would make excellent movies. And some of them are bypassed for VERY good reasons. Bubble falls into the latter category.

Grass growing. Tepid. Slow. Bland. We've all heard these cliches applied to films and they apply in full measure to Bubble.

One of the biggest problem is that the film is poorly acted. In fact, Debbie Doebereiner, Dustin Ashley, and Misty Wilkins -- the three main actors -- have never taken an acting lesson in their lives. Debbie (who plays Martha) was a regional manager for Kentucky Fried Chicken for 24 years, Dustin (Kyle) was a high school dropout with psychological issues, and Misty (Rose) was a hairstylist. One might think that by hiring no-names the film would take on a sense of authenticity, especially since it was shot in a small mid-western community. Not so. Line delivery is unemotional and flat, as are the scripted characters and the incredibly boring town. This isn't a bashing of the people chosen to ""act"" in this film, as they were obviously ill-prepared for their movie debut. Blame can be squarely placed on the shoulders of whoever cast the film.

The story is supposed to be aptly pulled from the title, Bubble. A bubble is an enclosure surrounded by a tenuous membrane that can easily be popped. Martha (Doebereiner) and Kyle (Dustin) work in a doll making factory and are ""best friends"" according to Martha. Kyle doesn't seem to hold the same attitude but tolerates Martha because she gives him rides to and from work. As a big order for the doll factory comes in, the company hires an attractive new employee named Rose (Misty). A spark of a relationship is seen between Kyle and Rose. Martha is obviously not pleased. This twisted love triangle quickly goes awry as Rose's strangled body is found in her home (Pop! goes the bubble). But did Martha do it?

This is all pretty common ground that's been covered in films for decades. In order to pull off something this well-used one would think that the script might throw us a curve, or perhaps play the characters off one another in a stranger fashion. Again, not so. You've got a scoop of vanilla with no sprinkles on top.

Bad script, bad acting, bad location. Just ...bad.",1164412800,6,3010,4.844357976653696
2452622,2,B000C3L2P2,"Bubble is a unique movie. It is filmed using locals who were interviewed and then hired to star in the movie. Despite what you may think, the movie holds together, sometimes well. The main problem isn't overacting, but generally some of the dialog seems forced and poorly written.

Bubble is the story of 2 factory workers who have a new employee enter and disrupt their world. The script and plot is minimal, but the dialog is plenty.

Dustin James Ashley really stands out and shines in the flick. Despite having no acting experience, Dusty comes off as polished and professional. His performance was always believable, and his dialog was never wooden.

Debbie Doebereiner (as Martha) and Misty Wilkins (as Rose) for the most part do a very good job, but there are many times were you are pulled from your immersion in the film because of clunky dialog. I don't think most of the blame goes to the new actresses, as the script was a little awkward at times. Steven Soderbergh  admits in the special features section that he didn't have a clue about factory life, and for those of us that do, many things in the movie seem off.

And that is the main problem with the movie: everything could have been great, but was a little off. The music was repetitious, and they could have used a better choice. It didn't seem to fit the mood or story. The dialog was a bit off. The acting was a bit off. And the story was a bit boring.

I would recommend seeing Bubble, but I don't think folks who don't appreciate non-Hollywood indy films will care much about it. In the end I think Steven Soderbergh could have paid a greater homage to the rookie actors by surrounding them with a higher degree of quality and detail on all levels. he didn't, and it is Soderbergh who fails in weaving a solid movie. Big love to the actors. With a little more direction there performances could have been spotless.

2452623,5,B000C3L2P2,"BUBBLE is a very polarizing movie.  Those who do not like it will, apparently, argue that it is slow-moving and amateurish.  Those who do like it (like me) will find it not only refreshing, but fascinating.

I say that BUBBLE is refreshing because it is one of the few films that gets its small-town characters right.  The characters in BUBBLE look like real people (probably because Soderbergh selected non-actors for the roles).  It wasn't until after I watched BUBBLE that I realized how artificial most actors/actresses come across when they try to portray ""ordinary"" people.  For instance, although Jennifer Aniston might have done a commendable job with her role in THE GOOD GIRL, she was still unconvincing ... after all, have you ever seen a drug store clerk that looks like Jennifer Aniston?  Even her more homely husband, John C. Reilly, has a certain movie-star quality that your average American lacks.  The actors in BUBBLE, on the other hand, are just right.  They are not without their flaws, yet they are also not toothless, greasy-haired caricatures.  They are simply believable.

The way the characters speak in BUBBLE is also very real.  In almost every other movie, the characters talk like movie characters and not like human beings.  Their slick and witty dialogue is obviously meant to drive the plot along - and not meant to illustrate the way we actually communicate.  BUBBLE, on the other hand, lingers patiently as the characters engage in small-talk.  Some may find this approach boring, but I found it fascinating.  For once, I didn't feel like the dialogue was meant to manipulate or entertain.  There wasn't a false note.

Speaking of false notes, I've noticed that some people have criticized the acting in BUBBLE.  This, I cannot understand.  If affectations and grandiose displays of emotion are good acting, then - no - I suppose this film doesn't contain good acting.  However, I found the acting to be very immediate and natural.  In fact, to me, BUBBLE seemed nearer to a documentary than a film (take the scene where Rose is leaving her daughter for the evening.  Have you ever known a director to illicit such a perfect ""performance"" from a child-actor?).

On a last note, although BUBBLE might seem slow, it is not without plot.  It is a mystery, after all.  It's just that the mystery is handled with subtle elegance and is so much more true-to-life than any other mystery movie.

You may or may not agree with me that this is an incredible movie, but hopefully, if you haven't seen it, you'll at least know after reading this review whether or not you should bother with it.  Let's say this: if you were a fan of Soderbergh's SEX LIES AND VIDEOTAPE, then you should probably give this one a shot.

If you're looking for a carefully constructed, studio-produced movie, BUBBLE doesn't work (try instead Billy Bob Thornton's SLING BLADE, a great marriage between small town life and Hollywood actors).

For me, BUBBLE was entertaining for picking out the locations (I would give this film only one or two stars otherwise).  The bridge over the Ohio River, downtown P-burg, etc.  When a character visits a pawn shop, I remembered the old used bookstore on the corner from the 1970's.

2452646,4,B000C3L2P2,"""Bubble"" does not reinvent the wheel.  Some critics can make the case for ""Citizen Kane"" having done that, but that is not what is happening with Steven Soderbergh's little film.  The idea of sketching out for actors the idea that they need to get from point A to point B to point C, so go ahead and have fun, is not exactly revolutionary.  That was basically what they did with ""The Blair Witch Project.""  Keeping things simple in terms of camera angles and editing is certainly rare today, but not exactly news.  Releasing a movie in the theater and on DVD and pay-per-view cable at the same time might prove to be standard operating procedure in the future, but not in the foreseeable future.  Part of me would like to be able to pick up a copy of a DVD of a movie I really like as I leave the theater, but I also like the fact that now DVDs come out months later when I can get revved up about seeing it again (and again and again).

The focus of this film is on a pair of workers at a doll factory who end up becoming a trio.  Martha (Debbie Doebereiner), is a middle-aged woman who takes care of her infirmed father and drives her young co-worker, Kyle (Dustin James Asheley), to and from work each day.  The two eat lunch together, usually in silence.  Not much happens in the first part of the film except establishing Martha's comfort in the routine of her life.  Then Rose (Misty Dawn Wilkins) is hired on at the factory because she has experience airbrushing.  Rose is a young single mother and she likes to talk, so the work environment is suddenly changed for Martha and Kyle.  Kyle is interested in her, but so shy that he has to wait for Rose to do something about it, namely ask him out on a date.  She gets Martha to baby sit, without mentioning that it is Kyle who is the date and that she intends to be out for a while.  But when the date goes from the bar to Kyle's bedroom what happens is not what we expect.  Neither is the crime that ends up taking place at Rose's apartment.

If you have not been hooked by ""Bubble"" previous to that point, the aforementioned crime should at least get you to sit up and pay attention.  It is not that there is any great mystery about whodunit here, but rather that making all the pieces fit given what we know about these characters requires a bit of recalculation.  Besides, my favorite character in the film is the police detective played by Decker Moody, who is a real cop and who solves the crime the way we would like to think real cops do (which would not be what we see in movies, or on television, and certainly not on ""Cops"").  I can understand how ""Bubbles"" is considered minimalist filmmaking, but I prefer to use the term to denote Moody's performance because that is the one that sets the bar here and leads us to convince ourselves that we might be watching something real here.

At the very least ""Bubble"" is an interesting little film, although I have no doubt many will not be engaged by its leisurely pace and neophyte actors.  But since the film only runs 73 minutes it should not try the patience of too many viewers.  I can compare it to the hyper-reality of a film like ""Domino,"" to name the film that I have seen in the last month that would be at the other end of the cinematic spectrum from this one, and find ""Bubble"" somewhat refreshing.  I do not want all movies to be like this, but then I have no problem liking a lot of different things.  Besides, I would rather come up with the idea that something is an interesting little film after watching it then thinking it is an interesting first draft and coming up with a laundry list of what the filmmakers should have done, which is far too often the case these days.",1141689600,2,3701,4.321273516642547

When the audience was expecting comedy Andy Kaufman would read from The Great Gatsby, or sing 99 Bottles of Beer On The Wall.  This is that kind of joke, where hindsight makes you laugh at yourself for being such a fool as to sit there expecting something more.

Soderbergh and everyone else who is in on this joke are laughing at you if you paid money to watch this tedious, home-video with bad lighting, totally devoid of any drama, humor, or energy.  The acting is of course totally amateur, but that would have been forgivable if there was anything resembling a story.  Technically, Bubble resembles a college student film, but I have seen many student films that are more memorable, more inventive, and more interesting than this ""experiment.""",1140998400,4,957,4.72289156626506
2452650,4,B000C3L2P2,"When I checked out this movie, I had an idea that it was going to be a documentary about working people in Appalachia. And the first scenes supported that view. The movie starts to unfold along the same lines as PBS's recent documentary called ""Country Boys."" It gives the viewer the feel of eavesdroping on real people as they negotiate their lives through the factory, pre-fab, fast food settings of Parkersburg, WV.

It took a while for me to become interested in the laconic lives of these people. Kyle especially seemed a typical boy of the region, trapped in inarticulateness, outside the US mainstream of glib babble. But before I knew it, I was absolutely absorbed by the slow-moving dance of these people. However I realized that this was not a documentary. It is ""partly fact and partly fiction."" As the Bonus Materials on the DVD reveal, some of the actors' real-life back-stories are incorporated into the characters they portray. But it becomes evident that the action is scripted, at least in outline - when there's a murder.

Still, the motives for this murder remain close to home, subtle, and anything but Hollywood. Most Hollywood murder movies involve a ""McGuffin,"" that contrivance that Alfred Hitchcock defined as the necessary motivating force of a film. It's the Maltese falcon, the diamond necklace, the million dollars stolen from a bank vault - that winds up the characters and pits them in action against each other.

There is no McGuffin in this movie. The murder that takes place develops organically, from the low-key dynamic between the three main people in the film. After watching Bubble, I don't think I'll ever again be able to look on the typical Hollywood McGuffin-riddled movies as anything but utterly phony. What's more, having seen this style of true realism, I'll forever after take a more jaundiced view of the usual movies that fly under the label of ""realism."" When the usual Hollywood movie is given that brand, it generally means it is filled with grit and gore and extravagant violence. And that's actually about as far from the way most of us experience daily life as it is possible to get. By contrast, Bubble's realism is true to what most of us experience every day. It's made up of the snubs and small disappointments we are buffeted by every time we interact with others.

The main actors are ideal choices for the roles they play, their actual lives informing the characters they play. The one slightly false note in this ensemble is Jake, the character who comes storming on the scene as Rose's ex-boyfriend. However, even with him we are put back in touch with what is - when we are taken into that actor's actual house, with the graffiti-blasted interior walls of his living room. I have known young men who ""decorated"" their rooms that way.

Then there are the fascinating views of the actual doll factory where much of the film is shot. I can't agree with some people who found these views telling commentaries on the dead-end, deadly jobs that so many people in Appalachia are forced to endure. To the contrary, I actually found myself almost wanting to sign on for a job in that factory. The process of pouring the plastic into the doll molds, extracting the resultant little heads and little limbs, then assembling and giving life-like finishing features to these dolls - was eerie, absorbing, and convivial all at the same time. It seemed like work that requires on-going manual dexterity, but that still leaves you free enough to socialize or think your own thoughts in the doing. Such work seems far more liberating, than say work as a stockbroker.

In summary, if you don't need lots of special effects in your movies - if you would enjoy being a fly on the wall, observing the small-scale drama of people leading their lives - then this is the movie for you. I highly recommend it.",1140220800,4,3849,4.780451127819549

2452662,2,B000C3L2P2,"""Bubble"" is director Steven Soderbergh's flight of fancy from all things Hollywood, the first of a 6-part series of films that are to be site-specific and cast with nonprofessional actors from the areas represented in the films. Written by Coleman Hough, ""Bubble"" takes place within a depressed working class community in a small Ohio town. Martha (Debbie Doebereiner), a middle-aged woman who cares for her elderly father, works in a doll factory with good friend Kyle (Dustin Ashley), an uneducated young man who works 2 jobs to save a little money. When the factory hires Rose (Misty Wilkins), an attractive and manipulative single mother, an awkward triangle emerges: Rose doesn't hesitate to impress upon Martha's generosity or to flirt with Kyle, of whom Martha is protective and a little possessive.

Using amateur actors and naturalistic settings is nothing new. Italian neo-realists and their many imitators were fond of the idea. Third-world directors commonly rely on local casts. Even Hollywood went through a phase in the 1940s when non-professional actors got supporting roles in docudramas. Amateur casts often produce excellent results. But not here. Most of the acting in ""Bubble"" is bad. It's hard to say if the actors lack talent. Steven Soderbergh placed them in a situation in which even professional actors would not succeed. They didn't have a real script. A lot of their conversations are ad-libbed. It's flat. Script-less dialogue has been done ad nauseum in cinema, always with bad results. Misty Watkins does manage to express Rose's brattiness and insincerity in spite of aimless, sparse dialogue. Kyle Smith is also convincing in the small role of Rose's ex-boyfriend Jake. Generally, the acting improves as the film progresses, but that only draws attention to how bad it was to begin with.

To make matters worse, the actors didn't have the benefit of competent framing and lighting. ""Bubble"" is shot on grainy DV. Shadows are blocked up, highlights blown out. Soderbergh was either unable or unwilling to adjust the white balance, so odd color casts abound. The framing is either haphazard or deliberately chosen to draw attention to itself, as opposed to directing our attention to the action on the screen. The director apparently chose not to move anything on the sets, which are real locations, so the lighting is terrible. Actors' faces are immersed in shadow when we need to see them. Steven Soderbergh calls this ""challenging and provocative"". It's incompetent. I guess he thinks a film with no script, no production design, and bad cinematography somehow resembles real life. Nothing could be further from the truth. It takes a whole lot of artifice to create something that looks real in a movie. The human eye and brain do not perceive the way film or DV do. We see a much wider tonal range, much more detail in shadows and highlights. Our brain adjusts for color casts in different light sources. Our eyes focus on what we care about. Our memories are selective. Et cetera. ""Bubble"" looks like crap.

I recall discussing -in a film class many years ago- how a filmmaker might make the audience aware of the contrivance and manipulation of a film as they are watching it. There is no practical reason to do this, but it is an intellectual exercise. After watching a variety of films from conventional continuous narratives to the most outrageously self-conscious things I hope to ever see, the class inevitably concluded that the audience accepts what it sees as part and parcel of the film's style. The only way to draw the audience's attention to how they are being jerked around would be to make an obvious mistake. Fake mistakes never work. In the thousands of films I've seen since then, I've never seen a film that succeeded in doing that until ""Bubble"". Soderbergh has the arrogance to reject the fact that filmmaking is a craft, with predictable results. If you rejected craftsmanship in making a vase, you would end up with an ugly, useless lump of pottery that leaks. It's inept. So is ""Bubble"". But it sure did draw my attention to what its director is trying to cram down my throat. If that were what Steven Soderbergh intended, I would congratulate him.

A lot is being made of ""Bubble"" being the first film to be released in multiple formats simultaneously. It was released theatrically, on cable, and on DVD at the same time. If films that have limited distribution could be released simultaneously on DVD without eliminating too much theatrical revenue, it would save movie studios a lot of money. I commend Magnolia Films for trying it, but ""Bubble"" is not a good test subject. It's not technically proficient enough, or long enough, to be a theatrical film. It can't make money at the box office, DVD or no DVD. Personally, I think Steven Soderbergh sold Magnolia a bill of goods, but, whatever the case, Mark Cuban and Todd Wagner are going to have to find a better test case.

The DVD (Magnolia 2006): Bonus features include 3 featurettes, a deleted scene with alternate ending (6 min), ""Bubble Still Gallery"" of behind-the-scenes photos, a theatrical trailer (1  min), and 2 audio commentaries. In ""Bursting the Bubble: The Real Lives of the Actors"" (11 min), screenwriter Coleman Hough introduces us to the 3 priniciple actors in Parkersburg, West Virginia. This is one of the most condescending things I've ever seen. ""Finding the Cast"" is lengthy interviews with Dustin Ashley (10 min), Debbie Doebereiner (7 min), and Misty Wilkins (6 min), in which the actors talk about their real lives. ""HDNet's Higher Definition: Highlights from the Interview with Steven Soderbergh"" (9  min) is an interview with Soderbergh by Robert Wilonsky about his 6-picture deal and the ideas behind ""Bubble"". There is an audio commentary by Steven Soderbergh and Mark Romanek (who is also a director), in which Soderbergh talks about working with non-professional actors, stylistic choices, and his perspective on this project. Another audio commentary features Dustin Ashley, Debbie Doebereiner, Misty Wilkins, and Coleman Hough. The actors talk about learning how the film unfolds as they went along, the direction that Soderbergh gave them, and their experiences making the movie.

2452663,4,B000C3L2P2,"One of the first shots in Bubble shows gravestones huddled around two American flags. The death of the American dream would be all but played out in art, if it wasn't so relevant all the time.

Bubble begins with Martha and Kyle who work at a doll factory in a Southern Ohio town. Kyle lives with his mom and works two jobs to get by. Martha goes home to her bed ridden father she refuses to put into a nursing home. When a new factory worker, Rose, is hired a love triangle forms between the three. I wouldn't go so far as to say that Martha has romantic feelings for Kyle, but she does become jealous when her only friend starts taking smoke breaks with someone else. The monotony of the small town is broken up-ever so slightly-by the murder of one of the factory workers.

Bubble has gotten more press for its release strategy than for the film itself. It is being released in theatres and on DVD simultaneously. I have been on record as saying that I oppose this business model because it will hurt the theatre owners and continue the growing trend of people avoiding the movie theatres altogether. Although, I did see this on DVD because no one wanted to see this movie with me. Fine, I'm a hypocrite, so sue me (I'm in law school so I feel perfectly safe saying you can sue me, because I'm reasonably certain hypocrisy is not remedied by law).

What is more interesting than the business model is the experimental nature of the film. The director, Stephen Soderbergh, uses all digital film, actually shot the film in Ohio, and uses non-actors. The result is largely successful.

Each character seems numb. They blindly go through their daily routine unaware that anything exists outside of their job and the small circle of people they know. Kyle and Rose are probably in their mid-twenties-about the time when the feedom of teenage years quickly gives way to an ever decreasing number of options. Martha is at least forty, and has long given up thinking about life outside of the town. When Rose says that she wants to get away, Martha asks why with a puzzled look on her face.

The characters in Bubble show almost no emotion, even when the murder occurs. They're completely closed off. A part of that numbness transfers to the viewer, and it does become a little difficult to care about what happens to them. Maybe that's the point of the film, but it also subdues some of the emotional resonance.

I went to college in a city in Southern Ohio so this film had a little more impact on me. It was odd living on a campus where the springtime landscapers made certain every flower and blade was just right, while the city around us looked like it was crumbling. There's a lot of Ohio that feels as if all the brick and mortar has been torn down leaving only a steel skeleton. In Springfield, Ohio, where I lived, certain areas of the city had rows of large mansions that were either vacant or carved into separate apartments by a landlord. You could tell that the whole city collapsed when the factory jobs were shut down and eventually sent over seas.

Because it was filmed in Ohio, Bubble does a great job of showing the flat landscape littered with barely running factories or barely standing houses. It's a film that's actually concerned with places that aren't on one of the coasts. While I have no evidence to back this up, perhaps one of the reasons Hollywood is taking a hit is because people finally want to see themselves or people they know up on the screen. The average person gets enough fiction from the daily news, and the public wants to see something real from today's artists. This doesn't always mean a documentary (although documentaries and non-fiction literature are immensely popular these days), but it does mean that books, movies, and television will have to start viewing the world through the eyes of the average American.",1139356800,3,3858,4.598837209302325

The music was also annoying and distracting at parts.  This is a very short movie as well.  I was genuinely suprised when it ended.

The only other indie coming close to its perfection is Tim Blake Nelson's Eye Of God another film to seek out exploring similiar themes of detachment and loneliness in a small American town.  I was blown away by pretty much everything about it.  It is perfect and my mind and a testament to the powers of independent filmmmaking (it was shot on digital was made on a budget of 1 million dollars - small change in comparison to budgets of most hollywood films).  The script by Coleman Hough (Full Frontal) is amazing and the acting by the actress playing the role of ""Martha"" is in my humble opinion one of the great performances in recent cinema.

2452666,4,B000C3L2P2,"In a small town on the Ohio and West Virgina border, Martha and Kyle work together at the local doll factory.  Martha is a middle-aged, unmarried woman who lives with her infirmed father and takes care of him.  Kyle is an unfocused young man, who never finished high school and still lives with his mom in the local trailer park.  Martha and Kyle are ""friends.""  Martha picks Kyle up for work everyday, and she even drives him to his other job at the shovel factory in the same town.  Everything is normal until the doll factory hires a new worker.  The new worker, Rose, is a single mother around Kyle's age.  Rose and Kyle become good friends, and even go out on a date together.  All of these incidents come together to lead to tragic consequences about halfway through the film.

Bubble is really an odd, intense film.  The character of Martha seems to paint a picture of a life of pointlessness, loneliness, and sadness.  Martha obviously thinks more of her relationship with Kyle than he does.  Their conversations are never complicated, and are filled with plenty of awkward silences.  In fact, the silences are some of the best parts of Bubble.  All the conversations feel completely real.  Maybe it was Steven Soderbergh's choice to use non-actors for the film's main roles, or maybe it was the writing, but either way, the film feels very normal and realistic.

Some people would argue that nothing actually happens for the first 40 minutes of the film; and they would be right.  The first 40 minutes consist mostly of talks between Martha and Kyle, and silent shots of Martha going about her pathetic, lonely existence in the small town.  However, once the murder happens, the film becomes much more interesting on a more normal level of film entertainment.  I personally enjoyed the entire film, which runs a very short length of about 75 minutes.

Obviously, the point of the film isn't the mystery.  It's more about life in this small, poor town, where no one can seem to get out and make a good life for themselves.  Martha's father is still there.  Kyle's mother is still there.  Rose's ex-boyfriend is still there.  And when all their lives intersect for that one night, there are terrible consequences.  I really enjoyed the film, but I don't think I'd watch it again, and normal filmgoers will probably not enjoy the slow, deliberate pacing and lack of action.

Since these are untrained actors, seeing this difference helps fill in the questions you'll have after watching the film.

You may walk away thinking you haven't seen much at all. Once you reach this conclusion-- the light bulb should turn on.

There may be an intriguing movie lurking in the mundane personal lives of minimum-wage drones at a small town doll factory-- but this plodding descent into banality doesn't even come close. Ennui has rarely been as dull.

The performances (all by game non-professionals, who were unwisely encouraged to improvise their lines) are so  amateurish they're almost funny.

Rest of the dazed-looking cast look like they're slogging through their brain-dead paces on Thorazine.

Near-plotless ""story"" (culminating in what is quite possibly the snooziest murder mystery in film history) ends as abruptly as it is introduced, like those old Warhol films where the movie suddenly ends just because the camera had run out of film.

What isn't there in the conversations they have at lunch or on dates or anywhere else in their day is what makes the the film so sad, and while the performances may not work as well in any, they work perfectly here.  I could just imagine this movie with Jennifer Aniston, Kathy Bates (yes, the one overweight actress everyone thinks of), and Jake Gyllenhaal.  I could imagine it being quite good, but not this good.

With these actors, there is no facade that a traditional Hollywood actor uses.  There's something really sad in those eyes that stare back at us at the end.  And I'm not saying these people live sad, meaningless lives in real life, but they probably know how it can feel.  It's like the difference between hearing about a battle from a war historian and a soldier recently returned from the trenches.

The non professional actors (which Soddy emphasized all the time in interviews as if that makes him ""innovative') are terrible, and it's not because they're non professional.  It's because they are not interesting people.  The Bicycle Thief used non professionals, but they were good.  And the film really isn't a ""depiction of small town life"", it's really just a smug hipsterish movie mocking small town folks.  Reportedly the budget for this was 1.5 million dollars.

They were pulled in off the streets where the film takes place and dropped into roles that didn't veer too far from their actual lives.  And it works.  Every scene feels real from start to finish because it never felt like these people were acting.  Which makes sense as this was largely an improvisational project shot under the muse of some fairly humble cinematography.  Martha was convincing and a bit creepy, Kyle the typical mumbling introvert, and Rose was oddly seductive in the way morose, chain-smoking single moms can sometimes be.  It was all very honest.  So that's win.

I also really liked the factory footage.  It was interesting and eerie to watch the doll scenes and I'd recommend checking the film out for that alone.  It doesn't occupy a huge chunk of the film, but when it does it works very well.  The pouring of the rubber, the small trays of hands and face molds - it was all great and reminded me a bit of something the Quay Brothers would put together were they sane.  But perhaps I've painted an adequate picture for you.  It had that look.

Sadly, however, the plot never quite pulled me under and that's why I'm dropping it to three stars.  As I mentioned before, the dialogue and casting made the film feel real, but I think the story itself could have used some spice.  As mentioned in the case synopsis, there's a murder, but it's falsely advertised calling, ""into question our established assumptions about these characters and life in their small town.""  This is of course only my opinion, but I never really felt like I needed to question ANYTHING that was presented here.  The incident happened, I knew immediately who did it, and then spent the rest of the movie hoping it would delve into something profound to make up for not surprising me with anything new.  But that never happened.

And I don't want anyone thinking I walked into this needing some blistering crescendo of a movie because that's not true.  I love quieter films.  I just think this one could have used something special.  Perhaps it needed to be graphic just once, for just a moment, something SHARP...

I don't regret buying Bubble, but I think I'd have felt better had I only rented it.  The replay value for me just isn't quite where it needs to be.

And I thank you for your time.

8095537,5,B000C3L2P2,"This is my wife's,and my,favorite film in recent years. Soderbergh has made an experimental movie that is a true gem. There aren't any professional actors,yet the performances are striking. Mainly,it is a depiction of how murders in small towns can happen without evil premeditation(especially relevent in today's America).This movie gives a thoughtful insight into how regular people can be caught up in misplaced passion,and how that passionate energy can take an awful turn. After watching this,you will wonder why you've not heard of it before,but be pleased you know about it now. Do your friends a favor by sharing the experience with them. Watch ""Bubble"",not ""Ocean's 13"".",1360800000,4,679,5.355140186915888
8095538,1,B000C3L2P2,I would review this movie but it arrived in a broken case and the dvd was scratched beyond recognition. It stopped playing within the first 5 minutes because of the damage.,1327968000,,172,4.580645161290323
8095539,4,B000C3L2P2,"I enjoyed Bubble, inasmuch as it was short and interesting. The non-pro actors were fine, and it was a decent character study. My question is: The trailer for the film featured an amazing piece of music and I'll go crazy if I don't find out what it is. (The trailer music is not in the film itself.) Any help out there?

UPDATE (1-16-12): YAY! That music is from Prokofiev's ballet ROMEO AND JULIET, Act 2 (The Duel). Great stuff!",1298160000,,430,4.443037974683544
8095540,4,B000C3L2P2,"This is a MUCH better film than some of the reviews would have you believe.  It is a fascinating look at an element of American society that is virtually ignored by the movies.  And that it is done by non-professionals and largely ad-libbed makes it quite remarkable.  The editing is outstanding and the movie is never boring.  The only problem is the ending, which is simultaneously over dramatic and totally lacking in drama.  I think it will provide valuable insights into life in America at this time for future generations.",1255392000,,528,4.822222222222222

""Bubble"" concerns three employees in a small doll factory in a small mid-west town.  Co-workers Martha (Debbie Doebereiner) and Kyle (Dustin Ashley) have known each other for awhile.  Martha is overweight and fortyish, looking like a less comedic Roseanne Barr; Kyle is in his early 20s, still lives at home, and is fairly emo.  They seem like an unlikely pair, but it's mostly a friendship born of convenience working and commuting together to the doll factory.  They are not happy people; they're struggling to pay their bills and rarely smile.  Martha also seems fonder of Kyle than he is of her.  In one painful scene, Martha and Kyle stop for breakfast, and Martha says that she wants a picture of Kyle because he's her best friend.  One senses that this friendship will probably not end well.  Speeding things along is their new co-worker, Rose (Misty Wilkins).  She has a two-year-old daughter and, as soon as she befriends Martha and Kyle, makes Martha feel like a third wheel.  Ruh-roh!

The movie made news in 2006 by being nearly simultaneously released in theaters, on cable, and on DVD.  Many critics wrote it off a digital stunt, but it's worth a look.  Steven Soderbergh has long been one of the most experimental of the major American movie directors.  In particular, he has specialized in incorporating handheld video equipment into his movies (see ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape"" and ""Full Frontal"").  Here, he takes the next logical step by making a truly minimalist film - shot on digital tape, with non-professional actors and a mostly improvised script.  The movie is slow-moving and self-conscious, but it also captures a realness not seen in most films.  It also shows a side of America not often focused on - average people living average, boring lives.  There's nothing inherently interesting about them, but somehow the film makes their mini-psychodrama something greater and deeper.",1224288000,2,2002,4.975903614457831
