1902211,1,B0000A2ZPZ,"Just saw a pre-release copy of this last night. It was all the six of us who watched it could do to see the whole thing. Some problems:
1. Jimmy's apartment is described as being in need of cleaning up and also called a dump. What you see on screen is an immaculate apartment that most would love to have. At least have your production designer read the script to see what the apartment is supposed to look like.
2. Technical problems include shoddy blocking, continuity problems during cuts, crossing the imaginery 180 line, and amateurish camera work.
3. Ok, the first two were picky things, but the biggest problem is this movie falls flat on it's face. Attempts at humor fail, characters are not believable, the story is not engaging.
I never saw the stage production but my hunch is it MUST have been better than this movie. I suspect much was lost in the adaptation. This one is not even worth renting.",1060041600,2,908,4.5426829268292686
1902212,4,B0000A2ZPZ,"James Kirkwood's 1972 cult novel  ""P.S. Your Cat is Dead"" is indeed a far-out choice of a story to enjoy resurrection in 2003, and it certainly was an interesting project for actor Steve Guttenberg (""Police Academy"", ""Can't Stop the Music"") to choose for his directorial debut. The book was adapted into a successful stage play in 1975, with the late great Sal Mineo (""Rebel Without a Cause"") starring in the San Francisco production as the bisexual cat burglar.  At that time, the inclusion of a main character in a play who was unapologetically gay or bisexual was considered ""daring"".  Today, aside from any residual shock value in terms of the characters' sexuality, what endures in ""PS. Your Cat is Dead"" is a twisted, funny, and ultimately emotional story of two troubled men: Jimmy Zoole, a frustrated, unsuccessful actor/writer (Steve Guttenberg); and a bisexual Latino cat burglar named Eddie (Lombardo Boyar).  Thanks to an updating of the setting to contemporary L.A., and a successful translation from stage to screen, ""P.S. Your Cat is Dead"" emerges as the most unique tale of male bondage-- uh... I mean, bond-ING-- to emerge since Brad Pitt and Edward Norton beat the hell out of each other in 1999's ""Fight Club"".
  In ""P.S. Your Cat is Dead"", we meet our two leads as well as other quirky characters throughout the course of New Year's Eve. Steve Guttenberg is just perfect as the scruffy, pushing-40, so-pathetic-it's-funny artist Jimmy, who-- to put it mildly-- isn't looking back at the past year with too many fond memories.  His girlfriend Kate is leaving him for another man.  His apartment has been burglarized twice, and one of the items stolen was his only handwrtitten copy of his long-gestating book-in-progress. His attempt at 'avant garde' (""That's French for 'can't sell tickets'!"", he bemoans.) theater-- specifically, a production of ""Hamlet"" with puppets-- has failed miserably.  To top it off, his beloved cat Tennessee is at the animal hospital, gravely ill.  After his ex-girlfriend storms out of his apartment following a humorously nasty fight, Jimmy discovers that a 20-something burglar (Lombardo Boyar) has broken into his home and is hiding under his bed.  But Eddie the burglar-- who's also a hustler and performance artist with some serious emotional issues-- is in for a challenge.  The fed-up Jimmy progresses from initial discontent to full-blown hysteria... and some mild sadistic traits come out as well! He knocks Eddie unconscious, hog-ties his home invader to the kitchen table, and at one point cuts the seat out of Eddie's pants.  As the tense night progresses, the two men play assorted psychological games with each other, with a bare-assed Eddie trying to push Jimmy's buttons (at one point, by gay-baiting him), and Jimmy in turn taunting his prisoner (at one point, by feeding him cat food!). The last draw comes when Jimmy discovers a note left by his Kate which bears the movie's titular bad news: ""PS. Your cat is dead.""  Needless to say, this nearly pushes our frazzled underdog over the edge.
  The dynamics between Guttenberg and Boyar help us forget that in ""P.S. Your Cat is Dead"", we're watching what's essentially a two-character play-- with one of the characters spending most of the time face down, tied up on a kitchen table. Filmed plays, as we all know, don't always work; the effect can be claustrophobic and stagy. (Remember 1996's ""Faithful"" with a tied-up Cher?). However, in ""P.S. Your Cat is Dead"", a few unique directorial touches as well as some surprises keep the movie going.  One of the surprises comes when a trio of gay roughnecks drop by Jimmy's apartment and mistakenly interpret the kitchen table scene as a bondage party.  Strapping A.J.Benza plays Jimmy's hypersexed friend Carmine-- sort of a gay, ultra-flamboyant (makeup and all!) version of the thuggish persona that Benza displays as host of the E! ""Mysteries and Scandals"" TV show. His character is definitely NOT the kind of guy you'd want to meet at a club if you'd had too much to drink!
  By the end of ""P.S.Your Cat is Dead"", both Jimmy and Eddie have undergone some level of catharsis, and the ending-- dare I say it-- is surprisingly sweet.  But rest assured: until you reach that point, there will be plenty of hysterics, tension, scenery chewing, and black comedy to enjoy!  In what might be a cinematic first, Guttenberg runs the closing credits of  ""P.S. Your Cat is Dead"" with video footage of the movie's entire crew, to the well-chosen song ""Crystal Blue Persuasion"" by Culture Club.
  Looking forward to Steve Guttenberg's next directorial project!",1043107200,11,4612,4.997385620915033
1902223,3,B0000A2ZPZ,rather a fan of steve guttenberg but as a comedy i thought it lacked comedy bordering on silly guess just not my cup of tea,1362873600,,123,3.96
1902224,1,B0000A2ZPZ,"Please don't watch this movie. It will turn you off to the great writing of James Kirkland. If you read the book and watched this movie you'll know what I mean. It's an insult to James Kirkland. I agree with most of the other one star ratings - no need to write it over and over.

I'd been hoping to see this book turned into a movie since I was a young teenager, when I first read the book. Like millions of others I've read it more than once. I've read it so many times the book is worn out. I was hoping to see Sal Mineo perform it on stage, but he was taken from us by a crazed junky. This movie would have been fantastic with Mineo or a younger Dustin Hoffman (heck, Hoffman can still do it) as the burgular.

I really do hope someone tries again to make a movie from the book, staying true to the book in every way - if the next person who makes this movie deliberately sets it in the 70s (cars, clothes, attitudes and all) then it can stay true to the book 100% and will be great!

I know just about everyone who has ever read a book that went to film has bad things to say about the movie version, but this time it's 1000% true, the movie is not worth watching. Sorry Steve.",1336176000,,1182,4.0

1902226,1,B0000A2ZPZ,"Steve Guttenberg is such a whiney mess in this movie.  It has absolutely none of the charm of the original book.  James Kirkwood would turn over in his grave if he knew what Guttenberg did to his play/book!

The book is one of the funniest things ever written.  The movie is painful to watch and destroys the book.  If you must watch the movie, make sure that you read the book first!  The movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities.",1215648000,2,434,4.430379746835443
1902227,1,B0000A2ZPZ,"As a gay friendly movie, this could be an excellent choice. If I had bought this movie for that reason, I think I might have been very happy... but I didn't.

I bought this film because I have enjoyed reading the book so many times that my old copy is completely worn out. I was hoping to have a good laugh after a bad day at work when I spied this flick at a local video store, but I wasn't prepared for this.

I expected a little modernization on the original story, which I was ready to be disapointed by, but I didn't expect the burglar's nationality to be changed. A bisexual italian burglar would have been a great character, but he has been changed to a latino in the film. The drug related scenes that always had me giggling in the book have been toned down (and changed as well) in a big way. Some of the good parts are still good, but not as many as they should have been.

To conclude this review... if the movie had been made in the 70's, it would have been great... but what the director felt that he had to do to keep up with current times was deplorable. This is a DVD that just collects dust in my collection now.",1142467200,3,1129,4.122727272727273
1902228,5,B0000A2ZPZ,"I must admit, I had low expectations of the film. After reading mixed reviews, many from purist fans having a good old lash-out, I bought the film hoping i'd find something in it to enjoy. Well, paint me green and call me Gumby - this turned out to be one of the most enjoyable films I have seen in years.

The onscreen chemistry between Steve Guttenberg and Lombardo Boyar is superb, and a vitally important element considering the homoerotic content. I do wonder why the writers chose not to place enough emphasis on their eventual relationship - they ended up in bed together in the play. Nonetheless, the film chugs on nicely without resorting to bedroom scenes...by the end of the film, the shift in their relationship is as clear as day. The foundations are there for the viewer to build on.

The script itself is well-written, punchy and poignant in just the right places. The first twenty minutes seemed a little slow, compared to the pace of everything that follows. Perhaps the introduction will seem slow only to first-time viewers, in which case I urge you to pay attention, as the information will keep popping up as the film progresses.

The supporting characters, namely Cynthia Watros as Kate and A.J. Benzo as Carmine, are smartly cast. Given their limited screen time and character development, they bring an undeniable spark to what easily could have been boring, almost loathsome roles.

I had a ball watching P.S. Your Cat Is Dead. It is definitely worth your time to find this film. Be sure to check out the commentary on the DVD, which had me in absolute stitches!",1139011200,4,1587,4.739130434782608
1902229,1,B0000A2ZPZ,"After having seen how three of Kirkwood's best works (""Some Kind of Hero"", ""A Chorus Line"", and ""P.S. Your Cat is Dead"") have been so unkindly treated in their big screen adaptations--or perhaps I should say, their ""straight to video"" adaptations--I can only come to one conclusion:  There must be a post-mortem cinematic adaptation jinx attached to him!  I've been spared--up until now--a viewing of ""There Must Be a Pony"", which I can only assume is as dismal as the aforementioned three, and my hope is that another Steve Guttenburg (or Steve Guttenburg himself, for that matter) abstains from bringing the world his own particular vision of ""Good Times/Bad Times"".  Maybe the things which we originally found so fresh and daring about Kirkwood have lost their bite; maybe filmmakers haven't had the correct sensibility when they have approached it. Whatever the reason, I've had it! The thought that his works will be most enduringly remembered by these mediocre films--because after all, who reads books anymore?--disgusts and depresses me.

I'd seen Steve Guttenberg on a talk show quite a while ago discussing his having made this film, and was really looking forward to it.  I'm sorry now.  Within an hour of watching this dreck, I was curled up with the book again - just to put the shine back on the memory.  Please, save yourself the time and money...  but the book - NOT the movie.",1105660800,5,477,4.2444444444444445
1902231,1,B0000A2ZPZ,"P.S. Your Cat is Dead should be hilariously funny.  It should be poignantly touching.  The film version of the same is neither.
Steve Guttenburg, who both stars and directs this film is to be commended for making a film that most would not bother putting to celluloid.  Unfortunately, he needs someone to provide him with better direction and someone to provide better pacing of the film.
The basic premise is that Jimmy Zool is a poor jerk who has just lost his girlfriend, his job, his cat is in the vet, and his apartment has just been robbed - for the 3rd time!  Life can't get much worse can it?  Enter the robber for another return visit.  Caught in the act, the robber is forced to undergo humiliations at the hands of Jimmy.  Eventually the two come to terms with each other and learn to actually not only like each other but realize there may be something more in the offing.
Guttenburg plays Jimmy as a sad sack with little or no likable characteristics.  The character is supposed to merely be the victim of a series of bad incidences.  He's feeling pretty low.  Unfortunately, Guttenburg's Jimmy is morose and not likable at all.  Also, he wears this tragically unattractive facial expression throughout most of the film that is supposed to pass for sadness - not an emotion that is one that Jimmy is really dealing with - it's more deeply felt than just that.
The fellow who plays the robber is at least refreshing in his role, though I feel that he's playing it a bit too light heartedly. (You see, I've directed the stage version of this play).  This is the role that Sal Mineo was playing at the time of his murder - I doubt that the talented Mineo would have played him quite as flippant on the whole.
My last, and probably biggest qualm with this film is that Guttenburg has chosen to avoid the entire subject of the romantic involvement that happens with Jimmy and the Robber.  Heck, they end up in bed together at the end of the play!  This is a subtle piece of characterization that happens as Jimmy realizes that maybe he's been going at things in his life all wrong.  Instead, Guttenburg plays this as though the two men, although one is gay, simply become friends.  Since one of the men is laid face down and naked from the waist down (in the play - not in this film) on the kitchen sink for most of the action, it is doubtful that a simple friendship is all that would come out of this encounter.  It is also doubtful that anything truly meaningful with come of the encounter, but it is likely that somehting poignant and life changing will come of it for Jimmy.  THAT is the message that the play provides.  It is NOT the message that the film gets across.
I love this play and the book on which it was based.  I don't love this film - and I really wanted to.",1089158400,24,2785,4.40234375
1902232,1,B0000A2ZPZ,"Unlike the reviewers who had read the book and perhaps thereby gained the strength to stick with this lugubrious film, I came upon it naively at Blockbuster.  I want to disclose at the outset that I couldn't watch the entire DVD and had to turn it off after about an hour, so maybe I missed something profound.  I suffered miserably through the first hour hoping that it would redeem itself, but the principal character is so thoroughly unpleasant, both in the way the part is written and the acting, that it was sheer torture.  The supporting cast was more appealing, but the pace of the film was excruciatingly slow, the attempts at humor repeatedly fell flat, and since nearly all the action took place in the main character's apartment, the result was unrelieved claustrophobia.  All of which left me with a whopping case of renter's remorse -- life is too short to waste watching films like this, even if you live to 100!",1083024000,3,926,4.662576687116564
1902243,3,B0000A2ZPZ,"I rented this as Sal was starring in the hit play shortly before his murder, which is now this film, and I was curious. I am impressed! Lombardo Boyer plays the role Sal was playing, and gave me an idea of what Sal's performance was like in the play. I am pretty certain this was better as a play. But worth the watch.",1082246400,2,318,4.063492063492063
1902244,2,B0000A2ZPZ,"Jimmy Zoole is having a bad streak of luck.  He's been robbed twice in the past three months, his best friend died, his girlfriend broke up with him on New Year's Eve, and his cat is dead.  Things are about to change when the burglar breaks into his apartment again and gets caught by Jimmy.
Steve Guttenberg's directing debut is a margianl film at best.  The action takes place so fast that there doesn't seem to be enought time to get to know the characters.  Shirley Knight does a good job as Jimmy's Aunt Claire, and Lombardo Boyar plays Eddie Tesoro, the burglar, very well.  But, anyone who has read the book or viewed the play will be disappointed with some of the character and scene changes.  The humor of the book is missing, as well.
The DVD does contain an okay commentary, some behind-the-scenes footage and an alternate ending.",1075248000,3,841,4.573333333333333

The usually charming Steve Guttenberg is annoying beyond belief. Sadly, his directing debut is even worse. Pacing is agonizingly slow, editing is all wrong. The apartment, which is described in the film's own dialogue as a dump, is gorgeous. The whole thing makes no sense. Only my fond memories of the book kept me watching to the end, hoping against hope it would get better. It never did. The best thing in the movie is A. J. Benza as the would-be rapist Carmine. During his two brief scenes the screen pulses with energy. You know you're in trouble when the best thing in the movie is the rapist.",1074816000,12,725,4.541984732824427

His best friend has died, his girlfriend has dumped him, his puppet play has flopped, his cat is in the hospital and his apartment is being used as a discount department store by a local burglar.  It's New Year's Eve and Jimmy is at the end of his rope.  Thus, we are introduced to the main character from James Kirkwood's (A Chorus Line) novel.
Jimmy is dour and sullen, a little too smart for his own good but not smart enough to play the game.  A Victim.  He's not a sympathetic character and you can't help snickering at him, at points.  But, when he captures a burglar in the act of burgling his apartment, he transforms from victim to conqueror and it looks like Jimmy has totally gone off the deep end!
This film has some very funny, laugh out loud moments, some parts that are a bit slow and some sections which leave you with your mouth open, in disbelief.  The special features section of this DVD includes commentary by Guttenberg, interviews, and trailers, as well as an alternate ending.
On it own merits, P.S. Your Cat is Dead is an entertaining story, if, however you are looking for a ""by the book"" adaptation, you may be disappointed.",1069113600,3,1227,4.495495495495495
1902247,4,B0000A2ZPZ,"PS YOUR CAT IS DEAD was almost as important a book and play as CATCHER IN THE RYE when it was created in the 1970s.  For those legions of us who loved both book and Kirkwood's own adaptation as a play, this new film, for all its flaws, conjures up many great memories and many sad elegies.  The film is in the hands of actor/director Steve Gutenberg and his touch is just too heavy handed to do the work justice.  As is often the case, when the main actor is also the director and worse, when the character acted is prone to extremes of behavior, then who is left to tighten the reins on the over all piece?  Gutenberg takes practically the whole movie to make us care and warm to him, so whining, screaming and self-indulgent is his portrayal.  The best part of the film is the very sensitive work of Lombardo Boyar as the burglar.  He manages to touch on almost every aspect of this complicated character and is never less than entertaining and sympathetic.
Despite the shortcomings of this film, author Kirkwood still shines as a sensitive observer of the human condition, of the panorama of sexuality, and as master of the short quip.  It is to Gutenberg's credit that he dedicated this film to Kirkwood and to Sal Mineo (both deceased now) who played the burglar in an early form of the play.  THAT brings back a lot of memories worth holding.",1067385600,9,1348,4.451219512195122

1902250,4,B0000A2ZPZ,"James Kirkwood once described his play as ""a little kinky dinky.""
Over 30 years ago, when it first appeared, indeed it was quite a
shock for audiences. Rather than maintain its contemporary 1970 look, Guttenberg's version updates: instead of cold New York City, we have hot L.A. on New Year's Eve. Instead of a crude Italian cat burglar, we have a Latino version. That the changes update, but do not alter the original intent may be testimony to the basic symbols that Kirkwood used in his catty, semi-autobiographical tale. The author also once noted that, once the original is sold to another, the story belongs to them. From that view, Guttenberg has done much that ought to be complimented, esp. the casting of Lombardo Boyer as the burglar. Casting himself as a Woody Allen sort on steroids was not the best move. Jimmy Zoole was meant to be charming and likeable, even under adverse conditions. On stage Keir Dullea conveyed that. As played by Steve Guttenberg, the character of Jimmy Zoole  does not become likeable at all. As a former actor, Jimmy Kirkwood wrote characters that actors could play with elan...and nearly every performer has that chance to shine. Guttenberg is to be commended for finally bringing Kirkwood's story to the screen. The road to becoming a film was cursed; it had so many false starts, including the murder of Sal Mineo who was to direct the original film and star, as he rehearsed the play in Los Angeles. Jim Kirkwood himself intended to direct a film version as late as 1988. For Kirkwood's legion of fans, the film is a welcome renewal of Kirkwood's work; for others, it may be just another cult film.",1062115200,7,1641,4.757894736842105
1902251,1,B0000A2ZPZ,"P.S. Your Cat Is Dead is dedicated to the playwright James Kirkwood and the late actor Sal Mineo (who was preparing to open the play in Los Angeles when he was murdered). Kirkwood published his comic play as a novel in the early 70s and it was quite popular and, at the time, very risque. Today, however, it appears quite mild and dated with subjects like bisexuality pass'e.
The film, however, doesn't just suffer from being dated - it is badly paced, has terrible continuity problems and is just plain boring. And for a film like this to work, the audience must connect with the characters and care about them. Lombardo Boyer is funny as the burglar but Guttenberg's character comes across as a disheveled ranting and raving lunatic and is irritating beyond belief. It's hard to imagine his ex-girlfriend (Cynthia Watros, who is equally annoying) ever seeing anything in him, much less the burglar! The final scene in the film is well played and we almost get a sense of empahty with the characters but by then, it is too late.
Equally awful is the commentary by Guttenberg, actors Boyer and Cynthia Watros and writer Jeff Korn, who all sound like a group of giggling high school kids. It is all very amateurish and juvenile.",1061769600,3,1227,4.685185185185185

A few of the key lines from the book were missing along with the sexual subplot between Jimmy and his recently deceased best friend.

On the plus side, the guy who plays the burgalar is phenomenal.  He nailed the role.  A.J. Benza blew me away as Crazy Carmine.  While the actors who played Carmine's buddies weren't exactly what I would have envisioned, they pulled the scene together really well.

YOUR CAT IS DEAD as a play, and after trying unsuccessfully to place it on stage, in 1972 transformed it into a popular novel, which garned enough attention to get the original play off the ground.  But although the play was remarkably successful in Mexico, and in spite of several notable productions (including one starring Sal Mineo), it remained more of a critic's darling than a popular ticket.

In 2002, Steve Guttenberg and Jeff Korn combined the play and novel, which were not identical, to create a film production.  Guttenberg not only co-wrote and directed, but starred as well.  The resulting film received mixed reviews and little box office.  The major complaints were that it was not entirely faithful to either play or novel, that it copped out on the pivitol subject of homosexuality, and that the entire notion of a straight man being shocked by a gay man was extremely dated anyway.  The film went nowhere fast, and these days it tends to turn up in DVD bargain bins.  So it has a very negative reputation--but, in my opinion any way, it's a reputation that is undeserved.  For taken in the right spirit, P.S. YOUR CAT IS DEAD is quite a lot of fun.

The basic premise of both play and novel are the same.  Jimmy Zoole (Guttenberg) is an out of work actor who returns home to find that his girlfriend is dumping him, the vet has called to tell him his cat is dead, and there is a cat burglar named Vito hiding under the bed.  In a burst of anger (and one has to wonder if William Mastrosimone saw the play before he wrote Extremities), Jimmy knocks Vito cold, ties him to the kitchen island, and when he awakens Jimmy proceeds to torture him in various comic ways--with a strong emphasis on the word ""comic.""  It transpires that Vito is gay, and when Jimmy's girlfriend returns to check on him, she is shocked to find him apparently involved in an S&M relationship with another man.  The joke turns Jimmy and Vito into friends, and Jimmy ultimately takes Vito in, adopting the cat burglar just as he had adopted the mangey cat.

The problem that most people seem to have with the movie is that it isn't really the play or the book, but a compromise between them.  Perhaps the biggest problem is that it is not set in the 1970s, but is updated, which tends to undercut the story.  It also has more than its share of continuity errors.  The result is much more flyweight than one could wish, but even so it's a fun little thing with attractive performers, a clever script, and a cheerful (if somewhat ambigious) conclusion.  The DVD has nice visual and sound elements and an audio commentary by Guttenberg and company that is more ""isn't it great to get back together!"" than it is actually informative.  Recommended; don't expect too much and you'll enjoy it.
