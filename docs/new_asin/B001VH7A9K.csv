8346430,5,B001VH7A9K,Another great purchase.  This DVD teaches the dancer how to dance to rythms and timing of movements to make the dancer a better performer.  I highly recommend this video along with the others that Nadirah has available.,1243555200,4,219,4.891891891891892
8346431,5,B001VH7A9K,"I have purchased many videos that promised a drum solo, a tribal, a Lebanese ""choreography"", etc, hoping to find some insight from the instructor on how to create such a choreography on my own. Instead, all I get is ""copy this choreography but don't be afraid to improvise on your own"". Not exactly what I had in mind. Not that I haven't learned something new from every video, just not the nuts and bolts of improv & choreography. I don't want to copy what someone else has invented. I want to know how to invent it myself!

I'm reviewing this series as a set, having purchased episode 1 as a DVD, and viewed 2 & 3 as podcasts. In this series, Ms. Jamal answers the questions that an intermediate level and above dancer has when starting to perform in public. How do you craft an entertaining choreography? How do you ""choreograph"" to begin with? What moves do you decide to use? What do you do when your mind goes ""blank"" in front of an audience? How do you improvise?

She speaks very clearly and in easily understood terms. She describes how an audience thinks, so that you know what you are trying to make them feel. She helps you learn to improvise with specific exercises that help you use your brain on your feet, as well as build in your personal ""fallback"" moves for those ""blank out"" moments. She teaches you how to use patterns and repetition to remember and create a choreography. She also shows you how to build momentum and excitement by building complexity into your dance. Throughout, she uses easy to follow demonstrations and drills to further communicate her point and give you material to use. EXACTLY what I wanted, and material that I can use for months or years to come. The price is also very reasonable, considering how much practical use I can put this set to. MUCH better investment than several more expensive videos I've purchased. I say this even considering that I did have a minor inconvenience with how the episode 1 DVD played in my DVD player, as well as considering that the production quality of this set is not outstanding (as is clearly noted in the product description).

Ms. Jamal herself comes across as natural, very graceful, warm, and down to earth. She is a pleasure to watch and to listen to. She is not unbelievably thin either, but has a full and beautifully proportioned frame, which is such a treat nowadays when every tabloid is either flashing celebrities' ""bikini hot"" bodies or tearing them to shreds for the slightest deviation from ""digitally enhanced perfection"". Ah, but I digress. Ms. Jamal is beautiful and dances with warmth, grace, and joy, a perfect example to aspire to. I certainly hope to see more of her teaching. She has a gift.",1243123200,4,2698,4.640167364016737
