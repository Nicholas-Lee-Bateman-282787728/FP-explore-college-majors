3763176,5,B001QB5SS6,"I loved this story!  I'm from South Africa and it was very true to form.  I loved the miracles that God did throughout the movie - and knowing it's based on a true story makes it even more awesome.
I will say they use a little Afrikaans every now and then, which may make it hard for the non-Afrikaans speaking people to pick up everything they're saying, but my husband watched it and said it didn't detract at all.
I would highly recommed this movie for anyone wanting to watch God's power in doubtful circumstances.",1238112000,100,518,4.442105263157894
3763177,5,B001QB5SS6,"For those of us who long to see lives of faith portrayed with the grittiness and courage that this life entails and demands, here is the movie we've been waiting for.  I found the story immensely moving - all the more so for it being true - and the acting, especially that of Frank Rautenbach, particularly good. Worth the money for sure.",1235174400,115,338,4.451612903225806

3763179,5,B001QB5SS6,"Great movie.  Well-acted, suspenseful; really encouraged my faith.  One of the best parts was the documentary that followed that showed the real lives of the people involved.  So well done and inspiring.  I've given it as gifts to a few friends and they have loved it also.",1521590400,,273,4.74468085106383
3763180,3,B001QB5SS6,"RELEASED IN 2006 and directed by Regardt van den Bergh, ""Faith like Potatoes"" is a drama based on the life of Angus Buchan in the late 70s who moved his family from the political unrest of Zambia to eastern South Africa to start a maize farm. Buchan (Frank Rautenbach) and his family/employees (Jeanne Neilson and Hamilton Dlamini) face many challenges in their new home as Angus eventually feels led by faith to grow potatoes despite a severe drought.

The documentary-like tone is similar to other African autobiographies like I Dreamed of Africa (2000) and Nowhere in Africa (2001), except with the added faith element. Ive never heard of Buchan, but he went on to become a fairly significant South African evangelist (with a TV show). The movie focuses on his humble beginnings, his eventual conversion to Christ and service thereof but, surprisingly, the faith element doesnt even come to the fore until about the halfway point, which is when the film finally gets interesting.

Speaking of which, being based on an autobiography, the story lacks the compelling drive of the typical three-act script in preference for real-life mundaneness. Those other two films had the same issue. Yet this can be refreshing in that the movie just shows the way it was without resorting to exaggeration like, say, Oliver Stones The Doors (1991), which opted for sensationalist (eye-rolling) mythmaking and contains utter fabrications.

Of course critics argue that this movie ALSO conveys mythmaking fabrications and, furthermore, that the theology is contradictory and troublesome. Does it? Is it? I don't think so, but Im not going to explain because it would take too long and, besides, the answers are in the flick in a subdued way. Watch it, reflect on it and make your own call.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 56 minutes and was shot in South Africa. WRITERS: Angus Buchan (book) and Regardt van den Bergh (screenplay).

3763195,5,B001QB5SS6,"This is a beautifully made film.  I have watched several  faith-based movies, and this one is my favorite so far. This goes in my permanent collection. A keeper.  The actors were all terrific and the production value was outstanding. It is based on the true story of Angus Buchan, a struggling South African farmer, who finds faith and uses that faith to transform many lives.  The movie also gives a peek into  lives of both blacks and whites during the end of Apartheid in South Africa. Angus Buchan is one of those true heroes who is relatively unrecognized in a world full of fake heroes and celebrities. To the filmmakers:  Thank you.  Keep up the good work and give us more films of this quality.",1510444800,,702,4.568

But this one was not good. For all the hype people gave it. The acting was meh. The storyline was sub MEH. And really all over the place. The potatoes had a reference in the beginning of the movie, and then at the end when he plants potatoes. It was not climactic. But they're potatoes, unless you're watching Veggie Tales there's only so much excitement a potato can provide.

I wouldn't spend my money on it again.",1484697600,2,512,4.161616161616162

3763445,5,B001QB5SS6,"An inspiring film of faith that is based on the true-life events within and around a farmer's life and that of his family and the miraculous occurrences that took place, which brought about his inconceivable and subsequently, ""impossible"" - realistic and public manifestation, as in... an answer to his prayers. And all because of his belief, which was: All things are possible if your faith is in God, and not in man. A heart-warming and moving film that will encourage and keep you believing in the realistic outcome of your own dreams, goals, aspirations and objectives..., regardless of all the nay-sayer's. This endearing, encouraging and faith building film, comes to it's audience in color, on a single-disc, DVD that is approximately 116-minutes long. In spoken English with subtitles in English, Spanish and French. This is an uplifting film that motivates and encourages the dreamer, to believe in his or her dreams, as well as in, themselves. So, keep your dreams, goals and objectives in focus, pray, persevere and above all, don't give up! Because, the Lord can make a way where there seemingly, is ""...no way."" For ""...with God, all things are possible!"" (Matthew 19:26 KJV). So, be encouraged :)!! Nina Kish",1431993600,3,1222,5.054455445544554

3763506,5,B001QB5SS6,"I seen this before and now I own it in my collection of dvd movies.  This is a Christian movie about a farmer who moves to Africa and goes through hard times with his farm and the black workers.  But in all and all that he faces, he turns to God for His help.  This movie teaches us that God is with us no matter what.  God wants us to Love one another and to forgive one another.  The farmer learn that it is God that counts, not man. Man was made by God, so you would trust in God, because he made everything in this world.  The farmer prays for rain and God gives him rain to help him put out a bush fire.  A girl is hit by lighting and dies and it is God that he trust to bring her back to life.  It is God who blesses him to grow potatoes when his friends, and even his banker tells him not to grow potatoes but he has TRUST in God that HE will grow potatoes.  And only God can grow potatoes when the ground is so dry.  If you believe in God this movie will make your believe MORE in God and you will start trusting and believing in God that ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE FOR GOD TO DO.  I cried because, I trust and believe in God too.  Every since I was 19 when I gave my life to God by way of a Savior named Jesus.  I am now 61, I come too far now to turn by back on God.  I am going ALL the way with God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit by my side leading me all the way home (my Heavenly Home).  Thank You Amazon.  God Bless You.

Bachan's attitudes, verbal abuse, drinking, etc., are expressed very clearly. His wife thinks he needs psychiatric help, but Angus refuses. Then a friend invites the family to a mission festival, and someone there invites Angus to church the next day. Angus turns to God and his life, and the lives of his family change.

It is inspiring to see that two simple invitations led to this man's turn-around. The family who started with almost nothing, establishes an orphanage. Don't miss the last few scenes with pictures of the Bachan family.

There is one scene that will be hard for younger children to watch, so you might want to preview it before you show it to the family.",1417478400,,813,4.6

It's so amazing to watch the documentary after you see the actual film, to show you GOD in action through Angus in real life.i.e. a metal rod disappearing from a man's leg when he receives his healing from CHRIST through Angus.  GOD IS LOVE (1 John 4) and HIS MIRACLES are still happening.  I'm living proof since HE took a brain tumor out of my head without even using a doctor in 2010 by the use of 1 Peter 2:24.

3763636,5,B001QB5SS6,"Each of us who call ourselves Christ Followers have our own God story.  ""Faith Like Potatoes"" is Angus Buchan's God Story.  However, it is doubtful I would have ever watched this movie had Angus not been coming to visit my church, World Outreach Church, in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.  But when I was told that Angus Buchan would be coming to our church to lead a ""Mighty Men's Conference"" and would also be addressing our whole church, I wanted to find out more about him.  And while I had heard of the movie ""Faith Like Potatoes"" when it was released in my community a couple of years before, I hadn't felt any strong urging of the spirit to attend the showing of the movie.  (In truth, my husband and I do not attend a lot of movies.)
  First, we rented the movie at a place called Hastings.  But then, we were so impressed with the movie, we ended up buying a copy for ourselves.  ""Faith Like Potatoes"" is definitely a gem and a keeper to share with friends and family.
  Angus Buchan's journey of faith is told in a powerful way via this movie.  The screenplay is well-written and meaningful.  The director captures the emotion and spiritual journey of Angus Buchan in a marvelous way.  The actors are incredibly talented and seem to accurately project the emotions of the story.  (Be sure to watch the ""extras"" that come with the movie, including the interviews with the actors.  Their testimonies are very powerful!)  Yes, there is a particularly heart-wrenching tragedy in the movie with which it is difficult to cope, but there is a peace about it because of a father's dream.  As disturbing as the accident was, I believe it was essential to Angus' journey of faith.  Life is filled with tragedy, and there are those among us who will look at our life situation and tell us, as Job's wife in Scripture did, ""Curse God and die!""  But our God never intends for us to give in to despair.  It is God's will that we overcome the tragedies of life and mount up on wings like an eagle.  Angus Buchan has done that.
  In short, faith in Jesus Christ as Lord isn't for sissies.  Faith does indeed grow unseen for a season.  Then, faith like potatoes grows out of the dusty earth and sustains our lives.  We are ordinary people created by an extraordinary God to do extraordinary things for His kingdom.  ""Faith Like Potatoes"" will be a blessing to all who watch it!  Amen . . . and may it be so!!!",1383609600,,2395,4.479166666666667

As the film rolled we either learned to tune our ears or the audio actually came out louder.

3763646,4,B001QB5SS6,"It's a good Christian movie about one trouble South African man's move to becoming a believer, but what scores this one less star is the crap teaching from a pastor whom Angus Buchan meets with, who says something to the effect of ""God made man wild because God loves you"". If one is a true student of the Bible, they'd know that God NEVER made man wild...He made man in his image; it's sin that made man wild. The ""wild man"" in this film was Angus Buchan BEFORE he became a believer, and afterward you don't even see a trace of it. This sounds like it was coming right on the heels of the ""Wild At Heart"" book espousing the same nonbiblical nonsense in order to make excuses for men's anti-Godly behavior.",1379376000,,706,4.356060606060606

All three of these movies delivered far and beyond what I had hoped in film quality, sound production, acting, and message.  Since Faith Like Potatoes was recommended in this group, I purchased it recently.  The movie message may be as good as the other three mentioned ones; however, the sound track is so muffled between sound quality and the accents of the characters, I can understand little of the dialogue.  I have tried to watch the movie three times, and each time I have stopped a littler further into the movie when the main character began once again kicking, hitting, screaming at his family and the black village people and his farm workers.  I value my money very much, but I am ready to throw this one in the trash.  I cannot even donate it to my church.  It should NEVER be recommended with the Sherwood films.",1377129600,3,934,4.728395061728395

3763659,1,B001QB5SS6,"Someone who is not familiar with this movie, and who is not paying attention, might be tempted to purchase or rent this movie based on the extremely high ratings it is receiving.  Unfortunately, I was one such person a few years ago when I rented this from my now-extinct local Blockbuster.  As a disclaimer, I am not church-going, I do not read the Bible (although I have *read* it), nor do I believe in the concept of an inscrutable God who doles out miracles only to a chosen few.

Please keep a few things in mind about this movie:

1.  This movie actually has a good foundation.  It is set in a beautiful and exotic locale, and the cast seems quite talented.  The dichotomy of two very different cultures- white farmer and black native- is very interesting and is an avenue that deserved further exploration (which the film, after a certain point, fails to do).

2.  For a supposedly family-friendly PG-rated film, there are some rather disturbing scenes of abuse and death.

3.  The excess of positive reviews are, as far as I can tell, mainly from a deluge of people (or possibly clones, or robots) who write no more than 2-3 sentences and give it 5 stars because it, ""Restored their faith.""  Or similar words to that effect.  Go ahead, scroll up or down if you don't believe me.  Such reviews smell of an agenda, and their uniform brevity makes one wonder if the reviewers actually watched this movie.

4.  Most importantly, for better or worse this is a ""religious"" movie.  The proselytizing begins early, and it doesn't quit.  The first ""miracle"" is an off-season rain.  In my opinion, such an event is unlikely, but certainly not a miracle- especially since there were undoubtedly many farmers (including families of faith) who needed rain but didn't get it.  But I digress.  This event immediately transforms the main character from a man of very low character indeed into a smiling, model husband- and with no real-world consequence at all for his prior actions.  And that is just the start.  If you are not receptive to such a message, you will soon be rolling your eyes.  If you are receptive to such a message, you will probably enjoy this film.

3763702,1,B001QB5SS6,"This movie was a terrible movie. For starters, the description on the back of the box is really vary vague. I expected a movie about a farmer who had rough times in his life with his family and found the faith to persevere, to trust in God to take care of him and his family. I was not expecting the life story of a man who started a ministry in South Africa. I knew it was based on a true story, but I did not know who Angus Buchan was prior to purchasing this movie.
The movie itself is slow, and really not that interesting. It just seems to drag out forever. I kept waiting for the story to pick up, but it really didn't.
I could not believe the claim this movie made that Angus brought a woman who was struck by lightening back from the dead! People do not get resurrected from the dead by the touch of a mere man's hands. There were so many doctrinal issues in this movie that I did not agree with that I was  extremely sorry that I bought it. It is very theologically unsound.
It is a movie we will never watch again and will likely throw in the trash so that no one else is seeing it either.",1360972800,6,1099,4.041284403669724

3763710,5,B001QB5SS6,"I am not a very good critic in the areas of books or movies.  I give this movie 5 stars overall.  I give the acting 3.5 stars.  I do wish Amazon would offer subtitles on their streaming videos because the Australian English is at times very difficult to understand.  It isn't imposible, and for the most part understandable.  But at really quiet moments, or at times when dialog gets really quick, it does become hard to understand.  Besides the Amazon issue, I have two things I did not like specifically about the movie:

1.  The thing I found a little annoying is trying to figure out the timeline as the movie progresses.  There are only two times the movie would tell the audience the timeline, once for six months, then later 18 months.  Clearly the movie spans 3-5 years (how long does it take for one to learn to speak Zulu?).

2.  I found the continuity of the story very broken, like pieces were trimmed ""at will"" to save footage/money.  For example, during the movie, Angus just leaves to go visit Scotland.  Then, the very next scene we find he's been gone for months and will return ""next week.""  There were many scenes that felt ""spliced together.""

I guess I was always ""expecting"" something to happen almost at every step of the movie - whether by the acting or by the musical score.  And most of the time, nothing ever really did.",1359417600,,1347,4.5

It tells a story that might seem kind of boring: a farmer dealing with farming life in Africa and how that intersects with his personal faith journey. But in actuality, it's much more interesting and exciting than you might think. This movie held my interest just fine. It was well-produced and directed and had decent enough acting. Some of the visuals and scenery are just astounding and made me wish this movie was available on Blu-ray rather than just DVD.

At the core of this movie is a strong emphasis on faith and trusting God - even to do the ""impossible"" - even when it is uncomfortable or others think you're nuts. This movie showcases a vibrant, practical faith - one where the supernatural can and does occur. Some may quibble with one thing or another, but the general vibe of the movie I believe to be on solid footing. We need a bit more ""active, practical faith"" lived out and showcased to the world around us today. Either this Christianity thing is real or it's not. And if it is (and it is) then that ought to be evident to those around us. This movie helps stir us all up along these lines. As for the story itself, it was definitely interesting, however I did feel that the last minutes of the movie seemed very rushed. The crux of the movie occurs at the end, and yet, it seemed like it wasn't ""finalized"" because it needed another 15 minutes or so of film time. I don't know if the filmmakers ran out of money or just decided the movie was running too long, but it feels like you need more of the backstory - more exploration of the character's faith and why/how he was trusting the way he was. Although the story was ""resolved"", it wasn't a ""satisfying resolved"" - they didn't really ""seal the deal"" of the message they were trying to send. With that said, this was still a worthwhile movie and an uplift! A tip: If, like me, you're not used to the accents of the characters in the movie, you might find it much more enjoyable to watch with the subtitles on.

One note of warning: This movie has a bit of mild language and an intense bloody scene that I honestly found hard to watch. In my opinion, this is NOT a ""family movie"" for children under 13.

3763726,5,B001QB5SS6,"I like this movie for a number of reasons.  It accurately depicts the trials of life; our human / fleshly responses (get angry, lash out at others, question God, pull away from Him, the impact other people have on us, doubt, fear); God's timing and how He speaks to us through others and our trials; and His gentle, persistent, relentless pursuit of us.  The highlight of this movie for me is the portrayal of Angus' changed heart and how this plays out in his life.  Sometimes our lives are a lot like the dirt that potatoes grow in - full of good and bad stuff.  But yet our lives are the soil in which our faith (the potatoes) grow.  Everytime I watch this movie, I come away with another point to ponder.  I greatly appreciate the portrayal of a godly woman standing by her man, and, in turn, the godly husband he becomes.  The acting is very well done, the scenery dramatic and beautiful.  I recommend this movie for any and everyone.  It is in my public library, our church library, and now in my home collection.  May this movie bless and encourage you in your pursuit of God.",1356393600,,1083,4.396984924623116

3763736,5,B001QB5SS6,"I was flipping through the channels, trying to find something to watch when I came upon, ""Faith Like Potatoes"", on JCTV, a Christian station for youth of the world.

What caught my attention was how a native was offering to help Angus and his family build a home rather than live in a tin trailer. He kept saying, ""It is not good for your family to live in a tin house."" Angus finally agreed to accept his and other natives help. Within days, their home was built and Angus, his pregnant wife and children had a real home. I loved how his wife and children were involved in the building process. I was intrigued and decided to continue watching.

I am so thankful I did. I learned a lot about trusting God, for anything in my life, as well, as bringing God's Word to others without worrying what people might think.  Before his decision to become born again, Angus had a nasty temper and worked continuously, but really wasn't making any head way on his farm.

It was when he, begrudgingly, attended a church gathering and heard the message of what Christ had done for him that everything changed for him, his family, the Zulu natives and farmers of the region. He became one of the most interesting evangelists I have ever seen. He never had any agenda behind what he did for others or his preaching. He just wanted to bring others to God's Word, which he did quite successfully by putting his complete trust in God.

One scene, right shortly after he became born again, was when he was lying in the corn field, reading his bible a minister had given him. He was peaceful and serene and so thoughtful and I could see he was really enjoying himself-a far cry from the man who lost his temper at the drop of a hat and a workaholic.

Even though ministers told him there was no use trying to witness to the natives and refused to let him use their churches, he didn't listen to them. One told him, ""There was an evangelist, who came here. No one came to Christ."" Or something along those lines was said.

Angus had no problems believing he was as capable, of performing signs, miracles and wonders as God's Word says His chidren can do. Jesus said, ""The works that I do, shall he do also and greater than these, shall he do because I go unto my Father."" Angus walked out on God's promise and ministered to everyone, not just the farmers. The natives came to him when they had troubles. They trusted him, which they, normally, never did white men.

One thing he mainly taught was that it wasn't all about him. It was about serving his Heavenly Father and mankind, a lesson well taught. I learned from his example to not exclude anyone and to be bold for their sakes, not mine.

Of course, Satan rears his ugly head and kills Angus' nephew, trying to get him off the track of moving God's Word. But, God shows him he need not blame himself, which gets him back on the right track again. This is when things really start happening regarding the natives and farmers. They start seeing miracles performed. (You will have to watch it to find out what happens. I'm not giving it all away in this review.)

I found this film to be inspirational and a great message, about a man's true life story, to anyone who is having troubles in her or his life.

I highly recommend watching this movie. I'm buying the book and DVD for Christmas and birthday gifts. (I'm also buying the book for myself.) One thing about buying this DVD is it will be for whole families on my list, which can give them some special family time. It's a gift that keeps on giving throughout the year.",1355011200,,3558,4.416793893129771

3763739,5,B001QB5SS6,"The movie is ostensibly about having the faith to grow potatoes in a drought in South Africa, and that part of it, I didn't really get. But the part about this movie that I absolutely loved was the depiction of the main character's conversion. It was so beautiful. I replayed it several times. After watching the movie, I then watched the documentary showing the real-life farmer who inspired the movie. I had never heard of him, but it was easy to see how he could inspire others to have faith--a very likeable, gentle person. There was also one other pivotal point in the movie and the documentary that deeply touched me, but I don't want to spoil it for you. I will just say that this movie is definitely worth watching with the whole family. You will not regret it.",1354320000,,769,4.5

This man is the epitome of ""faith"". Imagine planting potatoes when the forecast is for no rain all season. No one else planted anything. Without rain this farmer brought in a harvest of potatoes.

This video teaches people of all ages some valuable lessons in faith, walking humbly with our Creator, trusting in Him implicitly, and experiencing the triumph that victoriously living by faith brings. How relevant this movie's message is to our times living in this world now! I know that Angus Buchan would never say this, but may we all be more like Angus in allowing Jesus to live His life through ours, and may we all see the triumph that living by faith will bring on the last day. Faith is the victory because it is living in the Person of Jesus Christ, especially when we allow Him to live in us and through us. This movie reverberates that message every minute it is playing. May its message reverberate in the hearts of those who view it forever!",1349049600,,846,4.464516129032258

The actors were astonishing: it's like they WERE their characters. Very realistic. This is definitely a must-have. You will laugh and you will cry every time you see it. One of the best Christian movies in the world.

3763759,3,B001QB5SS6,"Usually a movie based on real events and filmed in an interesting location will deliver but that wasn't the case for me. I found two things distracting; the farmer's ill temperment and the heavy handed approach of religion. In the movie, the farmer faces a series of events, he is angry and disagreeable and frequently vocal,lashing out on those around him. This part of the story lasts longer than was necessary for the viewer to determine that he's not very likeable. When he begins his transformation towards spirituality, the lack of subtlety and overt transformation, made the movie seem artifical. In case the viewer wasn't certain that a transition had occured that had caused the farmer to open his heart and change his ways, the movie turned the man from farmer to messenger. While I agree that it would seem natural for his transformation to carry a message, I didn't find the movie's portrayal of the transformation particularly interesting. More time should have been spent helping the viewer to understand the characters and their trials. Too long to make the point and the movie felt like a made for TV version of a good book.",1343520000,2,1140,4.851282051282051

3763777,1,B001QB5SS6,"Yes, I know this is a true story, but it's an incredibly mediocre film.  My wife and I gave up after 35 minutes because we were completely fed up with watching this man verbally and emotionally abuse his wife and children, and verbally and physically abuse the Africans in whose land he's farming.  Yes, I understand about redemption, and the strength of seeing redemption when it's much more strongly needed (as in with a complete idiot like this man), but this is a film, and films depend upon character development in order for us to be able to sympathize with characters.  The development of this guy's awful nature (Angus, I believe his name is) dragged on and on, and we did not sit down to watch a man abuse other people.  This is a guy who actually beats an African man for pulling out in front of him in his car, and who faces no social or legal repercusssions at all!  As far as character development is concerned, virtually every other character that we saw was simply two-dimensional, with no depth at all.  I'd even say that the children were one-dimensional, more like props than people.  While I don't feel a need to like every character that I see, I do feel a need to care enough about him or her that I want to see what happens.  A good example of this is Hugh Grant's character in ""About a Boy,"" who is definitely a jerk, but whose change and development are interesting to see.

Now that I read more of the reviews and find out about the graphic detail of the tractor scene, I'm even more grateful that we came to our senses and put in a better movie to watch.  My faith was rewarded by both of us having a much more positive evening!",1327190400,10,1654,4.375816993464053

First of all the movie was very difficult to understand. It was difficult to hear it, and I felt like I was straining to 'get it'.  The subtitles are distracting. My husband ended up falling asleep on the floor before the movie even got to the 'good part'.
The message I had hoped for didn't really show up until towards the end. I think I was also distracted by the 'beer drinking' in the movie. I wasn't expecting that. Maybe before he accepted God, but then he was also drinking afterwards.  The miracles were wonderful, the message of faith....that we need to have faith no matter what, was good.

3763792,5,B001QB5SS6,"I knew nothing about Angus Buchan or even the fact that this was a ""Christian film.""  I found it on the shelf of the public library which has never carried any Christian films that I'm aware of.  My experience of religions films has not been great---I try to stay away from them because they are usually so poorly made.  My taste is films tends towards the foreign art house genre.

So....when I put the DVD in the player and saw that this was from a Christian production company I nearly ejected it.  I'm so glad that I didn't!  Wow, this is one of the most heartfelt and inspiring films I've seen in a very long time.  The fact that the story is real helps a lot because no one could believe this if it had been made up.  Angus Buchan is a wonder-ful man in every sense of the term.  His story is definitely worth telling, especially in this world where there is so much grief and where true faith is usually ridiculed.

It seems that the whole endeavor was blessed, because, for one thing the casting was inspired.  It's hard to imagine any better actor for the role of Angus than Frank Lautenbach.  He is as handsome as any screen actor I've ever seen and twice as hunky as most.  More than that, the fellow seemed to really believe what he was doing; this wasn't just another acting role.  In his final ""performance' dressed in kilts at a huge rally, his words were truly inspired and inspiring.  His eyes twinkled with something like true joy--that's hard for an actor to fabricate.

Jeanne Wilhelm, as Jill, Angus' wife is very quiet and soft-spoken, as the real Jill seems to be.  My only criticism is that she was almost too beautiful to play a rough farmer's wife.

I agree with other reviewers who praise the accompanying documentary which shows us the real Angus.  He is a trip and a half---pure joy!  If this doesn't convince people to try Jesus, I don't know what would---probably nothing.  I am not a Fundamentalist and am usually revolted by hard-sell evangelicals but the power of this film and this man is that it is real!  Angus steps back so that Jesus can be glorified.

The actor who plays Angus' Zulu foreman is amazing, too.  His face has great beauty.  The last shot of the two men, Black and White, dancing for joy in the potato field is one I'll long remember.

I highly recommend this film to anyone with an open mind.  I found the cinemetography to be very nice.  It was extremely interesting to me to get a view inside South Africa, which was not politically motivated.  This is a fine film on many levels.",1313539200,43,2536,4.440347071583514

It was also extremely dramatic in others. Also a warning is it is very sad in one part where Angus (the main charcter, farmer) has an accidnet with his nephew, who dies. and blood gushes out of his mouth, so kids under 8 should not see this movie.

We all thought it was pretty neat that it was also based on a true story.

The movie showed hardships that we face in life and how he came to rely on God to help him and his family through them.

3763806,5,B001QB5SS6,It is an excellent film. Most Christian movies are rather weak in their delivery or acting. This was refreshing. Anyone that has struggled with a relationship with God ( everyone) will take something away from this. Even folks who have not yet accepted Jesus will take something from this. It was good cinematography and filmed in a beautiful part of the world. While I do agree that the child scene was a bit too graphic and the movie showed the effects of alcoholism everyone needs to wake up. Get out in the world and spread the Gospel as we are commanded. There you will see people dying and getting hurt and if you witness to the homeless and alcoholics getting thrown up on will be the least of your concerns. The world is not a pretty place once you get out of the house and this movie added some realism compared to most Christian movies I have seen that tend to sugar coat things. I think children will benefit by this film even though a little rough. Perhaps not very small children.

I often joked that Flywheel looks like they began filming the movie with a little hand held video camera, but as it goes on, you forget, as it is that good and meaningful.

3763816,3,B001QB5SS6,"This was a great story about the power of Jesus Christ transforming someone's life, no doubt!  Unfortunately this is probably one of those case where the book would have been much better than the movie.  My wife and I watched this together and had some trouble following the storyline at times in the movie.  For example in the beginning of the movie, the family up and moves, and neither of us really caught why.  The movie drags along at parts on scenes that don't really advance the storyline.  The beginning especially was slow, many scenes showing Angus' hot-temper, but that was about it.  I get that he's a hot-head in need of a transforming work in his life, aren't we all, let's move along here!

What really caught us off-guard was the tragic death of a little boy.  For one it was very graphic, definitely not a scene for little ones, and maybe some big ones too.  They could have stopped at the shot of the tractor wheel, but they go on to show him writhing and coughing up gobs of blood before his death.  As awful as a scene this was, I didn't really empathize with this scene due to the confusion I had over who this child was.  I think this family were friends of the main family in the movie, but it was never introduced that that, they just sort of showed up in a few scenes before, and now their son has just died, and I really didn't feel for him.  It was like reading a news article on a tragic death, but since you don't really know them, you have trouble feeling real pain, it was the same here.

The subtitles were also somewhat annoying, but I didn't have any problem reading them, and they were more in the beginning than toward the end.  I couldn't see how you would have done the movie in that setting without them.  Would have certainly detracted from the film if the Zulu's spoke English!

Overall, it was a good storyline once it got going, just be prepared for some confusion on the part of the minor characters.",1292198400,,1944,4.373259052924791
3763817,4,B001QB5SS6,"This is a story of a man who found faith in God to be the answer to both external hardships and internal shortcomings. I felt that Reghardt van den Bergh did an excellent job directing the film. Both my wife and I, though, felt the writing wasn't as strong.

I always advise parents to watch ANY movie with their children, even if it only has a G-rating. This is no exception. There is one graphic scene involving the death of a child that left some wondering if this should have been a PG-13 movie.

My wife and I discussed the theological implications of this movie. She felt that it was very heavy-handed. I didn't disagree, but considering this dealt with a span of several years I commented that it would be that way to get the movie down to a watchable time. For those who are Christians, it leans to the Charismatic side with its stories of miracles/healing. But I say ""leans"" -- Angus' conversion had nothing to do with miracles and it shows that God doesn't always work miracles (above mentioned death of a child).

Two responses to items other reviewers pointed out. One said it question psychiatry because Angus didn't take tranquilizers -- bull. Angus' character at that time was one that didn't believe he needed them. Another mentioned prostelytizing (or better put, evangelism). While very religious, I disagree that this is a prostelytizing movie. The only conversion in it was of Angus, which was early. It showed him witnessing in word fairly early on, but only one person made a decision as a result (still, early on). There was no altar call scene at the end of it.

I would say this is a faith-affirming movie, though I might not call it family fare (I'd say the same thing to a lesser degree about ""Fireproof"").",1290816000,,1733,4.616883116883117

I guess I expect alot out of a film that gets so many high reviews.  The acting was pretty decent - but the story line seemed a bit 'artificial' to me.  And at a certain point, I found myself asking - ""... is this about the Glory of God?... or about the glory of a MAN, who searched for God and found Him?...""  In the end - I became more convinced that this was about the glory (the works) of a man, and because of this - largely failed (in MY opinion) in it's goal of bringing viewers closer to our marvelous Lord. And I ASSUME that this was the purpose of the movie, right?  It wasn't terrible - but it wasn't all that good, either.  It felt like there was a bit of 'boasting' going on here.

3763822,5,B001QB5SS6,"A south African farmer named Angus is a workaholic farmer, putting 18 hours of work on his farm daily. He neglects his wife, and is easily irritated. In time, he is invited to a church function, which he grudgingly attends. He receives Christ as his Savior, and his faith grows to the point of attempting bold things for the Lord. He prays for, and gets, a giant high-priced stadium for a revival meeting. (What concerned him was not so much the violence of a few, but the apathy of the majority). He later takes the ""foolish"" step of faith in planting potatoes, even though there is a drought. If the crop fails, he will be ruined. People think that he is foolish. But God has other ideas.

Contrary to an editorial review, this movie does not unilaterally portray blacks in a patronizing manner. At first, there indeed is racism. The white farmers think of the blacks as devious and unintelligent. For their part, the blacks think of the whites as some kind of out-of-touch thinkers of bizarre thoughts. Towards the end of the movie, however, the white farmer Angus expresses heartfelt gratitude to a local black for having helped make his farm successful. What's more, the prayer sessions unite blacks and whites petitioning God for rain and for an end to the murderous violence.

WARNING: There is a graphic scene showing a boy who had just fallen off a tractor and been run over by it. It shows him, in his death throes, covered with blood and coughing up blood. This may be upsetting to sensitive viewers.",1286755200,2,1511,4.655430711610487

I can't say enough about it to do it justice.  With all the hype about evil forces, it's so gratifying to see that some do give credit to what's true and good and REAL.  True story of redemption, miracles, overcoming and a man who actually lives out the scriptures, today; as an evangelist in Africa, where he lives.  He continues to bloom where God planted him. If your faith's been compromised, this is the antidote for it!  You'll be glad to share this amazing story with family, friends and whoever else you can think of.  The ""extra"" footage is every bit as riveting as the movie. Angus Buchan is still a force, to be reckoned with.",1286496000,,704,4.426356589147287

It is a great story because it is a true story. A story of loss, of hope, of love, of faith and of victory. For me personally, the real gem is really found in the Special Features. Here Angus talks about his life personally and how he visited the set on a daily basis to ensure the accuracy of the film.

Angus Buchan comes across as a humble servant of the Lord that drives across the continent of Africa preaching the gospel and freely distributing food and books from his big yellow truck, that only has ""JESUS"" painted on it. He has faithful workers who have stood by his side on his farm over the years that now make this possible.

He has a modest abode and has constructed an orphanage where he takes care of abandoned children, some infected with AIDS. He is a true role model for all ministers of the Gospel. Enjoy the movie, but look also at the Special Features.",1285286400,,1020,4.307291666666667

3763828,2,B001QB5SS6,"First, let me say I'm am not a ""Christian"" in the sense that those who positively reviewed this movie would consider themselves. I don't believe in proselytizing, or miracles, or the supernatural in general. However, my husband does, and I love him, and therefore sat down to watch this DVD with him, well aware of the film maker's intended goals.

I was impressed with the acting. The actor portraying Angus Buchan is gorgeous, and the woman portraying his wife is delicately lovely, so even when the dialogue became mind-numbingly condescending and predictable, it was still a pleasure to watch (just turn off your brain.) The scenery was stunning, and I can only hope the portrayal of life for white farmers in Africa was at least partially accurate.

This is however, a heavy-handed ""Christian"" portrayal of conversion and prayer. Like ""Fireproof"" with Kirk Cameron, the story focuses heavily on a jerk of a man who is verbally abusive to his wife and those around him. He reluctantly goes to church and then gives himself to Jesus, and is suddenly turned around to become an ideal husband and father. It is a typical of born-again conversion during times of great emotional upheaval when one is vulnerable to false hope. Like ""Fireproof"", little is given over the character development of the wife, even less so in fact.

This film in particular is frighteningly critical of psychiatry, reminding me greatly of what I've read of Scientology. The main character starts the film violent and angry. His wife somehow obtains ""tranquilizers"" for him. The only discussion of mental health indicates it is due to weakness of character and ""emptiness inside"" which can only be filled by belief in Jesus. What a scary and blatantly false conclusion!!

I will also echo other reviewers' concern about the inappropriateness of this film for children. I don't believe my husband would have so happily popped this in the DVD player had he been aware of what was to come. The death of a child was portrayed very graphically with a great deal of blood, including the child writhing on the ground vomiting blood. I actually covered my childrens' eyes and had a great deal of discussion with them afterward about how ""fake blood"" is used in movies etc. I wish I'd known that scene was coming. The scenes of drinking and smoking were shown graphically as well, with the implication that only unsaved heathens drink alcohol, and then to vomiting excess. A more traditional film would probably have earned a PG-13. I don't know how this one squeaked out a PG.

Please be careful - this truly should have been rated PG-13. Keep away from small children!",1282780800,18,2637,4.877232142857143

What a movie!!! He is literally an example of the kind of faith spoken of in the scriptures. He moved mountains. Their simple life, love, and obedience to the Lord demonstrates that we do not need ""stuff"" to be happy, serve others, and find real joy and fulfillment in this life. There was no welfare office, no umemployment, no bailout. It was such an inspiration to improve my own life, to look for more ways to help and serve others, and to pray more fervently for the Lord's will in my life.

I was also touched by the way they handled tragedy. The loss of a child has to be the most difficult trial of this life experience. My heart ached and I felt sick inside. So touching how they were comforted by the Lord in the vision of his brother regarding the life of his son beyond mortality. It was wonderful reassurance by a loving God who is well acquainted with pain and suffering.
I must also add that I think his wife had to be an angel. God bless her!!

The documentary by the real man is a ""must watch"". The Lord can and does work miracles through ordinary people. I was so impressed that his ministry never took any money from those that attended. Vastly different from the evangelists of today who get rich off their attendees. It was obvious that money is not his Master.

However, it soon becomes apparent that this is not meant to be some sort of educational film. When the first ""miracle"" occurred my reaction was one of utter dismay. I mean, what, this guy thinks he's channeling God because it rained? Come on.

The strong religious overtones basically killed the movie for me, and it wasn't exactly an action-packed film to begin with. After the second miracle I realized that I had no desire to continue to sit through the movie and endure something so patently silly, and I stopped watching it.

3763876,4,B001QB5SS6,"This is an excellent movie that shows the plight of one man and his family in S. Africa. The movie is a harsh look at reality and contains some doses of things people may not expect to find in a ""Christian"" movie. However, I believe the content, though strong and shocking at times (the death of the child) show a reality that people in the US do not understand about live in S. Africa then or even now.

Because of the violent scene of the child's death, which could have been softened a little, I can not give this 5 stars. However, the expression of the films display of life in S. Africa is quite real and expresses a reality that most people never see or hear about.

The movie is also a mix of english and subtitles which also give it a dose of reality. There are 11 languages spoken in S. Africa and english is only one of them. So the use of mixed languages in the movie with subtitles does support the foreign feeling and theme of this movie.

I think parents should view this movie first before showing it to their younger children because of the harsh reality that is portrayed in the movie.

To me the most important issue is that Angus' story challenges each of us to read God's word and act on His leading.  Overall it is a great film.  The tractor scene with his nephew is painful, but if you watched the documentary you are aware of what is coming & can forward through if you choose.  In another set of scenes they portray Angus unrealistically working over a stump with a pitiful little hatchet until his workers show him a better way.

3763891,2,B001QB5SS6,"Because of some of the other comments on this board my husband and I previewed this movie before watching it with our 6 children. We are so glad that we did! This clearly is NOT a movie for children or even young teens! We are all for Christian movie making and have no problem watching movies that would not be up to the hollywood standard of filming. We LOVE Flywheel, Facing The Giants, Fireproof & many others from the Christian Film Festivals. What we are NOT fine with is calling this a family movie with so much time focused on an angry, smoking, drunken man. I realize that they were showing how he was lost in his sin and how he was a changed man after he was led to Christ but this movie is not something that children should be exposed to because of the portrayal of his sinful lifestyle goes on and on and on. You see, the end does not justify the watching of or exposing your children to such garbage. It was not just one beer or just one scene but the first, probably 20 minutes of the film was him being really angry, yelling and drinking. Including chugging down a beer from a friend who challenged him to chug it in 5 seconds and being so completely drunk that he was sloppily drinking his beer and so drunk he couldn't light his cigarette and then throwing up. Too much of his sinful life portrayed for a family movie.

The other point that another reviewer made was that the death of the child was so real and graphic and that it absolutely has no place in a family movie!!! I could not agree with that statement more!!! It has been 3 days and I still am effected by that scene. Real and acted well~yes. To be shown to children or even sensitive adults NO!!! The child is run over by a tractor and laying on the ground. The man went over to the child screaming ""NO! No!"" and they cut in close to the child's head and they showed massive blood coming out of his mouth. It is too gory/real.

We are adopting a sibling group from Ethiopia and wanted to watch a movie about Africa, and life in Africa...but we regret that we even purchased this movie. It could have been a great family movie based on a true story~but it is not. We, as Christian adults, were not inspired or encouraged by this film but rather disappointed and heavy hearted.",1246924800,27,2256,4.293427230046948

3763894,5,B001QB5SS6,"I first heard Angus Buchan preaching on TBN Africa on one of my stays in South Africa. I was immediately drawn to the basic if crude simplicity of his message. I began waking early each morning to listen to his show; drawn to listen to him further because he is a man who speaks from his heart and from the Word of God. One can tell immediately there is something special about this simple dirt farmer. If you can't put your finger on it, I can tell you it is the anointing of God's Holy Spirit.

What I did not know was anything about his past (save the little tidbits sprinkled in his daily messages). This beautiful film (and the accompanying documentary, which I'll agree with another reviewer really steals the show) tells the rest of the story.

It is a story about a simple man with what some may consider everyday troubles that appear to him as insurmountable obstacles. This is a TRUE story about how anyone who puts their faith in Jesus (the Messiah) for their salvation, and the LORD God to help them live life day by day, will overcome every obstacle. Indeed, GOD has blessed Angus with a powerful ministry...even raising a young lady from the dead (John 14:12). Indeed, it may well be that his sermon in the stadium (showcased in the film) was the genesis for the Reconciliation of South Africa at the end of Apartied, which has saved South Africa the fate of so many of her sister nations in the last half of the 20th century.",1246147200,,1440,4.450757575757576

3763897,5,B001QB5SS6,"There are two things I like about this film: South African actor Frank Rautenbach, who plays muscular farmer-preacher Angus Buchan; and the accompanying documentary about the real-life Angus. Bucahan starred in a South African television series in 2000, but this is his feature film debut. Since Faith Like Potatoes, he has appeared in Hansie (2008), and is currently in The Bang Bang Club and Taste Of Rain, coming out in 2010. Rautenbach isn't going away. He's an excellent actor, totally into his character and, in this film, he IS Angus Buchan.

He plays opposite very attractive Jeanne Neilson, who is also terrific as Angus' wife, Jill. If I were making a Christian film, and there were any way I could get these two, I would. They're both very natural, have a lot of chemistry and are fun to watch. They're joined by Hamilton Diamini as Angus' Zulu employee and friend, Simeon. The rest of the cast is also strong.

The main weaknesses I find in this film are the accents, which at times are difficult to understand; and some of the filmmaking, which is often excellent - especially given some of the scenic South African locations - but is just as often mundane. That is probably due to director Regardt van den Bergh's limited experience. Besides Faith Like Potatoes and Hansie (2008), he's done The Visual Bible: Matthew (1993), The Visual Bible: Acts (1994), and a handful of other Christian and South African fare. This is what I call ""Hallmark Channel"" production values, which is typical of both Christian and South African filmmaking. It is acceptable and pretty, but not especially artistic or innovative.

The story of Faith Like Potatoes is true and is based on Angus Buchan's own book by the same name. Angus is a white farmer, struggling with his young family in the socially and politically torn, drought-ridden Zulu land of South Africa. The pressures of life fill him with anger and frustration, until one day he and his family attend a lay church service of farmers, where he finds rest in the arms of Christ. From that moment on he's a different person, and his life begins to show the signs of God's hand on him. One day, after praying in his ""green cathedral,"" which is what he calls his maze field, Angus senses God's call to preach, so he begins dividing his time between that and farming. There are some very well-done scenes of Angus demonstrating his faith in miraculous ways, as well as giving his testimony. There is also a very tragic scene that has a profound effect upon him and his faith. But the climactic section of the film is when he decides to plant potatoes in the middle of a drought, knowing that potatoes are the most difficult crop to grow, but sensing this is what God wants him to do.

After watching Faith Like Potatoes, which is good, viewers will be delighted to find a documentary about the real-life Angus Buchan included among the extra features. It is even more fascinating and inspiring than the drama. Narrated by Rautenbach, it is full of wonderful stories of Angus' faith, and the journey he and his family have taken from struggling farmers, to running a home for AIDs-victim orphans, to running a far-flung evangelistic ministry across Africa. There is even a scene in the documentary of Angus healing a cripple in a meeting where 5,000 Muslims came to Christ, and it's captured on film!

I don't know any film that gives a clearer picture of what faith looks like than this one. It and the documentary are loaded with wonderful one-liners, but here's a sampling: ""One genuine miracle is worth a thousand sermons."" ""The condition for a miracle is difficulty; for a great miracle, it's impossibility."" ""Maze you can see; but with potatoes, you have to have faith."" ""We're not doing things and asking God to bless it. We're asking God what we should do, and then He provides. There is a difference."" ""Don't wait for a million ran in the bank before you start your project. Start it by faith and God will add to it."" ""God's not interested in your ability, but in your availability."" ""God honors faith.""

Before Angus began his ministry across Africa, he sensed God telling him to buy a gigantic semi truck and trailer, paint it yellow, and paint the word ""Jesus"" on the sides. He now takes it into the remotest parts of Africa where he preaches the Word, ministers to people and gives out materials to pastors and teachers. He never takes up a collection. Back on the farm, he's left his friend Simeon to run things and watch over his family. It's a lonely life out on the road, planting seeds of the Gospel; but it is one filled with great joy and great harvest. As Angus' yellow truck heads down the highway one more time at the end of the documentary, I longed to join him. I probably can't do that, but I can join him in his journey of faith. So can you.

All those miracles in the movie really did happen, and in modern times!!! See the real Angus speaking. Hear his vision for bringing the gospel all the way from S. Africa back to Jerusalem. Caution, his zeal for the Lord is catchy. Also, if you haven't read ""Heavenly Man"" and ""Back to Jerusalem"", you must do so. I found it interesting that the Christians in China have this vision of spreading the gospel from China all the way back to Jerusalem. Then low and behold I find that God is also working in South Africa in the same way. Maybe he is working in other countries as well. Wake up sleeping church in America.

It challenges Christians as if we had a simple faith like him, and we didn't limit God - think of all we could do where we live!

The accents you can easily understand, after a couple of minutes of 'tuning in'. I loved the filming of it locally, the feel of the film, the editing (what they kept in).

The only negative was with the acting a couple of times - the wife ""jeanne"" looked like she was acting in a couple of scenes, and the conversion scene wasn't done well - overacted and didn't feel genuine. But it was a small part and didn't really detract from the movie.

This is one of the best Christian movies that I have ever seen. It is done very professionally which makes it even easier to watch.

The film is done in South Africa. The movie is based on a true story. The actors/actresses portray the characters so well that you almost forget these are actors/actresses.

The movie will change your life. It will change the way you look at things. It gives you hope to believe.

Watch the movie and then watch the special features section. Both are awesome. The special features shows a live interview with Angus Buchan, the central character of the movie. You DO NOT want to miss it!

It's worth what I paid for it and more!",1239926400,,816,5.444444444444445

The movie as a whole is very good. What we didn't like about it was since it was done in Africa, trying to understand what they were saying, due to the accent, was hard and then having to read the subtitles (which were hard to read in yellow) went by before we could read them. It is something you have to definitely try hard to keep up with and follow. I think the book will be much more interesting than the movie just because the movie was hard to follow in places. It definitely touched our hearts and is a story that is amazing.
It just goes to show what can really happen if you do have faith.",1239580800,14,772,4.153333333333333

8335298,4,B001QB5SS6,"Very meaningful.  Makes you realize the importance of faith and of hope. The movie teaches that when life gives you challenges, you can overcome them through Gods help.  I had to watch with subtitles, though, as the accents are very thick and its sometimes difficult to understand what is said.  But it is worth watching even with subtitles.",1525478400,,341,4.844827586206897
