8311050,2,B001GF8WRQ,"Boring characters and absolutely zero direction makes this series a chore to get through. The final story arc on this volume does manage to provide an interesting spark with the new character but with how easily and haphazardly the series moved past the last two story arcs, it seems easy to predict that this one won't get much better treatment on volume three. There is little anyone could say to convince me that the last volume of this series will end on a much stronger note.",1230681600,,480,4.593023255813954
