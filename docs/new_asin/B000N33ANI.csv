8174307,2,B000N33ANI,I saw this great film in 1991 and it was longer than the dvd which came out much much later. So when I found a dvd that said it was 2 disc I figured it was the whole version. This product did not come with 2 discs. It has a truncated beginning and end compared to the original film.,1394409600,3,282,3.7966101694915255
