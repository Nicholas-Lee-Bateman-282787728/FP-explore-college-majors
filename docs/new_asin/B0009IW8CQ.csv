8061330,5,B0009IW8CQ,"I liked this film a lot, even if I liked the 1962 version MORE. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

IMPORTANT PRECISION 1: this is a Region 1 NTSC DVD. It will NOT play on Region 2 European equipement.

IMPORTANT PRECISION 2: this film was first released as THE FALL OF AKO CASTLE, so you may have seen it already under this title...

This film is another version of the archi-famous story of 47 Loyal Ronin (""Chushingura""). If you are not familiar with this story it may actually be an asset when watching this film because discovering this immensely tragic and extremely controversial story for the first time is really an experience... Therefore I will just say that this is the story about 47 samurai who in 1701, following the demise of their master, Lord Asano, become ""ronin"" (masterless samurai) - but far from living the rest of their lives in peace they engage in a quest to avenge their master and protest the injustice he fell victim to. The only problem is that even if against all odds they succeed, they proce of success will be certain death...I will say no more.

For obvious reasons lord Asano appears only briefly in the beginning and therefore, as in most of films about this story (I own four different versions and there is more) the main character is the leader of the 47 Loyal Ronin, Oishi Kuranosuke. He is played here by Kinnosuke Nakamura, a veteran actor whom I saw in the very controversial ""Bushido"" in 1963, the most excellent ""Revenge"" from 1964, the famous ""Samurai Trilogy"", the excellent ""Samurai Banners"", the ""Goyokin"", the ""Incident at Blood Pass"". He of course played in many more films but I cited here only those which I saw. This great and famous actor left us in 1997, aged barely 64. Here he portrays Oishi Kuranosuke in an absolutely IMPRESSIVE way!

The director, Kinji Fukasaku, was also already quite famous in 1978, as he made a great many films, including the quite powerful ""Under the flag of the rising sun"" in 1972 and the shocking ""Battles without honor and humanity"" in 1973. He was also in charge of Japanese sequences of ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" in 1970. However he would turn his most known and most controversial film only in 2000, at respectable age of 70 - it was the ""Battle Royale""... Sadl, he also left us, in 2002.

Toshiro Mifune appears in this film playing only a little role - but his short appearance is a VERY powerful one and makes a great impression. Sonny Chiba, a famous specialist of martial arts, appears also in this film, but he plays a secondary character - and most of this film is DEFINITELY NOT about sword fights, even if there is a lot of fighting towards the end.

I liked this film A LOT, not the least for the different approach of the story than in the more classical 1964 version. Here Oishi and his followers are willing not only to avenge their lord, but especially to cause the shogun to lose face, as it is him and his ministers who are blamed for a great miscarriage of justice. However, I still prefer the 1962 version, which is longer and therefore more detailed when also being more intense. It also explains better the character and motivations of the main villain of the story, Lord Kira Yoshinaka - without which it is hard to really understand what made all the protagonists act as they did.

I must also say one thing here about the subtitles - they are HORRIBLE! Clearly the person who was in charge of translation and English subtitles either didn't know Japanese or English, because they frequently don't make the slightest sense! I will give here just one example - immediately after the demise of Lord Asano is known in his domain, English subtitles say: ""Dozens of former followers of Lord Asano came to the castle asking for their employment back"" when for anybody familiar with the story it is clear that the Japanese version was ""Dozens of former retainers of Lord Asano came to the castle volunteering to return to service"" (because everybody expects the Asano clan to make a stand in the Ako castle against shogun army). And there is many more examples like that. Therefore in many places you will have to exerce your own judgement trying to interpret what the subtitles say and what it should really mean...

All that being said, this is an excellent film, for my taste the second best movie version of this immenesely tragic story, only slightly inferior to the splendid 1962 version. Enjoy!",1399420800,3,4425,4.655569782330346
8061331,4,B0009IW8CQ,"Until I watched this movie I had not realized that it tells essentially the same story as ""The Loyal 47 Ronin"". Although the plots are essentially the same which implies it is from the same events or book; there are differences in the focus of the movie and on various elements of the subplots.

Comparing the two movies, It is clear that ""Swords of Vengence"" had a bigger budget with bigger sets and a larger cast. On the other hand, the Cinamtography of ""The 47 Loyal Ronin"" is more artistically pleasing and, I think in the whole the acting was better in ""The 47 Loyal Ronin"". Both movies are really quite good in my view and they present an amazing story of patient and well planned vengeance. I think that ""Swords of Vengence"" is a bit more complete in the telling of the story.",1387411200,2,783,4.4375

8061333,5,B0009IW8CQ,"Although it is a long movie at 158 minutes, this film is actually a very concise telling of the tale of the 47 Ronin.  Other tellings have been made into multiple parts, as in the 1942 version, and yearlong series on Japanese television.  As such, it is easier to follow, but it misses a lot of detail.

The young Lord Asano brandishes his sword at Lord Kira inside the Shogun's castle.  A swift decision is made to abolish the Ako Clan, which Asano leads, and Asano is ordered to commit seppuku. Asano's clan believe Asano was justified, and are angered at both the punishment and the fact that Kira was not punished at all. 47 of the Ako retainers, led by Chamberlain Oishi (played by Kinosuke Yorozuya),plot revenge against Kira, which is acheived in two years time.

Although this is part of the Sonny Chiba ""Shogun Collection,"" Chiba only has a small role as one of the retainers, and his part in this film is really behind the scenes as choreographer of the climatic sword fight at the end of the film.  Toshiro Mifune gets second billing on this release, but I believe only appears in about two scenes.

The on-screen time really belongs to Yorozuya, and as usual, he does not disappoint.  Kinnosuke Yorozuya plays Oishi with dignity and strength.  He is sensitive to the critisism he receives for taking too long to exact revenge, but lets it known that it is the only way the plot will work.

For action fans, the climatic sword fight is very well choreographed by Sonny Chiba, and even knowing how it will turn out, you still find yourself rooting for the Ako Clan.

As opposed to longer versions, this movie does skirt on the deceptions Oishi went through to throw Kira's spies off, the effect of waiting two years on the ronin who were committed to the plot, but the viewer still gets an appreciation of the main story points: just how elaborate and well played this plot was, the character of Asano by receiving his punishment under protest, but without complaint, how Kira was disdained by his fellow daimyos, and the dedication and loyalty of these 47 retainers.  In the end, Kira gets his, and the 47 retainers are ordered to commit seppuku. And as irrational this behavior may seem in modern times, the viewer really connects with the players involved and understands why this tale keeps being re-told after two hundred years.  Ironically, as my parents pointed out to me, the Ako Clan would have been forgotten today, but in the way it was abolished, is still remembered.

By far this is not the most detailed telling, but especially for fans who like chambara, this is one of the best versions to serve as a introduction, or primer, to the story of the 47 ronin.",1268524800,12,2681,4.616842105263158
