8282456,2,B001B9G2ZQ,"Not recommended for anyone needing life-saving skills. His later books seem much deeper, so I would advise going those, more recent works. The basic premise is ""He who gets hit in the nose first is the loser""  right on! The rest is basic boxing, not the best for smaller or less experienced fighters.

A much more sophisticated analysis of violence, fighting, and mental conditioning is found in ""Facing Violence"" by Rory Miller. Down and dirty street techniques for the regular Joe or Jane such as eye gouges, elbow strikes, finger grabs, kicks to the groin or the instep, etc., can be better learned from a book such as, ""Fight Back: A Woman's Guide to Self-defense that Works"".",1410739200,,680,4.803418803418803
8282457,5,B001B9G2ZQ,"I wish Franco was closer. I'd go and train under him.
He gets it down to the nitty gritty. Working stuff that makes sense. No mysterious complicated movements.
This is great for women.
Buy the video. You won't be disappointed.
And I don't know him personally and I have other videos and books by different defense people.
Sammy Franco is at the top in this attack the attacker style of getting out and away from those that would do you harm.",1389657600,,441,4.45679012345679
8282458,5,B001B9G2ZQ,"First strike dvd teaches everything and anything you ever wanted to know about striking first in a street fight it is excellent for those whom have little experience in street fighting and those whom have martial art experience in the dojo ,but have not really been tested unlike dojo sparring first strike teaches you not to wait on the attacker to punch first for whom ever strike first,fast and aggresive often is victorious .",1355184000,,429,4.8108108108108105
8282459,5,B001B9G2ZQ,"This First Strike strategy should be the bread and butter of any training regime. This mindset is what allows street fighters to win. The person striking first has the advantage in a fight. Forget the dojo safety of 'your turn, my turn'. Fighting outside the confines of sport is not turn based, but one long blast of blows: someone attacking, someone defending.

This DVD shows you how to ensure you are the one controlling the win. As with other CFA instructional DVD's, First Strike is instantly understood and with the scenario section you will see just how devastating and essential the strategy is. Anyone thinking that this way of fighting is unfair just wants you to lose. All the tools are presented in a practical way. All the scenarios are realistic and show the tools of First Strike in action. All instruction is broken down, and can be copied by anyone with the desire to win.

All the training in the world will have been wasted if you are running on the defensive, so get this DVD, and enhance your training.",1239235200,2,1024,4.651933701657459
