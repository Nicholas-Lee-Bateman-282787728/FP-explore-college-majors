7541142,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I have all of Jessica Smith's Walk On DVDs and this one doesn't disappoint!  She is joined again by her Mom Debbie, who looks terrific and does the beginner moves, and Beth, who is like the energizer bunny (i.e. she performs advanced options).  There are ten 30 minute routines that offer a wide variety so you won't get bored, and I was happy that she incorporated a lot more weighted work into them than she has in the past.  She also utilizes a chair and towel in a couple of the routines - be sure to have those handy!  All the routines are highly effective but doable and many sneak up on you the next day (hello, 350 abs!).  There is something for everyone here; HIIT, ballet inspired work, targeted strength training, abdominal exercises, basic cardio, stretching, and an excellent routine for the joints.

Upper body strength:  This one snuck up on me (but then again it's been a while since I last exercised).  Jessica recommends one light set of weights and one heavy; I used 5's and 10's.  After a brief warm-up she does a lot of shoulder work with the heavier set then moves on to the front shoulder/chest, does ""w"" flies, hammer curls, regular bicep curls and tricep kick-backs with the light weights.  From there it's down to the floor for chest presses (some of which utilize the triceps as well).  Jessica finishes with ab and back exercises: basic crunches, side crunches to hit the obliques, a modified side plank with pulses, modified superman pose, and pelvic tilts to target the pelvic floor (i.e. where that nasty belly pooch lives).  I thought it was a very comprehensive and effective routine that packed a punch as I could barely move my arms the next day.  You can easily upgrade or downgrade your weights depending on your level so there's always room to grow.

Lower body strength:  You'll need a sturdy chair along with your light/heavy weight sets.  Jessica starts with basic squats (over the chair) then adds the heavier weights with squats and squats emphasizing each leg.  Deadlifts are next, followed by split stance deadlifts and finally light weight work with the chair.  Think kicking your leg up in back of you with the lighter weight lodged between your thigh and knee area following by pulses in the same position, side kicks, plies, low lunges/pulses (all weighted), etc.  She finishes with a series of bridges on the floor (also using the chair), leg criss crosses, butt work while on your tummy then a nice stretching session.

Cardio party:  This routine was very similar to many of Jessicas others and she, Debbie and Beth were joined by other members of her online community (I think).  Some moves include grapevines with a side kick, traveling V steps, double hamstring curls, skaters, cha-chas, sashes (?), side steps with claps, and speedbags.  There were a few new steps but for the most part everything was pretty familiar to exercises shes done before.  At the end there is a five-minute cool down.

Brain fitness fun:  I really enjoyed this workout and was surprised how sweaty I became since it wasn't too strenuous.  There were the usual skaters with arms crossing in front, hamstring curls with front ankle taps, kicks with the opposite arm doing other things, and grapevines (leg in front then leg in back) but she included things I haven't seen before on any of her DVDs:  box steps, a tightrope walk, and something called the flamingo that totally boggled my brain (think one palm facing down while another if facing up above your head).  Fun facts about the brain popped up every now and then, which I found interesting.

Prehab routine:  Jessica definitely targets almost every joint in your body doing this routine!  If you have her Walk On: 30 Day program you'll recognize some of the moves that strengthen the back and feet but she doesn't miss a spot.  She begins with your neck (the ""chickenhead"" to realign everything), then uses a towel to stretch your shoulders in every imaginable way.  She targets the elbow joint by doing some 90 degree tricep bends with the towel... I felt it!  From there she focuses on the wrists: circling them (""wax on/wax off""), lateral side to side movements, and has the wrists up (stop!) and down.  You head to the floor from there to do mini-cobras, supermans (lifting opposite arm and opposite leg), bird dogs (on hands and knees lifting opposite arm and leg again), bridges with a focused pelvic tilt, and inner thigh lifts.  The feet are the final focus with point/flex, ""swats"" (batting your feet from side to side), spreading your toes, picking up the towel with your toes, etc.  The most difficult move was the one she cited as the most important and functional: standing up and sitting down without using your hands.  It's harder than it sounds!  Although this routine does focus on the joints I was also sweating since it wasn't simply stretching; she incorporated some yoga, did some calisthenics, and even the abs were worked a little.  I can easily see why doing this regularly would be very beneficial for both your joints and muscle groups.  Fun facts were also presented along the way.  While not strenuous, I think I'll be coming back to this one quite a bit.  Excellent!

Dynamic stretch:  This routine was very relaxing and would be great to do when you've got sore muscles.  It was gentle: side to side neck rolls, shoulder shrugs, side twists with the towel, back/shoulder stretches using the towel, etc.  She does the ""hurlder"" to stretch the quads, the ""butterfly"" for the inner thighs, pigeon for the hamstrings/hips, ""happy baby,"" and ends with a quiet meditative moment at the end where she asks that we all think of something we are grateful for when it comes to our bodies.

Total body strength:  This was a tough one for me as I'm not the best at circuit training.  Of all the exercises I've done on this DVD this one had my heart rate at the highest (my Polar heart rate monitor entered the target zone more than once!).  Jessica starts with forward lunges combined with a shoulder press (I used 10 pounds and could feel it) then does weighted squats, 90 degree standing chest raises, side lunges with bicep curls, pulsing tricep kick backs, rear flies, curtsy squats, etc.  Then it's down to the ground for rows on all fours, onto your back for criss crossing chest presses, swimmers on your stomach, and ab work.  She hits the oblique's, the pelvic floor (""diamond crunches""), and oblique's again with modified plank dips.  By the time she got to the plank dips I was a sweaty mess and had to call it a day.  When she says it's a total body workout she's not kidding!  But it's definitely effective and packs a huge punch in a short amount of time.

Barefoot fusion sculpt:  This routine was very ballet inspired and while more flowing in nature it was sneaky.  I'm not sure how heavy the weights Jessica used were but she does a LOT of repetitions and 5 pounds was too much for me.  Of course, doing this after total body strength didn't help so 5 pounds might be perfectly doable.  Bicep curls with leg sweeps across, tricep dips with plies, tricep kick backs with rear leg kicks, shoulder raises with step behinds, oblique work with passes (?), etc.  Everything is graceful (expect for me) and fluid but accompanied with many reps so it wasn't easy.  She finishes with a great series of Tai Chi movements - these were new to me and required a bit of balance.  It thought it was more focused on the upper body but Jessica does throw in grand plies and plie pulses so everything is worked.  A nice change from full-blown weight training or cardio.

Interval mix:  I confess that I'm not a big fan of HIIT training but I actually enjoyed this one.  Jessica does most intervals using a chair or mat for plank work; think mountain climbers, jumping from side to side, and lowering/lifting the knees.  I stuck with the chair and was breathing heavily.  She mixes in skaters, grapevines, swimmers, high knees, etc., to keep you moving until the final five minute cool down.

360 abs:  Wow!  I was already becoming sore even before the routine ended!  Jessica includes punches/leg lifts, up/down punches while shuffling, shuffling twists, high knees, side oblique crunches, side chops with a hamstring curl, side chops and squats, ""around the world"", etc., many while using a weight (she advises no more than five pounds; I found five pounds to be more than challenging!).  She finishes on the floor with elbow plank dips, kneeling knee to elbow (weight optional), exercises for the pelvic floor and the ""dead bug"" before doing some brief stretching.  No need to work your abs on the ground all the time - those to me were the easiest!  Standing abs also makes for great cardio so it's a two for one bonus.

Jessica as usual is her encouraging and cheerful self and not some drill sergeant (hi, Jillian!).  She understands that we are all at different levels and cheers us on to do our best.  You'll get what you put into it but this program is more about embracing our bodies and doing what we can to improve them rather than become a body builder.  There is no ""dread"" factor with Jessica - she makes exercising enjoyable and is my absolute favorite trainer.  Here's hoping she keeps the DVDs coming!",1451347200,36,9226,4.697196261682243
7541143,5,B0187Z2IR2,Love working out with this leader.  I have gotten most of her DVD's and I work out with her.  I would highly recommend this set.,1451260800,,128,4.08
7541144,5,B0187Z2IR2,"What I love most about these (and all of her) workouts is that they are short and sweaty (30 minutes).  Challenging enough to make you feel like you've gotten a great workout in but won't intimidate you with crazy moves.  These are easy to face; easy to complete - but make no mistake, they are very effective. :)",1450742400,21,313,4.379310344827586
7541145,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I received a copy of this set to preview and I can't tell you how excited I am about the Total Transformation system. It's a 6 week program that utilizes cardio and strength training with ten brand new half-hour routines that are designed to build a stronger, healthier body. The program is great for exercisers of all levels since each workout features beginner, intermediate, and advanced options demonstrated by Debbie, Jessica, and Beth. There's a nice mix of cardio only, strength only, cardio/strength, prehabilitation, and stretching workouts that vary in style and intensity so you will never be bored. One of my favorite features is the 6 week calendar that provides a daily schedule but I am most excited about the premiere of the walkonwalkstrong.com website. Support from Jessica and her community members has motivated me to make a difference in my life and I believe the new website will only strengthen the level of support. Walk Strong is Jessica Smith's best workout series yet.",1450483200,52,995,5.036363636363636
7541146,5,B0187Z2IR2,"Walk Strong is the newest program by certified wellcoach, fitness instructor and personal trainer Jessica Smith. I was lucky to receive a preview copy of Walk Strong to test the workouts and to my opinion this is so far her best program. It consists of 4 DVD's with a total of 10 workouts, each 30 min. I am always amazed, how Jessica comes up every time with something new while sticking to her fantastic style.

The set includes:

Pure Cardio workouts like Interval Mix, Cardio Party and Brain Fitness Fun,

Cardio and Strength combos like 360 Abs (my personal favorite) and Barefoot Fusion Sculpt (here she even adds some Tai Chi at the end which was completely new to me),

Pure Strength workouts like Total Body Training, Upper Body Strength and Lower Body Sculpt (but if you are familiar with Jessica's routines, you also know, that her Strength workouts also include some Cardio effect),

And Recovery and Injury Prevention routines like Dynamic Stretch and Prehab.

As always, Jessica explains exactly the moves, you can easy follow without getting bored and of course, she gives different impact options, that also beginners can do her higher impact workouts. At the same time, she manages to motivate you that those 30 min are just flying.

I like especially about this set, that Jessica includes more strength training in her walking program, for me the perfect combination. But even if you are new to strength training and have no dumbbells (yet), she tells you how to modify and you can still enjoy a very effective workout.

As in her previous programs, her Co-Walkers are her Mom Debbie who gives low impact options and her friend Beth showing higher impact versions. Only Cardio Party feels like a real party, because here, she is also joined by 4 members of her community.

I do Jessica's workouts now for more than 2 years on a daily basis for at least 20-30 mins, because she taught me, that it can be fun to improve your body's fitness and health and I can definitely say that her programs do work (I have all of them). After testing the new program I can't wait now to start her 6-week's schedule which is included in this set.

Jessica is the only fitness instructor who kept me motivated from the beginning of my fitness journey.",1450396800,137,2252,4.707379134860051
7541147,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I own and regularly use all of Jessica's Walk On DVDs, and this one is by far the best! She clearly listened to her community and did a ton of research when designing this plan. It is so comprehensive, challenging and fun. You'll never get bored! The Highlights ... 360 ABS: A fast-paced cardio abs workout with weight (optional) packed with lots of fun new moves. BAREFOOT FUSION SCULPT: One of my favorites! There isn't anything like this one on Jessica's other Walk On DVDs. It's a flowing total body workout that is sneaky challenging and ends with a beautiful meditative segment. INTERVAL MIX: I loved the addition of planks into the intervals on this workout. The 30 minutes sped by, and I was a happy sweaty mess at the end. BRAIN FITNESS FUN: This feel-good lower impact walk will keep your mind and body working in unison. It's super fun and will get your heart rate up. CARDIO PARTY: The title says it all! This is a non-stop party packed with fun new faces, new moves and lots of smiles ... I love that Jessica has incorporated weights into many of the workouts (hence the word STRONG in the title), and that each workout is customizable to all fitness levels. And don't forget to stop and listen to Jessica's motivational intro segment and read all the inspirational quotes along the way.",1450396800,79,1300,4.607758620689655
7541148,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I absolutely love working out with Jessica, so Id never leave her a bad review.

However, Im got knee issues and Im a Debbie-level workout person, and this moderate program is a bit too much impact and strength training for my liking.  I absolutely LOVE my 30-day Walk On boxed set (my first Jessica purchase).  After doing that consistently for many months, I decided I wanted more variety and bought this.  I only really like about half the programs, and the rest I won't do again anytime soon.  And I still pull out my Walk ON set and do those on some days.

This is a great set for those of you that want to so strength stuff almost every day and more impactful Beth-level workouts.",1527984000,3,686,4.404761904761905

I've lost inches and combined with Weight Watchers, I am down 13 pounds in 3 months.  I love that it is just 30 minutes, the workouts don't kill you, and they WORK.  I am so impressed with Jessica and the progression through the training.  I believe they give you a full body workout- like having a personal trainer.  Her direction during the actual workouts are spot on!  Seriously, this is probably the best purchase I have made in years!!!  Thank you, Jessica!!!",1527033600,3,599,4.5233644859813085
7541150,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I love these workouts! I make myself do 30 in the morning before work. its easy and not hard in the body. I have almost all of the ""Beach Body"" DVDs you name it I probably own it, but this is the  ONLY ONE I have EVER COMPLETED by following the 6 week calendar that comes with it. Because its only 30 minutes and the workouts are gentle and as Jennifer Smith says its ""sneaky workouts"" cause you don't feel like you are doing anything,  its fun and calming. its a mix of cardio, strength and flexibility but done in a NON-TRANSITIONAL  I like her voice and the backgrounds. the music is not bad either. her 60year old mother and another 55 years old lady are in the video.  I also purchased the walk strong 2.0 and the 8 week program. I can feel my body changing, its not a fast fix its a lifestyle. I really enjoy this and hopes she makes more. I don't normally write reviews but I believe in this.",1526774400,3,899,4.149425287356322
7541151,5,B0187Z2IR2,"Wow!! I have done just about every single workout video out there, from beach body to Jillian Michaels. They were all insane and difficult and I injured my foot doing one. These were too hard to follow and never finished them to the end. Jessica Smith is amazing!! I have only been into this workout for one week and Im truly hooked! I acutually look forward to the next one each day. They are amazing and I feel great. I just ordered her next set and cant wait to get it.

She just has a great way of executing her moves and making them easy for everybody, plus interesting.  I love everything I have gotten from her, but this one is my favorite so far.  She is inventive and different, without being to far out of the box.  Also, she has her mother on some of them which always makes it more relateable.  Just a plain, good workout.  Will continue to buy her dvds.",1524960000,,475,4.390804597701149

7541156,5,B0187Z2IR2,I got this set after purchasing one of Jessica's Walk Strong DVDs and must say that I really love these workouts. I have her Walk Strong - Build Balance and Inner Strength DVD which she works out alongside her mother (who is my age) and with no shoes. I love it!  I'm a fan of Ellen Barret and have worked out for years with no shoes. There are a few workouts in this set where you don't wear shoes and I'm more comfortable with them. I tried some of the other workouts in this series without shoes but felt that they are best done with shoes on. So I just go with Jessica's recommendation for bare feet or shoes. I would love to see her do more videos with no shoes. This is also a great value. I got a special coupon from her website for signing up to get her email newsletters so made this an even better value.,1523664000,2,814,4.0875

7541160,5,B0187Z2IR2,"This program is good for anyone.  Even me recovering from a back injury.  Of course, I must listen to my body on even the simplest of movements like your arms are together and circle around.  For some reason, my back is not ready.  As someone that has workout since I was a gymnast in high school, this is good.  However, there are some moments of technical error.  As in making sure you watch Jessica in the movements.  Watching her is better than listening to her.  Her ques are a little off.  Also, there are times she is doing the exercise and one of the others are not doing the movement correctly.  This is important mostly as it can cause injury if done repeatedly.  Also, if you are not doing it correctly your results may be slow in showing up if your goal is to sculpt your body.  This program reminds me of the days of March to fitness and WalkFit with Kathy Smith.  I used her videos the first time having a back injury over 25 years ago.  I thought I should go with something more current to get the updated information.  No need.  March to fitness would have been just fine.  This is good.  As I said for anyone.  Disc two day 4 is Barefoot Fusion Sculpt.  This one, in particular, would be great for anyone doing anything on any court.  As it moves in precise movement.  Moving in ways that made me think my daughter should have this when she was playing tennis in high school.  Hope this helps.",1518912000,,1410,4.318007662835249
7541161,5,B0187Z2IR2,"There is a reason for the high ratings on this.  First, the instructor is pleasant and clear.  Second, she was successful in dragging her mother into the workout and her mother is a good modifier of exercises.  Third, the pace will keep you fit but not kill you. Fourth, there is even a brain fitness workout that will benefit your mental health and coordination.  Jessica Smith deserves strong applause for this program.",1518134400,,421,4.805555555555555

After these 6 weeks, I can't imagine a morning without working out with her.  She got me moving again.  After I retired, I found myself gaining weight.  I wasn't ready to be ""old"" yet and needed to get some of this weight off.  I tried other DVDs, I've had over the years, and they were just to hard and I didn't stick with it more than a day or so.  Jessica's DVDs grow on you.  At first I didn't think they were hard enough to do any good, but believe me, if you stick with it, they make you stronger and the new muscle melts the fat right off.  I know what she means now by ""hate me now, love me in a few weeks"".  Thank you...",1516320000,6,733,3.931972789115646

7541169,5,B0187Z2IR2,"Jessica is a fantastic fitness instructor- I have several of her other workouts including two of her 10 minute solution workouts (Boot Camp and Kickboxing), her Barre Fitness DVD, and her Walk On 3 DVD Super Set which are all excellent.  I have also done several of Jessica's youtube workouts.  However, I  think that this Walk Strong set features some of Jessica's strongest work to date.  This is a fantastic set of diverse workouts, everything from barre fusion to hiit to resistance training is included.  Jessica is encouraging and pleasant while pushing you to do your best.  The background exercisers, Debbie (Jessica's Mom) and Beth are real women who appear healthy and fit which is really inspirational to see.  I find that the diverse group of workouts provide just the right amount of intensities ranging from low-moderate to higher intensity.  As I am an intermediate exerciser, I have focused on mostly higher intensity workouts in the past i.e. Jillian Michaels, T25, Turbo Jam, Tony Horton, etc.  However, these days, I am finding that I much prefer working at a more moderate intensity as there is zero dread factor and I finish the workouts feeling energized rather than wiped out.  I also like the fact that these workouts are gentler on the body, thereby greatly reducing the risk of injury. While I have also used a number of Leslie Sansone's walk fit dvds and enjoyed them, I feel that Jessica's walk on/walk strong dvds are much more varied and well-rounded and incorporate far more resistance training which is a big plus for me. I see that Walk Strong 3 is now out and I am absolutely looking forward to purchasing that set soon as well.

The past 2 months, I decided to really get serious, and I am actually using one of the workouts at least 4 times a week. In just eight weeks, I can already see a difference. My arms feel stronger and toning up and my legs are starting to firm up. I LOVE the 360 abs, and I tend to reach for that workout video the most. That's not to say the other workouts aren't great because when I do the lower body workout, I can definitely feel it the next day. I'm in my early 40s, and haven't worked out extensively since my 20s. This workout is just perfect to start getting your strength back. You can use light weights and add to them when you are ready. You can even follow Debbie, and use no weights at all if you prefer.

I have tried other programs by other instructors and this one is the best one I found so far. Not boring, very motivating and her workout buddies are real people, not ""super humans"" with shiny six pack stomachs.

I already finished the first 6 weeks plus 2 wks and now I am currently working on the 6 week countdown Phase II (on week 3; found that rotation calendar on her website somewhere...) and still loving all the workouts.  I need the structure of the calendar telling me which workout to do on which day so I am glad Jessica provides additional calendars to follow.  Total- I am 11 weeks into these DVD's.
When I started I considered myself a beginner and followed many of the modifications provided.  Now I am keeping up with Jessica on every workout!  While I haven't really dropped much weight (probably because I'm not following some crazy diet!) my fitness level has changed dramatically thanks to the Walk Strong DVD's.  And my body has become much stronger and more toned.
I have to say my fave workouts are the Brain Fitness fun (not a tough cardio workout but a good one to strengthen the body and brain!), the Barefoot Fusion sculpt, and the Prehab routine I do every Sunday, my rest day!  But I really enjoy all the workouts.
I think their customer service is awesome!  I had a bit of a playback problem when I first received the discs, but I was able to email them directly and received quick & personal responses to help get me going.

It's complete and has a great variety. I think it's a perfect holistic approach to fitness that can be modified for any level. You can add heavier weights and follow the advanced modifier, or you can cut back the weights and follow Jessica's mom, Debbie. Jessica aims for functionality and health, rather than abs and thigh gaps. The workouts tend to be sneaky, particularly the Barefoot Sculpt and 360 Abs workouts, all the sudden you're sweating ...and I've been surprisingly sore the next day. This is not at all geared towards men, but I would recommend it for any woman who likes to workout at home, if only to help prevent injury from harder workouts.

7541196,3,B0187Z2IR2,"Have used this for a couple of weeks.  Basically I like it, but there is a BIG problem a buyer should be aware of.  Each session is 30 minutes.  If you are older (I'm in my late 60s) or have hip, neck and/or back issues which (as in my case) are under control and OK right now, several of the sessions spend over 1/3 of the time on a mat on the floor.  You are doing variations of sit-ups, leg lifts, back lifts, all of which could very probably set off your ailments again or might be too much for you at your age and physical condition.  That's a risk you probably do not want to take.  Debbie, the mother, is supposedly doing an easier version of the exercises, but she's still on the floor and still potentially stressing those vulnerable spots.  It would have been so much better if Debbie had remained standing and done some variation of the exercises that might not accomplish as much, but would also be a lot safer or just more comfortable for an older user.  As it is, I won't be able to use several of the sessions and that makes the purchase sort of a waste of my money.  It's not that the program is poorly done; it's just that it's not thoughtfully done for a wide audience.

I get my heart pumping, get a sweat going, and build up strength and push it as far as I can on each given day.

I love her fusion workouts because they are ""sneaky workouts"".  You ease into it and then discover that it isn't as easy as you thought and it was  great exercise.

I tend to start exercising then get bored.  However with this program I do not.  I love how the program is laid out for you so you know exactly what to do every day, there's no thinking ""what will I do today?"". There is no dread factor at all with this workouts so I enjoy doing them.  I love how they are only 30 minutes, that's all I intend to devote to an exercise video.  I also walk, hike, or jog regularly so I can get my 10K steps in daily. I currently use 6 & 8 lb weights for the sculpting segments.  I also have almost every video in the 30 Minutes to Fitness series and with those I use anywhere from 8 to 15 lbs.  This series the 6 & 8 work perfect but on my next rotation I may ""try"" to move to 6 & 10.  I am on my last few days of the 6 week program.  So far I've lost 10 pounds which on my 5'3 frame is pretty good.  Based on her calendar I made a similar program with my 30 Minutes to Fitness series and I plan to alternate them every 6 weeks.

I wanted to also voice my opinion on this program compared to P90x.  Several years ago I did the P90X program but I didn't care much for it.  I did not lose all that much weight.  I've lost more with Jessica Smith although part of that is due to a more restricted diet.  My biggest beef with P90x is that each one is one hour long and there is a lot of wasted time.  Jessica's videos are 30 minutes and you don't stop.  So I feel my heart rate stays up in the fat burning zone even during the sculpting workouts.",1494460800,2,1629,3.881818181818182

7541203,4,B0187Z2IR2,"Fitness level: I'm quite overweight and started working out a couple months ago.  I did the 30 day Walk on DVD set first and I really liked those.  I would recommend you start with those if you're new to working out or like Jessica's walking DVDs.  I'm not quite done with this program but I've done all the workouts at least twice.  My favorite is the cardio party, it's fun but still work.  I also like the brain workout. The workouts can be hard but like always she gives modifications.  I'm sweaty and feeling pretty good when I'm done.  I like having everything scheduled for me so I don't have to worry about picking a workout.  Jessica is fun and encouraging.  I really like that this set includes strength training as well. It's so important to include and it really helps to have something to follow since I'm beginner.  This set just has a little different feel to me than others I've done.

Cons:
1. There's quite a bit of mat work, none of her other workouts I've done include it (that I remember).  I wasn't aware of this and was kind of caught off guard.  Mat work isn't my favorite.  My size and fitness level can make it difficult/uncomfortable.  Part of the problem could be my thin yoga mat.
2. You need equipment for almost every workout, it's not listed in the description anywhere.  Other reviews have a full list.  The high back chair would probably be the standout.  The issue I have is the lower body strength workout.  I have a wood chair and my feet slide on the chair as I try to work out.  I only have a yoga mat so it's awkward to change positions and stay on the mat.  I have to kick the chair out of the way then hurry to put it back.  It can be a little frustrating.  In the video they use big round mats and fabric chairs, so they don't have these issues.
3.  Since I have plantar faciitis, the barefoot sculpt was hard on my feet.  Using the yoga mat helped but my feet were sore the rest of the night.  Just a head's up if you have similar issues.  I tried doing with shoes on and it kinda worked but can't really recommend it.

Overall, I like the set but I find it frustrating at times and don't enjoy it as much as the 30 Day set.  I wish they would include an equipment list and maybe a mention of mat work. I'll probably come back to this set after re-doing the 30 Day Walk on set.  If you're expecting straightforward walking DVDs, these are not it.

Added: I'm grateful that the company reached out and left a comment.  I always appreciate good customer service.  I didn't call since I don't want my money back or anything.  I'm glad I invested in this set and will come back to it.  I need to push myself and this set does that, I just wasn't quite ready.",1493856000,22,2698,4.244094488188976

7541211,4,B0187Z2IR2,"UPDATED REVIEW:

If you read my first review, you saw that the DVD would not play in my computer, so I could not work out. I decided to return the DVDs and buy the streaming version. I have done the streaming version twice, and will share with you my experience.

The first time I did this workout (6x a week with Sunday off) I took it a little easy, using 1 lb weights and creating alternatives to the floor work. I was not in good shape and needed to do that to make it through.  I also have pain in my knees and have to guard them. After completing the entire workout I felt stronger and saw some weight loss. I did change my eating habits as well and walk my dog 3x a day as usual. I then graduated to Jeanette Jenkins 21-Day total body workout which was a KILLER. I would not have been able to even attempt without this program. I then went to CALLANETICS 30-Day to a beautiful body and loss inches immediately the first 2 weeks. But the harder the exercises
got, the less the results. It was also killer on my knees. So I will not be doing Callanetics again.

I just completed this workout again, but this time I have added 3lb and 5lb weights and have done all the floor work. It felt like a different program when I pushed myself. This program kicked my butt in a good way and has greatly improved my fitness level.  I am so much more fit that I tried indoor rock climbing for my b-day and kicked ass!

Since my weight loss and fitness journey started in February, I have lost 48 pounds. I still have 17 more to go, but I am almost there.

Below is my assessment of the program.

* CARDIO PARTY - The woman to the right, in red, was such a distraction. She messed up so much, (going right when everyone else went left, among other things), that she kept me from concentrating on the workout. She was so bad that I am surprised they didn't re-record without her. My second time doing the program, I had to mentally block her out.

* Love the wrist stretches in the UPPER BODY workout.

* I would like to see a bubble with alternative movements to the ground work for people who can't get to the ground.

* Jessica is very pleasing to listen to and easy to follow.

* I had issues with my knees (squats) and had to make changes accordingly.

* BRAIN TEASER was a different sort of workout and had you do things you may have never seen before in a workout.

* Some of these workouts are over 30 minutes. They try to fool you by not starting the clock for several minutes. Just an FYI.

* LOWER BODY SCULPT - worse routine for people with bad knees. Too much bending and squats. You may injure yourself further if you don't protect yourself.

* DYNAMIC STRETCH - You won't burn many calories doing this one, but it feels good to your body.

* BAREFOOT FUSION - Love this workout. Easy to modify moves if you need to protect your knees. Tai Chi ending is awesome.

NOTE TO JESSICA: You use all types of ethnic moves in your workout, which is welcomed. You also mention whether they are Asian-influenced, Latin-influenced, etc. But you do some which are ""African-influenced"" but don't mention that (stepping backward and waving your arm backward in a circle). Next time be sure to mention that influence as well.

I'm on to the next exercise DVD's, but will come back to this one in about 2 months.

FIRST REVIEW
I was so excited to start this program. Got up extra early, put on workout gear, then proceeded to spend 2 hours trying to get these DVDs to play on my MacBook. The built in DVD player on my computer has no issues playing my movies or other DVD exercise-related (Leslie Sansone) that I purchased from Amazon.

So why are these videos any different? My guess is that they use an encryption process which limits how you can play it. Since I paid for it, I should be able to view on my computer. Even tried playing in 2 other programs. Didn't work.

So frustrated as I wasted 2 hours on this instead of working out and getting work done. I found Jessica on Youtube and loved her style. Wish I was able to do this program.",1491177600,,4064,4.305774278215223
7541212,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I bought this series a year ago - and for some dumb reason I was just doing the 30 minute ""cardio party"" - which I loved and gave me great cardio results. In just the last few weeks I decided I needed to commit to the full set of DVDs and follow the daily plan. I am LOVING IT. I am age 50 and it's the first work out routine that makes me feel like I'm getting a work out (some burn and a little sore the day after), but it's not KILLING me and making me afraid of hurting my back, knees or any other body parts. I can't wait to stick to the full 6 weeks and see the results.....like I said, kicking myself for not doing the whole routine sooner, but SO happy I own this and can get started now!!!",1490918400,3,698,3.8541666666666665

Stiffness in the wrists and ankles, raising the toes when I walk-how did she know? There is no wasted movement in these workouts. Each movement does something.

People comment on my physical improvements. I lose weight consistently.

Some of the movements I can do with her. Some I adjust up or down with her mom and the other woman. Some I just bungle through. I know I must do it 1x before I can do it 2x and I just keep going. Each time I can do more.

Yesterday in the kitchen I noticed I could squeeze open spring clips that I couldn't before. Seemingly insignificant but makes a big difference, those little things.",1490227200,16,925,4.3604651162790695
7541216,5,B0187Z2IR2,I have purchased more than a dozen of her videos.  I enjoy working out with her and her mom.  Sometimes I do two in a day so I can eat dessert and not gain weight.,1490227200,3,163,3.6285714285714286
7541217,5,B0187Z2IR2,"Terrific program. No jarring, joint-damaging movements. Lots of strengthening that gets the heart rate up. Don't be deceived by how easy it looks. This is quite a workout. Each workout is only 30 minutes long. Low-impact modifier for each one. Highly recommended!",1490140800,,263,5.285714285714286
7541218,5,B0187Z2IR2,"Review of Jessica Smiths Walk Strong Total Transformation
I highly recommend!  I had baby #2 seven months ago and was looking for something that I could do at home to ease back into shape.  Happily, I came across this!  My husband even did most of the videos with me, which is a huge testament to the program.  We both feel stronger, more balanced, more flexible, and overall in better shape.  We feel inspired to keep exercising and get stronger.  Jessica made it fun, and we loved the schedule.
Heres a breakdown of why I love it:
1) It targets all fitness levels. Jessica takes the moderate level; Debbie her mom takes a low-intensity level; and Beth takes the high-intensity level.
2) The moderate intensity version is front and center.
3) We love the countdown timer.
4) She really does stick to 30 minutes for all of the exercises (except for the prehab exercise which is 34 minutes, and I think there is one other routine that is 32 minutes.)
5)  She uses time efficiently.  I own a lot of exercise videos that have a lot of talking before and after the actual workout  she gets straight to business.  And there is no pausing for talking during the video.  You know you're going to be exercising the whole time.
6) It doesnt feel over-choreographed.  They make mistakes, which is good for me.  It keeps it real.
7) Jessica, Debbie, and Beth are average-looking people, and thats a good thing.
8) They are not showing off fancy exercise clothes or equipment.  Its what youd find when you go to the gym -- people wearing lots of different kinds of clothes and colors.
9) Jessica gets that were exercising at home in a living room.
10) I like the room they are working out in and the background of moving cars in a distance.  It makes it feel more real-time and less staged.
11) We love the schedule.  We need the schedule.",1490054400,2,1827,4.507598784194529
7541219,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I love the variety of the workouts and the fact they're all 30 minutes! Jessica Smith has such a fun, supportive personality which really helps!",1489536000,,144,4.8
7541220,5,B0187Z2IR2,"Fun!! Love these videos and there are enough of workouts that I don't get bored. I like the schedule provided, makes it easy to rotate the workouts.",1489449600,,148,4.518518518518518
7541221,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I used to be a runner but after having two children and currently needing surgery to repair some damage caused by their births, I have had a lot of difficulty finding an exercise program that I can participate in that works with my health needs. I can't jump around a lot without pain. When I started actively trying to get back into exercise, I tried searching Amazon for walking videos and stumbled across Jessica Smith. I read reviews for her workouts and was intrigued so I checked out her videos on YouTube. I started working out to Jessica's YouTube videos daily and really enjoyed them.
 I finally broke down and bought this set of DVD's because I wanted all of the workouts in one place with a set schedule of when to do them. I love this program! Jessica is very real and breaks moves down in a simple way that is easy to follow. She talks just the right amount between moves that it keeps you motivated but is not annoying. I like that I can follow her mom if I want a workout that is less-intense, Jessica for a workout that is moderate-intensity, or Beth for a higher-intensity workout. I am able to do all of these workouts without a ton of intensity but still get a fantastic workout! The only workout that I don't enjoy is the prehab routine. It gets very boring rather quickly. My favorite is cardio party. It's quick paced and fun. It's really great having a wide-variety of workouts to rotate through. It keeps me interested and motivated.
  I like that there is a guide included that tells you which workouts to do each day. What I don't like is that the guide does not come with a list of equipment needed for each workout. The DVD's do tell you what is needed at the start of each workout but it would be nice to also have it written out in one place to prepare ahead. I workout in my bedroom and on days that I need a high back chair, I need to drag one upstairs from the kitchen. It would be great to have this ready before the workout starts. Eventually I will remember what each workout requires but I haven't been able to remember them all yet.
I can't wait to try some of Jessica's other workout video collections!

Note: The bottom corner edge of the plastic case my DVD's came in, as well as one of the prongs that holds discs 2 and 3 came broken. I was disappointed that it was broken before I ever even got to use them but this did not effect my rating as the actual DVD's are of great quality and the broken case did not affect them.",1488672000,,2465,4.294623655913979
7541222,5,B0187Z2IR2,"Cannot praise Jessica Smith enough, this is a perfect workout series, geared for women in the sense that it targets a lot better ""tricky"" body parts to tone like the abdominal region and thighs. I've done all the P90X series from the original to the 90X3, and was looking for something slightly less violent and intense due to constant injuries. I highly recommend Jessica's workouts...",1488585600,14,386,4.953846153846154

I read the reviews and I am pleased that the reviews were honest.  I am at day 10 and I love it.  I can feel the muscles hours after the workout is over, in a good way.  I have shared some of the moves with the ladies I work with and recommended this program if they wanted to switch up their routine like I did.  I like the fact that it is not the same routine every day, which keeps me motivated.  Try it, you will not be disappointed.",1487980800,,589,3.982905982905983

I also love her mom, I can relate in age and size. very encouraging. I love the count down clock, several mornings I have worked one of these in before work.

I was a little hesitant to buy it because of the price but since I had Amazon gift cards I thought I'd take a chance. I cannot tell you what a fabulous find this program is. It's not for beginners, though Jessica's Mom shows modifications. What I love about this is that there are challenging but doable moves that are perfect when I want to sweat and smile at the same time. Jessica just has such an easy manner about her that the time just flies by, especially with the countdown clock on the screen. There are 10 different programs each focusing on cardio, strength or balance. I did have problems with a couple of the DVDs skipping or not being recognized on my computer though they were fine with the DVD player on the TV. Great customer service response, and the problem was solved. Well worth the money",1485907200,,934,4.2824858757062145

7541241,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I ordered the streaming version of this Walk Strong set. The videos are accessible anytime online and easy to get to the library. I recommend this if you can't seem to take care of dvds like me. It includes a printable chart of the 6 weeks, and she indicates on each day what workout to do, and a circle to color in once completed to track progress. I am indecisive and can often spend too much time looking for a daily workout, and so I greatly appreciate that it is already planned out for me.
I have tried many different workouts. It's usually one of the following: I am not into the instructor,  the music is terrible,  the exercises are boring, the cuing is poorly done, or too long.  This Jessica Smith Walk Strong series was easy to follow with different intensity levels to choose from, and small bursts of intervals to really get sweating. I enjoy the 30 min time frame. The moves are really fun, with a good final stretch.  My first time I was holding back from crying as I was working out  just because she is so encouraging and says the RIGHT thing to keep your mind where it needs to be, at the perfect moment!. (by the way I have never cried while exercising before and it is not the easiest thing to do! lol )  I will have no problem at all following the next 6 weeks with Jessica on this.

I have Walk Strong 6 Week, The Complete 8 week, Build Balance and Inner Strength, and Boost Metabolism and Muscle. My inner strength has noticeably improved (no need to sit on public toilet seats!), my cardio is great (did a step test at a health expo and was told my heart returned to lower than starting point in less than 2 mins), and when my out-of-state daughter saw my posture she said, ""I need Jessica Smith!""

I have degenerative disks in my lower back and notice increased pain when I'm away from home and not doing Jessica's workouts. Even after this 1 1/2 years, I still find myself advancing with her DVDs.  I like her music (especially in the 6-week Walk Strong) and love that she does the moderate, her mom does the easy, and Beth does an advanced version of all the moves.

I used to think how great it would be to take ballet or other grace enhancing classes--no need to look further. Jessica has the grace and beauty of movement as a ballerina and incorporates Pilates, Yoga,  Ballet, and gym-equipment moves into her sessions. I've done other strength training but found it boring. I love how her videos keep you moving even when doing boring biceps curls.

I stopped going to the gym (where I had a personal trainer) 3 times a week and find I get more out of my (3-5 times/week) staying home with Jessica.  And when I don't have the strength to do a full 30 minutes, her 15 minute workouts are perfect to keep me in the groove.",1483488000,,1510,4.39426523297491

I didn't want to go crazy and only eat a handful of leaves every day. I wanted something that I could do for the rest of my life and still have a life. Jessica's dvds are both easy and challenging. She's not really annoying like most instructors. She's real and fun and her mom and Beth crack me up. I have more muscle tone in my legs, arms and abs. I've went down 3 sizes and I feel a lot better and Jessica's walk on program got me there.",1477180800,9,617,3.9047619047619047

It's not bad on the body and muscles you have not used or forgot you had are awaken.  I had muscles wake up, a little soreness but the more I worked out the soreness was gone.  I would recommend it to anyone at any age.  I want to be mobile forever.  I feel this gives the chance to do just that.",1476835200,3,457,3.870967741935484

After a recent back injury, I needed to scale down my intense workouts. I bought this as a suggestion from a friend and was blown away. You work out hard, but smart.

Up to about 2 months ago, the only exercise I got was working my horse out twice a week. A couple of months ago, I realized that if I wanted to start competing on my horse, I'd need to be more fit, so I started doing half hour workouts every morning, alternating various DVDs I had. I stumbled on this series in an effort to add variety and thought I'd give her a try.

This has been a perfect fit for me. It's doable, and easy enough on my ankles that I'm not concerned about injury. Best, the workouts target areas I really need for riding, strengthening my core and enhancing balance. I really like the count down clock -- I've never liked working out, and knowing that I just have X amount of time left often gives me the push to finish.

I also appreciate that every part of the body is worked -- I have weak ankles and tight shins and have not found any workout that included these areas in the exercise -- these do! Since ankles and shins are an important part of good equitation, I really appreciate that they are thoughtfully included in the workouts.

I'm not sure my other DVDs are going to get much play time... this series has really fit my goals and challenged me to work harder than I've been doing up til now.",1476316800,4,1442,4.271062271062271

Without changing my diet at all I have dropped down to my high school weight.  This is great.  And, YOU DON'T GET BORED!  The workouts are over before you even know it.  And, Jessica's cueing is great and she is fun to work out with.  I like that she incorporates weights in  a lot of the workouts.

I've been off the exercise wagon far too long, and this has been an effective way to get back in the groove. I enjoy Jessica's style (and humor) and, as others have commented, there's no dread factor. Her cueing is spot on, she provides modifications to meet a range of fitness levels, and she encourages and motivates. (Plus I don't find her the least bit annoying!)

 After only one week, I can already see and feel a difference. (My mood is better, I feel stronger, and I've lost a few inches -- what's not to love?)

Best of all, I think this a program (and an instructor) I can stick with.

Finally, the package arrived on schedule, and I was impressed with the personalized follow-up... Nice touch.",1474502400,2,858,4.5519480519480515

3) There are modifications, which can be helpful for those who have previous injuries
4) Jessica is energetic, engaging, and motivating.
5) The workouts are fun
6) I love that the overall program has variety that includes strength training, cardio, balance, and stretching
7) The program is easy to follow
8) The web page has a lot of good information.

I have done numerous beachbody programs, pilates programs, and many more but nothing quite compares. I do not, however, do these alone because mentally 30 minutes is not enough for me to feel satisfied. I combine these workouts with cardio or Barre classes at the gym. I have noticed increased muscle strength in my arms and my legs are becoming more slim and tone. I love love love her workouts and started as You Tube user but I like the schedule layout. I also recently got the 21 Day DVD system and I have been combining some of those also which I LOVE!

My only dislike is I wish there was only 1 like ""rest day""-- dynamic stretch and prehab routine are very basic and mild and you do not break a sweat.

Perfect system for someone who wants to tone, but, you really need to hold yourself accountable and PUSH yourself or you may not see much results in a short 30 minute day.

Thanks Jessica for being a wonderful online trainer, I will never do burpees, high rep HIIT plyometrics again since I know those workouts are not for me! I tried it all, and you are the best and you give results.",1473984000,,1236,4.412280701754386

This year I've been set back with a 10 lb weight gain from medication used to treat my overactive thyroid. I knew I needed some new DVD's to challenge myself as my older DVD's were stale. I was concerned that this being a lower impact workout DVD might not be enough to challenge me. The Cardio Party seemed easy but then we moved on to the other segments. Whoa! I have now completed my 4th week and while I've only lost a couple of pounds I can tell I am getting even more toned. I noticed last night that my shoulders were wider and I couldn't believe it. The Lower Body Toning segment will kick your rear end. I haven't been sore from a workout in a while so I know I'm doing something right. On days when I feel like I can workout longer I will do a second workout or actually clean up around the house for a change. The Brain Fitness segment is a lot of fun but you still work. The Tai Chi inspired segment on the Fusion Sculpt is awesome. I definitely want to check Tai Chi out. I love, love, love the calendar and look forward to each day's workout. I'm enjoying the DVD so much I've already ordered the next DVD's in the next phase of the 6 week transformation plan. I plan to go on to Phase II after that.",1472169600,,1383,4.125925925925926

Incorporating hatha yoga positions and a little bit of tai chi is also a plus. You will not get bored at all, with the way she sequenced the routines.

7541312,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I have been doing this program for 3 weeks now--halfway point. I have been using the Jessica Smith Youtube videos (along with other Youtube videos) for last 3 years and had great results. However, I was looking for a schedule to follow after hitting a plateau. I decided to go with this system because I like Jessica's videos and I wanted to 'give back' after all the free videos I have used from her.
I was not expecting these videos to be incredibly demanding, and for the most part I was right--I say for the most because I am noticing that when you feel like 'hey not so bad'--you are dripping with sweat!!! I also have slight soreness the day after heavy lifting but not awful, which is really nice.
But what about mid way results?!? (note--I did not really watch what I was eating too carefully during these three weeks--actually had a few 'big nights ;) )
Well-first off I want to preface that I am in the lower to normal weight range--I am a size 0 so I was not expecting huge changes, but I did do measurements and found I lost a total of three inches--mainly in abs, hips and thighs. I know this may not seem like a lot, but for 30 minutes a day, 6 times a week for 3 weeks without really following a strict diet plan for my height--that's good. Much better than my static weight that seemed to refuse to budge!
On the videos--I actually like all of them. I was thinking there would be a few that I would not care for, but I really enjoyed them. I think my favorite might be the barefoot fusion--you think it's so easy, but you are breathing heavy and need a towel to wipe off that sweat! I also liked the brain fitness--mainly because I am so busy focusing on the moves that I can't look at the clock. (yes, there is a countdown clock!). The Interval one is the hardest for me--but I feel great when it's done!
I am planning to be better about my food choices in the next three weeks and hope to post an update after.
One final note--if you are out of shape or in shape--it works. Jessica's mom has very modified options and Jessica and Beth do more advanced--I like to think I am in pretty good shape, and it challenges me--just enough :)

If anything, this program is good at keeping you active for thirty minutes a day.
Although the DVDs are not high quality, like some viewers have said, it is not bad quality. Jessica creates the videos on her own, to me it is worth the price. I look forward to trying more of her programs in the future.
Only suggestion I have for the videos is that I wished it quickly referenced on the packaging what exercise equipment you need. So you could get it ready before you started the video.

It is a joy to watch her interact with her and further strengthens my faith in her commitment to other people's well-being. I also like that she peoples her videos with women who are closer to my age and level of fitness. It makes the exercises seem doable. Providing a 6-week schedule of a diverse range of exercises is also highly motivating. I can easily get de-motivated by either having to map out a routine for myself or follow someone else's routine that is rote and repetitive. She has created a great mix of exercises that are different enough to maintain my interest. I also like being able to check off the ""I did it!"" circle after every exercise session. That sort of thing doesn't usually motivate me, but it is so in line with her positive, empowering approach, that I enjoy doing it.

I probably have one hundred exercise videos from all sorts of different trainers, but the ones I constantly reach for are from Jessica Smith.  Jessica's personality and style of training are very encouraging.  None of the moves are too hard or difficult to follow, but I always break a sweat.  Each video in this series is only 30 minutes, which is just long enough.  When I'm finished, I feel great and worked, but not overworked.  This is a program that you could work out to every day of the week. It has your cardio, your weights and your stretching.  Very impressed with Jessica again!",1468713600,,710,4.587301587301587

Before this system I was doing Jessica's ""Walk On 21 Day Weight Loss"" & ""Walking for Weight Loss, Wellness & Energy"" which are also excellent programs.  I am so impressed with her gifted ability in teaching and have learned so much that I just placed an order for more of her DVDs: ""Walk Weight Off 30 Day Plan"", ""15 Minutes Fast Fat Blast"", ""10,000 Steps Weight Loss"", ""Burn Fat & Have Fun"", ""6 Mile Mix"", & ""Boost Metabolism & Muscles"".  I hope other older people will realize they can improve their health and have fun at the same time with Jessica's at home DVD programs.

7541335,5,B0187Z2IR2,"Just when you think you don't want to exercise, you remember you have a virtual ladies meet up with these wonderful gals who are working out with you (in real time on a recorded video) on your schedule, but on a 6 week plan designed by Jessica Smith.
Jessica is encouraging, delightful, engaging and professional.  Along with the assistance of Debbie and Beth, Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced levels are clearly presented.
Build your strength, stamina and overall health with these ladies and have fun.
Life is too short and these gals are too sweet.  I for one don't like pain or beration. Insanity need not enter the picture. Make no mistake, the classes are challenging, but in a good way.  As Jessica would say, (and I paraphrase) That sweat on your brow those are beads of pride!  You can do this.

Here is how the 6 week plan works:

Make a commitment to yourself.
-You CAN carve out 30 minutes a day for Yourself.  If I can, you can.

Purchase the videos.
-Think of it this way.  10 classes at $6 a class, for the first time you do them, then free for the rest of first 6 weeks, then next 6 weeks, then the next, and so on.  Cheaper than a gym, and much less intimidating. Much, much, much less.

Show up and do the classes.
-The ladies will be there for you, showing you all sorts of modifications.  There is room for progression and many ways to challenge yourself at your own pace.
There is a countdown clock, which is a helpful reminder that you won't be doing each class  f o r e v e r.  That said, Jessica adorably makes it go by quickly, and makes it fun, and cheers you on, and on, and on.  Challenging and enjoyable exercise IS possible.

Feel accomplished.
-Slow and steady wins the race. Little steps every day will build your strength and stamina and good health. Rome wasn't built in a day.  Life is not an edited reality show.  Progress takes time and if you do just a little bit consistently, youve made progress.  You deserve it.  You can do this. You can do this.  You can do this!

Classes in a Nutshell:

Cardio Party:  A bunch of amazing ladies showed up for this and they're waiting for you to join in for 30 minutes of movement. Go at your own pace and level. You can do it.

Interval Mix: Jessica and Debbie and Beth are there with you for this HIIT challenge.  No need to be intimidated.  Move at your own pace and do what you can. Jessica will remind you.  You can do it.

360 Abs: It may sound a bit scary, but I lived to tell and it is not. You can do this workout.

Brain Fitness Fun:  Cardio meet up with the ladies.  If you get some or all the moves wrong the first time, who cares.  Jessica doesnt.  She is glad you are there.  Moving, having fun, being silly, working your brain and beautiful self (yes, you) and geting 30 minutes of exercise for your heart, mind grapes and spirit.  You can do this.

Barefoot Fusion:  Want to work on your balance? Endurance? Flexibility? I do.  I did.  Hey, I still do.  You can do this class.

Total Body Training:  YES!
Upper Body Strength:  YES!
Lower Body Sculpt:  YES!
The amazing side effect of these 3 classes: You are going to get stronger. Your parts will get toned.
And no, you don't to do them all in one day.  Jessica's schedule will tell you which day youll be doing what.
You can do it.

Dynamic Stretch:  Just follow Jessica.  Stretching is just as important as working out. A DYNAMIC element you need.  See how I did that?  If you want healthy results, you have to relax and stretch, too.  You can do this.

Prehab Routine:  This is everything you would be doing for yourself at physical therapy. A reminder to not forget all the parts you may not think about.  Give yourself some extra TLC.  You can slow down and do this.

Did I mention you can do this?  You can do this.  Enjoy.

Oh, and THANK YOU, Jessica!!! Thank you for everything you have contributed to the health and well-being of others. AND Debbie and Beth and the ladies of the cardio party. It is an honor and a treat to exercise with you every day.",1468108800,20,4008,4.314939434724091

Between clean eating, cutting way back on sugar, getting my thyroid straightened out, and doing so many different workouts I have lost around 30 lbs since New Years Day.  Now I need to maintain the loss. The only thing I didn't like about the workouts werevNew Age elements like Tai Chi, so I just skip those parts.

I love the calendar that plans what workout to do each day, and the fact that it is only 30 minutes has made it easier to fit into my busy schedule.  The workouts are all so varied that it keeps me motivated as I am not doing the same thing repeatedly.  I also like the fact that there are modifications to make some of the exercises less strenuous as I have issues with my knees and back so I can still receive the benefits without injuring myself.",1466726400,12,574,4.2

I exercise every day and am fit but last year I developed plantar fasciitis due to too much running/power walking.  Since then I have had to dampen my cardio and focus on strength and toning.  I thought my cardio days were over....until I found Jessica.  I love her low impact (but still effective) routines.

7541353,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I've been a fan of Jessica Smith's workouts for several years. This set is no different. The workouts have realistic space requirements, use minimal equipment, and are well designed. These workouts are designed so that you can grow and get stronger within the program. You can start out with the lowest impact with Jessica's mom Debbie, go mid level, or go more advanced. You can also combine the three levels for different areas. The workouts really try to impact the whole body. I enjoy the cardio workouts a lot but I like the strength workouts as well. The good part about the strength workouts are that there are several posture checks to help avoid injury. The ""Brain Fitness Fun"" challenges the mind and the body. That is something I really like about Jessica's workouts is that she talks about how fitness is a total body experience and she works hard to create fun workouts that you even look forward to doing.
I'm about half way through the program. I already have noticed that  several muscle groups are even stronger, improved balance, and better endurance.

There is more floor work then I personally prefer due to my current workout space.  I have mixed feelings about the clock mainly because I think the sign of an enjoyable workout is that I'm not watching the clock.",1466467200,,1284,4.748878923766816

Jessica teaches the exercises and keeps you motivated and concentrating on the task at hand.

For various reasons I decided to work out at home 3 years ago and that is when I found Jessica's youtube workouts. I decided to commit to her Walk Strong program as I was in a fitness rut and needed a stricter program to help me stay on track.  I am in the 4th week of the program and I can attest that this has helped me immensely.  These video's are 30 minutes in length.  I take 30 min first thing in the morning which helps me jump start my day.  I never find myself exhausted during the day or at the end of my day.  The title of this program is extremely misleading which is why I didn't buy it when it first came out.  These videos are both cardio and strengthening based.  Some of the videos are strictly using weights for strengthening which is key to any fitness program, as well as other videos without weights focusing more on cardio.  There is also an excellent stretching video.  All of these make it a well balanced program.  I have more motivation to eat healthy which promotes additional body toning.  Jessica's instruction and her philosophy behind fitness are spot on.  I have had many different fitness instructors in my life time and she is at the top of the list.  I highly recommend this program - don't be fooled by the name 'Walk Strong' but key in on the 'Total Transformation System' in the title!",1466380800,4,1444,4.319702602230484

I became depressed and just didn't have the energy to retain my activity level.  As a result , I gained weight and lost strength and confidence.  I was looking for a workout routine to kickstart me at 57 years of age and chose the Walk Strong program. I am so pleased to say that it has been an absolute winner in getting me motivated and back on track. I have resumed hiking and feel my body getting stronger.  I appreciate Jessica's energy, style, and approach and am so glad my attention was turned to this workout series.  I was beginning to wonder if I would ever get motivated to increase my fitness level , but with Walk Strong and Jessica , it's been fun to return to working out again.

7541358,5,B0187Z2IR2,"Walk Strong: 6 Week Total Transformation has been my go-to exercise DVD for 6 months now, for just 30-40 minutes a day 3-4 days a week.  I have felt quite an improvement in balance, posture, muscle tone and stamina.
I am an active 62 yr old woman that's about 10 lbs overweight.  I work as a potter and a ceramic technician at a metro community college, so I am always using my muscles.  However, I started feeling my balance wasn't what it used to be and I was feeling tired, so my New Year's Resolution was to find a at-home DVD that I really could go back to day after day and not feel I could only do 1/2 of it comfortably and also not hurt myself.  I started with Jessica on YouTube for about a week and then spent the money for the DVD.
Six months later, my energy level is way up, posture is good automatically, balance, thank goodness, is there again, muscle tone is back (hate that flabby arm look!).  I feel like I could run a marathon, but probably will never go that far!
In the last few months, I've added to my library of Walk Strong DVD's.  Some I like more than others.  Jessica Smith has made DVD's that I can do day-after-day for the foreseeable future.  The important thing is to take care of your body as you get older and finding the right exercise is crucial to that.  Thanks Jessica!",1466035200,5,1306,4.255060728744939

7541367,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I recently purchased the 6 Week Total Transformation System plus the 5 Mile Walk that can be customized after watching a couple of the free Jessica Smith routines on U-tube.  I am totally impressed.  Having done Leslie Sansone (good but boring and sometimes not challenging enough) and Jane Fonda (old and new ones, which I still like to do when I want something less strenuous), I finally found exactly what I need in Jessica Smith.  I first came across her name in reading one of the reviews on a Jane Fonda DVD.  Jessica Smith gives great instructions, explains what certain moves do, works me until I sweat (a level I cannot get to by just walking), and the moves are fun and most of them not too complicated.  I am recovering from a bout of knee arthritis and her routines actually help strengthen my knees.  I am 67 and diabetic and rely on walking to bring down blood sugar spikes.  Her customizable 5-mile walk DVD is perfect for that purpose.  I keep my continuous glucose monitor next to the DVD player and that determines how many miles I need to walk to bring down the glucose but not get low.  I am on an insulin pump.  Walking/exercising really help bring down the blood glucose spikes much more quickly than just insulin alone.  I am 5 days into the 6 Week program and I don't think I will have any problem sticking with it.  I also appreciate an email from Jessica with an attachment for the rotation for the next six weeks!  Also, it helps to curb my late night eating because now I look forward to exercising at night instead of eating.  I rarely write reviews but feel I need to pay back all the wonderful people who write reviews that I use all the time.  I believe Jessica Smith is my answer to improving my health.  Thank you, Jessica, for doing a great job!",1464825600,13,1780,4.430769230769231

7541369,5,B0187Z2IR2,I have tried numerous work out programs and this is the FIRST one that actually makes me want to come back and complete my exercise every day. I have the poster hanging on my wall and being able to check off each work out is so rewarding. The workouts allow you to scaffold as your skills and strength improve. Jessica has just the right amount of energy to keep you going through the 30 minute work out! It's challenging and fun. I would definitely recommend this program to anyone who wants to begin working out or someone who needs to get back in the swing of working out since this has a calendar and holds you accountable! I couldn't be happier with my purchase and I plane to complete phase 2 and buy the add on programs as soon as this 6 week transformation is completed! :),1464480000,,781,4.319727891156463
7541370,5,B0187Z2IR2,"Just finished Day 12 of the 6 Week Countdown -- the first time I've stayed on plan for more than 5 days in a row in more than a year.  Thank you, Jessica!!!  Thank you for the great workouts that don't let my mind wander, but also don't get me lost.  This is as close as it gets to having personal trainer at home.  Some of the workouts feel easy, but leave me relaxed and flexible.  Others really challenge me.  On some I can do the advanced options; on others I have to drop back to the easy options for part of the workout.  For most, I can stay with the middle option.  It's great to have choices, so that I don't outgrow these workouts as I get stronger.  The chart that comes with the videos is part of the success.  There's a written plan so that I can't accidentally talk myself into something easier.  This was definitely worth the investment.",1464393600,2,852,4.229813664596273

7541378,5,B0187Z2IR2,"Fun, effective workouts. My abs are on fire after doing the Total Body Training. The Cardio excersises are fun; they keep me motivated. Another thing I find useful is the calendar and tips, all included in the DVD set.",1463616000,,218,4.615384615384615
7541379,5,B0187Z2IR2,"This is my second Jessica Smith DVD that I have purchased, and I will probably buy more.  The workouts can be adapted to any level of fitness, and they go by so fast you don't feel like you are exercising.  Jessica is so upbeat and seems to genuinely care about her audience.  If an exercise DVD works and you look forward to doing it, it's a keeper.
Follow-up:  I am now into my fourth week of this series, and my only criticism would be that many of the routines call for a ""sturdy chair"".  The chairs used in the video are perfect for the exercises but very few people are going to have chairs like that.  I have been trying to make do with an antique ladder back chair and it just doesn't work that well and is even a bit dangerous.  You have to have a chair to do the routines so on those days I feel a bit cheated because I couldn't participate in all of the exercises.",1463443200,,875,4.1117647058823525
7541380,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I'm not a gym person.  I've been an at-home exerciser for more than 20 years (and I've amassed over 200 workout DVDs in that time).  The majority of my workouts are Cathe Friedrich and The Firm, but I'm always on the lookout for something new.  I've read a lot of positive things about Jessica Smith on videofitnessforum, so I decided to give this set a try.

First, I'll start with the negative, which for me is really only one thing:  the stretches at the end of the workouts are too short.  I understand the time constraints of a 30 minute workout, but now that I'm in my 40's my body needs (demands!) longer stretches.  This is pretty easily remedied, I just did my own series of stretches at the end.

There are essentially three cardio workouts:  CARDIO PARTY, INTERVAL MIX, and BRAIN FITNESS FUN.  The choreography is a little more challenging than say, Leslie Sansone, but I didn't find it too complicated.  There is always a modifier showing how to make it low impact, which I appreciate.  Brain Fitness Fun was pretty unique and definitely doesn't let the mind wander.

There are three strength workouts:  TOTAL BODY TRAINING, UPPER BODY STRENGTH, and LOWER BODY SCULPT.  I loved that these weren't just the same old moves, it felt new and fresh.

There are two stretch workouts:  DYNAMIC STRETCH, which was fantastic.  For me, it's the perfect thing to add on after a tough workout.  PREHAB ROUTINE is kind of an injury prevention workout, and like Dynamic Stretch it made me feel great afterword.

The two remaining workouts are:  360 ABS, which could also be catagorized as a cardio workout.  It definitely got my heart rate up!  I loved that it wasn't endless crunches, it's mostly standing, with a good amount of kickboxing thrown in.  BAREFOOT FUSION SCULPT was the one workout that had me constantly checking the time.  It was challenging for me.  It's a lot of balance work and ballet-type stuff.  And that is exactly the type of workout I need to do more often.  I think I'll grow to like it more as I get better at it.

JESSICA SMITH is a great instructor.  She cues well and is motivating and encouraging without being too over-the-top about it.  She puts emphasis on exercise being good for health/mind/body, not just how great you'll look in a bikini.  The workouts were well thought out and the moves felt unique and fresh.  This set was well worth the investment for me.",1463443200,5,2395,4.639618138424821
7541381,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I have been active all of my life either in sports, running, the gym, yoga, and zumba. Normally I am not a fan of ""at home"" videos, but this one intrigued me and I am glad I tried something different. I love it! This set allows me the workouts I enjoy by combining strength training, cardio, and stretching all together and I don't sacrifice that time with my family (I work it in post-""lunchmaking"" in the mornings before leaving for the 40-hour work week). All three of my kids (ages 6, 7, and 11) have jumped in and have worked out with me! My youngest didn't want to leave for kindergarten this morning... To those that work 40+ hours, yes - you can do this! 30 minutes is gone in a flash! I really like how the workout feels lower intensity, but man on man do you feel it afterwards. It hurts so good! And the calendar is a bonus. I never look ahead to see what's next so I'm pleasantly surprised every morning.",1463356800,2,916,4.2701149425287355

I aim to exercise 6 days a week and vary my routine. I do water aerobics, spin class, and yoga. I love being able to do your walking/interval workouts at home at my convenience. I also love that you include your Mom in the videos. My daughter and I are very close, but she lives in Portland, Oregon so our visits are limited to 2-3 times a year.
In my late 30's and 40's I taught step and low impact movement classes utilizing weights. I have always been very alignment and safety conscious and concerned.

I so appreciate your expertise, style, enthusiasm and attention to all of the elements that motivate and encourage people. Kudos to you! Keep it up! I'll continue on this path with you.

I'm traveling 90 min to 2 hrs 5 days a week to watch my
Granddaughter.
I only have about 1/2 hr , sometimes 60 min to workout. So I needed workouts that gave me those options and that made me feel I was accomplishing something.
These fit the bill. I always feel like I've worked out longer and I feel fit.",1462320000,,454,4.055555555555555

I am only on Day 5, but I am quite familiar with Jessica's workouts from YouTube,  and I have no doubt that all the workouts on this DVD set will be of excellent quality, and also FUN!  I appreciate many things about Jessica's work, but here are the main ones:  1)She helps build strength without breaking down the body!  This may sound like an obvious point, but not one to be skipped over...it is so essential.  2)The workouts are VARIED...and consider the role of change and variety to keep us fully alive and engaged in life.  Introducing variety in our thought and movement patterns takes us out of our automatic, conditioned pathways,  and we experience new possibilities for body and mind. 3)Jessica is a genuine encourager and an excellent teacher.  She talks us through each step, for example starting with leg movements, then adding arms, then making the move more challenging...all in manageable steps...and pretty soon the whole body is involved....brain, too!  4)Jessica is a very knowledgeable trainer, and I have no doubt that in developing this collection of workouts she has taken into account every move and muscle needed keep the body working well.  It is also mood-enhancing.  Thank you, Jessica!",1462233600,,1260,4.947619047619048

Some of the workouts were pretty tough, but I find after a few times through, although the challenge remains,completing them with proper form, technique, and speed become more achievable each time. I find that 30 minutes is usually not enough, so I typically do another Jessica Smith 15-20 minute workout, or if I'm really ambitious and have the time, I do 2-30 minute sessions. Always feel that I can combine them so I can focus on cardio AND resistance training or muscle toning.",1461369600,2,493,4.8

There are some nice low impact walking workouts (as is suggested by the name), but the strength workouts are surprisingly intense! I actually appreciate that a lot because it allows my body to have a variety of different workouts and keeps me on my toes. I've been following the recommended workout plan that is included with the DVDs, but it would be easy to create your own schedule as well since there are so many workouts in this one program.

I needed to find something that still gave me a decent workout, but wouldn't kill my knees. I bought a couple of other Jessica Smith DVDs and really enjoyed them and felt that they were pretty good workouts and weren't too hard on my knees. I decided to try some more of her DVDs and opted to get this set. I'm finishing week 2 and have done all of the workouts and I have to say that I like it better than I thought I would. There's a really great mix of strength, cardio and stretch in this plan. Since she included a chart to follow, you don't have to try and figure out which workout to do which day. When you finish the 6 weeks, if you go to her website she has another 6 week plan that you can print out. That plan has workouts from this set of DVDs and has suggested workouts from previously released ones that you can do as well, but even if you don't have those workouts you can use what you do have. I would have to say that this program is doable for anybody. There are modifications shown to make it easier or harder so you can tailor it to your needs.

I tried her barefoot fusion walk and I have been hooked ever since. I love her variety and her upbeat personality and of course her sidekick Peanut is hilarious! I just purchased her Walk Strong 6 week transformation system, and as usual she delivers. I haven't done all the workouts yet but so far Cardio Party, Total Body Training, and Brain Fitness Fun are all energizing and motivating. I love that they are all 30 minutes which is very doable and challenging but not so hard that it becomes discouraging and you start avoiding doing them. I finish feeling pleasantly tired and satisfied that I've completed a demanding workout. I highly recommend anyone who wants an enjoyable experience getting fit to purchase this system.

I am 57, I am at an intermediate fitness level. I wanted a program that was 30 minutes long, but got the job done.  This is it.  I follow the calendar that comes with this set and it is a no brainier.  I feel like every muscle was touched when I am done.  I feel better, sleep better and know that I am going to be able to move as I age if I use this program.  There was a lot of thought put into this program and it shows.

7541416,5,B0187Z2IR2,"Having already worked out with Jessica Smith - online and with other DVD purchases, I knew this series would be fun, effective and well-researched. It is all that and more!
I completed the 6-week program and lost 13 lbs and several inches - improving my strength, endurance and balance. There is so much variety that I was never bored. The only workout I did not enjoy is the cardio party routine  - it was not enough of a challenge for me and Jessica seemed a little tense. I chose to substitute one of her other workouts on these days.
I loved the other 9 workouts (yeah lower body sculpt - you'll feel it; 360 abs - sweating while toning the abs) but want to comment on a couple of unusual workouts: barefoot fusion sculpt - a surprisingly challenging barefoot toning session; brain fitness fun - a moderate intensity cardio workout which challenges your brain; and the preventive/joint protecting prehab workout.  Jessica remains on the cutting edge of exercise science but is never preachy  - she is smart, motivating and fun to spend time with!",1460937600,15,1050,4.695652173913044

7541421,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I have never been much for exercising, but knew that I had to make some positive changes in my life.  I tried another on-line instructor and although I enjoyed it, I found it a little frustrating and hard on the knees.  Through a reference in a Canadian magazine, I found Jessica's Videos on-line and really, really enjoyed them.  When I go home, I don't have the same internet access as now (I am on vacation), so I decided that I wanted a program I could follow that and I tried Walk Strong:  6 Week Total.  It has been fulfilling my hopes.  I am on Day 24 and I feel so much better then before.  I have started combining my scheduled day (example Day 22 is Total Body Training) with another program (Cardio Party or one of her JessicaSmithTV programs) to enhance the program more.  I am seeing a big difference as the weight is finally, slowly coming off and more importantly, so are the inches.  Best of all, I am feeling so much better.  Jessica won't be for everyone, but I like her attitude that she wants you to challenge yourself, but listen to your body.  There are multiple levels to make it work for you.  I also really like that her Mom is in the video as well as an extremely fit mature friend.  I just wish Peanut (her dog) was it them.",1460332800,3,1251,4.294871794871795

I very much like the emphasis on both mental and physical health . I look forward to each session and hope to continue beyond",1460246400,,162,4.258064516129032
7541423,5,B0187Z2IR2,"Just amazing so far!! I have fallen in love with Jessica's sweet personality! Her videos are so fun and the time flies! I don't feel like I'm exercising. I'm having  a blast, and I can hardly move I'm so sore...In a good way. What a doll she is and she is totally dedicated to having fun and getting you results without boring you! This program is exceptional...the best I have ever used.
Also note that it is amazing for people with back, hip or knee issues. Very low impact...no bouncing around.  There is even a brain/body exercise I did yesterday! I have already shared with all of my loved ones, especially my mom who has a sore back.  I'm excited for each new day and new exercise.
Jessica's support is unbelievable.  Very quick to respond to any emails I have sent.
Each video from start to finish is 30 minutes so there is no guessing on the time. Love the calendar to keep you on track and if you wish to keep going to sends you a continuing calendar for after the first 6 weeks!",1460246400,7,988,4.324324324324325
7541424,4,B0187Z2IR2,"I really like the different workouts.. not much sweating but I feel it really works the muscles. The only thing I would have liked was to know what was coming up instead of learning the moves as you do them; this said it will only take one time to know what it coming. I have foot issues so it is hard for me to find good workouts. This set is very well worth the money...enjoy and lets get skinny :)

7541425,5,B0187Z2IR2,This is a great program for everyone from beginner to advanced.  I like that this is a balanced program and includes brain training.  I hadn't been exercising for some time and I had decided I need to get healthy.  I am in my 60s and intent to live a productive life for quite a few more years.  I love Jessica's attitude of progress not perfection to be the best you can be!  Another reason I bought this program is because it doesn't include a diet plan.  Everyone knows how to eat healthy and who can stick to one any way!  Thanks Jessica for this super program.,1460073600,3,565,4.273584905660377
7541426,5,B0187Z2IR2,"As a total beginnner I can follow this and the pace is good.  I like that it isn't overwhelming to get into.  Also it encourages what I can do and keeps me motivated to try what I can't.  I also like the clear plan for what to do day to day.  And I appreciate the emails that gave me another calendar for the second 6 weeks.  It is what I need, someone putting together a plan for how to get into shape.  I believe with this pace I will get in shape without giving up before I get there. Thanks.  .",1460073600,4,498,3.871287128712871

I am not overweight, but rather, would like to become stronger and just more physically active. I used to do the Jillian Michael's 30 day shred, and I came to absolutely DREAD doing those workouts. I got burnt out very quickly! I don't feel that way with Jessica. Jessica's workouts are enjoyable, but not balls-to-the-wall hard & difficult to get through. Don't get me wrong, they are still challenging, and if you start out as an exercise newbie like I have, you will be sore the next day! I love that there is a different routine to do every day. It will never get boring! Some days are definitely tougher than others, and on the ""lighter"" routine days, I will usually supplement my workout by doing one of Jessica's youtube walk videos (which are awesome, btw, and how I discovered her in the first place). When I finish this series, I plan to start on a new one, and I have and will continue to recommend Jessica's videos to everyone.",1459987200,4,1082,4.46969696969697

The time is clearly ticking away on the video and I do 2- 30 minute videos instead of my 50 minute walk. I can't believe how I feel when I am working out, it feels great! I think the music is great-very motivating! I also think I am building my body instead of just losing weight without wondering where the sags are going to form.

I found out about her video watching the 10 minute workout from Spark People. So glad I did.  Ready to go do one of her workouts in the basement right now. I would highly recommend her video!",1459987200,3,682,4.074626865671642

The workouts are so interesting. I don't get bored. They are challenging yet doable, with modifiers to make the moves both easier or harder, depending on your fitness level. These workouts focus more on weight training in addition to cardio, which was exactly what I was looking for. My weight loss and body condition has changed noticeably after just 10 days. I can't wait until I'm finished with the entire program. I will be ordering her others to try.",1459814400,4,582,4.605769230769231

They are great for beginners as well as advanced excercisers- to increase intensity just increase your weights or do the advanced variation of the routine.

Jessica's workouts are the best!  They are easy to follow, you can adjust your workout to challenge yourself or make it a little easier for days you just don't feel like doing anything.  I love that the workouts are 30 minutes because if it were any longer, I probably wouldn't do them.  Each workout is different and targets different parts of your body or your total body.  It may be too easy for some people but I don't enjoy doing difficult moves or moves that are too fast that I can't keep up.

I decided to try this because my Mom who is 58 bought it and she told me about it. I liked that it was only 30 minutes and I heard it was harder then Leslie's so I decided to try it. Most of the workouts in this program are difficult but not super hard. I like that because I needed to step it up. I've done 3 weeks and I've noticed my body changing, not drastically but my thighs and butt and arms look better. Some workouts are so hard I need to pause and take a breather but that only shows me that I am pushing myself past what I was used to, which is good. I think I'm going to do this in addition to Leslie's DVDs so that I can gain some walking miles and weight train (with these). Definitely not a disappointment.",1458691200,5,821,3.892857142857143

I have done MANY of the Beachbody workouts and was looking for something a little bit different.  I started Walk Strong a week and a half ago.  I can tell you that I have never been more happy with a program in my life.  I love the fact that she has more of a wellness approach instead of kill yourself to get healthy approach.  I love the music, the energy and just the positive way she does things.  It looks simple until you are doing it but don't let that fool you.  It is still a very effective workout and you have fun doing it.  It has inspired me so much that I also ordered the 21 day program, the 30 day walk it off set and the 15 minute workouts.

She is not phony or fake and she doesn't push you like a jerky trainer. She seems very personable and genuine. She makes you feel good about yourself and it honestly seems like she is happy that you join her every day- and you want to keep coming back.  She always says- working out is about making yourself feel good. It's not about 6 pack abs or looking good in a swim suit- it's about feeling better about yourself- and having some fun!  And when you feel better- you look better. And she's right. I have stuck with her workouts every day- done her different programs- and when I finish one- I start up another or repeat the series I just went through. This set has so much variety that it's hard to get bored- because there are so many options. I love that she includes a workout plan for the 6 weeks- I usually try to stick with that- but sometimes I switch things around- there's lots of flexibility. So far of all her workouts- I like this series the best. And I love that her mom and her friend Beth are in all her workouts- sometimes I go with Beth who does the more advanced options- and sometimes I have to go with her mom because of my ankle fusion surgery.  I just can't bend certain ways- but I certainly try.  But most of the time I can stick with Jessica- she's very middle of the road. I would highly recommend this series to anyone- whether just starting out or even more advanced. She's not going to push you too far or work you until you break- so if that's what you are looking for- don't buy this.  If you are used to P90X or something along those lines- you won't be satisfied with these workouts. These are 30 minutes and you're done. So if you are short on time or have a packed schedule- you can fit this in somewhere in your day- and feel great afterwards. You won't be wiped- you will feel energized. Thanks, Jessica for another great series! Keep going- can't wait to see what comes out next!",1457136000,5,2046,4.27390180878553
7541479,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I love Jessica Smith's workout videos. Previously I had only used the ones on her YouTube channel. I love her upbeat and positive attitude. It is very encouraging to me. I don't really love (or really like) working out, but she makes it fun and interesting.

I purchased this set mainly because it came with a calendar of what video to do each day. It was great for accountability since I put it on the fridge and my husband could tell if I had or had not worked out. (he loves working out and loves seeing me get healthy and fit).

The videos are varied. Some are easier, some are harder. Each has ways you can make it more or less challenging depending on your fitness level.

I didn't see any change physically after doing the program, but I didn't make any other changes to my diet/lifestyle. I did feel better and like I was standing up taller after doing the program.

I will continue to use these videos along with the YouTube videos. Love, love, love Jessica!",1457049600,2,967,4.415730337078652

I have been doing walking DVD's for several years and they had become stale to the point I did not want to do them.  I am excited to work out again.  In 30 minutes of doing a Jessica walk, I get more of a workout than doing a 4-5 mile walk with the other walk leader.  I am a very happy customer!",1457049600,6,364,3.9315068493150687

It is very easy to do, and it's great when you don't want to exercise, but you really should so that you can get off of the couch when you are older.  I will keep it in my library of workout DVD's for future use, because I think it would be better for folks who are really new to exercise or don't want an intense workout.  There is one DVD though called Barefoot Fusion Sculpt, and I wold do that workout every Sunday.  It is both relaxing and taxing on my muscles.",1456963200,,532,4.135922330097087

I wasn't sedentary to begin and these short workouts (approx. 30 minutes each) really work up a sweat! I have used other Jessica Smith workouts and they are awesome too.

This morning I started the first day and as expected, it's a fun, fast way to get my exercise done for the day. I really like how positive and encouraging Jessica is as an instructor, and I *especially* like that her supporting cast are all regular people - not super-mega-ripped ""fitness professionals."" Extra bonus: a lot of her moves really get my brain working to, reinforcing the brain/body connection. I feel like I'm becoming more agile and physically capable as I move. These are fun, down-to-earth workouts that anybody can do to feel stronger and more fit every day. I highly recommend this instructor and any of her workouts!",1456617600,2,769,4.7894736842105265

This workout is made for you, no matter how old you are.  My nieces, age 22 and 17, love Jessica and look forward to working out with her everyday!",1456617600,2,395,4.226666666666667

Take it from someone that has tried so many. different programs and fell off quick for the simple fact as I did not like all of the workouts in the program. The biggest issue was I could not stay motivated, I never ever looked forward to a workout as I do now. It's work but it feels good. I have back issues as many of us might have and let me tell these workouts help, Jessica helps. I am so grateful she created this and program. Her words and the way she put this program together is amazing and so perfect for me, the moves feels good, you sweat, you burn, you smile, and clap and even pat yourself on the back.",1456358400,3,765,4.006535947712418

Every workout can be modified to your current fitness level and if you are already in shape you can add boosts to moves to make it more difficult. Jessica is very upbeat and positive, without being annoying. There have been a few exercise videos I don't want to do anymore due to the instructors. I actually look forward to doing her videos, and this is coming from someone who is severely allergic to exercise. :) I love that these videos also exercise the brain.  I feel that this program is designed to exercise your whole body and mind. It is a different approach than most hardcore cardio workout series. The 6 week calendar that is included, is a great way to keep you motivated and to keep track of your progress. Being on day 5, I have not done a repeat routine yet, so it is great for someone who likes variety. You also don't need equipment. Some videos use weights, but easing my way into it, I have not used weights yet and still get an awesome workout. I love that everything is optional and this also gives the program longevity, knowing that adding weights will make it more difficult in the future, when I am ready for them.  I also like Jessica's approach to diet.  Small changes, no restriction, just keep moving. It really has been a refreshing change of pace.",1456358400,5,1427,4.393939393939394

Even though I've been exercising regularly for years it was still a good challenge and with three levels shown it could easily work for new to fitness to advanced.  There is minimal equipment needed and by having a set schedule it helped to ensure a balance between easier and harder days so you don't burn out.

I was really excited about this ,  but even when following the advanced version ,  it hasn't been enough for me. I got super bored with some of the workouts. I'm going to start the whole thing over again ,  but I'm just going to add them to another workout and see how that goes - in which case, I probably won't use them 6 days a week.

There is a wide variety of workouts from cardio to toning and weight lifting to stretching!  It's a great balance and I loved the additional 10 min. YouTube videos that compliment the program.

I've taken aerobics classes off and on since the '80s but gave up on the gym classes when they got too crowded and the music got so loud I had to wear ear plugs. I have done Pilates at home and I've used a fitness tracker for several years and usually get at least 10,000 steps a day, but for some time I have been wanting to add some strength training. After reading the reviews on this package and checking out several of Jessica's YouTube videos, I decided to give this a try. I've done the first week of her 6 week countdown and so far I'm very pleased. The routines are interesting and varied, and just long enough to make me feel like I've accomplished something without being exhausting. I knew I could do this as soon as Jessica introduced her partners in the routines, who include her 60-year-old mother!

I had a hip replacement a couple of years ago and have arthritis that has become painful and limiting in my other hip. I know I will have to modify some moves simply because of my hip but this workout seems very doable to me. It is not jarring movements which I cannot do. Also I love the that the women in the video are not fashion model ""perfect"". Just everyday women ranging in age up to my age which is 61 - I can't tell you how encouraging it is to see women like me doing these workouts, it makes me feel like I can succeed too! I also ordered and viewed the Yoga Stretch for Beginners and Beyond. Again, the movements are gentle and though I know there are some the pain and limited range of motion in my ""bad"" hip will not allow me to do completely, I believe these movements will improve my condition.

I hate cardio, but I love weights and the upper body, lower body, total body, and barefoot fusion all have strength training in them. The 360 abs uses a weight for some of the standing abs work. I don't like the first 10 mins of 360 abs because it is kickboxing, which is not my thing, but I just skip that part. Dynamic stretch and prefab are both great for rest days or for those days that exercise is unbearable.  At 55 I appreciate the knee friendly modifications done by Jessica's mom. I think there's something here for everyone. If you like cardio, you will like cardio party and brain fitness. The interval workout is the most difficult to me, but others may like it. I think there's something here for everyone. A great purchase.",1454976000,,804,4.544827586206897
7541540,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I'm relatively new to Jessica Smith's videos, having bought her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-000-Steps-Weight-Loss-Walk-On-5-Fat-Burning-Miles-Walking-Exercise-DVD/dp/B00W85TAHE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10,000 Steps Weight Loss - Walk On: 5 Fat Burning Miles Walking Exercise DVD</a>&nbsp;recently.  I really enjoyed the workouts in that DVD so I decided that I wanted more.  When doing workouts at home it's important for me that the instructor's personality doesn't rub me the wrong way and isn't too aggressive in their motivational style.  It's also important that I am challenged by the sequences and get a good sweat going.  Jessica Smith's personality is fun and genuine and she comes across as someone you want to be friends with!  It's also nice that she has her mom participating in the workout videos with her.  I tried the Cardio Party workout last night and the moves were fun and easy enough to follow.  And the 30 minutes went by really fast!  I was sweaty and felt like I got a good workout, but not so exhausted that I was collapsed in a heap on the floor.  I'm looking forward to doing the rest of this program and I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to start a home exercise routine!",1454976000,,1269,5.5
7541541,5,B0187Z2IR2,"Jessica Smith is a great encourager!  Her cues are easy to follow and she makes it very clear that we are all in different stages of our journey and that we should ""listen to our bodies"" and do what we can, working to do a little more, with a little more energy, each session.  I love that the videos include modifications for hip and knee issues, and Ms. Smith also provides suggestions for possible shoulder issues.  When I finish working out with one of these videos, I know I have worked hard, but I have also had fun and been respected.",1454976000,3,541,4.336633663366337
7541542,5,B0187Z2IR2,"Like many other reviewers, I have been a long time fan of Jessica. It started many years ago with her 10-minute solution DVDs. Its hard not to fall in love with her personality and smart approach towards health and fitness. Each year, my employer hosts a fitness challenge at the beginning of the spring season. If you walk more than 7,000 steps per day for 30 days, you win some great prizes. Well, in 2015 the winter here in New England was atrocious and it was still very cold here in April when the challenge began. I knew I could not walk outdoors but did not want to make excuses.  Determined to not lose the challenge, I immediately searched Amazon for some walking DVDs. I was so delighted to see Jessica making a name for herself in the walking arena. Needless to say, I grabbed the 15- fast blast walks and the 21 day program. Let's just say, my passion for finally committing to health, fitness and wellness was born....and of course, I rocked the walking challenge with top honors!

So I followed Jess's website and youtube page and grabbed all of the DVDs she came out with in 2015. Loved them all...each one better than the next! For Christmas this year, my husband got me a Beachbody program I have been dying for. No sooner did it arrive, I saw Jess's trailer for the 6-week program and knew I NEEDED it in my fitness rotation ASAP. The hubby was not happy, but I started the program and am so glad I did. I am 6 weeks in to the program (needed to repeat week 5 due to illness) and now feel confident I can speak about the program and my (mental and physical) results.

This program has 10 workouts - 2 stretching, 4 cardio based routines (one of which is HIIT) and 4 sculpting routines. Jess provides a calendar outlining the workouts for the week. No week is ever the same. I have noticed they one week is usually more cardio focused followed by a more sculpting based week. Even the sculpting routines will raise your heart rate because many of the moves work several large muscle groups at once. Jess clearly put a lot of thought and effort into figuring out how to maximize our workouts in the shortest amount of time possible.

I was a bit apprehensive about the days that only assigned a stretching routine as the only workout of the day, but I put my faith in her knowledge and found out very shortly how much my body needed and craved that stretch. Follow the calendar, trust me.

Other reviewers here did a great job outlining the expectations of the individual workouts, so I will just tell you my favorites and why. My top 3 are (1) Interval mix - I am really loving HIIT and have seen the great benefits on my body. I LOVE the feeling of pushing through a tough interval. It is very motivating. The music on this one is great too. (2) Barefoot fusion sculpt  - Don't be fooled by this one. Its intense even if only using 3lb weights like I do. My posture has improved greatly on this one. (3) 360 abs- very reminiscent of cardio abs. Love the martial arts inspired moves combined with floor work. The 30 minutes fly by on this one.

So over the 6 weeks (despite some indiscretions with my eating plan) my abs have flattened out and more importantly, my lower abdominal area is FINALLY shrinking....I never thought that would happen! My arms are getting super toned and several of my friends and family have commented on my newly visible ""guns"". My pants are fitting better due to my hips coming in a bit. Overall, I would have never expected these kinds of results in 6 weeks when not ""dieting"". My energy levels are high and my passion for fitness increasing.

You CANNOT go wrong with the program no matter what stage of fitness you are at. Trust Jessica. She won't let you down. I promise!",1454889600,7,3721,4.4298245614035086
7541543,5,B0187Z2IR2,"As many others agree, Jessica's work outs are inspiring and fun. The 6 Week Transformation takes it up a notch with more difficult strength training, which is what I was looking for and needing. Each work out is 30 minutes of fun and sweat, and the time goes by quickly. With the daily routine chart, I feel compelled to do the work out as if I can't let myself or the team down by not showing up (""See you tomorrow!"") I am on day 14 and have lost 3 pounds without even changing my diet! Completing the workouts really gives me a feeling of satisfaction. I have not noticed any trouble with the DVD quality.  I think the difference between this series and some of her other recent DVD's is the addition of more focused toning for abs and upper and lower body. I look forward to see how I look and feel at the end of 6 weeks!",1454803200,2,824,4.182389937106918
7541544,5,B0187Z2IR2,"Jessica Smith is the best!!  I just received this set and have only done one workout from it, which I enjoyed very much.  I have 6 of her tapes already and have done some videos on her youtube channel as well.  Having used other walking tapes from different trainers over the years, what makes me love these are her music selection and the different moves she has put together.  She is the best!  I am so looking forward to working out with Jessica for the next 6 weeks.  I am posting under my dad's account, but I am actually a 46 year old female who is walking for health.  Walking to keep cholesterol down, blood pressure in check and just overall health, so important!",1454716800,,672,4.370967741935484
7541545,4,B0187Z2IR2,"I am an advanced exerciser and use this for my active rest days or to add to my other workout I am doing that day. I found all the workouts very good and enjoyable, except Cardio Party. The last 10 minutes got better, but the first 20 minutes I felt Jessica was very forced and uncomfortable with that crowd of ladies. I like the sheet which tells you what workout to do on a particular day. It would be very helpful to have a summary of each workout along with the equipment needed printed on the workout  sheet. I really enjoyed all of the workouts and felt sore after doing the total body training. Jessica  kept the workouts fresh with some new and  very effective moves. I really love having the countdown timer on the screen. Both the prehab and the dynamic stretch workouts are very good and are a really nice addition to the workout types in this collection. Overall I am glad I purchased this series and I do feel if someone follows the suggested schedule on the workout sheet  they will see a transformation after 6 weeks. my least favorite workout was the cardio party and my favorite workout was the brain fitness fun. All are very good though. I was able to purchase this with Jessica's great discount which was an added bonus. I love her spirit and her energy. She explains things clearly and the benefit certain moves have on the body. This workout series includes all the components of a well rounded workout series with cardio, interval training, weights and flexibility and stretching. Jessica makes it easy with her chart and her cuing is pretty spot on for the most part. She is easy to follow and once you do one of her workouts, think you will be hooked. I only gave 4 stars because of how much I disliked cardio party and the lack of description and equipment needed on the workout sheet. I have only used this for 1 week to complete all of the workouts.",1454630400,9,1877,4.4476744186046515
7541546,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I found Jessica Smith by her being recommended on a couple of the weight loss sites I belong to.  After checking out the posted dvd and then the You Tube free videos and her site I started with the 15 minute walking dvd and decided after a few weeks to order one after a few more weeks decided to try to increase my time and do more.  I received a discount email from Jessica and my hesitation over spending the money was gone!  I also bought the 10,000 step walking dvd and 21 day dvd set for variety  as I am determined to make this go beyond weight loss and a part of my every day life.  I am 64 and like that her mother is doing easier versions - as I need to work around bad knees and ankles.  I am on day 2 and am finding the program easy to stick with, as I had not previously checked any of the strength training with weights this was a pleasant surprise!  Over the years I have purchased many dvd's  but other that Tami Lee Webb, Jessica is the only person who has the personality and style I can stick with.",1454630400,2,1017,4.024875621890548

There are low impact and advanced options for the exercises so you can keep challenging yourself as your fitness level improves. Each workout is only 30 minutes, there is a count down clock so you can see how far you are into it. Very fun but also hard work and you will see changes.  There is a planner that tells you which workout to do each day, although I have been alternating these DVDs with Jessica's more intense cardio workouts on U Tube. If you prefer the specifically walking workouts you might like the Walk On 30 Day Challenge better, I am planning to order this one also.

I am 64 years old and overweight with shoulder, knee and wrist problems but I am 3 days from completing the 6 week transformation program.  I started on the beginner level with Debbie and have been moving up in weight and level.  There are some that I have modified on my own.  I do the lower body workout bridges with my feet on the floor not the chair as it is easier on my knees.  I like that Jessica tells you to listen to your own body and I do.  For me this is a winner, I love the chart that keeps me on track and rotates the routine for me.

I was hoping to find a workout where I would burn a descent amount of calories during it, create enough variety that I would look forward to doing it, and feel like it was changing my body. I got all of that. This is not a high intensity set, it's moderate. You'll sweat, be slightly sore but not to the point where you are exhausted or can't walk for days.",1454544000,2,401,4.220779220779221
7541554,5,B0187Z2IR2,"Jessica Smith has really impressed me.  I am not kidding.  I had no idea she had so many options but remember her kickboxing dvd's. I haven't been through all the dvd's yet but so far they seem in good shape.  I have thus far not had a problem with scratched DVD's or freezes like a few other companies that made me fear buying sets.

The workouts are not easy, not too hard, just the right intensity.  What I like about Jessica is she has moderators to show different options.  I still do Jillian and Tracy but these can be as tough as I need them too be.  It appears the research with wellness, mental Health and memory has been done in these.  I am a true believer in the mind, body connection especially with my daily workouts.  Working out daily is a must for my body and state of mind.

I have done four workouts now and really enjoyed them.  This is a well rounded collection for fitness.  It was also nice to see ""Mom"" and a few From the community.

So far I am happy with this set.  I will update in a month on the rest of the dvd's.  Jessica is the real thing!",1454371200,,1070,4.12621359223301

7541556,4,B0187Z2IR2,"Decent workout, revamp of some classic workout tape moves plus a few new additions. Love the different expierence levels as I was horribly out of shape when I started. My only beef is they start you out right away working out 6 days in a row. Generally if you're very new to physical activity a day off every 2-3 days is generally recommended as to avoid injury. I would hate for anyone to pull or strain something by working out gung ho the first 6 days in a row.
This is a great DVD set however, I laughed and broke a sweat through the entire workout. Highly recommend, but if you're very out of shape like I was, take your time in the beginning. Don't want any injuries.",1454371200,6,673,4.265625

I was doubtful that I would get much done in 30 minute segments.. I was WRONG! :)) The workouts are fun, easy to follow and challenging. I am an intermediate exerciser and  I think the workouts would be good for anyone from just starting out to someone who exercises regularly.  I'll definitely add on to these with other of Jessica's DVDs. Recommended!",1454198400,3,514,4.34375

With each one, I thought this is my favorite. And now with Work Strong, it's become my favorite as well. I guess that means all of her workouts are my favorites! :) But this one is the most comprehensive of all, with 10 workouts, and every one is fun and as challenging as you want to make it. It's hard to name a favorite among the 10, but if pushed I'd have to say the Barefoot Fusion Sculpt. Jessica calls it a ""sneaky"" workout in that you don't realize how intense it is until you've finished, and it's true. This is definitely an investment, but I think it's well worth it.

Also, extremely fast shipping!  I know it is a lot of exclamation points, but it really is that good.  I am a Certified Personal Trainer myself.  I have always worked out hard and have always had some type of injury that I was battling.

7541564,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I have been working out with Jessica Smith since I first discovered her on U tube about 3 years ago. She is such an inspirational trainer that each day I am motivated to get up early and keep fit with  several of her workouts either on U tube or DVDs everyday.
This latest set of her DVDs is an amazing 5 hours of ten 30 minutes workouts. Her slogan 'Fitness is Fun' is fully reflected in these WalkOnWalkStrong routines. I love Jessica's  attitude to exercise as a means of staying healthy and strong to cope with everyday life, rather simply calorie burning to lose weight. This new set of DVDs does just that!
They incorporate different types of exercises to work on all parts of the body in different ways. Aerobic workouts include the fun Cardio Party (with some community members), Brain Fitness Fun and Interval Mix.  Hand weights are used with great effectiveness in several of the routines. These include Upper Body Strength, 360 Abs, lower Body Sculpt and Barefoot Fusion Sculpt. . Emphasis is also placed on keeping the brain as well as the body, active  in Brain Fitness Fun. Jessica also stresses the need of giving the body some TLC with Dynamic Stretch and Prehab Routine.
This surely has to be her best set of DVDs produced so far.

7541565,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I have done all the major series of at home DVDs, from way back to Jane Fonda, to Kathy Smith, to Leslie Sansone, to Beach Body series, to Zumba. But, the ""walking"" programs from Jessica have beat them all. They aren't just easy walking, a lot of variety and level modifications. But if you are a beginner you will be just fine. This new Walk Strong series is just another example of Jessicas ability to be down to earth and motivating, her clear instruction capability and timing for the next moves, and her stellar workout choreography and music selection. I have only good things to say. I feel lucky to have finally found at home workouts with such a high level instructor like Jessica! But keep in mind that the back up people and Jessica herself, are not overly buffed up perfect Barbie dolls - she is of course very fit and pretty - but they are working out along with you more than ""at"" you, it's professional but more real. There are 10 workouts on this DVD series, all 30 minutes with time clock showing what time remains as you go. And it's great that she included an upper body workout and lower body workout, as well as a strength full body workout, so there is a bit more strength training in this series which I like.

What really sets this apart is the strength training, with or without weights. The walking routines were getting easier for me, and the strength training has added a level of challenge that I needed.

As others have pointed out, Jessica's friendly, helpful explanations of the hows and also the whys of the workouts is great. She makes it fun. Actually looking forward to training is a key to success, so I'm very happy with this set of workouts.",1453939200,,570,4.747474747474747

7541577,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I'm in Day 4 of the workout videos.  Day 1 was pretty easy as workouts go since it was cardio (don't get me wrong, I sweated a lot) and I'm fairly used to Jessica's moves.  But the Total Body Workout on Day 2??  Wow, that was a killer.  My legs were like jelly when I finished!  The Brain Booster workout in Day 3 also made me sweat but I laughed a lot as I nearly tied my legs in knots trying to follow the moves.  Today was the barefoot walk but it, too, was a serious workout for me.

I found it somewhat difficult to transition to the floor in the same amount of time that Jessica did, and it isn't always easy to follow what she is doing while trying to do it myself.  However, having done some of her videos before, I know it will get easier to make the transitions the second time around.  I watched the intro to the series where Jessica explained what equipment to use, etc., and appreciate her giving her mom's and Beth's ages.  For one thing, I underestimated their ages by at least 10 years (kudos to them for looking good!) but since they are about my age, I was inspired as well.  As in other videos, her mom Debbie does more low intensity moves and I alternate between doing them and trying the higher intensity moves.

I have walked for years with Leslie Sansone and will continue to do her workouts, too.  Even though I've done her videos so many times I can anticipate when she's going to change feet, they still make me sweat and I always feel better afterwards.  However, if you want to rev it up a notch, try this workout with Jessica.",1453852800,,1555,4.227118644067796
7541578,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I usually work out with Cathe, but I needed some easier lower impact workouts too, and these
are less taxing on the joints but still a great workout! The Interval workout was a goodie, but
LOVE the Brain Fitness Fun w/o as well as 360 Abs. Of course, Jessica is known for her
excellent standing core work, and this one is fabulous! The only downside to this series is
that the sound isn't the best....Jessica's voice is super loud and the music is pretty soft. But
other than that, it is a winner for me!",1453766400,,504,4.315789473684211
7541579,4,B0187Z2IR2,"My husband and I have been doing the 21 Day Fix, but I needed something easier on my knees.  After such a high-intensity program, I can't say I was expecting much from this.  I have been pleasantly surprised!  I've done 6 of the workouts so far and have definitely gotten a workout and several days have had a nice soreness afterwards.  I really enjoyed the Barefoot Fusion, apparently I love working out in bare feet. No, this program will not get you rock-hard abs.  It will get you in, or keep you in, good overall health.  The program is non-intimidating enough that my 9 year old daughter has joined in several times.  I can't imagine my husband doing this workout though, definitely focused on women.

My only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is the production quality as others have mentioned.  The music frequently doesn't match the movements.  Too much music and not enough beat.  A nice, audible, beat is great for following along when you can't see the screen.  Jessica's music, while pleasant to listen to, rarely has a discernible beat and I often have a hard time matching her tempo.  Also, when they clap on-screen, the sound of the clapping is quite lagged behind.",1453766400,11,1176,4.6231884057971016

7541581,5,B0187Z2IR2,"This is a terrific, well thought out and balanced exercise program! Jessica's style of teaching and coaching is positive, engaging and her joyous  spirit is infectious. The 30-minute workouts quickly pass by, resulting in an energized, not exhausted feeling. I've just started the second week of the program and have enjoyed the planned out rotation of exercises which are done with such a variety and creativity of moves that the entire body is comprehensively developed, and there is little risk of feeling bored at any point in the workout. Jessica's tips and form corrections throughout the routines are completely on point, as if you have your own personal trainer watching you, and effectively help you avoid common form errors. The Florida sun-filled studio provides a calm and serene environment to watch and the music is well chosen. Best of all, Jessica's style is FUN and I find myself looking forward to spending the half hour a day doing each segment. I've been regularly using lots of different workout DVDs for the past few years, and I can say unreservedly that Jessica's Walk Strong program is among the very best!",1453680000,2,1131,4.984126984126984

7541584,5,B0187Z2IR2,"This is my first time purchasing Jessica Smiths workouts and I can only say that I extremely pleased with how she has incorporated yoga, ballet,Pilates and cardio in her 30 minute high fat blasting body sculpting workout. Fantastic and you will see results, I have countless workout DVD's but nothing like this. I think I finally found the perfect 30 minute workout and oh  yes you will love the 30 minute stretch segment LOVE I!! Great cuing and the countdown clock is PERFECT!! if you ;purchase you won't be disappointed. Include this workout with healthy eating NOT dieting just non processed foods and you will get a beautiful lean sculpted body and yes very nice flat abs!!",1453593600,2,678,4.794871794871795
7541585,5,B0187Z2IR2,"Nice balance of workouts in this new Walk Strong program. I am halfway through the 6-week program now and look forward to working out every morning. I've been working out daily for years now and always tried to come up with my own mix of workouts to balance strength and cardio training. Jessica's new program makes that super easy by providing the 6-week calendar rotating the 10 different workouts. I've also always loved her YouTube challenges, but my internet isn't always reliable so that would be really frustrating at times. What's also nice - and like her Walk On DVDs - is that she offers an advanced, intermediate, and more beginner version for many moves. I love love love the fact that instead of using unrealistic fitness models with fake smiles Jessica has her mom and friend demo the different versions of the moves alongside herself. The countdown clock is also a nice touch.

I own almost all of Jessica's DVDs (and many other fitness DVDs as well) and I think this is the best program so far. My personal favorite is the 'barefoot cardio sculpt'; It's a feel-good routine that makes you work harder than you think. Second favorite is the 'total body workout'. The most challenging in my opinion is the 'interval mix' but it is still very doable. The type of 'cardio party' workout is not really my thing (I'd rather do cardio without pretending it to be a party) and find the '360 abs' so-so (but many others seem to like it). The 'prehab' routine is unique and I think totally awesome for a recovery day.

Overall definitely a great buy and worth the money. Truly a workout program for anyone at all levels.",1453593600,2,1626,4.642361111111111

7541588,5,B0187Z2IR2,I'm 2 days into the 6 week program and am loving it so far!  I'm 60 years old so I really appreciate the additional low impact exercises that she incudes.  Five stars!,1453507200,,167,4.1875
7541589,5,B0187Z2IR2,"In addition to doing many workouts from Jessica's free YouTube library, I have purchased 6 of her other DVD sets, so I feel I am in a position to make a good comparison to her other offerings.  Obviously I am a fan, so it's no surprise this is a good review.  However, of all the other sets I have purchased and worked out with, and of all the free week-long, month-long, 21-day challenges, etc. she provides through emails, I personally like this the best.  I made a photo copy of the helpful suggested workout schedule that comes with the set so that I can reuse it when the first six-week set is finished.  I actually look forward to seeing what workout is scheduled for the day, so that's saying something! (A small checkbox next to each day is provided to mark when a workout is done.)  If you are new to Jessica, I believe you will enjoy her friendly, motivational and realistic view to exercise and life. If you are not new to Jessica, I believe you will appreciate that there is more of an emphasis on toning than in some of her previous DVD sets. While she has always included toning with her walking, I feel the toning workouts in this set are more intense and focused than in the past. There is also an excellent stretching workout. FYI: I am in my early 50s and have been exercising steadily with videos for the past 30 years, so I am in reasonably good shape for my age.  For younger exercisers: I believe you will also find this challenging, unless you prefer punishing and grueling workouts led by trainers who are so rock hard they almost don't look human and who will try to bring you to the brink of tears that seem to be popular with some.  If that's your thing, this may not be the set for you. However, if sweating and feeling good about yourself and feeling challenged is your thing, this set can be great for you.  (Don't get me wrong, Jessica is in great shape, but she still looks like a real person.  Think of a fit but nice friend.) For older exercisers: Jessica's mom, who I believe Jessica said is in her early 60's, is featured on the videos, and I believe her moderate moves would be easy to follow until a person's movements get limited by a cane or walker ... so in other words, for a very long time.  For the price, I think it's a real bargain for everything you get.",1453507200,10,2301,4.330232558139535
7541590,5,B0187Z2IR2,"Jessica's best work yet. The variety is terrific and it is harder than a lot of her You Tube or other DVD's. Thoroughly pleased with this set and what a bang for your buck. I love the rotation schedule, 3 different levels to choose from-her mom does lower impact and a lot of knee and joint modifications, Jessica is mid ground and Beth takes it up another notch.

I cannot wait to try the other dvds in set. Jessica is a excellent trainer, she guides you though the workout making sure you do it correct form. I have Jessica's other Walk Strong dvds also that are great. I am 56 years old but can successfully do her dvds with no problem.",1453420800,,445,4.186046511627907

I absolutely love the fact that each workout is only 30 minutes long. I am a believer in efficient workouts such as these.  I also love that there is a lot of diversity in this program.  Jessica is a great instructor and I really appreciate and agree with her approach to fitness.  I am so glad that I decided to add this to my exercise library.",1453334400,,506,4.3052631578947365
7541593,5,B0187Z2IR2,"Jessica has done it again!  Each series she puts out just keeps getting better and better. There is a nice mix of walking, strength training and stretching so you don't get bored.

The usual crew of Debbie (Jessicas Mom) and Beth (friend) are in each workout.  A fun surprise is that some of the community members are in some of the workouts.  The workouts are filmed inside in a white room.  All of the workouts clock in at around 30 minutes and each workout has an inspirational quote at the beginning.  There is also a suggested rotation calendar as well as a website, walkonwalkstrong.com.

Please note this is an all-encompassing series and it is not just walking.  It has walking, strength training and stretching.

This series includes:
Disc 1:
Welcome to the Program

Interval Mix

Disc 2:
360 Abs

DISC 1
CARDIO PARTY
People rarely succeed unless they have fun in what they are doing.  Dale Carnegie

There was a purple string or something hanging off of Jessicas shirt, which was a little distracting.

Some of the moves in this workout included:  disco walk, double scoop side step, speed bag up & down, Latin cha cha.

INTERVAL MIX
If we did all things we are capable of doing, we would literally astound ourselves.  Thomas Edison

Equipment: sturdy high back chair

I loved the energy in this workout. You feel like you are working, but you feel very energized at the end of the workout.  The workout has 4 rounds of a moderate intensity move, interval move and an active recovery.

The warm up consists of some walking and moves like cross back skater with arm swing and squat reach up on toes.

Some of the moves in this workout include:  side step with swim, cross over mountain climber, high chop with knee lift.  There are some old favorite moves as well as some fun, new  moves.

DISC 2
360 ABS
It is not the beauty of a building you should look at; it is the construction of the foundation that will stand the test of time.  David Allan Coe

Equipment:  Mat, light dumbbell  5 lbs max

Jessica emphasizes that the purpose of working your core should not be get that 6-pack look, but to build a strong and functional core.  This workout has both standing and floor core work.

Some of the moves in this workout include:  side tap reach overhead, cross chop hamstring curl, weighted wood chop, figure 8 scoop with side step, arms around the world with weight.  The floor core work includes:  dead bug extension, weight on back plank, weighted knee chop.

BRAIN FITNESS FUN
The key to truly changing your life for the better is by improving your mind, or more precisely, your brain.  Marie Pasinski, MD, Harvard Medical School

I love it when Jessica does these types of workouts!  I like to work my brain while Im exercising.  There are also brain boosting tips scattered throughout the workout.

The workout structure: Warm up, Coordination, Balance, Memory, Cool Down.

Some of the moves in this workout include: flamingo hands, half jack arms with side step, balance on one leg and circle other leg and arm, front & back v steps.

BAREFOOT FUSION SCULPT
Success is the sum of small efforts repeated day-in and day-out.  Robert Collier

Equipment:  light set of dumbbells (I used 5 pounds).

This is my favorite of all the workouts in this series.  There is just something about fusion workouts that are so flowing and graceful.

The fusion moves are new and fun.  You do 2 or so moves and then repeat them.  The cool down is a delicious blend of tai chi and balance moves.

Some of the moves in this workout include: foot warm ups, arm swings while stepping side to side, alternate knee with chest scoop, step with rainbow arms.

DISC 3
TOTAL BODY TRAINING
Dont let what you cant do interfere with what you can do.  John R. Wooden

Equipment needed: Mat, set of light dumbbells, set of heavy dumbbells.

The moves are all compound so you burn lots of calories and keep your heart rate up there.  This is straight up weight training with no walking.

Some of the moves in this workout include: deadlift cobra with 10 pound weights.

UPPER BODY STRENGTH
I ask not for a lighter burden, but for broader shoulders.  Jewish proverb

Equipment:  Mat, 1 set of heavy dumbbells and 1 set of light dumbbells

The warm up is walking with arm stretches like pec dec.

The workout consists of 2 rounds for each set of exercises.  Jessica changes the tempo too, so you may be lifting up for 3 counts and down for 1 count, and then doing up for 1 count and down for 3 counts. This is yet another way to work your muscles.  There are both standing and lying down exercises.

Some of the exercises in this workout include:  scoops with heavy weights, W rear flys, alternate knee lift with hammer curl, balance on 1 leg and bicep pulse,  monster hug, side plank.

LOWER BODY SCUPLT
Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.  Albert Einstein.

Equipment:  Sturdy, high back chair, mat, 1 set of heavy dumbbells and 1 set of light dumbbells.

Jessica said it best when she described this workout as a sneaky one.  It starts out kind of easy, but then your leg muscles start talking to you!  There is both standing and floor work in this workout.  The floor work is kind of like barre work, with small pulses.

I especially enjoyed this workout because of the new and unique exercises.

Some of the exercises in this workout include:  sit & stand in front of chair while holding weights, deadlift both double and single legged, lie on stomach and do frog movements with your legs.

The warmup was a walking one.

DISC 4
DYNAMIC STRETCH
Blessed are the flexible for that shall not be bent out of shape.  Unknown

Equipment:  Mat and towel or stretch band

This relaxing workout has both standing and floor stretches.  With many of the exercises you can go deep because you first contract the muscle and then you relax the muscle.  The point of this workout is to take care of your body.  It is perfect for those days when you are sore or tired.

Some of the exercises in this workout include:  shoulder shrug, half head roll, figure 8 arms with lunge, triangle.  My favorite exercises in this workout include:  side stretch with towel, circle stretch with towel and chest opener with towel.

Jessica ends the routine with asking us to think of one thing about our body that we are grateful for.

PREHAB ROUTINE
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  Benjamin Franklin

Equipment: Mat, towel and chair

This relaxing routine is perfect to do at the end of a stressful day.  It focuses on all the joints in your body.  You start at your head and work all the way down to your toes.

The infamous chicken head stretch starts the workout.  You then move on to some delicious neck stretches.

Some of my favorite moves in this workout include: holding towel in a ball and circling arms, holding towel and circling wrists in all directions, knee circles while on back.

About 13 minutes are spent standing and then you move to the floor for some wonderful stretches.

I felt so relaxed and stretched out after this gem of a workout; this will be one well-used routine for me!",1453248000,8,7274,4.577431906614786
7541594,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I first found Jessica Smith via her YouTube channel. I have since purchased all of her walking videos. Her walking workouts, as well as her other workouts, make working out more fun for me personally. Her style and personality are encouraging without being over the top. (And none of the mindless chatter that is on some walking videos. What she says is very constructive.)  When I initially ordered the Walk Strong set, the dvds had become dislodged from the case and were scratched so they would not play correctly. Both Jessica Smith and Amazon quickly resolved this issue for me. I exchanged the damaged set for a new set without any problems. Great customer service by both parties. I consider the purchase of all of her walking videos an investment in my health. No regrets or disappointment here at all. Definitely worth the purchase.",1453248000,,841,4.840277777777778

These videos are the perfect balance of work and fun. The 30 minutes fly by, and at the end of each video I find that I'm worked and sweaty. Jessica gives clear instruction and offers modification suggestions for every move. I would highly recommend these for anyone looking for exercise videos that are motivating.",1453248000,,466,4.626506024096385

These workouts are great for beginners or advanced exercisers. Jessica shows you how to tailor your workout for wherever you're at in your fitness journey. I really love her attention to good form and safety.  Her workouts are also time efficient (30 mins) and effective.  She doesn't waste time, so be prepared to work, but not kill yourself, as other programs advertise.  This is not a workout system that will make you feel like throwing up afterward, but you will feel toned and energized.  I just LOVE Jessica's style and enthusiasm.

Plus I have time for some additional walking, yoga or low impact flow workouts most days. I haven't completed all of the workouts yet, but really have enjoyed the variety so far.  Jessica's instructions are easy to follow, and all of the tips on body alignment, which muscle groups you should be concentrating on, and breathing reminders make me feel as if I'm working with my own personal trainer.

I might have to change it up a bit because of my work schedule, but I intend to do the workouts in order even if I need to skip a day because of work.  I also love that her workout partners are both in their 50's like me.  It just goes to show, you're never to old to exercise.

I own ALL of Jessica's Walk On DVDs (as well as some of her earlier DVDs) and have always liked her personality and instruction. She's one of the best in the fitness industry!  However, the production quality (film / DVD quality) of this set is not the best.  I had noticed the same issue with her previous Walk On set release and thought maybe I had just received a copy that was somewhat faulty, but it is the same with this new Walk On Transformation set.  I compare to the new set that Cathe Friedrich has just released (ICE Series) and the film / DVD quality is far, far superior to this set from Jessica. Also Leslie Sansone's DVDs are very good quality filming.  In this case, whether it is due to the equipment used to actually film Jessica's workouts or the replicator used to mass produce the DVDs, there is a lack in quality (I went as far as thinking these were DVD-R, but they are actual DVDs). I'm sorry, Jessica, for being so direct about this (and no, I don't want to return my set), however I think that in future you may want to consider perhaps using different camera equipment and/or DVD replicator.  I love your workouts, but for me this issue is letting your DVDs down.",1453075200,30,1292,4.4261603375527425

I like that the workouts don't leave me wiped out for the day but energized and feeling fit. I think Jessica's approach to fitness is about health and wellness and not just appearance.

I have previously purchased her Barre series and Yoga stretch.  Love them all!",1452902400,,397,4.628571428571429
7541614,5,B0187Z2IR2,"Jessica has outdone herself with this set of videos and the accompanying 6 week transformational plan.  Each workout is eminently doable at 30 minutes, with an excellent variety of cardio, strength and flexibility routines.  Following her schedule provides enough variety to keep both the mind engaged and the body active all over.  I'm at the end of week 2 and am loving it!",1452902400,,375,4.920634920634921
7541615,4,B0187Z2IR2,I really like working out with Jessica! I vary between being highly motivated and then not....Jessica keeps it steady for the long haul. And.... Cheaper than a gym and super convenient. i think it covers balance agility and strength training in a great way. No regrets here.,1452902400,2,274,4.851063829787234
7541616,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I strongly recommend these DVDs if you're looking to make a real change in your life that you'll be able to sustain. This is what I love about that product(in no particular order):
- the trainer is always positive and encouraging,
- there are always modifications presented so you can choose the fitness level that's right for you,
- the trainer is accompanied by her mother (60 years young) and a friend (55 years young) who present the easier and more advanced modifications respectively, also shows you can exercise at any age (I'm 35)
- all the models are nicely covered, so I don't get a complex by watching perfectly sculpted abs and thighs while mine are thickly covered with a layer of fat
- the videos are kid friendly
- there is a plan that tells you exactly what video to follow each day, this way I know everything is well balanced with easier and harder days and I avoid overtraining (which leads to injury)
- the moves are easy to understand and follow
- the trainer cues very well for each move change
- the trainer always explains clearly how to do a move
- each daily workout lasts 30 minutes
- all the videos are very different from one another so I never get bored
- after floor work, the trainer takes the time to get back up slowly
- there is no constant alternating between standing work and floor work
- there is a countdown clock for each video
- all the exercises can be done with low impact
- all the exercices can be done in a small space
- I feel like I'm doing the right amount of exercice: I'm getting fitter, I have more energy, my mood is better, I'm not experiencing a huge increase in appetite
- there is a video which features 4 members of the community in addition to the regular crew: I find it very motivating to exercise with regular women of different age categories
- the trainer has managed to make fitness fun for me and I'm now looking forward to my daily dose of fitness (from a previous couch potato that dreaded to sweat)
- I love checking in on the website (walkonwalkstrong 'dot' com) everyday and see that there are plenty of other people around the world that are all working on getting fitter.

I discovered Jessica Smith on youtube 6 months ago after trying many different fitness trainers and have been consistently working out with her since then. I've followed many of her programs (#FITIN15, Pear Shape, Walk on 21 day, Walk on 30 day) and all I can say is that they work: I have dropped many inches and pounds and that was without modifying my diet.",1452902400,2,2507,4.4146868250539955
7541617,5,B0187Z2IR2,"Jessica Smith is such a motivating fitness expert!  I have almost all of her videos and love them all!!  I really like that she has a variety of workouts to help with strength, balance, cardio, and now even your mind!  This video set offers a brain fun video that helps challenge your brain as well as your heart and muscles.  Excellent as always",1452902400,,346,4.444444444444445
7541618,5,B0187Z2IR2,"This is such an amazing program! For the first time in a very long time, I am excited to exercise. The variety in this set, the modifications for every level, and Jessica's positive motivation make it a pleasure to exercise every day.",1452902400,,234,4.595238095238095
7541619,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I have been following the 6 week plan and absolutely love it.  The 6 week plan fits well together and it is easy to keep with the plan and stay consistent.  It has modifications for Beginner to Advanced and as an Intermediate exerciser I found that this has lots of challenge and room to grow, which helps keep me going.  I love all the quotes and tips she has included and have hung them with the rotation calendar (both I have laminated so that the calendar is reusable) and look at them daily.

Each routine I do I always think ""Now this is my favorite!!""  Still trying to figure out which is my favorite.
The routines:
Cardio Party! - This one was just a blast.  I actually found myself laughing during my workout.  It was also fun to see some community members included.
Interval Mix - This one is fabulous.  Interval training at its best!  Modifications if needed and eventually I will be able to do them at the advanced level.
360 Abs - This one was interesting the first time I did it...the second time I knew what was coming and got a better workout.  This has become one of my favorites.  Really works the abs in new ways!
Brain Fitness Fun - I love the moves in this one.  Really gets you thinking and moving at the same time.  This one was a lot of fun!
Barefoot Fusion Sculpt - I think this one was my favorite.  A flowing workout with weights that works the entire body! Loved the floor work at the end.
Total Body Training - Love heavy weight training and this one is my new favorite!  Great cardio effect as well.
Upper Body Strength/Lower Body Strength - The upper and lower body strength workouts were tough...but when you work on specific areas for 30 minutes they will be.  I am looking forward to getting stronger with these workouts!
Dynamic Stretch - The perfect way to relax after a tough week.  It stretches out every muscle!
Prehab Routine - This is one of my favorites as well.  I hold a lot of tension around my joints and this one stretches and relaxes that tension and helps build strength around them to prevent future tension and injury!  I love this routine!

Overall I think this is one of the best programs that she had made, the rotation flows well together and it keeps me motivated to move.  GREAT buy!",1452902400,2,2240,4.388349514563107
7541620,4,B0187Z2IR2,I have had the Walk Strong Workout videos for two week and love the way they are set up. I love the clock timer. It seems as if you start to really get into the workout and the time is over. I look forward to the next 4 weeks.,1452729600,5,226,3.63265306122449
7541621,5,B0187Z2IR2,"These videos are a welcomed change of pace for me!  I was doing very difficult workouts which created such a dread factor that before long, I was hardly ever working out anymore.  These workouts are a breath of fresh air!  I look forward to doing them each day and appreciate that each day is something new.  A friend asked me to describe them, and that's difficult to do because they are so eclectic, incorporating so many styles:  sculpting, ballet, aerobics, dance, even tia chi (which I love, as a cooldown!). I have been focusing on brain health and there is even a workout just for that!  I break a sweat and get my heart rate up, yet they are very gentle, in comparison to what I was doing prior, and at the end of the 30-minute workouts (which I always have time to do before work), I feel energized, rather than beaten!  I always feel sore muscles which let me know that I did get a good workout.  Prior to purchasing, I went on Youtube and did some of Jessica's free workouts.  The DVD's are even better.  I will keep purchasing her other workouts, as well!  This workout comes with a chart/workout schedule - a nice touch.  I also like the inspirational quotes, within the DVDs.",1452643200,5,1189,4.453703703703703
7541622,5,B0187Z2IR2,"Fantastic workouts!  Especially for those of us who simply don't have time to workout otherwise.  Jessica has included some basic workouts that everyone needs, but that most programs don't include.",1452643200,,197,5.533333333333333
7541623,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I've been following Jessica for several years now and loved from the start her approach and style with her videos.  She's extremely encouraging and motivating yet sweet at the same time. I absolutely LOVE this new DVD program Jessica created.  I'm only on day nine of this six week program and I feel so good!!!  I already feel the difference in my energy levels and flexibility. I have a lot of weight to lose (about 100lbs) yet I find these workouts doable but challenging.  She includes different levels so if you need to modify you can follow her mom or follow along with Beth as she'll do the advance moves.  If you're considering this, definitely get it!

One of my favorite aspects of this program is the calendar that Jessica created that tells you what exercise to do which day.  This has taken any decisions out for me, each day I already know what I'm going to do for my workout.  That has made it real simple and easy for me.

I made a promise to myself that I will not miss a day during this six week program as this will be a great start to my weight loss journey.  I'm already down 5lbs since starting this on January 4th.  I obviously have cleaned up my eating quite a bit too. I'll post an update when I complete the six weeks!",1452556800,8,1244,4.318965517241379
7541624,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I have a few of Jessica's workouts and really wasn't sure this would be better than the last Walk On series but boy this is fantastic!  The production quality is superb with a soft grey industrial feel to it with a grey couch, large window, good lighting and nice furnishings.  For those who were tired of the white background this is a really nice change.  The close up shots were a nice change too, not crazy MTV styles that would make you dizzy, but very slick and polished.  She looks sleeker to me in this but very healthy and you can see she really enjoys this as well as mom and Debbie and the cast from Cardio Party.  My faves are Cardio Abs, Interval Party and Total Body Toning so far but I haven't done them all but have previewed most of them.  And I will have to say this really is my new favorite set.  It just has a vibe that's different than her other sets and those are fabulous too.  I don't know why, but I was just surprised these were so much better to me because her others are so very good.  A credit to great young talented instructor who gets fitness, is personable, cues extremely well as I can follow her just fine when not looking at the TV, in great shape, but is not condescending and challenges you. Man o man bravo team Jessica.",1452470400,4,1260,4.2384937238493725
7541625,4,B0187Z2IR2,"I like this set very much.  I'm following the six-week suggested rotation, and I must say that I've found it to be well balanced and do-able. Too many times, if left to my own devices, I'll choose some random workout based on what I feel like doing that morning and I end up doing too many walking workouts and not enough strength or flexibility.  With this, the decision's been made -- a big plus for me.  And as others have said, there is no dread factor: each workout is 30 minutes and includes an effective warm-up that gets you in the mood, even when you think it couldn't possibly. Not particularly a fan of the Cardio Party workout, but the others are quite good. The moves feel new and effective, and the video is well produced.  It's do-able for all levels, and Jessica is a really good trainer with great form and excellent cueing (""Now listen...!"") and a really engaging and motivating style. No bullying, no bull.  I like it.",1452470400,10,937,4.488235294117647
7541626,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I did the first workout this morning, Cardio Party & I enjoyed it.  I am tired of wasting my money on BeachBody workouts that only tear my body down & make me not want to do them. Ninety percent of weight loss comes from food choices & working out should be something you look forward to doing.  Another thing I like about Jessica's workouts is there are regular people doing them; not people that have done hard trying for years & half your age trying to make you think you'll look like this too, if you do this workout. It's just not true.  There's a clock in the lower right corner; so you can see where you are in the workout.  I am looking forward to the next workout; what a refreshing change.
Update: I have done three of the workouts so far: Cardio Party, Total Body Training & Brain Fitness.  The Brain Fitness was challenging in a different way; it really makes you think by using different parts of the body at the same time.  One foot goes out front while one arm goes up with palm up, the other arm goes down with palm down.  Sounds really easy but it's more difficult when you do it.  So far, I like the workouts I have done. 360 abs was great; no crunches but better than crunches.  Mostly standing but then some floor work; this felt so good.",1452470400,7,1258,4.2521008403361344

There's a great variety in this set, and I'm looking forward to going through the 6 week program.

I was surprised that what would appeared to be an easy workout was indeed a challenged. I was happy for that.  I like how each days workout has cardio in it and focuses on different parts of your body.  This makes for a complete body workout on one DVD set. I like that she has a six week schedule already made to take out the guess work on what to do each day. Jessica and those on this DVD are every day people of all shapes and sizes and unlike other workout DVDs, they are not showing off their fit bodies and muscles in outfits that reveal tons of clevege and pumped muscles.  Their bodies do not intimidate you to feel like you could never look that way.  Jessica Smith does not disappoint.  I highly reccommend this DVD if you want to have fun and be challenged at the same time.  Five thumbs up from me.",1452384000,7,919,4.2057142857142855

As a beginner exerciser, I really enjoy these workouts. They are easy to follow along and they are the perfect length  (30 minutes/workout) for me to do every day. The tips and calendar Jessica has included are nice too. No more wondering what to do next. My plan is to go through all 6 weeks as a beginner, then move up and keep cycling through the same workouts, just using the harder modifications and heavier weights. I really feel like I can grow with this set and not hit a plateau. Thanks for reading and I hope this review helps.",1452297600,5,665,4.32

The cues are spot on, cheery environment,  3 different choices of levels...her mom does the easiest movement Jessica does the bit more intense move, Jessica's friend (I forgot her name), does the most intense move.

It is great for all levels and ages, and covers are variety of workout styles from cardio, to toning, to stretching. You also get so many workouts for the price.

You work out 6 days a week with 1 day rest or an optional workout. Simply follow the calendar and you will see results in 6 weeks.

I have been a long time Jessica Smith follower on YouTube. I love her exercises, her cheerful coaching style, and her genuine personality. This is the her first DVD set that I purchased, and it's very well worth it. Her exercise is not hardcore difficult, but in a more gentle approach. You will feel the burn, but not feeling like you are killing yourself. I always get a good sweat and happy feeling after following Jessica for 30 minutes. I actually wake up everyday looking forward to that 30 minutes exercise.

There are 3 levels in most of the exercises. Easy (follow Jessica's mom), normal (follow Jessica), and hard (follow the other lady). I love that options so you can work your way up.

I have cervical degenerative disk and have been doing Pilates for three years. I enjoy the Tai Chi moves used in one of the programs that has really helped open my hips. I love the 360 abs because with my issues in my neck it is great to be able to do ab work in a comfortable and safe manner. I hope Jessica continues to come out with these programs that you can do for six weeks or 30 days. It is like having your own personal trainer.,1452211200,2,724,3.9931034482758623

I mostly felt discouraged by programs that say, ""anyone can do it"" but are not beginner-friendly enough for me, I guess. These are easy enough to keep up with but really give you a good workout. It can be kept low impact if you need it to be with challenging alternative moves when you're ready to push yourself. There's a good variety to the workouts to keep it interesting: strength training, cardio, core work, balance exercises, focus/brain training.

7541648,5,B0187Z2IR2,"(in depth review of the program routine-by-routine below)

I absolutely LOVE this series!  Ive been a devoted Jessica Smith exerciser since I received a free 10-Minute Solutions DVD in a cereal box featuring a few of her 10 minute routines in 2010.  Jessica Smith, single-handedly, is responsible for me having developed a healthy, active lifestyle, as well as an appreciation and desire for exercise.  Since that first 10-minute DVD, I went on to try longer, and more challenging routines by Ms. Smith, and to date, have collected, and regularly incorporate her workout DVDs into my daily routines.  Since I first began my journey, I have lost over 35 pounds, and countless inches, not to mention have sweated away symptoms of severe depression, fibromyalgia, and endometriosis.  While I tend to rotate back and forth between Jessicas programs and other high impact routines such as T25, 21 Day Fix Extreme and other similar programs, I do find myself always coming back full-circle to Jessicas DVDs as they are the best routines for MY body.  They are effective, fun and challenging, and I receive the same, if not better results from these programs, vs the more balls to the wall styles of workout programs that are popular as of late.

I found this program to be the complete package, PLENTY of cardio routines, from light to more advanced, as well as focused upper and lower body strength training routines, a routine for coordination, agility and mental development.  The hidden gems have to be the stretching and preventative routines.  No muscle or body part is left untouched with this system.  This is BY FAR, my favorite of her series  that encompass a specific program thus far.  If I had to pick just ONE of Jessicas programs, that had bits and pieces of all her previous programs that I loved the most, this one would be it!  It has it all!!!

>>>>DO NOTE: This series contains various styles of movement, and strength training, and is not solely a strict walking ONLY program, if you're looking for a walking style program, check out some of Jessicas earlier walking DVDs such as the Walk On: 5 Fat Burning Miles, OR Jessica's Walk On: Walk Off The Weight 30 Day Plan.

More on the specific routines further down.

****For reference, I am roughly a 145 pound, 35 year old female, intermediate to advanced exerciser.  I wore a Polar FT4 Heart Rate monitor during the strength and cardiovascular routines on this set, and depending routine, and effort, burned between  250 to 400 calories per 30 minute routine (Dynamic Stretch and Prehab Routine excluded).  I used 8-10 lb. hand weights for my heavy weighs, and 5 lbs. for my lighter set, with 3 lb. dumbbells for the Barefoot Fusion Sculpt routine****

Program Review:
1. Packaging:  This new set comes complete in a double, hard-shell case, which is an improvement over her last Walk On boxed set that included 3 DVDs in individual hard-shell cases, enclosed in a thin cardboard sleeve.  Not only is this space saving, but time saving as well.  The file folder style inner packaging contains 1 DVD on the inside of the front cover, two in the middle on its own holder, and another on the back inside cover of the case.  The 6-Week Countdown (schedule) as well as Jessicas Welcome and Fit Tips are also included inside.

2. Schedule/Fit Tips:  A large, poster style calendar is provided with a full 6-week schedule and boxes to check off your workouts as you go.  Week by week fit tips are also provided on the schedule, as well as 10 of Jessicas favorite tips to help you succeed with the program.  She suggests hanging these someplace you will see them each day, as a way to help you stay motivated and on track.

3. Required Equipment/Modifications:  Jessica suggests a set of light and heavier weights.  Depending on your fitness level, if you're just starting out, you can do the routines without weights, then start light, going upwards from there.  Jessicas Mom Debbie uses light hand weights (appear to be 1-2 lbs.) in some routines, and in others, no weights at all.  She also showcases the beginner modifications where needed.  Jessica, uses heavy and medium weights (10 and 5 lbs. respectively) and demonstrates the intermediate options, while Beth uses lighter and medium weights (3-8 lbs) yet demonstrates more advanced options with higher impact.  You will need a sturdy, high backed chair for some of the routines, a yoga mat or soft surface to work on, supportive footwear, and a hand towel, or yoga strap for some of the stretching work.  I used a flat resistance band in place of a hand-towel.

4. Routines:  There are 10 complete routines, each 30 minutes (a few run just a minute or two over, but nothing major).  In order:

a. Welcome To the Program:  A 8 minute introduction to the series, where Jessica talks about how the program works, and what to expect.

b. Cardio Party! (No Equipment Required):  A fun fitness ""journey"" thru several dance styles including Latin and Disco.  I am not sure how Jessica manages to come up with new moves, but there are some brand new moves, synched with the music style and beat.  I could definitely feel my entire body getting worked from head to toe, while getting an amazing workout and working my CORE!  It was great to see members of the Jessica Smith Community join Jessica for this fun workout.  I loved all the colors!!!  Everyone wore a bold colored top, and a smile.  It was hard to not feel HAPPY during and after the workout.  5/5 stars

c. Interval Mix (High Back Chair Required): My FAVORITE routine of the series!  Those who tried Jessicas previous Walk On series release, will find this very similar to the Pyramid Power Walk except its a bit longer.  You cycle through 4 phases of moderate to higher intensity exercises (modifications provided for higher and lower intensity) and a fast-paced heart rate spiking interval at the end of each interval.  I sweated buckets, and felt like a million bucks when I was done!  5/5 stars.

d. 360 Abs (one, light hand weight required, no more than 5 lbs):  This routine started off very reminiscent of Cardio Abs, with a lot of standing kickboxing style moves including punches and knee raises.  The routine then transitioned to standing core work using a light hand weight (Jessica recommends no more than 5 lbs) and is finished by a short floor routine section.  I am NOT a fan of crunches on the floor but surprisingly found the floor work was fun.  I loved the ""dead bug"" move, not only did it challenge my core, but also my coordination.  This routine was also a sneaky cardiovascular, and upper body strength routine.  5/5 Stars

e. Brain Fitness Fun (no equipment required, just your Thinking Cap):  This is a moderately paced, light cardio conditioning routine that uses upper and lower body movements, oftentimes in opposition, to force you to think quick, remember, or balance helping to improve coordination, memory, agility and response time.  This routine is probably the slowest routine of the set, in terms of cardiovascular effort, but still keeps the heart rate in the ""fat burning"" zone allowing you to burn calories, while you build neurons.  There is no equipment required for this routine, and it is all done standing.  It was a fun challenge to try and get my hands in the right place while my feet where moving.  It's going to take me several attempts at this workout to ""get it right"" but that's the fun of it.  I am only giving this routine 4.5/5 stars, because I prefer the higher intensity routines, and will likely use this one for an ""active recovery"" day or if I need to get some extra steps in.  :)

f. Barefoot Fusion Sculpt (a yoga mat or soft surface, and a set of light hand weights are required):  Don't let the ""barefoot"" name convince you this is an easy routine!  It was a challenge, and it was amazing!!! All you need is a set of light hand weights (I stuck with three and felt the burn) and as much space as the size of a yoga mat.  I loved the barre and tai chi emphasis (at the beginning and end of the routine respectively).  This routine could easily be done without hand weights, and yet remain an effective and challenging routine.  All major muscle groups were worked, including the upper body (shoulders, biceps, triceps, back, core, and lower body).  The multi-functional moves incorporated upper and lower body movements at the same time for increased caloric expenditure.  Core, balance and coordination was worked throughout with various standing poses that were challenging, yet do-able.  A modifier is provided for those with balance issues, or those needing to build up to a more challenging option.  There were lots of BRAND NEW moves in this routine.  Fans of Jessica's earlier ""Barre Fitness"" and ""Total Body Balance"" DVDs will love and appreciate this routine.  5/5 stars.

g. Total Body Training (a set of light, and heavy hand weights suggested) :  This is a multi-muscle strength training routine the incorporates balance (working one side of the body at a time) to really engage the core, while strengthening all the major (and minor muscles of the body).  The exercises are done in super-sets, oftentimes one side of the body does two different moves, and then you repeat on the other side.  There is only break enough to switch from lighter to heavier weights between sets, so it keeps the cardio effect up.  The moves are standard, but with a twist (think side lunge with hammer curl, chest presses crossing the weights above your midline or curtsy lunges with a tricep kickback to name a few).  After you've thoroughly worked the arms and legs, Jessica finishes off with a double set of abdominal exercises on the floor, and some light work for the back muscles.  I felt I worked more muscle groups in a shorter amount of time than I have with some of regular ""go to"" strength training routines.  I was very pleased with my self at the end of this routine, and see this being a regular part of my strength training routine from this point on.  The moves give you room to ""build"" allowing you to increase in intensity but increasing the amount of weight you are holding, or incorporating a more advanced option, demonstrated by Beth.  5/5 stars

h. Upper Body Strength (a set of light, and heavy hand weights recommended):  This routine incorporated a set of light and heavy weights (Jessica used 10 lbs for her heavy weights).  The routine started with a typical upper body workout, followed by heavy weights for the bigger muscles in the shoulders and upper back, and lighter weights for the triceps, biceps and the front of the shoulders before moving to the floor for some chest work with heavy weights, and some core work that challenged the upper and lower abs as well as the obliques.  I alternated between 8-10 lbs. for my heavy weights, and 3-5 lbs for my lighter set.  The routines are done in ""super set"" fashion, focusing on burning out the muscles with a moderate number of reps with higher weights.  I loved the incorporation of standing knee raises, and calf raises to incorporate the core musculature, and focus on balance, engaging the entire upper body at once, rather than just focusing on a single muscle group at a time.  5/5 stars.

i. Lower Body Sculpt (a sturdy, high-backed chair, and a set of light and heavy weights are recommended):  Another gem-of-a-workout!  I LOVE the target toning routines in this series!  This routine incorporates a set of light and heavy hand weights (I used 10's and 5's, but you can certainly go lighter or skip them based on your fitness level).  A sturdy, high back chair is also used for some of the moves.  The routine starts with a light warm-up, followed by a series if squats with the chair as a ""reference point"" for depth, some standing lunge work, leg raises, and floor work for the buns.  Because your working some of the larger muscles in the body, you get a great cardiovascular workout, without doing any actual ""cardio"" work.  This is one I am sure to feel tomorrow!!  It would be a great routine coupled with the Upper Body routine, if you want a longer, more ""full body"" workout.  5/5 stars.

j. Dynamic Stretch (a yoga mat and a hand towel or yoga strap is recommended, I used a flat resistance band):  This routine is a bit like yoga a bit like pilates and a lot LIKE JESSICA!  It is a delicious series of stretches, both standing, and on the floor that feels positively delightful.  You don't need a ton of flexibility to do this routine, and you don't need a lot of balance.  It feels amazing after a rough week!  Dont skip this one!!!!  If you're having a stressful day, this is the routine you need to get your groove back.  Fans of Jessicas Yoga Stretch for Beginners and Beyond will appreciate this routine fully.  5/5 Stars.

k. Prehab Routine:  (a yoga mat and a hand towel are recommended for this routine as well as a sturdy, high back chair and yoga mat if you're working out on a hard surface):  This routine is designed to build strength, and flexibility in the smaller muscle groups of your body, and inside the joints.  Its soothing, and relaxing, and feels so good!!!  Its similar in nature to the Dynamic Stretch routine, but focuses more in the tiny muscles in and around the major joints of the shoulders, elbows, hips, knees and ankles.  Its great for helping with added mobility, and to sooth aches and pains from sitting or standing all day. 5/5 stars.",1451692800,433,13396,4.7133017649591045
7541649,5,B0187Z2IR2,Love this set. It is a great mix of routines for the perfect amount of time (30 minutes). I have many of Jessica's DVDs and these are probably my favorite.,1451606400,2,155,4.2
7541650,5,B0187Z2IR2,"If you're looking for fun, low-impact, simple to follow workouts, this set is for you.  There are ten 30 minute workouts to do that combine cardio, strength training, and stretching/flexibility.  What I love the most is the calendar/chart that you can follow.  You do one of the workouts (chosen by Jessica) each day and can keep track of your progress.  (Actually, the 7th day of the week is an ""active rest"" day with an optional workout.)  I experienced a little muscle soreness at first (between days 2 and 3), but it quickly subsided.  Jessica knows her stuff.  You won't be killing yourself, but you'll sweat enough to feel like your workout is meaningful.  She is positive and supportive, and the other DVD cast members (her Mom and a family friend) are there to provide alternatives for every move.  If you want to take it easy, follow her mom, and if you want to kick it up a notch, you follow Beth.  This set is helping me work out consistently each morning, and that's exactly what I needed.  Thank you Jessica!  P.S. She's got hundreds of free workouts on her YouTube channel, too.  :)",1451606400,6,1096,4.616580310880829
7541651,5,B0187Z2IR2,"Let me start by saying that my all time favorite workout DVD program is Jessica's 21 Day weight loss plan, and I didn't think I could love anything else as much, but I think Jessica has really outdone herself with this program!!!  This program is so well rounded, balanced & complete!  It contains everything from cardio, HIIT, strength training, to relaxing stretches.  Best of all, all of the workouts are 30 minutes long, which is perfect for me (I'm a full time working mom).

Jessica doesn't include a nutrition plan, but for a good reason.  She explains why she doesn't believe in diets.  I have to agree with Jessica's philosophy on that because I've also lost 40 lbs that I've managed to keep off by listening to my body & making lifestyle changes, instead of doing those quick fix programs.

I consider myself an intermediate/advanced exerciser, so I mostly followed Beth & I felt great after each workout.  I now own over 50 workout DVDs & Jessica managed to impress me with some awesome never seen before combo moves (such as the curtesy lunge with the scoops in the total body training workout).  I do own a lot of the ""train insane, no pain no gain"" type of workouts, but I feel that those types of workouts are only good to do sometimes.  Ever since trying Jessica's 21 Day plan, I've learned that exercise can be low impact with high intensity, and working out should also be fun, NOT dreadful.  This 6 week program is a great follow up to the 21 Day program!

I hope Jessica's next project is either an 8 week program or a 90 day one!!

***UPDATE 04/14/2016***
I recently finished Jillian Michaels' Bodyshred 60 Day workout system, and towards the end of the last 2 weeks I started to experience some knee discomfort (which I've never experienced before).  As soon as I finished that program, I decided to immediately switch back to a low impact program; I was thinking about purchasing Beach Body's Piyo program, but then I decided to save my $$ & do another round of Jessica's 6 Week Transformation System, and I am SO glad I did!!  I'm currently finishing up with week 3, and the knee discomfort has completely disappeared.  Not only do I feel better, but I think I'm actually seeing better physical results from this program than I did with Bodyshred!!!  Absolutely amazing!!  Low impact does not mean low results!  This program WORKS!!!",1451520000,13,2357,4.64975845410628
7541652,5,B0187Z2IR2,"This is my review of the brand new Jessica Smith Walk Strong (4) dvd set that was released on Amazon this month. (my full review with pictures is on my blog)

I like getting calendars because it helps me stay on track with my workouts and I especially like that the calendar tells you what disc the workout can be found on! For example, day 1 is Cardio Party which is on D1 (disc 1) and day 2 is Total Body Training which is on D3 (disc 3).

Jessica Smiths welcome message is 7:43 mins long and explains that her program is meant to be a lifestyle transformation, not a diet or quick fix program.

She states that this DVD set is for all levels and shows low impact and modifications, and is a mix of workout styles. All the workouts are 30 mins each and all are used during the 6 week calendar rotation.

Jessica then goes through each workout in this set showing mini clips and talking about each one.

EQUIPMENT YOU WILL NEED FOR THESE WORKOUTS:

*Lighter set of dumbbells for the shoulders, arms, and upper back area.

*Heavy set of dumbbells for the legs, chest and back area.

*If you don't have any weights you can use (2) 16oz water bottles which equal 1 pound each.

*Mat or Towel to work out on.

*Sturdy high back chair with no arms.

*Hand Towel.

The cast is the same in this dvd set. Beth shows more advanced exercises and Debbie shows modifications and easier exercises. Jessica alternates between the two but mostly does intermediate movements.

All the workouts begin with a motivational quote picked by Jessica; followed by the list of equipment needed for that specific workout.

All the workouts have a 30 minute timer that is displayed on the bottom right during the entire workout.

All the workouts have a couple minute warm up and couple minute cool down and stretch.

In all my reviews I like to mention the full workout time, and whether the movements are standing or on the floor for those that have issues with doing floor exercises or who have issues getting up and down.

Workout 1/Disc 1
Cardio Party
30:50
Equipment: NONE

This is the only workout that has more than 3 cast members. You do movements like hamstring curls, side to side v steps, skaters and speed bag arms. I wish the music was louder in this one-I felt like I could barely hear it. But it was a fun, group workout!

Workout 2/Disc 1
Interval Mix
31:05
Equipment: Sturdy Chair

There are 4 round of intervals. There is a little bell that sounds so you know when to do a faster cardio pace and then you have 30 seconds of a movement using the chair, like mountain climbers. Beth does not use the chair-she uses the floor which makes it harder.

I definitely felt some tension in my shoulders after this workout because of using the chair for intervals; but after some stretching and water, they felt fine.

Workout 3/Disc 2
360 Abs
31:15
Equipment: (1) single light dumbbell (no more than 5 lbs) I personally used 3 lbs. during this workout.

For the first several minutes of this workout, Jessica did boxing type movements like jab/cross/knee, which I really enjoyed!

From 23:35-29:24 you are on the floor for some exercises.

Workout 4/Disc 2
Brain Fitness Fun
31:10
Equipment: NONE

The beginning part of this workout reminds me of her other workout called Brain Booster from her 5 fat burning miles dvd. The whole workout is not a repeat, but I did recognize some of the exercises. You will definitely have to think and concentrate during this workout, so I would suggest doing it when its quiet with no kids around. I felt like some of the exercises were a little complicated with doing both leg and arm movements, so sometimes I did just the leg movements.

I liked that all through out this workout, there were brain booster tips and quotes by Dr. Pasinski on the bottom of the screen that you could read while exercising.

Not one of my favorite workouts because I had to concentrate so much on it, but still good!

Workout 5/Disc 2
Barefoot Fusion Sculpt
31:20
Equipment: 1 set of light dumbbells and bare feet.

You begin by using the dumbbells after the warm up at 6:30 and continue using them non stop through 26:55. Most of the movements are flowing, ballet type inspired.

I would guess that Jessica and cast are using 1-3 pound dumbbells during this workout. At the end she does some Tai Cheng style movements.

Workout 6/Disc 3
Total Body Training
31:15
Equipment: 1 set of light dumbbells and 1 set of heavy dumbbells

You begin by using the dumbbells at 3:55 and stop using them at 24:50. You alternate between light and heavy weights through out this workout depending on what exercises she is doing. Debbie just uses 1 set of light weights the entire time. I am guessing that Jessica uses 5 or 8 pounds for her heavy weight but Im not sure.

You will be working out on the floor, on your knees and back, starting at 20:10 through the end of the workout.

Workout 7/Disc 3
Upper Body Strength
30:45
Equipment: 1 set of light dumbbells and 1 set of heavy dumbbells

You begin by using the dumbbells at 3:30 and stop using them at 20:20. You alternate between light and heavy weights through out this workout depending on what exercises she is doing. Debbie just uses 1 set of light weights the entire time. I am guessing that Jessica uses 5 or 8 pounds for her heavy weight but Im not sure.

You will be working out on the floor, on your knees and back, starting at 17:55 through 29:05.

Workout 8/Disc 3
Lower Body Sculpt
31:30
Equipment: 1 set of light dumbbells, 1 set of heavy dumbbells and chair

You begin by using the dumbbells at 4:36 and stop using them at 20:15. You alternate between light and heavy weights through out this workout depending on what exercises she is doing. Debbie just uses 1 set of light weights the entire time. I am guessing that Jessica uses 5 or 8 pounds for her heavy weight but Im not sure. You also will use the chair though out this workout as well.

You will be working out on the floor, on your knees and back AND using the chair, starting at 20:15 through 27:50.

Workout 9/Disc 4
Dynamic Stretch
31:10
Equipment: Hand Towel or Yoga strap and Bare feet

This is a great stretch using the hand towel though out this entire workout. You will be getting on the floor at 15:10 and remaining there until the end of the workout.

Workout 10/Disc 4
Prehab Routine
34:50
Equipment: Chair, Hand Towel and Bare feet

You use the hand towel and chair though out this entire workout. You will be getting on the floor at 17:12 though 28:10. This workout is completely different from the Dynamic stretch but both would be great to use during active recovery days.

I like that they show body facts on the screen off and on during this workout.

Final Thoughts:
Overall, I really enjoyed this set! My favorite workouts were the 360 Abs, Total Body Training, Upper Body Strength, and Lower Body Sculpt.

Out of the 10 workouts: 2 workouts are stretching, 5 workouts use dumbbells, and 3 workouts are cardio with no weights.

Because this set uses cardio during all 8 workouts, the dumbbells used would never be more than 5 or 8 pounds otherwise you could injure yourself with the faster pace of the workouts.

I would consider this set a good mixture of cardio and strength training, but if you are looking for a strength training workout to increase your weights and lift heavy-this workout would not be for you.

I am looking forward to starting this 6 week challenge with Jessica Smith and a couple of my friends next week.

According to the 6 week calendar, you exercise 6 days a week with 1 rest day being on Sunday.
1 day a week would be a stretching workout.
On week 1 there are 2 cardio days and 3 strength training days.
On week 2 there is 1 cardio day and 4 strength training days.
On week 3 there are 2 cardio days and 3 strength training days.
On week 4 there is 1 cardio day and 4 strength training days.
On week 5 there are 2 cardio days and 3 strength training days.
On week 6 there are 3 cardio days and 2 strength training days.

I was given a complimentary copy of this DVD set in exchange for an honest review on my blog and social media-all opinions are my own.",1451520000,22,8121,4.460081190798376
7541653,5,B0187Z2IR2,"Jessica has rapidly become my favorite at home fitness instructor. Over the past six months I've purchased, completed, and loved all her workout programs.  This new series is no exception.

I'm only on my second week of the Walk Strong program, but have cycled through enough of the workouts to know its a fantastic series. Jessica brings new ""choreography"" to this series, so it feels fresh.  As someone with arthritic knees, looking for low-impact/high intensity workouts, this, as with all her other workouts, fits the bill.  Jessica leads each workout with her usual positive (but not over the top) personality.  Her sensible and motivating leader style includes modifications for all fitness levels.  The variety of workouts (strength/cardio/flow) makes it an easy program to follow while keeping one interested.  You'll need light to mid hand weights (I personally use 3-5 lb weights), a study chair, and a towel or yoga strap for the workouts.

I'm a fan of countdown clocks in workouts and these videos include one in the lower right of the screen.  There are some familiar faces in her classes (Hi Beth & Debbie!) and all skill levels following along.  If you're just starting out or a seasoned veteran, this workout is for you.  Each 30 min DVD  can easily fit into any schedule as a singular workout or in addition to another workout.

I've already recommended this new release to a few people who have expressed a desire to get fit in 2016 but didn't know where to begin.  There is no diet plan included in this program.  Go for it, you won't be disappointed!  Well done Jessica!",1451433600,6,1591,4.837037037037037

Jessica managed to balanced well between her walking/ low impact workouts and her more vigorous workouts on the Youtube channel. Her movements are simple yet burning and effectively rev up my endurance, stamina as well as my muscle tone. It`s a very balanced workout suitable for everyday routine, this one won`t make the high impact girls out there yawning, and the low impact fans huffing and puffing, I promise ! Thank you so much Jessica, this is what exactly that I needed !",1451433600,6,617,4.669724770642202

8741691,3,B0187Z2IR2,"None of the workouts, for me, approaches the 3 workouts on ""Build Balance + Inner Strength"" or even ""Walk On 21 Day....""  Less creative.  Music less interesting.  I was bored doing each one.  I'm not sure why her DVD's vary so drastically in terms of content and creativity.  Perhaps that is a plus for some, but I regret buying this.",1535155200,,334,4.5
8741692,5,B0187Z2IR2,"I am so glad that I found Jessica Smith workouts and purchased this set.  I have been doing Jessica's workouts consistently now for 2 weeks and I have already noticed improved strength, energy, and weight loss.  On this DVD, Jessica explains everything thoroughly and works out with a fun group of people including her two regular assistants - her Mom, Debbie, and her team member, Beth, who handles the higher-impact version.  I bought this workout for several reasons:  I need to lose weight (10 lbs.) and get toned up especially before the holiday season hits; I needed to get back to healthy eating and fitness (over the course of a year, I gained the weight due to a first-year teaching job in which I had no time for anything - seriously, all I did was work - even on the weekends - it was awful and one of the most stressful experiences of my life), I needed workouts that were lower intensity but that would still help me lose the weight while not getting injured.  In addition to all this, I want workouts that I look forward to doing so that I'll stick with it and not dread getting up in the morning!  I love the Cardio Party, Total Body Toning and the Brain Walk for a ""rest day"" walk.  These workouts are fun and effective and as long as you are eating healthy and staying focused on a lifestyle change, you will see a transformation.  I usually do two Jessica workouts per day (one in the morning and one in the later afternoon).  I find that this works best for me to really up the calorie burn but it is not really necessary to do two.  You can just do one workout and still lose weight as long as you are mindful of portion sizes and calories. (Jessica's 30 Day Weight Loss DVD is awesome too - I have started that also and I LOVE IT!!!). Why is it that walking is not perceived as a good workout?  Walking is so underrated and these workouts prove it...I am sweating after completing them; yet they don't kill my knees and I don't get injured.  What's not to love?!  The most important thing is that I really look forward to doing these routines - I actually want to do them and can't wait to pop them in and get started.  I have never felt that way about any other workout, except ballet.  I love working out with Jessica and her team because they are real people...not fake models who seem not to have one ounce of cellulite anywhere.  Also, Jessica's personality is really pleasant - she is very genuine and it's like you are hanging out with a bunch of friends.  I have never been a gym person, so I really enjoy that.  This is a great way to transform your body and completely change your lifestyle in a painless and super-fun way.  Enjoy!",1534464000,2,2662,4.363083164300203
