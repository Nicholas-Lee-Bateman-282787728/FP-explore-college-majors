7964771,4,B000068TOO,"four great westerns for under $10.00 you can't go wrong. if you like though,you can get these same movies and more in the 10 pack sets this company offers. still if you want to get just these 4 or just want to try them out first,this is the way to go.",1146355200,4,251,3.9411764705882355
7964772,5,B000068TOO,"Five stars is given for these reasons: a.  Mr Brando's directorial effort resulted in  one of the best REVENGE westerns ever made. I rate it up with UNFORGIVEN and worth frequent revisiting. It is the FIRST of FOUR films on this collection.  Mr Brando is also one of the most beautiful men ever to grace the cinema, and his movements, whether killing, jumping, standing, or throwing over a table and exclaiming "" Stand up you scum sucking pig (and die) ""are balletic and poetic in form.  b.  The films stand alone with no extras and that's fine by me. c.  ....  True Western lovers, of which I am one, can watch just about any western and get something out of it.  Although the other three films aren't masterpieces, they're ok (we call them oaters )with some sterling actors.  Enjoy - hey, for ten bucks it's better than a poke in the eye with a stick!",1076025600,,853,4.451612903225806
