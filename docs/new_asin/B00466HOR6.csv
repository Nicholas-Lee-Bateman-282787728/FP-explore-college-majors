4264871,5,B00466HOR6,"As a child, I frequently watched all those old Hanna/Barbara cartoons like Johnny Quest, The Herculoids, etc. This show is the perfect parody of those old cartoons past. It makes fun, but also celebrates those types of shows. Season 4 turned up the reference meter to 11, and really brings up brilliant parodies of classics, like the Hardy Boys, Batman/Superman, Astro Boy, and more. If there could be one complaint about this series, its that the build up plot points so frequently, only to have it turn out to be almost entirely unimportant. I would recommend this series to anyone with a love of classic cartoons, prog rock, or intelligent humor. Excellent show.",1296691200,8,665,4.893805309734513
4264872,4,B00466HOR6,"the venture bros is an outstanding tv show that has endured the years. the latest season of the show yet was split in to two and aired at different dates, which also caused the dvd to do the same.

season four is an improvement in every way from season 3. the show just broke apart from its comfort zone and decided to take a gamble, we find the ventures in the hands of recovering pedophile Sgt. Hatred, the boys are finally growing up, new characters are introduced and some get even more spotlight than ever before. this season makes the show feel fresh again, it might not have the charm season 1 and 2 had, but at the same time it's so much better without it.

part 1 of season 4 is incredible, there isn't one episode that doesn't make you laugh out loud. it definitely deserves its spot on the AS schedule. of the eight episodes the highlights would definitely be handsome ransom, perchance to dean and self medication as these episodes turn up the laugh o meter to eleven. they are just wacky humor that just gets you every time.

part 2 is a hit and miss. most episodes feel just awkward, i for one expected the revenge society to become something much more than it was ""shown in bright lights, dean city"", or to be at least present in the finale, at hope that they get more screen time in season 5. speaking of the season finale, i get that the creators wanted to take an alternative route to the usual explosive ending the other seasons had. this episodes present so many plot points that get resolved on itself that it's just WEIRD. many characters got so many twists and turns that make you question if they are the same character you watched for a whole season. there are so many other ways a non violent ending could have worked, but hopefully they make up for it in season 5.

I remember that i began watching the show in the 3rd season and i got bored to death. it wasn't until i watched the earlier seasons that it began to grow on me. if this is your first season rest assured, there are many more laughs than in season 3.",1296518400,5,2041,4.321148825065274
4264873,5,B00466HOR6,"Yeah, it sure is a drag that this season was split into 2 releases, even worse that after I pre-ordered volume 2, a short while later there was an announcement on Amazon that the entire season four would be released in Blu-ray on the very same day (to add insult to injury), but with a show I love as much as this one, I'll refrain from my usual tirades, rants, conspiracy theories, vitriolic cursing and death threats, bite the bullet and remind myself how fabulous the second half of this season was. Brock's back in all his glory, Sphynx plays an integral element with Hunter at the helm along with Shoreleave now an important and hysterical addition, Whitey and Billy feature prominantly, Molotov Cocktease and her comrades are back to up the ante, the Monarch is ever-present along with his henchmen and muse, the adorable yet husky-voiced Dr. Mrs. the Monarch, the Guild is fleshed out a bit more and the Triad is afoot and, somewhere in the midst of all this monumental madness, Team Venture manages to get a bit of screen time as well. On top of it all, the one hour season finale is probably one of Adult Swim's crowning achievements. I can't wait to see these episodes again.

4264940,5,B00466HOR6,"This is a season of major changes, but it leads to so many great things for future seasons.  Luckily, the discomfort of getting out of the structure created by the first two seasons is aided by foreshadowing from season three.  With season four, you see that Publick and Hammer have had a very ambitious vision that they are unwilling to compromise (which is great news for us).  Things take a very strong turn, but what dislike you may initially feel towards this brave new world is coming to terms with the fear of a change that could be detrimental to something that is already good.  I can assure you that the show never loses its integrity, minute attention to detail and story structure, or its humor, poignancy, and knowledgeable dialog concerning so many elements of what I'll vaguely call ""nerd culture.""  Season Four proves what Season Three already hinted at: the creators never just throw an idea (be it a character, story-line, theme, etc.) to the wall just to see if it sticks.  Every element of the content is nurtured and meditated upon until it is ready to join the story.  Nothing is ever forsaken, however minuscule, and is always brought back in a way that only adds to the story (Professor Impossible is a good example that doesn't give too much away regarding spoilers).

The Dr. Orpheus episodes really shine, but, beginning with ""The Diving Bell vs. The Butter-Glider,"" the major evolutions of the narrative really start to reveal themselves in the most delightful ways.  The humor is as strong as ever--exceeding season 3 and rivaling season 2 (which is perhaps the strongest season).  However, don't let my reverence for the second season lead you to believe that it's all down hill from there: The Venture Brothers remains consistently strong all the way to Season 6.  Aside from the show's innate hilarious nature, the creators have a strong acumen for illuminating the shallowness of certain widespread trends in nerd culture while still managing to remain reverent to certain works and pieces (they certainly aren't afraid of letting their opinions known).  One of the great elements of the show is that is doesn't talk down to its viewers when using referential humor.  For example, when they fashion a character that alludes to a monster from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, they don't just let the allusion rest to show off their expansive knowledge but show that they are fully aware of what they're talking about through acknowledging that they are using an allusion in a specific way: leaving viewers in an interesting position of skipping looking up a reference and focusing on what dialog is actually established with the twist on the allusion.

The animation only continues to grow in beauty, the voice-acting is brilliant (and VERY under-appreciated), and the narrative complexities keep getting better.

Aside from a nice gallery of new characters, the evolution of the primary characters is given full attention.  Hank, Dean, Brock, Rusty, The Monarch, Dr. Girlfriend, 21, Dr. Orpheus, Billy, and Pete all go through massive changes: some subtle, some abrupt, all great.  Billy and Pete are always golden scene-stealers.  Orpheus, who has a very realistic past despite his esoteric and mystical line of work, is given more development than he has in past seasons (along with the Orpheus specific characters like the Alchemist).  Sergeant Hatred enters the story in a new way, and he is a wonderful wreck of a man.  Of all the characters, I would say that Hank (who paradoxically changes by staying the same) and 21 are the characters who contribute the most depth to this season, and that was hard for me to say because I honestly love all of the characters.  Brock is not as present, but that's a major point and serves a purpose to the story.  I think the story-line I most enjoy, however, is Dr. Girlfriend/Dr. Mrs. The Monarch's singularity as a character.  Aside from the many different elements of humor she brings to the story, her narrative is possibly the most fraught with struggle and inner-turmoil.  It's so hard to pick a favorite story-line from this season because so many plots change is great, entertaining, and exciting ways.  It's just as fun and hilarious as it is artistically magnificently and poignant.

Among long-running, adult-oriented animation, it is almost peerless.  The creative team behind the show work tirelessly to make something that they can be proud of, and they should be.  Unfortunately, despite claims of new-found critical attention to animation as a ""worthy"" artistic medium, this show continues to be overlooked in favor of live-action critic favorites that only perpetuate certain conventions of story-telling that have been monotonously praised--shows that take less effort and risk to produce content that still panders to a very narrow critical consensus of what is dubbed ""good TV.""  Cartoon Network, however, has been bold enough in their selection of programming to allow animators a place to voice themselves and repeatedly show how animation as a more than valid medium, and you'd be hard-pressed to find any show that rivals the genius of The Venture Bros.

PS - Before moving on to Season 5, you should watch ""A Very Venture Halloween.""  It explains a number of season 5 changes that might seem random if you haven't watched that glorious special.",1458604800,,5338,4.984216459977452

The jokes are no longer quick one liners you have to pay attention to get, they repeat the joke over, and over, and over, then explain it to you just in case you missed how ""clever"" the writers are.
I hope it gets back to it's roots because this is one of my favorite series (esp. being old enough to have watched the original Johnny Quest (and being a comic fan)).

4265143,3,B00466HOR6,"If you've made it through 3 season of Venture Brothers, season 4 is probably worth picking up.  The basic dynamic of the show has changed a bit, with several major characters becoming secondary, and many secondary characters becoming central to the story.

The jokes are, unfortunately, beaten to death.  Whereas in the past Venture Bros was very good about dropping unexpected lines and references in and just letting them be funny, this season the writers seem determined to make SURE you did not miss a joke.  They do this by repeating them over... and over... and over.  At one point the characters THEMSELVES almost seem to notice this ""We get it already!  You've already told us that..."" but that doesn't stop the same tired punchlines from showing up again and again.

The storylines become far more intricate this season.  Instead of one-off episodes that can stand on their own merits, most of this season is tied with previous episodes in some way, and missing something early in the run can become a problem later on.  You might consider this a plus or a minus depending on your own particular taste.

Overall I think I would recommend watching the season if you are already a fan of the show.  The basic humor still holds up and it is certainly worth a chuckle or two.  If you are iffy on Venture Bros to start with now might be a good time to call it quits.",1397520000,2,1370,4.592592592592593

4265201,5,B00466HOR6,"If you're a Venture Bros. fan, this review is superfluous.  You already own this DVD box set already (or the Blu-Ray version) or your mouse cursor is hovering over the ""Add to Cart"" button.  Don't read any further, just push the button!  This review is for people who haven't been turned on to this marvelous show yet.  There are many things you need to know.

The Venture Bros. is one of the most intelligently-written shows in the history of TV.  It is screamingly funny, it has amazing action sequences, it has probably the most complicated backstory in the history of complicated backstories, and it is a true labor of love.  The show is ostensibly an hommage/parody of the old Jonny Quest action super-scientist cartoon genre, taking the perspective of ""what if Jonny (Doc Venture in this show) grew up, inherited his Dad's super-science gizmos, realized he didn't have what it takes to be a scientist himself, and was angry and bitter about how he was treated as a kid?""  And what if he had two clueless kids (the eponymous Venture Brothers) who have no idea what it's like not to live in a super-science compound?  And what if he was surrounded by a bunch of other people as schmucky as he was, including lame super-villains, over-the-top macho secret agents, assorted hangers-on, and the occasional competent person who wonders what he's doing in the midst of all the chaos.  But I can't do justice to the story in less than 20 pages; it's _that_ complex.  It's worth it, though, because it's so interesting and the characters, despite their failures, are so appealing you want to know everything about them.

The other thing you need to know is that this is the cult show to end all cult shows.  It is utterly uncompromising.  The creators (Jackson Publick and Doc Hammer) assume you have watched all the previous seasons, and they delight in basing stories on minor plot points of earlier episodes that you've probably forgotten about even if you have seen them (the episode ""Any Which Way But Zeus"" is a good example of this).  They also pepper each episode with hundreds of pop culture references ranging from very obvious to unbelievably obscure (part of the fun is trying to figure them out).  So be warned: you need to watch the previous seasons (all of them!) before watching this one.  Also, DVD is really the best way to watch the show, preferably on a computer.  That way, you can rewind if you miss a reference or ten, and you can pause if you want to go online to the many Venture Bros. fan sites to figure out where you last saw such-and-such a character who just popped up out of nowhere.  You'll also probably need to listen to the episode commentaries to really understand every last detail, if you're obsessive about this sort of thing.  This sounds like a lot of work, and it is.  It's actually kind of ridiculous how much time I've spent chasing down Venture Bros. references, but it's worth it because it makes the show that much more enjoyable.  Season 4, part 1 is excellent, but part 2 really hits a new level of awesome, with almost every show being a classic (the one-hour finale in particular is jaw-dropping).  Along the way, the characters that you know and love are given greater depth and you start to feel compassion for them (even the villains), even though they're still pretty much losers.  In particular, we start to realize that Doctor Venture isn't just a failed super-scientist, he's also the product of horrible parenting from his famous super-scientist dad who warped him so much he's unable to function normally.  And every other character has some kind of similar backstory explaining why they are the way they are.

I haven't given you many details about the episodes, both because it would take way too long and because I don't want to spoil the fun.  If you like intelligently-written, clever, and amazingly twisted comedy, you will love this show.  And watch out for that finale!

4265203,5,B00466HOR6,"The fourth season of the Venture Brothers is odd in many ways.  There are episodes where the brothers never appear, episodes where Dr. Venture never shows up--and yet it maintains the quirky humor that makes the entire series so entertaining.

I believe however, although a few episodes may not have 100 percent of the pure magic the first two seasons had, the show continues on a path to greatness. Sure we may focus on the Venture family a bit less but we are treated in to a much more grand view of the world they live in by being able to peek at the lives of their villains and friends.

It brings together everything you've seen in the previous seasons, and it's first older brother, Season 4, Vol. 1 finally shows the direction this show is going in, and I love it!",1359504000,,335,4.090909090909091
4265245,5,B00466HOR6,"The Venture Bros goes from strength to strength.  My favourite episodes from season four are Hansom Ransom, Self-Medication, The Better Man, and Everybody Comes to Hank's.

Hansom Ransom finally introduces us to Captain Sunshine, the Monarch's other nemesis.  And the good captain is just as weird as we would expect.

Self-Medication takes Rusty Venture to group therapy and we meet other easily recognizable former boy adventurers.  Rusty actually experiences some character development in this!

But it is with The Better Man and Everybody Comes to Hank's where we see the real strength of the show and it's creators: character development.  In The Better Man Orpheus finally confronts The Outrider - the man Tatiana left him for.  But the real knock-out is Everybody Comes to Hank's.  While Dean is off on an internship at Impossible Industries (and gets an episode to himself for this) Hank runs, among other things, a detective agency - it's the hat - and takes the case of Dermot's mom running late picking Dermot up - with surprising results.

I don't think the fourth season is quite as strong as the third, but still excellent over all.  A couple of episodes, The Diving Bell Vs. The Butter-Glider for example, are, well, a bit episodic.  The story is there, but some of the scenes feel disconnected.  I think this is more of an issue of trying to cram too much into an episode and then having to cut out the excess.  The ideas in The Diving Bell Vs. The Butter-Glider could have been developed into two episodes.

Who would like this?  I'd like to say ""everybody"" but my girlfriend isn't too interested.  I'll say this - if you like comedy and have read comics, grew-up watching popular science fiction and adventure movies and television from the 60's to the 80's you should like The Venture Brothers.  The great writing is an added bonus.",1359504000,,1851,4.822222222222222
4265246,2,B00466HOR6,"I want to really like this season, but it feels like the series is trying to convince you that supporting cast members can pull the show along. Gary and his partner where funny in the background as they showed us what we would be like as security guards, hiding out and completely unaware as to what we are doing, now that dynamic is gone and we are left with a Brock Sampson replica. Sgt. Hatred just comes across as a poor mans substitute for a loss of Brock, and other supporting characters like the Alchemist are pushed to the forefront and lose some of their charm. The simple small jokes that made me laugh in the first three seasons are expanded to create whole shows leaving me thinking ""I saw that already"". The best episode in the season is when the boy adventurers get together to solve the death of their councilor, because it returns to the Hanna-Barbara parody it once was. The good thing about the Blu Ray is you are not forced to buy the season in two parts like the DVD. The special features are okay, but nothing I could not have lived without. I have yet to listen to all the commentary, but it would have to be pretty informative to wow me at this point.",1359331200,5,1174,4.340909090909091

SUCK IT UP AND GET THEM!  A lot of these types of shows go downhill fast in later seasons.  Voice actors leave, writers leave, the whole feel just changes.

4265265,5,B00466HOR6,"I have been hooked on the Venture Bros for years now.  As a Johnny Quest fan in childhood, I did not realize how much I missed ""adventure"" shows until the Venture Bros came on the air.  The show has been consistently funny and well-written.  It takes a few viewings to get every joke, so the DVD set is worth purchasing to re-watch again and again.  I was put off when the creators split up this season, but it's hard to argue with results.
My only warning is not to let kids watch during episodes like ""Operation P.R.O.M."" because of the language.  It's not censored out on the DVDs, so keep that in mind.",1353888000,,606,4.327433628318584

The shows are jam packed with references (mostly jabs) to iconic characters and shows such as Johnny Quest, the Fantastic 4, The Hardy Boys and others. If you enjoy a show that pokes fun of your childhood favorite characters while standing on its own as an original program, the Venture Bros. might be what you need to survive in this brutal world of success stories.

Jackson and Doc failed miserably in their attempt to tell a coherent story. Instead of tying up loose ends to satisfy the viewer, they decide to pack in more dialogue as fast as possible to satisfy their writer's egos, as if dialogue is the most important aspect of a cartoon. You could learn something from Jonny Quest other than parody gimmicks, like TIMING. In a cartoon, chaos doesn't equal action, chaos equals confusion. And isn't it about time you employed some real voice actors that can enunciate the lines so I don't have to listen to the same line 3 times to understand the joke? Jackson, Doc, I'm looking directly at you. Jesus, boys, slow down the pace and thin the dialogue and that might help bring the show back to its oh-so-long-ago great status.

At the end of season three I thought this show was done, Doc and Jackson had burned out and it wasn't going to be good any more - but they rescued it somehow, and season four is AWESOME.  The writing sparkles, the animation looks great, and they avoided 99% of the mistakes they made last season.

There is a lot of cussing, but instead of being out-of-place and jarring like in season three, it works (except for the very last F-bomb, which still feels _wrong_ .. you'll know it when you hear it).  Also in this season it really becomes obvious that too few voice actors are doing too many characters .. but these are minor flaws, overshadowed by how much sheer FUN I had watching this season.",1319846400,,757,4.378571428571429

4265327,5,B00466HOR6,"I was somewhat fortunate to get into the Venture Bros. late (as in 2010 late) so I was able to nab this on Blu-Ray instead of buying each part seperately on DVD.  Nothing chafes my ass more than when distributors or whoever's responsible decide to split seasons into parts, so I'm glad I looked around first instead of completing this action-packed, surprisingly well-written show on impulse.

I don't get fussy over ""extras,"" ""super mega limited collector's editions,"" exclusive packaging, etc., but I have the first 3 seasons on DVD, and tend to get anal about keeping series of a show/movie saga all in one format, so if you have the same pet peeve then I'll say that this is one of those rare cases where it's not only acceptable, but highly encouraged to cross over (provided you have a device that plays Blu-Ray media), as you get the entire season uncensored (not just PT 2) on one (1) disc, as well as a handful of extras.  Jackson Publick and Doc Hammer are intriguing and brilliant writers who put together a funny, riotous, and clever show with equal measures of comedy and action.  Pop culture references run amok throughout the series, and Season 4 is no exception.  I catch something new almost every time I rewatch an episode, and the jokes range from outlandishly slapstick to ""downright esoteric.""

 In a word:  FUN.  Of course I recommend starting from the beginning of the series, as there are some pivotal changes that come with Season 4 (Brock being replaced by Sgt. Hatred being one), but for the sake of convenience and cost, even if you have the previous seasons on DVD, I strongly recommend getting the 4th season on Blu-Ray.",1316563200,,1650,4.7212543554006965

When this season started I wasn't sure I was going to like all the changes, that were taking place. I was so set in my ways with the way Doc Hammer and Christopher McCulloch had placed all the characters. As the season went on I could see how things were developing and started to embrace the changes. The season ended up being just as amazing as the previous three.

For some this may not be a drawback. For me this was one of a few. This season was fraught with not only short syle episodes but too many characters. I love every character as much as the next Venture Bros addict but this season it seemed to me that Doc Hammer and Jackson Public were trying to cram 3 seasons in one. Now this does have an explaination that I will go into in a moment. there were diabolicaly exstenuating circumstances.

Adult Swim a subsidiary of Cartoon Network and as some might say a bit of a black sheep is hurting in my opinion due to the jackassery that is now the Anime Industry.

Anime is going the way of many genres in that the market for it is slowing down. Soon it may disappear completely as evidenced by the recent bankruptcy of TokyoPop a manga and anime production company. Some may argue that Venture Bros is not Anime but to some of us die hard fans we came for the Anime and stayed for the Venture Bros.

In my humble opinion Cartoon Network/Adult Swim needs to give Jackson Public and Doc Hammer (the Creators of the Show) more leaway. They created a cult classic and it needs to be recognised as such. Recently due to their online blog I have learned that Venture Bros has been signed on for two more seasons. This is a happy thought for me let's all just hope that the production value and artistic sensability remain on par with the second season (my personal Favorite).

Unfortunately, I can only give this 4 stars due to the fact that it's only half of the whole season.",1305504000,2,1815,4.84516129032258
4265354,2,B00466HOR6,"Let's get the good points out of the way, first.  It's Venture Bros, it's hilarity.  They kept the pace up from Season 3 (which was admittedly a much weaker season than 2) and the episodes largely deliver.  I am pleased with the content.

Now, the bad.  Nevermind how absolutely obnoxious it was for them to divide Season 4 into two shelf-space-consuming volumes of skimpy content (and THEN release a single Blu-ray disc with everything on it), but the picture quality of the DVD is so ridiculously bad that I have to wonder if somebody deliberately jacked up the transfer to promote Blu-ray sales.  Seriously, the picture quality is awful - worse than the original airing.  Heavily pixelated with occasionally highly visible compression artifacts, each frame simply looks terrible.  What's worse is that the picture JUMPS.  It's shaky.  Somewhere near the bottom of the image data there is an occasional ..uhh.. 'horizontal line' .. missing.  It causes the entire image to resize to compensate, visibly shifting the image downward a few pixels or so.  I'm finding it difficult to describe without using much television jargon, I apologize - let's just say there is an image transfer error and it causes the episodes to jitter.  Obnoxiously.  Frequently.

I rather hate this release and really want my money back, but I know that's just not going to happen and be more trouble than it's worth at this point.

I was terribly excited to get Season 4 on Blu-Ray.  When it got here, I hurridly opened my prize and was... a bit underwhelmed.  One simple DVD and a single sheet of paper offering free shipping from the Venture Bros. store.  Granted, there is a badass still of Brock from S4 Ep. 1 on said sheet of paper, but I was hoping for - I don't know what.  Just something.  Alas, alack.

The DVD itself is crisp, sounds great, and is wonderful.  Deleted scenes, though mostly just storyboards with voice, are a nice addition.  I've only watched one commentary track so far (Ep. 1) but I suppose it was as entertaining as I expected it would be.

The audio is good True HD, as I can actually hear all the different channels (layers/tracks) of audio, and subtle sound effects. - 9/10

The video is the only downfall of this BD, yes folks that is right.
The animation this season is the best and still looks very sharp and vivid on BD, but because artifacts show up often on the characters/backgrounds it's not perfect.
It's mostly three or four times an episode that someone's shirt will have a thousand blotchy boxes all over it. Maybe it's just my Sony HDTV, but I kind of doubt it since the season three BD has like maybe six scenes total with minor artifact issues. I get the feeling that this should have had a more accurate transfer, or maybe it needed to be two discs like it was going to be.
That is it, one minor (or very annoying depending on how much artifacts bug you) flaw in my opinion keeps this disc from being the best TV season BD ever. - 8/10

All in all this set is easily five out of five stars just as season 3 BD was, the creators Jackson Publick and Doc Hammer have really out done themselves with this new season, a huge special thanks should go out to them for all the hard work they have done. The next two seasons should prove to be very exciting for the Venture clan.

Go ahead and buy this BD now, or regret it later.",1300838400,31,2405,4.4063205417607225
4265385,5,B00466HOR6,"Venture Bros Season 4 V2 is simply better and more from Jackson and Doc.

Each season seems to bring more nuanced plot, in depth characters, and tender sub plots from a show that still manages to be, at the core, a 22 minute comedy show.

If you're picking this up you've already watched the previous seasons so you have an idea of what you're in for - but it is so much better than you could have imagined.

If you're a Venture-enthusiast let me say this - the comedy for this half of the season is astounding, and no it still is barely about the show, but isn't that why we listen to Venture commentary?

Pick it up, marathon the show, and eagerly wait for Seasons 5 and 6.",1300752000,5,675,4.209302325581396

The only con is that there is no art inserts in the blueray, usually venture bros has tons of art on/in their packaging but sadly it's not the case with the bluray re release",1490659200,,379,3.986842105263158
