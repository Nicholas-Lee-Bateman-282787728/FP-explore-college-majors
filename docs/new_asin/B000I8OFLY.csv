2654109,2,B000I8OFLY,"Welcome to a world where gym mats are flying, where cloned chorus members robot-dance their way through the score, where the audience need to wear 3D glasses to appreciate the staging in Act II (wait, which staging?), where Ascanio and Venus appear in their sleeping bag, and where poor Silvia has to sing all her part in a rather ridiculous ballerina outfit...As my previous reviews of the M22 will certify, I am not at all opposed to modern staging. On the contrary, they can help us be enlightened on classical work (Finta Semplice and to a lesser extent Mitridate being two cases in point so far in this collection). But here it seems to me that both David Hermann and Christof Hetzer, responsible for this mise-en-scne, couldn't care less about the audience nor for Mozart's work for that matter. Like Joachim Schloemer in Semplice, Hermann uses actors to cut through the recitatives and make the piece more ""actionable"" from a theater standpoint. But while Schloemer had a concept (the artist in front of his/her creation) and an utter respect for the work (Semplice remains a comedy all along), Hermann simply makes the actors announce the numbers and mime their way through the piece. The actors also dub the singers during the recitative bit, which after a while is very annoying and tend to turn the singers into concert artists with a suit.

Is it a result of this very upsetting staging? In any case, the musical quality of the performance is not quite at par with what the M22 collection has offered us so far, which is a shame because the music of Ascanio is actually much better than the very static Betulia Liberata, for example. Iris Kupke and Sonia Prina are quite tame in the parts of Venus and Ascanio. Charles Reid does not have a pretty tone while in the central part of Silvia, Marie-Belle Sandis has a rather rough, acid voice. It is true that with her outfit she looks frankly ridiculous all the way through which may have inhibited her musical performance.

There are two redeeming factors though: the very dynamic and musical rendering of Adam Fischer, gloriously conducting the very virtuoso Mannheim National Theatre Orchestra, and the beautiful coloratura of Diana Damrau, the Queen of the Night of our generation, accurate and pure as crystal. Only in her two arias do Mr Hermann and Hetzer show a bit of taste and respect for the score that they are supposed to ""revisit"". This is not much.",1168300800,24,2422,4.764285714285714
2654110,3,B000I8OFLY,"This is a very modern production with many ideas I didn't understand.

8144553,2,B000I8OFLY,"""Mozart is lucky he's dead"" wrote one critic when reviewing David Hermann's M22 staging of Ascanio in Alba. The reviews for this have been universally dreadful. Ascanio in Alba is one of Mozart's most richly inventive and sublime early operas. Most disappointingly, however, Hermann's production is neither, and the scathing reviews are dead on.

Although Adam Fischer's conducting of Mozart's music is lucid, the Italian secco recitatives are disconcertingly replaced by monotonously tepid narration (supplied by two narrators). Christoff Hetzer's set design required 3d glasses for the premiere audience, which is a telling sign for what comes off like a first year art school student production that reduces transcendental mythology to inept, adolescent science fiction. The Star Trek-looking Alban shepherds appear as badly white-wigged robots who break into frenzied, epileptic seizures as they sing their chorus to Venus. Ascanio (Sonia Prina in bald wig) appears hopping across the stage in a sleeping bag and then gets plopped onto a stack of green, rubber gym mats (those mats reappear time and again for Ascanio to sort of dance with, on, and around). The Alban shepherds reappear, minus face paint but now with Groucho Marx mustaches, what looks like diapers on their heads, and potted plants in their arms. Diana Damrau is an all too brief, charming high point as Fauno on a swing. Silvia (Marie-Belle Sandis), adorned in an embarrassingly ill-fitting ballerina outfit, is thrown into a wheel-barrel, and wheeled onto stage by her chaperone, Aceste (Charles Reid), who wears a fur jacket over a golfing sweater. In equal opportunity fair play, Silvia gets her time on the pile of green gym mats and her chance for a spotlighted slaying in the spirit while the narrators repeatedly fall, get up, fall, get up--like children playing in a cowboys and Indians game. The gym mats become mobile Lego sets, and the narrator finally puts on 3d glasses himself (in order to let the audience know that they need to follow suit?) The meeting of Ascanio and Silvia finally takes place on; you guessed it, a green gym mat.

Prina, Damrau, and Sandis are in excellent voice, making this infantile travesty all the more a tragically wasted opportunity.

8144554,1,B000I8OFLY,"This is K. 111, an early pastoral Opera by a youthful Mozart, setting to music an Italian libretto by Giuseppe Parini.

This DVD from the M22 collection shares with the others in the boxset the strong technical qualities of good image and DTS sound; I won't add any more comments on the technical side.

Adam Fisher conducts in 2006 the Orchester des Nationaltheaters Mannheim.

Iris Kupke is Venus, Sonia Prina is Ascanio, Marie-Belle Sandis is Silvia, Diana Damrau is Fauno, Charles Reid is Aceste, Christian Banzhaf is Voyager 1, and Katharina Vtter is Voyager 2 (these ""voyagers"" are the narrators, see below).

The Chor des Nationaltheaters Mannheim is terrific, as is the orchestra. Singing, as in all other discs of this series I've watched so far, is excellent across the board.

Again, the stage director (David Hermann) adopts the annoying concept of substituting spoken German narration for Mozart's recitativo accompagnato. We get two narrators, one male and one female. I didn't like this solution before in other DVDs of this boxset, and I continue to dislike it here.

More Regie stupidities are present in the predilection for epileptic seizures this staging seems to have. Chorus members, actors, narrator often engage in seizure-like movements, when they're not behaving like zombies or Frankensteins, sometimes under stroboscopic lights (I guess they want to induce seizures in the audience as well). Why do these idiotic stage directors think that such shenanigans are cool? It's a mystery. I can't fathom who advises these folks or applauds them when they do such things. I have impulses of slapping them silly and making them write 200 times on a blackboard: ""I am dumb and I do dumb stagings.""

The poor chorus members are very much abused by the stage director. Some sort of chorus singers union should file a law suit. They have to wear silly mustaches, carry around pots of fern (why?), engage in - what else? - seizures, while trying to sing sublimely (they do manage the latter).

If you can get past the silly and annoying staging plus the narrators interrupting the beautiful music all the time to describe the action in a language different from the original one adopted by the libretto, then you may enjoy the musical aspects of this piece. You get a very good orchestra expertly conducted, a very good chorus, and very good singers singing beautiful arias.

Diana Damrau looks impossibly cute as Fauno, and steals the show in her aria Se il labbro pi non dice, which she sings while she is pushed around on a swing. It's her on the cover picture, but the picture doesn't do her justice. She looks cuter on the DVD. Unfortunately, Diana sings only twice, it's a small role. When she comes back for her second aria (which she sings just as well) it's exactly the same set-up with the swing. I guess the director ran out of more ""clever"" ideas to make it different, but one is thankful that he didn't make Diana have a seizure. She does give to the narrator a pair of 3D glasses at the end of the aria. Oh wow, bravo, Mr. Hermann, this was *really* artistic, 3D glasses, how clever! There are some geometric figures on the floor drawn on green and red so supposedly if the audience wears 3D glasses as well they'll be treated to some squares and rectangles in 3D. This certainly makes Mozart's music much better, right, Mr. Hermann? Oh boy... By the way, don't be fooled by the cover picture - Diana's two scenes are the *only* moments in this production when the visuals are not utterly ridiculous. Everything else goes downhill from that.

Contralto Sonia Prina in the title role does very well in vocal terms - if only she didn't have to engage in jerky movements all the time like a half-finished Frankenstein...

The costumes seem to be aiming for some sort of contest to pick the most ridiculous and silly looking garments, and they do a good job at that.

The tenor singing Aceste has a very beautiful soaring voice, but the poor guy has to wear a fur jacket. His character is a priest. One wonders why in the hell a priest downs a fur jacket. Whatever.

Marie-Belle Sandis in the role of Silvia has mostly a beautiful voice, with some failures (see below). Again, I'm impressed with how this festival was able to book scores of excellent but unknown singers.

So here is the bottom line. Some imbecile named David Hermann thought - ""I'll look very clever if I stage this opera with ridiculous costumes that have nothing to do with the libretto, and add to the mix lots of seizures and robotic jerking - it will be certainly received as high art. The bad part is that there's this annoying music by this old timer Wolfgang, so let me throw in a couple of narrators to interrupt it at all times so that the public doesn't get distracted by the silly music and pays attention instead to my clever high art.""

The only thing that saves Mr. Hermann's production from being one of the worst fiascoes of all times is a group of stubbornly talented singers and musicians who in spite of all the abuse can still render beautifully Wolfgang's excellent arias, choral music, and terrific overture.

Not recommended, unless you rip off the sound track, edit out the narrators' voices, and just listen to the singers and the orchestra. Since this would be too much work, just get a CD of this opera instead; there are six or seven options in the market, and you'll be spared all the silliness.

Edit - at the very end in the final trio both the tenor and the soprano show some vocal strain, so I'm bringing down a notch my enthusiasm for the singing. The contralto continues to do well until the end. Hey, but on the other hand, the stage director treats us to gym mats and the narrators keep walking around, tripping on them and falling, how clever. This certainly makes up for any vocal strain, you know, people tripping and falling, that's funny, right? No? Yeah, I didn't think so either. What a mess of a staging.

In the ""Making Of"" bonus feature, the stage director and the set/costume designer Christof Hetzer (who should share the blame for this mess) say that they were given ""the freedom to change the work."" You mean, to ruin the work, right? Why in the hell did you think that Mozart's work needed changing???

I'm also very disappointed in Mr. Fischer. As a seasoned conductor, he should show more respect for Mozart's work. He says in his interview that the way the stage director changed the piece, it helped because then Mozart's recitatives didn't sound silly. Really, Mr. Fischer? Because I think they weren't silly to start with, but your underlings made it so. Talk about denial! As the musical director, sir, it was your responsibility to preserve the musical integrity of this production, and you failed to do so.",1310774400,4,6761,4.699915469146238
8144555,1,B000I8OFLY,"The only saving grace of this production is the quality of the singers. The rest was Horrible with a capital H. The blocking, scenery, costumes, and just overall concept were just so utterly horrific it was almost laughable. Especially the chorus in fencing attire twitching and thrashing around like there was something wrong with them.

The singers themselves, especially Ascanio and Venus are flawless in their technique and tone, but the director did something unforgivable by making them look bad. Not enough can be said about how awful this production is. The only reason I had the misfortune of suffering through this is because it was the only DVD of Ascanio in Alba at the time. If only someone had warned me...",1260489600,2,720,4.901639344262295
8144556,2,B000I8OFLY,"I did choose to watch this selection from Mozart 22 tonight because the occasion  called for good music and just enough activity on stage to link the songs ( oh, well, arias) together. Almost any acceptable ballet company in the world could have put together some interesting movements to do the job, almost any costume designer in the world could have given us some appropriate garb for male and female, any acceptable set-designer could provide scenery which would at least not detract from the performance. Apparently none of these were available for this production since it almost managed to drag down into its muck the pleasure of quite good singing and orchestral accompaniment. I,too, pitied the female cast which had to perform such awkward gestures in about the most embarrassing dress  as I have seen on stage while the men might better have come in their rehearsal clothes and just stood leaning casually against a prop until their part was called for. It is really not a case of modern vs. traditional, it is a case of satisfactory vs. awful.",1246406400,,1055,4.855555555555555
8144557,1,B000I8OFLY,"I agree with everything negative stated previously.  It seems to me that this production fails to understand the most primitive (hardly the only) reason we go to the theater.  We want to see people who are more charming and attractive than we can hope to be in everyday life.  And to judge from the behind the scenes interviews, the performers fit the bill nicely--at least until the costume designer and makeup artists get their degrading hands on them.  The lovely woman who sings Ascanio is transformed into a middle-aged man with receding hairline, Sylvia wears a joke of an unflattering tutu, whose dark spot on her panties when she turns around makes it look like she had an accident resulting from stage fright. Please German directors--stop hatin' on your casts and your audiences.",1243468800,2,789,4.909774436090226
8144558,1,B000I8OFLY,"I haven't seen all of the Salzburg M22 DVDs (from the 2006 Salzburg Festival), but of the ones I have, this is definitely the worst. It is what the German's call ""Regietheater"" -- director's theater -- on steroids. The notes with the album state that the director creates ""an almost unique way of listening more suited to the concert hall"" -- which suggests that you might as well listen to it without watching any of the stage action. In fact, that makes sense, because the production offers Mozart's music, performed very well (like most of the M22 productions), with action that has almost nothing at all to do with the music or the text. The singers emerge and return to a sort of warehouse at the back of the stage, the chorus shuffles and hops around audibly during the music, Ascanio appears to be a spastic imbecile, Venus looks like a ghoul, and the nymph Silvia is brought in in a wheelbarrow. Recitative is replaced by reciters who become demented during the course of the performance. None of this serves to illuminate Mozart's original work in any meaningful way.  It is true that is hard to take the mythical, symbolic story of 'Ascanio in Alba' seriously: it was written for an imperial wedding, with Venus representing Maria Theresia, Ascanio her son and so forth. So the score does what was expected for such occasions, which is to glorify the royal family, and there is no real drama. But there are emotions, and it is these emotions that Mozart's music expresses -- remarkably well for a 15-year-old composer. But the stage action undercuts, mocks and contradicts those emotions, reducing the music to nothing more than pretty noise to accompany the director's bag of tricks. Mozart, even the young Mozart, deserves better; his work, however antiquated today, deserves a production that respects the music for what it was intended to be and takes its expressive meaning seriously. This production does not provide that. Better to buy a CD and listen to the score and spare yourself the distracting stage action of this production.",1239321600,2,2049,4.837606837606837
8144559,3,B000I8OFLY,"The most annoing things about this production is that the actors, Voyager I and II, spoke most of the recitatives as the singers on the most part were making hand jestures to go along with the spoken words, and the Voyagers' weird distracting seizure movements, jestures and bodyslamming themselves to the ground while the singers sang. It's amazing how the singers could focus on their arias and keep their composure. I would have given at least 4 stars if the Voyagers were omitted. The great music and singing saved this production from complete disaster.  I think Charles Reid and Iris Kupke deserved more credit than they received. I like their voices.  It is too bad that they cut out Aceste's  other aria from the second act. I wish that the role of Fauno was more involved with the other singers.  There was no relationship to any of the other singers.  Diana Darau just floats down from the rafters on a swing, sings, then floats away. Cutting out the recitatives made the singers detatched from all emotion and each other. Too plastic.  I hope the next production of this opera is more true to life and true to Mozart.",1206576000,10,1128,4.671717171717172

K) The management of the Festival should be called to accountability!
L) MOZART AND THE PUBLIC DESERVE BETTER THAN THIS!
I would have given it one star only but, the singers, conductor and orchestra deserve five stars; the stage directing and production zero.  The Salzburg Festival, Mozart22, the opera going public and especially the Home Viewing public, let alone the composer deserve better.
