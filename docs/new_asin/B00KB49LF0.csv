8657218,4,B00KB49LF0,"It sounds like Drive a Crooked Road (1954) with Mickey Rooney as a wheelman.  That flick isn't bad.

This one has Robert Ryan and Stewart Granger in it.  It's from 1965, but still a Black and White film.  Has some good elements in it, it isn't great, but still worth a peek.",1453420800,,274,4.211538461538462
