Keith Urban knows how to deliver anywhere he plays worldwide! He can make theatres and arenas and play like it is just you and him.

3663308,5,B001K2KMFA,"Hi Folks,

I picked  this up at WalMart today for $10...I believe  they have an exclusive. What we have here is Keith in a BIG arena show as opposed to the smaller hall he played in the GRAMMY winning ""Livin Right Now"" DVD. I prefer the previous DVD by a great margin. The show is  more intimate...the filming  is  better that performance has more of a connection...perhaps this is due to the nature of how an artist has to perform in a huge arena and the problems with filming ..particularly the ""in the round"" section.  There are bonus features...mostly goof ups and a 15 minute making  of that is mostly a movie of Keiths face in different  cities...kinda strange actually. This is however on its own merits a terrific DVD and great 2 hour show and for $10 has to get a 5 star review.  If you have the other DVD this is  different enough to not be a waste of your time...if you have neither I'd certainly start with the first...and I almost forgot there is a sort of ""rough"" video of the song ""you look good in my shirt"" as another bonus...and did I mention..this kid Urban can play guitar...I mean he gets  busy on  that thing!!",1226534400,14,1132,4.358851674641149

3663354,5,B001K2KMFA,"I like Keith Urban he has a good voice and he's a good singer. I am watching it right now.

 I like his songs.  I like his wife also. She's a good actor. Nicole Kidman makes lots of movies.

 Her movies are excellent and so us Keith Urban songs.

 So therefor I will give five stars.",1376697600,,283,3.9464285714285716
3663355,5,B001K2KMFA,"Even though I am not musically inclined whatsoever, I enjoy listening to music. I started listening to Keith with the Golden Road a and Be Here albums; I was going through a personal transition and listening to his music really helped me define my life and my own transformation. About a five years ago I really got into listening to music from lesser known artists and accumulated many CDs and I forgot all about Keith. Last year during another life transition, I rediscovered Keith and bought all his other albums and his two concert DVDs. Once again - his songs have helped me through the transition of experiencing the passing of my father. I have bought this DVD and given them as a gift for my friends and family.",1374883200,,719,4.5813953488372094
3663356,5,B001K2KMFA,"You could tell on this DVD that Keith was happier with his life because of all that he had gone through in his past. The song that he wrote to Nicole ""GOT IT RIGHT THIS TIME"" (THE CELEBRATION) definitely was a celebration by the words that he chose to honor his love for her!  MAKING MEMORIES OF US was another song that was very moving!  Both of these songs brought tears to my eyes because of the beautiful words & the feelings that Keith put into these songs. Every song that Keith sings on this DVD every person can identify with in more ways than one. The 2 songs that I have picked would make wonderful wedding songs while the couple stood up @ the altar or their very 1st dance with one another @ their reception. I definitely would choose to use the CD of Keith's because there is no one that can sing these songs like Keith can!! This DVD was definitely worth the money!",1374451200,2,879,4.25748502994012
3663357,5,B001K2KMFA,Keith is a really great gitar player and has a way of drawing the crowd right into his music. Buy this DVD you will love it!!!!!,1369612800,,128,3.9615384615384617
3663358,5,B001K2KMFA,"This is a really good live Concert video, great sound great songs played really well. Keith may be considered country but his guitar work ie hot for any genre and his songs have a cutting edge that bring them in to an adult contemperary format. I see a future that crosses musical borders and boundaries",1366848000,,303,4.527272727272727

3663362,2,B001K2KMFA,"First off, I want to start out by saying how much I love Keith Urban as a musician, songwriter, etc...BUT...why do the camera men find it necessary to change frame every 4 to 5 seconds! Or panning in and out, zooming all over the place. Do these people think as a society we can not sit still for more the 1 minute and focus on something (I blame this on new generation, video games, but that is a completly different topic) I mean when Keith is doing one of his amazing guitar solos, the cameraman is viewing the crowd or the back of Keith. It is absolutly ridiculous. You want to see him play, etc...I was nauseous after the first 5 minutes. I forced myself to watch it, only to be looking away every few minutes because you literally can get dizzy. The song choice/sound/band was great...but big disappointment on the filming end. So sad to say this one will go in the closet or be played on tv when I am doing something where I want to hear only music. His 1st concert was much better. More intimate. Word of advice to all these artists...TAKE CONTROL OF THE VIDEO PEOPLE!!!",1359504000,9,1078,4.3681592039801

3663373,5,B001K2KMFA,"I've never been a fan of ""country music"" and am not sure Keith Urban should be pegged as such: he ROCKS! I was vaguely aware of him after making a name for himself here in the U.S. but it wasn't until I happened upon one of his music videos on CMT that I really took notice---I mean I REALLY took notice! Aside from being mighty easy on the eyes, this talented singer/songwriter/musician is impossible to ignore. I haven't had the pleasure of seeing him perform in concert yet but it sure looks like ALOT of fun! He's a class act: humble, appreciative of his fans, and clearly having the time of his life doing what he so obviously loves. He's not afraid to have a laugh at his own expense, and his humor and enjoyment in what he's doing are so infectious that he brings his audience right along with him for one heck of a ride. I can't help but rock along with him, even from the couch, and then he'll switch to a ballad so beautiful my throat starts to tighten up. As his career has progressed he's opened himself up more and more in his lyrics, and when he sings them you know he means them.
The man is a truly gifted musician, whether playing a variety of guitars with incredible skills(he's a maniac!)or accompanying himself on keyboards for a tender ballad. I'm sure the country ""purists"" might have a problem with his style: Hank Williams he ain't, but I'm all for diversity in any musical category and am pleased to see so many artists ""crossing over"" into other genres. (Good job, Robert Plant!) This DVD, as well as the 2005 ""Livin' Right Now"" and the 2010 CMT ""Crossroads""  collaboration with John Mayer, is one good time from beginning to end---and you don't want it to end! If you can't get to a live concert, having him in your living room ain't a bad thing. Keith: give me more.",1296086400,2,1793,4.400602409638554

3663377,5,B001K2KMFA,"I have seen Keith in concert 11 times and each one of those shows are a memory I will never forget. The excitement of a live Keith Urban concert is like nothing else and I truly beleive that this dvd captures that thrill. I've watched this dvd more times than I can count and love to pull it out whenever I don't have any plans to see Keith in the immediate future. Watching this concert feels like you have the best seat in the house at one of Keith's live shows. Not only does it offer the chance to see Keith's raw emotion up close and personal, its packed with hillarious outtakes that any fan will love. This dvd is the absolutely perfect solution to any fan craving their Keith fix.",1279584000,,688,4.259541984732825

Keiths guitar playing is a thing of beauty, he will go down in guitar history as one of the great all time country guitar pickers, but this guy ROCKS",1257379200,,863,4.076470588235294

not a fan of the director with the clippings in between some songs, can't believe Keith allowed this...
the last tour DVD was awesome as well and had NO interruptions....
just buy it!",1240358400,,339,4.666666666666667
3663388,4,B001K2KMFA,This is a great DVD for any Keith fan as well as anyone who wants to experience a fantastic live show.  Nothing beats being there but this DVD gives a good view of what it is like to be at a Keith Urban show.  I do agree that Living Right Now was a tad bit better but this one is worth having.,1231718400,4,293,3.7096774193548385
