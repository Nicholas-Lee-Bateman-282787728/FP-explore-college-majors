4251167,4,B0042JGGEO,"There are 4 16-minute walks on this DVD, and a short, standard cooldown session. The DVD comes with a tracking card where you can record your workouts and how many miles you have walked so far.

Walk 1: Bob - The standard basic steps, no sweating. Feels like an easy aerobics session.
Walk 2: Sione - Walk with weights, some upper body workout involved.
Walk 3: Bob - Higher cardio workout with jumping jacks and skater movements.
Walk 4: Tara - Light upper body workout with a medicine ball.
Cooldown: Tara and Sione - Leg and arm stretching.

I tried all 4 walks and the cooldown on my first try, overall I found it quite enjoyable, with low impact for the knees. This is really a beginner DVD, but it is easy to bring it to an intermediate level by adding jumps and crouches with the steps, moving your arms around at the same time, and using heavier weights or even weights you can attach to your legs or wrists. My favourite sessions were Walk 2 and 3, because of the upper body workout, and the high cardio with Bob.

If you do not own a medicine ball you can use a heavier weight instead which you can hold with both hands. If you do not own weights, you can still go through the workouts, as they show how to do the moves without them, but I recommend having a pair to have a much better, useful workout.

I wear a BodyMedia FIT (aka the BodyBugg) and it recorded a total of ~6,500 steps for all 4 walks, and a calorie spend of ~425 calories (if you do the ""intermediate"" level moves).

Note: This DVD also comes with a few rebates and special offers inside, such as a code to download for free the Biggest Loser Workout Mix Top 40 Hits Vol. 1 (a 1h mp3 compilation to drive you through any workout), a rebate for the Biggest Loser Meal Plan and Know Your Number Health Score subscriptions.",1292025600,182,1798,4.3076923076923075
4251168,2,B0042JGGEO,"Why did Bob even bother to make this video?  He looks bored to death, along with everyone else.  The only one with a genuine smile is Sunshine.  I'm out of shape and it was even boring for me.  It's just a poor copy of Leslie Sansone's videos.",1291593600,7,243,4.1063829787234045
4251169,4,B0042JGGEO,"This is a DVD that is designed to meet your basic exercising needs, especially if your job mainly involves just sitting behind a desk all day. You will find that the power walks can help you to stay healthy without too much stress on the body. This is especially true if your metabolism has been slowing down, as is the case as your body starts to mature beyond the thirties.

I really like the low impact cardio that this DVD provides, it lowers blood sugar and cholesterol naturally (without the use of tablets) and leaves you with that extra energy to get through the day. At first when you start with Walk 1, you may feel that Bob wants to drain you out, but after a few days, you will find that your body starts to enjoy this and calls for more.

At this point you can step up to the next level of the walk. So as you overcome each level, you can take a up a notch on the DVD. There are 4 levels in all. I recommend it, especially if you are a couch potato.",1291420800,8,962,4.111702127659575
4251170,2,B0042JGGEO,"I received this DVD yesterday and previewed it before I started to use it. It has four one-mile walking excerise segments.  Bob is in Walk 1 and Walk 3 as the exercise lead.  He is not an active participant in the actual walking excercises. He does provide basic instruction throughout on correct posture and counting down, often getting right into the camera, but most of the time he is literally walking around, among the others who are actively doing the walking exercises. I found this distracting, even with choosing the option of seeing the video with music only and no instruction. While fast forwarding the DVD during my preview, this was more apparant with Bob looking like a mouse constantly scurrying through a maze. Walk 2, 4 and the Cooldown are good, led by two former Biggest Loser contestants, who exercise with the others during the walking segments. If you want a walking exercise DVD with an instructor who is not afraid to exercise and sweat with you, then I recommend Leslie Sansone or someone with a similar style. If this does not make a difference to you, get this DVD. It's fun to see former Biggest Loser contestants and exercise along with them.",1291334400,8,1172,4.740196078431373
4251171,5,B0042JGGEO,"I ordered Power Walking because I wanted to  supplement my workout.  I thought it would be easy. There was no ""taking it easy"" with this DVD.  I thought I did power walking but this was a whole new level of walking.  I tried it out yesterday and I will say it is an excellent DVD for Beginners.  If you don't finish the whole mile then do what you can and gradually build up.

The current season people are in this and several others from earlier seasons.  Tara and Simone (from a previous season) do the cool down.

It has a three week program to follow in which by the end of 3 weeks you will have walked a marathon (27 miles).  There are four 1 mile walks about 20 minutes long  and a 5 minute cool down.  Somedays you do 1 mile gradually working up to 2 miles.

If you want to supplement your current workout than I would say purchase it.  If you are a beginner to exercise this is the DVD for you.",1291334400,60,902,4.085714285714285
4251172,5,B0042JGGEO,"I love Biggest Loser Power Walk, It's great for days when i want to take it easy and just do low impact.

4251177,5,B0042JGGEO,Good Workout. I assume that this video is including amateurs or people from the show. It makes a difference to me that all the people are not in sync and really look out of step.

There are four 1-mile walks so you can choose which one you want to do, or do all 4 of them for a 4-mile power walk workout.  My personal favorite is walk #1 with Bob and the BL contestants.  It is GREAT if you are just starting out!  If you want more of a challenge or work up more of a sweat, add some 2 or 3 pound hand weights to take it up a notch!  I like doing this at the beginning of my workout as a warm-up routine because it definitely gets your heart rate up but it is not TOO intense like some of their other workouts.  If you have recently made the decision to start working out and live a healthier lifestyle, or if you simply want something a little different to incorporate into your current workouts, I highly recommend this DVD!",1467676800,2,807,4.037735849056604
4251194,3,B0042JGGEO,It's good variety if you want a break from Leslie. I bought a digital copy and it's a bit annoying to use. I can't select which segment I want to watch. I either have to fast forward or rewind to find the segment I want. This is made worse by the fact that for some reason Amazon Prime on Samsung does not let you preview as you fast forward. I just have to stop to check where I am.,1466380800,,383,3.8607594936708862

And even with each individual workout, there's a person doing a modification if you need it.  This is my go-to for days that I want to power it up and get a good workout and for days that I'm not really into it and just need something simple that I can kind of go through the motions.  I know, how does that make sense?  Well, just depends on which workout I pick.  And I can do it in the comfort of my home!  Bonus!",1465257600,3,570,4.026785714285714

It doesn't require extras or a lot of space. My favorite part is that the people working out are not already ""fit"" it's just real people working out changing their lives.

I have several videos that I like that are 30 minutes, but I needed something I could do on my 30 minute lunch break and not get sweaty. I had my doubts about how good this would be, but after a week I'm sold. There are 5 mile long walks which take about 20 minutes each. They are fun, entertaining, and somewhat challenging, but you won't be dripping with sweat. It's just what I was looking for. I find even on days when I haven't had time for anything else, I have no trouble making time for this. The oyster.complaint I have is there is no menu to choose which walk you want. I find walks 2 & 3 more challenging. This may be because I purchased the downloadable version  I could keep on my tablet.

The levels of difficulty are pretty accessible if you have not been exercising AT ALL but are used to exercise in the past, and don't have too many basic physical things to hold you back from exercise in general.
The enthusiasm and encouragement from Bob Harper seems genuine and unforced. I like watching him. He is not annoying or intrusive.
You can go at your own pace as you progress, as long as you are able to walk.

I was getting tired and bored of Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred but since it was helping me lose weight I wanted to add a new video to rotate it. I originally purchased this video as a ""slow down"" day compared to Jillian Michael's video. Boy, was I wrong. Yes the video isn't ""HARD"" but my legs were hurting for a few days after this video. I was using muscles I do not use apparently in the JM video's.

This video is divided up in four 15 minute walks. I usually do 2-3 at a time. I enjoy seeing regular people do workouts and like Bob a lot. Wish he was doing every walk. I do not care for the blonde woman.  My only complaint is because it is nonstop walking they do not slow down to show you the steps and extras you do as you walk. It is a lot more cardio than just simply walking and because you do not stop walking EVER you can't focus on the new cardio movement as it switches.",1424304000,,995,3.9949748743718594

Mile 2 and 4 are done by the other two instructors (first the man, then the woman).  They both appear to be making it up as they go along with pointless twittering between them, and that just irritated me.

I am use to doing Leslie Sansone's series, & yet I couldn't feel the burn in those as much as I did this one. Even the 1st mile made me sweat more than the entire DVD of Leslie's did.

Walking is one of my favorite kinds of exercise, but I live in MN, so I can't walk outside with the kids much of the year. This video is great because you can select one walk at a time. I usually have time for at least one, but if one of the kids wakes up early from their nap, I'm not in the middle of a 50 or 60 min. workout. It's easy to fit in one or two of the walks during the day and great that I don't have to leave the house! Bob is great, but so are the others. Walk 2 and 3 are my favorites, but they are all good.

All are a quick way to get in some cardio in the house with minimal equiptment.  They are also less cheesy than some other walking workouts where the participatants have a huge smile the entire walk.  It will appeal to both men and women.,1363046400,,395,4.077922077922078

With Leslie I hardly broke into a sweat, but with Bob I was sweating like crazy! The workout is broken into 4 separate 1 mile workouts. The only thing that stopped me from giving this 5 stars was that Bob Harper is the instructor for only 2 miles. The other 2 miles are lead by Biggest Loser contestants.

So I walk inside with this video and enjoy my warm house!  You don't need much room, some of the segments use light weights.  I enjoy using the weights because they increase the intensity, but you don't have to use them.  You can get a mile in in 15 minutes, or do the whole thing in over an hour, or anything in between, depending on your time/energy.  Love it!!",1359849600,,517,4.12

Well, well, well -- I have now run out of excuses ... all I have to do is pick a time when I feel rested, pop the DVD in and I'm walking.  On my living room floor.  And stretching. And sort of running...  again, in my living room, with a fan pointed at me and the air conditioning blasting.  Awesome!

I had a great time doing my first walk last night.  It was fun and challenging( for me at least).  I worked up a little sweat and got my heart rate up.

taking about 20 minutes and you walk a mile, with a choice to move

that there are Biggest Loser contestants in the video, rather than slim

the routines are fine,
Good pace and energy, it is a nice change from Lesly Swanson and Jane Fonda.
Also I like the fact that it is shot in an exterior sunny setting  and not in an indoors studio, Love that.

The only reason why I do not give it a 5 stars is that it does not really have a cool down so the routines just stop all of a sudden . It does have  a stretching session at the end but it is not a real cool down.
Also i really do not like the stretching session as it does not feel professional , it is rushed and because  you play the videos more than once, after a while the goofing around gets really old.

I have bad knees, making a lot of the exercise videos difficult for me to do - I have the biggest loser workout for Kinect and find it frustrating because of all the exercises that are bad for my knees - but this is low impact and still gives you a good workout. I'm not in the best of shape, so I've stuck with the first walk, but there are three more that get gradually more intense. Bob instructs the first walk, Simone the second, Bob the third, Tara the fourth. There's also a cool down at the end with Tara and Simone. I've done Walk Away The Pounds in the past and I would consider this comparable but I think this walk goes more quickly - it's not boring.",1332288000,2,772,4.052287581699346

However, there really is NO cooldown, you just stop and go right into stretches, which I do not like.  The stretches were also very brief & somewhat awkward for me, so I am not a fan of that portion of the workout.  I don't watch the show, so that doesn't affect me one way or the other.

4251413,5,B0042JGGEO,"I almost didn't buy this based on the reviews. I have a Leslie Sansone walking DVD that has 4 walks on it. (1, 2, 3 and 4 mile walks) I'm able to do the one mile and I tried the 2 mile and got to a mile and a half. It's not that I'm out of breath but my calves burn so bad that I can't continue. She uses the same 4 or 5 steps over and over, for some reason it really hurts me, and it doesn't feel the same as going outside and walking a mile. I'm on the road to recovery after an extended illness with over 7 months in the hospital. Sometimes I don't realize how unfit I am, so the poor reviews about how this wasn't a good workout almost swayed me to skip it. Then I saw it was on Amazon instant video and it was only 7 dollars so I gave it a try and I'm really glad I did. Personally I don't care if some of the exercisers get confused or miss a step. I don't care that all 4 workouts aren't led by BOB, although I love him dearly. And I don't care about music, and if Bob does all the exercises. I care that the workout gets me fitter, and helps me build endurance. After 6 weeks with Leslie Sansone I've not gained any endurance and several times almost quit because of the pain in my calves. This walk has a variety of moves, as well as gentle bursts of cardio to get you fit. I'll still use the Sansone video and would recommend it for those trying to get in shape, but this one is my favorite of the two. I like the variety. I'm not sure if I would be able to do the whole one mile without my previous 6 weeks of walking, but I did complete the first mile and was breathing hard, and got a bit sweaty. If you are an advanced exerciser you probably won't get much good out of this, but if you are recovering or just starting, it's worth 7 dollars. It's worth 20. The only thing about buying on instant video is that you don't get the marathon workout schedule. I may but a hard copy just for that.",1320537600,13,1904,3.9097938144329896

I like it because there are some high impact moves like short jogs, but it's not hard to follow, unlike some (not all) of the ""Firm"" videos which I can't even get my heart rate up due to getting lost in the steps (what the heck is a sashe? cha cha cha? I may be southern, but I'm not a former debutante and I didn't take dance classes).  So if you are looking for a nononsense, just burn some fat type of workout, this is the one.

Every mile is a little different so it is not boring. They filmed outside with participants at various levels.  Bob has folks do modified versions which gives you options.  The cool down is excellent and I learned to hold my ear for balance during the place your leg on your thigh stretch. I really worked.

User options include instructions with music or music alone.

Bob encourages the walk at home audience and does not let you give up.  He is just as warm and supportive as on the TV show. I will be ordering other walking videos with the Biggest Loser theme. I highly recommend the Biggest Loser Powserwalk workout.",1317686400,2,886,4.365853658536586

I did all four and the cool-down.  The walks were actually challenging and I enjoyed them.  Each of the four workouts is about 16 minutes.

Here's the breakdown.

Walk one:  Bob Harper leads.  Walk is brisk and fast paced.  There are the usual variations like side to side and kicks. (All four walks have arm movements.) Mr. Harper also uses intervals, alternating slower and faster speeds.

Walk two: Sione Fa leads.  Walk is moderately paced and two light weights are used.

Walk three:  Bob Harper leads.  This is the only walk that uses high impact aerobics.  If you have knee/foot issues, instead of jogging or doing jumping jacks, you can just walk or go side to side.  This is fairly intense.

Walk four: Tara Costa leads.  Walk is moderately paced and a small, light weight medicine ball is used.  Two of the ladies demonstrate the exercises without the ball.",1316995200,7,1048,4.786516853932584

Unlike the other reviewer, I like it and my heart rate was elevated quicker and longer than with the Leslie Sansone Weight Loss (Power Walk) DVD. I love the fact that I don't have to look at people with perfect ripped bodies. I also like the fact that everyone isn't perfect in all the moves. Bob actually instructs them right on the video and encourages them throughout the walk. The miles lead by former biggest loser participants weren't as polished but I didn't sweat any less. Some reviewers were annoyed by the talk. I saw them as trying to encourage and keep you engaged. You will have to decide for yourself what works for you. The video allows you to turn off the instructors and just keep the music. So, if the bantering bothers you, you don't have to listen to it. I hope they create another Power Walk DVD.

This has definitely added some variation.  I have only done workout 3 and I was drenched after the 16 minutes. Bob does lots of knee lifts, lots of jogging in place, mixed with jumping jacks. If you like in home walking give this a try, it is not just for beginners.  It is a straight forward cardio workout without complex moves, it serves its purpose in 16 minutes. I look foward to the trying all 4 of the workouts, one includes weights.

4251430,3,B0042JGGEO,"I bought this DVD in order to have some variety from the Leslie Sansome videos- she's great, but after a while, she bores.  I liked that the video has four separate 1 mile workouts, but I don't like that the people walking seem to get confused by the instructions.  Further,  the 2 former contestants (I guess that's who they are- I don't watch the show) who lead the 2nd workout also came across to me as semi-clueless.  They appear to be students who have taken a number of classes, so they're just repeating the things they've heard their instructors say. To me, there is a real difference in the quality of instruction between the trainer (Bob, I guess is name is?)and the two contestants.  On the plus side, I did enjoy the different upper body boxing-derived moves, and the sprints at the end of the miles were an interesting surprise (I hope my downstairs neighbor had already left for work before I started my ""sprint in place"").  I will continue to use the DVD for variety, but will probably look to use Leslie's walks most days of the week.",1303776000,40,1050,4.529100529100529

4251432,5,B0042JGGEO,"I purchased this DVD for days I wasn't able to walk outside. I've decided I get a better more intense workout inside with this than just walking outside. When I walk alone I tend to slow down. I always have good intentions but I generally listen to books on tape as I walk and I don't keep my speed up. Thought I was doing good until I ""walked"" this DVD. My heart rate was up faster with the workout than with my walking outside. Also since I walked faster I was able to walk the same distance in a shorter time. So now instead of setting aside 45min. I can do my workout in 30min. I really like the feature that lets you combine the 4 workouts in the combination you want. Mile 1 is a great start up for any one that hasn't done much exercise. It eases you into it. Mile 3 is a pretty good workout. I'm sure all of these are easy for the real athletes out there but they are perfect for the less athletic of us. And since it only take 16 min. to do a mile - you can push yourself when you are just starting to stay with it. Bob's demeanor is spot on. Not a bunch of corny jokes that you get tired of the third time you hear it. Just calm instruction. There is also a music only feature if you have the routine memorized and don't need the directions. I was going to buy a treadmill but I am so happy with this I am wondering if I really need to go through the expense and loss of space when I get a good workout and all it cost is the price of a DVD and no ugly equipment in my living room.",1303171200,8,1491,3.9078947368421053

You do more than just walking in place (its an indoor walk), you use arms and sprint in place and kick ( forward and back) and really use more body parts than just walking on the treadmill ( and its more enjoyable. I am limited with exercising due to a herniated disc in my back and bad knees. I was able to do this and I do feel great aftewards. Hot and sweaty but fell like I have had a decent work out. It also dosent take that long maybe 25 min with warm up and cool down. They even show you less intense moves if you cant do the full ones.

Pros:  Some different moves, the use of the medicine ball, intensity variations (Hi-lo)
I love the outdoor set, the blue sky and those folks outside in warm weather actually boosts my spirit...cause it is cold/cloudy days in Michigan. I

Cons: music boring...sometimes I have to ignore, because I go by beat...this music don't have a beat.
I think Bob forgets there is a camera, cause he doesnt know how to prepare us for upcoming moves. Not a biggee...cause after you do this a coupla times, you know the spiel and get with the groove.
Cool-down, there really is not a time after the 4th mile to get your heart rate down...you would have to remember to keep walking at a slow pace when the 4th mile goes to the cool-down. The two instructors are standing still. At the end of the 4th mile...they have you end doing a sprint run, which is fast paced...your heart rate is soaring....end of 4th mile...they do not tell you, you are going into cool down.

4251438,4,B0042JGGEO,"Of all the new fitness DVDs released in the last while, I was probably least enthused about this one - however I ended up with two copies of it come Christmas. Over the past week, while nursing a couple of light injuries, I've spent a bit more time with this DVD than I had to date.

Generally speaking, I already had a positive opinion of the DVD before I walked through everything again this week. It contains four sixteen-minute mile walks, two led by Bob Harper, two led by fan fave past competitors Sione and Tara. Realistically speaking, only the first workout is a proper walk - Bob basically takes you through all manners of shuffling forwards, backwards, and side-to-side, with a bit of body movement through kicks and arm rotations. The second mile focuses on upper body sculpting with light weights (I recommend no heavier than 5 lbs) and similar foot movements to level 1. The third mile is again led by Bob and kicks it up a notch - it's a power jog, and great cardio. The final level uses a medicine ball (feel free to grab a 5 lb weight in its place) and is lighter on cardio than level 3, but higher than the earlier levels.

The thing I like about this DVD isn't so much that I expect my body to be really changed by these workouts, but that they make great alternatives to kicking your butt on a daily basis. I like to combine a walk with a shorter 10-20 minute segment from another one of my workout DVDs.

I also like how focused the workouts are - Bob has a bad tendency to take you away from what you expect a workout to be like, and he also loves to make you hold positions. Neither one of those are an option here as you're constantly in motion. It was refreshing to do Mile 3 and just do straight up cardio for sixteen minutes - no stopping for push-ups or some other strength-focused move.

The downsides? As mentioned, this is definitely not the workout that will change your life. It's a great introduction to fitness, and the Biggest Loser 'style', if you're new to working out, and it's a fantastic companion to other DVDs. It's also a good choice when you're nursing some injuries (as I was) and want to take things a little easier but keep on exercising.

Another con - the cast. Tara and Sione seem a lot more comfortable (but still a lil' awkward) in front of the camera compared to their last instructive go-round on '30-Day Jump Start', but their presence makes the rest of the cast pretty insignificant. With the exception of Sunshine, I don't know a single other cast member's name (I don't watch the show), and I still maintain that the early days of the workout dvds are amongst the most fun because of the level of interactivity between the trainers and the contestants. Overall I'm surprisingly pleased with this DVD. The walks are surprisingly cardio-packed (particularly Mile 3) and relatively intensive as a good partner for sculpting workouts.",1300579200,,2889,4.526819923371647

Variety (for a walking workout) - 4 different miles. Lots of moves, some with weights.
Modifications are shown for low and high impact.  You can bring this workout up to a solid intermediate pace.
The cool down is chaptered separately.

The bad:
The set is really dull.  I was looking forward to an outdoor walk, but this is just a crummy lawn with clumps of dirt all over.
The music is really bad.  I like that there is a music only option, I just wished I wanted to hear it.  I will use my iPod.
My pet peeve - I hate when intructors walk around instead of doing the workout (Bob) - it's just walking - not rocket science.",1299456000,4,634,4.206611570247934

4251442,5,B0042JGGEO,"Sure.  If you are a frequent runner or workout daily already, this may not be the workout system for you.  But if you are (were) like me and need a low impact workout because of a knee injury and obesity, then this is the PERFECT way to get started.  My husband (who is also overweight) & I do this everyday and every night and we have seen AMAZING results!  You cannot cheat yourself by doing it half way.  You must do the exercises properly and be committed to a better you, and you WILL see results.  It shows you how to do the workout in a modified form as well as ""full out"".  After doing this CONSISTENTLY for 4-5 weeks, I have been able to do a fast run in place for the first time in 10 years. Bob Harper is GREAT & he makes the workout tons of fun.  They also selected great music for the workout so it doesnt get boring. I am thrilled with my results and my co-workers are noticing my progress.  I have lost 25lbs & 2 dress sizes since Jan 3rd & I have no intentions of looking back.  Do yourself a favor & get with the program.

P.S.  Get yourself some hand weights, because you will need them for the second exercise.  I will also say, that I get kinda frustrated with Quiones, the guy who leads the second exercise because he is not good at telling you to transition to the next exercise before its time to actually transition. This is not really a huge deal, because I pretty much know the routine by heart now.",1298332800,45,1425,4.156934306569343
4251443,5,B0042JGGEO,"Just finished this workout, I have purchased many dvd's but have to say, this is my favorite!! Loved it! I'm 47 and have bad knees so most dvd's are hard on them, not this one, it does the workouts in miles, nothing hard to follow just a great pace keeps you heartrate up and you can work out at your own pace. I would recomend this to anyone who can walk, get started, it's a wonderful way to get healthy! Loved it!",1297987200,4,416,4.085365853658536

He puts many other things into his walking dvd so that you don't get bored. The one mile went by so quickly and I did work up a sweat. I am 64 years old and out of shape and have lbs. to lose, but I know if I stick with this I'm going to lose the weight. I am going to buy other Biggest Loser dvd's. I hope that Bob will make other walking dvd's. I certainly like his way of working with people.",1297900800,6,547,3.765217391304348

The entire BL line are great workout videos that actually go slow enough so that a person starting out can get it. They have alterations for some steps (the hard ones), and they make it fun. Sione is a hoot on this video, he's funny!

Check it out...",1296691200,,346,3.8732394366197185
4251448,4,B0042JGGEO,This DVD is excellent.  But Bob only leads 2 of the walks.  Walk one and walk three are done by Bob. Walk three is awesome.  Walk two features hand weights and is boring.  Walk four features a medicine ball and its a sleeper.  I would have given this 5 stars but it needs more Bob!,1296604800,2,281,4.036363636363636

4251450,5,B0042JGGEO,"This DVD 4 different workouts, from simple to more challenging.  I liked the way the exercises were paced and the leaders' instructions were quite easy to understand and follow.  It is one of my more favorite exercise workouts, and I really recommend it.",1296172800,,254,4.883720930232558
4251451,5,B0042JGGEO,"I have several of the Biggest Loser DVDs, but like this one the best.  The first mile is a little slow but I amped up the pace myself by just walking faster.  The other miles have some nice interval training and use weights or a weighted medicine ball.  I was sweating by the end and felt like I had done a very good workout.  If you have any knee trouble some of the miles may be hard for you.  There is some jogging and speed running in place.  Each mile had someone doing a modification to the exercise so you can follow them if you need to.  The instructors are pleasant and easy to listen to their voices.  It is shot outside so the workout makes you feel like you are outside also.  The stretch at the end was a little short for my tastes, but I just threw in a yoga dvd and I was good. For those new or back into exercise prepare for a challenge.  For those like me who want some variety and a little blood pumping workout this is a great one.",1295481600,2,950,4.032085561497326
4251452,5,B0042JGGEO,"I was very pleased w/ this DVD.  I am just getting started w/ working out again and wanted something low impact because of a bad knee.  This is great!  I thought it may be too easy but I was sweating.  It's all in how much you wanna give. If you are just lightly walking then yes, it's going to be super easy but you if you are high step marching... it'll be a little harder.

I'm a huge fan of Bob Harper.  He is so motivational!  Everytime I wanted to quit during the DVD, he'd pull me right back in.  Great DVD to get started with.",1295308800,3,534,3.9716981132075473
4251453,4,B0042JGGEO,"I have not worked out in a little over 3 months and knew I couldn't jump into where I was before.  The video contains 4 one mile walks and a cool down.  I decided to do the 1st and 3rd walk and the cool down.  It did get my heart rate up and my legs started itching (that tells me they are not used to being moved).  They do provided a plan if you want to work up to a marathon.  If you are new to working out or getting back into it after a hiatus I would recommend it.  The only con is you can't choose more than one walk at the main menu.  You have to choose one, complete it, and then go back to the main menu to select another walk or the cool down.",1295222400,2,654,3.6956521739130435
4251454,4,B0042JGGEO,"I have tried other walking videos and they tend to be boring. I think the pace of this video, the cast/trainer and the setting keeps it moving at an easy pace. Yes an easy pace even though there are ""cardio bursts"" the workout requires little exertion. I use it on my ""rest"" days as a simple workout.

If you are just starting to exercise or you need a low impact workout then I recommend this video. If you want it for a serious cardio burn look to one of the other Bob/Biggest Loser videos. The different levels give it variety and they offer modified moves throughout.

The only draw back for me is that I downloaded it which apparently does not give you options for which level you want. If I hadn't done all four mile segments in a row I wouldn't have known there was a cool down at the end.",1294963200,8,796,4.230263157894737
4251455,5,B0042JGGEO,"Due to bad knees and hip plus living in New England I love this dvd. My heart rate was up and I had a good sweat going on and I only started the first mile. One customer stated that she thought it was boring and no one was smiling, honestly who smiles when they work out and bored far from it. I also love the yoga and 30 day Jump Start. Keep them coming Bob!!!!!",1294444800,8,363,3.8533333333333335
4251456,5,B0042JGGEO,This is my favorite go to exercise DVD currently.  I do this one at least 3 times a week.  Great for intermediate exercisers!,1294185600,4,125,4.391304347826087
4251457,5,B0042JGGEO,"Wow! This sure turned out to be a good buy. I hate cardio and have to force myself to squeeze in 20 minute workouts throughout the week, so for me the four 16-minute miles are perfect. For reference, I own, or have owned, walking workouts by Leslie Sansone, George Foreman (with Petra Kolber), Debbie Rocker, Madeleine Lewis, Kathy Smith, Chris Freytag, and Tamilee Webb. I'm too uncoordinated for dance-style aerobics, so I have a LOT of walking DVDs and this is by far the best one yet.

Bob leads workouts #1 and #3 and they are both great routines. I didn't think I'd get much use of workout #1 but it's really not as easy as one would presume. It's easy in terms of moves but it has a fairly brisk pace and Bob constantly pushes you so it's no walk in the park. Workout #3 ups the intensity with high energy and higher impact moves (low impact modifications are shown throughout the DVD). I love workout #3. It's 16 minutes well spent. No equipment is needed for either of Bob's workouts.

Sione leads the second workout and it's one of the better rounded strength walking routines that I've done. He hits a lot of upper body that, at least in the walking DVDs I own, often get missed. A set of light hand weights (I used 4 lbs.) is needed for this workout.

My least favorite workout is #4, the one led by Tara. She is very personable and pleasant but she has trouble keeping the beat while talking, and her cuing is hit and miss. Luckily, since it's a walking workout, the poor cuing does not ruin it and it's easy to get back on beat. That said, I doubt I'll do this one often. This workout requires a medicine ball which I substituted with one 5 lb. hand weight.

This DVD will be in high rotation in my workout regimen. I love it! For those of you who, like me, can't do dance aerobics with complicated steps, this DVD is a must have for your video fitness collection. Pure gold. Thank you Bob Harper and the Biggest Loser crew!",1294012800,17,1938,4.345303867403315
4251458,3,B0042JGGEO,"I would say this is a beginner/intermediate workout, but it is a good, fun workout.  The first section is very slow moving and didn't get my heart rate up.  Section 2 was a harder workout with weights along with the cardio/walking portion.  Section 3 was pretty intense and got my heart rate up, but only after I made the walk/jog portion more intense buy doing butt kicks/high knees instead of the jogging.  Section 4 uses a medicine ball; I like the fact that they use the medicine ball, but again, it is slow moving.  There was no part of this workout that I dreaded, it was fun and pretty easy.  I would do it on a day where I wanted a light workout.",1293753600,4,654,4.276422764227642

What I like about it: (1)the people in the video are ""real"" looking, and you can see that some of them are struggling too during some of the exercises (2)four different workouts ranging from beginner to advanced with modifications for people who need it (3)each workout is only 16 minutes so it's great if you don't have a lot of time or if you want to use one of the workouts as a warmup for weightlifting or yoga. Plus you can combine the workouts if you want more walking time (4)Not boring at all. A variety of moves is used from walking to sidestepping and jumping jacks (5)No complicated moves so it's easy to follow along (6)Works the core muscles in every workout (7) Instructors are very supportive and encouraging, plus the 1/4 miles are counted for you",1293753600,5,809,4.510204081632653

Other than that, I thought it was a good workout, especially if you need to get yourself started in exercising.  But,don't be fooled that it's just ""walking""; the 3rd and 4th walk will challenge you and that's the whole point.  I did all four walks at once and it was a really good workout (you will sweat!!).
