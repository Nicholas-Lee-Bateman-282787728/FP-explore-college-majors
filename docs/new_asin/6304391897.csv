7869307,5,6304391897,"Kenji Mizoguchi was a remarkable movie director with a favorite theme: the condition/status of women in the Japanese society (ancient or modern).
This particular movie was made during discussions in the Japanese Diet in 1956 about the Prostitution Act. It eminently illustrates the working conditions of geishas in a pleasure quarter. Its general background was the dire economic situation in Japan (`Soon we will be happy to have been stayed alive').

Behind the facade of a house of pleasure, one discovers only problems of poverty, hunger, unemployment, illness in a family, and especially debts, first of all family debts, but foremost, debts to the 'masters', the brothel owners. The majority of the geishas are literally (financially) blocked in their pleasure house. There are also the cynics (a role played remarkably by Machiko Kyo), who want to avenge their fate suffered under `their' former men (a father or others).
The new prostitution law, which included debt cancellation for the geishas, didn't pass the first vote in the Parliament, but was adopted the following year, thanks mainly to the impact of the movie!

The image of `men' in this movie is absolutely disgraceful. They are stupid, vicious, liars, thieves, cowards, two-faced bastards, with at the top the pimps and their big mouths, who see themselves as the saviors of the world, offering girls the opportunity to sell their bodies in order to permit them not to die from hunger or to save their families.

With a final shot that takes you by the throat, Kenji Mizoguchi made an unforgettable masterpiece, with as its ultimate goal `human dignity'.",1369699200,,1625,5.124528301886793
7869308,4,6304391897,"Street of Shame was Kenji Mizoguchi's last film before his death at age 58. In this film he returns to his study of the effects of Japanese society on women. Once again he takes up the cause of the downtrodden prostitutes plying their trade this time in the Dreamland brothel in the Yoshiwara District of Tokyo as the merits of a law outlawing legalized prostitution was being debated.

In this film gone is the rawness of films like Women of the Night (1948), the film has an almost clinical studio feel and Mizoguchi almost approaches his subject as documentary. The film tells the stories of five women.  As the Diet considers a ban on prostitution, the women's daily dramas play out. Each has dreams and motivations. Hanae is married, her husband unemployed and suffering from tuburculosis and she works to support him and their young son.  Yumeko, a widow, uses her earnings to raise and support her son, who's now old enough to work and care for her. The aging Yorie has a man who wants to marry her. Yasumi saves money diligently to pay her debt and get out of the business. Mickey seems the most devil-may-care, until her father comes from Kobe to bring her news of her family and ask her to come home.

Mizoguchi does not moralize here. He presents an example of what the daily life of these women is like. In the end there can be no question that the life they live is exploitative but it may be the only type of life that they can manage. Mizoguchi also sees the cultural state of prostitution in Japan as cyclical. The law may eventually chane but the facts of life will remain the same.",1352332800,,1599,4.503448275862069
7869309,5,6304391897,"As I have written elsewhere (see my review of ""A Geisha""), Mizoguchi championed women's rights long before the movement took hold in Japan. This 1956 film weaves together stories of five women driven by economic hardship to become prostitutes at Dreamland in the Yoshiwara district of Tokyo. At the time, the status of prostitution in postwar Japan was controversial, with the American occupation authorities and Japanese reformers pressuring for a ban on legal prostitution (baishun kinshi).

Yumeko is a widow who has left her son with his grandparents in the country while she struggles to support him. Hanae, the mother of a new baby, has turned to prostitution to support her family after her husband, ill with tuberculosis, lost his job. The two of them had considered suicide but are now committed to raising their son.

Yasumi is a manipulative tease who leverages her considerable sexual appeal to extract extravagant sums of money from her clients. She then lends money to her fellow prostitutes at usurious rates. Yasumi is being wooed by a hapless clerk who wants her to marry him.

Mickey, played by Machiko Kyo, an actress of limitless talent and versatility, is a streetwise tramp from Kobe, formerly a GI's girl, whose popularity with clients isn't sufficient to keep her debts from mounting. A tense moment comes when Mickey violates the prostitute's code by stealing another woman's client.

Yorie dreams about married life and has gathered a trousseau. When she is told that the government has declared prostitutes' debts void, she packs her household goods and leaves to meet her fiance.

When Yumeko's son comes to visit her at Dreamland she is afraid to face him and asks one of the other women to send him away. Repulsed by the environment in which his mother works, he is shown fleeing in embarrassment. Later, when she goes to the country to visit him, she learns that he has left for Tokyo a month earlier to work in a toy factory without telling her.

Debate continues in the Japanese Diet and the media. The Dreamland boss calls his girls together and tells them that the night world they inhabit provides employment (read: survival) for women who would otherwise be destitute. ""We are like social workers,"" he tells them.

These stories all have sordid ends. Yorie returns to Dreamland in tears, exhausted and disillusioned by married life. Her husband had demanded that she work long hours to help him in his business, in addition to housekeeping.

Yumeko connects with her son only to be rebuffed. He scolds her for phoning his boss, and ultimately pushes her away and disowns her. There is a compelling shot of him running away outside the factory with the receding telephone and electrical wires delineating perspective.

Hanae returns to her squalid apartment one night to find her baby crying. Her husband has hanged himself. He is, however, still alive and she cuts him down and berates him for his cowardice and betrayal of her and her baby. In a later scene he arrives at dreamland with the baby on his back and tells Hanae they have been evicted. With a sigh of resignation she says she'll try to borrow rent money from the madam.

Mickey is told she has a visitor and is shocked to confront her father. He has journeyed to Tokyo to take Mikie back home. Her mother, he tells her, has died. Her younger sister's marriage prospects and his own business interests are being damaged by the stain on the family reputation caused by Mickey's sordid life.

She refuses, reminds him of his own infidelities and ill-treatment of her mother. ""You must have visited the Yoshiwara yourself, "" she tells him. Come on in, you can be my customer.""

Only Yasumi has escaped the life. With the money she has gained from her conniving and loan sharking, she has purchased a futon shop, and we see her entertaining her former colleagues from Dreamland. She asks for their business and adds that she still makes loans.

A motion to outlaw prostitution has come up for a vote in the Japanese Diet and been defeated. The ""master"" calls all the women together and calls for a celebration. In the final scenes we meet a new girl from Kyushu who has come to work at Dreamland. As she hungrily attacks her rice bowl, she explains why she is there. The older woman who applies her makeup consoles her: ""some girls do it with jerks and don't get paid.""

So the cycle repeats itself. In a final scene we see the new girl dressed in kimono as she makes her first attempt at soliciting trade. Trembling with fright, she timidly calls out to prospective customers in a weak voice.

This film may have played a role in the eventual outlawing of prostitution in 1956. However, the Yoshiwara district had flourished since the 17th century, and not surprisingly the 1956 law had little effect on the sex trade in Japan. Mizoguchi's film serves to remind us of the sexism, exploitation and injustice that give rise to prostitution throughout history and around the world.",1306281600,,4974,4.8011695906432745
7869310,5,6304391897,"Set in Tokyo's red light district, specifically at the Dreamland brothel, the movie examines the lives of five prostitutes, focusing especially on their virtual enslavement to the prostitution system because they are never able to escape it economically and make it on the ""outside."" One woman attempts it by marrying a poor man, but finds married life to this man even more oppressive than prostitution. Another, a widow, has raised her son with the profits of her trade - only now that he's grown he is embarrassed by his mother and disowns her (she goes insane). It's a social protest movie against an economic (and societal) system that offers limited choices for women to make a living, other than in the world's oldest profession. Director Kenji Mizoguchi's poignant swan song, and he approaches his subject artfully and honestly. An excellent movie.",1139529600,,856,5.078014184397163
