8509133,5,B00736R2FA,Papa loved it! He thought he'd seen all the footage available on Munden but was pleasantly surprised with the 'never before seen' outtakes.,1448409600,,139,5.086956521739131
8509134,3,B00736R2FA,"Not bad, but not up to expectations based upon past TV programs.",1443398400,,64,4.416666666666667
8509135,5,B00736R2FA,"Very talented man, what he says and does is very good.  It took a lot of practice and learning to accomplish what he could do. An excellent amazing man.  Get both of his DVDs you want regret it.",1430352000,,194,4.078947368421052

8509137,5,B00736R2FA,"Wanted to have a video record of the fastest draw who ever lived,...and without a doubt his name is Bob Munden!!!  Especially liked the early '60's home movie recordings of the ""walk & draw"" competitions.  Can even envision that being resurected in the sport of fast draw competition.",1369267200,,284,4.895833333333333
8509138,5,B00736R2FA,Bob Munden was just cool to watch and was probably the last of his breed. I also enjoyed the gunsmith tips. Note: the product description say it was a signed copy but my came unsigned.,1361059200,,184,4.285714285714286
8509139,5,B00736R2FA,"Wow,if I only I could shoot like Bob Munden. I shoot cowboy action but sadly not in his class. This is amazing. Loved his sense of humour and admitting he missed a few shots when the camera was on him. None of this""lets shoot that again"". Outrageous Shooting is well made and shows his skills with all kinds of firearms ,proving the dvd is well named. It will improve my skills,too. It showed also he is a family man and his wife is no slouch with a hand gun fast draw either. This is something different and I will point,no ,not my sixgun ,but my friends in the direction of owning their own copy as well muchas gracias--------Pete R.",1344643200,,635,4.34453781512605
8509140,5,B00736R2FA,"This DVD was awsome. I have never seen such a skillful shootist. Mr. Munden is truely one of a kind. I think Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show would still be going if they had had Bob as one of their acts. You have to see it to believe it, and even then you may still be amazed at what your eyes have witnessed. Two thumbs up and a BIG high-five to the ""Fastest Gun who ever Lived"".  >>------->",1333065600,,390,4.0
