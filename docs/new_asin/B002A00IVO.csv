Put on the English subtitles if you need to. Louis De Fun&egrave;s is an amusing, yet subtle comedian. He makes you laugh because he is so serious and everything seems to go wrong for him. I suggest anything he is a main character in.",1493078400,,397,4.378378378378378
8358768,3,B002A00IVO,"This is a 1960s French comedy in black & white.  If you don't understand French, don't get this film.

My French isn't good enough to get all the jokes.  Some were obvious from the action, but many were word-oriented, and my French vocabulary is just too small.  If your French is excellent, this film is probably excellent.  At least, the native French speakers I talked to all thought so.

The film is about a once-rich family about to have serious financial difficulties, unless a source of money is found.  Mireille Darc (remember the backless dress from The Tall Blonde Man with One Black Shoe?) plays the family daughter.

I wish my French were better.  I'd probably like this film better.",1346371200,,695,4.725
