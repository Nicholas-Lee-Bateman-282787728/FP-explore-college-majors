949991,3,6305013861,The main event was Dude Love vs. Stone Cold and it was great. It made main events what they are today. I recomend this tape for the match ALONE!,1078272000,,144,4.0
949992,3,6305013861,I personally think that over the edge wasn't so good. I didn't really like it not only cause one of my favorite superstars fell but didn't die til he got on his way 2 the hospital. thats one thing people keep messing up. the man didn't die in the ring. but anyways the matches wasn't as i expected. to tell u the truth i was 2 upset 2 see them but i did. and far as i seen the best match that night was triple h vs the rock in a leather strap match but the last match wasn't worth the money. all it was was a repeat of summerslam 98 match between austin and undertaker. but this tape cant be faunt anywhere cause or the tragidee of the late owen hart. u will never find the tape and box. only way u couldn't seen it is if u have ordered it as myself on pay per view that night.  12/12/02,1039564800,,787,3.888198757763975

949996,3,6305013861,"This is a moment of wrestling history.  One of the greatest wrestlers of the modern day died at this event.  I have been watching wrestling for nearly 11 years so hearing of his death was tragic.  I felt like a friend had died.  Yet I wanted this tape.  It's an important tape to have simply because you will not find it, and it holds important footage.  I watched that tape once, and I probably will never watch it again.  It's a moment in modern wrestling history.
As for the matches.  Before the accident they were moderate.  Afterward they were dreaful.  But I understood why.  How good you put on a good show after one of your best friends had died tragically.  I commend the wrestlers for doing what they did.  But the show overall was a disaster.",1022889600,2,753,4.408759124087592
949997,3,6305013861,"This is the show that continues the McMahon/Austin feud, and has a pretty famous main event.  Onward and in no particular order.
L.O.D. 2000 vs. D.O.A. - Mmmm.  Thin Sunny.  Drool.  Bad match.  L.O.D. lost it long ago and D.O.A. never had it. *
Farooq ""injures"" The Rock.  Rock won't be able to compete tonight.  Hah.
TAKA/Bradshaw vs. Kaientai - Taka was over at this point and feuding with former friends Kaientai.  Bradshaw wasn't really doing anything at this point so he joined in.  The story is Kaientai matches blow for blow with Taka but runs every time Bradshaw gets in.  It's pretty funny and makes for a good match when Taka matches up with the very talented Kaientai. ***
Marc Mero makes his wife a bigger star than he was by turning on her.
Vader vs. Kane (Mask vs. Mask) Vader had been unmasked several times and Kane was in the midst of a big run.  You figure it out.  *1/2
IC Title - Rock vs. Farooq - Former NOD leader Farooq challenges up-and-comer Rocky Maivia.  Rock is ordered to come out and defend the title or lose it.  The Nation interferes. **1/2 for the whole storyline.
D-X vs. N.O.D. - Triple H was transitioning from a feud with Owen to a feud with the Rock.  D-X repeatedly made fun of the Nation and this match is pretty good.  Owen ruled the world and everyone else tried to keep up. ***
WWF Title - Austin vs. Dude Love - Dude had sold out to McMahon long ago.  Vince is the ref, Pat Patterson the ring announcer, and Gerald Brisco the timekeeper.  Undertaker is at ringside to counter any shenanigans.  The storyline here is that Dude keeps cheating to gain an advantage because he can't win a fair fight, so McMahon keeps changing the rules of the match.  Brisco and Patterson get theirs and so does McMahon.  ****3/4.  This is a perfect example of ECW-style overbooking creating a great match instead of overshadowing it.
In the End: Solid PPV with a great main event.  Get it for the main event alone and get everything from Wrestlemania 14 to Summerslam 1998 to get an idea of the atmosphere and storytelling of the time.  Recommended.",1017792000,6,2074,4.498659517426273

950010,3,6305013861,"Over The Edge was pretty good but would be nothing without the Main Event. But lets start off with the other matches. Sable defeated her husband ""Marvelous"" Marc Mero in a OK match. The Rock defended his I.C. title against Faarooq in another average contest. The opener between the L.O.D. 2000 and the D.O.A. was very boring as was the Jarret w/ James E. Cornette and Blackman match. The DX vs. Nation Six man was entertaining as was the Handicap match between Kaientai and Taka and Bradshaw. You also saw Vader go at it with Kane which was not the match they had at No Way Out but good none the less in a Mask vs. Mask bout. Then Finally you've got the Title match in which Stone Cold Steve Austin defended against odd #1 contender Dude Love. This match rocked!! and made their Unforgiven match look like a Sunday Night Heat quality match. The odds were stacked against the Rattlesnake with Vince McMahon as the Guest Official and his Stooges (Pat Patterson and Gerald Brisco) as special Time Keepers and Ring Announcers.

Match 6: Rock VS Faarooq: 8 out of  10, because it was good. Match 7: DX VS Nation: 4 out of 10, because it was  very boring.

However; Austin, McMahon, and Foley would have to look over their shoulder, as The Undertaker lurked in the shadows, hungry for the WWF Championship

1.) LOD 2000 w/Sunny and Puke a.k.a. Droz vs DOA (8-Ball and Skull) w/Chainz

The show opens with a slow but decent tag team match from LOD 2000 and DOA. Sunny looked smoking hot....as always! I think her LOD attire is probably her best attire ever. Animal hits a powerslam on 8-Ball to win the match. I never cared for DOA as a tag team and I don't think the fans did either as they never really got a reaction from the crowd

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

The Rock comes out and hits a heel promo on Milwaukee, leading to Faarooq coming out and attacking The Rock and grabs a steel chair. Rock steals it from Farrooq and tries to hit Faarooq with it but he hits the ropes, causing the chair to ricochet in his face. Faarooq drops Rock with a piledriver on the chair and he flees as the Nation comes to Rock's aid and Rock gets stretchered out. We find out later that Commissioner Slaughter announces that The Rock will defend the title against Faarooq later on, or else he'll be stripped of it and awarded to Faarooq

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) Jeff Jarrett w/Tennessee Lee vs Steve Blackman

We follow up with a really great back and forth action match between Blackman and Jarrett. The match ends with Tennessee Lee nailing Blackman with one of his kendo sticks behind the referee's back and Jarrett getting the pinfall victory

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) Marc Mero vs Sable

The background of this story was that Marc Mero told Sable to find an opponent for him to fight at the PPV. If he won, Sable was free from Mero but if Mero won, Sable would have to leave the WWF forever. Sable came to the ring and decided she didn't need a man to fight her battles and that she'd win her freedom herself. Mero suddenly has a change of heart and decides he doesn't want their relationship to end this way, so he lays down to let Sable pin him. Sable pins Mero, but in a slick swerve, he reversed her pin into an inside cradle for the 1, 2, 3. This was a pretty hilarious ending to the match and definitely had Mero earn some pointers in my book. Mero tells Sable to get out of the WWF and sings the goodbye song to her as Sable walks away with her head down. Sable soon after cuts a promo backstage where she thanks the fans for their support and says goodbye. Horrible acting from Sable but a comical segment with Mero in the ring

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) 3 on 2 Handicap Match: Kaientai (Dick Togo, Mens Teioh, and Sho Funaki) w/Yamaguchi-San vs Taka Michinoku and Justin Bradshaw

A decent cruiserweight/light heavyweight match. There was some hilarious mid-match commentary from J.R. and Lawler when Lawler ranted on about Sable and J.R tells Jerry he's a lonely guy and needs couch time. The crowd was silent for most of them is one. Taka gets worked over for most of the match until he gets the tag to Bradshaw who destroys Kaientai. In the end Togo gets the win for Kaientai following a Senton Bomb on Taka.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) WWF Intercontinental Championship Match: Faarooq vs The Rock

The Rock's music plays twice and he never shows. Commissioner Slaughter comes out and orders The Rock to come to the ring as he counts down from 10 to 1. Rock's music hits as Slaughter counts down to 2 and out comes The Rock wearing a neck brace from the piledriver earlier tonight. A rather disappointing match that ends with The Rock rolling up Faarooq with his feet on the ropes to retain the title. This match lasts around 5 minutes and it honestly should've lasted a bit longer, given how the build-up of this feud went. Faarooq gives Rock 2 piledrivers following the match, leading to the Nation coming out and putting a beat down on their former leader. This leads to DX coming down for the save and a pier 6 brawl breaking out between the 2 factions.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) Mask vs Mask: Kane w/Paul Bearer vs Vader

In a rematch from their February No Way Out match, both Kane and Vade put their masks on the line. Fans would either see Kane's severely burned face or Vader's damaged face that had been smushed by Kane at the No Way Out PPV with a wrench. Vader misses a moonsault on Kane and the Big Red Machine capitalizes with a Tombstone Piledriver for the win. Kane takes Vader's mask off and puts it on Paul Bearer and mocks Vader. Michael Cole interviews Vader following the match where Vader weirdly calls himself ""a big fat piece of s***"".

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

There's an in-ring segment where legends Mad Dog Vachon (RIP) and The Crusher honored. Jerry Lawler crashes the honoring ceremony and says it's 1998 not 1948. Lawler rips Vachon's fake leg off and swings it at The Crusher and throws it at him. Lawler comes back for more and Crusher clocks Lawler with the leg. I feel bad but I kind of laughed seeing Jerry swing the leg around at Crusher

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.) 6 Man Tag Team Match: DX (Triple H, Billy Gunn, and Road Dogg) w/X-Pac and Chyna vs The Nation (Owen Hart, Kama, and D'Lo Brown) w/Mark Henry

Amazing 6 man Tag Team match from these 2 teams! I didn't start watching WWF until 1999 but the DX vs Nation feud is one of my favorites from the Attitude Era. Lots of back and forth action from both teams that was just amazing. Chaos ensues at the end and while the referee is dealing with outside drama between DX and The Nation, Owen Pedigrees Triple H on the European Championship to get the win

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

8.) WWF Championship Match: Dude Love vs Stone Cold Steve Austin (c)  (Special Referee: Vince McMahon)

Pat Patterson was the guest ring announcer for the match, while Gerald Briscoe served as the guest timekeeper for the match. We got a long opening segment with Patterson giving ridiculously long but funny introductions to Brisco, McMahon, Foley, and Austin. J.R.'s commentary during these introductions was just downright hilarious. Before the match got started, The Undertaker made his grand entrance, who would be keeping watch of the match at ringside to ensure McMahon played a fair referee. This match was just awesome! I feel that the Dude Love vs Stone Cold feud altogether is extremely underrated when it comes to the Attitude Era. To try and screw over Austin more and more, McMahon would throw in out of the blue stipulations such as No DQ and Falls Count Anywhere. The match spills outside of the ring and up the walkway and Undertaker, Brisco, and Patterson follow to watch the action. Dude ends up busting Stone Cold open with an exhaust pipe which adds drama to the storytelling of the match. As the match goes back to the ring, Dude accidentally knocks McMahon out with a steel chair shot, similar to how Austin accidentally knocked McMahon out with a steel chair at their Unforgiven match. Dude KOs Austin with the Mandible Claw and both Patterson and Brisco attempt to count the pin for Dude but Undertaker Chokeslams them both through the ringside announce tables. Austin hits the Stunner on Dude and uses the hand of McMahon to count the 3 pin for the title retain. Undertaker and Austin have a stare down that would set off a chain events for their feud in 1998. Over The Edge 1998 goes off the air with Stone Cold celebrating his victory in all his splendor.

Overall: Over The Edge 1998 was just amazing! 1998 was a really great year for WWF, and the Attitude Era wasn't even at its peak yet! We open with a pretty good tag team match between DOA and LOD, accompanied by the ever eye gazing babe, Sunny. Unfortunately this would be Sunny's last WWF PPV appearance until Wrestlemania 25 as she would be released in early July 1998 due to drama with Sable and a rumor of her being addicted to painkillers. But aside all that, we also saw a solid match from Jeff Jarrett and Steve Blackman, a short but sweet match from Kane and Vader, a great 6 Man Tag match between DX and The Nation and a classic and underrated main event from Steve Austin and Foley! If you haven't already, I highly recommend checking out Austin and Foley's match at Unforgiven as well as this one. They were both off the charts! I'm a bit surprised that Over The Edge didn't do well in buy rates because the PPV was terrific. Perhaps VHS sales did better. But overall, Over The Edge 98 receives a 5/5 stars from me!",1399852800,,9301,5.02925877763329
7880859,2,6305013861,"First of all, I just want to point out that this event is not the event that happened in 1999 but it was the one that happened in 1998. However, since most fans here have wrote separate reviews about both events, I'll do one better & review both events since I have seen them both. It should be noted though that Over The Edge 1999 was never OFFICIALLY released by the WWF due to the tragic accident that occurred that night.

Over The Edge '98- This event was highlighted by the main event in which WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin had the odds against him in ways that have never occurred before as he was prepared for a rematch with Dude Love with the twist being that Vince McMahon will be the guest referee, Pat Patterson will be the ring announcer & Gerald Brisco will be the timekeeper. Also, the feud between the Nation & DX was picking up some steam here as Owen Hart joined the Nation to take out DX while Marc Mero vowed to get rid of Sable.

L.O.D. 2000 vs D.O.A. The beginning of the feud between these two teams along with Droz being added to the group to start the tease of tension between Droz & Hawk. This was just like all of their series of matches during this feud as the match was dull & boring with the only noteworthy moment being Sunny as she was quite the sight at ringside.

Right around here was when the Intercontinental Champion The Rock came out to cut a promo but was attacked by Faarooq that lead to Rock being carried out on a stretcher.

Jeff Jarrett vs Steve Blackman. At least this match was better than the opener as they had a good match here but there was nothing special or memorable here.

Marc Mero vs Sable. The situation here was that Mero agreed to face anyone that Sable had choosen with the stipulation being that if Sable's representative won, then she would be free from Mero while if Mero wins, Sable has to leave the WWF. This was really just a segment that could have been saved for RAW as Mero tricked Sable to get the quick pinfall victory.

Handicap Match: Bradshaw & Taka Michinoku vs Kaientai. A bonus match with the only real buildup being the feud between Taka & Kaientai that went back to not only their Japanese Pro Wrestling days but also their ECW run. A good match as Taka & the three members of Kaientai (one of them being Funaki, Taka's future partner) worked well together with mat wrestling & high-flying while the three ran whenever Bradshaw got involved during the match to the point where Bradshaw overpowered them when he was in the ring.

Intercontinental Champion The Rock vs Faarooq. For all the build up between these two (as for those that don't remember was when The Rock took over as the leader of the Nation), this was not a great match as their styles just didn't mesh well here to the point where the match came off sloppy instead of crisp. This was just continuing the storyline with the Nation & DX as they made an appearance after the match.

Mask vs Mask: Kane vs Vader. The loser of the match would have to unmask, which was sort of pointless since we can see Vader's face but anyways, this was an average match that again was nothing special or memorable but it was better than a lot of the matches that have been on the card before it.

D-Generation X vs The Nation. The representing members for DX during this match were Triple H & New Age Outlaws while the Nation's representatives were Owen Hart, D'Lo Brown & Kama. This was a nice six man tag with everyone getting a chance to shine during the match as again, it continued the Nation/DX feud but at the same time, continued the HHH/Owen feud to the point where Owen got the win by using the pedigree on Triple H onto the tag belt.

WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Dude Love w/Special Referee Vince McMahon, Special Timekeeper Gerald Brisco & Ring Announcer Pat Patterson. Mick Foley stated on his DVD set that this was his favorite match as Dude Love & it's obvious why because this was the best match of the Dude Love character. This was just a wild brawl with the McMahon, Patterson & Brisco changing the rules as the match goes on with moments like Dude's fall off of the railing to the concrete floor, Austin being thrown from one car to another, Dude's leap off the car, Austin being heavily busted open along with Undertaker making a cameo to chokeslam Patterson & Brisco through the announce tables.

Overall, this was a one match show as the most memorable match on this event is the main event but since this match has been released onto two DVD sets, I would just get one of those DVDs (both are Mick Foley's sets) because this event is really forgettable.

Over The Edge '99- This is the second & last Over The Edge event with WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin once again defending his title in a situation where the odds are against him. This time, it's against The Undertaker with Shane McMahon being the special referee. Unfortunately, this was the event where Owen Hart was involved in a tragic accident that ended his life to the point that WWF has never released any footage of this event.

WWF Tag Team Champions Kane & X-Pac vs D'Lo Brown & Mark Henry. Great tag team match along with this being one of Mark Henry's best performances throughout his career (and trust me, there weren't many) along with everyone else working well together as D'Lo/Pac have shown in their series during their feud in 1998 with Kane pulling off some surprise offense as well including doing some high-flying moves at one point.

Hardcore Champion Al Snow vs Hardcore Holly. Their final match in their series as they followed the same pattern as their previous matches with this being a brawl all over the arena using various weapons like a table, trash cans etc... with one moment being both fighting in the lobby, using popcorn & even going into the woman's bathroom.

Unfortunately, this was when the tragedy happened as The Blue Blazer (Owen Hart) was scheduled to face Intercontinental Champion The Godfather but the match never happened as Owen fell from the ceiling. RIP Owen, We Miss You Buddy.

Val Venis & Nicole Bass vs Jeff Jarrett & Debra. For the most part, this was more like Venis vs Jarrett featuring Debra & Bass because they were barely in the match if at all. This match was nothing special as the only highlight here being the aftermath.

Road Dogg vs Billy Gunn. The explosion of the New Age Outlaws but for all the hype, this match was a disappointment. Billy Gunn was a better tag team wrestler than he was a singles while Dogg was just a decent wrestler but their styles didn't mesh well here & I just found the match to be very lackluster for the most part.

Elimination Match: Mankind, Test, Ken Shamrock & Big Show vs Big Bossman, Viscera & Acolytes. For those that don't remember, this was during the Union angle as the former Corporation members teamed up to take on the Corporate Ministry. This was a better match than anyone expected as the eliminations made the match better than what it would have been. It was nothing special but it was watchable for what it was.

The Rock vs Triple H. This is one of their forgotten matches as this match gets overshadowed by their more memorable encounters. The issue here was that Rock had an injured arm going into the match due to Triple H's attack weeks before on RAW. These two have never had a bad match & this was no exception with Triple H being very aggressive here as he focused on Rock's arm with Chyna getting involved from time to time. The ending was kinda of a jip but the aftermath made up for it as they continued to battle with Mankind having a cameo in the end.

WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin vs The Undertaker w/Special Referees Vince & Shane McMahon. Don't let the title fool you as Vince was taken out earlier on Heat & didn't make an appearance until the end. Just like Rock/HHH, this was a forgotten match that gets heavily overshadowed by their more famous encounters. A great match between these two as this was one of their more unique performances as both worked on each other's leg before the wrestling match became a brawl with Shane getting involved including some hilarious moments where he tries to help Taker. With cameos from Pat Patterson, Gerald Brisco & McMahon in the end, this was a great main event that ranks up with their SummerSlam match as their best ""wrestling"" match.

Overall, this event is mostly remembered for the wrong reasons but the highlights of this show were easily forgotten about the best quality matches involving those participants are available elsewhere.",1234915200,,8551,4.52168284789644

Did you like where I put Bradshaw's name? After four little Japanese guys. That's great. Anyways, good match. NO! I said good match and it has Bradshaw in it. Damn! Well, it was good because of the moves that the four little Japanese guys did. Kaientai win. ***1/4

WWF Intercontinental Championship:

The Rock (Champion) V. Faarooq

Horrible Intercontinental Title match. The wrestling was not crisp but sloppy. Stupid ending with The Rock winning out of no where with his legs getting to the ropes after the three count. *3/4

Mask V. Mask Match:

Kane V. Vader

ok...what's the point of this match? You can already see Vader's face with the mask on. I remember this match being alot better than this. Not a very good match at all. Kane wins (DUH!) *1/2

Six Man Tag Team Match:

Triple H, Road Dogg, & Billy Gunn V. Owen Hart, D'Lo Brown, & Kama

Really good tag team match. This match could have been great but it had something missing. The ending was great. Owen hits Triple H with the Pedigree onto one of the Tag belts and wins. Awesome finish. ***1/2

WWF Championship:

Stone Cold Steve Austin (Champion) V. Dude Love

Awesome match. Vince was the guest ref and it had that main event feel. Awesome match with an aweosme finish. Austin retains. ****1/2

Overall, not that good of a show. Austin and Foley had a Match of the Year candidate and that's about it.",1125360000,,2065,4.5162162162162165
7880863,2,6305013861,"Overall this was a decent event, considering what occured here. In this event Owen Hart had an accident where he fell from the ceiling to the ring and sadly died because of that. When this happened it was really sad, and made it just a little hard to watch the rest of the matches. In the video, you do not see Owen fall or see him lying in the ring with the people attending him (which is a little better than having to see someone almost dead in the ring). Owen was scheduled to wrestle The Godfather for the Intercontinental Title after the Al Snow and Hardcore Holly match. The matches continued after his fall and it was announced that Owen Hart died after the good 8-Man tag match. I give a lot of credit to the commentators and the wrestlers that came out to perform after Owen's fall because I am sure they felt really sad. So in the end the wrestlers did put on a good show. I give a thanks to Owen for memories. Here are the matches.

1. X-Pac and Kane vs. D-Lo Brown and Mark Henry with Ivory 8/10

This was a decent opener. This match had a whole lot of good moves coming from all men. It was also kind of funny how X-Pac got beat up here. Nice finish when Kane chokeslams Henry to retain the WWE Tag Team Titles. It wen a little slow but the good moves saved it.

2. Hardcore Holly vs. Al Snow 8/10

This was a good Hardcore Match. It is definetly not better than the matches these two had at WWE St. Valentine's Day Massacre or WWE Backlash 1999. These two faught in the ring, went through the crowd, and to the food stands. It was funny when they started to throw food at each other such as pizza, funnel cakes, coke and other drinks, and sugar. Al Snow wins when he powerbombed Holly through a table to retain the Hardcore title.

3. Jeff Jarrett and Debra vs. Val Venis and Nicole Bass (Mixed Tag Team Match) 7/10

This was not such a good match, especially since it came after Owen's death. This match was pretty short too. It was funny when Jeff started cussing at Nicole and earlier called her a he/she. Val and Nicole get the victory when he did the Money Shot on Jeff.

4. Road Dogg vs. Billy Gunn 7/10

This match was not that good either. It was actually pretty boring. It had a few good moves but it was not that good still. Billy Gunn wins with that finishing move he does.

5. Big Boss Man, Bradshaw, Faarooq, and Viscera vs. Mankind, The Big Show, Ken Shamrock, and Test (Eight Man Survivor Series Elimiation Match) 8/10

This match was pretty good. It was a little rushed but it had good moves in it. What made me mad was that most of the men got either counted-out or DQ. It was funny when the Big Boss Man cussed out Mankind. A good match.

6. Triple H with Chyna vs. The Rock 8/10

This was an okay match. This watch was bad when it is compared to some these two had in the future. This match was pretty rough with both men getting hurt bad, and Triple H bleeds. The ending sucks with The Rock winning by DQ.

7. The Undertaker vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin 9/10

This match good but also dissapointing. It was dissapointing because Steve Austin has a real big disadvantage. This was a real rough match with Shane McMahon, Pat Patterson, and Gerald Brisco all getting knocked out as referees, but the ending sucks so bad. It ends with Shane pushing Vince into Austin and they fall, and then the Undertaker gets on top of Austin with Shane doing a real fast three count. After the match Steve Austin beats up Corperate Ministry members such as Mideon and Big Boss Man and then you see the Undertaker walking out as the new WWE Champion with other Corperate members and Shane while Vince is on his knees by the commentators. Austin his really mad in the ring. A bad ending to a real tradgic night.",1109808000,,3725,4.265248226950354
