8133179,5,B000GJ0L5E,"Fist, our house has a few Rolie Polie Olie fans so we couldn't really go wrong on content of this dvd.  That said, lets go on.  The stories were a good mix, the dvd a good length and was in excellent condition.  I'm not certain if it was the dvd or our player (but I'm leaning towards the dvd as our player doesn't do this on all dvd's) but it seemed to have FastPlay like some Disney Dvds do.  It wasn't advertised on the package or dvd but it was a nice plus to find while watching it.",1334448000,,487,3.938775510204082
