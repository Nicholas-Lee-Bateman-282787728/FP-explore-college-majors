8078650,2,B0000D0YVY,"Well, I'd wager the 5-star review was written by the filmmaker or his family/friends (as is often the case with these types of videos), as this c-horror microbudget video is undeniably, tediously boring. I do have to give them credit, though, in that I couldn't bring myself to give it one star. The reason fro that is that the acting is actually better than I'd expected, certainly better than most no-budget/microbudget vids. For that reason, I thought it fair to give it one star above what my gut told me it might fairly be given.

As far as details, it's shot in SD, which is neither good, nor bad, in my opinion, especially as I'm a huge fan of indie films and many new filmmakers can't afford the fancier cameras. So, I've always thought ""taking points off"" for not shooting in HD is not quite fair. But, the camera work is pretty bad, as if the director was in a rush to just get something recorded without framing his or her shots, or really even taking the time to review what has just been recorded.

That said, this movie has no scares or thrills, and is really just another c-movie you can pass up without missing anything. I did kind of dig the DVD cover art, and though I learned long ago that DVD artwork is usually the high point of most c-horror movies and the primary draw-in for folks looking to rent a film (esp one with no trailer).

In addition, at least as of this writing, the video is only a $2 rental, so you're hardly out much if you're a big fan of indie thriller-horror. But, just fair warning, I could only sit through the whole video due to the fact that I try my best to watch every film all the way through, unless they are ridiculously terrible (like ""The Expedition,"" for example). Having seen it from start to finish, I'd definitely not recommend you spend your time or money on this one, and save it for one of the dozens of good indie horror c-movies out there.",1428364800,4,1900,4.392045454545454
8078651,1,B0000D0YVY,I only managed to watch 10 minutes or so of this movie. Sorry but it was gawd awful!  One star only because zero is not an option. It was so bad I couldn't even believe it. Take a big pass on this one.,1428019200,3,201,3.6744186046511627

8078653,5,B0000D0YVY,"A uniquely dank beach town overrun by greedy mobsters sets the stage for a tale of deception and mayhem as actor/producer Keith Collins lingers this masterpiece back to the old haunting style and wit of Alfred Hitchcock macabre.  Throw in a hint of M. Knight Shyamalan's epic thrillers with a dash of Wes Craven's knack for innovative slasher films like ""Scream,"" and you'll find your attention glued to the screen waiting for the killer's very next move.  ""Gravedigger"" sets itself apart from lackluster plots and cheesy characters that leave the viewer saying, ""you really expect me to believe that?""  Collins is of no disappointment either, giving a stellar performance of the stoic yet enigmatic defense attorney Steve Borden - a man  grappling with a guilty conscience from a prior case that went terribly wrong.  As Borden's personal turmoil transpires, a serial killer known as the ""Gravedigger,"" is stalking and murdering all those he has deemed guilty.  Will burying the guilty burn the gravediggers own guilt? Can Borden bury his own past?  ""Gravedigger"" sends the viewer on a rollercoaster ride of parallel twists and turns unlike any other movie in the suspense realm.  You won't want to miss this!",1427328000,3,1210,5.075757575757576
8078654,4,B0000D0YVY,"When it comes to Kung Fu movies it's usually hit or miss, some are good a lot more are crappy. I stumbled upon this one at a local trader shop. Wu Tang Clan were pushing it as a part of their Soul Assassins collection, so I took a chance and was not displeased. Godfrey Ho (Elton Chong), does an excellent job of mixing comedy and action and adds a few zombies to give it a unique horror flavor, rarely seen in Kung Fu movies. I've been watching it for almost a decade and it just gets better.

8078655,5,B0000D0YVY,"Greetings;

From the review before mine, I have only really this to add. They felt that the whole 'kung-fu fighting zombies' were a bit off. Well, they need to remember that one of the main themes of this movie is that of gravedigger kung-fu. A young man seeks revenge on a group that killed his family and he turns to a master of kung fu for training. It just so happens that his style is that of gravedigger. Practice digging graves, swinging them around and at times indeed, rousing the dead to help you fight. Realistic? No-but that isn't the point, is it?

Good movie overall, not the best picture, but it isn't exactly new either. Dubbed in english. Was more than a little suprused to find that this movie was brought to us thanks to in no small part by, 'the Wu-Tang Clan.' The rappers. Wasn't sure just how good it could possibly be once I got the chance to see that on the cover art, but overall-suppose I should thank them. Decent enough movie. Thank you...",1287705600,,967,4.426966292134831

There is no question the kung fu was great,,,however, I'm not into dead people fighting kung fu,,that kinda killed it for me,,,,,however, the story has a very tight plot, the fight scenes were amazing,,Elton Chong performed brilliantely,,,but training with dead people,,,,I'm not sure about that!!",1149811200,,484,5.54054054054054
