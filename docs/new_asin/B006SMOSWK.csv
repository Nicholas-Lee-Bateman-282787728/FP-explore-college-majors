5015354,5,B006SMOSWK,"a great addition to bee movies.  a little more different, definitely a collectible.  I would buy it all over again if need be.",1372550400,,126,4.434782608695652
5015355,2,B006SMOSWK,"Unless you've seen this on tv before and liked it, I would not recommend this film. It is very slow-paced and has a lot of talking and strategizing by the main characters, but little in the way of action--meaning something actually happening.  There are a few moments of suspense, but that's if you can stay awake during all the blabbing. I recommend instead 'The Deadly Bees' from 1966 which is easy to find and cheap. It is an atmospheric thriller (British) which is suspenseful and fun and much easier to watch than this made for tv movie.",1349481600,2,542,4.587628865979381
5015356,2,B006SMOSWK,I liked the movie. But the video transfer to DVD. Was very bad in the beginning of the movie. But it did play better in the middle and end.,1466899200,,139,3.8275862068965516
5015357,3,B006SMOSWK,I watched this movie my first time with Dr. Norman Gary.  He taught apiculture honeybee behavior and biology at U C Davis.  He played the character of a farmer attacked by killer bees while operating a farm tractor.,1465430400,,215,4.631578947368421
5015358,1,B006SMOSWK,"One star for the transfer. It's so bad even the picture rolls for several minutes in the beeginning. If you don't mind watching a disc that reminds you of the old ancient days of VHS then it ain't so bad. But BEElieve me, I'm never buying another Cheezy Flicks disc. No siree honey. I've been stung once, that's enough. Okay, I'm done. ;)",1462147200,3,338,4.380952380952381
5015359,5,B006SMOSWK,My daughter and I really liked it. It was just like we remembered.,1461283200,,66,4.153846153846154
5015360,1,B006SMOSWK,This is recorded off a VHS tape onto DVD and the VHS tape had bad tracking.  Wish I had read the reviews before I wasted my money.,1460419200,2,130,3.814814814814815
5015361,5,B006SMOSWK,I love this movie,1458604800,,17,3.5
5015362,1,B006SMOSWK,"Awful quality; first 5-10 minutes involved skipping, lines on the screen, etc.",1456099200,,78,5.583333333333333

5015365,4,B006SMOSWK,"THE SAVAGE BEES is another entry in the ""killer bees"" sub-sub-genre. When Sheriff Donald McKew (Ben Johnson- THE SUGARLAND EXPRESS, THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN, THE SWARM, TERROR TRAIN) finds his dog dead, he sets out to prove that it was poisoned. With the help of Coroner, Dr. Jeff DuRand (Michael Parks- THE EVICTORS, KILL BILL 1 and 2), McKew discovers the true, venomous cause of his pet's demise. Enter bee expert, Jeannie Devereaux (Gretchen Corbett- LET'S SCARE JESSICA TO DEATH). Of course, the tiny culprits are found to be the insects of the title. Oh no! This is all taking place in New Orleans, during Mardi Gras! Does this mean that the celebration will have to be cancelled? Nope, the festivities are just too important to risk pooping on everyone's party. So, let the good times roll! What the... ? EEEEYAAAHG! THE SAVAGE BEES, along w/ THE SWARM, THE DEADLY BEES, etc., attempted to cash in on the Africanized, ""killer bees"" scare of the period. As made-for-TV-movies go, it's pretty decent. Having Johnson, Parks, and Corbett in it, helps to lift it above the average fare. Bee sure to watch for the ""farmer-in-the lake-sting-a-thon"" scene! Also watch for James Best (THE KILLER SHREWS, THE BRAIN MACHINE) as a slow-moving politician. Worth checking out...",1434412800,3,1276,4.9672897196261685
5015366,5,B006SMOSWK,"Good storyline, good actors.  Nearly 40 years later, problem is still with us..",1429056000,,79,5.076923076923077
5015367,5,B006SMOSWK,excellent,1425859200,,9,9.0
5015368,5,B006SMOSWK,We were thankful to be able to order this.  My husband had not seen it growing up and I just had to show him! The Quality was good for the price.  Thank you!,1403136000,,157,3.727272727272727
5015369,5,B006SMOSWK,"I saw this movie a few times when they ran it on TV back in the 70's, along with my brothers and sisters. I was probably only about 10-ish. We never forgot about this movie to this day. It was pretty horrifying to kids in it's day. It was awesome to take a trip to the past watching this again for the first time in about 37 years. I still remember exact scenes throughout it. Most of all, I can't believe I even found this on Amazon !",1392595200,,435,3.9545454545454546
5015370,2,B006SMOSWK,"This is a fun movie and I remember watching it a long time ago.

However, the transfer to DVD is really poor.  It is barely watchable for the first several minutes.",1390089600,4,164,4.258064516129032
5015371,5,B006SMOSWK,"I saw this when I was a kid, always remembered the sounds of her walking, crunching the dead bees...ewwww",1387929600,,105,4.578947368421052
5015372,1,B006SMOSWK,"Cheezy Flix is a bootleg operation, and this DVD is absolutely one of their all-time worst in the transfer department.  They usually just take the old VHS release and rip it on to a DVD, and that is what they did here.  But unfortunately, the VHS tape that they had as their master was old and defective and has video-rolls and is unstable and shaky throughout the entire film (some reviews here say it's only the first several minutes, but it's not - it vibrates almost the entire film, just moreso in the early parts.)  The compression is also sub-par so the image is also blurry and fuzzy.  The old original VHS release looked a lot better than what's on this DVD.  It's extremely annoying to watch with all the shakiness and vibration, not to mention the blurry image, and it will surely give you eyestrain.

The movie itself is a silly, fun tv-movie of that era set in New Orleans.  But trust me, no matter how much you want to see the movie again or want to add it to your collection because you saw it as a kid on tv, this DVD is an absolute travesty.  I have some bootlegs and I can accept lower quality, but this DVD is beyond unwatchable.",1385683200,17,1148,4.331775700934579
5015373,1,B006SMOSWK,This is a great movie which has been spoilt by a poor quality transfer from Cheezy Flicks. I have a DVD-R copy of this movie which I bought several years ago which is the same as the Cheezy Flicks print. The movie is highly recommended but not the DVD print.,1382918400,5,258,4.18
5015374,2,B006SMOSWK,"The picture does roll and jump for several minutes but even after it stablizes the quality of the picture is poor, being more blurred than sharp.",1381795200,3,145,4.615384615384615
5015375,3,B006SMOSWK,"It's quite obvious this is a VHS transfer, but I don't have a problem with that either. The problem is that on my copy, the picture jumps quite a few times during the first 4 minutes and 13 seconds of the film. After that tho, everything was fine. That first few minutes is still watchable however, but is every copy like this, or is my copy just defective?? Could someone else let me know if their copy does the same thing, or do I need to exchange mine for another copy. If they are all like this, then I will be fine with mine, because it's not that bad. If it is just my copy, I would rather exchange it for another one. Great film, but can't give it a higher rating because of the transfer.",1381795200,7,695,4.117647058823529
8503753,1,B006SMOSWK,"The video quality is fuzzy.  The video flickers because it looks like it was recorded off of an analog TV with a horizontal control problem.  This is not the professional quality transfer I expected, not even for $9.99.  Probably not even for $1.99.  I definitely do not recommend anyone buy this recorded version.",1527120000,,314,4.867924528301887
8503754,3,B006SMOSWK,I believe this copy was taken straight from a vhs tape. The picture rolls and goes nuts at the first ten minutes. The picture is out of focus and blurry. But hold on it gets better. The picture stops jerking and clears up. The sound is good. I remember this movie I am sure from a tv movie. All in all it is worth the money.,1519948800,,324,3.9242424242424243
8503755,5,B006SMOSWK,"Awesome! I had loved this film as a kid in the 1970's, and love it more now, seeing it again all these years later!",1519257600,,115,3.8333333333333335
8503756,1,B006SMOSWK,AVOID THIS SELLER! The movie is rolling like it was some old film on a t.v. that was transferred to a dvd.  Doesn't work!,1517961600,,121,4.041666666666667
8503757,4,B006SMOSWK,"there were and are so many of these 'b' bee movies, but this one is done well because of the fine acting by fine actors.  this one is worth a half-dozen of the others. even the art-work can be framed.",1513641600,,200,4.0
8503758,1,B006SMOSWK,"Honestly the reviews were bad so I bought a used copy. Not even worth 4 dollars. Awful quality video, like it was badly transferred from a defective video tape. It's going in the trash.",1503273600,,185,4.470588235294118
8503759,5,B006SMOSWK,I never thought I'd find this movie on DVD. I am very happy that I did. I will buy from this seller again.,1501545600,,106,3.652173913043478
8503760,2,B006SMOSWK,Video quality is terrible! You should wait until it release by Blu ray...You don't want to watch it..It might be great movie but quality make you don't like to watch it...Sorry I have to be honesty...,1490918400,,200,4.583333333333333
8503761,1,B006SMOSWK,"DO NOT BUY THIS awful DVD-it rolls, it has ""bad tracking"" and the whole thing is terrible quality, fuzzy, etc.  The previews of other dvd's from Cheezy look the same way.  Wish I have paid attention to other reviewers.",1486944000,,218,4.564102564102564
