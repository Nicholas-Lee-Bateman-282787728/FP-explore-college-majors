5752844,5,B00CYQXBSQ,"After watching Season one on DVD, I started following Season on TV and online - making a pre-order of the DVD set based on those. I just watched Episode 16 - The One Percent Solution, and I think I may have heard Lucy Liu utter my favorite lines of any show, any time. Without watching the show, this seems wildly out of context: ""I don't want to know which cock I'm holding; I just want to know how it got there. (silent pause) Okay, congratulations, you got me to say it.""

Character development continues in Season Two - Sherlock continues his fight for sobriety, and his sponsor decides it is time for Sherlock to become a sponsor; he discovers what a royal pain it is to be a sponsor and learns more about himself in the process. The cases continue to come; the police continue to be unable to solve most of them, at least correctly, and Sherlock or Watson have to step in. But the show is still less about clever plot gimmicks, or Sherlock showing off (although he still does so) and more about the interplay between the characters. I found this to be a thoroughly enjoyable series.",1393545600,15,1088,4.44
5752845,5,B00CYQXBSQ,"This is really an exceptional TV show. You have to accept the premise that here we have Sherlock Holmes in present day New York, accompanied by Dr. (Joan ) Watson , solving mysteries for the NYPD.
The writing is really great and Johnny Lee Miller is outstanding in the role of Sherlock. There's Moriarty and Mrs. Hudson and all of the elements of the Classic story, updated sometimes to an hilarious degree.
Very creative, and you won't be sorry you got it.",1392940800,33,457,4.585365853658536

5752865,5,B00CYQXBSQ,"Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu are great in this! I am a longtime Holmes fan. I read all of Arthur Conan Doyle's works when I was a kid and I've reread them several times since. I love Benedict Cumberbatch's rendition of a modern day Holmes and Martin Freeman's modern day Watson in BBC's Sherlock series. But I had never given Elementary a chance because I didn't think that a modern-day Holmes could be done any better than what the BBC Sherlock series has done. But I found that you really can't compare the two. They are both excellent! Jonny Lee Miller's version of Holmes is smart, sexy and funny. He doesn't find sex abhorrent and he has had his heart broken by a woman. Unheard of! Benedict cumberbatch's character almost went there with Irene Adler but not quite to this level of heartbreak marked by a descent into drug abuse. Jonny Lee Miller gives a pleasingly quirky and briIliant take. It's a much different take than what we're used to - the traditionally very cerebal and logical Holmes character who keeps regular people at bay. Miller's portrayal manages to balance all of that with showing Holmes' vulnerability at pivotal points. Lucy Liu is brilliant and beautiful as Watson. She emerged from being just Holmes's protege and sober companion in season 1 to being a great deductionist in her own right! I love it. And if you watch the series carefully ( this season and the ones after) you can see Asian and Amerasian actors appearing in greater numbers than I've ever seen them before in a series and I have to think that this has to be due to her influence. Bravo!",1507680000,,1584,4.6007067137809186

5752939,5,B00CYQXBSQ,"I have all 4 seasons currently available.  Each season has its own theme, while incrementally building the relationship between Holmes & Watson. The writing is great.  A unorthodox narrative of the Holmes story based in current society.  (Holmes isn't always likable - but the show is).  Season 2 is full of surprises woven around murders.  Not all outcomes include a traditional ""confession of the crime & locking up the bad guy"".  Life lessons abound.  Holmes is maturing, but oh so slowly....  I highly recommend this season if you are tired of the typical cop show...",1479081600,,571,4.936842105263158

5753016,1,B00CYQXBSQ,"Along with the BBC series ""Sherlock,"" this show is an excellent updating of the truly epic, worldwide famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. However, to update the character, the producer(s) mistakenly thought that making Sherlock a sex addict  would be a good idea. It was not. This is why I and others have given up on the series. If I learn, though, that in season 3 or 4 the sexual nature of the program has been rejected, we will began watching this series once more.",1462233600,,477,4.678571428571429

So this reason alone got me to watch this adaptation of Holmes, ( and the BBC version ) but it captivated my wife and our daughter as well. Unlike so many shows on television these days, it is a show that doesn't pander to overly lurid images or foul language to gain audience ratings. This show has substance of plot, well flowing scripts and none of the ludicrous love triangles that every show nowadays seems to have. I hope this helps.",1452124800,2,539,4.454545454545454

5753062,4,B00CYQXBSQ,"I must also admit that although I grew up reading and enjoying all the Sherlock Holmes stories, I am usually disappointed by their TV and film adaptations. This series has been an exceptional stand out, and I highly recommend it for any Holmes fan. I picked up the DVD sets of Seasons One and Two.

I do suggest you start with Season One before watching Season Two, so you can appreciate the progress of characters, relationships and sub-plots. Season One establishes the relationship between Holmes and Watson, how they come together, and the season ends with episodes involving Dr. Moriarty. Season Two explores their partnership and living compatibility, has an episode filmed in London to show Holmes' back story, and brings in Inspector Lestrade and much more with Holmes' brother Mycroft. I enjoy seeing how characters and plots from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original stories are being worked into the series.

The modern treatment of Holmes and Watson - placing them in NYC, making Watson a female, showing Holmes as a recovering addict, having them work with the NYPD, etc. - is both creative and fresh while still being respectful of the original material. The essence of the characters and their relationships remains true but there's far more depth and background now. It also makes Holmes more believable in a modern day setting. I would imagine it difficult to come up with new story-lines each week for Holmes but there are no bad episodes in either season (I have yet to see season three, though it gets great reviews from fans).

I think all the actors have been very well chosen for their roles and they complement each other very well. Holmes' character has so many quirky expressions and mannerisms that it's impossible to take your eyes off him. Essentially, each episode plays out like a crime drama but there's far more importance on the character development here, compared to other TV crime dramas. Also, in comparison to ANY other TV show I've EVER seen, Holmes (especially) has very long scenes of dialogue to deliver... it must be an especially demanding role simply for the memorization of lines, and I think Johnny Lee Miller (and Lucy Lui) deserve awards for this!

Now that I've praised the show, I should explain why I've deducted one star from the season two DVD package. First, as others have mentioned, there are often times when Holmes dialogue is hard to hear. These are usually quiet scenes where he is conversing with Watson and while we can clearly hear her, his voice is a very quiet mumble/whisper. I don't believe this to be a problem with the DVD but a problem with how the show was filmed. I happens in several episodes and I do hope they correct this on future releases. Second, the menu on the last DVD in the set is finicky and does not always take me to the chosen episode. The other discs work fine. Thirdly, compared to DVD's of other TV series, this show is much more expensive, so wait for it to go on sale.",1449360000,2,2960,4.73062015503876

5753107,5,B00CYQXBSQ,"Elementary - Season 2 - [0611 - August 3, 2015]

Content:
The DVD package for Season 2 consists of 24 episodes on six disks. There are some extra features that detail series background and production issues. The episodes were shown on the CBS network September 26, 2013 to May 15, 2014.

Summary:
These comments are primarily for Season 2 and it is assumed you have seen Season 1 already.

Honestly I was at first skeptical about another take on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's sleuths Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson. This iteration features the analytical Holmes as manic ex-drug addict abet a certified genius. Dr. Watson is an oriental lady that turned away from her medical career as a surgeon to be a companion for recovering addicts.

I am of the opinion based upon my viewing experiences that many a successful TV series tends to coast during the second season. The entire cast knows two things: season 1 was a success and they have a job for the next year. Sometimes the writer's get into a rut - what worked before should work again. The creative brains are reluctant to up-end the chemistry among principal cast members or introduce new talents. These issues do not happen with every series but I have seen many where Season 2 is a pale imitation to Season 1 - ""The Blacklist"" is a recent case in point.

In my opinion ""Elementary"" Season 2 is even better that Season 1! I list some of my reasons below.

Positive Comments:
 The Watson and Sherlock relationship has evolved in a positive creative sense of that word during season 2. Watson has become a consultant to the NY Police and is being tutored by Holmes. Their relationship is still, thankfully, non-sexual but considerable emotional fireworks enliven the dramas.
 The introduction of Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock's estranged brother, and the bumbling Inspector Lestrade, formerly of Scotland Yard were excellent addition to the show. A risky move bringing back archenemy Moriarty for one episode turned out very entertaining and revealing of Holmes's depth of feelings for her.
 One of the guilty pleasures of watching these shows is the nuanced relationship of Holmes and Watson. Holmes is manic and impulsive - prone to jumping to conclusions - mostly correct when involved solving a crime. Watson presents an inscrutable face when Holmes goes off - counseling restrain or at least grudging cooperation.
The Cast:
 The ultimate success of this show revolves around the cast. Two relative unknowns Jonny Lee Miller (Holmes) and Lucy Liu (Watson) are convincing and entertaining in difficult and challenging roles.
 The two NYPD detectives that work with Holmes are well above average in a supporting role. Played by Jon Hill (Detective Marcus Bell) and Aidan Quinn (Detective Tommy Gregson) they push back when Holmes goes off on a manic tangent but respect his superior intuitive crime solving abilities.

Negative Comments:
 OK Sherlock talks fast but is it me or does he whisper and mumble a lot? I find myself looking at my wife asking what did he say? The other characters I can hear and understand clearly. Not a big deal but it irked me.

My Opinion:
If you enjoyed season 1 you will be, I believe, pleased and very entertained with season 2. The main characters and more nuanced and the introduction of characters from the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes body of works added to the viewing pleasure of this remarkable series.",1438560000,,3404,4.897391304347826

5753121,4,B00CYQXBSQ,"This show is losing its way a bit after the intriguing and fascinating first season. Holmes seems less and less insightful (and Miller's mannerisms more distracting). Liu remains compelling, but Quinn is seriously underused, and the recurring characters (Moriarity, Mycroft, Lestrade) are poorly worked through; their character shifts seem capricious and often nonsensical. Of course, this is a completely different project from the BBC's Sherlock; they have to come up with 20+ episodes a year, instead of only 3, but still Cumberbatch et al are clear winners.",1436140800,2,561,5.459770114942529

5753216,5,B00CYQXBSQ,"Season two of Elementary is as good as season one (and season three, for that matter, but that's not yet completed on the air yet).  The same comment I made to season one applies, to wit:

""Elementary"" may be the best crime drama currently being presented on network television.  I have greatly enjoyed every single episode of it.  Jonny Lee Miller (whose name, which sounds like some good ol' boy's moniker, is very incongruous for the proper, British upper-crust Holmes) is fantastic as the somewhat insane, exceptionally arrogant, and freakishly perceptive Holmes.  This version of Sherlock Holmes is the upper-class British equivalent to ""Monk.""

And similarly, Dr. Watson, played by the always delectible treat of an actress Lucy Liu, is like Monk's Sharona and Natalie, as much Sherlock's nursemaid as his assistant/partner.

If this show survives long enough it may vie with ""NYPD Blue"" for the coveted title of ""Best Police Drama Ever on Network Television,"" but I am afraid it is too intelligent to last long enough in our current dumbed-down world.  We'll see.",1427414400,,1070,5.074285714285714

Leftover from season one is Holmes's love interest, Jamie Moriarty/Irene Adler, who despite being caught as a villain, still manages to stir feelings in Holmes's heart.

5753376,5,B00CYQXBSQ,"I absolutely love this show. I love the dynamic between Sherlock>Watson>Det. Marcus Bell>Capt. Tommy Gregson. I watched season 1 on DVD(speed-viewing), finished it in a week, and I was hooked. I watch the Cumberbatch/Freeman Sherlock and yes it captures more of the traditional Conan-Doyle elements of his characters but this updated version is well done. Jonny Lee Miller is exceptional as Sherlock. He has all the quirkinsess and the genius of classic Sherlock but they have made subtle changes like making him an addict. I have been a Lucy Liu fan for years and she is very good as Dr. Joan Watson. She is intelligent, likeable, and she is becoming a very good detective. Jon Michael Hill as Detective Marcus Bell is likeable and although there is obvious tension between he and Holmes, there is a mutual respect there, too. I thought the story arc in season 2 re: Marcus' hand injury really added something to the relationship between Marcus and Sherlock. Aidan Quinn, I have been a fan since his role in the brilliant, Dreyfuss/Estevez film, Stakeout. He is solid and his family life reveal in season 2 was touching.

Season 2 was good and brought in classic characters like Lestrade, Mycroft,etc. Good character development between the leads and they all genuinely appear to get along and like each other. Finally, I am such a nerd that I read credits and I was happy to see Robert Hewitt Wolfe added as a co-producer midway during the season. He used to write and produce on the brilliantly written ST: DS9. My man, composer Sean Callery is a freakin' genius when it comes to scoring. He scores 24 and Homeland to name a couple and the original music and the songs chosen for this show are great. I just hope CBS continues to give it a good lead-in on Thursday night.

A good show that I try to watch in primetime if I am awake. But if not, thank God I can watch it on Prime.",1414454400,,1882,4.614925373134328

5753390,1,B00CYQXBSQ,"This is another low quality, terribly bland, colorless, lifeless, dull, drab, fuzzy, sham of a release from CBS. The original airing was in 1080p and, if that is how you saw it originally, this will offend you. It is, in a word, unwatchable. They have released a 480p monstrosity and have no plans for blu-ray release.

Once again, as in the first season release, Watson's skin isn't even the same color as it was in 1080. That is how much they've altered the image by removing so much detail. In the DVD release, it seems almost as though they are trying to remove her ethnicity (which would be insane because that is such a wonderful part of the show and also a part of what makes her character so interesting and so much more unique than the cookie cutter women we're saddled with on most CBS dramas). The sofa is pale and lifeless (the dark yet bright burgundy sofa). His books are all the same color. His stubbly beard disappears from entire episodes.

I'm sorry to say it but I've decided to stop watching it entirely. I have to. Every time i see it, I feel like CBS is just slapping me in the face, once again, with their lack of consideration for all of us fans who fall in love with shows and watch them a dozen times, over and over, because we love them so much. How can I watch it a dozen times when it looks like someone pulled the transfer off an old VHS and stuck it on a dvd? Shame CBS. Shame.",1414022400,23,1408,4.269662921348314

5753414,5,B00CYQXBSQ,"I could repeat the review I wrote for Season 1, because what I wrote in that review also stands for Season 2. I cant recall having ever seen Lucy Liu cast outside the Asian femme-fatale stereotype before, but now I have seen her talent as an actor as I have never seen it before. She takes the dullness out of Watson; lights a flame under him and propels him into orbit a second time.

Whoever thought of the idea of Dr. Watson as a womana Chinese-American woman at thatwas a genius. And we cant blame Arthur Conan Doyle for not thinking of this, because in those days women were the property of men equal to a stove or a couch.

In addition, Johnny Lee Miller plays a Sherlock Holmes so extreme and out-of- this-world that he jumps off the screen and into your imagination like crazy glue.

Oh, one last thing, before I allowed myself the pleasure of watching Season 2, I watched Season 1 for the second time. I think that the script writers hit another home run out of the park.

Will they do it again for Season 3? I'll be waiting to find out.",1412553600,13,1046,4.2944162436548226

Elementary Season 2 provides mystery, action, comedy, love and the battle with many other emotions.

5753525,5,B00CYQXBSQ,"For years I adored Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes and faithfully watched all the old episodes whenever they showed up on my local PBS station.  When the Cumberbatch/Freeman series showed up, I didn't like it at first.  So much quick flash editing annoyed me and made it hard to follow the action.  Eventually I gave it another try, and this time fell in love with it.  It is completely different from the Jeremy Brett approach, but it is every bit as good.

Because I love Sherlock Holmes so much, I was a little protective of the story.  I did not want it ruined for me by a bad interpretation.  I figured that the odds of TWO modern interpretations both being well done hovered around zero, so I didn't even give this one a try.  I did try the first of the Downey/Law movies and left in disgust.  But after a couple of friends whose taste I respect urged me to try Elementary, I did.  In this regard we are living in fortunate times.  We have two excellent, original, and completely different takes on an old favorite, both available to us at the same time for our enjoyment.  The acting is good, the lines are clever, the plots are fresh with just enough reference to the originals to strike a pleasing echo of recognition; in short, Elementary is delicious fun.

It is said that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle grew very tired of his most famous creation, and that is why he tried to kill him off at the Reichenbach Falls.  If Conan Doyle were alive today, I think he would have been very pleased at this turn of events, and maybe even have taken up his pen to write a few more stories.",1409443200,,1582,4.373287671232877
5753526,5,B00CYQXBSQ,"I reviewed season one of this series before and spoke of how wonderful it was. One would think it would fall far short of continuing that ability in its sophomore slump. It's a delight to let you know that the series continues to be a great series that continues to do the character well.

For those who missed season one add it to your collection, watch it and then make sure you purchase this one as well. If you missed it, the series plants Sherlock Holmes into the 21st century in the form of Johnny Lee Miller. Miller's portrayal finds Sherlock an ex-drug addict trying to remain sober by involving himself in the solving of crimes in New York City. Accompanying him through these adventures is his sober coach Joan Watson (Lucy Liu) who not only helps him through each case but becomes a student of his crime solving techniques with the hope of one day becoming a certified sleuth in her own right. Each week another crime calls upon them to assist local chief detective Captain Thomas Gregson (Aidan Quinn).

So what works in this series? Everything. Miller's Holmes isn't always the purest of heroes at times but he is still the ever self assured character that those who loved to books and earlier incantations that we have come to love as seen on screen. He's quirky as all get out, always seems on edge and ready to jump and is almost never wrong in any and all solutions that he brings about in the cases he investigates. At the same time the characters edge here is seen in his boredom felt when there are no new cases or cases that actually give him the rush he needs in being difficult rather than simple. Helping him through those times this season is Joan's interest in becoming his pupil. Mentoring her to become his protg gives him new meaning.

This season also offers some glimpses into Holmes past beginning with a case taking place in London and involving another protg of Holmes, Inspector Lestrade (Sean Pertwee). It turns out that Lestrade used Holmes to help solve cases while taking credit for them himself. Now he finds himself in a jam since Holmes move to NYC has left him alone. All he needs is Holmes assistance in another high profile crime. It seems Lestrade has demons of his own, an addiction to fame and fortune. How Holmes aids him here sets the stage for another appearance of the same character later in the season and Pertwee does a tremendous job here.

We also get to see more of Holme's brother Mycroft as played by Rhys Ifans. It seems that Mycroft, a restaurateur, has opened a new restaurant in NYC much to the displeasure of Holmes. Sherlock views this as an attempt to plant Mycroft there to watch over him by his father. In truth, Mycroft does indeed hope to make a success of the new place and to give him a chance to romance Joan, something else that displeases Sherlock. The interaction between the three characters gives them more depth than on display in season one.

While the entire season is filled with various cases that call upon Sherlock to solve them, we are also moved along in watching Watson develop her own skills as a detective at the same time. This is not the bumbling Watson as seen in the old Rathbone/Brice movies of the past, this is a self assured woman who at times doesn't live up to Holmes brilliance and at others equals his abilities. She is learning quite well but still falls a tad short of his abilities, forcing him to grow fonder of her as time passes.

The season ends with a two parter involving Mycroft that offers a few surprises for all involved.  When it ends no one will be left untouched by the events that unfold and things will be set for more surprises next season. That's a good thing because through it all the series entertains from start to finish, something many shows these days fail to do.

There are no bad performers here. Miller is fantastic as Holmes, Liu is amazing in what could have been a much smaller role, Quinn is believably baffled by some of the cases and yet not the bumbling Lestrade seen in the old films and Ifans as Mycroft becomes one of the most tragic character seen on TV. All of these performances do nothing but elevate this series above most.

If you're a fan of Sherlock Holmes, or even if you're not, then by all means you should be watching this series. Season two moves the series forward in so many ways, all of them positive. As I said earlier, this is one that you not only need to see but to add to your collection. It remains one of the best shows on TV. Purchasing both season 1 and 2 and watching them also gives you a chance to get on board before season 3 begins.",1409356800,,4605,4.466111771700357
