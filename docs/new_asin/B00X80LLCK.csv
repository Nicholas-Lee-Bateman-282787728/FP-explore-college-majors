7166402,5,B00X80LLCK,"I grew up with this movie. Sadly, I ended up losing my only copy around 10 years ago. I tried and tried and tried to find this movie. I even tried yard sales, thrift stores, all over the internet, etc. Finally, I found it and was doing backflips inside. One of my FAVORITE movies of all time.",1471996800,2,292,4.140350877192983

7166404,5,B00X80LLCK,"I had been trying to find this movie on dvd for a few years now, and nobody seemed to have it.  I couldn't believe a movie with this many amazing actresses could be unavailable like that.  Hilariously funny, this movie has been quoted to death by my family for many years.  It effortlessly passes the Bechdel Test, and is a great satirical send-up of the documentary film process as well as the beauty pageant world.",1471478400,5,416,4.52

7166407,1,B00X80LLCK,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  I recently bought the Warner Brothers Achieve Collection DVD of ""Drop Dead Gorgeous.""  Unfortunately, this was a waste of my money.  When it arrived, all looked good.  When I put it in the DVD player--it wouldn't play!  The DVD player couldn't read the disc.  I am truly disappointed that WB could put a product like this on the market.",1525996800,,362,4.578125
7166408,5,B00X80LLCK,"Sardonic humor, great cast and a shake your head snickering kind of ""I can't believe they did/said that kind of movie.  Always good to watch again for a good laugh",1525651200,,163,4.433333333333334
7166409,5,B00X80LLCK,"Okay okay, so this movie is very 90s and not very politically correct but DAMN IS IT FUNNY. Its as funny as I remembered it, if not funnier. Showed it to my fiance and he laughed so hard that even though it is a chick flick (No romance really, just has women in it.) he loved it. From the murder plot, to the small Midwestern town feel (I grew up in the Midwest too!), to the beer can fusing to the moms hand, to the town dummy getting his overalls stuck in a car, to the explosive parade, its hilarious start to finish. It is longer than I remembered, however. WORTH IT.
Also, if you loved Allison Janney in I, Tonya this year, youll definitely love her in this!",1525132800,2,663,4.147286821705427

7166420,5,B00X80LLCK,"Seriously, one of the best dark comedies ever to come out. This movie has tons of great, then mostly unknown and young, actresses in it. It is clever, sarcastic and gloriously irreverent. If you want to laugh, do yourself a favor. I can't believe it's not on Prime streaming.",1518998400,,275,4.63265306122449

Careful when you purchase a DVD from Amazon....if they burn it at their facility.....it is probably NOT going to work.

Then upon opening it, the disc looked homemade and didn't play. Total FRAUD. I am a very loyal Amazon customer, but this is unacceptable. I'm returning and better get my money back. Be careful when purchasing that you are buying from a legit source as Amazon clearly doesn't screen for that.",1515628800,4,438,4.4875

I immediately tried another DVD and it worked like a charm. So, I returned it and asked for another, figuring it was a fluke. Well, today the second DVD came and it also does not load or play.

What could be funnier than a mocumentary about beauty pageants starring Kirsten Dunst, Kirstie Alley, Allison Janney, Denise Richards, and Ellen Barkin, just to name a few. While this movie isn't for everyone, I find it enjoyable, and always find something to laugh at.

7166456,5,B00X80LLCK,"Best movie ever and so hard to find these days. So glad I found it here! If you want to laugh until you cry, buy this movie while it's still available. I looked everywhere and couldn't find it. It's not in stores, it's not on iTunes, it's nowhere except for hard copy on Amazon, but it's worth the wait. I was recently deep in the boonies in Wisconsin and wanted my friends I was visiting to see it, so I had to buy it and have it shipped out to the middle of nowhere, but it paid off because they thought it was the funniest movie they had ever seen. They loved it so much I let them keep it, and then bought it again for myself once I got home. My family and have had inside jokes from this movie since it came out in 1999, and I constantly quote obscure references from it in daily conversation, lol. It's just the best ever, so stop reading this review and just buy it already!!",1493251200,4,882,4.074712643678161

7166459,5,B00X80LLCK,This movie is an equal opportunity offender. They slam everyone. So it's totally fair. If you are easily triggered skip it. Otherwise it's funny in its own twisted little way.,1492732800,,175,4.866666666666666

7166467,5,B00X80LLCK,Used to have the VHS of this movie and loved it. Bought it for my dad for Christmas and he was ecstatic. It's so funny and has so many famous actors in it but is relatively unknown. Highly underrated in my opinion.,1483660800,,214,4.119047619047619
7166468,5,B00X80LLCK,"This is my favorite movie ever, and it makes me sad it's not very well known.  It kind of preempted the mockumentary style, and I think it'd would do very well if re-released.  Basically, it centers around a high school beauty pageant that turns ugly as contestants prove they'll do anything to win.  It makes fun of midwesterners and the triviality of high school rivalries.  It is sharp and witty and so, so funny.",1483660800,,416,4.581081081081081

7166473,5,B00X80LLCK,Love this movie.  It is one of those movies that is made up of a lot of great and memorable scenes.  There is so much humor that is just below the radar.
