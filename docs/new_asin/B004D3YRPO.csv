8424733,5,B004D3YRPO,"Money is one of many quality videos from the Modern Marvels series produced by the History Channel.  This documentary examines the production of American coins and currency.  Topics covered include the United States Mint, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, the various gold and silver rushes of the nineteenth century, the Civil War, counterfeiting measures, and the process of coin and currency production.  At about fifty minutes in length this video is ideal for American history or government classes; in fact, I have used this documentary as a supplement to my American history and government lessons and have found it to be an effective teaching tool.",1497571200,,660,5.326923076923077

8424738,5,B004D3YRPO,"This is an excellent DVD on how our currency is manufactured. I use this video in a technology engineering classroom along with a homework assignment on our currency. Paper currency is manufactured from cotton fibers, not wood fibers that many people assume. Crane Paper Co. manufactures our currency paper, Crane is located in a neighboring town from our school, many of my students know people who are employed there. I pass out $5.00 dollar bills that the students find watermarks and anti counter fitting devices in the paper. The video also explains how coins are manufactured. Excellent video.",1319155200,7,599,5.122448979591836
