7936853,1,B00005B63K,"I bought this for a few dollars in a second-hand store as I had long been curious about Flesh Feast as it is Veronica Lake's last ever movie. That's really the only thing it has going for it. Flesh Feast is an utterly forgettable, amateurish waste of time.

Lake stars as a ""doctor"" in some kind or nursing home/retreat who does secret experiments using maggots to restore youth. She is called upon by a foreign military group to treat their leader and this eventually leads to the ""shock ending"".

The film doesn't make a lot of sense. All the acting is poor, and Veronica Lake is no exception, although as all the dialogue is dubbed, it's hard to tell how good she may have been if the sound had been recorded live. If Veronica Lake was a beauty in her Hollywood heyday, she certainly isn't here. She first appears in a black suit and hat which do hint at a glimmer of sophistication, but this is soon discarded and she spends rest of the movie wearing either a white lab coat or what appears to be a hideously frumpy blue bowling shirt. The movie saves the most unflattering view of it's star for the ending, when Lake is seen in close up, laughing, which unfortunately showcases her mouthful of brown rotten teeth.

Inbetween gawking at Lake, most of the film is very boring. For bad movie fans though, there is one spectacularly hilarious scene when a young woman enters the forbidden laboratory and comes across a dissected corpse. It's hilarious because the body parts are hanging from the ceiling in clear view of the woman the entire time, but the actress feigns ignorance of the horrible sight until she has walked all the way across the room, past the legs, arms and head dangling inches from her nose (in bright harsh lighting no less), until she is finally cued to turn around, ""spot"" them, and then burst into the hammiest screams of horror you have ever seen. Much hilarity, and almost worth buying for that scene alone.

But when I say ""almost"" worth buying, I really mean that. The current DVD release by Telefilms International/Beverly Wiltshire Filmworks is atrocious. It's a DVD recording of a video tape, and not a very good one at that. The source video itself is fullscreen, blurry and comes complete with dropouts, wobble and flickers, all lovingly preserved in the digital medium. Worse still, the print that the video was made from is crackly and full of scratches, missing frames and blotches on the print. But as there appears to be no official release available, I presume this is currently the only way to see the masterpiece that is ""Flesh Feast"".

For the very curious only, and while this is the only print available, I advise paying no more than five dollars for a copy. If a new print of ""Flesh Feast"" is ever found and remastered, it might make it onto a Classic Bad Movie DVD list... but not in this state.",1405209600,2,2843,4.588582677165355
7936854,3,B00005B63K,I hate the fact that this cheapie movie was Veronica Lake's final film! It is nothing like her breakthrough films in her hayday of the 1940's! Lake is my favorite movie star of all time and this film is not the way to remember her! She was a unique icon of the classic films of the 1940's and that is the way I want to look up to her.,1400371200,,334,3.8550724637681157
7936855,3,B00005B63K,"Indeed it's a low budget horror flick, but it's none the less the very last screen appearance of the legendary Veronica Lake.
Lake started out in films at age 17 in 1939, and in the 40's she was a glamourous star as well as a good and competent actress. After ""Ramrod"" in 1951, she left film and did some theater work for a time.
In 1963 she was discovered working as a coctail waitress in the bar of a cheap, low down hotel. This gave her a lot of press, and she subsequently wrote an autobiography.

As stated above, that this was her first movie in more than 20 years - that is actually wrong. She did star in a very little known movie called ""Footsteps in the snow"" (it might be Canadian?) in 1966 before starring in ""Time is terror"" three years later. Info on that film has so far eluded me, but some sources claim it's another title for the film ""Flesh Feast""...

So what do you get here? In 1970, Lake looked far older than her 49 years, with badly stained teeth and a not too becoming stiffly curled, listerine yellow hairdo. What gripped me the most, was that after learning of her years in poverty, her bouts of alcolholism and all her bad luck, she still gambled on her former fame, and that is probaly the reason she made this film... It's sort of an entertaining movie, cheply made - but OK. After this, Lake never worked again, and she died at age 55 from acute hepatitis and alcohol related problems. A sad ending indeed for one of the truly great glamour godesses of the war years",1312243200,,1496,4.320284697508897
7936856,3,B00005B63K,">I tried hard to take this psuedo-scary flick seriously but alas, it is so far/fetched and campy-that I finally was doing little more than half smiling at it's tackinous; asking myself the age-old question,""Why did they ever make movies like this?""!!! It could've been a lot better with {just} a tad bit more budget allowing for an upgrade of props, improved lighting and a cast with less put on accents of foreign nature; with an ameliorated script containing more punch.
>It's as though many lines are flubbed and just left in as is-per/diem, giving the viewer a sense of immediate distaste for the cast in general, including the star, Veronica Lake, who at very first glance appears wicked and detached from all that is around her; including the world in which she currently lives-except for the one she has created down in the basement of her Miami home that looks like little more than a space containing a 'junior scientist's lab starter kit' fresh outta the nearest dime store. With a bit more effort and a less gruesome nature, 'FleshFeast' might have served as the impetus for Veronica Lake's long/awaited comeback, that for reasons obvious in this film-was alas never to be as sadly, her character in this stale flick shows absolutely no redeeming qualities, leaving the disillusioned viewer wanting for a better actor who could have brought at least some semblence of life to this ego-driven maniac so surrounded by the celebration of death and human debris. The one character that is likeable, the young brunette nurse capable perhaps of being the film's heroine is instead wasted in a badly done scene-where in which a revitalized Nazi shamelessly attacks her brutally when she refuses his demands for sex and is subsequently strangled on a bed in an upstairs room within the Florida mansion that houses this entire awful nightmare.
>My opinion of 'FleshFeast' is that it is an all/around bad movie that could've been done much better with a few changes made in the casting and script, makeing for a window of opportunity through which Veronica Lake might have somehow or other-found the propulsion necessary for jumpstarting what had become a stale, hasbeen career...Unfortunately, in 'FlashFeast', she neither comes across as vital OR necessary.",1251590400,2,2260,5.029333333333334
7936857,2,B00005B63K,"I saw the poster for this movie and that's what made me want to watch it in the first place. The poster is pretty cool, this movie, however, is not. Nothing happens at all for a long time, then there's a body. Then nothing happens for a while longer, then Hitler comes in and is killed by flesh eating maggots. Very very boring. I can't recomend this at all",1224720000,,357,4.188405797101449

7936859,1,B00005B63K,"In the 1940s, Veronica Lake made a meteoric rise to film stardom, thanks to her sultry beauty and, her highly exploited ""peekaboo"" hairstyle. She starred opposite big names like Alan Ladd and Fredric March, scoring screen successes in films like ""This Gun For Hire"" and ""I Married A Witch"". She held her own with female stars as well, and she surprised even her detractors with her performance as a bitter navy nurse in ""So Proudly We Hail"". But changing times and her own failings caught up with her, and by the end of the decade, her heyday was over. With two unsuccessful marriages behind her (and two more in her future) Veronica headed for New York City, where she made occasional television and summer stock appearances before dropping completely out of sight. It was briefly big news when she was found working as a barmaid in a second rate hotel in the early sixties. But by now, her longtime alcoholism and years of hard living had robbed her of her looks. Without them, public interest in her soon faded again. She did return to the stage in assorted vehicles, but her success was minimal. Eventually, she relocated to Miami, Florida, where she lived in relative obscurity. In 1966 she went to Canada for a part in an obscure movie called ""Footsteps In The Snow"" which had no U.S. release. The following year, she was discovered by some industrial filmmakers who had long wanted to produce a commercial feature. They approached her to star in their film ""Time Is Terror"" and convinced her to invest in the project. As one author put it, ""If ever a movie queen suffered a terminal comedown, this was it"". Surrounded by amateur performers and pathetic production values, she failed even to rise to a minimal level in this Miami, Florida shot quickie. Looking utterly ordinary in long shots, and luridly aged in close-ups, poor Veronica didn't act so much as walk through her part. As a deranged doctor, who has hit upon a successful youth restoration formula, using flesh-eating maggots!, she looks both bored and confused, her most unintentionally hilarious moment coming when she is forced to ad-lib while she struggles gamefully to don a pair of rubber gloves. The supporting cast is no help at all, merely advancing the plot by talking it to death. Director Brad Grinter apparently only required the actors to move while the camera was pointed at them, no need for anything resembling entertainment. According to Veronica herself, the film was shelved for three years because no master shots were filmed. But in 1970, the production company scraped it together, changed the title to ""Flesh Feast"", and released it to cash in on Lake's just published biography. And, because former leading ladies such as Bette Davis, Joan Crawford and Olivia De Havilland had unexpectedly revived their careers in horror movies, this travesty was promoted as Veronica's ""comeback film"". This seems a strange course of action for the filmmakers to pursue, though, because it's unlikely that the (young) audience for a horror film of this quality either knew or cared who Veronica Lake was. As expected, it did nothing for Veronica's career, and she died in poverty, three years later. A previous reviewer cites a scene in which a female detective working undercover as a nurse in the doctor's laboratory (overseeing the theft of bodies from a nearby morgue) enlists the help of a multi-talented chauffeur to cut up the body parts. ""Poor Mrs. Lustig,"" she sighs, ""I hope she doesn't mind leaving her body to science."" ""Try not to think about it,"" advises the chauffeur, sawing away. ""I guess you are right, Hans."" concludes the detective/nurse, ""What is done is done."" What a sad end to the career of a still fondly remembered star.

7936860,2,B00005B63K,"I was excited to see that this perverse, doofy vanity film, Veronica Lake's feeble attempt to enter the Joan Crawford horror sweepstakes, was out on DVD. That is, until I got home with it and saw the picture, er, quality. ECCHHHHHH!!!!

This has to be THE WORST LOOKING DVD in DVD history, to date. It looks as if it were badly videotaped off a TV station's antiquated film-chain system, and then, only after that videotape was duped once, twice, thrice was it committed to the digital realm.

It's even out of frame. At the bottom of the picture is a little sliver of the TOP of the picture.

If you can get past this visual assault, you're in for a demented, campy cheap-film treat. Shot in South Florida (which automatically makes any '60s Z-movie worth watching, IMHO), this amateurish effort transcends taste, logic, art and structure. I consider it to be the final gem of the cycle of low-grade horror/SF that started in the early '50s and stretched to roughly 1970.

Many quotable lines of dialogue, atmosphere that suggests a screwed-up episode of THE LUCY SHOW, some cheesy library music, and Lake's strident but appealing final performance: this crap-film's got it goin' on.

I hope someone (Criterion? ;D) will give this film the TLC it needs, and that one day we'll have a crisp, clear version of this demented gem to view.",1116633600,17,1336,4.741379310344827
