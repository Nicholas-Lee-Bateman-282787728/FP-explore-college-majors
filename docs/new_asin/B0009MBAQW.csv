8063145,5,B0009MBAQW,"This is an outstanding and hilariously funny DVD with many characters, stories and comedic moments. Bob Nelson is exceptionally talented. We liked it so much we purchased additional copies for family and friends. Bob Nelson is truly a man of a thousand voices and impressions. If you are looking for real comedy that is clean and hysterically funny, this DVD is the answer and Bob Nelson is the man!!",1303776000,2,400,4.811594202898551
8063146,2,B0009MBAQW,"I liked that his comedy was very wacky, animated, and clean, but it was ""smile with an occasional laugh"" funny.  I only laughed a handful of times, and those laughs didn't last long.  For me, 2 stars.  For young kids it might be a 4 or even 5 star.  My personal favorite is Brad Stine's ""Put A Helmet On!""  He is animated as well, but also intelligent, relevant, and fall out HILARIOUS.",1232668800,,386,4.305555555555555
8063147,5,B0009MBAQW,"Bob Nelson was a friend of the great ""Red Skelton"", A comedian who didn't need to use foul language to get a laugh. If you would like your family to enjoy an evening of laughter with out all of that, this is the DVD for you.",1228089600,5,224,3.891304347826087
8063148,4,B0009MBAQW,"This IS a funny video, Bob Nelson is funny no matter what audience he is performing for.  But I was disappointed because I was looking for the ""older"" Bob Nelson (when he still used profanity).  This one is real clean.  It does have the ""morning on the farm"" skit, which is ALWAYS good for quite a few laughs.  I would give this a 5 if he still did some of his more hard core stuff.",1173744000,3,382,4.053333333333334
8063149,3,B0009MBAQW,"This was not the greatest comedy tape; however, it did spotlight bob nelsons wackiness and give a good overview of his talent and trademark sketches. It was enjoyable and I would recommend it.",1153785600,5,192,4.848484848484849
