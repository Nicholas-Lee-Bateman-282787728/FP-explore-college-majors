I bought it quickly without checking the running time - 35 minutes with the interview???  My daughter was disappointed it's so short. It feels like a very brief, undeveloped snapshot of some parts of the book. But, hey, my kids still like it, for now. It's also kind of nice seeing young girls from the '80s/early '90s who are dressed like little girls (IMDB says this was made in 1991)), and I really like the theme of the ""movie"", which seems to be Sheila facing her fears. It just could have been so much more, like the Ramona Quimby movie my kids like so much!",1416355200,2,711,4.3059701492537314
8292223,3,B001D88LS6,"Otherwise Known As Sheila the Great is a novel by Judy Blume. 20+ years ago it was adapted into a 23-minute television episode directed by Judy's son, Lawrence. (He would later go on to direct the film of another one of her novels, Tiger Eyes, this time as a full-length feature.) This movie -- I'll call it a movie, even though it's so short -- focuses on Sheila Tubman's fears, especially her fears of dogs and swimming. We see her meet Mouse Ellis, junior yo-yo champion, and we get a truncated ""Slam Book"" scene. We see her interactions with Jennifer the dog (who is, I have to say, super cute.) We also are treated to Marty, Sheila's attractive swimming instructor, and the funny, typical-teenage-girl reactions of older sister Libby.

One of things I always loved about the novel was that it took a character who is terribly annoying from classmate Peter Hatcher's perspective (Sheila's just awful in Tales Of A Fourth Grade Nothing!) and shows her in her own light and makes her likable. From Sheila's point of view, she's... well, she's no angel, but she's someone we can relate to and sympathize with.

Since we are only given a brief glance into Sheila's summer vacation/life in this movie, fans of the book will most certainly be left mildly disappointed. Where's the hide-and-seek scene, with Sondra getting stuck in the milk box? The Peter Pan play? The clay elephants, the camp newspaper fiasco, and the lore of Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman? Of course those couldn't make it into 23 minutes, and so that leaves us with one question -- if fans of novel will find it lacking, who will want to watch this movie?

My suggestion: show it to a child who hasn't yet read Judy Blume as a way of introducing him or her to one of the stories. Or, if you're a teacher, show it to your class after reading the novel, and challenge the kids to spot all the differences from the book -- you could make it a lesson in what happens when books get adapted to film. Finally, if you're just a huge Judy Blume fan, you should probably watch or even own this, because Judy herself did write/produce it, so it had her stamp of approval.

This DVD includes one Special Feature, an ""interview"" of sorts with Judy and Lawrence Blume discussing the making of the movie. It's a nice bonus, and again, true JB fans will not want to miss that.",1371772800,7,2339,4.561904761904762
