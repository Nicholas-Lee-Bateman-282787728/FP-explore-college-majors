8009987,5,B0001CNQXK,Ordered as a replacement for a copy we borrowed.  Works well and is a compelling story.,1499731200,,87,4.4375
8009988,4,B0001CNQXK,"I liked this little documentary!  It showed a lot of potential.  Unfortunately, this camp was never replicated with a bit more programming and planning.  It was the brain child of some folks who wanted to see something positive result from the tragedy of September 11th.  It was a great attempt to bring together children from different religious and cultural backgrounds to see what happens when they stop pointing fingers and learn how to trust one another.  I give the film and its producers an A for effort.",1265760000,,511,4.827586206896552
8009989,1,B0001CNQXK,"I fully expected to see a decent documentary that showed how children of different faiths came together at camp and how they gained understanding of each other's views.  This simply didn't deliver.  As a matter of fact, there was very little about the different religions other than showing Muslims praying and the kitchen being made kosher.  Counselors at the camp had absolutely nothing planned.  There was no agenda.  The camp was like any other and there were no workshops to help the kids gain an understanding of each other.  The mix of religions was hardly explored beyond the trivial.  Absolutely nothing was learned from watching this documentary.

For a far more compelling movie that features children exploring the differences between their cultures and religions, I highly recommend a documentary called ""Promises"".  It is superior to ""Trust Me"" in every way imaginable.  ""Promises"" should be required viewing for everyone everywhere.

8009990,5,B0001CNQXK,"This documentary of the 1st camp held after 9/11 is an inspiration.

The production is first rate.  The producers and all involved captured the

spirit of the moment....showing the trust and respect from all three faiths toward each other, in such a crucial time after the terrorist attacks.  This film is uplifting and would love to have the leaders

of the world share the views expressed in the film.",1181260800,,403,4.782608695652174
8009991,5,B0001CNQXK,"This film has won several awards and rightly so.  The saga of young boys on a journey as gripping as the fictional ""Stand By Me"" touches more deeply because it is true.  The corpse the kids know is out there is the gloom that presses on them all after September 11th.  How do boys grow to manhood solid in their consciences, able to freely practice their religion and live in their culture while being tolerant of others?  How are children affected by the horrible acts of adults? Can they make a community where friendship, understanding and individuality are displayed in the care of good role models, even if it only lasts a week or is such a hope not possible?  Get this film. Watch it. Share it. Think about it.  These boys have put themselves on the line for us.  Thank them.  I do.",1084233600,,788,4.423611111111111
