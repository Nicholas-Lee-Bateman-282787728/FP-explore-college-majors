3876325,5,B002935GDW,"This is how your mom would have taught you to cook, if your mom had cared enough about you to take the time... but it's NOT too late, because these DVDs ARE available - seriously - buy them all!",1366675200,,194,4.0
3876326,1,B002935GDW,"I have no qualms with the recipes, which are easy to prepare and far tastier than one finds in other cookbooks. My distaste for America's Test Kitchen is customer service, which they do not offer.

After asking for a large quantity of DVDs, I waited.

After two months and only after enquiring about my order, I was told that they had been back-ordered.

After two months longer and only after enquiring about my order, I was told that there simply weren't any more available.

I see. Business must be so good that there is no need to even contact or please the customer. Fine.  My money walks.",1322179200,8,594,4.514018691588785
3876327,4,B002935GDW,"I really enjoy much of America's Test Kitchen, even if I will not use it,  but I object to their scheme (or scam) that keeps them sending things unless you tell them to stop.  I had ordered a number of books and DVDs for myself and gifts.  Then some items came that I had not ordered.  I really didn't pay much attention, thinking that I had forgotten what I had ordered.  Unfortunately I was a victim of their marketing.
If you are going to get any ""extra"" of their books, etc. and do not want surprises that you end up paying much more for, be certain to contact them (it takes more than once) and let them know NOT to send anything that you didn't order.
They get 5 stars for content but minus a couple for marketing ploys.",1310083200,4,726,4.194244604316546
3876328,5,B002935GDW,"Season 1 where it all began is not as large in volume of recipes as the following seasons are but certainly a must have excellent academic, thorough and entertaining culinary resource for all home cooks and professional chefs who desire to be a step above the rest, and not wasting their time in the kitchen reinventing the wheel. Regardless of which season, America's Test Kitchen takes the guessing out with detailed step by step instructions on how and why a certain ingredient, recipe and equipment is used along with a sleuth of informative factual and scientific tid bits explained in an easy-to-understand manner. Every season covers an array of primal and sub-primal meat cuts, fabrication, best cooking methods, equipment and product testing, ingredient taste tests, authentic to modern variation on many made-from-scratch global and regional soups, salads, appetizers, entrees, desserts, sauces, rubs, marinades and seasonings. Buy the whole collection and you will never be disappointed.",1272153600,3,998,5.445161290322581
3876329,4,B002935GDW,"I love this show and recommend it to anyone who likes cooking.  Unfortunately many products used and tested are not available in Australia (including the Kithenaid Pro 600) :-( but that is not the fault of the show.  Unlike the previous reviewer I do enjoy the testing sections for they highlight the fact that there are differences between brands of food and equipment and has prompted my to do some tast testing between brands available in Australia.  I would give this 5 stars except for the fact that there are no sub-titles.  This is inexcusable for DVD's today.  My elderly father, who enjoys cooking and has more time to cook than me, had real difficulty understanding the higher pitched voices of the two female chefs and was constantly asking me what they were saying. I wonder how many sales are lost becuase of lack of sub-titles.",1267574400,7,841,4.732876712328767
3876330,5,B002935GDW,"The shows are excellent.  I found the quality of the production to be very good.  The recipes are great, the episodes are fun to watch and they are often humorous.  I personally would prefer more cooking and less equipment and product taste testing, but that is just a personal preference.

[Note: There are no recipes included on these DVD's - of any season - until Season 9.  Season 9 does have recipes.  Presumably they will be included in future editions, as well.  Clearly they wanted to sell the recipes either in the companion book or online, so it is to their credit they have started including the recipes on the DVD's.  Also, there seem to be parts of episodes missing from the DVD's that were part of the actual season.  The web site has all the episodes listed with each and every recipe they did.]

I have copies of all seasons and I would recommend them in spite of these issues because they are very helpful, instructive, and fun to watch.

You can get all old seasons on their web site for 50% off and with quite reasonable shipping costs.",1262995200,21,1055,4.5
