2627324,3,B000H5TH0M,"The usually sweet and kind Angie Harmon pulls a Tallulah Bankhead die die my darling in her role as the titular good mother who is not so good.  Harmon chews up the scenery with a tenacity and venom equal to those other madames who've played psychomommies.  Seems like everytime she and hubby Joel Gretsch take in a foster child, the child perishes.  Seems like Munchhausen's has a new poster mommy.  Her latest wards are a teenager (well played by Jordan Hinson) and her little brother.  They were left parentless due to an auto accident and family's good friend cop Jason London is forced to place them in foster care.  Once the children arrive at their new home, however, they find themselves virtual prisoners under the possessive care of Harmon.

There aren't a lot of surprises in this by the book thriller, but Harmon is so delightfully evil she makes it all worthwhile.",1161648000,6,877,4.730263157894737
2627325,5,B000H5TH0M,"This movie is like the original Glass House movie, but I think it's more ""cut up"". I don't know. The original one had the foster father (forget his name at the moment) try to kill the kids at the end of the movie. In this movie, the foster mother goes crazy and tries to kill the sister and brother. I won't ruin the movie for others, but it's a good movie... least I thought it was!",1161648000,,383,4.052631578947368
2627326,2,B000H5TH0M,"The movie never does explain the bed in the basement? & it does not explain who is seen by Abby sneaking around outside?

Movie was going along fine but lacks in that it never substantiates the above two items & their signifigance to being seen in the 1st place.",1160524800,,262,4.346938775510204

2627363,5,B000H5TH0M,I Luv Angie Harmon! She kills the role of The Good Mother! I watch it over and over. Matter of fact. I'm going to watch it again!,1400803200,3,129,3.814814814814815

2627365,5,B000H5TH0M,"I just loveeee Angie Harmon. I saw this movie once before and loved it too. When I saw it was only a few bucks I was like, why not? I chose two day shipping and was supposed to get it on 12-31-13 but was very happy to get it a day early. Don't know who's responsible for that, but thank you!

The DVD itself was brand new, never opened and in excellent condition. Not much else to review there. Speedy delivery. Happy customer.

The movie, if you haven't seen it, is great. You should definitely get this. Don't wanna spoil anything, so just find out for yourself what happens! :)",1390867200,5,580,4.263636363636364
2627366,3,B000H5TH0M,"This was entertaining to watch, but it's just the same old rehashed thing. Nothing more new or original brought to the sequel. The acting was good by Angie Harmon and it looked nice on DVD. The movie was good, but they should have done something more with this movie. It was way too predictable as well. I did like the lead young girl, but the husband sure doesn't do much in this film except get bossed around. Entertaining to watch, but don't expect too much",1381708800,,460,4.423529411764706
2627377,3,B000H5TH0M,The description of this movie sounded so good I bought it without ever hearing of it. The movie was basically good but not as suspenseful as I thought it would be,1373068800,,162,4.258064516129032
2627378,5,B000H5TH0M,This move was good I really didn't know what to expect even though I read what it was about.  It was a somewhat of a thriller  I really purchase it because I like  Angie Harmon once again she was good,1371859200,,200,3.95
2627379,3,B000H5TH0M,"It was okay, but kind of an obvious plot and bad acting.  I probably would not see it again.  Bland.",1364083200,,100,3.95
2627380,4,B000H5TH0M,"i received this dvd with REMARKABLE SPEED but NOT AS REQUESTED, i asked for FULL SCREEN version but was sent wide screen instead.",1323302400,,129,4.6521739130434785
2627381,2,B000H5TH0M,"""The Good Mother"" begins with recently orphaned children, Abby and Ethan, who are adapted by seemingly nice husband and wife Raymond and Eve living in a fancy house. But of course the two children will find that the couple's nice and kind attitudes hide something else, something that was NOT seen in the previously released ""The Glass House,"" made about five years ago.

I don't spoil your fun of watching ""The Good Mother""  another entry of Sony's direct-to-video film, of which story itself, predictable and ridiculous, would not be of much interest to most of you than the (intentionally, I guess) campy acting from the leading lady Angie Harmon as Eve. Her unique character would surely remind you of ""Mommy Dearest"" if not as intense as Faye Dunaway's now legendary performance. Look how Eve, or a good mother if you like, checks out each item before having dinner with awfully boring husband, saying ""Chicken, beans, salad, wine ... perfect."" In a scene you can see her actually growling like a tiger. That's hilarious.

If you can ignore the countless plots holes and incredible stupid decisions some characters make, you might find yourself enjoying this B thriller. Surprisingly good is Jordan Hinson as Abby, who deserves a much better script than this. To these two leading ladies go my two stars.",1177027200,4,1309,4.9409090909090905
2627382,1,B000H5TH0M,"I have always said when it comes to Hollywood sequels they are usually always worse than the ""original"" movie.

Unfortunately, I was proven right again by this sequal to the excellent ""original"" Glass House movie.

The problem with ""Glass House 2"" is its absolute predictability: This starts with the plot, moves to the general atmosphere, applies to the fate of the characters, and lasts right up to the happy ending.  Therefore, really everything is sooo predictable, that it takes the suspense out of even the most promising scenes, where one can tell that the producers were trying desperately to conjure up some suspense, but, nonetheless, everything comes to no avail.

While watching this movie, as an avid Thriller fan, I kept thinking to myself this can't be it, there must be some kind of a departure or twist in the story coming any time soon, from this all too predictable plot.  Well, there was none what so ever, the movie just kept draging on, in its rather slow pace and fashion.

The acting was solid, especially the ""good"" mother, but what's the use, when even that is wasted in such a run of the mill story.

One can really see that the only motive in making such sequels, and films in general, is money.  Also the aforementioned 2 instances where the figure that the sister of the younger brother sees is never explained, as well as the bed in the basement are logical flaws, that were added undoubtedly for suspense purposes.  I don't think that they really mar the film much.  These cases are not real problems, the real problem is the sheer predictability, which makes everything seem dull and tedious.

So do yourself a favor and avoid this one, if you haven't see the first movie, see it, its fabulous and in contrast to this one very exciting and unpredictable 'til the end.

P.S. Maybe my rating wouldn't have been as harsh, had this movie not been called ""Glass House 2"", but with that title it just raised my expectations immensly, hence, the 1 star rating.",1170374400,12,1986,4.69164265129683
2627383,2,B000H5TH0M,"This type of movie, more often than not, delves into the realm of camp. An over the top character like the mother in this film fits the bill perfectly. One minute sweet as pie, the next minute spitting venom to the enjoyment of all viewers. The problem with this film is that it takes itself far too seriously. There are endless shots of birds flying, sunsets,and exterior shots of the house all for no reason. The film moves at a glacial pace for most of the begining and is hampered by an absolutely ludicrous ending(even by thriller standards). Really only worth a watch for the performance by Angie HArmon.",1167955200,,610,4.605504587155964
2627384,4,B000H5TH0M,"I have to say that I especially enjoyed this movie.  I'm a fan of the first Glass House movie, so when I saw this sequel in the video store I thought it sounded good.

I didn't expect much at the start because I know that most sequels tend not to come up to the standard of the first movie.

But I was enormously enterained by this movie.

It is basically set out a little bit the same as the first movie, but with vast differences.

When Abby and her brother are adopted by Eve and Raymond, things look good, but Eve is hiding a dark secret.

I was very impressed with Angie Harmon (Eve).  She is a sensual beauty and that makes her evil side all the more terrifying.  She puts in a suberb performance and switches from good to evil in a heartbeat.  The scene with the oven cleaner made me squirm.

An enjoyable treat.",1167004800,,819,4.1923076923076925
2627385,5,B000H5TH0M,"Angie Harmon is just great in this role.  Her ""southern"" beauty, smile and accent hides her dark secret very very well.  She is truly an actress we need to see much more of these days. Jordan Hinson is a true up and coming star in her own right................have fun with this one BUT don't expect Mommie Dearest here.....Eve is one mean soul (if she has one)",1162252800,,361,4.454545454545454
