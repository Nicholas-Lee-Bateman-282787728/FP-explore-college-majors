677030,2,6303536069,"The Critters series has always been filled to the top with humor and silly effects. They're pure camp and to be enjoyed for their cheesiness and delightful humor. Part 3 continues this trend, but instead of being filled to the top with humor and cheese, it boils over, and as everyone knows, too much of a good thing can turn bad faster than you can say, ""Stop that movie.""
It's clear that the critters should have been left dead in the previous sequel, as here they're made into complete jokes. We actually get to see critters in the kitchen having a good time, but what is the point of that? One eats liquid soap and burps bubbles, while another gets into beans and...well, you can guess the result of that. Certainlynot scary, not funny, and not enjoyable. The little buggers seem bigger than the other sequels as well, must be all that trash they're eating in this new diet of theirs. There aren't even many cool death scenes, which is what made the first two so good. Here we get a foot wearing a rabbit slipper attacked, but the damn person get away. Almost no one dies, and to make it even worse, it's almost impossible to like any of the characters and want them to live.

Surprisingly David J. Schow is the writer of this sequel. He's the same man who penned the script for TCM 3, which was dark and decent; here he was either half asleep or just didn't have any semblance of a clue. Most of the acting is terrible as well. Leo doesn't do bad in his first role but as for the rest - john Calvin, Katherine, Cortez, ,Aimee Brooks, Geoffrey Blake and others - they're less than medicre some of the time and certainly don't improve the enjoyability of this little stink bomb. To make it even worse, Charlie returns and if you have read any of my previous reviews on the Critters series, you know my thoughts on him already.

The ending doesn't seem to resolve anything and none of these people even come off that scared. It's a lesson in what not to do when creating a film, and a way to bring down a previously fun, campy series.",1379635200,,2036,4.383597883597884
677031,2,6303536069,"This film picks up two years later with Charlie, the alien bounty hunter (Don Keith Opper) being the only member of the original two films whose career couldn't pick up. This film does have another cute kitchen feeding frenzy scene, although it really doesn't have anything else that is entertaining.

This film features a young Leonardo DiCaprio as well as a young Aimee Brooks with neither one showing any promise with this script. The film was a let down riding on the coattails of its previous success. Apparently there are always eggs left behind that hatch in 2 year cycles which is why they opted to keep the sequel in the same boring location.

677112,4,6303536069,"I actually like this one better than Critters 2.  It pretty much follows the same formula as the first film by focusing on one group of people (this time trapped in an apartment complex with the ravenous Critters).  The bounty hunters are MIA.  Charlie only appears at the beginning and the end.  The movie opens with an odd coincidence when a family of three just happen to end up at the same rest stop as their conniving landlord.  What are the odds?  Even weirder, they just happen to run into Charlie while playing with a Frisbee.  He pops out of a hole in the ground and through a series of flashbacks/snippets (out of order), relates the contents of the first two movies.  In another strange turn of events, he hands off a magic crystal, saying it's a Crite early warning system, when it glows green WATCH OUT!  Naturally, Crite eggs find their way under the family's camper so the crystal could be put to good use later.  There's more humor and wreckage than death in this installment.  I found it oddly endearing.  Yes, it lacks imagination (maybe I'm just responding favorably to its familiarity).  At any rate, I enjoyed it.",1366848000,,1134,4.61
677113,4,6303536069,"Alright I do not care for Leonardo De Caprio I do not really care for him or his films. I bought this film for the Critters, Charlie, and to complete the series. Now Critters 3 is no Shakespearean film in fact it's just a guilty pleasure for me. People say it's funny but I do not see what's so funny about farting and burping. This is my least favorite of the franchise I much prefer the first 2 and part 4. None the less the film is still fun as a b grade cheesy monster film it's at least better than the stuff the syfy channel churns out each weekend. The DVD cover art is strange why in the world are the critters flying I guess it was  a foreshadowing for what's to come in part 4. So it goes like this Charlie is  hunting the critters and they have their eggs latch onto the bottom of a van. The van goes to LA and arrives at an apartment complex now the critters hatch and you'd except to see a lot of carnage but you don't instead it's more based around on how it affects a family like in part one except in part one you got to see the critters tear things apart and the bounty hunters blow stuff up but not this film the critters aren't shown much and Charlie is only at the beginning and the end. The final finish with the critters is not that great and is a let down but part 4 would pick things up sadly I'll have to wait to get part 4. The DVD comes with some special features like the other DVD releases and a chapter insert or what I'd like to call a mini poster because on the other side is art work for the film/the poster. I only recommend this film to die hard De Caprio fans or Critters fans like my self. The DVD get's  5/5 stars and the film it's self get's 2.5/5 stars.",1362355200,,1693,4.002958579881657

677116,2,6303536069,"Normally there's like some way of showing that there may be a sequel for another movie in most movies, and after Critters 2, there wasn't anything showing for a 3rd movie.  I even thought that there wasn't a third Critters movie 'til I seen it on SyFy years ago and watched it.  Then I wasn't sure what to think but now I think that it's good, the writing seems to be a little improved over the first two movies but it still has that cheesy feel to it and of course the Critters still have their sense of humor in this movie.  The effects of all the movies so far have been good for their time and if they were done today I think that these movies would probably look better visually.  Though there are some that may not know that with this movie was Leonardo DiCaprio's film debut and I think he done well for his first film, even if it was either a television movie or a straight to video release.  Overall I give Critters 3, 2.5 stars out of 5.",1299888000,,947,4.1530054644808745
677117,3,6303536069,"The Crites have returned, and this time they are taking over a downtown apartment building in the city! Now, the tenants must find a way to destroy the furious fur-balls once and for all along with the help of everyone's favorite intergalactic bounty hunter, Charlie (Don Opper from CRITTERS 1 and 2). CRITTERS 3 holds together perfectly with the same formula and light tone found in the previous two entries. The creature designs are as creepy as ever, this time differentiating a few of the Crites with battle scars to give them more character and personality. While the series has never been known for having huge body counts, there are a decent number of bloody deaths that keep the action steady. CRITTERS 3 is most often remembered for being one of the early film debuts of a young Leonardo DiCaprio, who appears as the son of the evil landlord. Though it may not require much thought to enjoy, this third film still makes for plenty of safe scares and silly monster fun.

Cast:  John Calvin, Aimee Brooks, Christian Cousins, Joseph Cousins, William Dennis Hunt, Nina Axelrod, Leonardo DiCaprio, Don Keith Opper.

Running Time:  86 minutes

Rated PG-13 for violence and mild language.

""Critters 3"" starts on the open road as Clifford (John Calvin) his teenage daughter Annie (Aimee Brooks) & his young son Johnny are heading back home from a vacation. Suddenly the tyre on their van blows & they have to stop at a public rest area to fix it. While there Annie and Johnny meet a kid named Josh (Leonardo DiCaprio in his Hollywood debut) who in turn all run into Charlie McFadden (the films co-producer Don Keith Opper) from the previous two ""Critters"" films. Charlie tells them the story of the Krites and the town of Grovers Bend but they don't believe him, meanwhile back at the van a critter lays some eggs on it's underside, out of sight from everyone. Once Clifford has fixed the tyre the trio set off for their home, a run down urban tenement block in Los Angeles somewhere complete with Critter eggs along for the ride. Upon arrival the eggs hatch & the Critters head straight inside the tenement block quickly disposing of Frank (Geoffrey Blake), the caretaker. As the night draws on the few remaining residents, a fat woman named Rosalie (Diana Bellamy), a telephone repair woman Marsha (Katherine Cortez), an elderly couple Mr. (Bill Zuckert) & Mrs. Menges (Frances Bay) must come together with Clifford & his kids to fight the Critters. Josh also makes an appearance as his Stepfather (William Dennis Hunt) owns the building. But will the group be able to defeat the Critters & prevent themselves from becoming dinner?

Let's be honest, no one say to be shocked to discover this is a cheap little film that doesn't have too much going for it. The plot is the usual: people hunted by critters, this time in a building so it's like ""Die Hard"" with aliens.  Sadly the action is poor, it's not really gorym and the critter attacks are always more funny than thrilling. There is no real excitement or tension and it's all a bit predictable The supposed comedy is nowhere near the one it aspires to (Joe Dante's ""Gremlins"") and really the funniest bit is how silly the whole thing is. Needless to say the acting is poor and some people can't even be mauled convincingly; however, it is interesting to see DiCaprio's debut, even if he looks about 9 years old!  Overall, ""Critters 3"" is a ridiculous bit of dumb fun that is daft and slightly shoddy, not nearly living up to the previous two installments in the series. It may just pass the time but there are much better horror/comedies out there if you want them.",1135900800,2,2674,4.731182795698925
677143,3,6303536069,"This one does not have a lot of action in it. A very low death count. Don Opper is a minor characters in this one only appearing at the very begining and very end of the film. Also appearing in this movie in his film debut is a tennage Lenodarno Di Caprio. He has a minor rule also.

Once again the krites apperance has changed. They do not look the same.

This one is more humorous. There is a gag in this similar to in gremlins where the krites our in a dark room  but instead of watching Snow White there watching a demonstration on how to prepare chicken.

There are fewer subtitles in this  than in the original for the krites. We she a new ability of the krites in this film.  When I danger they can let off this loud wobbling cry that is so intense in puitch it can shatter glass. I thought the crystal that glowed when the krites where near by was cool.

I thought the part when charile  charges the krite and grabes it and  falls of the top of the roof was funny. The part when the krites are tearing up the old couples apartment and scarfying down one there beans.  One off the krites chugs down some dish soap.  The fire work krite gag was the funnest gag in the movie.  If you like this one I recommend the others.  If you want lots of action I recommend the first and the second only.",1130198400,,1297,4.099206349206349
677144,3,6303536069,"They really should make another CRITTERS movie.  With a proper budget, a good script and a dedicated director one solidly entertaining movie could reenergize the whole franchise and take it to a new level.  The most important change that needs to be made is you have to get rid of the goofy Charlie character.  He was in all four movies and sucked in all four movies.  Also make the movies much darker, without so much story and you've got a hit.

As far a Part 3 goes some Krites invade a small apartment building and chase people all around but only kill two people.  It's entertaining, but at the same time disappointing.  The story goes nowhere, the direction is strictly by the numbers and of course you got the goofy dude showing up and slowing down the story.  There is a lot of wasted potential here.

The one and only reason this movie is in my collection is because this is one of the earliest starring roles for Aimee Brooks, who is now legal and very sexy.  If you don't believe me just watch MONSTER MAN.",1108339200,,1017,4.419354838709677
677145,3,6303536069,"I thought this was an ok sequel but not as good as the first 2 films. I think there should not have been any more sequels after 2 because it ended really well. This one could have been a little better and the same thing goes for part 4. The only good part of 3 is when they show Charlie, the rest of the movie is kind of boring. I own all 4 of these films on dvd and even recommend this one to add to your collection.",1091923200,,417,3.75
677146,3,6303536069,"Fist the terrorized a farm. then they over ran the town of Grovers Bend.  Now they have  moved up into an apartment.  This was and okay film.  It was not as good as the first to. Don Opper  retuns as charlie. This  has the less gore of the 4th movies. A very low death count only 2 people die  in this one.
Things I like the cystal Charle gives the boy glows when  there in danger.  Lenoard De Caprio looks interesting in this film. This porbably was his first  movie to star in.  Not as successfull as the other films he wasin but still pretty good.
Just like in critter 1 ans 2 the krites apperance has been altered. It has some fun parts in it.  There is this part is really fun when Josh Lenadord Dicapro  goes with his father to evict the people living in  the apartment.
After he shuts of the power he hears the sound of a televesion.  He goes to investigate.  This part of the movie I think wassupposed to  be a rip of off  the part in Gremlins when the Gremlins are watching Snow white.  The Krites are watching a  thing one a  batter powered t.v about how to pre pare chicken.
It get real intense  near the end especial when the apart catchs one fire.  The fire is  caused by  one of the Krites that died  by shallowing a flare.  This is similiar to a gag that was in the first one where one of the Krites swallows a lit fire cracker.
The little boy I adormal. At the end of the movie the dad and grows  real  cllose tohis shown and daughter.  They apolize for they way they have treated each other. Pretty good  movie.
Here what they could have done tomkae it better. Gaving Charlie a larger rule, put more gore  in  it. Brought bradly brown back again have put ug in it.  Ug you do not see again until  the last one or  credits of 3 if you choose to watch them.  I will and alway will like critters. I own all four on VHS.
I am planning of buying them on DVD so I can watch them more frequently. Crittes series is great but Vhs were out real quickly if you watch then alot.  I will and always will like critters.",1081382400,2,2023,4.066326530612245
677147,3,6303536069,"Ok, first off let me just start off by saying there is a whole lot more to this movie than Leonardo DiCaprio, infact, I am ashamed to own this movie because he is in it, anyways this movie is pretty good if you like the critter series, its even a bit scary at times. The only reason why i don't like this movie is because it just doesn't follow the rest of them. but if you like the critter series go for this movie! it really isn't all that bad!",1079481600,,446,3.966666666666667
677148,2,6303536069,"As you may know there are some B movies that consist of pointless sequels. There are also B movies that after a sequel, the series takes a nose dive. This is the category that Critters 3 falls into. First off, I realize that B movies are not to be taken serious to some degree but this movie went over the boundary line in that department. Critters 3 takes a break from the plot of the first two (Superman 3, anyone?) but that doesn't ruin the movie. In fact, the only returning character is Charlie. And folks, if you want to see this movie just because Leo Decaprio is in it then you are making a mistake. His acting is not enough to save this film. Anyway, one viewer pointed out some obvious plot holes such as Charlie becoming sheriff at the end of Critters 2 which is completely ignored in this movie. Come to think of it, I don't think Critters 3 even took place in Grover's Bend, Kansas (the same as the first two). Also, there were some critter eggs that just happen to appear under a man's truck that are unknowingly taken to an appartment complex in which later on the critters start to wreck havoc all over the place. Critters finishes with a ""to be continued"" ending. Critters 3 & 4 were filmed back to back just incase anyone was wondering though make no mistake... you really don't have to see this movie to understand what is happening in Crittes 4. Yes, that's right. As far as I'm concerend it would be better to go on to Critters 4 after watching Critters 2. Critters 3 is a direct-to-video film and for those who still want to see it, you will find out why.",1076112000,,1577,4.331081081081081

For the third film, ""Critter 3"" there were many changes.  Namely different hero, different setting, differnet production company, and a guarented sequel (this and part 4 were filmed back-to-back).  This film trys to have more comedy than the other films, which I hate to say doesn't really work well.

First off, there previously being way more Critters, thus making them feel like a much more powerful force, as well as scarier. Here we have like four, all of which are carbon copies of one another and don't display any real sense of personality. Second, this sequel has no scope. By that I mean, it was cool to see just HOW MANY people were affected by the Critters in the first two movies; the townspeople as well as the bounty hunters. Third, and probably worst of all, this sequel has NO bounty hunters! The bounty hunters were amazing in the first two movies because they brought a very heavy and cool sci-fi element to the films (as well as reveling in the very 80s fashions of the time), where as this movie just feels very basic and plain without them. It doesn't feel sci-fi in the LEAST, but just like your basic monster movie.

There is SOME attempt to build a good story, so not all is lost. That being, the relationship between Leo Dicaprio's ""Josh"" character, and the annoyed relationship he has with is father, as well as the regret he feels when his father is killed by the Critters (don't worry, it happens early so not really a spoiler). Furthermore, the character of Annie, played by Aimee Brooks is definitely the highlight of the film, as she also is having a rocky relationship with her father who has had difficulty readjusting after the death of his wife. She definitely does steal the show here.
Though Leo was always a good actor, even as a kid he was pretty good, Aimee Brooks does genuinely try harder, and she is not only absolutely ADORABLE (seriously, she's like the cutest thing), but her tough fighting but humble spirit does bring a much needed essence of charm to the drowning film. Most characters on the whole just annoy as she seems to be the only one that actually CARES about what's going on. Seriously if she wasn't there they'd all be dead. If anyone, the ""Charlie"" character (the only one returning from the previous films) does do a lot as well, BUT again, he isn't there nearly enough as we'd like.

There are some decent attempts at comedy, and the goofy soundtrack keeps the film from taking itself too seriously, but the move ultimately plays out like a very basic escape film with a surrounding cast that just isn't characterized ENOUGH for us to ever really care about them (minus Aimee Brooks). The Critters themselves are also too few in number, have animatronics that aren't done as well as the previous films, and feel more like a ripoff of the gremlins characters than anything else, thus taking away from their already established unique spirit. The pace is fast enough, and some of the actors do try, but they are also working with a script that doesn't give us the scope or real fears we are already used to in a Critters film. The movie is also advertised as a sort of ""Critters in the city,"" but it just being secluded to this ONE apartment building, housed with as little as like 7 people is just unrealistic. How much better would it have been to have seen the critters run amok in the city? Yet it's obvious the film's budge was never even close to handling that.

I'd say watch if you're already a Critters fan and have nothing else to watch :P  Still, this pales in comparison to the previous movies.",1441756800,,3422,4.541329011345219
