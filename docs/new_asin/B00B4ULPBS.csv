5555851,4,B00B4ULPBS,"Overall I found this to be a nice purchase; however, I was hoping for more information about when and why to use any adjustments at all. He does demonstrate adjustments on a variety of 'shapes' of people, but I feel having an overweight model would have been quite nice. Some of the adjustments didn't really get to the root of the issue in the postures. For example: when a taller person stands in a triangle pose with feet only slightly apart, the only way their bottom hand touches the ground is by rolling the top hip forward/toward the ground or rounding the spine. We could adjust all we want, but a more appropriate answer would be to ask the person to lift their head/shoulders/ hand higher for length in the spine, or spread their legs wider, which is typical of this type of standing posture anyway. Address the foundation of the posture first, and see if other things work themselves out.
If you are not at all familiar with hands-on adjustments, this DVD will still contain a lot of information for you and you may gain confidence in seeing them performed on students who are obviously familiar with the postures and work with the adjustments, rather than against them.",1375228800,2,1181,4.655502392344498
5555852,5,B00B4ULPBS,"Whether you are a teacher or a practitioner, this DVD is a MUST.  It is thorough and offers adjustments based on various body types and levels of practice.  For the teacher it gives you a wealth of information on how to approach a client, if at all.  As a practitioner it offers insight as to what you should be feeling and/or striving for in any given pose.  I'm also a personal trainer and have been able to apply some of these concepts to clients in a gym setting as well.  Get it - you won't regret it.",1375228800,,506,4.175257731958763
5555853,2,B00B4ULPBS,"Really basic, no A&P commentary as to ""why' no modified approaches, say if there are knee/hip/etc.. issues.. i returned it",1370995200,,122,5.15
5555854,5,B00B4ULPBS,"David brings an excellence to all his teaching which is unsurpassed; and his new adjustments DVD is no exception.  It will appeal to students and teachers of yoga asana who wish to develop their understanding of the body, its alignment and how to develop their own or their student's practice. It will also appeal to teachers who don't generally give hands-on adjustments, but who prefer verbal cuing, as an opportunity to learn where the attention, emphasis and energy needs to be in the body in order to progress deeper and further within a particular asana.

With the knowledge of the expert and skill of the master, David will guide you to a place of safe, confident adjusting that will enhance the experience of asana practice by bringing understanding of the functions and essence of the pose. He teaches how to enter a student's space in a manner that is respectful and safe. He teaches the why as well as the how of hands-on adjusting ~ the rationale behind the physiological manipulation. He provides safe adjustments for all levels of student and encourages recognition of individual anatomy and physiological biases. He emphasises the shared aspect of the adjustment experience i.e.: not doing the posture for the student, but facilitating physiological alignment by developing the student's internal awareness.

An excellent addition to the library shelves of all serious practitioners of yoga asana.",1368576000,,1412,5.130434782608695
5555855,5,B00B4ULPBS,Difficult to find material....well presented with differing body types to cover all asanas. This guy knows what he is doing.,1367020800,,124,5.25
5555856,5,B00B4ULPBS,"I just watched both DVDs back to back. I had never seen anything of this quality!

Not only does David show useful adjustments for a huge array of poses. He does so in different bodies so that you can see the nuances of what a good teacher would go through, need to think about, and navigate as he or she is helping.

In a way it is a much better product than any book out there that may show adjustments because of how interactive it is and the ample variety of examples for different circumstances.

Five students help David in the dynamic demonstrations: Marsha, Bob, Diana, Jarred and Amy.

The five of them vary greatly in level of flexibility and years of personal practice and they also have different heights and body types.  The adjustments come alive and resemble a real class.

Gretchen, David's wife, also appears in the second DVD to help with very advanced poses like Kapotasana, legs behind the head, etc.

The first thing that caught my attention upon receiving the Hands-On Adjustments DVD is the 11 points that can be seen on the inside cover and which pretty much summarize where the focus needs to go for any dedicated teacher when approaching something as personal, specific and delicate as an adjustment. It says:

Keys To Good Adjustments:
Observe the student
Be aware of your own bias
Create a clear intention
Ground the student
Feel and sense
Adapt to the moment
Adapt to the student
Move into the adjustment slowly
Create space and length
Use good body mechanics
Don't over adjust or adjust poses that you don't know

The DVD Feels more like a workshop:

It is a very dynamic proposal and you are even encouraged to work with a partner, matter of fact I grabbed James to start practicing some forward bend adjustments and it went pretty well.

So, what is David's definition of a correct adjustment?

""In broad terms a correct adjustment effectively fulfills the intention created by the adjuster based on their experience and the variables of the student""

David says he has taught this workshop many times and that one thing to be aware of is that sometimes participants get so caught up in the details of how to DO the adjustments,  that they forget to pay attention and actually feel what is happening WHILE doing the adjustment (my caps for emphasis).

Being in the moment, feeling what is happening is critical to a good adjustment.

What I get as the most important points from the opening talk is that you need to be:
Confident: (touch with the right amount of pressure),
Flexible: in the sense of adjusting yourself to what is actually happening in the moment.  Meaning: be present, pay attention.
Non-Bias: forget your own ideas about how a pose should look like because each student will have its own set of challenges, and always adapt, always consider age, injuries, flexibility stamina etc.
Have the right intention, are you going to be supporting? Grounding? Creating a new pattern? Teaching a technique?  Also, David says that if you are unsure, better to pass on an adjustment until you get to know a student and his or her practice better.

I have listed the poses that he goes through at the end of this review, you will see that there is a lot of work that went into it.  Just like in his Anatomy 2-set DVD, there is a lot of ground covered.

Throughout the presentation there are little boxes with reminders popping up, lines and animations alongside the student's bodies that show the intention and the direction of where you are aiming to direct the energy.  Every little detail helps and it all results in a magnificent learning experience.

On the second disk, shoulder stand gets a very small section, but the headstand gets some good suggestions for different body types and adjustments that range from entering the pose to exiting it.

The Section for Ashtangis:

The adjustments for the drop backs were a revelation to me, I am now determined to show this part to James so he can help me in the dropping back exactly as David shows it, which has two parts:

1- On the first drop back he helps the student all the way to the end and then he lets her drop for the last few inches, just so she gets the idea.
2.- She lets her drop for the first part and then ""catches"" her.

Loved these ideas!  I am very into the suggestion of letting the student (me) get the feeling of what the actual drop back feels like rather than being supported all the way.  I cannot wait unitl tomorrow's practice!

The section on kurmasana is particularly good.  He is of the idea of crossing the legs first, before clasping the hands behind the back.  You need to watch it, it will make a lot of sense.

The design of the cover has been done using soy ink so as to have less of an impact on the environment.  He thanks his teacher John Scott throughout as well as The Jois family, the students who helped him and his wife.

5555857,5,B00B4ULPBS,"At last a way to revisit Hands on Adjustments with David Keil!
Having participated in his workshops (a must if you can get a spot)I am very grateful that he has compiled
a set of two DVD's covering a variety of poses with a variety of body types.  A useful tool for teachers as well as practitioners.  This is the next best thing to being in a studio with David.  A must if you are ready to be hands on!",1363824000,,403,4.0125
5555858,5,B00B4ULPBS,"This DVD is an invaluable resource.  You will watch these over and over as there is so much information contained in this two DVD set.  Watch hit pause, review, repeat.

For the instructor you will refine your adjusting techniques and learn how to help students ""fix"" bad habits .  For the practitioner you will discover better self adjustments.  David's approach to adjusting is methodical.  His exceptional knowledge of anatomy shines through as you watch him adjust students of all body types and learn why he approaches each student as he does.  This DVD is great for taking notes, and you will!!!

I have taken several workshops with David.  This DVD is like being in a room with him.  Of course, I encourage you to take a workshop with David too.  The DVDs will improve you as instructor and a practitioner.  You will learn excellent tips, techniques and approaches.  It is tool you will use over an over.  It has helped me a lot!  Just buy it.  It is awesome!!!!",1363651200,,969,4.644970414201183
5555859,5,B00B4ULPBS,"Buy this DVD!  This DVD is a must for any teacher that loves assisting and adjusting the student.  Forget about the fact that David Keil is know for Ashtanga.  The knowledge and insight David brings with this DVD can apply to any yoga asana practice.  The information contained in these two DVDs is best absorbed over time.  I have taken David Keil's assisting and adjusting workshop (it was awesome).  These DVDs cover everything from the workshop and more!  Of course, a DVD is no substitute for the real thing.  However, it's sweet to have this as a resource :)",1363046400,3,564,4.626262626262626
5555860,5,B00B4ULPBS,"This DVD sat on my shelf for over 6 months and I finally had some time over vacation to watch it. I should've watched it earlier!!! It is an incredible resource of information and insight. If you are a yoga teacher and give hands-on adjustments to your students, this 2-disc DVD set is a must. Even if you are not teaching, David Keil will give you the insight to understanding the poses. Sometimes you need to spend money instead of watching free YouTube videos to have clarity.  All those YouTube videos and their conflicting information was overwhelming me. I watched many yoga practitioners on those videos who were a lot more flexible than I am and so their techniques didn't apply to me.  For each pose on the DVD, he shows you how to work the pose at different levels of proficiency and how to work where your body is currently at.

This DVD is set up for people with short attention spans like me, there is a menu of poses so that you can skip to the poses you're interested in.  There is a specific section for Ashtanga poses to address those poses we know and love (Marichya B, D, Kurmasana, Supta K, Pasana, Kapotasana,Pincha Mayurasana).",1376265600,5,1149,4.536231884057971
5555861,5,B00B4ULPBS,"Given the limitations of the format, I think David presents a good look at adjustments, using different bodies at different levels of ability to show how to deal with the variety of people that we come across, day to day, as teachers.
It would be impossible to cover the full range of modifications needed for every individual on a DVD as everybody is different, and to expect that would be unrealistic.  I don't get the impression that David is even attempting to offer a definitive and  complete guide to adjustment, rather a very useful learning resource that we can use to further our own development.
Certainly,a qualified teacher should already know the basic modifications for stiff hips/backs/necks etc.
It is clear that David teaches Astanga style yoga, and so he is adjusting asana achieved through that method, although the principles can apply across the board.
David clearly has an in-depth knowledge of anatomy which shines through.  One may not always agree with certain elements, as we all have our own take on a particular asana - that's the yoga of it! - but as a learning resource, this DVD would be a good investment, and I recommend it to any yoga teacher seeking to continue their learning journey.

David's Yoganatomy website and his regular newsletters offer a great forum for thought and discussion on asana and anatomy, I would recommend signing up to this too!",1375488000,2,1387,4.889361702127659
5555862,5,B00B4ULPBS,A proper understanding of how to adjust needs to adapt to the differences of every student. There's no one-way formula. David manages to give clear and thorough instructions with a vast array of levels of proficiency. Hands-on adjustments its'  must for every ashtanga teacher.,1375315200,,277,5.295454545454546
5555863,5,B00B4ULPBS,"As an instructor I've found this DVD to be a wonderful resource in helping me give better adjustments for the wide variety of students in my classes.  David's explanations are clear, accurate, & effective, based in anatomy & focused on needs/abilities of the students.  The 2-disc set covers adjustments for so many common hatha yoga postures, & I appreciate the bonus adjustments for some of the more difficult Ashtanga poses (my own practice).  VERY highly recommend this DVD set.",1375315200,,482,5.075949367088608
5555864,5,B00B4ULPBS,"The Hands-on Adjustments video from David Keil of Yoganatomy is a practical replacement for attending an adjustment workshop in person for those of us who cannot find the time to get to to one of David's presentations. I felt confident that the video would be good because I had learned much from his Yoganatomy videos a few years ago--a purchase that I would also recommend. However, I can imagine that a person who had been to a workshop would benefit from having this video to review the techniques from time to time.

As other reviewers have said, I gained special insight into the processes that David demonstrates with his assistants because they varied in flexibility and body type just as would be true of the people in most yoga classes. The video was thorough, David is engaging, and the intentions make the objectives clear.

I have felt lacking in my ability to adjust students, but my confidence has improved. I recommend this video to anyone who wants to develop adjustment skills.",1375228800,,995,4.812865497076023
5555865,5,B00B4ULPBS,"I find this DVD very useful, clearly presented, and overall an excellent resource.  Teaching for 14 years, it's great to return to thinking about WHY adjust, WHEN to adjust, and HOW to adjust a particular practitioner to best support their own growth.  A great reminder for all that it's about the student not the teacher.  Many teachers fall into habitual patterns of adjusting and this is a great refresher on looking at each student with fresh perspective on what's occurring within a posture, in a particular practice.  I think the DVD also demands ongoing practice on the part of teachers to integrate clean adjustments,  and that's what it's all about!",1375228800,,658,4.945454545454545
5555866,5,B00B4ULPBS,Very good teaching resource. I would definitely recommend this dvd to anyone in teacher training or first few years of yoga teaching.,1375228800,,133,5.090909090909091
5555867,5,B00B4ULPBS,"I've been to several of David's workshops and the DVD is still a useful tool, because he teaches you so much its hard to remember it all weeks/months later, despite many scribbled notes and dodgy stick figure drawings.  I liked the use of different bodies for modifications, etc.  It is all very clear and usable, with a large range of poses covered.  What's not to like?  I expected it to be good, and it is good, and I thoroughly recommend it.  I use many of these adjustments all the time, but more importantly I try to remember the principles of adjustment before I lay a hand on anyone, and the DVD covers these well too.",1375228800,,626,4.408695652173913
5555868,5,B00B4ULPBS,"I have been to two of David's workshops and learned so much from them, but I wished there was some way to keep a record of all I learned.

8562495,5,B00B4ULPBS,"As David says in the beginning, have a buddy, watch the adjustments, pause the DVD and practice performing the adjustments on each other. Give each other real feedback of how it feels.

Lots of great information, he goes through each pose with several (3-4) people of different body types.

I have had issues with the dvd not working in my dvd/blue ray player. It will randomly quit and I the function to go backwards and rewatch just 30 seconds does not work. I end up going back to the menu and rewatching the whole chapter/pose. I have not had any issues with other DVDs in my player.",1488585600,,587,4.4766355140186915
8562496,5,B00B4ULPBS,"I would highly recommend these DVD for beginners and intermediate practitioners. I suspect the advanced practitioners/teachers would benefit from watching them too.
