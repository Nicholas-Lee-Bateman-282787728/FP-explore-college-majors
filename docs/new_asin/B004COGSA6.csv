8423324,5,B004COGSA6,"We bought this dvd thinking it would have the best highlights of the 4 dvd s pictured in the cover and then we wouldnt need to purchase the individual dvd s.  How wrong we were!  The kids wanted every dvd shown so we started to collect them. I highly recommend this dvd along with Cow Toons for kids, SEA tunes for kids and Carribean and island tunes for kids.",1522454400,,360,4.202898550724638
