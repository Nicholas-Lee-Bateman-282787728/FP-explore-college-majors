3828929,2,B001XURJCS,"I have the DVD of Kellys Heroes and I could see almost no improvement on this ""Blue-Ray"" version.  What did they do, just put the dvd copy on a bluyray disc? It's disappointing. And I don't want to hear about how it's an old movie and that's the best it can be. Hell, movies like To Catch a Thief can be upgraded on DVD to look better than a lot of Bluerays, so there's no excuse. Where Eagles Dare is a noticeable improvement over the DVD and the only reason to get this.",1277596800,9,472,4.075268817204301
3828930,4,B001XURJCS,"Both of these movies are favorites in my WWII genre of films. I think the picture and sound on these blu rays are probably the best these films ever looked, especially on home video. I'm not quite old enogh to have seen these in the theater ( I'm 44 ), but I remember these on TV and VHS, Laser Disc.....If you are a fan then buy these they are at a good price.",1277596800,2,361,3.958904109589041
3828931,3,B001XURJCS,"I bought this Blu-ray for Where Eagles Dare, and had hopes for an improvement over the DVD version, which was already pretty good.  Sadly, during the transfer the brightness was turned down so low that much of the image is now lost in the shadows.  For example, many scenes are now so dark that you can't see the actor's faces.  In other cases, big items (like airplanes) are lost in the darkness of the mountain backgrounds.  This was not a problem on the DVD version.  It's especially regrettable since in the brighter scenes, the blu-ray does offer a sharp image.  I can only wonder if the person doing the transfer actually looked at the results.  (Note that another reviewer feels the brighter DVD image was a problem, and the darker blu-ray is more faithful to the original version shown in theaters 42 years ago.  I saw it back then, but make no claims to remember the brigtness level in the theater on that day so long ago.  Maybe others have a better ability to remember such things.)

UPDATE 6/18/10:  A commenter suggested I try altering my LCD video settings.  These settings work well for every other disc I own, plus OTA broadcast and streaming Netflix over Roku, but what the heck, I tried it.  I had to choose a setting with very, very high contrast and backlight levels, but it made a real difference.  The movie looked a lot better and the details became much more clear.  Was the result better than the DVD version (viewed with my regular LCD settings)?  To my eye, maybe it's a 5% or 10% improvement.  I wonder how or why the default settings are so dim on this BR disc?  Another reviewer (on blu-ray.com) had the same experience I did.  But I think if you really like the movie, it's probably worth getting the BR disc and turning up the brightness and contrast when you watch it.",1276214400,64,1801,4.520123839009288
3828932,3,B001XURJCS,"This is for the new blue-ray kelly's heroes, not the dvd.

3828933,5,B001XURJCS,"Clent in a war setting with a cast of wonderful characters. Where could you possably go wrong? Kelly's Heroes has been my all time best war movie ever since I first saw it back in 1969. I have owned it in Beta VHS, VHS, DVD and now BluRay. It never gets old. How about that Big Joe? Yes, I have nothing but positive vibes about this movie, but no, I am not a Republican. Woof, woof. Where Eagles Dare is just icing on the cake.",1275955200,3,427,4.035294117647059
3828934,5,B001XURJCS,"I became a fan of Clint Eastwood and grew to respect his integrity as a film maker because I was lucky enough to see his early films before the bigger budget blockbusters. That talent and taste, if you will, was evident right from the beginning, starting with the 'Man with no Name' trilogy which concluded with undeniably the best 'Western' of all time, ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."" Stolen by Eli Wallach's performance and Sergio Leone's inspired direction and that score!! You can't sing it, repeat it or buy it other than with the film, but that brilliant riff which was actually used as an homage in Kelly's Heroes is so memorable that you know it the second it begins. It has been copied and used many a time in films; proof that imitation is indeed the sincerest form of flattery.

After the spaghetti westerns, there are a number that aren't as well known but just as well done and entertaining. One of my favorites is ""Coogan's Bluff.""  Please watch it just for Eastwood's dry anachronistic character, a gentleman in the middle of the late-sixties New York City. It is hysterical and yet a great detective piece.  Keep going with ""Where Eagles Dare"" or ""Thunderbolt and Lightfoot.""  Consider that he did all these films while managing to do the first three Dirty Harry films is truly remarkable... I still haven't gotten to my favorite, ""Kelly's Heroes."" Forget any apologies or qualifications about comedic efforts or in which genre it belongs, ""Kelly's Heroes"" is one of the best war films of all time. No, that isn't an exaggeration from a die hard fan. It is just a basic conclusion from reasonable people who love movies that entertain and don't represent the celluloid product of a director's narcissistic obsession: himself.

There are indeed some good war films, and the best tend to dramatize the brutality and insanity of war. So when one takes a different route and exposes the greed and profiteering that happen in all conflict, and does so in a humorous way, should that somehow disqualify yhe film from consideration as a great or artistic work? Watch Kelly's Heroes again, or for the first time if you were one of those poor souls locked up in a Soviet Gulag in Siberia during the early seventies; which just so happened to be when they were all at full occupancy. Watch a movie that is beautifully produced with a score and cinematography that is nonpareil.

To such a beautifully looking and sounding work add Mr. Eastwood, Donald Sutherland in a hysterical performance as the anachronistic hippy tank commander, Telly Savalas as the perfectly cast master-seargent promoted to cat-hearder desperately trying to keep a misfit unit together, befuddled by Eastwood's brilliant but treasonous leadership, and a plot that is as insane as it is believable. Who wouldn't do what Kelley and his little band of heroic entrepreneurs did if given the same opportunity...

I'm not going to reveal any more of the story and spoil this movie for anyone who might have forgotten this gem of a film. If you ever find yourself stuck inside on a rainy Saturday or Sunday afternoon, grab a big bowl and the whole box of microwave popcorn. While those molecules start getting excited, your's should as well. That should give you enough energy to get the DVD and turn on the TV. As inspiration, we like to play 'Beat the Microwave Clock' in our house: Before the bag and popcorn acquire the color and consistency of charcoal, start the movie and while the endless, insanity-producing FBI warning and remote-disabling previews run on, sprint to the refrigerator, grab your beverage of choice, lots of paper towls and a big bowl. As rationalization for the buttery-flavored blends, you can subtract the calories you burn as you buzz through the house in ravenous anticipation. If you are really good or well-practiced, and the kitchen is on the same floor, you should be able to punch the microwave escape hatch before the buzzer sounds and you have to start looking for the step-stool so you can unplug all the smoke detectors...

The trick is remain calm and remember to grab the popcorn bag by the corners. Movies just aren't as much fun when you have to watch them with bandages on your hands and ringing in your ears.

Even if you burn the popcorn and your hands, I promise you will quickly forget as you become immersed in what is simply a great and thrilling story. What I can't guarantee is how your sides will feel after you spend the entire afternoon laughing...",1270771200,3,4480,4.777777777777778
3828935,5,B001XURJCS,"These two action-packed films from the late 60's, set in World War II, featuring Clint Eastwood, make a terrific double feature.  Packaging these MGM features together is a good value, and a great idea, as the films, both directed by Brian G. Hutton, kind of complement each other.  Each is an epic, set in the European theater, involving a covert operation behind enemy lines.  The missions however, are radically different, providing very contrasting views of the war.

A deadly serious espionage thriller, Where Eagles Dare (1968) features allied soldiers engaged in a top secret undercover mission, deep in the heart of the snow covered Bavarian Alps.  Also quite serious, but with numerous humorous elements, Kelly's Heroes (1970) is about a band of American soldiers making an unauthorized bid to steal Nazi gold.  Eastwood became an international star, in Sergio Leone's 'Man with No Name' spaghetti westerns, and interestingly, these films are the only ones (so far) that feature Eastwood as a participant in World War II.

Richard Burton was looking to do an action picture.  Author Alistair MacLean (The Guns of Navarone, Ice Station Zebra) was consulted, and Where Eagles Dare is what he came up with.  The noted author not only produced another thrilling novel, but wrote his first screenplay as well.

Burton plays British Major John Smith, the leader of a group British soldiers, disguised as members of the Germany army, on a top secret mission.  Also included in the group is Lt. Schaffer (Eastwood), an American.  As Ron Goodwin's magnificent theme builds in intensity, the film opens with the group aboard a plane, flying through a snowstorm, preparing to parachute drop at the Schloss Adler (The Castle of the Eagles), in Bavaria.  The unique and picturesque fortress, built on the top of a mountain, is typically accessible only by cable car.  Being held prisoner there, is General Carnaby, an American who must be rescued, before the Germans make him reveal vital secrets.

At 158 minutes, Where Eagles Dare is a long complicated journey.  There are some slow spots, but the film builds to a furious, action-packed finish.  With the help of Lt. Schaffer, and British agent Mary Elison (Mary Ure), Major Smith executes an elaborate scheme to obtain secret information.  When it is time to take their leave, Lt. Schaffer displays his deadly fighting skills.  There are many notable action scenes, including Smith's battle on the roof on the top of a cablecar.  Taking it on the run in a bus, the group engages in a frantic shootout with the pursuing Germans.

Including action sequences not present in the novel, adds to the film's length, but makes for a more cinematic and spectacular result.  It is commendable that the intricacies of MacLean's story were not sacrificed, to shorten the movie.  Both Burton and Eastwood bring guts and a ruthless toughness to their roles.  Derren Nesbitt and Anton Diffring, are quite colorful as members of the German army.  While Patrick Wymark and Michael Hordern, are deadly serious representatives of the British military.  Horror queen Ingrid Pitt, appears as a very helpful barmaid.  Featuring locations in Austria, the cinematography is dominated by snow covered settings.

Kelly's Heroes presents a radically different view of the war.  While second banana in Where Eagles Dare, Clint Eastwood is clearly the ringmaster in this wartime romp, that has a dynamite supporting cast.  Eastwood is Kelly, the de facto leader of a group of American soldiers, who are often assigned the dirty grunt work.  Their immediate commanding officer, Captain Maitland (Hal Buckley), is engaged in looting, so when Kelly and his group, learn about a cache of gold, they decide to do something for themselves, and go after it.  The fact that the gold is located in bank behind enemy lines, in the French village of Clermont, does not deter Kelly.  After convincing Big Joe (Telly Savalas) to join in the venture, Kelly gets intelligence reports and weapons from Crapgame (Don Rickles), and armored support from Oddball (Donald Sutherland) and his three Sherman tanks.

The complicity of various other units is required, and the coordination of these activities is part of the wacky fun.  Kelly's unauthorized operation comes to the attention of General Colt (Carroll O'Connor), who mistakenly believes that Kelly is spearheading an offensive.  O'Connor is marvelous, playing it to the hilt.  The light-hearted and chaotic tone of the mission, is counterbalanced by the danger posed by the German army, and matters become deadly serious as the group approaches their objective.  The fighting at Clermont is tight, and tension filled.  Featuring a tank battle between Sherman's and German Tigers.  In the end, it all comes down to money, and a business arrangement satisfactory to all is made.

Shot mainly in Yugoslavia, the film has a realistic look.  At 144 minutes, this is another epic adventure, but it is paced so well, that it seems much shorter.  The constant friction and banter throughout the film, between Crapgame, and Big Joe is hilarious.  Don Rickles has never been better.  Sutherland's hippie influenced portrayal of Oddball is from the wrong era, but seems like an absolutely perfect fit here.  Oddball's relationship with his tank driver Moriarty (Gavin MacLeod) is another comic gem.  Managing the madness is Kelly.  Perfectly calm in a crisis, there isn't a lot of depth to Eastwood's character, just an unfailing determination not to fail.  The film has a great cast, that also includes Jeff Morris, Dick Davalos, Stuart Margolin, Karl Otto Alberty, Len Lesser and David Hurst.  Extremely well-written by Troy Kennedy Martin, the film has marvelous character development, with tons of classic lines.  For a pure wartime caper film, with many terrific over the top performances, it is hard to top this hilarious masterpiece.

Warner Brothers previously released widescreen versions of these classics are good, but the Blu-ray editions are an improvement, particularly for Where Eagles Dare.  Both films are presented in true 16x9 format so there is more visible picture, and some subtitling now appears on the print, instead of only on the letterbox bars.  As with almost any Blu-ray disc, the viewing experience is best on a high definition, 1080p television.

Where Eagles Dare has many scenes featuring snow, resulting in a heavy emphasis on white and arctic blue colors.  The previous version of the film, featured rather dull colors, shaded towards gray.  The Blu-ray edition features a warmer color palette, where greens, reds, and browns in particular standout.  Combined with substantial improvements in resolution, the film has a brighter, fresher look, particularly for the interior shots, where warmer colors are prevalent.  Snow also seems brighter, and typically contrast looks improved, as in a scene where a helicopter lands in the castle, the previously flat looking mountains, now have texture, and new colors, and the (modern looking for the 1940's) helicopter looks more realistic in flight.  The enhanced picture quality, generally makes most of the numerous rear projection shots, look less realistic.

The Blu-ray version of Kelly's Heroes also has a warmer look, with the high definition of course being a plus, however the improvements to the look of the film, do not seem to be as dramatic.  Neither film had significant extras, or commentary tracks in the previous editions, and that unfortunately remains the case.

Those who own the previous versions of these films, particularly Where Eagles Dare, may want consider upgrading to Blu-ray.  The 16x9 presentation gives you the complete picture, and the improved colors and clarity, helps give these older films, a more vibrant look.",1270684800,14,7774,5.1737389911929546

WHERE EAGLES DARE is Alistair MacLeans Epic Adventure Story of a Wartime Mission That Cannot Succeed . . . But Dare Not Fail!

Double Bill Film Collection of action packed adventures set during World War Two. KELLYS HERO is a 1970 war comedy film directed by Brian G. Hutton about a group of World War II American soldiers who go AWOL to rob a bank behind enemy lines. The film stars Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Don Rickles, Carroll O'Connor, and Donald Sutherland, with secondary roles played by Harry Dean Stanton, Gavin MacLeod, and Stuart Margolin. The screenplay was written by British film and television writer Troy Kennedy Martin. The film was a US-Yugoslav co-production, filmed mainly in the Croat village of Viinada on the Istria peninsula.

WHERE EAGLES DARE is a British 1968 World War II action film starring Richard Burton, Clint Eastwood, Mary Ure, and Ingrid Pitt. It was again directed by Brian G. Hutton and shot on location in Austria and Bavaria. Alistair MacLean wrote the novel and the screenplay at the same time and it was his first screenplay; especially for both film and book and became a massive commercial success.

KELLYS HERO FILM FACT: The project was announced by M-G-M in November 1968 under the title of The Warriors. George Kennedy turned down a role despite an offered fee of $300,000 because he did not like the part. The film was going to have a female role, but prior to filming, it was cut from the script. Ingrid Pitt, who was cast in the role and had been in the film Where Eagles Dare with Clint Eastwood the previous year, revealed that Ingrid Pitt was ""virtually climbing on board the plane bound for Yugoslavia when word came through that my part had been cut. KELLYS HERO was shot on location in the Istrian village of Viinada in the Croatia (former Yugoslavia) and London. Yugoslavia was chosen mostly because earnings from previous showings of films there could not be taken out of the country, but could be used to fund the production. Another reason Yugoslavia was selected was that in 1969, Yugoslavia was one of the few nations whose army was still equipped with operating World War II mechanised German and American equipment, this simplified logistics tremendously. Approximately 20 minutes were cut from the film by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer before theatrical release. Clint Eastwood said later in interviews that he was very disappointed about the re-cut by M-G-M because he felt that many of the deleted scenes not only gave depth to the characters, but also made the film much better. John Landis was a production assistant on this filmand also appears as an extra as one of the three nuns.

WHERE EAGLES DARE FILM FACT: Awards and Nominations: 1970 Laurel Awards: Nominated: Best Action Drama [4th place] and Nominated: Best Action Performance for Clint Eastwood [4th place]. 1985 Huabiao Film Awards: Win: Outstanding Translated Foreign Film.  The film WHERE EAGLES DARE involved some of the top moviemaking professionals of the time and is considered a classic. Major contributors included Hollywood stuntman Yakima Canutt, who as second-unit director shot most of the action scenes; British stuntman Alf Joint who doubled for Burton in such sequences as the fight on top of the cable car; award-winning conductor and composer Ron Goodwin, who wrote the film score; and future Oscar-nominee Arthur Ibbetson, who worked on its Cinematography. The film is noted for the phrase ""Broadsword calling Danny Boy,"" that was used by Richard Burton several times throughout the film. WHERE EAGLES DARE includes many historical errors, plot holes and anachronisms. For example, a helicopter, that was actually an American Bell 47 that entered U.S. military service in 1946, is seen at the start of the film. The Luftwaffe did not have an abundance of helicopters able to fly the high-ranking general from Berlin to Bavaria, as is evidenced by the dialogue in the film. Other scenes in WHERE EAGLES DARE were filmed at the M-G-M-British Studios, Borehamwood, England; filmed in spring 1968.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: KELLYS HERO [1970] is a very funny and hilarious tongue in cheek film. From the very beginning, when we meet our bombarded, desperate and dishevelled platoon of soldiers, we get comedy moments that had me laughing straight away and effectively set the tone for the film. This wasn't going to be a film where it made light of the war. Instead it would be a film where it highlighted the chaotic and farcical side of the war and it picked incredible actors to do it.

The story isn't exactly original; but it is one that has been done loads of times before, as a small group of soldiers decide to go in search of Nazi Gold. Clint Eastwoods Lieutenant Kelly leads these soldiers but soon realises it won't be as discreet as easy as hed hoped as the gold is behind enemy lines and the amount of soldiers finding out about the heist keeps growing. It becomes a film of two parts. The first part being the planning and getting to the small village where the gold is being kept, which is where we get the great introduction to each character and we slowly see Lieutenant Kellys well-thought out plan falling apart around him. The second part is the execution of the plan and the taking of the gold in a Nazi occupied village. It gives the film the perfect blend of tension, humour and most importantly for a war film, action. In fact I was really impressed with the action moments, not really suffering considering the age of the film.

The film KELLYS HERO is humorous, lively, and entertaining picture could be described as a caper film set against a WWII backdrop. Lieutenant Kelly [Clint Eastwood] is an atypical Army man who, while boozing with a captured German general, learns of $16 million worth of gold bars behind enemy lines and sets the heist in motion, blazing a trail of destruction on route, backed by a wonderfully colourful cast of characters that includes Donald Sutherland as the appropriately named Oddball, a hippie tank driver; Don Rickles as Crapgame, a hustler and arms supplier; Telly Savalas as the sceptical Sergeant Big Joe who goes along for the ride; and Carroll O'Connor as the egotistical General Colt, who is glad to be mistaken for General  Eisenhower. The film's most memorable moments are the destruction of railroad station, to the tune of ""I've Been Working on the Railroad,"" and the spoof of the spaghetti western musical scores of Ennio Morricone as Lieutenant Kelly and cohorts prepare for a showdown with a Panzer tank which is totally brilliant. But the only slight negative stance I have is with the actor Donald Sutherland, who has the most irritating, and horrible accent I have ever encountered and the way he speaks you sometimes could not understand what he was saying and how ever did the director allow this ghastly and very horrible situation to arise. Also deserving mention is the Director of Photography Gabriel Figueroa Mateos, who is the veteran Mexican Cinematographer who worked extensively with Luis Bunuel and Emilio Fernandez did a brilliant job.

WHERE EAGLES DARE [1968] Here we find Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood on a mission to infiltrate the most inaccessible fortress in the world to rescue an important American general right from under the noses of the Germans. What they and the audience don't suspect is the number of twists and turns this highly thrilling film will take. As a straight adventure the premise of Allied agents springing a general who holds vital war secrets is an exciting one. But director Brian G Hutton sticks closely to Alistair MacLean's original script, which is laden with double-crossing and unexpected adversities. This combined with epic production values and a rousing orchestral score produces a fantastic sense of adventure.

Clint Eastwood sums it up perfectly when he turns to Richard Burton and says ""Major, you got me as confused as I'll ever be."" Him and the audience both, as right from the beginning the mission is thrown into doubt with the killing of an Allied agent under suspicious circumstances. Woven into this complex mesh is an abundance of exciting action sequences with parachute jumps, an escape on motorbike, the rigging of bombs and the constant threat of discovery. As if all that wasn't enough, Clint Eastwood and Richard Burton have to get up to the Schloss Adler fortress by cable car but typically not by conventional means. And waiting for them on arrival is a complex rabbit warren of German soldiers and deceit. Perhaps the most impressive aspect of it all is the facts that while this film promises so much, it delivers so much more. But Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood are there to save the day. The grizzled veteran and up-and-coming star are cool under pressure, red hot in the fire fights and indefatigable when it comes to completing their mission. One wise old eagle, one young eagle, both full of vigorous daring do.

Alistair MacLean doesn't let logic get in the way of a good action sequence, as when the heroes drag prisoners with them when attempting a narrow escape. The choice defies logic, but allows for an exciting cable car action sequence. Director Brian G. Hutton directs with a workmanlike efficiency that, to modern tastes, can be plodding at times, especially at 155 minutes, but there is a methodology at work as the slow first half lays the groundwork for a more explosive second half of the film.

What was most memorable about WHERE EAGLES DARE, aside from its build up with the behind-enemy-lines action, it is Alistair MacLean's treatment of what initially seems like a standard-issue daring-mission adventure; almost immediately, the plot expectations set by the film-opening of the stiff-upper-lip briefing by British officers, and the challenges only become more baffling at times until it is time for the unequivocal fist-fighting and explosions near the end of the film. Since there's nothing consequential here, Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood could have played these roles in their sleep, but it is the novelty of seeing these acting-legends of Richard  Burton play against the rising star at the time Clint Eastwood, fresh from his spaghetti-western fame.

So all in all I love the dramatic ending of this World War II film which is one of the great cinematic moments of all time, especially as all the spying and infamous intrigue come together and of course it is a very great entertaining film all round. On top of all that what also enhances this film is the composer Ron Goodwin who scored over 70 films during a fifty year career, and gives us arguably his most memorable one here and especially when as we get into the start of the film where the music score seems to lift us up to that high alpine village, to draw our eyes up to that mountaintop castle with its cable car and to worry our nerves like an ever-present threat of being captured or killed. It is a totally simple military-sounding theme with variations that run throughout the entire film and its made up of an orchestra of quivering strings, rolling drums and soaring brass. Theres no doubt it intensifies ones enjoyment and adds mood to the scenes, especially towards the end of the film.

The transfer has been printed fairly dark so colours do not really have a chance to pop out of the screen, but exception comes from the Metrocolor reds of the main titles for WHERE EAGLES DARE. Flesh tones as in the previous film have a rather ruddy appearance, but sharpness is excellent and detail is solid throughout. Black levels are good without being great, but shadow detail can be very impressive on occasion with either film. But overall the presentation for both films are well catered for the image presentation, especially for the age of both films and especially the fact that Metrocolor in my mind a slightly inferior colour process.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Warner Home Video films KELLYS HERO + WHERE EAGLES DARE have at last an equally stunning in the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound mix presentation for both films, and especially that this is not really a modern surround audio track. With both films there are the occasional sounds emanating from the rear speakers with the well-defined composed film music, especially with the vocals on the soundtrack, but most of the sound activity is generated across the front channels, and sometimes stays mostly anchored with the front channels, so all in all it varies. Occasionally the music cue and for instance some gust of wind do generate some rear channel activity, but at other times during the film, those same cues find the rears notably silent. With all of the explosions and gunfire throughout both films, one would expect more from the different channels, but again it is only has sporadic use. Otherwise, the sound elements in both films are mixed together so much better and the dynamic range is fuller, which you did not get on the inferior DVD release. Considering the age of both films, the sound has been greatly improved over the inferior DVD release and fans like me, who thoroughly enjoyed the dramatic sound experience with both of these brilliant classic World War II films.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Theatrical Trailer [1970] [1080i] [1.78:1] [2:49] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film KELLYS HERO, what a shame it could not of been shown in its proper aspect ratio.

Special Feature: On Location: WHERE EAGLES DARE [Vintage Feature] [1968] [480i] [1.33:1] [12:37] This documentary is a behind-the-scenes look at the difficulties of shooting a film on location in the Austrian Alps for the filming of WHERE EAGLES DARE [1968] film starring Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood. Here we have the Nazi era of Austria during WWII and is recreated that evokes strong emotion among the current residents, many of whom are extras in the film. It is a difficult shoot and almost considered impossible, especially if only because of the very harsh winter weather and the rugged terrain of the Alps. Planning the scenes was very important, because often only one take was possible. To some of the filmmakers, it almost felt like they are on a war planning. The film itself has special meaning for one of its stars, German Ingrid Pitt, since she is a recent escapee from East Germany. Ingrid Pitt describes Richard Burton and Mary Ure as English, this is of course incorrect, because Richard Burton was actually born in Wales and Mary Ure was born in Scotland. Contributors include Clint Eastwood, Richard Burton, Ingrid Pitt, Mary Ure, Brian G. Hutton and Elizabeth Taylor.

Theatrical Trailer [1968] [1080i] [2.40:1] [2:20] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film WHERE EAGLES DARE. Despite the poor quality of the image, it is still a great presentation

Finally, KELLYS HERO [1970] has great actors, a great story and is a very funny war film without being carry on soldier. Clint Eastwood is fantastic as the hard faced Private Kelly. It doesnt stray away from the fact that it is a film about a horrific event in the history of World War II, but instead uses it to help tell a totally farcical over the top but enjoyable story. But with the film WHERE EAGLES DARE [1968] that was written by Alistair MacLean and who also wrote the original screenplay which was treated with total respect for the writer Alistair MacLean unusual abilities as a  master of action packed and full on edge of your seat suspense. The resulting film is highly entertaining, thrilling and rarely lets you down at any moment throughout the film. For me, there is much to like about this Alistair MacLean written yarn, hence that is why I have viewed it as many times as I have and it is clear that I am not the only one who is a big fan of this World War II film. Theres an unofficial website for the film on which I have just read where director Steven Spielberg admitted in a Channel 4 survey of the top 100 war films that this is one of his favourite film. Meanwhile, the original impetus for the project helped boost Richard Burton's previously sagging career. WHERE EAGLES DARE was a bright spot for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1969, at a time when the studio's very future was gravely in question. In the end, the personal risks paid off really well at the box office as WHERE EAGLES DARE was a huge popular hit with audiences after the March 1969 national release. Highly Recommended!

The production values are high.  The wonderful actual WWII equipment provided by the Yugoslavian Army, for the movie (it was what they used when the movie was made) is a real treat for WWII aficionados.  I doubt there has ever been this much authentic, operational equipment in another movie.

Where Eagles Dare is just OK.  Richard Burton seems uncomfortable and out of place.  It's a movie for very occasional watching.",1487808000,,589,4.752475247524752

3828955,5,B001XURJCS,"Kelly's Heroes is a silly, fun, action packed treasure hunt set In World War 2 and Where Eagles Dare is a more serious action thriller set in the snowy mountains of the Alps. I prefer Where Eagles Dare overall as it features some impressive locations, great action scenes and it has inspired countless movies and video games through the years (the Wolfenstein series being a big one). These Blu-ray transfers are alright for the price, but I can't help but think there is a better version of Where Eagles Dare out there somewhere. When comparing WED to the Connery era James Bond Blu-rays I own, the Bond films are brighter, crisper and much more vivid overall. While crisp and definitely mastered in high def, WED is rather dark and somewhat washed out, which is a shame because the snowy Alpine settings in the film are spectacular.

If you love Clint Eastwood, his movies, and some of the other actors involved you will thoroughly enjoy both of these movies!
They are both set in the WWII era timeframe. My eyes were glued to the screen when watching these.

~ Look for the beautiful Ingrid Pitt (Countess Dracula, The Vampire Lovers, The House That Dripped Blood) in ""Where Eagles Dare"".
Both movies have superb sound and picture quality now. DTS HD 5.1 English Audio with lots of subtitles in various languages.

Both movies played fine on my 42"" Samsung. Not the best transfer I've ever seen, but Kelly's looked noticably better than my old DVD copy. Eagles was murky in some spots, and got worse in the second half. Tweaking the dynamic contrast helped a lot. Overall, though, pretty decent pix quality - but it's probably not going to look very good on larger HDTVs.

Since this isn't a true HD disc, I was tempted to subtract one star. But, when you look at price, playability, and content, it's hard to pick that nit. Go ahead and pull the trigger - you know you want 'em.",1411084800,,827,4.294871794871795

3829099,3,B001XURJCS,"Considering the under-$10 price, this Double Feature Blu-Ray is a reasonable value, with one caveat: the film prints that were used to produce this transfer to BluRay were in only ""fair"" condition, and the technician that made the transfer didn't set up the equipment properly.
1. ""Kelly's Heroes"" on this disc isn't too bad; the film is somewhat grainy and the contrast and color are somewhat dulled by time, but at least the gamma and brightness levels are okay. However, I have seen DVD's and BluRays of many other movies from the 60's and 70's that have much better color and overall image quality than this. Perhaps the original master film of the movie is no longer in existence, or wasn't made available for this BD transfer, anyway, it looks like this BluRay transfer was made from a very old positive print that was not stored in archival conditions. I don't see that any effort was made to re-master the film or clean it up.
2. ""Where Eagles Dare"" is in significantly worse condition than Kelly's Heroes. The image is so dark that night time scenes are virtually black. In order to actually watch the movie, I had to crank up the brightness and contrast by about 1.5x, and that doesn't exactly help the color saturation and clarity.  These are both good WWII action films with stellar casts, it's just a shame that the producers of this BluRay didn't put a little more effort into making a really clean film-to-digital transfer using better quality source material.  My DVD's and BluRay discs of ""Mutiny on the Bounty (1962)"", ""Mary Poppins (1964)"", ""The Sound of Music (1965)"", ""Blazing Saddles (1974)"", ""2001-A Space Odyssey (1968)"", and ""Fiddler on the Roof (1971)"" are all from movies made 40 to 50 years ago, and they look just as crisp and clean, with eye-popping color, as they did in the theater when I first saw them as a kid.  So it is possible to make great looking transfers from 35mm movie film to video disc, but unfortunately this BluRay isn't one of them.

SUMMARY: If you love these two films, and don't already have them on DVD, this BluRay is a reasonably priced alternative, but image quality of this transfer is so poor that if you already have a DVD, or even a VHS tape that is in good condition, you might want to skip this BluRay.",1389139200,11,2264,4.638403990024938

3829102,4,B001XURJCS,"For my reviews of this Blu-ray Clint Eastwood World War II double feature, I'll do them in chronological order.

WHERE EAGLES DARE is based on the Alistair MacLean novel and stars Richard Burton, Clint Eastwood. and Mary Ure (Mrs. Robert Shaw). It was directed by Brian Hutton.
Unlike THE GUNS OF NAVARONE, a previous World War II movie based on an Alistair MacLean novel, WHERE EAGLES DARE is less character-driven and, instead, places a greater emphasis on action, explosions and a whopping body count---Burton and Eastwood seemingly kill half the Vermacht in this movie.
I saw the movie several times and didn't like one unbelievable part of the movie in which captured American Brig. General Cartwright Jones, who has knowledge of the upcoming D-Day invasion, is being impersonated by a lowly GI who was a second-rate actor before the war. I later found out that this was based on true stories---British soldier M.E. Clifton James was asked by David Niven (who starred in THE GUNS OF NAVARONE) to be a double for Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery to deceive the Germans. This led to the biomovie I WAS MONTY'S DOUBLE. A second British soldier, Keith Deamer Banwell, also was a double for Montgomery.
There are few mistakes in this movie. The Germans use a helicopter (in fact, German helicopters were only prototypes and were never operational). Also, when the British commandos parachute into Nazi territory, in one scene it's overcast with heavy snow and then the sky is clear with no snow and then returns to heavy snow. This a huge continuity mistake.
Overall, WHERE EAGLES DARE is a very good action movie with lots of shooting, explosions,and high body count of German soldiers----bu this not as interesting and absorbing as THE GUNS OF NAVARONE.

The second movie in this Blu-ray set is KELLY'S HEROES which also starred Clint Eastwood and was directed by Brian Hutton who also directed WHERE EAGLES DARE. The script was written by Troy Kennedy-Martin who also wrote the original classic heist movie THE ITALIAN JOB starring Michael Caine. Other members of this star-studded cast include Telly Savalas (KOJAK, THE DIRTY DOZEN), Donald Sutherland (MASH, THE DIRTY DOZEN), Carroll O'Connor (ALL IN THE FAMILY), Gavin MacLeod (THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW, THE LOVE BOAT), Don Rickles (RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP), Stuart Margolin (THE ROCKFORD FILES),  Perry Lopez (CHINATOWN), Harry Dean Stanton (ALIEN), Len Lesser (SEINFELD) and George Savalas (younger brother of Telly Savalas who co-starred with Telly on KOJAK)  Also, Yves Montand has an uncredited cameo has the SS commander who is gunned down by Eastwood, and director John Landis (TRADING PLACES, NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE) has an uncredited cameo as a nun.
KELLY'S HEROES is a bank heist movie set in World War II with anti-war overtones since this movie was filmed during the Vietnam War. It was filmed in Yugoslavia because of the abundance of US and Soviet war equipment (the M4 Sherman tanks are real and the German Tiger I tank is a modified Soviet T34 tank).
On the limited edition soundtrack cd, there is a romantic female vocal ""Si Tu Me Dis"" which struck me as odd since there are no women in the cast and no romantic scenes. However, I later found out that Ingrid Pitt, who co-starred in WHERE EAGLES DARE as a British undercover agent and became famous as a Hammer Films vampiress (THE VAMPIRE LOVERS), was supposed to co-star in KELLY'S HEROES, but she was about to fly to Yugoslavia to start filming when she was told her part had been removed from the movie.
The music from KELLY'S HEROES includes the popular title vocal ""Burning Bridges"" by Mike Curb, the future lieutenant governor of California. ""All for the Love of Sunshine"" is the vocal which was the first #1 country hit for Hank Williams, Jr. and is used in the Sherman attack on the German rail yard. The score was written by Lalo Schifrin, who also wrote the score for Eastwood's DIRTY HARRY and also MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, MANNIX. Schifrin also includes a musical parody of Ennio Morricone's music in the parody scene of Eastwood's THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY with Eastwood, Savalas and Sutherland approaching a Tiger I tank.
One interesting bit about this movie is that director Brian Hutton supposedly left the movie business after KELLY'S HEROES and became a New York plumber. However, I read an article several years ago in which the author met Hutton, who was a friend of a friend, and learned that Hutton left Hollywood to become very successful in real estate.
The movie's individual scenes are very entertaining---the comedy scenes are funny and the combat scenes, particular the tank combat scenes, are very impressive. However, the overall movie seems to be missing something. Eastwood has said some key scenes which would reinforce the characters and the anti-war theme were removed, so maybe those deleted scenes would have helped the movie.

For both movies, the Blu-ray video quality is fairly good, but are not  major improvements over the dvd versions,The special features are skimpy---for WHERE EAGLES DARE, there is ON LOCATION: WHERE EAGLES DARE and a trailer. For KELLY'S HEROES, there is only a trailer which is very disappointing---I would have loved commentaries by surviving members of the cast including Eastwood, Sutherland, Rickles, MacLeod, Margolin, et al.

In the days of NO CGI they had to actually blow things up. Great job by the crew! Stunning panoramas, and beautiful European venues make this an awesome adventure.
As far as Kelly's heroes is concerned: It's a rollicking fun fest of crazy GI's having a moment of sanity when they decide to steal a ton of Nazi gold from a bank in Belgium. The film was done in I think, the Czech Republic prior to the Commies falling, so, there was a lot of authentic WWII damage (Well, the Commies are good for something at least. They can't do anything right, and so we were able to have a place for authentic WWII movie making.) Enjoy the hard work of the actors and Crew.

3829122,5,B001XURJCS,"I remember seeing ""Where Eagles Dare"" in a movie theater in Phoenix, AZ, when we were vacationing and visiting relatives who lived there. Being a 5th grader at the time, the violence, fake blood and people getting shot in the forehead - or getting a pick ax in the arm - was ""cool."" I was swept away by the story at the time, never noticing how unbelievably contrived the whole plot was, even for those willing to suspend disbelief for a couple of hours.

Revisiting the full film after all these years (it's been on TV thousands of times in cut-up versions), it actually flows better than I remember. I'm more appreciative of the scenes that act to break the tension in what is basically an action flick with an interesting (contrived?) and twisting plot, the height of which has to be Richard Burton's scene where he explains who he is - or isn't - to the German brass holding court in the eagle's nest. Alastair McLean's plot falls apart if a single scene of his highly inventive story doesn't happen at precisely the time with precisely the outcome as happens in the film. Luckily, he's got Richard Burton overplaying many of his scenes, and that tends to distract from the machinations of the plot.

The film's biggest drawback, though, is the tedious and repetitive musical score by Ron Goodwin. Yikes! Sequence after sequence of rising pitch that leads nowhere, the score consists of three musical themes that are used and reused to the point of absurdity. Ghastly stuff.

Still, the film is highly entertaining if one can get past the musical score.

""Kelly's Heroes"" is even more unbelievable plot-wise and character-wise than is WED, no more so than in the character essayed by Donald Sutherland, who plays a hippie/beatnik dropped into a WWII setting. It. Is. Strange! But then, KH is a comedy, while WED is not.

Clint Eastwood gives an enjoyable performance in this film, and in WED, as well. It's reassuring to see old ""Squint"" proving that he could once act, stealing scenes with a minimum of effort. These are performances that showcase this actor at his best mid-career...which is a real tonic to his most-recent gig as an angry old white guy yelling at an empty chair. There are also great performances by Telly Savalas and Don Rickles in KH, and the rest of the cast is ideal.

In addition to both films featuring Clint Eastwood in a leading role, both films were directed by Brian G. Hutton

The BD transfers are quite good, especially of WED, which is a very dark film and which usually comes off as an indistinct blur when played on TV. The BD has about as much clarity and contrast as one could hope for in a film that rarely (if ever) sees daylight. Picture quality is very good in KH, but I felt that the soundtrack got saturated at certain points.

Kelly's Heroes is about a group of GIs in France who find out about 16 million in German gold storied 30 miles behind enemy lines, and decided to go after it themselves. Not only is it interesting, but it has an all-star cast from A to Z. There is a lot of humor in the film, including a truly unique performance from Donald Sutherland, and a lot of chuckles from Don Rickles.

The presentation on this blu-ray looks great. I could swear that there are clips around the edges of scenes, if not entire scenes, that I've never seen before. That was a treat. The audio is solid, if not spectacular. All in all, this is the best I've ever seen this movie look.

Where Eagles Dare is an adaptation of an Alistair McClain novel about a counter-spy/commando mission into the heartland of Germany in advance of D-Day. Clint Eastwood and Richard Burton are the big draws here, and they deliver. It is another film I have watched many times, and it always entertains.

Another reviewer here claimed that this presentation of the film was too dark to watch. We didn't find that to be the case at all, and I think he should examine his picture settings. The movie is indeed dark ... much of it takes places out of doors at night, and in a dimly lit castle. However, we had no problem clearly seeing the details in every scene.

The original used for this transfer wasn't in as good condition as the one for Kelly's Heroes. While easily the equal of any time I've scene it on TV, this presentation is no improvement either. Much of the film is grainy, and that is possibly because it was shot in dim conditions. The cinematographer may have used a faster speed film, which would introduce a lot more grain into the finished product. Still, you have the picture in widescreen presentation, which you may have never seen before.

Especially at the price, this is an outstanding value for blu-rays of two outstanding films.

Highly recommended.",1334966400,2,2121,4.565789473684211

Kelly's Heroes is one of Eastwood's best, right up there with his westerns. It's my all time favorite WWII movie like the Good, the Bad and the Ugly is my all time favorite western.

3829139,5,B001XURJCS,"Where Eagles Dare is one of the classic action films of the 1960s (or any decade.)  This film cries out for a doubledisk re-release with retrospectives, commentaries, etc.  Instead Warner Bros. has released it on DVD and blu-ray with only  1  trailer and 1 vintage documentary. They keep releasing it as one of their Clint Eastwood collection.  However, make no mistake about it: this is Richard Burton's film and he is absolutely terrific in it.  Clint does have a few good lines, (actually his best line is nonchalantly saying ""hello"" to each German he runs into before blowing them away,) and he is great in the action sequences.  But this is really Burton's film.  Now regarding the lack of any special features or retrospectives, it is true that, with the exception of Eastwood, most of the cast members (Burton, Mary Ure and sadly the recently deceased Ingrid Pitt, one of the most luscious women ever,) have passed away.  However Cinema Retro magazine recently did a full magazine retrospective on this classic film.  They found enough people to interview, why can't Warner Bros?
Despite Where Eagles Dare being the better film, the film gets 2nd feature status to Kelly's Heroes.  Perhaps this is due to Kelly's Heroes being a legitimate Eastwood starrer.  However he is supported by an outstanding supporting cast, especially Telly Savalas, great as ""Big Joe,"" Don Rickles as the hustler supply sergeant ""Crapgame"" and Donald Sutherland as the anachronistic hippie tank commander with the appropriate name of ""Oddball.""  Other terrific support comes from, among others, Carroll O'Connor, Gavin MacLeod,Stuart Margolin, etc. etc.  Like Where Eagles Dare, the action scenes in this film are massive.  Both were directed by Brian G. Hutton, a terrific action director, (based on these films,) who seems to have dropped off  the map.  (There is some indication in the Where Eagles Dare retrospective magazine that he was last working as a plumber!!!  I don't know for sure if this is true.)  I always enjoy the dialogue in Kelly's Heroes.  (Savalas' ""Big Joe"" constantly referring to a whiney member of the squad as ""Barbara"" despite his constantly being told that the little soldier's name is ""Babara"" never fails to crack me up.)  Kelly's Heroes is a very amusing film with some outstanding action scenes.  This also could use a nice retrospective and unlike Where Eagles Dare, many of the cast members, (Eastwood,Rickles, Sutherland,MacLeod,Margolin, Harry Dean Stanton, etc.) are still with us. Warner Bros. gives us nothing extra with Kelly's Heroes other than the trailer.
Perhaps it is because these films were originally made by MGM that Warner Bros. treats them as unwanted stepchildren.  However both of these films are well-remembered action films and Where Eagles Dare, (screenplay by Alistair MacLean, the top adventure novelist of the '50s and '60s, the man also responsible for The Guns of Navarone and Ice Station Zebra,) is a genuine classic.  Both of these films deserve better blu-ray releases than Warner Bros. has given them. (By the way, picture and sound quality are okay.)",1295568000,3,3101,5.107142857142857
3829140,4,B001XURJCS,"I brought this set only for the movie Where Eagles Dare. I watched Kelly's Heroes once and gave it away. I guess the beauty is in the eyes of the beholder because I thought both movies were pretty well presented on my HDTV. But I owned a 40 inch Sony Bravia and both movies look very good. I took Where Eagles Dare to a friend's place and watch it on his 52 inch Samsung, the movie quality look more disappointing. I guess the old wisdom was right, bigger the HDTV you got, more flaws you will see. That is probably way I ignored many blu ray reviews watched by these critics who owned 60 inch top of the line since its perfection or bust. Smaller TV is more forgiving.

There should be no need to rehashed the quality of this movie overall. Where Eagles Dare is still one of my favorite action flicks and I saw this movie originally in the movie theater when it first came out. When I used to played the old MSDOS Wolfenstein 3D games, that took me back to this movie every single time. I read in one interview that original developers of first person shooter games got their inspiration from this movie. True or false...I don't know but I can understand it if so. Great movie to watch as you see Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood depopulating the German population during World War II.",1294358400,4,1287,4.3625

Once in a while the inheritors of the MGM film library forget to do a proper research of the theatrical prints used for movies. We can see a clear example in all of the MGM cartoons for Tom & Jerry, where the soundtrack is subpar compared to the original tracks, and on many occasions the shorts were cut and never re-edited to their original content.

Sadly, this is the case with these two BD-V discs, and all of a sudden we miss the chance to see those movies exactly as they were shown in the 70 mm theaters.",1280016000,17,703,4.52755905511811

3829149,5,B001XURJCS,"First the real question.  The transfers are pristine and look great.  The sound is much better on both this go round.  Worth the upgrade?  Yes, definitely.

The movies themselves are really trend setters for their time and tho Kelly's Heroes is the more dated of the two (ironically mainly because of the studio's attempt to update it to a sixtie's teen audience despite it's WWII movie status)...it's still worth a soda and a box of popcorn (and that'll pay for them right there!) to hear Donald Sutherland say ""Stop making with the negative waves...Man""...as he manages to slip some sixties love generation comic relief into the proceedings  (his appearance as the visiting General thorn in Robert Ryan's side in The Dirty Dozen is almost as hilarious and helped Sutherland rock the 60's at the movie theater leading up to the seminal MASH in 1970).  Heroes is a solid heist caper set in the middle of Wartime which makes it oddball enough -even for then.  The motley crew featuring Don Rickles in his first 'close to persona' appearance post his Beach Party epics, are savvy acting vets and deliver the goods.  Particularly the Nazi Tank Commander to whom they eventually spread their gold fever.  One other appearance of note is an early Carroll O'Conner comic gem as a Give 'Em Hell General that displayed his flair before Archie Bunker immortalized him.  All in all a very satisfying movie from an era that turned out too many psychedelic wrecks attempting to capture the times.  These guys reflected it perfectly and did it in a WWII vehicle long before Hawkeye and Pierce...go figure!!!

Where Eagle's Dare is really a ride along for Clint Eastwood who had just achieved his superstar status prior to this one's release, so even tho it's always been billed since it's original run as a Clint Eastwood movie it's really Richard Burton's show all the way.  It was his first and only attempt to forge himself into an Action/Adventure leading man and he succeeds admirably.  Heaven (and Elizabeth) knows why he didn't do more!  The plot while seeming a simple straight forward WWII rescue mission turns mind-twister in the final third and the movie features really spectacular stunt sequences.  There's action, suspense, and skullduggery aplenty for fans of this type of film and as I said before a surprisingly effective action star performance from Richard Burton coupled with an almost as silent as his 'man with no name' cowboy turn, as the token American on a British mission, from Eastwood.  Great fun and since it's a period piece - it holds up well.

Highly Recommended",1278374400,31,2581,4.878440366972477
3829150,5,B001XURJCS,"The seventies saw a spate of enjoyable war themed movies being released, from The Dirty Dozen to Eye Of The Needle. WED and Kelly's Heroes were among the best of the bunch, lighter and more energetic than today's dark tales such as Valkyrie, Saving Pvt. Ryan etc, good though they may be.

Anyone who is going to purchase this is already familiar with the plotlines, so I won't delve into a synopsis- see IMDB or Amazon for that.

Allies vs. Nazis has always made for good theater, and Eastwood as an action hero is tops, with stellar casts including Richard Burton in WED and Telly Savalas and Don Rickles in KH.
The price point for the Blu-ray discs as a combo is great and the transfers are superb, though not restored and remastered, as some reviewers have lamented.

Still, the clarity of the picture and the vibrancy of the colors is, in my opinion, superior to the previous DVD releases. I compared WED on standard DVD and Blu-ray by simultaneously playing them, one in my sony BDP350 and the other my upconverting Toshiba HD-DVD players. There was no contest, the blu-ray was remarkably detailed, and colors excellent, the 2:35 widescreen a must for viewing the entire film as it should be seen. (mind you, I love my HD-DVD and always felt that it was a better standard for high def than Blu -ray, but alas Toshiba lost that battle........sigh)

You simply can't go wrong with this combo set!",1277942400,27,1400,4.633064516129032
