vague. The program content seemed rushed. My wife and I were looking for a nice video that would serve as a postcar to our
vists to the mission. This was not it. Not recommended.",1060128000,2,298,4.4363636363636365

8143279,5,B00000DGHW,"Landmarks of Faith: California Missions is one of a series of videos that looks at different faiths through the exploration of relgious architecture.  In this video the host travels up and down the California coast and reveals the history of each mission.  The host is a wonderful storyteller, and the video is asthetically appealing.  I use this video as well as others in the Landmarks of Faith series to supplement a college course dealing with religion in America, and the students always respond enthusiastically to the material.  I reccomend this video to people interested in religious studies as well as to anyone planning a trip to California, for the missions and their environs are beautiful tourist destinations, and every traveler to California should include a visit to at least one of the California missions.",977961600,5,824,5.126865671641791
