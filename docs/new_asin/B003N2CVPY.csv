4156414,5,B003N2CVPY,"I just finished watching this new DVD of every childs favorite monkey Curious George.
The DVD has an episode about when George gets invited to be a guess in Kindergarten, there is another episode about a maze in Rankings Farm, Hundley teaching Sharky to behave so she can stay in her apartment complex and George of course has to come to the rescue, Professor Wiseman can't BAKE, so George seeks the help of Cheef Pasketi. It's a wonderful DVD that encourages children to use logic, seek help, try new things, use their imagination and invent new things! A must have DVD for any young child.

My kids both 3 right now love this pbs kids series, and I would encourage any parent to allow their children to watch Curious George.",1281139200,15,726,4.584615384615384
4156415,5,B003N2CVPY,"Can you say anything bad about Curious George? It is one of the cutest, most wholesome programs out there for kids. My 3 year old son adores Curious George. He gets so many ideas for crafts, and games from watching George's adventures. I'm sure this new DVD due out this summer will be just as great as all the other DVD releases. We are collecting all of them as he grows. He's always asking to watch ""a George"".",1276905600,4,413,4.3076923076923075
4156416,1,B003N2CVPY,I don't know that we hate this episode.  The one I received is blank.  I've never had that happen before.  My grandson is so fond of Curious George he was very disappointed when absolutely nothing showed up on that disk. The rest of them were perfect and he loves them so I am so glad I ordered more than the one.  He is 5 and doesn't understand why there is no movie on his new DVD.,1485561600,,383,4.0

At my house he is a household favorite.

If you haven't heard of him, he is a monkey with the personality of a politician.  I would say his personality is somewhere between George W. Bush and Barack Obama.  Curious George is always doing silly things that don't make sense, but he always gets away with it.",1425168000,,340,4.524590163934426

4156452,5,B003N2CVPY,"I am so sick of the programming on Disney Channel teaching my boy that if you want to get down from a tree you need a giant piece of celery to slide down.  We try and give our child other things to do, but the reality is that sometimes it is just more appropriate to let him watch some TV...if you can stand the agenda of the people making the programs.

Then we ran across Curious George and were relieved.  No agendas, no politically correct subject matter, no illogical logic.  The first time we watched one it was like taking your shoes off after a long walk on a summer day...aaahhhh.

To top it off, each DVD only costs around $10. I ended up buying 10 different titles and have been happy with every one...thus I will copy and paste this review on each one of them.

This is one happy dad who loves that annoying monkey.",1366070400,8,827,4.235668789808917
