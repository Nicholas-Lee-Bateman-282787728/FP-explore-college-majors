1663487,1,B00005U2FI,"This is by far the worst movie ever, and mentioning the worst gay movie I have ever seen. It carries not substace whatsoever, the main character is boring and predictable. If you want to see a great gay movie BIG EDEN is the movie to watch",1040342400,4,239,4.217391304347826
1663488,5,B00005U2FI,"I love this truly heatwarming movie. I place the Adventures of Felix along side some of my favorite ""gay-themed"" movies--those being: Lilies, Beautiful Thing, Maurice, Alive and Kicking, Dona Herlinda and her Son, My Beautiful Laundrete and I Think I Do.
This movie shows that a person's acquantances and/or friends can turn out to be family--something that gay people have known for ever.",1029283200,13,389,5.190476190476191
1663489,4,B00005U2FI,"This is a film about an orphan man hitching his way through France to meet his father for the first time.  In his journey he learns that families do not have to be biological to be of value.  The film is broken up in seven pieces: the introduction of the main character, a plot thread (murder!) to weave the film together, then a meeting of 5 people that becomes his family.  The ""grandmother"" and ""sister"" story lines are very well done.  They clearly illustrate the needs of these characters to make deep connections with each other and the brief events that tie them together.  Unfortunately, the other three encounters fail to do as well.  It is hard to imagine that the lead would actually keep in touch with the men he meets along the way.  The ""little brother"" story is cute and has many great monents, but the characters fail to connect in a lasting way.  The ""cousin"" vignette is simply gratuitous and nothing more (like too many American gay films).  The ""father"" section wraps up the film without really establishing any significant connection with the two men.  I am giving this film four stars because it is a nice film about discovery and family.  A welcome change from many of the other gay films out there.  Still I am left wishing for a remake that could demonstrate some real male bonding.  If you like films that are French, gay, or the theme of creating a family is one that has touched your life, then this film is worthy of your collection.",1026691200,29,1462,4.534351145038168
1663490,5,B00005U2FI,"Well done, feel good, and extremely realistic. Sami potrayed the character well. Another great french film.",1020556800,,107,5.75
1663491,5,B00005U2FI,"I wish American Filmakers could make movies like this.  A sweet, honest and often funny sweet slice of life with no pretensions.  The cinematography is beautiful, the characters feel like real people and there is gentleness and a real love for life portrayed in each scene.  And let's not forget the sexy causal way gay sex is dealt with.  Vive Felix!",1018137600,22,351,4.704918032786885
1663492,5,B00005U2FI,"I saw this at an alternative cinema and am only now buying it in DVD to have.  Felix decides to take a brief trip away from his boyfriend to search for his long-lost father in the south of France (Marseille).  Along the way he comes across people that he fits into the category of relative:  my sister, my little brother, etc. It is a simple story, but one that the French and, with few exceptions, only the French, do so well.  You will like Felix the person, laugh at his adventures, recognize his virtues and his faults, and be astounded with the mystery of life by the end of the movie.  Highly recommended if this is your thing.  Even a straight person not into gay cinema (i.e., 99.99% of straight people) would find it an amusing French slice-of-life and not egregriously scandalous from a sexual nature.",1014508800,42,811,4.52054794520548
1663493,4,B00005U2FI,"Sami Bouajila who won the Best Actor award at Cannes in 2006 for ""Days of Glory"" plays Felix.  Felix is French with Arab genes.  He goes on a road trip that lets us share his episodic journey to Marseilles.  Felix's significant other is Daniel played by Pierre-Loup Rajot, who looks like a French version of Mr. Clean with his baldhead and facial hair.  Felix decides he needs to meet his biological father and promises to meet Daniel when he gets to his journey.  Along his way, he has a number of different encounters with characters from a young boy.  (If my memory is correct, this was the character of Jules played by Charly Sergue.)  The boy is an artist who invites Felix to crash at his place.  A series of encounters occur including getting an underage Jules into a club & stealing a car.  All of this is approached as a lark that is carefree.  Jules decides he wants more action than Felix is willing to give; so Felix continues on his journey.  One of the most interesting encounters comes with an elderly woman Mathilde played by Patachou.  Patachou whose first film was in 1955, does a great job as the somewhat lonely but tolerant woman who enjoys Felix's company for as long as it lasts.  Felix meets a young mother Isabelle played by Ariane Ascaride who won the French Academy of Cinema Best Actress award in 1997 for ""Marius et Jeannette.""  As Felix arrives in Marseilles, he has a philosophical conversation with a fisherman played by Maurice Benichou.  Benichou does an excellent job, bringing an entire life before your eyes with a few brief scenes.  Probably the most sensational aspect of the film is Felix's encounter with the railroad man, described as ""cousin,"" played by Philippe Garziano.  Although there are several covers for the DVD, the one currently listed shows the guys taking off their shirts while flying a kite in the French countryside.  There is a flash of frontal nudity that results in a case of poison ivy ""where the sun don't shine.""  The French approach to this part of their lives is very matter-of-fact and shown without anxiety or sentimentality.  Directors Oliver Ducastel & Jacques Martineau have worked together on two subsequent films, ""My Life on Ice"" & ""Cockles & Muscles.""  The movie meanders through the French countryside, which is gorgeous.  I don't know if there is any great moral attached to this picture other than just to realize that life is passing; so enjoy each day.  It's a pleasant picture with some brilliant moments from Patachou & Benichou.  Enjoy!",1184630400,3,2519,4.764434180138569
1663494,4,B00005U2FI,"The Adventures of Felix is a movie that you must be patient with. The pacing can be a bit slow but the center and end of it begin to pull the pieces together. It wasn't until after the movie was over that I realized how much I really liked it.

We follow Felix (who is HIV+...don't worry it's not one of those movies about HIV...this film dealt with it without the heavy-handedness that most movies do. Felix takes his pills and that's about it. ) who decides to take a trip to the south of France to see the father he's never met after being laid off. Meeting his father becomes irrelevant as he encounters an assorted bunch of characters that reveal more about Felix than he reveals about himself (my favorite was ""the grandmother"" who was a hoot). There is an incidental sexual encounter with ""the cousin"" (you'll understand when you see the movie--he's not really his cousin) but it's shown very flippantly as if it's just another part of the adventure (don't expect full on sex in this movie b/c you won't get it). The fact that Felix has a boyfriend doesn't seem to bother either of them.

The movie is designed to expand the definition of family and it does so without the sap. Sami Bouajila is quite charming, incredibly SEXY and, as Felix, a little self-absorbed. The movie is not terrifically deep; it's a nice little story that has a nice, little ending.",1171065600,4,1365,4.522267206477733
1663495,4,B00005U2FI,"The Adventures of Felix is an enjoyable film to view but it's not one I suspect I will watch over and over again. It does offer a nice variety of background scenery as Felix takes a trip to meet his father who he has never known, following the death of his mother. A funny thing happens on the way to Marseilles. Actually SEVERAL things, not all of them funny, but it definately has its moments. It seems that everyone who's paths cross with Felix' is drawn to him like ""stink on a skunk"" as we say in Oklahomo. These adventures include a steamy sexcapade with a driver who gives him a ride (in more ways than one), an elderly woman who takes him in to her home to keep him from sleeping on a park bench and taking the risk of being mugged, a woman with a van load of children who decides she wants to spend the night with him although he is gay, and her children who quickly refer to him as ""Uncle Felix"" on a road trip of their own enroute to their individual dad's homes for the weekend. The only people who don't seem to warm up to him are the men he witnesses killing another man, and his father of course who doesn't know Felix is his son. The two meet however and eventually have a relationship which satisfies Felix and gives him the sence that his journey was not in vain. In the process he solves a crime as the only witness. All in all, very good acting and a good cast. A nice gay road trip film, complete with comedy, drama, adventure, mystery and a little horror all rolled into one.",1159920000,4,1497,4.201388888888889
1663496,5,B00005U2FI,"This is truly a wonderfully charming film. It is refreshing to see a movie deal with a character being HIV positive who is approaching his condition in such a positive way. This movie, much like Brokeback Mountain, is not only for a gay audience. Everyone could benefit from experiencing Felix and his journey. I recently saw Umbrellas of Cherbourg for the first time, and there is a certain charm that is unique to French films. Plus of course the language is so beautiful. It does present a lot of heavy issues in a very entertaining way. Sami Bouajila is a magnetic screen presence. I can see this actor has been quite busy so I will check out his other films. Also the jazz score is extremely appealing!! This is a GEM!!!",1159747200,4,725,4.541984732824427
1663497,3,B00005U2FI,"This is my third road movie in my last three rentals. I'm off this genre for the foreseeable future. The young man who plays Felix is certainly easy on the eyes, the French countryside is beautiful, and it's refreshing to see a character apparently healthy as he takes his HIV medications on schedule. The movie unfortunately doesn't really ever go anywhere. In the beginning of the film Felix, who has just lost his job, decides that he will pack up, leave his caring teacher lover and go looking for his father. Along the way he meets a ""little brother"" type with whom he steals a car containing a young baby, a ""grandmother"" type, a hunky ""cousin"" who he has a brief romp with and finally a ""father"" figure. I must have blinked or something got lost in translation since all at once Felix apparently is no longer interested in finding his real father but had a reunion with his lover and they go off into the proverbial sunset.

I even listened to the directors' commentary supplied on the DVD, something that is almost always fruitless since a director who has to spend 90 minutes explaining what he was trying to do is usually fighting a losing battle. That is certainly the case here.",1136851200,3,1190,4.586854460093897
1663498,5,B00005U2FI,"The negative reviews about this quiet little gem were penned by those who didn't understand this film... and probably don't enjoy human interest tales. I discovered this delight on DVD - a simple story without any car chases or action sequences. The charismatic and talented Sami Bouajila is outstanding as the title character, adding depth and believability to an already intelligently written character (and script). It's refreshing to see a gay man in a loving relationship without any drama. His HIV is also dealt with intelligently and sensitively. Felix's interaction with the solid supporting cast is a delight to watch across the board. Treat yourself to Felix! Highly recommended!",1101772800,13,689,5.330275229357798
1663499,3,B00005U2FI,"The movie does have potential. Felix is gay and is an Arab in France. He does not know his father, but develops odd and interesting relationships with random strangers that are kind enough to let him in. This is a coming of age movie in wehre Felix sees that family does not mean blood, that friends and lovers are can be like family; that his father is not that important.
The theme is interesting, but the characters are not very well developed and teh beginning is very dry.  One does not get to know Felix very well and see why he must meet his father, he seems comfortable with his lifestyle with his lover and the end is a bit flat also.
Not very entertaining, but good intentions. It is also a pretty short movie.",1058832000,6,720,4.333333333333333
1663500,5,B00005U2FI,I bought this dvd as a pig in a poke.  I loved it.  The main character is not only very handsome but has some depth.  The movie relates his experiences in life in general and they all add up to making Felix a human being who is in touch with people and not just a homosexual limited to 'gay' circles. I highly  recommend the movie,1053993600,8,330,4.030769230769231
1663501,4,B00005U2FI,"In my opinion this film is all about one man's journey across France in the 90s.  It is a singular look at one man's experiences with being gay, Arab and HIV+ against the backdrop of a ""family"" made of up of people he meets along the way.
His character is interesting, annoying and charming in a way that most scripts would never dare to portray.  And though the script is flawed, it is funny and shows France as it is at the moment, and that is not just about Paris!  Each of his ""family"" are like archetypes of modern French people e.g. the spoiled student looking for thrills, the old women with memories of the old French Empire, the Parisian leftist professor boyfriend etc.
It is not a perfect story but very good and quite diverting.
However, if you're looking for cheap thrills, don't let the box cover fool you.  That scene is good but not indicative of the whole movie.",1043107200,17,879,4.440993788819876
1663502,3,B00005U2FI,"If you have travelled around France and enjoy the scenery this movie will take you back and you can appreciate the countryside.  Other than that it wasn't that special at all, so if you are expecting a movie to ""wow"" you, skip this one.  The picture on the front makes it seem that this could be an interesting movie, but in reality the story line is pretty boring and could have been developed further.  The intention was good but those unrealistic encounters along his travels just do not make sense.  OK to rent for home viewing - don't waste your money on owning this one.",1040947200,6,576,4.457142857142857
7954189,4,B00005U2FI,"A really delightful story told with wit, understanding, and sympathy. I first saw it some years ago and am delighted to finally have my own copy.

7954192,5,B00005U2FI,One of the best on the road movies that I've seen. The main character is gay and has HIV;but he continues to survive with help from his lover and there are a few people that he meets who encourage him. Trying to meet his father who abandoned him as a child was so dificult ;but then his lover was waiting for him at the end,1424304000,,323,3.9846153846153847
7954193,4,B00005U2FI,"***** for the story line and acting!

*----!!!  Yes only ONE STAR for the overall quality of the dvd transfer. It hurts my eyes to watch a dvd so out of focus. If you don't believe me just try zooming in once or twice and you will see the picture quality deterioate very rapidly. It's a shame that a French gay classic like this received such inferior handling by the DVD manufacturer.  PLEASE RESCUE THIS FILM!!!",1409443200,,413,4.407894736842105
7954194,5,B00005U2FI,I'm looking for that movie for long time and finally i find it. I saw it many years ago and I liked it so much. it's a very touching history. It's the life. Great,1406160000,,162,3.7941176470588234
7954195,4,B00005U2FI,"Rather enjoyed Sami Bouajila in his light hearted role, some lovely scenery thrown in & a huge member on Philippe Garziano",1365206400,,122,4.857142857142857
7954196,5,B00005U2FI,"I enjoy seeing this movie, it is a favorite of mine, it arrived on time and in good condition, very satisfied with my purchase",1353110400,,126,4.291666666666667
7954197,4,B00005U2FI,"Charming, unpretentious comedy about a young man, Felix (Sami Bouajila), who decides on the spur of the moment to travel across France to meet the father he never knew.  As he journeys he encounters individuals whom he comes to view as members of his extended family (""little brother"", ""cousin"", ""grandmother"", and so forth).  Along the way he steals a car with a baby in it, takes an underage boy to a gay bar, has a romantic interlude with a handsome man, is coerced into helping an old lady rearrange her house, gets beaten up, and witnesses a murder.

For the most part the humor is quiet and understated, although at times it is laugh-out-loud funny.  The best sequence is when Felix meets the saucy old woman who takes a more than motherly interest in him.

The only real drawback to the film is that it drags in spots, particularly during the episode with his ""sister"", a young woman with three children who picks our hero up while he is hitchhiking.  Otherwise everything is just fine.  The photography is beautiful (how can the French countryside be anything but beautiful?), the writing is sharp, and the music is catchy.  Bouajila is an appealing Felix, bright-eyed and full of life, in spite of being HIV positive (a plot device which thankfully does not interfere with the humor of the film).  The rest of the cast is excellent, particularly the great singer/actress Patachou, who plays his ""grandmother"".

All in all, a very enjoyable way to spend 90 minutes",1314489600,,1472,4.75984251968504
7954198,5,B00005U2FI,"I saw this at a film festival years ago and have wanted to see it again ever since. ""Felix"" is a deeply moving film (though not heavy and dour) which re-defines what ""family"" really is. The cover image makes it look like it's all about sex but it's not. It's about examining your life and making your own family. See this film!!!",1288742400,,329,4.32258064516129
