8728891,5,B013UY283E,"Beautiful. Dancing as a treatment for Parkinson's - and of course, though the movie doesn't explicitly say so, music therapy, as all the dancing is done to music. Many medical institutions, including the Mayo Clinic, use music to calm patients before operations, and have found that some even need less anesthesia if allowed to choose their favorite music via earphones. The doctors and hospitals and other caregivers, they all should see this film and try to incorporate dance in their protocols. A wonderful respite, this film, from the ugly movies and, for that matter, daily news which confronts us around the clock now.",1517097600,,624,5.067961165048544
