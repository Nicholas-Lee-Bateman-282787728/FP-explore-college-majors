7794907,2,0979635632,"I may not be the target audience for this DVD.  But then if there is a target audience maybe they should market it more specifically instead of on Amazon.

The DVD covers seven areas of growing up in which kids can stumble if they do not recieve sufficient guidence.  My problem is that the DVD is so extreme in its fundamentalist viewpoints.  The presenter, Brag Harrub, really did have some good points, but seemed more interested in shielding kids from trouble or shaming them into following his view of Christian behavior than in preparing kids to learn and make mistakes as they grow and then subsequently become adults who are able to function as responsible adult Christians.

There is information in the video that could be a useful starting place for further discussion.  Look Harrub up on the internet and see if you are comfortable with his opinion before you buy the DVD.  Or buy the DVD, as I did, knowing that it is only $5.00.",1284768000,3,941,4.632530120481928
