3442443,5,B0019NR0R8,"I agree with the other reviewers, this may be short, but it dang, sure is good!!!! This is some great, rare, early, dvd footage of the B-52's performing live before an audience, in Germany, during 1983. This is the U.S.A., Southern Rock's contribution to the ""punk"" & ""post-punk"", music scene, and they are terrific. This includes the late/great B-52's guitarist Rickey Wilson, a brother to band member, Cindy Wilson. The B-52's performed at New York City's ""Max's Kansas City"", in 1977, and they were well received. They became just as popular as ""punk"" & ""post-punk"", bands that performed at CBGB's, like Blondie, The Ramones, & Talking Heads & many others. In fact the B-52's did perform at CBGB's in NYC. If you like the B-52's, you'll love this one for sure. Thanks!!!",1296086400,5,773,4.863636363636363
3442444,5,B0019NR0R8,"This DVD blew me away! Brought back lots of fond memories of ""The Worlds Greatest Party Band"". Great camera work for a piece thats 27 years old. See the B's as they were before the cosmic wagon train. Great to see founding member Ricky Wilson (R.I.P.) and the band sweating to the oldies. Its only 7 songs (would love to find the rest) but its a great ride back in time. Peace!",1293580800,7,377,4.25
3442445,5,B0019NR0R8,"This is a very high energy performance that exceeds my wildest expectations. Here's the downside. It is a short concert - 30 minutes and the video quality could be better. Here's the upside - it's the bestest and craziest 30 minutes you'll ever watch. I own many many live concert DVD's - a couple Queens' including Live-Aid, Roger Water's Pink Floyd Live, Stop Making Sense, several James Brown concerts, The Stones, Hendrix, The Who..., every Frank Sinatra that exists and easily 50+ other concert DVD's. This B-52's DVD ranks up there with any one of them. These guys are on fire! Words can't really describe the energy Fred displays on this, not to mention the rest of them. Sure, the video quality could be better, but is well worth the small sacrifice and we quickly forget about it once the show starts. You'd have to be comatose to not want to get up and dance. I'm curious if Fred was ""on"" something here or maybe he had just drank 3 pots of coffee. Whatever he's on/doing or not doing, it works! And then there is the very sexy/erotic Cindy Wilson with her vocals and bongos. WOW! They're all on top of their game here. It's impossible to not immediatly rewatch this when it's over. I am glad I found this rare gem and it is truly a welcome addition to my collection. I have no doubt you will love it too! If only these guys(and others)would have filmed more concerts...",1291593600,2,1380,4.524
3442446,5,B0019NR0R8,"wow, so great to see the whole show. i am the sax player in the band and have only seen a few clips on youtube. it  really brings me back top a fun time... what a band!! and so great to see Dave Buck and Ricky Wilson who are no longer with us.. at least not on earth!",1290124800,3,267,3.603448275862069
3442447,1,B0019NR0R8,"I was expecting to see one of my favorite artist but what a shame. The poor quality of the video made me think of claiming for a return back  of my money. Since I live in Panama I don't know whether it`s worthwhile to do that. Don`t buy it. So far, the Sacred Fire is the best Santana`s Concert.",1210291200,,295,4.0
3442448,2,B0019NR0R8,"The concert is absolutely great with the vocals of Tony Lindsay, and all band members on form, especially Carlos. But this is let down by the truly awful sound and picture! Considering this is quite a recent concert compared to some of santanas early recordings, you would have thought that the quality would be spot on. It also advertises digital, 5-1 surround sound etc, but it is not! even though, for the avid santana fan, it is a must buy, even if you can adjust the quality in your own imagination, as the concert itself is well worth it!!!",1210204800,,546,4.525252525252525
3442449,1,B0019NR0R8,very disappointed -- in SANTANA  LIVE DVD - QUALITY  VERY POOR - IT IS HUDSON STREET  - NEW MEDIA HIGHLINE PRODUCTION,1207353600,3,117,4.476190476190476
3442450,5,B0019NR0R8,"this is a grrreat performance by Santana w/ his band as well as members of Dave Matthews band !!! the video quality is very ""grainy"" but viewable & the sound quality is very good thru a good stereo BUT the main thing is a grrreat performance where Carlos plays his PRS yellow Brazilian with alotta fire & finesse plus the band is high energy hot !!! lotsa tunes that are not on his other videos... also, there is an electric guitar/ electric violin jam that is very impressive in this 2 hour concert !!! in this Santana fan's opinion = this DVD is ESSENTIAL & VITAL for any serious Santana afficianado's collection = BUY IT !!!",1195257600,5,627,4.413793103448276

8274881,1,B0019NR0R8,"I was so excited when I found out that the Corrs had a new DVD!  Unfortunately, this is not an official release.  This is a bootleg concert from a show they did in 1998.  The sound is mediocre at best, the picture is blurry, and the menus look like someone made this in their basement.  There is even corny credits music at the end, proving my point.  Let me not forget the watermark in the top right corner that makes it obvious that this was ripped from TV!  Amazon should verify items before they sell them directly!  This wasn't even from a third party seller!",1396656000,5,564,4.314285714285714
8274882,4,B0019NR0R8,"It sure would of been the dvd of the decade had  ""Good Stuff"" and ""Love Shack""  been on the 'dvd.",1369958400,,97,3.8
8274883,2,B0019NR0R8,i like the dvd but wasn't the best picture  and sound but good songs on it it came on time thanks!,1362960000,,98,3.6666666666666665
8274884,5,B0019NR0R8,Great picture and sound from this 1983 B'S Festival show. Its a non-stop Dance PARTY- SO PASS THAT TANNING BUTTER!!,1326758400,4,115,4.8
8274885,4,B0019NR0R8,"If you love the B'S, there is no way you won't love this DVD! I only wish I could have been there!",1320624000,,98,3.5
8274886,5,B0019NR0R8,"Oh hell yes!  This DVD is simply amazing - classic B's at the top of their game... and with Ricky to boot!  Sound and video quality of the DVD is NOT HD year 2011, but is par for the VHS year 1983 course.  I know that the ""With the Wild Crowd"" DVD is due out next year (in 2012), but I'd much rather see more of these concerts leak out - here's wishing and hoping for more classic B-52s.  THE best live band ever, watching Fred gyrate with youthful vigor is the best thing since shoelaces.",1319241600,4,489,4.0625
8274887,5,B0019NR0R8,"The B-52s are known as the worlds greatest party band. Seeing them live confirms this. This DVD is the next best thing to being at one of their concerts. For a 1983 concert,the sound & picture are excellent. This DVD captures this band at their best.",1314489600,2,250,4.456521739130435
