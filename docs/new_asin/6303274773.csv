625229,5,6303274773,Washington State is one of the best kept secrets in the world. To see Washington in all its glory you must see it from the air. And that is axactly what this DVD does. Not a word is spoken on this DVD. The beauty of film says it all. Don't buy this DVD if your not prepaired to to visit Washington State. Enjoy.,1302998400,,311,3.9523809523809526
625230,5,6303274773,"I purchased my first copy of Over Washington in 1992, ans have always enjoyed watching it. I have shared this video with so many people, especially since I moved back to my home state of Louisiana 14 years ago. However, I lost that copy when Hurricane Katrina took our home in 2005. Because I love Washington State so much, I shared it with many friends over the years. I am glad to see that the video is still available and will be ordering a copy today.",1296000000,4,455,4.3023255813953485
625231,1,6303274773,"I have just watched this documentary looking forward till it finishes. There are some interesting views of Washington, but it takes too long and the poor narrative information is just full of unimportant quotations by prominent people. A few days ago I saw ""Over Alaska"" and it was the very opposite of what the previous video offers: excellent views, very well narrated with not only basic information about this marvelous state but also nice legends",1264291200,3,451,5.026666666666666
625232,5,6303274773,"Washington State?  Yes!  It is nothing like Washington DC!  You will find many kinds of water sources, mountain ranges including beautiful well know peaks, desert, high plateaus, rain forest, farmlands, forests, cities and much more.  You will actually see a little bit of most features you find in the United States all in one beautiful State.  For anyone who has wanted to see what Washington state is like, this is the video for you.  You won't find Big Foot even though he has been sited in Washington BUT it IS a wonderful arial video showing some of the wonders and has been enjoyed by everyone we have gifted it to!",1252368000,3,622,4.609090909090909
625233,5,6303274773,"I sent this CD to friends in Australia, and they were very much impressed with both the excellent photography, and the natural beauty that our state has. The delivery time to Australia didn't take very long at all.",1242172800,,214,4.657894736842105
625234,3,6303274773,"I lived in the State of Washington for a number of years. While the footage of the state is good, the lack of subtitles leaves a person not familiar with the state not knowing what they are viewing.  The makers of this DVD could easily have taken the time to include labels for each of the prominent landmarks they flew over.  Additionally, as a professional charter and airline pilot, I question the 30-45 degree bank angles the pilot performed in making this film.  Those angles did not enhance the scenic views, they detract from it.",1086134400,5,536,4.621052631578947
625235,5,6303274773,"Whether you live in Washington state or just want to look at its beauty, this tape is a winner. I usually find ""nature"" shows a bit slow paced, but the photography here is simply stunning.
The images are so compelling, I even bought several copies of this tape as business gifts for people we wanted to move to Washington. And our Seattle PBS station (KCTS) has shown it over and over and over.
This tape deserves to be a big seller. It's a really fine piece of work.",995155200,6,467,4.318181818181818
625236,5,6303274773,"Excellent.  Good for background video or just to relax.  Bottom line, worth the money and will not disappoint.  A fine choice, but needs to be put onto DVD.",972518400,,156,4.5
625280,5,6303274773,Extremely happy with everything. Thank you.,1410307200,,43,6.333333333333333

625283,5,6303274773,"I remember watching this series on VHS back when I was a child.  My wife recently purchased this for her classroom, and it's still just as good as it ever was.",1373068800,,159,4.129032258064516
625284,5,6303274773,"Liked it so much that I ordered two more for gifts for out-of-state friends/family.
Only negative is that it was dated (1989).
Made me appreciate even more the physical beauty of Washington state!",1368230400,,196,4.96969696969697
625285,5,6303274773,Great video to introduce Washington to out-of-staters.  A good range of Washington scenery and pleasant music.  It makes a great gift.,1361318400,,134,5.333333333333333
625286,5,6303274773,"I love the perspective of watching everything filmed from above, especially when you see the Olympic and Cascade mountains covered with snow.  The music and quotes just add to a spectacular visual of what Washington State is really like.  The price was unbelievable.  I got it for pennies on the dollar compared to most other places.",1358985600,,333,4.910714285714286
625287,1,6303274773,"What a disappointment!  I wanted to learn more about my state but just saw beautiful scenery.  The minimal commentary was quotes that didn't pertain to learning about the areas of the state that I knew little about.  The pacing was so slow that I fast forwarded through much of it.  If you only want photos for an hour, this could work for you.",1355011200,,344,4.412698412698413
625288,5,6303274773,The images and the poetry is an incredible match.  I have began to plan trips to areas where some of these pictures were photographed.,1344816000,2,134,4.583333333333333
625289,4,6303274773,"This was a very enjoyable dvd. I watched it when it first came out several years ago on PBS and decided to get it. Altho is is several years old, I watched it from start to finish.",1336867200,3,180,3.891891891891892
7843553,3,6303274773,"Must have missed the fine print.  It's a pretty old video so format was not 16:9 or even close, and quality was NOT high rez!  (Which is kind of what you want for a video like this.)",1516492800,,182,3.891891891891892
7843554,1,6303274773,Very poor video quality,1487548800,,23,5.0
7843555,1,6303274773,"1988 production in glorious 480P low definition video. Most scenes look like a blurry impressionist painting. Adding to the low def are dizzying high speed shots of random buildings, oil production facilities with unnamed rivers and mountain tops thrown in. Audio is muffled. No continuity, just some guy out buzzing around with a 1980's VHS camcorder.

This video is old garbage, not worth viewing. A waste of $10 and an hour of time.",1483660800,,435,4.958904109589041
7843556,5,6303274773,Great video.,1475366400,,12,5.5
7843557,2,6303274773,"Dated. Too much footage on ""mountains"". Needs updating badly.",1452470400,,61,5.888888888888889
7843558,2,6303274773,"I really wanted to like this.  I've heard tell the photography is beautiful.  I have heard you can learn all sorts of important things about our home state while seeing some beautiful scenery.  This is a top-notch excursion for what it is, I have heard.  I have heard all of these things from some fortunate soul who was able to stay awake more than seven minutes into this.  Seven.  That is my record.  This is useful on those nights when even my counting sheep have hit the hay but this is the only thing that saved this from a one star rating.  Give this to somebody that you really think needs more rest.  Who needs Ambien when you have a copy of this nearby?",1430524800,,663,4.282258064516129
7843559,4,6303274773,All good with this dvd. Gr8 shots of Washington..,1430006400,,49,4.555555555555555
7843560,3,6303274773,for Japanese friend - didn't view,1420761600,,33,4.666666666666667
7843561,3,6303274773,I purchased this as a supplement for the Washington State History class I teach. It gives a good visual overview of all the various and diverse regions of our state. I just expected explanations of what was on the film. If you just enjoy looking quietly at scenery - you will love this film. If you hope to learn about what you are seeing - skip it.,1419206400,,349,4.223880597014926
