8135663,5,B000H0M434,"This DVD program clearly discusses the challenges that were overcome in the Saint Louis Arch's conceptualization, design and construction. Laced with period photography and movie cuts, the program features people who participated in building the Arch.

Saint Louis residents consider the Arch just another part of their urban environment. This program explains the incredible effort that produced a one-of-a-kind monument: acquiring the site took decades; architect Eero Saarinen (who died before the Arch was constructed) produced a visionary design within a monumental postwar competition; Saint Louis construction engineers developed new technology allowing Saarinen's vision to be built; and Saint Louis construction people built the Arch under pre-OSHA conditions without incurring fatalities. One interviewee muses that building the Arch under today's OSHA safety regulations might be impossible; that's another reason to appreciate the monumental gem sitting on Saint Louis's riverfront.",1512864000,,994,6.151079136690647

8135665,5,B000H0M434,Excellent biography and photography.  I was interested in how such a structure came to be.  Now I know the problems and dangers behind the structure of The St. Louis Arch.,1401062400,,171,4.666666666666667
8135666,5,B000H0M434,"I was hoping to be able to find this DVD ever since I saw it advertised on my visit to the arch.  When I finally went to purchase it, it was gone.",1383609600,,146,3.5625
8135667,3,B000H0M434,"We choose this rating because when we visited the site in the era before DVD's, we purchased the VHS of how the Arch was constructed from planning stage to completion.  It was awesome!  We thought this DVD would show the same historical data.  It did not have the historical data like the VHS, but it was still interesting to view.",1375660800,,331,4.483333333333333
8135668,5,B000H0M434,"Another great video from Modern Marvels that shows how people with a vision of creating something so great and unique to make their community stand out can work together to overcome political, financial, and technical hurdles to produce something so marvelous. This video showed that architects and engineers were taking the lead to inspire and work with community leaders to accomplish this great project.",1227571200,2,406,5.359375

""In 1863, a steam engine made the first run of a new era as the very first subway train chugged beneath London's streets. Nearly a century and a half later, the ""Tube"" is an internationally recognized symbol of the British capitol, and one of the most extensive subway systems in the world.

MODERN MARVELSTM tells the complete story of the 243-mile-long subterranean network that keeps London moving. Engineers lead a tour of the inner workings of the Tube, and show the chambers and tunnels where its past lives on today. Historians trace the developments that transformed the first subway into the extensive network that it is today, and we'll get a peek at the brand-new Jubilee line, the fully-automated model for the future of public transportation.

This is the definitive look at the vast system that carries nearly a billion people every year.""",1185926400,2,890,5.0
8135670,5,B000H0M434,"When talking about St. Louis, the first impression bumping into my mind is the Gateway Arch. I've visited there several times when I lived in Illinois. I also brought my friends and even my parents from Taiwan there. Although the shape is quite simple, it's just breathtaking and I've always enjoyed watching it and being there.

The film dates back to Louisiana Purchase and Lewis and Clark Expedition. All essential knowledge of the arch, including the background, motivation, competition, design, and construction, is covered and each part of the above shares a reasonable time to watch, I think. Some stories are also quite interesting and entertaining. Unlike other THC DVD's usually weak at the technical description, this film, on the contrary, does a great job for this and I am satisfied with it.

Generally speaking, this film is succinct but quite inside the skin. It's pretty well-organized, too. I've always tried to look for a good St. Louis Arch film and put it in my collections. This one serves the purpose. I have also bought couple more as presents for my friends from civil engineering.

My only complain is that THC should release it earlier, if any.",1169683200,8,1171,4.934010152284264
