8308181,5,B001H9ML9G,"Tom, Tom is the rigorous, yet playful, deconstruction of a 1905 Mutograph ""feature"" that runs about five minutes and tells the story of Tom running off with a pig and everyone else chasing after him. The film is first shown in its entirety, and if you've ever seen pre-1910 films, you'll know how (1) there are no closeups, (2) the camera frames the scenes as if in a theater, and (3) at least the beginning of the film, with jugglers, acrobats, a horn player, and sundry others milling about, is almost completely incomprehensible without a narrator pointing out the particulars of the scene. Anyhow, Jacobs then spends the next hour dissecting this brief film. He points out frames where a person loses his stage face. Or goes into great detail about the juggler. Or blows the film up to where nothing can be seen but black and white profiles of something or other. At one point he simply zooms through the whole film in blur-motion. There is always something mysterious, entertaining, captivating in his closeups, and he ends the film by playing the entire Tom Tom all over again (but boy, will you see it now!). A celebration of the mysteries of cinema.",1246233600,11,1157,4.704433497536946
