7805289,5,6300208915,I enjoy watching this DVD of Paranoia (1969)!,1501027200,,45,4.75
7805290,1,6300208915,Poor quality copy of VHS. Many scenes were cut from original. Cannot recommend this DVD.,1485302400,4,88,4.933333333333334
7805291,1,6300208915,Why did I buy a DVD that looks at though it was recorded on VHS. Why did I get a movie that was edited for television? Why is Amazon selling products like this? I assumed this DVD movie was the original film. What I received was a chopped up VHS film on DVD..... Why??,1481155200,4,268,3.9814814814814814
7805292,4,6300208915,"The quality of this DVD was not as bad as other reviewers seemed to indicate. Maybe  mine is a newer and better version.  However, at the end of
the movie it indicated that it had possibly been  edited for TV.  It  did  have a number  of  abrupt  scene  changes,  but  that  did not  detract  from the  story  line.  Overall,  I found  the  movie okay  with  a  great  script.",1467244800,,376,4.176470588235294
7805293,5,6300208915,This was a great movie. Keeps you on the edge of your seat.,1437955200,,59,3.6153846153846154
7805294,1,6300208915,"This disc appears to have been mastered from an ancient, worn-out 16 mm. made-for-tv print.  Scratch marks, film damage, bad sound, and inept panning-and-scanning pervade the film from beginning to end.  The end credits display the
statement ""Edited for TV by Paragon, Inc"".  Needless to say, since this is a TV version -- a fact not disclosed by Amazon -- we don't get to see much of Ms. Baker's ample anatomical charms, which is what attracted us to her 1960's and '70's Italian films in the first place.

In its online description of its manufactured-on-demand DVD service, Amazon tells us that these releases are ""manufactured from original source materials.""  In my view, a hacked-up print edited for 1970's television should not qualify as ""original source materials.""  Apparently, Amazon disagrees with me.",1336694400,34,813,5.1679389312977095
7805295,3,6300208915,"Baker is true to form as another tortured-victim-heroine, Catherine West, widow of a wealthy race car driver vacationing in an Italian Villa while her lawyer settles the affairs of his estate. Enters a handsome young man with car trouble and his stepsister, both driven to seduce her. Yet, more is in their plans than sex. First blackmail, then captive holding, then planting a frog in her plate for dinner, all to drive her suicidal. But, wait! Her lawyer helped plan it all along to cheat her out of the inheritance and he delivers the final murder blow. Those were the days of the drive-in triple features, and it played at the Sunset last after ""Slasher Saw II."" (or movies like it.) VHS contains more erotic scenes than the Italian language DVD. Just to confuse things more about all the non-English versions of this film, the Italian film also contains some nudity that was cut from VHS, but has shorter scenes.",1230940800,9,917,4.7375
7805296,4,6300208915,"This film has some great plot twists and turns that will keep you guessing what happens next. Baker is good as a race car driver(Helen) and Marina Coffa is magnetic as her ex-husband's stepdaughter who's been pulling the strings behind the mysterious events all along. Helen is enlisted by Maurice's new wife, Constance, to help murder him, but these plans backfire. The end has a strange plot hole, maybe it was lost from the film. How did Maurice find his way unseen by others to the doctor when he accidently shot himself with a hunting rifle, leaving the tower empty so people thought he had been murdered? It kept me watching it over a few dozen times. Write what you think happened in comments.",1224288000,3,700,4.653225806451613
7805297,3,6300208915,"I'm a big Carroll Baker fan. This movie is good trash. Carroll looks beautiful in it and shows lots of skin.
It's pan and scan so you miss some of the image on each side of the screen. The story is pretty suspenseful but it goes on too long. I love the trashy movies she made in Europe in the 60s and 70s. Good fun.
But buy this on DVD, if you can find it.",1200700800,7,356,3.76
