8629505,3,B00H3O2BGC,I have seen this before on PBS. It's a fascinating look into what it takes to be a taiko drummer. I wanted to watch it again but discovered avter renting the video was not subtitled. Five stars  for the documentary (if I had been able to watch it again) 1 star for the description not mentioning the lack of subtitles.,1469491200,,318,4.3

8629508,4,B00H3O2BGC,"I'm glad to have this; I remember seeing it on PBS years ago.  I was hoping to use it with my music classes during our taiko unit.  Unfortunately, it's not ""chaptered"" and I'm pretty sure there would be some objections to showing the sections in which the drummers are fundoshi-clad.  Given how hard it is to fast forward on the school eqipment, I probably won't use this much to show excerpts.  Still, it will support my teaching efforts and it has a place in my library.  Great story, and this time I noticed the women in the story, which supported my research into the femine role in taiko (until the 20th century).  I'm giving it 4 stars just because it was not edited into chapters, which I think is a drawback in any dvd.",1414281600,,727,4.388059701492537
