8075374,5,B000A7BQPQ,"This is simply an amazing performance. Lot of young talent, recorded live, and every bit as great as the live shows. There's not much else to say besides that. If you want to see young talent and some of the best fiddle playing combined into a unique theatrical presentation, you'll want to watch this. I've watched this with anyone from heavy metal fans to rap fans to bluegrass fans and they have all loved it.

NOTE: Let me say that I am rating this based off a perfect DVD copy. My copy is crystal clear on my TV. I did NOT get my copy from Amazon, but directly from Barrage's website a few years ago. I would highly suggest NOT letting a few bad copies of the DVD sway you from buying this. Just make sure the source you are purchasing from is legit and it's not some dubbed copy.",1297468800,2,785,4.233333333333333
8075375,1,B000A7BQPQ,"This has to be the worst video recording I have ever purchased.  I do not recommend it to anyone...  well, maybe to the blind.

I bought this DVD a couple of years ago because I was very impressed with the ""World on Stage"" performance that was shown on our local PBS television station.  However, after viewing the first few minutes of the ""Vagabond Tales"" recording my heart sank.  There was vertical banding and extremely poor resolution present throughout the entire film.  It was like watching stick-figures playing violins in the dark.

I called the Barrage customer service number in Canada directly and received a very friendly person on the other end who promised to send me a new DVD right away. He said that the new show had been filmed in HD and I should have experienced a great show.  Three weeks later I called him back to say I hadn't received the new DVD and a few days later it came.  Hmm...

Different DVD-Same problem.  The long-shots of the stage could be compared to watching a bad puppet show from a distance with Vaseline coated glasses.  If I complained about a specific problem with the recording I would expect that someone would have checked into the issue rather than sending me the same thing again.",1280707200,2,1228,4.6342592592592595
8075376,5,B000A7BQPQ,"I marvel at the other review of this DVD. We have a 42 inch TV and have not the slightest problem with the picture. The real issue here is the music. Basically, this is ""Blast"" with violins. It starts with an amazing exhibition of fiddle playing by about ten young fiddle players. From this point a story involves that gives reason for playing the tunes that are used. It is quite eclectic in that several styles are used. It is a truly superb performance that has been repeated world wide and has been extremely successful. I HIGHLY recommend this DVD.",1277164800,3,553,4.54
8075377,1,B000A7BQPQ,"I bought this about a year ago and never played it until just the other day.  Yeow!  It could be that it is just my copy but the image is terrible!  It might look all right on a smaller television or a computer screen but on my 70"" home theater set, forget it.  The entertainers on stage display strange, vertical banding as they move about.  I only kept it on for a few minutes....the sound seemed fine....but the picture was anything but acceptable.  I saw the Barrage group live on stage and they were very entertaining and impressive....this DVD, sadly enough, is not.",1226707200,3,572,4.504854368932039
