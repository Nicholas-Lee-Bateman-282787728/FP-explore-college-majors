8012741,1,B0001HAIRC,"This trailer is not right, showing wrong movie. Because of this I returned DVD.",1511913600,,79,4.714285714285714
8012742,5,B0001HAIRC,"This is a great movie that very accurately portrays the painful reality that East European countries found themselves in after the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe. It really helps to have historical context to make sense of the movie. With the transition to a so-called free market economy, regular people tried to start business ventures however there was much lawlessness at the time, with thugs blackmailing and extorting practically everyone. The police were corrupt so it was a very difficult reality to try and survive in. It was, and even today continues to be, to a degree, a society where the thugs and crooks live at the expense of everyday people and there is no justice. One should note that the movie takes place 10 years after the collapse of the system yet reality hasn't changed much for people. It is a difficult movie to watch as it shows how these very ordinary and likeable guys fall victims to a lawless society and our protagonist falls victim to his conscience.",1510963200,,988,4.783625730994152
8012743,4,B0001HAIRC,"I was gifted 5 polish dvd's from a cousin and this was probably one of my favorites.  It's not for everyone, and it may help if you like european movies, especially about eastern europe.  Basically you follow two longtime friends desperately trying to start a successful business.  After they run into a potential investor, their lives are quickly changed and now they're in a totally different kind of fight.  It's based on a true story and it's worth watching to the end to find out what happens.  Quite dark, but I was intrigued all along.",1391644800,,542,4.663157894736842
8012744,1,B0001HAIRC,"Sucks.  If I were in Eastern Europe I guess I would think it is great but by North American standards it is crap.  The story is probably good, and looks true, but it has been done a thousand times in Hollywood. One star cause I can't give it a negative rating.",1322956800,,260,4.078431372549019
8012745,1,B0001HAIRC,"""The Debt"" write up sounds like a great movie but after you get sucked into purchasing it you find out it's a piece of crap. Movie was terrible. This dvd went directly to my ""rummage"" pile. Don't wast your money or time watching it.",1320019200,2,232,4.295454545454546
8012746,4,B0001HAIRC,"What struck me the most about this film is the fact that the story line is so believable. Two ordinary guys, one married the other engaged are about to go into business together and in their quest for funding one of them runs into an old friend who they immediately pitch their plan to. The acquaintance listens promising to get back to them which he does, the only problem is that his terms are outrageous at which time the partners find out that they are now dealing with the Russian mob. Things turn ugly and life becomes all about survival - do you succumb?, do you run?, do you do the unthinkable? Based on a true story this film will keep you on edge and make you think 'what would I do'?",1095465600,12,694,4.265151515151516
