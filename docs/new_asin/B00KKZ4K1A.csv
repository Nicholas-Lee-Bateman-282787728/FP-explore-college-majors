6433172,5,B00KKZ4K1A,"I have waited along time for this series to come out and hopefully the rest of the seasons will be released soon.  The series follows the descendants of the original series.  David Carradine reprises his role as Qui Chang Caine, but as his descendant and Chris Potter takes the role of his son. Of course Chris doesn't look at all Chinese witch is explained by the fact his mother was white. Chris plays Peter who is separated while young due to an attack on his fathers monastery and both his father and him believing that the other was dead. This new series begins with their unexpected reunion and conflicts since instead of following his early training as a Shaolin, he became a cop and uses a gun. They end up helping each other and their lives becomes intertwined as Chis (Peter) starts relearning his teaching. Further seasons add and grow their story.",1413244800,8,859,4.644736842105263
6433173,5,B00KKZ4K1A,"This was a great show for multiple reasons. First it could stand on it's own and be a great show or view it as a continuation of the original Kung fu. The two main characters are great and both of the main characters progress well over the series leading up to (spoiler alert) Peter Cain becoming a shaolin monk.

In the series the grandson of the original Kwai Chain Cain from the first kung fu series and his son Peter are seperated for a couple decades after their temple is destroyed by a renegade monk and both the main characters believe the other is dead. skip ahead to present day, Peter was raised by a cop and follows in his footsteps, He and his father are reunited by chance and they essentially team up in most episodes.",1410566400,17,733,4.350364963503649
6433174,5,B00KKZ4K1A,"It's about time this was released . Kwai Chang Caine continues on his journey and rediscovers his lost son to whom he thought had perished in a fire at a temple they both lived in 15 yrs ago . Son all grown up becomes a cop when one night he recognized a person (Caine) coming out of yet another burning building carrying an old man to safety. These stories are so much better then the original Kung Fu series by far and.the video quality is very good for mono stereo . I sure hope that WB releases the rest of the seasons.

6433183,5,B00KKZ4K1A,"I saw this show on television over 20 years ago and enjoyed it. It took me this long to finally get it to my DVD collection. It was a little expensive, but well worth the money. I learned how to knock some sense into a couple of bullies as a kid by watching shows where fighting and self defense scenes were shown. I always found television and movies to give me the most education. David Carradine is one of my favorite actors, as well as the other Carradine members of his family.",1483228800,2,482,4.25

6433192,5,B00KKZ4K1A,buying this from Amazon is a long time dream for me.  I grew up watching this show & was so excited to find the first two seasons on DVD.  I echo some of the other reviews in saying thank you to whoever is responsible for their release; and add my sincere hope & wish for the last two seasons to be released so I can relive the rest of this childhood favorite :).,1468022400,,363,3.958904109589041
6433193,5,B00KKZ4K1A,"After over 20 years this series is finally on DVD, and it is as good as I remember. I have waited and waited for this show, which is one of my top ten favorite shows ever.

I'll never understand why it took so long. Shows without even a full season of episodes go to DVD. This show ran for four years and 88 episodes, which is longer than the original Kung Fu, which ran for three. And there is a reason for that. The stories are great and the chemistry between David Carradine and Chris Potter as a father and son reunited after thinking each other is dead for 15 years, is everything I remember.

But this isn't a remake or reboot, this is a continuation set in modern times, with many references to the original. (A favorite scene of mine is early in season 1 when Caine, at a wedding, is handed a drink. When he asks what it's called, the bartender tells him it's called a grasshopper.)

Now fans just have to wait for season 3 and 4; hopefully it won't take another 20 years.",1467244800,,980,4.229946524064171
6433194,1,B00KKZ4K1A,"Kung Fu the Legend Continues is just as bad as the original 1970s Kung Fu TV series!  David Carradine is Not Chinese! Kung Fu and Kun Fu the legend Continues were both bad for casting David Carradine as the half White/half Chinese Kwai Chang Caine , an apothecary in the old west. I did not like either show even though Kung Fu the legend Continues took place in the 1990s. his son, Peter Caine, played by Chris Potter, was a cop and his character was suppose to be a quarter Chinese. None of these actors had any Chinese blood. None at all.",1466899200,,541,4.303921568627451
6433195,5,B00KKZ4K1A,As fun a show as I remember from when it first aired.  Good quality DVD's.,1466380800,,74,3.933333333333333

6433199,5,B00KKZ4K1A,"I waited forever for this to come out on DVD.  It's a shame that these sets are so pricey, but they have a small target audience so it's understandable.  The video quality on these sets is excellent.  As I also said in my review of the Time Trax DVD sets, I'm sure that these episodes were not digitally remastered but they honestly look like they were.  I watch these on a CRT TV and the picture quality is head and shoulders above broadcast quality back in the day.  If you were a fan of this show back in the 90's, then this is totally worth picking up.  The price is on the high side, but it's still cheaper than taking a family of 4 out to the movies.",1464048000,,656,4.0859375

The writing is a bit hit and miss, altho' I have some favorites. My biggest disappointment was the very poor job done for makeup. It is so obvious the bald look for the temple is a cap & not blended well at all. I find that very distracting.",1457827200,,413,4.111111111111111

6433216,5,B00KKZ4K1A,"I waited a long time to get my hands on this Kung Fu series. Carradine and the old man called the Ancient make the series very enjoyable. The idiot playing the son of Caine doesn't add anything to the series. He's just a lousy actor. All the other actors, however, make up for the problem and the series is well worth the money. You won't be disappointed.",1443398400,,355,4.313432835820896

6433218,5,B00KKZ4K1A,"I am so happy that this first season and the second season of KF:TLC is now available on dvd. For awhile there I thought this show would be the only tv show in history not released on dvd!  I remember watching it during it's original run and loving the father/son bond between Caine and his long-lost son.  I may be a bit caught up in the nostalgia of it, admittedly, but--Say what you will about the cheesiness of the series--and yeah, it was made in the nineties, so there's mullets and big hair, wide shoulder pads, stupid car chases and lots of shoot outs and badly staged and executed kung fu fights, stilted dialogue, and some really lame writing--but what makes this series so unique is both the Zen philosophy taught and the chemistry between Chris Potter (Peter) and David Carradine. Very loving, gentle and demonstrative. There was a really nice progression of their relationship over the course of the show.

I'm hoping that that the other two seasons of the show will eventually also be released (even if the ending did break all our hearts!)",1440374400,5,1054,4.655913978494624
6433219,5,B00KKZ4K1A,"Love that this series is finally getting released!  I loved this show when it was on tv.  It is totally cheesy but it is so fun to watch!  The acting is so so but if you are looking for some mindless entertainment this is super fun. Keep in mind that these releases as not a mass produced release from WB but are instead a type of on demand release, so you will not find this in the store.  The quality doesn't suffer though and all discs worked just as expected.",1439856000,,463,4.111111111111111

Wouldn't be horrible I suppose, but the background noise is louder than the actors.  They must have been shy.  Packaging and video are good.  The episodes are good.  The volume is a no star.

6433226,5,B00KKZ4K1A,"Not so much a review of the series as a review of the DVD itself. When I started watching it, I got about halfway through the first episode and then it started pixilating. Some episodes I was able to view completely, others I had to skip scenes because of the pixilation. By the time I finished watching everything I had ordered in this shipment, it was too late to send it back. But the series itself is great; I am a ""Kung Fu"" fan. However, my viewing pleasure was not what it should have been because of the faulty discs.",1435017600,5,524,4.25

6433231,5,B00KKZ4K1A,"I particularly loved the show for the philosophy.  It is spot on.  David Carradine became a real Shaolin Priest to play the role in both series. The stories were understandable without being simplistic.  But at the same time  were very sophisticated.  I read some years back  from a couple of different sources that the character of the ""ancient,"" in the scenes of him sparring and throwing each other with David Carradine's character, that really was him, not a stunt double. They did some incredibly amazing things we could not even imagine, But were fascinated by how a microwave could heat up a cup a tea. It was good entertainment but also soft, gentle, vulnerable with love, patience, integrity and self discipline. While at the same time displaying an understanding of infinite power and its capabilities within one self and the surrounding universe.

6433237,2,B00KKZ4K1A,"I just want to point that this line by Donna A: "" These stories are so much better then the original Kung Fu series by far"" is about as wrong as it can be. In the original series - except for the introduction of a supernatural element in the third season - he was just this simple priest wandering around the American West, helping people in trouble and always leaving behind an impression as the result of the Ancient Chinese Wisdom that was instilled in him as a young boy growing up in the Shao-Lin Temple, while searching for the brother he learned he had, and avoiding the bounty hunters who would love to cash in on the $10,000 reward offered by the Chinese government for his capture, because he had killed the Emperor's nephew. In the Legend Continues, they introduced stupidity in the form of physically impossible feats that the latter Kwai Chang Caine is able to pull off. I haven't bought this yet, and I'm sure I will to add it to my collection, but I remember one episode where he pulls the old trick of tossing a rock to make a sound to draw a pursuers attention to the wrong direction. Only in this case, he doesn't toss a rock, he wiggles his fingers, and across the clearing, the leaves rustle. My first thought was 'why did they have to ruin this with such stupidity.' In another, he demonstrates some sort of ability to direct the force of his energy into a stack of bricks by selecting a specific brick, let's say the fourth one down, and breaking only that brick by hitting the top of the stack a certain way. Maybe I could buy that one with some imagination, but later in the show, when he and his son are after a gang of robbers or some such, led by a wild young woman who cares about not much, she is standing on the other side of a wall from Caine, and he feels the wall, selects a spot, puts his hand on it, and lifts his palm about an inch and presses down. On the other side of the wall, the chick goes flying as if hit by a sledge hammer and across the room into a bunch of racks that come crashing down on top of her. Again I could only wonder why they would ruin such a good idea as the original show was built on. They did the same thing with the return of Mission Impossible where they hooked up electrodes to a dead person's head and read their last thoughts in order to view on a screen a murder that person had witnessed. They did the same thing with the show Fringe, which was garbage from the start. No, the best Kung Fu shows were the first two seasons of the original series that actually left you thinking and wondering about things in general.",1427241600,6,2586,4.247464503042596

6433239,5,B00KKZ4K1A,"This one of my favorite shows ever, & one of the best of the 90's.

""Heroism is simply a matter of facing the truth. One action can put everything in the proper place.""

 ""Like the jackal who mocks his prey, you use fear to intimidate. The weakness of the jackal is his arrogance, and arrogance is the downfall of anyone who subverts the truth.""

 As a teenager this was one of my favorite shows, & for what ever reason the franchise & series still resonates well with me today.  This is sort of a continuation of the classical 70's original ""Kung Fu"" series by Spielman and Carradine, where a direct ancestor of the hero searches in the modern world walking the Earth years after the sacred temple he had lived in was destroyed by Terrorists.  His young son was separated from him, and both believed the other had died in the attack.  Caine walks into Toronto and accidently runs into a tough young cop investigating a sinister Chinatown organized crime gang, who turns out to be Caine's lost son.

 As this unexpected and suddenly reunited event occurs, the two try to rebind their loving relationship over the series. The two develop their own dynamic crime fighting duo force, where the police officer son takes on Toronto's underworld thugs, while learning valuable Martial Arts and Asian inspired lessons from his father who is also going through his own challenge and magical spiritual journey.

 Along the way the father Caine finds a mysterious and mystically enchanting elderly Chinese Martial Arts wizard on the streets of Chinatown named, the Ancient.  We do not know if he is the same friend that was with Caine in the temple before their compound was attacked, we also do not know if this ""Yoda"" like individual is 800 years or not, but we assume he is almost immortal like ""Wolverine"" or Whoopi Goldberg's character in ""Star Trek"",  he can live a super long time.  This man holds the knowledge and has the ability to aid Caine and his Detective son in fighting the criminals, especially the super ""Martial Arts"" villains he occasionally runs into like the actor from ""Karate Kid"" who belongs to this evil hidden Chinese cult of Sorcerers that practice the style of ""Dim Mak- Kung Fu"".

 The first pilot episode was rated R, and was censored for American tv taking the brief nudity out of it, but the rest of the episodes are PG at best.  The show features Five Animal Shaolin Kung Fu techniques, with some Kempo Karate, Aikido, and Jujitsu on occasion but compared with other martial arts movies or shows it is fairly tame in comparison.  Some of the fight scenes come off as silly but this show in general is fun and entertaining.

 What I love is the character of Qwi Jang Caine, the reason this series interests me still and sticks out over most other movies and shows is Caine is a man with little to no money.  He wanders the Earth with only the clothes on his back yet holds extreme intelligence, altruism, decency, humility, respect, and inner wisdom in every behavior he engages in and every step he takes in life.  Unlike other heroes, Caine holds no character flaw about his soul, philological profile, and his demeanor for he is simply a man above 90% of the other men on Earth espousing nothing but true human goodness where even honest regular everyday men in life cannot adhere toward even on a good day.

 Caine seeks only to heal, to care for, to rescue, and to love his fellow man and asks NOTHING in return.  Unlike the fictional characters of ""Batman"" or Charles Bronson in ""Death Wish"", Caine has no drive to seek out violent criminals and hurt them, he uses the exact force needed to stop them and nothing more. Unlike Hugh Jackman's ""Wolverine"" or Clint Eastwood, Caine holds no cynical view on life nor does he desire to show others how tough he is, even though he has superior skills to even the toughest street brawler around the city. Unlike Shatner's ""Captain Kirk"", Caine has no macho bravado nor does he lust for women.  Unlike ""Conan the barbarian"", Caine has no lust for gold, and unlike the late Bruce Lee with his fictional characters, Caine has no desire for vengeance acting in grace in regards to everything he does.

  The character of his son on the other hand is more portrayed like a ""Lethal Weapon Mel Gibson"" type, who is a tough guy hot head actively seeking a fight with the low lives of this world, and shows little restraint that he must learn from both his father and the Ancient during the series.

 Excellent show, and rest in peace David Carradine.  ""To look into darkness is clarity. You must use the source of your own inner light to illuminate what cannot be seen."" - Caine",1425772800,3,4641,4.6207317073170735

6433247,5,B00KKZ4K1A,"Loved this show and thrilled to see Season One finally released on DVD.  This is a no-frills set - no extras, no inserts, nothing - just the complete first season and I'm happy to have it.  That said, I'd recommend viewing the episodes in a different order than what is presented on the DVDs.  I don't recall where I first heard of this different order, but viewing it this way makes more sense - it shows the progression of the father/son relationship and the development of Peter's kung fu skills in a more linear fashion.  This order was fairly common knowledge among Fu Fans back in the day.  The order is:  Initiation (Pilot); The Lacquered Box; Sunday At The Hotel With George; Force Of Habit; I Never Promised You A Rose Garden; Secret Place; Sacred Trust; Pai Gow; Shaman; Shadow Assassin; Dragon's Eye; Rain's Only Friend; Reunion; Challenge; Disciple; Blind's Eye; Illusion; Straight Jacket; Dragon's Wing; Redemption 1 & 2.

As for the nudity mentioned in another review - it is only in the Pilot episode.  Not sure why they chose to have it in this release as it did not air as such in the U.S.  The nudity is women dancing in the background of some bar scenes.  It adds nothing to the show but it is there and it is noted on the back of the DVD box.",1420416000,26,1262,4.447826086956522
6433248,5,B00KKZ4K1A,"As a fan who watched the show when it originally aired and (im)PATIENTLY waited and waited and waited - did I mention waited for this to come out on dvd, I was not disappointed. David Carradine stars as Kwai Chang Caine, the grandson of his character in the original Kung Fu series from the 1970s. This time around he is joined by his street smart, wise cracking cop son played by Chris Potter. Seperated (believed dead) when a renegade preist named Tan destroyed their Shaolin temple, they are reunited 15 years later.

There are a myriad of AMAZING secondary characters including The Ancient (Lo Si), Kermit Griffin, Captain Blaisdell and a very underrated coroner character Nicky Elder. There are some excellent villains as well, Tan, George. It also amassed an impressive list of guest stars - Patrick Macnee, Robert Vaughn, Kate Trotter. The storyline in the premier tells a great backstory and sets up what will be recurring theme of flashbacks throughout the entire series. The ""lessons"" from the temple will carry through this season and all others. This is very much a show about relationships and is excellent at that aspect. The Kung Fu is not spectacular and the effects can be cheesy at times, but even after all these years, it made my heart glad to see Caine and the gang back together again and I will buy every single season as soon as released.",1420156800,23,1362,4.746835443037975
6433249,2,B00KKZ4K1A,"I enjoyed the Kung Fu series in the seventies and was happy to see it come out on dvd.  I also enjoyed Kung Fu The Legend Continues in the nineties, but I am quite disappointed with Warner's season one dvd edition.  I could share the seventies series with my children and grandchildren, but since they placed nudity in the scenes of the nineties, it is not fit for children.  The original was an excellent tv series.  David Carradine could carry the entire show by himself.  Having such an outstanding actor like Carradine, they didn't need nudity in the dvd to sell it.  The nudity does NOT in any way enhance the story line--it detracts from it and ruins it.  I hope Warner isn't planning nudity in any future seasons of Kung Fu TLC if they put the other seasons on  dvds.  I wish they would consider leaving out the nudity and reconsider remaking the first season without the nudity for those of us who don't appreciate such junk and enjoyed the original tv series without the nudity.  The series originally taught  high morals and values and by putting nudity in the scenes, Warner has contradicted what the series originally represented--a continuation of teaching high morals and values.  I gave it only two stars because of the nudity.  If it had been like the original series, I would have gladly given it five stars.  I loved the original series.

And speaking of nudity, they certainly hired ugly women for the scenes--women with big, wide behinds and breasts like a nursing sow--and that is an unpleasant sight to behold!!!!",1419897600,,1535,4.696629213483146

8659607,4,B00KKZ4K1A,"It's fun revisiting this series, with an aging David Carradine reprising his really marvelous 1970s role as Kwai Chang Caine, the mixed-raced boy who became a Shaolin Kung Fu master.  Toronto, where ""The Legend Continues"" was filmed, was experiencing an incredibly cold winter and the actors spent a lot of time being quite uncomfortable while filming.  While the writing in this second series is ok, the plots for episodes about Kwai Chang Caine's grandson (David  Carradine) lack the substance of the earlier original series, made when Carradine was in his 30s.  Despite the actor's personal life, which went from bad--  a miserable childhood and youth, to a chaotic, unstructured, and drug-ridden adulthood.  Carradine had at least four wives plus  live-in girlfriends.  His life went from worse to worst-- an apparently accidental auto-erotic death in Thailand though this is highly questionable and one of his wives claims he was murdered in a robbery.

David Carradine was nonetheless a gifted actor, and the part of Kwai Chang Kaine in the original series was a brilliant piece of acting by any standard.  Though it was lampooned on TV comedy shows at the time, in the original series the writers really did include some good Daoist teaching and the plots of each episode were faithful to the Dao philosophy.  Typically for him, in the second series, Carradine brings in a real-life family member in ""The Legend Continues"" just as he did in ""Kung Fu.""  Considering his actual childhood and youth, this was certainly very forgiving of him, and quite poignant in fact, since he seemed to be trying to create the loving family around himself that he did not have in actuality.

 In ""The Legend Continues,""  his real-life daughter Calista, the oldest of Carradine's three children, plays the character of ""Cheryl,"" a street-wise girl who begins to solve her personal problems with the disciplined and introspection of the martial art style known as Kung Fu.  With the original ""Kung Fu"" series in the 1970s, Carradine's performance awakened an interest in Eastern religions, particularly Dao and Buddhism.

 In addition to making the hitherto unknown martial art of kung fu a household word, the original series actually began a national craze that saw young people in search of some meaning in their lives, as well as older tourists streaming to India and China to try to learn more about both Dao and Buddhism, and to see the suddenly famous Shaolin temple for themselves.  It has since become a major tourist attraction in China, to the point where the Marxist government was forced from sheer embarrassment to leave it alone after persecuting the monks for decades before the original Kung Fu series began in America.

Carradine made other Kung Fu-based movies, but nothing ever reached the technical, artistic, and philosophical heights of the original Kung Fu series.  Some of ""The Legend Continues"" is just plain silly, and Carradine is no longer young, handsome, or supple in this series.  But for martial arts fans and people who want something a little different, or who appreciate David Carradine as an actor, will enjoy the second series.  Unfortunately the original 1970s Kung Fu series ended after three seasons because Carradine had suffered a number of injuries doing the stunts himself along with the martial arts that are inherently dangerous; and breaking his foot was the last straw for him.  It was also clear that the writers of Kung Fu were likewise running out of good plot ideas.

The second series, ""The Legend Continues,"" gets a big boost from one of Canada's hockey stars, Nathaniel Moreau, who plays Kwai Chang Caine's son Peter, long separated from his father.  The son has become a policeman, so quite a bit of the story lines in each episode can be considered more police fiction than martial arts.  Writers for the second series obviously weren't really all that familiar with either Dao or Buddhism, and the episode where Kwai Chang Caine gets to Shambala is really far-fetched.  Nonetheless, ""The Legend Continues"" is not without its good moments, and some great humor.  In real life during the filming, Carradine was continuing on his path to self-destruction, trashing his hotel rooms, drinking heavily, and causing other problems in Toronto.  But the series is still enjoyable in itself for anyone who likes martial arts, David Carradine's acting, police fiction, and a different twist on an both police and martial arts movies that are, except for this series, predictable and boringly alike, just as Hollywood  westerns had deteriorated into predictable horse operas until the 1970s ""Kung Fu"" made-for-TV program burst upon the American scene.

David Carradine really did make social history in the 1970s with the first series, ""Kung Fu.""  The fact something that should really be studied for its unforeseen but very real consequences, but so far has not been.  Besides that, he was an extremely good actor who was the perfect choice for the character he played in the original series.  He brought his fractured life to the character of Kwai Chang Caine the original series, resulting in a sensitive and innovative performance of a half-Chinese, half-American young man in search of a family in the Old West while trying to live up to the purity and vision of his Daoist monastic masters.  ""Kung Fu"" actually mirrored Carradine's own far from happy real life in a some unexpected ways, but made for a great series nonetheless.  Too bad it was at the expense of an actor who was capable of a great performance, but whose real life was marred by personal problems and failings.  His acting legacy, however, speaks for itself in the original  Kung Fu series, a case where his art will live on for decades, and we can only mourn what might have been had he been able to get his life in order to take on even more serious dramatic roles.  Rest in peace, David; you were more sinned against than sinning, and you gave the world an unforgettable character to enjoy, study, and learn from.",1530835200,,6024,4.973053892215569
