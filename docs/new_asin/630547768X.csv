There aren't any great fights in this one, except possibly the chase between Ken and Jackal, and the assassin in the forest. Still, fans of martial arts and anime itself should buy this. There are no problems with the dubbed version this time- it's pretty good in this one. Still, grab the subtitled one if you can.",992908800,,506,4.761363636363637
