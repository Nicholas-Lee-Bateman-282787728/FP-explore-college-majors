1989907,4,B0001CNPLI,"""Shogun Assassin"" is actually a combining of two Japanese movies for American release that bring to the screen a story that has long been very popular in Japan (aka ""Lone Wolf and Cub"").

  Some may recognize the title ""Shogun Assassin"" from the movie ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"".  In that story, it is the movie that mother and daughter watch together at bedtime. How sweet. Tarantino is, no doubt, both making a joke and giving a nod to what is one of the bloodiest of all Samaurai movies, a genre known for its high splatter factor.

  I first saw this movie in the 80's and am happy it is now available on DVD.  I recommend it highly to any fan of Samaurai movies for its clever story line, customized baby carriage and over-the-top sword fighting sequences.  It may not be high-brow, but it is must-see!",1118534400,15,799,4.493055555555555
1989908,4,B0001CNPLI,"Unlike what some of the other reviews have stated, this is not spliced together episodes from a Japanese tv show. Actually, it is spliced from the first two (there are six in the series) Lone Wolf and Cub movies: Sword of Vengeance and Baby Cart at the River Styx. It is also not a kung fu film because for one thing, kung fu is a martial art form from China and this movie is from Japan and is involving samurai (who don't practice kung fu).

Unfortunately, taking two movies and cutting them down to one movie half as long hurts the story of the films. In the original films, the Shogun didn't just up and decide that he was threatened by Ogami Itto and decide to kill his family. The story is more involved and the viewer has a much stronger emotional connection with the characters of the story when watching the original versions of the film in two separate parts.

Also, the Lone Wolf and Cub series has seen a recent release onto DVD by AnimEigo and the picture and sound quality on these new DVD transfers is astounding when compared to this film. It literally looks as if it is a recent release instead of a film from the 70s. Additionally, these DVD releases contain the original Japanese audio tracks (matched with the AnimEigo's superb subtitles) not a horrible English dubbing as contained in Shogun Assassin.

All this combined, it is impossible for me to recommend this film over the originals to anyone. Granted, they both still contain ridiculous blood spurting and great swordplay and you'll still have a good time watching either Shogun Assassin or the original Lone Wolf and Cub movies but Shogun Assassin is just inferior. However, if (and only if) you really hate subtitles in your movies, then Shogun Assassin might be the way to go.

The Lone Wolf and Cub films themselves are based off of a classic manga; partly released by the same name in the US by Action Comics. More recently, Dark Horse Comics released it in its entirety in a 28 vol. (8,000+ pages) series. The story is more fleshed out and much more involved in the manga and the artwork is incredible. Anyone who enjoys the Lone Wolf and Cub films would be doing themselves a favor by checking them out. It should be noted to anyone who has seen the movie series to its ""conclusion"", that the manga does has an appropriate ending unlike that of the film series and its conclusion is more than satisfying.",1094515200,68,2388,4.572429906542056
1989909,5,B0001CNPLI,"Shogun Assassin is a movie spliced together from episodes of a Japanese television show from the seventies called Sword of Vengence (single episodes of which are now available on DVD) that have been dubbed with English and given a voice over narration by Ogami Itto's son.  The television show is based on a comic book series from Japan called Lone Wolf and Cub(these are now available in the states from Dark Horse Comics).  This is a squel to Lightning Swords of Death which has been assembled from the television show the same way.  A lot of people say it was banned in the eighties.  I don't know if that's true, but it has certainly been out of print for the better part of two decades, as can be seen by the price this thing goes for used.

The story is of a samurai, Ogami Itto, employed by an evil shogun to behead the enemies of the shogun.  The shogun becomes worried that Ogami is going to kill him, so he sends assassins to kill Ogami.  Makes sense so far.  They succeed in only killing his wife.  As anyone who has been watching movies for any time will know, if you kill a man's wife, he immediately becomes a psychotic killer out for your blood.  The interesting twist here is that Ogami decides to take his two-year-old son on his path of vengence.  Ogami's son rides around either in a backpack or in a baby cart equipped with all manner of hide out weapons which are all sharper than razors.

It should be said that, contrary to opinions of Quentin Tarrantino, this is no movie for children.  There is some nudity and blood by the gallons.  Apparently during the time period of shogunate Japan the circulatory system of the human body was under immense pressure.  People get hit with swords and the blood sprays out like it's coming from a garden hose with your thumb over the end.  The sword fight in Kill Bill with the Crazy 88 made me immediately think of this film, only toned down slightly.  There are beheadings and limbs chopped off, one guy even gets turned into nothing more than a stump with a head (sans ears and a portion of his scalp).  People get hit with all manner of edged and blunt instruments.  In other words, if you want to see people sustaining traumatic injuries delivered by the weaponry of medieval Japan, this movie is for you - if you can find it.",1094083200,12,2292,4.440191387559809
1989910,4,B0001CNPLI,"I don't see why this film has been banned since 1983, but damn there was alot of victims at the hands of the assassin. The child's voice as the narritive was a good touch, it gave the movie a kind of serious tone. Shogun Assassin is just a portion of a series in the lone wolf and cub series, but the most bloody, so try to check out all Lone Wolf and Cub movies to get the full feel.",1093910400,2,384,3.8734177215189876
1989911,5,B0001CNPLI,"I really think this movie is great!  It's my favorite martial arts / action film (aside from Bruce Lee movies).  And unfortunately it's not appropriate for children.  If one is into these kinds of movies and don't mind gushing blood they HAVE to watch it.  My dad collected martial art movies when I was a child (I'm 35 now) and I used to watch this movie over and over with my brothers.  When the reference was made to Shogun Assassin in Kill Bill 2 I nearly choked on my popcorn in the movie theater.  I heard only one other gasp from another patron from across the theatre, so I guess it's safe to say not many people have watched this film, and thought how unfortunate.  I was lucky to catch the series playing on the international channel about a year ago.  And since watching Kill Bill I've decided to purchase the DVD series.",1085529600,3,832,4.392156862745098

Shogun Assassin is just the first part of the many films in the Lone Wolf series, and the best! The film was BANNED SINCE 1983 in the UK, and the most bloody of the series. There are 2 parts to Shogun Assassin, so if you just get the first one you will be left hanging.
Basiclly, HE WHIPS OUT HIS SWORD AND RELIEVES HIS VICTIMS OF THEIR HEADS AND LIMBS!! THE BLOOD GUSHES OUT ALL OVER THE SCREEN - AS IF BEING HOSED INTO THE CAMERA!
Yea, This film is Pretty violent, it reminds me of Kill Bill Vol 1. Shogun was some of QT's insperation to Kill Bill and he included some of it in Vol. 2. Shogun Assassin tells the story of Lone Wolf a powerful and feared ""Masterless"" samurai who lives a peaceful existence with his wife and his son. When he refuses to swear allegiance to Kurando the most vicious Shogun in Japanese history, Kurando orders the death of Lone Wolf's wife Azame. Lone Wolf vows to avenge her death, taking his son Tizuro with him on the path to darkness and retribution. Soon Lone Wolf's sword of vengeance is unleashed upon many victims,including the evil Shogun's son and the legendary ""Masters of Death"".
If you have ever heard the Wu Tang, GZA albulm ""liquid swords"" you would of heard many samples that came from this movie. This movie is pretty good, (considering its not kung fu.)Very entertaining, and the kid is pretty cute, watch for the part when he counts the victims, pretty funny...Tomisaburo Wakayama plays the Lone Wolf.",1084406400,6,1563,4.546099290780142
1989913,5,B0001CNPLI,"Tarantino loves this movie as do I! A bloody, gushing, ultra-violent shogun film released in 1980 (dubbed in English) in the USA as a drive-in style limited release. It quickly became a cult
classic and the first time I saw it was late-night Showtime around 1981. Anyway, in KILL BILL VOL.2, you can hear the voice-over of the child-warrior in the background as Uma Thurman watches the film with her small daughter. David Carradine (Bill)
then says, ""Oh, no. It's too violent!"" and exits the bedroom. This is a very rare video and has been out of print for a long time. I highly reccomend it and give it 5 out of 5 stars.  Shot entirely on location in Japan. Bloody good fun!",1083456000,,675,4.487804878048781

1989961,5,B0001CNPLI,"Tom Hanks - Road to Perdition is based on this film. Tarantino inspiration.
Some compare Shogun Assassin and Flashing Swords (part two or technically part three of Lone Wolf) with Lone Wolf and Cub, I would not. View it as a stand-alone picture. If not for this film, most people wouldn't know about LWC at all, myself included. There are lots of people that won't watch sub-titled movies and this is a great english introduction to get them into the whole mythos. I saw this in the seventies at a grind-house in Oakland, CA and it never left my mind. Jump ahead 10 years later and I find the American release of the comics and soon the entire manga series and the rest of the films on VHS from Animego. I own original posters from Japan, english and Japanes manga, you name it, I've collected it - obsessively! I almost forgot, full back tattoo, 1/4 sleeves and chest scallops ala yakuza style, all LWC themed.",1453939200,,911,4.527272727272727

1990041,5,B0001CNPLI,"Shogun Assassin is a favorite 80s guilty pleasure that was actually edited together from the first two films of a classic Japanese movie series called Lone Wolf And Cub. The film was then dubbed in English and given a new synthesizer score and released by Roger Cormans New World Pictures. The film tells of a master samurai (Tomisaburo Wakayama) who is betrayed by his crazed Shogun and marked for death. During an assassination attempt, his wife is killed and now he travels the Japanese countryside with his toddler son, Daigoro, working as a sword for hire and constantly battling the Shoguns sons and scores of ninja sent to kill him. Shogun Assassin is a deliriously fun and blood soaked roller coaster ride that is about 10% plot and 90% fight scenes as Lone Wolf continuously is set upon by the Shoguns killers and their subsequent and gruesome dispatching by his sword. Especially amusing are a squad of sexy female ninja, Lone Wolfs showdown with The Brothers Of Death and the fact that Daigoros baby carriage has more weapons then James Bonds Astin Martin. The action is fast and furious and filled with spurting blood and flying limbs and is a real blast. Now considered one of the greatest exploitation films of all time, and it is a title this wildly entertaining sword and samurai flick rightfully deserves. A real blast I was fortunate enough to see in a theater with a rambunctious audience back in 1980. The 30th Anniversary blu-ray from AnimEgo is an absolutely gorgeous re-mastering and a wonderful way to enjoy this cult classic!",1386720000,5,1550,4.830827067669173

I have seen comments, by some fans, stating that this movie was made for the English-speaking audience; the comments were defensive arguments against the accusation of this movie being dubbed. I don't agree with those arguments because the scenes in this movie are exactly (I mean exactly) the same scenes from the original Japanese movie. This is not a movie shot from scratch for the English audience. I find this to be a cheap way of making money by editing the scenes from the first 2 original Japenese movie and by dubbing it in English.

Blu-ray quality is not even that good. Ok, so it is much better than the standard version but it is not remastered; there are very visible noise that needs to be cleaned up.

But I have to say, those DVDs have better resolution and color than the Shogun Assassin movies in this collection. That's my technical complaint.

As for movies, any potential buyer should be aware that these movies are intended for those who love cheesy dubbed Asian action movies. There is no Japanese audio track. There are no subtitles. Shogun Assassin was a recut/reinvention of two Lone Wolf and Cub movies, made for the American audiences. We're talking B movies way way way down in the Bs. If you like samurai movies, like the Samurai Trilogy, Yojimbo, Hari Kiri, 47 Ronin, Zatoichi movies, then this collection is NOT for you!

I regret buying this collection mainly because I didn't realize what I was getting. That was my mistake. However, I am surprised at the lower quality of the film footage. One would expect a Blu-ray mastering to have better results than older DVD transfers of essentially the same footage. I suppose the SA films are already 2 or more film generations from what might be available for LWAC, so maybe this is the best they could have done.

1990117,4,B0001CNPLI,"Many others have noted the unique place of these films in exploitation and Japanese cinema, and how fun they are.  I rented the original DVDs and watched them with the excellent Animeigo subtitles.  Unfortunately, these are the English versions, dubbed only, which is doubly frustrating for the hard-of-hearing (as far as I can tell no subtitles are available in English either).
As explained on their website:

""Because Shogun Assassin was created by editing together LW&C 1 and 2, there are only 5 Shogun Assassin films: Shogun Assassin (LW&C 1 and 2), Shogun Assassin 2: Lightning Swords of Death (LW&C 3) and Shogun Assassin 3-5 (LW&C 4-6).

Our release of the Shogun Assassin films uses the same high-quality masters as the LW&C films. In the case of Shogun Assassin, we took the original film and replaced each cut with the corresponding one from the HD masters.

All the Shogun Assassin films are English-language only; there is no Japanese soundtrack or subtitles. ""

All that being said, while I was surprised and disappointed by the lack of the original Japanese and soundtrack, the picture is superb.  The dubbing is not that bad either, but the liner notes are accessed through ""special features"" rather than as an integral part of the subtitles as usual.  For compactness and picture clarity, this set gets a near excellent, but for those who would prefer original language and soundtrack, for now the only option is to stick with the DVD set, as Animeigo explains they aren't keen to do many blu ray due to the cost involved and the limited market.  Let's hope this will change for them, as I really love the way they do their subtitles.  I also hope all those who usually comment on foreign language films how they hate subtitles will make this a sold-out set, but somehow I doubt these usually vocal critics will step up to the plate.",1337472000,5,1850,4.807570977917981

""Shogun Assassin"" destroy's the EPIC FEEL and critical powerful details of the first two films seen in their original full-length glory.

However, my point is, if you are going to make what should be a  definitive collectors version on BLU-RAY for the die hard ""Lone Wolf"" fans, you shouldn't go cheap and leave out the first two movies by substituting them with a sub-standard edited version that already came out on the market.

1990134,4,B0001CNPLI,"I'll never forget when I first watched Shogun Assassin. When I worked at a movie store, there was a regular customer who was always asking me about samurai and martial arts films. One day he came in with his own copy of Shogun Assassin, saying that I had to watch it since it was one of his all-time favorites. I watched it that same day and have never looked at samurai movies the same ever since. While Shogun Assassin is usually considered 'just' a B-film with over the top gore, I was mesmerized by the swordsmanship of Tomisaburo Wakayama. He made everything look so effortless, and if I didn't know any better, I'd have guessed that he was actually killing people! Eventually I learned that Shogun Assassin was actually the first two films in the Lone Wolf and Cub movie series but edited to move things along faster, and with a more modern soundtrack. Of course, I ended up watching all 6 Lone Wolf and Cub movies, though only the first three won me over. A lot of hardcore fans hate Shogun Assassin for 'ruining' Lone Wolf and Cub, but I don't think they understand that if it weren't for Shogun Assassin, a lot of people wouldn't have even known about Lone Wolf and Cub in the first place, outside of Japan at least.

Ogami Itto is the Shogun's executioner, and a master swordsman. He quits after being tired of the corrupt Shogun, and as a result, the Shogun sends a group of ninjas and kills Itto's wife. His infant son, Daigoro, is then given the choice of joining his mother, or going along with Ogami on the path of vengeance. Ogami sits in front of Daigoro with a ball and his sword, and whichever Daigoro goes for will determine his fate. Well, you know how cool shiny objects are to kids...Daigoro goes for the sword, and everything is set in stone. Ogami is ordered to commit seppuku before the Shogun's men, but defies them and takes them all out with the greatest of ease. He manages to construct a baby stroller for Daigoro as well, full of all kinds of weapons that will help them both out against their enemies. This is all just the beginning of a long blood bath.

To be honest, the movie is pretty much just a collection of Ogami Itto slicing and dicing bad guys [and girls], with very little emphasis on the plot. Since it's a cut up version of two movies, cramming the plot from both of those would've been hard to do, so they went with most of the action scenes, with an added narration by Daigoro which I actually like. The kills are over the top, with heads being split in half, limbs flying all over the place, and a neck-cutting scene that makes most people cringe. As I said earlier, Wakayama is incredible to watch, especially given that he's a little on the heavy side, but doing front flips like it's nobody's business and swinging his dotanuki sword as fast as say, anyone who's every played Zatoichi. The baby cart is a star in itself, with knives, spears and more being concealed within the handle and sides, though there's an even cooler weapon that isn't featured here, and you'll have to watch the Lone Wolf movies to see it in action. There's something here for everyone, and Shogun Assassin is essentially a sampler of the Lone Wolf movies. If you like what you see here, but want plot too, go watch the Lone Wolf movies or read the comic series. If there's anything I have to dock points for it's that they could've edited a few scenes better. That strangely long scene of Itto cutting into a guy's head as the hat and head split apart very, very, very, very slowly could've been trimmed. 'same with the scene where he's ambushed by ninjas in the woods. That scene always bugged me for some reason.

The picture and audio quality of the blu-ray are probably as good as we're going to get, unless they somehow have the team that restored The Wizard of Oz work on it. The picture is sharp and crisp, but there's still a lot of grain, lines and other things. It definitely looks better than any of the dvd releases that've come out. You can even see this for yourself in the special features where they compare this to a bootleg and the official dvd. As far as the audio goes, it gets the same great treatment, though it's a Linear PCM 2.0 mix. There is no Japanese audio option, just the English dub. Some people have complained about this but I don't understand why as this is Shogun Assassin...not the original movies it's cut from.

The special features are solid, with stuff for hardcore and casual fans alike. You get two commentary tracks: one with Ric Meyers and Steve Wilson and one with Davis Weisman, Jim Evans and Gibran Evans. The first track with Ric and Steve covers the sword fights, martial arts and Japanese tradition, and is very informative for those wondering about some techniques used in the movie. I'd like to say that Ric redeems himself here, after the embarrassment in the Kung Fu Hustle dvd interview he did a few years back. The other track is more about editing the movie to make it accessible for everyone, and how it came to be. It was cool to hear from Gibran, who voiced Daigoro when he was just seven. Next is an interview with Samuel L. Jackson, and while it's a laid back interview, I don't get why they chose to interview him for this, as all he does is talk about how much he loves Shogun Assassin, and the theater he used to go to as a kid that would always play cheap martial arts movies. I'll give him some credit though for pointing out a few things that viewers might not notice, like how Itto gave Daigoro a certain look in the well scene to figure out how deep it was and how much danger Daigoro was in. There are also program notes about the HD remastering, and a cool Restoration Gallery where you can see the improvement in picture quality from the old dvd and bootlegs compared to this blu-ray. Finally is the infamous trailer that most people have seen.

Overall the blu-ray is definitely worth picking up. While I do like the first three Lone Wolf movies better, for their plot and the less dated soundtrack (the music here reminded me of Halloween 3: Season of the Witch's soundtrack), there's no denying that Shogun Assassin gets the job done. It was actually hard to review this since most people on this page have probably already seen the movie, and know what they're getting into.

The boy tells it hows it is  without  being naive or childlike. He has a calm and collected voice which demonstrates his understanding of the kill or be killed world he lives in,which sets a nice tone for the film. The dvd picture is of good quality. The dubbing is good, I've read that they used deaf lip readers to aid in the dubbing process.

This monumental classic IMO is best enjoyed as the original 6 episode ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" series also US released thru Animeigo which I would rate 5 stars for technical quality and accurate English translation subtitles.

The two audio commentaries are from the makers of Shogun Assassin, who re-edited it from the original Lone Wolf series.  This audio commentary is so-so interesting, and probably worth listening to for die hard fans.

The second audio commentary is with a Kung Fu Magazine film critic and a Kung Fu and Kendo master.  The film critic gives you every possible fact about this film, the decline of the Japanese film industry in the 1970s  and more than anybody could possible want to know.  Almost like a transcript of the day by day events that led to the folding of the studio.  The Kung Fu master, when he does speak only speaks about true meaning of the film as it relates to Earth, Wind, and Fire.  He is clearly put off by the film critic dominating the commentary, but when prompted to speak about technical aspects of the Sword,  fighting style, Martial art stances, etc,  he answers with philosophical aspects of earth, wind and or fire.  At the end of the film they both decide to just talk over each other.",1290643200,,1262,4.513274336283186
1990143,4,B0001CNPLI,"Shogun Assassin Blu-ray Review

Distributor: AnimEigo US

Never mind The Bride from Kill Bill, if you should find yourself embarking on a war against an army of crazed samurai killers, then Lone Wolf is the one warrior that you need on your side.

Originally taken from the Lone Wolf and Cub series, Shogun Assassin has built up a real cult following among various movie enthusiasts around the globe. From grind house theatres in the US, to one time video nasty status in the UK, the film has seen it's fair share of controversy over the years. At least two alternate edits of the film exist, including the original six part Lone Wolf / Baby Cart series and the Americanised movie version which splices together footage from two episodes and adds a brand new linking narration taken from the perspective of Lone Wolf's son Daigoro.

Previously released in the UK on video cassette and DVD, the film has always suffered from transfer problems including cropping and visible print damage. Released in 2006 in the US on DVD by the same distributor as this new Blu-ray release, the transfer was far superior to all other releases  and was widely thought to be the best the film would ever look. Rather surprisingly then, this Blu-ray release has had even more time and attention spent on it, easily making it the ultimate release of the film to date.

Shogun Assassin in it's 30th Anniversary Collectors Edition, marks the d&eacute;but Blu-ray release for the AnimEigo studio and to get the ultimate print of the film, they took original masters from the two Lone Wolf Episodes and re-edited them together to exactly match the movie as previously released. This process enabled the distributor to release a pristine wide-screen 1080p print of the film which is huge improvement over all previous releases. Although the distributor had also performed the same trick with their US DVD release, this is the first time that they were able to produce an HD master and the difference is easily noticeable. The new HD transfer is excellent throughout with background elements showing far more detail than ever before. Skin tones and colours are also strong with black levels also being impressive. Never before has the extreme bloodshed looked so  gloriously over the top, with reds gushing all over the screen in every angle conceivable.

As far as the audio is concerned, this movie was never going to present a sound effects fuelled extravaganza, however the dialogue is clean, crisp and free from distortion making Daigoro's narration seem all the more prominent and engrossing.

Extras here are also impressive. Exclusive to the Blu-ray release, there are a total of two audio commentaries. The first of which is with the films producer, the graphic designer and the voice actor for Daigoro himself. The second commentary track presents the thoughts of film scholar Ric Meyers and martial arts expert Steve Watson. Obviously there is a wealth of information available here, which should present even the greatest fans of the film with something new. Moving on from the commentaries, we are presented with a video interview with none other than Samuel L. Jackson who talks about his love for the film. Dating from his first initial viewing, to now modern day screenings, his genuine enthusiasm for movies of this kind is widely evident here.

All things considered, the Blu-ray release is definitely set to become the ultimate must own edition of the film. Whether or not the distributor will release the rest of the series on Blu-ray remains to be seen, however if their first step into the Blu market is anything to go by, they appear to be a company that puts a great deal of effort into their releases, so it will be interesting to see what follows. The only negative aspect concerning this Blu release is that it happens to be locked to Region A, further proof  if ever needed, that multi-region Blu-ray is the only way to go.

In summing up, the ultimate tag line for the movie is best left to Daigoro's own narration.

1990155,5,B0001CNPLI,"A defective samurai and his infant son must battle their way through hordes of ninjas and enemy warriors on the path to destroy their evil shogun leader. SHOGUN ASSASSIN is blood-soaked Japanese cinema at its best, taking the classic samurai Action/Adventure premise and pushing it to the limits of extreme violence and gore. The Americanized version of the film released in 1980 is actually an amalgamation of the first and second films from the LONE WOLF AND CUB series, removing much of the slower exposition from each in order to increase the rapid-fire action sequences. Wakayama's stern, calculated performance as the vengeful Ogami is one of the film's greatest strengths, lending credibility to the role even after much of the character's background had been stripped away. SHOGUN'S exaggerated comic book framing and fight choreography make every fight fresh and engaging, while the geysers of blood, severed heads, and flying limbs make this the perfect stepping stone to draw Horror purists into the excessive world of Asian action and gore that would inspire filmmakers like Quentin Tarentino for decades to follow.

And the guy that gave one star... you gotta be kidding me right? I damn for sure don't watch kung fu movies with the subtitles the dub is the only way to go it's just always been that way like in the late night kung fu cinema's downtown, yea not JAPANESE CINEMA it's KUNG FU cinema these are cult movies dude. However, films like Amelie or Delicatessen,Pan's Labyrinth or Variety lights the subtitles are necessary, it adds to the film's overall power. The Japanese language is beautiful like in seven samurai or yojimbo or sanjuro because those are epics and are considered JAPANESE CINEMA because they took it extremely serious like Jet li's Hero or fearless those are serious movies they need subtitles. The American stigma with kung fu is flicks is the dub and the action and occasional comic relief when the face doesn't really match the voice that's part of the fun. Almost all Kung fu movies are serious but These are not vast 207 minute in length movies they are action from top to bottom not meant to get Oscar's  or go into the criterion collection though some deserve it, (Come drink with me 36 Chambers of Shaolin) Just enjoy them for what they are.

1990157,5,B0001CNPLI,"First off, I love this film, its packed with non-stop action. And I don't mean the cheesy overdone Hollywood ""explosion every two seconds"" type action; rather the quirky, yet somehow epic 1970's-1980's era style of film.

What I love about it most is how it really feels like you are put in this guy's position. You worry about him and his son throughout the film. Lots of suspense prior to the fight scenes (which are about every 30 seconds to five minutes). You will be on the edge of your seat. And you actually see him spare a person (a woman). So you may begin to identify with the main character and his cute, innocent-looking little son.

Warning: If you don't think fake heads getting chopped off is funny and are way too concerned with a storyline other than ""revenge,"" then you probably won't like this film.",1264896000,3,818,4.557823129251701

I just wanted to point out some of the new special features in this new set that wasn't available in the individual releases. Besides being released in the new box that takes ups less space than the original five snap cases, audio commentary is provided by Ric Meyers (a film scholar) and Steve Watson (a martial arts expert) as well as a video interview with Scott Houle who did the audio dubbing for parts 3, 4 & 5. Note the commentary and video interview is only on part one (Shogun's Assassin). The video interview is about 31 minutes long as Scott Houle answers a series of questions about the technical aspects of film dubbing. The other four discs in the set appear to be indentical to the individual releases the were released earlier. Also, a 26-page booklet featuring an essay, making of interview, liner notes, cast bios, black & white photos as well as ""where are they now"" information. Any special features from the previous released discs are still in the new boxed set such as all the trailers, photo slide shows & production notes. All of the discs are stored in a five-fold cardboard insert that slides into the outer box (similiar to typical TV series DVD sets).

Or maybe it is because ""Shogun Assassin"" is just so cool.  The story is a simplified version of the original Lone Wolf and Cub series.  You still have the wandering swordsman with his killer baby, but this time they are only fleeing from ""The Shogun"" instead of any complex story of clan rivalry.  They are pursued by endless squads of ""ninjas"" which are handily and bloodily dispatched in grand style.  That's about it.  This is definitely the ""good parts"" version, and the fun comes from the endless swordfights and syntho soundtrack.

The violence here is over the top.  There is one scene where a female ninja proves her prowess by fighting a battle with the Shogun's top fighter, and she slowly slices him to pieces, first fingers, then ears, then feet.  It is a visual demonstration of the famous ""To the pain"" scene from The Princess Bride.  All of the scenes go like that.  No sword is drawn but body parts go flying.  Good times indeed.

1990166,4,B0001CNPLI,"Shogun Assassin (1980) is a remarkable movie that hasn't aged a
single day, since its release, amazingly. Starring ( the late)
Tomisaburo Wakayama, playing a samurai with the intriguing actress
Kayo Matsuo, the action unfolds in a paradoxical mix of tranquility /
love with brutality / horror.

First, Ogami the samurai begins a long trek with his 5 year old son
in a baby carriage, across rivers, forests, crop fields, and deserts
to an unknown destination, showing extraordinary endurance and
determination all that time.

Next, over the course of many miles, Ogami ""Lone Wolf"" has to defend
himself against wicked platoons sent to finish him off, fighting off
as well, Ninjas, on a mission to kill for which failing is not an
option, under the penalty of Hara Kiri.

The film is very stylish, the music  professional, perhaps slightly
overdoing it with the synth numbers reminiscent of ""Safety Dance""
from Men Without Hats, back in 1982, apparently using the same brand
music instrument. The presentation is a great wide-screen.

The surrealism of this picture, in some ways in the tradition of
Salvador Dali, is the case, and somewhat reminsicent of  ""The Passion
of Darkly Noon""- another work that contains frequent, intense horror.
The only difference are the  lethal scenes with blood packs going off
as a result of samurai hand to hand combats.

The benefit of a DVD release, is that the viewers won't have to hear
gasps, screams, shock, yelling that otherwise would apply in a public
theatre, such is the graphic nature of the special effects and the
overall ""Mad Max"" feel to it.

The action is apparently set circa 1300 to 1500, when gun powder
still wasn't widely used, perhaps set even earlier than that, due to
the lack of crossbows and arrows.

The actors chosen are intentionally ethnic Japanese in order to
better represent accurately the microcosm of this story to the
viewers.

The overall impact of this movie, is that it does constitute a dream
of sorts, a superb surrealism taking spectators in another space and
time, with a crystal clear film to DVD transfer. The downside is that
more than 1 viewer may ahbor the graphic combat scenes. The sets are
very credible, admirably chosen from a stylish, appealing aspect.

It should be noted that the work has 3  sequels to it.",1202515200,2,2295,4.884020618556701

A powerful shogun sends out minions to kill Lonewolf but can the one-man army deal with all of them himself?

One of the most violent and goriest movies of all time! This Japanese-American production is actually three films from the Japanese series ""LoneWolf and Cub"" into one movie and dubbed into English. A definite favorite of Quentin Tarantino as he used this movie as an inspiration to his ""Kill Bill"" movies, it's an entertaining and gory-as-hell is a visual action feast with some laughable English dubbing but the action is non-stop with heads being split open, slicing and dicing etc. I can see why this has got a cult following, you gotta see it to believe it.

1990171,5,B0001CNPLI,"Yes, it's recut, rewritten, rescored, dubbed, and chopped down from two separate films.  Yet even my Japanese friends agree: this version of ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" is better than the original Japanese films.  Here's why:

1)That fantastic score by Marc Lindsay (of Paul Revere & the Raiders fame), which absolutely blows away the original.

2) The brilliantly-written and witty script (""Those swine will butcher anyone who walks in their way!  It's just bad taste!"").  The highlight is  the narration of Daigoro, which is not found in the original.

3) A really first-rate dub.  (Even Daigoro's pronunciation of ""harakiri"" is accurate.)

4) Wall to wall action!  This is truly the ""good parts"" version of ""Sword of Vengeance"" and ""Baby Cart on the River Styx.""

5) Lone Wolf is actually a MUCH cooler customer in this version.  The American editors have gone through and carefully removed all of actor Tomisaburo Wakayama's over-the-top emotional reactions, creating virtually a new performance in the editing room.  This version of Lone Wolf is more self-possessed and calmly lethal than the original Japanese version.

That much said, there are two problems with Animeigo's presentation.  The lesser is the idiotic unremovable ""unrestored"" notice plastered over the opening shot of Himeji Castle, which could have been handled much less intrusively by a title card before the start of the film.

Far worse, though, is the image quality.  This version was constructed from Animeigo's transfers of the original films (also available on DVD), yet the picture quality is not nearly as sharp as the originals'.  It actually appears to be a generation down in quality.  After years of neglect and bootlegging, poor ""Shogun Assassin"" still can't get a break!",1174435200,35,1750,5.204301075268817

Lone Wolf and Cub is longer and much more conclusive.  I suppose you could also make this purchase to tide you over while saving up for the full set, haha.  If you are very compelled to know how it ends, there is a second Shogun Assassin, but as I said, there is also a larger series that has all of this and more, just not in English, which may be a disappointment to some.  There isn't really much moral plot to this, other than perseverance, but it's still an entertaining hour and a half of blood flying absolutely everywhere, as it says, ""It's impossible to keep a body count!""  I also highly recommend this as a gift for any loving parent to their 4-year-old (not really!), but it's enjoyable for the older crowd, as long as you don't have any reservations for mindless violence.  Once again, I will enforce, SPRING FOR """"""LONE WOLF AND CUB.""""""",1170720000,,1195,4.303571428571429

It's evident, while watching the story, why this movie so heavily influenced Quentin Tarrantino's Kill Bill series.  Thematically, it's all there: Revenge.  Cool samurai sword fights.  Lots of blood.  Just enough plot.  Since purchasing this DVD, I've introduced several people to it, and every person found it extremely entertaining.  As with most stories in this genre, the plot is somewhat hokey, and some of the dialouge is comical (although not intentionally so), but the fight scenes are over-the-top, and wonderfully crafted.  The cinematography in this movie is fantastic, as are the picture and sound quality.  Quite simply, if you like these kinds of movies, there is no way you won't like this one.

1990189,5,B0001CNPLI,"When I was a kid living in the suburbs of NYC, my Dad carted me and my brother to a small, out-of-the-way movie theater--we entered the darkened theater near the end of the film and as I looked up at the screen, I saw the image of a samurai warrier pounding his iron claw into the sand as the ground started to ooze red.  I was blown away.  We stayed for the next show and from the beginning with that crazy kid's narration track, you get sucked into a primal world where guys with wheelburrow size hats can kill with the greatest of ease.

This is an over-the-top, slugfest that hits the mark like nothing else on the home video horizon.  You've got your ninjas.  You've got your baby carriage with knives that pop out of the wheels to decapitate.  You've got your crazy female assasins who can run backwards and turn into a blip in a second and a half.  You've got so much crazy, wacked out fighting sequences that it defies logic.

Yes, absolutely the full Lone Wolf and Cub series is the way to go.  But, this baby is absolutely worth the time.  Think of it as the greatest hits splatter and slice tracks from the full-length episodes.  When I'm down and through with the way the real world works, this baby is the one I put in the old CD-player to get my head back to center.

So, if you've seen Kill Bill--then you know the scene at the end of KB2 where the Bride is laying down with her daughter in Bill's bed.  Originally, the video that she was going to watch was Disney's the Aristocats--as an homage to the Pulp Fiction days when Uma and QT dreamed up the revenge plot line.  Well, Disney wimped out and refused to grant permission.  So, you'll hear the soundtrack of our favorite chophouse film SHOGUN ASSASSIN play on the kid's tv set.  Nice choice.

Put a big check mark next to this one.  And, show your friends--but not their wives (unless they're really cool)...",1163030400,,1879,4.36599423631124
1990190,4,B0001CNPLI,"Without a doubt a genre classic, this compilation of the first and second episode of the Lone Wolf and Cub does it for me. The first reason is the all new digital transfer, bringing a new texture of picture and sound quality. Of course the english dubbing and sound effects are annoying, i'm myself an enemy of dubbing ANY kind of foreign title. But we can now see an enlarged widescreen edition, that shows a lot more in brightful colors and delicate ""drawing"" of the characters.
Because this is a compilation of 11 minutes of the sword of vengeance and 73 minutes of the river styxx, the english dubbing tells us a different story. In the original lone wolf series, the evil character with white beard is the leader of a ninja clan, but here he IS the shogun himself. This helps resuming the story and gives a more light continuity, but may be confusing to the lone wolf fans.
I hope they will be two more compilations of this kind to make some sense, but this movie made it by itself, more than a ""best of"".For some this movie can be a perfect resume, more watchable and even enjoyable than the original two first pictures.
Finally, if you think a 1972 samurai movie cannot possibly do it because of today's digital advances, you're up to a surprise. Of course all the bloodbaths semmed fake, but the CRUELTY, cold blooded carnage style will, at least, shock you. Nobody is worth be saved, even women and children. Lightning swords slicing and deadly baby carts for the ultimate ninja showdowns on epic films history.
See it for yourself, this edition is an opportunity, but in any case can replace the lone wolf series. A great start for the new fans of the genre.",1158451200,,1668,4.54485049833887
1990191,5,B0001CNPLI,"""Shogun Assassin"" is a great film. Much ""controversy"" has arisen over the years regarding this film having been cobbled together from two other films in the Lone Wolf series. I think that what has been achieved is an extremely entertaining, fast-paced piece of action. By eliminating non-essential story lines and including a voice over narration, the action moves at break neck speed. The amount of blood spilled is so over the top as to be cartoonish, which only adds to the uniqueness of the movie. The DVD transfer is excellent and the restored picture is high quality. Some reviewers have complained about certain scenes being unrestored, it is actually only two shots totaling maybe five seconds in length. Both shots are of a castle and the excuse for not restoring them was that they were stock footage with no original element available. I do not know why the company had to place the disclaimer of this fact on the film, as I doubt anyone would have really noticed anyway. An added bonus on the DVD is the inclusion of the trailer which, I had never seen before. I can only imagine an audience seeing this trailer and somehow not wanting to see the film, it is awesome. Anyway, if you have never seen ""Shogun Assassin"" or have seen it a thousand times, buy this DVD, it is well worth it.",1153353600,68,1297,4.643478260869565

Personally I f***ing hated this.  For what reason this was done, it was a bad choice.  Of course this movie is awesome, but i recommend getting the whole Lone Wolf and Cub series.

1990193,3,B0001CNPLI,"Roger Corman is legendary for dubbing and editing foreign films together for the American market. His company, New World, outdid themselves on this one. Unleashed on unsuspecting stateside audiences in 1980, Shogun Assassin has gained a mythic stature of it's own. Backed with a killer soundtrack by ex-Raider Mark Lindsay, this puppy is the sort of grindhouse picture that simply doesn't exist anymore. Cobbled together from the first two Lone Wolf & Cub movies, ""Assassin"" is the story of a renegade samurai in ancient Japan, travelling with his son, cutting down the Shogun's ninja spies who murdered his wife. The Shogun's men hunt them at every turn. Extraordinarily graphic stuff. Check out the Master of Death who praises The Wolf's technique even as a bloody mist sprays from his slit throat! Decapitations, impalations, heads cut in half, you name it, it's here. But...there's one big problem, kemosabe.

8010351,5,B0001CNPLI,"The shogun assassin in my books proves to be the best Americanized adaption of anything. Although there's not much of a differences between lone wolf and cub and this. The shogun assassin is just built by using the first 10 minutes of the first movie and then sticking it into the second as well as dubbing and shooting a lot more graphic killing scenes and new music. The film really just works as a Japanese western about the shogun a man killing to avenge the death of his wife. Or otherwise it is an Exploitation film. Long ago there was a great samurai warrior who served his Shogun honorably. The Shogun however grew paranoid as he became more and more senile. The Shogun sought to destroy all those who might stand to oppose his rule, and so he sent his ninja spies to the samurai's home. The ninjas failed to kill the samurai, but did kill his beloved wife. From then on, the samurai swore on his honor to seek out the Shogun and avenge the death of his love. The samurai roams the countryside with his toddler son taking on mercenary work for money until the final battle with the Shogun's three Masters of Death. I got to hand it to them they did a much better job then anyone would think for an Americanized adaption.
