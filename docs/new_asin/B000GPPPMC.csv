8133780,5,B000GPPPMC,"This series has some age, I think it was done some 40+ years ago but
is still relative.  To those that have not studied WW II the Pacific
Theater should view this series.  It is rated a 5 star !",1344902400,,194,3.825
8133781,5,B000GPPPMC,"The Pacific War of World War II was fought from San Francisco to India. It involved vast movements of huge fleets filled with hundreds of thousands of men, locked in a death grip with each other to decide whose world-view would prevail. The beaches were soaked in blood.
This collection of DVD's follows the conflict, fight by fight, as it surges from island to island in the great Pacific Ocean. The battle footage is not for the faint-hearted, for the struggle is lethal. These DVD's show the whole extant of the war, from the Japanese invasion of China to the start of the Korean War. This is one of the best DVD sets of it's subject matter for the price. In judging war, the truth is not always clear to us, so we must set it out for all to see. This Canadian company has done an excellent job of laying out the picture of a great war not so long ago.",1229299200,,855,4.283950617283951
8133782,4,B000GPPPMC,"A truly outstanding, detailed account of WW2s Pacific Campaign. Rich in info and great footage, this is easily one the THE BEST WW2 documentaries ever produced, they don't make shows like this anymore. Far superior to most WW2 documentaries that have been made in the last 30 years, this is a must have for anyone interested in WW2 and highly educational in demonstrating why we must fight.",1204934400,2,390,4.835820895522388
8133783,5,B000GPPPMC,"Excellent value for $5-8 including shipping. 24x 25' episodes on 3 disks (8 episodes per disk). Other production houses package it as 4 disks (6 episodes per disk); I have these versions also. The episode navigation is faulty. Each episode is a single 25' chapter. When on episode #4 of any disk, you cannot skip chapter upward to #5 because it thinks it's on the final chapter. But you can fast-forward to the end of #4 and it will proceed to #5. Or you can access all chapters directly from the main menu. Overall sound quality and video quality are dated and poor. But this is archival WWII stuff, not HD Lucas/Spielberg. If you like WWII documentaries such as Ken Burns' The War, HBO's Band of Brothers, Victory at Sea, Frank Capra's Why We Fight, BBC History on WWII, and the History Channel, this is a great addition to reinforce and supplement the events of WWII. Share them with friends and family. I wish they would be used in public schools to prevent our society from forgetting ""why we fight.""",1195171200,3,1005,4.588888888888889
8133784,4,B000GPPPMC,"CRUSADE IN THE PACIFIC is an early TV documentary series quite similar to VICTORY AT SEA stylistically-- most notably because of heavy soundtrack music, a booming narration and well-worn film clips of fighting between the United States and Japan during World War II. Each 30 minute episode examines a crucial stage in that bitterly contested war. Also covered are events that occurred immediately after hostilities ended.
