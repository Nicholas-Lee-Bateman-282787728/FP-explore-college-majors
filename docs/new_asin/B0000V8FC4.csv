1948625,5,B0000V8FC4,"ADV does some of the best American releases of anime these days, and Abenobashi is right up there with the best.  Naturally, this is a very off beat anime done by the Gainax crew who basically did FLCL, His and Her Circumstances, and Evanglion.  So it might not be for everyone, and probably isn't for anyone because this has been a sadly under publicised series.
Basic story : Osaka shopping district kid duo gets swept into alternate usiverses of their block where they deal with condensed, stereotypical worlds based on their shopping district home.
It is a 13 episode series released in 2002 in Japan as a kids show.  While it is off beat, it is very enjoyable.  The show uses every bit of information and energy they can muster to keep these silly, fantastic and post modern affairs tangible or at least enjoyable.  Littered through out are tons of sci-fi, anime, manga, hollywood, video game and literature references.  As the father of Harumi says at one point 'No matter how much GEEK knowledge you have, you are no match for me.'
Great animation, wonderful backgrounds and a very offbeat idea.  While these first stories are indeed Gainax, later episodes on fuirther disks are done heavily in Korea and look cheap.  ADV keeps good picture quality, but not always as nice as the original Japanese releases.  Fun fun fun.  Nice acting and posing.  I can't imagine anyone except prudes regretting this purchase.  Some sexual/odd erotic situations/imagery.  Guns occassionally.  No tangible death.",1073001600,8,1502,4.932270916334661
1948626,4,B0000V8FC4,"Gainax does it again with another dizzying comedy very much in the spirit of FLCL.  However, Gainax is not the type of studio to simply repeat the same thing over and over, and as such Abenobashi clearly stands on its own two legs.
First off, I'll speak of the art.  Abenobashi is done in a bright, visually pleasing style very similar to the animation of FLCL, Gainax's other recent comedy series.  It is high quality, and the dizzying animation style keeps pace with the equally dizzying storyline to leave your head spinning.
Second, the characters.  Sasshi and Arumi, the two main characters, make for a cute couple, and their constantly-at-odds personalities provide a great deal of the humor of the series.  In general, the characters are all quirky, bizarre, and interesting, from the town transvestite to the improbably-busty Mune-Mune.
Third, the music.  I'm not sure I'd really call it quality music, but the quirky tunes fit well with the show.  It's not as outstanding a match as the Pillows with FLCL, but it's far from bad.  I found the opening song rather endearing, despite its preponderance of badly-pronounced English.
Fourth, the voice acting.  Someone at Gainax seems to have a thing for regional dialects and odd pronunciations.  The vast majority of the characters in the series speak in Osaka-ben, which is part of its charm.  I wouldn't recommend watching this series dubbed, as the Osaka dialect is transfigured into an irritatingly fake-sounding Texas accent.  Again, I can't say that the voice acting in the series quite lives up to the wonder that was FLCL, but it's definitely a cut above average.
Lastly, some general comments.  The overall trend of the series seems to be that each episode the two main characters -- Sasshi and Arumi -- find themselves in a new alternate universe version of their home, the Abenobashi shopping arcade.  The alternate universes are not so much alternate in the sense of Sliders, as each is a representation of a particular genre or cliche -- with its own 'rules' of reality based upon that.  For example, the second episode is based upon fantasy rpgs (such as the older Final Fantasy games), while the second is a mish-mash of science fiction and mecha anime.
The stabs at the convention of each genre are witty and genuinely funny, and this is one of many shows that makes many of its jokes by parodying other anime.  Interestingly, Abenobashi unabashedly parodies other anime by Gainax, at one point going so far as to play one of the songs from the show Neon Genesis Evangelion.  I think it was at this point that I fell in love with the series.  It takes a great sense of humor to be able to make fun of oneself so completely and effectively.
The one serious drawback I can see with this series is that I'm not sure that the conventions and pace that it has set itself can last thirteen episodes without becoming tired and boring.  Hopefully at some point the series will break the format which it has presented itself in in order to remain fresh and interesting.  If the problem isn't addressed, however, I can see how the latter end of the series could be rather disappointing.
Over all, I must say that I was very impressed with this series.  Every time Gainax steps up to the plate, they hit the ball.",1072828800,11,3273,4.73721340388007
1948627,4,B0000V8FC4,"Arumi Asahina and her childhood friend Sasshi Imamyia find their lives interrupted by the inexorable forces of progress.  Arumi's family have moved from a house to a condominium, leaving his toys and baseball cards behind.  And now Arumi's father, a chef, has taken a job far away, threatening to part the two friends in the cruelest possible manner.  Worse, the Abenobashi Shopping Arcade that was the center of their social lives is giving away to progress.  Soon it will be completely deserted.
When one of the magical figures that make Abenobashi a comfortable place to hang around is accidentally destroyed, Arumi and Sasshi discover that all was not as it seemed.  The Arcade is just a place to shop, but a portal to other realities.  They are catapulted headlong into a series of wacky adventures filled with unexpectedly twisted characters.  Don't be surprised to find hostile mushrooms, buxom pirates, dizzy transvestites, rude noises, and a host of the equally peculiar.
This is a 13 episode series that achieved a cult status in Japan for its rather daring story line.  Not that it is a particularly explicit series, but it crosses some taboos in its irreverence and deserves its 15+ rating.  Even though it is about two 11-year-old children, it sometimes sounds like Benny Hill.  And the English language acting that tries to smooth some of this rudeness over winds up making it even worse.
For some reason, the dubbing crew decided to play the folk of the Shopping Arcade with heavy Southern accents - making the English dialog sound like Beverly Hillbillies meet Godzilla.  I assume this was meant to convey something about the class or culture of the characters, but I found its effect was either tedious of irritating.  They also managed to butcher the translation.  The subtitling is much better, and the Japanese acting captures more of the spirit of what is going on. I you don't like dealing with subtitles you probably will not like this series.",1072569600,7,1966,4.921212121212121
1948628,4,B0000V8FC4,"Abenobashi is just plain weird.  Essentially, it is the story of two 12 year olds (a boy and a girl) from Osaka who keep teleporting from one alternate reality to the next, where each is a version of their home, a run-down shopping center.  Each episode, after the first, is a parody of a classic anime genre--e.g., sword and sorcery, giant robots.  What makes this work, where many parody shows do not, is that our heroes are in on it--they spend time trying to figure out the rules of this weird version of their home so they can make progress toward getting to their real home.
The show has its faults, however.  The first episode, which sets up the initial relationships, is painfully slow--so slow, I almost gave up on the show itself right there.  I'm glad I kept watching--episode 2 had me laughing out loud in a few seconds.  Also, the show is marked for ages 17+, and this isn't an exaggeration.  While everything is played to be ridiculous, there is a lot of innuendo and a whole heck of a lot of bouncy, underdressed, over-endowed girls, as well as a fair share of crude humor (but less crude than Hollywood has been getting the last few years).  Also, if you're watching the English dub, Sasshi, the main boy, is very obviously voiced by a woman.  The acting is fine, just the voice is somewhat jarring, particularly in the first episode.
Finally, the box.  This version comes with a box to hold all four discs in the series.  While this box is sturdier than some of ADV's paper-thin ones (e.g., Neo Ranga, Najica), it is still just folded, fairly-thin cardboard.  It also has a weird curvature on the bottom, preventing it from sitting flat.  It is fairly attractive, though, and suits the show well.",1072483200,13,1713,4.577049180327869
1948629,4,B0000V8FC4,"This anime is definitely Unique. I'll admit that with Gainax's repuation for great animes, that was a big deciding factor as to whether or not to purchase this anime, (and the sample dvd in Newtype was a giant push as well).
The interesting thing about Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi, is all the interesting American and Japanese entertainment references and parodies.  It actually reminded me of Excel Saga since each episode tends to focus on a particular genre and setting to make parodies of (more or less).
The first episode starts off about the lives of two kids, living in a small city and I found it quite charming, seeing how they went about their daily lives.  The characters are all interesting and unique with quirky personalities.  However, tragedy strikes and the world gets flipped and screwed up and and the two kids find themselves in a wierded out, parallel version of their own town, with the parallel versions of the people they know.
The second episode seems to be parodying RPG games and the fantasy, knights in shining armor and monsters genre.  Its pretty darn funny and I enjoyed it a lot. However, it seems that no matter how they try to go back to their own world.  They keep getting sent to someplace strange.
The third episode is a sci fi, mecha, outter space type deal and started out quite funny.  However, I'm afraid the writer's went a bit too far with this episode and it turns into rambling, insane mess that doesn't make much sense and is so perverted its disgusting. Yes, this may be a parody of shows that are like this but the problem with parodies is that there is a fine line between parodying something and becoming that which is being parodied. And that big ... woman runs around practically naked, ... swinging around and bouncing in ridiculous cicles which was a major turn off as well.
The last episode was quite enjoyable.  Truthfully, after episode three, I began to reconsider whether or not this show was all that great.  However, episode four was great and so I've decided to stick with the show a little longer with future volumes.  This one takes place in China and is a fighting anime kind of episode.  It makes references to shows such as DBZ and Fist of the North Star.  Pretty darn funny stuff ^_^
Well, I don't want to give too much away, but I really like this show a lot.  The kids are so cute and funny and its hilarious seeing how they react to each new situation.  I definitely recommend this dvd, but be warned.  The extreme amounts of fanservice may turn you off.",1072396800,3,2532,4.597777777777778

Some of the humor and their ""zingers"" had me laughing until I cried - I had to pause a few times to keep from missing anything!!

This anime is totally off the wall. The craziness of Excel Saga and Oh Edo Rocket aren't even as whacked out as this. This anime is a parody on pop culture.

Abenobashi Hong Kong Combat Shopping Arcade.""  A booklet is included with the DVD, and the booklet is designed in such a way that it looks and reads like a tabloid newspaper.  While I normally find DVD booklets to be dry reading, the booklet included in this DVD release was actually very enjoyable.

There are four extras included on this release.  The first extra on the disc is ""AD Vid-Notes.""  This feature allows you to turn on or off pop-ups that appear during the episodes to explain cultural references.  The second extra is a commentary with Luci Christian and Jessica Boone, the English dub actors for Sasshi and Arumi.  They provide commentary for the third episode, ""Hook Up! Abenobashi Great Milky Way Shopping Arcade.""

Next in the extras menu is ""Clean Opening.""  This is a version of the opening credits that is truly textless; not only is there no credit text, but no subtitles for the song appear, either.  There is also a ""Clean Closing,"" which is also a truly textless version of the ending credits.

The next feature is ""ADV Previews.""  This link takes you to a menu with previews for Azumanga Daioh, Angelic Layer, Kino's Journey, Cosplay Complex, Nuku Nuku Dash!, and Super Gals!

1948679,5,B0000V8FC4,"If I had to describe ""Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi,"" it would be simple: ""Fooly Cooly"" as written by Lewis Carroll.

That's only a glimpse of the explosive weirdness and insanely cracked-out madness that fills every episode of this wacky anime series. And while ""Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi Volume 1"" starts off a bit slowly, the first five episodes of this series soon blossom into an acid-tripping flower filled with constant spoofs, genre cliches, and lots of fanservicey breasts.

Sasshi is unhappy --  the Abenobashi Shopping Arcade is being bought out for demolition, and his friend Arumi is going to be moving away. Fortunately they are distracted from their impending separation by a series of mysterious animal statues all throughout the Arcade.

But when Arumi's grandfather is badly injured and the bird statue is smashed, Arumi and Sasshi find themselves sucked into a freaky D&D-video-game-esque fantasy land, where they are called upon to defeat the stereotypically Evil Lord. Unfortunately, Arumi spends all their money on a mysterious charm by a blue-haired sorcerer, and Sasshi keeps getting killed by the insane, scantily-clad Mune Mune.

Each attempt to get back home sends Sasshi and Arumi to another cracked-out variant of Abenobashi --  a space station where they must pilot a mystical mecha to save the universe (and Arumi's stolen panties), a Chinese Abenobashi where Sasshi is given the ultimate martial-arts training (and the ""Suit That Makes You Feel Stronger!"") and finally to a highly anachronistic dinosaur age, where he and Sasshi must save a little triceratops from Sasshi's power-hungry whip-wielding sister.

And through every world, they encounter Mune-Mune and the blue-haired ""mister"" Eutus -- as well as deranged versions of their own families. Who are these people? What's with the goblins? Why does it all center on the Arcade? And what does all this have to do with Sasshi's grandmother?

""Neon Genesis Evangelion,"" martial-arts, ""Dragonball Z,"" medieval S&S fantasy, shouted attack names, dinosaurs, and even ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (""See, it's a monolith! If you touch it, you're supposed to get smarter!"" ""Great, you're devolvin' now""). All of these get spoofed and/or lovingly homaged in the first five episodes, until the stories are so crammed with goodhearted mockery that there's no real need for an original plot.

The first episode is a bit on the slow side, since much of it is about setting up Sasshi's problems and the Harmony of the Four Gods. But once they see dancing mushrooms, all bets are off -- we get endless fanservice (Mune Mune's mostly-nude getups),  repeated deaths (""I saw the beginnin' and the end of the UNIVERSE!""), and plots full of random and inexplicable twists (""I don't understand! Why am I a dumpling?"" Sasshi moans after getting encased in a dumpling and sent off the top of a skyscraper).

The biggest problem with the story? Well, it's a bit distracting at first to hear everyone talking in Southern accents (which substitute for Osaka accents, just to show that there IS an accent). Fortunately you get used to it pretty quickly.

Sasshi makes a good hero for this series -- he's a die-hard geek who quickly learns to enjoy the weirdness, because he knows how the various tropes work (Mystical mecha! Magical items! Martial-arts!). Sometimes it requires a little suffering, though -- such as being forced to undergo ""the training"" with a panda. Arumi is a good counterpoint, a more down-to-earth type who discovers just how weird these spoofs can be, while Eutus is a fun oddity -- a sorcerer having a midlife crisis.

The first volume of ""Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi"" is a wild, tripped-out ride that answers no questions about the source of the strangeness, but does a brilliant job with gutsplitting parodies.",1235952000,,3813,5.140549273021001

However, it's a great series about how kids think during great changes in their lives and the altered worlds they create in order to cope with these changes.

1948681,4,B0000V8FC4,"The plot's been described here so many times already, so I'll just say what I thought about the show. It's been compaired to EXCELL SAGA. While this show, like that one, is a parody of many different animes (and American movies,) I enjoy this one a lot more, partially because the story here is much easier to follow than EXCELL SAGA, and partially because, where E.S. was the kind of show where it's completly chaotic and just about anything can happen, here there's an explanation: these are two kids from our world who wind up in a series of alternate worlds things work differntly and pretty much anything goes, and even death (for some people at least,) isn't permenant.

The humor is on the same outrageous level as EXCELL, however there is the occasional episode that takes place in our world. The one at the beginning, of course, but then a few episodes in when we've seen Sasshi and Arumi bounce around a few worlds we go back to the ordinary world in the episode ""Flashback"" and see how Sasshi's grandpa first met the guy who came up with the building plans for the shopping arcade. These episodes are quite slow paced. Some may not mind so much, and may say it's how the writers wanted it (and they'd be right,) but it was still a bit of a let down for me. This is what knocks my rating down one star.

Now I seem to be in the minority here, but I like the dub voices just fine. The fact that almost everyone speaks with a Southern American accent just adds to the charm of the show for me and makes for quite a unique viewing experience.

Finally, there's an optional commentary track that's a blast to listen to in and of itself. The two main English voice actors Jessica Boone and Luci Christian, who play Arumi and Sasshi, watch the sci-fi/space opera episode and share their thoughts on the whole thing.

This one is definetly worth buying.",1119830400,5,1856,4.466076696165191
1948682,5,B0000V8FC4,"I take a special joy in this series because I take the train to Abenobashi every week.  The idea that the clanging, mixed-up old shopping arcade Abenobashi is a portal to a magical land of fantasy and adventure makes the train ride that much more thrilling.

Studio Gainax has popped out another smashing series with ""Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi.""  Springing from the ground laid in ""Otaku-no-Video,"" Gainax takes us on another tour through geekdom Japanese-style.  Wacky like ""FLCL,""  but with a more solid storyline, this is one of the funniest anime I have seen for a long time.

The main characters, Sasshi and Arumi, trying to find their way back to regular Osaka leap from one magical world to the next.  Super-geek Sasshi finds himself in a place where his vast storehouse of geek-knowledge suddenly has value, as he knows how assemble a giant robot and work a magic sword.  Unfortunately, as the hero, he seems to keep dying.  The mystery babe Mune-mune (""Busty-busty"" in Japanese) makes life all the more interesting, as she fills in the various characters along with Sasshi's elder sister providing some eye candy.

This first DVD sets up the story, and isn't as action packed as the rest.  The first episode introduces the characters, and sends them off to the magical Abenobashi.  The second episode is a world of fantasy role-playing games, complete with spear and magic helmet.  The third episode is a Giant Robot extravaganza, with the kids piloting their very own Mecha.  Finally, the kids wind up in China Town, and have a showdown Fist of the Northstar - style.

The only problem with ""Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi"" is the Osaka dialect, which the producers have dealt with in a few ways.  The English dub is atrocious, featuring faux Southern accents in an approximation attempt.  This is ridiculous, as the Osaka dialect is an urban dialect, not rural,  and a thick Brooklyn accent would be more appropriate.  The subtitle takes a more direct approach, but still loses the flavor of the language, and for US audiences it is difficult to so firmly set this series in Osaka as the creators intended.",1118448000,,2130,4.899441340782123
1948683,5,B0000V8FC4,"An adult anime like this is what at least Showtime could show late night. Sasshi, Imamiya, Arumi share a great relationship together as friends. They love their local shopping arcade which is the harmony of four directional Chinese gods.",1118448000,,237,5.102564102564102

I couldn't sleep at night so I turned on the tv and tuned to G4 and ""Anime Unleashed"" was on.  They were showing some anime called ""Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi"".  I had seen previews for it earlier that day so I figured I'd check it out to see what it was about.  I am glad I did.  ""Night Mist!"" was the episode on and it was so unique and quirky that it helped me forget about my discomfort and tune into what was going on.  I laughed quite a bit at all the zaniness the show exhibited and decided to watch the next one, ""Birth"".  This episode showed me that the series has depth and I knew then that this was a series I had to pick up.  I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys seriously ""out-there"" humor with a story behind it all.  If thats your style, this anime won't miss a beat.

Oh, a shot of Ramune! And a boy that resembles Nandaba Naota! I just might like this one.

They've got to be kidding...a phony Texas accent in place of the Osaka dialect??? OK. That ruins the whole thing. A half French girl can't possibly sound worse than Sandy Cheeks of Spongebob Squarepants.

My advice:

This is a very promising series. So irreverent and hilarious in the tradition of FLCL. Extended to 13 episodes so you are righteously satisfied. Once you get over the irritating accent the voice actors use, you'll find a gem in this anime. BUT watch the SUBS for a better experience.",1109462400,,727,4.878048780487805
1948686,5,B0000V8FC4,"Studio Gainax, the creator of such classics as ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" and ""FLCL"" (a.k.a. ""Fooly Cooly"") has done it again with this wonderful series that blends lowbrow comedy with heartfelt family drama -- and somehow manages to pull it off.

""Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi"" (""Abenobashi Mahou Shotengai,"" in Japanese) is only half the length of a typical anime series -- my only real complaint about this series is that I wish it had been longer -- the Gainax team managed to pack enough character development into 13 episodes to draw you into the series and keep you there.

The plot revolves around a boy-and-girl pair of prepubescent best friends, Sasshi and Arumi, whose way of life is disappearing. The Osakan shopping arcade (think ""outdoor mall"") where they grew up, and which their grandparents actually helped found, is slowly going out of business. When the series opens, Sasshi's family business, the Turtle Bath, has already been razed, and Arumi's family business, Grill Pelican, has announced it will close due to the family's impending move to Hokkaido. This series of events, coupled with an unexpected tragedy, leaves Sasshi in a state of denial that causes him and Arumi to jump into multiple versions of their familiar Abenobashi. This gives the series' writers and animators plenty of license to play, and they display their creativity in delightful ways as they send their hapless protagonists through Abenobashis parodying role-playing video games, Hollywood movies, WWII, gangsters, and, of course, other animes (by the dozen). The animation style also changes throughout the series to reflect the environment in which the characters find themselves.

The music in this series is also fantastic. The opening and closing themes are both sung by anime fan favorite Megumi Hayashibara, and the background music within the series is great as well, spoofing well-known tunes such as the ""Star Wars"" theme. Fans of ""Evangelion"" will also love the use of the battle music from that series.

The Japanese voice acting is obviously outstanding (my rule of thumb is to always watch anime with the Japanese audio track and English subtitles). This series was licensed in America by ADV, which typically does a good job with the English voiceover. This series is set in Osaka, which has a reputation as being the ""backwater"" area of Japan. To this end, the ADV team decided to give all the major characters Southern accents, the closest equivalent in American culture. While I understand the reasoning behind this, the Southern accents can be very grating, especially when the voice actors occasionally have a bit of trouble maintaining them. ADV redeemed themselves, however, by adding a great ""cultural notes"" option under the ""extra features"" menu. When this option is enabled, notes will pop up throughout each episode (a la the old VH1 show ""Pop Up Video"") to help American viewers understand some of the aspects that may otherwise be ""lost in translation."" I recommend watching the show in its original Japanese while simultaneously enabling the English subtitles and the cultural notes. You may have to fiddle around with your DVD setup menus a bit to accomplish this, but it is well worth the effort, because it really helps elucidate things that otherwise would only make sense to someone extremely familiar with Japanese culture. (In other words, while some of the jokes still won't be funny to American audiences, at least you're able to understand that they're supposed to be jokes.)

On the surface, this series revolves around some really lowbrow jokes (the stereotype of busty anime women offering ""fanservice"" galore is alive and well here), but it soon becomes apparent that the real storyline of ""Abenobashi"" is a psychological exploration of some key issues with which Sasshi is struggling to come to terms. I've watched a lot of anime, and this one is easily in my top five all-time favorites. Also, since the multiple layers and fast pacing ensure that you'll never catch everything the first time around, it's well worth owning.",1109116800,2,4071,5.125
1948687,5,B0000V8FC4,"I subscirbe to a magazine called ""Play"", which deals mostly with video games, but also offers reviews and stuff on anime.  A bit more than a year ago I read a review by them in their anime section for ""Abenobashi"".  They spoke so highly about this anime that they really got my interest going.  So, based on their high praise of this anime, I purchased it through Amazon.com.  I have since become a huge fan of anime, and it all started with this anime which is among the best.
  It takes alot to make me laugh hysterically and genuinely, but this anime did it and did it well!  The series follows two early-teenage friends and thir adventures into a strange, fun, alternative world.  In pretty much every episode, the two friends, Sasshi and Arami, end up going to a different world.  These worlds are based upon a certain theme;  for example, video games, science fiction, anime, martial arts, etc.  The two then end up getting into hysterical situations while trying to escape back into the real world, only to end up in another alternative world.
  Much of the comedy derives from cultural references.  Not to worry, however, because you will recognize most of them if you are a young man or teenager!  But even if you don't, you don't have to!  For example, in the video game themed world, even though the humour reference comes from generic, Japanese RPGs(Role Playing Games), you will still be able to laugh at Sasshi as he is being attacked by Miss Mune-Mune, a woman with gigantic nuclear boobs dressed in the most ridiculous of costumes!
  Essentially, Abenobashi is a comedy, although there are a few dramatic episodes.  These few dramamtic episodes serve to bring you into a closer emotional attachment with the characters.  It is these dramamtic episodes, and the character development in general, which turns Abenobashi into a work of genious!
  Buy this anime series!  After episode 1 you'll be saying 'this is entertaining!', but by the end of episode 2 you'll be laughing and fumbling for the remote to get on to episode 3!  Enjoy!",1100390400,3,2048,4.736543909348442

The whole story behind this series is about two 12 year old kids who have been best friends for a long time are moving apart.  But when someting goes wrong within their shopping area Abenobashi just turns into so wacky virtual reality place.
The whole show to me seems like a video game that they have to learn how to get out of.",1078531200,3,419,4.160493827160494
1948689,4,B0000V8FC4,"Gainax does it again with another dizzying comedy very much in the spirit of FLCL. However, Gainax is not the type of studio to simply repeat the same thing over and over, and as such Abenobashi clearly stands on its own two legs.
First off, I'll speak of the art. Abenobashi is done in a bright, visually pleasing style very similar to the animation of FLCL, Gainax's other recent comedy series. It is high quality, and the dizzying animation style keeps pace with the equally dizzying storyline to leave your head spinning.
Second, the characters. Sasshi and Arumi, the two main characters, make for a cute couple, and their constantly-at-odds personalities provide a great deal of the humor of the series. In general, the characters are all quirky, bizarre, and interesting, from the town transvestite to the improbably-busty Mune-Mune.
Third, the music. I'm not sure I'd really call it quality music, but the quirky tunes fit well with the show. It's not as outstanding a match as the Pillows with FLCL, but it's far from bad. I found the opening song rather endearing, despite its preponderance of badly-pronounced English.
Fourth, the voice acting. Someone at Gainax seems to have a thing for regional dialects and odd pronunciations. The vast majority of the characters in the series speak in Osaka-ben, which is part of its charm. I wouldn't recommend watching this series dubbed, as the Osaka dialect is transfigured into an irritatingly fake-sounding Texas accent. Again, I can't say that the voice acting in the series quite lives up to the wonder that was FLCL, but it's definitely a cut above average.
Lastly, some general comments. The overall trend of the series seems to be that each episode the two main characters -- Sasshi and Arumi -- find themselves in a new alternate universe version of their home, the Abenobashi shopping arcade. The alternate universes are not so much alternate in the sense of Sliders, as each is a representation of a particular genre or cliche -- with its own 'rules' of reality based upon that. For example, the second episode is based upon fantasy rpgs (such as the older Final Fantasy games), while the second is a mish-mash of science fiction and mecha anime.
The stabs at the convention of each genre are witty and genuinely funny, and this is one of many shows that makes many of its jokes by parodying other anime. Interestingly, Abenobashi unabashedly parodies other anime by Gainax, at one point going so far as to play one of the songs from the show Neon Genesis Evangelion. I think it was at this point that I fell in love with the series. It takes a great sense of humor to be able to make fun of oneself so completely and effectively.
The one serious drawback I can see with this series is that I'm not sure that the conventions and pace that it has set itself can last thirteen episodes without becoming tired and boring. Hopefully at some point the series will break the format which it has presented itself in in order to remain fresh and interesting. If the problem isn't addressed, however, I can see how the latter end of the series could be rather disappointing.
Over all, I must say that I was very impressed with this series. Every time Gainax steps up to the plate, they hit the ball.",1073088000,9,3252,4.73721340388007
