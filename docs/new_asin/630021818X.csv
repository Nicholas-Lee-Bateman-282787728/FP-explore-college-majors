The documentary ""Great Movie Stunts & The Making of Raiders of the Lost Ark is just that.  This Doc came out in the early 80's and is only available on VHS.  It's too bad because it really is a good documentary about how stunts are performed in the movie world.  It also shows these stunts within the context of ""Raiders"".  Narrated by Harrison Ford it has many interviews with great movie stunt people like Terry Leonard.  Highly recommend for fans of movie stunts.",1302048000,,631,4.672727272727273
7808187,5,630021818X,It's too bad that this program IS NOT part of the DVD package either by itself or on the BONUS disc. Such a shame!!,1122336000,,115,3.8333333333333335
7808188,5,630021818X,"This video was amazing! The stunts were top draw, and the behind the scenes footage was class! I would recomend this vid to everyone as its entertaining, funny and more to the point educational! May I please make a point to George Lucas & Steven Spielberg. If you both have similar footage of the other two indy films could you please produce the same kind of videos? Or perhaps make a stunts and behind the scenes video of Indy 4!",1049414400,,431,4.4
7808189,5,630021818X,"I like a lot Indiana Jones since when I was a child and I always wanted to know how Raiders was done. I really liked this video because is very interesting to see all the secrets of the production of this movie. If you have some doubts to buy it, don't wait more one minute, don't delay, buy it!!!",972000000,2,297,4.0508474576271185
7808190,5,630021818X,"This will give the average audience goer,who may not appreciate what filmmakers go through to get a project off the ground, a new appreciation. Great Movie Stunts conveys that message with regard to staging spectacular  action sequences that last just a few seconds or minutes on screen, but may  take weeks and even months to accomplish.  I liked the ""Making  Of"" better. This goes into other aspects of the production such as the  logistics associated with shooting at various locations around the  world(watch what the crew had to do to make Cairo appear as it did in  1936!)Karen Allen is interviewed as is Lucas, Speilberg, and of course  Ford. Other members of the crew such as Frank Marshall and David Tomblin(who  will explain how the location shooting was effective as they had been here  before for Star Wars!)are interviewed. Some of the scenes in Great Movie  Stunts appear again in The Making Of, but redundancy never hurt  anyone! Highly recommended.",962064000,2,964,4.95625
