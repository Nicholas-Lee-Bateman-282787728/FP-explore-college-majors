8275897,1,B001A3DGZM,"Wow.....I have read the other reviews for this movie and I seriously do not understand what any of you are thinking. Sure there was no budget, but there have been plenty more movies made with even less budget than this one that have blown this movie out of the water. The humor is terrible, the actors are even worse, the camera angles and filming production are garbage. The only good actor in the movie is Nicholas Macarages. EVERY SCENE in this movie is entirely TOO long. A 2 minute dialogue will continue for around 10-15 minutes. Sometimes one character will talk for so long that you forget there are even others in the scene. As a filmmaker I appreciate the attempt at making this movie, and it's not that bad for just some friends making it, but I cannot sit here and read reviews that say ""The characters really impressed me, I cried when the Indian boy died,"" and agree. That is insane. If you want to see some real movies made with no budget, go to [...]

It definitely makes me think twice about going into the woods, and confirms my suspicions about the evil that lurks inside the soul of a cat.  I am sort of glad that you had a low budget with a handheld camera, otherwise that cat might have been even scarier, and I am already having trouble sleeping. I can not wait to see what you come up with next.",1239840000,,454,4.329411764705882
8275899,5,B001A3DGZM,Great job on this film considering the budget. There are similar legends in the area where I live concerning Indian mounds and Tinkers Hollow. Can't wait for your next film.,1214006400,,173,4.8
8275900,5,B001A3DGZM,"Hey Guys , I watched your movie recently The truth About Shadows,  I realise that you guys filmed this with a digital camcorder on NO budget whatsoever..  but I have to say  WOW  am I impressed!!  what a crackerjack job you did considering you had nothing to work with ..  Your actors  were very believable, I cried when the Indian boy dies  and I truly believed that the three freinds  in the second story really were lifelong freinds ..The campy humor  was great too.  If this is any indication of the type of art you can create with NO money I cant wait to see what you do with the next film on a budget ILL BE WATCHING YOU CLOSELY.. I highly reccoment this film for anyone who has ever wanted to film art on a shoestring budget You prolly won't be getting any oscars here..BUT  you guys did it right !!
Keep up the good work  ..... sincerely a fello lover of the arts",1212192000,,871,4.206060606060606
