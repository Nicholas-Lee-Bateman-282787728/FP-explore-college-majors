2518720,3,B000EHKCTS,The movie was fun but definitely not among my favorites. Story lines was predictable but cute with some good funny moments. Personally I almost did not make it past the first 5 minutes as I found some of the dialogue crude; after that though the movie was family friendly. The subtitles were good and ran at a nice readable pace.,1319328000,9,329,4.5
2518721,4,B000EHKCTS,It is a funny story.  It shows how people can change.  It is fun to watch it over again.,1310428800,3,88,3.5789473684210527
2518722,5,B000EHKCTS,"This movie is absolutely funny an heart touching at the same time, it brings laughs while I also brought a little emotion home as well. Excellent movie",1279152000,9,151,4.62962962962963
2518723,3,B000EHKCTS,"Not the best for Ms. Ha.  I can't believe her youthful looks she looks like a high school student.  I liked her best in Secret Garden. I haven't seen many of her movies but I like the movies Sector 7 and Secret Garden.  I barely recognized her in Love, so divine. I am looking forward to many more.",1402358400,2,298,4.103448275862069
2518724,4,B000EHKCTS,"I thought this movie was cute, warm and hearfelt. Two strangers who come into each others lives hating each other and end up falling in love.",1396051200,4,141,4.461538461538462
2518725,5,B000EHKCTS,"I thought this movie was a real gem... ended up watching it twice! It has a very sweet story about an unlikely encounter between a high school senior and a college student: featuring comical cinematic style and an equally unrealistic but absolutely perfect happy ending! Enjoy! (Although this is a story about a high school student, it has ADULT HUMOR and is intended for those of us who have lived those years already!)",1376438400,3,420,4.767123287671233
2518726,1,B000EHKCTS,"A very dis-jointed story with crude humor that had me cringing. A booger eating teacher, school girls have inappropriate discussions about sex & a girl grunting while on the toilet. UGH! That's how the first half of the movie proceeds. Then they change gears & have the characters go away on a 4 day holiday together,oddly they do not give you details about them staying in the same tent. Suddenly the characters like each other & the tone of the movie changes again. The guy abruptly walks away from any contact with the girl after her mother yells at him. They use ""what-if"" scenarios that they don't properly cue the viewer to, so you're left a bit clueless. Also,would someone explain to me why guys in Korean movies go around roughly grabbing girls by the wrist & pulling them around...then you have the violent hugs & kisses with the Guy at arm's length from girl reaching over,grabbing her,(by the neck!)& kissing her. The girl looks surprised, but not like shes enjoying it. Really unromantic.",1369785600,,1001,4.758620689655173
2518727,3,B000EHKCTS,the movie was okay decent at the best very funny though good laughs the ending needs a little bit of work though,1356393600,6,112,4.136363636363637
2518728,2,B000EHKCTS,"Ok, let me start off with saying that I am a Huge fan of Korean Dramas and Korean Movies. I am a big fan of the cast. This movie is honestly pretty odd. In my opinion it is gered more toward young teens, in ways of the humor and the acting. There is some crude yet funny scenes in this epic. Over all is a good flic, But Not however worth $15 bucks, more like 5. Just my Opinion.",1354665600,,379,3.810126582278481
2518729,4,B000EHKCTS,"This is typical romantic comedy fluff.  But sometimes that's what you want to destress.  I watch alot of different countries movies & this one was mindless fun.  The actress is so winning.  I think I might have seen most of her work by now.  I don't know why she isn't a bigger star.  So this movie is fun, don't look for it to be deep, but enjoy.",1352160000,,347,4.104477611940299
2518730,1,B000EHKCTS,"One of the worst purchases I have ever made. The story wast stupid, but the production was worse. Not Korean....a want-a-be attempt. Pass it up.",1349913600,,144,4.8
2518731,5,B000EHKCTS,OMG. when i finally got this movie i watched it right away and to be honest this movie was to funny. I really enjoyed watching this movie i love the actress she is so awsome.,1340236800,5,174,4.0
2518732,3,B000EHKCTS,"Fast-paced and fun, if forgettable teenage romance. A high-school girl has a chance encounter with a rich college student, that leads to a minuscule scratch on the bumper of his fancy sports car. He demands 3 grand in compensation, and when she can't pay up, forces her to work as his ""slave"" for the next 100 days to pay off the debt. Eventually, the girl realizes she's being scammed - the damage is only about $20.00 worth - and turns the tables on him with a series of practical jokes. He retaliates by wangling a job as her tutor for the upcoming college entrance exams. Mutual antagonism turns to mutual attraction, and soon the pair are using their tutoring sessions as cover for sneaking out together...

In Korean with English subtitles. Should be suitable for ages 12 up (some potty humor and mild swearing).",1339891200,3,818,4.680555555555555
