7926056,5,B00004XMSP,"Tom Avery doesn't over-complicate things, nor does he oversimplify them. You can't wait to apply what you've learned!

I have the whole 8 DVD series of his called, ""Consistent Tennis Wins"", which I also recommend.

These DVDs deal with the:
Serve
Return of Serve
Backhand
Ability to Swing
Net Play
Singles & Doubles Tips
Specialty Shots (lobs, slice, etc) and the
Original

It costs more than others, because you get what you pay for! It's worth it (though it won't hurt to shop around for the best deal)!",1201651200,,505,4.715909090909091
7926057,5,B00004XMSP,"Tom Avery teaches the techniques behind the Slice, Flat and Topspin serves. His simple drills has given me a consistent toss and has measurably improved my racquet speed on my serve.

The video is clear and his teaching methods are excellent.

This video is indeed a keeper. I say a keeper, because you will view it over and over again and each time another point seems to hit you. It's excellent.",1105488000,,397,4.577464788732394
7926058,1,B00004XMSP,Bunch of tips you can hear from an average tennis pro. Nothing on tennis fundamentals or proper technique development. Good video quality which doesn't justify such a high price.,1069113600,5,178,5.172413793103448
7926059,1,B00004XMSP,"I bought two more videos (II, and III) because I liked the first video, which has some good points. But it turned out they are both a big disappointment to me.
Especially the serve tape. I feel the instruction in the tape contradicts with most modern serve techniques. I feel the motion of the serve in the tape is very rushed partially due to the extremely low toss. No momentum was build at all for the serve. You don't see any explosiveness from the serve motion. The only suggestion for power was to only use 75% of your strength, without mentioning anything about racket drop, knee bent, hip rotation, etc. Another difference on the serve motion from modern serves is that he steps into the court with his right foot after serve, so there was no push off from the ground, therefore lacking another element for power.
If you are a true beginner, this tape may help a little. But if you are looking for improvement of your serve, you may be better off looking else where, such as the serve tape by Bollettieri, or the book by Yandell.
Besides, why are Tom Avery's tapes are so expensive compared to others?",1057708800,17,1109,4.522388059701493
7926060,5,B00004XMSP,This is my 3rd tape of Tom Avery's and they just keep getting better.  Tom continues to provide exceptional simplification of material.  This tape on serving is fabulous!  Replaying the material in your head when practicing will deliver immediate improvement.  Thank You Tom!,1056672000,,275,5.325581395348837
7926061,4,B00004XMSP,"After following his tips, I noticed an immediate improvement on my serve.  I found his instructions easy to follow and was disappointed when the tape ended (His tapes always seem too short!).
My sister, on the other hand, sprained her back when she tried his kick serve and refused to try it again once she recovered.",1042502400,2,317,4.660714285714286
7926062,5,B00004XMSP,"The Serve tape is simply awesome. Avery presents the correct serving techniques in slow motion and great details. No written material can really substitute his demonstration of the racquet's movement on every stage of the serve. Troubleshooting, if the ball goes to the net or long, is excellent. If you are not happy with your serve, this is the best way I can recommend to fix the problem in short time.",994982400,18,405,4.71830985915493
