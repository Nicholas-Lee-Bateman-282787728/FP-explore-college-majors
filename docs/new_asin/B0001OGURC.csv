2022248,5,B0001OGURC,"Thanks to the previous reviewer for pointing this out.

The review posted March 2005 applies to Vol. 10, and the review posted July 2005 obviously applies to Vol. 13.

As far as the one from 2002, it's anyone's guess.

Both 10 and 13 are terrific movies, but I will need to rewatch them to do a better review.  And I would like to do one large review of both since it will end up listed in both places.  Meanwhile, I have done reviews for Vols. 1 and 8 of this series, if you would like to know what I think about them.

2022249,5,B0001OGURC,"For some reason, Amazon has posted identical reviews for both Vol. 10 and Vol. 13 of this series.

The previous reviewer has indicated that this is misleading, which is correct. However, it is not correct that the reviewers are doing the misleading, since all reviews posted for both Vol. 10 and Vol. 13 are showing up in both places, which is Amazon's error.",1132185600,43,359,4.698412698412699
2022250,5,B0001OGURC,"*(This review was posted for Vol. 13, and is meant for Vol. 13, but is also showing up for Vol. 10, as several other reviewers have pointed out.)*

Like the other movies in the Zatoichi series, this story features strong female characters, exciting and well-staged swordplay, tasteful violence (no blood and gore), and our hero only killing when absolutely forced to.  While there is nothing new to the basic storyline of this movie - Ichi saving townspeople and merchants from a band of evil men - there are many unique and surprising elements to this tale which set it apart from the others.

First, the ingenuity of Ichi's adversaries in using drums to hinder his hearing is somewhat surprising.  Normally, his opponents are not quite that clever.

Also, the swordsmanship (skill and technique) is significantly raised to a much more intricate level when Ichi fights the samurai.  This is a noticeable difference from the simplicity he usually employs against more the common/obscure swordsman he generally faces.

Another unexpected surprise is the amount of abuse Ichi is willing to take before acting to defend himself.  He is bloodied and bruised when severely beaten; yet, he does not act, seemingly because he does not want to have to kill in front of a child, or risk provoking the evildoers into more extreme action against those he is trying to protect.

The addition of Ichi slipping and falling on the stairs at the end of the movie really showcases his vulnerability, reminding us that even heroes stumble.

One of the female characters, the wife of the innkeeper, demonstrates even more strength than the women in other films of this series:  Though they beat and threaten her, she is able to stand up to her harassers.

Many other characters are given a great deal of depth, which allows us to have a better understanding of their motives, adding dimension and accentuating their flaws to make them interesting.  For example, the scorn shown by the child (whose previous admiration and emulation bordered on reverence) when Ichi allows himself to be punched, kicked, and humiliated instead of killing his tormentors as he easily could.  Another example is the prostitute's judgment of her love in calling him a drunk and her subsequent lapse into drunkenness after his death.

The silhouette scene, which includes fighting and drumming against a dusky sky, is tremendously beautiful.

As in other Ichi films, extremely creative and surprising swordplay is featured such as the tip of a lit candle balanced perfectly on the end of a sword to illuminate the faces of the ""animal"" bullies, slicing a hilt from its blade while the sword is still in the scabbard at his opponent's waist, taking out several bad guys while protecting the child in his arms, and deftly cutting the bonds of the innkeeper's wife without causing her injury.

Finally, the sadness in our hero's face at the number of people he is forced to kill in this movie is extremely exquisite and touching, and seems to be more intense than similar emotions he expresses in other adventures.  We feel Ichi's pain very deeply from what he is forced to do at this stage in his journey, particularly when he kills the samurai.

Though there is sadness in this story, it is one of the most interesting, surprising, and beautifully filmed movies of the Zatoichi series.

2022251,5,B0001OGURC,"With the slew of well known asian films from the likes of Kurosawa, Tsui Hark, ect. it is easy to overlook these precious gems known as the Zatoichi series.  Truly incredible, Shintaro Katsu owns this role and plays the part so damned well you'd swear he must have walked around every day of his life carrying a cane sword and pretending to be blind.  The swordplay scenes are some of the greatest I have ever witnessed and I've seen it all.  They are so realistic and provide a nice counterpoint to the frantic flying wirework approach of the chinese.  If you are a fan of Japanese cinema you owe it to yourself to see these films.  I guarantee you will be utterly captivated from start to finish.",1020988800,8,698,4.464566929133858

8015641,5,B0001OGURC,"They bring in a Biwa priest who is blind like Zatoichi but his senses are even sharper than Zatoichi. He's also much wiser throwing a lot of his yin and yang advice at Zatoichi, making him think. Then of course there is the Samurai who is a master swordsman. Zatoichi vanquishes the Yakuza and kills the samurai unfortunately but the samurai is trying to get his mistress out of a brothel with the price offered on Zatoichi's head. A good movie where Zatoichi is the sort of anti-hero and there is never a happy ending of course.",1395187200,,529,4.463917525773196

8015644,4,B0001OGURC,"I will not bother to write a different review for each Zatoichi movie.  I have all twenty six of his movies and have watched all of them multiple times. Although the believability of a blind swordsman is next to nill, Zatoichi makes it believable because you will fall in love with the character.  Shintaro Katsu is one of my all time favorite actors.",1357171200,,351,4.555555555555555
8015645,5,B0001OGURC,"Movie #13, Zatoichi's Vengeance starts out with a rare found - a town where there are no gamblers!  Well, it started out clean but by the time Zatoichi gets there he finds out that the gangsters are moving in, demanding money in return for allowing the businesses to continue to function unharmed.  Zatoichi is only in town because he ran into a murder - one of those following the wishes of the dead man plots.  Common really.  But he gets involved with more than he bargained for - which is also common really.  Some of the acting, on the other hand, is not that common.  The Samurai character isn't good nor evil, the use of the drums during the final battle was an amazing idea, and the blind priest brings an added view point to the events.  Could they have been solved without drawing swords?  Is there more than one way to deal with the gangs?  Can Zatoichi put down his sword cane and find peace?",1296950400,,904,4.397590361445783

8015647,5,B0001OGURC,"This film introduces the memorable character of a blind monk who is Zatoichi's better in terms of using his non-sight senses. This offers and interesting glimpse into Zato's world as a blind man and the blind in general during pre-modern Japan.

Zato, as usual, finds himself caught up in some injustice and sorts things out with his sword. This is another beautifully done entrant into Ichi lore.",1198800000,,397,4.925373134328358
8015648,5,B0001OGURC,"The 13th entry of Zatoichi starring Shintaro Katsu is a truly excellent film. The title, ZATOICHI'S VENGEANCE, is also an apt title for this wonderful film. Zatoichi meets a travelling, blind priest who questions Zatoichi's life: By telling Ichi to put away his sword. And although the ending is predictable as far a the Zatoichi series goes, this one adds a little more depth to the character Ichi, and the character actors in the film as well.

One of the many highlights of the film is when the villians who take on Zatoichi, do so with more intelligence than one would expect. For example, they beat upon drums to confuse his heightened sense of awareness--knowing that his ears have become his eyes, so to speak. About time someone figured that out. He has definetly become a feared and respected opponent. His reputation has become too well known, and no longer is he some blind masseur who can be easily slain.

Also, when Ichi is being beaten up in the film by the villians, he does not act against his agressors. He is protecting the young boy in his charge with more than just physical abuse by not reacting: Ichi does not want to show violence in front of the child. Maybe to set an example for the young boy? The young boy in the film looks up to Ichi. Is Ichi trying to set an example by turning the other cheek? As with the end of the film, when Ichi leaves the child, he does so for the boys sake. He knows that he is not the example the boy needs in his life. And as such, he shows that he is truly an example of a decent and honorable swordsman, whom others should have emulated. Highly recommended. [Stars: 5+]

NOTICE: VOL.#14, ZATOICHI'S PILGRIMAGE [ZATOCIHI UMI O WATARU] has not been released to my knowledge in the USA. Hopefully it will. I don't know why it has not been released.",1157155200,,1804,4.460606060606061
