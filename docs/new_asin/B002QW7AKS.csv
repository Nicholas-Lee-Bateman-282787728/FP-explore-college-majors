3967959,5,B002QW7AKS,"If you hate documentaries/mockumentaries or slow moving character pieces you will probably dislike Paper Heart.

But if you love creative film-making, the idea of investigating the inner angst of love and/or the above genres you should probably give this little quirkumentary a shot.

Creative it is, plus clever and bizarre, this film follows Charlyne in her quest to discover what love is and ultimately her fear that she's broken for not believing in or experiencing it.

The most charming aspect of the film is the reenactment of the stories that people share with her. From the judge who rescued a lady in distress to Charlyne's own story the drama plays out in cardboard characters. She visits long-married high school sweethearts, a same-sex couple and Las Vegas wedding chapels. Moments of extreme awkwardness and tense conversation give the movie a bit of drama. The language and topic is mostly family friendly though sex is flippantly discussed by one couple. However, most kids wouldn't make it through the slow-moving film so you probably won't have to screen it.

I liked this film quite a bit, but I tend to enjoy documentaries and love mockumentaries. I rented Paper Heart but will probably be adding it to my library because I will want to watch it again.",1261440000,,1272,4.957746478873239
3967960,1,B002QW7AKS,"The faux doc style can be done well and be quite enjoyable. I am also a big fan of Michael Cera and find him so funny in fact that I can enjoy not very good films like Year One just because I find his delivery and persona so comical. I had such high hopes I almost bought this on blu ray site unseen. This film however lacks on so many levels that it simply didn't work for me. You may be able to enjoy a film with no coheret story line. Maybe you can enjoy one with stiff and wooden acting by it's lead. Movie don't have to be a laugh a minute funny, nor do they have to touch you with drama you can relate to. There can be a weak or uninteresting arc. Still, *some* degree of *some* of this would help it be entertaining. I found nothing to like here. I wacthed the film with my teen daugthers and they too were equally disappointed. I found myself just waiting for it to be over and thought seriously of shutting it off.",1261440000,2,923,4.021739130434782
3967961,4,B002QW7AKS,"Paper Heart is a fun little gem of artistic expression.  After watching the film, I wasn't really sold on it being truthful in its quest to find the true meaning of love or what love is for that matter.  I guess I'm not that smart but I wasn't sure if I was supposed to believe Charlyne's sincerity with her concerns with love or if it's just something ""cool"" to build a film around.

I felt the best part of the film was her ""relationship"" with Michael Cera.  And Jake Johnson was good as the ""director""; I thought he was the actual film maker throughout the film.  My least favorite parts of the film were the interviews except for the ones with the children and the gay couple.  Other than that, why is it that only older people have the best perspective of what love is or can answer the question of have you ever been in love?

If I take Charlyne Yi in the film seriously, I would have to say she's immature, not ready to know what true love is if she has to make a film about it and intellectualize it.  One scene had her say she wasn't in love although she was in  a relationship with Michael Cera, and he was sitting right next to her when she said it.  I don't know if that was staged but Come on.  She's not 13 yrs. old, but some of the young children she interviewed have more insight and confidence than she did about love.

I will say the special features are what made me give the film 4 stars.  The featurette should have been part of the actual film and I liked the fact that Charlyne is a real, legitimate musician.  The comedian interviews were hilarious as well; those interviews should have replaced some of the interviews in the film.  I liked it overall, though.",1260662400,,1684,4.26813880126183
3967962,3,B002QW7AKS,"OK, I enjoyed this little film, but if you take out the two leads you are left with an empty meaningless film that has no purpose. The film is a documentary following Yi trying to find out about love from various people and while the crusade is interesting the results are rather dull....with the exception of watching Cera and Yi. It's certainly worth a look, but I won't be watching this a second time.",1260057600,,404,4.472972972972973
3967963,1,B002QW7AKS,"First off, let me just say that I ""get"" the movie. I understand the faux documentary style, the fact that part or all of it is scripted, etc. It just didn't work. The movie starts off documenting Yi's journey to find the meaning of love, but her vignettes didn't really capture enough interest. Perhaps it's because those were the unscripted parts, but I found them akin to the interludes in ""When Harry Met Sally"" with that movie having done them in a funny yet touching way. Along the way, she meets Michael Cera, who was the only bright spot in the movie, even if he's essentially playing in a style similar to other roles he's had (""Juno"", ""Arrested Development""). His character was at least likeable, whereas I found Charlene Yi to be rather annoying. Yi was just giggly, immature, and just not a captivating screen presence. Her (or her character) seemed wishy-washy and flaky. I couldn't relate or sympathize with her in any way.

The interludes in this movie also included some homegrown cardboard-cutout animation. I'll admit it was cute and different, and really would have amped up a much better movie. There was nothing laugh-out-loud funny in this movie, and as for touching, well Yi and Cera just have no onscreen chemistry. The movie is thankfully only 88 minutes long, but I actually found myself fast-forwarding about halfway through just to get to the ""relationship"" parts between Yi and Cera just to see how that played out. The movie aims for a ""HEA"" ending, or happily-ever-after ending, but because the camera is suddenly shunned from recording their lives, the audience is never shown what transpires to bring about the alleged happy ending. It felt disjointed and uneven. Even if this aimless movie attempted to be a character study, as that is all some movies ever are, it failed in that respect with thin, unappealing characters. Don't let the fact that the cast list includes Seth Rogen and Martin Starr fool you. The fractions of a minute that any of Yi's fellow comedians are onscreen isn't worth the price of admission.",1259884800,14,2049,4.837606837606837
3967964,3,B002QW7AKS,"""Paper Heart"" stars Charlyne Yi and Michael Cera.  Yi does not believe in love, or so she says.  At the very least, she doesn't believe in storybook love or the Hollywood mythology of love, and her own experiences have turned her into a skeptic.  ""Paper Heart"" follows Yi as she embarks on a quest across America to make a documentary about the one subject she doesn't fully understand.  Along her journey, Yi meets actor Michael Cera and a casual friendship builds to something more.
This film falls into the category of mockumentary, a staged documentary intended to appear spontaneous.  Director Nicholas Jasenovec manages to suggest that what we're seeing is real, particularly because of the subsidiary characters who chime in with their takes on and experiences with love.  Michael Cera is now well known from his many feature films, so it's initially confusing to see and hear him referred to by his real name, but ultimately the viewer falls into the spirit of the movie and goes along for the ride.  Cera plays himself much like most of his screen characters -- sweetly shy and likable.  The Blu-ray edition contains a making-of featurette; the music video ""Heaven"" performed by Yi and Cera; ""Paper Heart Uncut,"" featuring outtakes and Yi having trouble with some of her lines; famous comedians commenting on love; and deleted scenes.  ""Paper Heart"" is also available on DVD.",1259366400,,1384,4.956709956709957
3967965,5,B002QW7AKS,"As a general rule, I don't read reviews of anything or pay any attention to critics (even internet-nobody critics like myself). To paraphrase the great Henry Rollins, the vast majority of 'em are not worth the food they're fed.

So for that, I thank those critics in question. And that's where my use for 'em ends.

Most of the criticism levelled at Paper Heart that I'm aware of has to do with it not being a ""true"" documentary (though Charlyne and director/co-creator/co-writer Nicholas Jasenovec themselves have CLEARLY stated in many interviews that it is, in fact, a ""hybrid documentary"" that, according to the official Paper Heart website, ""combines elements of documentary and traditional storytelling, reality and fantasy to bring a fresh perspective to the modern romance and redefines the classic love story"") and the relationship between Charlyne Yi and co-star Michael Cera not actually being real (please refer to my parenthesesed remarks immediately preceding these parenthesesed remarks).

3967968,3,B002QW7AKS,"Perhaps as whimsical and spontaneous as the very nature of true love, Paper Heart examines the varying degrees and definitions of that magical feeling with little finite direction, but the quirky characters and creative presentation balance out a wandering plot. Halfway through, the documentary approach gives way to the fairytale romance it set out to disprove, somewhat negating the efficacy of documenting reality, though the seamless blending with narrative storytelling does provide a uniquely intriguing result. Only upon outside investigation will the elaborate faade peel away; but almost certainly research will be done by those finding themselves drawn to the lives portrayed onscreen. While the film may not tell you what love really is, it might angle your pre-existing notions about the subject towards something more promisingly optimistic.

A somewhat pseudo-documentary romantic comedy, Paper Heart follows Nick (Jake M. Johnson) and Charlyne (Charlyne Yi) on a cross-country journey to document what exactly ""love"" is. Interviewing ministers, happily married couples, chemists, romance novelists, divorce lawyers, a group of children and more, the determined young girl attempts to find definition and perhaps even experience the mysterious emotion. But as they travel across the United States and even venture to ""The City of Love"" her pessimistic denial may hinder her chances at finding real happiness.

Love can be defined in countless methods, as well as be interpreted in an endless amount of ways. But we already knew that. Paper Heart doesn't educate audiences on the many hypotheses, nor does it clarify the answers. It merely makes a social commentary on the subject. Movies and fairy tales have a lot to do with skewing perceptions on love and it seems that people are generally a bit skeptical. But whether it's a chemical reaction, a drug-induced state or a mystical phenomenon, the film only serves as an experiment in love - under the constant bombardment of cameras. The nonexistence of privacy is such a distracting factor that real love never has a chance at developing normally.

Paper Heart proves that Michael Cera is the same in real life as he portrays characters in film. It also proves that anyone can make a movie provided someone famous or well-connected is involved. Regardless of how much is staged, giving it a half-documentary feel, the stories by real people prove to be the most interesting. Yi and Cera's chemistry is like something out of a movie, and considering the involvement of the filming crew, it's never really more than that. Perhaps most unique is the improvised documentary approach, convincing us that the editing and presentation is based almost entirely on how an undetermined romance plays out. The editing with stylized paper dolls is similarly amusing, but in the end, Yi's beliefs don't really change. It's not about her inability to love, but rather her unwillingness to define it.

When a relationship is forming, it's fragile and I never liked it when nosey friends offered their outsider perspective. The two people involved often don't know what's going to happen tomorrow, next week etc. Maybe nothing. Such an event could be filmed and documented but I feel these moments are too private no matter the outcome. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but huge fans of Michael Cera.

3967984,4,B002QW7AKS,"I'm not a fan of movies that come off as a reality-type production. I can't stand reality television so I avoid anything close to it. The reason I gave this movie a chance was because of Charlyne Yi. I enjoyed her on House. He awkwardness may feel funny to some, but she's a lovable actress where her awkwardness only adds to her delivery. When she wants, she can be quite funny in this film. Her laugh is infectious and her smiles makes you smile.

The movie itself is alright. I did get a little aggravated with the ""reality"" theme is presented, but I tried to focus on the fact that this was supposed to feel more like a documentary and not a reality show. The idea of the ""documentary"" was that Charlyne (playing herself) didn't believe in love so she goes on a journey to various cities, asking people from all walks of life about what they think of love. As the story progresses, she meets Michael Cera (playing himself...sort of) who becomes interested in her and they develop a relationship while she films the documentary.

While Yi is fun and enjoyable, Cera feels wooden and rehashed. I don't have any sort of dislike for him, but having seen some of his other work (Arrested Development, Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist), it feels sort of like he is just playing the same character over and over again. Seeing himself play himself feels weird and at times, I have a hard time buying it. Charlyne on the other hand is who she is and her work in this film is different from her work on House. In the additional material on the Blu Ray, she openly admits she's never really acted before and doesn't know how to do it (this was filmed before her time on House). When she is asked to look sad during filming of one of the scenes, she admits to having no idea on how to perform it. Still, her charm supersedes her shortcomings and you forgive her for her lack of acting skill (she's gotten a little better).

The documentary parts of the film offer some interesting stories about how people met and fell in love. There are also small animated scenes that give the movie a very film festival feel which is nice.

I'd contemplated buying this movie a while back, but had waited till I got a blu ray player. The blu ray transfer looks pretty good. The picture is sharp and clear with no real issues as far as color, grain, or sound. The extra content is nice. My only real complaint is that while it's always good to have extras on a disc, Charlyne left me wanting more.

She traverses the country, speaking to people from all walks of life: scientists, married couples, both straight and gay, a romance novelist, a divorce judge and family lawyer who happen to be married, a psychic, musicians, kids.  All of those she talks to seem to believe in the possibility of love, and Charlyne wonders whether it could happen to her.

Of course it does.  Along the way she meets Michael Cera, apparently her actual boyfriend, as himself, and a small romance begins only to be interrupted and stifled by the fact that the director of the documentary within the faux documentary insists upon filming every intimate moment in the development of their relationship.  In spite of the deception built into the basic conceit, and in spite of the awkwardness of the leads, the film is quite sweet and tender and honest about love.  The film never gives away that it is not really a documentary -- and a few audience members of the Sundance premiere (where I caught this the first time) were shocked to discover that it wasn't all real during the Q&A period after the film.

Charlyne Yi has a sweet awkwardness and infectious smile, and an inventive way of telling stories: she creates clever cardboard animation sequences to illustrate the sincere accounts of true love her interviewees tell.  The film itself feels nearly as sincere, and holds up the possibility of love without closing on a ""happy ever after.""  Paper Hearts is an inventive and unusual and entertainingly unique romantic comedy.  If making the film doesn't entirely convince the heroine of the possibility of love, it should convince anyone but the most jaded filmgoer of the vital possibilities for independent cinematic reinventions of traditional film genres.

She wanders around asking other people about love, they share their stories and she tells them how she has never experienced anything like that.  I really like Michael Cera movies but in this movie he is just 'himself' so he is not funny and actually comes off like an ass.

for me, the most engaging part of the film were the interviewees, who each offered their insights on what's made their relationships work or not work. there are some genuinely sweet moments and those are the moments that really lift the movie, in my opinion.  the cardboard cut-out cut scenes, to me, seemed forced and overtly precious and cute.

you could make the argument that the director intentionally juxtaposed ""chuck's"" apparent cluelessness and naivete with more mature, wise, and obviously in-love people, but in doing so, i think he did chuck a disservice.

by the end, chuck's doesn't seem to be any closer to what it means to be in love, or have an idea what love means, and after 90 minutes of watching her mope around, it's not hard to see why.

Yes, both Yi and Cera are awkward.  I don't know about Yi so much, but that's Cera's M.O. so I'm surprised by other viewers surprise regarding the awkwardness in this film.  That's part of the story and its charm.

Charlyne meets Michael Cera at a house party and a friendship begins to bud. After a short time, Mr. Cera would like it to develop into a romance because he falls in love with Charlyne.

As Shakespeare once wrote, therein lies the rub.

I guess love is something different for every individual and we need to discover what it is for ourselves. People can help us but the conclusions we draw are our own based upon our individual life experiences. And so it is for Ms. Yi.

I had to watch this one twice before writing my review. After that first time, I wasn't quite sure what it was that I'd just seen. It just seemed like I probably missed a lot seeing it only once... and I was right.

This is a movie that is based on a solid comedic premise... and then, in the middle, it changes into a different and maybe more solid, clever comedic construct. AND it makes you think.

Watching Charlyne Yi delve into this subject can be frustrating for you. I certainly was frustrated - twice. It was as if I wanted to help her... but I couldn't. Along the way, I came to appreciate a little more every woman I ever loved... even a little bit - and how much it meant when she loved me back.

Anthony James...great accurate review!

My wife happened across this unique & charming flick and we really enjoyed it for what it was. A true ""Hybrid' doc for the reasons Anthony J already stated in his review. Genuine interviews with real people yelling stories about their relationships mixed with a 'created' stories around the interviewer, her film partner and Cera, mixed with the very creative and entertaining & illustrative puppetry segments  = a hybrid.

I thought it was obviously clear in what it was and it didn't pretend to be anything but, so i too don't understand the 'not a ""real"" documentary' criticisms. Ah well, i'm pretty much not such a fan of 'purists' in any area anyway so i'll let them stick to their 'purist' guns and complain while i enjoy odd little pictures like this one.

I too was VERY intrigued and charmed by Yi and her obvious creativity and perspective in many areas of this film, as well as her social quirkiness, subdued wit, charm & smile  ...and i look forward to seeing more from her in the future. I like the way she thinks & creates as an artist. I also agree that Jake Johnson deserves mention for his understated approach to his character.

That aside, the movie is dull.  The plot is a decent idea, but the set-up takes far too long.  And then once we get to the ""juicy"" part of the story, it's really not all that juicy after all: these two socially awkward characters never stop being awkward.  For me, the characters simply came off as shallow and annoying.

The movie was more a chronicle of two awkward people finding each other then being awkward in each others' presence.

But forget about all that.  Forget about the oddball premsie.  This movie is great.  The interview sections are filled with poignant and funny tidbits from various people talking about their love lives.  Old married couples, gay couples, recently met couples.  The smartest thing about the film is that it avoids cynicism.

She's looking for something authentic, which she doesn't see in romantic comedies or epic poetry.  She talks to a lot of people who's continuing theme is just how great it is to be with someone.  There isn't much talk about the usual lovey-dovey stuff, flowers, hearts, feelings.  Instead, most of the talk focues upon companionship.

It's just nicer to go through all the crappy stuff in life with someone who shares it with you.

Yi's character finds her own kind of love with Cera, although she is loathe to admit it.  She wants a transformative experience, a sky-parting, doves in the air moment, the kind of thing that happens in the romantic comedies she rejects.  But that doesn't happen.  Instead, she finds someone who makes her happy.  Imagine that.

We'd decided to skip ""Shutter Island"" which has been pushed back far too many times to be as good as it looks and go home to watch the DVD of ""Paper Heart"" that has been hanging around since mid-December.

We popped it in around 8. We clapped for Martin Starr (we love him) and then came Seth Rogen (he's great too)...then Trent fell asleep.

I liked him in Arrested Development & Superbad & Juno and Nick & Norah (--but I have to say that because I know the author of the novel--I guess the way I said that hints that I didn't like the movie much {the best part was hunting for David and Rachel in every crowd scene. hint: they're at the end in the cafe})

Back to Michael Cera's appearance. I'm slightly disturbed that Charlyne and Michael seem to have the exact same mannerisms. I decide another beer might keep me awake. There's a gross one in the fridge left over from Christmas (yes, it's that gross; it's survived two months in the back of the fridge).

I like the self-conscious little puppetry scenes. They're cute.

I dozed again about 50 minutes in. (my notes here say ""fire wakes me"" OUR house wasn't on fire and our neighbors' houses are intact, so I'm guessing something burned in the movie...I don't remember). My beer trick is not working.

I dozed again and sirens in the movie wake me--oh, good it's over. Trent wakes up and says, ""You know few things are as unfunny as a movie that is convinced it IS funny.""

Yi doesn't believe that it does; or, if it does exist, that she is capable of feeling it. So she sets out to discover the answer.

Paper Heart blurs the line between fiction and documentary; essentially, it is a documentary INSIDE of a comedy. Yi travels the country to talk to experts and long married couples about the nature of true love, and all of these interviews are real and make up the documentary aspect of the film. Where the line blurs is that there is an actor documentary director that is fiction and during her travels, Yi ""meets"" Michael Cera at a party and they start fictionally dating in the film and they fictional director of course easts this up.

The overall approach to this film is very creative and enjoyable. Some might find it hard to determine the line between documentary and fiction, but most should be able to get into the film's groove. Where I felt the film didn't measure up is in Charlyne Yi herself. Having not scene her comedy act, I can't attest to how funny she is on stage, but in Paper Heart, she doesn't seem very funny. With the concept, you might expect the humor insertion of say Bill Maher in Religulous or Michael Moore in his films, or even Christopher Guest in his mockumentaries; but, Yi isn't really all that funny and the film lacks for that humor component to the discover of whether true love exists.

I think I was able to watch a total of about 15 - 20 mins of it, I'm not sure though - I think watching paint dry might have held my attention better (and maybe longer!)",1265846400,,527,4.087378640776699
3968058,3,B002QW7AKS,"I'm guessing that actor Michael Cera and comedian/performance artist Charlyne Yi are perfect for each other: both project a dubious combination of passive, geeky, and not-as-clever-as-they-think-they-are qualities that likely contribute to their being a happy couple but just might fall a little short in assuring an entertaining movie experience.

To be clear, ""Paper Heart"", which (if I understand things correctly) is a sort of fictionalized, mock documentary version of Cera and Yi's actual courtship, is watchable, and occasionally moving and funny.  But too often it's like spending too much time with your best friends' college-age kids: they're perfectly fine to talk to for a few minutes when they wander into your dinner party with their parents, but ultimately you just want to get back to your adult conversation over your nice cabernet.

Incidentally, the moving parts of ""Paper Heart"" come from the several interviews Ms. Yi conducts with actual couples (as well as one divorced guy still pining over his ex-wife), which communicate some genuine wisdom and insight about the nature of love and true connection with another human being.  The material involving Cera and Yi doesn't do that so much.  But again, maybe that's a generation gap thing; the issues and discoveries that are important and new to these two young people are things many of us older viewers have gone through eighteen times before and aren't quite so compelling to watch now.  Of course, this observation won't apply as much to younger viewers.

A variety of extra features pretty much give you more of what's in the movie, so you'll probably like or dislike them as much as you liked or disliked the movie.

Myself, I found ""Paper Heart"" to be mildly engaging and somewhat moving, but not worth a major expense or effort to see.  If you especially like Michael Cera and/or Charlyne Yi, you may feel more charitable toward the movie.

The scripted bits do not permit suspension of disbelief because the viewer is ALWAYS aware of the acting ... because it is so staggeringly atrocious. I've seen soap-operas that have more finesse. (Okay, I've never seen a soap opera but you get the point!) And, the actual interviews are complete hack: proprietors of a Las Vegas wedding chapel, a now-elderly pair of high-school sweethearts, divorce lawyers, a gay couple in NYC, professors of science, etc...

""Do you believe in love?"" That is what Charlyne Yi who is from California is asking. She has a production crew she takes across the country asking her friends, children, strangers, middle aged, and also elderly people if they believe in love. Charlyne, aka `Chuck', does not believe in love and wants to know what others think of love. During the filming she meets Michael who is a boy from Toronto. During the movie she is interviewing people about love. She goes all over the country and the couples she meets and even single people share their stories and as they tell them they are reenacted for us. I thought this was a really cute idea!

Throughout the movie Chuck is getting to know Michael on a personal level. Oddly enough I would not have seen these two actors as a couple but they were able to convince me that there was chemistry between them. I would not say she is guarded but she has no filter when she speaks of her feelings of love or lack of it. While spending time with Michael I think he slowly starts to break her out of the `I don't believe in love"" shell. He falls for her but she cannot say she is in love with him. At that point they are asked to go to Paris to `end' the movie. Michael gets sick of the cameras and not feeling his love reciprocated, declines to go. Chuck goes on her own but is not having a good time. Production tries to get her to say on camera she is not happy in Paris because she is sad over Mike. She states she is sad because she could not tell Mike she loved him. She then says she wants to leave.

She goes to Brampton (near Toronto where Mike is from) to find him. She then tells the production crew to stop taping. At that point they did not have an ending: Chuck submitted her own. At the end Mike and Chuck's story turns into a reenactment that was played throughout the movie of the people that were `in love'. The reenactment is left for you to make your own interpretation of their story.

I highly enjoyed the movie and was laughing a lot! I think this movie is either going to be loved or hated by people. I cannot say I loved it but I really liked it! I am glad I saw it and was highly entertained!  I would recommend this movie, it was refreshing and something new.",1264032000,,3399,4.723440134907252
3968061,3,B002QW7AKS,"""Paper Heart"" is two movies. One is an interesting documentary about love, complete with some rather sweet interviews and discussions on what love actually is. The other movie is a rather dull, paint-by-numbers romantic comedy that doesn't work nearly as well.

Charlyne Yi is the interviewer in the documentary. She travels around the country and speaks with individuals, couples and a group of schoolchildren, talking to them about love. She talks with a gay couple who've been together ten years, a straight couple who has been together for seventy and a divorce court judge who is married to a divorce lawyer. I bet their pillow talk is interesting!

As she travels around she talks about how she's never been in love, she don't know what it is, and doesn't expect that she'll ever fall in love. Then at a party she meets Michael Cera (playing, as he does in every movie, himself), and the two begin a relationship. This is the fictional part of the movie and it's much less interesting.

The documentary is pretty fun. Yi has a good personality, and she does a good job of talking with people and getting them to talk about their lives and their loves. Some of these stories even get set to marionettes, and that's quite adorable and entertaining.

But the story part of the movie, with her relationship to Cera, is just not that good. These are two very passive people and while there is chemistry between them, it's not enough to hold the movie together, and serves as a distraction to the actual documentary part of the film.

It's a pity. Had this been a straight documentary it would've been much better. As it is, three stars; two for the story, four for the doc.",1263945600,4,1674,4.661016949152542

Since both actors play themselves, it became sort of confusing. Was this a real relationship? Or was it a gentler attempt at Andy Kaufmanesque/Borat type ""reality humor"", i.e. ""I'm serious, but I'm funny. Just kidding! No, I'm really serious...or am I?"" By the end of the movie, I was questioning whether the heartfelt interviews with everyday people were real or scripted. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it enough to give it 3 stars.

I'm a fan of Michael Cera's, and would like to see more of Charlene Yi's work. Seth Rogen has one or two very brief scenes.

3968064,4,B002QW7AKS,"""Paper Heart""
(2009)
----------------------------------
This is a fascinating faux documentary starring Los Angeles-based comic Charlyne Yi, one of the new generation of irony-drenched, deadpan performers clustered in the shadows of the Hollywood star system.  She's pals with several well-known performers, such as Seth Rogen and Bill Hader, as well as Michael Cera who plays her romantic interest in this exploration of the meaning of ""love"" in a cynical, media-drenched culture.

At the start of the film, Yi asks whether love is real, and if it is, will she ever find it, proclaiming that she doesn't believe in love and has never been in love. With a camera crew following her every move (in a fake reality show format), she travels across America, interviewing average people as well as her many actor friends.  The film's stated purpose quickly blurs and it becomes a movie about her halting quest for romantic love... Yi meets Cera at a big hipster-geek party, and they gradually hook up and decide that they are ""into"" each other; meanwhile, the film's director keeps the cameras rolling, and Yi begins to chafe at  constantly being under a microscope, and their budding romance starts to buckle under the strain.

The structure of the film flirts with being too-cute, yet is consistently engaging.  Initially, viewers have to adjust themselves when they discover that the movie isn't actually a documentary, and continually have to adjust their expectations of what is ""real"" and what is not; midway through the film, this process starts to reverse itself, and we start to look for the ""documentary"" elements to supplant the fiction: some of the best parts in the film are when Yi films interviews with non-actors who apparently believe that they are being interviewed for an actual documentary film.  Particularly appealing are a group of grade-school children who freely give their opinions about love and romance, and who even tease Yi for not being in love herself.

The balancing act between inspiration and preciousness is difficult to maintain in a project like this, particularly when the humor (and the humorists) are so deadpan and reserved; perhaps unintentionally Yi also provides a fascinating commentary on the emotional reserve of her generation (or perhaps just her clique) of too-clever, too-cool hipsters: what does love mean when you're too cool to laugh out loud or act silly when you want to? The scene on the movie's cover is of Cera and Yi ditching the slow-moving camera crew, a bright moment of symbolic abandon; we never know what they did on this brief fling away from the camera... but the film picks up instantly afterwards, with Yi at work again, sort of like the rest of us, never ""off"" for a moment.

Also fun are some of the extras, particularly a set of movie trailers made with various comics on the LA scene, some of which are pretty hilarious and outrageous.  Overall, this is an interesting film, not a classic or a true mind-bender, but an unusual warping of genres which offers a subtle commentary on the American culture of media saturation, self-absorption and overwork. Worth checking out. (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1263772800,,3178,5.036190476190476
3968065,3,B002QW7AKS,"Paper Heart is a pseudo-documentary that follows Charlyne Yi, as she struggles to understand what love means. The film begins with several instances of Charlyne interviewing people or talking to passerbys on the street about the meaning of love. However, as the film unfolds, the focus gradually shifts from interviews to the developing romance between Charlyne and Michael Cera, whom she meets at a party at the beginning of the film.

Paper Heart blurs the line between fiction and documentary to the point that it's difficult to tell for sure how much of the story was scripted. (However, I tend to think that most, if not all, of the story was scripted. For example, the 'cameraman' is played by an actor with the same name of the actual cameraman.) This film is somewhat interesting and has some moments that are funny in a quirky sort of way, but ultimately the movie left me feeling frustrated. Without giving away the ending, I'll just say that the movie ends without much of a satisfying conclusion.

This film is worth a watch for any big Michael Cera or Charlyne Yi fans, but will likely be a disappointment for general audiences.",1263772800,2,1141,4.786802030456853

She's just flat and boring and lifeless, barely a person at all. So what if she doesn't believe in love? I didn't believe in her character.

We enter this club by accepting free copies of products but we promise in return to submit an opinion.

Therefore, while this is NOT the type of movie I would have acquired, I am glad to have seen it for it is fresh, different from the ordinary sort of story / film and quite enjoyable.

Paper Heart introduced us to Charlyne Yi and Michael Cera who play the roles of a young woman who does not believe in love or fairytale romances and goes on to film interviews with many people to discover how they met, where the relationships started, why they chose one another and what is it that keeps them committed to one another through marriage.

During her travels she meets a young man, played by Michael Cera, who immediately likes her and pursues a relationship that goes from random encounters, to scheduled dates, to the beginning of a relationship that kept us wondering if they would finally marry.

Some of the scenes are rather funny, when they go into story telling, they do so through cartoons and we found ourselves laughing at the creativity and simplicity of a rather deep and complicated topic.

This film is what is known as a ""hybrid documentary"" because it blends fiction and non-fiction content as the story progresses. If you want a fresh view to the perennial question of whether love does exist, then this is a movie for you.",1263686400,2,1533,4.6213235294117645

Don't awaken love until it so desires (it did happen in the movie!). Pro: it's good to learn and ask question from people about love and how they come to it. Although the movie is more like interviewing people and their idea of love, it's the acting within the interview that is boring (and everything between it).

3968084,3,B002QW7AKS,"One of the surprise hits of 2009 was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/500-Days-of-Summer/dp/B001UV4XUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""(500) Days of Summer""</a>, which turned out to be one of the strongest and most innovative romantic comedies released in the past five years. The film casts off the formulaic chains of the genre and becomes something more, an important milestone in the evolution of contemporary rom-coms. Not only is the film a music-lover's delight (filled with killer tracks like Regina Spektor's ""Us"", The Temper Trap's ""Sweet Disposition"" and a smattering of Smiths classics), the unique non-linear narrative structure and the wonderfully soulful performances of Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt elevated this film to the top of many professional critics (and my own) ""Best of 2009"" lists.

""Paper Heart"" was conceived with similar intentions, it has the quirky sense of humor, the often awkward moments of young romance, a focus on music, and the unique narrative structure, with the story presented here in the form of a mockumentary. Charlene Yi is a curious choice for the lead, as she alternates between charmingly cute and outright annoying throughout the course of the film. Michael Cera, playing Yi's love interest, is a more reliable actor yet often appears confused and uninterested. I'll offer the benefit of a doubt here and assume his performance was intended to give off the effect of being in-the-moment, rather than seeming as if he regrets signing the contract for ""Paper Heart"". The film follows a pattern of random people musing with Yi about things related to love, some are celebrities (Seth Rogen, Demetri Martin) while others include an Elvis impersonator and a middle-aged fellow playing pool with Yi whilst discussing his love for his ex-wife.

The crux of the film hinges on a burgeoning romance between Yi and Cera which is supposed to contrast with her cynical views on relationships. This is an interesting idea, and certain sections of the film are rather engrossing, unfortunately many of the scenes are so painfully contrived, I nearly felt compelled to move on to something else. Case in point, when Yi visits the zoo to ""capture how animals express their version of love"". Of course, before long Cera ambles into the scene to supposedly add humor by taking an aside with the director and joking about it all being a ""deleted scene"". Alternately, a highlight is the first date of Yi and Cera, which features this amusing exchange:

Cera: Do you live around here?
Yi: (smiling) I don't wanna tell you where I live. I don't trust you.
Cera: Oh, okay. You don't have to, I can look it up.
Yi: (surprised) Look it up? Is it on the internet?
Cera: I can ask...someone.
Yi: You'd do that?
Cera: (nodding) Probably.

I must take exception with those who criticize their relationship, particularly the oft-repeated notion that the two have no ""chemistry"". Keeping in mind that both are quite young actors, Cera and Yi make an extremely cute onscreen couple, as they both adroitly captured the wonder, magic, and outright awkwardness of teenage love quite wonderfully. It was this element that endeared the picture to me, along with the unique device of using cheap paper and cloth cutouts of figures to illustrate some of the love tales told by the various interviewees.

This technique works because it isn't overused and is entirely more interesting than simply watching someone's face as they speak, though it would've worked better with slicker production values. This is one of those elements that's supposed to be funny because it's so amateurish, much like the bulk of the film is supposed to be funny because everything is so awkward and amateurish. I've used the word ""awkward"" at least three times so far, because that's the overwhelming feeling I'm left with at the end. I can, with a shrug, recommend a rental, as it's good enough not to be dismissed as hipster rubbish, but not nearly interesting enough to reward repeat viewings. Of course, this is assuming you've already seen the much superior ""(500) Days of Summer"" and desire another amusing, quirky, out-of-left-field celluloid rumination on the mysteries of love and relationships.",1262649600,,4245,5.200292397660819
3968085,1,B002QW7AKS,"First off, the writer/star of this mess, is she a comedian?  Really?!  I'm missing something here.  I must not be on the same planet as those who highly rated this movie.

The actual documentary footage of real couples was the highlight of the film.  Some of their stories were very touching-  and Charlyne Yi's cardboard cutout puppet shows to re-enact their stories were fantastic.

Michael Cera played the same role that Michael Cera always plays- but can you fault him for it?  Some one note actors are annoying and bad (Nicholas Cage) and some are annoying and good (Alec Baldwin)-  Michael Cera is neither annoying nor bad, but I do hope that he develops some range.  But for this role, he was what he is and needed to be.

The interviews with scientists:  you only needed one, not four, to get the point across.  ""Love is a chemical reaction in the brain, and maybe it doesn't work in mine"" does not require four interviews.  If they wanted to discuss evolutionary biology and love, that would have been one thing (and would have been a fascinating documentary), but here it was just a side note, but one that was dwelt on too long.

You don't need to know what's real and what's fake to enjoy this movie- that, for me, was part of its charm.  People watch those awful Reality TV Shows like The Real House Wives, and Survivor, and those Kardashean girls, or the playboy housemates and American Idol, and they aren't bothered by the mixture of reality and fiction - nor should you be here.  Just relax and enjoy the show.",1261872000,,1599,4.522648083623693

the plot

Charlyne Yi is a Las Vegas stand-up comedian/actress who is filming her own documentary on love.  She has teamed up with her friend Nick to direct it, as she interviews strangers on the street to tell her what they think about love, and more importantly to react to her proclamation on how she doesn't believe in love.  The movie begins in Las Vegas, but then moves to different areas of America (Albuquerque, Los Angeles, New York City and more) to interview different people in different places about love.

Her director and friend Nick decides to hook up Charlyne with his friend, actor Michael Cera, and it turns out to be a good idea.  Michael and Charlyne seem to hit it off as we see them go on their first date, have an awkward first kiss and generally get along with each other.  Nick then has a great idea to take this ""love story"" to the city of love, Paris France.  While Michael and Charlyne are confused about the reasoning to make this low budget film and make it international, and why and how would going to Paris further the story, Nick just sees this as an opportunity to fly to Paris on somebody else's dime.

the break-down

Charlyne Yi is an American actress in a handful of movies, but mostly in the extras category.  One way to help boost her popularity is to write her own movie, and then make herself the star of it.  The idea is ill-conceived, and hopefully ill-fated for her star struck dreams to come true from this utter mess of a film.  Charlyne herself comes across as a simple-minded, giddy-yet-stuck-in-the-grunge-era, twenty-something, prostitute-for-attention-and-stardom individual in this film, and I hope this is not the real personality of her.  (Boy that was a lot of hyphens.)  Yet, there was one scene where Charlyne had written a song called Smells Like Christmas, that was mildly enjoyable, maybe they should have focused more on her song writing talents.

The film feels very authentic between herself and Michael Cera, who have been dating for three years up until the release of this movie reportedly.  So, while the whole set-up thing from her director friend Nick was fictitious, the romance was real.  Viewing Charlyne proved to be a challenge for myself to not turn off the movie after only a half an hour; it took real self discipline and endurance to make it through this self indulgent travesty.

Even worse than watching Charlyne, was sitting through the long interviews with the everyday people and their thoughts on love.  This was meant to be in the vein of When Harry Met Sally, and maybe if these interviews were severely edited to just give the viewer the best of the lot instead of the whole enchilada, this wouldn't have been as tedious as it turned out to be.

The draw for me to come and watch this movie was Michael Cera.  I enjoyed just about everything he was in, and he was his usual likeable self in this documentary, but it wasn't enough to save this sinking ship by a long shot.  Everyone in the film plays themselves except for the smartest guy in the movie, Nick.  Nick was played by Jake Johnsonm I suppose he thought better of it than to give his real name.  There were some interesting cameos like Seth Rogen, David Krumholtz and some others, but again anything remotely good was overshadowed by the utter garbage which makes up the whole of this ""film"".  Avoid it if you can, actually it shouldn't be that hard to do.
