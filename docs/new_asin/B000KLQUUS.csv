2693289,5,B000KLQUUS,Gripping documentary style look at the south Florida drug trade of the late 70s and early 80s. Revealing interviews with former participants. The real Miami Vice! A must see for anyone with an interest in this subject.,1173312000,2,218,4.918918918918919
2693290,4,B000KLQUUS,This is a very interesting documentory that focusses on the cocaine culture in Miami in the 1980's.  It mainly consists of interviews of the actual people involved.  I highly recomend it to any one who is interested in this topic. I really enjoyed it the real people are better than fiction.,1173312000,2,291,4.686274509803922
2693291,5,B000KLQUUS,"I thought that this movie was extremely interesting. If you love Scarface then you will love this movie. There are so many similarities between this documentary and Scarface I could not believe it. This movie makes me want to go to Miami just to see everything that they talk about. I mean, Miami was made from drug money, how scandelous!",1172102400,4,338,4.65
2693292,3,B000KLQUUS,"The only reason I like it even a bit is because it is all about Miami and that is where I live, all the events happen right around my house. Other than that it is as boring as any other documentary, don't expect action like I did.",1172016000,,230,3.9148936170212765
2693293,3,B000KLQUUS,"This movie was overhyped, you only get face surface nothing that is really insightful. True the editing in this movie was very good, but this movie was not in depth as I thought it would be to much filler, more emphasis should have been placed on the Columbian rackets, Ochoa preferably. The movie has it points but the 2 hours really drags on Munday really was mundane and really never gave you antyhing interesting. The same can be said for the hitman from chicago he should not have been given the reigns to speak so long. Still its worth renting but not purchasing I expected more out of this flick.",1171152000,,603,4.490909090909091
2693294,5,B000KLQUUS,"Cocaine Cowboys is about as raw n' uncut as the ""Bolivian Flake"" it's centered around.  My Cuban squeeze and I caught the NY premiere of this flick and left the theatre amped! Being a product of the 80s and reading books like ""Killing Pablo"" and ""Hidden Fortunes,"" I was all too familiar with this flicks ill subject matter. It won't be long before this movie, (if it hasn't already) becomes a cult classic.  In addition, there's no question this flick will be highly embraced by the Hip-Hop community.  I can see cornball rappers now, making references to The Godmother, Jon and Rivi in their fictitious exploits of thugs, slugs and drugs.  The extras are cool compliments, but peep them with the commentary on for that additional 411.  Funny thing is, Director Billy Corben is so amped during his commentary, you might've thought he hit a line or two! lol

2693295,4,B000KLQUUS,"This was a good documentary. I live in miami, so it was cool to see how much this city has changed. By the time i got here in 1990 the cocaine cowboy thing was over. So i did not know too much about this. It crazy to know there were shootouts in malls ive been going to since i was younger, like dadeland mall which looks very different now and the mall of the americas (pan american mall in the early 80's). Overall this was entertaining even at 2 hours it doesnt bore you. i recommend it especially if you live in miami.",1169596800,2,522,4.077669902912621
2693296,4,B000KLQUUS,"the editing is seemless, from scene to scene, the two key persons although sat and talked, the connecting scenes to link their descriptions were simply perfect. the script was pretty tight too. when the 3rd guy, the chicago enforcer who later took over the killing jobs for that crazy woman drug lord, the storyline never fell apart, even it's still provided with slides. the sound track is also pretty good. i've never lost focus on the whole film, not like that pathetic 'shadow company', only provided something that we already knew and saw on all the tv channels news. the drug money indeed had made what the miami look as today, without it, miami certain would have just become an old geezers paradise.",1163462400,10,707,4.7560975609756095

As if that weren't enough, I also went to High school with the quintessential Cocaine Cowboy Mickey Munday, oddly enough I didn't make the connection till I watched this video 50 something years later, I recall him as a redheaded nerd who the girls wanted nothing to do with, if they had only known that one day he would be buying entire neighborhoods and burying trash bags full of 20s and hundreds.",1486771200,2,638,4.2809917355371905

2693311,5,B000KLQUUS,"This documentary is a must-see.  It starts out with the stories told by Jon Roberts, former model Toni Mooney (Robert's former girlfriend), and Mickey Munday, two men from two different backgrounds who got involved with the Medellin drug cartel as distributors and deliverers.  They got involved for the quick, easy money.  Criminal lawyers, investigative journalists who covered the Miami crime scene of the early 1980s, police chiefs and other people like former hitman Jorge Ayala also contribute to this fascinating chain of events.

Miami was a sleeping oceanside town in the late 1970s where Roberts  said ""old people sat around in rocking chairs waiting to die"" to the most crime and drug-infested city that supplied the drug to doctors, lawyers, professional football players, models and airline stewards by the early 1980s.  Cuban and Colombian immigrants quickly got into the business as well, and soon the business involved street thugs.  Killings between the Cuban and Colombian rivals soon overtook the city.  The 1979 Dadeland murders made national news.  Miami was the #1 murder capital in 1981. A 1981 Times Magazine report of ""Paradise Lost"" brought the drug scene front and center to the national public. One watches the entire community get involved, from one's quiet neighbor to the city itself.  Miami was the one town during the 1980s recession that flourished from the drug trade.  The excessive wealth, the squandering of wealth on drugs, sex, luxury cars is eye boggling.  Even politicians are mentioned in this documentary.

Roberts died in 2011 at the age of 63.  He only served three years in federal prison because he cooperated with police.  Munday served just under ten years.  Their stories still are valid today because new cartels are now doing the same thing along the US-Mexican border.  There is some graphic crime scenes and narrative in this documentary.",1479772800,2,1893,5.1743421052631575

2693313,5,B000KLQUUS,"Great documentary showing how the proceeds of drug trafficking and money laundering are actually used.  It opens the eyes to the public to show why the ""War On Drugs"" isn't really a war but more so a controlled epidemic.  You do the dirty work and we'll control the cash and how it's spent and who goes to jail and when so we can do the collecting and seizing of money and property and control the population as we see fit. This documentary skims the surface of it all but to those who choose to ignore it they will view it as just another film about drugs. Pity.",1479168000,,563,4.252336448598131

2693340,5,B000KLQUUS,"This is a documentary.  It is well done.  It covers a time in the history of Florida when cocaine was introduced in mass to the US of A.  The cocaine  came in through Miami.  According to the documentary, Miami would not be the Miami of today--a big metropolis-- had it not been for the illegal activity of the cocaine trade. However, what was the price for this growth?  A lot of lives were taken, a lot of lives were ruined.  This is one of the most fascinating documentaries that I have ever seen.  The producers, directors, etc. did an excellent job in the presentation of this film.  I was surprised by the fact that so many of the  players--the ones who did the murdering, the shipping, etc---are still alive (many of them no longer in prison) --or that was the case at the time this flick was made.  That was shocking to me.  There really isn't much justice in our courts.  Although that is not a theme of this movie, it was something I took from it, along with many other things.  People either forget or they weren't born yet when all of this was taking place--and it is surprising to me how few people think it could not happen again--even as it is happening again. But then every era has its miseries.  Today is it is ISIS bombings, the years before have been school shootings, and not too long go, myriads of drive-by's.  The good old  US of A was, and continues to be, built on violence, I think.",1476230400,,1409,4.357692307692307

It explains from how it all started to how it was done to whom were involved to how it was stopped. You do not know how bad it was until you watched this film. I drive through Downtown Miami and I see all these buildings which some can be seen in this film and are still standing until today. Scenes like the shooting a Dadeland Mall makes me wonder if every place I go to in Miami has some type of story from the 80's involving the drug cartel. I am Cuban born and a police officer, I met one of the the detectives in the film and heard stories from other cops about the 80's and I just can't imagine been a police officer during that period.

2693358,2,B000KLQUUS,"This could have easily been a 5-star documentary. It is extremely informative and quite mesmerizing while documenting the depth of the cocaine wars of the 70s, 80s, 90s and its Cuba-Colombia-Florida connections. Needless to say, I was quite impressed by the presentation of so much information on the build-up of the narcotics empire that became Miami. The interviews are fast-hitting and nearly unbelievable at how steep it developed in such a short time. Granted, I remember that time in my life and the endless reports of busts, homicides, bodies, shootouts, etc, but centering on how it was all fostered and maintained is still amazing. This is truly an enjoyable documentary whether you were an adult or child at that time, or not even born yet.

...now for the bad news.

I'm not about to be an apologist for any of the importers, distributors, hired guns, corrupt cops ANYWHERE in the process of defining the better part of 3 decades. There's no questioning how the influx of cocaine effected literally every major US city (especially Miami) during that time and still does today. However, the documentary ultimately comes-off as disingenuous because of a GIGANTIC, glaring hole in its presentation: the federal government's well known role in importing various narcotics into the US via Florida, Louisiana and (yes), tiny Mena Arkansas.***
Mind you, I was waiting... and waiting patiently for ANY mention of this obviously-large factor in the rapid distribution of cocaine throughout the US. And before you claim that ""Cocaine Cowboys was meant to concentrate strictly on the Colombian/Cuban violence,"" consider the tone the documentary takes in claiming the local/state/federal law enforcement was presented as being completely clueless about the myriad operations in south Florida. You can't honestly believe that if you've looked beneath the surface of this sordid operation.

Instead of even a scant mention of this role, the makers of ""Cocaine Cowboys"" decided to paint knowing distributors such as George Bush Sr. as somehow coming to the rescue of southern Florida. You've got to be kidding me, right? And no, this direct (via the CIA) role did not start with the Iran-Contra deal. Even the most limited research into long-time CIA pilot Barry Seal will reveal that this was a concentrated, long-term effort by the federal government to allow and even take part in the mass importation of various narcotics into the US. Sorry, but the fact ""Cocaine Cowboys"" mentions absolutely NOTHING about this severely detracts from it.

***Remember when I mentioned ""Mena, Arkansas"" as a major port of cocaine importation? Yes, it was and was a particularly ingenious destination for a skilled pilot like Barry Seal, who needed minimal landing lights in the field that served as the air strip. It is a one-railroad-stop town and was the last place anyone would have suspected for the dizzying amounts of cocaine funneled into the US through there... all with the direct knowledge of Governor Bill Clinton. If you like, you can see for yourself on youtube.com, as several informative documentaries have been done about this shadowy location.",1462060800,3,3143,5.181102362204724

2693405,5,B000KLQUUS,"I moved to Miami in 1987 to try a new life.  I worked eighty hours a week in a retail jewelry store in Sunny Isles, which is mentioned prominently in the movie.  I remember going to one bank and being told I did not have enough money to open a checking account - they wanted several thousand just to open a basic checking account.  I saw luxury automobiles all over the place and high rises going up as fast as they could get construction crews on the property.  I witnessed purse snatching, armed robbery, car thefts and thugs flaunting their money - I saw cigarette boats all over the Bal Harbor area that is mentioned in the movie.  In short this movie is spot on and in Miami if you kept to yourself and minded your own business you could still be a victim of the drug crime and although they were desperately trying the authorities had no control over the streets.  I also remember the paper listing bodies and giving their descriptions in the hope someone could come forward and identify them.  Miami is a great area and the people in general are law abiding and hard working - I admired the people who came from Latin America to make an honest go of a new life but the criminal element overshadowed the good folks and made Miami a virtual landmine of danger.  This movie is accurate and it is true that while Miami Vice and Scarface were sensational they were not that far removed from reality.",1429574400,,1401,4.403100775193798

2693471,5,B000KLQUUS,"This is such a great documentary.  For one, it is very educational.  I knew that Florida had some problems with drug smuggling back in the day, but I had no idea the kind of violence that was going on back then, and the crazy amounts of money these people were making, and even the struggles they had to store/spend/invest/launder or otherwise hide their money, they were making so much they literally didn't know what to do with it.

It has tons of interviews with people who were involved with the drug trade in that area at the time, and you get to hear what a mess it made of their lives.  This documentary not only is very informative, but it is also so stylish (kind of like Miami Vice type theme), it's just so fun to watch (that is, until they talk about the horrors that ensued from the trade).

I have watched hundreds of documentaries over the years on a wide range of topics, and this one would probably rank in my top 10 of all time.  A great, great watch.",1406160000,,969,4.2967032967032965
2693472,5,B000KLQUUS,"Well worth watching for the now somewhat forgotten history of Miami, 1979-85, when cocaine flooded the city and practically transformed it into the Latin playground it is today. People forget how violent a place was Miami back then. Columbian drug traffickers were slaughtering each other every day. The cops were outmanned and outgunned. No one was safe. This reloaded version of an earlier film adds more footage, better titles and music, and endings to the sagas of some of the players seen here, such as Griselda Blanco, the drug queen responsible for so many murders. She was assassinated in Colombia a few years ago. The main drug trafficker in the film, Jon Roberts, died of cancer. The hitman, Rivi Ayala, is actually trying for an early prison release, though he was tied to dozens of murders. The 1980s TV news footage alone is a hoot to watch. It's a long movie -2.5 hours - but you can pause it many times, as I did. Very enjoyable.",1405123200,,944,4.692771084337349

2693476,5,B000KLQUUS,"This documentary is just fantastic!

Not because of the clothes and the haircuts, the deep Latin English accent, or the cops that
are out of a Miami Vice surveillance van.

But because it talks about the rise and decline of Miami as the cocaine capital
of the USA through interviews by some of the main players. Most of them do not
look like drug pins or killers, but just as the gardeners that are doing your lawn.
All the violence, the excess, the heroes and anti-heroes go by your eyes on a quick
paced story that pins you in front of your screen despite its two and a half hours of duration.

This is not a story about the whys and the hows. It is just about opportunity and american
entrepreneurship, that along with Latin american supply of a particular product managed to
create a multi billion business that partially made Miami the great city that it is.

It is a must see documentary even if you are not interested in the subject.

2693499,5,B000KLQUUS,"I first wanted to watch this thinking it was based mostly on the life of Griselda Blanco.  Although there ends up being much about her in the film, the beginning didn't discuss her much.  HOWEVER, the history and knowledge given on the drug smuggling business into Miami was key to understanding it all and introduces two characters, Jon Robertson and Mickey Munday that really started the mass importing of cocain into the Miami area.  These two alone make the film so interesting!!!  About the time Griselda enters the picture I was appalled at the historical fact that Fidel Castro basically flushed Cuba of all it's, murderers, theifs, mentally insane, mentally challenged, homeless, etc.....into the Miami Harbor.  The thing is the United States supplied the boats to pick up 125,000 Cubans,  thinking they were refugee's who wanted exile from Cuba.  Fidel's plan all along was to rid his country of these type people.  Therefore, the crime rate in Miami soared.  Murder rates escalated and Griselda had all the scum, hit men and drug runners she needed out of these Cubans who would kill ruthlessly for her (aka. Cocaine Cowboys).  The film was very easy to follow.  I've watch many documentaries on the drug business and this was one of the most interesting and easy to follow by far.  Another crazy fact, is how Miami was built off of so much drug money and how that helped it to eventually become a very popular U.S. city again luring many to live and vacation there.  I cannot wait to watch part II ""Hustlin' with the Godmother"" and am now excited to hear that a screenplay has been written on the life of Jon Robertson that will be played by Marc Walberg in the near future.",1392681600,2,1685,4.72945205479452

2693548,4,B000KLQUUS,"A thorough and intriguing look at how the illegal drug trade transformed the Florida coastline, and how a once-sleepy retirement community became a wealthy mecca fueled by billions of illegal dollars flowing through Miami. If you enjoyed Miami Vice or Scarface, this documentary sets the backdrop to how the city became such an important part of the trade flow between South America and the United States.

It profiles a number of major players and interviews many of the people who made tens of millions by playing their role. It highlights some of the key events that changed the approach of law enforcement against a backdrop of increasingly brutal violence used by the cartels. But it also showed how the growth of cocaine was really more like an east coast gold rush that was infinitely more profitable - and dangerous.

Overall, this is a fascinating view of how drugs changed a city forever and offers some real surprises even if you thought you knew the history.",1347408000,,970,4.872727272727273

With first-hand accounts from many of the top people who were involved in Miami's drug scene (sellers, killers, police, etc) it provides immense detail about how people got involved with trafficking, how everything unfolded, and how it impacted Miami in the short term and long term. As an ex-Miami resident, I have to agree with another review who said it makes you think twice about what you're seeing in the skyline. The scope of what was going on is so large, it's hard to grasp, but I've never seen a documentary do it better than this. I will add that it's worthwhile to also watch the sequel, Cocaine Cowboys 2, which has Griselda's former boyfriend/drug dealer telling his side of the story as well, and gives you more background on Griselda's life.

2693564,5,B000KLQUUS,"I lived in Freeport, Bahamas from 1980-1983. All television and radio was out of Miami and West Palm Beach, and Miami was only 30 minutes away on a 747. I often attempt to describe what it was like there to friends: the Haitian boat people, the Liberty City riots, the Mariel boat lift and the Colombian drug trade. But my anecdotes fall short of the mark. Prior to seeing ""Cocaine Cowboys"", the best I could do was tell them ""watch 'Scarface'...with the exception of the final scene over-the-top hokey shootout, it was dead on."" ""Cocaine Cowboys"" captures the true picture of the era there.
Daily you would wake up, turn on the radio and get the body count: 3 men found in the trunk of a burning car; or a headless corpse found floating in a canal; or 4 men killed in a parking lot shootout, 2 civilians wounded in the crossfire. This was followed by an ad for Lanson's, a high end men's clothier, advertising a bullet proof men's dinner jacket, ""What the best dressed Miamian is wearing."" Driving down the Dixie Hwy. in Miami, you see a bus stop bench with an ad on the back: ""Protectar usted y su familia"" punctuated with images of an automatic pistol and a machine gun and an address on Flagler St. where you can pick yours up.
The movie speaks for itself just like ""Scarface"". I have no doubt the individual narratives are accurate and non-hyperbolic. The movie does credit the cocaine ""business"" with cash infusion into the area and the resulting uplift of the overall economy. However, it omits the psychological impact on ordinary citizens, who saw little of the cocaine bucks: fear of getting caught in a crossfire and the depression of living in a combat zone.
Also omitted from the storyline were some of the Colombian weapons innovations: the Colombians came up with armor piercing bullets and laser sighting long before the cops had them. Then the feds showed up en mass and the tide turned.
I gave the movie a ""5"" even though it was a documentary and had no plot, no real acting. But if you wanted to know how it really went down then and there...this is your movie!",1336176000,13,2080,4.564171122994653

This film documents the era and introduces us to the godmother of cocaine, Griselda Blanco, the Colombian woman who is credited with helping the infamous Medellin Cartel set up operations in the United States and with creating the motorcycle drive by killing popularized in Hollywood movies and TV shows a la Miami Vice. But Girselda Blanco was not fictional like Tony Montana in Scarface or Nino Brown in New Jack City she was a real life crime lord and vicious kingpin out of underworld lore.

Actual accounts from former smugglers, Law Enforcement and the people they were involved with really bring home on what it was like in Florida in the 80s. It does seem to glorify these sharp minded individuals who imported more dope, and made more money than i can possibly fathom. The tale always goes from ""We were on top of the world"" to ""Where did all the Money go?""  I always like to think that somewhere, someone was holding onto a large trash bag full of money for these guys like Mikey Monday, and Jon Roberts.  Roberts comes off in my opin as genuinely likeable in this recout as does Monday, the pilot, smuggler who just seemed interested in the money.

Roberts who just lost a long battle with cancer in 2011.

The smuggler's tale i feel is the best shown while the tale of hitman, Jorge ""Rivi"" Ayala comes off as ""Look how bad I am"" but then he's rotting in jail so i guess if it were me, I would do the same and save my rep.

The style of the docu is excellent and keeps me watching every time i watch it.  The soundtrack by Miami Vice's Jan Hammer is awesome, and very reminiscent of the now famous show.

For fans of crime dramas and documentaries, you'll love it, buy it now!!!!!

Of course, I can't help but think about what they would have been able to accomplish in a more legal line of work.

It's sad to see what these drugs did to the Miami Dade area. Bodies were piling up whereas they never had before. Cocaine (and later crack) had become an epidemic that was plaguing people from all walks of life.

2693596,4,B000KLQUUS,"Cocaine Cowboys (2006) by  Billy Corben, is a must-see documentary,
with several first-hand protagonists covering the Miami underworld
in the mid-70's to mid-1980's.

In dire straights economically during the early 70's, Miami turned
into a boomtown  over the 10 years, as  it became not only an
entrypoint but a revolving door in the ganja and cocaine trade,
with the associated money laundering of profits, from a monopoly
run  by Colombians and Cubans.

This narcotics prosperity turned into a bubble, fueling consumer
spending, ranging from dozens of banks opening up and receiving
cash deposits 50 times higher than usual, to the construction of
condominium and apartment towers, shopping malls, spikes in jewelry
and luxury car sales, yachts, single-engine aircraft, expensive
tailored suits, entire neighborhoods going up in value, mansions,
race horses, privately owned helicopters, nightclubs, cigarette
gofast speedboats, shortwave SSB radio towers and surveillance
gear, over 5 to 10 years.

Similarly to the Sicilian pizza connection of the time (made up of
lethal and independent rural-based  operators) the supply in Miami
stems from rural-based businessmen. P Escobar, F Ochoa and  Lehder
in  Medellin, Colombia, with a USA honcho G. Blanco.

First, it's all about the concentration of wealth and power at the
top, and  homicides running in the 100's at the bottom, with rival
gangs competing for sales market share, territory and control,
using Uzi's, M-16 or AR-15, silencers,  modified delivery trucks
used as tanks, etc.

Second,  the outcome of  economic dependency is a large collapse
in business ethics. The urgency in expanding the number of
officers, results in a compromise of hiring standards. Soon after,
payoffs, corruption and involvement of these in  narcotics
operations,  the cover of politicians in the US,  but also in
Nicaragua with Manuel Noriega and his banks  laundering profits
($10m in cash per plane) and by Colombian authorities,  with a
massive industrial farming of coca.

Third,  the federal branch comes to the rescue, from alarming PR,
turning the tides  of this conflict,  the forming of Centac-26 .
The laissez faire economics mantra changes, from the earlier the
use of Marco Isle, Everglades for aircraft and boats (each carrying
$31m wholesale, $1b retail), or barns as  aircraft hangars, or air
dropped  canisters, etc.

Fourth, the social upheaval of Miami is covered, such as the Cuban
boat lift of 1982, the gang  homicides, and changed recreational
attitudes  of wealthy Americans, snorting, free-basing or smoking
coca  casually.

A large part of the film explains the processes, strategies,
vehicles, logistics of how the import export was done and who was
involved, enough to keep the story spicy, upbeat and credible over
2 hours.

Strong footage  of rubouts is shows, not for the faint, confirming
a lack of humanity those, often done in broad daylight, involving
men, women but not only.",1270771200,,2950,5.341304347826087

My ""movies to watch"" list is so long I just kind of added it to the list and didn't worry too much about it. I decided to sit down and watch it last night and WOW! I am sorry I didn't watch it sooner. This is an explosive, exciting story of real-life drug smuggling, murders, and high living in Miami in the 80s. One thing I loved about this documentary was that there was no narrator. So many documentaries get bogged down because the narrator just drones on and on, and won't get out of the story's way. In this documentary, the directors let the subjects tell the story and it is way more authentic and entertaining that way. I also really liked the innovative visuals, using still photographs and cutouts of photographs to illustrate things.

This documentary makes an interesting point - as bloody and destructive as the Miami drug wars were, they did result in the construction of modern Miami. Although one person in the documentary says ""too many people died, it wasn't worth it"" you do have to wonder where Miami would be today without the massive cash influx provided by illegal drug smuggling in the 1980s. As someone who believes drug legalization (at the very least, for marijuana and ""softer"" drugs) should be more seriously considered, I thought the point was interesting and well-made. Think how much money is generated by the drug trade each year; then think about what that money could do if it were harnessed and controlled by the government, who would also have more power to regulate drug violence.

Still, this documentary really delivers on its larger than life characters and most amazing to me, the way the 80's drug trade really shaped the culture and economic climate of today's Miami.

It is the story of how the city of Miami changed from a sleepy vacation spot into the hub of the international cocaine trade in just a few short years.

Newsreels from the time bring back the styles and habits of the 1970s.  Interviews with real-life criminals who have served or are still serving time in prison brings the stories to a personal level.  There is money - millions of dollars in cash.  There are drugs - hundreds of tons of cocaine and marijuana.  There are clever schemes to hide it all.  And lots of ways to spend the money.

The participants who are interviewed are all nostalgic.  They explain how it all worked - how the drugs were shipped, how they were stored, and how it was distributed.  Their lifestyles were opulent.  It was exciting and fun.  The social effect on Miami was to bring prosperity to the car dealers and jewelry stores.  It was a kaleidoscopic world and a party that seemed that it would never end.

And then there was the violence.  We see a newsreel of a hit in a shopping center.  We hear an interview with a man now in prison who murdered a dozen people.  Often, even children were not spared.  There were Columbians, Cubans and Panamanians involved.  The worst was a woman who ran the whole business who is rumored to have had more than 200 people killed.

Eventually, the gangs were disabled, the perpetrators were sent to prison and the whole cocaine traffic ended.  Miami seemed to be destroyed.  But then it came back.

The best part of this film is that it was all real and the filmmaker presented it well  It was all done rapid-fire.  There was not a dull moment.  I enjoyed it immensely.",1230768000,,1829,4.450151057401813

A documentary that details the inception of the cocaine drug trade in America from the early 1970's when Columbian dealers dropped a few ""suprise"" kilos in bags of marijuana which was easily smuggled in via boats to the Reagan Era which spent millions ""controlling"" the drug trade in South Florida. ""Cocaine Cowboys"" presents an interesting perspective on the economy of the 1970's and what kept Miami afloat.  Director Billy Corben tells the story of a Miami skyline built not of bricks and steel, but bricks of cocaine via interviews with some interesting smugglers, assasins, dealers, Ford models, and newscasters.

According to the film, in the 1970's marijuana was easily smuggled into South Florida. People openly off-loaded bales of marijuana from sail boats on public docks without interference. According to dealers in the film, in the 1970's cocaine was only used by medical professionals who could afford the several hundred dollars a gram price tag. Eventually the Columbian cartels found smugglers willing to import the drug and used Cuban distributors which made the drug readily available for everyone. The drug was first used by low-lifes-Castro refugees set free after he opened his prisons-and worked it's way up the ladder to become a party drug for all echelons of society. While the rest of the country struggled with 18 percent rates of inflation and a crashing economy, the Federal Reserve in Miami had so many deposits they had to stay open 24 hours a day. At one point the film says that federal investigators estimate one bank should have taken in deposits of around 2 million a year but was actually taking in 12 million. And that was just one bank. Hundreds opened their doors to launder money for the Columbian cartels. With the cocaine economy came Mercedes dealerships, a run-up in housing costs, luxury jewelery dealers. The Mercedes dealership in South Beach had a three month waiting list while the rest of the country was struggling to save for a Honda Civic and the gas that went in it.

It's never stated, but it sounds like the cocaine economy kept the whole country afloat for a while. The situation continued for about ten years until so much cocaine was being imported that the price dropped, violence skyrocketed, and the government finally decided to start busting people-not coincidentally at a time when the economy had recovered. Most of the people interviewed for this film were or are in jail. But many people in legitimate businesses that benefited from the free flowing cash from the cartels, used their new found wealth to build the Miami skyline. A doctor who is interviewed for the film said that at one point he was driving to work and counted more than 30 skyscrapers going up in the Miami skyline-all from the profits of drug money.

Some of this documentary will be familar. There have been enough films and sitcoms about cocaine in Miami that most of us know the tales. However, the positive economic impacts of cocaine were totally unknown to me. It's amazing and somewhat shocking. The vintage news footage and interviews make this documentary really interesting and keep the essential message from becoming a boring classroom lecture from the Federal Reserve chairman.

As a federal law enforcement officer familiar with narcotics smuggling I highly recommend this documentary to everyone.  It is one of the most in depth reports ever composed on the drug trade between the United States and Colombia and some of the players who were involved, such as the infamous ""Godmother"" Griselda Blanco.  What sets this apart from other similiar videos is the first hand accounts of three men who were neck deep in the circles of drugs and violence.  Their stories and accounts are spell-bindingly accurate and reek of the danger, violence and power that is narcotics smuggling.  Five out five and very highly recommended!",1197676800,3,1000,4.881656804733728
2693637,5,B000KLQUUS,"This kind of looked like it was going to be a seriously low budget no frills production, but it turned out to be a first rate documentary. Cocaine Cowboys explores not only drug traffickers and the cocaine trade, but also the rise of a great American city. Florida in the seventies was ""wide open,"" and, as always, the government was several steps behind the criminals. The venture that Mr. Roberts had with Mr. Munday flying ""product"" in and out of Columbia was pretty fascinating as were the links with the Ochoa Cartel. The interviews are excellent and these fellows, along with hitman Rivi Ayala, tell us just about everything we need to know about a period in Miami's history when it was wilder than the wild west. Godmother Griselda Blanco was a fascinating, although detestable, character, and one I had never heard of before seeing the documentary. Were it not for drug cash would Miami be what it is today? Quite doubtful.",1187913600,,931,4.753086419753086
2693648,4,B000KLQUUS,"This movie almost makes the case for legalization. Can you imagine making $1.2 million for one trip? I'm still blown away by the amount of money these guys earned. On the other hand, the violence that accompanies the money is scary. In the end, Miami, like Hong Kong, prospered by satisfying the needs of the middle class, the impact of which can still be seen. On another note, the people involved, celebrities, doctors, lawyers and politicians is unbelievable.",1186963200,,462,4.935897435897436

2693653,5,B000KLQUUS,"This story is quite an eye opener to see placed together in one spot.  I remember watching bits and pieces on the news over time when I was a kid about Pablo Eschibar and the Medien Drug Cartel, but to actually see all of the information in one place is quite impressive.  This story is not only the story of the growth of the cocaine industry, but how the quite little vacation spot of Miami grew into a giant global competator of market cities.  The interview detail was quite informative, and does capture the gruesomness of the violence that occured.  Definately worth checking out if you like gritty documentaries.",1180915200,2,619,4.651376146788991
2693654,5,B000KLQUUS,"This movie was just what I expected it to be, GREAT! I love watching movies about the cocaine era.

2693656,4,B000KLQUUS,"Cocaine Cowboys is an aptly-titled 2-hour documentary about the cocaine economy which built modern day Miami.  The documentary covers the flashiest crimes and personalities in the cocaine explosion of the 1980's.  Director Billy Corben tells the story of the city built on cocaine via interviews with smugglers, hit men, and dealers.  This isn't a socio-political look at the drug trade, rather, it is a down-and-dirty Wild West story, complete with a Godmother who could give Scarface a run for his money.

It does drag in parts, and could have been told in a more streamlined fashion.  Even at 2-hours on length, the DVD has another two dozen deleted scenes, for anyone who wants more time with the men on the street.  Anyone who enjoyed Scarface or Blow needs to pick this one up, as does any armchair economic historian.",1177286400,35,824,4.892086330935252
2693657,2,B000KLQUUS,"This is a great movie if you enjoyed watching film strips in 6th grade.  If you pop this baby in your DVD player, you will be asleep within 35 minutes.  This movie makes cocaine dealers out to be criminal masterminds, when all they really are is shady, good for nothing bums. This could have been a 1/2 hour special on the History Channel and, you'd get the same amount of useful information.  Honestly, if you want to get a good idea of this film...just imagine watching an episode of Miami Vice but, subtract all the action scenes.",1177113600,3,533,4.474226804123711
2693668,4,B000KLQUUS,"This movie is well crafted and edited in such a way that you feel like you have been transported back to the mid 70's. The soundtrack, the backdrops and the editing style strictly reflect the raw nature of the gripping documentary. My only drawback on this 2 hour epic is the dramatic change an hour into it from the American point of view to the Cuban/Columbian point of view. A little too hasty and tended to drag in parts. Other than that a must have for lovers of Scarface and Miami Vice. A lot of interesting facts, so many so that it's hard to believe that the two main narrators in this doco are still alive.",1175385600,8,615,4.310344827586207

The thing that has me glued into watching it, is that they have the actual people who were really doing the dirt telling their stories, how the directors got them to do that beats me. I can't wait to get home and watch the rest of it. ridiculous amounts of cash, weapons,drugs. I must buy!",1175126400,,415,4.073170731707317

2693672,5,B000KLQUUS,"""Cocaine Cowboys"" is an excellent documentary; realistically portraying the growth of the drug trade during the 80's & 90's dominated by the Colombian Mafia. It also shows how ""cocaine cash"" made the city of Miami, and to some extent the State of Florida what it is today. It is reality `Scarface' exploring and explaining the details of how the drug trade exploded in Dade County and its migration to Southern California. The interviews with reporters, police officials, hit men, and drug dealers provide a very real picture of the madness, murder and money that are an inherent part of the illicit drug trade. There are some very graphic scenes, but that' was reality in Dade County during the era.

The DVD also includes: 24 deleted scenes; with or without commentary by the director and the co-producer; The Charles Cosby Story ""Hustlin' with the Godmother"" including her plan to kidnap JFK Jr.

Two straws up!! A must see, I highly recommend it!",1174435200,3,950,4.894409937888199

This is a well done examination of the people & business practices marijuana/cocaine.

But to get a real cold shot of reality pick up Michael C. Ruppert's,""Crossing The Rubicon"". The drug business will never look the mickey mouse same.  Then have a couple of cool martinis, or as many as needed, for your subsequent attitude adjustment.",1173571200,2,522,4.842696629213483
