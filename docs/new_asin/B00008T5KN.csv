Even tried to buy it when in London (no luck).  The cast is wonderful
and the writing is superb!  This series is British comedy at its best and
is suitable for the entire family!

The series centers around Hester and William, a couple in their mid 40's.
Hester is a cordon bleu cook and William is an accountant.  Their children
are grown and out of the house on their own.  Hester's mother lives in the
granny flat in the back garden and she is being persued by her ex-husband
once again after walking out on the family when Hester was a little girl.
The constantly borrowing neighbor, Sonia, is a comedic star in this series.  Each episode is as good as the previous one.  You won't be disappointed!",1185840000,3,776,4.422535211267606
