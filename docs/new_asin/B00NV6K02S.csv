6680577,5,B00NV6K02S,"I plan on purchasing this, to complete my BluRay collection soon, but I've watched the season on Netflix.  As everyone else has stated, this entire series is great.  It continues to tell compelling stories throughout (yes, there are a few Jar Jar, or C-3PO episodes that probably could have been skipped, but even those use their subjects well).
This season was supposed to be 22 episodes, as also stated before, though, only the mostly produced 13 episodes were allowed to be finished.  There is 4 solid story arcs, I particularly liked the first one centering on the clones, and the final one with Yoda.  As a whole, they're a solid addition to the series.
The problem?  The other 9 episodes.  Season 5 ended very cliff-hangery with Darth Maul.  I know that was finished through a comic book, though I have yet to find and read it.  (I much rather would have been dazzled by this series animation, which I had come to love, and be amazed by) They also took Ahsoka and Ventress a little further, I believe, in a novel.  Again, I would have loved to see these in the series, despite the fact, that I'm sure I could get more out of the novel.
I would have loved a more definitive end to the series, since this was supposed to be the last season all along; something that lead into Episode 3 directly, similar to the Tartakovsky series.
In the end though, this was more than I expected when Disney cut the cord.  What we got was great, but if you're looking for closure, you won't get it all.",1415059200,2,1490,4.464944649446495
6680578,5,B00NV6K02S,Great series! I will be adding this to the collector's edition to complete the series. I'm very grateful Disney put out the lost missions so this purchase is another way of showing my support.,1414800000,,192,4.676470588235294
6680579,5,B00NV6K02S,"Overall, this is one of the best TV series I have ever seen, and until now, the best addition to the Star Wars mythology. Is a pity that end so abruptly, now with The Lost Missions (Season 6) I say goodbye and miss you The Clone Wars!",1414454400,3,234,4.0
6680580,5,B00NV6K02S,"I watched all the seasons back to back (Bought the complete Blu Ray set here, and then watched this season (Season 6) on Netflix.  The entire series was great, and these last 13 episodes, in my opinion, were the best of the series.  It's unfortunate it came to an end, but these last episodes were definitely not just a throw together wrap up.  They had some of the best story arcs, and visuals, of the entire series.  While several arcs in the first 5 seasons, sometimes felt like they could drag a bit, or felt like ""fillers"", This last set kept you wanting to just watch ""one more"" before ending your marathon (I ended up watching the entire 13 episodes in one Saturday, and wishing there were more).

Although I'm sad it's over, this was a great ending to a great series.",1414281600,130,775,4.429577464788732
6680581,5,B00NV6K02S,"I saw these episodes on Netflix, a great fan of the series already. So I can only comment on the episodes themselves, not the DVD presentation, but I was very happy with the final season, despite the season being a little shorter than was originally planned, it still maintains the earlier level of quality and fun, and adventure. Also, the ending was very satisfying and ties up the series nicely.",1414108800,2,398,4.7

6680583,5,B00NV6K02S,"It is a ""must have!"", this is a fundamental piece in the Star Wars Universe, not only for Episodes I, II and III, but also to the first Three movies, where we learn how Yoda and Obi Wan were taught by Master Qui Gon Jin to dominate the force and speak through it.

I really recommend this series, it is my favorite along with the Season 5.",1413504000,16,339,4.059701492537314
6680584,4,B00NV6K02S,"It is sad that the show had to end like this
I am also a huge star wars Fan,
Since Disney took over they just let it go and been waiting for a season 6 and then they said no chance of that so this is a
good thing to get out and have for any collection.
Good luck to all and hope you can also get Disney movie reward points with this purchase when it comes out",1413417600,4,359,3.6153846153846154
6680585,5,B00NV6K02S,"Season Six of The Clone Wars is a great addendum to what was/is a fabulous television series!

Katie Lucas makes her glorious return in the first arc, which I consider to be the best of the season. It's a very personal and exhilarating story about one of the characters without a set future (a common tension killer in show that serves as a prequel) which keeps the tension and the stakes high.

The Clovis arc is a holdover from Season Five but fits just as well here. It's really fascinating to take a look at Anakin and Padme's relationship in a more intricate way than we've seen in the past.

The Jar Jar arc is a lot of fun (once you get past the Gungan-speak) and contains some of the most beautiful animation in the entire series. The Bardottan culture is definitely one to remember and the duology will remind you why you want to read Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir afterwards (NO Maul appearance; just watch).

The Syfo-Dias arc that concludes this half-season of episodes is heralded as the best of the series. I still believe the opening arc of this season and the Ahsoka arc that closed out the show's run on Cartoon Network have this one beat but this arc is in no way overrated. It answers questions about the saga, overall, and a contains quite a few excellent, chill-inducing moments.

It may only be half as long as the other seasons but the stories are still fantastic additions. The fact that Disney was willing to spare some of their newly acquired MVPs to stay and work on these last several arcs truly is a testament to their dedication to the fans and their intention to keep making great Star Wars. So check this out and continue right on to Star Wars Rebels!

(I will update this review once I have seen the story reels for the unfinished arc in the special features.)",1412726400,70,1791,4.478527607361963

6680589,5,B00NV6K02S,"For a while, seasons 4 and 5 were getting monotonous, but then they bust these last ones out! Yoda's adventures are incredible storytelling. It really fits well into the Star Wars narrative, and develops the characters well. I am glad for these episodes. They are among our favorites of the entire series.",1512950400,,305,4.884615384615385

6680591,5,B00NV6K02S,"If you've made it to Season 6, you may be wondering if it follows in the mostly lighter-hearted, more family-friendly vein of Season 5. It doesn't. I enjoyed Season 5 for what it was, and there /was/ some darkness mixed in with the light, but Season 6 brings more of that darkness and complexity back. It also takes a mystical journey with Yoda that's one of the series' highlights.

As with the ""complete"" collection (Seasons 1-5), I'd give this Blu-ray 4.5 if I could. Per precedent, there's a lot packed onto relatively few discs---in this case, thirteen 22-minute episodes plus bonus features on two discs---but, as before, the image doesn't suffer much; generally, it looks and sounds fantastic.",1508976000,2,700,4.932203389830509

6680603,5,B00NV6K02S,"Star Wars: The Clone Wars: The Lost Missions is a 2014 release. It is the sixth and final season of the venerable animated Clone Wars series. For some reason, this season is not included with the Clone Wars compilations, which only include seasons 1-5.

The Lost Missions is most definitely worth your time, whether a die hard fan or just a casual viewer of the series. There are a total of 13 episodes in the season, and four story arcs spread over those 13 episodes. All of the story arcs are excellent and contain a real variety of characters, worlds, situations, and stories that will keep the viewer entertained for all 13 episodes. The last story arc in particular is excellent (one of the best in the entire six seasons, in my opinion), and really helps to provide a sense of closure to the series. As with the other seasons, The Lost Missions contains great voice acting, superb music, spectacular visuals, and that sense of wonder that makes Star War so magical. The documentary contained in the set is also interesting, but it did not specifically address any of the episodes in the season, which I thought was kind of a letdown. Other than that, I much enjoyed The Lost missions and am sure you will too.

In Summation:

The Good:
-great story arcs
-variety of stories, characters, etc.
-spectacular visuals
-provides a sense of closure to the series
-good voice acting
-good music

The Bad:
-documentary doesn't discuss specific episodes in the season",1498435200,3,1463,4.748031496062992

6680615,3,B00NV6K02S,"These episodes were lost, and probably should have stayed lost.  They lack the energy and purpose of the first five seasons, and I believe it is because they failed to recognize that the series is really the story of Ahsoka and Anakin, with some Obi-wan, amd a few other bits here and there.

This series does 4 episodes on the Clones' brain control chips which is as exciting as a documentary (it took 15 seconds of airtime to explain Order 66 in the SW Rebels animated series).

Three episodes on some banking dispute that no one really cares about (did no one learn a lesson from Ep1?), with a poorly thought out and poorly executed romantic subplot.

A two episode Jar-Jar arc (did no one learn a lesson from Ep1?).

And a four-episode, mystic arc centered around Yoda, which felt slow and reminded me of the Mortis arc.

Watching this, all I could think of is ""why are they not continuing the story of Ahsoka?""  The four arcs they chose all are just -meh- stories.  I want to know what a fallen jedi does after they leave the order.  That is as interesting as the arcs on lightsaber creation, or the Citadel, or the Transosh hunting rituals, or the Zygerians.  Does Ahsoka go bounty hunter?  Does she seek out her family?  Does she join some militia or crime syndicate?  Does she re-unite with Ventress?

The lost missions show why the series was ultimately cancelled.  They lost track of what made the series entertaining.  They picked mediocre stories about boring topics and less interesting characters.",1490486400,2,1511,4.666666666666667

6680631,5,B00NV6K02S,"These final 13 episodes of ""The Clone Wars"" are among the best, examining the nature of the Force, the ability of Clone Troopers to resist the programing of Order 66, and even making Jar-Jar likeable. The animation and worlds are simply gorgeous, befitting the infinite possibilities offered by the ""Star Wars"" Universe. The voice work continues to maintain the highest quality, with Mark Hamill making a guest appearance as the voice of Darth Bane. As much as I love Tim Curry, his voice work as Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious distracts from much of the story since it's so obviously his voice compared to Ian Abercrombie, who voiced the character in earlier seasons and did a better job imitating Ian McDiarmid's performance. As amazing as the stories in this season are, they feel like a bit of an afterthought since most of the series previously focused on Ahsoka Tano and her place in the Jedi Order. Once the writers wrote her out at the end of season 5, the series was more-or-less wrapped-up with the characters able to move on to the events of ""Revenge of the Sith."" Finally, there is no true conclusion and several stories were left unfinished when the series was cancelled. Some, like ""Crystal Crisis on Utapau,"" are available on the Star Wars website as unfinished story reels. Another, ""Son of Dathomir,"" appeared in a Dark Horse Comic, and Christie Golden adapted ""Dark Disciple"" as a novel. The making-of documentary included with this set offers a nice coda and shows fans how the creativity employed in making ""Clone Wars"" led to ""Star Wars Rebels.""",1484352000,9,1570,4.906015037593985

6680673,1,B00NV6K02S,I was disappointed when I bought this. I thought the Lost Missions were suppose to include season 6 episodes 14-22 that never aired on TV or Cartoon Network.  The Lost Missions DVD is the exact same episodes in the Season 6 box set of episodes 1-13 that did aire on TV. For Season 6 was meant to have 22 episodes but was cancelled after the 13th episode aired on Cartoon Network. So now I have two DVD collections of season 6 that aired on Cartoon Network.  So if you already have the Season 6 box set you don't need to purchase The Lost Missions. What a waste of money and time watching the same episodes. I guess Lucas wanted to insure he made more money off it before he sold it to Disney.,1460937600,3,692,4.195488721804511

I didn't really like this series when it first came out, for I found the whole padawan thing with Anakin overseeing one got old fast, for I didn't care for the character much and the episodes were more on the kiddie side (hence a cartoon network prime time show) for my liking.

6680701,4,B00NV6K02S,"This is basically Season 6 which is now on Bluray and first appeared on Netflix. A great closing to the Clone Wars series to boot. I'm probably echoing many a Star Wars fan when I say you get way more on Order 66 & a good explanation of the much loathed ""medichlorians"" and good solid character arc wrap ups thought forgotten at the end of Season 5...certain clones.  My only complaint other than the upcoming spoilers is I was also hoping they would take us right up to the point where Episode III begins.

SPOILERS for Season 5 and Star Wars: Rebels...

When I first viewed this on Netflix I was disappointed in no explanation for Ashoka or Darth Maul in which we get more of Ashoka by the same creator & show runner in Star Wars: Rebels and I can suspect or hope more to come with Darth Maul in that regards...since even though the Son of Dathomir comic which was written by said show runner Dave Filoni isn't confirmed part of the new canon yet the Clone Wars series as a whole is.",1453075200,,985,4.313513513513514

It was originally planned for young audiences, but takes an adult, dark, grim turn after season 2 and this final season keeps you on your seat the whole time with heartache, awe, and insight into the tragedy that we know is coming in Episode III and beyond. Well worth watching, incredible storyline, perfect for the older, intellectual Star Wars fan and a young appreciator alike.

The series introduces ethical dilemmas, military philosophy, the psychological cost of warfare, as well as the humanity of the clones as they face an internal struggle for personal identity only tempered by their loyalty to their brothers.

In addition, the storyline is superb and the round characters are something that all audiences can appreciate.

For the serious Star Wars fan: Bridges the gap between The Clone Wars and Revenge of the Sith. Better than any of the prequels.",1451260800,,899,4.973333333333334

Not much for extras, but what is there is pretty awesome. It includes the unfinished Utapau story arc that was originally only available on StarWars.com. If you don't know what I'm talking about there were at least 2 story lines that the actors finished but the art department didn't. So as a treat to fans they put up them up online. And thankfully they also put the ""Crystal Crisis on Utapau Story Reel"" as a special feature for us all to watch at home. Yes, the animation is really blocky and stiff. But it's still totally worth watching.

So overall I would definitely recommend this for any fan of the show. I will however add the caveat that I don't think the standard price is worth it. It lists for the same price that the other full seasons go for but with barely 1/2 the episodes on it. That being said, as I write this the asking price was $25.

6680797,5,B00NV6K02S,"It took me the first half of season one to get used to the style of character design but by this final instalment I think I prefered the animated to the live action films.

Having watched and enjoyed The Clone Wars from the start my only misgiving of 'The Lost Missions' was its 13 episodes compared to the 20 plus of previous seasons (and why was it titled the 'Lost Missions'?).

The storylines still contained strong character development and had captivating interest, light sabre duels, still engrossing and exciting, depiction of the various worlds and races still rated a 'Wow' and the space craft and space battles equalled the best that George and Co. delivered in Episodes I, II & III. In fact The Clone Wars has been what Episodes I, II & III should have been! Overall it had everything I had come to expect.

With previous seasons I limited myself to one episode per day so I could make the viewing pleasure last, but with 'The Lost Miisions' I watched them all in one sitting and that's quite a complement coming from a 60 year old, I hope that 'Rebels' proves to be as good.",1427414400,3,1087,4.50761421319797

Only 13 episodes, but they are all really good to great even, except maybe a couple banking episodes and some stuff that tries to paint Jar Jar as a heroic character alongside Mace Windu, a couple of the most weakly-developed characters in my opinion. Definitely darker story lines and some really interesting stuff is explored and revealed, especially in Yoda's later episodes. Has a good 16-minute special on the series but it is mostly sentimental stuff about the crew, nothing too in-depth as I don't think they are ready to look back yet since most of them are now hard at work on Rebels.",1426550400,,906,4.66875

These episodes are ones that didn't quite 'make the cut' to be aired as part of the series - but the interesting part is *why* they didn't make it. While some of them are a little murky or talky, the real reason most of them were left out is that they are more complex, more sophisticated and a bit darker than the general 'feel' Lucasfilm wanted for the series. This makes them a real treat for adult viewers, although perhaps not as enjoyable for younger children.

It's a crime Disney didn't let them finish the second half of the season.
Disney didn't give it quite as many extra as before either, but I'll still give it 5 stars.

So far Rebels just doesn't have the same depth and expansiveness and it feels a bit Saturday morning and Disney in comparison, although it's not bad. But yeah they should have certainly finished off rendering the rest of S6 and what they had already planned for 7.",1425340800,,598,4.477064220183486
6680814,5,B00NV6K02S,"This is sort of Season 6.5 of the Clone Wars, with three completely new story arcs. And these stories are deep - and dark.

Without trying to synopsize the stories I can say that these are indeed thought-provoking and complex, something you'd expect more from Japanese seinen anime as opposed to run-of-the-mill American animation, save maybe the original Avatar series. There is the uncovering of real emotions here, and these emotions do not get an easy resolution after 24 minutes and one commercial break. The Anakin and Padme arc really goes far to inform their relationship in Episode 6 of the movies.

Ultimately Clone Wars is complete. This 13-episode set fills a bit of the void left by the conclusion of the series, but these stories are so deep that they beg for more. I'll be checking out Rebels next. Since it is by very much the same team, I expect good things.

We even get an extra episode that is in the pre- vis stage but otherwise can be watched as a regular episode. It's a very worthy addition to a great series.

Positives:
1. Intelligent and naturalistic dialogue.
2. Nuanced and detailed CGI, rendering, mattes, texture (e.g. sand, snow, fabric).
3. Creative intelligent storytelling.
Negatives:
1. A couple of subplots didn't get adequately resolved as well as the ending seemed to run out of energy compared to most of the episodes.
2. Tech related physics, as in most sci-fi films, is in need of at least a high school physics advisor. Easily forgiven because of the quality of the designs and their animation & movement.",1423180800,,642,5.009345794392523

I actually felt immersed in the prequel era of the saga. I have been down with the Clone Wars from day one. The eye candy, and even the ear candy has been mesmerizing over the years. But the stories have felt repetitive. I promise i am not downing the series. I guarantee when you watch this season, you will see what i see. Of course only if you know your Star Wars. Recently i been going through the whole complete saga  again In the CORRECT order. As i was going through the Clone War series (on blu-ray), i notice an interesting comparison: The regular 5 seasons (plus one CLONE movie) seemed insignificant while watching the thirteen must-own Lost Mission episodes. After watching Attack of the Clones, skip ALL of the Clone Wars EXCEPT the Lost Missions. THIS IS A MUST! The Yoda-arc is probably the deepest and darkest story SINCE THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY. We can all relate to fighting our own demons. And that is basically what he does. I was in awe of this level of brilliance AND SPIRITUALITY from the guys at LucasFilm.

Instead, there's a nice documentary on the making of the entire series, though it's vague on the sixth season. The incomplete Utapau story arc would have also been nice to have as a bonus feature, but I understand why they weren't included.

It always had a difficult mission in some ways.  Telling a story set between two films we already knew how it would end.  Worse the 'heroes' Anakin Skywalker and the clones, were destined to kill off the other heroes.  I always dreaded how the series would end, would it dare to step into that dark territory?  Well we'll never know since Star Wars' new owners killed the program halfway through this season.

So we're left with a lot of loose threads that go nowhere.

It's a shame since they were getting close to the end and clearly setting up things we'd see in Revenge of the Sith and the original series.  But the constraints were also showing.

For example we have a great storyline where the Jedi (finally!) discover the dark secret behind the clone army and... do nothing.  They simply decide they have no choice but to continue to use the clones.  No further investigation, no effort to follow up an earlier story about the chips inside every clone... Nothing.  Because that would ruin the plot of Revenge of the Sith.  So why bring it up?  You see the problem.

Another arc pairs the 'hilarious' Jar-Jar Binks with Mace WIndu.  And again you wonder who, exactly, thought at this late date we wanted to see more Jar-Jar.

The final arc follows Yoda on his quest to learn how to become a Force Ghost.  It's the sort of question no one really asked (he's a Jedi Master, of course he can become a Force Ghost) and is just piles of metaphysical nonsense strung together.  Some things are best left unexplained.

The animation overall is gorgeous.  And certainly makes me wish the series could have continued.  Imagine if they'd gone on, telling Revenge of the Sith from other perspectives, or even going on to the Dark Times afterwards.

Oh well.

  Even though this awesome group is creating Star Wars Rebels, my Star Wars cartoon collecting days are over. I gave Star Wars Rebels a look when Disney was showing the first episode on ABC, and I was very disappointed. The Star Wars Spirit is gone, and it has been replaced with Disney's corny formula. The animation is soft and ""childish"", and I'm not putting kids down, I mean that the animation is playing down to the viewer in particular kids I suspect. The fight scenes are like something out of a silly sitcom. The plot lines have very little depth. I wouldn't wast a dime on Star Wars Rebels. A fine franchise has been hi-jacked and ruined by a gigantic corporation. It's sad but I guess all good things must come to an end.
  Having said all of that, The Clone Wars did nothing but deepen and become more and more interesting every season. The animation truly progressed in the most artful style. The stories are extremely interesting and edgy, and they did an excellent job at balancing that between little kids and adults. There was a moral and a message to every story. Something to be learned or pondered with every episode. In other words it was really Star Wars!! I don't know if Disney will ruin the movies but I think that I'm done collecting Star Wars now that it is no longer George Lucas'. Everything before the Disney take over I will always like, The Clone Wars is awesome!! Lucas' animation crew is awesome!! Disney stinks!!",1419724800,,1572,4.603571428571429

Why? No stupid droid episodes. And for once, even the Padme & Jar-Jar episodes that are included are actually really good episodes. Padme's episodes in seasons 1-5 had tended to be a bit dull - not here. And Jar-Jar's were - well, filled with Jar-Jar. Here he's teamed with Mace Windu - and it works. After season 5 - which had easily the weakest of the series - season 6 was a welcome relief and made me wish the show could have continued.

I will also say that the animation and graphics in season 6 are the best yet - every episode has jaw-dropping effects. Filoni & crew spared nothing in making this look spectacular.",1419292800,2,778,4.433566433566433

6680896,4,B00NV6K02S,"If you watched the first five seasons then this is a no brainer.  The 5th season pushed the show closer to the events of 'Revenge of the Sith' so you knew the series was ending. This season starts with a great story arc involving the clone troopers and a mysterious chip inside all of them. If you have seen the aforementioned movie then this adds additional background on how Darth Sidious was able to turn the clones against the Jedi.  This storyline runs several episodes and it ends with a clone nearly telling Anakin and Obi-Wan some game changing information before suffering from some untimely, but convenient death.
The next story arc, 3 episodes, is centered on how Sidious ultimately obtains control of the banking guild in order to fund creation of the Empire as we see in the original trilogy. Padme and Clovius are the main characters with a jealous Anakin and an always nefarious Count Dooku in the picture. It's an okay story, but feels like it could have been condensed to only 2 episodes and it is very predictable.
Next comes a pair of episodes involving Mace Windu and JarJar which are better than expected if you are not a Binks fan as I am.  Queen Julia of Bardotta calls Binks for help and the Jedi send Windu to assist. Council Members are disappearing on Bardotta and it is threatening their civilization. Jar acts surprisingly competent, is crushed on by the Queen, and manages not to annoy Windu too much.  They end up uncovering cult activity and the Queen gets kidnapped.  After planet hopping an old enemy from a previous season returns. Windu is appropriately awesome as he dispatches the cultists.
Now for the best story of the season which is unfortunately the end of the series...sort of, but more on that in a moment. The scene starts with Master Poo Koon finding the long lost ship of Master Sifo-Dyas. This brings the Jedi closer to unlocking the Sith conspiracy sending Sidious and Dooku into action. Anakin and Obi-Wan head to Felicia to investigate Sifo-Dyas' last known location. More importantly Yoda talks to Chancellor Palpatine and becomes the central character in the final few episodes. Yoda travels to the Sith home world which is perfectly dark, gritty, crumbling, and imperial.  It ends with Yoda learning how to merge with the physical force in order to live on after death which is very revealing and welcome.
That's how it ends. The show was cancelled despite that four more episodes were written, produced, recorded, and partially animated.  Those episodes are included and would recommend watching despite not being fully animated. That story arc involves Anakin and Obi Wan up against Dooku.  While it's never specifically stated, the central object of the story is a giant crystal that is no doubt meant for the Death Star.  It's an entertaining four episodes despite the visual limitations.
It's kind of disappointing that there is so many unanswered questions. There was a number of events alluded to in ""Revenge in the Sith"" or the overall Star Wars cannon that episodes could have been done. But Lucas, having stopped being rationale years ago, sold out completely to Disney. Disney preferring a more kid centric Star Wars cartoon canned Clone Wars in favor of Rebels. The sudden end and the lack of a full seasons worth of episodes are the main reason I can't give this five stars.",1418860800,5,3342,4.818499127399651

Now that the Evil Coalition of Disney/Marvel have their Sith chokehold on all things Star Wars, they decided to white wash all cannon not related to the cinematic universes. So Star Wars officially died in August of 2014 with the last issue Dark Horse Comics Star Wars.

Although Star Wars is dead and this final chapter was done by a Disney crew, it closed up all the loose ends of the series nicely . The Animation stuck with  the style from this series (Unlike that train wreck of a show SW: Rebellion) . It was a bittersweet feeling seeing the last of the true cannon being played out , knowing that Disney/ Marvel have their own Protocol 66 in mind for it.

five seasons, its tentpole arcs thematically eclipsed the prequels

and vastly for the better) only reinforces this. Watching this series
reduces ""Revenge of the Sith"" to a mere expository piece about
Hayden Christensen doing a very poor imitation of ""Anakin"" taking
his lava bath and getting his new wardrobe. Everything else about
Episode 3 feels like a rehash now.

Because of that, I actually feel ""The Wrong Jedi"" was the perfect ending
for the series and so I had some strong misgivings about the announced Bonus Content
(aka ""The Lost Missions"") as I felt it was tacking on an unnecessary
appendage to a story that already had a clear through-line that came
to an amazingly emotional close.

Kind of like the way I feel about Episode 7, really.

And I haven't changed my mind now that I've seen ""The Lost Missions.""
The lost arcs aren't bad, per se, they just feel out of place and anticlimactic.
All of them except one might as well have happened prior to ""The Wrong Jedi"".
Even the Yoda arc feels more like a companion piece to the prequels rather
than a fitting end to ""The Clone Wars."" To be fair, his ending speech
about the Jedi having lost the war by fighting it very nicely sums up
the core themes of the prequels and ""The Clone Wars"". I wouldn't be surprised
if this was a late addition to the arc. But as a finale and a story,
the arc falls flat, lacking tension or suspense or even anything particularly
revelatory.

Many will blame this on Disney cancelling the series. Perhaps that's true.
Certainly, it's no secret that this set of episodes were never designed
to close out the series. Hopefully, the rest of the cancelled Clone Wars
stories will eventually be released in the form of novels and comics so
we can judge fully.

But on its own, ""The Lost Missions"" (and I'm thankful they're calling
it that and not ""Season 6"") comes across as a bittersweet
collection of loose fittings rather than a proper sendoff. The arcs are
overly focused on movie characters whose fates we already know and
with Ahsoka gone, the series lacks a central protagonist, replicating another
well known failing of the prequels. The episodes are also overly focused
on answering questions about the mechanisms of things rather than
on telling stories and exploring core themes and character arcs.
The result is a compilation that feels more like a collection of
animated Wookiepedia articles than a set of Clone Wars arcs.",1416096000,9,2829,4.75152749490835
6680937,5,B00NV6K02S,"Amazing revelations in season 6 but still to me isn't the final say of what happened in the clone wars. It might be b/c i just didn't want the show to ever end. The story telling was stellar and so were the visuals. We got very important stories in this season about order 66 and the yoda arc that tells more about the force. I still don't know why they couldn't have just finished the arcs that were left undone, i'm sure disney has the money and manpower to do so. Its unfortunate but i can't stay bitter forever, there for a while fans thought these stories would never see the light of day, so i'm at least glad and satisfied in that aspect. Its possible that they ended it with the best story of the entire run with the yoda arc, this show in ways still i think sheds more light on the saga than the films. In time i can look  back on this period in the star wars universe and rejoice for the time and energy that was put into making star wars great again.",1416096000,,961,4.111702127659575

Season 1 we started with this nice fresh little show and gradually went a little darker. This 'season,' while not being 'dark' in a traditional sense, is dark nonetheless. We learn some valuable Order 66 secrets, we get more Qui-Gon, we get at least some closure to the series. Even the Utapau arc is good, for just being animatics (basically) with dialogue added. This is as good a closure as we are going to get for such a wonderful series. Buy this, watch this, love this.",1415750400,3,568,4.471153846153846

6680943,5,B00NV6K02S,"Disney and Lucasfilm give fans of a Galaxy far, far away a gift in the release of Star Wars: The Clone Wars  The Lost Missions. I found the end of the fifth season on Cartoon Network to be a satisfying finish. These new episodes, which aired on Netflix, do a wonderful job of giving us even more insight into the events between Episode II and Episode III.

Made to be seen in High-Definition, Star Wars: The Clone Wars  The Lost Missions looks pristine in a Blu-ray format. Its presented in 1080p HD with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Every colorful alien world visited looks pristine and striking in its own right.

The 5.1 Dolby Digital audio delivers the surround sound experience you would expect from a Star Wars feature film. Explosions come from behind and in front of you in a home theater setting. All the planets and life forms our heroes encounter in their journeys have unique qualities which are well presented and enveloped in a dramatic and effective musical score.

Although they may not look like much, Star Wars: The Clone Wars  The Lost Missions has it where it counts when it comes to bonus material. A 16-minute never-before-seen documentary takes us behind the scenes of the entire series. Four unfinished story reels are included as well. Its interesting to see what series runner Dave Filoni would take to George Lucas for approval before fully realizing the different episodes.

There are moments and characters in Star Wars: The Clone Wars  The Lost Missions that will no doubt frighten younger viewers. The Night Sisters and their voices come to mind. The only other thing I can think of is the sci-fi violence, which is mainly made up of lightsaber and laser gun battles.

Star Wars: The Clone Wars  The Lost Missions is 13 episodes of political suspense, sci-fi action, satisfying drama, and lighthearted humor that bring this chapter of George Lucas space saga to a close. We delve back into the darkness found in The Empire Strikes Back and Revenge of the Sith when the Night Sisters make a sinister return. The mood shifts as we meet the most unlikely character in the universe: a powerful spiritual leader who is in love with Jar Jar Binks. Its a must-see conclusion for all fans of the Emmy Award-winning show.",1415318400,30,2237,4.742268041237113
