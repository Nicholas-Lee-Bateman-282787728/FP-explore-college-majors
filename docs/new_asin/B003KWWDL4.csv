4134187,5,B003KWWDL4,"Unlike many J.W. fans, I like his 80s work best of all.  Winter gave up the R&R of the 70s and went back to his roots (and his strong suit) - the blues.  Excellent DVD and highly recommended for all Winter fans and blues fans in general. This guy can play like no other.",1287100800,17,270,3.9814814814814814

4134189,5,B003KWWDL4,"I saw Johnny Winter in Brockville on September 11, 2010 and was lucky enough to purchase this dvd at the show. Johnny played an excellent show but this review is for the dvd so I'll get to that. First this dvd is an excellent companion to Johnny Winter Live through the seventies. I highly recommend both dvd's. Second, Amazon has the wrong running time. The dvd is actually close to 2 hours long not 60 minutes. The dvd starts out with 4 songs from Massey Hall in Toronto from 1983 including Sweet Papa John and It's all over now which is a show stopper for Johnny to this day. Then there are several songs from a festival in Denmark from 1984 including Johnny's great cover of the stones classic Jumping Jack Flash and Dylan's Highway 61 and Chuck Berry's Johnny B Goode. There is an amusing moment at the end of Johnny B Goode but I won't ruin it for you by revealing what happens. There are other live performances from the Capital Theatre in Passaic New Jersey, Bromma Sweden and Pistoia Italy. The great thing about this dvd is getting a chance on many of the songs to see Johnny's fingers up close playing his guitar. He truly is a master and a living legend. There is also a video from Johnny's Guitar Slinger album and a couple of short interviews from that period. I used to think that all music made in the 1980's sucked but Johhny proves that if you stick with a proven formula like playing the blues then the music was / is timeless. If you like the blues or Johnny Winter then don't hesitate to buy this dvd, it's a lot of fun watching Johnny do what he does best. Long live Johnny 'Big Daddy' Winter. I hope I will be lucky enough to see many more Johnny Winter shows in the future. I give this dvd a 5 star rating.",1284422400,40,1730,4.293577981651376

4134191,2,B003KWWDL4,"I was introduced to Johnny Winter's music in the very early 1970's and have been a fan ever since.  I own albums of his that were recorded live, but I have never seen him in concert so I was looking forward to seeing this DVD.  It contains excerpts from several live concerts recorded across the world in the 1980's when Johnny was really in his prime.  The concert video footage is very raw with dismal recording quality.  Even worse, the sound quality is mono and some of the worst fidelity I have heard in any recording on 78, LP, CD, mp3, or DVD.  Granted, live recording was not great in the 80's but it was not this bad.  The video looks like something you would see on a bootleg recording from an old video camera.  Winter was a victim of repeated bootleg recordings, and this certainly makes me suspect this is one of them.  Think of the lowest quality mp3 recording and then try to envision sound just a little worse and you will get the sense of how bad the audio is on this DVD.  It's like something recorded on someone's cellphone, and Winter's guitar sounds like he is playing in a metal barrel.  On the disc I received the last song ends abruptly about midway.  Everything else on the disc is such poor quality that I honestly don't know if I got a defective disc or if the creator of this collection just made it that way.  It is truly pathetic and a sad presentation of recordings from such a brilliant and talented blues guitarist who is one of the best to ever play a guitar.

The song selection on this DVD is very good, and if you can get past the horrid video and sound quality you will see and hear some truly great live guitar playing.  Winter is backed up in these recordings by a very talented bass guitar player who, amazingly, plays a mean harmonica during several songs while simultaneously maintaining a solid bass rhythm.  If you are a hardcore Johnny Winter fan you may enjoy seeing him play live on this disc, but you will have to greatly lower your expectations due to the very poor recording quality.  Personally, I think Johnny Winter deserves a far better concert presentation than this.",1396051200,6,2123,4.447028423772609
4134192,5,B003KWWDL4,"I really liked this album as Johnny Winter is a very accomplished blues guitar player. I have played this album a number of times already and I recommend it to any other blues guitar fan. John puts a lot of energy into his playing.

Highly recommended.",1360022400,,252,4.478260869565218
4134193,2,B003KWWDL4,Was so excited to get Johnny Winters Live through the 80's.  Very disappointed with the quality.  It is a copy and not original.  The video is very poor but the sound is okay.  When you look at the DVD you can tell by the burn lines that it is a copy/fake.  Not blaming the seller necessarily could be the company that produced it.  Don't waste your money on this.,1345852800,3,364,4.202898550724638
4134194,4,B003KWWDL4,This DVD has much better audio and video than the LIVE Through the 70's DVD. It is packed with memorable performances of some of his best house rockin' performances chock full'o great guitar runs.,1318896000,2,196,4.794117647058823
4134195,3,B003KWWDL4,"Although it states it is a DVD, my computer's DVD player can't play it (PowerDVD). I have a BluRay system set up with a player (that supposedly plays everything) which is able to play this. It's not bad but there should be some indication that it's in some special format, hence the low rating.",1304035200,,294,4.462962962962963
4134196,2,B003KWWDL4,"Not as good as I was led to believe by other reviews. It was ok, not
great.  I am a Johnny Winter fan and like some of his video.",1298246400,2,129,3.4482758620689653
4134197,5,B003KWWDL4,"I really enjoyed the ""Live Through the 70's"" dvd, and I like this one even more. It has a total running time of 114 minutes. Again, like the 70's DVD, the 80's DVD is a compilation of performances by Johnny Winter.

The performances are as follows:

Canada '83: 1. Unseen Eye 2. Stanger 3. Sweet Papa John 4. It's All Over Now.

Denmark '84: 5. Jumpin Jack Flash 6. Boot Hill 7. Highway 61 8. Johnny B.Goode

NJ '84: 9. Mad Dog 10. When You've Got a Good Friend

NH '84: 11. Lights Out 12. Please Come Home For Chrismas

Alligator Records Promos '84: 13. Don't Take Advantage of Me (Music Video) This is a great video!!! 14. Don't Take Advantage of Me.

Sweden '87: 15. Swedish TV Intro 16. Sound the Bell 17. Mojo Boogie

Italy '88: 18. Early in the Morning 19. Serious as a Heart Attack

Overall, these are some more great Johnny Winter performances.",1292198400,18,852,4.341772151898734
4134198,5,B003KWWDL4,I saw many performances of Johnny Winter through the 80's. They did a great job of capturing his fire on the guitar. Brought back a lot of memories. I wish they had videos like this of his brother as well.,1290124800,3,205,4.15
4134199,5,B003KWWDL4,"THIS IS IT, finally the DVD I've been waiting for, it reveals the hard rocking Guitar Slinger I remember best from the '80s. ""JOHNNY WINTER Live Through The'80s"" THE BEST guitar player the world has ever seen rockin his heart out LIVE !!! This and the Live through the '70s dvd capture the raw talent and power of the under rated rock/blues legend. I've seen him live many times at small bars in St Louis and also the Illinois State Fair during the '80s. This DVD is a great flashback to those rockin concerts I remember well from back in the day. Buy this DVD it ROCKS and does him PROUD !!!",1287964800,3,592,4.294642857142857
8399032,5,B003KWWDL4,.I saw Johnny several times in the 80's so this captures the sounds and spirit of those shows. Even more beneficial for those of you that did not see Johnny in the 80's. Good companion to Live through the 70's. Get that one too.,1501113600,,228,4.204545454545454

8399039,4,B003KWWDL4,Pretty good selection of concert performances. Was a little disappointed when Johnny walked offstage in the middle of one number but I can't blame him for doing so. That particular audience started throwing things onstage and almost hit him so he walked off. And he had been playing great but he just didn't want to put up with that rude behavior from the audience..,1423612800,2,366,4.734375
