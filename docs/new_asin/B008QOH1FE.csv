8529619,1,B008QOH1FE,"Movie is fuzzy, unclear picture.  This movie has plenty of violence, lots of the women shooting guns.  Low amount of female nudity. You'll see more nudity in a movie rated G, than in this movie.  If you want to see a movie with girls shooting guns, with a horrible plot, this movie is for you. After watching, I threw it in the garbage.",1517616000,,336,4.301587301587301
8529620,2,B008QOH1FE,"As I recall, not one of the better women's prison films. Saw it few weeks ago, and can't remember it.",1427241600,,101,4.1
8529621,3,B008QOH1FE,"I sat down with this hoping for a couple of hours unredeemed sleaze C/W gratuitous sex and violence and was badly disappointed.

The movie's start is so badly washed-out color-wise that I could not make out who was talking in the through-the-caf-window shot, and continued to be so through the credit sequence.

During this there was much banal dialogue that promised little entertainment to come, though I held out some small hope that the color saturation would improve in time for the nudity (entirely justified by the script). Secretly I feared that these crucial scenes would be an audio-only experience.

But then things took a turn for the better when the picture locked up and the DVD and the movie refused to play at all.

I managed to reboot the player and restart the disc but the same thing happened, then the player refused to boot at all, so I unplugged about fifty wires, pulled out the player from the rack, removed the case and poked the manual release gubbins with a small screwdriver, enabling me to open the drawer by hand and remove the disc.

After that I returned the movie for a refund, and my raincoat to the closet.

What I saw of Escape from Women's Prison was three stars horrible, but it showed great promise of going two-stars on me. I shall never know for sure.

Things to know:

There was no visible physical damage to the disc, nor any visible discontinuity in the recording layer.
I played other discs in that player before and after the attempted sleazopalloza with no trouble.",1400457600,,1512,4.679245283018868
8529622,3,B008QOH1FE,"This Italian made exploitation vehicle offers a new twist on the WIP genre by presenting a ""Women Outside of Prison"" plot! There are no scenes of women actually IN prison in this film - the action starts right off as 4 female prisoners just run out the front door of the prison and hop into a waiting car driven by one of the fem convicts brother. He is wounded as they make their getaway and their car collides with a bus full of high school girls heading off to a tennis tournament.  The frantic escapees commandeer the bus, and its' occupants, and they all end up taking refuge in a big house that, ironically, belongs to a judge.  The bulk of the film's plot then focuses on the  tense interactions between the desperate 'captors' and their 'hostages'.  There's lots of 'threats' and escape attempts, and, of course, hetero & lesbo sex scenes between the sex deprived convicts & their captives - until the police move in and it all ends rather abruptly!

This is a marginally engaging little flik but its' presentation/enjoyment is (sadly) flawed by the poor quality of the source transfer material - likely from an old VHS video source to DVD.  The (full-screen) image is pretty fuzzy and the colors muted throughout - there are numerous jumpy cuts within the content - often during a sex scene - that makes the film feel like it's been butchered pretty good.  None of the characters are very engaging so it's hard to feel much empathy for anyone as the plot lurches onward. There are some fairly attractive actresses featured and a bit of full female nudity but the degraded quality of the image and choppy editing makes it difficult to fully appreciate.  In the final analysis I'd say that the actual film didn't 'live up to' the 'promise' presented by the wonderfully lurid box cover art and write-up.  Worth a look - but more of a renter than a keeper.",1386028800,2,1861,4.598187311178248

8529624,4,B008QOH1FE,"Cool movie, really rare. I would never  imagine this getting a dvd release. The picture isn't  remastered but that's expected with a movie like this.",1366761600,5,149,4.92
