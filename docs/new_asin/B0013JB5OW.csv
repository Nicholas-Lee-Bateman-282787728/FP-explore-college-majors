8251206,1,B0013JB5OW,"""Of The Living Dead"" is not a movie. Movies usually have scripts. There is usually some attempt at creating some type of narrative within the film. Watching this... uh, production, reminded me of the sort of stuff that I would do when I was about eleven or twelve and first had access to a camcorder. Me and a bunch of my friends would gather around in someone's backyard or basement and kind of improv our way through a bunch of comedy pieces as one of our friends taped us, trying unsuccessfully not to laugh as he poorly mishandled the camera. We'd make most of the material up as we went along and when we had what seemed to be enough footage, we'd hook the camera up to the old VCR, throw in a VHS tape and manually edit it all together. We would occasionally show the end results to our parents or any kids in the neighborhood who weren't actually involved in the making of our ""movie"" and they'd do their best to sit through about an hour of bad comedy that mostly consisted of screaming and telling jokes that they, as the audience, either didn't understand or couldn't hear.

It's almost twenty years later and kids aren't editing on VHS tape decks anymore. Camcorders are easily affordable and editing equipment for your home PC is also cheap.  This makes it possible for just about anyone with any interest at all to be able to film, edit, and create their very own movies. The combination of video-share networks like YouTube as well as the ability to create DVD's from home will surely mean that releasing home-made masterpieces to the masses will be easier than ever. This will unfortunately mean that stuff like ""Of The Living Dead"" will more than likely flood the market. In many ways, this ""movie"" reminds me of the stuff I made when I first starting playing around with a camcorder with a few big exceptions. The first being that the principles involved are about fifteen to twenty years older than I was and the second being that I made the wise choice of letting my early cinematic missteps collect dust in my basement rather than seeking out distribution for them.

""Living Dead"" is the apparent brain child of Albert and Hugh Cochran (presumably brothers). According to the credits, they did all the writing, producing, editing, directing, cinematography, etc., which would be impressive if they did any of it with even the slightest level of competence or effort. The writing mostly consists of the actors more or less narrating their own scenes to the camera as they drop ""F""-bombs left and right. The story itself has absolutely no structure to it at all. It's a bunch of poorly-conceived comedy sketches stretched out to maximum length. We get to hear the same joke referencing ""28 Days Later"" and ""Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things"" about six or seven times in the first twenty minutes of the movie. And probably a handful more before all is said and done. Worse yet is the obnoxious sance call by a chubby guy in a bad costume that keeps talking about ""sons of b--ches"" and an equally-irritating rock number about ""zombies"" and ""B-rated movies"" by a fat zombie. I'm pretty sure they are both played by the same actor. While we're on the subject, I would love to know in what remedial Junior High film class this movie would qualify as ""B-rated"".

The central plot here seems to involve two friends who, after watching a bunch of straight-to-DVD zombie flicks, are shocked to discover that the dead have actually risen to life and are attacking their home. There really aren't any clear-cut rules to how the zombies operate or even where they came from. Some run, some talk, some tell really unfunny jokes, and a few can even read. The main characters are played by Albert and Hugh Cochran and it should be also noted that Albert pops up at least a few other times as different characters without altering his appearance or even the cadence in which he talks. We're supposed to know that he's not the same character because he's wearing either a different color sweatshirt or a bandana on his head. There's all kinds of random stuff going on involving sances, guys on stilts with awful fake accents, ninjas, and a guitar-playing zombie who sings like a bunch of kids trying to annoy their parents on a long road trip. Apparently, this stuff is supposed to invoke laughter. Nearly everything that happens in this overlong home movie is done to deliver a gag and then quickly forgotten about. It plays like a bunch of high school public access sketches stretched out to make a feature-length presentation with no consistency in its storytelling at all.

The technical work is even more embarrassing. For some reason, instead of traditional editing, the Brothers Cochran decided they would use some weird video flip-frame gimmick to transition between cuts making the whole picture seem like an 80's infomercial. The editing itself is very sloppy. There's no background track used so the audio jumps from no noise to hissing quite frequently. Whatever shots aren't destroyed by the eccentric editing are put of their misery by the lazy camera work. A common sense rule of filmmaking is if you can actually hear the bulk of the camera operator's work on the soundtrack then he's probably doing a lousy job. There's plenty of that in this presentation --- heavy-breathing, laughter, less-than-subtle camera movements. All of which are often more audible than the actor's dialogue. There's even a few scenes where we get to hear the camera operator comment on the scene when it's over. Generally, I'd blame this sort of thing on the editor but I'm pretty sure that they're the same person.

""Of The Living Dead"" actually received some pretty favorable reviews on Amazon. I'm assuming that it's either from friends and family of people who worked on the film or the filmmakers themselves with different accounts. I guess from a subjective perspective, one might find some entertainment value here but I really can't see how. This is not an indictment of low-budget movies at all. Clearly this film was made for practically no money but it was also made with no practical idea of how to structure a story, set up a joke, frame a shot, or edit a scene. It's a ninety-five minute movie that wears its premise thin before the ten-minute mark. The DVD packaging for this opus warns about ""excessive adult language"" that may offend some viewers but makes no mention of the much more disturbing issue of offensive filmmaking.",1256342400,2,6445,4.7602862254025045

8251208,5,B0013JB5OW,"Well as I stated in one of my post, hopefully they wouldn't let me down. I have never seen a zombie movie anything like this, It was hilarious and filled with creativity, I mean, the duct tape zombie, a super hero zombie, a zombie on stilts. I really didn't understand the purpose of the ninja, but i guess it was just something else stupid to add to the movie.

There is a lot of swearing in this movie, but that actually made it funny, because think about it, if you were surrounded by zombies would you watch your tongue. The seance' guy had me laughing so hard, this dude, one minute is summoning the dead, then he is running from the dead, then he is talking to the dead. The scene with the children was actually very cool and then they beat up the duct tape zombie. The picture was kinda weak, but you haver understand the people making the film did the best they could with apparently almost no budget. I thought it was damn good for a movie with that low of a budget, it was apparently just funny ideas all put in one film, I really hope there is a sequel and perhaps a trilogy, I would like to see what these guys can come up with. I just hope my bladder can handle it. Looking forward to the next chapter your fan raphael.",1206316800,,1232,4.198312236286919
