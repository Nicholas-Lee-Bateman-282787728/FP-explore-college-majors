8676770,5,B00NAIKTHS,"I was lucky enough to catch an early screening of FLOWERS ON A MUUMUU, John Murphy's masterful parody of 1940's Film Noir. I have always been a fan of locally produced independant film, especially when those films are made with the wit and flair seen in this 31 minute little gem. Shot on location in beautifully run-down sections of Fort Worth, Texas and with a cast of very talented local theatre and television personalities, FLOWERS ON A MUUMUU has the gritty Black & White feel of those hard-boiled detective movies we all love. Murphy shows a deft touch with the material ( from his own original screenplay ) playing for laughs without losing the tone of dread that makes a good mystery work. He is aided immeasurably by Mark Evan Walker's spot on art direction, Jarrod Jay's inventive camerawork, and Barbara O'Donohue's detailed costumes. Intimate period details and the subtle ( and sometimes not so subtle ) use of light and shadow give the film that old classic look on an indie budget. I love Preston Dunlap's original jazz score which hits just the right notes of intrigue and whimsy when needed. Telling too much of the plot would be a spoiler. Let's just say that FLOWERS ON A MUUMUU starts out in conventional gumshoe formula: Down on his luck Private Eye meets Beautiful but Mysterious Woman who hires him for a seemingly routine case. What follows is anything but routine, what with seedy glass eye peddlers, Kooky fortune tellers, bumbling gangsters, nutty Nazis...and Oh Yes...That PIG that steals everything! You'll laugh till you cry, which is always a good sign in a comedy. Starring Dallas actor Lynn Mathis ( Wishbone, The Newton Boys, The Life of David Gale )as the detective Maurice Pomerance. Everyone should see this! And if you collect Film Noir from Sam Spade to Phillip Marlow you could do worse than adding a copy of FLOWERS ON A MUUMUU to your DVD library. I have my copy there, right next to Farewell My Lovely!",1410220800,,1946,4.760355029585799
