533995,5,6302980984,"This video is one of the best Muppet films EVER!  It's cheesy, but hey, it's still great!  This is Robin the Frog's best performance, as he upstages Kermit flippers down.
My brother and I had this movie since we were kids and we still watch it from time to time (we're now 25 and 27 years old).  Yeah, I know, it's pathetic that adults watch this... but hey, it's the Muppets!
If you love the Muppet movies, this is a must own to give to your children so that you can enjoy it right along with them!  Your adult friends will make fun of you, but it's worth it!",1039564800,5,560,4.110091743119266
533996,3,6302980984,"Well, this certainly is not the sort of movie I normally watch. But even Charles Dickens enjoyed the story of ""Little Red Riding Hood"" in younger days. The story may be simple, and many of the characters are quite flat. But there are elements that make this video worthy of an hour. The songs are memorable, and the scenry is well done. Kermit is interesting as the narrator who is usually isolated from the events in the story, but does occasionally get caught in the action. (Not unlike some of Shakespeare's characters. Ex Apemantus from ""Timon of Athens."") He even offers some clever comedy. One memorable moment is when Robin is afraid of being a frog forever, and Kermit asks: ""And just what is wrong with being a frog?"" Sweetums may not be very intelligent, but even in his villainous role he entertains us. But it is really Taminella who steals the show! I am not sure even Henson realized the captivating qualities of this character. Taminella is quite similar to some of Charles Dickens' villains. Quilp from Dickens' ""Old Curiosity Shop"" is a cruel and merciless villain. BUT, he carries real charm; he has a comeback  line for anything; and for the most part he is calm and cool in a crisis; and you may actually find yourself cheering for him! Taminella could have been related to Quilp! She is very cruel and evil. BUT, she is always so charming! She is calm under most situations and even turns dangerous situations to her advantage. (Ex. She is confronted by the king, and after a moment of fear convinces him that she is his long lost sister!) She always puts her ambition in charming words: ""There's been a slight change of plans....No you don't get to be the queen. I do....It's a great sacrifice. But I'll try to be brave."" Even when the princess insults her in front of her father (who can't understand her) Taminella handles it by saying compliments make her blush. If you read my review on Dickens' ""Old Curiosity Shop,"" you will recall that my biggest complaint was that Quilp made all the good characters dull and flat. Well, this is my biggest complaint about this movie. Taminella is so fascinating that the good guys (and girl) are so dull and flat. Today I still feel upset when good prevails in this movie. I still say Taminella would have been the greater queen to have around! So while this is a simple story it actually does carry some of the superb elements of William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens. (Let's just work on putting some life into the good characters!)",982454400,4,2500,4.643340857787811
533997,5,6302980984,My children were enchanted with this story (we had a 33 1/3 rpm album) over 25 years ago. We still talk about the characters with joy. My daughter is anxious to obtain a copy for her twin daughters. We're hoping there will  be a re-issue.,953424000,2,238,4.288888888888889

534057,5,6302980984,I saw this movie over 20 years ago and loved it then.  I recently purchased it for my 2 year old grandson.  He loves kermit (Elmo isn't the end all be all to him).  The story is so cute and the music is great.  He loves the frog song and laughs incessantly.  Only wish they had it in DVD.,1315526400,,288,3.8135593220338984

534060,4,6302980984,Great to share this old favourite with the family who loved it as much as I did as  a kid. Been looking out for it on DVD for years but gave up looking and bought this video version. Sound and pictures goo but colour was really disappointing. Sir Robin looked pale green even when he wasn't a frog..and all the colours were washed out.,1302912000,2,335,4.234375
534061,5,6302980984,"Our daughter grew up watching this video until the tape wouldn't play anymore. She has always remembered the movie, even reciting from it through the years. I found it on Amazon and decided to get it for her for Christmas, and I know she is going to be thrilled when she opens her gift...and she's now 26! I just wish the movie was offered in DVD form. Good thing we've kept our VCR handy.",1291593600,3,389,4.27027027027027

Played this VHS a couple days ago; and, my daughter (now 30 and a mother herself), my wife, and I happily sang along opening credits to closing...",1275091200,2,399,4.714285714285714

534135,5,6302980984,"This is a lovely movie which I remember fondly from childhood. Once you've seen a story told by the muppets (Frog Prince, Christmas Carol etc) you are ruined for all other versions. I can only hope the powers that be see fit to release this gem on DVD so that old fans can re-live their childhoods and new fans can become enchanted.",1220227200,,332,4.370967741935484

534138,5,6302980984,"I first came to know this broadcast from the long-playing record that was marketed.  The bi-fold record jacket told the story using a story-board sequence of stills from the original broadcast, and where necessary, Kermit narrated.  My sister and I played this album over and over and over....  We both memorized it, and today many of the phrases are ""you had to be there"" jokes between us.  The album wore out and was lost in the shuffle of growing up and going to school.... I finally tracked down a good-condition used VHS release of the broadcast, which I play only rarely because I'm afraid of damaging the tape.

I really do hope this is re-released on DVD.  The story and the songs and the muppets are incredibly memorable.  I wouldn't mind seeing a recasting to update it - if everything were staged the exact same way.",1141776000,6,827,4.623287671232877
534139,5,6302980984,"My mother recorded this film on television when I was very young, I have watched it for years. I know every song and even the jokes the king tries to tell. I even bought the record to listen to the songs. I would love it if this film was put on DVD and if they made a soundtrack for it.",1126483200,4,286,3.783333333333333
534140,5,6302980984,"This is the best Muppets film/TV special ever!  The story is lovely and Robin shines.  The music is wonderful (apart from the Prince's song at the end (shudder)) and kids of all ages adore it (I'm 32!).

I live in New Zealand and have been hunting for a copy for 20 years, since my sister was born, and have finally found it here on Amazon.  Just in time, as I have a little girl of my own now and I'm sure she will love it as much as I do.

I will be getting a copy ASAP but please, please release this on DVD as it is truely lovely and I think I will wear out the video!",1117238400,9,572,3.8135593220338984
534141,4,6302980984,"My mom saw this as a TV special in 1971 and liked it so much she named me Melora, after the princess who kisses the frog! According to her it was the 1st Jim Henson/Muppet TV special, though I'm not positive she's right... Either way, it's a family classic, and one of the better in the Muppet ouevre. They need to bring it out on DVD pronto!",1111536000,,342,4.119402985074627

7834290,5,6302980984,"I was just four years old when this special first aired on television in 1971.  ""Sesame Street"" was still a new phenomenon in those days, and so were Jim Henson's Muppets.  This was one of Henson's first independent productions and, in my opinion, it's still one of his best.  Kermit the Frog narrates the story as an observer.  It depicts him living in a well near an old castle, and he meets a small frog named Robin (yes, it's the same frog who later played Kermit's nephew).  Robin claims his real name is Sir Robin the Brave, and that he's actually a handsome prince.  He tells of a witch who cast a spell on him, and the only way he can break the spell is if a princess befriends and kisses him.  Kermit and the other frogs are skepitical, of course, but Kermit befriends Robin anyway and welcomes him to the well.

Robin soon learns that a princess lives in the nearby castle, he is determined to meet her.  However, he soon learns that the witch who turned him into a frog is also living in the castle - as the king's sister, no less - and has put a spell on the princess.  The witch recognizes Robin, and is determined to feed him to an ogre (this was also the first appearance of another well-known character from ""The Muppet Show"": the lovable Sweetums).  Will Robin be fed to the ogre before he's kissed by the princess?  Will the princess also be released from her spell?  And how did a wicked witch come to live in the palace?  Watch the movie and find out!

The puppetry is somewhat crude in comparison to Jim Henson's later projects, but it still contains all the elements of a good Muppet production: an exciting story line, funny dialogue, and catchy songs.  I recommend it for people of all ages.",1510876800,,1715,4.396825396825397

7834294,5,6302980984,"This is a classic.  Jim Henson and the Muppets were just gaining popularity on daytime TV with Sesame Street, but Kermit was all on his own back then....",1383868800,,153,4.464285714285714
7834295,5,6302980984,"It's video is totally a delight from start to finish.  It has everything music, comedy, fantasy, frogs! It's introduced by and stars  my favorite Muppet, Kermit and the adorable Robin, who's the Frog Prince of the title.  As the familiar story unfolds, little Robin hops in near the well where Kermit and the other frogs are hanging out and introduce himself as Sir Robin the Brave. He then explains he
isn't really a frog at all , but a Human Prince under a spell by a wicked witch, when tells how it happened in the Song ""They call me, Sir Robin the Brave."" The other frogs make fun of him, but Kermit defends him, Kermit doesn't believe Robin's fantastic tale but
he doesn't want to see the little guy picked on,  One of many good lessons of the story; picking on/making fun of someone is
wrong and you should always stand up and put a stop it. Another is the littlest one (Robin)  is the hero of the story in spite of his size, indeed he uses it to great advantage.  I highly recommend it as a good family movie, or for fans of the Muppets, and or
fairy tales",1370649600,,1063,4.29
