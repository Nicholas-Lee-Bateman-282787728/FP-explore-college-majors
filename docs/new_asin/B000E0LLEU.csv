8103584,4,B000E0LLEU,"Man, there are some tough reviews up for this DVD. Whatever disappointments these viewers had, I have to say that this is definitely better than one star. OK, I admit what they say: the fights are all available on UFC DVDs, and this will probably be aired for free on Spike TV (if it hasn't been already). To answer the first point, people who don't own many UFC DVDs or are more casual fans will still enjoy this very much. I even have quite a few MMA DVDs, but sometimes I don't feel like watching whole matches, I want them to get right to it, especially if there are a lot of people watching together and having a drink or two! To the second point, I don't mind that it's been or will be aired for free - the disc isn't very expensive and I'd rather be able to watch it when I want. And in the end, there are quite a few entertaining knockouts to feast your eyes on. Not the calibre of Pride's ""Hardcore Knockouts Volume 1"", mind you (check that out if you're interested in this type of thing), but still good. So four stars... well maybe three and a half, but I'll round up to balance out some of the other reviews.",1187740800,,1120,4.189814814814815
8103585,5,B000E0LLEU,"Love the UFC!  I really like watching these guys just brawling and swinging for the fences.  Gotta love the knock out.  Nothing says, ""What's UP!"" like a skull shaking blow to the head!  Put it on next time you have a party and watch the crowd form around your TV.  Some of these shots make you cringe and jump up and down.  Enjoy!",1172188800,,331,4.174603174603175
8103586,1,B000E0LLEU,"I got this DVD very excited about seeing some great knockouts but when I watched it all it is a glorified UFC DVD of some crappy fights...  You can see all these on Spike TV instead of paying for it.. UFC has really sold out releasing these types of DVDs just to make a buck, they just don't seem to care about entertainment anymore....  Be careful with this one",1166486400,4,362,4.231884057971015
8103587,1,B000E0LLEU,"I just picked this up at the store for $10 and I thought it was a great deal....but that was until I got home and looked at the listing of fights. I own every UFC dvd that is currently available, just picked up UFC 58 along with this dvd, and I was hoping this dvd would contain alot of the prelim fights that haven't been shown on Unleashed or on UFC on Demand. Instead, it's the greatest KO's from UFC 47 - TUF Finale 1. Here's the list of fights:

- Mike Kyle vs. Wes Sims (UFC 47)

- Nick Diaz vs. Robbie Lawler (UFC 47)

- Andre Arlovski vs. Cabbage (UFC 47)

- Chuck Liddell vs. Tito Ortiz (UFC 47)

- GSP vs. Jay Heiron (UFC 48)

- Frank Trigg vs. Dennis Hallman (UFC 48)

- Yves Edwards vs. Josh Thomson (UFC 49)

- Justin Eilers vs. Mike Kyle (UFC 49)

- David Terrell vs. Matt Lindland (UFC 49)

- Chuck Liddell vs. Vernon White (UFC 49)

- Joe Riggs vs. Joe Doerksen (UFC 49)

- Travis Lutter vs. Marvin Eastman (UFC 50)

- Frank Trigg vs. Renato Verissimo (UFC 50)

- Nick Diaz vs. Drew Fickett (UFC 51)

- Mike Kyle vs. James Irvin (UFC 51)

- Paul Buentello vs. Justin Eilers (UFC 51)

- Evan Tanner vs. David Terrell (UFC 51)

- Alex Karalexis vs. Josh Rafferty (TUF 1 Finale)

- Mike Swick vs. Alex Shoenauer (TUF 1 Finale)

- Nate Quarry vs. Lodune Sincaid (TUF 1 Finale)

- Josh Koscheck vs. Chris Sanford (TUF 1 Finale)

- Chris Leben vs. Jason Thacker (TUF 1 Finale)

If I didn't own UFC's 39 - 58 and TUF season 1 on dvd, I wouldn't mind. But I ended up getting highlights of all the dvd's I currently own. The dvd is only 75 minutes long as well, so it'll be best to just wait for this to come on Spike TV the same way they aired Ultimate Knockouts 3, which was a disappointment as well.

They could've at least had:

- Mike Swick vs. Gideon Ray (Ultimate Fight Night 1)

- Brandon Vera vs. Fabiano Scherner (Ultimate Fight Night 2)

- Jon Fitch vs. Thiago Alves (Ultimate Fight Night 5)

- Thiago Alves vs. Derrick Noble (UFC 59)

- Spencer Fisher vs. Aaron Riley (Ultimate Fight Night 3)

- Spencer Fisher vs. Matt Wiman (UFC 60)

Some of these fights have been shown on Unleashed, but are more rare than the ""already available"" fights that they have on Ultimate Knockouts 4

If you don't have any of the UFC dvd's, then yeah, get it if you like KO's. If you have the said dvd's, stay away at all cost",1166313600,9,2325,4.097777777777778
