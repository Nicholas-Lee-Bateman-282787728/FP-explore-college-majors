6577081,5,B00MGBS5PS,"There were four Addie Mills specials made for CBS TV in the mid-1970s. This collects the first two, and the best two stories of the tetralogy.

THE HOUSE WITHOUT A CHRISTMAS TREE is the first story about Addie Mills, a spirited (and slightly bossy) 10-year-old who loves school and dreams of growing up to be an artist. Her mother died when she was a few months old, and she has been raised by her loving, slightly offbeat grandmother, and her taciturn, brooding father, who doesn't seem to have much love to give to his only daughter. He forbids a Christmas tree in the house during the holidays, and Addie, who desperately wants one, thinks it's because he's so ""parsimonious"" (that's one of her school vocabulary words). When she wins a tree, she will withstand an explosion of emotion that will shake her to her core.

THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE BEST CHRISTMAS STORIES EVER. Addie isn't the usual cute little girl character so nauseatingly passed on by every sitcom and drama of the day: she's bright, not girly, determined, but of course has her faults. Lisa Lucas plays her to a T. Mildred Natwick glows as the supportive grandmother and a great supporting cast is included, but the star of this film is Jason Robards, who provides a stunning performance as the embittered father James Mills. He could have been a soulless bastard but instead Robards permits you see this man's internal pain even as you are startled at his bitterness and anger. The late 1940s atmosphere of the story is well done--the kids even say the Pledge to the Flag correctly--and it was filmed in rural Canada to try to come as close to the setting (rural Nebraska) as possible.

THE THANKSGIVING TREASURE is a little more routine. While out getting air for her bike tires, Addie meets for the first time ""Old Man"" Rhenquist, a crotchety elderly man who is feuding with her dad over non-payment for James Mills' digging a pond for him. A curious Addie, under cover of cutting cattails and fall plants with her best friend, discovers Rhenquist has a horse, the one thing Addie has always wanted. She persuades her best friend Carla Mae to bring the old codger some Thanksgiving dinner after hearing her teacher lecture about the Pilgrims' first Thanksgiving feast, hoping to make friends (and of course get near the horse!).  However, it's Rhenquist Addie comes to treasure; he's becomes like a grandfather to her, telling her tales about ""the old days."" The whole plot could have been terribly clich&eacute;, but Bernard Hughes as Rhenquist and Lisa Lucas as Addie rise above the clich&eacute; and make it worth watching. Again, Canadian landscape standing in for Nebraska countryside makes this look very authentic and the kids even do a radio play to cement the story in the late 1940s. Once again, the story is filmed on videotape, giving it that ""soap opera"" effect, but at the same time it gives it an immediacy as if you are really standing on the sidelines watching these folks.

A super addition to anyone's holiday film library.",1506470400,3,3015,4.768199233716475
6577082,5,B00MGBS5PS,"""The House Without A Christmas Tree"" was one of my favorite holiday movies growing up.  I'm thrilled to have it on DVD.

6577179,2,B00MGBS5PS,"The only thing I can say about these movies is, they are clean and teach some family values.  I guess if you're into watching this nerdy little girl (I understand there are a series of movies with her as a star), then maybe you'd enjoy these more than I did.  And honestly, I haven't watched much that Jason Robards stars in that I was overjoyed with.  He's not my favorite actor, I guess.  In these movies he really never shows any genuinely touching emotion or love for his daughter; I can't imagine a dad who lost his wife being that cold to the one reminder of that relationship!

And oh, I'm really sorry for all those who are cult followers of this series and of Jason Robards who find this review ""unhelpful.""  I wrote it for the rest of the world who might want to know if they would like to purchase the movie.",1421280000,,819,4.285714285714286

Needless to say the quality diminished through every format so what a treat to see them again better then they looked when new. The reason I copied these shows so often was because this is one of my family's favorite holiday films.  If you are looking for a laugh read the one star review complaining that Addie is too ""sassy"" .  This is a woman from the era when we they wanted their daughters to be submissive.  Those submissive daughters took a lot of flack from the men in their lives.  We now want our daughters to be like Addie  ""sassy"" and persistent standing up for their own beliefs.  And if she actually watched the shows she would have seen that Addie was right to befriend a cranky old man or to repair the rift in her fathers life.  Mildred Natwick , Jason Robards , and Bernard Hues were all well seasoned stage actors who were able to elevate these above the level of production.

6577211,5,B00MGBS5PS,"First of all to begin, I'm limiting my review to ""The Thanksgiving Treasure"" only, since I had already posted my review of ""The House Without a Christmas Tree"" on November 25, 2011.  This was the second in a series of four specials about Addie Mills, the other two being ""The Easter Promise"" and finally ""Addie and the King of Hearts"", a Valentine's Day special.  It premiered on the CBS Television Network on Sunday November 18, 1973.

The story takes place in November 1947, the next year after ""The House Without a Christmas Tree"". Although the relationship between Addie Mills (Lisa Lucas) and her reserved father James Mills (Jason Robards) has improved since the previous Christmas, they still need the steadying influence of his wise, loving mother (Mildred Natwick) to smooth the troubled waters.  Addie and her best friend Carla Mae ride their bicycles out past their town of Clear River Nebraska in search of cattails to make fall bouquets.  They wander onto the dilapidated farm of the old widower Walter Rehnquist (Barnard Hughes), a crotchety recluse who lives alone.  There is bad blood between Mr. Rehnquist and Addie's father, James had dug a pond on Rehnquist's farm, and he refused to pay James since the pond leaked, even though James had warned Rehnquist it was a bad spot to place it.  Addie is lured by a pinto horse in his barn; she loves Roy Rogers movies and horses.  She's concerned that the horse although friendly and gentle needs grooming and exercise.  However Mr. Rehnquist discovers the girls on his property and chase them off threatening them with a shotgun.  Even so, Addie can't get his horse out of his mind, and finally comes up with a plan to strike up a friendship with Mr. Rehnquist, Carla Mae and she will deliver him a Thanksgiving dinner, but they will have to do it with letting Addie's father know.  Although Addie's initial motive is to get to ride Mr. Rehnquist's horse, over the next several weeks an unlikely friendship blossoms between the old man and the young girl.

As in the prior outing, the performances are outstanding, beginning with Lisa Lucas in the pivotal role of Addie.  She is spunky and feisty as before but has an underlying sensitivity at times.  Her character as I'd mentioned in my earlier review is a marvelous role model for young girls, bright, independent, forthright, her own person who has a firmly fixed goal to be an artist and live in a city, and you learn that she does achieve her objective.  The craggy laconic Jason Robards as James now sports a bushy mustache that hides the scars from a nearly fatal automobile accident, but his talent fortunately was undamaged.  The cozy, kindly Mildred Natwick is so perfectly cast and believable as Grandma Mills that it's ironic that the lady never married.  Finally kudos extended to Barnard Hughes as the cantankerous Mr. Rehnquist who mellows in the warmth of his friendship with Addie.

At the price of $10.99 for both of these specials, you're getting a real bargain, snap one up for a Christmas present  for a special someone on your list, and buy one for yourself while you're at it.",1417996800,3,3113,4.785046728971962

8672096,5,B00MGBS5PS,"Both of these specials came on TV when I was little, and I highly recommend them.  ""The House Without a Christmas Tree"" was the first in the series, and it's set in 1946.  Addie Mills is a strong-willed ten-year-old girl who lives in the small town of Clear River, Nebraska.  She wants a Christmas tree, but her father insists they're a waste of money.  As the story progresses, though, one can tell that her father's dislike of Christmas trees goes much deeper than the expense.  Things come to a head when Addie wins a Christmas tree in a school contest.  Though it didn't cost her father a cent, he blows a gasket when he sees it.  What does Addie's father have against Christmas trees?  Will she be allowed to keep this one?  If I told you that, I'd give the story away!  Suffice it to say that Addie eventually learns that her father isn't such a bad guy, after all.

""The Thanksgiving Treasure"" is set in the following year.  Addie has become more understanding toward her father, and no longer takes him personally.  During a routine errand, her father encounters Walter Rehnquist, a local resident against whom he holds a long-standing grudge.  As Thanksgiving approaches, Addie's teacher talks about the importance of making peace with one's enemies, so she gets the radical idea of inviting Mr. Rehnquist to Thanksgiving dinner.  Naturally her father won't hear of it, so Addie takes matters into her own hands.  Mr. Rehnquist doesn't like Addie at first, but she reminds him of a strong-willed girl he knew in his boyhood, and he grows quite fond of her.  Addie also develops a fondness for Mr. Rehnquist and his mare, Treasure.  Though Addie's father never actually gets past his dislike of Mr. Rehnquist, he does learn some important things about his daughter.

What I like best is the way Addie's relationship with her father evolved throughout the series.  In ""The House Without a Christmas Tree"", Addie is somewhat intimidated by her father and wonders if he really loves her.  In ""The Thanksgiving Treasure"", she realizes her father does love her in his own way, and she no longer takes his gruffness personally.  By the next film in the series, ""The Easter Promise"", Addie can read her father like a book, and she knows that underneath his grumpy exterior lurks a heart of pure gold.",1519862400,,2301,4.7430730478589425
