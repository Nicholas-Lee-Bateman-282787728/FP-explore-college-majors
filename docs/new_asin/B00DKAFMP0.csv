The story of an aspiring French-pastry baker who stumbles into a job with a long-established, artisanal maker of traditional Japanese sweets called ""wagashi"" takes place almost entirely in the Asakusa district of contemporary (2008) Tokyo. The title character's name, Ando Natsu happens to be a pun on ""an donuts,"" a sweet bean (an) -filled doughnut popular in Japan. The part time job evolves into a full apprenticeship as Natsu discovers the wonders of wagashi and the caring people of the village-like community of Asakusa, famous for its historic Sensouji Temple and the echoes of Edo-period traditions still held dear by the inhabitants.

As well as an exploration of the hard work and craftsmanship involved in producing the edible works of art that are wagashi, other aspects of Japanese culture come into focus. The sweets poetically evoke the passing seasons and are essential to the enjoyment of green tea; wagashi are essential in a formal tea ceremony. Other shops in the area, from cafes, bookstores and a traditional eel restaurant with its demanding chef and his rebellious apprentice are featured. The surviving geisha culture of the area is also brought in.

Lovers of kimono will appreciate the understated costumes of the proprietress of the wagashi shop---a middle-aged beauty who wears kimonos of subtle charm with grace and ease---and manages the shop, the staff and the neighbors with the same grace and tact.

But above all, it is the sense of community and continuing tradition that warms the heart as this ode to wagashi unfolds. Of course, it is something of a fairy tale in these times, but in this idealized view of Asakusa, we can dream of a world where people care for each other in kind acts as well as words.",1468540800,,1822,4.967213114754099
