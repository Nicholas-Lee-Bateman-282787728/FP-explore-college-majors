7901599,5,9089701583,"My grandson is fascinated with sea life, and he loves this DVD.  Some people, mostly adults, might find it a bit boring, but to our 5-year old grandson it's amazing, and it gives him time to look everything over in the water.",1466726400,,225,4.357142857142857

7901602,4,9089701583,I bought the video for some unobtrusive color & sound while I do needlework and it works very well. However the real fan is my cat who races to sit in front of the tv the minute she hears the ocean sounds.,1448064000,2,205,3.9047619047619047

7901604,4,9089701583,"Nicely done in some segments.  A bit more sitting on a given subject than I would prefer, which tends to confine viewing to a limited activity.  That one limp black starfish hanging motionless on coral for an extended period.......too much like a dead Tarantula.  I was relieved when the camera finally moved on.  This particular DVD is very similar to a static aquarium setting.",1414454400,,379,4.875

I like the music options, but I don't use the sea sounds because if you're underwater, you wouldn't hear that. All in all, a wonderful purchase.",1322524800,2,279,4.185185185185185
