4671556,5,B005F3DFXG,"The product was purchased by me on april 28th and it seemed to be fine, until I put in my PS3. Honestly im a little ticked the disc was said to be an ""ALL REGION"" format ,but when I received the product it said it was only ""REGIONS 2&4"".Now being in a REGION 1 area you can see where a REGION 2 and REGION 4 blu-ray can be a problem for me.",1337299200,5,340,3.736111111111111
4671557,5,B005F3DFXG,"This is an excellent companion set to Walking With Dinosaurs, far more updated of course (yet discoveries are made every day still!), better graphics, but Walking With included Mammals and Amphibians of the age as well, so that series should not be discounted as of yet, anyway.  Planet Dinosaur does include Marine Reptiles and Plesiosaurs as well as dinosaurs.
Episode 1 deals with Spinosaurus, bigger and meaner than the famous T- Rex,
Episode 2 deals with the recent bird like dinosaurs,
Episode 3 deals with the Tyranosaurs
Episodes 4 and 5 deal with the marine reptiles and the four legged giants,
Episode 6 deals with the oddities and the mass extinction of everything that weighed more than 40 kilograms.
This series shows how they piece together the theories and the dates of the discoveries as well as the relative size to humans.
I ordered it from amazon.ca and it played on my blu-ray player, people having issues with this should upgrade their players with software available free online (the extras disc is a dvd so I can't play that one).",1331942400,3,1053,4.85
4671558,5,B005F3DFXG,"Let me just say, I really hope this documentary sets a precedent for more like it to come. The effects were as good as they get, but the style is what I really enjoyed. The action shots were rendered with a hand-held cam effect, with the camera probing to find the animal, and zooming wide for scale and then close up, as if it were filmed by a real wildlife camera crew. To top it off though, additional material was presented in a hyperlink-type format, with text, images and video expanding from the original picture. Plus, scaled pictures of fossils and dinosaurs next to each other and humans were almost always offered. I absorbed the information so much better that way, rather than just hearing that T-Rex was over 12 meters, which can be distracting when your attention turns to imagining how 12 meters compares to you. This documentary was tailor-made for the digital generation; it was like the iPad of documentaries, and I sincerely hope there are many, many more to come!! Bravo, BBC!!! Like Walking with Dinosaurs, Planet Earth, etc., once again, you are setting new trends in documentary film-making.",1327881600,4,1115,4.8125

The updated science and updated effects make it worth the time for any viewers! I've heard some experts claim the science may be dubious, at best, but as a lay-man, all I know is that it's an entertaining couple of hours wherein you are bound to learn something new and accurate.

I expected authoritative speculation, which makes any dinosaur discussion a bit tiresome, but the lack of any other aspect of speculated dino life made this series down right tedious to watch. Surely dinosaurs mated, played, slept or relaxed in the sunlight as well as hunted, just like other animals, no?

It can also get gory and focuses quite a bit on predator-prey relationships and co-evolution. The killing is graphic for younger audiences. Best science based/focused series about dinosaurs I have found yet, and I have a high school electives course on the Mesozoic I run which is video heavy and have looked through many series.

Disc two (DVD feature) does not play. But I really do not care about it.

The documentary itself is as bit as stunning as the other reviewers said. The only negative is the navigation menu.

4671902,5,B005F3DFXG,"""We are living in the golden age of Dinosaur discovery,"" intones the narrator at the beginning of ""Planet Dinosaur.""  Then, in this series of shows, he demonstrates that, that is not an exaggeration: It is the honest truth.  The creatures detailed here from the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous are phenomenally fascinating, and they hold the attention of the viewer every second that they are on screen.

The CGI in this series is some of the best that I have ever seen in a nature documentary.  There are times when one may as well be watching a BBC series on animals' living today with a narrator's telling of their life histories and dynamic interactions with other species.  Cut in with the CGI are graphic glyphs that tell of the geological time, place and date of discovery of the fossils that form the basis of the creatures created herein.  The computer images and the science behind them are absolutely first rate.

My copy of this DVD is one that I ordered from Amazon UK, and it is in PAL Region 2 format.  As I have an all-regions DVD player, I can play it with no difficulties.  The British version comprises two DVD's.  I believe that the American version comprises the first British DVD with the second one's being omitted.

The first DVD comprises six episodes: Lost World, Feathered Dragons, Last Killers, Fight for Life, New Giants and The Great Survivors.  The second DVD comprises a background feature, ""How to Build a Dinosaur,"" that elucidates how the study of the fossils leads to the reconstruction of the dinosaurs that we see in museums and in films.  It is hosted by one of Britain's best known presenters the very smart and attractive Dr. Alice Roberts.

In the first DVD, the series moves from Africa to China to the Lost Islands of Europe with their shallow, surrounding seas to the deeper oceans to North America and South America to the High Arctic to Madagascar.  It is a world-wide exploration of dinosaur species, especially the new ones which have only recently been unearthed.  Amongst some of those that have aroused the strong interest of the public are Africa's Spinosaurus with its huge back frill and the latest discoveries from the East.

""One country sits at the centre of a new Dinosaur revolution: China,"" says the narrator at the beginning of ""Feathered Dragons.""  This is so very true.  From a slight trickle of fossils with evidence of feathers, a flood has descended upon us.  New feathered dinosaurs are constantly being brought to light.  From the impressions of their feathers, it can be determined whether they were for display, warmth or flight.  In some case, even the colours are known.  The connection between birds and certain groups of Dinosaurs with a common ancestor's lying somewhere back in history is now irrefutable.

One of the great examples of parallel evolution is shown in the ""Feathered Dragons"" segment.  A small, feathered Dinosaur with body feathers and large tail feathers for display, also, has large, gnawing, front teeth and and elongated fingers for prying out grubs and insects from trees.  It is the reptilian, ecological equivalent of today's Aye-Aye in Madagascar.  The huge evidence of evolution in Dinosaurs demonstrates the enormous genius of Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace.  The rules and laws of evolution developed by Darwin and Wallace do not just apply to the the animals of their day and today: They apply to Dinosaurs, too.

This is a superlative show.  It will entertain and inform not just youngsters, but, also, adults, too. This is a show well worth having in one's DVD library.

I would feel just as comfortable letting my 5 year old watch it as the older kids.

If you enjoy shows like Chased By Dinosaurs or Prehistoric Park, this will be a welcome addition. Unlike Walking With Dinosaurs derived series, it does not always end with the helpless little animal ground down in the teeth of the monstrous predator, or death by starvation due to some hideous injury - it won't leave you depressed, but instead has an excited, upbeat approach to the the evolution and life of dinosaurs.",1408665600,,871,4.583333333333333

Transporting viewers to locations across the globe and back in time through tens of millions of years, Planet Dinosaur 3D' brings to life the most awesome and amazing creatures that ever lived, rendered in visually stunning 3D technology. Most were discovered in the last 10 years and entailed a rewriting of the prehistory books.

Palaeontologists now know that dinosaurs spread to every part of the globe, and evolved in ways so monstrous, horrific and bizarre they make T Rex look very tame indeed. Unlike any dinosaur show before it and shot in stunning 3D CGI this is a completely immersive visual experience studded with curious facts and jaw-dropping action as well as charismatic monsters brought to life on screen. Presenting a brand-new global perspective on the prehistoric era, the series recreates the creatures, their habitats and how they lived, from analysing their bones to watching them fight to the death. Narrated by John Hurt.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: We've been fascinated with Dinosaurs for years, especially from Jurassic Park to the BBC Walking with Dinosaurs TV series. This 45 minute documentary was and still is a massive big hit, especially us in the United Kingdom it was originally broadcast on the BBC in a six part 30 minute programme.

The new BBC Blu-ray release of Planet Dinosaur 3D' which contains all six half-hour episodes of the series, which originally aired in the U.K. in 2011. Planet Dinosaur 3D' is narrated by John Hurt, who can do no wrong in my eyes, who has that voice of authority, especially he is up there with all the professional Shakespeare actors, and this BBC dicumentary explores different time periods, namely Late Jurassic and Early, Middle, and Late Cretaceous, as well as a variety of regions in this period of Asia, Mongolia, Madagascar, Europe, North America, South and North Africa, and Romania. It contains some of the best CGI-created dinosaurs ever produced for television. As the introduction to each show explains, We are living through the golden age of dinosaur discoveries. From all over the world, a whole new generation of dinosaurs is being revealed. From the biggest giants and the deadliest killers, to the weird and wonderful. From the Arctic to Africa, from South America to Asia, using the latest evidence, for the first time we have a truly global view of these incredible animals.

Using high tech CGI recreations, we see an enormous amount of dinosaurs such as the Spinosaurus (which are bigger than a T-Rex), Onchopristis (giant fish), Ouranosaurus, Epidexipteryx, Carcharodontosaurus, Sauromithoides, Gigantoraptor, Microraptor, Xianglong, Sinomithosaurus, Jeholosaurus, Daspletosaurus, Chasmosaurus, Majungasaurus, Kimmerosaurus, Stegosaurus, Camptosaurus, Predator X, Allosaurus, Argentinosaurus, Skorpiovenator, Mapusaurus, Megyarosaurus, Hatzegopteryx, and more. The 45 minute documentary provides us with hunting, history, extinction, eating habits, and food chain information on the above listed dinosaurs as well.

When it comes to BBC history/documentary/nature productions, you know you are always going to experience awesome and professional high quality and Planet Dinosaur 3D' is no exception. Instead of featuring bland interviews and or dopey recreations like we see with many TV documentaries, the crew of `Planet Dinosaur 3D' goes all out here to make the series as informative and visually exciting as possible. As an added bonus, the series covers a lot of Dinosaurs people may not be familiar with which gives the series a fresh perspective. It's always refreshing to see a documentary that doesn't recycle old hashed material.

I'm a massive big fan of these CGI dinosaur specials, especially in the stunning 3D format, and above all else, they're just fun to watch. The world of the dinosaurs is brought to life in vivid fashion in this program, with a feast of sights to soak in. The range of creatures showcased is impressive as well, especially since most of them are newly discovered. The animation isn't going to challenge Pixar of course, but it looks terrific and the attention to detail is remarkable. As fun as it is to watch dinosaurs run around, Planet Dinosaur 3D' also aims to educate and it succeeds in that venue as well. The program is loaded with information about the dinosaurs and the world they lived in, presented in a way that manages to add to the entertainment value. But the real draw is of course being able to watch dinosaurs in the wild, even if it is via computer animation. `Planet Dinosaur 3D' has some terrific visuals that showcase some exciting moments of dinosaur fun, so for dinosaur devotees. Summary: Whether seeing the dinosaurs in the land, air, or sea or learning about their possible evolution into birds, Planet Dinosaur 3D' is bound to capture your interest.

Blu-ray Video Quality  `Planet Dinosaur 3D' is presented in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen. The 45 minute documentary looks terrific, and it makes a whole lot more of an experience when you put on your 3D glasses, then you gets to see a whole new aspect of this wonderful Blu-ray disc and makes the dinosaurs look so realistic. The visuals look good, with a lot of well detailed image and no real issues to contend with. The depth of field in the 3D image is totally awesome and the fine detail is also brilliant, especially when get up close to the scales on the giant dinosaurs. The colours are often lush, and the earth tones look good also, while contrast is stark and consistent. In the end, a more than capable visual treatment for your eyes, especially in the awesome 3D format, as the dinosaurs really do come alive and at times you think they are going to walk out of the screen into your lounge, definitely edge of your seat entertainment.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack here is totally awesome, especially when the massive large dinosaurs roar out loud, and is a totally expansive presence you'd expect from dinosaur battles. The awesome audio surround is clean and sounds fine, with no errors I could detect. The elements come across well enough, but there isn't that kick you'd want to hear from the roars and howls of the beasts. The narration and music sound good, but otherwise, this track could have used a surround boost, to be sure. This disc also includes English subtitles. But of course with the super smooth dulcet voice of John Hurt's narration, certainly adds to the ambience of this 45 minute presentation.

Finally, obviously, if dinosaurs aren't your thing, then `Planet Dinosaur 3D' will probably offer nothing to tempt you back into the giant-lizard-loving fold, but with this awesome Blu-ray 3D presentation, you will experience something totally unique and seeing the dinosaurs in 3D is so life like. There's also the feeling that no matter how up-to-date the info is with this Blu-ray and no matter how awesome the dinosaurs looks now, it will very soon be superseded by another documentary series with even newer information about how everything we currently think is wrong, but in the meantime this is the best on offer for this moment in time. `Planet Dinosaur 3D is totally awesome that gives you the viewers a good sense of where our knowledge about dinosaurs is at this moment in time. Combining nature-documentary styling with a competent narration from brilliant smooth-voiced John Hurt, `Planet Dinosaur 3D' is sure to please budding archaeologists and older dinosaur fans alike and that is why it is a great pleasure to add this to my Blu-ray Collection. But sadly I feel they could have added some extras to make the Blu-ray disc so much more interesting, especially seeing behind the scene on how they produced the 3D dinosaurs on the computers, but at the know down price of 6.00, it was still worth purchasing. Highly Recommended!

The series is divided into six episodes, and takes a look at some discoveries from the dinosaur world that changed our view of them forever. I only hate the stupid feathered dinosaurs.

The series showcases many different types of dinosaurs, including ferocious carnivores, docile herbivores, and a mixture of in-between creatures.  What I found so interesting about this series is the variety of unusual dinosaurs that I had never even heard of!  This is no depiction of the typical Tyrannosaurus, Stegosaurus, and Velociraptor - rather, it shows creatures that heretofore have only been known to researchers and paleontologists.

The graphic depictions are interspersed with scientific analyses, showing bones and other fossil records and where they were found.  The series does a nice job of contrasting the different time periods and the different creatures who inhabited those time periods.  When you realize the overwhelming variety of dinosaurs that have existed, and how much we actually know about them, you will be astonished.

The series is divided into 6 smaller segments, each about 30 minutes.  The narration by John Hurt is perfect - understated but just enough to keep you focused on what you are seeing.

I would highly recommend this series to any dinosaur fanatics out there - you will not be sorry!",1381881600,,1432,5.1558441558441555

My favorite part about it is how it features species of dinosaurs that I don't usually see in other documentaries, like Spinosaurus, Carcharodontosaurus, and Microraptor. The series is very detailed and gives a lot of information. Another thing about it is that it isn't just a bunch of dinosaurs eating things and fighting each other. When they fight, eat things, or have certain features, it always explains why they are doing what they are doing or why they look how they look in the film, usually with fossil evidence. I also find that the series is very accurate except in a few cases. (Example: The Troodons do not have feathers, which many scientists think that they did.)

4672093,3,B005F3DFXG,"Yes, the CGI is more advanced and at times impressive, but also sterile and unengaging. Unfortunately, the narrative structure of the original BBC series 'Walking with dinosaurs' has been abandoned in favour of a succession of random facts and scenes. Combined with surroundings that are now completely digital, it just doesn't feel like you're there any more. It's not Walking With Dinosaurs, it's Watching Clips Of Dinosaurs.

Next time, bring back story arc, emotional involvement, actual backdrops, Kenneth Brannagh and composer Benjamin Bartlett.",1358812800,2,551,5.63855421686747
4672094,5,B005F3DFXG,"If you loved the original Walking With Dinosaurs series (and I still do!), you must see this.  Like WWD, it's almost all dino-animation; very little interruption - and when the flow is broken, it's to explain the scientific reasoning that supports the (sometimes surprising) conclusions.  And while WWD's animation was excellent for its time, this show demonstrates the improvements possible with 2012 technology.

If you were disappointed by Jurassic Fight Club (and I was!), this is everything JFC wasn't.  No repetition of video sequences, and best of all, no annoying George Blasing (sorry, George).

I see a lot of reviews for dinosaur shows that begin with something like, ""My 5-year-old grandson is crazy for dinosaurs, so I bought him this...""  Well, maybe you think dinosaurs are a phase that you're supposed to grow out of, but not all of us think like that.  And the BBC, with ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" and this show, Planet Dinosaur, acknowledges this fact.  This is NOT a kiddie show.  This is aimed at an adult, very sophisticated audience, and it shows.

The visuals here are beautiful, and often stunning.  The animation is so lifelike it must be seen to be believed.  The effects are amazing - my favorite may be the running raid on a Centrosaur herd by a group of Daspletosaurs, driving them into a flooding river -- in a thunderstorm.

As someone mentioned, many animals make their animated debuts in this series, and they're worth the wait.  Don't confuse Planet Dinosaur with ""Dinosaur Planet""; that was good, but this is far, far better.

One earlier review complained about the constant ""drumbeat"" of eating and killing, that dinosaurs are portrayed as mindless eating machines.  Well, unless you read different science books than I do, I have to say that's pretty much what they were, and what most animals still are.  When they're not sleeping or breeding, most animals are either eating, trying to kill another animal, or trying not to be killed.  I'm not sure what more the other reviewer expected, because watching dinos sleep makes a pretty slow-moving video.

Still, it's true that the predation is realistic, graphic, and relentless, and might be scary (or ""gross"") for very young viewers.  If you're buying dinosaur shows for your grandchildren, this might not be the best choice.  For a proverbial dino-crazed 5-year-old, I recommend Disney's ""Dinosaur"" movie, or PBS' excellent ""Dinosaur Train"" series (which actually has good science and a real scientist).

For the adult dinosaur enthusiast, though, and with all respect to Walking With Dinosaurs (a classic, and still one of my favorites) if you only have room for one dino DVD on your shelf, this is the one to buy.",1358553600,56,2702,4.997762863534676
4672095,5,B005F3DFXG,"BBC made this series more than a decade after their Walking with Dinosaurs series. Compared to Walking with Dinosaurs, this newer series incorporated research findings in the past ten years. The visual effect on the Blu-ray Discs are very sharp, much more clearer than Walking with Dinosaurs. However, since this series is completely made with CGI, it does not have the real environmental shots as in the Walking with Dinosaurs. The production cost of this series was 1/3 of that of Walking with Dinosaurs for the same reason. My only complaint about the visual is that at times the dinosaurs look pretty rubbery, almost toyish. But overall, the visual is still stunning.

This series has research snippets embedded in the the presentation, so much more educational. You know why the scientists reached certain conclusions and what was pure speculation.

The series does NOT play in many of the US Bluray players. I bought the same bluray discs from Amazon UK site for 1/3 of the price on Amazon US site (including shipping from UK to US). On Amazon UK site, the discs are claimed to be region free. But it also says  Please note that this product will not play on US spec 60i Blu-ray players as the Blu-ray discs are authored to UK 50i specs.

4672118,3,B005F3DFXG,"I got the 3d version of this and though the effects were excellent, the narrative content was basically a march of death, one kill after another.  Interesting for awhile but eventually it just seemed to make these animals out to be mindless eating machines with identical pointy tails, and slightly different sized teeth.

There was a short respite in the relentless drum beat of dining where a herd of Ceratopsians drowned crossing a river (for once, not eaten) but the narration took special care to say ""wholesale slaughter occurred"" at least six times, and follow their sinking carcasses down into the deep.
The movie ended with the ever famous asteroid heading for the Gulf of Mexico, where we got the pleasure of watching ALL of them keel over, choke whither and die.

Did they do anything but kill and fight off being killed?  Surely this is only a very small part of their day.... but then maybe thats what the public craves.

4672122,4,B005F3DFXG,"Planet Dinosaur is a very good documentary, in a six episode format a la Walking With Dinosaurs, covering some of the most important finds of the last 20 or so years.

The first episode covers the three superpredators of Mid Cretaceous Africa - Spinosaurus, Carcharodontosaurus and the crocodilian Sarcosuchus (a/k/a SuperCroc), which remarkably coexisted together.  The second episode covers some of the more important feathered dinosaurs of Asia which have changed the way we look at dinosaurs.  The third episode profiles Daspletosaurus and Majungasaurus as representatives of the two major predator groups that dominated the Late Cretaceous worldwide.  Episode four takes a look at two Jurassic predators - the sea monster Predator X and the domination of Allosaurus by it's less prolific but larger relative Saurophaganax (stay tuned for further scientific news regarding whether or not it's actually not a separate species but rather an oversized Allosaurus).  Episode 5 profiles the sauropods Argentinosaurus and Paralititan, two contenders for the largest dinosaur ever found.  The series wraps up jumping around to examine several lesser known dinosaurs of the Late Cretaceous.

There are a few instances where the CGI seemed evident to me, but all in all there were alot of quite memorable images.  A few of the dinosaurs have already been covered in other documentaries, but there are also a few long overdue debuts.  Camptosaurus, a mid-sized herbivore which appeared in almost every kid's dino book back in the day but is probably not quite as well known by today's kids, finally shows up after having been inexplicably omitted from Walking With's Jurassic episode and Allosaurus spinoff.  Chasmosaurus, my choice for the most beautiful horned dinosaur, makes a full appearance after having only shown up, to my knowledge, in a brief section of the Bizarre Dinosaurs special covering Ceratopsian headgear.  The highlight of the set might be the elegant potential death race (flight?) between China's Microraptor and Sinornithosaurus, a surprisingly creepy and nasty little predator.

 Planet Dinosaur is an almost three hour Blu-Ray disc showing all six episodes from the BBC series special. Narrated by John Hurt, the CG graphics are extremely well done. I know its an over-used word but I thought several scenes were truly awesome. In between the CG action scenes, we are shown various graphics and fossilized bones that tell us stories about the dinosaur's fights and their lives. The show provides some great, very up-to-date information; some of which, I dare say, you did not know. The first episode is set in prehistoric Africa, where we follow a Spinosaurus and meet Carcharodontosaurus, Ouranosaurus, Sarchosuchus, Rugops and more. The second episode is all about the feathered dinosaurs of China. Episode 3 covers the Late Cretaceous and the meat-eaters of that era. Part 4 is set in the Jurassic where we watch not only stegosaurs and allosaurs but marine reptiles too, including the huge Predator X. (It's a funny term, so I was surprised to hear John Hurt seriously use the word ""Thagomizer"" to describe Stegosaurus spikes.) The fifth episode is mostly about sauropods and other large dinosaurs and the final episode shows various dinosaur forms that evolved to help dinosaurs survive. I highly recommend the show; but, as mentioned at the beginning of this review there is a possible problem. The Blu-Ray would not play on my Blu-Ray player, even though it is supposedly for all areas of the world. I have a new laptop that plays Blu-Ray movies and fortunately it did fine on it.
