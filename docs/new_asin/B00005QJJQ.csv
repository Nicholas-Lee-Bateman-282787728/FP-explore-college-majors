7950680,2,B00005QJJQ,"Two siblings (Brendan Ward/Melissa Esposito) run away from their foster parents and live in an abandoned building in the South Bronx. They get caught breaking into the apartment of Tony (Mario Van Peebles) and his sister Christie (Megan Van Peebles). The parents produce child pornography and Tony, fresh from a Mexican jail plans a shakedown.

Mario's real life sister played his on screen sister. This film proved to be a career ender for her and the two kids. The acting wasn't that great. There was a seen of break dancing and some gangs (consisting of three people) attempting to rob people. Some people consider this film ""a classic."" I see it as ""dated.""

7950686,5,B00005QJJQ,An excellent depiction of World War II front line combat.  Many consider this the film noir of WWII.,1227398400,,100,4.555555555555555
7950687,3,B00005QJJQ,"This is a VERY cheesy-looking early-1980s action/comedy/drama that reminds you of the kind of stuff that appeared on the infamous ""ABC Afterschool Specials"" of the era. It has a very ""home movie"" look to it.

Essentially, it's the tale of how Mario and his real life sister Megan Van Peebles, living together in a cheap South Bronx apartment, work together to survive their gangster infested neighborhood after he comes out of jail and she substitute-teaches fresh out of college. They catch a teenager breaking into their home, and the kid and his sister are on the run from sleazy child pornographers (interesting considering Mario's own turn in the nauseating ""Sweet Sweetback"" when HE was kid, but I digress).

While the subject matter is quite grim, the film does not exploit the subject and though the acting is typical of low-budget potboilers, you feel a geniune liking for the Van Peebles siblings and empathy for the teenage twosome who try to escape the dirtbag kiddie-porn freaks.

Overall, it is rough going in the first half-hour or so and some people may not want to watch it for very long. But give it a chance and it is not a bad way to spend a rainy Saturday or Sunday afternoon.",1224115200,,1197,4.7451923076923075
7950688,1,B00005QJJQ,Digitally remastered? Absolutely not! Converted to digital format? Yes. The digital conversion is so bad that the sound goes out of sync with the picture. My VHS tape has better video quality. Save your money and don't buy this DVD. Hopefully someone reputable will one day truly remaster this great movie.,1148947200,6,306,5.019607843137255
7950689,5,B00005QJJQ,"I use the term ordinary to emphasize just how extraordinary the US infantryman was in WWII. In motion pictures it seems that most war films focus and glorify trained teams sent on secret missions or small groups of elite fighting men trained for a specific purpose. Most of these films never really focus on the men, the morality and camaraderie developed (one exception being THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE) and the day-to-day grind of combat and unsettled nerves. A WALK IN THE SUN is one of a handful of war films that focuses on these endearing elements of civilian men thrown into this mundane (on the surface) yet extraordinary routine of constant exposure to death from enemy ordnance. They are a unit from mixed backgrounds thrown into this maelstrom of uncertainty and death. They develop camaraderie and build trust in each other and execute the daily task they are ordered to without real knowledge of the bigger picture and without specific question of purpose. They get the job done ay any cost whatever the reason. Men die, they grieve and they keep moving. They are on the lowest rung in the field of getting the job done. And they persevere. Recent pictures like SAVING PRIVATE and the restored Sam Fuller epic THE BIG RED ONE have redirected the focus to the lowly ordinary infantryman out there getting the job done. BATTLEGROUND and THE STORY OF G.I. JOE have been around for a while and they too have gotten their deserved recognition. Their greatness comes because they have focused on the men. A WALK IN THE SUN is poetic in nature. Mild mannered Sterling Holloway's death scene is very poignant and difficult to watch and even fathom because of the irony that war has exposed these men to. The diversity of the men is great yet the leader types pick up and take charge when it becomes necessary without any hesitation. Dana Andrews is a man seeing that they get the job done. John Ireland, in one of his better performances, is a distant and cool character that seems like the eyes and ears of the viewer taking in all that transpires. Screenwriter Robert Rossen's script is rich in the character studies of these men including Richard Conte, Lloyd Bridges, Norman Lloyd, George Tyne, Huntz Hall and Herbert Rudley under Lewis Milestone's lyrical direction.",1143158400,3,2269,4.805626598465473
