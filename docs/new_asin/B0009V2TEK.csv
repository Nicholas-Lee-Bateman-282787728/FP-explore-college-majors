8188783,2,B0009V2TEK,"When I purchased this item from Amazon.com, I was expecting to get a VHS tape of a Canadian cartoon called, ""Stickin Around"". What I found out and got instead is a VHS tape titled, ""The Heavens are Opened"" from something called ""The Docudrama of the Restoration"". It has something to do with a family learning about the importance of God and all that stuff (I think).

I never opened it 'cause I'm planning on returning this to get my money back.

It might be a good watch, but if you're trying to sell something, don't put the title of another series to another program in your description! I understand it's my fault for not looking at it clearly, but I shouldn't have to read every fine print on a product to see if it's legit!

I sent an e-mail to the person about this issue and they stated to send it back so I can get a refund.

Don't have much else to say. It came in good condition, though.",1253232000,,899,4.270588235294118
