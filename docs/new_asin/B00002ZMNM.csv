7916352,4,B00002ZMNM,"The action in Boneshakers ROCKS like no independent film I've ever seen!
The cover box says ""San Francisco bicycle messengers crash a mob scheme to kidnap the homeless and sell their organs"". And, crash they  do!  I've never before seen martial arts fights like this mix with great  dramatic performances in an independent film. Perhaps that's because the  theatrically trained star ""action hunk"" D'cember Williams, and  icy antagonist Michael Quijano are both active military.
The most  handsome African-American performer on the screen, The Marine Corps own  stage star, D'cember does it all; he fights, he acts, he jokes, he looks  purty for the camera!  Choreographing most of the fight scenes, Special  Forces medal winner Michael(Nico)Quijano flies through the air with the  greatest of flying kicks while delivering an equally forceful performance  that makes the Boneshakers quake in their boots.
Additional Joey Award  nominated performances by the other players make it all work. Most notably:  seamlessly motivated Sean O'Kane (brash cop on the take), sexy screen siren  Thauo Vu (bicycle messengerette), acclaimed actor John Westernoff  (hilarious homie), hyper-embellishing actor Michael Stires(evil incarnation  of McCloud), The Asian Brando-Howard Fong (homeless homie), amasing  director Shawn Flanagan (super cool bad guy).
Also, Avant-garde Actors  Theatre idolater and filmmaker Chris Catalano (solid citizen), stage actor  Tony Santucci (cold-blooded killer a who looks like an evil Mike Brady),  intense method actor Kevin Gaunt, commanding screen presence Joe Wolf, and  amazing makeup effects man Bobby Castillo.
