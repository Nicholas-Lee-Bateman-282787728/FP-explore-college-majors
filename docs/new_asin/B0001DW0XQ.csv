He then explains how to drop down and shoot into that perfect position.  He shows drills to help build your speed and movement into the take down. He then finally shows many finishes to the take down. From the basic finish, to adjusting to the opponents sprawl, ankle grab counters, etc.  I have no complaints at all about the dvd.  It was well worth the price. He was so darn good at explaining everything, which is rare in wrestling dvds (I own several), that it convinced me to buy a bunch of his other DVDs and none of them disappoint either, he is just good at explaining things.",1416700800,,725,4.388059701492537
