8547801,3,B00A7DC1IO,"I had previously purchased ""Stretch, Relax and Restore -A Half Hour Christ-centered Approach to Relaxation and Health Through Yoga"" and it really helped me so I decided to purchase another. This video is ok but some of the audio is hard to hear. Also if you are unfamiliar with yoga it can be difficult to follow in places as directions are given while the video is showing candles burning not the person demonstrating the movement. Also found the biblical teachings a bit harsh, comes off as if you are not being healed you are not trusting God, or believing His word. One last piece of advice, if you have wrist problems this is not the video for you as there are plank exercises in this video that rely on you being able to place weight on the palm of your hand with bent wrists. The music is relaxing.",1506556800,6,805,4.445945945945946
8547802,5,B00A7DC1IO,I absolutely love this DVD and now do yoga consistently at least 2-3 times per week (I do cardio on other days).,1503014400,,112,4.136363636363637
8547803,5,B00A7DC1IO,I like this DVD. Very relaxing.  Thanks.,1502064000,,40,4.714285714285714
8547804,5,B00A7DC1IO,"This DVD is very good. She is excellant.
I used this video to help me regain some balance and strength after brain surgery and chemo. I love the background with reading of healing scripture. It was during a session of using this video that God softly spoke to me and assured me of being healed. This was almost two yrs ago and all cancer gone . Gods word is true and strong, combined with relaxing yoga that does challenge you a bit ( you can rest when need to) its a win - win",1496620800,4,477,4.085106382978723
8547805,4,B00A7DC1IO,"I am not good at relaxing when I want to work out, but it is great when relaxing is just what you need.",1493251200,,103,3.5217391304347827
8547806,5,B00A7DC1IO,Using on off days from Yahweh Yoga classes at my church. Love it!,1477353600,,65,4.076923076923077
8547807,5,B00A7DC1IO,I love this DVD and I believe it is a must have in any yoga routine. I broke my back about 3 years ago and have multiple sports injuries. I was in a constant state of chronic pain until I found this DVD. DeAnna takes you through such a gentle sequence of postures that truly promotes healing. I feel like a million bucks after I finish this DVD and I make sure to make it a part of my weekly yoga routine to help with my chronic back pain and to prevent further injuries. Highly recommended to anyone with physical limiations or injuries to provide lasting relief.,1374019200,16,564,4.280373831775701
