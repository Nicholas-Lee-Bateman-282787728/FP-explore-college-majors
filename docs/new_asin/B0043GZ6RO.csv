4255707,1,B0043GZ6RO,This is a good movies but this dvd is jacked up. A lot of the movie I could not see. The movie would freeze up in some section. Am not happy with it at all.,1306454400,,156,3.4857142857142858
4255708,5,B0043GZ6RO,"A friend told me about this movie a few weeks ago, so I decided to purchase it since he gave a glowing review about it.  I myself was also just as impressed.  The story centers around a gay Black teenager named Sequan from Brooklyn, whose mother passes and he moves to Alabama to live with relatives (though it is never revealed if they are kin to his mother or father).  He is immediately thrown into a mix of unfortunate events that expose the ills of the people who reside within the town he now calls home.

[SPOILER ALERT] Sequan is booksmart and intelligent, but still manages to come off as ""soft"" to the rest of the world.  As soon as he moves in with his aunt, he is immediately bullied by his cousin Michael, who is a star on the high school basketball team.  Others in his English class continue to taunt him as well, and he is subject to beatings by Michael and Ahmed, another player on the basketball team who also is a drug dealer.  One night Michael approaches him about his sexuality and forces him to undress and take pictures of him in compromising positions, before finally forcing him to engage in sexual acts with him.  This continues throughout the course of the film, with Michael later admitting to Sequan that he is gay but it is not accepted and will not be good for him and his goals of eventually reaching the NBA.

Sequan attempts to find solice in his uncle, who is the town's sherrif, and asks to stay with him and his wife, a moderately successful children's book writer.  His uncle finds excuses not to grant Sequan's request, despite being suspicious of his bruises from the beatings and comments about him from Michael during an interregation about a missing gun and murder.  Ahmed's girlfriend, Lori, befriends Sequan after seeing the boys beat him one day and his response to possibly being beat again the next day in class, and they become close.  He gives her a book by James Baldwin that his deceased mother gave him, and she begins to think for herself rather than following the crowd, which infuriates Ahmed, as he is already jealous of the way she responds to Sequan.  After overdosing on drugs one night during an outing at the carnival, Jake, Lori's brother, picks the two up, and they begin to talk.  Michael becomes jealous after seeing Jake drop him off that night, and claims his position in Sequan's life, telling him that he belongs to him only.  The next day, the three hang out and teach Sequan how to swim in the river.  Trusting them, he reveals that Michael has been raping him.

Sequan's uncle moves closer on his investigation of the missing gun when someone calls to alert that the body of a missing boy has been found near the river.  His uncle revs up his investigation, which takes him back to the high school where it is revealed that the principle was aware of the murder but ignored it because it involved Ahmed, among others, who is also one of the star basketball players.  As the locker searches commence, Michael's locker is searched and the camera with the nude shots of Sequan is discovered by his uncle.  Michael flees the school and his uncle goes to search for Sequan.  Sequan and Jake ride with Lori, who attempts to cover up Ahmed's illegal activities by gathering all the drugs and money, but he is fast on their trail and confronts her at the house with his boys.  Sequan hides in Lori's truck, where the missing gun has been stashed in the glove compartment the entire time, and threatens to shot Ahmed if he doesn't let them go.  Ahmed pulls one off on Sequan, shoots him in the stomach, and Lori and Jake take him to get help.  Sequan's uncle shows up at the house where Ahmed is and shoots him, then finds Sequan lying in a nearby field with Jake as Lori looks on in her car. [SPOILER ALERT]

Growing up in Alabama myself, I felt the movie was an accurate depiction of the mindsets and stereotypes of some in the South who have not lived outside the comfort zones they have made their own reality.  It resonated with me on a personal level, and reiterated a universal theme of the tendecy we as people have to just look the other way when we know something is wrong, and ignore it until the absolute worst happens.

I would say that the cover photos and subsequent summary on the back of the DVD are a bit misleading.  This movie does not really focus on a relationship between a young interracial couple.  In fact, that bond only occurs within the last 15-20 minutes of the film in which Jake (Lori's brother) is introduced.  If anything, the main character, Sequan, is just a link to all the events that transpire throughout the course of the film.  The plot was definitely much bigger than Sequan's sexuality.

Features to the DVD include audio commentary by the director and producer, extended and deleted scenes, outtakes, and theatrical trailer.  Great film, acting, and direction.  Impressed with the fact that it told a different story unlike some of the other more main stream Black gay films.  Definitely worth the purchase, I highly recommend this film.",1306022400,7,5046,4.568888888888889
4255709,5,B0043GZ6RO,"This film is excellently directed, with a believable script and wonderful acting by all involved. At the end of the movie, I was left feeling uncomfortable, angry, hopeful and sad all at once. I wanted the movie to continue, not because it was incomplete, but I wanted a Hollywood ending where all are happy and the good guys win. Instead, we were presented with real life where sometimes there is more violence than love and the innocent lose out. If you want an intense emotional experience with totally believable characters, do yourself a favor and pick this up. You won't be disappointed.",1299801600,4,593,4.823529411764706

4255711,2,B0043GZ6RO,"I did not like this film because the concentration was upon the violence, and the violations, done to the main character.  I had expected this film to present a good inter-racial gay love story, but that was only tangentially and very briefly touched.
This film is about a young teenage boy who moves from New York to rural Alabama to live with his aunt, after his mother dies.  He finds it difficult adjusting to the 'ways of the South', and especially the rampant male bravado and the homophobia of his own roommate cousin, a cousin who is a star athlete in school, but who harbors his own homosexual demons, demons which terrorise the film's protagonist.  The violence of this film, first between two characters, then nearly all others, overtakes a story which, at its core, was good and solid.  Unfortunately, I was so disappointed with this film that I could not add it to my small but growing collection of gay independent films, for it is certainly not a film I should like to see again, much less enjoy with my partner.",1296950400,9,1027,4.626373626373627
4255712,5,B0043GZ6RO,"An African-American gay teenager from New York finds himself living with relatives in rural Alabama, following the death of his mother.  Sequan has to share a room with the family's son, a star basketball player, who quickly senses his weakness and rapes the young man.  Sequan also faces challenges at school, except for one girl who becomes a friend and plays matchmaker between him and her own kid brother.

This is an outstanding film, well written, directed, acted and photographed, providing a dark picture of the problems in a small-minded Southern town, including corruption, violence, rampant drug use among teens, petty thefts, and latent racial tensions. Won awards at several film festivals, including a well-deserved one for Derrick Middleton (Sequan).  DVD includes commentary, extended and deleted scenes.  Unrated, but would be R for sexual content (no nudity).  Five stars out of five.",1294099200,13,902,5.316901408450704

4255714,4,B0043GZ6RO,"Not bad for a low-budget movie. The only disappointment, was that
it ended like so many other gay movies...in tragedy.  I understand
real life isn't all about happy endings, but maybe an inter-racial gay
movie where someone doesn't end up dead?  Hope to see great
things from this director in the future.",1399939200,,304,4.826923076923077
4255715,5,B0043GZ6RO,"Kind of compared to the gay version of ""Precious"" there are so many jaw dropping scenes where you just cant believe all of this is happening to this one kid. The acting wasn't A+ but you definetly get to where the writer/director is going. The ending left you still hanging but there are so many emotions in this movie and they change very fast. Never really boring but sometimes very slow in the story. Still, its now one of my favorites.",1377129600,2,439,4.432098765432099
4255716,3,B0043GZ6RO,"I would have enjoyed it more, if there had been more character development of Sequan, Sequan's cousin, and Sequan's new boyfriend. There is something special about Derrick L. Middleton's acting. He played the role of Sequan with great sensitivity and believability. I look forward to seeing him in the near future acting on the big and small screen.",1373846400,2,349,5.0344827586206895
4255717,2,B0043GZ6RO,"Without writing a review full of spoilers, what I will say is that this film would be better served as a book (if it's not already). The presentation from camera angles, to the type of camera used, to some of the acting comes off as very rough around the edges and not on parr with the subject matter. There are scenes between the lead character and the love interest that are so beautiful and tender but they never really get off the ground when presented on film. I kept thinking (as a writer) that so many of these scenes would've played better as scenes in a book and not on film. Or maybe a more experienced director with a well-funded production team could've produced a more visually enjoyable film. On the up-side, there are stand-out characters and themes and subjects that are dealt with. I'm always looking for films that expose the many different experiences of black gay men but I was more dissapointed with this film than anything. To any person who has the same film interest, I'd suggest you pass on buying this film and go for ""Children of God"" instead which I rank near the top of my lgbt film list.",1367280000,3,1117,4.480392156862745
4255718,5,B0043GZ6RO,"Best gay movie I've seen in awhile. Not a comedy. Great actors, characters and plot. It will pull you in and has intense and sad yet happy moments that make you want to tear up and get in the movie yourself. While the movie is over, you will think about it. Very few movies are like that. Sequan and Jake are great.

With his mother dying, Sequan is forced into having to move to a new, smaller town. With that itself comes the unknown, feeling lost and having to fit in. The main character filled the role very well and was believable. The movie takes you into many issues, one of them being life in the South and homosexuality, being yourself, who you are and sometimes concealing who you are. The details I've noticed were outstanding throughout the movie. While an amazing movie, it left me wanting more. Not spoiling the ending, it felt incomplete. I still would like to know. It is a good movie. I just hope there is a sequel. Please make a part 2. Just a great movie and is Oscar worthy. It is in my collection.",1365120000,,1018,4.329842931937173
4255719,4,B0043GZ6RO,"Just finished watching River Wash Over Me, only thing I can say is I LIKED IT(:
It has interracial love, sex, fights, & drugs. WARNING watch out for the ending it leaves you asking what happens next?????????",1355097600,2,207,4.621621621621622
4255720,2,B0043GZ6RO,"stiff dialogue and uneven storyline prevent me from giving this movie a favorable review.  it had potential to be a better movie, but was derailed by a choppy pace.",1345680000,2,164,4.655172413793103
4255721,5,B0043GZ6RO,"This was one of the best American movies I have seen in a while.  The acting, directing, and screenplay were all exceptional and deserve an Oscar for all categories!  This movie floored me with it's intimacy, honesty and realism. Rarely have I seen the topics of racism, sexism, homophobia and male rape being treated with such clarity. Rivers Wash Over Me is a mile stone, in that it critically looks at the horrors of male rape within the African American community without passing judgement. We seem to feel and understand everybody's position.  Every performance by each actor was of great quality and this film definitely did not get the attention and praise it deserves.  ""Precious"" won all the awards, though I believe ""Rivers Wash Over Me"" is much more riveting, confrontative and intimate than ""Precious"".  The African American community has clearly evolved to a point where they can look at a man raping another man. Sadly, in the gay community, that reality stays mostly off radar, so far.  I highly recommend this movie!",1340150400,,1032,4.936416184971098
4255722,4,B0043GZ6RO,"This movie actual has a good plot/storyline and pretty good acting. Granted its an ""indie"" film so it want have any Michael Bay-type action or camera angles, but it definitely gets its point across. The ending, without spoiling it, takes an unique turn. Worth its weight in four stars!",1311120000,,285,4.836734693877551

8414968,4,B0043GZ6RO,"The word ""great"" is often overused in our society, but not when describing this film. Too deserve that word, pertaining to a movie, you must have the perfect cast; the chemistry must be there between all the actors. They must all perform.  The story has to be a good one, either grabbing the viewer from the beginning, or taking the viewer along, as the story grows, particularly for low budget, non special effects films, where all you have is the story. And if there are no -A- or -B- list actors, then your story had better be good. This movie filled the bill with all of the above. And if your actors can break barriers that they are not a part of in real life,  then they are really good. I have seen -A- list actors not measure up to the roles they were playing. They were too uncomfortable. The different dynamics, added to very good  writing made for a great movie. Derrick Middleton, who played Sequan was perfect with his range of emotions. This movie could've been shot anywhere in America, probably the world. The stories in this movie happen everyday, all over the world. The movie also left the viewer with several questions: What happened to Cameron Mason's character, Michael, who raped Sequan, did Sequan live, Elizabeth Dennis never failed as the druggie girlfriend of drug dealer Ahmed. I wish Aiden Shorts  Myer's character, Lori's brother, could have had more screen time with Sequan; not necessarily sexual, but exploratory, where he and Sequan were concerned. There scene in the graveyard, in the end was beautiful, as was he and his sister teaching Sequan how to float. I was able to get into the characters. The first time Michael raped Sequan, I teared up. When a viewer gets that involved in a movie, the movie has  you. The story was good all the way through. It was so good it grew to great, a word overused in our society.",1468368000,,1852,4.6
8414969,4,B0043GZ6RO,"Such a good B movie! Great storyline, the ending could have been better, but still worth buying. It's not gay buffoonery, you can tell it's not a ""quick stereotype, so the studio can make a quick buck"" kind of film.",1439164800,,215,4.4
