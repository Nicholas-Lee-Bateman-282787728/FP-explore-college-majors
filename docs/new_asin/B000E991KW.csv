8107928,4,B000E991KW,"This is an excellent documentary of the Roswell incident presented on both the pro and con side of the issue. For UFO enthusiasts, there may not be too much new material but some slightly different info. Overall, the presentation is well done and informative. My only complaint is that the audio is very uneven. Definitely worth a view but keep the remote close by.",1522022400,,365,4.71875

I thought the video of ""Secrets of UFOs: Roswell UFO Crash"" was well done and with good information.  It was a rehash of what occured with actors to play the part of the key people.  The video showed all the angles of the crash and what the goverment did to cover the crash up.  The video showed all the sources of the crash and documented what occured.  I would buy the video if I were you and if your a UFO buff, this is a good video to see.",1187395200,8,997,7.487179487179487
8107937,3,B000E991KW,"I bought this item just for the curiousness I have of the unknown and the mysterious phenomena in life. What I got was a lot of government cover-up stories. I'm not interested in cover-up novels ""show me the money"", tell me about UFO technology, alien powers, and authentic abduction accounts.

However, the dvd has some interesting and provocative theories like the surge of UFO appearences during America's atomic weapons testing, which indicates an extraterrestrial interest in man's nuclear feats. Also, the sudden outpouring of advanced technology on earth after Roswell's incident, which is explained due to knowledge gained through UFO wreckage. I personally disagree with the latter theory bacause as a human I strongly believe and trust in our own ingenuity.",1147132800,8,767,5.338842975206612
