5564551,4,B00B9LNOKM,i remember seeing this back when it was on and when i saw that amazon had the first three seasons on dvd from beginning to end. but i still wonder when the next season( digimon frontier)will be coming out and i also wonder if they are going to do this with digimon data squad because i thought it was a longer series.,1364342400,,317,4.129032258064516
5564552,5,B00B9LNOKM,"Just when I thought this set would be out after mine & my niece's birthday (August 27th to be exact, yes we have the same b-day a whole 25 years apart!), New Video Group has done it again with the 3rd season of Digimon; all 51 unedited American episodes/prints on an 8-disc set! I wonder if New Video Group's also planning a Movie Collection for the theatrical & TV Digimon movies so far, since the 3rd season's TV movies aren't here whatsoever. Such as the infamous Battle of Adventurers with Mephistomon & his V-pet cronies, and especially Runaway Locomon, where Rika's birthday was going sweet AND sour, sweet for her landmark one-hit wonder ""Promise"", and sour for Locomon and the Parasimon invasion. But I digress, how was the country (the USA at least) to know about the 9/11 attacks when the season was just kicking off here? In the 3rd season's realm, the 1st & 2nd seasons are only a TV show & franchise; yet ironically, Davis from season 2 was this season's narrator, just as Rika was for the majority of season 4! In this set, you'll find out about Guilmon's mischievous nature, Impmon's bully-like nature, Calumon's happy-go-lucky attitude, and much much more, as Takato, Henry & Rika's adventures with real Digimon & their human friends ultimately take them to the digi-world at last. Long-time digi-fans like me are a shoo-in for this set, TV movies or no. Believe it or not, the fella who gave original adult Furbies their voices (Tony Pope) also lent his voice to one of the 4 Sovereign; Zhuqiaomon, the ""overgrown canary"" or ""turkey"" described by Henry's Terriermon. Other voice acting jokes are in here as I recall, such as a mislead cop sounding like Foghorn Leghorn, Takato's teacher having a very familiar voice from seasons 1 & 2 AND Cartoon Network's Juniper Lee herself, a Divermon leader (of a bunch of Otamamon) who sounds like Bullwinkle J. Moose ""hisself"", a talkative Devidramon who also sounds familiar to an old FIEND, an Infermon from 100 DNA-digivolved Chrysalimon who sounds very much like the movie's original, one of the 12 Devas being played by Tai Kamiya's original (American) actor (Kumbhiramon the Rat Deva), and Impmon/Beelzemon himself who sounds similar to Harry the Wet/Sticky Bandit of Home Alone 1 & 2! Let's not forget that Ryo crossed dimensions with Ken years before this season took place, or what I call ""Censored nudity"" for Biomerge-digivolving, which got this season & #4 in hot water with older fans or the elders of younger fans. Censored nudity means that even though human characters are seen completely naked, you can't see anything inexplicable about them, ever! (It was like this in their original Japanese versions too) Fasten your seat belts, people; it's gonna be a another bumpy ride into reality (in this season's realm), with the DVD debut of Digimon's 3rd season!",1360713600,8,2831,4.875518672199171
5564553,5,B00B9LNOKM,"This is the greatest season of Digimon, with a very serious plot and darker undertone as the series goes on. I'd also like to point out the editorial review... pretty much completely inaccurate. This isn't Pokemon. It's a lot better. No ""Trainers"" (Ash) , no ""Rival Trainers"" (Gary), no trying to be the very best like no one ever was... no, it's about saving the world.

Edit: Eh, they ""Fixed"" the editorial review. It's still not quite right... but its a whole hell of a lot closer than ""Trainers catch creatures to battle them against rival trainers.""",1360281600,45,554,4.711340206185567

5564581,5,B00B9LNOKM,"A large number of people my age have fond memories of the Digimon series, mostly Digimon Adventure (1 and 2). However, there are a few, like myself, that prefer the third season of Digimon, known as Digimon Tamers. This show is perfect, as my friends and I have found, for parents that are looking for a show that they can enjoy alongside their children. I have to give credit where credit is due, as the localization, script writing, and direction for the show easily surpass other ""kid-directed"" anime. There is humor in the series that your kids may not understand, but you most certainly will. Its humor is what I'd consider sassy, as if much of the interaction between characters, especially early on in the show, involves everyone's dialogue and actions oozing with sarcasm and wit.

The show's messages involve a sincere coming of age story, where the Tamers (the Digidestined of this season) struggle to come out from under the control of their parents and strive for their own independence and the approval and support of their parents. Secondarily, it involves dealing with hardships that come with life and adulthood, as malicious intent and death are serious factors that affect the series in its second half. Additionally, the Tamers have to later deal with a renegade program that inadvertently went out of control and evolved sentience, subtly showing that actions have unintended consequences, especially from the creators of Digimon themselves. But ultimately, the series comes down to the adults attempting to fix their mistakes and ensure a good future for the next generation, while the kids themselves are fighting with their hearts and souls to make that future a reality. This is a plot setup and a theming that is really uncommon in kids shows today, teaching kids and parents simultaneously, as opposed to just kids or no one at all.

Overall, the show was MUCH better than I remember, though as someone who is used to buying anime on Blu-Ray and DVD, I was a little disappointed to find the lack of extra content, such as staff commentaries and the like, and just the lack of exceptional amounts of polish on the DVD menus in general. But don't let that stop you from buying the show, the deal of getting each episode for less than $1 is really worth it and for a show that you'll just watch by yourself or with kids it's easy to get to the content. It's really one of the most satisfying DVD purchases I've made for a long time.",1422576000,3,2455,4.747072599531616
5564582,5,B00B9LNOKM,What can I say tamers was one of the best season's followed by the first two  they don't make show's like this any more they don't even have Saturday morning toons anymore just sad I have this season and I'm showing it to my 10year old cousin he loves it and I do too good memories!,1422144000,,282,4.035714285714286
5564583,5,B00B9LNOKM,"Series Review
Digimon Tamers sets itself apart from the other Digimon series for a few key reasons, the most notable is the dark tone the series takes after episode 34: Lionheart. It's what defines Tamers for us fans, it's also the only Digimon series that did not have a happy ending.

While Adventure ended on a sad note as well, the Digidestined were reunited with their partners in Zero Two while in Zero Two the partners remained in the Real World for good. Frontier and Savers ended on happy notes as well. Tamers did not, Tamers' ending was bitter sweet. I won't spoil it for those that haven't seen the series, but the follow up drama cd: Message in the Packet (which was written by Konaka) closed the door forever on this series as well as the hopeful note the last episode gave us. The second Tamers movie was not canon as Konaka had no say in it.

Tamers also had a phenomenal dub with great voice acting and not as many jokes added like Adventure and Zero Two had. Anyways, onto the review for this dvd set:

DVD Set Review:
The image quality on these dvds is very sharp and vibrant, the only issue i really had with this set is the lack of subtitles and special features, especially since the VHS versions released almost 10 years ago had subs. Even something as simple as the clean opening and endings of the Japanese version would have been great.

I recommend this set to anyone that loves Digimon, especially if you're like me and have been waiting for this to come to DVD in a complete set.",1419379200,2,1508,4.433212996389892
5564594,5,B00B9LNOKM,Awesome.,1415404800,,8,8.0
5564595,5,B00B9LNOKM,"This season was really creative to me as a kid. I was weary because I was so hooked on the original storyline characters, but I really grew attached to this series.

At times, this series is more mature than the first two and it's as if each Digimon series matures with the kids who are watching it. Especially since the parents/adults are more involved in whats going on in this season. It's not just kids running around blindly.

This is a highly recommended season of Digimon that you won't want to miss. It stands alone from the first two seasons, so you can watch it as a stand alone:)",1410048000,2,590,4.4036697247706424
5564596,5,B00B9LNOKM,"The best of all of the seasons. This season really had the most realistic approach to a world where Digimon may be real. This is the english dub of the show, just as North American viewers watched them. Just a shame it does not contain the two animated movies.",1409702400,,260,4.326530612244898
5564597,5,B00B9LNOKM,Very good.,1407801600,,10,4.5
5564598,5,B00B9LNOKM,"I got one of these Sets from my Mom. But it turns out I can't enjoy it because I have a duplicate disc of 6. Disc 5 is not existent in my box set. It was rather upsetting. But the series is great. I'm going to see if I can have this worked out. Get another box set.... Or if they can ship me disc 5........ It is a downer. But the series is awesome, which I won't complain about.",1407715200,,379,3.75
5564599,5,B00B9LNOKM,"In my opinion this was the best season of Digimon. It had the most fleshed-out and nuanced characters, the best pacing, and was overall the most approachable (without sacrificing any of the action and sci-fi aspects that made the show popular). It also had a surprisingly dark and complicated plot compared to the other seasons, with excellent character development throughout. Remarkably well done for an anime clearly aimed at children.

This season was the first reboot of the show and it stands alone, meaning you don't need to watch the first two in order to get what's going on. That being said, in the world of Digimon season 3, Digimon seasons 1 and 2 was a cartoon show, so season 3 gets a little meta sometimes, rewarding folks who watched the first two with references and easter eggs. It's a minor aspect of the show that doesn't affect the plot at all, just a fun wink and nudge to fans.

Highly recommended.",1407024000,,921,4.679012345679013
5564600,5,B00B9LNOKM,I am a die hard digimon fan and this dvd set really helped relive some memories. This is a must have for any digimon fan who haven't watched the show in a good while,1403136000,,165,3.8823529411764706

5564602,5,B00B9LNOKM,"I remember watching this a long time ago, so long that Fox was still airing kid's programs.  It was digimon with a much darker theme, and it forever stood out in my mind as one of my favorite additions to the franchise.  And i was glad that Toei finally decided to release the compete season on DVD.  It was nostalgic and great seeing my childhood show again, and I enjoyed it greatly.  However there was severely lacking in special features, other than a few images of digimon there wasn't really anything else other than the episodes from the show.  And of course like all the other DVD packs they released, no Japanese audio, but despite all these minor hinderances, I was still able to enjoy reliving a beloved memory form my childhood, and if you're a fan of digimon this one is definitely worth your money.",1402099200,,812,4.534246575342466
5564603,5,B00B9LNOKM,"A lot of purists or elitists would argue with me not to watch this dubbed, but I've watched it in both Japanese and English, and while I will not argue that the Japanese dub is far superior, the English dub isn't as bad as people would make it out to be. This specific season of Digimon aired when I was 11, and more so than Adventures, Digimon Tamers taught me that life isn't always going to be happy. It's can be bitter and awful, and the people you love may do bad things for good reasons, or that the ones you love will die unjustly.

There's so many characters that are pure gold, and I honestly can't place one that I dislike. This season also had soooooo much mythology to it, which, admittedly, some can be lost in the dub, but you can still easily piece things together if you're really paying attention. Personally, I'd say give this a buy and a good watch through, and then pull up Netflix and give the original Japanese version a watching. Chances are you'll love both, maybe not equally, but for different reasons.

Or, if you're just into nostalgia, this title holds up.",1401667200,,1085,4.42

Digimon tamers is by far my favorite out of the series. Perfect balance of humor, action, and darkness. This series has made laugh and cry all in one episode. All the characters and relatable and have great development throughout the series.",1401408000,,405,4.785714285714286
5564626,5,B00B9LNOKM,This series is really good. The story is great and compelling. I'd recommend this to everyone who likes manga and anime.,1400889600,,120,4.761904761904762
5564627,5,B00B9LNOKM,"This season is definitely my favorite out of the whole Digimon saga.  The backstory and development behind the characters and villains seemed so much more complex, relative to the earlier Adventures Series (Seasons 1 and Season 2).  Yes, the dub still introduces unneeded dialogue and humor into the mix, but at least I was able to laugh at the jokes and quips.  One of the best things about this season is the fact that it actually started a trend where the chosen children/digidestined/tamers actually are involved in the battles!  Also, the D-Reaper and its origin are a little more original, compared to megalomaniac Digimon just trying to take over the world.  If you're going to get just one of the Digimon seasons, definitely consider this as one of your top picks.",1399334400,3,772,4.862595419847328

5564638,4,B00B9LNOKM,"This is definitely a DVD release that is long overdue for fans of the series. And personally, this is my favorite season of the franchise.

Keep in mind this is a dub-only release, with it being the exact version seen on Fox Kids all those years ago. So purists of the Japanese version will probably want to pass, though this is more than likely the only official release we'll see outside of Japan.

As for the series itself, like I said before, this is my favorite of the batch. It's still a kids' show, of course, but it's much darker in tone than the previous two seasons, with almost Matrix or even Evangelion vibes on occasion. It takes a little while to get really good, but if you can endure a few corny jokes here and there, I think even older viewers would find it as a decent watch.",1382918400,,793,4.315436241610739

I'd rather tell you some things that haven't been pointed out much yet.
The main problem I have with this is the English dub. Why is it bad?
1. The dialogues where changed and americanised. Some lines are so different I get the impression they didn't try to translate it, but instead thought about what might be appropriate at that moment.
2. The music of the original release as well as the German and Spanish dubs was amazing in all Digimon seasons, and the Japanese Tamers soundtrack is widely considered the best of all. Unfortunately, all English releases' music was not based on the great original soundtrack but created from scratch. It is so much worse that I won't even start comparing. Everyone who wants to can just look up the different versions of the Tamers opening, this will give you a pretty good idea.

It's too bad they didn't simply include Japanese audio and subs.",1378684800,,1094,4.697916666666667

5564647,5,B00B9LNOKM,"Where can I start?  For any fan of Digimon (who truly find Pokemon to be an irritating annoyance - ""pika pika!""), when you first looked at this third season on Fox Kids (years ago), you might've thought to yourself ""...this season's gonna suck.  Where's Davis and the crew?  Why couldn't they continue their grown-up adventures?  Where's Seraphimon (mega level of Patamon)?  How are they going to show his 'digivolution' on the movie, and not in the series?  Is this season gonna be any good?""  After seeing the first episode of the third season, you might've thought to yourself ""...hmm; not bad.  Very interesting concept.""  For Digimon - as far as the t.v. series goes - this season really was a game changer.  (spoiler alert) Real world application towards the storyline, making up a digimon from a drawing, the data absorption of the losing digimon's data into the winning digimon, the 'D-Reaper,' just about everything you thought you knew about the series changed...for the better.  For one, never did I think that a human partner / tamer of the digimon can fuse with their digimon to form a mega level digimon - Insane.  Then to have such an emotional storyline (ex: Jeri after the loss of her digimon, Leomon) and how Beelzemon (mega level of Impmon - his 'digivolution' from the rookie level came into effect with help from a 'Digimon Sovereign') took it so hard of what he did to her that he had an almost spiritual change from a bad, misguided fool into a good guy (you'll even see the difference in the color of his eyes and his outfit when that happens) which was really awesome.  Differences from the first and second seasons are drastic: how the characters had to travel to the digital world and how it looked, to how the data stream sweeps the characters away to a different area (placing them further away then where they were at) - the original concept is re-tooled, but the results are satisfying, nonetheless.  If you decide to get this season, you won't be disapointed.  I'm a fan of Digimon, so I knew this was brought as soon as I saw it on sale (especially since I had to wait until becoming a family man to get this series - my wife looks at me looking at this, and shakes her head, talking about ""a grown-tail man looking at Digimon.""  I told her it's not my fault that 'the peoples' had to wait so long to release this season on DVD)!  It's up to you, but if you're in the mood to experience some good storytelling, purchase this DVD set.",1376524800,2,2466,4.555555555555555
5564648,5,B00B9LNOKM,"I watched this show as a child and remembered enjoying most of it, though not as much as the first two seasons. After going back and watching it years later, I enjoyed it much more. Funny how that worked, but I gotta admit it was a fun show to watch again.",1376524800,,256,4.03921568627451
5564649,5,B00B9LNOKM,"This is by far the best season of the digimon saga. I can not explain how truly better this season is compared to the others, it has more details, and layers, and it has so much more depth to it. Loved the first two seasons, this is just amazing.",1376352000,,246,4.040816326530612
5564650,5,B00B9LNOKM,"I was really surprised to see this out so soon after the first 2 seasons were put out, but I won't complain.

This season is a lot darker than the previous two. I say this not to scare anyone away from purchasing this season. In fact, this season, though it is darker, has a greater storyline. There is turmoil among the characters and their lives with family. This season does something that the other 2 seasons didn't really do, which is provide more character development than what viewers are accustomed. The first 2 seasons sugarcoated things unlike this season. I can even see where some of the characters, mainly the D'Reaper, could scare little kids. Even some death scenes are intense where some kids might shed a tear. Yes, I know, this is a kids cartoon, but it really is that moving.

So if you want a storyline that will challenge you and make you want to keep on watching, this season is the one to get.",1376179200,,917,4.485029940119761
5564651,5,B00B9LNOKM,"This season of Digimon has a depth on par with the ocean trenches. It also has a pretty accurate portrayal of a person with depression by showing what they go through, the negative thoughts that consume them, etc. It also shows different types of friendships, such as the close friendship between Takato and Guilmon, the sibling-like relationship between Henry and Terriermon, and the seemingly-cold, but actually very complicated and loving friendship between Rika and Renamon. It's fun to watch. I love it the same now as I did when I was 8. So, if you're looking to relive your childhood (English version, yes), then this is what you're looking for. If you're someone who likes watching anime and is looking for a new show to watch, this season of Digimon will do it. It is separate from the other seasons, so you don't need to watch them to understand this one. I highly recommend it.",1376179200,2,888,4.735483870967742

I bought the three volumes. :/ ), but it was released along with the second season of the show as well. The first season took almost 6-8 months to release the full thing, but I was very pleased to buy the entire season for one low price. Totally worth the money spent. It is 19 hrs long! Talk about worth the money. Most movies will cost almost as much for one-tenth of the length of this season. Buy it. This is what cartoons used to be like. Very family friendly.

Now with something I watched as a child, it is normal to fear that watching it now would ruin the memories (corny jokes, childish themes, etc) but that wasn't the case at all.

Slip case comes shiny which is pretty cool, as usual we get an art book with bios about the Digimon and tamers. It's cool that they changed the Digimon logo on the cover to match the Japanese version, but what's the point when we still have the logo they used for season 3 in the intro and ending credits. I wish they would contain the original Japanese intros and endings as extras. I only watched the Fox Kids version while growing up, so this is the set I've been waiting for. Buy it, and don't miss an AMAZING season. Enjoy!",1371686400,,659,4.15625

5564667,5,B00B9LNOKM,"I'm still pretty new to Digimon, so this isn't an expert review. While I was watching the Season 1 boxset, I was also watching this season on Youtube and I liked the Tamers season a lot better because:
- It's just an awesome season to begin with.
- The digimon are way cooler (even the rookie forms were kick-a)
- The characters are actually likable, and they have more complex personalities.
- It doesn't have the stupid puns, and this show still has its funny moments (gotta love Terriermon)
- At the same time, this season has its very serious and dark moments.
- The life lessons that come with the show. Example: The saddest people around are most likely hiding their feelings behind a huge smile.

This has to be my favorite season so far (I have yet to watch the other seasons), so when I saw that Tamers was going to be released on DVD, I had to get it. I know I'm being nitpicky but I didn't like that it had the rating square in the beginning of some of the episodes; it made me feel like I was watching it straight from the TV, not watching a DVD.
By the way, the cover/shell thing is really shiny.",1370908800,7,1109,4.2559241706161135
5564668,5,B00B9LNOKM,"Well, I got mine in the mail a day early. I was sorta expecting it to come a day or two late since Prestige was handling it, but this was a pleasant surprise, unlike the DVD which was what I expected it to be. Don't get me wrong, I am absolutely grateful they even released it, but it terms of how they DVD itself is setup, it's identical to the release of Digimon Season 1. Eight discs each sporting a menu proceeded by a part of the season' opening, in which the only option is to play all or watch an individual episode, with the exception of the last disc which has some artwork. It would have been nice if the original Japanese version was included as well as a making of or retrospective feature, but these are more suggestions than complaints. I'm fine with the English dub having grown up watching The Movie. The video quality itself looks quite clean and crisp. So while the features of the DVD set are indeed simplistic, I'd say it was worth my money. The DVD itself is more of a 3.5/5, but it is the first DVD release of DIGIMON TAMERS, so it gets a solid 5/5.",1370822400,2,1071,4.229268292682927

Love Digimon Tamers!",1369699200,,337,3.9705882352941178
5564670,5,B00B9LNOKM,"Digimon Adventure (season one) was the series that got me into anime. I was, to say the very least, skeptical when I first heard of season three since this broke away with the characters and established formula of the previous two seasons. I was prepared to hate it.

But then, I watched it and...actually liked it. A lot. After the fifteenth or so episode, I was hooked. By the end of its run, I actually cried.

Like what a few reviewers already mentioned, this show did a good job of rounding out all the characters in this. And I do mean all. Unlike in the previous two seasons where the Digimon were near carbon copies in personality to their partner, the Digimon have their own desires and thoughts that are a bit more independent to their tamer. In other words, the partnerships are actually real partnerships. Without spoiling the later plots, both Tamer and Digimon will need to work as one to defeat the enemy.

On that note, this show actually has adult characters. Normally in this genre of anime, the parents are, at best, on the sidelines...if they ever even find out about their kids' side jobs at all. And the adults' role in the story plays a huge role.

The plots are well above most anything that usually targets this age group...there's angst, there's loss, there's joy. Problems are not always resolved by the end of the episode, and some things will never be fixed. None of it is sugarcoated, yet it remains age-appropriate.

Overall, I'd highly recommend this as a good introduction series into anime for a kid between seven and twelve, but most people who are older will be able to enjoy it too. And if anyone skipped this when it was on the air (or the rest of Digimon) because it seemed too much like Pokemon...it's similar in title only. Give this one a shot.",1367884800,5,1786,4.56875
5564671,4,B00B9LNOKM,"The reason I gave this 4 stars is because the Japanese version is not included in this release. It was a good dub, alot less edits then what 4kids would have done, but still, there were some annoying edits. For example: While some of the characters still have Japanese names, they were changed. Hirokazu is now Kazu, Ruki is now Rika. There were also some major edits like when Beelzemon was kicking Megidramon, in the Japanese version it was much more intense, all leading up to when he broke his chest plate. Two other key edits was when Gargomon was out of control and renamon jumped on top of him to try to knock him down, they cut out the part where she clawed his eyes by accident. Although you can still see the wounds in the scenes. Then there was the part where Gargomon turned to face Ruki, originally he had his gun pointed at her. I personally think these edits were pointless, just to appease whiny over protective parents.",1365897600,7,936,4.47953216374269
5564672,5,B00B9LNOKM,"The reason why I rate this is because, just like the other Digimon series and other good tv shows, this was what made the digimon cool. I liked how the digidestined used their trading cards to give their partners a power boost. This show is definitely worth watching.",1365292800,3,267,4.583333333333333
5564673,5,B00B9LNOKM,"I'm not a man who uses hyperbole or constantly changes his mind about his favorite stuff. Digimon Tamers is the best anime made for children. I say this with conviction and honesty. The English dub is flawed, but does well enough in keeping with the tone and spirit of the original that kids will have no problem with it, and if you simply prefer English-dubbed anime to subtitled anime, this will service you just fine.

There are three main factors that make Digimon Tamers the perfect kid's show that still appeals to older audiences:

-Relatable and fleshed-out characters. The three main leads, Takato, Rika, and Henry, all have distinct personalities that can easily become iconic to fans of the show, but are also more flawed, nuanced, and developed than most shows period, made for kids or not. While each one is dealing with their high-stakes Digital adventure (compelling enough to make a good show by itself), their personal life and all the conflict that comes with it doesn't go away. This creates a lot of character drama that can be deeply appreciated by an older audience without detracting from the epic Digimon quest or the simple Shy Guy/Tough Girl/Cool Guy trio that kids love. In fact, because the characters all have problems that kids can relate to, this helps them resonate more with the intended audience, and watching the characters work through their problems can be both helpful and comforting to kids. And all of this is accomplished without being preachy or devolving into Pokmon-style ""lesson of the week"" episodes.

-The Digimon. This series has some of the fandom's favorite Digimon among the main cast, including Guilmon, Renamon, Terriermon, Impmon, and Calumon. They range from cute to awesome, sometimes with the same Digimon, as is the case with Guilmon. This is an obvious bonus for kids, but you may be asking what the 18-35 demographic gains from this. The answer is simple: the Digimon themselves are every bit as well-developed as the humans. Each one has a character arc that is both separate from and complimentary to their human partner's. One Digimon in particular, not spoiling who, has one of the best Fall and Redemption stories ever put to animation.

-The darkness. Digimon Tamers is, to put it bluntly, a disturbing story at times. It is still kid-appropriate, mind you; There's no gore, sex, or swearing, but the actual content of the show often deals with some pretty heavy subject matter, most of which kids can relate to, yet kid's entertainment rarely deals with. Some of the kids are outcasts, some of the parents are divorced or abusive, some people die and it deeply affects the people around them. Lots of kids deal with these kinds of things, but most kid's shows don't seem to be willing to explore these issues. Digimon Tamers does so, and it does so honestly. Easy answers are not given. No ""just be yourself and people will like you"" or "" just think about how happy you were when he was alive."" This is all really relatable to practically everyone, child and adult alike.

My final word is that Digimon Tamers has it all. Action, characters, drama, you name it. It's presented in a way that can both entertain and help children, and remains perfectly accessible to older fans. Whether or not you grew up with Digimon, I highly recommend you check out Digimon Tamers.",1364774400,56,3333,4.840350877192982
