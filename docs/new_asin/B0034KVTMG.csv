4068924,2,B0034KVTMG,"Made by ultra-low budget filmmaker ""Bill Zebub"" over five days in New Jersey for a budget of reportedly around $4,000, ""Night of the Pumpkin"" delivers exactly the level of quality schlock you'd expect for the price. I love low budget independent films, and if you've seen a Zebub film before you know what to expect. There is no question that the production is extremely cheap and amateurish, but for fans of ludicrously bad comedic horror, this could be an amusing film to watch once. Rating this is tough: it's obviously terrible, is poorly acted, has a ludicrous premise (which I would argue is the main element of charm it has going for it,) and extremely bad special effects. Everything's gratuitous, and the internal conflicts in the film don't work, which is interesting inasmuch as Zebub says in the ""Making of"" piece that the whole film is supposedly driven by group dynamics. I see how he intended that to be the case but few will appreciate that, and even fewer will critically watch for that element. Most people are watching this for the pretty girls (which are abundant, with the girl dressed in the vine being the prettiest) and the ridiculous pumpkin monster.

The film opens with pretty babes playing Frisbee to some death metal by ""My Dying Bride"" and rapidly shifts to some of the worst acting ever filmed in a library. There's an amazing amount of ponderous debate about religion versus atheism by women on a sofa (it's hard to imagine a more boring exploitation movie.) Meanwhile, Barbara (Angelina Leigh) takes a shower and her boyfriend Peter is eaten by the pumpkin monster, prompting a painful discussion about ""Pumpkin, pumpkin the Peter eater."" (Who didn't see that coming?) There are scads of blown lines (just leave them in!) and all I can really recall about the middle third of the film is that it features the worst group of actresses on a sofa in history, featuring both the worst theological debate ever and the silliest global warming subplot in the last few days. What could follow that? A subplot about a witch in the apartment next door and local noise ordinances, perhaps? Brilliant! (If the inductive reasoning scene on the sofa seems ponderous, just you wait until the kitchenette witch interrogation scene!)

Eventually the pumpkin monster plot truly swings into gear, and not a moment too soon. There is some interesting use of vines (which Zebub has interesting insights into during the ""Making of"" feature) and it turns out that the pumpkin monster is really just mad because of what humans are doing to the environment. I enjoyed the ""Making of"" feature more than the movie itself, and Zebub correctly identifies a flaw in the film, namely that it's too dialogue driven rather than action driven; I think he explains his thought process well and understands the problems with the movie. He has more talent than the budget, script, and shooting schedule can represent well. (If he ever gets to express himself with a better funded vehicle, it could be quite scary or at least entertaining.) He also makes some claims that you might expect him to steer clear of (e.g. he claims the day for night photography, which is the worst I have ever seen, was intended to look this way....)

The film obviously has some negatives (and I was pleased that Zebub fondly owned up to them,) but the conclusion involving music to ""soothe the savage beast"" and a most amusing use of defensive poetry leading to the wonderful finale were hugely entertaining to me, and I thought were the best executed components of the film: I won't reveal how the film ends, but the last five minutes of the film were by far the best for a variety of reasons.

The DVD has several extras, chief among them a feature of Zebub explaining his directorial choices. He seems like a clever guy with a lot of understanding of cinema (despite the preconceptions this film might engender,) although he does tend to ramble about pumpkin spores and group dynamics a bit. My favorite extra (easily) is a truly offbeat cartoon called ""Painful Meow"" which while truly disturbed and suffering from severe rhythm impairment, is hugely entertaining and indescribable.

""Night of the Pumpkin"" is not high art (which Zebub makes no secret of) and is at times ponderous and tediously unscary, but Bill Zebub fans won't be disappointed. While Zebub explains this as a comedy, I look on it as a satirical comedic horror movie targeted squarely at those who truly love grade-Z low budget films. It's not always successful, but it definitely puts a weird new twist on the nature-gone-amok environmentalist cinematic wasteland.",1320969600,13,4613,4.863867684478372
4068925,3,B0034KVTMG,Ok folks I am giving this one three stars too many I think. I am giving it three stars mainly for the awesome pumpkin costume that was made for this movie. It would have been better if they would have made this more of a horror movie rather than a comedy. It's pretty stupid. Straight men will love this movie for all the pussy and boobs. Tons of full frontal nudity with the women...I actually sat through the whole thing but not sure i could get through this one again...it just wasn't my type of movie- it was strange..,1314921600,4,522,4.282828282828283
4068926,2,B0034KVTMG,"If you like Bill Zebubs movies, you have a problem to begin with. However this is probably one HIS best movies. But the victims in the story are so idiotic, that I found myself rooting for the Pumpkin man!! Lots of Nudity (Typical Zebub) and some gratuidous violence. Very Poor Special effects. You'll find yourself watching the entire movie not for entertainment, but just to see if it could possibly get any more idiotic and it does. The Special feature commentary by Bill Zebub was better than the movie. It has some funny moments and it's definately campy. It's like watching the old sexploitation films of the 70's at the Drive-in. If you like this type of movie, you'll love this one. If you are plot oriented, don't waste your time with this one. It is what it is...a Typical Bill Zebub flic with a not so typical ending. Pure Idiocy!!",1281916800,9,842,4.582781456953643
4068957,5,B0034KVTMG,"Bill Zeebub is one of my very guilty pleasures.  His movies are hilarious but also a great inspiration to other true indie filmmakers.  A couple of hand held cameras and a cheezy script and zero budget goes a long way when you don't take yourself serious as Bill doesn't.  Do what you want and don't worry about what others think or what the end result will be.  Have fun making your movie! He makes the movies he would watch.  He makes the movies I like to watch.  If you try to find redeeming qualities in Bill's movies you will fail, they do not exist.  Sit back and have fun.",1396828800,,579,4.256880733944954
4068958,4,B0034KVTMG,"I love movies that relish in the fact that they know they are crap. This is one of those movies. It keeps you interested by using terrible special effects and gratuitous nudity. A little too much dialogue that goes nowhere, but it can be forgiven. A good Bill Zebub effort, but not up there with, say, ZombieChrist.",1394928000,5,315,4.543859649122807
4068959,4,B0034KVTMG,The dialogue on the movie is both entertaining and surprising.  Some of the props are low budget but the acting is refreshing.,1390867200,,126,4.7272727272727275
4068960,3,B0034KVTMG,"What you can expect from this film:

1. Laughs, both intentional (Bill Zebub himself has very good comic timing) and unintentional.
2. Some incredibly hot naked actresses.
3. Some of the cheapest home-made props and FX that you'll ever see in a movie.
4. Ridiculous, overwritten exposition that bogs down the entire production and makes it almost unwatchable in parts.

The first three points make ""Night of the Pumpkin"" great. With a title like that  you'd better expect nonsense, and you get  it here in spades. Most everybody  seems to be in on the joke, even though for the most part they're playing seriously.

The fourth point is what makes it bad. Not that you're looking for a plot summary here, but  basically it goes like this: A pumpkin plant comes to life and starts enacting revenge by killing some people, although it's never exactly explained what the revenge is for or  why it's going after these people particularly. And then there's also a crazy murdering rapist who shows up trying to blame his crimes on the pumpkin.

I wish that the movie had made it that succinct. Instead we've got two hours of screen time that gets more bogged down in exposition than a European art-house film from  1993. Seriously, I don't know that I've ever seen another movie with more unbroken monologue/dialogue. Not what you'd expect from a movie that also has some of the hottest naked actresses that I've ever seen on screen.

Zebub should have cut the screen time down by an hour,  dropping all of that dialogue and leaving in all of the nudity (maybe even adding some because a couple of these chicks never  get naked, and when seeing it you'll wish that they had). In a wonderful 30-minute behind-the-scenes feature he essentially admits that himself; he says that the exposition was an experiment that failed. You have to lend it to the guy for trying I guess. Also he seems  far more likable and funny than you'd expect from a dude who calls himself ""Bill Zebub.""

I know that Zebub's reputation is to make horribly offensive movies, but don't expect that from ""Night of the Pumpkin."" The most disturbing thing here probably is the soundtrack,  which I had to mute in parts because death metal doesn't exactly lend itself to light afternoon viewing. The ""rape"" scenes are only suggested, with no physical contact, to the point that I wasn't even sure that that's what was being implied. Looked instead more just like a hot naked woman's rolling around in the grass alone.

Did I mention that the actresses are scorching hot? Without a doubt, some of the best-looking women I've ever seen on screen together, and these are normal, natural women too...clearly Bill Zebub shares my tastes and likes big breasts but doesn't like breast implants. Good viewing angles and good lighting too.

If you're looking for something kind of dumb to watch with some friends over a bowl of popcorn, this might actually be worth your while. I'd have given it four stars without the lengthy dialogue.",1382832000,7,2987,4.766990291262136
4068961,2,B0034KVTMG,"I normally like b movies and even some really bad movies simply because sometimes they have to make do with what they have, so I appreciate the effort.  This movie however didn't seem to try very hard.  the cast tried (maybe to hard) to get into the act but fell a bit short.  nudity was pointless but at least the girls were cute.",1380153600,,331,4.222222222222222
4068962,4,B0034KVTMG,"For all the naysayers, you just don't get it. B-movie horror flicks are amateurish take-offs on mainstream movies. They TRY to look professional and they often fail. Bill Zebub does take-offs on B-movies, take-offs on take-offs, and he doesn't even try to look professional. That's his whole schtick! This is Three Stooges with fake blood and boobs. Lighten up, crack open a brew, sit back, and laugh.

I rated this higher earlier, but the ending just stuck with me. I watched it again and it was WAY too serious for Bill. The last several minutes fit with the way the character was portrayed, but from a viewer standpoint it was lame.",1379980800,2,635,4.7207207207207205
4068963,1,B0034KVTMG,"This DVD is hands down the worst thing I have ever seen. First, it borders on porn with it's gratuitous and unexpected full on nudity. Not nudity for the sake of art, but nudity for nudity's sake. I wasn't prepared for that, and quite frankly, didn't need it.

Other than that, the story, writing, acting and ""special"" effects were deplorable. I have seen better productions on stage of a high school theatre.

Stay away from this garbage. A total waste of $$!",1376870400,,460,4.597560975609756

4068965,1,B0034KVTMG,Worst B horror ever! I started watching this and shut it off after5 minutes.  Its the cheesiest mock porn I have ever seen.  It seems this guy just needs an excuse to get close to pretty young girls.,1372118400,,199,4.2105263157894735
4068966,1,B0034KVTMG,"Geez Louise. What can I say about this sorry excuse for a movie? I've seen better acting from strung out porn stars. To give any of the ""actors"" a razzy would be insulting to the razzies. They would flub their lines but keep  going and the director- if there was one- wouldn't cut. Not that a second take would've been any better if the first was any indication. And by the way, in a movie, a naked annoying chick is just as bad, if not worse, than a fully clothed one. Nudity and fake blood alone does not a good horror movie make.",1350864000,3,532,4.165048543689321

8388464,5,B0034KVTMG,"Wow! Haven't seen anything like this since the early days of John Baccus. This is a nice pairing of sex and horror. The women are beautiful in a very girl next door sort of way. I'm glad they are not shy about showing off their gorgeous bodies. The Horror is very suspenseful in a Hitchcock sort of way, the low budget which actually adds to the eerie of the mood.

It's been a long time since I have since an indie movie of this quality, keep them coming Bill Zebub.
