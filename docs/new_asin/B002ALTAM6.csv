8359798,5,B002ALTAM6,"I have three kids... 2, 5, & 13.  My two little ones (one boy, one girl) love to watch Captain Macaroni.  They get captivated everytime its on.  I love all of the references to scripture throughout, and the highly entertaining plot & storyline.  This is an excellent program and is very high-quality.  You won't be dissappointed and parents won't be annoyed after watching it a couple of times!

Highly recommended!",1244592000,,415,4.857142857142857
8359799,5,B002ALTAM6,"My 8 year old son, 7 year old stepson, and 5 year old daughter are glued to this. It is the most beautiful and profound, zany, and unbelievably funny cartoon I have ever watched with the kids. It has such a great message and I can't wait to see more! I hope it becomes a series fast! I know it will be, because it is just that good! BUY IT NOW!",1244160000,,344,3.859154929577465
8359800,5,B002ALTAM6,"My 5 and 9 year olds both enjoyed this movie.  The younger one wanting to watch it over and over.  They found the jokes and pie-throwing so funny, and Mom found it a nice break from the cartoon violence and smart-alecky remarks found on so many kids shows nowadays.  Captain Mac is a good choice for the whole family.",1243900800,,317,4.338983050847458
