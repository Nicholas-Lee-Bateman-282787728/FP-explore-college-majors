8171652,5,B000M5N7JO,"I mainly got this package for the DVD portion, cause anything DVD on t. A.T.u. is a must have. I love t. A.T.u.'s ""Screaming For More"" DVD as it covered there first album ""200 km/h In The Wrong Lane"", and now this DVD covers t. A.T.u.'s second album ""Dangerous And Moving"". This DVD adds a little more compared to ""Screaming For More"". You get a 20 minute concert performance titled ""Glam As You"" performed in Paris, France. The songs performed are ""All About Us"", ""Not Gonna Get Us"", ""Obezyanka Nol"", ""Loves Me Not"", and ""All The Things She Said"". You get the new videos ""Gomenasai"" (in both regular and animated versions), ""Ludi Invalidi"", ""All About Us"" (in both clean and explicit versions), and ""Friend Or Foe"". You also get an old video ""How Soon Is Now?"". The remix videos are ""All The Things She Said"", ""Not Gonna Get Us"", ""All About Us"", and ""Friend Or Foe"". The Making Of's are ""All About Us"", ""Friend Or Foe"", and ""Gomenasai"". And finally there are t. A.T.u. TV spots. So is much more on this DVD and a great companion to ""Screaming For More"".",1337040000,,1054,4.523560209424084
