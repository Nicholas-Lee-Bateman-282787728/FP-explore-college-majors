8382519,5,B002VSCADO,"This is a film I've seen before, but this DVD is the first time I've seen it in wide-screen. It's a typical 60's teen/beach film, with songs and romance, but I find it lots of fun. Especially being a John Leyton fan, it's wonderful to see him singing and acting. It takes place at a summer ""holiday camp"" in England, with, as one of the characters puts it, ""Food, fun and fellas"". No, it's not great art, but it is entertaining. If you like the Annette and Frankie movies, consider this similar but with an English accent.",1382227200,3,522,4.391752577319588
