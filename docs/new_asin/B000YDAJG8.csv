He makes mistakes (I suppose they didn't have rewind available to re-record, or maybe he just couldn't play the examples)

No depth to what is being done.

When he does *try* to explain, he is often wrong (how could anyone believe the pinch harmonic is done with the index finger?  You have to feel the string stop on your thumb, even if you are brain dead)

Save your money for just about anything else.  Anything from Lick Library would be my suggestion, now those guys know more than how to create a glossy cover.",1277251200,,556,4.455445544554456
