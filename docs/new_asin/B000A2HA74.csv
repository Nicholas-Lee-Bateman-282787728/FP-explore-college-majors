8072511,5,B000A2HA74,"This is a fabulous DVD!  I have been belly dancing for over a decade. I took a two-hour salsa belly dance fusion workshop with a Spanish speaking teacher, and I was hooked! So I purchased this DVD a few years back to add a little salsa into my belly dance.  My fellow dancer and I then choreographed a salsa belly dance fusion number we called Prickly Pear (after the song we chose), taking inspiration from our workshop and this DVD.  I highly recommend it.",1408233600,,458,4.428571428571429
8072512,4,B000A2HA74,"Style = LA fusion

level = absolute beginners

The instruction is fairly standard.

A fair amount of time is taken up by performances by the very sexy dance group rather than teaching but the performances are all very good.

The music is excellent.

The dvd gives the feeling the teachers are actors rather than teachers but it is a good video.

I feel it is more suited to those who are performance begginers rather than those who want a full out instrution video.",1164412800,9,465,4.542168674698795
