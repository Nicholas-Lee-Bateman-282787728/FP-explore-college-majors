I remember plopping myself down in front of the TV after school when I was about 8 or 9 and watching this show. And it's pretty darn good! Basically, the cartoon show continues from where the 1995 Casper movie left off. Casper the Friendly Ghost lives in Whipstaff Manor, a spooky old house in Maine, with his three rude uncles, The Ghostly Trio, and his human friends Dr. Harvey and Kat. Joining the cast from the movie are bunches of other characters, some old (like Spooky, Casper's cousin, from the original Harvey Toons), and new (Mrs. Banshee, Casper's ghostly teacher). This show showcases cynical 90s cartoon humor at it's best, and created by some of the folks who not only worked on the movie, but other Silver Age cartoons like Tiny Toons and Animaniacs. If you liked those shows, you're definitely going to like this one. And, hey, it won a Daytime Emmy Award and was one of the most popular shows during it's run, so it's gotta be good!

Onto the DVD review: the DVD the cartoons came in definitely could have been nicer, but for all purposes (and obviously since there really isn't a big market for putting out Casper DVDs these days) it's fine. I bought my copy from one of the Amazon Marketplace sellers, since I really don't think that the DVD is worth $12 for just 5 episodes. But I'm not going to tack off points just for those two factors. The presentation is simple but fine, and the episode choices were a good mix to start off this series of DVDs with.

Overall: BUY THIS DVD! It's frighteningly fun for kids (and big kids, too!) of all ages.",1222732800,4,1639,4.533783783783784
8208427,1,B000TAPC90,"I will admit that I am not familiar with Casper the Ghost, but I have a three-year-old who loves ghosts and thought this looked like a fun and innocent dvd for him to watch as Halloween approaches.  The humor was completely inappropriate for his age, and I turned it off only a few minutes in.  I suppose that older kids may enjoy if, but I wouldn't recommend it since I found the humor so crude and ridiculous.  I guess if you find belching ghosts and snotty teen-age girls funny/enjoyable to watch, go for it.",1193184000,2,511,4.414893617021277
