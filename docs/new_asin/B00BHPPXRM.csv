8568673,5,B00BHPPXRM,Love the fun Cliff and the Shadows have with each other; they perfectly complement each other.  Great music -- an all-time favorite DVD for me.,1498089600,,143,4.72
8568674,5,B00BHPPXRM,"I have the other ""Reunited 50th Anniversary DVD (2009) which I loved so much that when I saw that this was a ""Platinum"" edition, I ordered it immediately.  Unfortunately, this  DVD disc (Platinum) could not play back in any of my DVD players (2 Blu-ray and 1 regular).  I assumed that the disc was Region 1 since there was no indication on the  site that it was anything else.  I gave this 5 stars because I own the 2009 version of this concert and the concert itself deserved 5 stars.  The Platinum Edition packaging was great with pictures of Cliff R. and the Shadows practicing for this concert.  The page where the DVD is located was packed so tightly that I had a hard time removing the disc from its page.  In removing it, I accidentally tore a little portion on the right side so that I could remove the disc from its location.  I was going to return this platinum edition for a refund and then thought about it and decided that I was going to keep it anyway as a souvenir because  the packaging featured biographies of Cliff & the Shadows, pictures of practice sessions, etc. which were not featured in the 2009 DVD version.  I would like to request, however, that if the DVD being sold is not a ""Region 1"" or ""All Regions"", please indicate it on the site (some sellers do this already).  It will be a great help for those living in the U.S.",1495497600,2,1349,4.352
