7978999,5,B0000844KR,"This is an amazing series with an imaginative re-telling of Alexander the Great, with highly stylized artwork. This comes from the same artist (Peter Chung) that brought us Aeon Flux. If you're a fan of that series or animation in general, i highly recommend getting this set.",1410566400,,276,4.8936170212765955

7979003,4,B0000844KR,"Anyone who has seen Aeon Flux will automatically know the inimitable style this story is painted across the screen.  This is an uncompromising story, full of hard sharp edges where massive personalities clash as Alexander fulfills his destiny.  There are many versions of Alexander the Great.  This one brings him to life in (what to me is) a cyberpunk atmosphere.  An entertaining video and one that might bring the story to life for teenagers more than adults.",1249862400,,462,4.961038961038961
7979004,5,B0000844KR,"Reign continues to deliver stunning visuals, surreal characters, and a brilliantly re-imagined view of the classical world.
This second installment however suffers slightly from the change in voice acting.  Though the voice actors are retained, a clear change has been implemented to the performance for Aristotle.  Perhaps the concern was that he sounded too much like Trevor Goodchild, but personally I felt that the change made him seem less contemplative, and further that if Breens were to do an Alexander Play, Trevor would probably portray this role himself anyway.  I still like Reign, but I'm more a fan of Aristotle in the first DVD.",1183939200,,643,5.163461538461538
