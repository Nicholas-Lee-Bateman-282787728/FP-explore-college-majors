8092033,4,B000BT96KA,"I LOVE the Golden Age DVD series but I was very disappointed with the first 2 programs on this DVD.  Let It Rain was really boring and the acting was mediocre and dull.  Feather Top was so silly that I only watched about 5 minutes of it.  Then came the wonderful programs that made this DVD well worth buying.  The Golden Key was a wonderful bitter sweet story about a man who is down on his luck.  Joe E. Brown played this part to perfection and you will weep for him and cheer for his successes.  The Honest Man is a treasure with Jack Benny at his best starring with Charles Bronson and Zsa Zsa Gabor.  He has to be the funniest ""honest"" man you've ever seen.  The only thing missing here is Rochester!  You won't regret buying this DVD after you've seen the last 2 programs!",1358726400,,778,4.238095238095238
8092034,4,B000BT96KA,"All four half-hour dramas in Volume #1 of TV GOLDEN AGE THEATER are from season #4 of ""General Electric Theater."" This show aired for 10 seasons (from 2/1/53 to 9/1/62) on the CBS network and was hosted by Ronald Reagan, who also appeared occasionally as part of an episode's cast.

SYNOPSES--

FEATHERTOP-- Adapted from a Nathaniel Hawthorne tale set in 1600's New England of a scarecrow that magically comes to life.

THE GOLDEN KEY-- An elderly, retired railroader develops a friendship with a young boy. This one has an interesting supporting cast. Kenny Delmar portrayed Senator Claghorn on radio in the ""Allen's Alley"" segment of ""The Fred Allen Show."" Mel Blanc adapted Delmar's Southern accent and voice for the Foghorn Leghorn rooster cartoons produced by WARNER's. Van Dyke Parks (a small boy here) is best known for his musical collaborations in the late 1960s with Beach Boy Brian Wilson. Their ""Heroes and Villains"" was a Top 40 hit in 1968.

THE HONEST MAN-- A piano tuner gets caught up with fast women, gangsters and stolen jewels.

LET IT RAIN-- A ghost story set in a small Southern town that well recalls its Civil War past.

8092035,3,B000BT96KA,"Four classic episodes from GENERAL ELECTRIC THEATER, the long-running anthology series hosted by Ronald Reagan. ""General Electric Theater"" ran between 1953-1962, but did not become hugely popular until Reagan took over as the host, beginning the second season in 1954. The show was alternately broadcast from New York and Hollywood, boasting a galaxy of stars from stage and screen, in adaptations of short stories and novellas, as well as original screenplays.

""Let It Rain"" - Ronald Reagan and Cloris Leachman star in this tale of a writer who finds romance in a sleepy Southern town, haunted by the spirits of the Civil War.

""Feather Top"" - Natalie Wood stars in a tale about a scarecrow (Carleton Carpenter) who comes magically to life. Based on the story by Nathaniel Hawthorne.

""The Golden Key"" - The comedian Joe E. Brown in a rare dramatic turn, as a retired railroad worker whose friendship with a young boy changes his life.

""The Honest Man"" - Jack Benny, Zsa Zsa Gabor and Charles Bronson in the zany story of a piano tuner who gets mixed up in a world of shady gangsters and pilfered jewels.
