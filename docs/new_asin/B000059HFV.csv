1405435,1,B000059HFV,"I'm sorry, folks, but I've never considered TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL to be uplifting or inspiring. It always seems to succeed in depressing me during the handful of times I've viewed it. It's likely due to the fact that just about every third episode in the series deals with death and/or dying, and learning how to cope and come to terms with it. Of course, when the Angel of Death is part of the regular cast, I suppose it's to be expected. But still, with the frequency that the 'dying & coping' theme keeps getting rehashed, how can you NOT expect to feel down in the dumps after a while?
The two episodes in this collection are a case in point. The pilot has Monica trying to help a child come to terms with the ""death"" of his mother-but the show ends up being about another death entirely. The 100th eppie features a kid about to kick from cystic fibrosis. He's a real trouper throughout the whole ordeal; it's his mom who needs working on, however. Yep, that's right- she's gotta be shown how to deal with her kids' impending doom! How'd'ja guess? It ends with WYNONNA singing to him and his mom in their front yard, surrounded by all the friendly neighbors as he passes away. Sheesh- what a total downer. I haven't been this depressed since Chris Farley killed himself...
If you want to check out an angel show that doesn't try to repeat a certain theme over & over again, you need look no further than ""Highway to Heaven"". Sure, it was rife with its silly moments and had a few less-than-happy episodes, but not nearly in the spades that TBAA piles on. Now go ye forth and be happy!

1405436,5,B000059HFV,"First I would like to say Love can conquer all! To me this episode was the best I have ever seen frm all the Touch by the Angel series..This was the first time Wynonna performed and I think the message of a mom trying to deal with a huge issue of seeing and knowing her son was going to die anytime was pretty strong and brave..This episode should be an inspiration to all those who find themselves in this situation,because love is the only thing that will make your loved one know that even though they won't be around,at least they will know they were loved. I have recommended my friends to see this episode and as like myself,they too are crying babies,they love it as much as me. To me this episode will be the best,and so is Part2. If u didn't know Part 2 is the continuation of Petey's mom trying to cope w/life with out him and giving up on faith. But the angels come back to find a mom who doesnt care about herself and life and blames the angels for the death of her son. And as a surprise Naomi (Wynonna's mom) plays her mom who left her when she was a child which they end up singing another great song to end the episode. To me these episodes represent life as it is.",987292800,,1181,4.1615720524017465
1405437,5,B000059HFV,"I am 14, and the first time that I saw this...I had no idea what they (The angels) were talking about, and that wonderful young boy...Petey, was so adorably touching!!!  This Movie should get 1,000,000 stars!!!!!:)",986601600,,214,4.944444444444445
1405438,5,B000059HFV,"One of the best, most inspiring episodes I have seen. A boy faces death with dignity and he is his mom's insiration (Wynnona Judd) to finish a song that is so uplifting (Testify To Love) that I'm glad it is included in the Touched By An Angel soundtrack CD. The boy has a list of things to finish before he dies and the show is about the angels helping him to complete his list which teaches those around him the meaning of the word dignity. But he must stay until his mom completes her song. She is afraid to complete it or she will lose him. Tears? You wouldn't be human if you didn't have misty eyes as you listen to the finished version of the song his mom couldn't finish. I was far from depressed at the end. I look at life a little differently now and you will too! Don't miss it! I must confess I do not remember the premier episode but since the show keeps getting better and better it must be worth purchasing to see how it all began. It is hard to believe the 100th episobe was over 7 years ago. I hope this show never ends! It's one of the few worth waiting to watch each week! May God bless the writers to keep them inspired.",985824000,,1138,4.1076233183856505
1405499,5,B000059HFV,"There wasn't one show that didn't make me feel like anything is possible. That GOD DOES exist and loves us. I only wish like the others,it was on DVD. I never understood why it went off the air when these Reality shows took over. I would reccomend all the movies of the shows you can get cause even cable doesnt show it. The episode 151st Psalm took much kleenex. This movie is uplifting,gives hope,exilarating,an truly is,Touched by an Angel.",1055808000,5,443,4.620253164556962
1405500,5,B000059HFV,"I am only 14 years old. And to tell you the truth, I NEVER cry. But I watched this episode, The 151st Psalm, and I cried a really long time. I have seen it about 2 or 3 times on T.V. now and everytime, I cry like a baby. I haven't got the VHS, but my mother is going to soon. I can't wait to get it. Although Touched Bye an Angel has had many many GREAT episodes, i would have to say that this one is the best one. Not to mention the most touching. I am upset that the show is now off the air. It was a great one. To anyone who is thinking about buying the VHS, do it! I hope The 151st Psalm touches you like it did me!",1054944000,6,619,3.626865671641791
1405501,5,B000059HFV,"Sorry, but I'm going to vent a little. Why in blazes does idiotic drivel like ""American Idol"", ""The Real World"", or ""Sex and the City"" pop right onto DVD, while marvelous things like ""Touched"" languish on a dying format (VHS)?
A bit of an outrage.
I have been watching ""Touched"" for years, and have wondered when we might see just one episode that would dip into corny writing, a lapse in good acting, etc, and it never has happened. Just a great show every time. It is the only reason we turn the TV on.",1045353600,13,504,4.315789473684211
1405502,5,B000059HFV,I love Touched By An Angel and the 100th episode was my all time favorite! Was so happy to be able to have a copy for my home.,1044748800,6,126,3.5357142857142856
1405503,5,B000059HFV,this was my first video of touched by an angel given to me. now i buy each and everyone oi can. the 1st ans 100th episode touches my heart ans reminds me of haw easy we forget and let everything try to stop us but with faith we can do anything. i love the one about petey. and would like to find the 2nd episode to it. and the music is great in it. if one will lwt tyhe stories and the music touch you will see a new world that need your help. and everyone can help in one way or another. from praying to going out and helping others less fortuen that yourself. so give and helping hand and touch someone less today with your love and careing.,1007251200,3,643,3.953846153846154
1405504,5,B000059HFV,"To say ""I Love this video"" would not totally express what is bursting inside me. When I first saw ""Psalm 151"", I cried, I laughed, I was sad and I was overjoyed. The performances are fantastic! Featuring WYNNONA, a cameo by CELINE DION and two adorable children - the regular cast shines - this is a wonderful example of the power of God's messengers - his angels. The script is brilliant and inspiring. The songs uplifting and the ending...wow...how can anyone ever doubt the awesome power of God? This is a must video for all ""T by an A"" fans and a must-see for anyone who doubts that ""God Loves You.""",998870400,8,603,4.441441441441442
1405505,5,B000059HFV,"While I find ""Touched By an Angel"" to generally be the most uplifting show on the air, the 100th episode - ""The 151st Psalm"" is probably the best they've done. The base story line revolves around a dying child. Despite this seemingly depressing base, I find that I feel good - very good - at the end. Of course, I start from a world view of hope, and I find that this episode reinforces that view. Death isn't the end, only a new beginning, and love IS eternal.",998784000,17,461,4.25
1405506,5,B000059HFV,"This was prob. one of the best episodes that the show has ever created. The Love that is protrayed is Awesome, It reminds me of the love that our Heavenly Father has for us. The words in the song that is sang Psalms 151(Testify to Love)really have some awesome meaning. I suggest that you all give a listen. It really makes a person stop and think about the sacrafice that was made for all of us. Even though many of us choose to reject that gift. I give all my support to the show, I hope and pray that it will continue for many more seasons to come. It is very nice to have a show out there with some morrals. As for the gentelman that gave it one star and a very poor review. I will gladly give you some prozac as well as a lot of prayer.
Thanks for your time.  Your Brother in Christ,  Doug  ...",997315200,2,799,4.012578616352202

I only rent what I want to watch. I have to say God would be pleased with your show he need your help. I prey you people that play the  part stop and listen to the Father.

7933430,5,B000059HFV,I have watched every touched by an angel show made and i loved every one. these two episodes are among the best especially the first south bound. I have these on dvd Randy Travis was super in this and again in shallow waters and in the very last episode I'll walk with you I think they should not have cancelled this program bad mistake on their part that is why i have bought both season one and season two on dvd and can't wait until they bring season three out just when that will be i don't know but would like to know  if you are a touched by an angel fan i would suggest you get these two episodes at least if not all the episodes,1116806400,6,636,4.0078740157480315
7933431,5,B000059HFV,"I have watched many many episodes of Touched By An Angel because  the writing is original, to the point, sensitive and poignant. The actors/actresses do an excellent job portraying their characters as well. I bought this video after seeing the episode on tv and bawling my eyes out. I have since shown it and lent it out to many people and they all have returned it with gratitude and just gushing about the show. This particular episode ' The 151st Psalm' is beautifully written, acted, and portrayed. There are emotions and words captured  in such a way that is not often seen in theatrics. I believe the only way you could feel such 'real' emotion is if you experienced these happenings first hand. I suppose in a way that is what this show has done, is allow you a firsthand glimpse and to experience it, step into it, without having to actually feel the pain or gladness. You simply cannot get more real. I am in my late 20's and I and my child connect with this episode in much the same ways that people in their 30's to well over 50 I have shared this with have. It is a timeless episode as well as program to watch over and over. Wynonna Judd is captivating playing the dying child's mother. Who knew she was as good an actress as singer? A must have even for non-fans. I highly recommend it. It caringly addresses the issues of dying and the feelings associated with it as well as finding the light of God through such a dark time. I found it quite helpful as there is much wisdom in its script about the will of God being victorious and what is best even if it's not what someone may want. I have watched alot of television, and this is simply in the top 10 of best episodes of any show ever to be broadcast.",1103932800,7,1718,4.315789473684211
7933432,5,B000059HFV,"As I read through the articles written with regards TBAA I am amazed that people share the same passion as me for this remakable series. I wonder how long the producers can ignore our cries for a boxed set of DVD's. And while your at it please don't forget us region 4 folks in Australia.
Touched by an Angel is a beautifully presented series, focusing on the love and understading nature of our wonderful God. In a world where violence and sex seem to be prerequisites for a popular entertainment TBAA is akin to a glass of cold water on a hot dusty day. Wonderful.",1078444800,6,566,4.4
7933433,5,B000059HFV,"This is one of the best TV shows I have ever seen.  When ever I watch any of the shows I have taped off, it makes me feel good inside.  My tapes are getting very worn out.  I would love to see all the seasons on DVD boxed sets.  I would buy all of them in a heart beat.  I think there are alot of other people out there who are trying to wait patiently for all the seasons to come out on DVD.
Maybe if enough people write to Paramount and CBS about TBAA then it might happen soon!!!",1077235200,4,482,3.78
7933434,5,B000059HFV,"The song that was the centerpiece of the 100th episode of ""Touched"" was actually a #1 hit Contemporary Christian song for the Christian pop group, Avalon.  It is on the group's 2003 greatest hits album, ""The Very Best of Avalon: Testify to Love"" (which you can buy from Amazon.com).  If you liked ""Testify to Love"" you will probably like other Avalon songs.
I agree that we need to see all of the seasons of ""Touched By An Angel"" on DVD.  I cannot believe this has not already been done.  All the Christians I know really loved that show and would buy the DVDs of it in a heartbeat.",1075248000,2,582,4.361111111111111

7933436,5,B000059HFV,"The 100th episode of ""Touched By An Angel"" is by far one of the best television episodes of any television series.  ""The 151st Psalm"" is about a boy who is dying and wishes to complete a list of things he must do before he meets God.  His most important issue is to see to it that his mother finishes her inspirational song that she has been working on.  A tear jerker?  Even the Terminator would shed a tear on this one.  But now my grip.  To those in the know and to the powers that be.  READ THIS...Where is the DVD?  Hello, DVD??? You know, that little round disc that houses such negative shows like the ""Sopranos"", ""Sex and The City"", etc.  Do you know what a huge audience you have for DVD's for ""Touched By An Angel""?
Come on fellows or whoever is in charge...let's get with it.  Welcome to the 21st century.  Tape is out and discs are in and this is one program that shouldn't be short changed.  Bring the show back on television too!  It was too good to get rid of.  Who made that stupid decision, Damion Thornton?",1071705600,3,1024,4.238341968911917
