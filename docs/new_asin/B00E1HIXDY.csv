5883257,5,B00E1HIXDY,I bought this for 2 Headed Shark Attack. It's cheesy B movie fun. Got the 3 movie pack for the same price as the 2 Headed Shark Attack DVD would have been by itself.,1438819200,,165,3.8823529411764706
5883258,4,B00E1HIXDY,"Sharks apparently never stop being hungry and will continue eating people until they are killed.  These movies are not the best films ever made, but they are fun to watch.  The 2-headed shark likes to eat women in Bikini's and Mega Sharks will eat anything including a submarine.  Its a good thing it called science fiction.  You can't take the action seriously, just sit back and enjoy both movies.  Yes it is Urkel who saves the world from the Mega shark.  I enjoyed both movies.",1438473600,7,481,4.6

8600057,5,B00E1HIXDY,We need more movies like this!,1512000000,,30,4.166666666666667
8600058,5,B00E1HIXDY,My daughter loves these crazy movies-thank you so much for making them available-looking forward to ordering more really really soon!,1494201600,,133,5.7
8600059,1,B00E1HIXDY,"There's bad, really bad and truly abysmal and all three of these movies end up on the truly abysmal scale. ""Two Headed Shark Attack' is beyond ridiculous as those characters who're supposedly scientists and students are definitely NOT, and we were actually cheering when a character was eaten as they're just so utterly ridiculous and just downright dumb. 'Megashark' is equally dumb as there's enough plot holes and ridiculous actions (and really lame special effects) to drive a mammoth through and no shark or croc is going to be able to sink a naval vessel. And the characters are awfully written and awfully portrayed. ""Shark Island', we're still trying to figure out what the movie actually was about as none of the characters made any sense nor why they were on an island being fed to the sharks (literally in some cases) in the first place. The acting is either overblown or so overly dramatic that it's just not believable. The sharks are the best thing about the movie. Don't waste your time purchasing this one.",1492214400,,1022,4.8125
8600060,5,B00E1HIXDY,Great movie,1491609600,,11,5.0
8600061,3,B00E1HIXDY,Pretty much what you expect from a Low rent scifi 3 film set but mostly pretty enjoyable. Mega shark probably being the best.,1481500800,,125,4.478260869565218
8600062,4,B00E1HIXDY,3 for the price of 1.  Love it!,1472688000,,31,2.875
8600063,5,B00E1HIXDY,I am a fan of crappy horror and shark movies. This fills both bills.,1468713600,,68,3.9285714285714284
8600064,5,B00E1HIXDY,"This is the 3 fer from the world of sharks. One killing shark movie after the other. They are all B movies, but they are fun to watch. You have probably seen all of them on the syfy channel, if not you don't know what you are missing. I won't spoil it for anyone who has not seen them, but I will say, they are good and bloody fun. So, if you like movies about killer sharks this set has it all. Though, my wife feels they were just not bloody enough, they were plenty bloody to me.
