8564861,3,B00BADGYS8,The movie is packed with good feelings and melodrama. I fell asleep in the middle of it. The only thing which stood out were the beautiful landscapes of the Chihuahua region.,1402099200,,174,4.645161290322581
8564862,4,B00BADGYS8,"This movies says a lot about how People have dreams  and how people go to the USA hoping to fulfill their dreams send money back to Mexico to help their Parents.  The Boy in the story  reads letters to folks in his town and most of them  tell of  bad  experiences in the US, but the Boy lies to them and tells them how good everything is.  The movie  shows Mexican Life  in a realistic way and to me provokes thought about  people who come here illegally  to make things better and  realize that perhaps things were better at home.  If you speak any Spanish, this movie is worth your time.",1381622400,,589,4.198198198198198
8564863,4,B00BADGYS8,"This movie's original audio is in Spanish and it does not have any subtitles in English or Spanish. I can understand it, but many people cannot without subtitles. Also, the movie didn't appear professional. It kind of seemed like what you would get from a copying market vendor. Great story, disappointed with DVD itself. My situation may be unique based on the seller I used. I would recommend using caution if you need subtitles.",1371945600,,431,4.837837837837838
