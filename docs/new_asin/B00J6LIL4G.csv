So when he had a chance to produce 1945's Pardon My Pal, best believe he referenced his hometown no less than eight times in the movie. Fred MacMurray was so likable an actor that even when he played a nogoodnik, he ended up redeeming that character before the curtain dropped. In Pardon My Past, MacMurray takes on the dual roles of a gambler what's skipped out of a town and the poor sap lookalike who ends up holding the bag. MacMurray opens as ex-GI Eddie York, fresh out of the Army and looking to open a mink farm in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin with his irascible war buddy Chuck (William Demarest). Eddie and Chuck are in a stopover in New York when Eddie is spotted by a goon who tips off his boss that, hey, here's that welcher, Francis Pemberton, what's owed him $12,000 for two years now. Cue Akim Tamiroff, marvelous as Mr. Arnold, that Dapper Dan of a bookie intent on collecting. And here's Eddie - $3000 to his name, all of that needed to bankroll his mink farm - and it's no use his insisting that he's not this shady Pemberton fella. Bookie don't wanna hear that.

Eddie is one of those honorable types who never do well in shows like Game of Thrones. He thinks all he needs to do is find Pemberton, and then things'll square away. The rest of the movie spins off what happens when Eddie visits Pemberton's estate and is further subjected to a case of mistaken identity. He meets the disapproving grandfather (Harry Davenport), and the manipulative uncle (Douglass Dumbrille), and the long-suffering beauty (Marguerite Chapman) who we hope is a distant relative, given the romantic complications that arise, and a plot twist that surfaces.

Pemberton is described, disdainfully, by other characters as spoiled and spineless and thrall to the whims of his controlling Uncle Wills. I will say that maybe MacMurray could've played Pemberton as even more of a weak-willed rogue, even more of a heel, so as to make his eventual turnaround that much more impactful. Anyway, Pardon My Past plays out much like a half-hour sitcom on the telly, y'know, that episode where there's a misunderstanding? But it's a good and willing cast. Tamiroff is affable even as he exudes a silky sort of menace. Dumbrille is so convincing as the true heavy that you can't help but cheer when he gets his comeuppance. The ladies don't have much to do, but they're game and they look gorgeous - Marguerite Chapman as the primary love interest, Rita Johnson winsome in her brief moments on camera as Pemberton's wronged ex-wife contemplating reconciliation because she thinks Pemberton had changed. Listen, Pardon My Past is a lightweight flick. It doesn't do much to rep MacMurray's acting chops, but so what? It's a lot of fun and amusing, and, boy, did that nasty Uncle Wills have it coming.",1465257600,,2849,4.718875502008032
