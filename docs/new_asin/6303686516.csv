DVD
1945

Film = two (2) stars; score = three (3) stars; cinematography = barely three (3) stars;  restoration = 2.5 stars; script =2.5 stars.  Director Akira Kurosawa (who also wrote the movie script, but not the play) presents a less-than-successful mash up of stage play and motion picture.  This slice-of-life or existential play/movie has no beginning (unless you count the extensive lead-in expository text and singing which is essentially a filmed version of a play's program notes) or end with not much happening in between.  The title (mentioned in the expository text) may be semi historical, but does not make much/any sense for the name of the play/movie.  Fleeting mature acting is all but buried (or blown up) by the juvenile antics of comedian Motohiko Itou who Kurosawa allows to run roughshod over the play/movie.  (This character seems to be a fugitive from a Saturday-morning TV show for three-year olds.)  Itou's performance is not only a self caricature, but gives a vast new meaning to the word ""ludicrous.""  (His persistent performance soon becomes extremely painful to watch!)  The pace of the play/movie is slow and the result is boring.  Kurosawa's focus is on talking heads with almost zero physical action.  A major reediting seems to be in order to both shorten the play/movie and remove 90 percent of Itou's ""bolt-on"" embarrassing performance.  Phony studio ""exterior"" sets look OK for a play, but are a distraction for a movie with set decoration dominated by poorly painted canvas.  Cinematography (narrow screen, black and white) is OK.  Score and subtitles are fine.  Restoration has a way to go (but may not be worth further investment for such an inferior film).  Wear marks, dirt artifacts, and frame shrinkage occur throughout the film.  Not recommended even for the most fanatical of Kurosawa fans!  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1466812800,,2192,4.945205479452055
7852855,1,6303686516,"I viewed a version of this film on cable and was so moved by the strong acting and poetic dialogue (as related in the sub-titles--I am not a Japanese speaker) that I ordered this copy, not realizing that there is more than one version available in my market (USA).

The video transfer quality in this Mei Ah Entertainment release is very bad, especially when the camera was panning quickly (which doesn't happen too often in this deliberately slow-paced story). As distracting as the video quality is, the big disappointment is with the English translation sub-titles. The Japanese names have largely been translated into Chinese names. The real problem however, is that the dialogue was apparently first translated into Chinese and then into English. The resultant gibberish is mostly incomprehensible. Had I not seen the earlier version, I would have had little idea of what was going on.

There is a much better English sub-titled version out there, but it is definitely not this one. I think most general viewers will be in for a big disappointment with the Mei Ah version. My single-star rating is solely for the poor quality of the translation and video transfer.",1296864000,3,1169,4.959183673469388
7852856,4,6303686516,"I had never heard of this Japanese film, and rented the DVD based on Kurosawa-san's name, a skimpy description about samurai disguised as monks escorting their feudal Lord who is escaping his jealous brother, and a note that the film is based on an ancient Noh play.  That was good enough for me, an avid jidai-geki (period film) and chambara (sword film) fan.

  This film is a gem.  The opening credits reveal that the story touches on the life of one of Japan's most celebrated and tragic heroes, Minamoto Yoshitsune, the brilliant and legendary general of the 12th-century Gempei Wars, and his equally revered companion-in-arms, the warrior-monk Benkei. The time and setting of the film is Yoshitsune's flight to escape the murderous treachery of his manipulative, ambitious and ruthless brother Yoritomo, who would soon become Shogun.  We catch up with him and his loyal retainers as they attempt to cross a border into a safe province and are stopped at the military guard-post by an astute, and suspicious, steward.

  What I liked about this 1945 59-minute film: Kurosawa's crisp, luminous black and white photography, the 'stillness' of each scene, the haunting Noh music and chorus underscoring key scenes, the Buddhist/Zen ethos, the Karsh-like portraiture of the warriors, and how the simplicity, even absence, of action oddly built tension and anticipation, especially around the reveal of the disguised young Yoshitsune. (If you're looking for slash and cut swordplay, this is not your film.)

  What I didn't like about this film: the over-the-top and distracting rubber-faced antics of the hired porter who allegedly provides comic relief, an anticlimactic extended sake-drinking scene that added very little to the story, the slightly discordant though noble image of Yoshitsune, and the odd moment of jumpy camera-work.

  PS: Yoshitsune eventually found safe haven for only a short period, and was eventually forced to commit seppuku (ritual suicide).  He was 30 years old when he died.  ""A remarkable soldier and a classically tragic figure, Yoshitsune was a legend even before his passing. The manner in which Yoshitsune died assured him an honorable place in posterity, while the memory of Yoritomo will forever bear a black mark as a result . . .

7852857,1,6303686516,"This film stands along side Seven Samurai and Ikiru as a truly magnificent production. I own it on vhs and purchased the Dvd with delight only to be shocked by the extremely poor digital video  and audio transfer. Many shots are multiple imaged and clipped. The dialogue is bearly understandable.  Finally, as a person who speaks and reads Japanese fluently I must tell you the translation  subtitling is very, very poor.  Frankly, save your money.",1223769600,5,448,4.933333333333334
7852858,4,6303686516,"My star rating is for the film itself, which is very good early Kurosawa. HOWEVER, I own the Mei Ah Hong Kong disc, which is completely unwatchable due to a bad pressing. I have had problems with other DVDs from this company, so I will wait to see what others say before buying it myself. Hopefully, Mei Ah has corrected the problem for this release.",1214092800,4,350,4.4
7852859,5,6303686516,"I watched Kurosawa's They Who Step on Tiger's Tail yesterday and am here today to order a copy.  Everything about it was excellent.  It was made right after WWII and had a meager budget (it looks like it could have been shot in a patch of woods behind the studio), but that only adds to its charm.  The actors more than rise to the task; the actor who played Benkei is inspirational.  Two thumbs up!",1202342400,4,399,4.28
7852860,3,6303686516,"Suppose we came across an unknown early John Ford film about a moment in US history.  Maybe it could be about the Surrender at Appomattox, the first Thanksgiving, the surrender of Sitting Bull, or some other real event that could qualify as both history and folklore.  Wouldn't it be worthwhile to see the emerging artistry of the young director and get his take on a popular moment in time?  I'm assuming that this was how the Japanese viewed Kurosawa's ""The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail"".  It covers a moment in time in Japanese history but one that is unknown to those of us in the Western World.  Kurosawa treats this event with respect for the heroes as well as respect for the audience (by injecting a fair amount of humor).  I mention all of this because ""The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail"" is a movie that suggests that it will turn into an action film yet it never does.  That would be like Robert E. Lee throwing down the pen and starting a sword fight with US Grant, the pilgrims dropping the drumstick and grabbing the blunderbuss, or Sitting Bull changing his mind and scalping the fort commandant.

What does transpire is a testimant to the bravery and cunning of the movie's main characters and their ability keep their cool at all times.  Perhaps Kurosawa is saying that courage is not found in senseless suicidal warfare but in standing tall and peacefully persuading your adversary.  Not a bad message for Japan in 1944.

For those Kurosawa fans who like the Samurai movies, I guess TMWTOTTT would qualify as one as well.  It's only an hour long but it has some impressive acting.  Kurosawa made this movie for Japanese audiences (well, Duh!) and the subject matter will probably fail to interest most Western audiences.  For general fans of Kurosawa, this early movie has some impressive moments.",1166313600,3,1824,4.677115987460815
7852861,5,6303686516,"Kurosawa's film ""The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail"" (alternate titles exist) brings to the screen many of the themes the master director will explore fulsomely in later films. This early piece is charming, particularly rewarding for fans of classic Japanese film.

Some of the themes introduced are: Hidden/obscured identity: The Prince who poses as a porter prefigures (inversely), the great Tatsuya Nakadai role of the thief who poses as an emperor in ""Kagemusha"".

Comedic relief: The ""real"" porter of ""Tiger's Tail"", played by the comedian Enoken (hugely popular in the libertine Asakusa district of Tokyo during the war and early post-war period) prefigures the use of a similar comic figure in Kurosawa's last great period film: ""Ran"" in which ""Peter"" plays the fool for comic relief, and ultimately, pathos. Double your pleasure and double your fun with the two peasant figures in ""The Hidden Fortress""!

Japanese Culture as inspiration: Kurosawa will dip into this well often, and bring something wonderful to the screen. ""Throne of Blood"" references Noh masks and performance, ""Tiger's Tail"" references Kabuki.

In summation, then, this film is valuable for itself, and for the indications of Kurosawa's future directions and interests in film. Recommended to the general viewer, and most highly recommended for those who appreciate classic Japanese films. For Kurosawa buffs, essential viewing.",1139184000,5,1408,5.415525114155251
7852862,5,6303686516,"This is unlike other Kurasawa films and therefore less known in the west.  In his other films, Kurasawa uses camera angles, settings , motion and music to grab the viewer and immerse him into the movie.  In ""Tiger's Tail "" there is very little camera work or settings-In fact, I remember only three:the forest,The checkpoint and The Road.  This movie instead draws all its power and intensity by using Kabuki styled acting and motion.
 The story is about a prince who is being hunted by his bitrailling brother.  To escape, he relize on the help of a handful of loyal samurai as they covertley try to pass a main check point even though all enemy warriors are on high alert. This is why the movie is also called ""They who step on tiger's Tail.
 I loved the acting of the lead General who is disguessed as a Yamabushi(Priest Samurai).  If you wanted to see Kabuki or understand one of the elements that set Kurasawa's style apart from other Directors, then see this movie.  I'm buying the DVD as soon as Amozon.com gets it.",1064620800,9,1022,4.546448087431694
7852863,4,6303686516,"This movie is amusing!  The comic who plays the porter (Enomoto)was famous in Japan, but not for period pieces. Like old Jerry Lewis movies, the best part about his ""schtick"" has to be the reactions of the refugee  samurai he accompanies. Kind of like ""The Goofball and the Tough  Guys""  This is a surprisingly accessible movie, and has an  old-fashioned feel to it--very deliberately staged, and reflects Kurosawa's  western influence.  In style, it is rather similar to early Hitchcock!",916790400,7,488,5.10126582278481
