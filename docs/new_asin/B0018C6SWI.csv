8516462,3,B0018C6SWI,"Amateur in experience, but auteur in execution. This best describes the first-time effort from a motley crew of Polytechnic graduates. Driven by a provocative script, e'Zaintes is a critical look at tertiary life and the folly of youthful angst and anger.

The setting is nondescript: a college run by iron-fisted authority. How often do we see that? Many times. However, what keeps things fresh and interesting are the dark undertones that simmer beneath the ostensibly calm confines of the school.

Named after a fictional town it is located in, Faeryville College sees the addition of a new student to its ranks, Wynn Low (Wesley Teo). A student with a dark past, Wynn craves for acceptance in a new surrounding.

Here, Wynn finds himself entwined in a feud between two rival groups, the Backside Boys led by an Indian named Ah Hock! and e'Tzaintes, fronted by poetry spouting W.Ash Faeke (Tzang Merwyn).

Despite his reservations of getting embroiled in trouble, Wynn takes to e'Tzaintes (pronounced 'The Saints') because he feels he has many things in common with e'Tzaintes; that of a social misfit.

Events come to a head one day when Ah Hock gives Faeke a severe beating, culminating in a finale that is unexpected as it is tragic. e'Tzaintes is a damning indictment of the the hypocritical society we live in; one that condemns people who thinks and behaves differently from the others and condones those who may fit the norms but are not necessarily right in their actions.

On top of its disturbing content, the movie also includes subtle digs at Smurfs, infotainment commercials and pop culture worship.  Tightly edited and intense, especially in the build up to the denouement, e'Tzaintes is a commendable oeuvre from Tzang (who wrote and co-produced the movie) and his ""saintly servants"".",1212278400,,1802,5.026845637583893
