8733914,5,B015MSEB04,"Loved this movie, it is one of the best foreign films I have seen yet, well played out, great directing, and of course it is a musical which by American standards can be tedious, but all the music chosen was very good (or a great time to do an intermission (you know bathroom break)), the CGI was noticeable but considering it was made in a foreign country, I think they had enough action to keep you watching, and yeah some of the scenes were a bit dramatic and unrealistic, but so it batman and superman shown in the American cinemas. Over all the story line was great, we have all been through the stories of uncle trying to steal the throne from brother but this one gave a twist that was worth watching - oh, and keep an open mind it is a foreign film.",1509062400,2,757,4.227586206896552
