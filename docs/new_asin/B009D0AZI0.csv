I had a chance to speak to the twins as well after and these are some great guys who followed their dream. It's a great documentary, well edited, and I learned a lot about why people across the United States love Dolly Parton. If you're a fan of Dolly or know someone who is, this is a good gift to yourself or someone else.",1351382400,3,424,4.059523809523809

Since then I've seen it at least 5 times it still makes me cry and laugh. It's a simple premise, deliver a package from point a to point b. Throw in two great guys (the twins), the people they know (in Hollywood) and the people they meet (on the road), a dream, and a super star, you come out with a must see and must own film.",1349308800,7,436,3.8555555555555556
5317150,5,B009D0AZI0,"Best movie ever, hilarious and touching. I highly recommend to everyone. I saw it in the theater and I was laughing out loud. I've now seen it about 6 times.",1349222400,3,157,4.266666666666667
5317151,5,B009D0AZI0,"""Hollywood to Dollywood"" documents the struggle that two identical gay twin brothers have in trying to get a movie script (that they have written) into the hands of their idol Dolly Parton. After sending the script to Dolly's management in Nashville where it was returned as unsolicited material, Gary and Larry Lane, two beautiful looking and intelligent guys, decide the only way to get the script into Dolly's hands is by meeting her at Dollywood, Dolly's theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee at its 25th Anniversary opening. Knowing Dolly always makes appearances at the park's season opening the Lane brothers are hoping they will somehow get to meet Dolly and hand her the script.

 The film starts in Los Angeles, where Gary and Larry live, and they decide to rent an RV promptly named by them as Jolene, in reference to Dolly's #1 song from 1974, and decide to travel cross country to Tennessee. On their way there with Mike Bowen (Gary's boyfriend who does the driving) the twins encounter various people who also idolize Dolly and recount their feelings toward her.

 ""Hollywood to Dollywood"" also addresses the issue of homosexuality, people's prejudices toward our sexual orientation (yes I am gay too) and the problem the twin's mother has in dealing with having two gay sons.

 The movie shows actual scenes of the terrible flood in downtown Nashville which occured in 2010, the damage to one of Dolly's then businesses ""Trinkets and Treasures"" and their eventual arrival in Pigeon Forge. I will not say if Gary and Larry meet Dolly, but the ending is not to be missed.

 Gary and Larry supported the financing of the documentary from their own pockets (they were winners on a network reality series called ""Wipeout"") and the film has won dozens of ""Best Documentary"" awards.

 The film is simply beautifully produced, has a ton of cameos with people like Oscar-winner Dustin Lance Black (screenplay writer of ""Milk""), Chad Allen, Beth Grant (who starred with Dolly in the 1999 TV film ""Blue Valley Songbird"") and funny Leslie Jordan who recounts the time as a teenager he went to see Dolly in 1970 when RCA recorded her ""A Real Live Dolly"" album at her high school. When one of the twins (I can't tell them apart) actually gives Leslie a copy of the rare CD recording of ""A Real Live Dolly"" you can see the love Leslie has for the one and only Dolly Parton.

 Dolly had a hand in the film herself as she allowed Gary and Larry to use 16 of her original songs to be used in the soundtrack at no cost. Her classics like ""Coat of Many Colors"", ""Jolene"" and ""I Will Always Love You"" only add essence to what is already a remarkable film. 10% of what the movie makes goes to Dolly's Imagination Library Program.

 There are several bonuses such as 90 minutes of features never before seen including what the boys have been up to since the film's release, their appearances on the ""Marie Osmond"" and the ""Jeff Probst"" talk shows, an interview with director John Lavin, a Question and Answer session with Chad Allen and Gary and Larry at the New York City Film Festival and so much more.

 I adore ""Hollywood to Dollywood"" as not only does it show the love that Dolly's fan base have of their idol as well as her love for them, but it's underlying theme of the acceptance of anyone, no matter what your sexuality, is really what love is all about.

 ""The Hollywood Reporter"" says the film is a ""Casually road trip doc about aspiring screenwriters desperate to meet their showbiz idol"".

I am proud of you Gary and Larry, what you have done for gay rights, your respect and recognition for the greatest entertainer that has ever lived and for being proud of who you are!

 Much love to you both!",1348272000,16,3703,4.657450076804915
5317152,5,B009D0AZI0,"This was such enjoyable little dvd!  Gary and Larry Lane are two of the nicest guys in Hollywood and the story of their mission to, not only meet Dolly Parton, but to get the script to her in person was so heartwarming and entertaining.  In the process, there was the other issue of their coming out and the differences they had with their parents and family, back home in the Bible belt.
With appearances by Chad Allen, Leslie Jordan, Beth Grant, Dustin Lance Black... this was a really fun watch.  The additional footage of the Q and A's, etended interviews, photos, etc., really rounded it out.

It was personable and heartwarming.  The story was clear and consistent.  It was great to see their reactions when they finally got to meet their idol at the end and Dolly is just as warm and gracious as people say.  Lots of times I will buy gay movies without seeing them first and quickly come to regret the purchase.  This is not the case with ""Hollywood to Dollywood.""

5317157,2,B009D0AZI0,"I bought this because of the subject of Dolly Parton.
It's about coming out as adult gay men in the south, and that is the story line.  Sure they rented an RV to drive from Hollywood to Dollywood, and yes they did meet Dolly, but their screen play may or may have not been acted upon.  They spent 5 yrs writing it?  Hmmm.  It's about the south not accepting gay males (or females?  ... not mentioned) and even parents closing the door permanently in the faces of gays who came out.  It is only about Dolly because the twin adult men who wrote it, saw Dolly as accepting of anybody (though I imagine she's not particularly out there campaigning for gays).  It wasn't that great and the reviews and titles suggest it's more than it is.  It was interesting, but not that much unless you are a gay man and want to feel part of something bigger, if you're alone out there.  I have gay family members, I'm straight, and accept people for what they are.  This was not a move track about Dolly or her music in any way, and one track states:  This ""ALSO""... is the WHOLE story line, not an ""also"":
 ""Hollywood to Dollywood"" also addresses the issue of homosexuality, people's prejudices toward our sexual orientation (yes I am gay too) and the problem the twin's mother has in dealing with having two gay sons.",1378080000,2,1301,4.420168067226891

It is more than just a musical journey to try to meet the one and only Dolly.  It is a coming of age film that's time is now.
This world has had enough of prejudice.  And it is the time for everyone to be themselves and be allowed to shine and show the beauty that the differences of the world have to offer.
The Lane Twins have done this by just being.
With a cast of incredible people like Ann Walker, Trevor, Cody Renegar, Dustin Lance Black to the Friendly Couple at a Truck Stop, ""Hollywood to Dollywood"" shows how important each voice is.  This film heals.
This is a movie that I could watch over an over again.  (And I have)

5317169,5,B009D0AZI0,"""Hollywood To Dollywood"" is one of the best documentaries to come along within this last year--and it definitely is the most engageing! Identical twin brothers, Gary & Larry Lane set out to realize their dream of presenting their ""Idol"" Country Superstar Dolly Parton with a script they wrote just for her, and in doing so make us realize that dreams CAN and DO come true if one works at them. Along the way they not only tell their own personal story but many of truly affecting stories of the people they meet along the way. The documentary also features plenty of great cameos from some of the twin's ""celebrity"" friends who wish them well, and it all adds up to some genuinely terrific--not to mention deeply inspiring--viewing.

It is a wonderful story about to brothers Garry and Larry Lane and their quest to deliver a screen play they wrote for Dolly to the Dolly Parton herself. Their journey from Hollywood to Dollywood in a motor home appropriately named ""Jolene"" takes you on a magical journey full of epic proportions. Along the way you learn about the boy's own struggles growing up in a rather religious family and coming to terms with their sexuality. Hollywood to Dollywood is a sincere, funny, touch, and uplifting story and one you do not want to miss! Dolly Parton herself has praised the film as well as allowed the boys to use 15 wonderful songs of hers that have been masterfully placed throughout the film.

Our hearts went out to Gary and Larry as they dealt with their Mother and other family members. Leslie Jordan was as always so funny and enjoyed hearing Chad Allen's story. As a gay man who has gone some of the things Gary and Larry has, our heart really went out to them. This is a great DVD and I will recommend to all my friends!

and it has 15 Dolly songs!!!

A documentary of 2 gay brothers heading across country to deliever a script they wrote for Dolly. if this wasn't filmed as a documentary, Dolly might have thought they were stalkers... but alas they werent..
OK-the brothers are cute, the store is cute, and there is some decent commentary about acceptance of the brothers being gay. I am saddened by the fact their mother continues to have issues with them.

Worth the price of purchase:

Useless to say that they blew the audience away and people are still talking about their visit and their wonderful heartfelt documentary. Following their journey to deliver their screenplay to Dolly Parton and allowing the audience a look into their lives and struggles is extremely moving and having a soundtrack featuring 15 classic Dolly Parton songs is priceless.

The DVD has some extras which I personally always love and if we just get one film like this with their stars attending for every Film Festival, that is every programmers dream.

5317181,4,B009D0AZI0,"Gary and Larry Lane are 35 year old gay twins, originally from a conservative church family in North Carolina, who are chasing their actor/screenwriter dreams in Hollywood.  Their most ambitious joint effort is a screenplay called ""Full Circle,"" featuring the songs of Dolly Parton, with a role for her in the film.  They decide the best way to get the screenplay in her hands is to embark in a five day drive cross country, from Hollywood to where she is scheduled to appear at her theme park, Dollywood, in Tennessee.  Along to help with the driving is Mike, Gary's boyfriend. They also meet many folks along the way, and share their stories of growing up in a family in which, more than a decade after leaving home, they are still not comfortable being open with their sexuality.

The film's listing on some sites suggests it is ""starring"" Chad Allen, Dustin Lance Black, Beth Grant and Leslie Jordan, but these are simply actors who are acquainted with the twins and provide cameo appearances early in the film, before the trip.  Parts of more than a dozen of Dolly's songs make up the soundtrack of the film, and there is a brief scene with her at the end of the film.  The lesson here is in the three young men, and a few of those they met along the way, talking about how their family's reaction to their sexuality impacted their lives, and how Dolly's songs provided comfort.  Sounds strange, but it actually kind of works, mostly due to the pleasant and engaging cast.  Film won numerous ""Best Documentary"" prizes in LGBT film festivals worldwide, and was spotlighted on Rose O'Donnell's show.  DVD is not rated, but there is nothimg here that would not allow a PG.

In those days, having to watch somebody else's home movies or vacation slideshow was universally considered a form of torture; I think The Simpsons has explored the horrors of such an experience. Watching this movie is just like that.

Gary and Larry Lane are gay twins with no discernible talent or charisma but tons of self-importance and pushy ambition. In their grasp at fame they force themselves on some moderately prominent people in and around gay show business, including Chad Allen, Leslie Jordan, and - obviously - Dolly Parton. The result is extremely tiresome.

Ms Parton and the other pros are wonderfully gracious and far more accommodating of the twins' relentless intrusiveness than I would be. I admire tolerance wherever it appears, but if those interesting and gifted people had been a little LESS tolerant, we might not be having to watch the UN-gifted and UN-interesting Lane twins act out their narcissistic personal agenda.

Only the always delightful Mr Jordan and Beth Grant make this movie worth seeing at all. Fast-forwarding until you see their faces is the best way to watch this otherwise annoying and pointless movie.",1417392000,4,1195,5.1179487179487175
