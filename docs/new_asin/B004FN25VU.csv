8427976,4,B004FN25VU,"I must say this was a very grim documentary that pulled no punches at telling it like it really is in the American penal system. Its horrible to learn just how grotesque, sick and violent human beings can become within the prison system when at the onset these inmates are simply just trying to survive in an ugly and violent place with no choice but to join a prison gang or work for them just to have the right to stay alive. Its astonishing the lengths they will go to in order to keep on breathing in such a brutal enviroment. In the case of this story about the Aryan brotherhood, its all pretty unsettling and fierce to learn that such horrific things happen in prison. It seems unthinkable the level of brutality these people experience or engage in every day. I have seen numerous prison documentaries on TV and other places, but this was one of the most revieling and in depth docs ever made about prison gangs. Its a brutal and sobering story that is not easy to watch, but its all true and its very grimly produced by National Geographic. If you want to know just how bad existance in prison can really be for inmates, you really need to see this.",1367712000,,1158,4.390697674418605
8427977,5,B004FN25VU,I thought the video to be informative and educational. The fact that they talked to two ex members inside the prison system makes it very real.,1340755200,,143,4.538461538461538
8427978,3,B004FN25VU,"I was slightly dissapointed with this 45 minute length DVD. This is exactly the same footage as shown on the Nat Geo channel on SKY. Nonetheless it made for an enjoyable 2nd watch. You get real life interviews from 2 ex-members of the gang. This is all based from inside prison tho and you only get a very brief if not extremely violent insight into the workings of the AB. This DVD is a great visual compliment to a book called 'Blood in Blood Out'. I would recommend you buy the 2 products and enjoy :)

Beware tho - there are NO added extras or anything, this is purely and simply the exact same documentary as on Nat Geo channel.",1313539200,,633,4.275
