3051370,5,B000UY6OU6,"Great movie for a fun movie night with friends and a classic musical for those who like the movie versions of Sound of Music, Carousel, etc. as well as Singin' in the Rain and Meet Me in St Louis!",1377907200,,196,4.051282051282051
3051371,5,B000UY6OU6,I saw seven brides for seven brothers when it first came out in thesters. I loved it then and now. I have just purchased it for my collection. thank you for asking.,1377907200,,164,4.15625
3051372,5,B000UY6OU6,"A funny - and a bit thoughtful - musical fictional piece set during the gold rush era when 'wife material' was difficult/almost impossible to find. The lead actor has been in several musicals. Two that come to mind he acted opposite to Debbie Reynolds (she can DANCE and SING!) and played the part of a gambling establishment owner in ""Paint Your Wagon"". Some scenes seem to 'drag', only because the concepts of cinematography and screen play writing was of a different mindset in the post war decades (more dialogue and no CG). I love the barn raising scene with the dancing and the fight that ensues due to the ""male strutting"" competition for a mate! Hey, I am NOT giving away the ending! Which, by the way, is hilarious! Enjoy this movie treat!

Oh! And don't forget the popcorn!!!",1377820800,,785,4.64748201438849

It's a musical, about 7 brothers that are woodsmen looking to get married. the issue is finding their soon to be wives. there is only one small country town and all of the single women already had other guys courting them. it is a fun and simple movie. no bad language, no heavy violence (one or 2 bumps) I think it was made in 1954.",1512950400,,392,4.3108108108108105

Poor Milly goes along, thinking she's going to live happily ever after with Adam, alone in a house of her own. Once she gets over the shock of learning she's basically a maid and cook, she digs in and becomes a mother figure to her new family. Things get crazy after that, but everything works out in the end.

The film is not bad by any means...but it didn't warm me to the 1950s musical genre either. Strong, athletic dance numbers help compensate for a corny plot.",1511308800,,262,4.36734693877551

3051598,5,B000UY6OU6,"This movie musical hasn't lost a bit of its sparkle despite its age! Almost 70 years young, ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" is a delightful romp with dazzling dance sequences and witty repartee that never lags.  I'm not a fan of musicals as a general rule - so many are downright dumb and/or silly - but this is a true golden oldie in every sense of the word.  The songs are a hoot, the production design a reminder of the magic Hollywood used to achieve on a studio backlot, and a reminder of why MGM once reigned supreme for movie musicals.

MGM's Sidney Guilaroff (hairstylist), Walter Plunkett (costume designer) and William Tuttle (makeup) remind us why their names are still remembered today as the finest in their fields.  The film wasn't granted the budget to film on location, and made do with the artificial sets on MGM's backlot.  Yes, it looks fake....but no more so than modern movies with their CG arcade-game-appearances.  Viewers are reminded of what Hollywood's golden era turned out and why these films are still relevant today.  Modern audiences will remember Howard Keel from ""Dallas"" in the 1980s, and Julie Newmar (credited here as Newmeyer) as Catwoman.

""7 Brides for 7 Brothers"" is simply fun.  Well worth adding to your DVD collection as a date night, party night, film study or a late-night tv romp.  LOVED IT!",1489708800,,1339,4.782608695652174

Almost 70 years young, ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" is a delightful romp with dazzling dance sequences and witty repartee that never lags.  I'm not a fan of musicals as a general rule - so many are downright dumb and/or silly - but this is a true golden oldie in every sense of the word.  The songs are a hoot, the production design a reminder of the magic Hollywood used to achieve on a studio backlot, and a reminder of why MGM once reigned supreme for movie musicals.

3051622,4,B000UY6OU6,"This is an excellent musical from the early 1950s during the golden age of Hollywood musicals.  It stars Howard Keel and Jane Powell.  It is about men in the Oregon back country seeking wives.  The songs are OK.  The music and dancing are outstanding.  The costumes are very colorful.

I enjoy watching actors and actresses early in their careers.  One such person in this movie is Julie Newmar, ""Dorcas"".  She later plays the role of ""Catwoman"" in the 1960s television show ""Bat Man"".  Similarly, Russ Tamblyn, ""Gideon"", later stars in ""West Side Story"".  Like this musical, ""West Side Story"" is loosely based on another story ""Romeo And Juliet"".

Make no mistake about it, I feel this is a very great musical.  However it is very loosely based on ""The Rape of The Sabine Women"".  The abducted women are, of course, not mistreated after the initial abduction.  But as a parent, I would have have been sick, out of my mind, if one of these young ladies was my daughter.  Jane Powell actually states that to Howard Keel.  Howard Keel says it later.  Then the romantic frolic continues.  I suppose I am just over thinking it.  As President Obama once said about himself, I am just an old fuddy duddy.  Thank You...",1487808000,,1212,4.654028436018957

And for some reason there were no rooftop fiddlers to be found. The classic scene of Adam Pottopy's romantic engagement to a girl he had never met before was beyond tender, ""so How 'bout it? how about what? well marryin' me of course... I gotta do my chores first! "" A passionate proposal that can only be compared to the affectionate fantasy proposal of Gaston to Belle.

It's a wonderful movie, but it needs a quality 1080 Blue Ray release, not a so-so quality on-demand release of questionable resolution.  The DVD image actually looks as good or maybe even better than the HD on demand showing. I actually had to reduce the resolution on the desktop from 3840x2160 to 1920x1080 to get the Amazon player software to work.

I don't understand why this movie isn't played on tv as it should it be,  because it is in mind as much as a classic as Gone With The Wind and The Wizard of Oz. I sing and hum the songs from 7B47B more than WoZ! I even wanted so desperately to name my daughter Darkess, but I my (now x) husband said no way! Lol When I was growing up I went through phases of having crushes on all of the brothers and I wanted to be like all of the girls, but mostly Darkess, I think she was my first girl crush. Nevertheless, this movie was and still is amazing to watch and sing along to. I only have 3 wishes about this movie, 1. It should be played more. 2. It needs to be released in Blu-ray form. 3. Last,  but not least, I wish I was Darkess! Lol",1442188800,,813,3.804733727810651

I recommend it because it is a good musical with a strong and steady plot. The dancing is delightful and the singing is intriguing. It's also a colorful movie since technicolor was added. The kids won't mind it. I promise.,1435276800,,353,4.130434782608695

The story is fun and interesting and the acting is top notch. I am honestly surprised it was such a low budget movie when it was produced because it is truly one of the most fantastic movies from it's era. The singing and dancing done throughout is fun and all the brothers incredibly handsome and charming in their own rough way. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves classics and a good musical. If you've never seen it, you are truly missing out on something wonderful.",1434844800,,649,4.2

3052120,4,B000UY6OU6,"Somewhere back in a long ago time, I know I've seen at least the final 10 minutes or so of Seven Brides For Seven Brothers, but I'd never seen the whole thing.  Curiosity finally got the better of me, and I sat down to watch it.  It has some flaws, but there is plenty to make it a fun musical.

In 1850 Oregon, Adam Pontipee (Howard Keel) has decided to take for himself a bride.  So on his next trip to down, he scouts around until he finds Milly (Jane Powell).  Surprisingly, she agrees to marry him that day and return to his farm 12 miles away.

When they return to the farm, Milly discovers much to her surprise that Adam is the oldest of seven brothers, and she is expected to cook and clean for the clan.  She quickly puts a stop to that, making the men clean up their own act.  Soon, the other brothers begin to long for wives of their own, and Milly tries to help them all learn some of the necessary skills.  Will it be enough to help them win brides?

Even if I hadn't caught the ending years ago, the plot of this movie would still be fairly predictable.  It is a romantic comedy, after all.  The large cast of characters makes it impossible to truly get to know anyone super well outside of Adam and Milly.  There are moments of character development, but most of the brothers and their brides are blurs.  Considering the movie runs just over an hour forty minutes, it's not that surprising that character development is the first thing to go.

As I said, the plot is fairly predictable, but the movie is charming along the way.  You can't help but root for the brothers to marry, even when they start doing some pretty stupid things.  Honestly, I would have preferred that there be a tad more development between Adam and Milly at the end to resolve the fallout of his stupidity, but I'll take what is there.  It works, but it could have been better.

One thing I look for in musicals are great song and dance numbers.  Sadly, the dancing is actually pretty minimal through much of the movie.  But the big dance number more than makes up for it.  There's a dance off at a barn raising that is a show stopper and had me grinning the entire time.  And the barn raising that followed is pretty good.  The songs are good, although there is a reason I didn't already know any of them - they aren't super memorable.

The acting mostly works.  You get some over the top or unbelievable moments, but for the most part the performances work for the movie.  Fans of TV's Batman will be interested to note that Julie Newmar, one of the actresses to play Catwoman, plays one of the brides here.

The movie was shot on sound stages, but most of the time they cover it fairly well.  The most obvious time is the scrolling background any time they are on a wagon.

On the other hand, the movie is a feast for the eyes.  The colors and bright and vibrant, especially when the entire cast is in town where they wear bright colors to help us keep them straight from the town folks.

There are lots of issues with the film, but the story is so charming it is easy to ignore them and get sucked into the charm.  That's the reason that Seven Brides For Seven Brothers is still so well-known almost 60 years after it was released.",1432339200,,3223,4.3006644518272426
3052121,5,B000UY6OU6,"A rough and tumble backwoodsman in1850s Oregon heads to town for supplies and a little something extra: a wife.  There he meets the beautiful, spirited Millie who falls in love at first sight, while he appreciates her skill as a cook and is besotted, for him, it is not about love.  When the couple arrive back at Adam's cabin, Millie is shocked to discover that six other rowdy, uncultured brothers occupy the space as well.  Through grit and determination, Millie transforms her brothers-in-law to well-mannered, handsome dandies who go a courting.

Of course, they have many rivals for the lovely women they meet back in town at a barn dance and as winter sets in back at the cabin, cabin fever causes them to concoct a crazy scheme to kidnap their girls they way the ""Romans"" did.

Over time the couples fall in love but not without a mountain of complications,.  A truly feel good musical with a happy ending and optimistic, upbeat tunes.  It  is really nearly two hours of wonderful, marvelous escapism.  A must own!",1432339200,4,1022,4.728813559322034

The music is not at all my style (think cowboy Music Man) and the whole movie is full of crude sexist undertones. Now I understand part of that is the era, but they went too far in my book. Constantly belittling, blaming, corralling of women left a bad taste in my mouth. I laughed through most of it though, because it just seems SO ridiculous, so I will say it has a pinch of comedic value.",1431216000,,560,4.1

3052273,5,B000UY6OU6,"The teaming of Keel and Powell made for a smash hit of a musical movie albeit it was initially a bit slow to take off at the boxoffice.  That said, the chemistry between these two was apparant in every scene.  The supporting cast wasn't shabby either.  This was a showcase for the early careers of Russ Tamblyn, Ruta Lee and Julie Newmar to highlight a few.  It was always a pleasure to watch Ms. Powell in just about any movie she appeared in.  She was not only talented in her singing but she could ""cut a rug"" with some of the best of them including Fred Astaire.  The rich voice of Howard Keel was always nice to listen to and the guy really could act whether it be a comedy role or a serious part.  In his last years when he appeared on the original Dallas, I always found myself waiting to hear him break into song but I don't recall that he ever did.  Another fine classic from the era when there were real actors and roles that were both entertaining and not full of smut.",1416268800,,980,4.2032085561497325

The dance scenes are beyond-belief, and the movie should be seen for just that.  But... this is one of the worst story lines you can imagine.  Kidnapping women kicking and screaming from their homes, shotgun marriages?  Holy smokes.  Hey I love musical theatre and old shows, but this one is as corny, unnatural, and just-plain-weird as it gets.  The music is not very memorable - but - see it for the dance.  Otherwise, it would get one star :(",1402876800,,567,4.554455445544554

3052413,5,B000UY6OU6,"Although MGM didn't think this movie would be successful and allocated a small budget, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers is wonderful. In my opinion, the only indication of low budget was the scenery, which was forced upon them because they didn't have enough money to film on location. The acting, singing, and dancing are superb! I think that the choreographer (Michael Kidd's) concern and concern from others about how to make it believable for backwoodsmen to break out into song and dance actually helped him to make an extra effort to blend in the song and dance routines in a seamless manner, and they are believable . I think that making a great movie on a low budget is much more impressive than making one on a big budget. It takes more effort and creativity. This is definitely my favorite musical of all time!",1398470400,,819,4.694444444444445

I didn't see a warning that their DVD's would only play in certain countries.  Then they went on to tell me that somepeople in the US had the European DVD system that would allow for this.  Ok. really??? How many readers living in the US have that type of unit.  All I wanted was to replace the DVD with one that I can view, even if it's another title, but I was refused.

The choreography by Michael Kidd is wonderful as is the dancing.  Keel and Powell actually used their real voices for the singing.  Jane Powell could do it all.,1397001600,,299,4.285714285714286

3052431,5,B000UY6OU6,"This is, quite simply, one of the best Hollywood musicals of all time, with arguably the most exciting male ensemble dance numbers (choreographed by the great Michael Kidd) ever filmed. Stanley Donen directed (he also co-directed, with Gene Kelly, ""Singin' in the Rain"") with verve, sensitivity, and intelligence.  The catchy songs are by Johnny Mercer and Gene de Paul.  Howard Keel has one of the greatest musical theater baritone voices of all time, does a really fine acting job, and is catnip for women. The story is a guilty pleasure for feminists--  both ""macho"", and spoofing ""macho"", at the same time.  And Jane Powell gives a gutsy and heartfelt performance that is really the heart and soul of this classic film.  Keep an eye out for the great dancer/singer Tommy Rall (Frank), who deserves tons more recognition than he gets for his career in film musicals, a young Jacques D'Amboise (Ephraim; D'Amboise was borrowed for this film from the New York City ballet), and Russ Tamblyn (Gideon; Tamblyn was also in ""West Side Story"" a few years later), who play three of the dancing Pontipee brothers. If you get the chance, also see the featurette movie about ""the making of"" this film, which is part of one of the relatively recent DVDs of it that you can buy, and contains fascinating information.

The fact that MGM and Donen had a limited budget to shoot this film, and couldn't shoot on location in Oregon, actually enhances it.  It places this story firmly in the world of a romanticized fantasy version of the American West--  more real than real.

Not only is this a great musical.  It's also a great American movie--  one of the best of all time--  and as a screenwriter myself I can say it's superbly written.  Gather your kids and watch this classic movie together.",1396051200,,1783,4.768729641693811

3052450,5,B000UY6OU6,"This adorable film is now 60 years old and still it didn't age one little bit. I always liked it a lot and could confirm recently that the old magic still works. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

In the beginning was a short story, ""The sobbin women"", written in 1926 by Stephen Vincent Benet (1898-1943), the man who also gave us the immortal classic ""The devil and Daniel Webster"". The story was immediately spotted as good film material, but for various reasons it took almost 20 years to make a movie from it. As in the meantime films gained the speech and color, this long wait was finally a good thing, as was the idea to change the initial story into a highly humorous musical.

Oregon Territory 1850. Adam Pontipee (Howard Keel), a farmer living in an isolated valley in the mountains, comes to town to trade - and, as in many earlier occasions, also look for a wife... This is a daunting task, because not only single young women are very few (and almost already are spoken for) but he also never can stay longer in town than one day at a time...

But incredibly, this time he will get impossibly lucky - to the greatest annoyance of many a male in the town...))) His brand new wife Milly (Jane Powell), met, courted, won over and married in just one day, will go live with him in the mountains - where she will discover a big bad surprise... in fact, six of them...))) And then the film REALLY begins.

There are many treasures in this film:

- gentle, clever humour. TONS of it!

- great songs. TONS of them!

- one absolutely incredible dance (""The Barn Building Dance""), in which twelve handsome young men and six adorable young ladies play a complicated and merciless courting/mating/fighting ritual, without ever losing their smiles or missing one step (and that even if at one moment a huge axe gets involved) ...)))

- a wonderful lesson in marital logistics, tactics and strategy

- a great lesson about women decisive influence in progress of civilization and culture...)))

- an absolutely unique lecture about early Roman history (with music!)...)))

- one of the most glorious marriage scenes EVER!

Other important reason to LOVE this film is that any feminist exposed to it will instantly screech in pain, then die and desintegrate into dust, as a vampire in full sunlight...)))

Bottom line, this film is an absolute TREASURE, to buy, watch and keep for ever. Enjoy!",1393977600,,2417,4.672169811320755

Call my taste the exception and not the rule, but in my opinion: the ""family-friendliness,"" the musical numbers, and best of all, the non-stop ROWDINESS of the brothers make this movie a very fun time--even for a young guy like ME! The characters are very loveable and the songs get stuck in your head pretty much forever, but it's okay because they're good songs!

3052537,5,B000UY6OU6,"This revue is on the 2 disc special edition DVD. Widescreen. I've had the VHS tape for years and am trying to replace my favorite movies with DVD's. I had read another revue about you see so much more on the widescreen version. That revue was right on the spot. If you don't have this movie in widescreen, you need to get it. On the VHS tape, there is one scene that someone is singing and you can't even see who it is. On the widescreen version, you see it all. The picture on this DVD is really clear and the sound is great. I'm so glad I picked this one. This set also comes with the full screen version included which has the special effects and facts about the movie and the making of it. Also interviews with the actors. Some of the facts are very interesting such as this was one of the first movies made in cinemascope. It was so new, not all theaters had the right size screen to play it so they made a widescreen version in cinemascope and a full screen version at the same time. Two completely separate movies. It was also supposed to be called ""Sobbin Women"", but they thought no one would like the title. Don't want to ruin any surprises for you. This movie is great.

3052600,5,B000UY6OU6,"So its view of the role of women is not PC, so the courtships amount to abduction, so what?  It's fictional fantasy, inoffensive if seen as a period piece.  What matters here is the glorious musical talent: the amazin' Michael Kidd choreography with the dynamically athletic Tommy Ralls [remember Kiss Me Kate?]. the youthful exuberance of Russ Tamblyn [West Side Story], the grace of Matt Maddox and the underutilized NYC Ballet virtuoso Jacques D'Amboise, etc.  The vocals of Jane Powell and Howard Keel complement the sweetness, smartness and verve of Johnny Mercer's lyrics and Gene de Paul's melodies.  The director Stanley Donen is a master.
For film buffs, catch a glimpse of the TV Batman's nemesis played by Julie Newmar (billed here as Julie Newmeyer).  Leave sexual politics behind and sit back and enjoy!",1382659200,,816,5.059701492537314

3052622,5,B000UY6OU6,This is a favorite of my older movies. I just love to watch it over and over. Was sure happy to see it was a choice I could choose,1380931200,,130,3.5172413793103448
3052623,5,B000UY6OU6,"I was looking for something to watch tonight and I noticed Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. I don't know if it was recently added, but I hadn't noticed it on Amazon prime before. I thought, that I would turn it on for just a moment to see how it looked after all these years. I was once again hooked and watched it through to the end for probably the 10th time. It's still as fresh as ever and I have my own ideas why.

Musicals are known for their silly plot lines, and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers is one of the silliest, and it's rather sexist to boot. Then, again, the women teach the men a thing or two and all is forgiven because this film is such a joy to watch. It's full of energy and vitality.

This film is in a rarefied atmosphere: Great musicals written for film rather than adapted from broadway. It is by far Johnny Mercer's most successful film as lyricist. Howard Keel and Jane Powell were huge musical stars. But, these aren't what makes this film great.

It's one of the first musicals filmed in CinemaScope and it is simply beautifully filmed. The great outdoors with the mountains and snow are glorious. While Brigadoon was being filmed at the MGM studios lot, Seven Brides was mostly being filmed on location in Utah. I believe this is one of the reasons Seven Brides was more popular at the time, received more awards, and has stood up to the test of time far better than Brigadoon. Spectacular scenery on a wide-screen is almost always a winner and it buried Brigadoon's fake Scottish highlands in an avalanche.

It's a musical with great songs, but the dancing choreographed by Michael Kidd is the real star. I recognized New York City Ballet's Jacques D'Amboise the first time I saw Seven Brides. I could see that the dancing was spectacular. What I didn't know was that, at Kidd's insistence, Jacques D'Amboise and other dancers were cast as the brothers - with the exception of Russ Tamblyn who was a gymnast, and Jeff Richards, another brother who was a baseball player turned actor. The brides were dancers, too -- including Julie Newmar in her first film (did you know she was trained as a ballet dancer? I didn't until recently.)

Who ever heard of a dance number done with axes? Seven Brides has one.

The real show stopper and the heart of this film is the dancing at the barn-raising. There has never been a dance number filmed with such athleticism and ingenuity before or since. I don't know this to be the case, but watch West Side Story again after watching Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. I'm sure Jerome Robbins must have been influenced by Michael Kidd's choreography.

Whether you're a fan of musicals or not, give Seven Brides for Seven Brothers a try.",1380844800,,2700,4.554639175257732

3052626,5,B000UY6OU6,"As Jane Powell says, this film never goes out of date because it was a period piece to begin with. Loads of fun in the wild north west where a man needs a woman to settle down and work side by side.  Lightly based on the rape of the Sabine women, all the guys get all the girls (eventually) after much fun and singing and dancing.  The dance at the barn raising has to be the best ever and the movie is worth buying just for that ...",1378944000,,433,3.909090909090909

3285869,5,B000UY6OU6,"A funny - and a bit thoughtful - musical fictional piece set during the gold rush era when 'wife material' was difficult/almost impossible to find. The lead actor has been in several musicals. Two that come to mind he acted opposite to Debbie Reynolds (she can DANCE and SING!) and played the part of a gambling establishment owner in ""Paint Your Wagon"". Some scenes seem to 'drag', only because the concepts of cinematography and screen play writing was of a different mindset in the post war decades (more dialogue and no CG). I love the barn raising scene with the dancing and the fight that ensues due to the ""male strutting"" competition for a mate! Hey, I am NOT giving away the ending! Which, by the way, is hilarious! Enjoy this movie treat!

3285970,5,B000UY6OU6,"I remember watching this movie while in elementary school. It's a musical, about 7 brothers that are woodsmen looking to get married. the issue is finding their soon to be wives. there is only one small country town and all of the single women already had other guys courting them. it is a fun and simple movie. no bad language, no heavy violence (one or 2 bumps) I think it was made in 1954.",1512950400,,392,4.3108108108108105
3285971,5,B000UY6OU6,"Howard Keel plays Adam, the older of seven brothers who decides to marry Jane Powell's character Milly, since he needs a housekeeper and cook to help care for him and his six backwoods brother. Poor Milly goes along, thinking she's going to live happily ever after with Adam, alone in a house of her own. Once she gets over the shock of learning she's basically a maid and cook, she digs in and becomes a mother figure to her new family. Things get crazy after that, but everything works out in the end.

3286095,5,B000UY6OU6,"This movie musical hasn't lost a bit of its sparkle despite its age! Almost 70 years young, ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" is a delightful romp with dazzling dance sequences and witty repartee that never lags.  I'm not a fan of musicals as a general rule - so many are downright dumb and/or silly - but this is a true golden oldie in every sense of the word.  The songs are a hoot, the production design a reminder of the magic Hollywood used to achieve on a studio backlot, and a reminder of why MGM once reigned supreme for movie musicals.

MGM's Sidney Guilaroff (hairstylist), Walter Plunkett (costume designer) and William Tuttle (makeup) remind us why their names are still remembered today as the finest in their fields.  The film wasn't granted the budget to film on location, and made do with the artificial sets on MGM's backlot.  Yes, it looks fake....but no more so than modern movies with their CG arcade-game-appearances.  Viewers are reminded of what Hollywood's golden era turned out and why these films are still relevant today.  Modern audiences will remember Howard Keel from ""Dallas"" in the 1980s, and Julie Newmar (credited here as Newmeyer) as Catwoman.

""7 Brides for 7 Brothers"" is simply fun.  Well worth adding to your DVD collection as a date night, party night, film study or a late-night tv romp.  LOVED IT!",1489708800,,1339,4.782608695652174

3286119,4,B000UY6OU6,"This is an excellent musical from the early 1950s during the golden age of Hollywood musicals.  It stars Howard Keel and Jane Powell.  It is about men in the Oregon back country seeking wives.  The songs are OK.  The music and dancing are outstanding.  The costumes are very colorful.

I enjoy watching actors and actresses early in their careers.  One such person in this movie is Julie Newmar, ""Dorcas"".  She later plays the role of ""Catwoman"" in the 1960s television show ""Bat Man"".  Similarly, Russ Tamblyn, ""Gideon"", later stars in ""West Side Story"".  Like this musical, ""West Side Story"" is loosely based on another story ""Romeo And Juliet"".

Make no mistake about it, I feel this is a very great musical.  However it is very loosely based on ""The Rape of The Sabine Women"".  The abducted women are, of course, not mistreated after the initial abduction.  But as a parent, I would have have been sick, out of my mind, if one of these young ladies was my daughter.  Jane Powell actually states that to Howard Keel.  Howard Keel says it later.  Then the romantic frolic continues.  I suppose I am just over thinking it.  As President Obama once said about himself, I am just an old fuddy duddy.  Thank You...",1487808000,,1212,4.654028436018957

And for some reason there were no rooftop fiddlers to be found. The classic scene of Adam Pottopy's romantic engagement to a girl he had never met before was beyond tender, ""so How 'bout it? how about what? well marryin' me of course... I gotta do my chores first! "" A passionate proposal that can only be compared to the affectionate fantasy proposal of Gaston to Belle. ""This is the day your dreams come true..."" today is the day you get to marry me...",1469750400,,631,4.592920353982301

I don't understand why this movie isn't played on tv as it should it be,  because it is in mind as much as a classic as Gone With The Wind and The Wizard of Oz. I sing and hum the songs from 7B47B more than WoZ! I even wanted so desperately to name my daughter Darkess, but I my (now x) husband said no way! Lol When I was growing up I went through phases of having crushes on all of the brothers and I wanted to be like all of the girls, but mostly Darkess, I think she was my first girl crush. Nevertheless, this movie was and still is amazing to watch and sing along to. I only have 3 wishes about this movie, 1. It should be played more. 2. It needs to be released in Blu-ray form. 3. Last,  but not least, I wish I was Darkess! Lol",1442188800,,813,3.804733727810651

3286617,4,B000UY6OU6,"Somewhere back in a long ago time, I know I've seen at least the final 10 minutes or so of Seven Brides For Seven Brothers, but I'd never seen the whole thing.  Curiosity finally got the better of me, and I sat down to watch it.  It has some flaws, but there is plenty to make it a fun musical.

In 1850 Oregon, Adam Pontipee (Howard Keel) has decided to take for himself a bride.  So on his next trip to down, he scouts around until he finds Milly (Jane Powell).  Surprisingly, she agrees to marry him that day and return to his farm 12 miles away.

When they return to the farm, Milly discovers much to her surprise that Adam is the oldest of seven brothers, and she is expected to cook and clean for the clan.  She quickly puts a stop to that, making the men clean up their own act.  Soon, the other brothers begin to long for wives of their own, and Milly tries to help them all learn some of the necessary skills.  Will it be enough to help them win brides?

Even if I hadn't caught the ending years ago, the plot of this movie would still be fairly predictable.  It is a romantic comedy, after all.  The large cast of characters makes it impossible to truly get to know anyone super well outside of Adam and Milly.  There are moments of character development, but most of the brothers and their brides are blurs.  Considering the movie runs just over an hour forty minutes, it's not that surprising that character development is the first thing to go.

As I said, the plot is fairly predictable, but the movie is charming along the way.  You can't help but root for the brothers to marry, even when they start doing some pretty stupid things.  Honestly, I would have preferred that there be a tad more development between Adam and Milly at the end to resolve the fallout of his stupidity, but I'll take what is there.  It works, but it could have been better.

One thing I look for in musicals are great song and dance numbers.  Sadly, the dancing is actually pretty minimal through much of the movie.  But the big dance number more than makes up for it.  There's a dance off at a barn raising that is a show stopper and had me grinning the entire time.  And the barn raising that followed is pretty good.  The songs are good, although there is a reason I didn't already know any of them - they aren't super memorable.

The acting mostly works.  You get some over the top or unbelievable moments, but for the most part the performances work for the movie.  Fans of TV's Batman will be interested to note that Julie Newmar, one of the actresses to play Catwoman, plays one of the brides here.

The movie was shot on sound stages, but most of the time they cover it fairly well.  The most obvious time is the scrolling background any time they are on a wagon.

On the other hand, the movie is a feast for the eyes.  The colors and bright and vibrant, especially when the entire cast is in town where they wear bright colors to help us keep them straight from the town folks.

There are lots of issues with the film, but the story is so charming it is easy to ignore them and get sucked into the charm.  That's the reason that Seven Brides For Seven Brothers is still so well-known almost 60 years after it was released.",1432339200,,3223,4.3006644518272426
3286618,5,B000UY6OU6,"A rough and tumble backwoodsman in1850s Oregon heads to town for supplies and a little something extra: a wife.  There he meets the beautiful, spirited Millie who falls in love at first sight, while he appreciates her skill as a cook and is besotted, for him, it is not about love.  When the couple arrive back at Adam's cabin, Millie is shocked to discover that six other rowdy, uncultured brothers occupy the space as well.  Through grit and determination, Millie transforms her brothers-in-law to well-mannered, handsome dandies who go a courting.

Of course, they have many rivals for the lovely women they meet back in town at a barn dance and as winter sets in back at the cabin, cabin fever causes them to concoct a crazy scheme to kidnap their girls they way the ""Romans"" did.

Over time the couples fall in love but not without a mountain of complications,.  A truly feel good musical with a happy ending and optimistic, upbeat tunes.  It  is really nearly two hours of wonderful, marvelous escapism.  A must own!",1432339200,4,1022,4.728813559322034
3286619,5,B000UY6OU6,I'm not much of a musical kind of guy but this has themes and comedy that has an appeal to grown men that don't care for the genre. It was one of my mom's favorite movies... one of the few we could watch together.,1432252800,,213,3.8636363636363638

3286629,1,B000UY6OU6,"A lot of my friends were astounded that 21 year old musical loving me hadn't seen this yet, so I decided it was time to watch this 'classic'. Truth be told, I hate it. The music is not at all my style (think cowboy Music Man) and the whole movie is full of crude sexist undertones. Now I understand part of that is the era, but they went too far in my book. Constantly belittling, blaming, corralling of women left a bad taste in my mouth. I laughed through most of it though, because it just seems SO ridiculous, so I will say it has a pinch of comedic value.",1431216000,,560,4.1

3286770,5,B000UY6OU6,"The teaming of Keel and Powell made for a smash hit of a musical movie albeit it was initially a bit slow to take off at the boxoffice.  That said, the chemistry between these two was apparant in every scene.  The supporting cast wasn't shabby either.  This was a showcase for the early careers of Russ Tamblyn, Ruta Lee and Julie Newmar to highlight a few.  It was always a pleasure to watch Ms. Powell in just about any movie she appeared in.  She was not only talented in her singing but she could ""cut a rug"" with some of the best of them including Fred Astaire.  The rich voice of Howard Keel was always nice to listen to and the guy really could act whether it be a comedy role or a serious part.  In his last years when he appeared on the original Dallas, I always found myself waiting to hear him break into song but I don't recall that he ever did.  Another fine classic from the era when there were real actors and roles that were both entertaining and not full of smut.",1416268800,,980,4.2032085561497325

The dance scenes are beyond-belief, and the movie should be seen for just that.  But... this is one of the worst story lines you can imagine.  Kidnapping women kicking and screaming from their homes, shotgun marriages?  Holy smokes.  Hey I love musical theatre and old shows, but this one is as corny, unnatural, and just-plain-weird as it gets.  The music is not very memorable - but - see it for the dance.

3286910,5,B000UY6OU6,"Although MGM didn't think this movie would be successful and allocated a small budget, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers is wonderful. In my opinion, the only indication of low budget was the scenery, which was forced upon them because they didn't have enough money to film on location. The acting, singing, and dancing are superb! I think that the choreographer (Michael Kidd's) concern and concern from others about how to make it believable for backwoodsmen to break out into song and dance actually helped him to make an extra effort to blend in the song and dance routines in a seamless manner, and they are believable . I think that making a great movie on a low budget is much more impressive than making one on a big budget. It takes more effort and creativity. This is definitely my favorite musical of all time!",1398470400,,819,4.694444444444445

I didn't see a warning that their DVD's would only play in certain countries.  Then they went on to tell me that somepeople in the US had the European DVD system that would allow for this.  Ok. really??? How many readers living in the US have that type of unit.  All I wanted was to replace the DVD with one that I can view, even if it's another title, but I was refused.

3286928,5,B000UY6OU6,"This is, quite simply, one of the best Hollywood musicals of all time, with arguably the most exciting male ensemble dance numbers (choreographed by the great Michael Kidd) ever filmed. Stanley Donen directed (he also co-directed, with Gene Kelly, ""Singin' in the Rain"") with verve, sensitivity, and intelligence.  The catchy songs are by Johnny Mercer and Gene de Paul.  Howard Keel has one of the greatest musical theater baritone voices of all time, does a really fine acting job, and is catnip for women. The story is a guilty pleasure for feminists--  both ""macho"", and spoofing ""macho"", at the same time.  And Jane Powell gives a gutsy and heartfelt performance that is really the heart and soul of this classic film.  Keep an eye out for the great dancer/singer Tommy Rall (Frank), who deserves tons more recognition than he gets for his career in film musicals, a young Jacques D'Amboise (Ephraim; D'Amboise was borrowed for this film from the New York City ballet), and Russ Tamblyn (Gideon; Tamblyn was also in ""West Side Story"" a few years later), who play three of the dancing Pontipee brothers. If you get the chance, also see the featurette movie about ""the making of"" this film, which is part of one of the relatively recent DVDs of it that you can buy, and contains fascinating information.

The fact that MGM and Donen had a limited budget to shoot this film, and couldn't shoot on location in Oregon, actually enhances it.  It places this story firmly in the world of a romanticized fantasy version of the American West--  more real than real.

Not only is this a great musical.  It's also a great American movie--  one of the best of all time--  and as a screenwriter myself I can say it's superbly written.  Gather your kids and watch this classic movie together.",1396051200,,1783,4.768729641693811

The sound-stage did have some very nice scenery, but it wasn't difficult to see that some parts were background.  It still is one of my favorites.  I usually watch it once a year.",1393977600,2,295,4.490566037735849
3286947,5,B000UY6OU6,"This adorable film is now 60 years old and still it didn't age one little bit. I always liked it a lot and could confirm recently that the old magic still works. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

In the beginning was a short story, ""The sobbin women"", written in 1926 by Stephen Vincent Benet (1898-1943), the man who also gave us the immortal classic ""The devil and Daniel Webster"". The story was immediately spotted as good film material, but for various reasons it took almost 20 years to make a movie from it. As in the meantime films gained the speech and color, this long wait was finally a good thing, as was the idea to change the initial story into a highly humorous musical.

Oregon Territory 1850. Adam Pontipee (Howard Keel), a farmer living in an isolated valley in the mountains, comes to town to trade - and, as in many earlier occasions, also look for a wife... This is a daunting task, because not only single young women are very few (and almost already are spoken for) but he also never can stay longer in town than one day at a time...

But incredibly, this time he will get impossibly lucky - to the greatest annoyance of many a male in the town...))) His brand new wife Milly (Jane Powell), met, courted, won over and married in just one day, will go live with him in the mountains - where she will discover a big bad surprise... in fact, six of them...))) And then the film REALLY begins.

There are many treasures in this film:

- gentle, clever humour. TONS of it!

- great songs. TONS of them!

- one absolutely incredible dance (""The Barn Building Dance""), in which twelve handsome young men and six adorable young ladies play a complicated and merciless courting/mating/fighting ritual, without ever losing their smiles or missing one step (and that even if at one moment a huge axe gets involved) ...)))

- a wonderful lesson in marital logistics, tactics and strategy

- a great lesson about women decisive influence in progress of civilization and culture...)))

- an absolutely unique lecture about early Roman history (with music!)...)))

- one of the most glorious marriage scenes EVER!

Other important reason to LOVE this film is that any feminist exposed to it will instantly screech in pain, then die and desintegrate into dust, as a vampire in full sunlight...)))

Bottom line, this film is an absolute TREASURE, to buy, watch and keep for ever. Enjoy!",1393977600,,2417,4.672169811320755

When it became available on DVD I purchased it and I must say it is even better than the first time I saw it in the theatre!  The music came through.  Don't know where it was filmed, but since it was supposed to take place in Oregon and that's my home state, I'll claim that it could have been filmed there because of the fantastic scenery.  I realize that most of it took place on a sound-stage, but the effects looked very natural.",1392681600,,546,4.113207547169812

3287034,5,B000UY6OU6,"This revue is on the 2 disc special edition DVD. Widescreen. I've had the VHS tape for years and am trying to replace my favorite movies with DVD's. I had read another revue about you see so much more on the widescreen version. That revue was right on the spot. If you don't have this movie in widescreen, you need to get it. On the VHS tape, there is one scene that someone is singing and you can't even see who it is. On the widescreen version, you see it all. The picture on this DVD is really clear and the sound is great. I'm so glad I picked this one. This set also comes with the full screen version included which has the special effects and facts about the movie and the making of it. Also interviews with the actors. Some of the facts are very interesting such as this was one of the first movies made in cinemascope. It was so new, not all theaters had the right size screen to play it so they made a widescreen version in cinemascope and a full screen version at the same time. Two completely separate movies. It was also supposed to be called ""Sobbin Women"", but they thought no one would like the title. Don't want to ruin any surprises for you. This movie is great. You won't be sorry if you are a fan of it or if you are a fan of musicals.",1388880000,,1255,4.126530612244898

3287120,5,B000UY6OU6,"I was looking for something to watch tonight and I noticed Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. I don't know if it was recently added, but I hadn't noticed it on Amazon prime before. I thought, that I would turn it on for just a moment to see how it looked after all these years. I was once again hooked and watched it through to the end for probably the 10th time. It's still as fresh as ever and I have my own ideas why.

Musicals are known for their silly plot lines, and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers is one of the silliest, and it's rather sexist to boot. Then, again, the women teach the men a thing or two and all is forgiven because this film is such a joy to watch. It's full of energy and vitality.

This film is in a rarefied atmosphere: Great musicals written for film rather than adapted from broadway. It is by far Johnny Mercer's most successful film as lyricist. Howard Keel and Jane Powell were huge musical stars. But, these aren't what makes this film great.

It's one of the first musicals filmed in CinemaScope and it is simply beautifully filmed. The great outdoors with the mountains and snow are glorious. While Brigadoon was being filmed at the MGM studios lot, Seven Brides was mostly being filmed on location in Utah. I believe this is one of the reasons Seven Brides was more popular at the time, received more awards, and has stood up to the test of time far better than Brigadoon. Spectacular scenery on a wide-screen is almost always a winner and it buried Brigadoon's fake Scottish highlands in an avalanche.

It's a musical with great songs, but the dancing choreographed by Michael Kidd is the real star. I recognized New York City Ballet's Jacques D'Amboise the first time I saw Seven Brides. I could see that the dancing was spectacular. What I didn't know was that, at Kidd's insistence, Jacques D'Amboise and other dancers were cast as the brothers - with the exception of Russ Tamblyn who was a gymnast, and Jeff Richards, another brother who was a baseball player turned actor. The brides were dancers, too -- including Julie Newmar in her first film (did you know she was trained as a ballet dancer? I didn't until recently.)

Who ever heard of a dance number done with axes? Seven Brides has one.

The real show stopper and the heart of this film is the dancing at the barn-raising. There has never been a dance number filmed with such athleticism and ingenuity before or since. I don't know this to be the case, but watch West Side Story again after watching Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. I'm sure Jerome Robbins must have been influenced by Michael Kidd's choreography.

Whether you're a fan of musicals or not, give Seven Brides for Seven Brothers a try.",1380844800,,2700,4.554639175257732

3287123,5,B000UY6OU6,"As Jane Powell says, this film never goes out of date because it was a period piece to begin with. Loads of fun in the wild north west where a man needs a woman to settle down and work side by side.  Lightly based on the rape of the Sabine women, all the guys get all the girls (eventually) after much fun and singing and dancing.  The dance at the barn raising has to be the best ever and the movie is worth buying just for that ...",1378944000,,433,3.909090909090909
