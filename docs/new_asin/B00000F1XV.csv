1201783,5,B00000F1XV,"This is such a beautiful movie, as true today as it was then.  My mother nearly died in the flu pandemic of 1918, and told me about those times in great detail.  My brother and I suffered from measles and whooping cough in the early 40s, and our house was quarantined by the city.  Being a child during WWII, I can still identify with many elements of this DVD.  Everything moved at such a leisurely pace that it must have seemed that time stood still, especially for the kids.  I remember feeling this way growing up in a small town.  If you are looking for a movie that moves at breakneck speed, then don't buy this one.  But, if you are contemplative and have many memories of the past that you wish to relive, this is the movie for you.  I intend to watch it again and again.  It is truly a story of a world that no longer exists.  That makes me sad, especially for our children.",1095724800,41,883,4.2023809523809526
1201784,5,B00000F1XV,I've revisited this film often.  It's feel for life in a small Texas town is letter perfect. Hallie Foote is wonderful. The scene where she tells of her daughter's death moves me to tears every time I've seen it.,1003363200,6,212,4.435897435897436

1201922,2,B00000F1XV,The main problem I had with this movie is that it was dated. I was hoping to gather more insight on how influenza affected their lives. This movie is probably fine for showing to a 6 grade class but don't expect any great revelations.,1461715200,,234,4.340909090909091

The second star is for costumes, hair & set design, which appear authentic. WWI & Spanish flu authentic issues, but melodramatic coverage at best. Disappointing.

1201930,2,B00000F1XV,"1918, 1985 film

It begins in Harrison Texas in the fall of 1918. Young men march on the street. People talk about their soldiers. Volunteer women fold bandages for the war effort and talk about the war effort. A man talks about putting a marker on a grave. Everybody is getting the flu says a cemetery worker. The newspaper said the Allies reached the Dutch frontier (a neutral country). The Allies talk about soldiers who are ill (shell-shocked). A young man repeats a rumor. Another gets a chance to join the Army. People buy Liberty Bonds to help the war effort, a man gets a chance to join the Army. Why does Poppa interfere? The youngest son lost $75 in a card game, and needs to send $100 to a girl friend. He has troubles, his sister gives him $200. Ill never forget this.

The doctor makes a house call, he is very sick. Horace is given medicine and told to rest. His fever affects him. There is another coffin for the graveyard. Relatives take care of the sick. Elizabeth lost her young child. People hear good news: the Great War ended. There is a celebration, shots are fired, a band plays music. Horace recovers. Elizabeth expects another child. In the winter of 1918 returning soldiers parade in the street to a welcome (these are not the overseas troops). [Note the sound effects of a sound train like other events.] Then its Spring 1919. Elizabeth will have her baby any day now. [They didn't use midwives?] What will its name be? Bessie visits Elizabeth, who talks about her feelings. The doctor arrives, Horace will walk Bessie home. He returns to see the baby, Horace Jr.

This is based on a stage play. It tells about the lives of one family in 1918. What was its purpose? It seems pointless to me, but some may like it. Note how sound effects replace actual events (bands, steam train, etc.). There are no wires for electricity, but no kerosene lanterns either. People then woke at dawn and bedded down at sunset. You hear the sound of chickens but see no small animals, not even dogs or cats. You hear gunshots but see no firearms - in Texas.",1447372800,,2064,4.5133689839572195
1201931,1,B00000F1XV,Like going to a high school play.  Everybody said their lines but there was no feeling to it.,1445472000,,93,4.166666666666667
1201981,4,B00000F1XV,Here is an interesting window onto a world we know too little of: Life in a small Texas town at the tail end of WWI.  The characters are well cast and the story a quiet telling. The production values are a little on the sparse side but still realistic enough that most would never notice.  It ran particularly with me because my own grandfather died of the Spanish Flu in 1918.  I enjoyed the movie.,1439769600,3,399,4.293333333333333

1202062,1,B00000F1XV,"The year 1918 was certainly a traumatic one for America, given WWI and the flu epidemic. However, I couldn't stand the first fifteen minutes or so of this film and did not finish it.",1403136000,2,182,4.382352941176471

1202149,5,B00000F1XV,This period piece is my cup of tea.  It gave an insightful glimpse of the social mores of 1918 .  I like how well it was written and I  especially appreciate how the actors made  their characters come alive.  They all did a superb job.  Time well spent!,1392508800,,253,4.166666666666667

1202155,5,B00000F1XV,The content was just what I expected and gave the facts and history for this period of time. The aristocracy was declining and moving away from the Edwardian Era due to the war and relaxing of social values and entertainment.,1371168000,,225,4.65
1202156,1,B00000F1XV,i gave this away.  boring.........no scientific data at all.......just a sweet slow moving boring story.  Kinda like the waltons version of the plague.,1368835200,,151,5.521739130434782
1202157,5,B00000F1XV,"The film is set during the outbreak of the 1918-1919 flu epidemic that swept much of the world after the first world war.  This is a great film.  It is quiet and understated, but, for those with the eyes to see, profoundly insightful.",1355961600,5,234,4.4186046511627906
1202158,5,B00000F1XV,"It is hard to believe in this day and age that there was a time when people went about their lives so quietly.  If you have seen ""Courtship"" and ""Valentine's Day"" you know Horace and Elizabeth, the Vaughns and the various people who live in Harrison, Texas so you must see ""1918"" to know what becomes of them.  The flu is raging through the town, the war is winding down and Brother Vaughn spends most of his time at the movies watching war pictures as he romantisizes about enlisting. Even hough there is tragedy, the story continues to be hopeful giving the viewer a wonderful sense that all will be well.  Horton Foote tells a sweet story without sentimentality.  The cast belongs in these stories.  They could not be more perfect.",1347667200,3,734,4.572519083969466

1202231,5,B00000F1XV,please see lola's review of on valentine's day. 1918 was particularly unique in that it dealt in part with the spanish influenza epidemic.,1290384000,,138,5.043478260869565
1202232,5,B00000F1XV,"This story follows a family during the year 1918 at the ending of World War I and through the flu epidemic that swept the world that year.

1202236,5,B00000F1XV,"Horton Foote is a playwright and screenwriter of the gentlest, most powerful kind. His beginnings in small town Texas has informed most all of his writing ever since. He has written for broadway, live television and hollywood. He wrote the amazing screenplay for ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" based on Harper Lee's book. He wrote the films ""Tender Mercies"" and ""Trip to Bountiful"" (based on his play) He's won the Pultzer Prize for his play ""Young Man From Atlanta"" (1995). Many of his plays have ended up on video/dvd and ""1918"" is one of them.

There is a series of plays written by Mr. Foote called ""The Orphan's Home Cycle"". Nine terrific plays, gentle and rewarding individually...put them together and you have a gorgeous epic that spans decades. The plays follow a boy named Horace from childhood to adulthood.

The middle three plays of this cycle are: ""Courtship"", ""Valentine's Day"" and ""1918"" and are all on DVD and available on Amazon.

""1918"" takes place in a small Texas town during the outbreak of the infamous influenzia epidemic and the comings and goings of soldiers during World War I.  It picks up a short time after ""On Valentine's Day"" ends.  Elizabeth and Horace have a child and the family is reunited.  But as the sickness of the epidemic and the insidious mutilations of the war casulties all come closer to the their doorstep, Horace is faced with decisions beyond his grasp.  Trying to come to terms with his ""orphan"" status and new family.  The delicate way the subjects of love, danger, security and family roam in and out of the dialouge is very moving.

""1918"" stands alone as an amazing timepiece. Put the film together as the finale with the previous chapters: ""Courtship"" and ""On Valentine's Day"" and you have an amazing statement of life in small town America from 1915 to World War I. You have a dramatic poem about love and endurance. You also have an important document of Amercan theater by having a record of this great playwright's work come to life.

The same wonderful cast is in all three films, offering great continuity of performance and sparse, tender storytelling.

1202238,5,B00000F1XV,"This movie is one of the most beautiful films I've seen. The evocation of this particular place in this particular time is the best I've ever seen in a film. Something as mundane as practising the piano crystalizes into a moment captured in time that stays with the viewer long after the movie has ended. The canvas of sound used in the film creates a reality so real you are a part of that moment in time portrayed in the movie.

The astounding gentleness and compassion with which Horton Foote presents the people in this town brings tears to my eyes even as I think of it. Not only is this time a forgotten one by many. It is a time of caring and innocence that no longer exists in our country. There is a heroic approach to life these people embody that comes from a sincere sense of right and wrong, duty, and faith. Yet, there is no poliical agenda that motivates their actions. They act out of their realization that as humans we are all connected and that connection is worth fighting for even when it is not easy. They are not perfect. And, because of their imperfections we come to love and care for them.

I rewatch this film whenever I want to wash the hypocrisy and hatred of our own time from off my spirit. This is a film I wish more people were aware of. I cannot believe it is not on dvd yet. If ever our country needed an example of courage and compassion, it is now.",1140566400,31,1385,4.262357414448669
1202239,5,B00000F1XV,"Set in a rural Texas town near the end of WW I, the flu epidemic of that year is raging. The movie attempts to capture, in great detail, the tribulations of a family at this period of time: the war in Europe, the influenza, and their everyday routines. Death seems everywhere. A great deal of trouble went into getting the details of the setting absolutely authentic. It's a poignant movie, and we can identify and feel for the characters: the husband (William Converse-Roberts) and wife (Hallie Foote) who lose their 8-month-old child to the flu, and the 17-year-old brother (Matthew Broderick) who wants nothing but to go fight in Europe before it's all over.

The script sounds like the writer was doing a term paper on ""foreshadowing."" Awkward and ham-fishted references to what was coming. The acting seemed to be a parody of Southerners of the time. Awful accents and such stereotypes. A Southerner myself, I found myself cringing. The 1918 flu epidemic has lots of potential for an exciting and powerful drama.
