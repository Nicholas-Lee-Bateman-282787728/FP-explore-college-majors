8426335,5,B004E0ZT44,Awesome Man Don't Leave Me Hanging! I need the guys to go back for Joel!,1453852800,,72,3.8666666666666667
8426336,3,B004E0ZT44,"I'm a fan of Marc Warren (Hustle, State of Play, Band of Brothers); John Simm (State of Play, Life on Mars, The Lakes) and Philip Glenister (Clocking Off, Life on Mars, Ashes to Ashes) so ordered this first (of four) series from Sky in 2010.  I'm not a fantasy buff;  Life on Mars and Ashes to Ashes are not my cup of tea so much of the detail in these four episodes seemed too silly.  But, unfortunately, it was interesting enough for me to press on with the next series . . .",1441670400,,477,4.10752688172043
8426337,4,B004E0ZT44,"This series starts off a little slow, in fact you could probably skip most of the first episode as the story really only kicks off when ""Tony Blair"" shows up in the final minutes of episode one.  The remaining episodes though are a lot more fun as your traditional we've been framed for a murder and for only believable in a movie paranoia reasons can't go to the police or just get on a plane and leave.  This is sort of reminded me of the Hangover, with four guys in their forties who were friends once but haven't been in each others lives for quite some time suddenly having to work together to stay alive and avoid the police (who might also be corrupt, led by a beautiful flirty but still a cop detective), as well as the mafia and other underworld people they have inadvertently wronged by simply being in the wrong place due to the actions of a friend they came to visit.

There are some minor things that let it down apart from the whole wouldn't you just go straight to the airport and leave.  A large part of the plot revolves around a borrowed boat, yet they are on an island, so surely those interested in the boat's whereabouts could just get another boat and circumnavigate the island to find it.  Other than that though it's a pretty fun normal guys suddenly thrust into a world they don't belong to or want to be in tale.  If you liked the Hangover you'll probably like this.  Combined all the episodes go for just under three hours. So other then credits appearing a few times, it's like watching a long movie.

This is a UK show set on a Spanish island.  Of course like all successful shows not made in the US, the US in 2015 has a US cast remake.  It will be interesting to see if it will work or if like other shows they won't have worked out why the original works.",1431993600,,1787,4.275964391691395
8426338,3,B004E0ZT44,"I love British shows.  I don't own a TV and live on the mysteries from across the pond.  Simm, Glenister, and Beesley (The Last Enemy) are excellent actors and Warren has been great in LoM, State of Play.

And you put them all together and thump.  I just finished 1 & 2 and was left thinking it
If they threw in a super hero it wouldn't have been less realistic.  Yet, the acting and dialogue is outstanding.  It is the continual decision process that constantly bury them deeper and deeper and then in the second series it just becomes ridiculous.
The acting is great, the story not so much.",1428883200,,592,4.385321100917431
8426339,5,B004E0ZT44,Love this! But sorry to learn there will be no more epsisodes!!  I am not happy with Amazon prime that just starts a show with one season or worse one episode then that's it!,1424390400,,174,4.117647058823529
8426340,5,B004E0ZT44,"It's great so far , I only seen episode 1",1422057600,,41,3.2
8426341,4,B004E0ZT44,"This has sort of been done before.  Old friends that have drifted apart and are from different economic backgrounds, get together for a reunion of sorts away from their significant others.

Great cast, character evolution and the 3-G's (Guns, Girls & Ganja (replace ganja with something stronger) make this work and has already spawned a series (season) 2.

One of my favorite lines: after ""finding"" a case of large denomination Euros (obviously, destined for a narcotics transaction), change for a 500-Euro note is requested at a local establishment and the waiter states, ""no"", only drug dealers use 500-Euro Notes!

This is one of those series that builds up to the breaking point and has you wondering what is going to happen next!",1336521600,2,735,5.0
8426342,4,B004E0ZT44,"Mad Dogs is a four part series about four long time friends from England heading over to Majorca, Spain to visit their recently retired friend Alvo(Ben Chaplin) for a holiday of a life time! Alvo has paid for all their flights, taxi's and will put them up in his large Villa, it seems that the ""property business"" has been good to Alvo and it's going to be a reunion to remember for all five!

Of course that would be to simple, as is evident from the opening scene in which the four mates Baxter(John Simm), Rick(Marc Warren), Woody(Max Beesley) and Quinn(Philip Glenister) are seeing recording messages for loved one's that all has not gone well in the reunion.

The one thing for sure is if there is trouble to be found, these guys will find it, in each episode they get deeper and deeper in to trouble. Not knowing Who to trust they begin to take it out on each other, In episode one Alvo is seen belittling all his friends that their lives are a mess and he has the perfect life!

Mad Dogs is a British gangster series, so expect dead bodies, drugs, guns and bit of everything else. It's been compared to British gangster movie Sexy Beast and there are some similarities between the two. John Simm(Baxter) and Philip Glenister(Quinn) do provide some strong acting compared to Max Beesley(Woody) who just seems like a spoilt brat. Mara Botto who plays Spanish Cop Mara also turns in a fine performance and you can never be sure what side of the law she's on.

This is a good series and their is rumours of a second series, the script is good, there is some good humour thrown in and there is some real tense moments throughout. With a lack of good British series lately Mad Dogs is a welcome addition.",1327017600,10,1705,4.472668810289389
