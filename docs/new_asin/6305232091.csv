7887163,4,6305232091,The video is in great shape and I really love this movie.  If you want a good clean romance then get this movie because it is great.  I think just as good as Sleepless in Seattle.,1368748800,,179,3.9444444444444446
7887164,5,6305232091,"I saw this movie on cable and just had to buy it.  It is a great love story.  I loved the scene when Jimmie is waiting for Taylor after he gets out of the hospital.  When he sees her coming home with Scott in the morning he thinks she has spent the night with him.  The emotions he shows are wonderful when he tries to leave, but comes back.  You can tell he is so confused.  It is great!!!!....",982540800,7,395,3.9367088607594938
