8124143,3,B000FKP1XG,"Not a bad Bio of the great Phil Silvers, but it should have included a few scenes from the film of the stage show the title was taken from, 'Top Banana', otherwise quite an interesting look at the man forever associated with 'Sgt. Bilko' from his famous television series. A man who more than once found himself ruining his life and family because of a life long gambling addiction, he was perhaps more like 'Bilko' than he'd care to let on, however, faults aside, Silvers was undoubtedly one of the great vaudevillian style comedians, who succeded in translating his talent to the big and small screen for over 40 years. He deserves to be remembered!",1245542400,2,651,4.6695652173913045
