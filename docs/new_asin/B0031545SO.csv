4048075,5,B0031545SO,"The tension in this series is almost unbearable.  I make up my mind as I grow through the series which Chefs I can't possible tolerate winning.  As the show draws to a close, I actually get to the state that if the person I want to win would get eliminated I am not sure I could finish the series.  Fortunately, in the first two, I was spot on.  The Chef is very rough on the would-be Chefs but the education they are getting is worth it's weight in gold.  I enjoy all of his series though I myself am just a would be cook.  However, his ""The F Word"" series certainly makes me want to try to better my times in the kitchen.",1309564800,,623,4.024390243902439

Gordon Ramsay is great.  This is a good season of Hell's Kitchen.",1268611200,,76,4.357142857142857

4048080,5,B0031545SO,Gordon Ramsay knows how to command a kitchen and run his troops!  This makes dining out a whole new experience when you have an idea of what goes on back in the kitchen.  Language may be somewhat rough for some small ears but we love not having all those annoying beeps! I waited for so long for this second season to be on DVD! Very entertaining!,1267056000,2,347,4.242424242424242
4048081,5,B0031545SO,"Fair warning this is chock full of spoilers!!  Wow......  I have only started watching the last 3 or 4 seasons so I decided to buy season 1 and 2 since I love the show so much.  In the more recent seasons, Chef Ramsey has been very much the family man even having his wife on last season and any woman that flirts with him is bam, gone, voted off! He had become someone I could admire as a person.  Now I have just watched most of season 2 and so much becomes obvious.  Virginia, the runner up couldn't cook her way out of a paper bag and yet she kept winning the individual challenges and in spite of the fact that her team mates kept putting her up trying to get rid of her dead weight Chef Ramsey kept saving her.  What was most shocking, though was the blatent flirting and continuous inuendo that went on between them! This one is well worth the price but for completely different reasons than any other season!!  I think it set the stage for a HUGE CHANGE in Chef Ramsey's conduct and it is almost as scandalous as this season's Bachelor if you read between the lines!!!  UPDATE:  Well I just finished watching episode 9 and Keith came right out and accused chef Ramsey of having a ""hard on"" for Virginia!! This scandlous season is not my imagination! Listen to what Virginia says to Gordon when she is pleading her case and then listen to Keiths accusation when he gets booted off instead of her!! WOW!! The most frustrating yet entertaining season of all!!!",1266883200,,1465,4.376383763837638
4048082,5,B0031545SO,"I love Gordon Ramsey and watch all of his shows, Kitchen Nightmares, The F Word, you get the idea.  Hell's Kitchen was the only show I couldn't get on cable anywhere, so I bought the first two series and would like the rest of them.  I believe the show is well over the time limit to be on DVD.  Although, I did cheat and watched season five on Hulu because that was the only season they had on there.",1264464000,3,401,4.050632911392405
4048103,4,B0031545SO,"I really enjoy watching this show. I have only recently began watching the seasons beginning with last season (season 10) I love them so much that I had to begin buying the series. The only thing that bothers me is that the original casts were filled with people who were not chefs and made mistakes even I would not make. That was a bit annoying, but Gordon Ramsey is Gordon Ramsey and is very entertaining to listen to, especially since the beeps have been eliminated and you can hear the word used, no children in the room of course. Anyway, of course Amazon did a magnificent job shipping in a timely manner and product was in excellent shape.",1368576000,,647,4.491525423728813
4048104,5,B0031545SO,"My Mom and I started watching Hell's Kitchen with this season. We were highly entertained with Gordon Ramsey and how he motivates up and coming chefs to give their all. While I don't consider this reality TV as it is pre recorded and not live, it still gives us a look at what goes on in high dollar restaurants and the pressure that some chefs feel. Before watching this, I would never have guessed at the level of dedication required to make cooking a career. I love watching this show and have watched subsequent seasons after this. This is my favorite season, however, and watching the competition between the final contestants was the best in Hell's Kitchen in my opinion.",1360454400,,677,4.65

4048108,3,B0031545SO,"Hell's Kitchen season 2 is the same size as season 1 but is definutly badder then the first season. Both in terms of angry moments and not as many likeable people. Don't get me wrong the right person won, and was a strong person throughout the show. However that is this seasons saving grace.

The mood of the show is a lot more negative then the first one. There were more constestants that had no chance of winning, very litte teamwork showed and even allies become distant over time. People who screwed up also didn't seem to go away and most likeable people seemed to eventually drown in mistakes. The eventual winner was the only one that held there head up high throughout. Out of all the seasons in the JP era of Hell's Kitchen (seasons 1-7) I rank it as the worst.

However this is mearly my opinion and I ended up buying the dvd as it is interesting to watch some people good or bad. As for extra's on the dvd it's only short interviews that don't add much and I think are somewhat hard to sit though as there are a lot of repeating questions.",1342396800,,1052,4.308080808080808

4048112,5,B0031545SO,"The Hell's Kitchen series has been around since 2005 and by now most folks have heard of it. In 2011 it has garnered some impressive ratings but with all of the bleeping it's as if 20% of the dialogue is obliterated. If one is prone to like the style of the show, then viewing the ""Raw and Uncensored"" version truly puts the reality back into this program. Chef Ramsay's frequent and creative use of expletives is left in-tact and the emotions of the contestants are expressed in their own uncensored words. It makes a big difference!",1314230400,,534,4.572916666666667
