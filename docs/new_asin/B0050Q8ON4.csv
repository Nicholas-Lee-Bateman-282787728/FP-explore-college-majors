8451661,3,B0050Q8ON4,"I was disappointed by the fact that the actual movie is only about 10 minutes long. Over all the cinematography was well done for a short film, but the length didn't leave much room for any plot. I wish I would have realized that I was paying $1.30 a minute for this movie.",1323907200,,273,4.169811320754717
