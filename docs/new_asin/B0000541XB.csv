digitally remastered)...relive those thrilling days from the early '30s and '40s

when drama took us down the dusty trails and the plains to exciting

adventures....some of the best B-Westerns ever to grace the Saturday Matinee

Screen......the Native Americans had no better ambassador than Tim McCoy, a

former Indian language translator in real life...as Tim McCoy speaks

passionately about this country's longtime abuse of its native population by

breaking treaty after treaty...just remember double thrills, chills, mystery and

suspense...hitting the bull's eye with excitement...don't miss any of the Tim

McCoy features loaded with action that will leave you wanting more of his

B-Western adventures
