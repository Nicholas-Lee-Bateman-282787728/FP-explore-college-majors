He also wants you to add 20 mins of cardio on the other days.  Very doable program and he is not too bad to look at either!!!  Looked like he has had a lot of success with clients on program too.  Will try joining his online club.  Great diet plan you can get easy access too there as well as the book.  Thanks again Jorge for another great, doable program!!",1199059200,43,518,3.9134615384615383
3010316,2,B000Y04R8C,"The 12 second sequence workout, is not a new idea. There is a book out by Adam Zickerman and Bill Schley that is called the Power of 10. This is the same concept as the 12 second sequence. They even recommend the 2 times a week workout and then you can go down to 1 time a week. Again, it is exactly the same elements. Slow, controlled movements. You do 10 seconds into the exercise and 10 seconds down. So if you are doing an arm curl, you slowly, controlled, move the arm up for 10 counts and then repeat down for  a very slow, controlled 10. Again, this book was published in 2003, so sorry Jorge, this is not a new concept. Funny thing, too, they also recommend eating 6 times a day and not going over 4 hours between eating - sound familiar, as well?",1198886400,54,755,4.136054421768708

8230409,4,B000Y04R8C,"I like this workout video.  My wife and I do it together and the 20 minute workout, twice a week,  seems to go by very quickly.  However we didn't lose inches off our belly in 2 weeks as the video claims and we didn't expect to.  It seems to be geared toward people who are not doing any type of strength training.  I think it would be inadequate for someone who does strength training already.  All in all we like it and will continue to use it.",1267747200,,446,4.068965517241379
8230410,4,B000Y04R8C,"its true that the 12 second sequence is simple and a lot less time consuming than conventional sets and repetitions but the tension exerted while doing the slow sets are what kills you.  It is hard work and will burn one way or another.  It is just another approach to the conventional way.  Either way, there is no way around it, you need work hard, be consistent, commited and eat right to see results.  This video just gives you a more convenient way to get the results it promises.  Plus it teaches you proper method, posture and breathing.  Works well just be prepared to do the work.  Not a miracle (easy) tool like you would think.",1250035200,2,638,4.448275862068965
8230411,3,B000Y04R8C,"I did this about 3 times.  I understand the moves and the reasons for it, but the dvd is slow and boring.  I am probably going to re-sell this at some point.",1231632000,,157,3.875

8230413,3,B000Y04R8C,I thought the dvd has very good insturctions. The problem is it's for one week. Do you have to get a new dvd every week?,1206921600,4,120,3.84
8230414,5,B000Y04R8C,"I bought the book first, then decided I needed more guidance.  The CD is much better if you actually want to do the exercises.  I only wish I had known that before investing in the book. (I found it awkward to hold the book while trying the exercises.)",1206662400,7,252,4.229166666666667
8230415,4,B000Y04R8C,"I was skeptical that anything called the 12 second sequence would work; but I'm lazy; so I said I can do anything for 12 seconds! In spite of the title it is a full-body work-out and I've been doing it for about a month, and I've lost 5 lbs. and 1 and1/2 inches from my waist. I would recommend it to anyone who doesnt have alot of time but wants a challenging workout that has good results.",1205539200,7,391,4.090909090909091
8230416,2,B000Y04R8C,"I love the video and have gotten a great workout thus far from volume 1. Buyer beware! The only negative comment I would say is that buyers need to be aware that there are two volumes to complete the two week training. It was not clear that I was purchasing volume one only. I had to purchase the entire workout dvd again to get both volume one and two together. Just make sure that if you purchase the DVD, that it includes more than the one week sample as I did.",1202083200,51,464,4.1098901098901095
8230417,3,B000Y04R8C,"I couldn't wait to order this DVD and start right away. When I received it, no where on the DVD case did it say I was going to need a Swiss ball (which, thankfully, I had), dumb bells, a chair, a mat and a broomstick. Not a big deal but I had to pause the tape and run around and look for my stuff! I don't own dumb bells so I had to improvise last minute with two 64oz bottles of cranapple juice. After the work out, I do feel like I did when i had time to go to the gym - I'm exhausted and with twenty minutes ea wrk out, it's doable...I'm a busy mom with no time so I need this.",1201910400,22,581,3.693548387096774
