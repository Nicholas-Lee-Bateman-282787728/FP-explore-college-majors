3955762,5,B002N5N5OI,"Addiction is a leading cause of death, family breakups, suffering, and career loss in the world.
 It is a chronic degenerative disease and difficult for any individual including their family to live with as well as overcome.
 This episode ""Hammered"" brings to light that the addict must never let their guard down.
Doing well for months or years is meaningless when someone with good intentions and ignorant regarding this disease pushes their needs on to you.

3955763,1,B002N5N5OI,"I didn't mind that this episode was about alcoholism but I did mind that the whole episode made a mess of everything right that had been done to freshen up the show this season.  As a result, we are now seemingly back to square one with same old, same old.  Elliott and Olivia are seemingly the whole show again from this point forward and I don't know if I can handle that.  The episode is also a bit over the top.  Virtually every person who comes forward in this episode is a closet alcoholic and, in some rare instances, an in your face AA member.  If we could have stuck to the defendant's alcoholism solely, this episode probably would have worked.  As it is, I think the show pretty much blew up in its makers' faces.",1255651200,3,724,4.286764705882353
3955764,5,B002N5N5OI,I want to know if Liv will find peace and love.  If Stabler will get a grip on his personal issues.  Either way he has fought to keep his family.  Finn needs to look more for his son.  I want to see Liv also feel like she belongs to a family not just a job.  They have sacrificed too much for their dedication and love to find justice for their vistims.  I can't wait.,1254614400,5,368,3.9054054054054053
3955765,4,B002N5N5OI,"McCormack, of WILL & GRACE fame, is the guest star in this episode.  He plays a rich jerk who became enamored of a young woman he met through an internet hookup. She turns up dead and he is the chief suspect.  McCormack is very good at guesting in these types of roles.  He rarely picks a good guy Will Truman role, which he made famous on tv. The newest star to the law and order squad room is Christine Lahti as the prosecuting attorney.  She is so powerful an actress that she all but blows the other regular members of the show off the screen. Honestly, if she took over the show at this point, it probably would be a much better show.  She is that good.  Elliott and Olivia are doing the least for me this season. I think these actors have exhausted their ranges with these characters.  They are very close to becoming dull and boring. I probably would stop watching if Lahti had not been added.",1254355200,,900,4.289940828402367

3955811,5,B002N5N5OI,"Excellent episode.  My son was in ""protective custody"" for 3 months once--the same as ""segregation"" where he served.  It drove him crazy.  He was able to have books--but the light was on constantly and no one would say a word to him.  He was there for protection--but was treated as if he was serving time as a troublemaker.

One episode featured a Manhattan street in Southern California. The name was uniquely Manhattan. As an administrator myself, those writers need to be supervised and have their work checked. I do it with my Residents in Psychiatry and it makes them better doctors. A line Dr. Olivet delivered in open court on ""Law and Order - Jack McCoy Original"" that one of the show's consultants was the one of the best Forensic Psychiatrists in the country was pure bulls*** He's OK; I'm just as good and I can name a dozen in NYC as good as I am.

3956090,5,B002N5N5OI,"I like the more true to life - expose of the so called ""justice system""  Marissa reflects a more down to earth realistic character and reflects her own core values well in regards to victims of sexual and domestic violence. It was a shame to see Stabler exit the show - they portrayed a good team. In saying, the later seasons have continued to uphold good watch value IMO!!!",1393545600,,375,4.434782608695652

3956094,5,B002N5N5OI,"I am largely just a fan of the old Law & Order flagship, where the drama consistently hinges on legal issues.  I never liked SVU or CI anywhere nearly as much.  SVU just seemed concocted to appeal to an audience that wants more gore from their cop shows.  I look now at some of the SVU reruns of early seasons and still see what bothered me then.

But I got SVU season 11 by accident.  After only picking at a couple of shows I began to see that they've hired some better writers.  Many Season 11 episodes can vie with the flagship classics.  The L&O ""twist"" is back in play, especially with episodes like ""Witness"" which gives you space to come to many wrong conclusions and then takes you on a whiplash turnaround.  I was quite surprised by Sharon Stone as guest DA.  I never saw her put in such gutty performances before.  ""Wannabe"" and ""Unstable"" make the viewer look behind the badge more carefully.  I note that Belzer & Ice-T have been relegated to the background, and while I'm a big Belzer fan from the Homicide days, nonetheless I have to say the show works better without him, and the ""T"".",1378598400,,1100,4.396039603960396

3956139,4,B002N5N5OI,"I don't really like S.V.U., however I bought this episode because Sutton Foster guest starred in this episode. I found the episode very  poignant and interesting, very informative and touching. I don't like S.V.U., but this episode is great.",1369526400,,241,5.17948717948718
3956140,5,B002N5N5OI,"As the characters are better developed (more firmly defined) the show is less about the heinous crimes (and the victims) and more about the detectives (and the perpetrators).

3956143,5,B002N5N5OI,"Even though He was cold, brace, and angry in this roll Wentworth Miller was a great addition to the show. They should bring him back for somemore episodes. And I will watch it again, for sure.",1361664000,,192,4.361111111111111
3956144,4,B002N5N5OI,"After eleven seasons it's hard to write some original content in this review.  I could go over the characters again, the episodes, and what SVU is really all about, but those who are already fans (which you must be if you're looking at season eleven) will already know everything that I put down here.  Still, this is a good series, and this particular season had a few little gems.

Law and Order SVU deals with the special crimes.  The crimes that make your stomach turn and a tear come out of your eye because they are so brutal and heartbreaking.  In this season we have a couple of episodes that are especially heartbreaking.  ""Anchor"" is said because it involves children, but it also handles the topic of immigration, which is a conflicting one for a lot of people.  ""Quickie"" I sympathized with the grandfather of the suspect and it was a hard one to watch as a result.  Again in this season there is kind of a cliffhanger ending involving the medical examiner.  But it wasn't quite as gut wrenching as the tenth season's cliffhanger.

I was once again disappointed with how much screentime Belzer and Ice-T get.  They really aren't used that effectively.  Don't get me wrong, I love Meloni and Hargitay, but just to have some fresh faces on the scene now and then would be nice.  Use everybody to their best abilities.  Florek doesn't make as many appearances as Cragan either.  I was also a little less than impressed with the ADA's this season.  When comparing them to March and Neal they just don't relate to the audience as well.  In fact, I find myself wishing that they didn't have more screentime than Belzer and Ice-T and that we stay out of the courtrooms and in the policework areas so we don't have to watch them.  But the way this show runs through ADA's I shouldn't have to contend with them too long.

This is a hard show to watch because of all the violence and rape and other traumatizing things.  There is a lot of legwork by the detectives which takes up screen time, but it doesn't mean that there isn't something hard to watch in every episode.  A kind of viewer beware type of thing if hard topics are not what you like to watch.

I'm eager to see what the twelfth season brings.  Despite this season having a couple flaws it is still immensely watchable and one of the most popular shows on television.

3956149,3,B002N5N5OI,"I love Law & Order and I like SVU more than any other L&O Offering.  However the price of Year 11 has my love of Law & Order SVU fading fast.  To price Season 11 L&O SVU so high is just absolutely insane.  It appears the price for this set of DVD's was made somewhere outside of human reality.  The Episodes were pretty good but they were slightly modified retreads of plots we have already seen many times before.  The Alcoholism subject has been worn out in Law & Order SVU please move on is all I can say.  Law & Order SVU Year 11 is proof that the writers are not only running out of creative steam, I think the poor dears are running on half baked fumes.  The plots have few unexpected twists and turns.  The acting is just getting tedious and boring.

I just happen to be a real Law & Order Junkie so I am happy I brought this set.  Also I can afford my Law & Order SVU Habit so while the price is crazy., I'll pay for these last few Seasons.  However I won't sit still for these astronomically high prices much longer not even for Law & Order SVU.  Now that the quality of episodes in Year 11 has deteriorated, I don't get the pure rush of excitement I used to get when the L&O \ SVU stories were fresh, novel and engaging.  If the price were lower this DVD set would not be bad.  Law & Order SVU Year 11 is not the best of the series but; it is passable JUST NOT AT THIS USEROUS PRICE!",1355184000,,1393,4.0181818181818185

I love the show very much and like that the case that holds the DVDs is slim and takes up less space on the shelf, unlike the first few season's packaging. I also like that on the DVD episode selection, it gives you a brief synopsis of the episode and the DVDs also project in high quality. I will definitely be buying Season 12 when it comes out.",1301097600,,452,4.033333333333333

However SVU like NYPD Blue is one of the better American police shows out there. Well written scripts, great acting and guest appearences from various actors over the different series. This show keeps getting better and better looking forward to catching up with this DVD I recently purchased. I like the paring of Mariska Hargitay & Chris Meloni the rest of the ensemble cast complete what is a good all round show. Would highly recommend.",1298332800,,552,4.760416666666667
3956211,4,B002N5N5OI,"I loved this episode.
I will admit I watched it for Wentworth Miller but was unsure of how I would feel about his character...
Nate Kendall is one character I would love to see again,not just because of Miller but because as characters go he was alarmingly wonderful.
The alarming part comes from the cold indifference he shows to everyone in the episode, the rape victim he doesn't want to deal with because 'victims cling', and just about every inappropriate thing that comes out of his mouth afterwards. The character was just so damn intriguing I want to see more of him. I hope his character comes back.",1298073600,,608,4.638888888888889

3956236,5,B002N5N5OI,"This has been, for more than a decade now, my favorite show on television.  The stories are powerful and they stick with you.  Mariska Hargitay and Chris Meloni are the heart of this show.  I honestly don't think the show would do as well without them.  I would, however, like to see more of Munch and Fin.  They seem to have sort of dropped into the background and are only in a few scenes of each episode.  I remember earlier seasons when there would be an episode or two (or more) when they were the central characters.

The addition of Christine Lahti for the first few episodes was great.  I wasn't sure if I was going to like her, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I'm glad she didn't stick around for the entire season though.  It was great to see Stephanie March back for several episodes.  I wish she was back for good, but the way in which she was written out this time (unlike last time when she was put into the witness protection program) was very well done.  Overall, this is definitely one of my favorite seasons of the show.

Also, even though the price is (or was...not sure if the current price is what it originally was) a little high, at least the season was released fairly quickly after the season aired on TV.  I remember when the show first went on DVD, it wasn't until the 5th season was aired.  And even then season 1 wasn't released first.  So I'm just glad that NBC/Universal is releasing the seasons like nearly every other show.",1285804800,9,1457,4.400749063670412
3956237,5,B002N5N5OI,"Olivia Benson is my hero.  She's tough but vulnerable all at the same time.  The stories are just as heart-wrenching as they have always been, and this one delves a bit more into the personal lives of the detectives, particularly Stabler.  Mischa Barton makes a nice getaway from spoiled rich girl Marissa as a young and overwhelmed mother.

The one weakness of the season deals with the ADA.  Alex Cabot is back.  She's sort of like a cockroach, she just won't die!  First she leaves then she comes back and then leaves and now she's back again!  The show has struggled to find a decent ADA since Casey Novak was disbarred two seasons ago.  Just as we're getting comfortable with Cabot again, she decides all of a sudden that she wants to go prosecute bad guys in Africa.  Ummmm, what?  Okay, so she's gone again, and they bring in Sharon Stone.  Sharon Stone is just painful to watch.  She's just awful.  It's hard to believe this is the same actress who was nominated for an Academy Award for her role in Casino.  Hopefully, we can get it together for Season #12.",1285632000,9,1066,4.507853403141361

But, all of a sudden, the price for a set has gone up approximately $12.00.

Gee, and in this economy.

I'll pass.  Maybe in a few months, Amazon and Universal will come to their senses and go back to the old price.

If not, I'll just watch my 10 seasons of LAW & ORDER:SVU all over again.

Year 10 was especially great with lots of great guest stars and wild animals too.  Looking forward to this release.",1272153600,5,365,4.323529411764706
3956240,4,B002N5N5OI,"Olivia and Elliott make a mistake early on in this episode so they are sidelined so the FBI shrink and Ice T can take a bit more dominant role.  I frankly wish this was happening a bit more often as it can get tedious just watching Olivia and Elliott week in and week out. There is a teenage boy who is a suspected murderer who is under investigation this episode. However, the entirety of his past is examined by the detectives and a far more sinister villain comes to light.  All in all, an interesting episode although nothing earth shattering.",1270771200,,547,4.46

Too bad NBC feels like they need to sell the series instead allowing playback like CBS!  I'm honestly watching more of CSI, Criminal Minds, The Mentalist and NCIS because CBS seems to be a bit more generous with their playback policy, these are free!!!! Which beats paying 1.99 for SVU, as much as I love em.............I think all keep watching CBS.",1265500800,,398,4.739130434782608

Hard to describe without spoiling, due to the twists; but enjoyed seeing Leann Hunley as Eric McCormack's ex-wife, just two of many competent performances, with McCormack a standout.  Was caught up in a sharp verbal brawl between Stabler and the new ADA.  Perhaps story moved too fast with personal growth, but I fully bought into every scene.
