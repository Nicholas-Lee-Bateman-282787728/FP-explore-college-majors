8528027,3,B008H6GHGA,"I think it was last year that this was nominated for best documentary, although I don't think it won. It revolves around the continuing Egyptian revolution that started back several years ago and has been in the papers so much even up to today. I just read another article the other day about it. Its predominantly filmed on the main Square of Cairo, hence the title. Since its a documentary, its all real, which makes it all more disturbing. I think if it was fictional; it would probably be even more horrific because you know how they like to make things as horrific as possible in movies. So, in that sense, this movie is pretty tame. But since its real, it affects you more. Several people get hurt in it, but the documentary only focuses on one casualty during the whole thing. Its a little convoluted and I think they couldve explained what was going on better. It was as if they assumed you already knew everything about it. Although, I do try to keep up with the news, I am unfortunately a little ignorant of the details of the revolution. I wished they had focused a bit more on the logistics of what happened as apposed to the fighting and demonstrating in the Square specifically. It did make me want to read up more on the subject. I just think that, if they were going to focus on how violent and horrific it was, they shouldve focused on more horrific things. Dont get me wrong, I wouldnt want to have to go through something like that, but it just wasn't informative enough for a real documentary and too sanitized for a sentimental documentary.",1408320000,,1561,4.5
8528028,4,B008H6GHGA,This DVD shows some reasons for the Arab Spring.  But the Arab Spring is still hard to understand.  Did the people really improve their lot?  Have economics improved?  Some things seem to have gotten worse.  There's a very unstable situation in the region.,1397347200,,256,4.8604651162790695
8528029,4,B008H6GHGA,"THE SQUARE is a raw, uncompromising documentary charting the Egyptian
revolution that began with the overthrowing of Pressident Mubarak, and
continues to this day. President Morsi was elected and overthrown; and
the people are perpetually at war with one another. The film tells the
stories that have often been neglected with the reporting of the
conflict in the western media. Using five different people of different
ages and different backgrounds as their subjects, director Jehane
Noujaim shows the spontaneity of the so-called ""Arab Spring"" - it began
as a popular movement among young people and continues in similar vein
to this day. They are not only frustrated with the established forces
of government, as well as the army, but they are searching for a more
democratic form of living. Despite repeated - and often violent -
attempts to suppress them, their will to resist remains unshakable. The
film includes several violent sequences attesting to the brutality of
the army's treatment of the revolutionaries. What gives THE SQUARE its
true originality, however, is its refusal to be constrained within
western-inscribed intellectual boundaries. Revolutions are supposed to
be decisive, with one government supplanted by another; this film shows
that the revolution in Egypt is a long one, and is still by no means
concluded. The actor Khalid Abdalla, one of the main protesters, makes
this point; after two years, certain reforms have been achieved, but
the protests need to continue long-term. Revolutions are also supposed
to be about ideology - the Russian Revolution, for instance, helped
usher in communist rule. In Egypt, as with other countries in the
region, the protesters don't necessarily have a coherent ideology (even
though their concerns are obviously ideological); they are just looking
for a form of government in which their voices can be heard. And
perhaps most importantly, the subject-matter of THE SQUARE is not just
about Egypt, but can also apply to other countries who have experienced
similar protests - Tunisia, Syria and Turkey. If filmgoers want to
learn more about the consequences of the so-called ""Arab Spring"" (a
term which has been embraced by the west, but seems to me misleading),
they should watch this film. Essential viewing.",1393891200,,2277,5.258241758241758

8528031,5,B008H6GHGA,"'The Square' is a documentary that provides us with the first one on one glimpse into the world of the Egyptian protestors, and the demonstration in Cairo in 2011. This is a first hand account by the characters involved in the demonstration. We saw it on TV, but we were given the US version of what was occurring. Now we have the first hand account of the Egyptian revolutionaries, themselves.

An amazing cast of real-life characters has come to tell Egypt's political story of the past three years. Taking to the streets to remove the dictator Hosni Mubarak, then to protest military rule and finally to rise up against the presidency of Mohamed Morsi. In the three years that this all occurred, the characters were full of the stuff revolutions are made of. The group who congregated on Tahrir Square shows us the sides of Egyptian society: religious, secular, progressive, conservative, working-class and elite.

Often these stories, the personal stories, were filled with fear and atrocities and what looked like mass demonstrations comes into focus. ""The film's narrator, Ahmed Hassan, is a fiery man in his 20s who argues in defense of the ideals of the Tahrir revolution. The actor Khalid Abdalla, is the British-educated son of an exiled activist and consults with his father on tactics and goals. Magdy Ashour, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, at first opposes Mubarak because of the historic oppression of his fellow Islamists but comes to question the methods of the Brotherhood once it makes political deals with the Egyptian military. Ramy Essam, a singer who becomes the musical voice of the protests, is a warm, smiling presence who eventually comes under sadistic torture by police forces."" The Guardian

We are reminded that revolution is less about outcomes than about a way of apprehending the world, per Abdalla. This film was actually filmed on the streets with the protesters. The Square"" puts us into the center of all the discussions, the protests, the meetings the discussions of the revolution. We see these people address the issues important to them, finally understanding this revolution will be a long time coming, and it is not an easy fix. But the joy exhibited when Murbarak is forced out of office is wonderful to see. The understanding that The Brotherhood is not the answer, and, in reality another roadblock to democracy.

Soon, Egyptians begin voting on a draft constitution backed by the military-appointed government. This could pave the way for elections. Another step. A first hand glimpse at a region trying to come to terms with a new political way of thinking.
