8288351,5,B001CO3258,My 4 year old has been a fan of Boowa and Kwala ([...]) for over a year and its been a GREAT discovery.  This dvd is an absolute favorite.  She walks away from anything that is even slightly boring.  This keeps her singing and spinning and dancing. every kid would love this dvd so much!!,1268179200,,288,4.2
8288352,5,B001CO3258,"My 3-year-old loves Boowa and Kwala. One day, [...]. She hasn't stopped playing since. It's easy to use for kids of all ages and it's very educational. I'm not sure what the attraction is, but children REALLY get into it. I catch my daughter running around singing all of their songs. I sing one with her while we clean the house and she has fun picking up her toys. I hope more of us Americans get turned on to Boowa and Kwala.",1235088000,,428,4.2317073170731705
8288353,5,B001CO3258,"My daughter's been using the uptoten.com site for almost two years so it's nice to have Boowa and Kwala in another form.  The short (5 minute) episodes are great when she wants to watch one more show.  Uptoten does a good job of introducing ideas, from simple ones such as colors to chemistry and different tastes.  They're simple stories, lovely little songs and lovable characters who in true preschooler style can ""almost"" swim, can't stand still and are very easily distracted.",1231891200,,481,4.91358024691358
