3901994,3,B002BZTNIC,"""Easy Virtue"" made it to number 95 on The London Times List of 100 Worst Films of 2008. Based on the play written by Noel Coward in 1924 (when he was only 25 years old), the film borrows a lot of lines from the original nearly verbatim. However, the end result departs vastly from the intent of the playwright and criminally underuses the dramatic talents of Collin Firth (the Father) and Kristin Scott Thomas (the Mother). But, let's start at the beginning:

An adventurous American widow (Biel) marries a very young scion of English landed gentry (Ben Barnes, who in real life is actually one year older then Biel; they try to pull off Biel's ""cougar"" illusion by dying her hair grey and blond). The lad introduces his new bride to the family and all hell breaks loose. Unsurprisingly to the viewer, the match is ill-conceived and ends just like we think it is going to end... though not until we have been treated to some predictable familiar hi-jinx, a stiff tango and, well... an equally stiff Chihuahua.

While the play clearly delivers Coward's views on rampant hypocrisy amongst better off English classes, the point our filmmakers are trying to make is not equally obvious. The script seems downright schizophrenic, as if the writer could not decide whether he was writing a comedy, a drama, a romance, a ""who dun the Chihuahua"", or something else all together. Instead of loathing, we feel pity for the supposed ""bad guy"", the lad's mother. With a disinterested cheat for a husband and a twit for a son, she is single-handedly trying to preserve what is left of the family's dignity and fortune. What a lonely task that is... Verdict: the script fails this film BIG TIME! It is difficult then to blame Biel for her character's vacuity of emotions. Lacking personal charisma and unsupported by the script, the actress fails to project the strength of a protagonist. The veterans, Firth and Thomas, have nothing to do but go thru the motions of displaying boredom and British stiff upper lip, respectively.

Easy Virtue is not void of saving graces: there are some witty dialog exchanges, mainly taken from the play itself, and of course there are the breathtaking sets, the costumes, and the jazz era music that make the film worthy of a one time view. Alas, another sublimely balanced ""Gosford Park"" this is NOT...",1252800000,18,2324,4.7905236907730675
3901995,5,B002BZTNIC,"...I know the cost is going to be a killer. To summarize quickly before a long worded review - this is your typical solid Sony BD presentation of a good film, so I suppose one will have to weigh out how much they love the content.

I felt this to be a great comedy presentation of a 1920s Brit piece that came across on Blu beautifully. The English countryside estate (a lovely looking acreage and interior) is filled with a wonderful cast of snobs, naive youth, seasoned work staff, and a comic relief father played perfectly by Colin Firth. He was the strong point of the movie and I laughed almost every time he spoke. The story follows the introduction of an American wife into this mix played adequately by Jessica Biel. As the weeks progress we get to see a spattering of visuals, comedic schticks, and life lessons learned by all until the surprising end. I do not feel the criticism I have read here and elsewhere is valid since this is meant to be a light take on this sociological experiment, yet exquisitely preserved.

The overall colors were a little drab, but some of the landscape exteriors and one interior dance scene showed some vibrancy. The TrueHD was fine, and actually played best when the music was active (which is being interjected often). The supplements were thorough for a film like this, including:
* 5 minutes of 4 deleted scenes - would have been fine left in the film.
* 8:30 minutes of bloopers - they were actually funny and seemed appropriate for the extras inclusion since this was a humorous film.
* 6 minute New York Premiere Featurette - more of an ad plug with some red carpet interviews and too many film clips.
* Commentary by the director and writer - this was actually one of the better ones I have heard in some time. The director dominates the track with a plethora of great info, and the writer actually provides a solid back-up to his material; they gelled just right. Was nice to hear a team on a commentary instead of a competition or a mess of constant interruptions.

I liked the film and it plays very well in the store. The display catches a great deal of attention with the props, music and attire, plus everyone performs quite well. Four for the film and one for the extras. Did not see the original material (play, book) to compare so I think all the negative press is misplaced as a stand alone film, and Biel was not that bad - she did fine for what the role was. Enjoy.",1252800000,50,2429,4.466216216216216
3901996,5,B002BZTNIC,"I loved watching this movie. If you have seen some of Noel Cowards work done before (Relative Values), you'll remember the humor he brings to the plate. Stephan Elliot truly had his hands full with four great cast members! You will laugh, you will be upset, you will be astonished and that it what makes this movie such fun to watch! It's been described as ""meet the very posh british parents"" but I think it's much, much more. And, a great performance of the Tango done by Jessica Biel and Colin Firth!",1248739200,38,503,4.478260869565218
3901997,3,B002BZTNIC,"""Easy Virtue"" takes a well-worn plot and dusts it off: What does a stuffy family do when someone new and wholly different enters the fold?

In this case, the loose adaptation of Noel Coward's classic play about hypocrisy never quite answers the question, mainly because the plot gets altered so severely. It's full of gorgeous misty scenery, ancient manorhouses and some wonderful acting from the British ""family,"" but unfortunately it's undermined by the presence of Jessica Biel -- not only can she not act, but her character is a 2-D pain in the backside.

After a vacation in the south of France, young John Whittaker (Ben Barnes) brings his new wife home to the family estate -- an American racecar driver named Larita. His mother Veronica (Kristin Scott Thomas) takes an instant dislike to her (for reasons later revealed), and Larita quickly rubs the family the wrong way by whining about the house and local customs. She wants to get back to London, she hates the country, and she only gets friendly with John's war-scarred dad.

And the family becomes increasingly displeased with Larita as a series of accidents (squashing the chihuahua), misunderstandings and attention-getting stunts take place -- and soon a cold war of sorts has broken out between Veronica and Larita. But the whole mess really starts when news arrives from America about some skeletons in Larita's closet that she neglected to mention to John...

Noel Coward's original play was all about hypocrisy -- presumably the hypocrisy of the mother and sisters for disliking Larita. But Stephan Elliott has whittled away some parts of the original play and recrafted it: now it's part dark comedy, part drama, part romance (past, present and future) and has a new ending and some very different plot twists (Larita's scandalous criminal conviction).

The story unfolds slowly in a haze of cigarette smoke, country mist and greenhouse flowers, and Elliott pumps up the fun with vintage music and Cowell's sharp dialogue (""I don't feel like smiling."" ""You're English dear. Fake it""). The growing battle between Veronica and Larita is fun to watch as they try to one-up each other (hello, Picasso nude!), but there are some truly sad moments as well, such as when John discovers how hard his mother has worked for their family.

But there are some moments that feel incredibly awkward, such as a tango number between Firth and Biel near the end. And the whole dog-squashing thing was just gross and tasteless.

Unfortunately, Larita sours the plot; it doesn't help that the one-note Biel plays her with blank eyes and a petulant pout, which fail to give Larita any depth. Presumably she's supposed to be the clever and modern heroine, but she ends up seeming snotty, inflexible and totally insensitive (such as when she mocks the local traditions... on her FIRST NIGHT). When she isn't whining at John for ""not loving me better,"" she's flirting with his dad (which undermines the whole idea that she isn't an ""easy virtue"" type).

Instead, you end up feeling sorry for the demonized Mrs. Whittaker: she's frantically trying to hold her family together as the estate slips away, with no help from her mocking husband. Thomas' brittle body language and taut face speak volumes (certainly more than Biel's). Colin Firth does a good job as the broken ex-Army Major who inexplicably seems to loathe his wife, and the gorgeous Barnes exudes boyish passion and innocence as John (until he has to grow up in a big way). And man, can that boy sing!

""Easy Virtue"" is a gorgeous little piece filled with great actors, but unfortunately an unpleasant lead character and wooden actress throw it off kilter. But it's definitely worth watching for Thomas, Firth and Barnes.",1248566400,7,3730,4.964743589743589
3901998,5,B002BZTNIC,I am deaf from USA.  I greatly enjoyed this old fashioned romantic comedy for modern times.  A great fan of Benjamin Barnes and hard to see him in Prince Caspian character cuz he's so different in this movie.  A must see movie!,1248220800,,227,4.357142857142857
3901999,5,B002BZTNIC,"I saw Easy Virtue 5 times in the theatre when it was in limited release and would have seen it more given the chance! The acting is suberb by the whole cast. Ben Barnes (of Prince Caspian fame) plays love struck young Englishman John Whittaker who marries American race car driver, Larita (an elegant, witty Jessica Biel) bringing her home to his manipulative disapproving mother (the always fabulous Kristin Scott Thomas), vacant war damaged father (Colin Firth in a beautifully natural performance), and provincial sisters Marion and Hilda. Snappy dialogue and machinations ensue on both sides in the battle for John's future.

This is often billed as a comedy and though it IS very funny, there is drama and deeper meaning, as well. Director and co-screenwriter Stephan Elliott (Priscilla, Queen of the Desert) manages to find something sympathetic in each character while taking a delicious potshot at upper-crusty English society. Little is left of the Noel Coward play it's based on (thank goodness), but it's witty enough that it sounds like Coward. Elliott creates a visually rich and dynamic piece packed with fun period music (I LOVE the soundtrack!).

Marius de Vries builds a beautiful period score along with some contemporary songs made to sound like period pieces (I especially love ""Sex Bomb""). Ben Barnes has a gorgeous voice and besides singing to charm everyone in the movie, provides the soundtrack with two of my favorite songs, ""A Room With a View"" and ""I'll See You Again"". Jessica Biel opens the film with a lovely ""Mad About the Boy"" and helps Colin Firth and Ben Barnes on ""When the Going Gets Tough the Tough Get Going"".

I highly recommend this gay, bittersweet romp!",1248134400,20,1695,4.982332155477032

3902001,5,B002BZTNIC,"My new obsession - this rework of Noel Coward's play expands the characters and builds up the family drama caused by a modern 1920's widow marrying into stuffy English gentry (who have issues of their own).  Disconnects and bad will flourish, misunderstandings abound, but it ends on a positive note.  Jessica Biel is lovely, as are the sets and wardrobe.  Must see.",1514419200,,366,4.870967741935484
3902002,3,B002BZTNIC,"This is a difficult movie to review. The actors are first-rate, the costumes and sets are gorgeous, the production values high. I believe the material is solid as well, but not being an aficionado of Noel Coward I have to suppose that it's the material that doesn't translate well to modern moviemaking. Or maybe it wasn't translated by a skilled enough hand. The jokes are there, but their delivery often falls flat or comes off like a cheesy dad-joke, the kind of asides that should be played to a live audience with a ba-dum-ching. Colin Firth is the only one playing wry enough to make it work. He and Jessica Biel are the only ones playing characters with enough depth to seem like more than mere ""types,"" and I'm not generally a fan of Jessica Biel so I have to give her props for this performance. Kristen Scott Thomas is deeply unlikeable here, though her matriarch Veronica is also understandable given her motives. Everyone else is shallow and one-note, and there's some subplot with the servants that seems to have been axed for length. There's also some reworkings of late-twentieth century pop songs in the style of jazz-era pop songs, and I can't decide if it's more amusing than distracting. Much as I want to like this it doesn't quite work.",1511049600,,1257,4.6923076923076925

3902014,4,B002BZTNIC,"This was a surprisingly good film.  I had pretty low expectations, but I was looking for something mindless to occupy me while a chicken roasted in the oven.  ;)  Set in the 20's, the story is of an American woman, Larita,  played by Jessica Biel, who is a bit of an adventuress, but just a bit.  While in Europe, she meets and marries a young Englishman, Ben Whittaker, several years her junior, it seems.  She has been making a living driving race cars and winning races -- she was born in Detroit and her father worked closely with Henry Ford (???), so she grew up with cars.

When the couple goes to Ben's home for her to meet his family, all sorts of fun ensues.  But not in a good way.  His mother, played by Kristin Scott Thomas, is a rigid, spiteful and desperately unhappy woman.  One of his sisters lost her fiance and the other is quite young, gullible and has an unrequited crush on one of her brother's friends.  The attractive and stylish new wife catches most of the male attention, although she is not interested at all, turning all the female populace even more against her.  The only ones who don't hate her on sight are her new father-in-law, Jim Whittaker, played by Colin Firth, and the household staff -- Kris Marshall is the butler.

Jim is one of the lost post-WWI generation who was completely undone by the war, not the general horror of war, but the sheer loss of lives.  When he enlisted, his brother and most of the village's young men followed suit.  He was made a Captain, and these men were in his charge.  The very first battle they faced, more than 20,000 men died, including all those under his command.  He alone survived.

There are some truly funny moments, and the film does end on a high note.  Although usually described as a Romantic Comedy, don't go in with that expectation.  It may not be the greatest story around, but the acting makes up for it with a couple of really outstanding performances.

I think this is the best, most nuanced role I've ever seen Colin Firth in.  He's still playing a tortured soul, but in this film -- perhaps because he is in a supporting role and doesn't have to play the stiff-rumped hero, his character is the antithesis of stodgy or self-conscious.  He is excellent.  Kris Marshall, as the butler, is understated, but his usual quirky panache comes through.  If you're not sure who he is, he was in Love Actually and the British-French mystery series, Death in Paradise, a really excellent series (available on Netflix) with a lot of humor in which he shines as the replacement Brit senior detective halfway through the series.  Kristin Scott Thomas, as always, is excellent, too. She's a beautiful woman, and I just wish I could see her in a more sympathetic role for a change.

Good movie, well worth watching.",1504656000,,2790,4.550200803212851

In fact, I can't think of a single thing that this film was lacking, and the acting gave me a new found respect for Jessica Biel's talent.

On the one hand, Ben Barnes is adorable and it's fun to see him in something lighthearted and romantic--I wish it had just been about that, but the family dynamics in this film quickly make it a very dark commentary. I love Jessica Biel, but they really screwed up her look in this--the fake blonde hair was pretty ghastly. Colin Firth is very gifted, but he seems like such a jerk in this movie. They seemed to make the mother in the story the villain, and it was extremely unfair. I wish there had been a stronger female perspective in this movie so that it would have been more about developing a group of individual characters rather than a lesson in why women should shut up.",1483574400,4,802,4.389261744966443

3902032,4,B002BZTNIC,"Overall I thought the cast was very good.  You get to hate the Kristin Scott Thomas character but that is the mark of a good actor: to make you respond.  The film is enjoyable but I thought somewhat schizophrenic.  There are important issues presented and then there are moments of farce. In some films they might be considered comic relief but I thought the facial elements were not well paced for the context.

The characters sometimes suddenly sing.  The songs date from the Twenties, when the story is set except for a couple that seem to be way too contemporary.  If the songs had been confined to the soundtrack - most are, to be fair - they might have served to set the tone for the age depicted.  Having the characters suddenly sing was a little jarring.  (Is this supposed to be a serious, musical farce?)

Noel Coward fans might be attracted to the film but I understand very little of Coward's play remains.  Fans of Kris Marshal (Death in Paradise) can catch him as a slightly insubordinate butler.

To sum it up I sense the director wasn't sure ultimately what he wanted to say.  But the ending does satisfy and the film has some effective moments.",1473638400,,1161,4.555555555555555

3902060,5,B002BZTNIC,"The underlying story is about heart broken people trying their best and failing. The matriarch is holding together a tottering estate and hoping her son is coming home to help. Lorita, the brash American from Detroit,  is a wonderful character who, thank God, does not allow herself to be browbeaten by the matriarch even if she has to stoop to smashing a statue to do it.  And the American has the last word - almost unheard of because the English are master swordsmen when it comes to language.
World War I was almost unbelievably hideous with thousands of Englishmen, Frenchmen and Germans killed. So, this English family is limping along after the devastating war and, to add to their burdens, along comes the heir to the estate with his new wife, an American ""floozy"".  The females of the family, sprouts of generations of gracious living, find it easy to sneer at the slap-dash American with a past. Can we see shades of King Edward and Wallace Simpson?
Lorita carries her own heartbreak: she helped her husband die, rather than continue to suffer from a lingering cancer.
Everyone in this movie has plenty of virtue, including the daughters who are victims of a disinterested father,  too powerful mother, lack of opportunity and creeping poverty.
It is sad that the characters cannot understand each other or reach across the huge divides between the class-bound English and the freer but adrift
 American.
It is sad because it seems an indictment of the whole world. Yes, we all come from different directions and, when we meet, all is not well unless we can pull off an almost inhuman thing - backing off, being tolerant and seeing what happens?
Could the women of the family have welcomed Lorita? It seems almost inhuman to think it could have happened. Yet one woman welcomes her - the ex-fianc of Lorita's husband. What is it about her that makes it possible for her to be kind? I could strive all my life to be equal to this woman and still fail.",1455408000,,1960,4.702623906705539

3902096,4,B002BZTNIC,"Sir Noel Coward was one of the world's most famous playwright. Coward's humor and comedy can be an acquired taste for those not familiar with his plays. Unlike Ibsen and Chekhov, Coward was more famous for his satirical comedies. I have seen ""Hay Fever"" in the West End with an all star cast but I was unprepared for Coward's humor and writing. I personally find Coward's plays dated by today's standards. A Noel Coward fan will be delighted to see this film production of the play, ""Easy Virtue,"" with an all star cast and high production values.

Coward's humor focuses on social situations in British life. ""Easy Virtue"" is set between wars in the English countryside with the Whittaker family. When John comes home with his American bride, Larita (played adequately by Jessica Biel), his family particularly his mother isn't amused by her humor, style, and behavior. Kristen Scott Thomas delivers a fine performance as the disapproving mother-in-law. Colin Firth is fine to watch as the father.

The cast is fine with their roles. Biehl holds her own against Firth and Scott-Thomas. Ben Barnes is poorly miscast as John Whittaker. The characters here aren't multi-dimensional enough for me to care about them.

This DVD offers deleted scenes; the New York City premiere; and out-takes.

Still Coward's humor is an acquired taste. His humor is more reminiscent of Oscar Wilde to bring high British society into the limelight. Coward focuses on their shallow and empty meaning lives. He displays their hypocrisy and their lack of regard for the lower classes even their servants. The Whittaker family is going to lose their family estate. Larita has a past that comes to light. Johnny's younger sisters, Hilda and Marian, are deluding themselves. Mr and Mrs Whittaker's marriage is basically a farce for appearances.

Still with all the drama, this film is very British comedy with lighthearted moments.",1434240000,,1905,5.054140127388535

3902127,4,B002BZTNIC,"The post First World War setting of ""Easy Virtue"" serves as a terrific metaphor for Europe's diminished role as a world power and the emergence of America's.  The film focuses on the British Whitakers, a once proud family whose fortunes are beginning to wane.  The family patriarch, Jim (Colin Firth), is a returning military officer whose wounds are more than physical.  Mother Veronica (Kristin Scott- Thomas) as at her wit's end to maintain the pretense of an aristocratic front despite the truth.  Into the picture comes Larita (Jessica Biel), a vibrant American widow now wed to the Whitaker son Jim (Ben Barnes) much to Jim's delight and Veronica's chagrin.  This film masterfully juggles the comic with the dramatic though its outcome is somewhat telegraphed.  Regardless, the performances are terrific with the always reliable Firth and the luscious Biel holding her own with the austere ensemble.  The glue to me, though, is Scott-Thomas who turns to me what could be an unsympathetic character into a wholly empathetic one.  It isn't Veronica's fault that the rules have changed mid-game and Scott-Thomas expertly demonstrates a woman of her class at this specific time in history.",1406246400,,1191,5.166666666666667

Firth doesn't play the dapper lad in this film, he plays the father.  Jessica Biel is his daughter-in-law and Kristen Scott Thomas is the dragon lady mother-in-law of Biel's character.

Yes you know the end before it starts. I didn't expect to be so overwhelmingly caught up in the story and forget that they were actors and never noticed the clichs and almost sad that it had ended. Very seldom do I see a movie where I feel for the lost souls escaping captivity.

Veronica Whittaker (Kristin Scott Thomas) runs the English family estate. She is shocked to find her young son John (Ben Barnes) heir had purchased a French floozy Larita (Jessica Biel) for a wife. She is even more shocked to find out that the floozy is not French but American.

""Smile Marian""
""I don't feel like smiling""
""You're English darling fake it""

First we find that the cultures clash in a comic sort of way then we find that not only are cultures clashing but people and situations. The stories and people are too real to be an objective observer.

The basic story under the movie was adapted from a Noel Coward play written by Noel when he was 25. They saved about 30%. Also Larita was made a race car driver.

For those technically inclined I have only seen the Blu-Ray version so I cannot comment on the other versions. However the beginning of the DVD touts how great Blu-Ray is. And it looks like it has all the Blu-Ray menus and extras. Be sure to listen to the voiceover commentary.

3902181,5,B002BZTNIC,"Easy Virtue is probably my favorite movie at the moment. I've watched it several--well at least a dozen times because I love the music and love the entire crew who worked on it--from the screen writers to the director to the producers--and let's not forget the incredible cast--I love them because they are completely committed to the film, the project, the story. When watching the movie, notice how many times the camera shoots the reflection of the people in a scene--sometimes in the bowl of a spoon, sometimes in a billiard ball, sometimes in the lenses of Jim's dark glasses. And the ritual of smoking, which I usually deplore, in this movie is a trail that leads from one scene to the next--and is a symbol of defiance, guilt, and deception. ""Smoke and mirrors, darling.""

Colin Firth is at his best as Jim, the father of the clan. Kristin Scott Thomas is hilarious as his overbearing, shrill wife Veronica. Jessica Biel is fascinating as body beautiful Larita, an American invading the English gentry with her ""cat on heat"" presence. The dialogue is lively and dead on. Thank you, Noel Coward. And thank you screen writers for not tinkering with his words so much that we don't recognize them. The actors never fall out of character. The plot is tantalizing. From the moment we see the huge stone mansion in the background and the hunched figure of the gardener wheeling God knows what toward the house--the rain is coming down in torrents--and there is a horrendous clap of thunder--you know you are in for something other than the usual English country house party. The story sometimes is hideously funny, it sometimes is scary, at moments it rips your heart out--but it is always entertaining and filled with one surprise after the other. I'm still surprised by it--and I can almost recite the dialogue by heart--I've watched it that often. If for no other reason, buy it to watch Colin Firth and Jessica Biel dance the tango. They are lovely together.",1351900800,,1963,4.790560471976401

3902183,2,B002BZTNIC,"My wife and I were captivated by the trailer, and looked forward to an evening full of laughs. Unfortunately the first 30 minutes were dry and dull. There were the usual absurdities, which are so much a part of Noel Coward's plays, but the humor misfires more often than not, and I felt only disappointment for what could have been a brilliant film. I blame Mr. Coward, not the filmmakers. It was a mediocre play to begin with. As time goes on, Jessica Biel's character shows some genuine humanity. She was the only actor who was allowed any depth, and I was pleasantly impressed with her acting. The others, although fine actors, were strictly limited by the script. The final result was a feeling of bathos, with regret for what might have been a brilliantly funny production.

I watched most of the film alone. The rest of my family had long since abandoned it, which means six thumbs down out of eight.  My son poked his head back in later and asked why I was still watching. I said it was because of my uncontrollable masochism.  By that time I was a little bit engaged with Biel's performance, so I soldiered on to the end. I did enjoy the tango scene, and the ending was surprising. Still, as the characters in the film must have felt, I was left with the impression that part of my life had just been irretrievably wasted.",1344038400,2,1330,4.487603305785124
3902184,1,B002BZTNIC,"The premise sounded promising,but Biel in her role is completely unsympathetic,not strong and intelligent but simply brash and disrespectful,and the performance isn't particularly natural,although I have met quite a few overgrown adolescents who are just like her character,pretending their impudence is some kind of sophistication the world is simply not ready for,so I suppose her character is believable. We the audience are intended to relate to her somehow and I simply can't,nor would I want to.
No one in the film really shines. It is just a collection of cliches that we are not meant to care for anyhow (aside from Colin Forth in the father role. He is written as tired soul that we are coaxed to care for...Eh. It all seemed forced to me,as if I am automatically going to take ""their"" side against  the ""empty"" lot.)
One thing I truly hated was the  unoriginal and heartless Whoops-Dead-Dog storyline. Not amusing,quite revolting actually.",1339545600,5,949,5.116129032258065
3902185,4,B002BZTNIC,"Yes, this is a very old screenplay, a 1924 Noel Coward comedy about the differences between old England ( its landed aristocracy's virtues) and the brash, open, honest working-class American mentalities.  In 1924 the protagonist, a widowed racecar driver speaks her very honest opinions in the dining room and all around the elegant country house of a 7-generation British family.  She has just married their only son and heir, a young man she'd met in Paris at a race.  (As the ascerbic matron of the family says, he was ""flagged down"" in Paris).  She is loud, tall, skinny, a woman of easy virtue, a daughter of a Detroit steelworker, and makes her living winning car races.  Quite the shock for this old landed family, who watch and listen in horror to their new daughter-in-law!

To make matters even worse, the family is facing financial disaster and must begin to sell off 400 acres of their land to an adjacent aristocrat, whose daughter had been their own son's intended (unstated, of course, but understood) since they were infants.  This would have joined the two estates as one.  Instead, on a whim, he invites a penniless American to be his bride, one who was also a widow, her first husband dead of cancer.

Noel Coward is one of the great aces of racy, sarcastic, piercing conversations, with stabbing one-liner insults flying.  Our Detroit carracer, tall and unintimidated, carries on with loud and flat-out honest statements of her own, which sound to our ears - even if we are American - coarse in contrast to the rapier wits of this once-wealthy family.  No one appears to work at all, or go anywhere, except the servants, such as housekeeper, cook and gardener, a dwindling staff for a very large house and grounds.  The money situation is so dire that the Christmas party, the annual Japanese lantern fest to which all locals look forward, might be cancelled so they can keep the maid.

1920's decorum in England was still in place, in spite of the war ravaging their bodies, minds and morals, with the flapper era creeping in from USA and ""the Continent"" (God forbid, French influence!).  For the modern viewer, perhaps some of the shock of our carracer's statements falls flat, yet not to those familiar with past mores.  For example, the family considers her a woman of easy virtue, saying so to her face, hence the name of the film.  At the dinner table, the father asks, ""Let's have it out once and for all, have you had as many lovers as they say?""

""Not at all,"" she answers, arising to leave the table, ""some did not love me at all.""

Mind you, such a statement from a new daughter-in-law in the 1920's, would have been disastrous!  Not now?? Well...

Colin Furst plays the father, a middle-aged indifferent WWI vet, the captain of the men in one company - all from his village - not one of whom he brought back alive.  He is the only male of his generation alive in the village.  He was so depressed from the war that he'd remained in France, unable to return to his wife and children, living with whores and smoking opium, until his determined wife came over and found him, dragging him back.  He is a handsome man by many standards, but in this film he looks depressed, unshaven, frumpy, silent and angry.  The arrival of this carracer, with her blatant honesty, is waking him up.  They are attracted to each other for having both experienced death - she with the husband and he with his soldiers, both feeling a certain weariness with life.

The mother of the family is determined to hold things together in spite of the indifferent husband, the two insipid daughters, and the reckless son who wants to move to London with his new bride and have his own life.  She was outraged to learn that he had no intention to stay on the estate and take over from the useless father in running things.  After years of running things herself, she is exhausted and upset with her life and its failures, both husband and finances, plus irritating and disappointing children.

One reads that this film faced quite a lot of budget cuts, but it has a lavish feel, with its ultragorgeous 1920's cars, the beauty of the English countryside, the clothing, the jazz orchestra party, the servants in uniform.  For those viewers simply interested in another period piece of 1920's England, this film serves decently.

The plot moves quickly along, with conversations pinning down truths very harshly.  The film does become more and more serious, even black near the end, something not expected at the lively beginning.  Coward does not seem to be advocating honesty (American style) for its own sake, as it leads to rather sad results, i.e breaking a family up.

But he does not seem to be 100% for old-fashioned British morals and family loyalty, either.  This is what makes an interesting tension in the film:  which of the two directions will the son take, or anyone in this old rural family?  Our carracer is simply a catalyst, but if she had not arrived, would they have settled things differently?

I loved the 1920's Jazz pieces, but one criticism about the music:  the director is overlaying conversation with this as background, to the extent that conversations, so quick and witty, are hard to distinguish.  The ""Sex Bomb"" music of the foxhunt appears to be from Max Raabe and his Palast Orchester in Berlin, fabulous song, but done in a modern version, somehow not fitting to the scene at all.  Viewers can see him perform all kinds of old 1920's and 1930's songs on Youtube; he also comes to New York, LA and San Francisco.

All in all, a nice piece to see on a cold and windy night, but lacking in something satisfying...

EXTRA NOTE:  By chance I found the original screenplay in the library.  Rather different plot!  The interchange with the father is not there at all, except alluded to with comments by the in-laws about the new daughter ""getting him going"" with jokes and cynical comments.  That the various other rich young fellows coming for the other daughters are attracted to her - well, that is of course a problem; she is far too alive to resist, it seems.  She is decidedly older than her new husband, and rapidly finds him a dreadful bore, uneducated, too simple, a man cut out mainly for hanging about the estate, playing tennis and so on.  She was used to a much more exciting life in Paris, full of interesting and intellectual characters, so she suffers from boredom, reads a lot, finding the running about with sports to be childish and pointless, ""getting flabby intellectually"" as she puts it to her husband.  Her first husband hadn't died; she had divorced him, and she had had many boyfriends, but only ""two loved me"".  She decided at the night of the party to simply leave with her French maid in a taxi.  She was not a car racer, and did not appear to work at all, i.e. not from the working class of USA.

Furthermore, this family was not in any financial trouble at all.  I wonder that this modern film version feels that the family of aristocratic morals has to have a financial failing.  It's a very American view that the idle should fall into bad straits.  However, in the original, neither the family nor this divorcee appear to work.  Work (or a car racing career) does not seem to be of any importance at all.  Dismissing servants is quick & easy.",1338422400,2,7302,4.646921278254092

3902187,2,B002BZTNIC,"Although Noel Coward is dead, his life's work still lives on in movie adaptations of his works. Going in I actually thought this would be about a strong independent American woman who would not only shake up this stiff upper lip landed English gentry family but that it would be funny.

It's not. First of all, could we also retire Kristin Scott Thomas. She's looking more and more mannish, Basil, as she ages. She's a one-shot pony and keeps repeating these asexual English women. Please, Kristin, drop the ""Scott"" part and embrace your femininity buried somewhere in that stiff acting style you have. You can play a strong woman but do so with some sense of not going through the motions.

Jessica Biel is a delight as are the other young actors but they hardly get any screentime. Colin Firth is his usual solid best as a returning defeated war veteran with the soul of the romantic.

The whole story goes absolutely nowhere and it just ends full stop. It runs from attempting to be a comedy to a tragedy to a dramedy to who knows what.

The extras are also so run of the mill--commentary track, blooper reel and that's about it.

Another annoying feature is at times the actors burst into snippets of song and you scratch your head wondering is this turning into a musical.

The cinematography ranges from scenes in almost pitch black to sepia tones to somewhat dreamlike sequences. The whole thing is a mishmash of ideas and miscasting.

All I can say is at least Jessica Biel escaped with her life to go onto other movies.",1328832000,3,1528,4.595588235294118
3902188,5,B002BZTNIC,"WWI changed  England forever, and for the landed,  life can never be the same. When John Whittaker (Ben Barnes) returns to the family estate with a beautiful, bold, American blonde (Jessica Biel) as his wife,  his matriarchal mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) turns up her oh-so-cultured nose.  His father (Colin Firth), however, is intrigued, to the point that he emerges from the funk of the survivor's guilt he's been suffering since the Great War.  What sparks his interest is the panache with which his new daughter-in-law, Larita, deals with the barrage of nasty barbs launched by his wife.

The honors in this production, based upon an early play by Noel Coward, go equally to Biel, Thomas, and Firth, each of which turns in skillful, well-modulated performances. Mention is also deserved by Kris Marshall, in the role of the butler, whose urbane, proper exterior masks  a surprisingly rebellious spirit. Director Stephan Elliott provided masterly control of the visuals, using the subtle cues of clothing, furnishings,  makeup,  and inventive camera angles to convey what is not being said, to wit, that the estate is bankrupt.  There are plenty of amusing moments in this movie to offset the theme, that of an old way of life forced to give way to the new, and struggling all the way.  Pay no attention to all the critical reviews in the press, and treat yourself to a lovely afternoon watching this well-crafted  a well-crafted comedy/drama with a bouncy soundtrack of updated period music.

Colin Firth gives so much to any film he is in.  Stephan Elliott is really great.  Some folks complained because it moved so far from the original Coward play - but they requested Stephan Elliott to do exactly that - to modernize this 1920's play and turn it into a movie that would be enjoyable to a wider range of audiance.

It reminded me of a modern style of the beloved ""Monty Python in a way.
The film is beautifully shot with detail to the British country manors and costumes accurate to the culture as well as to the time period.
 Each actor was well suited to their role, although Kristin Scott-Thomas playing character of ""Veronica"" was stiff at the start and did overact a bit but then fell comfortably into her role easily as the manipulative and overly controlling mother-in-law from hell.
The Can-Can scene where the character of Hilda danced it sans ""scanties"" or underwear to please her love interest Phillip much to the dismay of both the  uptight mother and sister. Applause from the male audience members raised the roof and the amount of donations for the annual ""War Widows Revue"" show, also lessening the new American brides chance for acceptance.
The hilarious outdoor hunting shack scene were both Biel and Barnes were caught in their birthday suits trying to have a little alone time as dogs and people busted in on them, Barnes held the family dog up to cover private parts while mom fainted and the proper ""Lord Hurst"" obviously tried to sneak a glimpse of Bens nude wife.
Jim's(Colin Firth) sarcastic one liners were the icing on the cake throughout the movie. The goofy character of Phillip did redeem himself in the end when he acted chivalrous towards Biel's partner-less character at the start of the fantastic tango scene with Firth, was danced by both actors as far as I could tell. If doubles had been used the transitions would have been smoother and Beil would not have watched her feet, in spite of those flaws both would do well to be on ""Dancing Of The Stars"",they really were that good together.

3902209,2,B002BZTNIC,"In this carefree British comedy (adapted from the Noel Coward play), Jessica Biel and Kristen Scott Thomas square off as mother-in-law/daughter-in-law rivals.  If it sounds like a recipe for cheeky fun, you'd be surprised.  Very little about `Easy Virtue' really works, and the part that works the most is not even related to the two actresses (yes, I'm talking about you, Mr. Colin Firth).

Basically, this tells the story of a young and immature British heir who throws his family into a frenzy, especially his overbearing mother, when he marries an older American racecar driver.  After they wed they come out to visit his family, and his mother makes it her personal mission to destroy their marriage.

That's it in a nutshell.

The film is a somewhat franticly paced mess that doesn't really grasp the material in a way that suits the actors involved.  No one seems to be part of the same film (Scott Thomas is auditioning for a serious drama; Barnes a musical; Biel...I don't know what she's doing) and so they conflict with one another.  Biel, an actress who I generally like (and OMG she is beyond gorgeous) is a train wreck here.  You can tell that she is trying to capture the feel of the era (beings that the film takes place in the 20's), but she comes off stilted and overzealous in moments, and since no one else is on the same wavelength she comes off awkward and unbalanced.  Scott Thomas (one of the best actresses ever) is serviceable here, but her character is shrill, unlikable and clichd.  Barnes is atrocious.  Firth is the glimmer of hope here.  He actually pulls off balancing the aloof humor of his character while maintaining a distilled amount of realistic drama.

The script work needed some fine tuning.  It just didn't come together with the slaphappy direction (I'm not sure Stephan Elliott knew what direction he wanted to take this film, and it shows).

I'm still pained by that ridiculous shot of Scott Thomas's reflection in an eight-ball.

In the end I just can't get behind this one.  It is a forgettable film that has a sliver of good moments masked over by too many flaws.  I love English period dramedies, but this one just does not live up to its potential.",1291593600,7,2198,4.691906005221932

3902211,4,B002BZTNIC,"Noel Coward wrote EASY VIRTUE, his 16th play, at age 25. It ran on Broadway for 147 performances between Dec. 1925 and April '26, then went in London. As originally presented, this was a three act melodrama with a few witty dashes. The 2008 film is by contrast a mostly upbeat work, more along the lines of a Coward farce that ends happily.

SYNOPSIS--
The story opens with Larita winning the Monte Carlo Grand Prix but being disqualified for ""not having chest hair,"" as she says. She and new husband John drive out to the family venerable estate in Larita's souped-up German racer. An ice cold reception from everyone but father-in-law Maj. Whittaker is a harbinger of things to come. Larita's other in-laws treat her like a dog privately and put on phony faces when friends are present. Mother-in-law Victoria is particularly caustic. Larita goes toe-to-toe with her (much to the major's delight) and surprises Victoria with a tenacious resolve to not be dominated.

When later confronted with news clippings of her sensational American murder trial, Larita handles it coolly, explaining that her first husband was terminally ill and she injected him with poison at his request. (This trial ended in an acquittal.) Having suffered enough humiliation from her in-laws, Larita plans to move out even as Victoria demands it of her. John never stops loving Larita (in his own way) but this isn't enough. His refusal to leave the nest is a deal breaker; Larita decides their marriage must end. As she's ready to drive away never to return, someone climbs into her open sports car, but it isn't John.

ANOMALIES--
Based on the reading of a St. Valentine's Day Massacre news clipping, this story opens in February, yet flowers bloom, trees are green and folks play tennis in typically brief garb. Many of the songs heard or sung here are of the correct vintage. Exceptions: ""You're the Top,"" sung by Larita and John, is from 1934. Two Noel Coward songs, ""Mad About the Boy"" and ""Mad Dogs and Englishmen"" are from 1932 and '31 respectively.

Stephan Elliott's EASY VIRTUE is a delicious treat with many absurd moments, like a crushed chihuahua, a Can-Can dance sans knickers and an outwardly bland butler who has a secret past. Recommended for all aficionados of wry British comedy.

The winner, Larita (Jessica Biel), a beautiful American widow, waves at the crowd intoxicated in her triumph and as she does, her eyes met John's. And John stares at her, blows smoke and smiles. And his smile burns the screen.

It comes to no surprise to the viewer that two weeks later they are married. To John's family, on the other hand, the news fells more like a bomb.

Once the newlyweds arrive at the family manor the conflict starts. John's mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) takes an instant dislike to her daughter in law and soon the two women are engaged in a war of wits.

The young lord's dad, played by Colin Firth, is a shell-shocked veteran of the Great War who can't even summon the energy to shave. His two sisters are both a bit pathetic. But his mother, played with great gusto by the redoubtable Kristin Scott-Thomas is simply shocked that her beloved son should have married an American. The more she learns about Larita, the more disapproving she becomes.

Various situations ensue. Larita goes fox hunting in her own way, has an encounter with a lap dog not necessarily to the advantage of the latter and shocks the staid country folk with her American ways.

Basically, it's ""american liberated woman/gold-digger (?)"" vs. ""traditional english country landlord family"". But the family reveals cracks in this pretty picture : the two nubile daughters (especially one) are a little ""off"". Father (excellent Colin Firth) is nostalgic of his bordello days after WWI (he took his time to go home...) and seems not to care about almost anything. The head of the family is Mrs. Whittaker (Kristin Scott Thomas delivers an amazing performance), who immediately takes a profound (as much as unfounded) dislike at her daughter-in-law Larita, played by Jessica Biel, who gives here a stunning performance. John Whittaker (Ben Barnes), the son who married Larita before his family knew her or could have any say in it, remains a bit childish - and totally not up to the task of defending his marriage -, is very pleased to stay with his new wife in his old room. But, although very patient (and - almost - very agreeable to everybody) Larita stands the situation less and less. From there, things go downhill, even if the film contains still hilarious moments.

Set in that madcap period known as the Roaring '20s, ""Easy Virtue"" is an old-fashioned comedy-of-manners done in a rambunctious 21st Century style.

Kristen Scott Thomas plays Veronica Whitaker, the starchy and stuffy matriarch of a teddibly upper-crust British family whose only son, John (Ben Barnes), who should be fulfilling his duty by taking over the estate and marrying a good English girl of proper breeding and stock, has instead chosen to wed a cocksure, independent-minded American widow (Jessica Biel) who has achieved international celebrity status of sorts as a racecar driver. Needless to say, Veronica is none too happy with John's choice of a wife, and much of the story revolves around the conflict between the traditionalist Brit and the iconoclastic American whose mere presence in the family upsets the delicate balance in Veronica's meticulously ordered world. Colin Firth is the cynical, brooding patriarch who chafes at the restrictions imposed on him by his position and status in society and who doesn't share his wife's obsession with meaningless decorum and protocol.

Given the pedigree of its source material - a Noel Coward play first performed in 1925 - the Stephen Elliot/Sheridan Jobbins screenplay is a veritable treasure-trove of literate dialogue, crackling repartee, refined farce, tongue-in-cheek humor and finely observed period detail. There are serious scenes as well, involving the dark pasts and closely guarded secrets of several of the characters, but the movie never takes itself too seriously, never tries to be more than just a well-mounted amusette designed to make us laugh at the snooty upper-clahsses of early 20th Century England.

The plot does show its age at times - and the conclusion of the story would be flatfooted in any era - but the lively performances and the spirit of old-fashioned fun that run through the film serve as an effective lubricant to smooth over some of the creakiness.",1272585600,5,1957,5.242811501597444
3902220,4,B002BZTNIC,"While I would be the last person on Earth to say that ""Easy Virtue"" is a perfect movie, I will say that it's a highly enjoyable one, and its deficits are failures of quality.

Adapted from the Noel Coward play of the same name - filmed only once before, by Alfred Hitchcock in 1928 - ""Easy Virtue"" attempts to update Coward for present-day audiences, and largely succeeds.

Written and directed by Australia's Stephan Elliott (""Priscilla, Queen of the Desert""), the film has a richly detailled surface nearly free of visual anachronisms (one 1950's Halliburton suitcase aside), and a bang-up cast whose members obviously had a ball shooting the movie under, shall we say, lightly funded conditions. Their lack of rehearsal makes for a certain engaging freshness.

The script departs from Coward, and the Hitchcock version. Elliott retains the basic plot, which has Larita, a woman with a mysterious past, marrying the scion of an old British family, causing great consternation when she's brought home to the folks.  Originally, Larita's secret was a messy divorce, but nowadays, a revelation of divorce is hardly shocking, so Elliott changes this; now Larita's former husband committed suicide, assisted by Larita.  It's a bit uneasy-making, but in an age where nearly nothing has the power to shock any more, it was probably the best Elliott could do.

As Larita, Jessica Biel shows she has the chops of a true movie star. Her impersonation of a late-1920's vamp is remarkable, evidently informed by careful study of movies by classic stars like Norma Shearer, whom she is got up to resemble more than a little.

Larita runs into trouble when her new husband (Ben Barnes) takes her home to his Gorgon-esque Mum, in the normally attractive person of Kristin Scott Thomas.  Thomas doesn't do a great deal of comedy, and more's the pity, because she's absolutely terrific at it.  Director Elliott gave her the instruction ""More Disney witch!"" during shooting, and Thomas had the grace and wit to take the ball and run with it; she's a laugh riot.  Even better, she overcomes a very notchy place in Elliott's screenplay, where her character has to turn on a dime from comedy to pathos.  Thomas is able to make her performance all of a piece, making the pathos illuminate the reasons for her witchy behaviour in the first part of the movie.

Ben Barnes, as the son, is very reasonably adequate, but somehow doesn't mesh perfectly with the other players.  Colin Firth, as his father, has a thankless, underwritten role, though he does quite well with it.  In the end, the male actors don't matter that much; this is a great sparring match between Biel and Thomas, with both actresses entirely up to the job.  Biel shows that she's more than ready for better things, and Thomas confirms my long-held theory that she will one day be spoken of in the reverential terms presently reserved for the likes of Dame Judi Dench.

I find the end of the movie - which I will not spoil for anyone - to be a bit problematic, not in its construction, but in its details.  It's a trifle flat, given the rollicking couple of hours which precede it, and it could have been fixed so easily, with a bit of a tag involving Kristin Scott Thomas's reaction to it.  No matter. You'll still have a better time with ""Easy Virtue"" than with most movies in its genre, and I suspect its reputation will grow over time.  It's a visual feast and a comedic banquet.  As Jessica Biel says in one delightfully improvised scene, ""Gobble, gobble!""",1271894400,,3507,4.784411276948591

But John is to the manor born, and mother is nothing if not a master at plans and manipulation. Soon it's all-out war between mother and bride, with John's father, a burnt out veteran of the Great War, in the bride's corner ineffectually. Mother has a plan to join with the neighboring estate; only Larita is in her way. Based on the original play by Noel Coward, 'Easy Virtue' encompasses sharp wit, romance and drama; and although it is set in 1920s England, it is far from the typical period drama that might be expected.

John's father (Colin Firth), an unhappy veteran of WWI, is the only one in the family who seems to like Larita.

Based on a dramatic play by Noel Coward but rewritten by the director, this comedy of manners doesn't quite succeed.  Coward's wit is there, but all of the characters are equally acerbic from the start, tossing around zingy one-liners at breakneck speed; no one is ever vulnerable or sympathetic and the dialogue sounds forced and unnatural.  Biel is neither likeable nor believable as the roaring twenties belle and she over-enunciates each word like a stage actress trying to reach the top balcony.  Nobody plays a snooty aristocrat as well as Thomas, but the weak script makes her a one-dimensional witch.  Firth still looks too young to play a grown man's father and his shell-shocked veteran role is poorly developed.  Ben Barnes (John) looks suitably callow but is unappealing.  Kris Marshall steals the show as a funny butler.

OK, sure, it's not a *great* movie. It's very small-scale, taking place almost entirely in a manor house, and some of the characters are so grotesque that they verge on being cardboard. However, I was impressed by the Jessica Biel and Colin Firth characters -- both of whom come across as intelligent, sensitive, and possessed of a compelling personal darkness. The film also touches on some interesting themes, including the inadequacy of certain kinds of love. And, of course, the class system is extensively mocked.

While there are some funny moments, ""Easy Virtue"" is not really a laugh-riot. Actually the movie is quite sad in many ways, and to an extent the jokes are there only to make the more serious themes more palatable.

Possibly I'm overrating this movie, since I happen to like British culture and Jessica Biel happens to make my heart beat like some kind of jungle drum.

3902230,4,B002BZTNIC,"""Easy Virtue"" was quite a surprise to me - a pleasant one that is. I'm not really a fan of Jessica Biel, but I have to say I was impressed by her performance in this scathing portrait of British upper class society in the early 20th century. The story itself is based on Noel Coward's play, and the great ensemble cast make this an immensely entertaining watch. A young upper-class Brit, Johnny ""Panda"" Whitaker is smitten with a beguiling and bold young American racer, Larita (Jessica Biel) and marries her, much to the horror and dismay of conniving and manipulative mother, Veronica (a dressed-down and frumpy Kristen Scott Thomas). Johnny returns with his new bride to his family estate in the English countryside, and the stage is set for a battle of wills between the easy-going yet defiant Larita and the mother-in-law from hell, Veronica. Colin Firth (yes, I admit he was the primary reason I watched this) plays Johnny's dad, a lonely and dishevelled WW I vet who literally had to be dragged away from a bordello in France at the end of the war to fulfill his fatherly duties to his family. Yet his character is the one I sympathized with the most given his wife's monstrous behavior and utter callousness towards him, as well as her manipulative machinations towards the rest of her family, which includes two unlikeable and malicious daughters. Larita too elicits the viewer's sympathy as she is forced to put up with the conservative worldview of her in-laws and their constant put-downs.

The movie is well-paced, with witty dialogue and I loved the easy camaraderie between some of the characters, especially between Larita and Johnny's father, Jim, who are drawn to each other partly through their mutual suffering at the hands of Veronica. There is a magnificent tango scene towards the end which showcases not only Biel's fabulous body but also cements the close bond shared between Jim and Larita, two souls who yearn to be free of conventions and traditions. At times light-hearted, this is a compelling and scathing portrait of the British upper class way of life -snooty, cliquish and boorish. Larita as portrayed so convincingly by Biel, provides a much needed breath of fresh air in that exalted yet suffocating atmosphere. Recommended!",1259625600,5,2260,4.9317585301837275

3902234,4,B002BZTNIC,"There is nothing like a dose of Noel Coward to remind you of the dearth of genuine wit at the modern cineplex.  ""Easy Virtue"", an updated version of Coward's play, provides sparkling wit in spades.

Jessica Biel is formidable as the American bride of John (Ben Barnes), AKA ""Panda"", the pampered son who never was intended to escape the clutches of a rich and snobbish English family, but instead has returned with a brash interloper.  Headstrong Larita (Biel) crashes headlong into the deceptively thorny confines of a well-to-do family going to seed.  The household is presided over by a wounded tigress in the form of mother Veronica, played by a rather wan looking Kristen Scott Thomas.  Veronica warily circles the confident Larita, withholding her claws for the perfect moment.  Meanwhile, the father (Colin Firth) has been wounded in a different way and summarily exiled to the estate's periphery.  Two neurotic daughters (Kimberly Nixon and Katherine Parkinson) complete the cast and provide some welcomely dizzy interludes.

In the midst of some lovely shots of the pastoral British locale, the plot reveals the gradual escalation of tensions between Biel and Scott-Thomas, until the final, fateful showdown.

At times serious, at times playful, director Stephen Elliott at times introduces scenes by having an actor warble a line from a Cole Porter or Noel Coward song, and over the concluding credits, you'll hear the ""Easy Virtue Orchestra"" doing a light-hearted recreation of the Bonzo Dog Doo-dah Band's set piece, ""The Intro and the Outro"".

3902235,1,B002BZTNIC,Jessica Biel has a GREAT body. Jessica Biel is not a good actress. She can pull off garbage roles in movies that don't require a whole lot of range but in a movie like this she stands out. She stands out cause she has a great body (seeing her dance with a next to nothing on white silky clinging gown was great) but the other way she stands out is that she seems like an amateur actress compared to everybody else in the film.

There are also moments within that seem to be designed for a slapstick feel that end up being a little jarring.

However, if you love character pieces and don't mind waiting to get the show going, you might want to check into it. The mother-in-law or maybe better called monster-in-law, Kristen Scott Thomas is horrible. Not the acting, but the character. She is a perfect example of what bitterness unleashes when left alone to grow and flourish and poison a family.

Maybe that's why the slapsticky moments felt so jarring. Because the underlying feel of the movie is dark.

Larita's personality, hidden past, and sex appeal rub her in-laws the wrong way as she represents everything they are not. The film eventually becomes a test of love, with some interesting twists. The ""immoral"" one may be the one with the deepest understanding of love. I won't spoil the ending, but ""Easy Virtue"" has a few unexpected twists.",1254355200,3,727,5.008264462809917
3902239,4,B002BZTNIC,"One requirement for producing Noel Coward's works on stage or on film is a fine ensemble cast: if any of the characters is weak, the ring of intrigue and crackling dialogue fizzles.  Stephan Elliott (who also directs) and Sheridan Jobbins have managed to capture in the script the atmosphere and the essence and the tone of Coward's play EASY VIRTUE and with a cast that would be difficult to improve upon have created a sparkling bit of talky nostalgia  that resurrects Noel Coward's position in the world of theater.

The story is simple in concept: a haughty English family, feeling their foundations crumble, must face the new marriage of the heir apparent son to (of all trashy things) an American girl. How each member of this dysfunctional family deals with the surprise arrival of the son and his 'cheap' wife provides not only an hilarious and endless flow of quips and spunky dialogue but also a study in class distinction/prejudice.  Ben Barnes is the epitome of the heir apparent who has fallen for the American Jessica Biel (in a multifaceted performance that marries comedy to drama), Kristin Scott Thomas is the snobby disapproving matriarch, Colin Firth is the bruised patriarch, the sisters are the 'good' Kimberly Nixon and the 'bad' Katherine Parkinson.  To top it off the sage butler is portrayed by Kris Marshall, the only truly sane member of the odd group of characters.

The period piece is played to perfection with a musical score that is flavorful and nostalgic and scenery that captures the fading glow of England as the empire fades post World War.  Each of the characters tosses off Coward's delectable lines so smoothly that some of the humor and caustic wit are lost on first viewing but are compensated for in repeated viewings.  This is a film that glows, even if the final results of the venture are not entirely happy ones.  Grady Harp, September 09",1253318400,3,1885,4.8473520249221185

The last time ""Easy Virtue"" made it on the big screen was back in in 1928, via a silent film directed by Alfred Hitchcock that featured more darker undertones, but ""Easy Virtue"" is brought back to the big screen courtesy of writer and director Stephan Elliott (""Eye of the Beholder"" and ""The Adventures of Priscilla"") and co-writer Sheridan Jobbins (""Alexa's PArty"" and ""House of Fun"") and follows the play much more closely than the Hitchcock film.  The two are joined by composer Marius De Vries (""Moulin Rouge!"", ""Eye of the Beholder"", ""The Avengers"", ""Romeo & Juliet"") and cinematographer Martin Kenzie (who has worked on ""Babylon A.D."", ""Syriana"", ""Mamma Mia!"" and ""Tomorrow Never Dies"").

The film features a talented cast which includes Jessica Biel (""7th Heaven"", ""Stealth"" and ""Next""), Ben Barnes (""The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian""), Kristin Scott Thomas (""Confessions of a Shopaholic"", ""The Other Boleyn Girl"", Gosford Park"" and ""The Golden Compass""), Colin Firth (""Mamma Mia!"", ""Bridget Jones"" films"", ""Love Actually"") and Kris Marshall (""Sold"", ""Heist"", ""Murder City"").

""Easy Virtue"" had one of the most difficult film productions.  The film had significant slashing within its budget and was down to $12 million (the crumbling of the US economy and the  American dollar didn't help either) and to make things more challenging, Stephan Elliott's pre-production and production schedule was cut in half.  So, needless to say, the pressure of the short schedule and low budget forced the filmmakers to do some guerrilla filmmaking but in exotic locations.

The talent had to wing the film without any rehearsal time and rehearsal was literally shooting the film with several takes in order to make the film look believable. In fact, the talent knew what had to be done and thus, the female talents never fraternized on the set or grew close in order to capture the emotion of the film.  And at post-production, the producers cut the runtime of the film down to under 100 minutes.  Needless to say, for the film ""Easy Virtue"", its filmmakers and talents had a major challenge but in the end, I felt that the cast and crew managed to pull it off.

The film revolves around a professional race car driver and American widow named Larita (Jessica Biel) who has fallen for John Whittaker (Ben Barnes).  Barnes then takes her to meet the Whittaker family who live in a large mansion in rural area of England and look extremely wealthy and refined. The setting of the film is after World War I during the early 1920's.

The Whittaker family also includes:

Veronica Whittaker (Kristin Scott Thomas) - The family matriarch, cold-as-ice and very dedicated to her family lineage and her land which was created by seven generations of Whittakers who were farmers.  Not very pleased with her young son's marriage to Larita but wants him to stay home.

Colonel Whittaker (Colin Firth) - The quiet father who seems to be unhappy with his life and is often supportive of Larita in front of Veronica and probably the only member of the Whittaker family outside of John that Larita can talk personally to.  Colonel Whittaker has not been the same after fighting in World War I and has viewed life much differently since then.

Marion Whittaker (Katherine Parkson) - The eldest daughter that waits for a man named Edgar to come home.  For some reason, every time she sees a picture of a man, she thinks he looks like him.  Also, has a fascination about reading death and murder.

Hilda Whittaker (Kimberly Nixon) - The youngest daughter who likes/dislikes Larita.  Likes her energy and style but dislikes how the guy she does like, Phillip Hurst seems to have his eyes on Larita.

Other Characters:

Furber the Butler (Kris Marshall) - A person who assists Larita and sometimes doesn't like how he is treated by Whittaker family.  Thus he enjoys helping Larita anytime he can.

Sarah Hurst (Charlotte Riley) - A woman that grew up with John Whittaker and many have thought those two would marry but although John has married Larita, she still manages to care for him but also remains cordial to Larita.

Philip Hurst (Christian Brassington) - A man that Hilda Whittaker likes (he refers to her as sausage fingers) and is attracted to Larita.

As Larita tries to become patient with her husband and loves him unconditionally, she knows that the women of the Whittaker family do not like her.  From her accidentally sitting and killing their beloved family dog and not enthusiastic about the life of high society (since Larita was raised by a father who worked at a Detroit steel factory), she wants to move to London with John, so she can continue her race car driving career and that John can work and get a job.  Something that Mrs. Whittaker is totally against.

So, it becomes a battle of who will John listen to...mother or new wife.  And thus, Mrs. Whittaker will do what she can do make her feel unwelcome and her stay at the Whittaker home unpleasant.

Can Larita stay tolerant towards the Whittaker women and continue to live at their home while unhappy and what happens when news about her ex-husband's death comes out into the open?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Easy Virtue"" is an interesting film that easily benefited from the various locations of where the film was shot.  As mentioned earlier, the crew and cast had enormous challenges due to the cut in budget and so, a lot of the filming took place outdoors and in various indoor shots in well-respected areas of England.  The costume designer did a great job in capturing that 1920's feel with the clothing.

The film is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  Overall, I felt the look and feel of 1920's was nicely captured by cinematographer Martin Kenzie and although not a reference quality, vibrant style of film, the scenes are quite clean, no sign of bad artifacting.  Blacks are well-done, skin tones looked natural and for the most part, picture quality was well-done.

As for the lossless audio which is featured in English, German and Portuguese Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital), ""Easy Virtue"" is a dialogue-driven and music-based film.  In the commentary, Director Stephan Elliott talks about his proudest moment outside of the film itself is the music.  Composer Marius De Vries does a great job but it's the music which you will often hear Ben Barnes or Jessica Biel singing that sounds just right and natural.  Music from Noel Coward that seems just right and capturing that 1920's style and feel.  So, for the most part, the film is front and center channel driven.

Also, although ""Easy Virtue"" is not a musical, it was quite cool to hear the jazz 20's styles of music but featuring songs sung by various cast members.

Subtitles are featured in English, English SDH, German, Portuguese, Spanish and Turkish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Easy Virtue"" comes with the following special features are provided in Standard Definition, English Stereo & Mono with English, German, Portuguese and Spanish subtitles:

  * Commentary with Director Stephan Elliott & Writer Sheridan Jobbins - A very informative and fun commentary.  From Director Stephan Elliott who wanted to give Jessica Biel the opportunity to do something different for an acting role (and also when Justin Timberlake came to the set), to Colin Firth having to do the dancing scene, Kristin Scott Thomas who felt that she couldn't take on the part of playing someone so cold and of course, the many challenges the film faced due to the cut of the budget and schedule time for the film.
  * Deleted Scenes - A total of four deleted scenes which include: Standard Immigration Policy, Breathless Already?, You must stop egging father on and what will you do?.
  * Blooper Reel - (8:48) A blooper reel but also contains scenes that were cut from the film that were necessarily not bloopers.
  * New York Premiere - (6:12) The cast and crew talk about their experience working on the film.  The talent's favorite scenes from the film and more.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Easy Virtue"" was a fun and entertaining film. I enjoyed a film that was based in that 1920's era and enjoyed the various fashion and just the overall look and feel of the film.

I am unfamiliar with the original play but I thought that the film was well-cast and the subtle changes to make it more for a modern audience was also well-done (especially hearing in the commentary of how certain scenes were supposed to go).  It was great to see Jessica Biel take on a role so different from what she has done in the past.  The character of Larita is such a strong woman and despite being a tomboy who loves machinery and racing, she exhibited beauty and humor in her role but also a woman who felt by being forced to live at the home in a life that she did not want, she was slowly being poisoned by the man she loves.

Kristin Scott Thomas was absolutely great in playing the cold, Veronica Whittaker.  She is such an accomplished actress and to know there were no rehearsals, I felt that she nailed her role and did a great job.

Ben Barnes as the young John may be known for his dashing heroics in ""The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian"" but I felt that he did a great job in portraying a man who is in love with his wife but also his dedication to family.

And for Colin Firth, it was one of the few roles where he played a man with only a few words.  But it's that anguish you see in him that comes through in the film and although he doesn't have a tremendous amount of speaking lines, he more than makes up for it at the end of the film.

Again, I enjoyed this film but I'm not in the place where I can say that it follows what Noel Coward may have wanted or not wanted.  I am familiar by reading the many comments from many Noel Coward fans who have supported or have shown disdain towards the film.  It's also important to note that the film was given a positive review by the Noel Coward Society in which they have said in their review of the film:

Coward was the master of the well-constructed, impeccably witty play that eventually reveals some home truths about the emotional repression of the English middle-classes and the stifling repression endemic to the British class system. All of those elements are present in this adaptation. There are still lines of such wit and savagery that they easily connect with a modern audience and the message about the need to break from from the shackles of the past and embrace the possibilities of a new, uncertain future is timeless.

Who knows what value the Noel Coward brand has for a modern audience, but this is enjoyable and accessible enough to provide a substantial specialist hit.

With that being said, despite the low-budget and mounting challenges that the film had faced, it would have been nice to see a director's cut of the film after knowing that a good portion of the film was cut by producer Barnaby Thompson.  But I think what we have seen in the final cut worked very well.

As for the Blu-ray, for those who enjoyed the film will definitely find the commentary to be quite interesting.  It's quite evident that director Stephan Elliott had a difficult time with the shortened schedule and possibly countless squabbles with the producers.  Picture and audio quality were very good and although the special features was not plentiful, I felt the commentary made me appreciate the film even more.

In the end, if they had more time and money, would the film have been any different?  I don't know.  But knowing the challenges that the crew and talent had to work with, what they were able to make possible and because of the fact that I'm not too informed when it comes to Noel Coward's works, suffice to say, I found ""Easy Virtue"" to be quite entertaining, humorous and enjoyable.",1252972800,7,11892,4.741370928536704

  The characters are not very likeable and quite difficult to relate to. No fault to the ensemble cast. They did their job with as much vigor as the screenplay had to offer them.
  It's boring. It's not that funny. Even the dog is not very amusing.
  There have been many period pieces brought to film that successfully deliver and accomplish the British upper and lower class mentality.
  This is not one of them.
  It's cold, disconcerting, and not very satisfying.
  But, once again, a great cast capable of much more.",1252886400,5,642,4.633928571428571
3902243,2,B002BZTNIC,"I went to see this movie and wanted to like it, the problem is it's just not that good. It did not transition well from the stage, and I respect Noel Coward very much. Don't bother wasting any of your money on this DVD. Jessica Biel did look fantastic. I almost walked out of the theatre, but was on a date. It was a waste of time!",1252886400,4,331,3.955223880597015

8362602,4,B002BZTNIC,"Nice rendering of the Noel Coward Play.  The scenes about the dog are great fun, and the denouement is quite sexy, electric and fulfilling.  I only gave it 4 stars, though, because, sometimes, transitioning from a live theatre play to a film needs a deft touch that takes it out of the ""this is a play"" realm.  This film doesn't always achieve that.  But, overall, it's a very good film, and I'm glad to have it in my collection.",1520208000,,429,4.3924050632911396
8362603,2,B002BZTNIC,I think this was some sort of a tax deduction movie. It has all the right parts but it never quite works out. VERY Disappointed at the lack of chemistry between the actors  -- it is as if everyone is in their own personal movie. It never really comes together. How disappointing for this start studded cast.,1519257600,,307,4.385964912280702

8362609,3,B002BZTNIC,"Watching this movie, I never really felt any attachment to any of the characters.  It looked good (that is, the time period seemed to be nicely recreated).  The acting was good.  But something about it was a bit flat.  It needed more... more of something.  More story perhaps.  Yet at the same time, I think Easy Virtue was a pretty good movie and deserves more than three stars.  I would watch it again.  Lastly, the ending was a bit weird.  Why?  It's in the spoiler alert below.

SPOILER ALERT:
Did the son lose his wife to his father?",1516060800,,538,4.387755102040816
