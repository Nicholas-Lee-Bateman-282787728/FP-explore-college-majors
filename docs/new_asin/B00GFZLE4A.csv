8622701,4,B00GFZLE4A,Each story has a new and novel twist to keep things interesting.  Karlof plays a different type of character than normal and made it interesting.  A bargain price.,1510358400,,163,4.785714285714286

8622704,4,B00GFZLE4A,"Not a bad collection of classic TV episodes, considering that at least three of them are usually pretty hard to find on YouTube. Mr. and Mrs. North is probably the best episode of the bunch, with good acting and writing, and only one kind of lame moment. Boris Karloff is always good in Colonel March, and Tom Conway has some great lines in an average Mark Saber. The Public Prosecutor episode seems a bit truncated (and has no closing credits), but is interesting as it breaks the Fourth Wall several times in the episode, and Lieutenant Evans is nearly the star (of John Howard's Stephen Allen) for once.",1472515200,,606,4.62037037037037
8622705,3,B00GFZLE4A,"Interesting plots, but the movie quality is poor, probably because the DVD is made off old old TV masters.",1458086400,,106,4.631578947368421
