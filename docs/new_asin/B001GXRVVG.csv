3621980,5,B001GXRVVG,I BOUGHT THIS FORT A FRIEND FOR CHRISTMAS HE LOVES FULL METAL ALCHEMIST AND JUST GOT A PS3 SO HE  WILL BE EXCITED TO GET IT IN BLURAY,1260316800,2,133,3.75
3621981,5,B001GXRVVG,"If your a fan of the series, you simply have to buy this.
If you are not familiar with the series, you have to watch the series first.
This is for the DVD as the Blu-ray is not out yet but with the visuals in the movie, it will be worth it to get the Blu-ray version.",1225843200,7,267,3.7017543859649122
3621982,5,B001GXRVVG,I was a little late getting into Fullmetal Alchemist.  And what can I say?  The series was an AMAZING ride.  This movie is the perfect ending to a perfect series.  You NEED to watch this if you watched the anime.,1422835200,,212,4.225
3621983,4,B001GXRVVG,Well FMA Brotherhood is by far my favorite anime show thanks to some friends introducing me to it. I was excited to watch this movie but realized this was following the 2003 version of FMA so i was pretty confused at the beginning. I still very much enjoyed it but didn't know how the homunculi or how the characters were treated. So if you think this is for FMA Brotherhood its not lol. Anyway i still give it 4 stars because I still enjoyed it.,1422230400,,446,4.258823529411765
3621984,5,B001GXRVVG,Great!,1417564800,,6,6.0
3621985,4,B001GXRVVG,"For fans of the FMA series, I would highly recommend this movie. If you're at all familiar with the Legend of Zelda, this movie is the Majora's Mask of the series, taking place in alternate universes in which characters and events bear resemblance to their counterparts. It's also much like The Avengers in the sense that it doesn't contain much in the way of deep story arcs or character development, but you'll get all the one-liners and tag-team action sequences you ever wanted.

For clarification, the plot takes place after the conclusion of the original FMA series, and thus it will affect the way you view the ""end"" of the series. Some people like the ending of the TV series better, some like the ending of the movie better. It depends from person to person; I'm just trying to give fair warning that if you really loved the optimistic ambiguity of the TV ending, you should be aware that watching the movie will take away the ambiguous aspect. It would be like if there was a sequel to Inception that blatantly stated that he was in the real world at the end.

But yes, I definitely enjoyed this- it's a lot of fun if you liked the original series. For fifteen bucks on Blu-ray, it's a worthy buy.",1414368000,,1207,4.532110091743119
3621986,5,B001GXRVVG,"This movie is the continuation of the original adaptation of the series ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" not to be confused with ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" which is a remake of the series that follows the manga completely rather than only half way like the original version. This is a very cool movie because you get to see what happens next after the show ended! But again if you've only watched the ""FMA:B"" than this movie will probably make little to no scents to you, but i do recommend watching the original as its not a bad version its just an alternative to what happens in the manga, still the same characters and a fun ride.",1410134400,,630,4.633928571428571
3621987,5,B001GXRVVG,"Like I posted on 2nd FMA movie, I'm a huge fan of FMA. I loved very first TV series (during watching first time, I got shocked, was being sad, deeply touched and was happy)

The first FMA movie. The first TV series didn't go as manga's storyline which is mess up pretty good original storyline wide, but they concluded really good as TV series.

This series came out between first TV series and new TV series. so it based on first movie's storyline.

Totally original and it gave me clear about ending of first TV series. That's why I love this movie even after I watched second movie.

Like other FMA movie, if you are FMA fan, you HAVE TO WATCH!! most of times remake series is better than first series, but FMA, I recommand to watch both of them.",1406592000,,749,4.328571428571428
3621988,5,B001GXRVVG,"FullMetal is mine, and my husband's most favorite anime. You don't necessarily have to watch the movie, but it makes the series tha much better. Definitely have to watch the series first though.",1399680000,,194,4.909090909090909
3621989,5,B001GXRVVG,Providing great thrills and turns. The story continues off where the anime left where Edward looks for a way to return to his world and seeks the opportunity while dealing with the Nazi forces that wishes to intervene. Great action and good story telling. A definite must have.,1396224000,,277,4.791666666666667
3621990,5,B001GXRVVG,This movie is hi def and great sounding too. The story is action packed too. I recomend to any fans of the series. Also try the Star of Milos which is on bluray too.,1394755200,,165,3.8823529411764706
3621991,5,B001GXRVVG,"this was  a great movie, have watched it at lest 6x lol i really hope theres more to come but doubt it sadly",1390867200,,108,3.6956521739130435
3621992,5,B001GXRVVG,"First off this movie is an extension to the first Fullmetal Alchemist series picking up where the show ended.
It resolves a lot of questions I had as a fan and provides a pretty satisfying conclusion over all.
The animation and voice acting were both top notch!

If you were a fan of the original series you owe it to yourself to see how it all ends!",1390608000,,350,4.223880597014926
3621993,2,B001GXRVVG,"Personally, the writers should have left the series open-ended. I liked the TV series but this movie ruined it all. Sure some questions about the TV series were answered but the ending is a big twist. The character Ed in the TV series developed from a one track mind to able to think and consider all scenario. On this movie, the character seemed to regressed.

My Conclusion: Left a bitter taste",1388361600,,396,4.577464788732394
3621994,4,B001GXRVVG,"Great conclusion to the original Fullmetal Alchemist series.  If you watched the series and were left scratching your head at the end, well in this movie lies all of your unanswered questions.",1380844800,,192,5.0
3621995,1,B001GXRVVG,"Had the great disappointment to discover this film has nothing at all to do with Full Metal Alchemist brotherhood, the superior remake of the first Full Metal Alchemist anime series. Too bad, an ""after the end"" movie is really needed!",1370563200,,234,4.875
3621996,3,B001GXRVVG,"C'mon, now! The brothers are reunited, and Winry is STILL left behind?!? Alfonse grows up all over to become as obsessed with alchemy as Edward, then they're both stranded here to become blond haired blue-eyed gypsies in post-WW1 Europe. Winry just fades from the picture back home making everyone's automail prosthetics.",1367452800,,321,5.313725490196078
3621997,5,B001GXRVVG,"This is a great movie and a very interesting one at that. This movie has such a rich atmosphere which is very different from Full Metal Alchemist but it works within the series, before I was confused on when this movie took place, I didn't know any better so I thought it was either WW1 or WW2, but in my World History class I have been learning about the beer hall uprisings that Hitler did in Munich, and that is where this film takes place, and the movie ends when Hitler got arrested for his uprising. Whats great about this movie is that it knows its history well, people are upset about paper money, the germans hate everyone besides themselves, and it all just feels realistic. Anyways, I made a mistake when watching this movie, because I really didn't see the anime all that much, but before you even touch this movie, please watch the anime, alot of things will be clear, and it makes sense since this is the end of Edward and Alphonse's story. The story itself is great, *SPOILERS* Since Edward saved Alphonse from the gate, now Edward is trapped in an alternate reality, in fact our reality, where mechanical science was king over things like alchemy, and the story is about Edward trying to figure out of Alphonse is still alive on the other side of the gate, and Alphonse trying to get Edward back into their Alchemy filled world. Edward hates this ""new"" universe that he is in, because while he sees many familiar faces, it is just not the same as his home, and he starts questioning what is reality and what is not, and it is all just really compelling. But the most compelling part of the movie, and probably the series itself, is the bond between the two brothers. You really feel like they love eachother, and have a bond that is unlike any other. There are some really touching moments in this movie shared between them, and it makes you root for the characters. Well spoiling the rest of this movie is going to ruin the experience, if you have watched THE ORIGINAL Full Metal Alchemist anime (not brotherhood, that has a different outcome) then just buy this movie! its an excellent film",1364083200,,2108,4.520942408376963
3621998,5,B001GXRVVG,"amazing shpping time bought with season 1,2 the moive got here before the series & i order this after like a said amazing time lol",1363219200,,130,4.24
3621999,5,B001GXRVVG,"i loved the original FMA series and brotherhood. but the original is still better. this film wraps up the series and throws in quite a few twists with history. hughes is back in a different way and everything you love about FMA is still here.

great price, great quality, and a fantastic film.

buy it",1362182400,,301,4.454545454545454
3622000,5,B001GXRVVG,I enjoyed the Metal series!!!!  I was left in the cold when it ended and I'm so glad this one came through!!,1360281600,,108,3.909090909090909
3622001,4,B001GXRVVG,"This movie is a great ending to the original Fullmetal Alchemist original series, but not the best, in my opinion there are some things they could have done better, but it is still really good nonetheless. It keeps with the fullmetal alchemist spirit and wraps up the original series nicely.",1360195200,,291,4.84
3622002,5,B001GXRVVG,I bought new and i am completely satisfied with my product. I love this show it is the greatest ever.,1354060800,,101,4.1
3622003,5,B001GXRVVG,Great movie!! I really enjoyed the story! A lot of twists and it kept me on my toes. I would defiantly recommend!,1352246400,,113,4.181818181818182
3622004,5,B001GXRVVG,Love this movie.. I consider it the final chapter of fma before brotherhood...recommend it all the way. It gave me closure to this wonderful series,1348012800,,147,4.92
3622005,4,B001GXRVVG,"The movie ends the full metal alchemist, the first anime adaptation, all right in my opinion, The picture quality is great as is the audio dubbing if you are interested. I didn't much care for the first adaption since it was so different from the manga but im just glad things ended unlike so many other anime adaptations where the series just ends without any conclusion whatsoever. If you're looking for some closure go ahead and get this movie.",1335139200,,447,4.670886075949367
3622006,5,B001GXRVVG,this movie was one of the best movies that i have ever watched and it left me wanting more. I hope that the next FMA movie will be continuing from where this one left off and have a lot more alchemy fights in it.,1331251200,,212,3.840909090909091
3622007,5,B001GXRVVG,"This was a great movie. I was very surprised at how they concluded the seeries, this was one of the few movies that the ending caught me off guard. If haven't seen the series then you should watch that before watching this, but you don't really have to. it will be great either way.",1330732800,,282,4.2407407407407405
3622008,5,B001GXRVVG,"I wasn't exactly a fan of how the original anime series ended, simply because there was still a lot left unanswered. This movie cleared this up and had a better ending in my opinion. If you miss the feelings you got from watching the original anime, buy this movie. All those feelings are amplified in this movie. Seeing everyone back together just kicks all sorts of ass.",1330387200,,372,4.567164179104478
3622009,3,B001GXRVVG,"This film takes place two years after the end of the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime series.  Many of the characters from the series are seen in the film; those who have died are seen in the parallel world that Ed is now living in under different names.  Ed, who has lost his ability to perform alchemy, is trying to find a way to return to his world.

When it comes to the Blu-ray release itself, the packaging is rather ""bare bones.""  There is no actual insert with information for the film included inside; instead, there is an insert playing up other titles that FUNimation had released on Blu-ray.

As for the video quality, I have to admit that I didn't see a lot of difference when I compared it to the DVD copy of this film I had viewed previously.  However, this doesn't mean that it's a bad picture quality on the Blu-ray; all it means is that I personally didn't see any significant differences.

According to the box, the main feature is 1080p High Definition 16X9, while the extras are 480i Standard Definition.  For audio, the box says the main feature has Dolby TrueHD in English 5.1 and Japanese 5.1, while the extras are Dolby Digital: English 2.0.  However, I do have to question the audio listing for the extras, since one of the extras on the Blu-ray is a talk session with the director and some of the Japanese voice actors, which is in Japanese.

All of the bonus features from the DVD release are included here, as well as an additional feature that was not on the DVD pressing; this means there are six special features in all.  The first is the 40-minute long documentary, ""The Making of Fullmetal Alchemist The Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa.""  The ""Original Trailers"" include one US trailer for the film, seven Japanese TV trailers, and the Japanese theatrical trailer; the Japanese trailers included English subtitles.  ""Production Art"" is a slideshow that runs for one minute and fourteen seconds, and it includes character designs and backdrops.  ""Image Gallery"" is another slideshow, which runs for one minute and thirty-five seconds and includes still frames from the film.  There are also trailers for other FUNimation releases included as an extra.

The Blu-ray exclusive extra is a ""talk session"" with Seiji Mizushima (the director), Romi Park (the Japanese voice actress for Ed), Rie Kugimiya (the Japanese voice actress for Al), and Toru Ohkawa (the Japanese voice actor for Mustang).  This feature is in Japanese with English subtitles.  Over the course of 54 minutes, they talk together as a group, with the discussion being led by Romi Park.  Intercut with this are talk sessions with two of the participants together.  The full group discussions focus on the film itself, while the smaller group interviews focus more on the various individuals' lives and interests.  Personally, I thought this was a nice little feature.

If you enjoy Fullmetal Alchemist The Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa and own a Blu-ray player, I would suggest purchasing the Blu-ray simply to have all of the bonus features that FUNimation released for the film.

I wrote this review after watching a copy of this Blu-ray that I purchased for my husband as a gift.",1324339200,,3179,4.8462962962962965
3622010,4,B001GXRVVG,"FMA was the first anime I ever watched and I loved every minute of it. The story is complex and emotionally engaging with lots of twists and turns that keep you watching. This movie is a great addition for those seeking answers to some of the unanswered questions in the series or if you want a little more ""closure"" to the story line. In my opinion the movie did a great job at both. The blu-ray quality was great and it has lots of extras! I recommend it for any FMA fan. Can't beat the price either!",1323907200,,502,4.185567010309279
3622011,5,B001GXRVVG,I loved this movie. It was a nice addition to the first series. :) If you love F.M.A you'll love this movie!,1306972800,,108,3.9545454545454546
3622012,3,B001GXRVVG,"This movie takes place mostly in a world where alchemy -does not work- which kind of defeats watching an ""alchemist"" movie.",1306800000,,123,4.904761904761905
3622013,2,B001GXRVVG,"If you go back and read my other reviews about FMA and the sequel series FMA:Brotherhood, I make my difference in opinion about the two series very clear.  The original FMA series follows the existing manga at the time of the series broadcast leading to a story faithful to the manga storyline up to the series midpoint, then the producers ran out of material and had to create their own storyline from that point on.  While it is not a bad story in it's own respect it comes across more like convoluted fan fiction than something that would have come from manga author Arakawa's mind.  The ending of the series leaves many plot & character arcs unresolved and creates the interesting premise that the world of FMA and Alchemy is a parallel universe to our own reality/Earth and the Gate of Truth allows access between these two worlds.  Ok, this is completely different from where the manga goes, but that's ok.  It's a good and creative idea.

The FMA movie: Conqueror of Shamballa sets out to resolve this storyline ultimately now focusing on a human Alphonse on the FMA world who has taken up the mantle of his missing brother while on our Earth in 1920s era Germany, Ed continues to work and research to find a way back to his own world. Ed encounters new allies an enemies as well as getting caught up in a plot by future Nazi's who seek to use this lost art of Alchemy to force open a gateway into Ed's world and plan an invasion which Ed must stop.  Can the brother's stop this evil plan and be reunited again?

The ending of this film has and will leave a lot of fans of the original series with mixed feelings and compared to the resolution of the FMA:Brotherhood story, it is absolutely weak in comparison.

Onto the disc and features itself, the animation is absolutely gorgeous, top notch and you can tell a lot of money was put into this film's production with a very nice HD transfer to bluray with crisp and clear colors and detail.  Bluray extras are limited to extra commentary tracks in english and japanese as well as some trailers for the film.

The Conqueror of Shamballa was a fair effort to resolve the honestly messed up conclusion of the original TV series and even if FMA:Brotherhood didn't exist, I would say this was a decent film, but not really be compelled to rewatch it.",1304467200,4,2303,4.512019230769231
3622014,5,B001GXRVVG,First off I gotta say I loved the FullMetal series and it is probably one of the best thought out and extremely will voice acted shows I have ever watched and the movie does not pale in comparison to the show it actually raps up the whole series very nicely. The video quality of the Blu Ray version of this movie is clean and crisp it looks extremely good. The 5.1 HD Audio is done very well to. If you watched the show at all and liked it you need to complete the series if you have not already and watch this movie. The story starts out a few years after the ending of the show. Ed is living life like he should and Al has grown up quiet a bit and has become a pretty strong alchemist in his quest to find Ed. The story line of the movie is a very interesting one at that. I felt the way it was portrayed was very nice and ez to keep track of. Most of the loose end at the end of the series are all wrapped up by the end of the movie. The only thing I did not like about the movie was that it had to end. My advice is Buy this movie and ENJOY! :),1299974400,,1049,3.7945205479452055
3622015,4,B001GXRVVG,"The story can be very convoluted if you have not seen the FMA episodes to make reference to.  I appreciate the fact that the director, screenwriters and producers game Alphonse a more pivotal role in this segment than in previous installments of FMA.  We were made to believe that it is all about Ed, but we know that Al is just as important.  The way they made the interaction between Al and Ed in the end really can pull on your heartstrings.  That's how family should be, right?  There is so much for either fans of Al or Ed, well in my case Al.  I'm the older brother in my family, but feel more of a connection to the younger brother, it must be the fact that I'm more willing to sacrifice, lol.  The packaging could have been better, there is no reference guide inside or any other FMA promotion inside.  Also the artwork could have been better (i.e. FMAB's packaging).  Overall, good purchase to complete your collection.",1299196800,,928,4.476190476190476
3622016,4,B001GXRVVG,"FMA: The Movie is purely for fans.  If you didn't watch the show, I would very much recomend against starting with this movie.  In fact, if you haven't watched the series in awhile, I would recomend re-watching it prior to watching the movie.  There are a ton of references and nuances specifically provided to satisfy the fans of the series, and will leave the unitiated scratching their head.

As to the movie, it is a really for fans who wanted more as the series ended.  Some complained that there was not enough resolution at the end of the series, and it was very open ended.  These people will be largely satisfied with FMA: The Movie, which acts largely as a closer to the entire series.  Plots are threaded up, with some deeper meaning to the show added.  The original voices are intact, and the animation is consistent.  Though merely a fan service, it is a very well done fan service.  I was very happy with the movie and would recomend it to any FMA fan.",1293667200,,966,4.468571428571429
3622017,3,B001GXRVVG,The best version of this movie is the Collector's Edition set that comes with lots of extras as well as what's already included on the disc. This Blu-Ray version is quite good with the enhanced sounds. You won't notice the difference in video quality due to the fact that it is an anime - and it's very hard to compare the DVDs and Blu-Rays of older movies/series. A BUY for fans.,1289174400,,380,4.366197183098592
3622018,3,B001GXRVVG,I've heard and read quite a bit about the series and had high hopes for this movie. However I was disappointed to a large degree. The artwork is not terrible but doesn't set the standard. The story is ok but you'd have to be a serious fan to get into it. It has a few flashy moments but that's about it. Despite being on blu ray it still looked dvdish due to the artwork. Non fan shouldn't waste the money.,1285459200,,406,4.0875
3622019,5,B001GXRVVG,This particule anime series is absolutely my favorite.  It is actually something i can enjoy with our children and this series continues to expand and excite us with every new product.  You really have to watch the whole season 1 and 2 to truely enjoy how they brought this all together in the end.,1285113600,,298,4.5
3622020,5,B001GXRVVG,"First off, if you are a fan of Fullmetal Alchemist, this is a must buy. That said...

This was a great ending to the series. Fans who watched the 51 episodes prior to this were likely a bit disappointed with the ending of the series itself. It was rather open-ended, with little in the way of actual character resolutions. The movie, however, fixes this. it's a great ride from start to finish that leaves you satisfied when the end credits start rolling. Without giving anything away, I would suggest that you have at least watched enough of FMA to know the characters, but ideal you should have watched the entire series itself before watching the movie.

As for the video/audio, the movie looks great on Blu-ray. The colors are vibrant and the audio is crisp and clear...though there is a bit of an issue with line consistency, but over all this is a HUGE improvement over the DVD.",1275264000,17,884,4.5886075949367084
