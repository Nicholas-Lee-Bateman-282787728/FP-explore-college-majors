8657922,3,B00KDQVMNU,"I had better hopes for these DVD's.  First of all when they arrived, they were not secured inside the cases and the DVD's were moving around.  One of them was scratched, but still played.  The sequences are definitely beginner, and not really yoga.  I do not know what else to say.  I also have flex and flow, and that one is so much better.  I did not feel like I worked out at all when I was finished with the YogaAbs DVD.  It certainly did not tone my core, and it certainly was not a yoga practice.  I do yoga 5-7 days a week in a studio.  Maybe these would be good for someone very new to both working out and yoga?  I did not find them helpful.",1423008000,,650,4.0078125
8657923,3,B00KDQVMNU,"If you are looking to begin a yoga practice that doesn't follow the traditional mindset, Yogafit is for you. The focus of Yogafit seems to be on the workout. Yoga's focus, however, is on connection, balance, and grounding with the workout as an outcome rather than the primary driver. If you wish to learn yoga fundamentals then recommend you purchase something else. Yogis Travis Elliot and Rudy Matea have exceptional cuing and instructional skills.  I've been practicing yoga for about six years.",1421452800,,499,5.085365853658536
