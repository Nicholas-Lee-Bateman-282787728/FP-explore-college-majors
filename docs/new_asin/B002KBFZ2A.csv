He recalled the battle as though it was yesterday.  He added many anecdotes that he recalled and at the end, he was somewhat tearful and quiet.  I have always been proud of my father, but this film gave me even greater respect for the valor he had shown and qualities he in his children.",1381190400,,435,4.2682926829268295
