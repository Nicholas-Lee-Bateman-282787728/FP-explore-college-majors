7935422,3,B00005ALQW,"I love the actors in the movie, as Ken Maynard and Eddie Dean are favorites of mine, but the quality of the DVD leaves a lot to be desired.",1395619200,,139,3.8275862068965516
7935423,1,B00005ALQW,"By 1944, an over-the-hill Ken Maynard was unable to muster enthusiasm for his Western programmers. Despite a good cast (including Glenn Strange and Ruth Roman), Maynard fans will find ""Harmony Trail"" depressing to sit through. In fact, the low-budget production marked the sad demise of Ken's film career.",1368576000,,305,5.375

The credits list the character's names with their actors. The film begins with two men riding fast. The headline says outlaws robbed a bank of $30,000! In another robbery they escape in a stagecoach drawn by four horses. The police have the serial numbers of the $10 and $20 bills. Rocky in a new man in Nevada, so he wouldn't be recognized as a lawman. A truck races to the state line pursued by the sheriff. Three riders from the opposite direction pull their truck along. The men who helped them are threatened with jail! The robbers will have a problem in passing the stolen money. They have been warned against Rocky Cameron, he always rides a white horse. Their attack on a rider of a white horse fails. Ken rides into Rocky (they both ride white horses). Eddie Dean sings for entertainment. Who tipped off the robbers? A wide open town is a haven for outlaws.

Ken is a sharpshooter for the Medicine Show. Hodges sold 500 head of cattle at $50 each. The Medicine Show sells patent medicines through entertainment. [You can see this on your local TV broadcasts today.] This medicine can also be used as a liniment, or for cut fingers. Ken twirls a rope. [Is it as easy as it looks?] The robbers won't spend the stolen money until Hodges is arrested. Ken shows his shooting skills with clay targets, even holding the gun upside down! Eddie sings another song; it reflects the tastes of the 1940s. One robber buys a bottle with a $10 bill. Pop tries to remember who it was, but can't. The stolen money shows up as a bank deposit from a cattle dealer. He got it from Hodges. Rocky is introduced. ""Make no mistakes this time."" Ken, Rocky, and Eddie call on Hodges, he tells where he got the money. [Ken suspects money laundering.] Sorrell's men are drawn off. There is a chase for action. Ken eludes his pursuers, as does Rocky. Eddie sings another song.

Hodges is in jail, but he won't talk. Ken explains why it wasn't suicide but murder. [No CSI needed here.] Pop remembers who gave him that $10 bill. Sorrell plans to make a getaway. But Ken slips out to check Sorrell's safe. The gang shoots at Pop, the others return fire. The good guys win, and ride off. [Who tipped off Sorrell? Probably the sheriff.]

This is an interesting story that tells about life in those time through a low-budget production. Ken Maynard was a rodeo and circus rider, a veteran of WW I, who played a cowboy in the movies. He fell on hard times after these films ended, his circus show went bankrupt.",1281916800,,2510,4.50989010989011
7935425,1,B00005ALQW,"Harmony Trail was produced in 1944 during the waning years of Ken Maynard's popularity as a western hero. Harmony Trail showed Maynard past his prime. He was overweight, doubled chinned  and not his usual dashing self. Eddie Dean, the future PRC star and country singer, displayed the singing talents that marked his later career. I rated this 1 star not because of the mundane plot (typical for B westerns). Maynard and Dean together would have rated 5 stars anytime. The poor video quality merited the bad rating. Ghost shadows throughout showed this was derived from a VHS copy and not from film (probably because there's not one left or the poor and detriorrated state of those still in existence). This is becoming typical of recent Alpha Video releases.",1111881600,5,759,4.9296875
