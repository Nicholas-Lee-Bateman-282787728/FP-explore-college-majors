8302860,3,B001FWVKTM,"In the final installment of this series (there was to be a fourth, in 3-D no less, 'wonder what happened?), Shane Ryan shows he has no more tricks left up his sleeve, as this entry has too much down time and an abundance of repetitive scenes, leaving us without the shock-value of the first two. My personal fave was the second, as it improved on the concept of the first film and pushed the boundaries farther out. You would think having an actual pornstar involved would up the sleaze quotient plenty, but you're wrong. It's simply more of the same, and it drags like hell in the middle. If you've never seen one, I'd recommend any of the three, as the concept was truely unique, creepy and disturbing - sort of a 'how-to' manual for potential serial killers. Yes, it's that sick. (I ain't sayin' it's right, I'm just sayin'). Where as in the first two flicks I felt bad for the victims, this time the cat and mouse scenario got tedious, and Regan Reese got increasingly more annoying, and at some point I found myself saying, ""Just kill her already, would you?"". That said, I guess now would be a good time for 'The Final Chapter'.",1277078400,,1134,4.483091787439614
