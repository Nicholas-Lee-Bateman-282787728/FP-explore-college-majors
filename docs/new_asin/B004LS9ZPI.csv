4404103,5,B004LS9ZPI,"At first I failed to completely get the humor in this parody and chibi companion of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. It is set at a new pace from the main series (TMoHS), although it covers pretty much all the bases on things to hit up and spoof on and does so in a unique and hilarious way. Please don't put these collections aside if you don't laugh very hard at first! Pay attention to the show's timing then it will all sink in. I love the over emphasis on the character's quirks and personality traits from the main series and how well they could use these to make you laugh. Some of the humor though is spawned entirely from totally random things that will happen to the characters or they will do and is laugh out loud funny. For example there is a cat and mouse new room mate situation of Ryouko Asakura and Yuki Nagato. Asakura herself was able to regenerate her presence on Earth's time plane again to kill Kyon, then the camera zooms out and shows that she  screwed up this transition and was only able to return as like a two foot tall version of herself. So becomes totally dependent on Yuki for reaching the cabinets for food at the apartment and is oft the focus of Yuki's harassment and games to curb her amusement while together. One funny scene involving Haruhi and Koizumi was where Kyon was somehow in a spur of the moment act in front of Haruhi where he needed to tell Koizumi he loved him, so he dramatically said this to him. A few moments later Koizumi walks up to Kyon sulking and informs him the plan failed and he would have to leave and deal with a ridiculously large closed space that had just appeared.
It is all pretty quick humor in this series and fun. The way I broke down the Yuki and Koizumi bit for you don't do it enough justice though, you must see this series for yoruself if you have not yet! :) Also the Churuya-san series which is a second series that is included on this dvd collection and also fan made but officially approved and released by the studios is also good. This is a different kind of humor and I found it to be more adorable and emotional. It is funny as well though. If you like Lucky Star, four panel mangas and especially The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya you will find some definite entertainment for you.",1314576000,2,2269,4.351415094339623

More a series for Haruhi fans looking for some non serious fun.

Haruhi Chan was a web series released in Japan thats around 3-6 minutes in length per episode, the animation is clean and crisp, however it is nothing like what you'd see from Seasons 1 and 2 of Haruhi.

This is more a collection of random, funny, hyperactive stories that make little to no sense, but are just there to make you laugh and have fun, and wonder what the creators were on when viewing.

Please note this is not a serious series, there is nothing serious in this series at all.

This DVD has all the English dub VAs voicing the characters, and the Japanese ones too depending on what language you choose to watch it.

I would write an indepth review on this but there is nothing to do one on, its just that random of a show, and has no story, at all.",1309392000,2,918,4.308139534883721

4404106,4,B004LS9ZPI,"If you are a fan of the Haruhi series in any of its forms - be it the movie, TV series, light novels, or the manga adaptation - this series will make a welcome addition to your collection and will keep you highly entertained. Based on a popular fan adaptation, this chibi (a cutesy manga art style) builds off the already ridiculous, over the top plots and humor of the original series and makes it more so. Eroge loving Nagato plays with a mini-fied Asakura, Kyon is even more sarcastic, Haruhi more insane, and, if it is even possible, Asahina Mikuru is even cuter.

That being said, if you aren't familiar with the series, this may be funny, but something of the ""inside joke"" feeling of the show will be lost. But if you have seen the series or read the books, this really is a great supplement.",1306627200,,799,4.398648648648648
4404107,5,B004LS9ZPI,"Haruhi Suzumiya fans rejoice she is back looking better than ever with her new chibi ""look"" and more nonsense stories coming from the S.O.S gang.  The show was animated by Kyoto Animation also known as KyoAni  the same company responsible for the original series back in 2006, Lucky Star, Clannad, K-on! and fan-favorite Kanon. As a fan of the original series (2006) I have to say for the final product of what Haruhi Suzumiya turn out there were many disappointing moments in the show and is up until today that I can't understand why the first season has so much fame, I blame its ending theme for the fame,  but I doubt its fans noticed the subliminal messages about puberty, loneliness and  friendship  along with the nonlinear and  chronological order of the broadcast plus the skepiaring and convoluted narrative really were destroying the show for me, but overall was entertaining enough at that time.

The Melancholy of Haruhi-CHAN is however all what fans were expecting from the second season, it's simple, it's a fast-paced-comedy combined tons of that fine and clever humor from Japan and best of all no convoluted narrative.

CONS
- Chibi-Moe look may not be appealing to everybody.
- Episodes are not long enough.
-  DVD features are just TV commercials and anime trailers.
-  The intro animation only appears in episodes 1 and 14, as short as this series is I was expecting to see the INTRO in each episode.
PROS
-  Episodes are not long enough but they have more laughs than season 1 and 2.
- Fast-paced-comedy.
- The animation is the same style as Lucky Star, fluent and colorful.
- New chibi character design.
- English and Japanese versions are topnotch.
- Ryoko Asakura.
- Way better than season 2.

If you are an anime fan into comedies and want to have a good time, or a Haruhi fan so disappointed of season 2 because it was just repetitive, dull and without any morals to give, then this IS ""THE"" Haruhi you were waiting.",1297382400,,1944,4.668621700879766
8434734,5,B004LS9ZPI,"This series of shorts had me laughing at almost every point. If you are a fan of the anime ""Lucky Star"" then be prepared to hear more of Konata than Haruhi in the way the voice actress gives her performance. Be sure to watch the original ""The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"" before watching this so you get all the references.",1518480000,,325,4.433333333333334

Funimation have already done the work and encoded this set onto Blu-Ray. SELL IT TO US, AND SEPARATELY! This is completely unacceptable.",1469836800,3,313,5.1568627450980395

The best scenes are with Yuki and Ryoko, who is re-born as a tinier version of herself and lives with Yuki in her apartment.",1414540800,,382,4.536231884057971
