8166446,1,B000M53IIO,"This is a creepy movie.

It pretends to be a documentary, but it is totally scripted, totally staged, and feels totally false. It also pretends to be a tribute to Maria Schell by her younger brother Maximilian, and it is filled with so many clips from her old movies that it could make even a devoted fan pray for relief - but in actual interactions between the siblings he's so critical of her and so overbearing that it borders on abuse. Even the supposed ravages of her old age are faked and exploited for the camera, which is really infuriating.

This is a phony, cloying, suffocatingly obsessive movie that indulges Max Schell's obvious obsession with older German female movie stars. It's much like his equally creepy and equally phony&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/filmed-interview-with-Marlene-Dietrich/dp/B002HGRIAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""filmed"" interview with Marlene Dietrich</a>&nbsp;(only the audio is Dietrich; the video is faked with stand-ins), made practically against her will a couple of decades earlier, not long before she died.

After watching this supposed tribute, I cared less about Maria Schell than I did before, and I lost what little respect I still had for her brother.

8166447,3,B000M53IIO,"This has the ring of authenticity.  Made with admiration by her admiring brother, it does that best of all things:  it gives us a real look at an actress we have admired for years.",1396483200,,180,4.264705882352941
8166448,5,B000M53IIO,"I am so glad Maria Schell's brother loved her enough to write and produce this beautiful film - with exquisite music and photography - about her last years at her family home in the Austrian mountains, interspersed with scenes from her youth, and her films.  It was a beautiful portrait of a woman who was dealing with having played a tragic figure in the make-believe world of the movies for much of her life.  She appeared to be just as lovely in her elderly state as in her youth, if not moreso.

The movie treats her with great dignity and love. Although her son was not able to be there with her, she was surrounded by truly lovely people who cared for her a great deal, obviously keeping her fed and clothed.  It showed them taking her for walks, and when the electricity failed one night, the whole family came to keep her company.

Her brother was portrayed as gladly resolving her debts, and the family screened her visitors, but did not rule her life, holding on to her every minute, oppressing her with their anxieties, as families can sometimes do.

The scene where the house caught fire seemed to be a dream sequence.  The outside of the house was shown to be on fire, but she, curiously, was inside the house where the fire was safely contained in the woodstove.  When she `fell' on the path where she walked every day, she had asked to be allowed to walk alone, and her teen-age niece was within yards to help her up.

I am glad I bought this film which turned out to be a wonderful experience.",1341964800,3,1509,4.418772563176895
8166449,1,B000M53IIO,"I'm clearly in the minority here, but I thought this film was dreadful.  First of all, it is not a documentary.  All the scenes are artsily photographed reenactments played out by Maximillian Schell, his family, and a bunch of other people who appear to be non-actors, ostensibly representing things that happened in real life.  Their ""performances"" are stilted and clumsy, and Schell and his wife deliver their lines with great and weighty poetic measure like they're auditioning for a Bergman movie.  But, worst of all, poor Maria Schell, who is late into what appears to have been a long slide down into dementia, is made to participate in these scenes.  Mr. Schell repeatedly makes the claim that she has abdicated responsibility for her life and lives in a paradise for which other people must pay, but her doctor (or the guy playing her doctor) clearly says that she has a degenerative disease of the brain and is not in control of her faculties.  Her ""paradise"" seems more like a hell. -- And here's her brother to make a movie out of it and to reveal to the world how far she's fallen.

This is an extraordinary exercise in vanity and passive-aggressive exploitation. The only good thing is that there are many brief clips from Maria Schell movies.  They show what a remarkable actress she was and make me want to see more of her work.",1329264000,3,1343,4.685106382978724

8166451,5,B000M53IIO,This is a great documentary from acclaimed actor and filmmaker Maximilian Schell.  Maria Schell was my favorite actress when I was growing up and it was wonderful to see her again.  I had no idea what had become of her and it was interesting to see her now as an old woman.  I really enjoyed this film.,1234656000,3,302,4.2631578947368425
8166452,5,B000M53IIO,"When Maximilian Schell directed his first effort ""Marlene"" in 1984, he was challenged with a camera shy Marlene Dietrich and had to find a way to hold our interest. He succeeded!  Now, with his 2nd feature, ""My Sister Maria"", about the later years of his actress sister Maria Schell, he makes us voyeurs into the the decline of a box office ingenue. Maria Schell was a favorite in films from the 1940's to the 1960's, and beyond.  In old age, she suffered from dementia, and a myriad of health problems.  She died in 2005 from pneumonia.  Before she passed away, her brother made her the subject of this film.

When I started watching the film, I thought that the elderly woman on the screen was a stand-in, because she was totally unrecognizable to me.  It became apparent, it was ACTUALLY Maria Schell.  We as viewers, bear witness to how cruel old age can be. I admit, that some of the things that Ms. Schell was doing made me uncomfortable.  Some of the situations are obviously staged.  But in any event, I thought if someone was doing irrational things, you'd get a caretaker.  There's a scene in the film, where Maria is walking on a snowy path alone, and she falls.  My first thought was, why wasn't anyone holding on to her, if she was that unsteady?  Why would you comprise a loved one's safety for the sake of art?  Another scene has Maria sitting in front of 11 television sets, watching her old films.  Again, I was thinking, why isn't anyone taking this woman out for stimulation?  Unfeeling of the family, to just let her vegetate.  There is a scene where Ms. Schell's property is being attached for unpaid bills.  She is then shown on the telephone ordering two huge chandeliers, again unsupervised.  The scene that disturbed me the most, was when she was lighting a fire in the fireplace by herself, and she lights a newspaper to start the fire, and accidentally drops it into a pile of wood next to the fireplace. We then see the house in flames.  What was the family thinking???

My impression after the film ended was, yes, the family took some notice after she lost her fortune, but too little, too late.  Her children should have been more attentive.  She was crying for help, but no one was paying much attention to her.  Or were they neglecting her because she wasn't around while they were growing up?  It was said that she was too busy with stardom when they were young.  Absolutely heart wrenching.

Some have said that Maximilian Schell filmed this out of spite, because of professional jealousy, or was just bitter because he had to come to his sister's rescue, financially.  Could be. I didn't think it was fair to show a helpless elderly woman, getting herself into trouble, after leading such a charmed life.  This documentary really poses questions about the motive for painting such a horrible portrait of a once vibrant woman.  Why didn't Schell let her die with dignity?

I do want to say, that this documentary is VERY well directed. Maximilian Schell, draws us in, and makes us care about this poor woman.  I came out being more of a fan than I already was.  It's difficult to hate this film with all of it's poignant scenes.  But, the truth is, this could happen to us all, either with loved ones, or to ourselves.",1195603200,14,3253,4.5823223570190645
