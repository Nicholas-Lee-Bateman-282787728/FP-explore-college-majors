8649587,3,B00JBCGBC4,"A CIA agent (Kevin Costner) is forced to retire after acquiring an exotic illness. Now with the short time left on this mortal coil he turns to the family that he neglected. But wait there's an experimental drug that may change the situation. The cost to him is to get back into the game. Oh did I mention they're hallucinatory side effects which may gum up the works.

There is a wide range of opinion from people viewing this movie. Yes it is formula; some people like the formula and some people don't. It's predictable; some people like predictability and some people don't.

The fun in the movie is not the story but the interaction between the characters in the story. Instead of the simple shoot-em-up, we learned a little about parenting skills. Both shoot them up and parenting skills can be fun. This film is well worth the watching. Do not let naysayers sway you from what might be an entertaining presentation.

FYI I only saw this in Blu-ray and the filming was well done. The music was a tad loud and overdone in some places.",1504828800,,1039,4.545454545454546
