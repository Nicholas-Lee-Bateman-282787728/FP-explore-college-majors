8100121,5,B000CPJKWM,I am over 70. I got this at Blockbuster sometime ago and wanted it. This the first time that I have found it. Thank you.,1473811200,,120,3.84
8100122,5,B000CPJKWM,"Visually the image quality is almost as good as the original VHS tape that I still have (which has lost its audio now BTW). I noticed a tiny bit of censorship where Betty's reference to Nooky-Monster's activities has been cut from the scene in Harry's office. The latex and 1980's hair styles sure stand out now, as much as Betty & her bosom buddies do. Recommended for Kitten fans!",1443744000,,382,4.550724637681159

8100125,4,B000CPJKWM,The cover was not the one on the sell but the movie is sexy and funny the best part of the movie is that every time they play the same music she start takin' it off.,1395705600,,165,3.611111111111111
8100126,5,B000CPJKWM,"You buy this for one reason and one reason only - because you're a fan of the beautiful Kitten Natividad!  She gets nude a LOT in this movie, living up to the title, and makes it VERY worth the money!  The music is pretty terrible, so watch it with sound once, to get the point, then for future viewings, add your own soundtrack and just enjoy the eye candy!  And wish YOU were the guy whose desk she's dancing nude on!",1391472000,2,419,4.148148148148148
8100127,3,B000CPJKWM,"This movie is based on the original VHS title called ""Takin' It All Off"". It's a story about a busty woman (Kitten Natividad) who wants a modeling job, but her boobs are too big. She is sent to place after place, along with working in a strip club to make ends meet, meeting doctors, health pros, fitness centers, who try to help her lose her boob size, but none of them are working out for her.

One thing to note, this is more soft core than hard core adult movie. If this were the 1980's, this movie would definitely be showing on HBO/SHOW TIME/CINEMAX after midnight (Yeah, during my youth I figured out that was the time boobs were showing ^_^ ) One thing to note, this is a ""Region 0"" DVD format. (Meaning this was designed for European DVD players, not American, with the exception of PC DVD players as most PC DVD players/programs have no regional limitations) Interestingly enough, the company who sent me this DVD warned through e-mail told me ahead of time about the regional settings, although it is explained on the info section that it is a ""Import, PAL"" format with further info explaining that this is a Region ""0"" DVD. It was nice of the company to inform me of this, but I was well aware as it is important to read ALL details of the item you are buying so you get an idea of what to expect, not just from how to play the DVD, but if it will be compatible.

The video is of good quality as it is obviously a direct transfer from VHS to DVD. The plus side is that the DVD allows you select how far into the movie you want to see. (Scene selection) Overall interesting movie. Lots of nudity, lots of girls, bad acting, even the jokes (puns) are really bad. For fans of either the movie or Kitten Natividad. Adults only please.",1373932800,3,1742,4.324159021406728
8100128,1,B000CPJKWM,"Kitten was not flat, just the movie.  first of all it is very short. maybe 30 minutes. Kitten does some nice strip tease but that is it.  horribly over priced. they must have seen me coming. I have regifted this turkey///buyer beware...",1326672000,9,236,4.595238095238095
8100129,3,B000CPJKWM,"This was hilarious. The whole plot is about a women named Betty Boobs, or Betty Jugs, or something like that? She wants a part in a movie, but they tell her that her breasts are just too big! How discriminative! So she goes seeking help from perverted doctors and sleazy promoters till she finally ends up in an exorcise camp to lose a few pounds off her jugs!

The movie is funny in the way of it being ridiculously funny, not classic joke funny... I'd say it's a bunch of porno actors who wanted to do a movie of a different kind, but the acting is just as good as any X rated film.

This is not a family film, I don't know if the ladies would like it, they might laugh at how stupid it is, but I know the manly man will probably get a kick out of it. There is plenty of nudity and goofiness to go around.

The only downfall is the theme song really becomes annoying by the end of it, unless you take a liking to it the 1st times it's played and don't mind hearing it 100 more times.

It would be interesting to see this put on DVD with a bonus section to see how it actually got made in the first place and why. Still, don't think I'm putting the thing down, it's a hoot... ers.

Amazon asking prices are ridicules.. it seems whenever something goes out of print, like this 1985 VHS, they seem to think some gullible prat will pay more then a few bucks for it... I have seen a bootleg on the net featuring both this movie, and it's 1987 sequel ""Taking it ALL off"" on the same DVD disc for a much more reasonable price then an overpriced VHS copy.

You could probably find this in pawn shops for under a buck. And if you do, definitely fork out some chump change and have a look at how hilariously bad, yet funny, this movie is!",1315699200,7,1730,4.088495575221239
