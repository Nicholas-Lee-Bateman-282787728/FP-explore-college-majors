Beyond non-conformity and attitude (anger & strife), DIY is the basis for TRUE punk, not wanting to be some famous pop punk on a major label spending paychecks at Hot Topic. DIY: making your own style/clothes, your own records and shows, your own creativity, is what still keeps authentic punk alive, against this decade's homogenized trendy version. Isolation, boredom and a sense of community are the strongest ingredients that built the DIY lifestyle Little Rock, and elsewhere. Inspiring documentary of a typical American town putting exercising activity and positivity, in complete unity without factions, against the grain. I really had no idea there was such a strong scene there, and actually makes me wish I'd been there to experience it. I highly recommend buying the (inexpensive) box set (amazon), that includes 2 extra discs of live show footage. Totally worth checking out, though I find the 80-90s disc to be far better than the latter.",1313712000,,1068,5.073863636363637

Very few people might ever guess how inspired and committed the punk scene was in Little Rock, Arkansas.  It was the essence of DIY to the fullest and created a sense of oneness between those who ordinarly didn't ""fit in"".  The scene included all, black and white - one's skin color never mattered.  All that did was that you were contributing to the punk scene and its advancement...

What's more, some very awesome and influential punk bands emerged out of Little Rock such as Trusty, five-0, Chino Horde, and the Numbskulz just to name a few.

Production wise, the documentary is very well constructed and well organized.  The interviews are also quite interesting and well shot.  All the band members/record store owners/record producers/indie record label owners all seem quite genuine as well as intelligent - for punk rockers and rockers in general they are all very well spoken and are great at holding your attention.  There's also really great footage and images from the late 80's and early 90's that make you feel like you're back in that era.  Granted, it is Arkansas so you don't see such rebellious clothing and hair styles as you would in New York.  But these kids are every bit as punk rock, for sure.

Another great thing is seeing these kids all grown up as thirty-something adults and the effects and influence punk rock, and music in general, has had on their lives.  I also love how so many of them moved on to other big cities but still wound up keeping their bands together and even touring and recording records when possible...

Overall, I give this one an A.  If you love punk rock or any kind of rock for that matter, this is a fun and inspiring watch.  It's a unique look at how a really amazing punk scene grew quite large in a very unlikely town.",1248220800,3,1983,4.494413407821229
