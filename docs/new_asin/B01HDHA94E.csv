8765131,4,B01HDHA94E,"This movie is bad, but I appreciate the effort of the cast and crew.  The cinematography wasn't that great and the shooting style and establishing shots could definitely use improvement. Some of the acting was quite terrible but with a kitchy plot and a throwback soundtrack it was still entertaining. I hope they keep at it.",1503619200,,325,4.803571428571429
8765132,1,B01HDHA94E,"Where do I start? This has to be the worst film ever! Everything from the plot to the acting sucks! I tried to hang in there bc I thought it might be a little like Friday the 13th, but I just couldn't do it.",1503532800,3,207,3.727272727272727
8765133,1,B01HDHA94E,"I give the independent filmmaker credit for attempting to make a movie. This movie is bad, because there is no suspense, no horror, and horrible murder scenes.
The dvd cover art has nothing to do with what you see in the movie.",1489708800,,227,4.428571428571429
