8427969,5,B004FN26L4,"""Sex, Lies and Gender"" is a fascinating National Geographic documentary about transsexuality and intersexuality, featuring Dr. Tiger Howard Devore, the Indian celebrity Rose Venkatesan and biologist Joan (ex-John) Roughgarden, author of ""Evolution's rainbow"".

Interestingly, the documentary isn't constructivist, and actually attacks John Money, the psychologist who attempted to turn a boy child into a girl, with tragic consequences. While distancing itself from the idea that gender is a purely social construct, ""Sex, Lies and Gender"" believes that the male-female binary *is* such a construct. In reality, humans have more than two genders, with transsexuals and intersex people representing additional ""genders"" along a continuum. People are born with their gender identities, but there are more than two of them!

In the documentary, we meet a former U.S. soldier who didn't realize he was hermaphroditic until rather late in life (he now lives as a female), a child who is physically a boy but who is utterly convinced of being a girl and Indian transsexuals known as hijras. The latter, for long an oppressed caste in Indian society, has finally gotten an able spokesman (or spokeswoman!) in Rose Venkatesan. ""Sex, Lies and Gender"" also features an interview with pro-intersex psychologist Devore and the previously mentioned Roughgarden, whose book ""Evolution's rainbow"" I've reviewed elsewhere here on Amazon.

All in all, a very interesting and well done documentary, taped by National Geographic, which I always assumed was something of a mainstay of dead White colonial male-ism. It seems National Geographic have finally been ""queered""!

8427970,4,B004FN26L4,"This doc said that the rigid dividing line between male and female is false.  They then highlight an intersexed person, a transgender youth, and an Indian hijra.
I so applaud National Geographic for covering a topic that many would want to ignore.  This will be an eye-opener for many.  However, if you have read much about transgenderism, then this will seem quite old-hat.  Also, if you look at it a particular way, this focused on male to female.  Those interested in female to male may feel left out and insulted.  This happens often with rainbow-flag materials where the boys are emphasized over the gals.
I wish this would have covered the meeting of sexuality and transgender.  For example, I love that this showed an opposite-sex couple that accepted their transkid.  The work suggests that his school and his home state did as well.  However, what happens when he develops a crush on a boy?  What happens if s/he develops a crush on a girl?  Here are conflicts in which I doubt there could be a clear winner and non-winner.
This work didn't interview Brown University's Dr. Anne Fausto-Sterling, whom I assume to be the lead expert in this area.  I imagine this doc would be especially help to show in school that have transkids in them.",1294185600,2,1246,4.717592592592593
