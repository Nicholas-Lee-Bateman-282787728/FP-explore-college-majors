3991011,3,B002UJIY8O,"I liked what I saw, but was dissapointed at the ending. they should have continued up to the present. The history of the church, the splits etc...
Other than that it was ok.",1350345600,,173,4.2727272727272725
3991012,3,B002UJIY8O,"I was impressed with the way the film was able to capture the historical context of 1st century Palestine. What Nazareth was like and how they presented Jerusalem as the prestigious center of Jewish culture and wealth at the time. I think many westerners today don't really understand the difference between the two  and how Rome influenced the local political sentiment of the time.
 However I was very disappointed in the interpretation of exactly what made Jesus such a controversy of his day. The documentary portrays him as an oppressed man with an alternative message and philosophy on how one can get to heaven. And while that is partly true, its much more than another competing paradigm.

What really made Jesus a controversy was that he claimed to be the sole purpose and fulfillment for all Jewish tradition and law. That he was the Messiah that the prophet Isiah foretold roughly 700 years prior. He was not just a man with a political message. They skip almost all scripture readings of Jesus claiming to be God incarnate. They portray him as a passionate street preacher who was able to capture the spirit of the age through his message, similar to other revolutionaries like William Wallace or Sam Adams.

  If they really wanted to capture what made Jesus so hated and outrageous they would have shown the grandeur of Jerusalem, which they did extremely well. Then they would have showed Jesus preaching in the epicenter of Jerusalem, in temples, to the high ""RockStar"" priest that all their sacrifices represented him. That he was the fulfillment of their law and he was here to forgive them of their sins(An attribute only  God could possess and no one else). If they would have shown more of that then you could see why the priest charged him as a dammed blasphemer. Why what he was preaching was more than just political issues of the time. What he claimed himself to be, especially during this tumultuous and brutal time, was nothing short of a wishful death sentence.

  C.S. Lewis was right when he said Jesus won't let you secularize him as nothing more than a man with a good teaching, like Buddha or Socrates. Jesus claimed to be the Jewish conception of God,turned flesh. During his time this would make him either completely and utterly insane, like a man convinced he was a chicken. Or that he was who he claimed to be. That's the heart of the controversy, that's what I was hoping they would address. Again, they did an excellent job and it was great to watch, I just think they mixed and ultimately missed his real controversy.",1348185600,47,2558,4.72808988764045
3991013,4,B002UJIY8O,"Anyone who has studied religion in a scientific form, meaning, to use EVIDENCE (archaeology, anthropology, history, and other sciences) instead of myths and opinions, especially opinions from approximately 1800-2000 years ago when early man didn't even realize that the earth was round, that the sun didn't revolve around the earth, that epilepsy was an illness not something that happened because you were evil, or many, many other unknowns ...then you know that there are way too many Christians who need to research their own religion.

Many Christians do not know that the foundation of their religion (Judaism) was once a polytheistic (worshiping more than one god) religion, they've never heard of the Enuma Elish, they don't know that none of the well-known stories have not been able to be proven scientifically (for instance, there's never been any geological evidence that there's ever been a ""world flood"", re: Noah & the Ark. In fact, there's evidence that there has not been), books have been fabricated such as Deuteronomy, people were forced to believe or they were executed, they have no clue that many stories in the New Testament are the same stories that have been found in texts that are much older than the Bible, the resurrection has many discrepancies and the story gets more extravagant as time goes on in the Bible (it's mentioned 5 times and none of the stories are the same), we don't even know who wrote the New Testament scriptures (the lifespan of a Jewish man during that era was 40 years and the disciples would have been dead by the time the information was recorded) and many books of the Bible have been removed.

For a reviewer to state that any series that you see on the Discovery or History channels regarding religion are inaccurate, sensationalistic or condescending, target the Catholic religion specifically, and that the shows are out to destroy the faith of the gullible is simply just an opinion. It pretty much sounds to me like they're just a bit disturbed to hear that there's no scientific evidence that supports a lot of what the Christian Bible has told us.  Mostly what has been found to be true from the Bible are historical references and some geography (some, because the earth has changed over time).

Educated people who have studied religion (such as myself) on a scientific level believe science more-over stories that have been retold (and we all know how stories change every time they're retold) over the years, some which have been altered due to censorship, translation, flat out dishonesty and misinformed teachers.

I found the episode to be very informative and educational. Pretty much what I've been taught on an academic/scientific level. Great show that everyone who is interested in Jesus should watch so that they can get an educated, scientific viewpoint and form their own opinion of what is true and what isn't.",1344124800,4,2888,4.958677685950414
3991014,1,B002UJIY8O,"A good rule of thumb to apply to any show you see on the Discovery or History Channels that has the Christian (especially the Catholic) religion as it's topic is that it is going to be inaccurate, sensationalistic, and condescending. They especially like to show an increased number of these programs around Christmas and Easter, all the better to destroy the faith of the gullible and un-informed. Better to avoid them like the plague they are.

3991016,4,B002UJIY8O,"I am a student of religion, not a professional, just someone deeply interested in the subject.  So, even though having read a lot of the liberal (Ehrman, Fredriken, Sanders, Crossan) and some conservative books and viewed the videos, I felt that I be able to learn something from this video.  I surprised myself.  The film is very informative and not a bit boring.  There were a number of interesting tidbits of info and the other possible alternatives were presented in a not too shocking manner. The film was able to incorporate what the traditional Bible interpretation was and then show how this could have been a bit different than traditional according more recent studies. Not like going from a Chicago Symphony concert to an Earth Wind and Fire concert. For example, the discussion of the birth place of Jesus, in a stable or perhaps in a cave?  And what about the manger?  Was Jesus' bed really a feeding trof? I have read some off-the-wall theories about this man called Jesus, some real hard putdowns of the traditional Jesus story, but this film's treatment was family friendly. Well, did I learn something? Yes.  Did my mind swell up and expand in all directions with earth shattering information? No.  Was it nice and easy to watch? Yes. I would recommend this to Christians, especially the ones how would like to be presented with an alternative interpretation but not felt like they were thrown in the dust and rolled in tar for believing what they believe.",1337299200,50,1473,4.794466403162056

3991043,1,B002UJIY8O,"It is just pitiful that these people didn't use real archaeological finds from today.  So much has been discovered.  It is almost as though they made this to try and refute real finds.  For instance, a person who was actually crucified has been discovered so the stuff on here about driving ""roman nails"" into two heel bones is a waste of our time.  Let us see the real evidence.  Another thing is that the Temple of Solomon has been discovered in the City of David below the dome of the rock which was a Roman fortress and was built after Jesus' time.  A Herodian coin was found underneath the Western Wall where it could only have been dropped before the platform was finished.  Another thing is that when Paul was making trouble in the Temple the Roman soldiers came DOWN to deal with it.  The Temple was built on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.  That would have been below the platform because one doesn't thresh wheat on top of a mountain.  It would blow away.  Temple, a book by Bob Cornuke tells a great deal about recent discoveries.  Most likely Jesus was tried by Pilate at what is now the dome of the rock.  Figures!",1450569600,,1138,4.4396135265700485

3991064,4,B002UJIY8O,"Just like the other ones,""The Search for Jesus"" and ""From Jesus to Christ"", this one does a wonderful job at ""clearing things up"".  As I have said in my review of the others, the fundamentalist will hate it, the scholars will love it.  There is another one titled ""Jesus The Complete Story"".  It's not bad either, however, I feel that ""JTCS"" tries to tread carefully between what is historical fact and what the scriptures say.  ""Who Was Jesus?"" does that as well.  I think it tries to be careful not to offend, whereas ""The Search for Jesus"", and ""From Jesus to Christ"" just tells it like it is, unapologetic and straight forward.  ""The Search for Jesus"" and ""From Jesus to Christ"" has John Dominic Crossan and some of his contemporaries in them, and they lay it out.  They are not necessarily trying to be apologetic or sympathetic.  It is what it is.  Those guys are not involved in ""Who Was Jesus?"", so there is an element of ""softness"" to it.

There are few such pieces that can tell me more than I know.  The Scholarly commentary was not sarcastic or caustic. It presented the subject matter with clarity, historically and politically.  I grew to understand the family background of Jesus in a light I had never seen before.  This added to my understanding of the time period, the political causation of events that happened in his life and and gave me insights that were lacking in my own beliefs.  I would recommend this to anyone who seriously would like more information on the life of Christ.

3991107,2,B002UJIY8O,"I have studied on the subject of Jesus at some length and when this DVD misses that Jesus was pale blue eyed and reddish blonde hair, then all the genetics issues they tried to tell us become bogus nonsense.  The issues of Joseph being Tecton is likely correct, as a mason of sorts.  They tend to blow off any connections of Jesus and family with the Essene near the area of Bethlehem, and how these associations taught them healing methods of those times.  They totally miss the importance of Myrrh and Frankincense in health methods of the Essene and Egypt's Therapute.

Jesus was a pale skinned white person that stood out among the masses, and he had greater knowledge of health methods.  If one gets down the last supper, his teachings were again about healing and how wine and sprouted grain bread were essential to health.  So, the DVD appears to miss the mark on various important areas that were all about the legend of Jesus in those times.

The Gospels didn't get written until some 60 years past these times in Jerusalem, and even then, the Jesus them didn't take root until the times of Constantine and his mother, and the rise of the Eastern Roman Empire.  It could have been a good effort at documentary, but it appear very short of being a good treatise on Jesus, and in many areas it appears misleading.  imho",1382486400,2,1326,4.561181434599156

But it fails to give alot of information that does have evidence to support Jesus being Divine. This movie, though has alot of truth, fails to represent the truth as a whole. This movie represents a view point of Jesus being merely a man, and nothing more, and because that is the movies focus, it is being narrowminded, and closed off to any possibility to Jesus Christ being the Son of God. Their is also points in the movie where they base their information on educated guesses and present it as truth, and also make claims without any evidense basing it as truth, so either way, if you believe in Jesus as being the Son of God, or you believe in the makers of this dvd, it requires faith. I just thought it was cheap that they threw in some information giving it the representation as facts when indeed it was not.

It just proves that doctorate degrees only give you to opportunity to destroy the faith of others while lifting yourself up and making money in the process....
The ""intelligent"" girl and black Baptist in this film show absolutely no signs of Faith whatsoever...the story of Jesus is presented from a business and presumptive perspective. It is good to know the ""whys"" of the locations that are visited by the millions who have ""just wanted to walk where he walked"" and the new realizations from archeology, but lots of presumptive interpretations were done as though, in their own words, Jesus was strictly a follower of John the Baptist and did things for effect to make his point. Not one time did they even remotely give him the respect due the Son of God...or God incarnate.
Don't get me wrong...I'm not a fundamentalist because of all the contradictions in the scripture...you can literally justify lots of wrong ideas and acts while using it, but I have enough Faith by seeing God's hand in my own life, that I would at least be respectful of the great probability that it is true and it is about a Spiritual world vs the materialistic world we live in.
Jesus said it himself: ""My Kingdom is not of this world""...and neither is our salvation.
I suggest people who want the facts read any book they can find on apologetics...the factual information regarding our Creator and His world is overwhelming and getting larger as more and more atheistic scientists are turning to a strong belief in God.

3991143,5,B002UJIY8O,The history and science behind this was amazing.  It provided an portrait of who Jesus potentially could have been without the influences of western culture.,1365638400,,157,5.28
3991144,5,B002UJIY8O,"Information is given from all angles...religious as well as scientific.  Recreations of skulls and ancient buildings bring the information to life. All people from the time period are discussed, not just Jesus.  Much is said about the culture of the people during Jesus' time.  I learned a lot that I didn't know.",1364947200,12,313,4.980769230769231
3991145,5,B002UJIY8O,This series is amazing. It captures so many good perspectives on Christianity and the journey of Christ. I highly recommend this series to anyone and everyone who wants to learn about the journey of Christ,1364688000,4,205,4.885714285714286
3991146,5,B002UJIY8O,"Wow. Entertaining, informative, audacious! I was taken aback by the ""insiders"" audacity to explore Jesus' life and ministry from a sociopolitical lens (not new) in a way that was new to me.",1364601600,6,189,4.9375
3991157,5,B002UJIY8O,I love this dvd about who was jesus we all will be surprise when we get to see him peace,1364169600,,88,3.45
3991158,5,B002UJIY8O,Very informative video - answered some questions I had and explained some Biblical contradictions. You can't watch this and not believe...,1364083200,8,138,5.619047619047619
3991159,3,B002UJIY8O,"If you believe the Bible is God's Word, some facts are left out. But it is interesting as a historical and archeological look in the the culture of Jesus' time.",1362355200,,160,4.366666666666666
3991160,2,B002UJIY8O,"I was expecting an unbiased, data driven review of some of the historical and archeological discoveries relating to the life of Jesus. However, this was not that. There was a lot of anthropologic information about what life for someone of Jesus' social class may have been like. But this information was not specific to Christ, as I was hoping.

My biggest issue with the series, and the reason for the low rating was not only the paucity of archeological information, but also the completely unsubstantiated interpretations of the Bible. For example, if you are going to claim that the Bible is wrong and that the 12 disciples actually just ran away while Jesus was being arrested, you had better have some evidence to back that up. Unfortunately, no such evidence was given. Furthermore, they spent a lot of time painting Jesus as a social revolutionary focusing mainly on the, imagined, thoughts Jesus may have had about the divide between rich versus poor. Again, I have no problem with interpretation,  but I was expecting more data and less pontificating.

Conclusion: some interesting anthropolgic information on the time period with some weird, unsubstantiated Biblical interpretation.",1362182400,3,1193,5.170984455958549
3991161,4,B002UJIY8O,"I have seen a lot of videos about the life of Jesus.  This series is the best I have seen for helping the viewer understand how people lived during the time of Jesus.  The quality is excellent and the acting is believable. This one would be my first pick.

My second pick would be a DVD titled Close to Jesus. That is an excellent DVD for helping the viewer understand the relationship Jesus probably had between three of his closest followers and apostles, with a wonderful treatment of his relationship with Mary Magdalene.  And her place in the group of followers.

My third pick would be a DVD titled Visual Bible: Matthew.  That video seemed to focus more on scripture from the book of Matthew.  It is the story of Jesus as told by Matthew.  Recreation of sermon on the mount is very good.",1358208000,2,794,4.465277777777778
3991162,1,B002UJIY8O,"Easily the worst group of experts ever fielded together to analyze the history of Jesus; who he said he was and why he said he was. The three main experts (including one who claims to be a Baptist theologian) set out to rewrite the Bible's message as it was conveyed and try to dissasemble any notion of divinity or any notion of the supernaturalism of Jesus. The documentary employs analyst who cleverly twist scripture and the context of the Bible as it was written and explained by the contemporaries of Jesus. The Documentary sets out to offer a thesis that Jesus accidentally became ""famous"" and had a following and fell into his lot unwittingly and had no real intentions, control or divine prescription. At one point in the documentary they even employ a professional mystic to offer an opinion. That pretty much gives you the qualifications the producers required for ""experts"". If you've come to this DVD curious and searching for a description of Jesus and who he was, you will NOT find it here.",1357776000,11,1005,4.748571428571428
3991163,5,B002UJIY8O,"I liked this DVD very much. I'm glad I got it, I would recommend it to anyone who likes this sort of
thing.

I'm not going to answer anymore questions. Can't we go back to the old way or rating? We just click on your questions?
I'm not going to keep anwering this type of request for a rating.",1357171200,,293,3.9661016949152543
3991164,3,B002UJIY8O,"This production is literally a companion piece to BBC's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jesus-The-Complete-Story/dp/B0002J5018/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jesus - The Complete Story</a>. Featured are a Baptist pastor and and archeology specialist (accompanied by commentaries from other sources) who visit the Holy Land to investigate long standing Traditions of the Church. I do concede this production on the surface approaches the subject matter with a little more sensitivity than the BBC documentary. But a lot of the very questions they purport to solve are still invariably unanswered.
For instance, using a random skull from that region and time, they digitally assume the face of Christ Jesus from that alone and conveniently say (non verbatim) ""This is what Jesus *may* have looked like"". Well. That did not help. Both videos attempted the same project and it just did not prove anything.
Archeologically speaking, it is still nice to watch just to pick up a few morsels of scientific knowledge here and there. It did help flesh out what the Palestinian home land was like at that time.
But it still cannot reveal the real truths we as Christians are to uphold with faith, hope and charity. And no scientism ever truly should, I guess.
In my opinion, get this basically as entertainment, not as a resource to help hinge your faith on. And I underscore ""help"", because it can be used to further cement your own perspective on who Christ is, whether you are Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant or whatever you hold to believe.",1356998400,,1571,5.416326530612245

picture of Jesus is and the events in His life on earth.  I know of no other project that has produced this historical viewpoint in one complete reference.
