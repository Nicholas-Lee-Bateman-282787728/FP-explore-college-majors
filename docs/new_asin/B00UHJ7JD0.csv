7041484,4,B00UHJ7JD0,"I enjoyed the film, it reminded me of those gritty 70's movies that I love. In fact I would call it ""Death Wish meets ""The French Connection"" Worth a watch in my opinion.",1434326400,3,170,4.181818181818182
7041485,2,B00UHJ7JD0,"I don't know what movie the first two reviewers watched and rated so highly, but it sure as heck couldn't have been this one.

This had bad acting (the female lead was the worst), awkward and pointless flashbacks, and a very thin revenge plot. Also, because the female lead's hairline started halfway at the top of her head, it was totally distracting. Every time she appeared, my eyes jumped straight to her hairline and I missed whatever was going on in the scene!

Because the meth addict was the only one who did a half-way decent job of acting, I'm giving this 2 stars. Don't waste your money on this one.",1434067200,3,610,4.486486486486487
7041486,5,B00UHJ7JD0,"Strong female lead. Lots of action. A little humor. And, full of surprises. Wish Amazon carried the DVD. Some great characters...I loved the chemist.",1433980800,6,149,5.25

7041521,3,B00UHJ7JD0,"This could have been better, but it was pretty good. Good plot( why did they have to make her so weak when she fought that last person??( he was flinging her around like a rag doll!!!) Acting could have been better, only watched it once, won't see it again.",1437523200,,257,4.26530612244898
7041522,1,B00UHJ7JD0,"Low budget everything. Ignore the cover pic, it's marketing.",1436313600,,60,5.777777777777778
7041523,1,B00UHJ7JD0,"This move is pretty much lazy attempt to ride modern hype with pretty well no effort put into it. Just ti give you an idea of how lazy the this movie was made, the girl on the cover there is a picture of Summer Glau from what seems to be promotional pictures of the Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles with another girl's face Photoshop onto it.

That's right the production for this movie was so god damn lazy they couldn't even bother to put an actual picture of their own actress on it.

If the work on this movie was so lazy that they had to photoshop a face on stolen pictures for the cover of the movie, just imagine what the movie itself is going to be like.",1436054400,,669,4.178294573643411
7041524,2,B00UHJ7JD0,"Pearl (Dana Patton) is a female vigilante who hates drug dealers, men, and acting lessons. She is going after a guy named Trey and kills a bunch of people getting to him.

The film is low budget. While she kills a bunch of people, they only had money for one graphic scene. The sound track sucked and the sound was borderline. There are some cops after her who attempt to give us a reasonable subplot, but they weren't used enough. Eddie Murphy trivia abounds in an attempt at humor.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.  Girl on DVD cover is far better looking than anyone in the film.",1435449600,3,583,4.37962962962963
7041525,1,B00UHJ7JD0,"With average acting talent, the story line might garner 3*s.  But the acting is so forced -- almost as if each actor was trying to ""say"" their lines vs act them -- that the entire film makes you feel as if you were scratching a chalkboard.  For fun, if you choose to watch this film, keep track of each actor ... tally which acts with talent vs ""forcing"" lines.",1435363200,,361,4.217391304347826
7041526,2,B00UHJ7JD0,didn't really like the movie and the actions was very poor.,1435017600,,59,4.454545454545454
7041527,5,B00UHJ7JD0,"I gave it five stars for effort. I liked it which surprised me. I thought it was going to be like so many other Amazon stinkers but the Pattons did good for a movie that was written, produced, and acted by the same person. the action was good as was most of the acting. I would watch another movie made by the same people. It's not a big slick MGM or the studio with the lion roaring but it's worth a couple of bucks. give it a try, you might like it.",1434931200,,451,3.9130434782608696

8706887,2,B00UHJ7JD0,"Micro-budgeted thriller about a woman on a vigilante spree killing people involved with the local drug trade to avenge the death of her family.  The script is actually pretty good, with amusing dialogue and nicely drawn characters, but the bargain-basement production values and obviously low-rent cast make Pearl: The Assassin a chore to sit through.  With a slightly bigger budget and more polished actors this would be a solid B-movie, but the whole thing ends up feeling too cheap to take seriously.  Lead actress Dana Patton is symptomatic of exactly what's wrong with the movie--she isn't a horrible actress, exactly, but she has no reason to be the lead in a movie besides the fact that she and her husband(?) were the ones who made this film.  Dana Patton isn't attractive enough to be a lead and has zero screen presence--she looks like a Walmart cashier and brings little in the way of fire or emotion to her role.  There are definitely much worse movies out there than Pearl: The Assassin, but unless your tastes include micro-budgeted indies with semi-professional casts you probably want to avoid this one.",1444608000,,1119,4.930851063829787
8706888,1,B00UHJ7JD0,"A C or worse movie. Poor dialogue. It always seems that in low budget films the writing quality is based on one or two swear words. Poor acting.
The poster is better than the movie. Don't waste your money.",1444608000,,205,4.282051282051282
8706889,5,B00UHJ7JD0,"Excellent movie. Emotional, gripping, surprising and kick ass all in one. Enjoyed the hell out of it!",1442275200,,101,5.0
