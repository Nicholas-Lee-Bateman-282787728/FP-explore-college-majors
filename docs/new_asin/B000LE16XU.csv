2708731,5,B000LE16XU,"Jakers continues to be a favorite for my two and five year old grandkids (longer than most preschool fare), AND it is reasonably acceptable for adults even after way too many repetitions.",1231372800,,187,4.875
2708732,4,B000LE16XU,"The stories are fun and do impart some good lessons (and more importantly, easy to understand lessons) and the characters are wonderful. It illustrates the importance of good relationships (friends and/or family) and gives a good glimpse of the power of positive thinking and working together.
So why not five stars? I don't know if it's a Paramount thing or a PBS thing , but the seemingly endless litany of ads and promotional videos at the beginning could have been avoided. Even Disney videos let you bypass these and go right to the feature! not these...",1213488000,,559,4.833333333333333
2708733,5,B000LE16XU,I bought this DVD and numerous other Jakers DVDs for my grandson.  He just loves the adventures of Piggly Winks.  I would highly recommend this DVD and the other Jakers' DVDs.,1212969600,2,175,4.612903225806452
2708734,5,B000LE16XU,This was a very good movie for children.  It's not just entertaining but teaches valuable lessons to children.  It is about a grandfather pig telling stories of his childhood to his grandchildren. I definitely would recommend this movie.  It is suitable for all ages.,1206489600,2,267,5.0227272727272725
2708735,5,B000LE16XU,"We stumbled  upon Jakers! over a year ago when it was on PBS.  They've taken it off our station last I knew, so the DVDs are all we get to watch.  This particular DVD was purchased for my 20 month old daughter for St Patrick's Day.  She loves this show, as do her parents.  The nice thing about it is it can be enjoyed by the whole family.  It encourages kids to use their imagination, which almost seemed discouraged otherwise.  Plus it captures some key parts of Irish heritage, such as story telling, and Irish lore!  I eagerly await more DVDs coming out soon!",1206230400,,563,4.346153846153846

8161819,5,B000LE16XU,Life's lessons told in the most wonderful way. The kids love the stories and the animals are done so well. Mel Brooks is the best!,1378080000,,130,4.24
8161820,5,B000LE16XU,"Our whole family absolutely loves this show (ages 2 and up!)...cute, funny, and teaching valuable lessons. I am only sorry I did not know about it until now and missed out on the opportunity to get the whole collection with every episode. From what I can gather, they made 13 videos worth with 4 episodes on every DVD. We have collected four with another one I can see available, but the rest don't seem to ever be available in North American format or at reasonable prices :( I even went so far as to try to contact the production company (twice now) to try to find out more information or see if I can get copies of the rest, but they have not responded. Really wish PBS would bring this show back. If you happen to know where I can get any more videos in North American DVD format, please comment/contact me!",1367107200,2,811,4.342105263157895
8161821,5,B000LE16XU,The Jakers programs are cute on a great number of levels.  Kids and adults can enjoy them.  They're good clean fun!,1366588800,,115,4.428571428571429
8161822,5,B000LE16XU,My son loves this video!  He wants ALL the Jakers videos now!  I would recommmend this to anyone with children between the age of 3 and 10.,1360713600,,139,4.111111111111111
8161823,5,B000LE16XU,"I love these stories and are sorry to see that there haven't been any more produced.  I was introduced to these on the ""Sprout/PBS Kids"" network on DirecTV when my oldest (now 7) was not quite 2.  The stories are fun and are watchable by parents, also (not unlike some other kids' shows).  To hear Mel Brooks as the voice of the sheep will definitely throw you the first time, but a great series!",1356566400,,396,4.324324324324325
8161824,5,B000LE16XU,"I love the fact that these are cute, funny, well-made cartoons that teach values and morals.  These kids are obedient, respect their parents and those in authority over them, but are completely capable of getting into mischief also.  When they do make a mistake, they learn to take responsibility for it.  I love their attitudes, their creativity, sense of adventure, and care for others.  These cartoons start off with Grandpa Piggly talking with his grandchildren.  He tells stories to them about his childhood on a farm in Ireland.  These stories always tie into some problem or complaint that his grandchildren are having and teach them valuable lessons.  I highly recommend these cartoons!",1294617600,,694,5.142857142857143
8161825,5,B000LE16XU,awesome show. it's so cute and my kids love it. always a has a great moral in each episode and we're Irish and LOVE the seting and brogues!!!,1275696000,,141,4.071428571428571
8161826,5,B000LE16XU,"We loooooooooooooove this show, and so does our daughter. Unfortunately, it no longer airs on our local PBS affilate, so we're grateful for the few DVDs that are available. Wish we could find every episode on DVD so our baby can enjoy them later.",1273190400,,246,4.613636363636363
