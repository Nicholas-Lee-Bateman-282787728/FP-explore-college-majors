8195450,1,B000QCDPJK,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen (and I've seem my share of bad movies!)!!  I'm a person who will usually watch though to the end even if it's bad, but this one I just couldn't get though.  I'm okay with bad acting, but the script had major issues and holes.  My time would have been better spent running head-first into a wall.",1436400000,,345,4.119402985074627
8195451,4,B000QCDPJK,"I started dating Rondi ( the girl in the movie ) a few weeks ago. She mentioned it and me being me I had to have it. Not showing any bias at all I think for what the movie is about and how it was done, the movie is actually pretty good. Im not a big horror guy but I did enjoy this one and got a big kick out of it. She's a real sweet heart in person too : )",1390953600,,358,3.3780487804878048
8195452,5,B000QCDPJK,"My daughter Maria Sylva is on the backcover in the white robe,
and in 8x scenes even though 7 were as a corpse.
Her family is very proud of this start for her.
Some points of the movie were alittle too dark,
and pausing at parts. Otherwise WE love you Maria,
Go girl! At least the movie kept you in suspense!!

8195453,4,B000QCDPJK,"This movie kept me interested and in suspense minute to minute, for a low budget horror film it was pretty good.  Especially when it is something that could really happen in real life.....",1180310400,3,188,4.696969696969697
