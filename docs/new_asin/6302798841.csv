7831749,1,6302798841,"Completely forgettable Canadian action comedy starring Richard Harris as a down on his luck accountant who gets caught up in a convoluted plot--in a nutshell the CIA was paying the mob to assassinate someone but the assassination became unnecessary so the CIA wanted its money back.  But the man who was supposed to launder the money (Christopher Plummer) decided to keep it all for himself.  The mob and the CIA both think Richard Harris knows where Plummer is or at least can find him.

Highpoint is one of those Canadian subsidies films that were made between the mid 1970's and 1980's.  During that period Canada provided generous subsidies for movies to encourage local production.  Canadian subsidy films gave actors Hollywood no longer had any use for like Donald Sutherland, Elliot Gould, Christopher Plummer, Richard Harris and James Coburn work but the movies were rarely good unless they were made by David Cronenberg.  There was no attempt to link quality to the subsidies so the films quickly developed a reputation for being awful with terrible scripts, slumming stars, low-rent production values and virtually nothing to recommend them.

I did feel a certain amount of nostalgia while watching Highpoint because they don't make movies like this anymore--it reminded me of my childhood and going to see those crappy Canadian movies knowing in advance that the odds that they would actually be good was low--but it's easy to be optimistic when you're a kid.  Highpoint is a prime example of that unlamented and forgotten sub-genre--the script barely functions as storytelling, the comedy isn't funny, the action scenes aren't exciting and Richard Harris and Christopher Plummer make no effort to disguise their disdain for the material--they made this for the money but there apparently wasn't enough money for them to pretend otherwise.  The only bright spot is Canadian character actors Saul Rubinek and Maury Chaykin incompetent mafia goombas on the trail of the slumming stars.  Everything else about Highpoint says 'who cares'? with so much disdain it's almost breathtaking--but Canada actually used to churn out movies like this and worse on a depressingly regular basis.  Highpoint definitely doesn't live up to its title but fans of bad movies might find something to enjoy.",1431129600,,2295,5.1924119241192415

The CN Tower.

Now it has been awhile since I watched the movie but the plot was a mystery chase around the world,but what I really wanted to see is the scene wherer the bad guy falls off the CN Tower. I did not skip to the end.

Give the movie a B. But as a Multimedia student & so to be film maker,I was intriged that they would let a human being jump off the CN Tower. It's
1800 feet {133 stories}off the ground. Great work for Dar Robinson,the stuntman.

I saw him in the Astrodome 6 years {1974} earlier jump from the top/middle of the dome,which is about 25 stories tall. Cool for a 13 year old then. But 22 years later,be near the spot where Dar jumped off the tower. Whew !!!

Thats like the distance if ya jumped off the Empire State Building. 102 stories.  Been to Toronto 7 times,twice to the tower.  Still looking for a DVD of Highpoint",1240963200,,1067,4.125603864734299
7831751,4,6302798841,"This film brings together the talents of Christopher Plummer and Richard Harris, two of the best. As ever, the Canadian film industry makes a pretty good fist of making a good film. They very wisely call upon Canada's own in Christopher Plummer to star, always a good move. He can lift even the mundane to a new level, not that this film is in any way ""mundane""",1211241600,,361,4.402985074626866
