2359386,5,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars is definitly on its way to be one of the best shows ever. Veronica Mars is witty, spunky, and everything a teenage detective should be. As soon as this show starts I am glued to the T.V. This show has sex, mystery, and murder. Making it an excellent show. People need to spread the word about Vernonica Mars. Now that the second season will come I'm eager for the first season to come in DVD. So I can see it all over it again a million times. Veronica Mars is the best show and I enocurage you to watch it ! It is on UPN tuesdays at 9:00 pm time.",1113696000,7,561,4.017857142857143

Bell does a fine job and the cases are better written than most detective shows you see on TV.  The Mars character is often wickedly funny and sarcastic.

So I was veer sad that at 2:00 am I go to my prime to queue up some Veronica and it's gone. The only way to watch is to buy via Amazon or iTunes. It's not on Hulu, Crackle, or Netflix.",1485907200,4,357,3.904109589041096
2359533,5,B000A59PMO,"I enjoyed this show!  It's well written. The directing, production design, and actors bring depth to what is, really, a teenage soap opera. Unfortunately, I've noticed a pattern with Amazon Prime Video.  I will begin watching a series that is included with Prime, and when I am about half-way through the show Amazon will remove it from Prime.  I'm curious to find out what happens through the rest of the series.  But I'm not going to pay to watch it.",1485820800,14,452,4.6125
2359534,5,B000A59PMO,"So glad I decided to watch this classic show. I enjoyed Kristen Bell on House of Lies, so when I saw the Veronica Mars movie I decided to watch it. Well, I loved it. I don't want this to sound sexist or backward sounding but at first glance- me, a straight 30-year-old male- loving this show, seems out of place. Well, prepare to be surprised at how appealing this show can be to ANYONE.  For those of you who like mystery-comedy genre types, this is right up your alley. (Think teenage-but serious still- Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). With the show being in a high school setting it's surprising how serious the issues they tackle are. The best issues/performances though are easily those of Bell. They tackle topics such as: serious things like teenage pregnancy, teacher-student relationships, drugs, date-rape all the way to mild things, like your typical high-school love triangle; all in a believable and fresh manner. Seeing how Bell handles (or tries) everything that's thrown at her is a testament to her acting and the equally impressive writing of her character. She is so on point with Veronica. I don't remember the last time I saw an actress play such a believable, strong female lead. The only writing in the show that I found to be poor was that of the sheriff. He was so unbelievably dense, and a bit out of place compared to the rest of the characters. They did try to give him some depth in a season 2 episode but there was no follow-up. From that episode, I was certain it wasn't the actor that was poor, just the writing of him. For that to be the only truly bad writing example I can think of though, it's nothing in the grand scheme of things. However, I didn't watch the show until a year or two later! I burned through the whole series in a (sick) week. The first two seasons are fantastic. Season three is good but not even close to the first two. Also, the final episode was such a letdown. I had no idea it was the final because all the other seasons had 22 episodes. When the 3rd season ended on 20 I thought Amazon maybe was pulling something and wanted people to pay for the final 2 haha. I wish that were the case. I was so let down that THAT was it. The movie puts a nice little bow on things, though. Having said all that, the characters are so loveable and memorable and with the movie kind of tying everything up, I was extremely greatful to have found the show. Watch the first 5-6 episodes. YOU WILL BE HOOKED.",1485820800,2,2440,4.41019955654102
2359535,5,B000A59PMO,Love the show but was disappointed in Amazon taking the show off of prime.,1485820800,,74,4.357142857142857

2359562,5,B000A59PMO,"Totally enjoyable from the start.  I love the relationship she had with her dad and her best friend.  The snarky voice overs were endlessly amusing.

Kind of fun, light hearted, and still clever. However, what started as a Prime viewing (free for members) overnight it changes to rental with no warning. Sadly, it is the lack of consideration for customers that causes this kind of problem and very little a representative can do. It is frustrating when watching a TV series and suddenly it changes like this. It is hard to believe that Amazon does not plan this type of change in advance.

I'm one of the people that pay for Prime primarily for Instant Video, and jump back and forth between it and Netflix. If Amazon starts pulling crap like this I'll be reconsidering Amazon come renewal time. Winning a few awards doesn't mean Originals are going to sell your customer base, Amazon.

There is the story told in the episode and the story of the season is also being told at the same time. Additionally you learn more about the main character and see them develop through the high's and low's of their life.

I had ordered the second season also, but did not open because i could hear the rattling and knew that those were more than likely just a scratched up and damaged as the first season. If you find another way to buy/watch I highly recommend........just not from this one.",1481932800,,415,4.546666666666667
2359967,3,B000A59PMO,"Kristen Bell's acting steadily improves at about the same rate as the story lines decline.  By Season Three, through a blend of facial expressions, body language, and vocal delivery, she has brought to life in 'Veronica Mars' a unique and formidable character.  'Mac' is also an engaging, and more importantly stable, character.  In my opinion, all the other principal characters are vividly colored in most cases but somewhat two dimensional.  Season Three begins to turn justice-seeking Veronica into revenge-seeking Veronica.  When Veronica's notion of punishment starts to wildly exceed the nature of the crime, she becomes less likable and less attractive to have around.",1481932800,,676,5.461538461538462

As it turns out, Veronica Mars definitely exceeds my expectations. It is fun and suspenseful and clever in a way that is not too cute. It approaches the subject of high school with respect and sensitivity in a manner that does not come off as an afterschool special and also manages not to insult the intelligence of the audience. It is also fun to see early appearances by young actors who have grown into successful careers.",1481846400,,586,4.336363636363636

2360383,5,B000A59PMO,"I expected it would be a standard teen drama, and it seems pretty formulaic the first few episodes. The writing is great, however, and multiple storylines get woven together seamlessly and cleverly. I am especially impressed with Enrico Colantoni and with the development of his character. Most teen-centric series end up with parental figures that are barely placeholders in the plot line, but here's a well-developed and well acted father figure. Jason Dohring is also a pleasant surprise as the series wears on, with his portrayal of Logan Echolls being one of the deeper, multi-faceted characterizations. The writing is witty and often so clever that great jokes fly under the radar in the pace of the conversation.
My favorite aspect of the writing, however, is that the wrap up of cases is rarely what the viewer expects, so it keeps you watching as much for mystery as for the relationships onscreen. A great first season.",1474934400,,929,5.0

Veronica is mature for her age (high school) and her detective Dad knows it. He encourages her independence by valuing her opinion though he sometimes wishes she'd just enjoy being a kid.

It helps the character to be young with a good imagination. Very cleverly written. She is a loyal friend and sincere person dabbling close to lifting the lid on Pandora's Box. There is an essence of naive youth to Veronica's character, but she also has the drive and courage of a lion. I like that there is no swearing or severe violence in this series. It's fun to watch.",1472860800,,498,4.252631578947368
2360530,4,B000A59PMO,"I like this sassy, clever youngster! Although I am much, much older than the characters in this now decade-old series, I still enjoy watching the young navigate their worlds. I've only watched six episodes, but I have for the most part enjoyed them. Of course, I don't always agree with Veronica's decisions, and some of the events (""spoiler alert!"") seem to be a bit too good to be true, like the sudden appearance of handsome, glib Troy or Veronica's dismantling of the two college boys' ""Nigerian scam."" However, in the interest of just relaxing a bit, I can suspend belief and just go with it. The investigation by Veronica and her dad, separately, and soon, I suspect, together, of the death of Veronica's best friend Lilly is a nice, ongoing teaser, and I've already developed my choice of who the real killer is, so I'm curious to see if I'm correct. Overall, despite a few weaknesses (a couple of the characters seem mis-cast and a few situations sketchy), I am enjoying this sort of coming-of-age story and the ever-present class war between the haves and have-nots and how quickly one can go from having it all and being part of the clique to being an outcast, as Veronica finds out. This is a ""sorta Valley Girl-ish,"" (teen noir?) spin on the precariousness of one's position within ""power"" structures in high school; for example, there are high school ""Pirate Points"" for the privileged cliques, which are threatened in one episode by a high school election that might put one of the have-nots in the student council president position (I won't reveal anymore!). Kristen Bell's performance is strong and authentic, and she plays well the typical angst-ridden teen, tempering it with her savvy, courage, and compassion for others. The other characters mostly play their parts well, especially the snobbish Logan Echolls (played by Jason Dohring). If you like watching portrayals of teens, their struggles, and the machinations they undertake and experience, you can't go wrong with Veronica Mars. It lasted for only three seasons, so it might make for a good weekend or two of binge-watching.",1472860800,2,2103,4.943502824858757

2360559,4,B000A59PMO,"A severely underrated show.  A friend described it as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, with mysteries instead of demons. Both shows have a strong female lead character, intelligent plots and sharp dialog. They both include season-long story arcs, but VM's season one arc is more intricate, more compelling, and has far more twists than any of the BtVS arcs. It takes 3-4 episodes to get going, but after that, it's totally binge-worthy.  Acting ranges from good to excellent, with Kristen Bell, Jason Dohring, and Enrico Colantoni doing most of the heavy lifting.  12 years after its premiere, it's also great to watch for guest stars, young(er) and old(er).  This is the best of the three seasons, although season 2 is no slouch either.  Well worth your time.",1472774400,,753,4.944444444444445

Cross a slightly more sophisticated ""My So Called Life"" with the movie ""Brick"" and add Kristen Bell who is a fine actress and too cute not to fall in love with.  There you go.  Veronica Mars.

2360813,5,B000A59PMO,"A friend told me that it was a fun show...so I gave it a shot.  It just happened that my 13-yo daughter joined me for the first episode.  It has now turned into a regular show for us, and I'm regularly asked when I get home from work, ""Can we watch an episode tonight?""  It's been a great show for us as Dad/Daughter for many reasons.  Veronica's Dad is a normal guy, hard-working and absolutely loves his daughter, and tries to do the right thing.  It's rare to see such a good role model on TV for a dad.  Veronica herself is flawed but sharp as a tack and does the right thing, yet another good role model for my daughter to watch.  Despite there being some awkward topics (purity test, sex, abuse, rape), the show as become a great platform for my daughter and I to talk about these issues in a safe way.  The story is complex and well thought out.  It reminds me a little of the ""whodunit"" complexity in Twin Peaks, but without the bizarreness and with more common modern social problems.  I look forward to future episodes.",1468454400,,1029,4.3125

2361000,5,B000A59PMO,"Snarky, seemingly genuine, cute, and doesn't let anyone get in her way... What's not to like about Veronica Mars?  Ok, not every episode in Season 1 holds my interest but I love the whole series and recent movie too much to nitpick.",1464825600,,232,4.523809523809524
2361001,4,B000A59PMO,"At first, I watched Veronica Mars in reruns on the Soapnet channel and I found it entertaining to some degree. By watching the first season and pilot episode, you get to understand what makes the series appealing to the audience. The series stars Kristin Bell in the title role. She does a superb job in carrying the series but she has an excellent supporting cast especially Enrico Colantoni (Just Shoot Me and Person of Interest) who played Keith Mars, her father and private investigator. Corinne Bohrer is excellent as Veronica's estranged mother.

Veronica Mars was once in the in-crowd but is now on the outs with most of the school. Her best friend Lily Kane was murdered mysteriously. Lily is played by Amanda Seyfried in flashback scenes. Kyle Secor plays Jake Kane (Homicide: Life on the Streets), the bereaved, guilt-ridden father. Ironically one of his ""Homicide: Life on the Streets"" co-star Melissa Leo (Academy Award winner for ""The Fighter) has a memorable guest appearance in ""Meet John Smith"" episode. For a small part, she truly delivers. Too bad, Leo and Secor never had a scene together.

Other guest performers include Jane Lynch before ""Glee;"" real life couple, Harry Hamlin and Lisa Rinna as a movie star and socialite wife; and more. Harry Hamlin gives a surprising tough performance as a movie star with secrets. Everybody has secrets, Veronica Mars wants to solve her best friend's murder even if uncovering unpleasant truth about herself.

The six DVDs feature the entire first season and twenty extra minutes of deleted scenes for each episode. If anything, I would have liked to know about the behind the scenes and the conception of the series especially an interview with Rob Thomas.",1464739200,,1715,4.989510489510489

It's kind of a combination of Nancy Drew + 90210, and seems like it's set in the same town as Grease.  I love how the show isn't afraid to look back at previous decisions Veronica has made and question whether they were good decisions or not.  I love how the show presents difficult topics (pregnancy, drugs, crime) and their consequences in an even handed way with no ""after school special"" moralizing.",1463961600,,559,4.56

2361647,5,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars is a fantastic show - the greatest since Twin Peaks. I feel very sorry for those who can't appreciate its incredible acting, suave and wry humor, amazingly detailed storytelling and hyper-complex characters. The massive amounts of angst and intensity among these high schoolers is the only unrealistic (or rather, surrealistic) aspect of the show, and it is forgiven because this is an superbly crafted exercise in stylized fiction and symbolism.

The names, for one thing - Neptune, Tritons, Mars -, are not only planetary, but mythological. Neptune is a cold, distant place, but reluctant gods of war inhabit it. Keith and Veronica Mars do not instigate war, but when others declare it on them, they prove supremely good at it.

The show represents one of those very rare couplings of a great concept, great writing and great directing with a remarkable actress who totally ""gets"" the whole complex atmosphere of it, and can act the part perfectly. Kristen Bell is an incredible actress (I, for instance, became aware of this show solely because I took an interest in Bell after seeing her tiny but impressively acted part in the movie Spartan); she has every conceivable facial expression completely nailed, and on top of that she is also fabulously gorgeous - all the more so because of her obvious intelligence.

Veronica Mars is, as far as I'm concerned, one of the two best American TV-shows I've ever seen, and my rating of it would be 9 or 10.

This show WILL go down in history as a timeless TV classic.

2361914,4,B000A59PMO,"""We used to be friends"" when this show was first on. Veronica Mars as played by Kristen Bell is so tough on the outside and vulnerable on the inside that you wanted to give her a hug but weren't sure she'd like it. (Except from her Daddy, of course.) Enrico Colantoni is great as her Dad, BTW. This is an unusual coming-of-age story, a non-supernatural ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" (or so ""Buffy"" creator Joss Whedon must have thought because he became a ""Veronica"" fan). The humor is sometimes too thin, but welcome whenever it appears. The soap opera that is Neptune, California, the mythical town where the story is set, is not to be taken too seriously. Veronica gets to solve mysteries very cleverly, not always as many steps ahead of her crime-solving Dad as she thinks. The Big Bad/Red John is the murder of her best friend, which hangs over the whole series until Veronica and her Dad finally solve it. By then the viewer will be hooked on the characters. Maybe hooked enough to want to see their story continue in a movie or novelizations. (Both of which have been done with mixed results.)",1453593600,2,1097,4.6020408163265305

The relationship between Veronica and her dad is real and not what tv tends to churn out that the parent is stupid and kid is smart. I wished I had watched this show when it was originally on. Instead, I started with the movie, got very interested in it and wanted to see the series. The relationships are true and tangled. They did a great job developing the whole cast and not just writing Veronica as the only star of the show. The supporting cast is great. There are lessons to be learned too. Great job Rob Thomas. I wish you'd bring back the series since the movie did the perfect setup for it. I am going to be upset when I make to the end of season 3. I am hooked!! I'd love to either see a sequel to the movie or a series. I prefer a series. PLEASE BRING VERONICA AND HER CAST BACK!!! I miss them!! This review written by Reg Dunlop's wife.

I had heard about it, the quality of the show, the fans demanding it come back after being cancelled...it all got me thinking about ""what to watch next"" on Amazon Prime since my wife and I had finished a few series from start to end. The best thing about this show is how smart the lead character is about playing the various angles to find out what she wants and/or give some characters some well deserved payback.

Several friends had suggested it and I know i'd seen the pilot episode before, but make sure to watch it into the second episode.  I felt the Pilot was so full of the Set Up for the show that it didn't really get into it's groove until an episode or 2 later.  As the episodes go on it starts to pull at threads of the primary mystery which leaves a dark cloud over the town, well more like that cloud that follows Veronica around all the while several other incidents happen developing the supporting characters making them all very interesting people to invest your time watching.",1446681600,,682,4.483870967741935

Some of the episodes you can get an idea of what is going to happen but they have twists that make you go...darn you got me and I want to see what happens next. The theme song is super catchy too! I find myself humming it sometimes at work. If you are like me and ran out of things to watch and want to watch something like a younger CW Mysteries series, this is for you. I hope this helps!

2362300,5,B000A59PMO,I have watched this season through once and LOVED IT!  I would say it ranks towards the top with the way it has a plot that drives through the whole season as a mystery and then many subplots per episode.

2362378,5,B000A59PMO,Veronica Mars combines the essential elements of a story that I love! A strong young female lead who is capable of solving crimes and making good grades in school.  There is the murder of her best friend that leads to the introduction of so many great suspects while she works as a teen detective for hire.  This is one of those shows I watch repeatedly and actually find it fresh each time.  Great cast and writing!,1445558400,,416,4.447368421052632

Then to make matters worse something terrible happens to her at a party & no one believes her or wants to help her. Any other 16 year old would had called it a day, not Veronica. She becomes this very strong girl that will get revenge for what happen to her. She will figure out who killed her best friend and get her dad's reputation back.

Kristen Bell is quirky, charming, and smart. The characters are lovable, the mysteries fascinating, the plot is surprising, and the show tackles relevant, modern themes that we actually deal with. It's not just a show about the popular kids being popular--it's about class warfare, racism, or as the show calls it ""the Haves vs. the Have Nots."" A seriously underrated show and one of the best television has to offer. WATCH IT, if for no other reason that Logan Ecchols, my most beloved badboy of all time.",1444176000,3,761,4.7218045112781954

2362913,4,B000A59PMO,"This program is better than I thought it would be.  Kristen Bell is excellent in the lead and is complimented by the supporting cast.  The writing is good for what is basically a crime drama.

Set in a So Cal high school, there is a good bit of social angst between the uber wealthy students and their classmates of ordinary means with the well to do frequently asserting their privilege.  The divide is probably too exaggerated to be reflective of reality but certainly provides a playing field for continuing dramatic tension.  It is easy to root for the heroine as she repeatedly gets the best of everybody.

Despite the cheesy description found on IMDB, this has been a remarkably engaging and intriguing show (bearing in mind, I've only seen the first of three seasons). Thanks to completely realistic plot twists, I found myself totally unable to predict the outcome of most episodes. It's very well-written and seriously acted with lots of smart dialogue and believable authentic characters.

2363034,5,B000A59PMO,"This show has it all; a young crime solving girl learning to rely on her friends and family while teaching everyone who doubts her just how smart and sleuthy a teenaged girl can be. The writing is so wonderful that you hardly remember these are actors.

The theme of rape and sexual violence is prevalent through the entire show (not just the first season) so if these themes are at all disturbing or triggering, brace yourself or don't watch.
Even though some of the themes in the show were disturbing to me, I felt like I could still watch it.

I would sincerely recommend this show to anyone who has been through some really bad times and wants to relate to characters who have been through the same. That being said, it's not all horror. Most of the show is about high school, relationships, friends, and family.",1440633600,,816,4.54421768707483

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for watching a pretty blonde gal solve crimes, kick ass, and catch criminals. But it's the sharply written dialogue and the endearing characters that keep me binge-watching day after day. If you like your TV shows on the ""charming and witty"" side, chock full of memorable characters and teen angst galore (and who doesn't?), you should give VERONICA MARS a try.",1440201600,,469,4.7317073170731705

It's unfortunate that Amazon Instant Video doesn't provide consistently good video quality. Part of an episode may be good, but then go blurry with bit rate down the drain.
Since Amazon's digital capacity is so obviously vast, some of us are curious as to why that doesn't carry over to the quality of our video experience.
Amazon is a remarkable service provider in many ways and at such a level that it seems odd that it should fall short in video.
Some of us are trying to figure that out.",1435536000,,647,4.734513274336283

2363879,5,B000A59PMO,"Rob Thomas you are a genius!  I came late to this series and was prepared to hate it due to teen subject matter.  However, the writing is kitchy, smart and self-reflexive....listen closely to dialogue for references from everything from old movies (film noire to screwball comedy), to wacky pop culture.  Yes, some teen characters are annoying and several seasons into the series there are some repeated themes that get played out, but over all I am a convert to all things headed by Mr. Thomas....you make TV dialogue worth the listen.  And you may just get sucked in to a fun female teen lead character, by the end of the season I was a hooked ""marshmallow.""",1433462400,2,660,4.663793103448276

2364397,5,B000A59PMO,"Good story w/ the wit that was in the Movie.  For anyone who saw the movie, as I did, but had not seen the TV show it gives you a background on the movie that helps to understand the characters better.  It was interesting how many of the Movie actors were also in the series.  I am half way thru Season 2 and I still enjoy  it.  V does some really dumb things in Season 2 that make her more believable as teenager, not a super sleuth.
My only problem w/ the  series is the visual quality of the actual show, the color is off and the picture is grainy.  In distance shots you have to look real hard to tell one S. Cal blonde from the other.  I am sure that  is because it was originally a TV show with very low resolution. It is interesting to see the actual show time.  As w/ most TV show they are 40 to 43 minutes long.  Thank god on Amazon!!
I don't have to watch  17  to 20 minutes of COMMERCIALS.  It is worth  waiting for shows on Amazon and others to avoid them.",1430006400,,968,3.94300518134715

2364611,5,B000A59PMO,I've been watching Veronica Mars for years. So of course I wanted to start from the beginning and watch the entire series. Even though I watched it for years I found the beginning a little bit hard to keep track of who was who. I think it's just because the show is so fast-paced and there's a lot of people that they introduce in the beginning. I love this show!,1428192000,,363,4.2

2364666,5,B000A59PMO,"Everyone already knows this is one of the best tv series ever made.  Interesting concept, good writing, acting, directing, pokes fun at school, film noir, acting, and much else, all the while telling interesting stories with surprising plot twists and multiple subplots.  Features sex and violence without being graphic about them.  'High school' students are all in their mid twenties, which the writers explain by ignoring.  The cost is suspension of disbelief; the valuable payoff is increased focus in behavior and more interesting story lines.  The poor subhuman television executives who cancelled this masterpiece probably thought it cost too much.  Fortunately, there are a lot of episodes, and it never got to jump the shark.",1428019200,,734,5.339130434782609

There's a bit too much soap-operay drama for my taste, and there's a lot of plot points that come and go quickly (for example, one character takes meds for a psychological condition that beefs up the mystery for a few episodes and serves as a red herring of sorts, but then that disappears completely when it's no longer of use!) And that's weak writing, imo, but not a bad show.  Kristen Bell is perfectly cast.",1426636800,,450,4.54320987654321

2365272,4,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars is an excellent TV show with great mystery, action, and comedy. The biggest flaw is the dvd case. All 6 discs are stacked on top of each other rather than in different sections of the case (a good example is Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Season 3 from shout factory) or in tiny dvd cases per dvd or 2 in a set (a good example is Firefly: The Complete Series), so if you want to watch an episode from later in the season, you have to take discs on top of them off first. I don't own any shows or movies that I download. This show, I'd consider (especially if the discs start to become unreadable and I've already started to have a few skipping on my discs), that or buy a different dvd case to put my discs on. A good thing I can say is that it was decently priced on Amazon (around $13).",1424736000,,800,4.101910828025478

2365488,5,B000A59PMO,This has been one of my favorite series since I started watching it in grad school with a couple of friends a few years after it was on tv. It may not be for everyone and it's certainly not high brow or quality entertainment but it's cute and fun and funny and always leaves me feeling young and hopeful like all happy ending type stuff does. And my group of lit and art theory grad students considered it our weekly guilty pleasure. If you like this sort of thing then give it a try!,1423180800,,484,4.159574468085107

I'm a Marshmallow.  The show is superbly written with a great balance of good characterization, comedy, and drama.  There are a few over and underplayed roles, but it's season one.  Most of the acting is good and most of the main characters seem to have good chemistry, especially as the show progresses.  It's a little predictable at times, but I feel it has a more than decent multi-plot story.  If you like murder mysteries, light humor, and can sit through the California High-school backdrop, you'll like the show.",1420502400,,690,4.7478991596638656

There is a story that continues in the background and actually gets completely resolved by the end of the season.

2365652,5,B000A59PMO,"This series is wonderful.  Maybe it is just my longing for the simpler days of being a teenager.  Of course, Veronica deals with issues that are far beyond anything I dealt with when I was in High School.  She handles them all with a maturity that most High School students could only dream about. Not hokey as might be expected from a series that caters to the young crowd. Veronica Mars is the best.  I cannot wait until I get an opportunity to view the rest of the seasons.

Most of the actors and actresses are quite good.  Dialog is fast paced and quippy, which is good and of course not real life (most people don't have the intellectual bandwidth to keep up this kind of dialog non-stop....reminds me of the same characteristic of West Wing dialog).

Never watched it 9 years ago - but it is fun now.  Look at those cell phones!

2365868,5,B000A59PMO,"I'm fully addicted, and it started with the recently released Veronica Mars movie on cable. That was my introduction to this show. The main character has a lot of integrity and heart, but is also a cool, brave rebel. Nice soundtrack, funny, charming, and of course the mysteries pull you in. Kristen Bell is wonderful! Positive messages while acknowledging that things can be really messy and complicated in life.",1416441600,,413,5.0

2365887,5,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars doesn't get caught up into the regular school girl routine. There are times that she might like to but she is not that type of person. What she does get caught up into is other peoples lives and helps them out. This season shows you how people get tangled up into unwanted situations and how they respond to them. Sometimes they do the right thing or the wrong thing or just don't know what to do. Then there is Veronica Mars who is smart and street savvy. She helps others in need even when she at first glance you would question that choice. She brings out the goodness in ourselves and our humanity. Plus, it is interesting and enjoyable to see how she gets into and out of trouble. The writers and actors of this series really hit home on people interactions and their dealings with each another.",1416268800,,814,4.433333333333334

2365894,3,B000A59PMO,"It started off well and we are up to about the tenth episode and find that it is getting more and more contrived with predictable outcomes as we go along and the writers  begin to look in the bottom of the idea barrel. It's kind of like an inverted form of Nancy Drew mysteries where Nancy isn't wealthy but everyone else is and they are all by their very nature not nice people.  As in the Nancy Drew books, Veronica is still smarter than everyone else though. We will keep watching but I fall asleep more easily now during episodes. It's better than a lot of TV.",1416182400,,564,4.261682242990654

The teens are definitely more sexually active than any reasonable reality ...be aware of that.  They do ... however show that there are consequences for this type of behavior ... but probably not enough.",1415577600,,484,4.771084337349397

2366019,5,B000A59PMO,"I recently started watching this series and I have to say it was better than I expected.  The main character is the daughter of a PI who was the former Sheriff.  Veronica Mars helps her dad with some of his PI duties and does a little sleuthing on the side for her high school classmates.  Her character is witty, tenacious and smart.  Her high school classmates are made up of the very wealthy and the not-so-wealthy, so there is some rivalry between the classes.  Season one follows the murder investigation of Veronica Mars' best friend, Lilly, while still introducing other main characters of the story and solving various problems in each episode.  Some of the problems relate to the central murder investigation and sometimes not.  I enjoyed the show very much and was pleased to see that several of the main characters were allowed to evolve and develop throughout the season.  The episodes are varied enough to not get boring while still pushing along the central plot.  I look forward to seeing where her character goes in the future.",1415059200,,1043,4.782122905027933

One of the great things about having a kindle coupled with Amazon Prime is that I can go back and watch series that I missed because I was busy with other people and things in my life.  I wasn't sure I would like this series but I got sucked in during the first episode.  I just had to find out who killed Lily among other things.  One of the best parts of the series is the relationship between Veronica and her father.  I do get a little tired of the ""haves and have nots"" card being played all the time but this is TV and conflict makes things interesting.  I think Veronica is smart, resourceful, and like that she is not perfect.  She makes mistakes but always solves the case.  The series is about teenagers and has some drinking, sex, violence, murder, partying and just plain snottiness. I wouldn't let younger children watch it.",1411344000,,974,4.337016574585635

I find that Veronica found a way to endure the social pressure of high school by becoming an amazing detective. The stigma of her father's dismissal as Sheriff and their financial deficit compared to the other wealthy students with their famous or infamous parents influenced her coping with the slights, and smirks of her fellow classmates by ignoring them and doing her own thing. Soon she becomes the "" go to "" girl when someone has a problem that they can't solve and don't want to go to the authorities.

But even better than a modern day Nancy Drew story. The series (Veronica) has a fresh story each week and case to solve but still keeps a few season long un-solved cases going back and forth.

Many sub plots don't get fully developed. This is a common mechanism for the private investigator genre (keep you guessing) but when binge watching the first season it seems a little like the series searching for direction. Even so, the characters and stories are engaging. I find myself anticipating the uncovering of deceit and rooting for justice to prevail.",1411084800,,577,5.073684210526316

We thought the character of Veronica Mars and the plot of the movie showed some interesting themes, language and situations in contemporary society.  We had never watched the Veronica Mars television series prior to seeing the film on HBO.  The Veronica Mars series (Season One) is o.k.  The series has the same cast members attending Neptune high school, and the pranks, situations and private detective discoveries each episode are, at times, corny and high-schoolish.  That said, a viewer continues to discover the unfoldings of the Veronica Mars' (Kristen Bell) character as the season one advances--relationships with peers, developing values, and confronting life's situations.  As older viewers, we are more ""fascinated"" than ""intrigued.""",1409961600,,884,5.559701492537314

Kristin Bell's acting is superb.  She personifies what we would all like a daughter to be with her mature take and understanding of how the World works.  She seems to always make the right decisions.  I recommend this series to anybody who would like a fresh take on family life is a single parent setting.,1409616000,,452,4.397590361445783

2367304,5,B000A59PMO,"Love this show! I expected it to be a teeny bopper, goody - goody show geared to 13- year olds, but I couldn't have been further from the truth. I watched most of it in a streaming marathon over the course of a week. The dialogue is sharp and peppered with lots of innuendo, and the cases deal with rape and murder. They manage to make a teenage girl's involvement in the investigations plausible, and although it's not a comedy they throw in some laugh - out - loud humour. If you'd like more info I found a cool website that gives a well - rounded overview of Veronica Mars and other shows at http://streamingtvreviews.com.",1407628800,,625,4.443478260869565

2367336,5,B000A59PMO,I heard about Veronica Mars from a message board where people were recommending detective shows.  I love this show!  It's as good as Columbo and much better than Monk.  I am watching this set for a second time while I wait for the arrival of the season 2 DVDs which I ordered immediately after finishing season 1!  I like Veronica's sassy attitude and the hunky  boys that she dates.,1407542400,,383,4.492753623188406

2367357,3,B000A59PMO,"This isn't a silly kids' story, but one that is fun to watch. Veronica's father was the sheriff of their small town where a wealthy man's daughter was murdered.  The sheriff suspected the girl's father did it but he never had conclusive evidence.  The wealthy man, embarrassed by the suspicions about him, had the sheriff fired.  Veronica's father is now working as a private detective and she is his ""girl Friday"".  Veronica's mother left them soon after the sheriff was fired and, so far, this is a continuing theme as Veronica attends high school by day and does her own detective work at night for her friends and looking for her mother.

 I am a Kristen Bell fan and she does a great job as a teenage sluth.  The first couple of episodes were interesting and well done.  The second related somewhat to the first.  Now, I have watched 3 and 4 and they are not as good and are ""stand alone"" episodes, so I'm only giving this one 3 stars. The hunt for Veronica's mother and the truth about why she left is the only relating factor.

 I'll continue watching hoping the writers do a better job.",1407369600,,1094,4.474747474747475

The humor is subtle but abundant. The characters are lovable, but human, and most importantly, dynamic. Most importantly, the characters don't seem bent on destroying their own lives, as seems so prevalent in TV shows these days (is it actually possible to sleep with EVERY SINGLE ONE of your coworkers like in Grey's Anatomy?).

2367492,5,B000A59PMO,"One of my favorite shows ever.  I first watched after writer Dennis Lehane (also a huge favorite of mine) complimented it in an interview.  Veronica Mars (the series and the character) are both fluffy and tough.  The plotting, writing and character development were excellent.  And I will watch anything Rob Thomas is involved in.  (He, Joss Whedon and David Milch create universes I want to spend my alternate lives in.)  There's a reason fans funded a movie sequel.  They (and I) miss these characters immensely.  I am a grown adult with a rich, full and (sometimes) exciting life and I STILL want to be Veronica Mars when I grow up.  :)  BTW, Season 1 was the my fave (before the network got too involved in dinking around with it - don't get me started on networks.  They ruin a lot of good stuff.)",1406678400,,802,4.538461538461538

Her dad is a good actor who we liked in earlier role and does a nice job here too. The supporting actors are all pretty decent and well cast.

There is nothing deep here,  just escape entertainment 101. We watch an episode occasionally when we want something light but funn. So far we are only a few episodes into season 1 but expect to continue watching til we run out of episodes.

2367539,5,B000A59PMO,"Just be glad you are not on her list to be looked at closer.  The writing, the arcs, the characters, the PACING and the deliverance of justice are the best aspects of this series that was too good to be true and a must-watch.  You have to follow closely all the clues and trails they leave you for if you fail you will wonder how they arrived at each station of review and delivery.  Pause each time someone who is watching leaves the room.  Just because you like someone does not mean they are free of either scrutiny or actual and deliberate wrong-doing for which they will get what they deserve.  This is just the first season of tight plot-lines and snappy repartee delivered by titled heroine who is not without her own foibles and poor judgment along the way.  Aside from Veronica, my favorite characters were Logan and Weevil.  Let's no try to understand why they and their friends tread their paths but enjoy the problems in which they embroiled themselves requiring Veronica's help near weekly to either get out of or find the better-lit path on which to tread.

Although Veronica, played by Kristen Bell, is not always believable as a high school student because she has so much freedom, is so gifted at PI work, and looks and acts a bit more mature than most high schoolers, she is fun and sweet.

This first season sets the stage for Veronica's quirky wit, and Kristen breathes life into the character so that the two blend as one.  It only gets better.  I bought the movie and am hoping there will be more to come.  BTW - Rob Thomas wrote a book that picks up where the movie ends, so do yourself a favor and read it as well.  I had been bugging my son to watch this show - he finally did and he's now so hooked he bought all three seasons.  I'm jealous that he is getting to meet all these characters for the first time.

I remember when it was on I did not watch it. Am glad I was able to watch it straight through.
I think Kristen Bell is adorable, she was believable a bit too savvy for a high school student but was tough and smart and I thought that brought a lot to the series.
I will not recount it here as many have done so before me. I will say I enjoyed each episode building on different angles. I think that she was smart to make her connections and to keep them in front of her. The writing is smart and for what it is it is very entertaining.
I would recommend this series with a strong female character.",1405209600,,653,4.069767441860465

Veronica Mars is a wonderful combination a valley girl gone Nancy Drew with a healthy taste for sex and mystery. Her dad Mathesar alien leader of the Thermians is transformed into a bumbling Private Investigator resembling Red Skelton The Fox. The cast spends so much time slipping each other the tongue we lose focus on the very laughable plots. We real in horror that anti-social PCH biker gang lead by Eric Von Zipper on vespers.  This biker gang presents us violence in the form of taping wannabes to the high school flag pole hardly the Sons off Anarchy stuff. We are to believe that Veronica who spends more time in the back seat of a car is outraged when she wakes up and realizes she has been drugged and sexual assaulted at a party. Still nothing slows Miss Mars down whether it is finding a killer, solving a crime or switching lovers faster than Heidi Fleiss the million dollar madam of Hollywood.",1404950400,3,1061,4.58421052631579

Lots of likable (and some not so much) characters that develop complexity as the seasons progress. Great to see the father/daughter relationship that is caring and mutually respectful but still has edge and of course secrets.

Season One has an overarching mystery Veronica is obsessed with solving. Between her private eye dad and her classmates there are plenty of other cases that keep her busy each episode. When does this girl go to class? Who cares, she's already smarter than most and way more entertaining. Best female heroine since Buffy.",1404691200,,687,5.079646017699115

At first I thought it was a young kids show (as most of the characters are in high school), but as I watched it I became hooked even though I am in the older generation. Everything is done with such precision which makes the show flow smoothly along.  The story line is also great; it keeps you guessing about who killed Veronica's best friend Lilly ( shown in flashbacks), and why did Veronica's mother run away from home when Veronica was young (also shown in flashbacks and in the present), and who is Veronica's real father (also shown in flashbacks).  Add to all this that all of Veronica's past and present boy friends have rich parents and live in a swanky California town and you have a great program.  There are also some flashbacks about her boy friends which add to the mysterious atmosphere of the show.  It is well worth watching and I am only watching the first season with 2 more to go.",1404432000,,1110,4.3951219512195125

2368140,4,B000A59PMO,"We've been binge-watching this series over the last few nights. It's a bit stereo-typical of California High Schools, but there are enough clever (and touching) points to make it a fun watch. Fun for the entire family? Well there's no nudity if that's what you're worried about, but there are adult situations and the implication of teen sex--but no sex scenes--so PG-13 (at least not so far). The violence is often implied, but there none-the-less. It paints a picture of a class of kids too rich and privileged for their own good and those that have to live and go to school with them--every day.

My only issue is the casting. Yes, they're all (mostly) good actors but seriously? The star (Kirsten Bell) looks her age (she's 24) as does most of the cast. The scenes where she's young don't really work (just pigtails)--seriously? Yes, it's tough to get good, experienced performances out of teens who are still dealing with hormones and stage parents. ;)",1404259200,,957,4.8

The clues are there but usually presented in such a way that I usually missed the significance until Veronica solved it. The core actors are very professional and made the stories very believable. I also liked that there issues that made the stories more than pure escapism. After I'd watched, I let my 12 year old daughter watch the episodes (with some caveats) and she both enjoyed them and learned a lot (now she wants a camera like Veronica's).",1404086400,,583,4.669902912621359

Kristen Bell is engaging, witty, and identifiable as the lead character in this Ally McBeal-esque series. The relationship with her father is a plot line itself, and serves as a thoughtful example for single parent families -- while Veronica's character is highly insightful and intelligent, as well as independent to an extraordinary (sometimes dangerous) degree, it is clear that her adult characteristics result from the loving and insightful care of her father.

The relationships seem real and the main characters are people you would like to know. Veronica is a hard boiled PI of the noir style by the time she is a Junior in High School.

She makes mistakes, people don't always like her,  I love it!  I get so tired of the ""perfect teen"" shows.

I never found myself getting tired of one or the other.",1403222400,,296,4.711538461538462
2368575,5,B000A59PMO,"Smart writing and compelling plots are the reasons why I give five stars. There aren't too many shows that keep me guessing, and I never guessed the murderer before it was revealed to me. Some of the individual episodes were more predictable, but the mystery of the overall arc of the season was amazing.",1403222400,,304,4.648148148148148

2368578,5,B000A59PMO,The cast of characters is perfect.  I really like Veronica's character and how she can get along with students from all facets of life.  I have enjoyed being surprised by the twists and turns in the story line.,1403136000,,210,4.5
2368579,5,B000A59PMO,I really like this show & very sad it only had 3 seasons. It's one of those show you can watch multiple times.  Love that they came out with a movie to follow up on the characters lives,1403136000,,185,3.8684210526315788

2368581,2,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars is appealing enough. She has spunk and is smart and the plot is interesting enough, but it's so high school. After maybe four episodes I grew tired of the monotony of Veronica always being the smartest girl around and oh, she's a rebel too. And she has such upstanding and squeaky clean morals. Blah. Underneath all that cuteness and sparkle she's fairly judgmental and boring. I actually watched more episodes than I wanted to just because the male actors on the show are so good looking. Otherwise, I don't quite get the cult status this show has. It's kind of juvenile.",1403136000,,586,4.699029126213592

Not sure why I never tried it out a decade ago when it first ran.
The movie that came out, which I have not yet seen, prompted me to give the series a try.
Kristen did such a great job as a voice actor in Frozen and she has been impressive in several other roles.
I gave it a spin on account of her and it has not been disappointing.

In fact, the ability to stream the series on Amazon Prime was a big motivator for me to subscribe to that service. I waited with great anticipation to see the film and then went to see it in the theater hoping I would not be disappointed. It was not only entertaining, but it exceeded my expectations. I was on the edge of my seat for the entire film as one subplot after another wove in the familiar cast from Logan, Mac, Wallace, etc. When the film was over myself and others in the audience broke out into an applause.

Kristen Bell does a fantastic job as Veronica with excellent support by Enrico Colanto who is a very under-rated actor.  The rest of the cast does a fair or adequate job.  Most of the young actors on this show will never be seen or heard from again.  The story line is engaging albeit a little too juvenile at times with all the high school stupidity.

She makes some money becoming the school private detective and this is the hook that holds the show together while her private life and her efforts to locate and get he mother home unfold.

2369317,5,B000A59PMO,Wife and kids love this show.  The satire and witty comments are amusing.  As well compared to many other crime dramas it is well written and has a strong plot.  Looks to be another show canceled in its prime and not given the right time slots to shine.  An all together too common ocurrance with certain networks.,1401926400,,314,4.456140350877193

2369410,5,B000A59PMO,"Oh my god. I started watching this show because I had heard about the kickstarter campaign, I figured that if it was good enough that the fans were willing to fund a movie, then it had to be one hell of a show. I didn't start watching until I got out of school though -I'm responsible in that way- which is good because once you get hooked on this show it will invade your mind. I was lucky enough to avoid spoilers and wow. It's a fun and tangled web of a show and I love that everything is tied together, it always pulls the rug from under your feet (I'm speaking more towards the Who-Killed-Lilly-Kane plot-line over the individual episodic mysteries). The show was quick and witty and I was happily pulled along by the fantastic drama that came from the actors and the script. It can be a little funny though, seeing the 'high-tech' electronics and all. I've seen so many flip-phones in this show it's almost like I've been transported back to the early 2000's. Don't let that get your hopes down any though, it's still an amazing first season- even if it does have some rather dated references.

I'd give it 5 stars but while I liked ""Veronica"" using her creativity and questioning mind for public good and to help others, she acts like a brat when she breaks laws and societal rules to advance her own personal curiousity and personal goals. Of course, she's only 17 in season 1.....perhaps as I watch the next two seasons I'll find she grows up a bit and develops a code of personal honor.",1401580800,,442,4.753246753246753

I like mysteries and it sort of reminds of Nancy Drew, which I grew up on.  Like the fact that it's a new mystery each week and yet has a recurrent theme from episode to episode.  Characters are either lovable or hated, which makes for fun watching.  Good show!",1401580800,,426,4.48051948051948

Veronica is a nice, good girl, caring hyper-smart teenager - an anomaly for sure, but played very realistically - whose parents were fairly high up on the social ladder.  She mixed with the rich and super rich kids at school, but she has a conscience.  Disaster strikes when her best friend is murdered, her father, as the Sheriff, goes after the murdered girl's father as the main suspect.  Unfortunately, this man owns the largest company in this fictional SoCal beach town, employs most of the people in the town and has many friends in high places.  The Sheriff loses his position, but decides to stay in town as a PI.  Mother bails, Veronica stays and is his secretary/side sleuth after and during school.  Lots of good stories here.  Recommend highly!",1401494400,,997,4.607954545454546

2369550,5,B000A59PMO,I enjoyed this show very much.  I liked how each episode had a mystery to solve in addition to the mystery that is threaded through the entire season.  The characters are interesting and as I watched I wanted to see what would happen to each.  I enjoyed the father daughter relationship between Veronica and Keith Mars -- they have a great way of relating.  I would suggest this series to anyone to likes a good mystery.,1401494400,,420,4.4868421052631575

Back home I do not have television service (on purpose), and cannot stand watching commercial TV in my hotel suite at night.  So I thought I would look for some TV series to run through.  First I went on a total Glee-fest, and loved it.  Then I was searching again, and turned to Veronica Mars.

1.  You don't have to be a Glee fan to like Veronica Mars - total different kind of show
2.  Well written, great characters and dialogue, good acting, cool major plot line runs through the whole first season (SERIOUSLY looked forward to the last episode to find out 'who dunnit' !) - but good minor plot lines in most episodes.
3.  Entertaining, clever series.  Not fluffy, not intense.  Just a relaxing, entertaining 'watch'.

I won't have finished this whole series (just started Season 2) by the time I get home.  Have slow internet connection there out on a rural farm, so streaming can be difficult.  Hope I will get to finish watching the whole series!

I suppose it would not be as appealing if everything was not as over the top as it is.  Kristen Bell is ""like...so fabulous!"" in this role.
It's fun to romanticize that the outcast can continually out-wit the ""in crowd"" with her superior maturity and intelligence.  This is heightened by the extreme socio-economic disparity and Veronica's ability to see beyond her high school standing....what if we...what if I...could have only had such insight back in 1984???  I mean think of where I could be today had I only been like Veronica!  Maybe that's why I enjoy it...it's more about me than her...wow that attitude is so ""high school"".",1401408000,,821,4.920289855072464

2369652,5,B000A59PMO,"This was an above average who-done-it running 22 one hour-episodes. The premise of the story is that Veronica Mars is the daughter of Kieth Mars who is the former sheriff and now a private investigator. He employs Veronica to help him out. She turns out to be an exceptional PI on her own. The episodes were pretty much stand alone but there was the underlying theme about who really killed her best friend. I will admit that a few of the episodes were kind of easy to figure out but most had you guessing until the end! There was comedy throughout with plenty of one-liners and I found myself laughing out loud a lot.
I am a fan of Kristen Bell. Her movies I really like were ""When In Rome"" and ""You Again"". I look forward to season two. I have the DVD of the movie that was made of ""Veronica Mars"" recently. But I don't want to watch it until I've finished the three seasons of the TV show. The movie takes place years after the TV show. Season one has her in high school while season two (I'm told) does as well. Season three has her as a freshman in college. The movie takes place years later when she is an adult. I hope my willpower will hold up but I don't know. I may watch the movie soon!

Her friend gets a girlfriend one week, and then you never see her again.  Also, the zexy outfits are a little too contrived.  It feels like they are trying to put a little (pg) t-n-a in there just to keep the adolescent minds hanging on.

2369658,5,B000A59PMO,"I started watching because of my love for Kristen Bell and I stayed for the creative story lines and the complete cast. The show makes you want to BE Veronica Mars...resident bad-ass, girl who always does the right thing, and girl all the boys want but can't have. Kristen Bell is amazing in this series. I will say my one complaint is that the episodes tend to sometimes stand alone outside of the series, and some of the seemingly main plot lines involving the series characters sometimes do not stay in focus because they don't fit with the main mystery Veronica is solving. Sometimes that's frustrating, but they tend to get back to all of the relationships/stories eventually. Overall, I would say it's a great series to binge on.

It lived up to the hype and I binge watched the whole season in one weekend. I would have done it in one sitting if I could have stayed awake (not as young as I used to be, I just can't will myself to stay awake anymore).

The dialog is great, Kristen Bell is awesome in the lead roll. My only complaint is there isn't enough Amanda Seyfried. On the other hand she is in the show a lot for someone who dies in the first episode.

I was hooked after watching the pilot. The MC's father is an ex-sheriff and now works as a private detective and Veronica works in his office but takes on cases of her own. It's very funny but also there's good drama and a kind of tumultuous on again/off again romance eventually develops between the MC and a character you would not expect later on in the first season. It was so unexpected I was like, ""what the hell just happened?"" I love this guy too. It does not seem so at first, but he's desperately in love with her. They have a sort of hot/cold, yes/no, love/hate thing going on.  He actually turns out to be very unexpectedly sweet and quite protective of her.

It got cancelled after the third season but there was a movie recently released that sort of ties up the loose ends at least with her suitors and now there's a book series.

Granted, I've only watched Episodes 1 & 2, but it just seems like its trying too hard to NOT be one dimensional when it just is. Maybe since I didn't watch it earlier, I'm way past the target demographic for the show. It might be good for young teen audiences.",1400284800,,419,4.0

But what I love about it is Veronica and her dad's relationship although unconventional but unbreakable bond. This show has everything you could possibly want, mystery, action, love triangle and single parent issues.

I expected it to be dated, since it was first made over a decade ago, but was pleasantly surprised at how fresh and current it seemed.  Apparently, smart, snappy dialogue and excellent acting do age well.  I believe anyone who enjoys a good mystery or a good romantic show or a warm father-daughter relationship will find Veronica Mars well worth watching.",1399939200,,477,4.72289156626506

2370391,5,B000A59PMO,"Smart dialog, interesting twist on solve it series with a nice story arc grabbed me into this series. It ended up rattling around in my mind as it also explored a lot of social issues, good vs. evil, pre-judging, ethics, high school life, privacy while being very engaging. There was a lot happening, the usual challenges with mysteries have more 'plausibility' then expected through some clever character setup that allows for 'easy solving' of mysteries where it should not be. An interesting combination of fluff and substance at the same time.",1399766400,,547,5.021978021978022

2370397,5,B000A59PMO,"This show is great in that it mixes in real life issues into the story lines.  Not just a mystery or who done it like Nancy Drew but also a social commentary on today's high school interactions as based upon class, popularity, gender and race.

I recommend this television series be seen by all pre-teens/teens (starting at age 13).  While some of the material is for mature audiences, in this day and age, these are the issues which high schoolers deal with on a regular basis.  And just like 21 Jumpstreet in its day, social issues are presented in each episode, which can be further discussed between parents and children during and after each show ends.  This is a great way to open up dialogue within one's household.",1399766400,,722,4.609375

I decided to check it out though because if fans were willing to give that much money to make a movie, I wanted to know why.  It was well worth checking out! I watched the entire first season in two days, almost like reading a good book.  I do like the Veronica/Logan relationship.  I especially like the way the writers allowed Logan's character to develop and mature.  They did not pigeon hole any of the characters into stereotypical teenage roles.  The writing on the show was creative and the use of metaphors well timed and on target.",1399420800,,655,4.453781512605042

Each show having it's own mini story inside the bigger picture, solved within the episode entertain on the surface while allowing the main story to developer slowly in the background.

2370589,5,B000A59PMO,"I would have given this series 6 stars if possible.  The pacing is excellent; it never drags.  When I started watching I felt the actors were maybe a little too mature, but the writers succeeded in incorporating the occasional lapse in judgement for all of the characters (including Veronica) that one would expect from a teen.  A variety of social and moral values are demonstrated, but the writers have so far succeeded in avoiding any total stereotypes.  The nerds and the jocks are all represented as real people with sometimes serious issues affecting their lives.  In spite of all the serious undertones to the story there is an ""enjoy the life you have"" air to it all that is just plain fun.  Kristen Bell is superb in the lead role.  I hope she has further opportunities in the detective genre.",1399334400,,802,4.685714285714286

2370591,1,B000A59PMO,"I liked this show very much. My advise, as soon as you get a satisfying ending to season 2, leave the 3rd season alone. It has no end. This networks should be sued or some laws should be enacted that forces networks not to pull the plug until there is an end, even a fake early end to any given show. They should otherwise give the money back to anybody who bought the DVD or BR sets. Even if you paid for streaming, you should get your money back as they sold you an unfinished product and you were not properly informed about it. That would show them!!! And for all of those who like to write reviews, please let others know when a show has no end!!!! Otherwise your reviews are as incomplete an empty as those shows with no end!",1399248000,2,731,4.154929577464789

2370740,5,B000A59PMO,"I started watching Veronica Mars after someone mentioned it at a dinner discussion.

It did not take long for me to fall in love with Veronica Mars. She is plucky, brave, smart, etc etc. I completely enjoyed the character of Veronica and I enjoyed watching the interaction she had between the other characters. The likable characters are easily likable even with their flaws. It is very quick to see in each season the person who is supposed to be wearing the black hat for the season.

Each season has an overarching theme or mystery, except for season three which has several mini mysteries. The theme for season one is 'who raped Veronica Mars?'. While she doesn't tackle this issue in every show it is there, lurking in the background.

It is very easy to make the comparison between veronica and Nancy Drew. However, the Nancy Drew mysteries do not tackle such adult subjects. In later seasons they address many other adult issues. Drug use, gang membership, dropping out of school, sex are only a few of them. What disturbed me was how many scenes, especially in season three, there were that had two people in bed.

If you are opposed to premarital sex, teens having sex and addressing it very frankly then this may not be the show for you. My daughter who is thirteen found season two and season three to be a 'bit much' (her words). Just something to be aware of going into watching this show.

Overall though, I completely enjoyed it. The characters were great. I wanted to find out what would happen to them. I can understand why a movie was made as a follow up to this show. I was left hanging and wanted to know how it ended between Veronica and her nonboyfriend boyfriend.

Well worth watching. enjoy.",1398816000,,1715,4.60655737704918

Some of the characters are pretty flat caricatures, but the snappy dialogue makes up for all of that.  Most of the acting won't be winning any awards, but Enrico Colantoni is one of the best in the business.  Enough plot twists to keep you coming back.  I like that it's less raunchy than most shows written for teens these days.",1398729600,,417,4.657534246575342

2370884,4,B000A59PMO,"Not sure what actually inspired me to watch this show in the first place but I have been pleasantly surprised.  The show is heavy with young actors which is fun to see as you will remember them in many other movies or shows.  The negative is that not all actors are good so you will get a few that really surprise you with how bad they are...  Overall I think its a great show and the portions I don't really care for are often related to high school drama.  I cant really blame the show for that considering what it is all about.  However it does fall into the ""saved by the bell"" category occasionally...",1398643200,,606,4.234782608695652

2370890,5,B000A59PMO,"As a man who spent his high school years enjoying the collective television works of Joss Whedon I don't know how I missed this show. It is amazing, detective Noir set in a high school that doesn't feel cheesy but believable. I've already marathoned the other two seasons and intend to buy the blu ray of the movie when it is available.

2370930,5,B000A59PMO,"I was a bit hesitant to watch this show at first, but it quickly became my very favorite television show of all time. I love Kristen Bell as Veronica and Jason Dohring as Logan is pretty great too; they have a great dynamic and play off of each other really well. Veronica is a great role model for every girl out there- she's strong, resourceful, and she is not inhibited by her gender, socioeconomic status, or history of sexual assault. I highly recommend this show to anyone even the littlest bit interested- watch it! You won't regret it :)",1398470400,,545,4.515151515151516

I've always enjoyed detective stories since I was little (Nancy Drew anyone?) so this fits right in. Each episode focuses on an individual case that is being solved so you get resolution with each one. Simultaneously,
the entire season has one big story/mystery woven throughout. I enjoy that combo. Great show. :) I should also mention that the main characters are

At the time, I knew little of the premise and the title did nothing to interest me. Skip to years later when a friend suggested its awesomeness to me, and BAM -- I was hooked! Kristen Bell is perfectly cast as the witty, independent, sleuth Veronica, and her relationships with the supporting cast are both intriguing and realistic. The writing is stellar, easily balancing humor, mystery, suspense, and romance while never losing its grip on its own reality. It is so multi-layered and just plain enjoyable that it is no wonder it grabbed such a strong following. Season 1 is definitely my favorite; I think the storylines and energy are at their best.",1398297600,,770,4.711111111111111

Especially the flawless Kristen Bell as the incredible Veronica Mars and the mesmerizing Jason Dohring as Logan Echolls--I never would have believed he could have fleshed that character out as much as he did and give him such range and likeability. The cast's chemistry together is amazing. Notably Veronica and Logan and of course, Veronica and Keith. I am so thrilled to see such a powerful, brilliant female lead character! I'm hooked. I loved the movie too and I'm addicted. I want a continuation of the series. LoVe forever!",1398211200,,589,5.082474226804123

After hearing all of the hype about the Veronica Mars movie and the kickstarter campaign to get it produced I decided to see what all of the hoopla was about. The show seemed kind of cheesy at first but I was quickly sucked into the story. It's so good with characters to love and an interesting story. I am completely addicted. I have always been a fan of YA shows but this transcends the genre and could be a show for anyone that likes an interesting storyline and a little bit of mystery with their story. Highly recommended.",1398211200,,583,4.3090909090909095

It piqued my interest and I watched the pilot. I've been binge watching groups of episodes for a week. Aside from falling deeply in love with Kristen Bell *blush* the entire show has a unique quality to it. I am normally a man who watches shows like The Killing, Justified, Red Road, House of Cards and Game of Thrones for example. Watching a teenage private detective is not normally my bag. And I would normally be embarrassed to admit loving the show. But it's addictive. The writing and acting has just the right mix of wit, humor and mystery with big doses of incredulity and ridiculousness. It all makes for the perfect secret affair.",1398124800,,803,4.583333333333333

But what makes her such a great character is that these qualities are tempered by darker, less positive sides--she's vengeful, rarely questions cost-benefit, is often wrong, and even when she is right, in fact, often when she is right, she leaves a wake of destruction behind her like a class-five hurricane, meaning her ""victories"" are often bittersweet.  That complexity is what makes her a great character. What makes her one of the greatest is the on-the-nose portrayal by Kristen Bell.  Many actors do an excellent job with the roles they're given, but you could list of a dozen others who could play the same role with aplomb.  But sometimes the character on the page meets an actor seemingly destined to play her/him--the perfect match.  And such is the case with Kristen Bell in this role, one it appears she was born to play.  Her portrayal is never anything but spot on and it's simply impossible to imagine anyone else as Veronica Mars.  She inhabits the role wholly and in fact, creates it as much as the writer.  She alone is reason to watch this show.

But it doesn't hurt that the chemistry with bad boy Logan is combustible whenever the two share the screen. Or that it has if not the best, certainly one of the best father-daughter (or parent-child) relationships ever shown on TV, both laugh-out-loud funny and incredibly, deeply loving.  It isn't hard to imagine watching a show that just had the two of them--Veronica and her father--hanging out at home together, not even bothering with the mysteries, just cooking or watching TV. Their relationship and dialogue is that good, that compelling and entertaining.

There is some great plotting, but there are also weaker shows, weaker story lines, some moments that aren't even very good.  Some characters, especially in season three, for instance, are presented far too  broadly, more caricature than character--frat boys, feminists, etc..  But really, while the stories are more than enough to carry you through, even if the quality varies, it isn't what happens that is important here but to whom it happens. The show, unfortunately, thanks to a young blonde heroine at its head is often compared to Buffy, though it's often a relatively surface-level, shallow type of comparison.  The way I'd put it is that I love Buffy the Vampire Slayer the show, one of the best written on TV, but I fell IN love with Veronica Mars the character.  When you get to the end of Season 3, you'll be incredibly pained there's no more, and then you'll want to flip back and being again, just to spend more time with her, the hell with that you know how all the mysteries turn out.  And of course, there's now the movie. Which only proves the point of Kristen Bell being Veronica Mars, a character you'll happily watch her play in her 80s.  Highly recommended, but block out some time--you'll want to binge watch.",1398038400,,3109,4.844990548204159

Smart, fun and engaging detective drama/teen nighttime soap opera. The stories are well written and keep you engaged both within each episode and from show to show. Each episode has one or more mystery which is resolved within it as well as long-term plot-lines which get new puzzle pieces added to them each episode.

The characters are engaging and believable. The high-school kids really seem like they could be in high school (although none that I ever went to). The adults have a convincing range from intelligent to dullard and from honest to devious. The main character played by Kristen Bell makes the idea of a teen-aged detective seem possible and makes her personal trials and tribulations as a teen-ager compelling.

There is a bit of violence and a little gore so if you are put off by such things you might want to beware although compared to the amount that you see in some of the detective shows that come out now, a decade after this show, it is probably fairly mild.",1397779200,,1064,4.679144385026738

2371389,3,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars, Season 1

I used to watch this TV show on occasion. Its an interesting variation of the classical private detective story where justice is sought through a small business rather than a government agency. The setting seems implausible, could a teenage girl really have the maturity and experience to work as a private detective? What about state laws that license and regulate this occupation? The stories also seem implausible for teenagers. One advantage of using a teenager is this: if caught doing something illegal they should get a lighter sentence, or have it written off as a youthful prank. Popular television series will last for more than three years. Its not so much that is was bad as it was not that great. These stories are a modern version of Nancy Drew, another teenage detective from an earlier generation. Why does Veronica want to hang out with the spoiled children of the super rich? Does this show maturity? Or part of her undercover work?

The story here is that Veronicas father used to be Sheriff. When a teenage girl was found murdered her father was treated as a suspect. [Most victims know their murderer.] The father was a very wealthy and powerful man so the Sheriff was force out of a job! [Was this plausible in modern life?] This educated the viewer about the realities of the real world where the rich have much more power than the average voter. Could a rich man have so much power over an elected Sheriff? These stories also reflect the life and culture of the 1990s. Veronicas mother had gone away, leaving the possibility or a reunion and more drama. The unsolved murder of that girl could provide other dramatic possibilities. Showing how information is gathered is educational. I wonder how much could be gathered from the Internet today? The movie The Net shows the dangers of providing personal information to anyone.

Detective stories originate in the 19th century, Sherlock Holmes set a standard that was often imitated but never equaled. Eyewitness testimony was the most important in solving crimes. Even today it is most important when there are witnesses. They also knew of the possible faults in eyewitness identification (The Tichbourne Claimant). Trave evidence, as used by Sherlock Holmes, provided an objective witness to a crime. But Holmes also warned against improper conclusions (a stick points in two directions). Knowledge gained led to improved police investigations in the 20th century. The use of outside experts became rare. Often defense lawyers requested them to challenge the evidence gathered by the police (as in the Simpson murder trial).

Today private detectives are usually hired for private investigations (divorce actions, insurance claims, business problems, and tracing a missing person). The Maltese Falcon and Farewell, My Lovely were stories that began with the hunt for a missing person. The Pinkerton Agency was employed by banks, trains, and express agencies to catch robbers and thieves. Businessmen realized that socialization lowered their costs so a government agency, a National Office of Investigation, would perform these tasks at a much lower cost. Costs would come from everyones taxes not from the few who benefitted from their work. What was the eventual effect from a more powerful government agency? It also did the counter-intelligence work that any government needs. The movies about private detectives were followed by stories about government agents.",1397606400,,3464,5.147424511545293

2371427,3,B000A59PMO,"This updated and edgier ""Nancy Drew"" has been a fun ride through the first three seasons. They did a wonderful job of keeping the answer to the mystery just out if reach. They don't resort to completely leaving clues out just to shock you at the reveal. They're all there, quite often very subtle, but they are there.

I can definitely see the reason for the popularity. The show has a really cool vibe. It definitely feels as though there is a writer for each character because they are so well developed. Something else that started out bothering me but ended up being cool was that if a character mumbled, they let them mumble. If they were spastic they let them run with it. Tell your story like you want, and let the audience decide.

My only beef, not a big one either, is that you could tell when they were hurting for stories. They usually got on Kristen Bell's soapbox with story lines that involved animal rights, invisiblechildren.com , homosexual rights or religious groups. The stories were handled well and not too heavy handed but kind of slowed the momentum of the other story lines. I know, ""Shouldn't she use her voice to further her causes?"" you might ask. Sure! It's just gives the impression that the story ideas were no longer rolling in (which might explain why there's no 4th season). I simply googled Kristen Bell and found out all of her causes. That's how I prefer to find these things out. That's what Google is for. Not through my entertainment. That said, the beauty of reruns on Roku is that if it gets too preachy all I have to do is skip it and move on to the next episode.",1397520000,,1606,4.477815699658703

2371501,5,B000A59PMO,"My favorite 3 shows of all time are: Firefly, X-Files and Veronica Mars (not necessarily in that order). Trying to get people to watch this show was a hard sell back in the day. Basic premise is high school Nancy Drew, but with an edge. There is murder, scandals and mayhem, but it is the writing and characters that really make this show shine. I miss it so bad, but with the movie and now the book, us ""Marshmallows"" are finally having our day. More V. Mars please!",1397433600,,467,4.318181818181818
2371502,5,B000A59PMO,"Lots of story lines and they wrapped a bunch of them up with the season one finale, rather than leaving things open and milking them season after season..

I wish there were more shows that followed this format.

Plenty of light action and character development.

The show has some dark sides that would make me avoid letting kids watch it however it is not over the top with sex and very minimal graphical violence.",1397433600,,416,4.594594594594595

2371527,3,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars Season One is an entertaining series and it keeps my attention without blood, cursing, or extreme criminal behavior.

2371528,5,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars took me by surprise because it is a step above the usual teen star shlock.  The very talented cast raised it above the norm for this genre.  Kristen Bell comes through with wit that fleshes out the character.

I think my favorite part of the show is Veronica's relationship with her Father - they actually like one another.  The show has them partnering and showing that teens and adults can actually be good together.",1397433600,,432,4.644736842105263

Once I got passed the 22 minute mark in the first episode, I knew that I would be in for the full ride.  This is some great TV, and though it looks like you may not be the target audience, I promise that you are.  The writing, themes, and tone are all far beyond their high school setting.",1397347200,,439,3.898876404494382

2371566,5,B000A59PMO,old tv shows have better writing and better production values. you can actually understand what the actors are saying. i am sure they went back and did some looping to punch up the sound track. i had seen this series when it was first on tv but i still enjoyed it the second time around. watching season 2 now and there are 22 episodes not the paltry 12 we get present day.,1397347200,,373,4.194444444444445
2371567,5,B000A59PMO,Always enjoy a good story with great plot twist.  Heroine Veronica is not perfect and makes mistakes.  She always comes out of each predicament with style.  This series will keep you wanting more!!!,1397347200,,198,4.9393939393939394

2371593,5,B000A59PMO,"I never watched this series until I read a Time Mag article about the upcoming movie. The reviewer said he loved the original series, so I started watching it on Amazon. I'm hooked now. Although I don't like the angst of high schoolers ( I was never in the in crowd and didn't enjoy HS at all), watching Veronica deal with the idiots and sleuth out mysteries is a blast. It helps that she is paralyzingly cute, too. Her sidekick is great. I'm still having trouble accepting her dad's character, since I have him burned into my brain from his role in ""Person of Interest."" Now, the stuff that happens here, including the crime-solving, is horribly implausible, but if you enjoy seeing justice done, you'll enjoy this series.",1397260800,,723,4.65625

Come to think of it, I can only think of a FEW now.  The show has wonderful acting and you really get attached to the main characters on the show. You become part of their ""click."" I recently sat down and watched all three seasons and topped it off with the Veronica Mars movie! It was a great marathon! I highly recommend this to a young adult who wants to watch something besides most of the crap out there. Or if your an adult you can rewind time a little bit, sit back, watch Veronica Mars and reminisce about the good old days.",1397174400,,685,4.1893939393939394

Somehow I missed it entirely when it originally aired, and I've been enjoying it a lot via Amazon Prime. The mystery is involving, and there are sensitive and realistic portrayals of parent-child and friendship relationships. Veronica is terrifically smart and capable, but she's also lovably vulnerable when it comes to her heart. A real heroine you can root for. She is also, as one character put it, ""Cute as a bug."" :) Love it!",1397088000,,541,4.956043956043956

While the plot line of each episode isn't always original or all that interesting, it does have an intriguing overarching narrative--a mystery that Veronica Mars is working to unravel--throughout the entire first season. So the show just gets better toward the end of season one as she gets closer to solving this mystery.

One of the highlights of the show is the characters, especially the lead character (played by Kristen Bell) and her father (played by Enrico Colantoni). The supporting cast  helps round things out and add texture to the show, but many of them are only thinly developed.",1397088000,,667,4.893805309734513

2371788,4,B000A59PMO,"This show from Rob Thomas, along with Joss Whedon's various incarnations and spinoffs of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, changed what audiences had come to expect from TV shows about high school age teenagers. Sure, Freaks & Geeks and My So Called Life were fabulous prototypes, but Buffy and Veronica both had and continue to have rabid fan bases in the mainstream of TV viewership. (Veronica's biggest fans are called ""marshmallows."") This first season sets up the major premise of this genre-crossing show. (First Scene Spoiler: Veronica's best friend, played in flashbacks by the wide-eyed Amanda Seyfried, has been killed and VM won't let it go.) It also begins to quickly develop the evolving relationships between the series' major characters and Veronica, as she is portrayed with increasing confidence and skill throughout the series (and crowdfunded movie) by Kristen Bell. Suffice to say, this show was good enough to last much longer than it did. And like the aforementioned coming-of-age sagas, as well as other genre-busters like Firefly, your historical TV education isn't complete without viewing this a$$-kicking teenager detective.

The stories, these characters, how they handled their own messed up situations. They redefined how I dealt with my own issues, my own life.

And I'm not alone. I've spoken with countless people, backers of the show's movie version and not, who have each been similarly impacted by the way this show handles such social issues as rape, class wars, and government corruption.

She's a modern role model, with realistic vulnerabilities and painful personal experiences, yet she backs down from nothing and no one.  This may be curiously thought of as a twenty-first century Nancy Drew series with the father and daughter private Investigation team, set in a fictional Southern CA town that smacks of Newport Beach's rich man-poor man community.  I loved the relationship with her father, and still haven't figured out the story around her mother...

Veronica Mars is a hit, and not just by the CW's standards. The show manages to somehow mesh together all genre's of storytelling and provide relate-able characters that stray far from reject-able tv stereotypes. The writing is witty fun and the characters are smart. The episodes are focused into independent subplots with an overarching story of 'who done it.' I can't tell you how much all of these characters have won me over and how excited I am to continue my journey into the alluring world of Veronica Mars.",1396742400,,654,4.745614035087719

The characters are developed and are human for better and worse. You're never quite sure who's the bad guy in each show, it could be someone who was a good guy last time.

The first few episodes are a little rough, but as the season goes on, it presents a compelling mystery of consequence to all the characters involved, all while balancing mysteries of the day that are satisfying in their own right. Veronica herself is snarky and intelligent, driven but flawed, and vulnerable without succumbing to the tired tropes of women being helpless.

If the rest of the series holds up to this season's standards, it'll be an insta-buy on DVD/Blu-Ray.",1396742400,,539,4.8478260869565215

2371942,5,B000A59PMO,"Imagine David Lynch's seminal TV series 'Twin Peaks' if it had been set in the 21st century and focused on her best friend Donna investigating the murder of Laura Palmer. In a sense, this smart, savvy show is a 'Nancy Drew' update mixed with the type of 'Twin Peaks'-esque scenario (the unsolved murder of a popular, beautiful high school girl causes shockwaves that open old wounds, secrets and lies in a small, close-knit town).

Set in the mythical, seaside city of Neptune, California, Veronica Mars is set one year after her best friend Lily Kane, played by always gorgeous and talented Amanda Seyfried, was murdered. Veronica, in the role that made Kristin Bell famous is the daughter of local P.I., former sheriff who lost his job after accusing her father of being involved in the murder. Just prior to the murder, her boyfriend Duncan Kane, Lily's brother, suddenly dumped her and avoids her. In fact, Veronica, who works with her dad in his P.I. firm nights is a complete outcast at her high school.

And this is where the show is really strong. Besides having one of the best ensemble casts I've seen, this has to be one of, if not the, best portrayals of high school I've seen. You don't have the feel like some shows/movies that you're watching 20+ actors playing high schoolers. The way the cast talks, acts, dresses, etc. are feel like you're on location at a real high school. It's authentic and very natural in terms of the dialogue.

Veronica is smart, sassy, sarcastic and over season one is moving from outright ostracism to growing connections as one by one she helps various individuals (using her smarts and detective skills). It never feels forced or silly. The show has a running story arc related to who really killed Lily (is the wrong person in jail?) and her mom left suddenly at that time and is missing. Why? And how is everything connected to the Kanes, one of the wealthiest families in the area?

I heard about the show but had never seen in. I love Kristin Bell and Amanda Seyfried (had no idea she was in it), but what prompted me to check it out was the story of the recent movie made 10 years after the 3rd/final season ended. The story of the fan funding and people talking about how beloved the show is combined with Amazon making all 3 seasons part of Prime and I decided to give it a shot. Now halfway through season 1 I can say I love it.

And for awhile it will not feel ""dated"" as it was made just recent enough that all of the technology and things people are referencing are still for the most part familiar. A few movie/song references and ubiquitous cell phones are old flip phones, but overall doesn't feel like you're watching something ""old"" and foreign to current viewers.

Topically you'll find the show touching on everything from 1%'s vs. 99%'s, high school politics, gender roles, strong females, date rape, racism, etc. The show is great and can't wait to finish all 3 seasons and then watch the movie. Give it a look and have teen/older daughters/sisters? Should be a great one for girls to have a smart role model show which as we know is a rare thing at any point.",1396742400,,3125,4.571428571428571

2371944,4,B000A59PMO,"I resisted this show when it first aired; CW programs are typically low budget and/or poorly acted, and I wasn't particularly intrigued by the premise. However, what with Kristen Bell being something of an ""it girl"" these days, I figured I'd check it out. Boy am I glad I did! The show is very quick witted and often surprising. I was also surprised by the little known guest stars who pop occasionally, many of whom have since gone on to become well known actors. If you're on the fence- give it a chance.

2371977,5,B000A59PMO,"If Veronica Mars (the show, not the character) had one major flaw, it was the network it was on. Had the show been on ABC, NBC, or CBS, we would have been graced by 6 solid seasons. Unfortunately, the show was UPN, which meant that not only did nobody watch it, nobody had even heard of it. You can include me in the description above. This was my first go round at watching the series, and I fell in love with it.

They are ""90909"" beautiful people with appearances by Amanda Seyfried and Paris Hilton. Veronica always has a detailed solution to thwart any underhanded plot and has an appropriate retort for any nasty comment. Her father deals with his intelligent, energetic teenage daughter with love and respect leaving her with a healthy understanding. After all, he is her father, her mother left and they only have each other to discuss the complexities of life.
Working with her father as the ""receptionist"" at Mars Investigation gives her another way to quietly show her crafty skills.
I really enjoy Veronica's plot narration. It reminds me of Michael Weston's ""trade craft"" narration in ""Burn Notice"".

Kristen Bell does a cracking good job being Veronica Mars and it's very very entertaining. I would say for kids 14 and up unless you have a pretty sophisticated tween. Expect some blood in one scene, some mild violence, some implied rough sex, divorce, abandonment and alcoholism. The series has a sassiness to it that balances anything negative.  I found it very entertaining and ripe for binge watching!",1396569600,,528,5.068965517241379

The fan love is well-deserved; although I would have been pissed had I been watching this show when it was originally airing, as it's cancellation sucked.

Rob Thomas and company keep the teen angst mixed with hipness and compelling detective stories entertaining pretty much throughout, some episodes are weaker than others (as is expected) but even the soft entries are fun.

2372282,5,B000A59PMO,I did not watch this program during its original run and really regret it. Hard to believe a show with this much quality writing and acting only made it three seasons. To the CW's credit they let it run that long even with dismal ratings. I am just glad I can see it now!  I highly recommend this show.,1396310400,,302,4.11864406779661

It was certainly a surprise to learn the details!! What I like about the series is that each season the show had one main issue that was dealt with besides the show to show stories. It's very satisfying.",1396224000,,333,4.566666666666666

2372344,5,B000A59PMO,"A very pleasant surprise.  A story about high-school kids (mostly) with a bit of culture war, class warfare, mystery, detective work, and some testy attitudes as well!  Not a lot of rough and tumble gore here so if you are sensitive to that, this show should make you comfortable.  An interesting cast doing a great job and I'm guessing that you, like me, will be surprised to find out which characters become your favorites!  Give it a couple, three episodes and I'll bet you are hooked!

The mystery that Veronica had to solve in each episode was always interesting but what makes this show better than lots of other shows are the sly, darkly funny lines that Veronica and others say.",1396137600,,323,4.4576271186440675

2372382,5,B000A59PMO,"This definitely isn't only for the teen market - take it from a senior citizen who enjoyed it and hated to get to the end. Yes, I missed it when it was on the air but found it made being under the weather bearable as I plowed through the whole 3 seasons and went on to the movie and now I am starting on the book. As a great mystery lover I found the stories complex enough and the characters fleshed out and believable.  And the chemistry between Veronica and Logan sure didn't hurt!!  Just wish there was more!!",1396137600,,513,4.171717171717172

I had never seen Kristen Bell in anything before this, but she is adorable and love her father/daughter relationship.  Dialog is smart and witty.  All in all it is a fun show.  I read some reviews where some fans were disappointed that the show was canceled...okay, I thought they should have tied up loose ends, but seriously you can only play a teen for just so long.  Just proves you are only young once and should make the most of it.

Just finished watching Season Two - on to watch the third and final season.  I am way past high school years, but have two granddaughters that are teeners and loved this series.  The things we do for our grand kids.  :)",1396137600,,858,4.3949044585987265

2372403,5,B000A59PMO,"I hadn't watched this show before, but I'm glad I checked it out. I'm hooked! The story is surprisingly complex and smart for a teen flick. Veronica is a great character and is very independent but still close to her Dad.",1396137600,,221,4.414634146341464

2372448,5,B000A59PMO,"Sure Veronica Mars does not act like any real teenager, but the story and the writing are really good. The characters gradually develop into real people and not just 2-D stereotypes. The plot keeps you guessing. And like an Agatha Christie, when the mystery is solved you realized you should have known all along.  I am half way through season 2 and it is still good.",1396137600,,367,4.5606060606060606
2372449,5,B000A59PMO,"I watched this about a decade after it originally aired and I enjoyed it so much! What a well thought out show, committed to it's characters and plots even when they tended to the ridiculous.

2372537,5,B000A59PMO,The show keeps me on edge guessing who did it. It reminds me of the books I read as a child. I watched all 3 season and wish their was more.,1395964800,,140,3.5483870967741935

2372539,5,B000A59PMO,I started watching this show with no high expectations. I liked how the story was initially set up (how Veronica became an outcast) and it grew on me with each episode. It's like a teen soap opera but with less cliches and more diverse characters and interesting situations. Now I'm watching season 2 and I'm still hooked.,1395964800,,322,4.666666666666667

2372542,4,B000A59PMO,This show is very underrated. It doesn't get 5 stars because of the over sexualization of the main character on one or two episodes. The show can stand on its on two feet. Other than that it is very good,1395964800,,203,4.1
2372543,4,B000A59PMO,Good entertainment. I don't normally go for the high school teen shows but after watching the 1st episode I liked the plot and multiple story lines.  To me it's just entertainment without the underlying messages of some shows.  It simply relaxes me but keeps me coming back.  I wouldn't watch it if it had commercials though.,1395964800,,325,4.767857142857143
2372564,5,B000A59PMO,"This show was one that I missed while it was airing, and I'm glad I was able to find it again, years later.

In the vein of a lot of the CW/WB series, this show featured a group of high school students, many of them good looking, trying to find their way in the world.  Unlike most of the other shows along those lines, this series dealt with some very serious topics in a real way and featured great acting and writing to make it all work better than most.

The series opens revealing that Veronica (Kristen Bell) is a Junior in High School, who has to deal with the fact that she is being ostracized by her peers after the tragic death of her best friend, and the replacement of her father as the Sheriff who people felt botched the investigation into her friend's death by going after one of the town's most influential and wealthy citizen.  In addition, she was victimized herself around the same time and trying to come to terms with the ramifications of that.

Instead of fleeing the town, her father opens a private investigation service, where she helps out and even participates in some of the investigations.  This lets him to continue looking into the murder, while also earning a living mostly checking on potential cheating spouses in the wealthy town.

Even with the serious topics shown on the series, the wit and humor of the show, particularly through the snide remarks of Veronica and her friends and family, shines through, allowing often very serious topics to be dealt with in a palatable and often enjoyable way.  This is definitely a show that deserves its ""cult status"" as a highly crafted show where the people involved in its creation put through a solid, heart-felt effort to produce something worth watching.",1395964800,,1736,4.650326797385621
2372565,4,B000A59PMO,Veronica is a modern day Nancy Drew and solves the cases of missing people and money each episode while thoughout the season she is working on the case of her best friend's death.,1395964800,,179,4.454545454545454

2372568,4,B000A59PMO,"It's kind of fun.  Geared mostly toward high school students, but even as an adult, it keeps my interest.  Veronica is a feisty and brilliant outsider among her peers.  Her father is a private investigator, and like Nancy Drew, she continually gets involved in his work, and uses her skills to control her high school environment, which is comprised mostly of snotty rich kids.  Don't mess with Veronica.  Do that and things will not go well for you.",1395964800,,450,4.717948717948718

2372588,5,B000A59PMO,"This show has the snappiest dialogue, the best references and allusions, and the most adorable cast when compared to a number of other primetime choices.  Way better than a Fox high school drama I know that may have had a great concept, but has strayed and doesn't have the level of witty banter that VM does (I still watch the Fox version; gotta see how it all pans out).  For example, in the Fox show, an ""evil"" character suddenly becomes chipper and sweet--there's not even really a period of ""misunderstood bully/b--ch/jerk,"" just presto-change-o, different personality.  In VM, the bad guys(in the mostly gender-free sense of the word ""guys"") have an arc, their flaws and virtues develop over time and in sync with the narratives.  You come to love a jerk like Logan Echolls in spite of yourself, pretty much mirroring both the process and the state in which the lead character does.  She shouldn't, but she does-- both of them are flawed and bring out both the best and worst in each other. Other bad guys (well, except Liam; he's never recuperated) get narratives that make sense, even if the experiences behind their jerk-y behavior begin to reveal source of their motivations and other aspects of them.

I am re-binge-watching before I check out the crowd-funded movie just out.",1395878400,,1287,4.853881278538813

2372590,5,B000A59PMO,"I am really late to the Veronica Mars party, but I guess it is better to be late then to never arrive at all. Boy am I glad I have finally found this gem. Veronica Mars is simply incredible television. The story telling, the acting, the cast, and the production are all top notch. It has been a long time since I have been as thoroughly engrossed in a narrative as I have been with Veronica Mars. Sadly like many good things, its time was cut far too short. There may only be 3 seasons, and now thanks to the many fans, a movie. However every episode is treasure.",1395878400,,563,4.174311926605505

However I am having lots of trouble with the feed for Amazon prime. No matter how many times I adjust it, the sound is constantly jumping and stuttering and I have to adjust the time lapsed bar to reset it, but it happens again. I'm about to give up on it.

2372633,5,B000A59PMO,"Veronica, like Buffy, dominates her world only she does it with her cleverness.  The show is fun and entertaining in a smart way, great dialog and very good performances all around.  It is a bit incestuous (the group of main characters all seem to be involved in every mystery) but still keeps your interest.  Veronica's clear thinking and dogged determination are an inspiration and when coupled with her strong sense of right and wrong make for a very adorable character.  It's a fun show and in spite of a fairly constant series of tragedies, the characters remain mostly upbeat, shake it off and get on with their lives.",1395878400,,624,4.75

A don't think I would like my tweener grandkids watching it but better than the sex filled crap on TV now for teenagers. No embarrassing nude bed scenes. Just some good scenes that could start healthy dialogue. Only watched 5 episodes while ironing but will watch more.,1395705600,,359,4.714285714285714

This is a charming teenage angst show with adult sub-plots and interesting characters. They grow and change through the season, no one is 100% good or bad. So far, I'm intrigued and pleased, it's very well written and well-paced.

Kristen Bell shows a wide range of voice accents and dialects and her general acting ability, given her youth, is very good.

I've finished Season 1 and am on Season 2.  This is not a formula show.  Sure, there's an investigation of some kind in each show, but the characters and back story of Veronica, her dad, her friends, boyfriends and the town marches forward, with clarity and reason.  Veronica is the daughter any of us would want -- smart, funny, hard-working, innovative, knows her own mind, grounded.  I find myself totally engaged by questions of what will happen with Veronica's father, with Duncan and Logan, and of course Veronica.  I'll be watching all the seasons, is it 2 or 3?, and then seeing the movie which I understand wraps up some loose ends.  If I could rate it higher I would.",1395705600,,987,4.4636871508379885

I'd seen all the the hype surrounding the Kickstarter movie project, but didn't really feel inclined to revisit the show. Then a week ago, II saw that all three seasons were on Amazon Prime. I had some time to kill and thought I'd just start the pilot. About a week later, my wife and i had binge watched the first season and have begun the second.

The show's not without flaws--lazy writing at times and unbelievable character behavior--but Kristen Bell's performance makes you forget any inconsistencies. She is incredible as Veronica Mars--it's hard to not watch when she's on screen. As a Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan, I can only compare her commitment to the Veronica character to Sarah Michelle Gellar's embodiment of a vampire slayer. For Buffy fans, you know what I'm talking about. Overall, the writing is above average--but the dialog, specifically, is stellar.

2373086,3,B000A59PMO,"First off, let me say I enjoyed the series immensely, saw the whole 3 seasons, movie included.

3 Stars from (to me) lack of rewatchability, once you know the punch line, it loses a lot of it's oomph.  Also, in the movie they went to some trouble to ""reset"" key characters back to their ""roots"" for no other reason than to probably set up for an additional movie.  Found that very disappointing.  (Can't say more on that without really spoiling the whole thing, so I won't.).

What is it?  Well, Veronica Mars is the daughter of one time Sheriff Keith Mars, follows daddy's footsteps in this case, he loses his job as Sheriff and becomes a private investigator, so she does the same (becomes a private investigator.)  All this while in high school.

Her best friend is murdered, Dad accused the most popular rich family in the area and fails to prove it and is kicked out of office.

So, Ronnie is one of most hated people in school (which changes as the series progresses, so you get a really nice character interaction development thing going on.)

Anyone who's had bad memories or needs for funny revenge (think revenge of the nerds) will enjoy this as Veronica catches criminals and solves mysteries (up to and including murder) with extreme competence, a stun gun and a lot of illegal wire tapping.

She's fairly well a sarcastic b*itch and sleeps around a lot, jumping from one boyfriend to the other and back again (repeat and hopefully rinse;  At least between interactions.....).

Anyway, clever plots, differing levels of story arc;  Some are resolved in a single episode, others carry on 2-3, all the while there is generally a major plot line continuing in the background, likely for the full length of the season.

Downside, if you don't buy into the seasons premise... well, you're screwed for the length of the season.

Third season focused a lot on rape for example, which is a sore spot to me, so I didn't click real well with it.

Anyway, definitely worth a look see if you want some fairly well thought out mysteries.

Thinking on it as I write this, I do believe it was the lame way they treated one of my favorite characters in the movie that put me off on this whole thing.

Anyway, enjoy.",1395705600,,2211,4.594387755102041

Kristen Bell is just awesome, and she continues to show that her talent is as vast as her range of acting. Enrico Colantoni is just simply Enrico Colantoni, and excellent actor that you simply love in everything he does (Person of Interest, Flash Point, Galaxy Quest and Just Shoot Me).

Veronica Mars, the character, carries on that dogged detective work into a new century and does a convincing job of it, although she's literally too cool for school.  With the new movie out, and reasonably successful, that gives more credence to this TV series.

There is a strong element of class warfare with the rich kids generally being the bad guys and everyone else (the 99%?) being on the side of the angels.  In addition to the individual cases that are solved during each episode there is a recurring storyline of the murder of Veronica's best friend who also happened to be a member of one of the richest families in town.  Veronica is determined to find out who killed her best friend.  This is mindlessly enjoyable entertainment.  The storylines are contrived and predictable but generally enjoyable to watch.

2373297,5,B000A59PMO,"Episode Four of Season One is playing as I write this review.

The series is enjoyable and it is my opinion that teens, tweens and young adults will find this very entertaining.

My line of work as a YA & Adult programming clerk in a library, gives me a firsthand view of what young people are reading and what interests them. I did research for this review, and found that Veronica Mars was never a book series, but a screenplay.

Veronica Mars shows the protagonist as a strong, beautiful and smart upper high school student. I think YA's will love this because each episode deals with the real-life-adult-strength problems and situations teens and tweens deal with on a daily basis.

The content has been GP-13 to GP-18, a little bit of language - milder than you hear in everyday conversations. There are make-outs and allusions to getting past third base, but so far nothing graphic.

There is a lot of crap-for-entertainment out there geared toward the younger adult / teen population and this is a breath of fresh air. Hopefully this will actually influence teens to solve problems instead of getting caught up in situations that spiral their lives out of control.

Five Stars and Two Thumbs up. This will be wildly successful.",1395446400,,1234,4.769953051643192

2373363,4,B000A59PMO,We had never heard of this show and gave it a try. It turned out to be quite the little entertainment package yes it follows the private eye format of oh so many other shows over the years but it turned out at least for us that the casting and the time spent getting to know the different players allowed us to get to know the show and its snappy and witty writing. Yes this is light entertainment that we seemed to follow all the way into the second season. We love the actor that plays her Dad and liked it for a high school unrealistic hollywood tv series kinda thing...check it out,1395360000,,585,4.185840707964601

Veronica is a modern Nancy Drew, but with the additional challenge of a fall from popularity to outright hatred.  What would crush another teenager only adds to her resolve to survive and thrive high school hell, all the while searching for the truth.

The show has not lost any of it's appeal over the years. Kristen Bell has truly grown into a great actress. The Father/Daughter relationship is one of the best on television. To see how all the characters began again was a joy to watch. I urge everyone out there to check out the first season. You will not be disappointed and will want to move on to the second and third seasons immediately.",1395273600,,558,4.427184466019417

2373453,3,B000A59PMO,"This is a pretty empty drama. It reminds me of Buffy the Vampire slayer without the supernatural stuff. If you can stand to watch a fairly predictable, 7th grade level plot show you will be rewarded with lots of Kristen Bell, because lets face it, that's why most people watch this show. Other than that, don't recommend.",1395273600,2,321,4.649122807017544

After watching the first season I can see why people fell in love with this show. While some episodes mainly follow the mystery-of-the-week template they nonetheless still contribute to the overarching plot line for the season.

Each episode builds on layers of mysteries: who killed Lily Kane, who drugged Veronica at a party, what is Veronica's relationship to the Kanes, where is her mother & why did she leave. The relationship between Veronica & her dad is heartwarming and cleverly written. Characters are richly developed and woven into the storyline. Veronica Mars can be enjoyed by all ages.

Watching it now, because of the kickstarter and all its support, I realize what I missed. It has all the noir/pulp things I love. Beat down in every episode, as one thing gets better another falls apart, twists and turns that make sense and an overall sense of failure for the team even though they succeed in the end. Loving season two and rushing through so I can watch the movie.",1395100800,,519,4.463157894736842

It was fun to watch and very enjoyable, reminding me of my high school days though much more dramatic.  Veronica is wise beyond her high school years and it is fun to see how she solves problems and brings justice around to those who deserve it.  The background murder mystery seems a little bit like Twin Peaks for kids with the family dynamic, the mysterious circumstances, and the flashbacks.

Some of the writing was well done with some smart twists that caught me by surprise but the general tone was a bit immature for my taste. Don't think I'd pay to watch another episode unless I just had to see Ms. Bell again.,1395100800,,332,4.203125

The mysteries each week combined with the long running mystery (who killed Veronica's best friend) and the clever writing all combine to keep it very interesting.  I had heard of Kristen Bell but didn't know who she was.  I have to agree with one article about her that she should have won an Emmy for her performance.

2373651,5,B000A59PMO,I saw all of my Facebook friends talking about the new Veronica Mars movie and how excited they were about it. It sounded good but was told I had to watch the show first because I'd love it and it would let me enjoy the movie more. Thanks to my prime membership I figured I'd give it a shot. I loved the first season. I wish I didn't have to go to work today so I could stay and binge watch the next season. I can't wait to see what the snarky sassy yet still love able Veronica does next.,1395100800,,489,3.9
2373652,3,B000A59PMO,"Without a doubt Kristen Bell carries this show, and with each episodes gets better. She has a real star quality about her, and it's no surprise to see her acting career expand in recent years.

2373654,4,B000A59PMO,Awesome show. I think rich celebrities are depicted well here in fiction at least. This is an engaging show that was cut for stupid reasons. Just like Firefly.,1395014400,,159,4.714285714285714
2373655,5,B000A59PMO,"Definitely light weight in both scripting and acting, but so quirky and witty that it really works.  I'm 40 years out of high school, but I still find the show appealing---it transcends the setting and age group because it's flat out funny and has story lines that, while simple, are not moronic.

I had resisted watching this show for years until I read an article in the newspaper (yes, I still read newspapers---oh the horror) about the new movie.  The TV show sounded a lot like Buffy or Firefly (two shows I enjoyed in the past) and after watching several episodes, I find it in that same spirit, but even better.

Until I get through the first season, my 5 star rating is provisional.  And who knows if season two or three will resonate as well as the first.  I find some of these show (Buffy is a good example) start to run out of ideas after a season or two, and just fall apart.  Maybe that will happen with Veronica Mars, but I hope not.

Until then, I'll keep watching this clever little show, and then maybe I'll catch the movie as well.",1395014400,,1049,4.371134020618556

2373657,5,B000A59PMO,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE Veronica Mars!  I didn't get into it until after the series had been cancelled (much to my dismay).  The writing does a very good job of pulling you in and tugging at your heart strings to make you laugh, cry, cheer, hoot, holler, put your hands over your face saying ""what!?""... and so much more!  1st season is so good!",1395014400,,338,4.25
2373658,4,B000A59PMO,"I had never watched Veronic Mars when it was on TV, but with all the hype surrounding the kickstarter funded movie, I figured I'd give it a shot. At first I was a bit skeptical as it seemed like it was going to be some girlie young teen show. After the first episode, I was hooked. Although there are many high tropes present in the series, the series generally finds a way to poke fun at high school life. The mini-mysteries she solves in each episode often help her uncover further clues in the larger overall mystery. The clues sometimes seem to point to an obvious answer, then you find out you're wrong. Great fun. Highly recommend.",1395014400,,637,4.452991452991453

2373700,5,B000A59PMO,I loved this show while it was on..which was way too short!! I miss it and re-watch the episodes all the time! The wit and humor in this show is fantastic!! Really a great show that shouldn't have been cancelled.,1395014400,,212,4.325
2373701,4,B000A59PMO,"This isn't complex plot or characters, but rather a pleasant getaway.

I (being ""elderly"" almost) wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I have - and I do.
I was surprised and pleased to see the movie (shown at SXSW) was crowd-funded.
I was also not surprised to see the heroine actress, Kristen Bell, is in Showtime's ""House of Lies"" and Disney's ""Frozen"" as well.
Wired describes Veronica Mars as being ""about a super hero"" of sorts, and maybe that about nails it:  an ordinary, you or I could be that kind of superhero.  And Kristen pulls it off well.  Not surprised at the variety of roles she portrays, then.

Watch it.  You'll see pleasing entertainment, and a mid-westerner (Kristen is from Michigan) developing her craft, and her career.

The 4 (not 5) star is for the story line - this full-on adult prefers the complexities of story lines such as ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.""  Nothing at all against this movie, simply that it is not at that level of complex, rich story.",1395014400,,984,4.582857142857143

All through this season, Veronica Mars is trying to discover who killed her best friend Lily Kane, well helping the disenfranchised of Neptune High. Throughout the season there are multiple flashbacks from different people's point of view. Normally, I am pretty good about guessing who the killer is fairly early on, but this show kept me guessing until the end.

But Veronica Mars will not go quietly. Daughter of a fallen sheriff gone PI, she shows she has the knack for investigation herself, along with the tendency to dish out ""just"" desserts. While using the law as more like guidelines, Veronica navigates the world of petty and not so petty crime surrounding her at Neptune, home of the elite and not so elite in Southern California.",1395014400,,549,4.7894736842105265

2373788,5,B000A59PMO,"I don't understand the (sometime) comparisons of Veronica Mars to Nancy Drew. The character of Veronica Mars is funnier, hipper, and has the distinction of Kristen Bell as her lifeline. The entire season blends teen and adult storylines/issues perfectly, adding a healthy dose of sensitivity, but never veers into sentimentality. The supporting cast excels, especially Enrico Colantoni as Daddy-o Mars who is always a joy to watch. He plays a recurring character, Russian mob boss Carl Elias,  on the excellent show Person of Interest. Now I can savor Seasons Two and Three along with the movie.

Recurring roles  include Harry Hamlin, Lisa Rinna, and Amanda Siefried. Later in series Steve Guttenberg, and Ed Begley Jr. join this recurring group.

2373847,4,B000A59PMO,"Before discussion of the new ""Veronica Mars"" movie popped up I had never watched an episode of the early 2000's TV show.  I took the plunge out of curiosity and season one surprised me.  The show is certainly not high brow entertainment.  If you were a Twins Peaks fan this show probably isn't your cup of tea.  Think more along the lines of one of the CSI franchises, though the plots are quirkier and more believable.  Like any CSI episode, however, the plots are predictable, the characters relatively simple, and the resolution of each episode's criminal riddle happens in a brief rush at the end of the show.  Despite that, the show is still entertaining.  Much of that credit goes to Kristin Bell, who plays the lead character with surprising skill.  She manages to ably capture the flavor of the ""wrong side of the track"" kind of girl and her barely suppressed feelings of anger and anguish are believable.  I do keep wondering how the kids of millionaires and billionaires would be in the same school with less financially endowed students.  Most teachers, unfortunately, are simplistic caricatures.  There are some interesting elements of race and class struggle in each show, though again, somewhat on the simple and obvious side.  The final surprise for me is how interesting the show is as a time machine.  Season One takes place in 2004, which seems pretty recent to me, but on the screen I was shocked by how old the show felt.  No smartphones, no tablets, computer technology of a bygone age, old CRT TVs, reminder after reminder of how quickly modern society changes in the digital era.",1394928000,,1602,4.778181818181818

2373849,5,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars is one of the best shows I've ever seen. Season 1 has plenty of sharp dialog, memorable characters, and satisfying mysteries. The season 1 finale may be the single best tv episode I've seen.",1394928000,,204,4.694444444444445
2373850,5,B000A59PMO,Always interesting plot lines and good acting.  Reminded me immediately of the mystery books I read as a child.  I can see why there were enough fans of the show to finance a movie.,1394928000,,181,4.294117647058823

2373872,5,B000A59PMO,"WOW! Bow down and freakin' worship! Veronica Mars' new movie slams it out of the park. Especially enjoyable were performances by Kristin Bell, Enrico Colantoni ,  and Jason Dohring.  ( But a host of well known actors also were very fine) . If you haven't watched the 3 seasons of the television show, I envy you .You have several weeks of pure joy ahead to catch up the story line. Savor it. If you are familiar with it already then you know, good stuff. There isn't much higher praise for a TV show than to have the DVD collection blurbed by the master of suspense Stephen King. Sets , locations, wardrobe, dialogue  ... all first class. Highest recommendation. ( Watch for cameo By Ms. Bell's real life husband.",1394841600,,713,4.5546875

Where all  your friends get decided on how much your parents make.  Let the mystery's untangle thru the web of other mysteries that keep developing.  Good thing veronica has access to her laptop to do the research and clever detective skills to solve them.

2374050,5,B000A59PMO,Rewatching all 3 seasons to refresh in my mind the characters to get ready for the movie.  One of my all time favorite tv shows and was so disappointed when it didn't get renewed.  Great writing and it is fun to watch the actors grow into their characters. I suggest everyone should watch this at least once.,1394582400,,308,4.385964912280702
2374061,5,B000A59PMO,"Very entertaining series, good actors and story line.  A murder invest is the carry over story line through the series, but also smaller stories take place in episodes.  Characters develop throughout the series and a surprise ending.",1394582400,,233,5.27027027027027

2374069,5,B000A59PMO,Great characters.  Nice full season mystery plus individual stories each episode.  Right balance of drama/feel good.  Veronica is a hero which I like.  Love the father/daughter relationship which is so rare in a series.  The Mars family manages lower middle class with style - a much needed message.,1394409600,,299,5.145833333333333

2374082,4,B000A59PMO,"One of the few tv shows that I dip into these days.  Like the characters- Veronica herself (strong and quite the rebel) and her relationship with her father.  Some too-typical teen angst, but worth at least one viewing.  (pick a random episode, but there is an arc storyline that runs through the series).",1394409600,,305,4.716981132075472

2374085,5,B000A59PMO,Very unfortunate Veronica Mars was canceled after the third season. I am looking forward now to see a new movie; however do not hold my breath: after-series movies usually are not that good as an original. In any case I will be glad to see Kristen Bell and other members of the cast again.,1394409600,,289,4.37037037037037
2374086,5,B000A59PMO,"I just got started watching this show and I can't believe I waited this long! I love the concept and Kristen Bell plays the character so well. One thing I learned is Kristen is great with accents! If you've been wondering whether it not to watch it, WATCH IT! Its worth every minute. Can't believe it got canceled after 3 seasons. The best part though is there is a movie therefore we get some more of Veronica's sleuthing. Can't wait for the movie!

2374088,4,B000A59PMO,"I really enjoyed the first season.  The acting is very good and the writing is clever.  It is clear that the goal was to entertain and it  definitely met that goal for me.  I liked that each episode stood on its own with a separate story while there was also an on-going story line through the whole season.  It ain't Shakespeare, but it wasn't suppose to be.",1394409600,,359,4.298507462686567

2374132,5,B000A59PMO,Veronica Mars is well-written and reminds me of a 1940's film noir. The lines and the plot go by fast and you have to pay attention. Veronica Mars is a modern day Nancy Drew.,1394323200,,174,4.147058823529412

It was okay. I will probably not watch more unless I really need something to take my mind off my life and just zone out for awhile. Like I said, it was okay, well done, just not fully my cup of tea.",1394150400,,365,3.945945945945946

I was delighted to find this available through Amazon Prime and it has quickly become one of our favorites.  Good group of people that are all multi-dimensionall.  Show has lots of humor and drama.

2374230,4,B000A59PMO,"Seems this television favorite has been hard to find. On personal experience, it was available at seeming outrageous prices at local stores (even used!), so I opted to order through Amazon (through another vendor but was fulfilled by Amazon , ie: I got the Prime rates). Reasonably priced and was delivered on time. However, I'm disappointed by the packaging which wasn't the book fold out as shown on the page's images. Instead, it's an m-lock DVD box that stacks all six discs on top of each other. Only one secure lock to hold ALL six discs which, again, are stacked on top of each other. Horrible, horrible choice of packaging. I'm just glad none of the discs were scratched but I've now resorted to using separate CD jewel cases to preserve this otherwise great TV show. To anyone wanting to buy any season of Veronica Mars, check to see what type of box type is used as there are two: one, the preferable (and more DVD-friendly) book fold out style as seen on the Amazon page (which also looks way more colorful and detailed); the other is this cheap m-lock packaging that lacks the colorfulness and detail (save for an insert that briefly describes each episode) and stacks all six DVDs on top of each other that greatly increases the risk of disc damage.",1393977600,,1262,4.638392857142857

2374266,5,B000A59PMO,The world is made up of two kinds of people: those who love Veronica Mars and those who don't. If you are the former then this is worth watching. The production in the early parts is pretty cheesy but the acting and writing is very good.

  I'll admit that I was a Nancy Drew fan as a young girl, but I wish Nancy was a bit more kick-ass like Veronica is!  Veronica is a great example of tenacity, empathy, and smarts.

2374435,5,B000A59PMO,"My husband and I happened upon this series and were curious due to all the attention in the media for the movie Kickstarter campaign.  Thank goodness we gave it a try.  We loved this show.  Like, I am a fangirl in a way I have never been for a show before.  Like, we put our baby to bed 30 min early for two weeks so we could make it through 3 episodes a night.  It is so much fun.  Here's a little bit about us to help give some context and decide if this show is for you:

-We are 30.
- We (well, really my husband) is a television snob, and scoffs at anything that ever appeared on the CW, assuming it is teenage trash. I had to omit the fact it was on UPN/CW to get him to watch the first couple episodes.  Afterwards he was hooked and didn't care.
- Said snobby husband also scoffs at anything in the crime tv genre - hates CSI, NCIS, etc
- In the past, our favorite shows that we could agree on have been:
  -Arrested Development
  -The Wire
  -Freaks and Geeks
  -Sherlock
  -Misfits

So why was Veronica such a hit?  Well, for me personally, I love detective stories, and I love strong female leads, so odds were already in its favor.  But here's some other factors that I think made us fall for it:

-Moral grey areas: This show lives for the morally ambiguous stories and characters that make you think. Like life, right and wrong is often subjective, and it is highly entertaining/identifiable to watch characters navigate this.

-Deeply flawed leads: Also like life, the good guy sometimes acts poorly and vice versa.  This makes them realistic and relatable.

-Witty, quick, fun writing: Veronica and her friends have all the sass and quick come-backs that you always wish you could have come up with, but only think of after the moment has passed.

-Doesn't take itself too seriously: While the subject matter is definitely dark and serious (rapes, murders, child abuse, incest) there is a campy tone to the show that keeps it from being too heavy or depressing.  It's a fine balance between campy humor and realistic noir that they manage beautifully. Don't go in expecting The Wire. It was on the CW, after all, not HBO.  I never went to bed with nightmares. Mostly this show is FUN and satisfying in the way a good paperback mystery is.

-Good acting: The actors that play Veronica, Keith, Logan and Weevil in particular put in some very strong performances, conveying with a look what would have required lines of dialogue otherwise.

-Romance: Okay, this is mostly me, but I got totally caught up in the romantic tensions of Veronica's love life. :)

-Makes you think: This show isn't written for the lowest common denominator.  It doesn't talk down to its audience.  It addresses real issues of social class, gender, and race in a way that generates deep thoughts and discussion",1393545600,,2798,4.520958083832335
2374436,4,B000A59PMO,"I love this t.v. series, and I love having it on DVD. I do not love the way the DVDs are stacked in the box.

I'm confused why it only ran for 3 seasons because this show is smart, funny, sexy, exciting and everything you would hope for. It is like 90210 but less cheesy and overly dramatic.

The slang and clothing is already dated for those years.  Even today, the slang is dated.  This is in no way a negative.  Cliff hanger is the way each season ends.

2374477,5,B000A59PMO,"I watched this on Amazon Prime, TV bingeing through the entire 3 seasons. More adult than Nancy Drew, Veronica Mars is a girl/young woman detective series set in a public high school set in Neptune, a wealthy southern California town. The main character, Veronica, is driven, inquisitive, and bright. She works for her dad, the former sheriff turned private detective. Teen drama, emancipated high-rolling minors... crazy parents..Haves vs. Have-Nots. Not for young children but definitely a fun ride. I especially enjoyed seasons 1 and 2 where multiple stories ran simultaneously through the season and took place . The long running plots had a bit more depth and tied the shows together with cliff-hangers. Season 3 took place in college with most of the characters staying in town to attend Hearst College.  I look forward to seeing the movie coming out next month!!",1393459200,,869,5.119718309859155

The keys to the greatness of this show: the excellent writing & directing as well as Veronica Mars herself --  the ever-endearing Kristen Bell -- along with the super-cast.

The show starts with a little bit of a Twin Peaks vibe. It doesn't keep that up, but it's a neat kind of homage. From there, it turns into a relatively standard case-of-the-day procedural, but with enough fresh stuff to keep you watching. The season wraps up pretty excellently, with a return to the aesthetic of the first episodes. Gives enough closure to satisfy you, but still leaves you rushing to Season 2.",1393459200,,499,4.555555555555555

Every episode leaves you with a clip hanger making you wanting to know what is happening next. The writers of this show should be commended, and Kristen Bell is such a good actress and is adorable. Love it!",1393372800,,326,3.9545454545454546

2374555,4,B000A59PMO,"Love Verinica amd her witty responses to life's issues.  She definitely makes lemonade from things that would put most kids on drugs or in therap, and the writing is intelligent, as well.  It might take place in high school, but the script is very grown up.",1393372800,,257,4.565217391304348

2374557,5,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars is a student at Neptune High School.  Her father is a former sheriff of Neptune who was recalled, and now works as a private detective.  Veronica has natural crime solving skills and puts them to good use helping her fellow students.  A major theme running through the first season is who killed Veronica's best friend, Lilly Kane.  The dialogue is crisp and clever.  The actors are believable as high school students.  Kristen Bell as Veronica provides a strong focus to the show, although sometimes I thought she was too smart and too mature to be a high school junior.  Bell was 24 at the time this series was filmed.  I thoroughly enjoyed this show and had to restrain myself from watched all the episodes in one marathon weekend.",1393372800,,748,4.7

2374559,5,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars will always be one of my top 10 favorite TV shows. The writing and acting are both superb, and the story lines are intelligent, noir, and dramatic without going over the top or failing to be relatable. If you are looking for a new TV show to binge watch, I highly suggest this one!",1393372800,,295,4.285714285714286

It does a sort of cliff hanger ending for each show that I found a little annoying, but I've watched two seasons in a little more than a week, so the ploy works.",1393372800,,296,4.068965517241379

2374582,5,B000A59PMO,"Dont judge a book by its cover is the motto of truth here. For years i never saw the appeal and always wondereed why people liked Veronica Mars. Thought it was some teeny bopper show blah blah blah drama or whatever. Then the Veronica Mars movie was Kickstarted entirely by fans with millions of dollars so i became intrigued. First episode was intrigiuing especially at the end. By 2nd episode i was hooked on the show and by the third episode i was SLAVERING for the next one. I simply couldn't get enough and went on a Veronica Mars marathon. There is numerous plots thats are both witty and intruiging with also an overarching plpot that has a nice you're not going to see it twist. Kristen Bell i always thought was just some really hot looking girl when i first saw her in the Heroes show. She wasn't really a huge actress i thought not bad , but not memorable. Then after watching Veronica Mars; i easily know shes a A-list Top actress. Also the best yet is the ensemble of characters in the show which makes you want to see how the investigations and Private Investigations work out. Also no two shows are alike ever, and best of all there is not one filler episode yet. Just pure great Veronica Mars!!!",1393372800,,1211,4.434977578475336

You'll enjoy it but if you're like me it will probably get annoying that you have to constantly suspend disbelief as Veronica gets away with breaking/entering, burglary, impersonating law enforcement and blackmail without getting caught.",1393372800,,400,5.333333333333333

It was filmed so nicely with such a small crap budget.  The acting was good.  Kristen Bell and the other main characters were just perfect together.  Everything just worked.  I liked the Nancy Drew type of drama because it wasn't vampires, CSI, or some other regular show we see over and over.",1393286400,,459,4.457831325301205

My first reaction? This show is intense. It is not a light hearted drama and tackles some seriously twisted issues. And that's what makes it great. Plots interweave nicely and the season finale hits you like a truck but at the same time doesn't feel like it was tacked on. This first season is literally one of my favorites of any show ever.",1393286400,,502,4.294736842105263

She solves mysteries. She keeps her dignity with sarcastic slap-downs. She has a great relationship with her dad, but still behave like a teen (hides a lot of things from him).

2374801,5,B000A59PMO,I can't get enough of Kristen Bell. She's actually a very talented actress and is such a tease! Can't wait for the movie.,1392940800,,121,4.304347826086956
2374802,5,B000A59PMO,"Our teenagers convinced us to watch this with them. It's a clever, funny, well-written show. We're binge watching.  Can't imagine why it was canceled so prematurely.",1392854400,,165,5.346153846153846
2374803,5,B000A59PMO,Veronica and crew are at their best when given a truly complex collection of assignments.  They back and forth of Veronica and well the whole cast is pure gold.  Loved this show when it was on TV.  Loved watching the series streaming from Amazon.  CAN'T WAIT for the movie.,1392854400,,273,4.510204081632653
2374804,5,B000A59PMO,"I own all the seasons but am so excited its available on Prime. One of the first shows to have a strong female character and she doesn't apologize for it. Veronica Mars is smart, witty, brave and a big marshmallow! Season 1 follows her as she embraces a new life and deals with the murder of her best friend, Lily. Watch it, you won't be sorry.",1392854400,,344,4.2272727272727275
2374805,5,B000A59PMO,"As a 40 year old man I had no expectations for this series despite raves from many friends.  I was really wrong.  The series is smarty, funny, and has as its star, one of the most beguiling, cute, smart and seemingly real teenage character I've ever come across.  I'm going to be very sad when I finish the series. And the central mystery is great.  It keeps shifting just when you think you know where it's going.  Do yourself a favor and watch this series.",1392854400,,458,4.341176470588235
2374806,5,B000A59PMO,"So I was not a Veronica Mars watcher when it was on TV, but when a friend insisted that I watch it so I can go see the movie with her, I agreed to watch.  Best decision ever.  Okay, that may be a little dramatic, but in all seriousness, the show is great!  I watched half of the first season in one day because I couldn't stop watching.  Can't wait to see how the next 2 seasons go.",1392854400,,382,3.858974358974359
2374807,5,B000A59PMO,"What's not to like?  Fun, funny, cute, good scripts, good acting, and Kristen Bell is the best.  I'm excited about the March 14 movie release!",1392854400,,142,4.64
2374808,5,B000A59PMO,It was really fun to watch a show that was on when I was in high school and see it from an adult perspective.,1392854400,,109,3.5833333333333335
2374819,5,B000A59PMO,This show is well written and intriguing to all ages. Highly recommended for all Amazon Prime members. Do yourself a favor and watch it now!,1392854400,,140,4.64
2374820,5,B000A59PMO,"This is one of my favorite shows. The relationship dynamics are priceless. I don't know what it is, but I have rewatched multiple times at varying ages and enjoy it just as much every time!",1392854400,,189,4.428571428571429
2374821,5,B000A59PMO,"This is a smart, snarky, extremely well written show.  The mystery covered in this season is meticulously laid out and detailed.  It is clear that the writers knew from the outset where they were going.  I'm re-watching this now, having watched the show several times, and am glad to find it available on Amazon prime.",1392854400,,318,4.745454545454545
2374822,5,B000A59PMO,Rewatching the entire series before the movie comes out.  Season 1 is arguably the best.  This show is the bomb dot com.,1392854400,,120,4.409090909090909
2374823,5,B000A59PMO,"You'll lose productivity and sleep until you finish the entire series. Love Kristen Bell, Jason Dohring, and Veronica Mars! Looking forward to the movie.",1392854400,,153,5.416666666666667
2374824,5,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars season one was a great show.  She's a ittle detective at a big high school with bullies, snobs and freaks....",1392854400,,123,4.590909090909091
2374825,5,B000A59PMO,"It is so much better than you could imagine! It took me a long time to finally give it a try, but it is in my top 5 shows of all time!",1392854400,,134,3.21875
2374826,5,B000A59PMO,I never watched it when it was actually on but discovered it recently and I love it!! What a talent Kristen Bell and the rest of the cast are!!,1392854400,,143,3.9655172413793105
2374827,5,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars is not what you would expect. VM is a show that I overlooked in the past because I thought it was a teeny-bopper show when it ran live. I was always into a good conspiracy show (see X-Files), but I have always avoided lame procedurals. VM is sort of both genres, but played with an aescerbic wit and loose acting that makes you come back just for the personalities alone.

I can see now why Kristen Bell was a breakout. She was asked not only to play younger, but to play older and wiser to the other cast members. There are very adult themes in the show that would play today just as well as 10 years ago. I thought it was a bit racy even for 10 years ago on prime time network TV. There is a cable edge to the storylines, the drama, and the humor.

Best thing I can say about this show is that you care about virtually every character and root for the good guys. I loved season 1 and can't wait to dig into the rest of the show.",1392854400,,944,4.042780748663102
2374828,5,B000A59PMO,"This show is well written, has great acting, and a great storyline. I couldn't stop watching it! If you like mystery you'll love this!",1392854400,,134,4.625
2374849,5,B000A59PMO,Best show ever. This season is the best of all. Introduces us to memorable characters and each episode leaves you wanting more. How can one watch and not turn instantly into a soft Marshmallow? Rewatching series for a second time to get ready for the movie and have found much that I missed the first time. Now that's great television!,1392854400,,335,4.6
2374850,5,B000A59PMO,"This show holds up.  It's still smart, sassy, class- and race-concious.  The characters develop deeply and organically, showing more than one good redemption story.  Perhaps the greatest strength of the show is how three-dimensional and true to life the characters are, allowing our beloved Veronica and Keith to have real flaws, and even the obligatory psychotic jackass that is Logan to become sympathetic.  This show is great for anyone who likes to think, enjoys pop culture references or ever felt like an outsider, but it's particularly good at showing adolescent girls how to brave high school and beyond without letting the haters get you down.",1392768000,,652,5.180952380952381
2374851,4,B000A59PMO,This tv show has great story lines and plot complications. I thoroughly love watching the episodes and seeing the characters develop over time.,1392768000,,143,5.260869565217392
2374852,5,B000A59PMO,"This show is truly one of the best.  I watched it years ago, and now I am re-watching it with my fiance.  I cannot wait for the movie to come out!",1392768000,,146,3.6774193548387095
2374853,5,B000A59PMO,"This is the perfect time, for fans, to relive the series in preparation for the big screen movie coming out this Spring.",1392768000,,120,4.5
2374854,5,B000A59PMO,"Totally underrated in its time. It's got it all: teen angst, love triangles, bad boys, badass girls! Go Veronica, Go!",1392768000,,117,4.9
2374855,5,B000A59PMO,"Re-watching the first season before the movie is such a treat. The wit in the dialogue, the development of complex characters and their even more complex relationships with one another, along with the quality of the individual and overarching plot remind me of everything I loved about the series in the first place.",1392768000,,316,4.981132075471698
2374856,5,B000A59PMO,"Good actors and story lines are interesting.  Not sure how believable  a high school PI is, but it's fun never the less.",1392768000,,120,4.409090909090909
2374857,4,B000A59PMO,"For a teenage show it has less emotional drama ( dramatic acting).
Not typically my type of show.  Watching has intrigued me to consider seeing
the movie when it comes out.",1392768000,,172,4.548387096774194
2374858,5,B000A59PMO,Love this show. Perfect blend of who summit and high school drama but done in a witty manner - clearly created by someone raised in the eighties.,1392768000,,145,4.407407407407407
2374869,4,B000A59PMO,"This is an interesting TV series! Reminded me of. Nancy Drew, girl detective who was in a 90210 teeny bopper show. But on the other hand, it kept my interest and kept me wanting to watch the next show. Over all, I liked it.",1392768000,,223,4.090909090909091
2374870,5,B000A59PMO,It's a fun show to watch. It keeps you intrigued as to what will happen next. I recommend it!! !,1392768000,,96,3.85
2374871,4,B000A59PMO,"i love this show - veronica is strong, smart, funny and vulnerable.  she's basically a good girl - even though she disobeys her father quite often, she is always thinking of the greater good.  there is a big mystery that spans all of the shows (so far), plus short mysteries that get solved within each show.
the only disappointment is the video quality (at least in season 1) is not good.",1392768000,,389,4.464788732394366
2374872,5,B000A59PMO,Should have watched this show sooner...soooo good! Glad being made into a movie. Can't wait to finish series. Greatness at work.,1392768000,,128,5.142857142857143
2374873,2,B000A59PMO,I would recommend this to someone much younger.  It was cute. I think teen aged girls might enjoy watching it.,1392681600,,110,4.5
2374874,5,B000A59PMO,Great show - great lessons of how friendships moved on so quickly and truly only keep a few you can always count on.,1392681600,,116,4.086956521739131
2374875,4,B000A59PMO,"The writers were clever with plot, story and dialogue.  In other words, ""they had talent"".  The actors made the characters believable and exciting.  The show is simply just fun to watch.",1392681600,,186,4.935483870967742
2374876,5,B000A59PMO,"VM as a whole was an amazing series, but the first season was truly spectacular. Not your typical CW/coming of age show, trust me. It was like Nancy Drew/Buffy/Noir Detective movies on steroids. Intricate plots, great mysteries, serious wit, class issues, epic romance, and a star-making performance from Kristen Bell. Couldn't recommend this more. Better watch it on Amazon for free while you still can ;)",1392681600,,406,5.166666666666667
2374877,5,B000A59PMO,Good development of characters. Interesting multi-level plots in each episode. Good acting (for the main characters). I like seeing the underdogs win.,1392681600,,150,5.863636363636363
2374878,5,B000A59PMO,I love this show and am glad that it is on prime. it is well written . the characters are well rounded . Do yourself a favor watch this show,1392681600,,140,3.7
2374899,5,B000A59PMO,Watched Veronica Mars when it first came out and loved it.  Watching it again (in preparation for the V Mars movie) and it's just as good as we remembered it.,1392681600,,158,4.266666666666667
2374900,5,B000A59PMO,"I'm a huge fan of Rob Thomas in general, but the Veronica Mars series is fantastic - very entertaining, clever dialogue, well-drawn characters that pull you in, episodic fun but two season-long mysteries . . . what else could you ask for?",1392681600,,238,4.690476190476191
2374901,5,B000A59PMO,Love Kristen bell!!  She's so entertaining to watch. Cannot believe I've never watched this before. It's worth the time.  Thumbs up,1392681600,,131,5.190476190476191
2374902,5,B000A59PMO,"The things I like best about this series are (1) that it always a new mystery. (2) there is a thread of background mysteries and (3) the characters have many sides.  One week you can hate someone and the next week you feel empathy for them and their situation.

I definitely recommend this series.",1392681600,,297,4.481481481481482
2374903,5,B000A59PMO,"I'm rewatching before the movie comes out March 14! best show ever. If you want to see the movie, definitely try to watch the show first.",1392681600,,137,4.3076923076923075
2374904,4,B000A59PMO,"I never would have guessed I would watch this series, but this season hooked me.  The show has a plot per episode (approx) and a secondary plot spanning the whole season.  Being targeted to a younger crowd I didn't think it would hold my interest, but the season long plot got quite interesting and had some really unexpected twists that basically hooked me and reeled me in.  Surprisingly entertaining.",1392681600,,403,4.811594202898551
2374905,5,B000A59PMO,"I didn't watch it back in 2005, but it has decent fun story lines, worth watching series without commercials. Recommend watching when nothing else is on TV.",1392681600,,156,4.814814814814815
2374906,5,B000A59PMO,"Kristen Bell is truly outstanding, and the writing makes the best of her talents and her exceptional wit. This is a must-see.",1392681600,,125,4.7272727272727275
2374907,5,B000A59PMO,"Okay, I didn't loose ten lbs but it was a great show anyway. I think ""high school"" and I cringe, but this did a really good balance between that and the case-solving. Great characters, very addicting, binged on all three seasons one after the other! Can't wait for the Veronica Mars movie this March.",1392681600,,300,4.574074074074074
2374908,5,B000A59PMO,"Smart, quick, witty fun.  My favorite.  Can't wait for the movie to come out.  Show ended without closure in season 3.",1392681600,,118,4.523809523809524
2374929,5,B000A59PMO,Veronica Mars is a fun show to watch and the scripts are witty. It is like a modern day Nancy Drew. I really enjoyed it.,1392681600,,120,3.84
2374930,5,B000A59PMO,I love this show!  I miss it terribly.  Good plots and well written characters.  I wish they would have moved past three seasons!,1392681600,,129,4.521739130434782
2374931,4,B000A59PMO,"I never watched Veronica Mars when it was on actual TV.  Back in the days before DVRs and digital cable, it just wasn't possible.  I originally watched it via Netflix and the USPS.  Now, in 2014, a month before the film opens, I am watching it again via Amazon streaming.  It's a joy.

The thing that really amazes me is that, for a show that is 10 years old and that aired on a tiny network, this show does not feel dated.  OK, sure the flip phones are dated but the storylines feel current.  Even the clothes don't feel that out of date to me. SO check it out.  It's a good show and it's fun to see some of your favorite actors of today when they were babies.",1392681600,,661,4.069767441860465
2374932,5,B000A59PMO,This series is fun and I really enjoyed it! So much better than my high school years! On to season 2,1392681600,,100,3.8095238095238093
2374933,5,B000A59PMO,I saw the complete series of this show once already and couldn't stop myself from starting over again when it showed up on Prime. Love it.,1392681600,,138,4.346153846153846
2374934,5,B000A59PMO,This is so great!  Hoping season 2 is just as good. The movie comes out in March. Everyone should watch this show.,1392681600,,114,4.181818181818182
2374935,5,B000A59PMO,"Well done high school setting, interesting and ongoing plot, with minor stories interjected. Kristen Bell, from Detroit, does a suburb job of entertaining.",1392681600,,155,5.782608695652174
2374936,5,B000A59PMO,This is so entertaining! The twists and turns keep it going! Awesome! I can not wait to watch season 2!!,1392681600,,104,4.25
2374937,5,B000A59PMO,I never realized until recently that I only saw the end of the Veronica Mars series and not the beginning. I was so excited to watch Season One and realize I have so much more of the Mars Universe to explore! Can't wait for the movie next month and am enjoying binge watching Veronica more than I can say!,1392681600,,305,4.186440677966102
2374938,5,B000A59PMO,"I missed it when it was on TV, and I'm glad I get a second chance to watch it.  My friends were telling me how good it is, and they were so right.  Excellent show.  I just wish it went on and on and on...",1392681600,,204,3.488888888888889
2374959,5,B000A59PMO,I don't know how I missed this series when it was originally on tv but I wish I hadn't! Plus I watched it just in time for the movie to come out. It's greatfor everyone. My husband didn't want to like it but got hooked too.,1392681600,,223,3.869565217391304
2374960,5,B000A59PMO,"Love the show and great to see it on Prime!!!!!  Can't wait for the movie.  Kristen Bell does an excellent job, story line is intriguing.  Bring on more shows like this one.",1392681600,,173,4.34375
2374961,5,B000A59PMO,Excellent show! Keeps you on your toes the whole time. Veronica is such a compelling character. You never know what she is going to do next.,1392681600,,140,4.423076923076923
2374962,5,B000A59PMO,"I was wondering what all the hype was with this tv show. I found out quickly - smart, funny and definitely something you can binge watch!",1392681600,,137,4.3076923076923075
2374963,1,B000A59PMO,I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.  LET'S GET BACK TO REALISM AND STOP SHOWING ALL THIS GARBAGE ESPECIALLY TO CHILDREN.,1392681600,2,129,5.142857142857143
2374964,5,B000A59PMO,I love this show & I hate that it got taken off out the blue what a rip off people,1392681600,,82,3.15
2374965,5,B000A59PMO,Great story will acted well written and will produced. Hi suspense and keeps you on the edge of your seat.,1392681600,,106,4.35

2374967,5,B000A59PMO,The show is 10 years old but still feels fresh- my husband and I are watching it for the first time and really enjoying it.,1392595200,,123,3.96
2374968,3,B000A59PMO,This program is cute but not that interesting.  Glad I took the opportunity to see a few episodes but probably won 't be watching any more.,1392595200,,139,4.346153846153846
2374979,5,B000A59PMO,"I was hesitant to begin watching Veronica Mars because I tried it one before.  Of course, I was crazy busy the first time around.  The show is so well written, it's sad that it was cancelled after only 3 seasons.  Most great shows are.  Kristen Bell slays it as an intelligent, sarcastic teenager.  I wish I had a pal like her back in high school.  I cannot wait for the movie in 2014!",1392595200,,385,4.205479452054795
2374980,5,B000A59PMO,"I fell in love with this series when it aired on TV. I have been hoping to find it on Netflix, but decided I wanted to own the entire series anyways. I'm so glad I purchased each season!",1392595200,,186,3.9210526315789473

2374982,5,B000A59PMO,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of Veronica Mars. I expected a teen show in the mold of 90210. Instead, Veronica Mars is a first rate detective show comparing favorably with ""adult"" shows like Monk. The title character is wonderful and engaging. The show does an excellent job of balancing the season long mystery of who killed Lily Cane, which is the basis for the Mars' family status as outcasts, with the mystery of the week that Veronica must solve. The superb acting of the entire cast makes each episode a treat. I inhaled the first season in two and a half weeks. I highly recommend giving the show a chance despite it's teen centric labeling. Also, while I have no teenaged children, I would image that this would be a good show to watch together.",1392595200,,765,4.591240875912408
2374983,5,B000A59PMO,This show matches its emphasis on serious societal issues of class and violence with a sense of wit and humor that makes the senselessness of these things palatable and convicting for awareness and activism.,1392595200,,207,5.117647058823529
2374984,5,B000A59PMO,I love this series.  I was sad to find out it ended after 3 seasons!  But I enjoy the 3 and cannot wait for the movie in March!,1392595200,,127,3.5
2374985,4,B000A59PMO,Good teen show although I see why it didn't make it past 3 seasons. Eventually they try too hard and everything is repetitive teen crap.,1392595200,,136,4.48
2374986,5,B000A59PMO,"Stellar writing, acting (particularly from the core group, and aside from a few random stunt casting folks like Paris Hilton), tone, and story make this show one of the best ever, in my book. Kristen Bell is always great, but truly shines in this role. After several viewings, I'm still awed by the plotting and the way the ""mysteries of the week"" dovetail with the season-long search for the truth about the murder of Veronica's best friend, Lilly Kane. Excellent viewing, even a decade later.",1392595200,,494,4.823529411764706
2374987,5,B000A59PMO,"Smart, energetic and strong. Veronica Mars is a great role model.  Although an outcast she has a talent even they need.  Veronica faces adversity that would have others cowering in their rooms.",1392595200,,193,5.0
2374988,5,B000A59PMO,"I watched this series when it was on television.  I am rewatching it before seeing the movie.  Veronica Mars is witty and sarcastic.

2375002,2,B000A59PMO,I don't think it's that great - the story line drags and is overall pretentious of itself.  It's just meh.,1392508800,,106,4.3
2375003,5,B000A59PMO,Compelling story line with witty dialog. Fans of Gilmore Girls will enjoy the fast paced exchanges and pop culture references but the dialog has more sass. And like Law & Order each episode had a mystery to solve and builds the main story line.,1392508800,,244,4.568181818181818

Sometimes you go back to watch an older show that you loved and it's so disappointing. Either the writing isn't as good as you remember, the acting is cheesy or the music and references are outdated. But the VM series is still as fresh as ever. Witty, clever, heartwarming and intriguing all at the same time. If you haven't seen it yet you're really missing out and if you have seen it, watch it again with fresh eyes. There are so many layers of greatness that you likely missed the first time around.

My wife and I have watched all three seasons several times. We were struck by the quality of the writing, storyline, and acting. The 'chemistry' between the characters is truly remarkable and the characters are believable and 'relate-able'. Veronica Mars is far from the typical high schooler, and the series is far from the typical teen years storyline. If you take my recommend on this one, be prepared to hang on for a fun and twisty ride.",1392249600,,618,4.839622641509434

I did watch Twilight while visiting my 45 plus year old son over the holidays. (not my choice) It was a well done production and to me the story line was stupid..
 Veronica Mars has a good mystery story line for each segment with a thread of believable personal relationships connecting one with the other and by the star ratings others have thought so as well. WHY only three seasons. The bachelor has been going on forever with two stars see what I mean?",1392249600,,618,4.558558558558558

2375129,5,B000A59PMO,"This is my favorite season of this show, which, of course, makes sense since the central conceit of the show (Who Killed Lily Kane?) was solved at the end. Unfortunately, the subsequent seasons never quite lived up to the promise of this one - that said, I can't wait for the movie. This first season alone is the main reason. Veronica was smart, spunky, and even when she was wrong, she would go out of her way to try to make it up to the person she wronged. She was a very strong character and I've missed her on my television since the show was canceled. Plus, she had a great supporting cast - her too-cool-for-words father, Keith; her best friend, Wallace; her hot and cold ex boyfriend, Duncan, who made it impossible to hate him; the misunderstood rich bad boy, Logan; and the flip side of that same coin, the misunderstood poor bad boy, biker Weevil. These characters were all excellent examples of the gradient nature of ""good"" and ""bad"". You couldn't entirely hate any of them.  Unfortunately, the later seasons couldn't quite find room for many of these characters and some were written out or turned into caricatures. But we still have season 1 and it doesn't get much better than this.",1392249600,,1198,4.598130841121495

2375160,5,B000A59PMO,"A good friend and I were discussing TV shows a few years back... and VM came up. I had never seen a minute of it... and had no idea what any of the show was about.

She was floored... given my other likes, she said it was perfect for me... that I would dig the hell out of it.
I stayed away from it at the time... because I had it in my head that it was a dumb tweener show. I was into Buffy and Supernatural... I had no time for this fluff!

I have never been so glad to be wrong. I only wish I had listened to her when she first pushed it on me a few years ago.

I watched the first episode very tentatively... by the end, I was devouring the show. I marathon'd the first season in a matter of 3 days. I couldn't get enough...

The characters are well developed, the relationships are complex and well though out... and even though it's episodal, the stary arc that carries the season is riveting and will keep you on the edge of your seat trying to figure out the twists and turns.

Watch it. If you like strong female leads... Watch it. If you like well-woven conspiracies... Watch it! If you want to know who actually spiked the drink... Watch it!  Then make sure you free up enough time to carry on to season 2.",1392249600,,1217,4.05
2375161,4,B000A59PMO,"You could summarize Veronica Mars as the story of a high school girl who helps her classmates using her skills as a PI - but to do so would completely miss the things that make this show great.

Veronica, who was once friends with the wealthy ""cool"" kids at school becomes an outcast after her best friend is murdered and her father (the town sheriff) accuses the girl's billionaire father of killing her.  Instead of beginning with the murder, this show wisely starts almost a year later, showing how all of her relationships have changed in the aftermath and how she herself has been changed by that.  That poignancy, along with a well-honed sarcastic wit, make Veronica far more than a modern Nancy Drew.

But this show doesn't stop with great characters.  The high school setting is not only more realistic than most portrayals of high school, but also illustrate issues of class conflict in modern American society.  Veronica's high school isn't about jocks versus geeks; instead, it's about the wealthy ""O Niners"" versus the lower middle class and poor kids.  The theme of rich versus poor and all that means in our society continues through the whole show but doesn't descend to being preachy.

If you are a fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, you'll find Veronica Mars to be worth the time to watch.",1392163200,,1304,4.738938053097345

2375164,4,B000A59PMO,Once I started watching I couldn't stop.  Having a story line that resolves itself on the last episode can be risky.

It's also refreshing to see a show that isn't afraid to keep a fast pace in terms of major storylines. Love this show!",1392076800,,286,4.125
2375209,5,B000A59PMO,"Funny, witty, clever, irreverent -- four of my favorite TV show characteristics. The mini-plots and overarching plot are not like OMG I'm -on-the-edge-of-my-seat-brilliant and suspenseful or anything, but they're certainly intriguing enough to keep one's attention. The main great thing about this show is the characters. I often find myself laughing out loud at Veronica's clever quips, but there's also enough depth and pathos to her character that I do feel moved when I'm supposed to feel moved. The villains are pretty great, too, particularly the young semi-sociopath Logan Echolls. He's the kind of d-bag you love to hate (and occasionally feel sorry for.) If not every episode is a home run, there are enough of them throughout the seasons to earn this cult fave five stars. Can't wait for the movie to come out in March 2014!",1392076800,,834,5.050724637681159

Veronica Mars is about a girl who's father is an ex-wife chief and current PI. Veronica follows in her father's footsteps and solves mysteries that come along all while being shunned by the people she goes to high school with...

I am sorry it only lasted three seasons, but I can't wait to see the movie that comes out this year. This is Kristen Bell at her BEST.",1392076800,,432,4.345679012345679
2375212,5,B000A59PMO,"This is the second time I watched Veronica Mars, and it is still excellent (in my opinion). But, I advise (Amazon) against asking people to rate either music, movies, books, or TV shows. Everyone has different opinions on such things and giving my personal opinion on such items is really a waste of time. I believe rating a product, such as a lawn mower, tool, chair, etc. much more valuable.",1392076800,,393,4.628571428571429

2375432,3,B000A59PMO,"The name of my review, ""Nancy Drew on Steroids"", refers to the Nancy Drew Mystery books that were popular in the 50's for girls from age 10 to 12.  In my opinion the Veroica Mars stories are not for young teens because there is a generous dose of sex and sex related issues in these episodes. That being said, Veronica Mars, the daughter of a private investigator in a rich California town, that is full of spoiled kids,  is very talented at solving crimes both for adults and her high school and college friends.  The stories are good enough to keep me wanting to go on to the next show in the series and then to the next season.  There isn't great depth in these stories but for a night when I can't sleep or just want to kill some time, it's entertaining.",1391472000,,758,4.27972027972028

2375451,5,B000A59PMO,"I never watched it when the series was on TV, but I am so glad I discovered it. The writing and acting were excellent. The plot was very interesting and the characters engaging. I liked the way they showed Veronica as human, a girl who makes mistakes and doesn't always win. OTOH her fierce independence, determination to fight injustice and refusing to join any particular social clique made me like the show even more.

Sharp writing, clever plotting for each show and the season-long arc and engaging actors make it one of the most addictive shows I've ever binged on. Frankly, I had never heard of Veronica Mars until it popped up on Amazon Prime, but close to 10 years after it first premiered, I'm hooked. I've been reading everything I can find on this series and its history and background, and I'm so disappointed that it never really found an audience, until after the fact. Now it's something of a cult favorite and fund for a movie that's supposed to come out was crowd-sourced. How cool is that?
Completely original and wonderfully paced, Veronica Mars is about as good as television gets. Check it out.",1391472000,,870,4.6558441558441555

I really love the father daughter relationship between Veronica and her dad Keith Mars and how they work together as a team in their PI business. Highly recommended.

Was it too honest in the story lines? I am not a child. I am a person who is a mother and a grand-mother. i have seen many series come and go. I have seen many series that should have been gone long ago hang on with their cheap sex and drunken drug addled story lines. This series covers everything teenagers are encountering every day. To attach it to politics and a small town detective agency was great. To not show the perfect family, but a Dad raising a daughter all alone, unique and about time. Tell me. Where did this series go wrong? The cast is one of the best ever. Thanks Amazon for having this entire series available to the Prime users for free.

Even that doesn't encompass how tight, clever, and heart-pounding this show is.  Yes, Veronica Mars isn't as gritty, real, and cold as Breaking Bad, the Sopranos, or Mad Men (the other top ranked shows on the list) and it's not just silly comedy like the Office or 30 Rock (other awesome shows ranked on the list), but rather it's a combination of both hard-boiled scenes and witty banter.  The first season of Veronica Mars is undoubtably the strongest of the 3, and will show you why fans loved the show enough to fund a movie version.  Very few shows have such pop quality with such high level writing.  (I forgot to mention the great acting of at-the-time unknown Kristen Bell and company).  Ten years after watching the show for the first time, this show still ranks among the best I've ever seen.  I notice more foreshadowing and more heart-grabbing moments each time I watch it.

It's high school drama to be sure, but it is much more than just an evening teen soap.  Fun sarcasm, great characters/acting (well, Veronica, Logan, Weevil, and Keith anyway), and an overarching mystery that keeps you engaged without it feeling horribly drawn out.  If you haven't, give it a shot.  And try to remember it was like 2004, so no smart phones yet :)",1391126400,,611,4.568807339449541

2375751,3,B000A59PMO,"At 67 I am probably not the target audience for this modern day version of Nancy Drew Mysteries, but I enjoyed it anyway. With it's complex mix of characters and relationships Veronica Mars serves up one pot boiler after another by exploiting the foibles of today's teens. It also reflects the technology haunted lives this society has afflicted itself with.

I didn't give it a higher rating because I do not think the ""Weevil"" character, who is supposed to be a gang member to be feared, was at all fearsome. Furthermore, the danger of snooping around in other peoples lives is sort of sickening. No one should be able to do that with the impunity that the title character enjoys.",1390953600,,682,4.683333333333334

2375753,5,B000A59PMO,"I watched this season about 8-9 years, but didn't remember anything about it other than that I liked it.  So I decided to rewatch it because I heard about the movie coming out.  I CAN'T STAND 90% of the teen dramas that are out there nowadays.  Veronica Mars is just in it's own class entirely.  Veronica is stubborn, impulsive, and curious to a fault, but she has a dry sarcasm and snarkiness that is often hilarious and is mature far beyond her years.  She's driven to seek out justice mostly because of how mistreated she, and other middle/lower class students, are by the mostly terrible uber-rich students.  The primary mysteries of season 1 are who really killed her best friend Lilly and who date-raped her at a party, and then in each episode is a smaller case she is trying to solve.  Then there is her love life... Let's just say I'm Team Logan, all the way.  He is a sarcastic, passionate, complex character also.  I also loved the relationship between her and her dad.  They are always on each other's side and their love for each other is undoubtable.  They also joke around with each other in a way that is hilarious.  There are many other more minor characters that are either very likable or that you love to loathe.  I can definitely see why so many fans came out to support the Veronica Mars movie.",1390953600,,1316,4.5021097046413505

2375756,5,B000A59PMO,Veronica Mars is a likable teen sleuth who helps her father solve mysteries in his PI business while taking on cases at school. The big crime of this season was the murder of her best friend which she eventually solves. She spends time tracking down her drunken mother and also finds out the truth of who her real father is. I was entertained by this show and look forward to the next season. If you like a mystery and/or Kristen Bell I'm pretty sure you will enjoy these shows.,1390867200,,478,4.382022471910112

Veronica Mars character shows courage, intelligence and tenacity, as she faces daily the arrogance and rudeness showed towards her and her father, in a town ruled by a man with power and wealth.  Her character shows compassion to others, even when undeserved, yet she stands up for herself in the face of a bully.  I think the massage is very powerful.  Yes, I know it's not based on real characters; though it could be.  It is uplifting to see my emotions going to the positive instead of the negative attitude of, ""hoping the bully get's what is coming to them.""",1390867200,,626,4.456140350877193

2375803,3,B000A59PMO,"Most Teen TV shows have their production issues but this one does a good job of not having these horrible 3 minute MTV hip hop crappy music video interludes before dialogue. It's non-stop acting/drama that you expect for a quality TV Show. Season one kept my attention. It is Not ""GREAT"" but entertaining none the less. Season Two and Three just lost its momentum and I lost interest. Great background noise while doing something else. Like most teen TV shows, producers and writers seem to forget how ""adult"" and ""intelligent"" young kids are these days. We grow up much faster than say the 1950's. LOL!! Wish they would keep up with that FACT. As ""viewers"" who watch TV: we can ""Suspend Our Disbelief"" (as they call it) but only to a point. Unfortunately, this show far beyond what I am able to find believable or real. The down side to most of the teen TV dramas of today's era is that the ""Adult"" writers create characters who don't ""think"" as normal human beings but more like criminals that you would see in jail but instead of ""jail"" they are set in a high school environment. Unfortunately, most teen dramas these days write content that portray teenagers to be mean, callous and inhuman with NO Intelligence as to their choice of behavior which is not the case of a real teenage human being. I wonder if this is an influence to so many common high school shootings and online bullying (that you would never see in past generations).",1390867200,,1440,4.607003891050583

2375856,5,B000A59PMO,"I was curious about the hype of the crowd funded movie and saw Veronica Mars on Prime and thoroughly enjoyed this first season and am currently watching the 2nd season (which seems a bit more disjointed than Season 1).

I like shows that have both a riveting A and B story and Veronica Mars delivers as her best friend was murdered and both Veronica and her father believe the crime is still unsolved, despite a man coming forward and confessing to the murder with possession of some of the victim's personal effects.  Her personal life is in shambles as her boyfriend stopped talking to her and her mother just up and left after the murder that caused her father to lose his position of Sheriff.  She also deals with a smaller case in every episode that usually involves something happening at her polarized high school which is comprised of the children of the extremely wealthy and the lower-middle class.

I actually care about the characters (some of which are ""bad"" at times, but still have a lot of heart) in the show and it is very well cast and written.  Kristin Bell is fantastic in the show as she plays a high school student that deals with the pressures of being a high school outcast and an aspiring Private Investigator sometimes working cases to help the people that often are her adversaries at school.

If I were to sum it up, it is a dramatic Scooby Doo, 90210 and CSI mixed together in a teen-oriented show that is still very watchable by adults without feeling cheesy or dumbed down for a specific age group or audience.",1390867200,,1541,4.565217391304348

2375922,5,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars was one of the best shows canceled in the aftermath of the WB/UPN merger. I think the overwhelming success of the kickstarter campaign proves that. Season one is a great story full of twists and turns. I only wish Veronica was a little less quick to jump to conclusions and more forgiving of those who love her most, but who among us is perfect?",1390867200,,359,4.454545454545454

2375926,5,B000A59PMO,I loved the show. Fired through all three seasons. The writing is crisp and witty. The stories are fun and give a great tip of the hat to the Noir detective story. The orerlapping arcs are intense and the cast does a great job bringing it together. I recomend for anyone of any age.,1390867200,,282,4.2407407407407405

2375938,3,B000A59PMO,"Most of the main characters seem too old to playing such young characters but the acting at times is very good.

2375941,5,B000A59PMO,We found the Amazon Instant Video service to be extremely frustrating. The excellent show was continually interrupted so the video stream could buffer. I'll be borrowing the DVDs from the library instead of using Amazon Instant Video again.,1390867200,,240,5.342105263157895
2375942,5,B000A59PMO,"I have been rewatching this show in anticipation of the March 14th movie release. Though I was always a huge fan of the show for the three years it was on television, I was afraid time may have tainted my recollection of it's spectacularily, Thankfully I was wrong. Each episode is better than the last, smart, funny and well written. There are 64 total episodes of this series, and I have a feeling I will be as equally devastated when I get to the last one as I was when it aired originally on May 22nd, 2007.",1390867200,,511,4.278350515463917
2375943,5,B000A59PMO,"If you were to ask me if I would watch a ""teen private eye serial drama"" the answer would likely be no. But I have come to learn that Metacritic doesn't lie and that there are gems and many genres that I shouldn't write off.

This show falls squarely in that category. Lead Kirsten Bell is delightfully sassy. Her delivered is quick, funny, and believable.

My wife regular comments that she wishes she could go to Neptune High School.

The first season ends with some satisfying and not entirely predictable plot twists that make you want to know where the show is going next. Recommended.",1390867200,,590,4.6
2375944,5,B000A59PMO,"Can't believe I never watched it when it was airing on TV.  Great storyline, each episode leaves you craving the next.

2375945,4,B000A59PMO,Would recommend for teens through adults.  Good story lines - really a modern day Nancy Drew series demonstrating gals can be just as determined and effective as guys in tough situations.  Kristen Bell is awesome in this role.,1390867200,,226,4.921052631578948

2375959,5,B000A59PMO,Great series! Caught me off guard with unexpected endings! I like how the series follows through from one episode to the other. Great scripting! Glad to know that they are actually making a Verona Mars Movie set to come out sometime in 2014!,1390867200,,241,4.627906976744186
2375960,5,B000A59PMO,Great storyline and acting. Kristen Bell can make any actors perform twice as well. The diversity of the one big storyline and the several mini storylines throughout the season is refreshing.,1390867200,,191,5.193548387096774

2375964,5,B000A59PMO,So glad I decided to check out this series when it was featured as a free offering with my Amazon Prime membership.  I enjoyed all three seasons and wished there were more as did a lot of other fans because now I see there will be a 10 year reunion movie coming out soon.  Looking forward to it.,1390867200,,295,4.068965517241379
2375965,5,B000A59PMO,"This show has so much more to it than just mystery. I'll be the first to admit that the cases are a bit goofy at times and while Veronica is supposed to be smart there are some crazy stupid things that she does, I'm not here because of that. The heart of this show lies in the characters and how much they mean to one another. Sure I'm a huge LoVe fan (I ship Veronica/Logan's relationship), but I don't think I hold any other T.V. friendship (Veronica and Wallace) as dear to my heart. Don't even get me started on The father/daughter relationship between her and Keith. Granted I come from a single father/only daughter household, I'm telling you now - nothing even comes close to hitting home like this show does. But then if it wasn't any good, the movie wouldn't have earned a $5.7 million budget from the fans on kickstarter :)",1390867200,,833,4.415584415584416

2375967,4,B000A59PMO,The series starts out a little slow and then begins to have an underlying mystery that transits from episode to episode.  The series ties itself together with many different mysteries to solve.  Acting by Kristen Bell is superb.  A lot of light hearted banter throughout.,1390867200,,271,4.977777777777778
2375988,5,B000A59PMO,"I thought the show had a lot more depth than expected from a ""teen"" show - it's high school afterall! But it tackled relationships, prejudices, economic inequality, etc. in a fresh way. And add the mystery aspect, both weekly and over the whole season and I thought it was a winner and worth watching the other two seasons. Probably would have made me nuts to watch on a weekly basis - great to use Amazon Prime and watch the whole season at once for free! Well worth the time!",1390867200,,477,4.370786516853933

2376009,3,B000A59PMO,"First: I *LOVE* this show. However, this item looks like a re-packaging of a remaindered set of discs.
1.  The original multi-disc jewel box case that held the individual discs on separate spindles is missing,
  and the cheap plastic case they came in holds ALL of the discs on ONE spindle with NO protection
  in between.
2.  Because of the missing original packaging, the liner notes are incomplete.

2376012,5,B000A59PMO,"I remember watching an episode or two of VM back when it first aired in the early 2000s.

I liked it. But I was busy with so many other things that I didn't pay it the attention it deserved.

What a fool I was.

Today, my wife and I are dyed-in-the-wool Marshmallows. We even contributed to the Kickstarter campaign to get the Veronica Mars movie made.

And that's saying a lot because we're TV snobs. We only watch well-written, well-acted, well-directed TV along the lines of the Twilight Zone, The Dick van Dyke Show, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, The X Files, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly, Doctor Who, Sherlock, etc.

When we stumbled on Veronica Mars we hit the jackpot.

Veronica Mars is like Buffy the Vampire Slayer on steroids. It has Buffy's wit and lovable characters, but with a far more consistent and compelling storyline. The dialogue is more natural - and far wittier. The plots are more engrossing. And the characters are so well written and believable that they seem like real people.

We cannot recommend this TV series highly enough.

If you're looking for a show that you can fall in love with, this is it.",1390608000,,1129,4.61
2376013,5,B000A59PMO,"love this show. I've watched season one probably 10 times.  The story telling is tight, the characters are original and the last three episodes will keep you up at night. loved the season long arc.",1390521600,,197,4.628571428571429

Soooo, I finally popped on an episode when it became available on Prime...and yeah, I watched the whole series in a weekend.  It's awesome!  Highly recommended!",1390521600,,263,4.8
2376015,4,B000A59PMO,The characters are clever and interesting.  The acting is good.  The main character puts herself in vulnerable situations which are unrealistic and not very clever but of course nothing ever seems to go terribly bad for her so....It's just enjoyable entertainment,1390521600,,263,5.390243902439025
2376016,5,B000A59PMO,I gave this show five stars because it is awesome.  The show keeps you entertained and wanting more.  Mysteries and detectives in high school....lovin it!!!,1390521600,,156,5.2

2376029,4,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars is a nice movie to watch. This movie balances action and reflection. There is action but not absurd violence as we see in some movies, and this is what gave to Veronica Mars it charm. It also address familial issues, professional issues and social issues in a balanced manner. The relation of father and daughter engaged in a same adventure, with suspense and unknown possibilities for the spectator but also for Veronica herself.",1390521600,,444,4.933333333333334

2376034,2,B000A59PMO,"I liked the show in the first season, early on, when she would solve different ""crimes"" every episode. When it got to the main plot and the season long stuff, her relationships, friends, etc, it was like watching Bundy pick up alliances to his final goal.

Unable to maintain a relationship - check
Uses everyone - check
Superficial charm - check
Liar - check
Manipulative - check
Lack of guilt - check
Emotionally shallow - check
Doesn't take responsibility of her actions - check
Gets bored easily - check
Impulsive - check
Irresponsible - check
Delinquency - check
Slut - check

Eventually by season two I go fed up and gave up on it. I mean the whole best friend's murder plot was so unbearable. She blamed everyone along the way, and in her wake she left a lot of hurt people picking up the pieces after they were put under a microscope by others. She felt no remorse in going all willi nilly pointing fingers, hell I wish her on.off again bf had jumped off the bridge too, maybe she'd feel a bit of guilt; then again probably not.

Like I said, want to watch this, might as well pick up the unabomber's manifesto or any of the documentaries on Gacy or Gein.",1390521600,,1163,4.425233644859813

This wasn't some cutesy teenager solving who rigged the Prom Queen election, this was a battled hardened outcast trying to make ends meet with her wrongfully disgraced father. She solves the occassional fluff mystery, but she also catches killers, cheats and possible terrorists. The writing is excellent, the acting is superb and the story lines are engrossing.

I am almost done with Season 1 in just a few days, and I can't wait to keep going! I highly recommend you to watch this!",1390435200,,754,4.4963503649635035

The plot doesn't even need the backflash history although you can better understand why she is how she is.",1390435200,,137,4.52

2376101,5,B000A59PMO,"Great show. It is very addicting. The ensemble is great. Sometimes the stories are far fetched,  but I love how throughout the series every episode always deals with a new case while still working on resolving the main case",1390348800,,223,4.717948717948718
2376102,5,B000A59PMO,Love this show. So fun and spunky.  I have been wanting to watch this for some time. Wahoo for amazon prime.,1390348800,,108,4.142857142857143
2376103,4,B000A59PMO,"There are a number of teen girl adventures made for audiences beyond the junior Disney genre.  If you accept ""Buffy"" as the five star leader of this ilk, Veronica Mars ranks about three or four stars in comparison.  Veronica had possibilities to equal footing with ""Buffy"" if supporting characters were more interesting and situation were less commonplace.  The acting is professional, the staging is well done but it is lacking the pop to make it a stand-out product that makes you want to immediately watch the next program in the series.  This is an excellent program for a student of writing to view and experiment with little quirks of character and plot to enhance each show since the basics of the production are fine.",1390348800,,725,4.82258064516129
2376104,5,B000A59PMO,I watched all three seasons and would say the first is the best. There is an arc to the story that carries throughout the 21 or so shows that season. Enjoy.,1390348800,,156,4.064516129032258

2376106,5,B000A59PMO,This is one of those shows I never even knew was on TV until I was looking around Amazon Instant Video.  Pretty cool show.  Like a modern day Nancy Drew.  I find it entertaining and surprising.,1390348800,,193,4.305555555555555
2376107,5,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars was one of those shows that feels like it was under appreciate at its time. Perhaps overlooked because of its high-school setting, ""cliched"" rich versus poor themes, or serial-story episodes (which have become common these days), Veronica Mars is a show that has so many things other television shows are lacking, such as a strong lead characters, interesting mystery plots, as well as characterization and development.

The first season focuses on Veronica Mars and the repercussions of the death of her best friend Lilly the previous year. Now estranged from her former friends, the progeny of the ""California Elite"" called the 00ers, thanks to Lilly's death and her father being fired as sheriff for implicating Lilly's parents, Veronica Mars deals with the social pressures of a high school split along economic lines while helping her father with his private detective business and running her own secret investigation into the murder.",1390348800,,954,5.276315789473684

2376139,5,B000A59PMO,Too bad there is only 2 seasons! Enjoyed this show even though it is ten years old. Thanks Amazon.com yeah,1390348800,,106,4.35
2376140,5,B000A59PMO,"I love, love, love Veronica Mars. I loved it when it came out and I have had a blast re-watching it. I think that Season 1 is the strongest of the three. It's one part girl power, one part romance, one part murder mystery. What more can you ask for out of a tv show? I would highly recommend this!!",1390348800,,298,3.9833333333333334

2376143,5,B000A59PMO,We were looking for something to watch while taking care of our newborn and stumbled across Veronica Mars.  I thought it was going to be some stupid teenage drama -- but it's much more than that.  Interesting plot line with many twists and turns.  The long arc story of Lilly's murder is really engaging and the weekly mini-arc was usually pretty interesting as well.  This show is kind of like a mix between the OC and Colombo.  I would recommend it.,1390348800,,451,4.518518518518518
2376144,3,B000A59PMO,"Fun enough to watch with my 10 yr old daughter. A bit far-fetched but fun. Acting is good. Some actors are terrific - particularly like the biker played by Francis Capra. Also Percy Daggs III as Veronica's best friend is fantastic. The always talented Enrico Colantoni is fabulous as Veronica's father. I love his understated yet supportive fatherhood role. He exemplifies what a real man looks like. Calm, caring, honesty. Nicely done.",1390348800,,436,5.069444444444445

2376146,5,B000A59PMO,"Love this show! It's a good mystery drama that keeps it fun and lighthearted! A little unrealistic for a show portraying high school students, but what show really is? Still great entertainment nonetheless and Kristen Bell's witty charm makes it.",1390348800,,246,5.175
2376147,5,B000A59PMO,"I had forgotten what a great show this is!  So much fun to watch, especially waiting for Veronica's next 'zinger'. Great story lines too, I found myself 'binge watching' just to see what will happen next.",1390348800,,204,4.666666666666667

2376163,5,B000A59PMO,No clue why this was ever on the CW. It's quite a bit darker than their typical Teen angst dramas. It's well written and well acted. There is also a movie coming out soon. Start watching. You won't regret it.,1390348800,,208,4.225
2376164,5,B000A59PMO,Awesome! If you like mystery type shows mixed in with high school drama then look no further. I'm just sad it only lasted for 3 seasons. Looking forward to the upcoming movie!,1390348800,,175,4.5

2376189,4,B000A59PMO,"This show is ridiculously dramatic but I enjoyed it anyways. Kind of reminds me of Degrassi as it is hard to believe the drama that continually happens in one town, but I like Kristen Bell, so I'll let it slide.",1390348800,,211,4.3

2376195,4,B000A59PMO,"I had no idea about this series prior to hearing about the fan-base funded movie and so started watching to see what the fuss was about.  This show is well written, with characters that are nuanced.  I quickly got engaged with caring about them and combined with the fast paced dialogue this is a gem of a series.
Unfortunately, the streaming on amazon needs to invest in more/better servers as it glitches (very frustrating) -- if you want to compete with netflix............. 'nuff said.",1390262400,,489,4.809523809523809

I like the snappy dialogue and the every episode has at least  2 and sometimes 3 subplots.  I think it's a fun show but if you don't like young people then you won't like this show.  There are several actors from other current shows that either guest appeared or are semi regulars on this show and the actors just click together.,1390176000,,437,4.216867469879518

It's still so good! The chemistry between Veronica and her Dad is great and I love that amid all the high drama there are moments of goofiness that make it seem more real. Sure, the hijinks and plot theme of a 17 year old mystery solver with her dad sidekick are a little Nancy Drew, but the show doesn't take itself too seriously which makes it fun to just enjoy and get lost in all the mysteries each episode.

I've been a Prime member for years and have never utilized the streaming until I heard about VM. Now I've been telling everyone I know to go watch the series before the movie comes out. If you're a fan of mysteries, this one wins the prize. The writing is smart, the dialogue is witty, and the characters are tragically flawed - and yet you fall in love with them.

What I truly enjoy are all of the various areas of San Diego they show; Hillcrest, Mission Beach, Pacific Beach, Point Loma, Ocean Beach, especially my hometown La Jolla. What really caught my eye is the motel that Veronica and her father live in. That motel is located in Ocean Beach. I actually worked there 40 years ago and so have pleasant memories of the place. At that time there actually were people who lived there, full time, as well as the average vacationer who would stay a couple of nights, to a week.",1390089600,,569,4.643564356435643

If that was not enough; how can you resist Kristen Bell? Ok so it is not Breaking Bad or The Sopranos or Mad Men or even The Good Wife but somehow it pulls you in and keeps you watching. By the end of the third season  I couldn't believe that there wasn't more. My wife and I cannot wait for the movie.,1390089600,,435,4.0

In 2013 she told me about the Kickstarter campaign to raise money for the Veronica Mars movie. We both became official Kickstarter Backers and are going to receive the movie on DVD as part of our Backer rewards. We've been re-watching the TV episodes on Amazon Prime to get ready for the movie release. Even after 10 years time and knowing the solutions to the mysteries, Veronica's snarky dialogue is just as enjoyable as it was then. Highly recommended!",1390089600,,543,4.666666666666667
2376344,4,B000A59PMO,"Here I am, in 2014, catching up in a 10 year old show and being absolutely astounded by the intelligence and wit of a show that I would never watch on TV when it first appeared. There's a bit of coyness to the premise of the plots at first that put me off, but I have to admit, 3 shows into the 1st season, and I was absolutely hooked on watching every episode available on amazon prime. The first season was clever and well timed, the acting is first rate, and nothing was ""saccharine"" or too cutesey, which makes me wonder why the general public wasn't interested in keeping this series in production. Perhaps there is a bit of the ""Nancy Drew"" concept, plus this is very complicated plot lines that need full attention to the story in progress, and despite the premise of taking place in a high school, perhaps the general viewing public was more interested in the newer ideas that came along at the same time, i.e. reality shows etc. Perhaps it was deemed to be tame at that time. Frankly, I enjoy the premise of less violence and more character development. Glad I have access to all the seasons.",1390089600,,1101,4.428571428571429

The continuing story line keeps you wondering and trying to guess the next part.  The stories about the ""upper class"" in the series seems to have a bit of truth to it.  Also, the location shots are not that bad.",1389830400,,354,4.571428571428571
2376517,4,B000A59PMO,"I'm almost done with the 1st season of Veronica Mars.  I decided to give this 10 year old CW show a try after hearing the buzz surrounding the shows fans' funding of a Veronica Mars Movie.  So far, I find Logan and Weevil are especially interesting characters.  Initially presented as shallow bullies, we learn more about their inner lives as the season progresses and come to understand why they act the way they do.

Veronica Mars herself is impossibly cool and capable, but having once been part of the in-crowd as the local Sheriff's daughter, dating the richest guy in town's son - both she and her dad now find themselves scratching out a living on the margins of a society that has rejected them.  It's a modern dynamic that's becoming all too common, the ""haves"" with the financial means and social clout to manipulate the system vs. the have-nots who must hold down jobs to help their struggling parents make ends meet.

The most clever bits are when our heroine's detective services are employed in age-appropriate endeavours, such as digging up dirt on the parents of her fellow students (in order to give the kids more leverage), recovering a stolen school mascot, discovering who is selling fake IDs, of finding a runaway friend.  It earns Veronica enough to pay for her own car (fun!) but she also decides to sacrifice her college savings in order to pay for a family member's stint in rehab (not so much fun)

There really are schools such as Neptune High, although the personalities are not as extreme.  In my town of Naples, FL, the flagship high school has quite a few millionaire's kids attending the same classes as their servants' kids.  Governor Rick Scott's daughter attended and the school's attendance zone includes the city's only public housing complex.  Granted the rich kids are not nearly as extreme or catty, but history class discussions can get pretty intense around election time!

I noticed that in the pilot they used a run-of-the-mill working class apartment building for Veronica and her dad to call home.  In subsequent episodes the producers still have Veronica living in an apartment but it's a much nicer place, being on the beach (No way!) with lush landscaping and richer architectural details.

It's an interesting, entertaining and affective show which is included free-of-charge with the price of your Amazon Prime membership fee!",1389830400,,2377,4.91

There's a reason people come to her and she proves again and again you only cross her once. Though others may talk about her and make fun of her they know there's a line you don't cross because if you do her wrath is swift and unforgiving.

Would have earlier but since my DVR had started deleting older episodes... I was without the Pilot. So after the Pilot Reaired... I watched what at the time people compared to some kind of ""Buffy/Nancy Drew/Chloe Sullivan (of Smallville)"" TV Series.  It's none of those things.

Starting almost a year after the Death of her Best Friend Lilly Kane... We meet a young woman forever changed from the experience. Her life has been turned upside down and yet instead of becoming/remaining a victim to various misfortunes she soldiers on.

As the Pilot/season progresses you get to see Veronica 1.0 (in flashback) become who she is today... You root for her to find out ""Who killed Lilly Kane?"" and hope that it results in a Happy Ending for her family and her.",1389657600,,885,4.660256410256411

One thing I noticed this time is that I really didn't appreciate Harry Hamlin's acting as Aaron Echolls before. Watching the first season entirely within a week and knowing how it ended somehow let me notice what Hamlin was doing in a way I never did when the show was first shown. He did some very nice work showing different sides to different people.  In the show, he's often dismissed as an inferior actor but Harry Hamlin shows Aaron Echolls keeps his best acting for his real life. high quality bad guy performance.",1389484800,,743,4.613636363636363

VM has all the smarts and cynicism of Philip Marlowe and that core of un-corruptible ethics which make the classic film noir detective.  In a world where so many detective shows have degenerated into constant bloody murders and sex crimes ... it is refreshing to enjoy a show where not all the mysteries are ""murders"" ... the series doesn't rely on blood, gore, and gratuitous violence ... it is more clever than that.  VM also deals with Chandler's recurring theme of the Very Rich vs Everyone Else.  ""Neptune California ... the town with no middle class"", rings very true if you live in certain areas of coastal Southern Cali.  Sometimes this theme is nailed a bit too hard ... but it is refreshingly honest and oddly more realistic than many a TV detective show I've seen lately.

The show looks and sounds great in HD, but with one major caveat. There are no subtitles available for the hard of hearing and deaf, of which I am one. I hope this was an oversight and Amazon will reupload them with subtitles intact.

2376673,5,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars is one of the rare shows that stands the test of a yearly rewatch (for going on ten years). The dialogue is sharp, the plot and subplots are incredibly well-structured (especially for the first season), and the characters and their relationships are some of the best I've seen on any TV show. The chemistry of the cast is unbeatable. Veronica is wicked smart, but often too much so for her own good; we are meant to question gray/difficult/poor choices she makes throughout the course of three seasons. Veronica is the kick-ass, smart-ass, Nancy Drew of a best friend I wanted to have (slash be) growing up, and she is a character so vividly imagined that it seems possible that she actually was.

In response to a reviewer who that said he was underwhelmed by the pilot and never came back to the show, I will give the piece of advice I think is required of most shows like this: watch the first two episodes (rather than just the pilot) before giving up (and hardcore missing out). The pilot is always going to be a more preliminary version of the show, and the premise of VM season one is based on character histories. Although still fabulous, it's a bit more backstory-heavy than the rest of the eps.

Veronica Mars is worth it in a big way. Added bonus: watch it now and you'll be just in time to join the cult of Marshmallows for the Veronica Mars Movie in March 2014.

2376700,5,B000A59PMO,"This show is really fresh and smart and not at all what I expected.  Kristen Bell really nails this character and Veronica is not a simple character at all.  The mood of the show is surprisingly dark and the stories are complex but believable. Veronica seriously kicks ass without the aid of any super powers or firearms, but instead uses her wits and her moxie (and on rare occasions a taser).  What a concept!  And even though Veronica is literally feared by just about everyone in her high school because of her ""skills"", she is a lonely outcast and she is still just a vulnerable teenage girl when it comes to many things.  Each episode has Veronica solving various and numerous problems for people in clever and inventive ways and also dealing with the usual issues of high school life as an outcast.  Additionally, there is a season long story arc about the murder of Veronica's best friend and as the season progresses Veronica learns more and more about the murder.  I am making this sound really simple but believe me there is a lot of complexity involved in these sub-plots.  The end of the season reaches a climax when the murderer is discovered and the ending resolution is suitably exciting, pretty believable, somewhat surprising, and very satisfying.  Each time I watch an episode of this show I feel a little smarter.  I think that means the writing is really good.  Overall, I highly recommend this series and I am really looking forward to watching season two.",1385942400,2,1478,4.712062256809339

Veronica Mars is so wonderfully written. The show is complemented by multifaceted characters, witty and sarcastic banter, and a flawed but lovable heroine. I couldn't help but fall in love with the characters, especially Veronica, Logan, Weevil, Wallace, Lilly, Keith, and Mac. Characters that seem unlikable at first, like Dick, even started growing on me.

I was devastated when they cancelled the show after only three seasons, but you can start watching this series without fear of being left hanging. There will be a movie coming out to give us Veronica Mars fans (Marshmallows) a semblance of closure, so I definitely recommend you start watching now.

When her dad becomes a private investigator, Veronica follows suit becoming a teen PI. She battlesthe forces of evil in her small California town with her smarts and cheerleader-esque good looks. There are plenty of dark, noir-ish elements in the storyline but Veronica uses her cutting wit to get her past the derision of her very rich ex-friends and classmates.

I have now watched all three seasons and I have to say this first season is the best. Kristin Bell makes the show. She plays the daughter of a private investigator. She is also a perky outcast at her high school which is divided into the ""have"" and ""have-nots"". She is a ""have-not"" as far as money goes but she is definitely a ""have"" when it comes to smarts. She is her father's daughter and uses her keen investigative skills to help fellow classmates with their undercover needs.

The great thing about this first season is that the writers have created this great plot arc that covers the whole season at the same time giving each episode a mini-plot. Not an easy feat. We have the giant mystery of who killed Veronica's BFF and then we have smaller mysteries throughout the episodes. Very clever. I also enjoyed watching all the 21st century surveillance equipment and computer technologies that Veronica uses in her undercover escapades.

The combination of smart writing and a terrific cast just keeps me coming back to this funny, dark, noir tale. On the one hand we have rich kids Jake and Logan, the 09ers. On the other end of the spectrum is Weevil, Wallace, and the other disenfranchised students at Neptune HS. And smack dab in the middle is Veronica (and her dad), keeping this whole universe spinning on its axis. Keith Mars used to be the town sheriff, till he got booted. And the apple, as they say, doesn't fall far from the tree. Everyone at school knows that is you have a problem, Veronica specializes in making it go away.

While there's not a vampire to be seen, this show is easily the successor to Buffy. Its got a tight cast, marvelous biting humor, and great stories. Not sure what took me so long to look into it. Don't make the same mistake. Enjoy the DVDs, then sit back and wait. Its fanbase has funded a movie for this cancelled TV show.

Like many good shows, it takes 2 or 3 episodes to really get in to it due to character developement, but man this show is like potato chips; you just can't stop watching.  Think Nancy Drew meets the Outsiders, or Nancy Drew on steroids.  Good acting and chemistry between the actors, and solid writing.

2376915,5,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars is deceiving.  It looks like a show made for high schoolers, but it's actually a lot more than that.  I'd like to mention that Rob Thomas (the creator) first wanted to take Veronica Mars to HBO because of how dark it was.  However, UPN got ahold of him first, and wanted it as long as they made it a little bit ""lighter.""  My point is that Veronica Mars isn't just a little feel good teeny bopper show.  It's an intricate, exciting, mystery series with believable twists and turns at every corner.

I first watched this show at 16 and loved it.  I re-watched it again to make sure I didn't love it from just being a teen, and I still love it!  I heavily pressured my boyfriend in his late 30s to watch it, and he very reluctantly agreed.  After the second episode he was totally hooked and just kept saying, ""play the next episode!""  The characters are likable, relatable, interesting, and everything is woven together so perfectly.  It really is a masterpiece!  Even Stephen King loves this, and he's an old man!

If you love mystery/noir type shows, you MUST watch this, whether you're 15 or 50!",1343088000,2,1111,4.495

2376939,5,B000A59PMO,"I don't mean to steep huge praise the show can't possibly live up to but TV in general has gotten soboring, mundane, predictable, and cookie-cutter.  In the midst of bad reality TV, Veronica Mars (especially the first season) was an amazing light.

The series follows Veronica Mars.  She is high school student and the daughter of a PI, who used to be the sherrif.  She is a student at the fictional Neptune High.  School that features the kids of the ultra rich and the kids of the ultra riches servants.  Veronica was accepted by the rich cool clique even if she wasn't rich when her father was sherrif...but he lost his job when he took a moral stance on a case that investigated the murder of Veronica's best friend.  We join the story when her former circle of friends has turned against her...

Veronica works as a PI in her own right investigating cases for other students.  Most episodes involve both a case that will wrap up in a single episode and clues to the season long mystery of who really killed her friend.  She does all of this while also navigating the confusing time of being in high school...from dating relationships to date rape, gangs to racism, the cruelty of teens to friendship are all explored in this show.",1327708800,,1235,4.572727272727272

2376943,5,B000A59PMO,"I'm usually not one for over-exeggeration, but this single piece of entertainment, IMHO, is the finest season that I've yet to witness. Everything about it was hitting on all cylinders. It goes without saying that ""Veronica Mars"" is one of the greatest series of the last 20 years, although criminally overlooked. If one can get past the premise (I mean, if the premise of a young blonde girl slaying vampires leads to every single publication calling it one of the greatest shows ever created, you definitely shouldn't judge a book by its cover. I've learned that from none other than ""Buffy""), they will find themselves with a suspenseful, detailed, and completely surprising mystery on their hands, with humor and character developement to boot. The second season is underrated, IMO, and the third season left us a little bit on the empty side, due to network interference, and network interference only. But this season is a masterpiece, and you will be hooked from the first episode on. BUY THE ENTIRE SERIES!",1315699200,,1014,4.970588235294118
2376944,5,B000A59PMO,"Every year as the new tv season begins the premise of at least 2 or 3 shows intrigue me and in 2004, Veronica Mars was one show that I anticipated viewing.  I usually give new shows 2 - 3 episodes to draw me in but this show kept my attention from the outset - a high school junior trying to solve her best friend's murder.

Kristen Bell was exceptional in this role and I rooted for this character who not only lost her best friend but her mother, boyfriend and people she thought were her friends; she was raped and had to deal with ostracism at school. Anchoring the show is the true chemistry between the actors and the writing - the dialogue on this show is witty and the pacing of the show kept my attention I didn't feel let down or that episodes dragged during mid-season.

I also have to commend a few of the co-stars who contributed to this almost magical season namely: Enrico Colantoni as Veronica's father - the disgraced sheriff who is adjusting to life without his job or wife; Jason Dohring as Logan Echolls - best friend of Veronica's ex who enjoys tormenting her; Francis Capra as Weevil - leader of a gang who has an uneasy ""friendship"" with Veronica and Percy Daggs as Wallace Fennel - a new student who is befriended by Veronica.

As an older viewer who sometimes shuns shows that I feel are aimed towards teens or those in their 20's, I'm glad that I didn't dismiss this show and I have to admit that it has high replay value.  There's not a lot of violence, profanity or gore which usually turns me off of a show - there is a lot of exceptional acting, writing & storytelling which makes it one of the best 1st seasons of any show I've ever watched.",1314489600,2,1672,4.329073482428115

2376946,5,B000A59PMO,"This television show is such smart, fun entertainment.  I had only vaguely heard of Veronica Mars when it was on the air, and did not actually see it until this past year.  It is not another teen/tween drama, but rather is interesting, witty, a little dark, mysterious, and so relatable with all things high school and fitting in.  I love the occasional film noir ambiance given to the Mars' detective agency.  The writers of this series have a really broad range, touching on issues of bullying, high school cliques, family troubles, parent/child relationships, and some great mysteries.  Each episode has a case that Veronica solves, as well as an ongoing mystery throughout the season.  I really like this format, as there is some satisfaction at the end of each episode, and a building suspense as the season goes on.  This is also true for the subsequent two seasons but the first is absolutely the best.  I like mysteries in general, and I expected Veronica Mars to be a semi-juvenile series but when the mystery is resolved, I really didn't see it coming.  I won't give anything away but it was good.  Do yourself a favor and don't look ahead!  I'm not sure how appropriate I'd find this for young teens but for the adult and young adult audience, it's great.",1311120000,,1266,4.709090909090909

My husband made fun of me for being so into it, but I made him watch the first episode to see why I love the show and he watched all the seasons within 3 weeks, as well (I watched them again, too).  Veronica Mars is just an incredibly well-written, perfectly-cast show with wit, intelligence, a strong female lead (Kristen Bell is amazing), clever plotlines, and enough suspense/drama to keep you up into the wee morning hours because you just HAVE to know what happens next!

2376970,5,B000A59PMO,"I have been a huge fan and supporter of the Veronica Mars series since 2004 when the show first started on UPN.  One of the things I love the most about this show has to do with the unpredictability of the mysteries each season.  The show is able to leave its viewers in complete shock.  To be frank, it's impossible to figure out what really happened until the season finales because of the brilliant writing.  Rob Thomas is able to craft together a mystery that does in fact have some clues sprinkled throughout the season, but viewers are not necessarily able to pick up on all of those clues until they watch the series multiple times.  To this day, I still find little things I previously missed that were ""red flags"" along the way, but by no means is a viewer truly able to figure out how things go down until the end.  The mind of Rob Thomas is one of vast creativity and intelligence.  An additional note, one big distinction that people seem to miss is that while this show is about a teenage girl, the show is definitely not targeted specifically for an adolescent viewing population.  This a show that anyone can enjoy, and I can't think of many other shows that I would equate to Veronica Mars.",1307836800,,1206,4.45

2376974,5,B000A59PMO,"Alright, so this will be my second time watching the entire series of Veronica Mars in less than a month. It's just as good the second time around. The first season starts with tough cynical social outcast Veronica as she meets new friend Wallace. We come to learn that her best friend Lily Kane was murdered and after her dad the amazing Keith Mars accused her father billionaire Jake Kane of the murder her friends turned against her and her mother walked out on them. She is also dealing with lingering feelings for her ex and Lily's brother Duncan who broke up with Veronica unexpectedly prior to Lily's death. Within the first couple episodes the series starts to take shape and you begin dieing to know the big question  ""Who killed Lily Kane?"". The series is supported by an excellent cast. Most notably Jason Dohring as Logan Eckolls who's witty one liners steal the show. Another stunning contributor is Francis Capra as Weevil the tough biker who frequently helps Veronica out. A big part of the series is the relationship between Veronica and her dad which is sweet and fun. I am telling you once you start to watch it will become an obsession. As the season comes to a close ememies become friends and friends become new ememies and the true killer of Lily Kane is revealed in the shocking season finale and a nice cliffhanger to leave you guessing. Once your done you won't be able to wait to watch season two i highly recommend this show to anyone willing to watch.

A couple of months later I was at a used video store and saw this DVD case of season one of Veronica Mars and I knew that was the show!  Thank goodness I got sick that week because all I did was sit on the couch curled up in a blanket watching this amazing story.  Of course the season one finale ended with such a nail biting cliff hanger that I actually ran out to Best Buy immediately and forked out fifty bucks for season two.  (As soon as I got home from Best Buy I went online and ordered season three on Amazon for a much more reasonable price.)  Once I finished all three seasons, I started borrowing them out to my friends and family, who also love the show now.

In this show, life isn't simple, but it is certainly entertaining and unpredictable.  I haven't been so excited about a show in a long time.  I was so impressed, I purchased this for my sister to watch because I'm sure she'll love it as much as me.  I can't wait for her to watch it so I can watch it all over again.  If you are a fan of mystery, thought provoking story lines with a dash of romance thrown in, you'll like this.  Veronica is a strong female character that chooses to fight back rather than be a victim, and I love that.  I can't get over how this made me laugh, cringe and lean forward with curiousity while I tried to figure it out.  I couldn't stop watching!  You could not be disappointed.  Watch this. .

The style of this show is very similar to Dead Like Me. There are alot of narration and alot of flashback. The whole season is focused on one big story and every episode has a little story of its own. I love detective story. I am surprise to see Enrico Colantoni. I remember him in Galaxy Quest. I try my best not to lol every time I see him on the episode.

The WB packaging is very good (same as the Supernatural). It is easy to take the disc out. I don't have to *pry* the disc out with ton of force. The DVD doesn't have much of those FCC stuff or Ads or useless transition screen. Play the DVD and fast forward the FCC screen and that's it. Press Play All and the show starts right away one after another. I hate those useless transition screen.

The only problem is the picture quality. It is very grainy and dark.

Overall, this is a great show with good acting. 5 stars!",1276905600,,1018,4.105527638190955

2376997,5,B000A59PMO,"Anyone that has seen the show has already said what needs be said about this show. I am just writing this to assure anyone that has not seen the show that it is worth the purchase.
This is one of the few shows out there now that is worth your time. This show has intelligence. The writers believe their audience is intelligent, and not into the boring potty-humor that makes most shows so popular today.
VERY witty dialogue, very romantic, hilariously funny, and very mysterious.
The writers reference pop-culture constantly, but these references are (mostly) for those that have a background of classic movies, and 70s & 80s television and music knowledge. Example- If you are a Rocky Horror fan, or Blues Brothers, or so many other movies that I can't even begin to create a list, you will LYAO at so many scenes. I have had to rewind once or twice to get these pop-art quips. This dialogue is fast-paced. Certainly not for the zombies that watch nothing but ""reality"" shows, or movies that attract 13 year-old boys.
This show has great paid actors (aside from Mr. Guttenberg...WHY??). But the main credit goes to the GREAT writers (that obviously had a great time writing the show...then wondered why mentioned ""actor"" was hired to speak their lines).
But the writers of this show deserve most of the credit here, for why this show is so great, in my opinion. You won't find this quality often.
Honestly, one of the best shows I have seen in quite some time, and very deserved of all the high praise you already see here.
1st season, the best.
2nd suffered with finale, but still better than what else was out there.
3rd wonderful.

2377018,5,B000A59PMO,"I just love this show! It's smart and sassy and full of drama.

We follow Veronica Mars, a smart, sassy, and funny teenage girl, who also happens to be an amateur sleuth. Her father is a private investigator and is the former sheriff. She's an outcast in the Neptune town where the rich and powerful reside on the right side of the tracks. The season takes us through snippets of why she's an outcast and the season arc is her trying to solve her best friend Lily's murder.

Each episode adds to the story, but each episode also its own detective story. She becomes the P.I. for the school and the writing is just amazing.

I love Veronica Mars's character. She's a high class feminist and I really enjoy seeing those roles on TV. She has flaws, etc, but that makes her human and we see plenty of flaws with her friends and family as well.

2377021,4,B000A59PMO,"So I came to Veronica Mars late in the game, and am only half-way through season one, but I have rapidly become obsessed.  I won't repeat what the other reviews have said (except that the comparisons to Nancy Drew, Buffy, and Twin Peaks are pretty spot on).  I do want to emphasize that the show isn't perfect.  Some episodes are stronger than others, and of course the premise requires a massive suspension of disbelief, but the overall quality of the series is so far above most other TV that those seem like picky observations.  I will commit heresy though, and suggest that being dropped as a series isn't the worst thing that can happen to a good TV show.  The premise in 'Heroes' had about one good season in it, and that's what we got before it started declining.  Having said that, one or a few good seasons is more than you get in most shows.  Many of the other reviewers have name dropped their favorite shows that others may not be familiar with, so I'll do the same.  Check out 'Slings and Arrows' (18 episodes total, by design), followed by 'Book of Daniel' (only 9 episodes, that was a true loss), 'Clatterford' (12 episodes), and the live action version of 'The Tick' (but not the animated version).

2377043,5,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars is no longer made, but even so it still has to be one of the best series to come out of the USA. The first series sets the storyline for the following series two & three - (equally must haves for you DVD collection). It's concept is a mix between a female Sherlock Holmes meeting Beverly Hills, 90210. Veronica Mars is played by Kristen Bell who gives a blow away performance supported by an equally talented supporting cast. The writing is also in a league of its own and the quality of production is far above the norm. The one-liners coupled with the strong characters  guarantees a great viewing experience. The series finished due to not having enough viewers. This was mainly due to very little publicity and having its US schedule changed weekly. It lasted for 3 series, and considering the crap that is commissioned by the same US television network, it should have gone on for many more years. I have loaned my three box sets to friends who cannot believe they had never heard of seen this brilliant series in the UK. I guarantee once you start watching this show you will be hooked and very disappointed it is no longer in production.",1233705600,,1158,4.5673076923076925
2377044,2,B000A59PMO,"""Veronica Mars"" is a perfect example of a show that had huge critical acclaim, yet did nothing much for me. I bought this solely on the great reviews from noted critics as well as the extremely thought provoking and well-written reviews here on Amazon, but at the end of the day I have to say that I disagree with the general consensus that this show is a 'classic'.

The primary problem for me was that the female lead did not work. Kristen Bell is functional, yes, but more than that she seemed purposely boisterous, with an arsenal of witty one liners out of ""Juno"" that no real person could possibly speak in real life. It felt as if the writers wanted to be hip so badly that everything eventually felt fake. The only recent show where this sort of writing worked was ""Gilmore Girls"" and sadly, the script here was disappointing, especially because I bought the show based on inputs that the script was 'to die for'.

Add to that the storyline, which during the first season is not even riveting enough to want to watch the next episode. I am a fan of missing people and murder mysteries, etc, but the plot here seemed vague and not very gripping, and it seemed a task to want to watch subsequent episodes. While well directed, the show didn't quite appeal to my sense of dark humor either, but it was evident they were going for it.

""Veronica Mars"" is one of those impulse buys that I regret. As a fan of stuff like ""The Golden Girls"", ""Six Feet Under"" and ""Dead Like Me"", I thought this would also be an offbeat little series that would have repeat value. Unfortunately, I can't imagine ANYONE watching any of these episodes more than once, and for me, watching them only once was itself an exercise.

I am sure there are people who swear that this is the greatest TV show ever made, but I beg to differ. This wasn't good or memorable at all, and all I remember is its tackiness.

Two Stars.",1233014400,7,1899,4.429799426934097
2377045,5,B000A59PMO,"Wow! I had never even seen one episode of this show when it was on the air, so I was really taking a chance when I purchased season 1 purely on the basis of the product synopsis and customer reviews.

I am so glad I did. From episode 1, Veronica is a witty, cute, strong willed girl who is really likeable. Her dad, Keith Mars is also a strong character and the humor, he and Veronica share is a wonderful piece of the shows success.

Each episode features Veronica helping her classmates, working on her best friend, Lily Kane's murder or getting even with the spiteful 09'ers who shunned her after she chose to support her father when he accussed Lily's father of murdereing his own daughter.

The show gets more intense with each episode until finally we get the powerfully intense season finale. Let me tell you...I was online ordering seasons 2 and 3 while the credits were still rolling.

2377047,5,B000A59PMO,"Three years ago, when a local store was having a sale (buy one dvd, get one free), I chose this as my free DVD.  ... And, I never opened it since.

Back in October, I was looking for something to watch, and I pulled this out of my shelf.  I told myself that if I didn't like it, I would sell it on ebay.

...

It's been three months, and I haven't sold it.  In fact, I rank it as one of my favourite shows.  I'm saddened that I never watched it on tv, then again, you almost need to watch it from the beginning.

Veronica Mars ... how dangerous she is, how witty she is, but you can't help to *want* her life.  The eighteen year old with the brain of Sherlock Holmes.  It's amazing.  Sometimes she represents the teens who were the outcasts, other days, she represents those who you don't want to mess with.  But underneath it all, she is just like everyone else.

I loved the mystery, I loved the music, I loved the characters (actors), and if anything - I loved the dialogue!  It was witty and it was well written.  There are a lot of pop-culture references written into the show.  And they work, because teens are constantly brought up on pop-culture.

So, in the end, would I recommend this show?  Of course.  If you have Veronica Mars Season 1 sitting on your shelf, I'd crack it out.  You don't know what you're missing.",1231891200,2,1326,4.228

Kristen Bell enbodies Veronica Mars a girl like Buffy Summers was once a popular girl in high school but because of circumstances out of her control.  In Buffy's case becoming The Slayer.  In Veronica's case however, it is being the daughter of the man who led a witch against Jake Kane the equivelent of Steve Jobs (owner of Apple Computer) in the series' whose daughter Lily Kane was murdered in cold blood who also happened to be Veronica's best friend and older brother of her lover Duncan Kane.  One thing that can be said, about the series' is that there are plot twists that you do not see coming.  Characters who may appear the stereotypes of high school but they are not.  This is not your typical ""teen series"" like out of her own father's mouth she's 17 going on 40.  Veronica is very self aware about who she was before her best friend Lily passed away and who she is now.  She realizes the only reason she was ever popular was her relationship with the Kanes.  I think that only makes her so different than Buffy Summers who never knew where she fit; Veronica knows exactly who she is now.  This is not your typical ""genre"" series' either.  I couldn't tell you one episode from the other because all of Season One feels like one huge film.  However, The creator of the series' Rob Thomas does a very good job wrapping up the storylines so when one does get to the last episode of the season, it feels like there is no need for Season Two even though there is one.",1229558400,,1982,4.797058823529412
2377070,5,B000A59PMO,"As anyone reading this review is probably already aware, ""Veronica Mars"" is essentially an updated version of ""Nancy Drew"", by way of Raymond Chandler, and ""Twin Peaks"". However, it is so much more than the old ""Nancy Drew"" TV series of the 1970's. This is an intelligent and funny TV series that, although targeted at a teenage audience, is smart enough to interest and entertain adults. The main plot line of this season centres on the murder of Veronica's best friend Lily Kane (Laura Palmer for the next generation), with other continuing storylines and single episode stories along the way, to keep the audience interested... and this definitely maintained my interest. By the final episode, I found myself comparing this series favourably to the much acclaimed ""Damages"", and when Lily's killer was finally revealed, I felt even more satisfied than I did at the end of ""Damages"". This show kept my family guessing for weeks and did not disappoint any of us. I won't spoil the ending, but I will say that all of the clues are there, you just have to put them together - the mark of a great mystery.

set all around teenage Veronica Mars, who's father is the fired Sheriff and now works as a private investigator, Veronica when she's not all sassy and ostresized from the richy rich, also does a little dabbling in the private investigation area - part Beverly Hills 90210, part Pasadena, and part Charlie's Angels - I just love it.

There is a continued mystery through out the first season regarding the death of Veronica's best friend Lily, the daughter of the super rich Kane family - whose son was also Veronica's one time love affair; as Veronica spends the season hanging out with her one friend Wallace, and fighting with just about everyone who used to be her friend, she ends up solving the murder and winning my complete adoration... and now all three seasons are on DVD - so relive those Neptune moments - you'll love it.",1214352000,,1202,4.665094339622642

2377094,5,B000A59PMO,"I'm not a big TV-watcher, and am more than sick of the reality shows and shallow dramas that have taken over the American airwaves.  I got into Veronica Mars just as her fans were fighting to have her back for a 4th Season. This series, and especially the first season, is CAPTIVATING.  It is smart, witty, and stars a powerful atypical heroine who can fend for herself -- and is a GREAT role model for girls and women. (A refreshing change to other ""role models"" we can choose from). I was glued to my TV set watching all 3 seasons, and must admit my family, including my brothers as well, looked for any excuse to pop the VM DVD in and continue watching it together. In fact, Veronica Mars has multitudes of fans all over the world.

CW cancelled the show, and substituted such gems as ""A Farmer Wants a Wife"" and ""Pussy Cat Dolls."" >:(
A network needs to pick this show back up ASAP - we fans are dying out here without it!",1209772800,,926,4.28

I also have to admit, I never watched the show on TV, I didn't get it until well after it had aired and I had the Third Season on TV.  And being that I LOVED the Third Season, the First and Second far surpassed my expectations.

If you're looking for a good detective show, or an even better teen show, I strongly advise this whole series.",1207353600,,587,4.3
2377097,5,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars is a clever detective series following the title character as she navigates the emotional mines of high school while trying to solve assorted crimes (think a cross between Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Encyclopedia Brown).

It is an engaging show. Like BtVS, Mars is almost *too* clever at times, and the show almost crosses from being hip to being trendy, but by mid-season the show knows exactly what it's doing and doesn't look back.

Running through the season is a strong plotline wherein Veronica tries to solve the murder of a friend of hers (and thereby restore her discredited father's reputation). The last few episodes are filled with revelations, and the finale is an absolute thriller.

The regular cast is excellent, especially the father (Enrico Colantoni) and social-nemesis Logan (Jason Dohring) who winds up practically stealing the show. True to its chic-nature, there's also some inspired stunt casting throughout the series, including in this first season Paris Hilton and Alyson Hannigan.

All-in-all, Veronica Mars is a top notch program. While it hasn't found its voice through the first several episodes, it is, by mid-season, a tightly-written, splendidly-acted thrill ride.

Five stars.",1206921600,,1226,5.331606217616581
2377108,4,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars was a great show, a refreshing change to see a realistic female character on TV who didn't have to kick literal butt like Buffy or Sydney to be assertive. Because that's one of the key things I like about Veronica - she's a great action character without all the action.

The show itself can be described as an amalgamation of The OC, Twin Peaks and maybe Nancy Drew (though I haven't had the pleasure). It's well constructed from the start, with an overarching story as well as weekly whodunnits. The balance between the storylines are maintained well, although one can feasibly put all the pieces of the overarching storyline together from the first 8 episodes.

All the characters are great, although I do sometimes find it unsettling watching something that is so close and yet so far from reality. The show manages to portray teen and adult situations with a better understanding than some shows like The OC, but the protagonist herself is an incredibly unrealistic character, always on the case. Although being the daughter of a PI gives her a better excuse than some, I guess.

1* deducted because of zero extras. Boo.",1206576000,,1139,4.801020408163265
2377109,5,B000A59PMO,"This show is very reminscent of Buffy the Vampire Slayer in its heyday.  The dialogue is witty, the plot is intriguing, and the characters are interesting, realistic and fun.  There is a major story arc involving the mystery behind the death of a teenage girl, Lilly Kane, and a mysterious trauma that befalls the heroine and best friend of Lilly, Veronica,  with both events occuring chronologically before the first episode.  Most of the episodes throughout the season revolve around this arc, laying out clues gradually and subtly.  That said, there are also some entertaining, stand-alone episodes that deal with the challenges of being a teenager and the fun that comes along with it.  This show builds suspense very well, doling out plot twists and revelations consistently and up to the season finale.  Characters are complex and sympathetic, with a lot of backstory given to even minor players to enhance the overall story.  The show really illustrates the way that relationships between people can change due to tragedy, and how sometimes the trusted individual is really the villain while the black sheep of the group can come through when the chips are down.",1206230400,2,1169,5.052083333333333

2377144,5,B000A59PMO,"I had never heard anything about Veronica Mars or watched an episode until this box set went on sale on Amazon and I bought it. After guest starring on Heroes and starring in Pulse I soon fell in love with Kristen Bell and decided to give her show a shot. Ten minutes into the first episode I was hooked. I have never seen a detective show like this one before. This show is filled with great music (ex: The Dandy Warhols), has very different albeit appealing cinematography, the dialouge is fresh and witty and best of all it isn't just another teen soap opera. I was dissappointed later to find out that it only lasted for 3 seasons and after watching the last episode it was apparent the show's writers were not expecting to be cancelled and the last episode left too many questions unanswered. Veronica Mars has become one of my favorite shows and I have watched the 3 seasons many a times since purchasing it. I love that the main character is a strong and feisty girl who doesn't need to pull out ""secret tae kwon do"" moves to pull it off (like Alias or Buffy not that I don't love these shows too). This show is awesome and the writer's seemed to fight the network influence in controversial story lines that most good shows eventually suffer from (Buffy 4th season-lesbian storyline and O.C. season 3-Marissa Cooper in general). I think we should all get together and petition for a 4th Season because I can not get enough Veronica Mars.",1196726400,,1445,4.519083969465649
2377145,5,B000A59PMO,"This was such a great show, I'm sad that it's ended.  The problem, in my opinion, is that it was marketed all wrong.  To judge by the commercials it looked like a modern day Nancy Drew show about a teenager helping her father solve mysteries.  Instead it's a smart a cynical teenager who's trying to track down her best friends murderer, all the while trying to figure out who raped her, why her mother left, and any number of other problems Nancy Drew never had to deal with.

If they'd marketed this to the right people (ie: not the Gilmore Girls audience) it probably would have done a lot better.  As it is, I'm glad we got a full three seasons, so many shows I love go away after a single season, or less (Firefly got half a season, Mission Hill had one, Freaks and Geeks had one, Sports Night only had two, etc.).  I just wish there had been a few commentaries or ""making of"" features included, I'm a sucker for behind the scenes insights (there are some of these on the second season set).",1193702400,,996,4.327956989247312

2377162,5,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars ended before it's time.  Killed off by poor ratings and a Pussycat Dolls reality show, VM was one of the smartest and best shows on television during it's three year run.  Like most great shows with a short run, VM will likely only gain in stature as people begin to realize what they were missing.  Complex shows like this are best viewed in DVD format anyway, and it's must that you start at the beginning.

VM starts off in the aftermath of  three life changing events for it's title character, played to perfection by Kristen Bell.  Her best friend Lilly Kane was murdered, she was raped at a party, and her mother took off when her father investigated the popular, rich, and influential Kane family.  Keith lost his job as sheriff, and Veronica loses her boyfriend Duncan Kane and all her friends.  She enters her third year of high school as an outcast, working for her PI dad and taking cases from students for extra cash on the side.

There are three reasons why this DVD collection is a must own.
1.  The storyline.  VM is structured a lot like Buffy, with a mystery of the week and one over reaching storyline.  The mystery of the week stories are generally well done, with a couple that are kind of unbelievable and convoluted.  But the the major mystery of Lilly Kane's death makes this show a compulsive watch.  There are plenty of details and twists that keep your attention and add suspense.

2.  The writing.  VM is one of wittiest and funny shows i've seen in a while.  Veronica has a sharp tongue and all of her friends are also deadly clever, Logan Ecchols in particular.  You'll be quoting lines for a while.

3.  The performances.  Kristen Bell is spot on as Veronica.  Her character is very nuanced.  She manages to be tough, indepedent, loving, and fragile all at the same time.  It's no wonder why she's such a hot commodity now.  Enrico Colantoni is great as Keith Mars, Veronica's father, and former sheriff turned PI.  The loving relationship between Veronica and Keith is one of the best parts of the show.  One of the most surprising characters is Logan, a son of a famous movie star who seems to be nothing but a anti-social jerk, but turns out to a much more complex and emotional character than he appears.  That's not even mentioning Percy Daggs and Francis Capra, both are great as Wallace and Weevil respectively.

But that being said, VM is not perfect.  There are plenty of moments that seem downright convienent and unbelievable.  The first thing that springs to mind is Wallace working in the attendance office.  Thank goodness for that, because without Wallace Veronica would not have access to countless permanent records.  I'm surprised she never got caught with one because she basically reads them out in the open.  Second is the flashback scenes.  During the flashback scenes Veronica dresses like a librarian, has long hair, and is basically a typical teenage girl.  But in a year she turns from ditzy blonde in to a female Phillip Marlowe.  It's a little unbelievable.

But honestly, those complaints really don't matter because the good points far outweigh the bad.  If your a fan of Buffy, or just good TV, pick this DVD set up.  It's addicting.  The next thing you know you'll have watched all of these episodes and you'll be fiending for season two.",1188259200,3,3314,4.662629757785467
2377163,5,B000A59PMO,"The season starts off with Veronica Mars' best friend Lily Kane is murdered. Veronica decides to become a dective to find out who did it.

I love Veronica's personality because she doesn't care what other people think of her and shes not afraid to speak her mind. She always has to crack a joke about everything.

I gave it 5 stars because it's a funny, interesting, laugh out loud tv series. It will make you want to watch show after show to disc after disc.",1188000000,,459,4.3882352941176475
2377164,5,B000A59PMO,"This show rocks (including the kick-a** theme song, ""We Used To Be Friends"").  After Gilmore Girls, this show boasts some of the wittiest, fastest-paced dialogue on network TV.  I am a newcomer to Veronica Mars and now an acolyte (thank you, Family Video for sparing me the financial burden of purchasing yet another TV series).  Always a fan of mysteries (provided they aren't too Hannibal Lecter), I can get my fill of whodunits with V. M.'s  neverending subplots and overarching mystery, the as-of-yet inexplicable death of Lilly, Veronica's best friend.

I love how clever and confident Veronica is. Also, what a role model for multitasking! I especially like that Veronica doesn't take anyone's garbage--I certainly could learn that lesson from Ms. Mars. (Kristen Bell is a fellow Michigander who grew up only a few hours from my hometown.) The guy who plays Logan is kinda cute (okay, he's bona fide hot, though probably eight years my junior), and I'm glad that his character becomes a better person, or at least a more dynamic person who's rendered sympathetically, towards the end of the first season (though I cringed and was embarrassed for him during the earlier episodes when he said one insensitive, politically incorrect thing after another).

Lilly's ghost gives tips and clues to the otherwise hallucinating Veronica and Duncan, Lilly's brother (and possibly, Veronica's half-brother whom Veronica used to date; way too Flowers in the Attic/V.C. Andrews, but hey, Abraham and Sarah were half-brother and sister, too).

Wallace is a cool, resourceful young man whom Veroncia is the first to befriend and rescue from a cruel, retaliatory prank, and the two outsiders infiltrate the masterminds of high school and local petty (and not-so-petty) crime.

We see for ourselves on Veronica Mars how people's personalities can drastically alter when they are slipped drugs in their drinks (Veronica) or go off their poorly tolerated meds cold-turkey (Duncan). This show sensitively handled how this brain-chemistry alteration can affect a person's behavior and that the said person is not to be blamed, a point I wouldn't mind pressing with the general public.

(In the second disc of season one in the episode, ""The Girl Next Door,"" there is a young woman (Jessica Chastain) who is a dead ringer for yours truly and her character's name is also Sarah.  That was a little uncanny but kinda cool.)",1187568000,,2405,5.112244897959184

2377188,5,B000A59PMO,"I have only recently gotten into Veronica Mars.  I happened to catch most of the third (and last) season and have now rented and seen the first two.  I was disappointed to hear that it has been cancelled.  It's a very unique, witty, and highly addictive series.  The first season introduces us to sassy Veronica who has recently been unceremoniously dumped by her high-class boyfriend Duncan; her best friend, Lilly, has been murdered; her father was ousted as sheriff; and she was sexually assaulted.  Geez!!That's a LOT for anyone to deal with.

She's going into her junior year of high school pretty much alone, an outcast from the rest of her classmates.  That is until Wallace shows up, a new kid to Neptune- he isn't aware of her ""sordid"" past and comes to like Veronica for who she really is.  The chemistry between Veronica and Wallace is fun to watch- they really come off as great friends, and show a lot of spark and mischief in just a twinkle of the eye.  The same is true with Veronica and her father, Keith, now a private investigator.  They have a very unique father-daughter relationship.  I'm kinda jealous... They have great rapport- their conversations are always fun, playfully combative and witty banter, the dad is funny/silly/goofball but ultimately cares for and protects Veronica.

The season is a fun, roller coaster ride of mystery, intrigue, romance, friendship, and ""normal"" high school drama.  My one complaint is how something is mentioned or happens and then is not resolved (or even brought up again) until a few episodes later.  The season ends on a very suspenseful, stressful, and hugely climactic note.  I couldn't wait to get my hands on season two.  A wonderfully entertaining show that unfortunately was cut short way too soon.

It's amazing how much can happen from four little words- ""I need your help"" and how many times Veronica hears them.  But also how many times Wallace (who works in the school office) hears ""I need a favor."" lol...

2377192,5,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars is by far one of the most addictive & original teen shows on TV right now.

The first season is simply amazing & gripping.

Must-have for fans of all teen shows & fans of invenstigation shows!

Nothing more to say, an amazing show.",1180742400,,245,4.4
2377193,5,B000A59PMO,"Here's a clue about how smart and cool this show is.  At the end of season 2, the fans of this show didn't know whether it would be picked up by the new CW network.  But the writers gave us a clever hint when one of the characters named ""Clarence Wiedman"" calls another character who picks up the phone and says ""CW?"" to which Clarence responds ""it's a go"".

The narrator is Veronica, a teenager who has had a tough year during which her best friend was murdered, her boyfriend dumped her, her dad lost his job and her mom left town.  Veronica's story has arcs that last the whole season - the mystery of who killed her friend, why her boyfriend and her mom left her, etc.. - and mysteries that she solves in each episode.

The stories involve characters of different races and, most importantly on this show, economic backgrounds.  The show isn't color-blind, but it's money, not color, that matters in the relationships between characters.  All of the characters have flaws and redeeming qualities.  Veronica's warm relationship with her dad is one of tv's best.  It's what makes it believable that Veronica has survived all of the turmoil of the last year with her sense of humor intact.

One thing to keep in mind while you're watching:  Some of the secondary characters that seem like they might be just ""story of the week"" characters do come back later in the season, so pay attention (especially to Logan and to Meg).

The episodes must be watched in order.  Season 1 is the best of the three seasons, but beware that, at the end of Season 1, you are going to want to have the start of Season 2 ready to go!",1179446400,4,1614,4.467576791808874

All issues are handled tastefully and never crude or over the top.  This is an excellent show for any young person lacking confidence, struggling or just being a normal kid.

How can shows this great be cancelled so prematurely when garbage continues to make it on the other networks. If the CW wants to make it, they need to wake up and start promoting some of the excellent shows they have. Veronica needs to be moved, possibly pairing it up with Smallville would be a great move. This show needs to be saved, it is one of the best written and witty shows I have watched in a long time. The first season blew me away, I am 37 years old and I can tell you this show is not just for the younger crowd.

The season tracks Veronica's investigation of the murder of her best friend, Lily Kane, as she also delves into major sub-mysteries revolving around her runaway mother, her relationship with her ex-boyfriend, her paternity, and the identity of her rapist, all of which are smoothly advanced as Veronica deals with a much smaller mystery for a friend or client each episode.  Rob Thomas' stories effortlessly pace the development of all mysteries big and small; the weekly mysteries are typically light and relatively simple, the larger mysteries are intriguing and surprising, and the search for Lily's killer is exciting all the way up until its heart-stopping revelation and conclusion.  The show constantly defies expectations, as there are enough plausible explanations for the events in Neptune to keep even the best amateur sleuth in suspense.

I bought Veronica Mars after hearing it was a lot like Buffy, and that Buffy/Angel creator Joss Whedon was obsessed.  I'd just finished the seventh season of Buffy, so I needed a new fix.  ""Veronica Mars"" turned out to be anything but a Buffy rebound.  I love this show--not as MUCH as Buffy, mind you--and it stands completely on its own two feet, even without the praise of Mr. Whedon.

The characters and their relationships are extremely emotionally investing, and the story arc draws you in a little at a time.  Everything unfolds perfectly, each episode solving its own mystery while adding to the arc at the same time.  The climatic final episode is an extreme payoff for all those who stuck with the season from the beginning.

Witty and heart-warming, Veronica Mars is an A+ show.  And it better not get cancelled.

It is hiding out on the new CW and could really use your support. I am a graduate student who has a pension for Buffy the Vampire Slayer and other intelligent shows. The premise of Veronica Mars at first sounded dumb, and the commercials didn't sell me.

2377246,5,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars is about a girl who is about 10 times smarter, sharp witted, and drama filled than anyone else around her, (not to mention she is 10 times prettier than everyone else).  She never fails to deliver a quick witted response to peoples slanders against her.  There is no case to hard, no villain to horrific, no relationship too broken to knock her off her feet.  The show is basically about a murder involving her best friend.  The mystery holds well, as do all the cases-of-the-week which never fail to involve great amounts of thought, no matter how silly the are.  The writing is as sharp as Kristen Bell's performance.  She can go from innocent teen one moment, to sarcastic know it all the next, to bubble head the next, to broken hearted girl on her own with an amazing ease.  The only problem with the show in general are the relationship plot lines.

Beware of spoiler:
The Logan, Duncan, police man triangle is very weak, especially the break up scenes with the police man.  They way that is resolved makes this show almost of 4 star show.  I have never in my life seen such a terrible resolve.  On the other hand, the Logan relationship is bizarre and never really is believable.  Veronica and Logan have chemistry, but not in a romantic way.  Their chemistry is from the contestant arguing.  Duncan and Veronica have a mild but believable chemistry.  The policeman, who gets very little screen time, seems to be the one that she has the most chemistry with, making is almost impossible to believe that she would dump him.

end of spoiler

with that downfall, the show still gets a five stars because of the great season finale.  The guilty person is not the one I would have ever thought it was, and the cliff hanger, while a little set-up-for-next-seasons-mystery less, is not all that bad.

It makes it that much more exciting not knowing what is going to happen. Let me tell you this is one great show to watch on dvd. You'll have a hard time taking your eyes off the screen for so many reasons.

First, my number one reason, is Kristen Bell. She plays her character, Veronica Mars, absolutely fantastic. Interesting, witty, smart, sexy, creative etc. you name it she's got it. Possibly one of my favorite new tv characters.

Second is the excellent writing. I never once questioned any of Veronica's dialogue, actions, expressions, anything. She plays the heck out of that character and they write her a perfect script. The interaction between the cast is fantastic and so may plot twists but all very believeable.

The season progresses nicely and leads to a great season finale as well as a season ending cliffhanger that makes me anxious for season 2.

If you appreciate great acting, great writing, and a great cast I highly reccomend this show. Kristen Bell alone would make this show excellent, but with every aspect top notch, this is a must see.",1166572800,2,1219,4.6036866359447

The greatest thing about this DVD set however is that it does a nice job of wrapping itself up at the end.  There is a nice little cliffhanger on the last disc to get you into season two, but by the end of it, you'll know who killed Lily.

I believe the writers pointed out that they were inspired a bit by Twin Peaks but unlike Twin Peaks they realized they had to actually give the audience an ending every now and again lest we all become bitter and frustrated and disinterested.

It's one of the best tv shows I've seen.  I cancelled my cable years ago because nothing good is ever on and the only thing I regret is that it means I have to wait for Veronica Mars to come out on DVD.  Still, she's worth the wait.

2377288,2,B000A59PMO,"I had thought that ""Veronica Mars"" (VM) might be a good replacement for ""Alias"" in our family DVD viewing. My two children, ages 9 & 11, have been really into Alias (we're currently in season 2), but occasionally their mother and I worry about the level of violence. I was impressed by the generally high ratings that Amazon reviewers have given VM, and all the positive remarks here about how intelligent the show is. So I bought the first season of VM, and this evening we started watching...

After five minutes, I told my children, ""sorry, but this is crap"". They wanted to watch a bit more, so we ended up watching about 20 mins total. The children agreed with me then that we should quit VM, and instead watch another episode of Alias. Later, I told them I was going to sell the VM season ASAP. No complaints.

My critique of VM:

The show's writing is indeed sophisticated, as so many reviewers here have celebrated. But what VM's writers achieved, at least to me, is a super-phony effect: a 16-year old girl channeling  1940's era big-screen detectives. The voice-over narration by the teen detective doesn't sound real, and is also sexually edgy in a way that I found completely fake and also inappropriate for my pre-teens (for example, Veronica's deadpan comment during a stakeout about needing to get the ""money shot"" on film).

In those first 20 minutes that we watched, the story cut very quickly from one scene to the next. Veronica narrated the action in great detail, with the same toughness of character that viewers of old detective movies will instantly recognize. It was almost like listening to a story being read. To quote a phrase though, I didn't buy it. The scenes we saw had no depth or originality, and there wasn't anything special about any of the acting, either.

In short, I got the vibe that VM is junk TV, and wouldn't recommend it for any age.",1160524800,7,1878,4.641566265060241

2377291,5,B000A59PMO,"It's a credit to this show that viewers have posted lots of detailed raves and other enthusiastic comments here on Amazon, so I think I'll add just a brief paragraph or two with my own two cents.  After all, it's the show you should be immersing yourself into, not just the reviews of it.  So I won't keep you long.

""Veronica Mars, Season One"" delivers a batch of clever and hearfelt episodes, with not a clunker in the bunch.  Each episode, in addition to delivering some great character stuff, does two things: gives you an entertaining stand-alone story featuring Veronica taking on a P.I. type case, and 2) advances the season-long arc detailing Veronica's investigation into the death of her best friend, Lilly Kane.  Also, to keep viewers from getting too comfortable with the construction of the show, there are also a couple of ""mini arcs"" throughout the season, where Veronica undertakes some longer investigations that compete in importance with the investigation of her friend's death.

I liked the way these season-one episodes played fair and actually gave you the clues you need to figure out Lilly Kane's killer, who is revealed in the excellent final episode of this set.  By the way, here's a teeny, tiny mini-spoiler that won't give away anything big but might make you enjoy the show even more:  when trying to figure out who killed Lilly, don't just pay attention to the ""official"" clues discovered during Veronica's investigation of her friend's death; also pay attention to the things you see during the course of the stand-alone stories.  There's info to be mined there!  Nuff said on that score.

I loved the close relationship between Veronica and her dad, the daring nature of some of the things that happen to Veronica, the clever banter that is almost never too clever for its own good, and the way that the show respects viewers enough to believe that they can keep up!  In other words, each little mystery is solved and explained, but the solution isn't spoon fed to you.  You sometimes have to pay attention as the solutions are quickly rattled off so the show can get back to what it's really passionate about, namely the character stuff.

Oh, well... I seem to be falling into the trap of so many other reviewers here, and keep going on and on about ""Veronica Mars"".  Let me just conclude by saying that I picked up season one of this program on DVD after Stephen King raved about the show in one of his Entertainment Weekly columns.  Stephen was right.  And I'm onboard for season two.",1159747200,5,2520,4.743119266055046
2377292,5,B000A59PMO,"Ah, where to start? It's not easy to pigeonhole Veronica Mars, the series. This quirky show from UPN contains elements of the procedural detective mystery, high school/family drama, and the soap opera show, as well as a season-long conspiracy plotline. While this series was engrossing to watch on a televised schedule, this 6-dvd package enriches the viewing experience even more. Not only are the dvds not encumbered with commercials, but there's a more defined sense of immediacy and coherence as you watch multiple episodes in a row, allowing you to soak in more of the show's nuances and plot progressions. The viewer profits from the show's tendency to smoothly mesh ongoing story arcs from episode to episode, building up the season's main storyline and adding more texture to the lesser subplots. Veronica Mars boasts a continuing, season-long murder mystery, great acting and plotting, and comprehensive character development. The series debut and ensuing shows incorporate effective flashback scenes, chronicling Veronica's prior Cinderella life from a year before, which culminate with the shocking murder of her best friend Lilly Kane and Veronica's resulting ostracism by her high school peers.

Veronica (Kristen Bell) becomes an assistant to her ex-sheriff father, Keith Mars (the awesome Enrico Colantoni), in his newly formed private detective agency, and she proves to be a resourceful and dogged clue chaser in her own right. She hasn't at all forgotten the brutal slaying of her best friend and means to ultimately rip apart that convoluted veil of conspiracy. Every episode seems to introduce new clues to Lilly's death and progressively finds our sleuth inching ever closer to unearthing the murderer (making it hard for you to miss even one show). The payoff is in Season One's final episode, in which the mystery of Lilly's murder is finally resolved. Meanwhile, she handles the more mundane cases involving credit card fraud, missing persons, a missing high school parrot mascot, a runaway dog, a stolen BMW, a cult, etc. All that, as she continues to transition from living the life of the haves to the life of the have-nots, and while also suffering the woes and pressures of high school life.

The show is elevated with that rare grouping of brilliant writing, sensitive directing, and gifted acting. The acting, in particular, is augmented by the talents of Kristen Bell, Enrico Colantoni, and Jason Dohring. I find their respective characters to be the most developed and the most intriguing. The father-daughter relationship between Veronica and her cool dad Keith is truly wonderful to behold and so enjoyable to watch. And, while I initially disliked the angry, sarcastic, mean-spirited Logan Echolls, Jason Dohring invests his role with so many layers that he very quickly becomes one of the show's most interesting characters. Besides, Dohring has a screen presence that cannot be denied, although he does look like a bitter Peyton Manning. Kristen Bell, of course, propels the show. She effortlessly delivers with a plucky and ironic take on her role that makes Veronica Mars seem simultaneously tough and vulnerable, while being also incredibly resourceful, smart, and sexy. Yeah, I know - that's a lot of adjectives, but they all fit, yes? Even the lesser characters are given ample spotlight. Percy Daggs III (Wallace, Veronica's best bud), Francis Capra (Weevil, likable thug from the wrong side of town), and Harry Hamlin (Aaron Echolls, Logan's movie star dad) all make hefty contributions. But, with all the wrenching, dramatic scenes that went on in this season, my favorite moment still is Veronica doing karaoke, which is a nod to Kristen Bell's multi-faceted skills.

Not much in the way of special features here: a tiny booklet summarizing the Season One episodes, over 20 minutes of unaired scenes, and an extended version of the pilot episode with an unaired opening sequence.

So, what do we have in the Veronica Mars series? Well, it offers savage high school politics and power plays, the juxtaposed lifestyles of the priveleged and the not-so-priveleged, topical teenager problems, interesting subplots, sparkling dialogue, wicked one-liners, and rich, perfectly nuanced performances. It also offers a young girl who had been kicked to the curb but who stands up for herself and her father and who will never take flak from anyone. Following in the footsteps of Buffy the Vampire Slayer in terms of its edgy high school sensibilities (with Bell matching Sarah Michelle Gellar in the petite, cute, and dry-humored heroine department) and borrowing from David Lynch in its prevailing Twin Peaks-styled mystery, Veronica Mars: The Complete First Season is addictive watching, with several messages to impart. And I even like the theme song.",1159660800,2,4791,5.242503259452412

i have been this excited about a show since buffy & miami vice!!

it keeps you wanting more and teases you at the end of each episode

and your like ""AWWWWWW COM' ON!! DAM!! (i hate when shows do that)

but it keeps you watching though,thats the formula of this show!

its VERY ADDICTIVE!! and she's a cutie pie too!",1159142400,,347,4.276923076923077
2377294,5,B000A59PMO,"I don't think I've ever gotten into a show as soon as it premiered. Literally all my DVD sets are shows that aired long before I decided to check them out and through word of mouth you find out about the other ones. How did Veronica Mars come out? Mainly from people who were into Arrested Development, Lost and Smallville which I'm into already. Due to a non-supply and demand issue we didn't have season 1 but I got into season 2 and finally got a chance to watch season 1. It's a pretty strong season that's marred probably by a sense of build-up.

Taking place in a town called Neptune in California, high school student/super-sleuth Veronica Mars is not having a good year: her best friend, Lilly Kane, was murdered. Her dad, Keith Mars and sheriff at the time, had his job taken away when he went after Lilly's father as a suspect and Veronica had been drugged and raped at a party. While the murder/rape are the main season arcs, there's also little cases peppered throughout the season such as the kidnapping of a mascot, blackmail and parental disappearances.

It's strange but looking back on the season, I actually at times forgot what was in each episode. Sure I remember that scene where Veronica found out some important thing but for the life of me I couldn't tell you what episode it was. So in a weird way the show benefits from being watched start to finish but it's not like random click and go where you can watch whatever episode you felt like seeing. It's not a problem for the show but it is something I noticed, as well as with the second season.

Despite the fact that there's a lot of main characters, there's not a whole lot of development for them save a couple. While I'm not attacking their acting abilities, the Wallace and Duncan characters seem kind of bland. Best friend and former ex respectively, you'd think there'd be a lot more time spent getting to know them and get backstory but they're mainly there to serve the plot at that time. However of course we have Kristen Bell as the titular character, smart and sassy yet emotional. Jason Dohring is quite the one-liner man has he's quite the likable and charismatic guy Logan and Enrico Colantoli is arguably one of the best TV dad's who can be wise-cracking and caring yet tough and protective without being overbearing.

While the main arc of the murder is intriguing, the way it's presented is that it doesn't have that kind of rising action aspect of storytelling where you feel things starting to get more fast paced and climactic, instead saving it for the big finale. While the series doesn't limp towards the last episode for the season, it does feel like the episodes don't start to get compelling as you're going along but rather the feeling that just the fact you're nearing the end is compelling, not the unfolding of the story.

While it does look like I have a problem with this season, it's actually cause I mainly said negatives. It's a very intriguing and addictive show although I don't like its free-reign writing. Certain characters almost turn evil/good at the drop of a hat while the rape storyline which was ""solved"" here, is actually debunked and we find out the truth. However, you should definately pick this one up.",1158364800,,3230,4.610434782608696
2377295,5,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars is absolutely brilliant. I thought that all hope was lost in television after Joss Whedon moved into the movie buisness, but now there is a show created by this guy Rob Thomas and it's every bit as good as the wonderful, witty, well thought out classics, Buffy, Angel and Firefly.
When the show first aired here in Iceland, last year (2005) I missed the first episode, saw the second and the third but was I was still sort of clueless. I had heard good things about the show and ended up buying the whole series on DVD from the US, where it was allready out, instead of trying to watch it every week on the Icelandic Public Network (with its ever loving ""airing-womens-socker-instead-of-Veronica Mars"" management). After putting the first disk in my DVD I was hooked and couldn't stop until the season was finished. The characters, the plot, the dialouge, the cast, everything is brilliant.
So Veronica Mars is a highschool girl, working part-time for ther PI father. She is trying to get on with her life after the murder of her best friend which resulted in her being kicked out of her social circle and pretty much becoming the most bad mouthed person in school. She spends her time solving mysteries for her classmates while ultimately trying to figure out who killed her best friend.
I love Veronica, she is so clever. I used to get picked on in school, oh so many years ago, and now my only wish is that I could have handled it like her, being all witty and sassy and taking matters into my own hands. And I love all the guys around her. Wallace her only friend, Weevil the motorcycle gangleeder, Duncan the ex-boyfried, Keith Mars her father... I think my father is a great guy but Keith still sort of knocks him dead, and last but not least Logan Echolls the obligatory psychotic jackass.",1158105600,2,1810,4.589506172839506
2377296,5,B000A59PMO,"Wait a minute. Hold on a sec. UPN has a brilliant show?. Is that allowed?. Veronica Mars is the best thing to ever hit UPN in that network's 11 years(not counting when Buffy transfered over, since it was a WB show). Kristen Bell stars as the title character, and she is a major find. What an absolute gem. I doubt the show would be as good if it were someone else. She is Veronica. Just like Sarah Michelle Geller is Buffy. Set in the California town of Neptune, Veronica Mars deals with our young high school heroine solving the towns' biggest mysteries, along with her detective father, Keith Mars(Enrico Collantoni of ""Just Shoot Me"" fame). The biggest mystery of all is the season long story arc. Who killed Veronica's best friend, Lily Kane?. It's a brilliant whodunit wrapped around intiguing, fully dimensional characters with whip smart dialogue, and teriffic humor. Rounding out the show is Veronica's best friend Wallace, Ex-boyfriend and Lily's brother Duncan Kane(Teddy Dunn), school bully Weevil(Francis Capra), and Lily's boyfriend Logan Echolls(Jason Dohring). Harry Hamlin has a season long recurring guest role, and Buffy vet Alyson Hannigan pops up as Logan's sister. Rob Thomas(not THAT Rob Thomas), is a gifted writer with a strong sense of story and detail. The show, as he writes is, is wonderfully fleshed out and visualized. The show having it's own unique and color scheme. The acting is great all around. Dohring is another great find along with Bell. The ""Pilot"" sets everything up so beautifully. It seamlessly brings you up to date, via flashbacks, of what has brought Veronica and her father to the place they are in now, and sets everything up the way it is now. Other top notch episodes(in a season with nary a bad episode)include the finale, ""Leave It To Beaver"", ""A Trip To The Dentist"", and so on. Quite frankly, there's too many to mention here. But back to Bell. She has such an easy way with a scene and a quip, and she has such a relatable beauty to her. I never thought anyone could match my Ms. Geller, but I think Bell may be the one to challenge that. It's a shame that the show is so low rated. It deserves a bigger audience. It deserves your time in front of the tube. It definitley deserves success on the new CW network, where it will air after Gilmore Girls. Folks, visit Neptune.

2377312,4,B000A59PMO,"I caught a few episodes of Veronica Mars when it first aired, but like many shows these days, you really have to watch the entire thing to appreciate the serialized arcs and season-long plot threads involved. Luckily, when this DVD set came out, I was able to, and I enjoyed it quite a lot a bit.

Many people proclaimed this show the ""next Buffy"", but it's really the ""first Veronica Mars"". To set up, Veronica is the daughter of PI who both helps her father out on cases between classes, and runs her own cases whenever she can get away with it. The is one main over-arching mystery in the season, and many smaller ones (including the ""case of the week""). Many of the episodes were excellent and even the ones which weren't as good, once I'd watched the whole season, turned out to reveal important little elements and steps towards the grand finale.

The story (and mystery), however, wasn't what interested me most. It was the characters. Episode by episode, Veronica, Keith, Logan, Mac, and a few others grew on me in a way few characters in others shows have. A combination of great writing and delivery really brought them to life, and made the show truly something special, and head-and-shoulders above most of the other programming on TV.",1155686400,7,1247,4.663636363636364
2377313,5,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars has become a cult hit over the course of two seasons. If you watch the DVD, it's not hard to see why. This is intelligent, well written fare with fantastic acting, particularly from Kristin Bell, whose portrayal of teenage private-eye Veronica Mars is kind of astoundingly good. Each tightly plotted episode of the 22-episode first season hooks you with its own mini-mystery. But it's the season-long mystery (which gets a satisfying resolution in the season finale), that will keep you glued to the screen.

Don't be deterred by the somewhat silly sounding premise, or this show's label as a teen drama (on UPN, no less). Veronica Mars is a quirky drama, free of soap opera teen love stories, that adults as well as teens can enjoy. (The DVD set, unfortunately, is not as spectacular. Aside from some deleted scenes, there are no special features worth mentioning.)",1155340800,2,880,4.945945945945946

2377331,5,B000A59PMO,"I first heard of a television show called 'Veronica Mars' in an interview with Joss Whedon in which he declared it his favourite t.v. show.  Anything that Joss Whedon the master of great televison, gets excited about is surely worth checking out.  Over here in England Veronica Mars is not that well known.  It should be because it is a consistently brilliant series.

  Veronica Mars is a really cool show with lots of great dialogue, some awesome twists in the overall narrative arch and a lead heroine who is just an absolute hottie.  The only quibble I have with the show, and its a problem I have with most American television shows, is the fact that all the High School kids look at least 25 years old.  It's a shame because suspension of disbelief is quite hard.  Veronica herself barely passes the test, but I'll let it go for the sake of a good story and some awesome dialogue.

  The first season sees Veronica trying to find out who killed her best friend Lily Kane.  There's tonnes of other stuff in there too, from High School cults to teachers accused of sexual misconduct.  There are some cool cameos from the likes of Alyson Hannigan and Chris Klein, but come on...Paris Hilton, that was another low point in an otherwise great show.

I was a latecomer to the world of lovely Ms Mars. I had seen Joss Whedon talking about it on Whedonesque and even bits here and there about Allyson Hannigan being on the show once and awhile but still I stayed away. UPN? I wasn't even sure what number it might be on my cable list? Surely, it's not a marked favorite channel on my Tivo! Then CBS decided to air two episodes back to back on primetime. So I watched and... man was I wrong! Here's this great show, this weekly mystery novel in TV format that leaves me breathless and eager for the next episode. Noir ala high school. Like Buffy with Horror ala high school, VM gets into the drama of what it's like to be a teenager and much, much more. And VM has drama. It has sweeping Shakespearian tragedy drama set in a high school. It's also funny and delightfully wicked and clever (hell, it's brilliant) and exciting and... well, people it's what good TV should be.

So why aren't you watching? Here's your chance! Buy first season. Watch it in a few weeks then buy season two (which in many ways is even better than season one - like Alias Season 2 to the first year) and watch Season Three when it airs in September. You will be able to watch and enjoy VM, gloat over others who don't, and go online and geek out with the rest of us VMers.

I have to say I am so upset I did not discover this show until going into it's thrid season.  After watching season 1 on DVD I then ordered myself a copy of amazon so that i would have it to watch over and over again until the copy I ordered of Season 2 comes out at the end of August.

This show really is a buffy and nancy drew meets OC. It contains the highschool drama, romance, mystery, twists, and excitement. Veronica is very witty and intelligent making this show amazing! Aside from the season long mystery that veronica is always working on, each individual episode has a mini mystery that is solved by the end of the episode. On top of all that you are following the lives of veronica, her friends, boyfriend/ex-boyfriend through highschool, break-ups, suicide, and murder.

Imagine how disappointed I was to discover that as the title of my review states the majority is not always right (I wouldn't want to go into the political implications of such an argument especially in democracies but the concept is very well known and accepted).

The show has an interesting beginning showing how the life of a girl was turned upside down because of her father's actions (against a very influential person) and how she was abandon by her surrounding best friends just because she supported her parent.

This concept interested me until the 4th episode that is when I discovered that the plot is unbelievably predictable going through a formula that has been done so many times by many older (and better) shows and as a result all twists can be seen a light year away (this reflected badly on the main and supporting characters since what is the fun in watching a mystery that one figures out half way through the episode).

This failure both in plot and script were a sign that I should stop watching and I have learned from previous experiences to follow these signs because once a show fails to grip its audience (through unpredictable and yet reasonable twists and turns) it ends up being a waste of ones time.

To sum things-up;

Those of you looking for a good mystery look else-where, but for those of you looking for teen drama then this show might be a good choice although there are many better alternatives out there.",1152921600,16,1649,4.610921501706485
2377336,5,B000A59PMO,"When I first heard the basic plot of Veronica Mars, I was not interested.  It sounded mediocre with little possibility for lasting much past Veronica solving her friend's murder mystery.  Then, someone convinced me to watch the 1st disc in the DVD season 1 series.  The show had been wrapping up season two.  The first episode did not impress me.  It almost felt like I was stepping into the show mid season because the character development, plot basics, and expected introduction of characters were missing.  Everything seemed assumed and Veronica was solving a mystery unrelated to her friend's murder.

By the end of that first disc, though, I wanted to know more and could not wait to see disc 2.  Veronica is not just a sassy teenager, with an extraordinary knack for solving mysteries that some seasoned detectives may have trouble with, she is the epitome of female strength.  She is strong, confident, fragile in some spots, but always persevering.  It is her character that drew me in.  I think any female from 14 to 40 could definitely fall in love and in awe of Veronica Mars' character.

By the end of the second disc, I developed characters I liked almost as much as Veronica and I was hooked!  The characters take some time to get to know and they are very real with many dimensions.  One character, Logan Echols, surprised me.  Early in, I despised him, now I love him.  There are just so many aspects of Veronica Mars that make this series worth getting hooked on and make it very easy to identify with: the strength and beauty of being female, the love and awesome relationship between father and daughter, the dysfunction of families, the dynamics of upper and lower class, the mysteries that beg to be unraveled, the raw contradictions of love and relationships, the struggle to find oneself while dealing with growing up, and much, much more.

I strongly recommend buying this DVD set.  Be prepared to watch a disc or two before you really love the show and be patient with getting to know the characters.  I think if I had watched the first episode when it was originally aired, I may not have been hooked.  It took sitting through those first two or three episodes back to back to really get into it.  Now, this is my favorite show!  I cannot wait until season 2 comes out next month!!!!  Veronica Mars truly is surprisingly addictive.",1152835200,9,2358,4.683698296836983

2377348,5,B000A59PMO,"""Veronica Mars"" is one of the best shows I've seen in a while.  The writing manages to balance humor, romance, and drama perfectly and the entire cast, down to bit players, is top notch.  As a big fan of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", this show has really filled a void for me in terms of smart, funny, moving shows featuring a strong, engaging central female character.

The DVD of Season 1 is a little disappointing in terms of extras (just a few deleted scenes), but it's great to have all of the episodes collected in one place.  In light of the season-long mystery's conclusion, it's nice to be able to look back for clues you might have missed and it's also interesting to see the season in a different light, given what you know after the finale.",1152316800,3,750,4.452554744525547

2377351,5,B000A59PMO,"I've never seen an episode of VERONICA MARS on television.  It airs on the UPN.  I don't think people near the age of 40 (like me) are allowed to watch that network.

After hearing my neighbor, a colleague and a relative talking about the show all in the same week, I decided I needed to buy Season One on DVD.  The pilot was cute enough, with clever plot twists and some satisfying resolutions to the conflicts that arose.

TV series tend to do one of two things following their pilots -- they get worse or they get better.  Very few seem to be able to accomplish the latter.  VERONICA MARS is one that actually continued to get better throughout the entire first season.  Characters developed, plots became more compelling, and the writers seemed to find a rhythm that really works for the show.

Any while it does deal a lot with the angst of teenage life (high school, boyfriends, popularity, and so on), it also deals with far more adult subjects like rape, coping with death, abandonment issues and single parenting.

Each episode has Veronica solving little mysteries for friends or schoolmates, but running throughout the entire season are questions about who killed her best friend Lily, and what happened to Veronica's mother, who disappeared shortly after Lily's death.  These season-long story arcs owe a lot to shows like ALIAS and 24, and they keep VERONICA MARS nearly as compelling as those shows.

So even if you think this is a ""teenage"" show, I'd recommend that you give it a chance.  You'll be surprised!",1150329600,5,1524,4.7272727272727275
2377352,4,B000A59PMO,"I have been a fan of Veronica Mars since she uttered the words ""Go Pirates!"" in the season one premiere. Like many of the reviews here have already stated, the show is excellent. Writing, plots, balance of comedy and drama, all are great. If you have not watched the show you, should tune in to the CW this fall and watch season three. You cannot go wrong watching this show. I think USA Weekend Magazine said it best: Veronica Mars is ""Nancy Drew-meets-90210 drama"".

However, I cannot state as much for the DVD set for season one. It leaves a lot to be desired, particularly in the special features section. But it is still a good value for any fan wanting to catch up or simply add this to their collection.

The box itself is a beautiful box (pictures provided by yours truly). It's thinner than most six-disc sets. The DVD holder that the box contains has the same picture as the outside of the box.

It unfolds like a book, two panels facing you, with some Veronica snapshots and some small quotes from reviews of the show. Each side then flips open once again, so you have all four panels facing you at once (not like many sets, which turn like pages of a book). From left to right the panels contain: (1) the DVD booklet; (2) discs one and two (with Veronica and dad pictured respectively); (3) discs three and four (Logan, then Duncan); (4) and finally disc five and disc six (Wallace then Weevil). So, DVD booklet, then two discs to each remaining box panel. On the panels, if the discs and booklet are removed, there is a wide shot of Neptune High School covering all the panels.

The DVDs themselves are kind of layered over each other. The top disc of each panel covering the bottom half of the bottom disc; so you have to take out the top disc to get the bottom disc.

The DVD booklet is patterned after those old black and white marbled notebooks everyone used to use in highschool. Inside are pictures of the cast and the characters they play. Following that,  are the episodes, with the writer, director and original air date listed. Following that is a small, one-or-two sentence description  of the show. Each page has small snapshots of the characters.

The layout is very nice, and incorporating the highschool student theme into the layout is very nice.

Popping the DVDs into your DVD player (or PC), you get the title menu, then the main menu. It features some funky rock music and the menu options, with a slide show of some shots from the show playing.

The last disc has the one special feature included on the disc, It features just over 22 minutes of unaired scenes. They play as one chapter, in chronological order of the show. Before each scene, the name of the episode it was supposed to appear in flashes on the screen, followed by a title-like quote of what the scene is based on.

There are no complaints about the audio or video quality of the DVDs.

All in all, it is a very nice set, IF you are just buying the DVD set because you are late to viewing the show and need to catch up. If you are buying for special features, you will be disappointed. And if you are buying the box set just because you are supporting the show, then thirty five bucks is not too shabby a price for a dvd set like this.

Lastly, go Pirates!",1149897600,10,3256,4.424749163879599
2377353,5,B000A59PMO,"I was initally forced to watch Veronica Mars: a couple of months ago, my friend said he would loan me the Freaks and Geeks boxset, which I had wanted to watch for a long time. Instead, he brought me Veronica Mars and told me he wouldn't give me F&G until I watched the UPN detective show. Like most, I was skeptical . . . but now, I can't thank him enough.

It took me four days to watch the first season, and I downloaded the second season that had aired until that point and finished watching it as it aired on UPN. The second season was excellent, but this first season is absolutely perfect. The dialogue, the stories, and oh, the ACTING. Kristen Bell is amazing as Veronica, and Jason Dohring, playing Logan Echolls, is absolutely superb. Enrico Catolani as Veronica's father is warm and a perfect ally and foil to his daughter, while Francis Capra's Weevil is the pitch-perfect bad boy with a heart of gold.

The first season follows Veronica's quest to find the murderer of her best friend, Lilly Kane. Helping her along, whether they know it or not, are her father, Logan, Weevil, best friend Wallace (Percy Daggs III), and ex-boyfriend Duncan Kane (Teddy Dunn). But you've probably already read enough plot summaries. My main objective here is to tell you that if you are hesitant to watch, DON'T BE. Buy the season 1 and 2 DVDs and watch season 3 this fall -- this year, it has been given a kinder time slot (Tuesdays at 9:00, immediately following Gilmore Girls), which will hopefully increase viewership.

Veronica Mars is my new favorite show, right under Wonderfalls, the two shows have a lot in common esp. with having a witty, smart heroine.

I watch the first season through the box set which had me hook right away. VM's humor and drama will draw you in, along with the clever ways the writers come up with for Veronica to solve the mysteries. Except for a few common elements, like background checks, after two seasons the show has not been repeative with its mysteries or the ways Veronica solves them.

With Season 1 already out on dvd and The Season 2 boxset coming out this August -- go out and watch this show!!!

This show is original and smart. VM, like Wonderfalls, is so much better than most shows out there and deserves all the support it can get. So please watch this show and I hope, like me, you'll be tuning in for Season 3 on the CW next fall!!

Actually, this is my FIRST review for ANY product on Amazon, and simply put, this is one of the best shows I have seen on television--EVER.  You may have heard it all before: smart, sassy, sexy...and that's just Veronica.  Every character is constructed in detail with complex motivations and emotions; every situation is carefully plotted to fit into an overarching scheme.  The situations are engrossing.  In fact, most of my friends have been hooked after the pilot and 2nd episode alone...and not just casually so, but in an I-need-to-finish-the-season-marathon-DVD-viewing-session-urgently so.  One friend was hooked 3 minutes into an episode in the middle of the season without knowing anything that had happened previously.  Yes, the show really is THAT good.  And my friends have very diverse tastes, ranging from the aforementioned Six Feet Under and Nip/Tuck, to The O.C., Alias, and Chappelle's Show.  If you've never heard of Veronica Mars, rent the first DVD and try it out.  If you've heard anything about this show at all and are just a bit curious, go ahead and take the plunge--buy the series, you won't be sorry.

Here's hoping Veronica makes the 2006 Fall lineup on the new CW network--they've got a potentially huge hit show on their hands, they just need a bigger network than UPN to support it and help it find the audience it deserves.",1146873600,13,1722,4.8231292517006805

The first season deals with these life-altering changes, as well as individual episode mysteries. If this sounds at all interesting, you should check out the show.

2377373,5,B000A59PMO,"I used to read Nancy Drew when I was younger.  Loved watching Smallville, especially when Chloe had a mystery to solve (I love that another reviewer made the same connection as I did, but from another angle).  Now I get to see Veronica Mars, and I love it!  I caught the pilot, and though I had to miss some episodes, I HAD to buy the first season on DVD!  I found out later on as I watched, that I missed A LOT.  So now I'm patiently waiting for the second season to come out.  When I first watched Veronica Mars, my sister would get up and leave the room when I watched it.  Now that I've got it on DVD, she loves it!

What I love about this series is that Veronica has strong family values: she stood by her dad, and searching out for her mother, even when her dad, a private eye himself, had given up hope of trying to find her.  Though she is labeled as an outcast, she has people in ""high"" places: her 09er friend Meg, the PCH biker Weevil, and her best friend/case helper Wallace, to name a select few.  What I happened to like the most was that she had determination and spunk to see her way through everything she pursues, even at her father's exasperation.  I don't want to give anything away (though some reviewers have), in case you haven't watched it.

All you'll get from me is this: the first season, she had a LOT of work to do.  In the second season (watch UPN, folks!), she's tied up in another mystery that she has her work cut out for her (and is in it, by the way), and it's just as good as the first season's big question/case, if not better.",1145059200,5,1564,4.156146179401993

2377395,5,B000A59PMO,"Every new television season, the broadcast networks attempt to overwhelm viewers with a hurricane of hype for their new shows, doing whatever they can to keep more people from jumping over to edgier cable fare.  The result?  All sound and fury, often signifying nothing.  In more recent years, however, network TV has brought the meat, replacing the usual reality show claptrap with smart, well-written dramas and comedies.  What's unfortunate is that some of the best of these shows have gone quietly into the sunset-- cancelled from lack of ratings.  The most recent and notable example would be Arrested Development.  This was almost the fate for perhaps the best and most unheralded show on TV right now-- Veronica Mars.

Luckily, however, UPN realized that it had a special show on its hands, and renewed Mars for a second season.

Much like Buffy the Vampire Slayer before it, Veronica Mars is a show that would likely blow everyone away if it wasn't buried on a smaller network.  The brain behind Buffy himself, Joss Whedon, perhaps describes the show best:

""On the surface, Veronica Mars is a simple Nancy Drew update: High School Girl Solves Mysteries. It's impressive how well it works as just that, because week to week, nothing is harder to pull off than a genuine whodunit, and no show does it better than VM.""

He speaks the truth.  Mars brings everything a viewer can ask for: great writing, engrossing stories, a talented cast, complex character relationships, and, above all, a rewarding experience.

In the first season, Veronica is a high school junior who has had her life ripped out from under her.  In the first episode, we learn that her best friend, Lilly Kane, was murdered the previous year.  Veronica had always enjoyed a priveleged position in her hometown of Neptune-- even though she was not wealthy like most of her friends in the popular crowd, the fact that her father, Keith Mars, was the sheriff, afforded her access to the perks of high society.  This, unfortunately, also proved her downfall.  Keith's investigation into Lilly's murder culminated with the accusation of the girl's widely-beloved father as the culprit.  The resulting fallout was devestating to Veronica's life-- Keith lost his job, Veronica's boyfriend and Lilly's brother, Duncan, broke up with her, and, worst of all, Veronica's mother abruptly disappeared from Neptune.  Top all of this off with the fact that Veronica was later drugged and sexually assaulted at a rich-kid party, and you get the feeling that life could not be worse for Ms. Mars.

Luckily, she handles all the adversity with aplomb.  Now a social outcast, Veronica turns her focus to solving the mysterious circumstances surrounding her friend's death, with a little help from her now-private-investigator father and Neptune newcomer/only friend Wallace Fennel.

The strength of Mars (if you could name just one) is the exceptional talent of both Kristen Bell as Veronica and Enrico Colantoni as Keith, as well as the relationship they share.  As the only two left in Neptune that really believe that the truth is still out there, they only have one another to rely on.  As luck would have it, that's all they need.

But they aren't the only ones in Neptune worth watching.  Percy Daggs III as the aforementioned Wallace brings compassion, understanding, and a bit of comic relief in all the right places.  Jason Dohring as Logan Echolls-- Lilly's grieving boyfriend/Duncan's best friend/Veronica's initial antagonist (I told you the character relationships were complicated, right?)-- alternates between cruel and caring, craven and courageous, and may be the most complex character in recent TV history... which is a compliment.  Teddy Dunn plays Duncan with the right amount of all-American charm and guarded mysteriousness, and Francis Capra offers an outstanding performance as the tough-guy-biker-gang-leader-with-a-heart-of-not-gold-but-at-least-silver Weevil.  Throw in recurring roles from accomplished actors like Harry Hamlin as Logan's famous actor/abusive father Aaron Echolls, and you have to pinch yourself to remember you haven't died and gone to TV heaven.

Some of the best examples of what's right with the small screen have fizzled out after too short of time.  Now that UPN has given Veronica Mars a second chance, don't miss the opporunity to check out the mastery of interweaving plots, intriguing week-to-week mysteries, and high-caliber acting.

I love tv shows and my all time favorite used to be 24. I never thought anything could ever be better than that. Right untill I saw Veronica Mars. Of course it is a completely different genre and all, but it is simply better. At first glance it seems this show is no different then, say, the OC or all the other teen-shows. But only the setting is the same. A highschool and a small tomn where the middle-class doesn`t exist. But everything else in Veronica Mars is very very different. The heroine is a high school girl with uncanny abilities as a PI and an attitude like nothing you`ve ever seen. She really is a lot like the Bogart tipe of noir PI and not a Nancy Drew kind of ideological innocent girl. The show itself is full of sarcasm, irony, darkness and most of all, pain. That is the main reason it is as good as it is. It is most fascinating how it can remain actually optimistic and even jolly despite the amount of pain in it. It is a lot like Buffy the vampire slayer in this aspect. The main plot which extends through the whole season is a murder investigation of ""who killed Lilly Kane?"", kind of like the ""who killed Laura Palmer?"" in Twin Peaks. There is a smaller mistery in every episode. This is the other main reason this show is excellent; the smaller misteries are actually small, like e-mail fraud or stolen money at a poker game (not like every other investigation tv show, where there`s nothing but murder or rape), and yet, these misteries are just as interestingly done here as the serious ones in other shows. The DVD itself is quite good, picture quality is solid. There isn`t a big variety of bonus material, only deleted scenes, but there are a whole bunch of those.

Truly amazing show with brilliant and extremely believable actors, and an extremely enthralling season mystery to tie things up.

Kudos to Rob Thomas and everybody in the VM team!

2377415,5,B000A59PMO,"In an age of trite remakes, Veronica Mars looks to be just a modern rendition of Nancy Drew, with an added contemporary teen show element and maybe a few silly attempts at 'edgy'. (Aw, look Nancy's trying on Phillip Marlowe's trenchcoat! How adorable!) But once one watches this gem of a show, it's suprising to find out that VM is one of the most heartbreaking, intellegent, snarky shows around, much more in the spirit of Chinatown and other noir in  style and substance than Nancy.

Filled with suprises that will kick you in the gut, rich well-rounded characters (even down to the tertiary pool), crisp, quoteable dialouge, and one of the most refreshing and complex heriones around (played by one of the handful of  stunning  young actresses to hit the small screen in quite a while), Veronica Mars is simply a delightful television show that goes above and beyond that title. Veronica's world isn't just a guilty pleasure escape haven to not think about your homework or finaces for an hour, it's a world that's admitable not our own (one where billionares attend the local public high school along with a 60's style biker gang) but still deeply inticing and 'real' in all of it's absurdity.

 Much in the same way, the title character Veronica is extraordinary. She's smart, reasourceful, snarky, fearless, gorgeous, and always with a witty response on the tip of her tongue ( a cute boy walks up as she's trying to fix her cat ""flat?"" Veronica, ""Just as God made me.""). But most of all she's tainted and tattered at heart. All of these characteristics that make her seem like the most overzealous super girl have come to her by tragedy and pain. Kristen Bell wonderfully confeys the heartbreak of Veronica without turing her a pity party or an annoyance, but instead making her flawed in all the right spots. After having sexual comments thrown her way by the local biker gang leader, Veronica (via one very noir style VO), with the slightest bit of pain in her eye: ""Quite the reputation I've got, huh? You wanna know how I lost my virginity? So do I.""

It's in these words, we know that this isn't your average teen girl on your average teen show. Hell, it's within the second scene of ""The Pilot"", when Veronica lays her head down and looks subtly crushed  as a teacher gives her take on ""An Essay On Man: Epistle One"" that its clear she's so much more than that girl.

Season One follows the journey of finding out who killed Veronica's best friend Lilly Kane (also so much more than just the  dead girl saint). A vivicous girl whose death projects pain not just for Veronica, but basically everyone, in a blackened ripple effect.(the opposite of another great show, Joan of Arcadia) Veronica vows and takes action to do whatever she can to find out the truth, and thus in the same determined fashion the show does so at just the right pace. It's a brillant, fun, and heartbreaking ride that plays out in much the same way as a compelling novel.(creator Rob Thomas does have some experience in that area)I would recommend the show to anyone who enjoys wonderful characterzation, snappy writing, and twisty plots that keep you thinking. Thus if you like great television, give Veronica Mars: Season One a shot!",1141948800,7,3221,4.7051509769094135
2377416,5,B000A59PMO,"What would you get if you crossed the beloved children's book Harriet the Spy with elements from CSI as well as any classic mystery-television program like Matlock, Murder She Wrote, and Magnum P.I. adding just a dash of youthful interjection?  Out of the bubbly cauldron you would discover a flawless television program called Veronica Mars.  Through my small knowledge of I don't think I ever picked up on the enormous originality of this program.  Perhaps I had given up on television at the time, or just didn't think that the station known as UPN could produce anything of value.  I was wrong, dead wrong.  Veronica Mars is one of the most original, creative, suspenseful, and intelligent shows out there.  While I may be basing this solely on the first season, I do not think that with the high energy of the characters, simple yet fun storylines, and edgy undertones that it will ever change.  This first season introduced me to a whole new world surrounding Neptune High and specifically the dramatic past of one Veronica Mars.

Veronica Mars is not your typical murder/mystery television show.  This program combines one part Twin Peaks, one part After-School Special, and one part My So-Called Life with more precision and ease than I have witnessed in most Hollywood films.  We are led, adventure after adventure, by a young, energetic, and intelligent (lethal combination) amateur sleuth named Veronica Mars.  Her best friend, Lilly Kane, was just murdered and her father, the local sheriff of Neptune, blamed the wrong person.  Now, this community of Hollywood superstars, corporate presidents, and the wealthiest individuals, has shunned her family.  The worst part of it all, she has to go to school with all of their children.  We open this season with Veronica friendless, yet determined to pursue her truth and discover the real killer of her best friend.

Coupled with a group of individuals that do not overact, seem grounded in their characters, and feel just like those you would meet in a high school setting, we spend episode after episode getting closer to the truth, while also getting closer to each one of these individuals.  This is what made this show grow on me.  By watching just one or two episodes, you see that this is going to be a decent series, but it isn't until you fully get involved into the second disc that you see the power behind our characters, story, and themes.  This is one of those rare television programs where you feel a connection with all the characters, yet trust none of them.  With Veronica solving ""mini-mysteries"" throughout the series while solely discovering the truth about Lilly, you cannot help but think that everyone is somehow involved.  The truth may be there, but until the final episode, you believe nothing.

Veronica Mars works because of its minor characters and strong central character.  Veronica (played by Kristen Bell) keeps you glued to your television with her strong wit, ironclad charm, and fearless personality.  She wants the truth, and we (the audience members) find ourselves rooting for her the entire time.  This show will take you back to your high school years and make you wish that you had the brains and ability that Veronica had.  I remember watching this show and my wife saying that if it were airing when she was in school, she would see Veronica as an exceptional role model.  She would want to solve crimes/mysteries within her own school.  I am surprised that UPN hasn't publicized this series further.  For me, it was amazing to watch the great Harry Hamlin in action.  I had never seen any of his films or soap opera days, but to see him and his real-life wife in action made a new fan out of me.  With cutting edge Inspector Gadget like objects, Veronica Mars is the hero of a new generation.  Rob Thomas has successfully developed a show that would appeal to both a young and older audience and UPN is just sitting on it.

I suggest everyone should go out and purchase this DVD now.  My wife and I zoomed through the entire first season in the course of about three days.  Even until the final episode we could not figure out the entire mystery, and the ending still left us with puzzles on our minds.  Again, this show is perfect.  Looking back I see no flaws, no errors, nothing short of pure, 100% entertainment that will both make you laugh while play with your mind.  In my eyes, Veronica Mars is flawless.

Grade: ***** out of *****",1141430400,6,4444,4.768324607329843
2377417,5,B000A59PMO,"As great of a show as C.S.I. is, its formulaic method of storytelling makes it, in my opinion, just a MURDER SHE WROTE for the 21st century. Each week there's a murder, each week the murder is solved (WOW, if it were only true in real life), and each week the murders get crazier and more bizarre because after 6 seasons... they have to keep thinking up new ways to kill people. Then there's the well deserved boffo ratings.

Which brings me to VERONICA MARS... would Veronica Mars have those kind of ratings if it were on a more widely viewed and more widely dispersed affiliate network? I'm not sure. You have to be willing to commit. The show is more like real life. The who-dunnits aren't so cut and dry.

The star of the show Kristen Bell, plays VERONICA MARS, a seventeen year-old Nancy Drewish super-sleuth. Using everything in her power to solve small scale crimes, like finding a missing dog, or finding out who stole the money from a friendly poker game, or even going a little larger and finding missing persons or getting to the bottom of sexual harrasment charges. Yet, you care about these things as if they were the most important thing in the WORLD... because they are... to Veronica.

All the while, Veronica, in the back of her mind is treading into areas that may very well be more than she can chew, like why her mother left them and vanished without a trace, and what she may have to do with the murder of her best friend, and the fact that the man sitting in jail for the murder of her best friend is looking more and more innocent and why the parents of her ex-boyfriend are possibly involved in the cover up, and why her ex-boyfriend may be closer to her than she ever imagined, and why she woke up in a strange bed at a party one year ago with her panties off and no recollection of how she got there.

It's all very complex and engaging and wonderfully addicting and creative. Watching the show reminds you of how complex the world is and how murders aren't solved in one episode and that just because the T.V. tells you that a murder is solved, doesn't mean it is. Money is power, power is control and control is usually hiding something.

Which brings me back to my original point. VERONICA MARS is probably the most intriguing, engaging and most well-written show on television, but it is hiding away on the rarely-seen UPN network... We don't have a UPN affiliate where I live... and it's not even available VIA SATELLITE... that is what makes these DVD release so fantastic.

I wanted to watch this show so bad, so I asked for it for Christmas. My fiance watched them in 3 days... cried, laughed, gasped and cooed about how wonderful the show is. A show she had never heard of... is now her favorite show ever.

Now that I've bought these and watched them... I can only eagerly await the season 2 DVD release... because I still can't get UPN where I live.",1141430400,4,2886,4.444234404536862

(""Tru Calling"" was unfocused, usually a downer, and everybody wants to see Eliza Dushku as a real butt kicker who doesn't have to be nice!)

Kirsten Bell is Veronica and she's a 38-year-old Phillip Marlowe trapped in a cheerleader's body, the way her voice-overs sound some times. The rest of the cast is mostly great, and the episodes generally carry 2 plots per show; that week's special, and the on-going ""Who murdered Lily Kane"" season-long arc. The ending is surprising and sets up the next season brilliantly... although I'm waiting for someone to acknowledge that the reason that the universally-beloved Lily was murdered was because she was a slut who'd sleep with several members of the same family!

The series is so good, it truly sucks that there are no ""true"" extras other than deleted scenes. The Series is great, the discs are boring.",1141171200,4,991,4.922155688622754

2377436,5,B000A59PMO,"I was hooked into watching ""Veronica Mars"" on the recommendation of Joss Whedon, creator of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""Angel"", ""Firefly"" and the feature film ""Serenity"". When someone of Whedon's credentials proclaims that watching ""Veronica Mars"" makes him feel like an incompetent hack, it's the sort of thing that makes me sit up and take notice. And while I think Whedon was a bit too hard on himself, he was right about one thing: ""Veronica Mars"" is an amazing show.

For starters, it has a plot that is rooted in an elegant and satisfying mystery -- which is a good thing, given that this is essentially a mystery series blended with a high school drama. The essential premise is simple -- Veronica is the daughter of a private detective who helps her classmates solve their problems while trying to figure out who killed her best friend. From this straightforward beginning, however, ""Veronica"" leads us through a twisting web of secrets and lies in which nothing and no one is ever quite what it seems to be in the beginning.

On the way to the season's shocking finale, Veronica makes both friends and enemies with her brash, hit-me-with-your-best-shot approach to the treacherous world of the modern high school, and the often-complicated relationships between her and the other principal members of the cast are what gives this series its emotional impact and deep, abiding charm. Kristen Bell is adorable, sassy and delightfully snarky as Veronica, taking no guff from her classmates but also capable of heart-breaking vulnerability when she lets her guard down. Her voiceover narration runs as a near-constant companion throughout the series, and for all the world it feels like a teenaged, female Philip Marlowe has opened up her head to us, confessing the things that she can say to no one else. When we see the glittering, beautiful, treacherous and deceitful community of Neptune, it is primarily through her cynical, jaded eyes. The rest of the cast is just as strong; of particular note are Enrico Colantoni (""Just Shoot Me"", ""Galaxy Quest"") as Veronica's tough, witty and charmingly quirky father; Francis Capra (""Pledge of Allegiance"", ""A Simple Wish"") as Eli ""Weevil"" Navarro, the head of a Hispanic motorcycle gang from the poor side of town; and Jason Dohring (""Boston Public"", ""Once and Again"") as Logan Echolls, the sarcastic and troubled son of a multimillion-dollar action movie hero. Characters in this series do not fit in to easy categories of ""hero"" and ""villain"", and these three actors in particular showcase the complex character traits and conflicting motives that are a major highlight of the show.

I recommend ""Veronica Mars"" to fans of good TV, ages 16 and up. The themes it deals with are often serious, involving violence, racism, adultery and other fare typical of the mystery genre. Its deep and interesting characters should draw in fans of everything from ""Buffy"" to ""The Practice"" to ""Everwood"", while its twisty ongoing story and Mysteries of the Week will satisfy the fans of mysteries and crime procedurals. Much more than ""just"" a teen drama, ""Veronica"" will capture your heart and draw you deeply into the lives of a group of complex, wounded, and flawed people -- and before the season is done, you will recognize at least a little of the nobility of the human spirit in each of them.",1140652800,6,3338,4.978494623655914
2377437,5,B000A59PMO,"I knew next to nothing about Veronica Mars when I finally chose to buy it.  I am a fan of the long cancelled Firefly and among the many topics of discussion were great shows that do not get enough attention or have been cancelled.  Wonderfalls is among those cancelled, but Veronica Mars goes on.  That said, I couldn't see a ""teen"" show being of interest to me until I read my hundredth or so promotion raving about the great writing and characters.

I must say that the show surpassed my expectations in all ways.  I am an avid book reader and what I love about this series is how every episode brings about both answers and new questions, which, by the end, make the whole series that much better.

I recommend this very highly and so long as they maintain the respect and faithfullness to the quality being displayed, I hope to see Veronica Mars for many years to come.",1140652800,5,873,4.425
2377438,5,B000A59PMO,"""Veronica Mars"" is not a very well-advertised show.  There's little chance I'd have bothered to investigate it had Joss Whedon not raved about the show on-line.  I decided that I had nothing to lose by giving it a shot, so I went out to Best Buy and picked up the first season.  That was, without a doubt, one of the finest decisions of my young life.

""Veronica Mars"" centers on - surprise! - Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell).  Veronica's a high school junior living in Neptune, California, a town populated almost solely by the rich and famous.  Veronica's family is neither rich nor famous, but they may be a little infamous.  Veronica's father, Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni), runs a detective agency and was, at one time, Neptune's sheriff.  That was before the incident that changed Neptune and its inhabitants forever - the murder of Veronica's best friend, Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried).  When the murder occured, Keith Mars accused Lilly's father, billionaire Jake Kane (Kyle Secor) - a move which resulted in the Mars family being shunned by the rest of Neptune and the departure of Veronica's mom, Lianne Mars (Corinne Bohrer).  Now Veronica has devoted her life to clearing her father's name, while dealing with life's many hardships - as well as the negativity from almost everyone around her.

I was absolutely mesmerized by this series from the moment the pilot began.  The acting is flawless.  Kristen Bell is just wonderful as Veronica, and Enrico Colantoni is terrific as her loving dad.  Jason Dohring is perfect as Logan Echolls, Veronica's friend-turned-tormentor, while Teddy Dunn plays the part of Duncan Kane, Veronica's ex-boyfriend, very well.  The writing is witty and very clever, not to mention unpredictable - this series is just full of plot twists.  When Lilly's killer is at long last revealed, you won't see it coming.  There's also a fantastic soundtrack, including a magnificent score by Josh Kramon.  To top it off, the show's lighting is noticeably unique and really makes the show seem all the more great.

Try as I may to review this season, I really cannot find the words to describe the brilliance of this show.  It's been compared to ""Buffy"", though I think that if anything the show resembles ""Twin Peaks""; truth be told, ""Veronica Mars"" is one of the most unique shows to hit TV in the last decade.  (God bless you, Rob Thomas!) I can rave about this show endlessly, but to know what the show's really like you've gotta buy it.  I can promise you that you will adore this series.

Never has a first season of anything been so wonderful as the first season of ""Veronica Mars"".  This is sweet, sweet television perfection, and I recommend it to anyone and everyone.

I had been tempted to buy this series by all the high reviews it received on Amazon, but what really clinched it for me was Stephen King's nod in  an article he wrote for an entertainment magazine.

While I found the series entertaining, I was not obsessed with watching it as I do when I find a series to be really good.  In fact, I had to push myself to finish it.  Sometimes I would fall asleep while watching it.

All this changed with Veronica and Logan's first kiss.  It's as if this event sparked the series and gave it an interesting edge.  The chemistry between the 2 is great, and Logan is just such an interesting character.  I disliked him tremendously at the beginning, and then found myself rooting for him to the point that I hope he is the one at Veronica's door (cliffhanger at the end of season 1).

However, I was disturbed by the following inconsistencies in the show:

1.  Veronica Mars' metamorphosis from popular, carefree and superficial teenager (before Lilly's murder) to mature, conscientious, justice-seeking, courageous sleuth (after Lilly's murder) is just not believable.  There is nothing in those flashbacks to suggest she had IT in her.  We do not see how someone who was so sweet, innocent and sheltered could become so hard-edged and cynical.

2. At the beginning I found the show to depict a very dark, aggressive high-school environment.  I don't remember high school being like that, but maybe that's they way things are these days.

3.  It is highly unlikely that someone who is so much in love with her ex would destroy DNA test results that could prove he is not her half brother, especially someone who is a ""detective"".

4.  I did not like her disguises on a couple of shows.  It made me think the creators were trying to go for a Sidney Bristow (Alias) in high school.

All this said, Veronica Mars, did manage to hook me, even though it was towards the end, and even though I guessed who Lilly's murderer was 3 shows before the last one.

It is amusing to think that if this murder had not happened, then Veronica's circumstances would not have changed and she would be a clone from all those other shows.

I eventually bought it and I must say that next to Scrubs, this is my new favorite show on TV now. Sure a teen detective sounds a bit corny but when you add that she is simply helping her dad, who is a P.I., it doesn't sound quite so far out. I was extremely happy to see that they casted Enrico Colantoni of Just Shoot Me fame. I always thought he'd be good in a serious part with comedic touches, and he delivers ten fold as Keith Mars, Veronica's dad. I might add that the chemistry between the two of them is as if they're actually related. As for the rest of the cast, aside from rather emotionless Teddy Dunn, the casting was flawless. Percy Daggs III is perfect as the newbie Wallace, Jason Dohring has that smart alleck air to him as Logan, and Francis Capra as the biker gang leader Weevil is pretty funny. The standout in the cast is without a doubt Kristen Bell as Veronica Mars. Her acting is spot on for each and every scene and passes off as a detective very well.

What I really like about this show is that there's two long running mysteries with tons of side projects in each episode. The death of Veronica's friend Lilly being the main focus of the two main mysteries. What's admirable is that they never give up too much information about either case in any episode, it keeps you guessing about what might happen next.

Overall I can't complain a bit about this set or show. The extras are up to par with other TV DVDs but the main focus will always be on the show itself. The acting is a major reason this show is good, but the dialogue is what sets it apart from most other shows. You'll be going along fairly serious and then there'll be a part that just makes you laugh. Take the scene in which Veronica is acting like a girl who just discovered she's pregnant in order to see who charged a room to a credit card all while her dad is throwing some big over the top fit about finding out who got his daughter pregnant, that is gold right there. Basically this show has a bit of everything, romance, mystery, comedy, drama, it's all there. So I'm sure everyone will find one quality to like about it.",1136851200,7,2514,4.235416666666667
2377451,5,B000A59PMO,"**Warning:  Some spoilers follow, but the ""big mystery"" is not spoiled.**

Rob Thomas's ""Veronica Mars"" is, quite simply, the best television show ever. The debut season of ""Mars"" is almost flawless, with superb writing, excellent acting, and intriguing plots (both main plots and subplots).

The show follows its titular character, a junior who was once in the ""in crowd"" at Neptune High, a southern California school so full of the rich and privileged that it might as well be a prestigious private school. A year previous to the pilot episode, Veronica's life was good: she was dating the handsome and popular Duncan Kane and was best friends with Duncan's gorgeous and fun sister Lilly. Duncan and Veronica often hung out with Lilly and her boyfriend, Logan Ecchols, whose father is a famous film star.

Then, Duncan dumps Veronica for no apparent reason, and shortly after, Lilly Kane's bludgeoned body is found. Veronica's father, Keith Mars--the sheriff of Neptune--believes that Lilly was murdered, an opinion agreed upon by the rest of the community. However, when Sheriff Mars targets Lilly's wealthy father, Jake Kane, as his prime suspect, Neptune turns on the Mars family. Keith loses his position as sheriff, Veronica's mother runs away from the family, and Veronica becomes a social pariah. One night, Veronica attends a party to show that she can still hold her head up high--but she winds up drugged and raped while she's unconscious.

All of this is learned through flashbacks, which are interwoven with Veronica's present-day life. Her father has reinvented himself as a private investigator, and Veronica often helps him with his cases--occasionally taking a few on herself. These cases serve as subplots to fill out the episodes and lead Veronica closer to solving the main plot's biggest mystery: who killed Lilly Kane. However, the subplots rarely feel like filler; they are well-rounded and superbly written, and each episode could do well as a ""stand alone.""

Helping and hindering Veronica in her quest for answers is an intriguing cast of characters, portrayed by some of the best actors you've never heard of. (One exception to this is Teddy Dunn, who plays Duncan Kane; while he's not a terrible actor by any means, he falls sadly short when compared to the rest of this stellar cast.) Logan, once Veronica's friend, has now become an enemy of the highest order, who resents Veronica for a myriad of reasons. Weevil, a biker boy, both antagonizes and assists Veronica. Wallace, the new kid at Neptune, quickly befriends Veronica and becomes her closest ally. And through it all, Veronica's father is one of her best friends.

The mystery of who killed Lilly Kane is compelling, especially since the writers are careful, via the flashbacks, to make Lilly an interesting character. But, unlike ""Twin Peaks,"" the mystery isn't the only thing that will keep you glued to the TV watching this show: the writing, the characters, and the actors will, as well.

I would recommend this show to any fan of good television. Do something good for yourself: buy season 1 of ""Veronica Mars"" now.",1136764800,6,3110,5.036964980544747
2377452,5,B000A59PMO,"OK, I have to admit I only asked for the First Season DVD's because I am a huge fan of Joss Whedon. To be quite honest I hadn't heard much about this show, but I figured if Joss liked it, it had to be good. I was mistaken... It was FABULOUS!!!!! I am a huge fan of shows that center around the characters and not the story or action. The characters in this show are very 3 dimensional. Kristen Bell who plays Veronica Mars is one of the best actresses I have seen in a long, long time. The story is extremely well thought out and obviously not made up as they went along (ie: Lost, Alias comes to mind) Also you get the

goods by the end of the season with enough clues along the way to keep you interested. I couldn't recommend this show enough. If you haven't already bought the Season one DVD's I suggest you do. You won't be disappointed! I also want to give a little shout out to Jason Dohring who could have easily just been the token Jerk of the show, but plays his part with such depth as to actually make you both love and hate him at the same time. Keep up the great work guys!",1136764800,5,1087,4.055813953488372
2377453,5,B000A59PMO,"I'm not usually a person who likes to write reviews about anything but this DVD makes me so excited that my fingers seem to be typing on their own accord.

I never watched Veronica Mars during the first season. I'd flip through channels and see five seconds of this show that seemed so convoluted with names and plot-twists that I felt I just couldn't keep up. It seemed too late for me to jump on the Veronica Mars bandwagon.

Then just this year, I started to watch VM's second season. I can't pinpoint when the defining moment was exactly, but I'm guessing after the second or third episode, I was hooked. As someone who unabashedly appreciates television from the outrageously good (BBC's The Office) to the laughably mediocre (Ashton Kutcher's Beauty and the Geek), I can honestly say this is top caliber stuff. The allusions are whip-smart, the dialogue is witty, charming, and believable (unlike, say, Gilmore Girls, which I love but c'mon, no one talks like that) and the show keeps you constantly guessing and almost always delivers (unlike um, Lost).

But the best part, in my humble opinion, is the characters. It's not just about being engrossed with what they are going do or say next. You feel for them. Their developments, their losses, their steps forward and back-all of it honestly affected me. These are truly dynamic characters. . .And they're fun too! Try not to go through an episode without laughing. Or giggling. Or at least breaking into a smile.

I was reluctant to buy the first season because I already knew the answer to the big Lily Kane murder mystery thanks to the second season. Three days ago I caved and I'm so very glad I did. Even if you know who killed the girl, the ending is so scary, so good, so scary good, that it alone merits the purchase of this DVD. The only problem I had with this DVD set was that it was too short. I tried to save the DVDs for a boring evening but like an addict, I kept popping those discs in and frantically pressing play.

So prepare yourself for major VM withdrawal once you're finished. Meanwhile, I'll go back to impatiently waiting for the second season to be on DVD so I can spend another day blissfully not showering, not eating, molding myself to the couch, and not wanting to have it any other way.",1136678400,8,2275,4.5661764705882355
2377454,5,B000A59PMO,"""It's one of the best-written television series I have ever seen, and it has a lot to offer people still mourning the loss of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It's smart, funny, edgy, and rewards patient viewers with one hell of a mystery.

17-year-old Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell, Spartan) has had a rough year. Her best friend was murdered. Her father Keith (Enrico Colantoni, Galaxy Quest), once the sheriff of the small Soouthern California town of Neptune, was fired during the investigation because his search led him to the very wealthy Kane family, including Veronica's ex-boyfriend Duncan (Teddy Dunn, The Manchurian Candidate). After being fired as sheriff, Keith became a private investigator and Veronica's mom disappeared. She lost her considerable popularity at the prestigious Neptune High, and now works for her dad, when she's not carrying on her own investigation of her friend's murder. She will stop at nothing to find the truth, even if it puts her own life at risk.

Much of the credit needs to go to Rob Thomas, who obviously remembers clearly what it feels like to be a teenager. The teen cast is impulsive, uncertain, and frustrated, and watching them interact is almost uncomfortably reminiscent of high school. This could be a drawback for viewers who forget how it feels to be a teen, but it's an impressive feat to those able to remember with immediacy the uncertainty of teenage life. While that alone helps Veronica Mars stand against the competition, the adult characters are also surprisingly well-written. Some of the teachers come across as parodies, but the relationship between Veronica and her father is well developed, and avoids the usual TV parent stereotypes. The series also does a fine job of juggling references to pop culture and high culture. It's quite savvy, making references to things that are still fresh a year after the episodes were broadcast, but it also has a deep well of high culture references. Holders of useless English Literature degrees are going to eat this series up. Culturally adept viewers will also enjoy the celebrity cameos and inside jokes, none of which I will spoil here. Needless to say, it's a very cool show.

Equal credit needs to go to the cast. Kristen Bell is truly fantastic as Veronica Mars, with enough charisma to easily carry the show on her own. Veronica is funny, smart, and fiery, but also wins our sympathy through her sincerity and vulnerability. She's good at what she does, even though she often makes very stupid choices. At first glance, the remainder of the characters are stereotypes. There's Weevil (Francis Capra), for instance, the tough local gang leader. A major antagonist early in the season comes is Logan (Jason Dohring), the spoiled son of a rich and famous actor. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) is one of Veronica's only friends at the start, a new guy to the school. As the episodes unfold, we gradually see beneath the generic surface of the characters. None of the characters are who they seem at first, and their web of relationships becomes ever more complicated as they interact through the season.

After the first two episodes, I was a bit worried that Veronica Mars would settle into a bland TV series groove. It also looked like it may have had too many balls in the air, much like Joan of Arcadia. I didn't need to worry. As the show progresses, a dark edge starts to creep in. There are still a number of funny incidents, but they begin to be overwhelmed by the grim investigation of the main murder. The suspense surrounding the case builds throughout the season, leading to a final few episodes that are nail-bitingly suspenseful and even a bit creepy. Every detail in the series winds up being important, even the details of the cases that aren't part of the main plot. By the end of the season, whole sections of the jigsaw puzzle start to fall into place, until the truth is finally revealed at the very end. I'm looking forward to a second viewing of the season, if only to watch once again how all these details come together.

Which brings me to another high point regarding Veronica Mars. Although some threads are left slightly open at the end of the first season, the show has the decency to close off the main plot thread in a satisfying way. If the series had been canceled after the first season (which it thankfully wasn't), it would still be a great story. So many series now seem to be constantly pushing towards the next big twist. Networks are so afraid of failure that they try to string viewers along viewers with the proverbial carrot-always held in front of us, but never within reach. I want to see the second season of Veronica Mars, not because I just have to find out what will happen next, but because the journey of this first season was such an enjoyable one. Whatever Veronica's next big case is, I don't want to miss it. And should the show jump the shark in the future, this season will still stand on its own as a monumental success.

You have great scripts with witty dialogue, a central mystery(that isn't drawn out like Lost), great looking people to look at every week and most of of Kristen Bell who is wonderful in this.

Like Lost, there's a continuing mystery interspersed with the subplots of each episode.  And like Lost, flashbacks are used to brilliant effect to give us information on a need-to-know basis.  And, like Lost, the twists and surprises are plentiful!

2377460,5,B000A59PMO,"Rob Thomas envisioned a detective story with a dark, noir feel, while the studio mainly wanted to have a high school drama. What we ended up with is Veronica Mars, often said to be targeted at the young female demographic. Another common comparison says it's the ""new Buffy.""
So what's a guy like myself, well past his teens and who never saw a single episode of Buffy, doing here? Frankly, all the narrow statements on who the target demographic and intended audience are supposed to be are only doing a great disservice to the show.

It's got a far more general appeal: if you simply like quality shows, witty dialog, fun and mystery, or a good cast, you're bound to like it. It took a lot of glowing recommendations from TV critics and the likes of Joss Whedon to finally convince me to give it a chance, and I'm glad I did.

The show's strongest point is probably the acting. Kristen Bell as the titular character does some phenomenal work, and Enrico Colantoni in the role of her father is also a delight to watch. Unbelievable how both of them got overlooked by the Emmys, not even getting a nomination. On the other hand, the show's weakness lies in it being ambitiously grounded in reality. Other than it taking place in the fictional small town of Neptune, it's all meant to be present-day real world stuff. This makes it harder to suspend disbelief if you spot things which are technologically impossible or silly, or violate standard court and police procedures. My recommendation is to avoid most of the extremely nit-picky recaps and forum discussions all around the 'net, lest they unnecessarily point out things you would've never noticed anyway, and lessen your enjoyment.

This DVD set release is a mixed bag. It's got some slick design and packaging, all the basic necessities. What it doesn't really have are extras and bonus features. You get 22 minutes of deleted scenes, all jumbled together in one continuous clip, plus one and a half minutes more at the start of the Pilot episode. And that is all. The dearth of extras was explained to be a conscious decision of trying to get the DVD out as early as possible, in order to let new viewers - such as myself - catch up with the story thus far. This, I can support and understand, yet can't help but feel disappointed that it isn't reflected in the selling price at all. In fact, this was easily the most expensive ""TV on DVD"" that I've bought in the past several months. Was it worth it? I'd say yes, and the purchase hopefully also serves as a vote for the network to pick Veronica Mars up for a third season.

One final note. While all packaging and information claims this as limited to Region 1 only, all six discs were actually formatted as playable in Regions 1, 2, 3 and 4 as well, which should make it playable almost anywhere in the world (5 and 6 excluded) without any hassle.

In the first episode Veronica's world has been turned upside down by the death of her best friend Lilly Kane, daughter to multi millionaire Jake Kane. It is Jake who Veronica's dad pursues as the killer of Lilly. He's the local sheriff, but it's a position he doesn't hold much longer when the Kane's fortune and influence force him from his job. The ensuing scandal  breaks up the Mars family. Ultimately Veronica and her dad are forced to go it alone. They stay afloat by manning a small detective agency in town. Veronica goes from popular to outcast as her life and status falls apart. A late night party seals her reputation as the high school tramp, a party that Veronica has very little memory of.

Through out the season Veronica redefines herself as she moves from case to case, often working for the very students who shun her. Her office is the high school girls bathroom and her best friend is her smarts, an ability that keeps her one step ahead of  her rivals.

Who killed Lilly Kane? Where's Veronica's mom? What really happened at that party? These are just a few of the mysteries Veronica confronts through the first season of this wonderfully crafted show.

The acting is far above average from what one might expect in a weekly TV show. Enrico Colantoni , Veronica's dad, is barely recognizable from his days on ""Just Shoot Me"". Kristen Bell, Jason Dohring, and Harry Hamlin also shine in their well defined roles. The writing too is more than we deserve. It is clever and full of wit.  Only twice was I able to solve the mysteries presented by the show before Veronica, and then only by a few seconds. The themes that the show explores, class structure and teen angst being the most predominate, are familiar but fresh. This is more that just ""90210"" meets ""Columbo"".

And Bell appears to be able to do anything.  She's great at comedy, tears your heart out at the tragic moments, all while nicely underplaying in the best noir tradition.  She's even able to subtly suggest that Veronica is a flawed, even damaged character because of her ordeals, and is groping towards some normality and redemption.

Some of the stand alone episodes could have been stronger, but Veronica's determination to find Lily's murderer keeps the series going. As one reviewer said, the last four to five episodes are really good. Joss Whedon, the creator of Buffy, has lavished quite a lot of praise on the show. The first season was a great start. Coincidentally, Alyson Hannigan guest starred on the show in the first season, and Charisma Carpenter has become a series regular in the second.",1132012800,9,869,4.8

I bought the first season of Veronica Mars on impulse while browsing at my local DVD store. What a lucky decision! I devoured all 22 episodes in less than two weeks for the simple reason that this highly addictive series is absolutely one of the best shows I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot, for I'm 57 years old). Apparently other viewers agree because, as this is being written, 93 of 99 Amazon reviewers have given it 5 stars.

Kirsten Bell stars as Veronica, a brilliant, entertaining, attractive, witty, personable, tough, charming and eminently lovable 17-year-old high school student. Veronica attends Neptune High, a school with snobbish and troubled rich kids (referred to as 09ers for their zip code) and a bevy of offbeat middle class kids.  Veronica, who once upon a time was your typical teenager, is now anything but as she works after school for her dad as a private eye. Veronica is completely focused on solving a murder case that her dad, the cops, and everyone else has given up on, a murder that had a huge impact on her family. Her sleuthing will keep you hooked on the series as there are countless twists and turns in this season long who-dun-it. Several clips of previous shows are run at the beginning of each episode to refresh your memory for the ongoing story. The narration is done by Veronica, who also talks to you throughout the story as she feeds you juicy insights, all the while strengthening your bond with this engaging young heroine.

Each episode is also a self-contained unit as Veronica does her Sherlock Holmes routine circa 2004 while adroitly solving cases brought to her by fellow classmates. She works her cell phone, is a master at looking up the dirt on her laptop, impersonates people on the phone and in person, enlists the aid of fellow students and even policemen for off-limits records, cons people for information with consummate charm (or threats when necessary), works her digital camera like a paparazzi, and employs 1001 other tricks of the detecting trade in righting wrongs and solving her always busy load of cases. In the process, Veronica becomes a hero and friend to an ever-growing legion of students and admirers and to you, the viewer.

What is so refreshing about her new cases each episode is that they are not murder mysteries, unlike pretty much every other detective show. On the contrary, Veronica turns things like discovering who stole the school mascot or stopping a jealous ex-boyfriend from showing a sexy video clip into a roller coaster ride of thrills and surprises. In short, the writing is great, the episodes are anything but cookie cutter, and Bell is mesmerizing as she manipulates her adorable face into any of a 100 different expressions that are right on target with the moment.

Keith Mars (played by Enrico Colantoni) is a dad any kid would be glad to have as a father. He totally supports Veronica when he doesn't have hands full trying to keep her in check while she works all the angles as she attempts to solve the murder mystery. Her best friend and constant companion and partner in crime Wallace is superbly played by Percy Daggs III. The supporting cast of friends, archrivals, rich kids, and their neurotic parents is also perfectly suited to their roles

I simply can't recommend a show any higher than Veronica Mars. Because I want you to enjoy the series as much as possible, I am passing along the following tips: 1) Buy the first season and savor each episode. 2) Do not watch the second season (currently into its 7th episode as this is written) because you will destroy the continuity of several story lines (yes, the first season ended with many unanswered questions). 3) Buy the second season DVD when it comes out. 4) Plead with UPN to renew the show for a third season, and to put the second season DVD out at least a month before the third season begins. 5) Record the third season and watch it after you've caught up with the second season providing, a) there is a third season and, b) the second season DVD comes out after the third season has begun.

Enjoy!

2377475,5,B000A59PMO,"I think this series is one of the best series out there right now.  I think both adults and young adults could enjoy this show.  I did not know about this show because it is not on one of the major networks, but I do not like to miss an episode.

I feel like this show does not depict Veronica as a perfect teenager.  It shows her engaging in parties, kissing boys, etc, which is normal for a high school student.  Also, her means of figuring out things are not urealistic.  Her dad and her have a ""normal"" relationship.  They disagree every once in awhile, she gets jealous of him dating other women, and she always wants her mom to come back.  I think everyone does a great job acting, espically Kristen.  She is very witty, but when it comes to serious scenes, I feel that she does an exceptional job!  Lastly, I love all the little investigations she works on while finding out little information about her friend, Lilly Kane's, murder.  I bought this series and finished it within a few days because I was so excited to see the next episode.  I am very excited about this new season.  I hope a lot of people watch this so that this series can continue!  I would recommend this to anyone, I have a lot of people hooked on this show already!",1131580800,5,1244,4.306034482758621
2377476,4,B000A59PMO,"I am the type of person who absolutely abhors most of the garbage that TV producers put out these days, and have been for a long time now.  I think and believe that 99% of what you see on TV is throwaway, nonsensical, BS, that has no place in your head.

This show is actually very interesting and not just for teens.  I am not a teen, being 30 I actually think its enjoyable, without insulting my intelligence all that much.  I guess what I am saying is that IMHO, this is the most interesting thing I have seen on TV since ""Twin Peaks"", back in 89-91.  The characters are well thought out and seem to be really immersed in their parts, not just half-wit acting.  Also, the show has a lot of twists and turns that will keep you pleasently engaged until the final episode is over.

You might be asking yourself, why if I enjoy this so much am I giving it only 4 stars?  The DVD special features are non-existent, except for a few, mostly unimportant deleted scenes.  No interviews with the cast and story writter, no making of, just the deleted scenes.  I would actually suggest that you rent this through Netflix, or any other online rental place, which is what I did, unless of course you feel you must own it.",1131494400,7,1212,4.323008849557522
2377477,5,B000A59PMO,"Forget the high school set up, this is the smartest, most mature and complex show to come out of network TV since the glory days of ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"", the early seasons of the ""X-Files"", ""My So-Called Life"" and the first season of ""Twin Peaks"". And sorry ""Lost"", you know I love you, but the Most Compelling Mystery On TV award goes to the cute-as-a-button petite blond with the smart mouth and the attitude. This is one of the few shows that are able to combine style and substance, drama and comedy and thrills, chills and character-driven stories successfully and intelligently.

Most every single episode is tightly packed with engaging storylines, crisp dialogue, fun mini-mysteries with outcomes that are hard to guess and tantalizing little clues that keep the viewer on the edge of their seat and intrigued by the season-long whodunit.  There is no fat, there are no fillers and there so much going on that even the awesome songs carefully selected for each scene serve a clear purpose.

And every single episode reveals so much about the characters that you can't help but become emotionally attached. The writers and actors take great pains to make you care about all of the main people involved in Lilly's death and, in what may be one of the most brilliant moments in TV ever, in Lilly herself. Not one of them is your average, clichd teen show character and you may even find yourself loving AND hating some of these folks.  This is, after all, a gritty show that pushes the limit and never sugarcoats growing up, talks down to its viewers or romanticizes high school. The characters are real and flawed and their actions and motivations are not always noble or righteous. There's plenty of moral ambiguity, tough lessons and realism to go around.

Likewise, the main character isn't some unrealistic, unattainable fembot or a flawless, impervious superhero. She is, we are often reminded, a hurt, lonely, vulnerable, scrawny 17-year-old who's only strengths are her unflinching determination, resilience and smarts. Bell is outstanding and subtly yet effectively conveys all the conflicting emotions with an endearing mixture of vulnerability, panache, wit and bravado that are all of her own. She is never a victim and she never screams for attention, yet she can always command it. By the third episode, you don't just like Veronica, you love and understand her.

The relationship between Veronica and her dad is just beautiful and the chemistry between both actors undeniable. Jason Dohring is explosive as Logan Echolls and is another actor with great chemistry with Bell. Kudos are also in order to Francis Capra and the actress playing Lilly, who manages to steal every one of the few scenes she is in.

Veronica Mars isn't your average TV mystery. There's so much more there than meets the eye. You can watch and re-watch the first season and always enjoy it and discover something new. Further more, it is fun and exciting TV, the kind we hardly ever get anymore outside of Cable. I'll take this over moguls looking for apprentices and desperate 40-year-olds acting like crazed teenagers any day of the week.",1129680000,78,3139,4.922495274102079

2377481,5,B000A59PMO,"Here's a chance to catch the best new show of the 2004-2005 TV season - ratings challenged Veronica Mars.  While the ratings are low, it has a loyal following for a very good reason.

In the seaside town of Neptune, California, there are the haves and the have-nots.  You're either one or the other with no middle ground.  Veronica used to be part of the popular click.  But that was before her best friend Lily was murdered, her rich boyfriend Duncan dumped her, and her father lost his job as the town Sheriff because of his handling of Lily's murder investigation.  While her dad opened a PI office, her mom split for parts unknown, leaving the two to cope with the changes in town.

Because of her station as a former popular girl, Veronica doesn't fit into either crowd.  Fortunately, the detective skills she's learned from her dad help her make friends.  Seems like classmates are constantly coming to her to help with little things like bomb scares or missing pets.  Even teachers turn to her in times of crisis, like false accusations of statutory rape.  Along the way, Veronica begins to pick up pieces of the puzzle of Lily's murder.  Will she piece them all together and figure out who really done it?

I tuned into the premier because several friends were planning to watch as well.  I was hooked from the start.  The show is smart with decent mysteries each week.  The clues to the season long mystery of Lily's death were tantalizing as well.  The show is definitely shown through Veronica's eyes, with her voiceover narrating events as well.  Veronica has a sarcastic sense of humor that livens things up and keeps the often-serious storyline from becoming too depressing.  Newcomer Kristen Bell does an outstanding job in the roll, believably hitting all the peaks and valleys each week.  It is rather funny to see Zachery Ty Bryant and Jonathan Taylor Thomas show up in guest rolls as high schoolers.

The DVD was rushed out to help build interest in the currently playing season two.  As such, the list of extras is small, limited to some deleted scenes and a season long gag reel.

Some of the plot lines are for the more mature, but teens and adults will love this smart, noir drama series.  If you haven't watched yet, this is the perfect chance to find out what you've been missing.",1128988800,29,2305,4.648514851485149

I was able to catch the last 6 episodes of the season on original airing and caught up over the summer with reruns. I'm looking forward to the DVD because unlike other shows, I can watch almost any season 1 episode over and over again and not get bored. The one liners are GREAT. The emotions are BIG.

2377484,5,B000A59PMO,"This review may sound a bit harsh on another teen drama, however I'm a huge fan of both shows.

The first season of Veronica Mars is what the second season of the OC wanted to be.  There is drama, romance, suspense, intrigue, and plot twists - the final episode caught me off guard, and I am never surprised at TV endings being a trained screenwriter myself.  If you're looking for a new guilty pleasure, or a show that parents and teens (no younger children, but teens should be OK) can watch together and understand at their respective levels, this one is it.

I won't go into the plot as that as been covered extensively, however I will go into the use of foreshadowing.  The writers of Veronica Mars, who all deserve emmys for this, have used the art of foreshadowing in a completely new way for teen drama.  They have used subtle and dramatic foreshadowing to lead the viewer in several different directions with regard to the lily kane murder, allowing each viewer to feel they know exactly what happened before Veronica figures it out.  Of course, the viewer is wrong and could never figure out a mystery before Veronica does, but it really adds to the experience of the show.  You, like the students of Neptune High, get to experience the ""zig when you should zag"" feeling of not getting to the punch before the great Veronica Mars.

The Lily Kane murder mystery ending is something that I hope no one has given away in reviews yet, as it's best experienced by watching the entire season to lead up to the ending.  If you do this, you'll never know what hit you.

I would rate this a 10 if I could, and all other OC fans who think the OC is the best show on television - take a look at the OTHER rich kid high school drama out there.  ;)",1128643200,11,1745,4.385093167701863

The first episode makes you get to know the characters very quickly and dramatically making you want to want to know more about them. The plots of the show are also fun and interesting to watch.

2377489,5,B000A59PMO,"After I stumbled upon Veronica Mars and discovered that it was actually amazingly good, my big challenge was to try to get my friends to watch it.  For some reason everyone who had heard of it at all thought that it was a 'Nancy Drew type show'.  No critcism of Nancy implied, but Veronica Mars (both the character and the series) has a very mature, dark and cynical outlook that defies most simplistic expectations.  Veronica isn't always the nicest person; she is cynical, bitter and (highly) vengeful.  She enjoys manipulating people, she can be frighteningly cavalier with the truth (and law... and basic human rights), and she wants to be feared by people that she doesn't like.  But ultimately she is a champion for those who don't have other options. The greatest evil in Veronica's home town of Neptune, is not a serial killer or even the murderer of Veronica's best friend; it is the caste driven system which disenfranchizes many of Veronica's peers, while elevating others.  Veronica Mars is not all social message or politically posturing though, and it brings to the table a number of strengths that make it standout (head and shoulders) among the current crop of teen dramas (the best since Buffy).

-Great writing; particularly in the witty repartee and in Veronica's often wickedly cynical expository voice over.
-Kristen Bell's extraordinary range and dead on delievery.  Unlike many actor's trying to play smart, she actually seems very smart, and very competent.
-A strong story arc that threads through each episode, driving Veronica's actions.
-A great supporting cast (both regular and recurring) playing complex characters that have their own agendas and who grow and change throughout the season.

There are many dynamics that go on in a show this complex, some of which work better than others.  From the central murder mystery of Lily Kane, to Veronica's search forher mother, and her complex relationships with her father, Kieth Mars; Logan Echolls; and Duncan Kane; we are given both great drama and a real mystery.  Saying more runs the risk of giving away too much for those who haven't seen it.  Let it suffice to say I rank Veronica Mars with Lost, as one of the two best, new dramas from last season... And I for one cannot wait for the next mystery to unfold.",1127088000,80,2293,4.896640826873385
2377490,5,B000A59PMO,"For those looking for the true heir to Buffy the Vampire Slayer in terms of a sharp script and snappy dialogue look no further than the UPN show Veronica Mars. Not since Sunnydale dropped into a deep chasm has television seen such a fabulous ensemble of talented young actors deliver such inventive dialogue in intelligent, darkly humorously directed fare.

In what is possibly one of the best shows on television today Veronica Mars first season aired in fall 2004 and fast developed a devoted fan following.

For me Tuesday nights became the most anticipated TV night of the week and I could not get enough of the show or its hot star Kristen Bell. It quickly shot up the rankings on my TiVo season pass where it now sits at number one and my Kristen Bell TiVo wish-list was set to auto-record so I would not miss any program in which she was featured. I remember the anger when my local UPN station decided to air a baseball game instead of one episode - never have I felt more like putting pen to paper to express my displeasure with a programming decision.

So what is this show that induces such passion? It's a detective show, no it's a romantic drama, or is it a dark comedy? Well, in reality it is all of this and more. Set in the California city of Neptune, it paints the picture of a society split between the have's such as the rich Kane family or movie star Aaron Echoll's wife and children and the have-nots (notably title character Veronica Mars and her friends Wallace and Weevil).

Veronica is the daughter of Keith Mars, the former Sheriff, who was ousted after accusing millionaire software businessman Jake Kane of murdering his daughter (and Veronica's best friend) Lilly.

Now a private detective Keith is still investigating the murder and determined in his conviction that the man in jail for the murder is innocent. He is supported in this belief by his daughter a fact which has made her a social outcast from the popular clique to which she once belonged.

The murder-mystery and the mystery to a rape that occurred before the show opens both serve as the season-long story arc. But, as Veronica continues her investigation each episode involves the investigation into a lesser mystery. From stolen poker winnings to missing school mascots to  missing dogs and busting a fake ID card ring, Veronica (with the help of Wallace, Mac and assorted other misfits) must navigate a world of secret societies, shady Kane security personnel and a largely hostile school environment.

In addition to the great script the other strength of the show is in assembling a wonderful ensemble of young actors. Led by Kristen Bell who as Veronica outdo's Buffy in the dry humor department, and ably supported by Canadian actor Enrico Colantoni as Keith Mars, the two really display a true father-daughter affection for each other which apparently was true off-screen as well. In addition to this dynamic there is also Percy Daggs III as Veronica's best friend (and cohort in her investigations) Wallace. Teddy Dunn plays tortured with some secret that he struggles to keep hidden as Veronica's ex-boyfriend Duncan Kane and Jason Dohring appears as Logan, the bad-boy rich kid son of actor Aaron (who is played by Harry Hamlin of LA Law and Clash of the Titans fame). Completing the talented young cast is Francis Capra as biker bad-boy Weevil.

Not to spoil the ending of the show for anyone who missed it on its initial run over fall 2004 to spring 2005 or the reruns of select episodes over the summer of 2005, this show needs to be seen to be believed. Sure I am a diehard fan of the show, but I defy any viewer not to became charmed by the drama, romance, humor and well drawn characters. Yes, the mysteries are solved but a lot of the fun comes in the journey towards those last two episodes of the season.

On this DVD set of six discs we are promised deleted scenes, a gag reel and extended takes. The release was supposed to have already happened, but was pushed back when fans complained that they didn't want a bare-bones release. I'm happy though because now it is scheduled to arrive on my birthday - Oct. 11. What a fantastic birthday present!

Personally I cannot wait for Season 2 that starts Sept. 28, 2005. Creator Rob Thomas has promised us a great new mystery and besides that question that burns the most is the one that Thomas left us with at the end of season one - just who was it at the door?",1126742400,13,4424,4.622929936305733
2377491,5,B000A59PMO,"this coming from a self-professed snob. i was a bit hesitant after a good friend practically demanded i watch the show. finally i gave in and she let me borrow her--ahem--bootleg copies.  three or four episodes in, i was a VM addict.

the season long plot may sound a bit pedestrian: veronica mar's best friend, lily kane, is murdered. scandal, intrigue, whodunnit? etc. however, anyone wanting to pass this off as another nancy drew-ish teenage sleuther show is missing out on some of the best writing and acting on television today.

kristen bell as veronica mars is absolutely perfect. she's the perfect blend of spunk and vulnerability--a very smart move on the writer's part.  for all her brains and cleverness, underneath it all veronica is mush (just as a 17 year old would be), and bell pulls it off gloriously. it's joy to watch. and yeah, she's Extraordinarily attractive.

all around the acting is so solid--particularly jason dohring as logan ecchols. he comes off as a pompous a** in the beginning of the show, yet as we see him progress (or digress) it's hard to fall in love with the kid. there's really not a wink link in the bunch. everyone nails their roles with the just the right mix of levity and gravitas. each is deeply wounded in some way or other, and it's neat to watch each character's particular arc as they come to terms with own demons (and they all have them).

and try not to love deputy leo. i dare you. hilarious.

the writing is also superb. you almost need the 'annotated veronica mars' just keep up with the writer's jokes and references (it was particularly hilarious to see 'clash of the titans' on the hotel room tv considering harry hamlin, star of said movie, stars at logan ecchols father). i've laughed out loud several times while watching the show in my room alone. i hope the second season builds on the first's...

in short, veronica mars is everything you want your TV show to be: funny, moving, well-written, superbly acted, full of mystery and intrigue, likeable characters, evil villians, and great background music to boot (rob thomas: email me. we need to talk. you need me as your soundtrack coordinator). sure, you'll have to suspend disbelief at times, but a trip to neptune, california is well worth the price of admission.

the big boys (abc, cbs, nbc, fox) need to stand up and notice what's going on the down the street.  shows like everwood, gilmore girls and now veronica mars are leaving you in the dust. and good for them.",1126224000,12,2487,4.696551724137931
2377492,5,B000A59PMO,"I am very happy that there is going to be a second season for the show in spite of the show's non stellar ratings. Thankfully it will not join the Freaks and Geeks, My So Called Life, Undeclared, and Popular club which all were killed off the air too early. Hopefully the second season will get an increased number of viewers that the show really deserves.

One of the things I like about the show is that even though each episode has different episode long plots, there are season long plots (Lilly's murder, Veronica's mother) to move the series along. It is serialized in the sense that as the season progresses, we get little clues regarding the major plots. Even though each episode can be regarded as ""stand alone"" episodes, collectively it is a coherent entire season

Kristin Bell carried the show with spunk and charm. Enrico Colantoni was also good. The relationship of Veronica and Keith was the heart and soul of the series. The chemistry between the two was very effective.

It's hard to narrow down my 5 favorite episodes of the season since almost all of them were really great. But here are my top 5 episodes of the first season:

  **************Possible Spoiler*****************

1. Leave it to Beaver - I have seen lots of season finales last season, and this VM finale was the most satisfying. It's a perfect culmination as the murderer of Lilly Kane was finally revealed. I was on the edge of the seat the entire episode. And the scene with the paternity results with Keith and Veronica was really moving. And the penultimate scene with Veronica and Lily in the pool with the song ""Lily Dreams On"" in the background was appropriately poignant. This was just a perfect episode.

2. A Trip to the Dentist - A stylish episode as Veronica investigates the person who raped her. The flashbacks were nicely done as they were shown the way the witnesses saw them. They were all basically the same but very different in implication because of the minor details that either they failed to mention or choose not to mention or sometimes the way they interpret the situation.

3. The Wrath of Con - I love seeing Veronica and the gang pre murder of Lily. We got insights to the major characters especially the relationship of Duncan and Veronica. The Lily montage in the end of the episode was poignant even though we've only known the character for like 4 or 5 episodes.

4. Like a Virgin - Abel Koontz and Veronica Mars in the prison was somewhat reminiscent of Clarice and Hannibal Lecter's face off in Silence of the Lambs. There's a big revelation in the end that made you look at prior episodes in different perspective. Plus Veronica's got a great case with the ""purity test"".

5. Ruskie Business - this episode was packed the way pickles are packed. Veronica was working on 3 different cases (Logan's mother, Meg's secret admirer, finding Tom Cruz the actor) and none of them were fillers. All had satisfying conclusions. And just when you thought it's over, the episode actually ended on a cliffhanger of a totally different plot which I won't tell you.

Right from the get go this show had me hooked.  I love season long story arcs, and the way they kept the Lilly Kane murder story alive was brilliant.

2377496,4,B000A59PMO,"I didn't watch the show when it was originally aired.  I started wathcing re-runs on TV and then I downloaded the eps.  Overall it is a very good show.  Kristin Bell is amazing as Veronica Mars - teen detective.  She has the perfect ammount of sarcasm that she is funny, not annoying.  She is a great character because she is easy to relate to and fun to watch. Some of the other characters are boring and weak to watch.

  My only complaint about this show is that it is inconsistant.  If an episode is good, then it is phenominal.  But inbetween the great episodes there are quite a few that aren't even worth watching.

  The story starts by introducing Veronica.  She talks about how she was raped the previous year and how her best friend was murdered.  Also, her mother ran out on her.  The season goes on to solve these mysteries along with other mini-mysteries.

  The best part of this show is the flashbacks.  They go back to show Lily (the friend) and many other things.  It is a great and original way to show how everything happened.

  Overall, it is an awesome show, but it does have many weak points.  If you like the mystery shows like CSI or MONK you should give it a try.  I won't buy it, just because I don't see myself watching it over and over again.  But I did enjoy watching it the first time.

This is a fantastic new show that (unlike a lot of the current American tv), assumes it's viewers are intelligent people. It doesn't hold your hand, explain every detail, or dumb down the dialogue. The charactors are layered - flawed and human, but immensly likeable. While the script is superb, with a lot of emotional truth and biting wit, show creator Rob Thomas expects his actors to convey a lot with their acting, facial expressions and body movement.
Luckily they are up for the job. The whole cast, even the bit players, is great. Of particular note, star Kristen Bell (Veronica Mars) is excellent in her role, portraying the strenth and vulnerability that embody her charactor with ease. Jason Dohring (Logan Echolls), one of the best new actors on tv, is outstanding as a bitter young man lashing out (in a terrifically funny and snarky way) at the world around him. He and Francis Capra (Weevil) both overflow with charisma.

2377505,2,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars, a teenager at a high school where the wealthy send their teens, is helping solve private investigations through her father's PI business (he's also the former Sheriff of the area.) They live in a fictitious town known as Neptune, California.

On top of this, Veronica has to deal with the strife of her classmates (who are much better off than herself), the fact that she comes from a broken home (her mother left her father and her), and try to avoid the local turf wars in her corner of the world.

Sounds like a winner, doesn't it?

But there are several problems with the basic premise of this series that I just couldn't get my mind around.

First (and DEFINITELY foremost) is that the children of millionaires DO NOT go to public schools. They go to private schools. Why would they mingle with the lower classes when they don't have to? The simple answer is that they never would.

Secondly, there were a bunch of little things that could've been fixed but weren't. For instance, Veronica gets the headlights of her car bashed in by a rich punk. Then the next scene shows her driving down the street at night ...WITH THE HEADLIGHTS ON! Some might argue that she got them fixed, but let's remember that she and her father are not that well off.

Thirdly, Sheriffs are not assigned to ""towns""; they patrol and enforce the law in counties. And Neptune is a city/town. Little things like this shows me how poorly the script writers researched various aspects for the show. And these oversights easily seeped into almost all aspects of the series.

And the one aspect of the show that I felt most curious and drawn to -- that being the father/daughter/mother relationship -- was never fully explored. Now I know that this will be a culminating factor in the series, but I felt that too much time was spent on Veronica's high school life and not enough on her home life. A better balance was definitely needed.

For better series' look toward Wonderfalls or Dead Like Me.",1122768000,21,1986,4.622159090909091
2377506,5,B000A59PMO,"Most television shows (and movies for that matter) are so predictable. It is frustrating that writers seem completely unable to come up with original ideas.

Never in my life has a show left me gasping with surprise over the way events unfold, as this show has. If you're looking for a well written, surprising and interesting show, check out Veronica Mars. You won't be disappointed.",1122595200,20,523,4.822222222222222
2377507,5,B000A59PMO,"I am not exaggerating when I say that Veronica Mars is UPN's best show in... well ever I guess (I'm not counting Buffy the Vampire Slayer because it originated and had the majority of its run on the WB).  Veronica Mars is well-written, intelligent, well-acted, fun, dramatic, witty, and all that other good stuff that makes people want to watch each week.  While powerhouse shows like Lost (which deserves the hype it is getting) and Desperate Housewives (which I doubt deserves the hype it's getting) may get all the credit for making the 2004-2005 television season responsible for the return of the scripted show, critics (as well as a handful of loyal fans) never forget to mention Veronica Mars when discussing that topic.
Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) used to be a member of the ""in"" crowd at her affluent high school, Neptune High.  Neptune California is one of the richest areas in America (probably something like Orange County, but that area is reserved for The OC), and as Veronica states in the pilot episode, kids who go to Neptune High have parents who are either millionaires or parents that work for millionaires.  Veronica's dad doesn't exactly fit that profile, but he used to be the town sheriff.  That was enough to get her enough status to date Duncan Kane (Teddy Dunn) and be best friends with Lily Kane (Amanda Seyfried), the children of the richest man in town, software designer Jake Kane (Kyle Secor).  She also got to hang around with Lily's boyfriend, Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring), the son of A-list stars Aaron (Harry Hamlin) and Lynn Echolls (Lisa Rinna, who is actually married to Hamlin in real life).  However, all that changed about a year prior to the beginning of the series, and the people that used to be Veronica's friends now try to have nothing to do with her.  Lily was killed, and Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni), who was still the sheriff at the time, concluded that Lily's father Jake was the culprit.  But when a man named Abel Koontz (Christian Clemenson) confessed to the killing, the citizens of Neptune were outraged and had Keith replaced by the incompetant Don Lamb (Michael Muhney).  Soon after, Veronica, in an attempt to prove that she was still cool, went to a girl's party.  At some point, someone slipped her a date rape drug, and she woke up the next day without her underwear on.
As the series begins, Keith is now a private investigator, and Veronica is in his tutelage.  She helps him with his cases, while taking on a few herself.  She has become cynical towards her classmates and the law system, and she begins to see her old friends for who they really are, especially Logan.  While he was (usually) nice to the people he liked, he was a total jerk to those he didn't like, and he has a special kind of wrath towards Veronica.  Fortunately for Veronica, she has her keen intellect on her side as well as a few new friends who are fellow outcasts.  Wallace Fennel (Percy Dags III) is a new kid whom Veronica helps on his first day at Neptune High.  After that, they become friends and she often has him do case-related work with her.  Eli ""Weevil"" Navarro (Francis Capra) is a biker gang member who learns to respect Veronica, and does some of her dirty work for her.  Finally there is Mac (Tina Majorino, famous for her role in Napoleon Dynamite), who does computer work for Veronica (sadly, she's only in a few episodes, but I hope that they use her more in Season 2).
Early on in the season, Veronica discovers evidence that proves the innocence of Abel Koontz, and the driving story arc of the season is her search for Lily's true killer.  However, there are many great and interesting sub-plots throughout the year, as well as stand-alone stories.  The character development is amazing on this show.  As I stated earlier, Logan is a bit of a psychopath, but as the episodes unfold, we learn that there may be a reason for his behavior.  Many times, we think we have a character figured out, only to learn something new and unexpected about them in a few weeks, such as a supposed affair between Jake Kane and Veronica's mom Lianne (Corinne Bohrer), or an explanation to Duncan's erratic behavior.
The guest stars on this show are just as strong as the regular cast.  The Aaron Echolls character is one of my favorites, despite the fact that he is a scumbag.  Hamlin plays him so well and gives a lot of depth to a role that, in the wrong hands, could make Aaron Echolls very one-dimensional.  While the producers weren't able to get a lot of huge guest stars, they did get Alyson Hannigan for an episode as Logan's step-sister Trina Echolls, and the results were great.
Many people have called this show ""the next Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", and I would have to agree with them.  The writing and acting are on par with the amazing BtVS, and of all the shows that have used the theme of either ""girl power"" or ""high school metaphors"" (there's Charmed, Smallville, Kim Possible, and a bunch of others), this is by far the best and its mission statement is the closest to that of Buffy.  The twist is that while the aforementioned shows involve some sort of special powers (witches, Superman, super secret agent with gadgets), Veronica has no powers.  She is an ordinary girl with an extraoridnary mind.  And that is probably one of its greatest strengths; while it aspires to be as great and in the same vein as Buffy, it does not blatantly rip off the premise.
As I said at the beginning of this review, the two shows that most people credit for bringing back scripted TV this year were Lost and Desperate Housewives, even though most television critics listed Veronica Mars as just as worthy of that honor.  Sadly, this show didn't get very high ratings, and many people ignored it (I didn't see it until the second-to-last episode of the season, but what do they expect, it's on UPN!).  Fortunately, it won E! Online's annual ""Save Our Show"" poll with a huge margin over the number two show (Arrested Development, which thankfully won a similar poll in USA Today, which probably helped that show get a third season).  I think that, without winning the poll, Veronica Mars would have been cancelled at the end of the season, and that would have been a shame.  Fortunately, it has been renewed, and there were a few cliffhangers in the season finale that I can't wait to see resolved.  This is a great show, and it has something for everyone.  It's definitely worth a look.",1122595200,29,6439,4.637323943661972

2377514,5,B000A59PMO,"Lost and Desperate Housewives got all the hype last season. They were supposed to be the pendulum swing away from Reality programming and back to quality hour long scripted drama. But the outstanding freshman drama of 2004-2005 was Veronica Mars.

Desperate Housewives descended into soap opera. Lost failed to deliver a plot to go along with its pretty and talented cast. Veronica Mars on UPN, on the other hand, proceeded to show the big boy networks how it is done.

Veronica Mars is a well scripted,  phenomenally acted show that rewarded its viewers with a complete story arc that answered all questions posed in the pilot.

The cast is mostly young unknowns who proved their talent and ability to engage the audience with an engrossing storyline. The show is smart, funny, tragic, romantic and film noir all rolled into one pleasing confection.

The incredibly talented Kristen Bell (Showtime's Reefer Madness) stars as Veronica Mars. She is a high school student who has lost everything. Her rich boyfriend broke up with her with no explanation. Her best friend was murdered. Veronica's  sheriff father lost his job in the ensuing investigation, while Veronica lost her social status as a result. Her mother abandoned the family. Veronica was drugged and raped.

In order to make ends meet her father becomes a private investigator and Veronica works in his office after school  All this is laid out in the pilot.

Kristen makes you believe this character with every frame in which she appears.

Rob Thomas, a former teacher and creator of the too quickly cancelled Cupid, is the mind behind Veronica Mars. He knows today's high school students and presents them in a fairly matter of fact fashion.

Kids drink. They do stupid things. There are consequences. And they are cruel to outsiders and Veronica is an outsider. Just not as much as she likes to think. She manages to make quite a few friends along the way, solving cases for fellow students who need her help, as well as helping her dad with his cases.

Unlike the claustrophobic sets of many high school shows where characters rarely interact with anyone outside the main cast except for the MOTW plot, classmates you meet in early episodes here actually reappear in later episodes and even with limited screen time their stories seem as rich as the main characters stories.

Veronica is not perfect or always right. She does not give self-righteous speeches. She is all about Old Testament 'eye for an eye"" vengeance. She is complicated.

She has a loving relationship with her father. A sweetly supportive platonic best friend Wallace. Weevil is the leader of the local motorcyle gang as well as Veronica's muscle when she needs a favor. Duncan is the ex-boyfriend with secrets to hide. And Logan, played by the excellent Jason Dohring, is the snarky rich kid that makes her heart beat faster even when she hates herself for it.

Veronica, in short, is a self admitted ""trainwreck"". And watching her sort out the mysteries in her life while sorting out her place in Neptune high school is a pure pleasure.

Thankfully the DVD's will be out in October. Unfortunately the second season of Veronica Mars starts Wednesdays on UPN in September. Try to catch the show in reruns to be up to speed for the second season of this wonderful show!",1121558400,31,3303,4.86096256684492

Veronica Mars, like Buffy Summers and Sydney Bristow before her, joins the ranks of strong female characters on television.  The difference is, Veronica is tackling the demons of life and she does it all without superpowers or spy gadgets.

In a nutshell, Veronica Mars used to have the perfect teen life.  When her best friend is murdered, she loses everything: her boyfriend, her social status, her mother, and the life she has always known.  With only her private detective father left to count on, Veronica picks herself up and does her best to move on, determined to find out who really killed her best friend.

The show hits the ground running with an excellent pilot, and things just keep getting better from there.  Creator and executive producer Rob Thomas originally conceived Veronica Mars as a novel, so the characters and the mystery develop at a very natural pace from episode to episode.  The cast is incredible and full of young up and comers, from Kristen Bell (who carries the show on her tiny but capable shoulders) to the amazing Jason Dohring.

Veronica is the updated hipper version of Nancy Drew (who I adored growing up) and it's just such a great dramedy....it's got the drama (can anyone say- mama drama? perhaps ""did I sleep with my brother??"") it's got the comedy, it's got the mystery, danger, so forth...It's just a wonderfully delightful show and I can't wait for season 2!!",1121212800,4,500,4.693181818181818
2377522,5,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars is a brilliantly written, tightly paced show with dark, intricate storytelling and lots of humor. It gets a lot of comparisons to Buffy because its lead character is a tiny blonde teen who takes no prisoners and is always quick with a clever comeback, but in many ways VM is a more complex and intriguing show, and there are almost no ""fight scenes"" and no fantasy elements. Unlike Buffy, Veronica has no superpowers and knows she can't ""kick butt"" when she is trying to bring down the bad guys. She has only her intelligence and her wits to keep her ahead of the game. Plus, when the going gets rough, she has her trusty dog Backup to scare off the evildoers.

Veronica is frequently described as a ""modern day Nancy Drew,"" but she is also much more than that. Yes, she does work for her private investigator dad tracking down missing persons and solving other mysteries both large and small, and her weapons of choice are modern-day tools like the internet, cell phones, and Lojack. But Veronica is not your typical peppy teenage girl. She is the anti-cheerleader, a very angry girl who is more likely to taunt her classmates with clever insults than to provide any cheer. While she does have her softer side, it's well hidden and she doesn't reveal it very often. She didn't always used to be this way, and the series takes it time exploring, via flashbacks, how Veronica used to be in the past and why she became so angry and isolated from her peers.

If you have wanted to watch the show but have been put off by the ""teen"" angle, rest assured that there truly is something for everyone here, of any age. The writing is sophisticated and adult. These teens do things like quote Hamlet and make pop-culture references as widely varied as Heathers to Brigadoon, so the dialogue is frequently quippy and never boring. But the humor never takes over the entire show to make it too light, and the tone is pretty dark overall, considering that the underlying mystery driving Veronica for the entire season is finding the person who murdered her best friend Lilly Kane. Add to that some story lines involving rape, incest, and child abuse, and it's clear that this is no comedy. It's also not for children and sometimes tests the bounds of what you might see on network television in terms of the darkness of the subject matter. Drugs, alcohol, and sex are portrayed as a fact of life among teenagers and the show is not moralizing or preachy in any way, although it frequently portrays the sometimes tragic consequences of all of the above.

Kristen Bell is astonishingly good as Veronica, but the entire cast is for the most part pretty first-rate, especially Enrico Colantoni (as her dad Keith Mars) and Jason Dohring (as her arch-nemesis Logan Echolls). If you are a fan of twisty ongoing mysteries like Lost or Twin Peaks, or you enjoy the quippy humor of the Gilmore Girls or the O.C., or even if you like old-fashioned detective stories like Columbo or the Rockford Files, give Veronica Mars a try because it truly combines the best of all of the above. And if you are a guy, Kristen Bell is pretty darn cute, to boot. So there's that, too.",1121126400,31,3159,4.617437722419929
2377523,5,B000A59PMO,"Once in a while, you stumble upon a show that hooks you in at the beginning, then slowly it begins to lose your interest for a while then maybe near the end leave you perhaps intrigued enough to tune in next season.
Well, once in a blue moon do you stumble upon a show that hooks you in at the beginning only to build intensity and quality as the show progresses, leaving your heart to race on many ocassions, building momentum as it comes to a spectacular final three episodes evoking emotions such as joy, shock, rage, and sadness all at the same time. Ladies, gentlemen, young adults, teenagers Veronica Mars IS this type of show!
This little UPN show proved itself as the next craze...even though it had to go up against some tough competition in the form of Law and Order:SUV, House, Amazing Race, and One Tree Hill. Nonetheless, a devoted fan base emerged creating much talk and debate among show plot lines, characters and couples.
Veronica Mars is a show centered by a young, sassy, intelligent, spy woman (often referred to the Nancy Drew of the 21st century) who has a few issues that all stem from one event, her best friends murder:
First the obvious, ""Who killed Lilly Kane?""
Also, after her father wrongfully accuses Lilly's father for her murder, Veronica is torn to chose who she will stand by, her father now an outcast, fired as detective , or the popular circle of friends who think she's now crazy. Needless to say she loses her friends and her boyfriend (Lilly's brother ) but gains a chip on the shoulder and a heck of a lot of determination in order to re-gain her fathers respect and put Lilly's ghost to rest by making it her mission to solve her murder.
And if that's not enough, she was also drug raped at a party, and has no idea what happened that night.
These mysteries and questions are the major plot arcs of the season...they are all raised at the beginning of the season and finally answered in the finale two episodes. How we get from the beginning to the grand finale is pure, poetic television! Sure there are the minor plot lines in-between, and the episodic mysteries much like Smallville was first season...but there is no rock left unturned...the writers and producers thought of everything, and leave their audience feeling excited and satisfied at the end...as well as a little crazy because there is another cliff hanger that leaves you wanting more!
Now the actors headed by Kristen Bell (Veronica), her father played by Enrico Colontoni and Perry Daggs III as the best friend Wallace give outstanding performances. They are supported by Jason Dohring (Logan Echolls) who makes you want to love and hate his character, Francis Capra as Weevil our lovable bad-boy, and Teddy Dunn who is Veronica's ex Duncan Kane. Many diss Dunn's performance but I believe he really came into his own near the second half of the season and surpassed all my expectations during the final two episodes. In all, I guess what I'm getting at is that the show is well-casted, and this is hard to do considering that the supporting cast (there are many more I have not mentioned) is a large number of characters important to the progression and suspense of the major plot lines, because they make their characters believable the audience in turn can be taken in so easily by this story and truly care about these characters.
I'm glad they're coming out with this season before season two begins because it only means that more people are going to be taken by this series. There are 22 episodes plus extras included are:
""a Director's Cut of the Pilot episode, plus 25 minutes of unaired scenes and bloopers"" (tvshowsondvd.com)
I know the extras are few but the producers and the network wanted to get this out as soon as possible, so hopefully they will make up for extras on the season two set!
Just know, that you will not be able to stop watching once you've started...my cousin and I got to the point where we couldn't have anybody else making noise in the room when we were watching mars and by the finale we were going crazy jumping up and down and screaming at the screen! This show is a can't miss for any mystery lover...and well, for anyone who appreciates strong willed protagonist like Veronica Mars, you'll be cheering her on the whole way through.",1121126400,17,4282,4.642951251646904

2377527,5,B000A59PMO,"In my almost 28 years of watching (and being addicted to) television, I had NEVER written to a network's executives to thank them for a job well-done. Veronica Mars swooped in and changed all that.

This is just a fantasticly written, stellarly performed dramedy. The actors are given incredible material to work with each week and the cast (led by the fiercely talented Kristen Bell) makes the material sparkle. There's not a bad egg in the bunch. Kristen Bell deserves all the praise she has received -- and then some--there aren't many actors who have chemistry with everyone they're put onscreen with, yet she does!

And let's not forget the supporting players. Three in particular stand-out for me:

Jason Dohring (as Logan Echolls) has the uncanny ability to make you want to slap him, hug him, laugh at him, laugh with him and just basically stand in awe of his performance in every scene--no matter how small. This guy isn't another run-of-the-mill Hollywood prettyboy out to see his picture plastered on movie posters. You can tell how dedicated he is to his craft--he simply oozes talent.

Enrico Colantoni (as Keith Mars) does a terrific job playing Veronica's father and former town Sheriff. His offbeat humor made me hestitant at first but very soon I came to love every scene he was in.

Francis Capra (as Eli ""Weevil"" Navarro) has yet to get as much screen time as I'd like. But I am impressed with his ability to take a fairly ""vanilla"" scene and twist it and turn it to make it his own. It takes a deft performer to make his 3-minute scene more memorable than the plot's ""A"" story!

Oh, I love every one of them--even the recurring characters! But I'll stop there. Bottomline: If you enjoy quality television where everyone in front of and behind the camera clearly is at the ""top of their game"" then buy this DVD AND don't forget to watch the second season this fall on UPN--Wednesdays at 9pm. Veronica Mars epitomizes appointment television!",1120780800,36,1960,4.75

2377529,5,B000A59PMO,"""Veronica Mars"" is one of those rare tv shows that one the outside seem like a wannabe, but when you watch it, it only takes a few minutes before it gets its hooks into you and doesn't let you go; it just straps you in for one hell of a ride.  Ever since the demise of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"" I have been searching the air waves for a worthy replacement with ""Gilmore Girls"" becoming the only option.  But then last September I read a newspaper article titled ""Buffy the next generation"" and out of pure curiosity I tuned into an MTV rerun of the pilot.

Within minutes I was hooked, but I didn't know why.  The show looked like the OC, talked like Buffy, acted like Gilmore Girls, and felt like nothing I have ever seen.  I couldn't quite put my finger on it but the show kept bringing me back for more.  Finally I realized that there where two reasons.  The first was the incredible writting.  No show in the annals of history was written like ""buffy the vampire slayer"" but Veronica Mars is giving her a run for her money.  The creators happen to fill the seasons full of episodes that although having no pure focus on the season-long plot, but they helped the season arc along its merry way every single week (that takes alot of planning and pathents) and instead of felling rushed like ""angel"" or being a letdown like ""x-files"" it leads to a sacisfactory ending.  The second reason this show is so likable is the incredible Kristine Bell.  There is no comment to praisworthy not to fit ms. bell, she has the looks of sarah michelle gellar (without the nasty aura), she has the vocabulary of Lauren Grahm, the charm of alyson hannigan, and the innocence of Dakota Flanning.  It will be a downright shame is the Emmys don't recongize her this Thursday was a nomination.

I've gone on about how awesome the show is, yet I havn't really told you what it is about.  The show is about Veronica Mars, a 17-year-old girl thats live in the town of Neptune, California (a San Diego Suburb where either your parents makes millions of dollars a year or works for the parents that makes millions of dollars a year) and has a part-time job as the secretary or her father's detective agency, but most the time she is doing the detiving.  The main plot that takes the entire season to play out is how a few months ago her best friend was murdered and at the time her dad was the sheriff and he blamed the girls parents which caused the town to out him of the sheriff position and in turned made Veronica go from Popular to geek.  Durring the season Veronica puts the clues together to who married her friend, and how it was covered up.

There is noway that a person can fit enough good things about this show in one review... And there are no negitive comments that i can think of.  If you are a fan of quality television this is the show for you!  The second season premieres on UPN in september so you might want to tivo those episodes and watch them after this amazing box set which includes deleted scenes, directors cut of the pilot, and Bloopers....

A great lead with some great chemistry with just about everyone in the cast (especially Logan) and an intruiging season long mystery to solve (actually 2 mysteries).  Thats probably why no network in the UK has picked it up yet, instead showing crap like Big Brother and other reality (read BORING) shows. Anyway I've just read somewhere that the dvd box set is out mid October although unfortunately with almost no extras on it.

Where I live we don't get the UPN network, our local CBS station does however show the UPN shows, they're just aired at 3A.M!! So I had heard about Veronica Mars, and even seen some promos, but I'm thinking that this is just CSI, but for a younger demographic. Well, I was wrong. One CRAZY sleepless night I turn on my TV. Nothing was on but this show I had heard about, Veronica Mars. After one episode I was hooked. Since I came into the show mid season I had so many questions. I began taping the show every week so I could get the next installment, and get my questions answered. There are still a few episodes I missed, but now that the DVD is coming out, I will totally be able to catch up!

I am still trying to get my friends to watch the show, but because it's on UPN, people automatically think that it's bad TV, I mean common this is the station that sanctioned a show called ""Homeboys in Space"". But VERONICA MARS is an ""A"" list show. I only wish it could get as much coverage as say Desperate Housewives, or Lost. Hopefully, VERONICA MARS has found it's audience, they're moving the show to Wednesday, and it's up against some stiff competition. Still I think it's fan base is hardcore.

2377536,5,B000A59PMO,"Incredibly intricate plotting, witty, original writing, and unbelieveably talented acting....just a few reasons why this show is so great. Kristin Bell is absolutely incandescent as a teenage girl who, in the course of a year, is dumped by her first love w/ no explanation, loses a best friend (murdered), her sheriff father is removed from office, shunned by her peers, and is abandoned by her alcoholic mother. Oh, and she woke up one morning after a party, having lost her virginity and no memory of how it occurred. Revenge, finding out the truth, and reuniting her family are her new priorities. Rather different from most teenage girls. The story is told from her perspective and follows her search for the truth and the growth that occurs along the way. Not to mention when she finally finds it and deals with it.

The characters are given depth and layers to their personality. Gradually, some are peeled back so we the audience begin to understand their motivations and actions. No one is quite what they seem. The writers and actors are to be commended on their creation of original, fascinating, yet believeable, characters. Jason Dohring's portrayal of Logan, in particular, has progressed through the transformation from an ""obligatory psychotic jackass"" to a troubled, but ultimately decent person. One whose motivations we can understand and sympathize with.

The pacing of the mystery is outstanding. This is not one of those shows that leaves you frustrated b/c it drags out the mystery and tension so thin, you're feel cheated, or worse, bored by the time the final reveal happens. No, Veronica Mars (S1) gives you a tantalizing glimpse of the truth in each episode, before revealing all in the thrilling final two episodes. Although the season does end on a mini-cliffhanger, I was more than satisfied with the resolution of the major mysteries presented by the pilot episode.

So if you like film noir, or good teenage dramas, or sharp, witty dialogue, or good mysteries where things are unexpected yet ring true, or amazing acting, or just good story-telling, Veronica Mars delivers. A truly excellent show.",1117670400,18,2128,5.0397727272727275

Rarely do characters have as much depth as the ones on this show.  Comparing this to Buffy the Vampire Slayer doesn't do this show justice.  The high school setting of Neptune High is authentic and credible.  The ongoing whodunit plot drives you to watch every week while a ""mystery"" gets solved every week giving you satisfaction.  And unlike other shows, (i.e., Lost) the finale was extremely satisfying wrapping up the suspense.  This is a sign of great writing that demonstrates a confidence in its characters to carry through to a second season.  Absolutely a must see.  If you're not watching, you're missing the best show on tv.  Next year, it will air opposite of Lost on Wednesdays at 9:00 on UPN.  Take it from me, this is guaranteed to more interesting than Lost, which seems to be taking a turn to the bizarre.",1117670400,7,1185,4.75
2377538,5,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars is a student at Neptune High School who's best friend, Lilly Kane, was murdered, her mom has jumped town, she has been raped, her boyfriend has abruptly broke up with her, and she's an outcast because her father wrongly (maybe) accused her dead best friend's dad with being the murderer. And that's just what we learn from the first episode. The next twenty-one episode revolve around Veronica trying to find out why her mom left and where she went to, who raped her, and who killed Lilly. The later of which could have been almost anyone who came into contact with the youngest Kane, and Veronica just happen to have a file on every one of them.

When Veronica's not looking for her mom or Lilly's killer, Veronica works for her dad who is a private investigator. This leads to the mystery of the week, this is what gave the show its comparisons to The X-Files and Buffy the Vampire Slayer except all the monsters in Neptune are real people. Some of the better side stories include Veronica thwarting a group of computer nerd who extort money through the internet (The Wrath of Con), she hunts down the person who is posting fake purity tests of other students including herself (Live a Virgin), she tries to catch the students who set her up for making fake ID's (Clash of the Tritons), she find a student accused of making bomb threats (Weapons of Class Destruction), and she tries to keep a student from posting an explicit video of his ex-girlfriend on the internet (M.A.D.).

Along with the great storylines, the show is also has a great cast. Kristen Bell shines as Veronica, who can hit each smart-alic line with ease but can also nail all the emotional scenes that Sarah Michelle Gellar couldn't quite hit as Buffy. And where Jennifer Garner always comes off as slutty in her many undercover costumes, Bell pulls off all her costumes with a cute as button touch to them. Supporting Bell are Enrico Colantoni, best known as the balding photographer on Just Shoot Me, as papa Mars and a bunch of young actors in the first major roles. Percy Daggs III as Wallace and Francis Capra as Weevil do the best with their roles but I don't think Teddy Dunn pulled off the complexity of Duncan Kane as the season wore on.

The show was sprinkled with the multitude of familiar faces with Alyson Hannigan (Buffy), Joey Lauren Adams (Mallrats), Anthony Anderson (Barbershop), Lisa Rinna (Melrose Place), Paula Marshall (Cupid), Paris Hilton (One Night in Paris), and a double shot of the Home Improvement Boys Zachary Ty Bryan and Jonathan Taylor Tomas all making a cameo or two. Other stars making recurring appearances included Harry Hamlin (L.A. Law) as a movie star/abusive father, Amanda Seyfried (Mean Girls) as the most popular girl in school turned murder victim Lilly Kane, and being rescued from the crap that was Napoleon Dynamite was Tina Majorino who played Mac, the computer whiz who helped Veronica on all her digital cases.

Unlike other big shows of this season (*couch* Lost *cough*), Veronica Mars answered all the big questions posed this season: who raped Veronica, where did Veronica mom go, and most importantly, not to mention most shocking, who killed Lilly Kane. Although there are some important questions that will be answered next season like who was Veronica glad to see (my guess - Wallace) and what did Weevil and his boys do to Logan (my guess - he ends up next to his dad). And a question that may not be answered quickly, is Lynn Echolls really dead.",1117324800,10,3494,4.722950819672131
2377539,5,B000A59PMO,"WARNING:  SPOILERS!

The 2004-2005 will hopefully go down as one of the most important seasons in recent television history, not because there was such a plethora of great new series-there weren't-but because it was the beginning of the end of the dominance of reality programming and the rebirth of the scripted television show.  The two shows that are getting most of the credit for the sudden demise of the reality show are the two mega-hits on ABC, LOST and DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, but I hope that UPN's lovely VERONICA MARS will get at least some credit.  If LOST and VERONICA MARS are the face of things to come, rather than WIFE SWAP or THE SWAN, then the future for TV could be very bright indeed.

Of all the series that were developed in the wake of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, VERONICA MARS hues most closely to the original (especially in Buffy's high school years) and is one of the best.  [October 2005 addition:  VERONICA MARS in its second season is highlighting the ties to BUFFY not merely by bringing BUFFY regular Alyson Hannigan back for a brief appearance, but having Charisma Carpenter as a semi-regular and BUFFY creator Joss Whedon as a guest star in one episode in November.  Salon.com did its part by awarding this years Buffy Award, for the best show on TV neglected by the Emmys--and named for the Best Show ever ignored by the Emmys--to VERONICA MARS.]  If we were to describe the original recipe for the show, it is about 50% BUFFY, 20% NANCY DREW, 15% BEVERLY HILLS 90210, and 15% TWIN PEAKS.  In other words, the show is about a super cable blonde high school student who takes on do-badders and tilts the scales of justice, who is an amateur female sleuth, whose escapades all take play in her upper class high school with a contingent of working class students, and who in her spare time investigates the mystery of the death of her best friend Laura Palmer . . . er, ah, I mean Lily Kane.

At the start of the series, Veronica can look back at a very bad year.  Her best friend died; her father, the former sheriff, was fired because of disapproval of his handling of the investigation; her boyfriend, Duncan Kane, and the brother of the deceased Lily, has broken up with her; because of her father's firing and the snubbing of her by Duncan and his friends, the formerly popular Veronica finds herself ostracized by her fellow students, especially after her drugging and rape at a party provide her with the label of being a party girl (all expressed by the superb theme song ""We Used to Be Friends"" by The Dandy Warhols); and in the aftermath of her father's firing, her mother mysteriously disappeared and hasn't been seen or heard from in months.  But Veronica is nothing if not resilient, and she is not one to passively take the misfortunes that life heaps upon one.  In other words, she has spunk, as well as a quick and inventive wit and lifetime supply of street smarts.  Upon being made ex-sheriff, her father sets up as a private detective, and Lily serves both as his receptionist and aide, and ends up having a bit of a practice at school once her reputation as one who can resolve awkward situations begins to spread.  By the end of the season one might find Veronica struggling with three mysteries at once, the ongoing one of Lily's death, as well as whatever her father is working on, and some friend at school.

All in all, I found the first season to be thoroughly fascinating and persistently entertaining.  The structure of the narrative is a bit of a blend of the long-story-arc episode and the stand-alone episode.  Each episode will move the core story for that episode forward, while also taking up any of a number of the ongoing mysteries.  And there are a host of mysteries.  For instance, we wonder about who are the biological parents of who, whether the have been inadvertent incestuous relationships, and characters who run away to escape the difficulties.  Through it all it the utterly unflappable Veronica, utterly determined to get at the truth of things.  By the end of the season the big arc for that season-who killed Lily Kane-is solved, thanks to Veronica.

Veronica Mars is a great character who is more than aptly handled by the extraordinarily cute Kristen Bell, who is perfect for the role except for the fact that she is a bit too old to be playing a high school junior.  She is so otherwise perfect for the role it is easy to overlook the age gaffe.  Although Veronica is a transparent girl-power heroine in the tradition of BUFFY, she stands apart from other such heroines such as Max Guevara and Sydney Bristow in not having especial super powers or abilities, and has no special mystical destiny.  What is Veronica's special power?  Her quick wit.  That's it!  She just thinks faster than others.  She emerges as both a great strategic and tactical thinker, always two or three steps ahead of everyone else, always anticipating what someone else's response is going to be.  Very rarely is she surprised by someone, or unable to response instantly to a variation.

The rest of the characters form a nice and believable group of characters.  They largely fall into the competent and outstanding categories.  In fact, the only three I would not place merely into the competent category are Enrico Colantoni, who is superb as Veronica's dad Keith.  Though they sometimes disagree on things, throughout the show they are obviously the greatest of friends, and when they need to be, great colleagues.  Keith tries to protect his daughter, but he also knows that she is someone of rather prodigious abilities, so he doesn't always try to stand in her way.  He has a great kid, and he knows it.  The only other cast member I think deserves especial notice is Jason Dohring as the mercurial Logan Echolls, who at various times in the course of the season is sadistic, vulnerable, angry, magnanimous, courageous, cruel, tender, grateful, selfish, and romantic.  If you don't like him one week, wait a couple of episodes and reevaluate.  One bit of casting irony should be noted.  Francisco Capra plays Weevil, the head of the local motorcycle gang.  In fact, he is a member of one of the most thoroughly connected families in the history of Hollywood, his great grandfather being the great director Frank Capra, his grandfather one of the great power brokers in Hollywood, and he father nearly as active in a host of tinsel town activities.  So much for his outsider cred.  Nonetheless, Capra, despite being the ultimate Hollywood insider, does a good job as one of the school's bad boys.

All in all, this was a great first season, with a great series of storylines, one of the best season-long mysteries to be unraveled in ages, and a group of characters we come to care for.  The show ended with most of the loose ends tied up, probably in part an instance of defensive writing on the part of the production team.  With a bevy of rather shocking cancellations in recent years, a lot of writers decide to end a season as if they were ending the season.  WONDERFALLS is a great example of this.  We are sure to see more.  Thankfully, UPN renewed VERONICA MARS, so we'll get to see the spunky, resourceful, irrepressible high school sleuth back in action for a least one more season, and hopefully for more.  And maybe, just maybe the powers-that-be in Hollywood will realize that this kind of quality scripted television with long story arcs, and not forgettable, cheap, unrehearsed reality shows are what viewers really want.",1117238400,482,7498,4.710889570552148
2377540,5,B000A59PMO,"""Veronica Mars"" is a lot smarter than your average show featuring attractive teenage characters. To use the term ""teen drama"" is misleading, as the story is darker, subtler and more sophisticated than other shows like ""The O.C."" and ""Dawson's Creek."" It's a modern twist on the noir genre placed in high school, centering around 17-year-old Veronica, once popular but now a social outcast after a chain of events following the murder of her best friend, Lilly Kane.

In every episode, Veronica, a P.I.'s daughter, solves a smaller mystery, while also assembling clues and delving further into the bigger mystery of Lilly's case. The brilliance of the show is in tying the small cases into the larger, overarching themes surrounding the larger mystery. While there are a few episodes that feel more stand-alone, as is the case in all TV drama series, the writers do an excellent job in avoiding letting them become mere filler, throwaway cases -- instead, they use them to feed us more information to further Lilly's case. (As a result, it's hard to skip any episodes without missing some crucial bit of information about the main msytery.)

It's amazing how carefully drawn the entire season is, with clues placed in a meticulously careful, controlled manner, all amping up to an intense crescendo in the last four or five episodes. As the season draws to a close, the intricately laid details click into place as Veronica solves the two biggest cases -- the mystery of her rape (which occurred shortly following Lilly's death and her subsequent ejection from the ""cool"" crowd) in the penultimate episode (a wonderfully complex, dark and emotional episode), then Lilly's murder in the season finale.

Despite the darkness of the series, there are notable lighter moments too, and the show has quite a bit of humor thrown into the mix. The writing is witty and smart, and the actors pull off comedy just as capably as they do angst and drama. The cast is excellent, and the actors have noticeable chemistry with one another, but two standouts are Kristen Bell as Veronica and Jason Dohring as Logan Echolls (who has an amazingly complex  character arc that is drastic, enthralling and utterly believable). As Veronica's former friend, nemesis, then reluctant ally (and the lines blur frequently), Dohring steals every scene he's in, and when he's with Bell the sparks really fly, whether they're pushing each other's buttons, antagonizing each other or simply bantering.

Man, I love this show. Thank goodness UPN had the guts to renew it for a second season.",1116633600,27,2558,4.995305164319249
2377541,5,B000A59PMO,"I started watching Veronica Mars mid-season, when One Tree Hill was on hiatus.  I could kick myself for not watching this show from the beginning.  I stopped watching One Tree Hill and the O.C. because the shows have little substance to them and the characters are bland.  Veronica Mars's characters are multidimensial.  Nobody is completely perfect or innocent, and the guilty usually have redeeming qualities.  Veronica's cases usually have a twist in them, like you end up feeling sorry for the bad guy who gets caught.  I was a big fan of Desperate Housewives and still watch it, but I think Veronica Mars's mysteries are done better.  VM is the best show of 2004 and is still the only show I'm looking forward to in the fall of 2005.  It is a smart show and way better than mindless reality shows or dumb shows on the major networks.  Do yourself a favor, and ""get a clue.""  Give this show a chance.  You won't regret it.",1116633600,14,926,4.551515151515152
2377542,5,B000A59PMO,"Veronica Mars is a brilliantly written, tightly paced show with dark, intricate storytelling and lots of humor. It gets a lot of comparisons to Buffy because its lead character is a tiny blonde teen who takes no prisoners and is always quick with a clever comeback, but in many ways VM is a more complex and intriguing show, and there are almost no ""fight scenes"" and no fantasy elements. Unlike Buffy, Veronica has no superpowers and knows she can't ""kick butt"" when she is trying to bring down the bad guys. She has only her intelligence and her wits to keep her ahead of the game. Plus, when the going gets rough, she has her trusty dog Backup to scare off the evildoers.

Veronica is frequently described as a ""modern day Nancy Drew,"" but she is also much more than that. Yes, she does work for her private investigator dad tracking down missing persons and solving other mysteries both large and small, and her weapons of choice are modern-day tools like the internet, cell phones, and Lojack. But Veronica is not your typical peppy teenage girl. She is the anti-cheerleader, a very angry girl who is more likely to taunt her classmates with clever insults than to provide any cheer. While she does have her softer side, it's well hidden and she doesn't reveal it very often. She didn't always used to be this way, and the series takes it time exploring, via flashbacks, how Veronica used to be in the past and why she became so angry and isolated from her peers.

If you have wanted to watch the show but have been put off by the ""teen"" angle, rest assured that there truly is something for everyone here, of any age. The writing is sophisticated and adult. These teens do things like quote Hamlet and make pop-culture references as widely varied as Heathers to Brigadoon, so the dialogue is frequently quippy and never boring. But the humor never takes over the entire show to make it too light, and the tone is pretty dark overall, considering that the underlying mystery driving Veronica for the entire season is finding the person who murdered her best friend Lilly Kane. Add to that some story lines involving rape, incest, and child abuse, and it's clear that this is no comedy. It's also not for children and sometimes tests the bounds of what you might see on network television in terms of the darkness of the subject matter. Drugs, alcohol, and sex are portrayed as a fact of life among teenagers and the show is not moralizing or preachy in any way, although it frequently portrays the sometimes tragic consequences of all of the above.

Kristen Bell is astonishingly good as Veronica, but the entire cast is for the most part pretty first-rate, especially Enrico Colantoni (as her dad Keith Mars) and Jason Dohring (as her arch-nemesis Logan Echolls). If you are a fan of twisty ongoing mysteries like Lost or Twin Peaks, or you enjoy the quippy humor of the Gilmore Girls or the O.C., or even if you like old-fashioned detective stories like Columbo or the Rockford Files, give Veronica Mars a try because it truly combines the best of all of the above. And if you are a guy, Kristen Bell is pretty darn cute, to boot. So there's that, too.",1116547200,13,3159,4.617437722419929
