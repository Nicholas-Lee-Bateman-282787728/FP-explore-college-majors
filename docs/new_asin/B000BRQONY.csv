8091645,3,B000BRQONY,"Movie moves too fast.  Not enough background to explain how this family really lived.  If I had not read all the books on this family, I would not have liked the movie at all.",1401062400,,175,4.117647058823529
8091646,5,B000BRQONY,"IF YOU LOVE MARY TYLER MOORE, YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE.  SHE IS WONDERFUL IN IT.  NOTHING LIKE THE WAY WE KNEW HER ON TELEVISION.  WHAT A FINE ACTRESS SHE IS.  VERY DEEP, DARK ROLE FOR HER, AND SHE PLAYS IT WONDERFULLY.  THE SUPPORTING CAST IS ALSO VERY GOOD, AND JEAN STAPLETON IS TERRIFIC.
QUICK SERVICE AND CAME WRAPPED NICELY.  THANK YOU.",1336003200,3,341,4.419354838709677
8091647,5,B000BRQONY,"This is based on a true story.  Mary Tyler Moore is very good, not as she has appeared as Laura Petrie or Mary Richards.  I liked this made for TV movie a lot when first saw it a long time ago. So when I found it available I wanted the DVD in my collection.",1291161600,2,257,3.740740740740741
8091648,5,B000BRQONY,"First rate acting all around and Mary Tyler Moore is thoroughly chilling as ultimate scam artist turned murderer Sante Kimes. What makes this story all the more fascinating is that it is based on the real life crimes of mother and son Sante & Kenneth Kimes. And what a treat to see ""All in the Family's"" Jean Stapleton as socialite victim Irene Silverman. The pace never lags as this thriller switches back and forth between past and present as it outlines Kimes' mental delusions and their ultimately tragic effect on her sons,her family and innocent bystanders.",1283040000,7,563,4.875
