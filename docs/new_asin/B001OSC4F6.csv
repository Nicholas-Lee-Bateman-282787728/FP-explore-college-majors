It is a perfect intro to Tai Chi and easy to do.  It will make you feel super relaxed by the end of the pm workout.  Ready to conquer the day by the end of the am workout.  Also a good way to get your body moving if you haven't worked out in a while or at all.",1481068800,,337,3.3506493506493507

3736115,3,B001OSC4F6,"I have been wanting to learn Tai Chi for years, and actually had a friend who recommended this video to me for beginners. In all honestly, the video was pretty boring. I had bought Qi Gong for Beginners, and felt that it was to slow for me since I've done some yoga and Pilates in the past. I'm glad there's a step by step breakdown, but it takes so long, I'm just ready to be done with it by the time you get to put the movement into practice. If you've never experienced any coordinated body movement exercises, it would probably be a great video, but if you're looking to do Tai Chi without a lot of stopping and explaining movements, I would look at another video.",1473724800,5,668,4.267716535433071

3736118,5,B001OSC4F6,"Really love this DVD, easy to follow, relaxing and the perfect length.  Each segment runs about 30 minutes, my favorite was the PM workout which I often do in the AM but I really love them both.  Have been doing the workouts for about three weeks as I started with Scott Coles other workout Balance and Mobility.  I was recovering from a ruptured Bakers Cyst is my right leg followed by Sciatica in the same leg which took about 5 months to heal but left the leg very weak.  I started with the Balance and mobility DVD but, at first  could  only do it for about 15 minutes, but after about a two weeks the workout seemed slow so I got the AM/PM which I can do for the 30 minutes at a time.
  I notice the leg is much stronger, with better balance, and my walk is much more fluid.  When the leg got tired It became painful and I walked with a slight limp, which is entirely gone now.  I tried a Tai Chi class before I got the Balance and Mobility DVD but my leg got too tired with the hour long class, I was just exhausted and the leg hurt for two days after.
  The DVD AM/PM is just perfect for rehab now as I can just stop if I get tired or have pain.  I did the Better Balance workout starting once every other day working up to the AM/PM DVD twice a day routine.
 I think the switching legs in a fluid manner that Tai Chi offers has helped a great deal with healing my painful leg injury.  My goal for the fall is to enroll in a live class at the local Tai Chi studio which both of Scott Cole's DVD's helped me prepare for.",1467936000,,1526,4.006622516556291

3736129,5,B001OSC4F6,"Best to learn from because he does the exercises facing you, but says ""move your right arm out to the side"" as he moves his left--so you can learn the movements more easily than watching someone's back, or watching them move the opposite direction than you are supposed to by their voice command. THe mirror image helps. I love the commentary that shows the meaning of some of the movements: push struggles away, bring loving kindness in as push and pull moves are done is affirming.",1444435200,3,483,4.627906976744186

The method of mirroring Scott Cole makes it easy to follow along. I like the choice of the two 30 minute workouts and mix them up. Also, it's nice b/c each 30 minute workout is broken into three parts with instruction for the different moves, another with his voice prompts, and then a third just following along without his voice.  Some mornings I am busy and only do one of the segments which is about 10 minutes. It still feels good.  I am impressed.",1441670400,6,608,4.135593220338983

3736159,5,B001OSC4F6,"I had the VCR version of this routine for years. Until I no longer had a VCR and had to get the DVD! This routine is an excellent introduction to Tai Chi. I tried the AM routine but it was too short and not worth doing (IMO). The PM routine, however, is excellent. I really like Scott Cole as an instructor. I've taken Tai Chi for years so the movements were not new to me but I think he does a very good job of explaining the movements before going into the flow sequence. The sequence is short, about 20 minutes more or less and very calming. I use it to relax before going to bed. I also use this DVD as a transition piece if I've stopped any sort of exercise for a period of time. I tend to do that. I'll be diligent for anywhere from a year to 3 years and then will stop for one reason or another. Once I stop, it's hard for me to get back into a routine. I'll exercise for one or two days, then stop for a week! This DVD is so easy, and so short that it's hard to rationalize skipping a day. That said, once I develop the self discipline to workout every day, I get quite bored with this routine and it's time to move on to something more challenging. If you've never done any Tai Chi this is a good introduction. It's also good if you need to unwind after a hectic day. If you are looking for a full-on Tai Chi routine for balance, flexibility and strength, this DVD will disappoint you.",1398211200,5,1394,4.054347826086956

3736163,5,B001OSC4F6,I just love this dvd! As a long time sufferer of severe anxiety it really helps me to manage the anxiety before the anxiety takes over. Scott is very easy to follow and his voice is soothing and calming and the flow sequences on the beaches of Hawaii just make it even better. I especially like the meditations on the beach in the extra features. There's one for am and one for pm and they're great. I really like this dvd and would recommend it to everyone.

Mr Cole may know the whole form but shows little of it and by dissecting it I cannot see how the body gets the full effect that it is supposed to by doing only bits of it.

T'ai Chi is defense training known for its health benefits. It is typically practiced for a variety of other personal reasons: its hard and soft martial art technique, demonstration competitions, and longevity. As a result, a multitude of training forms exist, both traditional and modern, which correspond to those aims. Some of t'ai chi  training forms are especially known for being practiced at what most people categorize as slow movement. So, it's not a straining exercise in the beginner's form. This instructor allows you to move up in his other editions and with each step in the ladder the benefits are great.

The PM workout likelwise is a low impact mix of traditional Tai Chi movements, stretches and meditation designed to ground and relax you.  You aren't geting the Yang Short Form or any of the hardcore Tai Chi instruction. You are getting elements of it designed to enhance the AM or PM daypart.  A good set to have, especially if you suffer joint pain or aren't ready for moderate to high impact exercise but just need to get moving.",1334793600,5,630,4.607142857142857
3736196,5,B001OSC4F6,"this video is wonderful for Parkinson's patients. My husband has PD, & tai chi was recommended for parkinson's patients on online forums and the local physical therapist. Scott Cole does a great job explaining the moves, we had a hard time understanding the Asian instructors, but Scott's video is easy to understand and the moves are great for beginners. It is just an introduction, but there aren't any moves my husband can't do. We would recommend this video.",1334534400,3,462,4.935897435897436
3736197,5,B001OSC4F6,"Scott Cole is a great tai chi teacher. Though he maintains a calm and supportive approach, I didn't find his instruction condescending or touchy-feely. He walks you through every move, and is really good about balancing left and right. (I've seen many fitness instructors who, even on video where they could have done more takes, do a certain move more times on the right than on the left, and that drives me nuts.)

This video has 2 sections, an AM routine and a PM routine, that are each broken down into 3 parts. In the first part, Scott slowly walks you through all the moves you'll be doing, and repeats them a few times each before going on to the next move. In the second part, he narrates the routine as you put all the moves together into one flowing sequence. And in the third part, he goes through it once with no narration, so you can just follow along with the video and start to concentrate on your breathing.

The AM & PM routines can both be done at any time of day, so don't feel limited. Another thing I appreciate is that Scott explains some of the theory behind tai chi, but doesn't go into a whole lot of spiritual stuff. And the best part about this DVD is that each routine (AM & PM) is only about 30 minutes long, so it's easier to fit into your day than some of his other DVDs which can have routines upwards of an hour long.",1323388800,14,1350,4.26953125

3736199,3,B001OSC4F6,Video pretty good for older person. Would prefer background music to coincide with movements. Maybe use a chair to help balance for leg lifts and position changes for beginners. Will try other CD's from Amazon.,1315008000,14,210,5.0285714285714285

-Scott Cole's instruction is crystal clear.
-It's fun.

-Aches and pains either go away or are lessened.
-Nice music.
-Cole is a very good fitness role model.

Cons:

-None. This is a low-priced introductory DVD that succeeds in getting the audience started in Tai-Chi. I look forward to learning more.",1311638400,4,378,5.266666666666667

For a quick wind down before bed this is great.  It doesn't state that this is for beginners and I would have liked more time, and more movements.",1304553600,10,321,4.213114754098361
3736202,5,B001OSC4F6,"I have just started getting back into Tai Chi and this has been a great addition to my collection.  This has inspired me to start to do my work outs twice a day, though I have to admit getting up at 4:30 to do this before work is a little rough some days.  However the hardest thing about this tape is the getting up early before work.  The video is very easy to follow and he does a great job of walking you through it.  I didn't have any problems following anything (though I always watch this type of video once before I do it the very first time) and the music is very relaxing.  I like to do the ""instructional"" part as a warm up just to get everything moving, but some days I do skip to the ""routine"" part of the video.
On a side note, this isn't a ""strict beginner"" video (there is another one for that in this series), but even if you are you shouldn't have much trouble.  My wife who has never done any Tai Chi was able to follow along with out any problems.
Hope you enjoy this as much as I have.",1304467200,6,1006,4.005

This routine is the perfect length... short enough that you won't think twice about doing it and long enough that you can feel invigorated.  It really works... I've been a Reiki Master/Teacher for over a decade and deal with energy ""Chi"" on a daily basis and doing this routine literally made the ""Chi"" come pouring out of my palms.  Very Cool :)  Plus, you can literally see his aura while he is doing the workout (look just past his head and torso...the white light energy field surrounding him).  He is quite profound to watch.

3736208,4,B001OSC4F6,This was my first attempt at tai chi and it had me interested and excited about it from the first steps.  Only flaw is that the narrowness of the routines (only a half-dozen moves in each routine) means I am ready to move on after only a few viewings.

3736212,5,B001OSC4F6,"I am a total beginner to tai chi.  I had tried a few tapes years ago and couldn't make heads or tails of them.  I thought I was just too uncoordinated.  I decided, though, to give this DVD a try based on favorable reviews.
Finally!  Scott Cole is the total package.  He is very easy on the eyes (for us women), has a soft, pleasant voice, a very appealing manner and, best of all, he has created an easy to follow and enjoyable workout for me.  I have only done the PM Workout so far as relaxing is my main goal.  He starts going very slowly through all the moves and explains them thoroughly.  I don't pay attention to right or left, I just watch him and mirror him and I was not confused.  Once he gets you familiar with the workout, he puts it all together in a beautiful beach setting, flowing through all the moves with narration and then repeating the moves for a second time with just music.  A lot of moves emphasized getting joints looser and there were balancing moves - I was shaky on these but this practice should improve my balance and that is one of the purposes of tai chi.  Also, I could feel afterward that my leg muscles had been working.  I think everyone could do the PM Workout and Scott says at times to not judge yourself if you can't do everything precisely.
I previewed the AM Workout and the music and moves are faster and more energetic but either workout can be done at any time of day.  I look forward to giving that one a try but, even if I only use the PM Workout, it is well worth the money for me.",1266710400,42,1531,4.166666666666667
3736213,5,B001OSC4F6,"Good for the beginner.  Doing this workout even just once a day helps improve my low back pain.  It's easy.  You don't break a sweat, but it helps relieve tension.  I will be ordering more of Scott Cole's products.",1263081600,8,214,4.410256410256411
3736214,5,B001OSC4F6,"I purchased this video for several reasons  -- I've read great things about Tai Chi and its health benefits; I was fascinated to watch individuals in China performing it in the mornings and evenings; I suffer from a lot of anxiety and was looking for a way to help relax.  I purchased this particular video because it got better reviews than the others.

The video is very easy to follow and understand.  I watched the slower walkthrough of the PM segment once and then am able to easily follow along with the full beach routine without any problems.  The music is soothing as are the settings.

Cole, the narrator and person featured in the video, throws in some basic explanations about some of the forms -- what they are for and what the theory is behind them.  You won't become a Tai Chi master watching this video -- this barely even scratches the surface.  However, it is very relaxing and goes through several 10 - 15 minute segments that can be beneficial when used on a regular basis.  If you are interested in delving deeply into Tai Chi with a strong foundation of the history and moves, you'll need something beyond this video.  So if you are looking for the relaxation, stretching, and health benefits that you can gain from Tai Chi, this video delivers.",1259280000,122,1267,4.591111111111111
3736215,5,B001OSC4F6,"I did the PM workout first one evening and felt immediately relaxed, centered, and grounded. It is very easy to follow. The viewer can simply 'mirror' the forms, i.e., Cole faces the camera and the viewer moves as though Cole were a mirror image. I tried other videos and DVDs in the past where the instructor would turn all different ways and it was impossible to follow for me. Not here. Very good for a beginner like me. LOVED the PM workout. I was instantly relaxed and that day's stress felt lifted away. Very enjoyable. Anyone who can stand for 30 minutes at a stretch can do this.",1248393600,136,587,4.444444444444445

The movements are well explained & easy to follow.  There's no impact or straining involved, but you feel surprisingly ""worked-out"" afterwards.  What I like best is that my numerous aches & pains magically disappear after this work-out.  It does a great job of loosening up my sore back/neck & stiff joints.",1245024000,107,449,5.0
