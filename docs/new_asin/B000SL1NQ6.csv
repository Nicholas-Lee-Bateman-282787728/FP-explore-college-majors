8205760,5,B000SL1NQ6,"I saw this film the first time in 1973 ,when it was released, and, I guess, like almost everybody else fell for the beautiful Laura Antonelli ,acting her first major role. I found the quality of this DVD quite reasonable, but missed English subtitles. The slapstick and situational humor however are such that, even without understanding Italian (or just a little), it is easy to follow the simple storyline of male lust from young to old. And , of course, Laura Antonelli is a  pleasure to look at. The film dates from that great seventies era of excellent Italian comedies such as Wertmuller's Mimi Metallurgico and  Film d'Amore e d'Anarchia ; Brusati's Pane e Cioccolata and Scola's C'eravamo Tanto Amati as well as Brutti, Sporchi e Cattivi, amongst many others.",1431216000,5,767,4.892307692307693

8205763,5,B000SL1NQ6,"This work was broadcast by television broadcasting of Japan repeatedly.
For young me, it was a very interesting work.
Probably for the reason, the results in the study of a school were not used, either, but he was a poor student.
But if this work is seen even now, it is as wonderful as whether there was any boy who gets such a thing truly.
Did it symbolize the domestic status and riches in which the boy of that time was?
It is the distant world although there may possibly be such a home even now.
This movie is a movie which cannot be forgotten in such a sense.",1399420800,,566,4.201834862385321

8205765,4,B000SL1NQ6,"The quality of the video was excellent.  It would have been better if the subtitles would have been in english, but it was possible to follow the story without them.  I had seen the video in VCR format quite some time ago and the quality of the DVD was much better.",1349308800,7,265,4.176470588235294
