4678749,5,B005FISC52,"I am an avid One Tree Hill watcher. I watched it quite frequent whend it was on t_v, but when it was on tv it was so hard to watch it the times that came on. I've had seasons 1 through 5 for quite some time and needed to get the others. I watched them completely through all seasons, 1 through 9, episode after episode during my free time. I absolutely love this show and it's 1 of the best, if not the best series that I've ever seen. Once I got through this season that I had at home, I needed to get the season that I didn't have. I knew it was going to be hard to find them in a store, or that if I did find them they were going to be more than I wanted to spend. I then  decided to look on Amazon and I found what I needed and I found them at a very reasonable price. I place my order and the items came very very quick. I'm very glad I chose to get them on here rather than having to go to a store, look for the items I needed, and hopefully not spending a fortune. If you're looking to get the last few seasons, you'll definitely be happy with the delivery time and the price.",1420675200,,1083,3.8133333333333335

4678779,4,B005FISC52,Great teenage drama show that grew with the audience. I really enjoyed the ideas behind the series that two brothers who were kept apart start to become close. Watching all the drama behind that and the character development of each main character was great. The series starts out a little on the nave (younger side) but it grows into a pretty powerful show by the end.,1412812800,,369,4.606060606060606

This series presented you with a lot of drama and a lot of unexpected situations.  Season nine is a great way to celebrate the end of the series.  Dan has made it through thick and thin throughout his life on One Tree Hill, to see his life end was different.  It was nice to see that Nathan and Haley came around and let Dan back into their lives.  It is also good to see Brooke get everything that she has ever wanted.  After what she has been through in Season 5 thru 8, she deserves the happy ending.  When Xavier did come back into the picture, I was just waiting to see when he would attack her next.  I like that Brooke had a battle with the other Tree Hill Caf owner.  To see those two come together at the end was a nice touch.  For this ending season, I wish that Lucas and Peyton would have been in the picture more.  I think that would have made the series a perfect ending.  I suggest this series to anyone.  It always keeps you wondering.  It is highly addicting.",1360368000,,1101,4.127358490566038

4679110,5,B005FISC52,"I lived in Wilmington, NC, where One Tree Hill was filmed, and I was fortunate to get an in-depth, behind-the-scenes look at what made the show so special.

First, the production value was tremendous. You have never seen a group of people so meticulous in their craft. Every scene had to have exactly the right lighting, and every nano-nugget of dialogue had to be repeated thousands of times until the nuance was just... perfect, so that when Peyton said ""why hello,"" you knew she meant it, and it struck you on some primal level.

I also overheard some of the discussions in the writers' room. It was phenomenal, like being in a beehive of genius, where every little writer bee would cross-pollinate the ideas of the others, and they would work relentlessly all in the service of the Queen. You. You are the queen. The 12-18-y-o girls who watch One Tree Hill are the queen, the honey to their comb. I've seen some of the writer bees at home with their wives and, seriously, all they can think about is you. It's kind of creepy. (Needless to say, this makes the wives a little fidgety, but they put up with it because they know it's only 9 seasons.)

Just to paint the writers' room for you, one writer bee would say something like, ""How about `oh but Lucas, you are the sun to my stars'?"" and another writer bee would fire back, ""Are you kidding? 12-18-y-o girls don't go for that. They want real dialogue, not cheesy bedtime fairytales. How about `oh but Lucas, you know I won't go for that--I'm a tough, modern gal who can buy her own iPods'?"" and another writer bee would fire back, ""Gal? Really? Is this the 19th Century?"" And so on.

I wish you could have seen the way the crew operated on set. Utter professionals. None of them were blessed with movie star good-looks - most of them had a saggy gut and were balding, and for some odd reason they were almost always carrying a half-peeled Snickers Bar - but you've never seen a group of guys so in tune with the modern young-female psyche. Even during their off hours, you'd find them reading pre-teen fashion blogs, trying to understand you, your essence. Such devotion to craft.

One time - and I think this says it all - I walked in on the ""testing"" room, where they had a small horde of young females stationed in front of a TV and hooked up to galvanic skin response sensors. The crew would present various scenarios on the TV - Chad Michael Murray with a varsity jacket, Chad Michael Murray without a varsity jacket; Rape scene in a basement, Rape scene at the prom - and then they'd scientifically analyze the results from the skin sensors to determine which permutations elicited the highest physiological arousal. The whole point, you see, was to maximize arousal, to make you as lustful or as disturbed as possible. And what really made One Tree Hill unique was the professionalism and dedication, the almost clinical way in which they went about their business. It's why the show will go down in the pantheon of not just the greatest shows ever, but of the greatest artistic productions period. Customer is queen!",1341100800,2,3081,4.574275362318841

Some of them seemed a bit outrageous and only stuck in the script because it was the last season, i.e. Nathan being kid-napped, Mouth gaining weight, Clay's blocked memory and new found son?? Seriously these were a bit much for me. The return of Chris Keller was probably the high point of the season in my opinion. He brought back the comedy for such a dark season. I give the season 4 stars because it's one of my favorite series and it wasn't half bad. The ridiculousness did leave me wanting more. I just wish Lucas and Peyton could have had a full blown return.",1338940800,,698,4.4609375

4679149,5,B005FISC52,"I just finished watching the ninth and final season of One Tree Hill with my family last night.
I am so glad we, the audience, as well as the characters, all got the ending we deserved. There are genuine tears and genuine laughs, and although the show has always had something missing since Lucas and Peyton left, the final season does have several nods in acknowledgement of the emptiness they've left behind, including - Minor Spoiler - a visit from Chad Michael Murray himself in one of the episodes.

The season is in NO WAY a 'We're settling down, life is gonna be good and easy, it's a happy ending' kind of thing. The show uses its final season as a way to go all out and give us a maximum of drama, and remind us of how much we love the characters. The amount of small things that have carried out through the series that make appearances, and surprises that make you jump, proud to remember something related to, or dating back to the first few seasons - and the series as a whole - are very generous, and very heart-warming.

Even if you have stopped watching the TV show, you need to watch the final season. Do it for Haley, Nathan and Brooke AT LEAST. AT LEAST. You definitely will not regret it.

I generally hate reviews and I know this one does absolutely NO justice... but I'll keep it short. Purchase this season. I cannot recommend it enough. I thank God for One Tree Hill. These characters have been there for me during the worst of times, and even my college essay was about the show. It's simply a magical television series.

IN CONCLUSION: In this spectacular final season the acting is top notch, the stories are involving, and the thirteen episodes truly invest and tightly grip the heart of the viewer, in full command of all emotions. Prepare the kleenex and prepare to enjoy yourself on one last adventure with our old friends.

Goodnight, (One) Tree Hill.",1337817600,,1883,4.510263929618769

I havent't watched the whole of this last season yet, however from what I have seen already it is fabulous and I must admit I will be a little sad now that's its finished.  Has never failed yet.  Definitely worth a watch.",1336953600,,367,4.069444444444445
4679215,5,B005FISC52,"Unlike most reviewers, I didn't grow up with OTH...I came to the show about 2 months ago via SoapNet, which aired 3 shows a day.  Then, when I was hooked on the fabulous stories, the acting, and the characters, SoapNet went off the air.  I went into OTH obsession mode, and began watching 4-6 episodes a day after buying the last 3 seasons on Amazon Video on Demand.  I watched them all on my tiny Kindle Fire.  The final season was wonderful and wrapped everything up in a neat little package.  I did wish that Lucas and Peyton made more appearances, but it was still pretty amazing.  OTH was a great little show-now I know what I was missing out on all of those years when others were watching!",1336867200,,696,4.3565891472868215

4679283,5,B005FISC52,"I loved this entire show. Amazon thank you for having it available for cheap. The quality was great. To the reviewer before mine, Amazon did not cut any time out of the show. It is a 2 hour finale on TV(keep in mind this includes commercials). When you remove the commercials, you are left with the 1 hr 22 min show. Also, it says that the finale includes the opening commentary. So you have a final show and commentary. You might want to edit your review and up the stars :)",1335657600,,475,4.230769230769231

4679285,5,B005FISC52,I have been an avid fan of One Tree Hill for the last four years and this final season was the absolute best ever.  Writer Mark S. brilliantly brought each personality and relationship to a close.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the series and watching the characters mature.  I loved Peyton and Lucas but I was not surprised that Nathan and Haley & Brooke and Julian were able to keep the sizzle and series ratings going.  Thanks for an excellent series.,1335225600,,450,4.5875
4679286,5,B005FISC52,"First, I would like to say that I live in the UK where episode 7 of season 9 has just shown. I couldn't wait to watch it on regular tv so I pre-ordered this before it was released. The DVDs arrived this morning...3 weeks before they were due to be arrive. So kudos to Amazon.com for that quick delivery.
Second, I HAVE to say that One Tree Hill is incredible. I first watched the show when it started. I was 11 and not being a teenager didn't connect and stopped watching. However when I turned 16 I started watching again and couldn't believe how much I loved it. Now I'm 18 and have collected the series and still love it.
Congrats to Mark Schwahn, the cast and the crew for creating a tv show that really connects with it's audience, teens and adults.
If you haven't seen this, I recommend that you buy season 1 and I have no doubt that you won't enjoy it. And then you can buy the rest of this truly incredible series :)",1335225600,,924,4.196629213483146

4679288,3,B005FISC52,"I admit that after 8 with weddings,babies, and quite a few near death experiences...season 9 seemed like kind of a let down. Loved the finale but that was about it.
Most of the season revolved around Nathan missing and Haley worrying and blaming Dan.
The return of Chris and Alex leaving..not so crazy about it. Even though I still think Mia was better for him anyways.
Tara was an unnecessary addition. But not so terrible after she tazered Xavier(who btw should never have been brought back in at all).
Lucas not playing an active part in finding Nathan. Peyton not appearing at all(she really should have for Tric's tenth anniversary but well..actors do what they have to do).
The appearance of Logan was unnecessary but he was a lovable addition-so heck, I guess we'll keep him.
Dan's death(Sad but inevitable)
The finale showed great promise but
A)wth we were promised a full two-hour deal right?
B)Not really the old faces you thought would come back(No Alex,No Mia,No Leyton, No Karen,No Erin,No Sam..you get the picture)
But I loved the storytelling technique in the finale as well as the songs used. And the ending and final monologue were awesome.

So, it was rushed and not in typical Tree Hill fashion. End of review.",1334880000,2,1229,4.797169811320755
4679289,5,B005FISC52,"i love one tree hill. I love the twists and turns this season 9. I am sadden they cancel  One Tree Hill for good. I think they rushed this season way to fast it came out on April 10th thats pretty rushed to be honest. I love the cast and the stars on the show. I am going to Miss One Tree Hill. I recommoned u all to buy it if your a big One Tree Hill fan like me and u won;t regret it. its the best deal on Amazon for the price.

Thanks Amazon for being the cheapest place to buy this stuff.",1334707200,,492,3.676190476190476

The sit down with the cast, to do a Q&A after they were done filming the last episodes is great. Also, the commentary during the last episode, with Bethany Joy, Sophia Bush, Mark Schwahn, and Lee Norris is really good. I recommend this for any OTH fan.",1334620800,,386,4.22972972972973

One Tree hill has helped me through the tough times in my life and was always there for me when I needed it the most because it helped me through my parents diviore expecially Nathan and Haley to prove that love still did exist . It helped me through beeing bulllied in school and all my  other problems in life . One Tree hill is something I never forget and miss terribly because One Tree hill changed my life and for the better that for sure . I may only be 19 and 13 when I stared watching but One Tree hill became a way of life for me when I started watching in season 4 . One Tree hill will be missed but never forgotten and One Tree hill has inspired me to become a screenwriter for TV and create my own TV show .This is a must have for the loyal OTH fans to complete the collection.,1333929600,,1023,3.9902439024390244
4679323,3,B005FISC52,"I love that I can always come to Amazon and buy episodes of my favorite shows that I've missed. However, I am sorely disappointed that Amazon describes this as a 2-hour finale and then only gives me 52 minutes. What gives??",1333670400,,223,4.463414634146342
4679324,5,B005FISC52,"""Someday is today, and someday is yesterday."" Two days have passed since this remarkable series has ended its run, and now that I've had time to mull over that sad fact, I've had time to mull over the quote above taken from the final episode. The former reminds me that the show is over and left for us longtime fans to relive on DVD and for the new fans to discover and to enjoy the delight that is One Tree Hill; the latter reminds me of the countless hours of my youth spent watching this show that has ever changed my life. Sounds like I'm exaggerating, right? A television show changing someone's life? Well, that's exactly the impact One Tree Hill had on me.

Many may think that One Tree Hill is some hapless, teen drama that blows normalcy way out of proportion. But the series is so much more than that. Sure, there have been many plots that most of us may never relate to. A psycho posing as my half-brother is probably not in the cards for me, nor is a video exposing my goodies to the entire school very likely to occur in my lifetime. But, it's not about that delicious drama that drew us into this show. It kept us tuned in, but it's not what created a pseudo-connection between the show and the fans. It was the stories and life lessons that were presented for us. It was the stories and lessons about family and love, the stories and lessons about dreams, and the stories and lessons about hope. Because that's what One Tree Hill has always been about.  It's always been about family and love and dreams and hope; it was ""the little show that could,"" after all. And that's what made us fall in love with our favorite North Carolinians. And that's what sets this series apart from other television shows. Yes, there is the typical drama, but there's also a brand of storytelling like no other that's ever present.

Every character is genius, especially my personal favorite Brooke. Without getting into too much gushing, I can say that I've learned a lot from Brooke Davis. I've learned that you can be more than what others have marked you as. You can change, and you can be successful, and you can have hopes and dreams. I can't say that about any other television character. And I praise Sophia Bush for delivering such a stellar and beautiful performance for 9 years. And I thank Mark Schwahn for thinking Peyton needed a best friend.

One Tree Hill will always be special to me. It shaped my adolescence, it defined my music library, and it kept me entertained and hopeful for 9 years. This show has changed lives, and as I said, it's changed mine. That's something reserved for things that are truly remarkable and beautiful. I will miss tuning in on Wednesday nights (or Monday and Tuesday's) to watch these guys combat psycho stalkers and nannies, squabble about love triangles, and gather around the stage at Tric to watch musical acts. But, as Brooke said in the finale, the memories will always be in her heart. And that's where One Tree Hill and the memories it's given me will always be, in my heart. Always and forever.",1333670400,25,3048,4.516304347826087
4679325,5,B005FISC52,"They say, all's well that end's well and after 9 years and 187 episodes the residents of Tree Hill say goodbye. For real, this time. Against all odds, OTH has managed to come back time and again and went from being the ""show on the bubble"" to being the ""little show that could"". I think it's safe to say that we have all been moved to tears more than once during it's nine year run and it's surely kept me on the edge of my seat more times than I care to count.

Now, after a relatively calm season 8 we get to bid our favorite group of North Carolinians farewell with 13 drama packed episodes that will warm and break our hearts all at the same time. With Dan back in the picture, it doesn't seem too much of a coincidence when, at the same time, Nathan goes missing. Is Tree Hill's favorite villain behind his son's disappearance? There's trouble on the horizon for Brooke and Julian as well, as the couple struggle with their new role as parents to their twins and their lives get put in danger when an old acquaintance gets released from prison. And as Clay starts mysteriously wandering off in his sleep, Quinn's worries and suspicions about his nightly whereabout and his well-being begin to mount. And when everything comes to a climax, a shocking secret from a past life is revealed, while some of Tree Hill's residents put their lives at risk in order to save Nathan and bring him home.

Never before has a season of One Tree Hill been this coherent and exciting. I couldn't wait to see how it would all pan out week after week, and before I knew it, it was over. In a way, it makes me sad to see a show which had such a deep impact on my adolescence come to an end. But at the same time, I feel that there couldn't have been a better time or way to say goodbye.

It was truly beautiful to see it all come full circle in what couldn't have been a more perfect finale! We got to see everybody gather around for the 10th anniversary of Tric. We saw old wishes come true and new ones get made. We saw love and laughter, old friends and new opportunities. And we got to take a quick look at what the future holds in store for Brooke, Haley, Nathan and everybody else - and it is pretty damn perfect!

As a long time fan of the show, I have been hoping that an eventual finale would be worthy of its kindness and beauty for years. So instead of being sad, I have decided to be happy to have gotten just that. A worthy ending of a beautiful journey. A journey I am sure as hell gonna relieve on DVD over and over again.

Cheers to our little show that did! #GoodnightOneTreeHill",1333584000,3,2581,4.227180527383367

Seasons 5 and 6 were good too, but then when Lucas and Peyton left the show went into a downward spiral, then picked back up in season 8 and 9. I don't like all the cast changes, the only good cast addition was Austin Nichols(Julian <3). The others were just awful, I'm certainly not a Clay or Alex fan at all!!! I will miss this show greatly but love that I can watch the seasons in the comfort of my own home. Season 9 is  more interesting, wish Luke and Peyton would come back more often thought.(Can't believe Peyton didn't come back for Brooke's wedding!!!!)
