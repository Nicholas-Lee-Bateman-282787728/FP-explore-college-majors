8738179,3,B0176KSVGG,"Since it is available on BluRay I was hoping the picture quality would be a tiny bit better than the old regular dvd. I know there is only so much more quality that can be added when you are dealing with historic footage, but I thought it would be a tiny bit better, but I think the old regular dvd release prior to this version has a sharper image actually. That is why I was disappointed. Also, the extra cd with music is just excerpts, not the entire soundtrack to the video. I was hoping for the entire Paquita music to be on the extra cd b/c I love listening to the music, but it is only an excerpt.",1455494400,5,604,4.084033613445378
