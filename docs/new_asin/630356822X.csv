And now that i own the two series V and V:the final battle and have watched them over and over, it seems to me that the  tv versions had more episodes than what we have in video..the video is a  piece chopped out of the series..To bad they never finished it off really.",921283200,,373,4.082191780821918

681499,4,630356822X,"I enjoyed this follow-up to the original 1983 ""V"" miniseries. The entire cast returns, down to the smallest of characters. That was really impressive and unexpected. The stakes seem higher in ""V: The Final Battle"", and the Visitors seem more ruthless than ever before, but thankfully our rebel heroes have also grown more skilled and experienced over time. Without delving into spoilers, I thought everything except the last 5 minutes was great. The Starchild plot ended in a HIGHLY ridiculous way. Still, that wasn't enough to ruin my experience. 4 stars!",1505692800,,556,5.1208791208791204

681755,5,630356822X,"This gem of  series came out in the early 80's but that doesn't detract from how great this show was for that time period.
It is a story about the human spirit and surviving under a terrible threat, this set is the finale of the movie min-series then continues in the T.V. series which is about 20 episodes long, its special effects are good for that time period and the story and acting for most part is better than the 2000's remake which could have been called anything else and would have been all right. the remake just had better effects but they lost the great story line and destroyed what the series was about. I believe they even made a Comic book series off this series, I could be wrong though.

So I highly recommend the entire series from beginning to end is worth the watching. I also recommend Alien Nation movie, Alien Nation T.V. series and Alien Nation T.V. movies",1462320000,,883,4.444444444444445

682014,5,630356822X,"V...the sign used by the humans to claim Victory over the now hostile aliens that have taken refuge over cities across the Globe. In the Miniseries, we saw the ""Visitors"" arrive as if they were benevolent beings from another planet here to help the humans with pollution, disease and other ailments. It was only discovered after investigating by a few scientists and rebels that they indeed were not here to help, but to rape and pillage the planet. This series, a sequel, if you will, to the original miniseries finds our ""heroes"" taking on Diana, the leader of one of the ships over Los Angeles and her alien crews. They enlist the help of a veteran ""rebel"" (Michael Ironside) and his crew to finally dismantle the alien network over the city. The team, consisting of a scientist (Faye Grant) discovers a toxic dust, known as the ""Red Dust"" that could rid planet Earth of the hostile Aliens once and for all.

I was a Senior in High School when this came out and I was hooked from first episode. A good science fiction series and recommended!!
(This series came out before Robert Englund would go on to star in the popular ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies.)

Jane Badler's charactor Diana smolders on screen with high camp sexuality and bitchy one liners. Although this looks completely outdated compared to todays green screen special effects. Diana's power lust ambition is hilarious. Sadly the series loses its pace as it goes on. This no doubt is a direct result of Kenneth Johnson leaving after the first series and as it was his concept in the first place, the continuing series loses it's impact after his departure from the show.

There are subsequent TV mini-series that came after, but these two mentioned DVD sets are the culture phenomenon that is known by fans as ""V"" and still has a following of faithful viewers even three decades later.
This set has 2 DVD's, one DVD has an episode on each side, the other DVD in the ""VTFB"" set has only one episode (if you put it in your player upside down, nothing will load).  This DVD set offers subtitles in English, Franois, Espa&ntilde;ola, Portuguese, Chinese, Bahasa, Thai, & Korean.  The first set has two episodes on alternate sides of one DVD, and this ""Final Battle"" set only uses three of the four available sides.
Of course the ""V"" original series DVD sets (3 ttl DVD's, 5 ttl episodes) leave the story open ended, but without spoiling the entire viewing experience here, I'll just say, that is how nearly ALL of the Sci-Fi genre stuff is released these days.
Interesting how many familiar faces are in this, since it is almost thirty years in the past.  The ""V"" original series production (all 5 episodes) is pretty tame by today's standard, but was at first considered ""too cerebral"" by regular broadcasting TV studios.  Still, it became a culture icon and is referred to in several subsequent films, literature, prime time TV shows, and small talk around the water cooler in today's workplace.",1337904000,2,1520,4.656716417910448

682490,5,630356822X,"Okay, yes. The original mini-series is sacred; it was brilliant. But Final Battle, though the writing and depth was not quite as refined as that of the original, was undeniably entertaining. Firstly, we get a continuation of Willie's (Englund) story, which, I admit, was the initial reason I started by now expansive V collection. The secondary story involving him and his girlfriend, Harmony, was endearing and a nice break from the other dramas and action-packed sequences.
Then we meet Ham Tyler, who looks and acts like the bastard child of Jack Nicholson and Hugo Weaving. I was completely in awe of this guy, and he was almost instantly by second favourite character, only a hairs-breadth below Willie.
As far as Sci-Fi goes, it's a great, entertaining series that I recommend with a passion. It's among the greats, like the first three Star Trek series, the original Dr. Who's, Space:1999, and the like.

Definitely check this series out, it's a must have for any Sci-Fi fan!",1306368000,2,982,4.951515151515151

At the time, I was too young to fully appreciate the meaning of it, but when it was put into syndication, I watched ""V The Original Miniseries"" and ""V The Final Battle"" over an entire week. I grew to appreciate both more and more. While Kenneth Johnson did not participate in ""The Final Battle"" the deep, intricate, and detailed characters were seemlessly weaved into the miniseries. The ""V"" miniseries was unusual because it has an unusually large cast of characters with speaking parts and important roles. You couldn't help but empathize with the ""Fifth Column"" and Julie and Donovan. Even though Johnson wasn't involved, ""The Final Battle"" held your attention and the climax was simply brilliant, along (in my opinion) with Dennis McCarthy's music simply captured the joy, even if the character of Elizabeth (""the Star Child"") was a bit of a Deus ex Machina. 9/10 Stars.",1299974400,,980,4.874251497005988

But to put it in perspective look at Superman: The Movie. Any scene where he was flying around was 2nd rate at best. And we're talking a major motion picture with a much larger budget.

Loved Marc Singer in both mini-series. Not sure why they had him go all David Hasselhoff in many of the scenes. Perhaps it was just to attract female fans. So I have no problem with that. Just thought it was amusing.

As for the ending. It too suffered because of budget cuts. Some genius at NBC should have shelled out a few more bucks, especially considering the show's high ratings.

The first one was predictable and slow, where this was filled with plot twists and action. I ecspecially like the twist with Julie played by Faye Grant. She was by far the bright spot in the series, as she portrayed the pressure of command with great realism. The miniseries is longer that the first set, but never becomes dull like the original was at times. I finished this series in one sitting at 1 am, because I could not hit the stop button. It reminds me alot of Red Dawn in the way that the resistance attacks the visitors. It starts out small and grows throughout the series. I do wish they would have included the distress signal from the original, but I guess they threw that plot line away. The special effects are not as good as the original, I guess that NBC didn't put as much money into this one. It doesn't hurt the series, but is noticably worse than the first. All the twists lead to a great ending that does conclude many of the plotlines. I don't know what the plotline is exactly for the regular series, but not much is left in the air at the end.

Although I was a high school student during that time, I never watched the show during its first release.  However, when my husband and I recently began following the V remake on network TV, he started reminiscing about the original show, so I purchased these DVD sets for him as a Christmas gift.

The Resistance is now in full swing, led by Mike (Marc Singer) and Julie (Faye Grant).  In the second episode, they are joined by Tyler (Michael Ironside), Mike's former nemesis whom he must now trust.  Together they believe that they might be able to find a weakness in the Visitors and possibly plan an attack that will save the Earth.  While this is going on, there is also plenty of action amongst the Visitors themselves, with political intrigue and dissent amongst the ranks (something, incidentally, that is completely missing from the remake).

Given that this movie was made in the mid-80s and is now 25 years old, a bit of cheesiness is to be expected.  However, I thought that the acting was weaker and the plot thinner than in the debut miniseries.

682606,5,630356822X,"The sequel to Kenneth Johnson's original V is a hugely under-rated epic. For whatever reason, there's the belief that the Nazi allegories aren't present in the sequel.

Nonsense, I say.

The Nazi allegory is still there, but whereas the first film was an allegory of the Nazi regime's rise to power, THE FINAL BATTLE  is an allegory of the same during its height.  In this ""V"" the visitors are at a point where they have effectively nuetrelized any effective opposition, and the humans have a choice: join the resistance and risk death, or postpone the inevitable by playing along with their charade.

The alien forces are much more brazen in this film, as the Nazis were at the height of their reign.

Members of the scientific and medical community continue to be a parallel to the Jews in Nazi Germany.  One powerful scene involves a 'visitor youth corps' member demanding that a med student kneel down and lick his boots while an armed guard shouts ""Do as you're told!""

This is done very brazenly in a public setting in broad daylight, with no concern as to who is watching. Such scenes serve to remind us that the planet earth is now the Visitor's turf, thereby creating a real sense of terror.

682648,1,630356822X,"It doesn't seem so long ago that when movies on VHS were cropped on the left and right to fit 4:3 screens, people were indignant over losing a third or more of the original image. Producers responded with letterbox format, which then consisted of adding black bars at the top and bottom to preserve the entire original image.

Now for DVD release, older TV shows are cropped at the top and bottom so the original 4:3 image will fit 16:9 screens. Sometimes they now call this letterboxing! Where is the indignation? Why are there so many five-star ratings on Amazon for the V miniseries without mention of how the image was mutilated?

In fact when the first season of Route 66 was released with the top and bottom cropped, there was much indignation, and the producers responded by re-releasing the season in its original format.

682652,3,630356822X,"In ""V: The Miniseries"" we see a band of unlikely brothers forge together to stop an indestructible group of aliens determined to rid the world of water and subsequently transform the human race into a combo meal at McDonald's.  The aliens eat fuzzy creatures, they like to copulate with humans, and their voices cannot be trusted, yet this group of rebels continues forward.  Half homage to past science fiction films, and half an allegory of the events surrounding WWII, ""V: The Miniseries"" wasn't perfect, but it provided hours of nostalgic entertainment.  Now, with ""V: The Final Battle"", the gloves are thrown off, the symbolic references are destroyed, and the game is transformed into merely a battle between human and alien.  It is about resistance, standing up for beliefs, and plenty of fictitious science all rolled into three hours.  Our band of outsiders is down, but not finished.  They deliver several swift blows to the alien objective and finally one ""final battle"" that leaves doors unopened and plot holes uncovered.  ""V: The Final Battle"" was a swift ending, but where it built onto action, it lacked that panache that the original episodes did.  ""The Final Battle"" assumed that characters were already developed, and instead of taking a humanistic direction, director Richard Heffron placed his bets on the special effects.  This was a completely different ending to a decently sharp beginning.

Heffron isn't Kenneth Johnson, and it is obvious that this is a second part to an idea, not a continuation.  Not only have the overall themes changed, but the influx of special effects has lead us down the path of horrid dialogue, randomly placed action scenes (i.e. the fistfight over the powder), and the lack of developed storylines.  Johnson may have taken longer to get to the point, but at least there was a point.  Heffron went in a completely, some may say bold, direction - but it didn't work.  Investing over five hours, one could easily demand a conclusion, but none could be found here.  The introduction of Elizabeth (the child of an alien and human) was exciting, but nothing happened.  The idea of quick growth was introduced, but then easily forgotten - same as Mike's son being changed as a spy.  Again, another strong and vexing idea that was mentioned, and then forgotten.  It was these smaller nuances that seemed to be clearer in ""The Final Battle"" than in the original.

In addition to the lackluster plot, the acting seemed to be progressively getting worse.  Our original characters were not the same as in this final set - the excitement seemed to have dissipated and with too many small story arch's never being fully developed, it was no wonder our characters seemed to be lacking that pioneering gumption.  Marc Singer's Mike was more a meathead than a leader, the annoying child who gave birth to the spawn seemed more annoying than helpful - and Ham seemed to be unreasonably angrier.  This wasn't the same set we stopped with on the miniseries.  The resistance was going to win; it was inevitable, so why did it have to be so mismatched to get there.

What was kept?  What worked?  It was somewhat like that feeling of seeing ""Star Wars"" for the first time.  When the villains finally get it, one cannot help but feel that moment of excitement swell in the throat, but there needed to be more.  The alien baby is worth the price of the DVD alone, a cross between originality and a ""Ghoulie"", it provided at least an hour of laughter.  The fist fight between Ham and Mike seemed reminiscent of the film ""They Live"", so it received some points for that, but overall it just felt cheap.  The sets were bigger, the acting was weaker, and the money was tighter.  While you should watch this after ""The Miniseries"", don't expect the same quality.

V - The Final Battle picks up where V left off. The resistance are still fighting the Visitors, and they finally uncover just exactly what it is that the Visitors are here for.

While it is a great sequel(no doubt about that), it is pretty evident that Kenneth Johnson left in its' early stages as the sequel isn't quite as strong storywise as the first.

To call the last 15 minutes ""sci-fi"" is a stretch, ""just plain dumb"" would be a more apt description.

OTHERWISE, the other 5 1/2 hours are fast-paced and entertaining, although the plot is rather like swiss-cheese, with LOTS of holes and continuity gaps!

Still, given the era and the made-for-TV format, it's still a nice trip back in time to the good old days before the now oft misused and abused CGI of today.  I can't count the number of newer movies that suffer from what I like to call ""video-game syndrome"".  ""Laws of physics??? Never heard of 'em!,"" said the director.

682704,5,630356822X,"Following the huge success of the miniseries V, NBC followed up a year later with the sequel to the saga, V: THE FINAL BATTLE.  V: THE FINAL BATTLE begins not long after where V ended.  Even after their successful attacks by resistance fighters, the Visitors are still in control of Earth and most of the world's population still believes the Big Lie: that the Visitors are here for purely peaceful purposes.  In reality, the Visitors are giant reptiles who have come to drain the Earth of water and take away humans as food.  The Resistance in L.A. has had the most success of any around the globe, but after a failed attack on a food processing plant, the group realizes they must go for a much larger mission.

Led by Mike Donovan (Marc Singer) and Julie Parish (Faye Grant) and assisted with the covert Fifth Column (Visitors who truly want peace) the L.A. Resistance hatches a plan to literally unmask the Visitors to the whole world.  Other important events in the mini-series include the introduction of Ham Tyler (Michael Ironside), a former special operations operative that joins the Resistance and gives them the discipline, training, and weapons they need to become a major player in the fight for freedom; Robin has her baby, but ""it"" turns out to be twins; Julie is captured; and Mike's son, Sean is released from containment and returned to Earth.

I remember watching V: THE FINAL BATTLE when I was a kid. It was an amazing mini-series that captured my imagination.  There are certain parts that I didn't quite understand as a kid (for instance, why is it that Robin's daughter, Elizabeth, has magical powers?) that still don't make sense today.  Also, some of the effects that I was so impressed with as a youngster, such as the birth of Robin's twins (I had nightmares of that baby for weeks), seem downright cheesy and laughable now.  However, overall V: THE FINAL BATTLE still holds up rather well as a piece of great science-fiction.  There have been many technological advances since the series first aired, e.g. the Internet and cell phones, but despite that the allegorical components of the story (how would the U.S. turn from a democratic republic into a fascist state) hold up just as well today as they did in the early 1980s.

I loved the tense moments with the ""Fifth Column"" and Martin.  I liked the operations the resistance ran with the medical center stuff to the water factory to the final assault on the mother ship.

Series creator Kenneth Johnson left midway through the development, and I would love to read his original script (Ham Tyler was in a wheelchair in his original version, and the ending was much different).

Missing from ""The Final Battle"" is the entire anti-scientist sub-plot of the original mini-series.  It has more action than the original, but also less depth.  It's less of an alegory for Nazi Germany/facism, and more of a straight-forward action piece.

Michael Ironside's ""Ham Tyler"" character is a standout, but the mini-series ending is ridiculous.  A real ""Deus Ex Machina"".

682776,4,630356822X,"Overall, the original series was more consistant in quality (5/5 stars), but this films surpasses the original in one crucial area: suspense (not to be confused with 'action', which recalls images of kung-fu matches, but anyway...)

  The 1st episode of this mini-series (3rd overall), starts off with an awkward attack on a 'processing plant', but escalates in drama and tragedy as the resistance prepares for one of the most exciting sequences I've ever seen--TV or film. The 'exposure' of John is jump-off-your-couch excitement, and ends with the nail-biting capture of the beautiful Juliette Parish.

  The 2nd Episode introduces possibly the most charismatic figure of the series: Ham Tyler. I'm still astounded at the depth of the sub-plot involving the ex-cop Mark's (name?) desire to impress Tyler, so much so that it seems he's more concerned with appearing macho than living (see his final scene).

  Daniel's final scene with Ruby still sends shivers up my spine, but after this, the series takes a turn for the worse. Two major things happen that really don't work:

  First, the twin babies. The lizard baby is rediculous for obvious reasons. The design of the puppet is not only primitive, it DOES NOT resemble the established look of the Visitors in any way!! Where did those outlandish teeth come from? A 'less is more' approach to filming the puppet would've improved his scenes. The human twin is equally silly. She's given the 'sitcom baby' treatment, aged to 10 years old in a few weeks, all so she can provide the disgusting 'deuz ex machina' at the mini-series' end that almost wrecks the whole story.

  The 2nd thing that doesn't work, which I don't think anyone has mentioned: the sub-plot of Lydia/Diana/Stephen. I think the less we see of the Visitors on their ship, the better. This keeps their mystique intact, and keeps our eyes diverted from their obvously low-budget sci-fi sets.

  In addition, this sub-plot distracts from the main plot of the resistance, because it 'humanizes' the Visitors to the point that we start to care about them too much (especially John). There's nothing wrong with adding dimension to the 'bad guys), but never at the expense of the main characters.

  I don't really care about Lydia, and I don't really know what she added to the plot. More time should've been spent with Julie, Robert and the others. The focus of the show is THEIR reaction to the Facist threat, not the melodrama of the Facists themselves.

682777,3,630356822X,"We all know the story, so I won't go too much into that.

V: The Final Battle was a pale shadow of the original two-part miniseries (which was really, really awesome).  The writing was awful, the plot lame, and bringing in Dennis McCarthy to contribute his cheesy MacGyver-esque military marching-band action tunes was sad.

But everyone has seen TFB and can decide for themselves.  What I'd like to contribute here are some critiques of the DVDs themselves:

1.  The biggest flaw, and the primary reason I'm writing this: the DVD is letterboxed.  One reviewer wrote: ""The DVD provides a crystal clear, widescreen picture...""  Yeah, and how do you think they got a widescreen picture out of a 4:3 TV show?  Yeah, you guessed it - they painted 25% of the picture black and voil! - a widescreen picture.  What it means in reality, though, is that much of the imagery is too crowded, too tight.  Half the time peoples' chins and hair-styles (and those could be BIG in the 80s) are cut out of the picture.  I've looked over all of the reviews here, and no one else seems to have any complaints about it.

What it means is that this is not going to do as my collector's item.  I'm going to need the full frame one day.  Funny, the orignal miniseries discs didn't seem to have this problem.  Yes, they were 'widescreen,' but nothing seemed to be blacked out - everything fit.

2. The sound is mono.  Yes, I know it was originally aired in mono, but Kenneth Johnson took the time to re-mix the audio for the original miniseries, to add something to that great disc.

3. No extras.  Again, great care was taken in providing some extras for the ultimate fans out there, in the original miniseries.  The Final Battle comes with nothing.  Well, maybe something - there is a menu item, ""Cast and Crew,"" which gives you nothing but a list of actors.  I could have just watched the credits.

All in all, the disc is not of great quality - file under ""Could Have Done Better,"" or, ""Awaiting a Better Version.""",1102723200,15,1994,4.5210084033613445
682778,5,630356822X,"It is about time that they FINALLY came out with the V Series.

I was about 11 or 12 at the time that they had a miniseries called V that rocked the pants off of NBC executives.  Then they brought out V: The Final Battle.

Then they came out with a TV series called V.

The problem is that what you could do with a mini series was harder and more expensive to do with a WEEKLY TV Series.

Therefore, main characters were written off in unexplained plots.

NBC moved the series around so much that when the TV Series Finale came about a lot of NBC affiliates didn't even air it.

Since many others have uber-analyzed everything about this release already, here are some random thoughts from my left parietal lobe.  The Visitors don't shoot any straighter than they did in the first mini-series.  Clearly they need better weapons, training and glasses.  Even the humans are real dullshooters, except for the last 30 minutes of the film, when everyone morphs into a deadeye.  It's funny watching grandma spraying lizards (the air, the ground, adjacent buildings) with M16 fire.  However, someone should take that .38 revolver away from Eleanor.  The scene where she unloads on her son - and misses six times point-blank - is ROTFLMAO hilarious.  Speaking of Donovan, what's with the pose-striking every time he shoots his Visitor pistol?  What's with the free hand, buddy?  Robin was cute and sexy, in a girl-next-door kinda way, in the first miniseries, but is nothing but a teary, whiny mound of jello in this one.  geez, just SHUT UP already.  I wanted someone to shoot her almost as much as I wanted to see Daniel, the human ""Friends of the Visitors"" suck-up take a few teflon tips center-mass.  It was great when Steven, the bumbling always-at-Eleanor's house security guy sent Daniel to the meat locker.  The writer and director really rammed the parallels to the holocaust down the viewer's throats throughout.  Best one liner in the mini-series: ""Damn them!"", when Diana learns that humans just toxified the world from their hot air balloons.  Also like how she ran away after the assaniation attempt on her life (after her one bodyguard bought the farm).  Funny to watch people hauling around clear trash bags full of a deadly biological weapon.  Lastly, the visitors must live under different laws of physics that we do.  Their lasers are the slowest-moving beams of light that I've ever seen.  I could spit faster than that.  Musically, if you closed your eyes, you'd think that you were watching ""Dallas"" with laser blasts.

682820,5,630356822X,"Anyone who has seen ""V"" will want to see this sequel, as well. ""V"" was one of most original made-for-television movie of its time. It spawned this sequel and its very own television series. It was able to do this with a cast of virtual unknowns because of the strength of its story line. ""V"" is simply great sci-fi, and  ""V - The Final Battle"" is a must have DVD for all those fans who enjoyed the original mini-series.
As those of you familiar with ""V"" already know, human looking alien visitors landed on Earth, led by an alien innocuously called John (Richard Herd), who gave Earth a benevolent message that fooled many into thinking that the visitors came in peace. Some humans even ended up working collaboratively with them. There were some, however, that were skeptical of the visitors' motives, and mistrust turned to fear when scientists and doctors began to be rounded up and mysteriously disappeared.
Mike Donovan (Marc Singer), a hunky cameraman, had his own misgivings about the aliens, but once he observed the visitors literally shedding their skins, revealing that that they were not human at all, but rather, nothing more than reptilian looking aliens, his misgivings were reinforced. Mike also discovered that they meant mankind harm and were hell-bent of the conquest of Earth and divestiture of one of Earth's most important natural resources without which humans cannot live.
Mike joined the resistance, headed by beautiful medical doctor, Julie Parish (Faye Grant). As the underground resistance battled the visitors, many humans were still convinced that the visitors were benevolent and  being misjudged by these so-called freedom fighters. As fascist rule supplanted democratic government throughout the world, under the pretext of law and order and at the direction of the visitors and at the behest of their human puppets, the viewer cannot help but be aware of the allegorical implications.
This two disc DVD provides three episodic treats. The resistance continues its struggle against the visitors with the assistance of an alien fifth column, working secretly together, side by side.  Mike Donovan and Julie Parish are now joined by irascible and laconic Ham Tyler (Michael Ironside), a former special forces agent with a chip on his shoulder and the military strategy necessary to coalesce the resistance movement into a lean, mean, fighting machine.
This sequel mini-series is action packed, as the visitors and the resistance fighters duke it out for control over the Earth. The exquisitely beautiful, evil alien, Diana (Jane Badler), stops at nothing to secure her ambitions. Not content with being the science officer for the invading forces, she seeks military glory at all cost. She is the one from whom both humans and aliens have much to fear.
The allegorical thread also continues, as humans begin to be rounded up routinely and trucked off to a processing plant. After all, it is the visitors fervent desire to serve man...literally. It seems that in addition to the Earth's water, the visitors are secretly looking to humans as a food source.
There are some interesting special effects for its time, as well as some cheesy ones. There are also some key performances. Most notable are those of Jane Badler, in the role of the diabolical Diana, and Michael Ironside, as Ham Tyler, the alien hating resistance fighter. Look also for  Robert Englund, who would go on to  Freddy Kreuger fame the same year as the release of this mini-series sequel. He continues in the role of Willie, a peaceful loving visitor who allies himself with the resistance.
This film has everything, suspense, action, thrills, a gripping story line, a moral message, and an inter-species birth. How can anyone resist? This is sci-fi as it should be. Bravo!
The DVD provides a crystal clear, widescreen picture and perfect audio, but little else. It provides none of the interesting extras found on the ""V"" DVD. Instead, the buyer will have to be satisfied with the usual interactive menus, as well as scene access, and subtitles available in English, French.  Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Bahasa, Thai, and Korean. All in all, notwithstanding its shortcomings, this is a DVD well worth having in one's collection, if one is a sci-fi diehard.
It is unfortunate that the television series based upon this highly successful mini-series did not fare well.  The knuckleheads in charge of programming sentenced it to death right from the beginning by scheduling it opposite the then number one television show, ""Dallas"".  The series never even had a chance coming out of the gate. I  only hope that a DVD collection of the series will be forthcoming.",1062547200,87,4660,5.057291666666667

682823,3,630356822X,"1984's 3-part miniseries ""V: The Final Battle"" more or less picks up where Kenneth Johnson's imaginative ""V"" left off.  As with all network-mandated sequels, this installment is a far weaker story and lacks the ""you are there"" realism of the original.  Johnson's absence from the project is the single greatest loss.  The first miniseries was a brilliant homage to freedom fighters throughout history. Unfortunately the sequel has lost sight of its own origins: the allegories to the rise of Nazi fascism are only briefly touched upon in throwaway lines in part 1, and are completely abandoned by part 3.  By then, even though the element of a Visitor ""ultimate weapon"" is injected into the plot, the story has become less about saving humanity than it is about a grudge match between Diana and Mike Donovan.  A clue to the weaker storyline might be in the opening credits: this installment lists seven different writers!
To synopsize: several months have now passed since the conclusion of the original series, and the Visitors are now firmly in control of human society, rounding up humans under various pretexts for ""processing"" into food shipments to the mother ships.  The underground resistance hasn't had much success opposing them --far from the triumphant ending of the last chapter, the L.A.-based rebels are being rebuffed at almost every turn by superior alien firepower and body armor.  The resistance comes up with a daring plan to ""expose"" John on international television.  Most of Part 1 revolves around the staging of this plan, which is carried off brilliantly but ends with Julie's capture.  In Part 2 the Visitors discover resistance headquarters and stage a counterattack, but the rebels are able to flee thanks to the timely help of an old adversary of Donovan's.  Julie is rescued, but she has been through the conversion process and the resistance is wary.  Part 3 revolves around the birth of Robin's alien babies and an unexpected dividend from that birth.
The strongest element to this sequel is the return of virtually the entire original cast, further developing the wide array of characters that have been thrown together by extraordinary circumstance.  Besides Donovan (Marc Singer), Julie Parrish (Faye Grant), the Maxwells (Michael Durrell, Blair Tefkin, Viveka Davis, Marin May), Elias Taylor (Michael Wright), Sancho (Rafael Campos), Willie (Robert Englund), and Harmony (Diane Civita), a few new faces have joined the resistance, my favorites being ex-CIA operative Ham Tyler (Michael Ironside) and demolitions expert Chris Faber (Mickey Jones).  Tyler and Faber are supposed to represent the ""world network;"" reminding the viewer that the goings-on in L.A. are not the center of the universe.  Tyler is especially compelling to watch; he has a cold, take-no-prisoners exterior that puts him at odds with Donovan the boy scout, although we do get a brief glimpse of his surprisingly affectionate side later on in the second chapter.  Most of ""V's"" original villains are back as well, including fleet commander John (Richard Herd), collaborator Daniel Bernstein (David Packer), and of course the vengeful Diana (Jane Badler).  Also back in a greatly expanded role is alien ""Fifth Columnist"" Martin (Frank Ashmore).
Aside from superior character development (proof that a truly gifted actor really can make something out of any script), ""The Final Battle"" just has too many flaws.  There is little emphasis on allegory and too much emphasis on chase scenes, makeup effects, and laser battles.  The resolution of many of the story arcs from the first chapter are the saving grace of this miniseries, but enjoyment of it really requires the viewer's familiarity with the original.  Replacement director Richard T. Heffron has done a heroic job of salvaging Kenneth Johnson's ideas, but in the end it just doesn't measure up.  The greatest disappointment is in the final hour of the story --the much-hyped ""Final Battle"" comes down to a tired old shootout with a handful of troops in the corridors of the mothership.  Plotwise, the sudden addition of a brand new character in the final segment is an outright cop-out, and the final scenes --including the way-too-upbeat soundtrack-- are among the cheesiest moments in the entire series.
If you absolutely must know ""what happened next"" to the cast of the original ""V,"" then go ahead and obtain ""The Final Battle.""  But if you're expecting a second helping of allegorical brilliance, prepare to be disappointed.",1044921600,27,4492,5.183955739972338

Of all the actors, both in the Original Miniseries and The Final Battle, I have to save my highest praise for Blair Tefkin, who was suddenly thrust into the role of Robin Maxwell when her predecessor, Dominique Dunne, was strangled to death by an ex-boyfriend outside the home of David Packer (Daniel Bernstein) only a short time after filming had commenced.  Ms. Tefkin played the part of Robin very well, going from a teenager whose only concerns were boys and school to a young woman who finds herself in the midst of a battle for the very survival of the human race.  Not only that, Robin also learns to her initial horror that she is with child, the result of a crossbreeding experiment authorized by Diana and carried out by Brian, the young Visitor she developed a crush on when he first came down from the LA Mothership (and who also ends up being the target of her revenge).
While I was disappointed that the DVDs had no extras apart from cast and crew listings, and I wasn't too happy with the treatment of Robin's half-human, half-Visitor daughter, Elizabeth, in the script, I gave this DVD a high rating because the story has been one of my favorites since high school.  Along with its predecessor V: The Original Miniseries, I feel that this one is definitely a keeper.",1032739200,,2399,4.7272727272727275
682857,4,630356822X,"I saw V when it first aired.  It was a long wait between the first mini-series and this one, especially for a kid.  I, personally, have always liked ""The Final Battle"" better simply because there is more Diana!  She's so wicked.  I love her!  Faye Grant's ""Julie"" is also given some great lines and plot-lines in this second one.  You see how she has really grown from the frightened, inexperienced med student in the first mini-series to the confident and gifted resistance leader in TFB.  Marc Singer's Mike Donovan is as arrogant as ever, but there was a nice chemistry between he and Julie.  The most positive casting addition in this second series is Michael Ironside as Ham Tyler.  His sarcasm and bad taste are an excellent antidote to Donovan's heroism. Not that I don't like Mike, Ham just adds a bit of much needed salt.  ;)
As far as the special effects go, you have to remember that this series was made nearly 20 years ago on a television budget.  We have been ""Lucas-a-fied"" since then.  So don't expect ""The Phantom Menace"" or ""Attack of the Clones"".  That kind of technology was not available in 1985.  I still love this series as much as I did the first time I saw it.  The characters are captivating.  The resistance fighters are easy to care for because they are written very believably.  They fight amongst themselves, make huge mistakes, and learn in the process.  There is someone in this group that everyone can relate to.  Diana, Steven, and the despicable Brian are back and badder than ever!  There's also excellent ""girl fight tonight"" chemistry between Diana and Pamela, Diana's superior.  Worrisome Martin and lovable Willie return as well.  Yes, Freddy Krueger CAN be nice!
 I really can't believe they didn't put extras on this DVD.  Behind the scenes, interviews with the cast, even as someone else mentioned the commercials that aired at the time.

I admit, nostalgia colored V and V:The Final Battle all sorts of wonderful colors in my mind, but I'm sad to say that The Final Battle doesnt quite stand the test of time.  There is a serious drop in writing quality in THe Final Battle when comparing it to the Original Series.  All of the timeless themes have been watered down until V: The Final Battle resembles a soap opera more than an Outstanding Piece of Science Fiction.  The action is Saturday Morning Serial-like and the major plot points feel contrived at times. After all these years, V: The Original Miniseries still hit home with the themes of Loss, Love, and Rebirth associated with people going to war.  These themes are traded  for Action and 'Dallas' style Drama in V: The Final Battle.  Without the depth of the themes portrayed in V, this Set just resembles a tired 80's mini series.",1030492800,4,979,4.630057803468208

The story of mankind uniting and fighting back against an intergalatic menace is still an appealing storyline and a welcome addition to my dvd collection.  Though you will notice (after seeing movies such as Attack of the Clones, for example) that the special effects are a bit cheesy, it is the story that pulls you in and delivers a good sci-fi treat.  The reason I didn't give this dvd 5 stars is that it has no extras.  I was hoping to see some TV commercials, maybe some commentaries by the director and actors, deleted scenes---any of these would have been welcome.  That being said, if you were a fan of this 80's hit or if you are a sci-fi fan, you'll enjoy this dvd.  I have to add that Jane Badler is an excellent villain.

I would have much rather have had the whole movie crammed onto two one sided disks and have episode two cut in the middle than to have it the way it was designed.

682863,5,630356822X,"When I was growing up, there were a few video possessions I had that were absolutely vital for me to keep around and watch religiously. Among them was a set of three tapes from the original airings of ""V"" and ""V: The Final Battle"" (which I cannot clearly remember originally watching, being only about 2 years old at the time they originally aired).
Of course, these being tapes, as time went on and I continually watched them, they slowly degraded. Eventually one of my tapes gave out, killing the usefulness of the entire set. I have been meaning for years to rerecord the entirety of ""V"" and ""V: The Final Battle"" when they showed, sometimes on UPN and sometimes on Sci-Fi, but I never was able to get around to it, so I would have to settle for watching it live on television.
Now I finally have a replacement for my holy relic VHS tapes. I get to get reacquainted with all these old friends, even with good old Diana. I get to remember the nightmares that little green baby gave me when I was a child.
Ah, how I missed this.",1029196800,,1029,4.364583333333333
682884,3,630356822X,"I remember this TV event well. It was big news in the spring of 1984. This mini-series aired over 3 separate nights. I found the characters to be well developed and the story held my attention. I saw this mini-series before the first mini-series and was able to pick up the story and follow it without feeling as though I were missing key parts to the story. My only complaint is similar to the other reviewers and that is that the final scene which involves the resistance and the human-alien offspring Elizabeth trying to avert a self destruction sequence on the mother ship. I, and my friends, found the ending to be a bit simplistic and somewhat anti climatic. However don't let this or other reviewers prevent you from watching this mini-series. It is an excellent story. It is almost as good as ""V"" and much better than V: THE SERIES. In my opinion the story should have ended here. V: THE SERIES never lived up to the two mini series and damaged the storyline.
I deducted 1 star from my rating due the ending of the mini-series for reason I mentioned above.  I deducted another star due to the poorly developed DVD.  I did like the case the DVD came in.  It is much better than the standard WB casing of DVD's.  Howerver, the producers could have included a commentary or at least some behind the scenes footage as they did for ""V"".  Also, neither this DVD or the DVD for ""V"" included trailers or commercials that were used to promote these mini-series.  I get the impression that the bigshots at WB throught this DVD out there in a hurry just to make money from people like me who ran out to buy it and were not as interested in turning out a quality DVD.  Lastly, I do think it was nice of the DVD producers to realese the DVD in it's widescreen version.",1028851200,7,1763,4.406153846153846
682885,3,630356822X,"V was definitly something relativly new. Although it certainly stole from many other Sci-Fi ideas and was full of cheesiness it was still fun.
I disagree with the folks that think there has never been any miniseries to top it since though. This show was creative and fun, but hardly worth such heavy accolades! I think it just filled a Sci-Fi void for us fans. This was before Star Trek TNG and all the ST series that followed, it was before the X-Files and the many wonderful Sci-fi shows we now have to watch on television. It was a trail blazer creating 2 mini series and a short lived regular weekly show(Was it only 1 season I was sure it was 2? But then I may be considering the 2 minis as the real season 1.)Yes we had Battlestar Galactica, Buck Rogers and a few crumbs but nothing compared to what we have today.
V can deffinatley take some of the credit for helping to show the networks that Sci-fi can be a TV ratings hit...but as a true TV classic? Well I certainly enjoyed it but given a choice, I would still rather watch Buffy, The 10 Kingdom or Farscape for quality Sci-fi/fantasy TV.",1028678400,,1099,4.365853658536586

The basic premise - that 50 gigantic flying saucers that appear in the skies over major cities all over the world and are instantly accepted as friendly - was ludicrous.  The secret reason they came - MARS WANTS YOUR WATER - was stupid beyond belief.  You want water?  Fly out to the Oort Cloud surrounding your own solar system and mine it by the ice-asteroid load.
The humans and aliens were cartoonish characatures, unworthy of a saturday morning cartoon.  The most impressive ""special effect"" they came up with was an Alien Babe (tm) gulping down a live rat.  And the Deuz Ex Machina ending to the series was awful.  The only thing worse than this mini-series was the pathetic TV series they tried to follow it up with.",1028160000,5,845,4.624161073825503

If you want a movie with great special effects (and nothing else) then skip buying this series.

Don't get me wrong however, it's still a masterpiece in it's own right.  You can definitely tell though that Warner was making a step in the wrong direction.  Waaaay too much fantasy and far-reaching exploits than I would like to believe.  Once the weekly series hit the ground, it didn't run....it stumbled and fell into the quicksand better known as cancellation.  I was quite surprised of the lengthy run it DID have on TV.  Regardless....this is probably the last good memory that we can have of it on record (I suppose I could throw in the season debut for the actual weekly series which I thought was done marginally) and now we can enjoy it in the most popular format.  I can accuse Warner Home Video of one thing:  not taking the time to put serious quality into the production of the DVD.  Ken Johnson meticuously went over the original audio tracks, digitally enhanced them and remixed them to give it an updated fuller sound than ever experienced.  Here, we are handed Dolby Digital 2.0 and a ""just deal with it"" card.  Prehaps they might release a Criterion Edition and make up for lost quality.  I also believe that there would at least be more behind-the-scenes footage to mete out than what has been done in the past.  I could go on and on about this but I won't.

682893,2,630356822X,"...suprisingly enough, this sequel is pretty bearable.  For one thing, the WWII allegory is muted, thankfully.  For another, since we've already been introduced to the characters, we DON'T have to find out more uninteresting and annoying things about them than we have to.  This film's also got two good performances, as opposed to just one in its predecessor (a la Marc Singer).  Here, Singer is teamed up with Michael Ironside, playing the same character he pretty much plays in every other sci-fi flick he's in but he's always pretty good at playing the same role.  Another positive are the action scenes, which really are pretty well-choreographed and enjoyable.  I might have actually awarded this another star if not for the horrendous ending, which blows any chance of redeeming this film.
Want my opinion?  Probably not, but I would say that this whole series could have used much better writing, more imagination, and probably a larger budget, but I suppose I should forgive its...special effects considering it was made back in 1984...",1012348800,,1045,5.076023391812866

Many of the campaign tatics would be feasible in reality, making this most the most compelling tv series I have ever observed.

The whole series goes by very smoothly  until the end, where the ending is a little weak (which is why I gave it  four stars instead of the five I gave the original series), but other than  that, this is a great series and stands up well with anything else produced  at the time. With a cool story and believable acting, this is a true  classic that should be in any sci-fi fan's collection!",966384000,19,1128,4.77720207253886
682906,4,630356822X,"Sure, a bold and sweeping statement.  Also, utterly true.  Television  viewers of 1984 had never seen anything like V, and anyone who has seen it  would agree that there's been nothing made since to even remotely touch it  in terms of sheer entertainment.
 V: The Final Battle consisted of the  last three 2-hour installments of the series, preceded by the first two  installments of V aired the previous year.  Aliens have finally arrived on  Earth, looking like us and posing as friends to all mankind while their  motherships hover menacingly over every major city of the world.  But  cameraman Mike Donovan infiltrates the Los Angeles mothership and makes an  astounding discovery: the benevolent ""Visitors"" are actually  reptiles in disguise, intent on harvesting all of the natural resources of  the planet, which includes tapping us humans as a food source!  Donovan  joins up with a rag-tag resistance movement led by Julie Parish, and  together they lead their fugitive band in the overthrow of alien tyranny.
 Like any great work of SF, V hits a lot of hot-button social issues,  including abortion, inter-racial relationships and tolerance, and cultish  brainwashing.  And the allegory of the Visitor infiltration of our world to  the rise of Naziism in 30's Europe is hard to miss.  Right down to the  Visitor insignia, a sort of high-tech update of the Swaztika, as well as  scenes with truckloads of confused humans being transported in the middle  of the night to Visitor ""processing"" plants.  Joining with the  social commentary is a fine and able cast, led by ""Beastmaster""  Marc Singer as the independant Donovan and Faye Grant as the tough yet  fragile resistance leader Parish.  Heading the Visitor invasion is Jane  Badler as the catty Diana, along with thier supreme leader John, played by  Richard Herd.  These main players are surrounded by a wonderful supporting  cast, all of whom are given time to be fleshed out into full-fledged  characters you care about.  In particular, Michael Ironside gives a  knock-out performance as hardass ""Ham"" Tyler, an ex-CIA spook  with little social grace but a lot of firepower.  V is wonderfully well  crafted, with its rousing action sequences, amazing-for-TV SFX, and  surprisingly touching moments.  And they really creep things up with two  show-stopping sequences: Grant's powerful interrogation scenes, and the  unforgettable ""birth"" sequence, a true SF classic.  Even the  dodgy puppeteering can't keep me from the edge of my seat everytime I watch  it.
 But, this IS SF, and this IS TV, so we have some obligatory lapses  in logic.  Why do the visitors stay in thier human disguises even when out  of human view on their ships?  Speaking of which, how does a thin layer of  fake skin create such a convincing human appearance for these lizard-like  menaces?  And how, with thousands upon thousands of soldiers and 50 ships  three miles across hovering over every major city, do the Visitors manage  to keep losing to the rabble resisters?  And is it just me, or is the V:TFB  music theme suspiciousy similar to that of ""The Terminator"", also  released this year?  The answer, of course, is who cares?!  Just enjoy the  ride and don't ask so many questions, okay?  Also, while the mini-series  remarkably doesn't feel too dated even 15-16 years after it was made, its  pedigree occasionally pokes through.  In particular, in V:TFB, the scene  where Mike and Julie finally hook-up really stands out as a glaring piece  of early 80's cheese.
 In what has become a market of extremely lame  disease/disaster-of-the-week TV movies, V was something really special: an  epic SF event, lovingly crafted and with no expense spared.  I hasten to  add that it was a defining moment for the generation that saw the rise of  Pac-Man and Mario into popular culture.  The TV movies were followed that  fall by V: The Series, which struggled for a year and was finally  cancelled.  Original broadcaster NBC has attempted to recapture the magic  of V with a number of fantasy TV ""events"" in recent years,  including ""Gulliver's Travels"", ""The Odyssey"",  ""Merlin"" and ""The 10th Kingdom"".  None of which  possessed the same elusive magic as V, however.  It was simply a stunning  achievement, one I'm afraid to say may never be repeated again.",959904000,51,4294,5.0
