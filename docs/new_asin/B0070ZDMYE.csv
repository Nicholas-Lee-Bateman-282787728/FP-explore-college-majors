5046451,1,B0070ZDMYE,"I saw this movie for cheap and it sounded good. Yea, doesn't all horror movie reviews start that way? Anyways, the story, acting, and timing is good. There is no blood or gore in the r-rated version, matter of fact it's could be pg-13. I didn't know there was an unrated version when I bought it and that is something I can't stand is unrated films. There is a site where you can check the difference between films but this one didn't have this movie up yet. I don't know how gory it could have been. So yea, it's a basic pg-13 horror film with a good cast but very little blood and no gore. The film doesn't really make sense in some scenes but I guess i'll have to wait for the website to get ahold of the copy to see if I missed anything. The movie gets funny towards the end when they find the owner's nephew, Frank. Other then a few dumb laughs, stay away from this movie or at least get the unrated version. Also, the guy on the cover doesn't even appear in the r rated version.",1337817600,,984,4.130208333333333
5046452,1,B0070ZDMYE,"I kept seeing this movie Wreckage available to rent on my local RedBox but it was never in stock. So I decided to take a chance and purchase this movie from Amazon. BIG mistake! This is one of the worst movies I have seen and it was WAY overpriced on Amazon. Please pay $1 and rent this if you must, you will not have any desire to watch it again. By the way, the movie was so predictable as to who the killer was....",1336521600,2,417,3.9761904761904763
5046453,1,B0070ZDMYE,"Awful movie even for a low budget b sort-of-horror/action movie.  Completely generic, uninteresting, and not worth your time or attention.  Great box art but hollow movie.  I knew better renting it, still did it.  Don't make my mistake.",1335571200,3,236,5.131578947368421
5046454,1,B0070ZDMYE,"No subtitles which is the usual indicator of cheap. To further add fuel to that fire is having 13 producers which is over twice the number of actors in this movie with speaking roles exceeding two sentences. Twice during the beginning credits and once at the end is a large chunk of time devoted to showcasing and advertising studios. Two or three times we see: Phase 4 Films; Camelot Entertainment; Darknight Pictures; Yale Productions; Frigerio Films; Ashland Films; Xanthus Pictures; Downhome Entertainment.

Sandwiched between this self promotion was a short film about young brothers one of whom unrealistically shoots his mom and her boyfriend then years later we learn that the innocent brother has taken the jail time rap to cover his brother's killing indiscretion. The imprisoned, now older, brother decides to escape. Meanwhile his younger brother is with a small group of adults in a wrecking yard looking for a car part to fix their broken vehicle. Some people die. Usual formula portrayal of dumb decisions by the victims and dumb cops fill in the storyline. Poor writing and editing leaves the story overly disjointed with poor character development and fragmented scenes being jumbled together.

I suggest the 2007 Donnie Yen Hong Kong movie ""Flash Point"" as an alternative action thriller, and as a comparison.",1335484800,3,1327,5.138888888888889
5046455,3,B0070ZDMYE,"""Listen sheriff, why would I come get you if I did this? That doesn't make sense"" After a race ends with Jared's (Erwin) car throwing a belt and blowing a gasket the friends' weekend plans are in jeopardy. After his friend Rick (Paul) recommends to go to the nearby junkyard for the parts. While they are there Rick begins to fool around with a gun and accidentally shoots Jared's new fianc. When Jared comes back with help one of the friends is dead and the other two are missing. This is not a bad movie at all, it's also not really a good movie. The idea is overused and the acting isn't the best. The twist is predictable, but all that said the movie is watchable. This is the type of movie that keeps you watching and interested, but when it's over you aren't sure why you kept watching. I have seen much worse and you could do worse then this movie. Overall, a very OK movie that is nothing special or new. I give it a C+.",1331164800,9,928,4.219101123595506
5046456,3,B0070ZDMYE,"""Wreckage"" turned out to be a ok movie for me, today was movie night for me, and I watched this on Netflix.  It started off very slow and picked up during the middle of the movie. I felt like it was going to be ok since,  the guy who played ""Jesses"" in the hit series ""Breaking Bad"" played the bad guy in this movie. I wouldn't go out and buy this movie nor rent it , I'd wait for it on regular TV or watch it on Netflix. Again it was an ok movie!",1404777600,,447,3.74468085106383
5046457,5,B0070ZDMYE,I loved this movie. It was a great suspenseful horror movie. It kept my interest and I was very surprised by the ending. Worth watching.,1381449600,,136,4.48
5046458,4,B0070ZDMYE,This is more like a cult type horror movie.  I liked it.  Acting was good and the story was pretty cool.  Ending was kind of predictable but overall it isn't too bad of a movie.,1377043200,,177,4.0
5046459,3,B0070ZDMYE,"I bought this as an ex rental from my local I didn't expect to much and like many others have rented and bought a string of real clunkers this was a real surprise. First off ,sure its the old car breaks down and what was that start all about stick with it and all will be revealed. There is heaps of blood and gore I have to say from my point of view that the acting was average not bad by any means and if you watch the extras as I usually do you will be told that it was filmed in fourteen days and was done on a budget of $500000 scrip was conceived and written in six days . Hey enough of all this a reader who was disappointed with it says to rent it for a buck what have you got to lose I enjoyed it and I am fairly certain horror fans will to. I really liked the Sherriff and was amazed when the director said it was his father-in-law and he dragged him in to be in the movie. Well the balls in your court go for it

5046460,5,B0070ZDMYE,"Hands down one of the worst slasher/horror movies out there-- yet HILARIOUS in all it's unintentional wonderful s***ty-ness. Roommates and I have a debate as to whether its ironically bad or unintentionally bad but either way, if you like crappy horror movies this one is awesome. Do not expect any level of film excellance, but enjoy the mockery.",1362528000,,347,5.0
5046461,5,B0070ZDMYE,totally love this movie and the dvd was in great shape and got it in time frame they said i would,1359936000,,97,3.6666666666666665
5046462,3,B0070ZDMYE,"Wreckage follows a group of teenagers who head to a junkyard to salvage a few parts when their car breaks down. Unbeknownst to them, a crazy serial killer has broke out of prison and is in the area. One by one, they're hunted down. In the end, it becomes an ultimate struggle for survival.

This slasher film, although a decent watch, is all over the place. When you watch the movie, you'll see it raises more questions in your mind than it needs to. I know Director John Mallory Asher was, probably, trying to build up the story into something big...but, if it were simple & a little more tightly focused, it could have achieved the same thing. Sure, everything is tied together neatly by the end but all that extra baggage was for naught. Too, the film isn't very long and that's another thing that is against it. Two things the movie does have going for it is that it looks pretty good to be a low-budget affair & the acting was good.

 Wreckage is, I'll say it again, a decent watch. However, it's not worth more than a rental. It could've been so much more but chose to be what is so I'm calling it like I see it.",1348185600,,1118,4.289099526066351
5046463,3,B0070ZDMYE,"After watching a string of sub-par horror and slasher movies from Redbox, I didn't expect much from Wreckage.  But in the end, it was a decent little movie night flick.  Despite its shortcomings, Wreckage was actually a fun watch.

Wreckage tells the story about a group of young people from rural North Carolina that make their way to a remote junkyard after breaking down on the highway. What they don't realize is that a convicted killer from the next town over has escaped prison, and is making his way towards them. Victims are picked off one by one as they try to discover who is responsible for the killings.

Wreckage is a low-budget movie, so don't expect theater-quality performances. Most of the cast worked in television rather than movies, and a few hadn't acted before Wreckage, so the acting is slightly below average. Fortunately the older and more seasoned cast members make up for the film's lack of experienced actors.

The story itself isn't anything special. The film's ""twist"" is predictable about halfway through the movie, with some foreshadowing even earlier than that which gives you a clue as to what the twist may be.

All that having been said, Wreckage is still entertaining. Even though the story isn't that great, the writing for the dialogue is surprisingly good. For this being David Frigerio's first full-length film screenplay, he put together some clever speaking scenes.

There's a decent little bit of gore, although a few of the murders take place off-screen. But what makes Wreckage an enjoyable horror flick is that they managed to keep it funny where it counts. Scoot McNairy steals every scene he's in as the backwoods owner of the junkyard. While the whole ""ignorant hillbilly"" character is a little outdated, Scoot constantly delivers the best lines of the movie, with perfect comedic timing. Even after the credits finish rolling, there's a funny extended scene with him which I'm convinced was half-improvised.

Not sure if I'd buy the DVD, but Wreckage was definitely worth a rent. It's not exactly theater-quality, but if you're a horror fan looking to have a fun evening with a B-Movie, you should check it out.",1347148800,,2162,4.9366391184573
5046464,2,B0070ZDMYE,"This is your far too typical slasher film that offers nothing new. We see a young boy kill his mom's drug dealing boyfriend because he won't hand him the remote...and yes I have killed for the remote too, but never for cartoons. When 4 young adults show up at a junk yard, one of them is shot by horseplay. The police get involved and now a killer is loose.

The dialouge is as good as most slashers with a few quips. The characters are at times fun, and other times just boring, as the film runs hot and cold and seems to drag even during some action scenes. If you want to watch a new slasher, try ""Deadtime.""

F-bomb, no sex, no nudity.",1338595200,,639,4.186991869918699
5046465,3,B0070ZDMYE,"A bespeckled Scoot McNairy is the saving grace of WRECKAGE.  He plays a goofy redneck manager of the rundown junkyard where the film occurs and manages to steal every scene he's in.
Otherwise, WRECKAGE is a fairly routine and predictable slasher flick.  Opening with a fifteen year flashback, the movie jumps to present day where we meet 4 young people facing a maniacal killer in a run-down car junkyard.  BREAKING BAD's Aaron Paul and Mike Erwin head an adequate cast which also includes 70s character actors Roger Perry and Joyce Bulifant in supporting roles.
This rated version is sparse on gore and nudity attempting to chill audiences with its eerie setting.
While WRECKAGE isn't a great slasher entry, McNairy makes it fun.",1338336000,,730,4.967213114754099
8507914,1,B0070ZDMYE,"Two couples, one engaged and the other expecting, break into a scrapyard to fix their car after it breaks down. When one gets shot, the moronic cops get involved not knowing a mysterious killer is on the loose.

In most b-grade horror films you can count on there being at least one moronic character. Not so here, they change it up by making all of them mouth-breathing idiots. That gets old VERY fast by the way. Some comedy make this otherwise atrocious film somewhat more palatable, but it's nothing I could watch multiple times, I barely made it all the way through the first time. Ridiculously stupid, even offensively so.",1516233600,,628,4.709090909090909
