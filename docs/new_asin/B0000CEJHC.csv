7999096,1,B0000CEJHC,"I am a direct student of Professor Chen, Hui Xian to whom this lineage was passed on to by Master Zhao. I, along with many others, am certified to teach Soaring Crane Qi Gong.
It is totally unadvisable to try to learn this form of Qi Gong without a certified teacher. This is a form of medical qi gong with very powerful healing benefits, but if NOT practiced properly can cause serious deviations to your health. Please do not purchase this unless you plan to study with a certified teacher!",1508803200,,492,4.477777777777778
7999097,4,B0000CEJHC,"Very nice video of the elderly Grandmaster of Soaring Crane still giving
classes. Though this style is rather disputed this video is without doubt
very good also for persons with restricted abilities to move. The clarity and good energy of the long life of this master is convincing.

The more it is regretful that the producer stopped production. Why? Not fashionable and beautiful enough? Quality should be better appreciated.",1238716800,3,428,5.202898550724638
7999098,5,B0000CEJHC,"I began studying Soaring Crane Qi Gong using the video after being shown each of the five basic exercises by a practitioner.  I find the video useful.  Following the exercises in the way they are organized on the video is like taking private classes in Soaring Crane.  First you learn the basic physical movements and the mental focus of the exercise.  Then you learn advanced, more subtle aspects of the mental focus.  As you practice the exercises with Master Zhao and listen to the voice-over, you find that over time you are memorizing the movements and learning the deeper mental components.  Finally, as you have absorbed the physical form and have learned more about the meaning of mental focus, you can use the third part of the video, where there is no voice-over, as a companion to your practice, to guide yourself and remind yourself.  There is no need to view the entire video every time you practice with the video.  You can watch the entire video as you are learning the basics, and then use only the third part.  You can refresh your learning as needed by focusing on any single aspect of the five basic exercises.  The camera work is very good, and you see all the movements clearly demonstrated. The physical setting is beautiful, ranging from Sedona to the water's edge to the Alaskan tundra. The flute music in the background during the third section is meditative and enjoyable.  If you want silence as you practice, turn the volume down!  Regarding difficulty, I started to do Soaring Crane using the video at the age of 64, with a diagnosis of stage four lung cancer.  I used it following surgery and through chemo treatments, and continue with my routines daily.  I do the five routines three times a day.  I am now recovered and cancer free, but continue my practice.  I am not particularly physically adept, but find the exercises easy enough to do.  If you lose your balance, you do what you can.  Trying to do the exercises will improve your balance and your strength and your concentration, and your ability to do it will improve.  Once you realize you can lose your balance or do something imperfectly at first and allow yourself to persevere, soon you will be able to do what at first you couldn't.  I recommend this video to all who want the healing of Soaring Crane Qi Gong and the life style of serenity and well-being and vitality that practicing this form offers.",1186444800,7,2398,4.664285714285715
7999099,4,B0000CEJHC,"Soaring Crane Qigong by Zhao Jin Xiang, a VHS tape of the five routines, is narrated by a calming voice and clearly presented in color with soothing background music. The routines are performed by the author against a backdrop of mountains and rocky lake shores.

The presentation approach consists of showing the five routines three times: once in an overview, then with details, and finally when the whole form is demonstrated at the end of the tape.

By reviewing the tape several times, learning the form should not difficult to accomplish - there are no movements that hide details from the frontal view used in the video.

There are two movements that require balancing on one leg, which might pose a problem for some beginners. Until a beginner's balance is developed through repeated trials, it may be necessary for the beginner to touch the ground with the other foot - but in no way does this take away from the value of the video.

This VHS is well done and accomplishes its stated purposes.",1179100800,9,1002,4.741379310344827
7999100,5,B0000CEJHC,"This Video is very well done. It is visually appealing. Both the instructions and routines are explained and performed in a simple, easy to understand manner.

I found this style of Qigong very similar to that of Master Yu Cheng Huang, author of the Xuan Ming Dao series. If you are having trouble finding his books and or tape, this is the next best thing.",1174521600,4,357,4.492307692307692
7999101,4,B0000CEJHC,"I am a certified Soaring Crane Qigong instructor and have seen this material presented in various forms. This video is the best version of this material that I have seen. The Five Routines are amply demonstrated by Master Zhao, the creator of this incredible practice. The scenery, music and Maureen's narration certainly support the presentation of this extremely valuable information. I would, however, strongly suggest that this video be used in conjunction with private or class instruction for best results. Benefit gained from this comprehensive qi gong practice is directly related to the frequency & accuracy of practice.",1153699200,7,629,5.428571428571429
7999102,1,B0000CEJHC,"I bought this tape based on the review of the qigong teacher who wrote the January 2004 review, and I can believe he found it helpful and easy for his use, BUT (Big BUT)if you have balance problems, are overweight, or elderly, you may find this routine beyond your capability because so much of it involves standing on and moving from one foot only. In addition, when it says five routines of Souring Crane, it means ONLY five routines. The tape starts with background of the instructor, then it goes into a narrated version of each of the routines, then it goes into a detailed narrated version of each of the routines. So far this takes up 2/3 of the tape. Then it goes into a non-narrated version of the five routines. So, the first 2/3 of the tape are instructional, but ""jerky"" because there is so much stopping and starting each of the routines over again, but you have to go through all that before you get to the un-narrated version just so you can learn the routines. There is nothing at all about proper breathing techniques, which should be an inherent part of qigong. I think there must be better tapes out there.",1097452800,17,1125,4.492682926829269
7999103,5,B0000CEJHC,"This is a wonderful video. As a Qigong instructor, I'm always looking for new sequences/exercises to teach my students. When I did the first sequence from this video, I was astounded at the instant improvement in back flexibility. I was also impressed with the easy to follow instructions -- first on how to do the movement, and then followup instructions on what to focus on, such as breath, where to focus your attention, etc. I highly recommend this for any and all fitness and age levels.",1075420800,18,492,4.732558139534884
