7474707,5,B016LFK2E6,"This has quickly become one of my favorite shows.  I originally bought it looking for Nick Jonas eye candy.  Actually, there is surprisingly less of than than I thought.  He is one of the main characters, but the story line doesn't revolve around him.  It gives equal time to all of the characters.  It plays on the drama of running the gym and old washed up fighters making a new career for themselves.  This is not a show that focuses on the gay aspect of Nate.  It is mentioned very little actually.  It is more about the bond of family and friends.  If you are a UFC/MMA fan, and like the idea of a gay character being developed come season 2 then you'll love this show.",1450569600,4,674,4.285714285714286

7474711,5,B016LFK2E6,This show is authentic and a refreshing change from the usual drama. My favorite character is Jay. I love his unconditional love he shows his crazy mother.,1448150400,,155,4.777777777777778

Thus, I'm definitely about to order this DVD! I enjoyed every episode of the 1st season, and am currently watching the second season. This series is a must have in anyone's DVD collection, and not just because of Nick Jonas. The entire cast is likable.",1446508800,7,428,4.644736842105263
7474715,5,B016LFK2E6,Great series,1486080000,,12,5.5
7474716,5,B016LFK2E6,I am really surprised to  like this series. I do not watch MMA  as I find it a bit too brutal.  Yet  I was drawn into this because the  acting  and story line are  great.  The personal struggles of the characters are universal and their motivations palpable.  I particularly like Jonathon Tucker as Jay.  A very emotional performance with real heart.  I hope they do justice to the character Nate in Season 2.  Its about time there were a realistic gay character living in the straight world portrayed on film.,1485475200,4,510,4.544444444444444
7474717,4,B016LFK2E6,"I love this show. It is a shame that it is only available on Direct TV. I think it could have been a hit on HBO or Showtime. Nonetheless, if you are a fan of MMA you won't be disappointed. My favorite part of the show are the performances of Jonathan Tucker and Joanna Going. Their chemistry as mother and son is a testament to their talent as actors.",1485216000,,351,4.101449275362318
7474718,5,B016LFK2E6,This was an awesome show to watch. It shows what families go through and how they handle hard or even worse situations. The show covers so many subjects and keeps you interested every minute.,1484438400,,191,4.647058823529412

7474734,4,B016LFK2E6,"I like this show! It's so L.A. The casting of Frank as the father. I'm not convenience. Don't get me wrong, He's acting is great! It's just that his look's.. To young, especially up with the actor Jonathan Tucker, brother maybe. But not son.. Frank, you look better than the character Alvey! If that make any sense.",1465516800,,315,4.543859649122807

7474736,5,B016LFK2E6,"That was exciting and heartwarming. It amazingly blends professional sport and family drama. Each characters has own idiosyncrasy. They are not perfect persons. That's why they give a huge impression to you. They are distressed, sometimes make huge mistake. That's why I'm moved by their human touch. It includes the mind and way of life in tactics and techniques, at the same time, for fighters during battle.
If you are not interest in MMA,you'll definitely become like it after you watched.
I sincerely hope it will be available in Japan.",1464393600,5,541,5.022222222222222

7474739,5,B016LFK2E6,"Don't read what others are saying about this work of art...just BUY it!

I'm only through the first three episodes and ready to BUY season 2 as soon as it's available.

No matter if you are gay, straight, or whatever, this is excellent story line, character development, plot, and acting, are all rolled into one solid production.

However, if you are a gay man like me you too will be ""piqued"" by the grit, TESTOSTERONE, beauty of the male body, and ""balls!""
Enjoy the ride...you won't be teased or taunted, but solely entertained again and again.

I paid for my copy and was not and has NEVER been offered a gift copy to review anything.",1461715200,14,639,4.530434782608696

Cost an arm and leg to get here from the US but the look on his face when he got it was priceless.  Seems like a great item so far, don't know why someone else complained about it not being HD as the picture quality seems superb.

7474754,4,B016LFK2E6,This is a great series showing the hard gritty underside of the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles.  The actors are excellent and this series is great entertaining drama.  Great eye candy for women and gay men.  Great action for straight men.,1453334400,,242,4.853658536585366

8736686,5,B016LFK2E6,The package came early. Perfect condition. The show is more about the family and the gym rather than the mma fighting. The characters are less about gender roles and more about how situations effect people in general. The fist three episodes tell about the characters and then disc two and three delve into the action. I will look for the next two seasons when they are released.,1510617600,,379,4.6716417910447765
