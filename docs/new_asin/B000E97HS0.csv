8107596,3,B000E97HS0,It was more a scientific study than an adventure story. It was good just not what I was expecting.,1495843200,,98,4.2105263157894735
8107597,3,B000E97HS0,Excellent camera work and discussion of altitude-related illnesses.  I expected more detail of the climbing routes and weather-related dangers.,1476921600,,143,6.526315789473684

8107601,4,B000E97HS0,Very excellent documentary.  Gave me a few more things to think about regarding those who choose to climb.  Just wish the documentary had been longer.,1411430400,,150,4.96
8107602,3,B000E97HS0,"Nice to watch, not not as exciting as other movies about Everest or K2. It is worth to buy and see, but lower your expectations.",1371945600,,128,4.16
8107603,5,B000E97HS0,"This is my second purchase of a Mt. Everest themed DVD since I read ""Into thin Air."" I was so enthralled in this story that I had to get the video. This one is similar to the IMAX DVD but differ in some areas. I can't get enough of the Everest stories! DVD was used but works great and received in normal time!",1325721600,,310,3.9365079365079363
8107604,5,B000E97HS0,I am from Alaska...and have scaled Mt. Kilimanjaro (East Africa)...and Denali.  This film is so on...if you have never climbed to America's highest peak...and would like to--but cannot for whatever reason...this is as good as it gets!!!!,1200614400,3,237,5.405405405405405
8107605,4,B000E97HS0,This is a good movie about Mt. Denali in Alaska.  A general reference not a fully loaded detailed film about the mountain.  Shows a general example what it is like to climb there.,1183939200,3,179,4.393939393939394
