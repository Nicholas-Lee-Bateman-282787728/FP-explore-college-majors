1383513,4,B00004ZB6M,"Having seen the show live and watched the video, I naturally prefer the live show. The video certainly captures the spirit and energy of the live show, but cannot replace the experience of LIVING the show. The live show has added even more visuals since this taping (hard to imagine), and I was a bit disappointed there. The skills and talent of the performers are awesome. It's easy to forget that they are actually playing while moving. At times the cameras seemed to be at just the wrong angle to get the full effect, but since you can't tape the performance yourself, buy this video... and then buy tickets to see it live. It's the next best thing to being there.",972345600,4,667,4.520661157024794
1383514,5,B00004ZB6M,"This performance is composed of fantastic choreography and an explosion of musical climaxes. This video is a combination of drum corp style performances and full stage music and dance productions performed by some of the best in the industry. I haven't seen such a variety of drums and percussions on one stage ever. Simply, a must see.

1383526,5,B00004ZB6M,"After the 1993 Drum Corps International season, the staff of Star of Indiana imagined something beyond the football field, beyond the limitations of the rules and preconceived ideas of what visual/musical/movement expression existed in drum corps.  Blast! is the result of the culmination of their quest to make something different, something more, but with close ties to their DCI past.

Blast! is what happens when you stir up the creative juices of young musicians and limit them only to the size of the theater.  It is music that must be seen, heard, and felt, soaked up by all your senses at once.",1436400000,2,602,4.882352941176471

1383533,5,B00004ZB6M,How DO they do it ??  The non-stop action and top level playing are a joy to watch.  Energy that only youth has.  The level of memorization involved is uncanny.  Sure --- they sync a lot --- but so what ?,1422144000,,204,3.902439024390244

1383543,5,B00004ZB6M,"They advertise it as ""an explosive musical celebration"" and you know what? it is.

1383544,1,B00004ZB6M,"This DVD is misleading...BORING & BOGUS! it is. I have viewed many exciting examples of Drum and Bugle ensembles, this one just dosen't fit into that catagory. It seems, most of those reviews who praised this show haven't experienced the real deal. It lacked showmanship, as far as backgrounds and scenery. You get more from a football half-time show(old school that is), or just a holiday parade. At least at these events you can really hear & feel the excitement of music, along with seeing the uniforms worn; you don't have to imagine any of it! I am quite knowledgable, regarding all music forms...whereas BLAST! does cover some variations of it, it's more or less a 'potpourri' thing!?! I gave it A star, simply because the musicans did know how to play their instruments...!!!

I had ordered two copies; one for my son...pleeease, I am returning the other copy. I wish I could send the one I opened back as well...but that will be trashed; just saying!!!!",1377561600,,961,4.754491017964072
1383545,5,B00004ZB6M,Someone has the idea to put a drum core marching band on stage and make a show of it......It turned out awesome!! Expect everything that you see in a Corps style drum and bugle core marching show and much much more adapted to the stage. I would have given this one 10 stars if I had the chance.......I am a music teacher and love marching bands!.....or wasn't that obvious from the start!,1376697600,,388,4.402777777777778

1383549,5,B00004ZB6M,Great video and a must for fans of pageantry.  Labeling it Chuck Mangione is incorrect.  It actually includes music from many sources.,1371513600,,134,5.045454545454546
1383550,5,B00004ZB6M,I saw this show when it was at Disney CA Adventure years ago and i was hooked.. This show made me get into music and that is what i do as a proffesion now. I cannot recommend this show highly enough.,1359676800,,199,3.8780487804878048

1383552,5,B00004ZB6M,"I'd seen this show on television some years back and kept waiting for it to be released on DVD

OK...I was a Marching band parent. As a result, I love drum and bugle corps shows...even went to the Drum Corps International championships at the Rose Bowl a few years ago.  Bought tickets for my ex-wife, son and daughter as we all loved this stuff.
Blast is an auditorium show unlike any you're likely to see elsewhere.  It works on so many levels and the showmanship of the performers, (typically D&C performers ""Age out"" at 21) is incredible.

I love to watch this DVD over and over.",1358294400,,583,4.471698113207547

1383555,5,B00004ZB6M,A rush of energy and great music. A concert of former drum and bugle corp members  transformed into a great stage production,1356566400,,124,4.636363636363637
1383556,5,B00004ZB6M,"What is ""BLAST""?  In short, this is a wonderful carrying over of the football field marching tradition on to the stage.  It's no ""Stomp"" (what apparently is the common comparison)...but it never pretended to be in the first place.

This really is the marching/DCI enthusiasts stage show.  Instead of doing mini-musical skits that other similar musical shows have done, ""BLAST"" focuses on drills, formations, and pageantry...the things that used to only belong on the football field.  And that, alone, is the novel part.  The drills are tight and sharp, the energy is at times overwhelming.  I must also add, the pageantry/guard is sharp and vibrant as ever.  To this day, I wonder how they can spin, toss, and jump around in complete unison.  The fact that they memorized all the music, yet maintain an orchestral-like power throughout is amazing.  The music is quite varied ranging from classical, jazz, latin, orchestral numbers, musicals, techno, and more.  The drum battles are fun too :-) This can be a good introduction for anyone interested in the marching tradition.

I will admit, this may not be the type of show everyone will get into, but it is one that all should at least see once...live preferably.

The camera angles are professionally done and very complimentary to what is going on.  The audio is very lively and well captured.  As to SPECIAL FEATURES, there isn't much, but what is there is good.  The ability to switch camera angles at will is fun.  AND the 25-minute ""Making of..."" documentary is a wonderful glimpse into the inner workings of ""BLAST""

In all, this show is one that reveals what the power of unity and common goal can achieve.  It was a great inspiration as a musician.",1343347200,2,1707,4.844290657439446
1383557,4,B00004ZB6M,"If you have ever enjoyed Drum and Bugle Corps music and performances,or you have never even seen one, you will enjoy the brass, percussion and artistic performances on this DVD, set to a stage presented theatrical performance.  The musical and artistic talent of this group is just amazing.

1383558,5,B00004ZB6M,"This video is a must-see. Even people who aren't into orchestral music will be into this. It's the most interesting combination of music, drama, and dancing that I've ever seen. The performers not only play their instrustuments.... they play their instruments accompanied by choreography and using some VERY unique stage props. You've never seen instruments played IN THIS WAY before! Guaranteed NOT to be bored.",1337817600,,412,5.3538461538461535

1383560,5,B00004ZB6M,"Was lucky to see the live performance three times, and each time loved it more! The DVD allows me to enjoy the music and performance over and over again ... and share it with others, especially my sons, all who have marched in their high school band.

Ever wonder where all those ""geeks"" go ... they've got the last laugh in this production!! This show is a brilliant marriage of musical talent and performance ... matching the strength and stamina of most athletes. Kudos to the cast ... an outstanding bunch of talented musicians who know how to have fun!

1383563,5,B00004ZB6M,"This is a great DVD to show to your brass and percussion students.  I would recommend starting it at ""The Battle"" if you only have a 45-55 minute class.  The band students tend to lose interest in the pieces where there is singing-most of those pieces are towards the beginning.  Honestly, I would recommend taking all of your students to see the performance live if it is showing anywhere nearby.",1277510400,,397,4.642857142857143

From the very first note, to the very last note, this DVD is an amazing showcase of what very talented people can achieve with a little hard-work. It also has the intermission percussion bit where a couple of percussionists play during intermission in the lobby, which I missed live because it was so crowded. Seriously amazing piece of musical masterpiece. And the DVD extras has a behind the scenes bit where they follow the crew around on a typical day.

1383576,5,B00004ZB6M,"Taped in 2000 at the London Apollo Hammersmith Theatre, is unlike anything we have ever seen before!  It is truly unique and amazing.  The production is about percussion, horns, dance, intricate choreography with props, color and music. The music ranges from Broadway, pop, classical, etc.

A total of 70 performers grace and glide the stage, lighting is beautiful with varying colors that match the performers costumes.  What was amazing to me was a dance with flags:  the colorful flags were thrown from offstage to middlestage and they were caught perfectly by each person.  You will have to see it.

There are snare drum soloists.  Men play the horns and gracefully provide dance movements.  There is just too much here do describe.  But this is the type of show you can have as background when family or friends come for a visit.

Disappointing was the segment ""Making of Blast"", which consisted only of chats with some horn and drum players.  I would have like to have seen more of how the production was made.

But all in all, one has a difficult time describing this production other than it is an extravaganza unlike any other......Rizzo",1215993600,,1146,4.845360824742268

Having sung(badly) and danced(even worse) while in a local chorus I was blown away by, not only the quality of the performers, but their versatility. They are clearly the ""best of the best""in all respects. When I heard BLAST! was coming to town, I gathered up a bunch of friends to see the show. An amazing show from beginning to end.

I have seen the stage production, and the only thing missing from the DVD is the trumpet slide malfunction I witnessed (the tuning slide for the third valve flew off and landed on the side of the stage during some of the high speed movements.  As a former trumpet player and drum major I may be slightly biased, but think about what they did...

Take the best few members of each marching bands in a couple counties and put together a Drum and Bugle Corps.  Then let all the corps from across the country compete throughout high school and college, honing their skills.  Many of them acquire degrees in music along the way.  Then take the best members of those organizations who have just been kicked out because they are too old (over 21!) and put them on stage.

They are absolutely amazing, and are as capable physically as musically.  One role (and there are several performers who have to be able to perform it) marches a route that comes towards the center of the stage while playing, takes their instrument down long enough to do a one-handed walkover, and resumes playing while still being in step with the rest of the group.

There is no other disc I watch as often as this.  I came here to replace a disc that was burned when a friend's house was totalled.

1383591,4,B00004ZB6M,"Blast! is indeed a wonderful show. Taking the traditional Drum and Bugle show to the stage (in this case the London stage) is truly an inspired idea.  The DVD needs to be played loud and on a very good sound system.  As one reviewer mentioned below, the video does leave something to be desired if you actually want to see the show as intended. However, that review theorized that the director of the video release was incompetent and of not knowing the audience well enough to produce a presentation that Blast! aficionados would appreciate. While the fast cut, moving camera production style of the video is a travesty, I have another hypothesis.

I would like to suggest that there is another possibility besides incompetence for its poor execution.  I think it is just as likely that the producers purposefully decided to only use the money angle (center house from the front of the mezzanine level) on rare occasions.

The majority of the DVD seems to intentionally avoid the one camera angle that we would like to see the most. The DVD is like a trailer for a movie. It doesn't show you enough to tell what is really going on but it does sufficiently tease you to want to go see the show live. The producers may have simply told the director/editor of the video to AVOID using the center house mezzanine shot so as to not dilute the value of the ticket for the live show.

So, whether incompetent editing/directing or simply a desire to tease the DVD audience with oblique camera angles from the cheap seats, the effect is the same. The visuals are far too frenetic and clever by half to truly get an idea of what the cast of Blast! is doing on the stage. And that's too bad because Blast! is all about unified and highly choreographed motion.  Only on occasion does the DVD reveal this fact.",1123459200,8,1798,4.565217391304348
1383592,5,B00004ZB6M,Simply amazing! There are no other words I can use to describe Blast. You have to see it for yourself.,1123200000,,102,4.15
1383593,5,B00004ZB6M,"I was skeptical at first, but have been watching it so much that I may need to buy another.  It is that Good.  My compliments to the director and all who worked on it.",1121731200,2,167,3.8823529411764706
1383594,4,B00004ZB6M,"If you have seen the show live then the DVD is a must have. Turn it up loud and try to ignore the truly amateurish video directing (more on this in a moment).  The cast is in top form in this performance, done before a live audience in London.  Ben Harloff, flugelhorn and trumpeter extraordinaire, steals the show on several occasions including in the amazingly soulful Don Ellis tune ""Loss"", and the upbeat Mangione (no, despite the Amazon titling, Chuck is not on the DVD) chart, ""Land of Make Believe"" (watch for his circular breathing trick where he plays a note without breaking for what seems like minutes).

The drumming is spectacular, the visual ensemble ""brilliant"" (as Londoners like to say of the show), and the brass are, well, POWERFUL, is the best term to describe them. If you have not seen the show live, it is worth seeing. The cast is in Japan over the summer of '05 but will be back in the states come fall of '05.  (...).

As for the DVD itself. It is a directorial mess.  Oh, the audio is very well done but the video looks like it was directed by a guy more used to doing Yani concerts than Drum and Bugle. And this is a variation, if rarified version, of drum corps and as such, should be presented with that in mind.  The whole idea of a show like Blast! is to let it play on your senses without video gimmicks. It is choreographed in such a way that the show is intended to wash over you, at times come at you unexpectedly from your peripheral vision, and generally present itself as a unified whole, not as a series of clever video moves.

Much like drum corps, where the performers are often acting as one organism, so too the cast of Blast! works together in amazing harmony. However, to watch the video you would rarely know it. The director has a dozen cameras (and he's not afraid to use them).  Although the video is not as horrific as Riverdance, where you never get to see any more than about a second of continuous video from one angle, Blast! is not a whole lot better.  Rather than give us a general overview of the action, the director has the cameras follow individual cast members across stage, give us side shots of action when we should be seeing it head on, panning, spinning, rotating, he uses every cheesy move possible as if he thought the show wasn't interesting enough so he thought he might spice it up a little. But the directing is too clever by half; key action is missed due to an unending stream of extreme closeups of horn bells, sweaty brows, and audience members.

Rarely is the viewer treated to, what one might hope a DVD of this type would be good for, a view from the best seat in the house.  Live, Blast! is best seen from the center of the Mezzanine level.  From this viewpoint one can appreciate the high level of synchronicity  that is involved with indoor drum and bugle corps antics.  However, the DVD only gives you this view on rare occasions, opting instead for oblique shots from the cheap orchestra level seats, front row seats, on stage with a steadicam (some of the most irritating shots imaginable), and from overhead.

True, there are a few songs (""Land of Make Believe"", ""Loss"", and ""Spiritual of the Earth"", that are not completely ruined by the incessant cuts and idiotic camera angles but this is because there is less large unit choreography to these numbers.  Most of the others, most notably, ""Lemon Techno"" are COMPLETELY ruined by the tasteless video directing.  ""Techno"" simply has to be seen from the center of the auditorium to appreciate the amazing flag handling done by the visual ensemble.  Instead, the DVD emasculates the harmony of the movement by interjecting endless closeups, tracking shots of individual performers, and generally ignores the wide angle cover shot that one so desperately hopes will come (but almost never does).

Fortunately, there are three songs that allow the DVD viewer to select the ""angle"" which gives a less frenetic editing pace and more wide angle shots so you can actually see what is going on. It's too bad this option was not available for the whole DVD.

All in all, the video is a mixed bag due to the problem of the video director forgetting editing 101: ""KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE AND MATERIAL"". The audience for Blast! wants to see the performers working together as a unit. That is what Drum and Bugle is all about.  Close-ups and fast paced editing in a show like this just proves how poorly prepared the director and producer were for the show.  Next time, save the fast cuts for a Kenny G concert where there is nothing really going on.

Blast! does not need to be hyped with unnecessary video tricks. It stands on its own quite well.",1120867200,8,4666,4.553827751196172

1383599,5,B00004ZB6M,"Ballet, modern dance, marching bands, drum and bugle corps, flag dancers, bell ringers, army drill teams and more are what you can expect from this original and fascinating visual display of music.
This collection of music and movement does its best to avoid classification.  There is simply nothing like it.  Imagine seeing the following:
A drum team with the precision of Riverdance
A trombone player riding a unicycle
Dancers dancing with giant blades of grass
Colorful flag throw across stage in musical precision
Officer Krupke done in a way that makes West Side Story look dull
A xylophonist playing while chasing his instrument
Drum rolls so fact the sound like bees
Beautiful ballet and precision dance while playing instruments
Swords and rifles used for dance and as drumsticks
Blindfolded drummer who change drum sets without missing a beat
Some of the best horn playing around
A dozen tubas gyrating to a rhumba beat
More more more...
There are two themes that thread through all of the productions.  The first is the use of color.  Flags, lights, costumes and props take the production through the rainbow.  The second is that these performers really love what they are doing.  Just look at their faces.
The camera work is well done.  Angle change to show what is going on without being to spastic like in Lord of the Dance.  There is even an intermission where several performers join the audience and use stools for drums.
My only complaint is that some numbers are actually several pieces in a row without their own separate tracks.  So when watching the drum battle, if you want to see the precision blindfolds, you will have to watch the pieces before it (at least until you set your own bookmarks).
My whole family really loves this one from my wife and myself to my one-year-old and my four-year-old.  The visuals are gripping and unbelievable.  While the music itself is great, anyone who just gets the CD is really missing out.",1079654400,19,1949,4.840361445783133

If you aren't a musician, you will love this DVD.  Blast! is a product of Drum Corps International and had it's humble birth as the Star of Indiana Drum and Bugle Corps in 1985.
I marched in the Blue Knights Drum and Bugle Corps from Denver, CO. and had the pleasure of going head to head with The Star of Indiana during the summer of 1989.  Star of Indiana went on to win the World Championship a couple of years later in 1991.
I know exactly what those musicians and dancers do to put that performance on the stage.  They work at least 14 hour days, seven days a week.  It's hard work, perfecting not only musical aspects but also the movements on the stage.  That work has paid off and the product is Blast!  I give this DVD all the recommendations I possibly can.  You will not regret this purchase.
Now, if you can't see the actual Blast! performance live, the 2002 Drum Corps season is about to kick off.  Watch for a local Drum Corps show near your home town.  They are all over the U.S.  If you can't find one, check with your local High School band instructor, they can tell you where there is one or visit [...] for a listing of competitions.  These shows are the ORIGINAL Blast!  You will be amazed at what 128 people can do with horns, drums and flags on a football field.  Oh, and not one of them is over the age of 21.  Marching band pails in comparison to Drum Corps!  From what I could tell, every member of Blast! had Drum Corps exerience.

That is such limited praise that it almost insults the performers. Truth is, Blast! cuts across all lines of musicianship -- and nonmusicianship. I took my parents, my wife, and my 4-year old daughter (none of whom can toot a single note) to see the mini-version at Disney's California Adventure (Bolero, Land of Make Believe, Malaguena), and they were blown away.
When we got home, I rented the DVD, and my daughter was up and dancing around throughout most of it. She told me afterward that she wants ""to play a horn like that."" Later she confided that she wanted to learn to ""play the drums like that,"" too. I suppose there is little praise that is higher than that. To inspire another to take up the art that you have just presented.
Get this DVD. When the touring company comes to your town (or nearby), go see it. You and your nonmusician friends and family will not be disappointed.
So, why just four stars? I tive the performance 5 stars and more. The DVD lacks in sufficient special features. The insightful commentary track covers just 4 numbers out of 20. The ""Making of Blast"" featurette is better than most that you find on movie DVDs. There are more interviews with the performers here.

1383618,5,B00004ZB6M,"I have seen Blast both live and on video.  I went with several members of my chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi, the national honorary band fraternity.  As a marching band member in my 7th year of marching since high school, I was in complete awe over the musicianship and artistry of the show.  I saw them in St. Louis last fall, and was suprised at both the performers' talent and how down to earth they are.  They came out into the lobby after the performance and talked to people.  I even tried unsuccessfully to recruit one of the drummers for our drumline (we are seriously lacking in marching drummers at my school.)
Blast can be seen as a positive influence on marching band members of any age.  Seeing their talent and artistry reminds us to strive to achieve our highest level of performance.  The performers draw the audience into the show and keep them in their grasp until well after the final note is played.  The live version is especially powerful, as there are pieces where the cast members are performing in the audience.  The influence could be seen on our marching band last fall, since our performance of ""Officer Krupke"" was one of the best pieces we performed last season.
I would recommend this show to anyone, especially band members who are not quite sure how much influence they can have on their audience, as well as anyone looking for a totally original and exciting experience.",1018915200,,1399,4.631578947368421

It would be destined to be its own The Music Man someday if it had even a thin, yet adaptive, storyline of boy-meets-girl, perhaps starring Kevin Bacon's third nephew and with a newly discovered ingenue a la West Side Story. If filmed in DV QuickTime on location in West Baden (Baden-Baden) it would be an ideal premiere at the Heartland Film Festival...(as a putative Cook/Disney production) celebrating a medley of mostly American music in the classical spirit of Fantasia and Allegro Non Troppo.",1015200000,,619,5.078431372549019
1383620,5,B00004ZB6M,"I am a high school student who is very involved in the band and choir. I know what it takes me be a good musician and the amount of work required for putting on a good show (I'm involved in the marching band). The musicians in Blast are some of the most talented people that I have ever seen perform. Their show is perfect in almost every way! Their movements are perfectly together, their musicianship is wonderful and the flag line is spectacular. This cast performs beautifully and the show is amazing. I've seen the movie countless times, and just last night I saw the show in person. I went expecting this to be one of the most wonderful things I had ever seen, and it was everything I expected and more! It absolutely took my breath away! These people are very talented and it is worth every cent you pay. I almost paid [a lot] for the DVD at the show last night, but I knew one of my friends had purchased it through Amazon for less ... This is a magnificent display of their talent and very awe-inspiring. I recommend it 100%.",1014854400,,1034,4.335051546391752

The performers just look like they are having so much fun  you can't help but get pulled into the show.  The use of tried and true DCI material (Malaguena, Bolero, Appalachian Spring) blends well with the eccentric material that Star of Indiana relied upon (Medea, Pines of Rome) and with the more original material such as Lemon Techo.",1014336000,,440,4.4625

The show is packed with amazing music, depicted from the old DCI group Star of Indiana. This DVD is fun to watch for everyone, even people who have never been involved in music. Every type of person can be amazed with the color guard, impressive horns, and(my favorite)the drums. Not only do they play good music, the visuals are also fantastic. So, i suggest you give some serious thouhgt to buying this dvd.",1012348800,,585,4.518867924528302

The only problem, for me was it could have been expanded for several hours at that pace.  I enjoyed every minute.  I can't  think of anyone alive that would not be thrilled by this  show.  I kept wondering how they found such multi talented kids (each is a jem on their own)  The making of Shout helped answer this and showed the devotion of each  cast member and everyone else involved in this knockout production",1010534400,,515,4.510869565217392
1383626,4,B00004ZB6M,"Obviously, this is no substitute to seeing Blast performed live. However, it's as close as you're going to get. As a high school mucisian in a marching band, Blast obviously has a different effect and a different meaning to me altogether. I'm not saying that there is anyone out there who wouldn't enjoy this- which is definately not the case. Blast is a wonderful representation of the childlike joys we feel from seeing big shiny instruments and bright colors as well as from hearing loud drums and pretty music. It brings out the toddler in all of us (in all the best possible ways, of course). Blast's combination of gorgeous colors and beautiful music will make anyone want to get up and dance and play along with the performers.",1008547200,2,734,4.6976744186046515

I absolutely loved this show.  knowing how difficult it is to march and perform a 20 min performance, it is even more amazing to see these people do so much more for 2 hours.  There's nothing else i can say, except the title of this review, WOW!!!!",1008374400,,375,3.9466666666666668

Blast was a amazing show and for me it symbolizes the way life used to be, all happy and good, filled with bright colors and different moods. I was so amazed by the show that I bought the DVD and have watched it every single day since then! This is no lie. I highly recomend this DVD to everyone, it's great.",1005091200,,402,4.10126582278481
1383630,5,B00004ZB6M,"Awesome!  The energy of the performance pours through the television enabling the viewer to absorb the emotions the music evokes.  The musicianship is astounding.  One of my personal favorites is ""Loss"".  The first time I heard it I almost cried with the clarity of the artists' rendition of this moving piece.  The show's finale, ""Malaguena,"" will make you unsure if your heart should stop from the exertion or race to keep up with the action! Make sure to watch the documentary following the show.",1001808000,3,499,4.892857142857143

1383632,5,B00004ZB6M,"Score one for Amazon's ""people who like this also like..."" feature!  I'd never heard of ""Blast!"", but upon ordering ""Stomp Out Loud"" it was recommended, and I clicked.  I'm glad I did!
I do think that people who enjoyed ""Stomp"" will love ""Blast!"", but that doesn't mean that this show is a clone of Stomp by any means!
While boasting its fair share of excellent percussion, ""Blast!"" is much grander in staging and more of a melodic experience (with fabulous music choices) than the pure rhythmic blitzkrieg of ""Stomp"".  I also doubt very much that you'll see a trombone player on a unicycle in Stomp anytime soon...
The staging and choreography are creative, flawlessly executed, and well-photographed.  The musicianship is outstanding (and all the more astonishing given the complexity of the choreography), the musical choices and arrangements are delightful, and the sound reproduction on the DVD is first-rate.  Fans of brass instruments will especially appreciate this disc.

1383636,4,B00004ZB6M,I just saw the show on Broadway and was blown away.  The live performance has more impact than the recording but the recording is still very good.  In NY I bought the DVD during intermission for $30 not knowing it was avaiable on-line.  Also the recording is for the London performance and there are some differences.  A fantastic live show and a great recording.  See it if you can.,991612800,,383,4.492753623188406
1383637,5,B00004ZB6M,"My first experience with Drum Corps was back in 1996, and the first corps I saw were the Madison Scouts.  Now, the opener and closer of this DVD, Bolero and Malaguea, respectively, totally brought me back to that day when I first saw the corps.  These two performances are only smidgens of the true Blast! experience.
In a spectacle that brings together Star of Indiana's Brass Theatre in a whole new light, one will find themselves laughing, as well as being emotionally drawn out by the wonderful solos and performances by the actors.  If you've ever marched or followed corps I'm sure you'll see familiar faces.  I did, saw Andy Smart, former drum major for the Blue Knights.  That was a great sight for me because I loved my time with the corps.
This DVD is well worth every dime I've spent on it, and in the three days I've had it it's been viewed 7 times.  It's like there's a new goal in life for me, to partake in this experience, not as a viewer, but as a performer.  Thanks Star and Blast!",989712000,6,999,4.396739130434782

They've mixed it in Dolby 5.1, the sound on the DVD is awesome.  They were careful about the sound levels, so that the soft parts were soft - the loud parts loud - with no clipping (over loudness).  This release really shows off the DVD's capabilities.
The picture is FABULOUS! None of the VHS tape limitations on quality are evident.  It is crisp and superb!
The behind the scenes special feature is very interesting.  As a musician, I appreciate ALL of the technical things that the performers exhibit while on stage.

The performers (musicians and dancers alike) have an energy and spirit which is hard to capture fully on television or video. Although the VHS is nothing like the show, it is the very next best thing (still better than ANYTHING you will ever see again) and well worth buying. Sadly, as I live in the UK, I cannot watch this version of the show on my VCR. My only hope would be a DVD release, as I have a multi-region DVD player.
