8738173,1,B0176IEP40,Ok. Beautiful scenery and great shots of the animals but story is awful. Take the typical Disney storyline of killing off mom in the first couple minutes and the orphan surviving and put it to lame narrative. Adult comments make in inappropriate for children and the forced drama is basically political propaganda think disguised. There are much better options to learn and appreciate the animals and Africa wilds.,1535932800,,414,5.102941176470588
8738174,5,B0176IEP40,"Terrific film. Thank goodness this exists. This close cousin is nearly extinct and this is a great introduction for the whole family to learn about a rare and amazing creature that offers intimate insights into human nature. The film is sort of ""Disney-ish"" cute and not heavy on our understanding of the scientific details about this cousin, but that works okay.

 It is certainly safe for any family to show the children. The famous sexuality of bonobos is not emphasized and is not at all necessary for the story being told here. Nothing graphic is shown and discrete terms like ""making love"" are thrown in, and kids should not have too many questions about that. Adults can get more explicit information elsewhere.

Some excellent photography for a change. Bonobos in nature are not well photographed in other film clips. One interesting thing I have not seen elsewhere is a lot of shots of bonobos standing and walking on two feet like humans. We know this is true from the written literature and I have seen a few short video clips and in zoos. But some of the shots here are really good.

All this aside, the well-run bonobo rescue program in the Congo is well described. They deserve prizes for the critically important work that they have been doing! Do watch the extra features, especially the interview with the woman who set up the rescue program. What a fine lady!",1495497600,,1377,4.725
8738175,5,B0176IEP40,"Absolutely love this movie! Beni and all of the other bonobos are such amazing, adorable, intelligent beings. Seeing the way that these lesser-known cousins of chimpanzees behave and think is fascinating. We could all learn a thing or two about life from watching them.",1493078400,,269,5.136363636363637
8738176,5,B0176IEP40,"I teach the novel Endangered by Eliot Schrefer and this movie is a perfect addition to my unit.  Movie is well done, and informative.",1474675200,,133,4.541666666666667
8738177,5,B0176IEP40,"Love for Bonobos passes from the DVD to the viewer. You will not be disappointed with DVD.
You will enjoy this DVD because it inspires the heart and soul.' It will be a valuable DVD to
watch over and over again.",1471392000,3,211,4.170731707317073
8738178,5,B0176IEP40,"This film is exquisite. The sensitivity in which Alan Tixier Directs is unmissable. The story of ""Benni"", a bonobo who is in captivity and is then rescued and taken to the Lola Ya Bonobo Sanctuary is heart breaking. The horror of the human condition is distressing but the rehabilitation heartening. It is the bonobos themselves that steal the show their loving and harmonious nature with such focus on nurturing their infants makes you question what happened to humans. And it's funny too! Bonobos are so like humans is quite unbelievable, it's like watching a group of children play with each other.",1461542400,4,601,4.96039603960396
