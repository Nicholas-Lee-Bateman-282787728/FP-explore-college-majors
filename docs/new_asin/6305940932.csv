1093263,4,6305940932,"The Little Mermaid revisited more than 10 years later....Ariel has a daughter, Melody, who has no knowledge of her mom's mermaid ancestry.  Melody  yearns for the sea in the same way that her mom longed for land.  This eventually leads to a new flip side version of the original  ""Little Mermaid"" when Morgana (the just as evil but thinner  sister of Ursula - both voiced by the deliciously whiskey voiced Pat  Carroll) hatches a sheme to enchant Melody into a mermaid as revenge  against Ariel....
Surprisingly, this made for video sequel is not too  bad.  It helps that many pf the original actors came back to reprise their  roles.  A good sequel, especially for the younger set.",964483200,83,682,4.743589743589744
1093264,4,6305940932,"It was 1989 when Disney Pictures reinvented, once again and quite succesfuly, the animation motion pictures. The storyline, the technique and the music made ""The Little Mermaid"" an enjoyable film for both  young and adult. Everything that has come since then is obviuously modeled  after that (Disney and non-Disney). In this follow up, produced  especifically for Video and DVD, the much beloved characters are back (and  not in the much inferior TV-Show version), many of them with their original  voices: Jodi Benson as Ariel and Samuel E. Wright as Sebastian.  The DVD  version is obviously the best option, considering the high quality of  earlier Disney animated DVD releases such as ""Tarzan"" or ""A  Bug's Life"". Four new songs and a new version of ""Part of Your  World"", that will play homage to the original music composed by Alan  Menken and late Howard Ashman.",962582400,29,870,5.013986013986014

1093635,3,6305940932,"I didn't particularly care for this sequel.  I didn't expect it to live up to the original but the story just felt extra cheesy and the characters we're underdeveloped.

It was okay to watch with the kids but I wouldn't say it has that much rewatch value unless your kids are 7 or younger or you just can't get enough of the Little Mermaid series.",1488240000,,457,4.617283950617284

1093865,4,6305940932,"While not as good of a movie as the original Little Mermaid, it runs circles around that prequel movie I bought last week. The prequel movie had horrible choices and music. in fact it has very little music at all. This one does a much better job musically. No it isn't as good as the original as I said but that's kind of hard to top. Still a good movie though. Very enjoyable. It's good to see Ariel again.

This opinion is 100% my own and not the result of a head injury or alien mind control. I am not beholden to anyone to write an awesome review. I was in no way compensated for what you have just read. I pride myself in being as honest and as objective as possible. I want to assure you that I've tested this product out thoroughly and everything I write in my reviews, be it good or bad, is my 100% honest opinion about the product. No animals were harmed in the making of this review. If you like my review, I like you back.

My experience has been that the second movie is never as good as the first, in fact, we typically don't even see the second ones when they come out.

But The Little Mermaid II was different.  This was a very cute story that is a continuation of the first movie.  Eric and Ariel are all grown up and have a daughter of their own.  She struggles in many ways the same way her mother did in the first with wanting freedom and exploring but wanting to go to the ocean.

The graphics are very well done and the music is very cute.  The story line is a  well written Disney storyline.  We all sat and watched it together and my son, when it was over, said ""that was great.""  I am glad we went ahead and bought this on Amazon so that my kids can watch it whenever they want.

1094604,3,6305940932,"Of course if you're familiar with this movie, then you know exactly what it's about. If you're not familiar with this movie, it's about Ariel's daughter's adventures in the sea! Everyone that's a Little Mermaid fan should take a look at this movie!

I took 2 stars off because: 1.) The audio menu doesn't work. It's listed as an option in the setup of the movie, but it loops me back to the main menu. There is no audio menu, even though it's in the menu. It must have been left out. 2.) Scene selection option also doesn't work. Same thing as the audio options menu.

The only thing you can basically do with this movie, is just press play, because even though the menu has other options, none of them exist on this disc. I would've liked to have watched this movie in Spanish audio, but I can't. So for those who only care to just play the movie, this is perfect. If you want a working menu, this is not so perfect.",1424304000,2,917,4.264367816091954

1094684,1,6305940932,"A cheap, ill conceived knockoff of the original movie.  They even recycle various parts of the original plot!  And still managed to get it all wrong.  How's that for bad luck and abject stupidity.  Adding insult to injury, they included a subpar rendition of Part Of Your World poorly sung during the closing credits!!!

There is no justification for producing something this poorly made.  The plot features a pouty disobedient princess who collects stuff from the sea and yearns to be all wet.  She runs away, acquires a couple of lame sidekicks, and becomes a sneak thief, easily duped by a thin version of Ursula the sea witch (voiced by Pat Carroll).  This snotty little princess wants a tail instead of legs.

In a word......dreadful.  I cringed all the way through it, desperately hoping it would get better instead of worse.  Unfortunately, it only got worse.  A waste of money (mine, for buying this garbage) and time (mine again, wasted watching this dreck).
I expect an apology but I know there isn't shame enough for these filmmakers to own up to their fraud.  The things people will do for filthy lucre!",1419811200,,1115,4.774869109947644

1095471,3,6305940932,"The low-budget sequel to Little Mermaid left much to be desired. My 4 year old could barely get through it. The characters are forgettable, the songs are poorly written, and the plot is boring. Atlantica and the sea look empty. Animation is inconsistent and sometimes the characters look like they were drawn by different companies. A few original characters have cameo appearances but no bearing on the story. The motivation here is Melody's longing for the sea and her relationship with her mother, but we just don't get enough development on that. Rent if you must, but your kid will probably be asking to watch the original afterwards.",1388188800,,639,4.925925925925926

All of the loveable characters from the first one are back and now Ariel has a daughter who yearns for the sea as much as Ariel yearned for land. Ursula's sister plays the role of the villain this time as Ariel's daughter goes on a journey to find her independence and figure out her mother's past.

I don't know why people are bashing on the plot of the movie. It's everything you would expect from a Disney movie- kind of predictable with a feel-good ending. It's not as good as the first one, but it's still worth watching.",1385424000,2,659,4.306451612903226

Just seeing the movie was just painful to see.  The plot is just like the little mermaid but the opposite direction.  Part of the problems with this story is the background is week the villian is a spitting image of the villian in the original.  This movie is a waste of you money.  If you own it dump it.  If you think about buying it don't.  It is just plain utter trash of movie.

1096196,5,6305940932,"The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea is a 2000 sequel to the 1989 Disney animated  box office hit. In Part II, which takes place a couple of years after the events in the original movie, Princess Ariel, the former mermaid now human, marries Prince Eric and gave birth to a beautiful daughter named Melody. As the years went by, Melody is curious about the seas, but Ariel is keeping Melody's mermaid heritage a secret. One day, Melody is visited by a octopus-like sea-witch named Morgana, who just happened to be the sister of the now-deceased Ursula, offers Melody a chance to be a mermaid-for a price. When Melody ends up in danger, it's up to Ariel, as she changes to mermaid form, and her undersea friends to save Melody before it's too late. The special features includes a deleted musical number featuring Morgana, a interactive mermaid adventure game, a classic Disney animated short featuring merbabies and more. The Little Mermaid II is one of the many Disney DVD favourites any Disney Princess fan will enjoy and get to know Melody, the daughter of Ariel!",1337126400,,1069,4.747311827956989

This movie however does a great job at regaining much of the respect I gave the first film. If you're a Disney fan debating if you should buy this movie, I would consider one thing. Would I watch this movie again? I understand it's hard to tell if you've never seen it before, but a good rule of thumb is if you love the original, you'll definitely like the sequel. It may not be the same, or live up to the original, but just seeing the story continue is worth it. The Little Mermaid was a big part of my childhood, so I didn't think twice about buying it, just so I could relive all the aspects, and events of Ariel's life. That said if you aren't the biggest fan of the Little Mermaid, and just wanted to see what the movie is about, I would rent it first. :) great movie in my opinion",1329350400,,959,4.133689839572193

1096409,5,6305940932,"I was 5 years old, almost 6, when I saw the original classic (which has remained, 20 years later, my favorite film). I watched the original many, many times first on VHS, then on DVD. And although I loved Ariel--enough to dye my hair red and get my middle name legally changed to ""Arielle"" at age 26--I never saw the draw of being human. Bullies, dry skin, yucky junk food, cold weather, a need to wear tons of bulky clothes, you get the gist. So when I saw TLM2: Return to the Sea in 11th grade...well, I automatically rooted for little Melody, as I saw so much of myself in this human girl who wanted to be a Mermaid.

True, the plot may be a bit forced, and the animation isn't quite as good as the original, but if you're someone who grew up wanting to trade places with Ariel in kindergarten through 5th grade in the early to mid 1990s--if you grew up wrapping your legs in green saran wrap during the summer--if you flung your head back in the bathtub and sang ""Part of Your World"" in the local swimming pool--this movie is for you. :D",1321056000,2,1041,4.257575757575758

1096478,4,6305940932,"The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea is one hour and seventeen minutes and was released on video on September 19, 2000. This was the direct to video sequel to The Little Mermaid. The movie opens with the celebration of the birth of Ariel and Prince Eric newborn daughter Melody. The celebration is interupted when Morgana, Ursula's sister, appears and tries to kidnap Melody, but is foil and retreats to the Antarctic region along with her sidekicks Cloak, Dagger, and Undertow. It is twelve years later and Melody's 12th birthday party. She has gone beyond the forbidding wall which was erected to protect her from Morgana. Melody finds the locket that her grandfather, King Triton, gave her when she was born. Melody confronts her mother and the two having a falling out. Melody heads out to sea on a row boat to find the answers she is looking for. Melody meets Undertow and he convinces her that Morgana has the answers she is looking for you. Cloak and Dagger tow her to Morgana's hideout and she turns Melody into a mermaid, but there is a catch, she tells her that she must retrieve the trident if she wants to remind a mermaid forever. Melody along with two new friends, Tip and Dash, go to Atlantica get the trident and return to Antarctic region. Ariel meets up with Melody and tries to explain to her the reason she was not aloud to go to the sea, but it is too late; Melody gives the trident to Morgana. With the trident in Morgana's hands she begins her brief takeover of the seas. In the end Melody retrieves the trident and King Triton encases Morgana in a block of ice and is last seen falling to the bottom of the Antarctic Ocean. As for as direct to videos goes, this is one of the better videos. Though it does not live up to its full potential. It does not have any great songs like Under the Sea and Kiss the Girl like the original Little Mermaid did and parts of the movie looks like cut and paste from the original as well. Still the Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea is an enjoyable movie and gets a B-.

1096569,1,6305940932,"This is by far the most dorky Little Mermaid movie. First off Thats great that Ariel and Eric have a daughter. Plus they made the story dorky. Ariel's sisters never show up so shouldn;t Melody have aunts? lol They could've make this movie a lot better. Plus It was all about Ariel never telling her daughter about the ocean, so this movie was super dorky",1280361600,3,354,4.461538461538462

1096571,1,6305940932,"I myself, love the first Little Mermaid. This was highly disappointing. One of the worse sequels I have seen. Maybe young, young kids will like it though. I believe Disney tried to hard to make a sequel, and it was released just for the money. The drawings looked different, the characters don't have the same lovable sound as the first one. I think they tried to hard to make it funny, it could have been so much better, or they shouldn't have made a sequel at all. Nothing compared to the fist wonderful one. Don't waste your money, rent it if you want, but it is not worth buying at all.",1277596800,2,590,4.324324324324325

1096573,3,6305940932,"At first when seeing the cover of this movie I thought "" oh no its another one of those terrible sequels"" but the thing is it has all the voices of the original characters. That is always a plus. When I hear fairy tales I think romance. But this one lacked it. Plus compared to Ariel then, her daughter who starrs in this movie is much younger and immature. The only reason why I enjoyed it because let me see Ariel and eric and all the other beloved characters from the Original The Little Mermaid. I think this is just an okay movie. It is worth to own anyways because it isn't too bad a movie. It is just not a movie you can enjoy watching over and over. The Little Mermaid had everything. This movie had one/fifth of it. But if you don't watch this, you aren't missing out because the little mermaid was complete.",1276473600,,817,4.243589743589744
1096574,1,6305940932,"If you are looking for the grace or charm tht the Little mermaid has, you won't find it here at all.

First, Ariel is a Stepford mermaid woman. She walks around with this weird look of being ""a wife"" and there is no sparkle in her anymore. She lies to her daughter about her roots, and tells her that mermaids and atlantica the home she grew  up in and of her Dad is a fairytale and not real. She severs Melody's roots from her past for what reason is not made clear. Sebastian lost his cute caribbean accent and pronounces all of his r's like an american. the whole thing is a disaster from the opening scene when morgana, ursula's sister emerges from the depths of the sea and grabs little melody from her parents. terrible.

1096576,4,6305940932,"I've loved Disney forever and I loved this sequel. The story is predictable: Morgana, Ursula's younger sister, uses Melody's desire to be a mermaid against her. Yeah, been there done that, but the animation is stunning and I love Melody's personality. She is a fun, if not gullible little thing, that the viewer will love. Ariel plays the role of the overprotective mother in this one, acting as her father Triton did in the first one, she doesn't want Melody to learn about her past in the sea. It was interesting to see the former fun-loving mermaid become a stickler for rules and I liked that because it showed Ariel's growth over time. The plot is predictable, yes, but the animation is beautiful and the mother/daughter sequences are great to see. Eric is his usual self, as stated above, where he plays the stagnant ""token"" boyfriend figure, but he maintains a fatherly influence over Melody.

1096902,3,6305940932,"I usually don't expect much from a direct-to-DVD sequel. Usually, it's just a way to give my three-year-old daughter her favorite characters without having to watch the original movie for the 3,000th time. But, The Little Mermaid II pleasantly surprised me.

The plot is basically a reverse of the original movie. After being threatened by the evil sea witch Morgana, Ariel decides it's not safe to tell her infant daughter, Melody, about her mermaid heritage. Flash forward 12 years and Ariel and Eric have built a wall around their castle to keep the pre-teen Melody from swimming out to the ocean. Of course, Melody disobeys, collects small treasures from beneath the waves and dreams of having fins. When Ariel gets wind of this, she flies off the handle and Melody runs to Morgana for help. Morgana agrees to turn her into a mermaid if she'll steal King Triton's magic trident.

Naturally, Melody gathers some cute animal sidekicks and stages a few impromptu musical numbers. While I won't be rushing out to buy the soundtrack, the music was pleasant - not memorable, but definitely hummable.

I loved that there was no romantic element to this movie. A lot of the romance in Disney films goes over my daughter's head. Toddlers are too young to be waiting for prince charming. Melody is solo throughout this movie, and there are some elements of girl power at work as Melody and Ariel come together to save the day.

Pat Carroll is back as Morgana, Ursula's tentacled sister. She was one of the best things about the original movie and she adds a wonderful quality to the sequel as well. Morgana is the best kind of Disney villian in that she sees herself as the wronged party and I found myself chuckling at some of her better lines.

The animation isn't as refined as in a big-screen feature (we're talking Saturday-morning cartoon quality art), but the story is sweet and very appropriate for small children.",1229644800,3,1916,4.793939393939394
1096903,4,6305940932,"Animated primarily in Australia and Canada, this is the second in a trilogy of Mermaid movies; the first of course, being the theatrical megahit and the other two made for home video.

Return to the Sea takes no chances with its presold audience by having the daughter of Ariel experience a similar adventure as her mother with perhaps even more intense defiance (Ariel's issue with her father in the first film is freedom, Melody's problem in this film is with Ariel's reluctance to open communication). Without dropping a spoiler, there is even a plot development quite similar to the current Broadway version that does not happen in the original film.

The wonderful Pat Carroll returns --  instead of playing Ursula, she offers a different characterization as evil sister Morgana -- along with Jodi Benson, Buddy Hackett, Kenneth Mars, Rene Auberjonois and Sam Wright. Replacing Ben Wright (who passed away in 1989), Jason Marin and Christopher Daniel Barnes are Kay Kuter, Cam Clarke and Rob Paulsen as Prince Eric,  and Flounder, respectively.

Most of all, it should be pointed out to Disney records fans that several very good friends of ""Mouse Tracks"" were involved with this film: Executive Music Producer Bambi Mo, singer Desire Goyette and songwriters Michael and Patty Silversher (who wrote all the original songs from the film, ""Down to the Sea,"" For a Moment"" and ""Here on the Land and Sea."" You can enjoy their work in the movie and also if you can get the out-of-print soundtrack CD.

The Special Edition offers the same material as the 2000 release, adding a new game called ""The Little Mermaid II Underwater Mar-Venture Challenge."" My favorite is a very nice reading of the DVD storybook by Jodi Benson.

The Little Mermaid has proven a very prolific story source. In addition to the movies and various publications, there was an animated TV series. It would be nice to see all those 31 episodes packaged for DVD too.",1229472000,2,1936,4.920245398773006

While it is clearly not as good as the original, if you have a Little Mermaid fan, they will enjoy this movie.",1229040000,,436,4.094117647058823

This sequel is being released in a 1-disc special edition. As others have noted, it is a very similar rehashing of the original tale.

Ariel & Eric are married and have a beautiful dark-haired daughter, Melody. When Ursula's evil sister, Morgana, appears on the scene, King Triton & Ariel must protect Melody by building a large wall around the castle. Forbidding Melody to enter the ocean (thus keeping her away from both Morgana and her grandfather King Triton), Ariel keeps her heritage a secret. Many years later, as a teen, Melody experiences the angst of not fitting in, and wishing she were a mermaid. Morgana seizes the opportunity to exploit Melody's sadness and convinces her to steal her Grandfather's triton stick, which would give Morgana the power over the entire sea. Can you predict the rest? Sure, it's not too difficult. Again, this is an enjoyable film.

Still, it is far above what you would typically expect of a direct-to-dvd release. Jodi Benson & Pat Carroll are back on hand to lend their vocal talents to Ariel & Morgana respectively; who else but Carroll could vocalize Ursula's sister? Sebastian and Flounder are also back for comic relief, and there are some new characters as well. Safe for children to watch, although some of the scenes with Morgana may be slightly frightening for the very young ones. Needless to say, these don't last too long!

Technical Specs:
Dolby Digital 5.1 surround for audio (movie) & 1:66:1 video enhanced for 16x9 TVs.

Extras:

* Deleted Song: ""Gonna Get My Wish."" Fun musical showcase for Morgana, explaining her quest not to be the forgotten child overshadowed by her late sister Ursula. Really not a bad number; most likely trimmed for time.

* 1938 Silly Symphony Short ""Merbabies"" (8:34). Fun musical romp under the sea that was obviously a precursor to ""Fantasia."" Ironically, this Disney short was actually farmed out to another studio. Not quite up to the quality of other Silly Symphonies.

* ""Little Mermaid II"" DVD Storybook: have the story read to you, or read it yourself. Narrated by Jodi Benson (voice of Ariel).

Games & Activities:

* ""The Little Mermaid II"" Underwater Mer-Venture Challenge Game

* ""Little Mermaid II"" Trivia Game

* ""What Am I?"" Sea Creature Game, where the answers provide brief film clips of actual sea creatures. Fun learning adventure for little ones.

None of these 3 games are really out of the ordinary, but might prove slightly amusing for the little ones.

* Sneak Peaks include upcoming 2009's ""The Princess and the Frog."" The trailer here does seem very fun and sassy; I have been anxiously awaiting this one ever since it was first announced. The setting is New Orleans during the 1920's Jazz Age, and will mark the first traditionally animated feature since 2004's ""Home on the Range.""",1228608000,9,3441,5.50853889943074
1097025,2,6305940932,"If you don't know the plot to this, but do know the plot to the original, you know the plot to this.  Melody is just a brattier clone of Ariel.  She runs off and defies her parent's wishes and asks a sea with who's half mis-colored human and half octopus and has pet eels to change her into a mermaid.  In exchange, the sea-witch with hair that's white and goes straight up pretty much just uses the kid to get Triton's trident.

Yes, it is the EXACT same thing with the love story cut out, a horrible personality replacing the loveable one, and circumstances have changed so she is never doing the right thing.

While Ariel defied her father because she had wanted to be human for so long and her father had anger issues, Melody wants to be a mermaid about 2 minutes after learning about them and won't let her mother talk.  While Ariel had the ultimatum of having to get Eric to fall in love with her while sacrificing her voice, Melody is asked to go steal straight off the bat and pretty much sacrifice nothing.  While Ariel feels sorry for hurting her father after turning human, Melody throws a huge tantrum at her mother who says she's been worried sick looking for her.  While Ariel knows its wrong to steal and told her father not to exchange places with her in Ursula's contract, Melody finds out that Triton is a nice guy, but steals the trident anyway.  While Ariel tries to fight Ursula even when Ursula has the trident, Melody's survival instincts are purely comprised of falling over and sitting where she is no matter what the villains do.

Does she learn her lesson in the end?  ...I honestly don't know.

Melody seems to exude other flaws as well.  Her voice acting is pretty bad, though everyone else's is okay.  Since most of the animation is of her, she seems pretty bad, being choppy sometimes, and just badly animated at others.  She overshadows many characters.  Eric seems oblivious to his daughter personality flaws and Ariel seems really withdrawn, most likely to not having been in the ocean for over ten years (this could have been expanded on as it was an interesting concept, but it had to make way for Melody's superfluous scenes, which is yet another flaw),  and Melody is an idiot.  You'd think Ariel and Eric's kid wouldn't be that dumb.

Lastly, the ending is Melody declining an offer from her grandfather to be a mermaid again (the mer-maid spell wore off), but instead she wants the wall between the castle and the sea that was built to keep her out of the sea and thus away from the sea-witch (it never worked) destroyed.  She couldn't have asked daddy, who had it built?  How long is this non-mermaid thing going to last, given that she'd steal for it?  Her grandfather and bother her parents are doting, implying she'll be spoiled no matter where she is.  How's the audience going to trust her?  Are they supposed to or are they supposed to embrace her bratty personality?

As a side note, where did Ariel's sister's go?  Triton was the only person at the palace and if Ariel and Triton were looking for Melody in the ocean, wouldn't her sisters want to help?",1228089600,4,3101,4.532374100719425

When I heard of ""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea"", I had to see it. I thought it would be good, but not as good as the original. Well, I was wrong. I enjoyed this movie very much and I've watched it many times. The story is similar to ""The Little Mermaid"", but not completely. I spotted many differences between ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea"".

Personality

In the original movie, Ariel is a strong-willed mermaid with a desire to live on land. She is very brave and wants to leave her home because she falls in love with Eric and is willing to do anything to be with him. She is a confident 16-year-old and very adventurous and inquisitive.

12-year-old Melody, on the other hand, is worried about not fitting in. She isn't confident in herself and worries about making a fool of herself. She is also brave and strong-willed, but feels insecure.

Storyline

In ""The Little Mermaid"", Ariel longs to be human from the very start of the movie. She has a collection of a variety of things she has found from the human world. Ariel also knows a few things about the human world, such as human beings have two legs and feet and cannot breathe underwater. And she even seeks help from Ursula, even though she is reluctant. Her love of Eric is too strong to restrain her from going to Ursula for help.

Now compare this to ""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea"". Melody knows absolutely NOTHING about her mermaid heritage. Sure, she loves the sea and prefers to spend time swimming than staying in the castle, but she doesn't even know mermaids actually exist. When she says that she sometimes pretends that she has fins, she means she pretends she's a fish. Melody doesn't run away from home to become a mermaid like Ariel does to become human. She runs away to find the meaning of the Atlantica locket, unlike Ariel, who simply left because of her love for Eric. Not only that, but Melody doesn't even know who Morgana is. Once Morgana tells Melody some of her heritage, that's when she wants to become a mermaid.

Danger

In the original movie, Ariel's love of the human world is her weakness, but the danger she's in doesn't even become clear until she falls in love with Eric. Melody was in danger from birth, which caused Ariel to forbid her to go into the sea. Not only that, but Ariel knew why her father didn't want her to interact with humans. Melody didn't have any clue as to why she wasn't allowed in the sea. When she brings the issue up with Ariel, instead of telling her, Ariel scolds her for disobeying. In my opinion, that isn't fair and Melody should know why going into the sea is forbidden along with her heritage. Melody's lack of knowledge of her mermaid inheritance is her weakness and the one person who can help her drives her away.

The movie is also realistic in a way: In the original, Ariel defies her father. In this movie, Melody does the same to her, but what does she do? She scolds Melody and refuses to answer her questions and Melody decides to trust Morgana since Ariel won't answer her questions. The point? Ariel has turned into King Triton and Melody has turned into Ariel from The Little Mermaid! And it's very natural.

Overall, ""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea"" is terrific! It's even a bit more realistic than ""The Little Mermaid"". Don't let the negative reviews give you the wrong opinion. Watch it for yourself and see!",1210377600,,3562,4.508527131782945

The music stinks. I understand that for straight-to-video movies they aren't going to hire the big guns to come in and compose an Oscar worthy score, but really, a child could have written better music and more imaginative lyrics. Even children aren't going to take the songs seriously, they are that bad.

The wall thing was stupid, Ariel was almost senile wondering around the castle not knowing where the heck her brat is! Flounder is old and fat, and Prince Eric is a drain on society.

Melody is an ungrateful brat and if my daughter were like her, I would smack her silly. There are far better teenage girl role models who do not fit in that are way more pleasant than she is.

Then we also have the cheap token Timon and Pumbaa pair with the penguin and the walrus.

1097275,4,6305940932,"""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea"" met my expectations for a direct-to-video film. It did not exceed them nor did they fall short. The 1989 original THE LITTLE MERMAID is a very formidable film, making the artistic success for a sequel a great challenge. To its credit ""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea"" did unfold in a different direction than I had anticipated. The story was not innovative but some of the particular plot situations were well thought out. In any story you have conflict and resolution and those are the aspects that I liked about this film. Some of the dramatics did rely on prior events, which took place in the original. That was thematically important to the overall story. One weakness of this film was the lack of character development. Character development was one of the strong points of THE LITTLE MERMAID. I watched ""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea"" twice trying to determine if the film digressed in such a way to bolster my contention of this. What did the ""The Little Mermaid"" achieve in roughly the same amount of time that this film didn't? And then it struck me that it was the music or more specifically the songs in the original that advanced the story line and defined the characters. That was the brilliance of lyricist Howard Ashman. He and composer Alan Menken developed songs in the original that in several minutes clearly defined Ariel's reckless but innocent curiosity about the humans above and her yearning to discover that world. Every song in the original bolstered the characters, advanced the plot or enhanced the significance of a scene in addition to being very melodic and well written. So in THE LITTLE MERMAID we were given a substantial amount of information and entertainment in a minimum amount of time. There is not a single frame of wasted footage in that film. ""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea"" does not have the advantage of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman compositions. The instrumental score is very good but the new songs feel superficial. The animation especially during the underwater scenes is good. Morgana is not as menacing as her sister Ursula was in the original. Other than Ursula I believe all the main characters are back. Melody, Ariel's daughter gets to mingle with the old characters as well as meet new ones. I thought that was significant seeing that the scriptwriters were determined not to have Melody just copy what Ariel did in the original. It would have been a very good sequel for theatrical release. If that was done, there would have been a bigger budget and the various shortcomings could have been corrected. I liked ""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea"" but I did not feel it was as good as Disney's other direct-to-video, ""Pocahontas II."" However, I believe that ""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea"" will have a definite audience with younger family members and there are actually some nostalgic moments that will no doubt attract teens and up who loved the original. I highly recommend this movie.",1159747200,,3037,4.786666666666667

*** This comment may contain spoilers ***

The Little Mermaid is one of my absolute favorite Disney movies. I'm sorry to say, however, that Disney completely messed up when they made this sequel. I'll admit it has some good points to it. The songs aren't bad, and the animation is clean and clear. There is some humor, I'm sure--I don't remember, because after watching it I immediately banned it from appearing before my eyes again. The worst point of this movie is the plot. In this movie, Ariel becomes her father. She forbids her daughter to go near the sea (yes, out of fear), just as she was forbidden to go near the land. I personally think that, given her past, Ariel would maintain some of her headstrong ways and not treat her daughter like she herself was treated.

Besides this fact, Ursula was replaced by a non-scary, pathetic sort of sea witch (the underfed, forgotten sister) who is more comical than scary. She, too, has some little underling to do her bidding--but she's not scarier or worse than Ursula. Ursula spoiled us with her believability for badness. This sea witch is a joke.

To make matters worse, Flounder is a fat, deep-voiced father (no longer the cute guppy we all know and love) and Eric's voice is not even done by the same actor (something that always annoys me in a remake/sequel). (His voice difference was very obvious to me, by the way!) I felt that the only reason this movie was made was so that Disney could catch a few fast dollars, something I hate to think about a corporation I actually really do enjoy. I felt that this plot lacked imagination. I know that this act (child following in the footsteps of a parent) happens, but Ariel was different. That was what we loved so much about her. She had a dream, she fell in love, and she made that dream come true. Until she appeared in this movie, that is. Then she became just like the other adults. This isn't the Ariel I know. And I don't like her.

I know of some children who have enjoyed this film, and I know some adults who didn't mind it, either. But for me, and for all of you out there who have the utmost love for Ariel, please don't see this movie. The Ariel we know dies within, resurrected only for a song or two and one final scene that actually isn't TOO horrible (where she accepts the water back again)--although she takes very little part in the ending, regardless.",1152921600,8,2402,4.4874141876430205
1097277,4,6305940932,"You know those sequels that are even better than the original?  The Little Mermaid II is not one of them.  You know those sequels that are thrown together and so bad that they leave an awful taste in your mouth, even regarding the original?  It is not one of those either.  What this movie is is lovingly crafted, well-thought out, and a nice effort.

The story takes place twelve years after the Little Mermaid became a human, vanquished Ursula the Sea Witch, and married the man of her dreams.  Eric and Ariel have a willful pre-teen named Melody.  Melody is drawn to the sea, and can talk to sea creatures.  She is awkward around other children, who snigger at Melody at her birthday party.  However, Melody cannot confide in her mother - because Melody does not know her mermaid heritage.  Ursula's sister Morgana (a green, slimmer version of the original) wants to change all that.  Morgana wants to use Melody to get King Triton's trident.

The animation is decent, but does not have the depth and clarity of the 1992 film.  Yet it is enjoyable.  The songs are clever, but not showstopping as the originals.  But they are very good.  One thing that is better than the original is the humor.  Sebastian is even funnier than before.  Tip and Dash, a walrus and penguin, are also hilarious.  I laughed out loud a lot.

 About melodies decisions when her mom told her to give her back that tridant she gave it to Ursulas sister. How could you not trust your own mother like that? And then King tridant is not evil looking and he is the king and the merpeople are all happy so why was she stupid enough to believe Ursulas' sister when it was obvious that she was lying. They just should have made melody more intelligent.

 Then like I said before the story plot just really sucks. It was a short and boring movie. They should have had way more adventure in it and some other problem besides Ursulas sister.

 Another thing that bothered me was the voice of Eric! He sounded really gay! I hated it. The whole movie just sucked really bad. The first little mermaid was so awesome and this movie just destroyed the whole ariel and eric relationship too. It just did not seem to fit.

1097372,5,6305940932,"I for one loved this movie and didn't compare it to the original. I loved the Lion King 2 (Simba's Pride) and didn't compare that one to the first one. I adore the Rescuers Down Under, but its not the same as the first one. And the sequel to Lady and the Tramp? I liked that one too. Yes, there are going to be changes when one waits years to make a sequel. I love the sequels for being movies in their own right. By the way, I am almost 22 years old and remember the first Little Mermaid very well. I've grown up on Disney, and out of the forty dvds I own, 80% of them are Disney.

Anyway, the Little Mermaid 2 is a great movie. The animation is even clearer and more beautiful than the first one, due to the changes in technology over the last decade, and the songs are just as catchy and fun. In fact, I watched it a few days ago and still have ""Tip and Dash"" stuck in my head. In my opinion, Disney did a great job with the story itself, making it believable and moving. The actors and actresses all give their best and it shows in the emotion the characters display. Melody is exactly what you would expect a lonely preteen princess to be--tortured by her secret desires and her need to fit in, yet her seeming inability to do so. And like all kids that age, she is convinced that she is the only one who could possibly feel this way and brushes off her mother's attempts to cheer her up with edited stories of her own childhood. She creates a situation and has to deal with the repercussions, and does so very well.

Jodi Benson proves once again that she is the only woman who could play the part of Ariel. Reprising her role from so many years ago, she now plays the part of the older, wiser, more mature mermaid-turned human, and does it perfectly. In addition to dealing with Melody's preteen anxieties, Ariel has to contend with her own feelings of loneliness and helplessness, as her years as a human and the wall that separates the castle from the sea also separates her from her family. There is a very poignant scene in which Ariel wades in the water behind the wall, just to feel the water again and to remember her life before. It moves me every time.

Eric gets a lot of screen time in this one, but he doesn't speak as much and really just stands off to the side, silently offering encouragement. He doesn't act as a prince, but a father concerned with the well-being of his only daughter and a husband worried about his wife's happiness. I don't think his voice actor is the same as in the first one. Triton's either.

I've rambled on long enough. I just want everyone to watch this movie and decide for yourselves if you like it or not. But please, don't compare it to the original. Just as younger siblings hate being compared to their older brothers and sisters, and children dislike being forced to follow in the path of their parents, so too are sequels not meant to be the exact replicas of the original films. Give the Little Mermaid 2 a chance to stand on its own.",1107388800,8,2992,4.280918727915195
1097373,2,6305940932,"O Disney, what's happened to you? You used to produce enchanting, heart-warming animated films that were loved by both children AND adults. They had beautiful musical scores, wonderful songs, great characters, and the best animation quality and style in the world. And then something strange happened. You started to make less impressive animated films that still had brilliant animation, but lacked both interesting characters and good music, and possessed storylines of a more politically correct nature. I'm talking about films like Mulan, Lilo and Stitch, and Brother Bear. None of these films are bad by any means, but this is not the same ""Disney Magic"" I saw in movies like The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast. Disney's last few animated movies seem more like big apologies for putting so many white people in their fairy tales, rather than good stories that deserve to be told.

Then there's stuff like Little Mermaid 2: Return to the Sea, which is a cash grab by Disney and nothing more (just like the sequels to Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, etc). There is absolutely no reason for this movie to have been made other than to make parents part with some of their hard-earned money because their kids succumbed to the advertising. The animation is straight-to-video quality, the songs are uninspired, and the story is almost a complete copy of the original! Please, please, DON'T buy this movie! Turning out sequel after sequel to a beloved movie to make some easy money is a terrible way for a studio to operate, and the fact that the studio is Disney in this case just goes to prove that somebody in a high-level position at Disney has no idea what made their company so loved and admired in the first place!

A few months ago Disney announced that they were closing their feature-length animation studios. This is truly sad. If Disney had ignored the shrill naysayers of the world and kept on making high-quality animated films that people actually wanted to see and could care about, instead of pouring money into lame, preachy movies like Brother Bear, this wouldn't have happened.

1097454,2,6305940932,"Trying to make a sequel to the masterpiece that is The Little Mermaid was unlikely to work in the first place. The Little Mermaid stands out as one of the greatest animated movies ever, and certainly has some of the best music. This sequel falls short on many levels, especially music, and Melody is a big disappointment to those of us who appreciated how beautiful Ariel was. Melody's story is her mother's in reverse; she wants to be a mermaid, not a human. Morgana is just like Ursula, though she and Undertow the shark/piranha and Cloak/Dagger the manta rays are pretty funny. Ariel is a mother now and a kind of ""blah"" character. She isn't completely ruined, like Tramp or Simba, because at first she wants to share her past life with her daughter. It's Morgana's threat that causes her to hide Melody from the sea, King Triton, etc., and contain her within walls. Still, she and the Prince act very sterotypically in this movie and lack real character. Sebastian is back, luckily. Titanic Tip the penguin and Daring Dash the walrus--two young wannabe heroes who befriend and assist Melody--are an attempt at an arctic-dwelling Timon and Pumbaa. They're the comic relief and the silliness. Tip is Timon, the little wisecracker, and Dash is Pumbaa, the big, not-too-bright old soft guy. I see the relation here quite clearly. At any rate, this movie isn't too awful to watch on occasion, but do not expect the glory of the original Little Mermaid. I think this story could have been made into a much more decent film, had they left out some of the things that added to its corny/cheesy factor. For instance, how many times do we want to hear a parent say, ""You deliberately disobeyed me""? That was ripped right from the Lion King (the only film in which it sounded sincere), and Jungle Book 2 also ripped it straight from there. Aren't there other, less cliche things to say to get the same point across? The ending is also a cliffhanger; Melody uses the trident to disapparate the wall, and everyone--humans and merpeople--join together in song and merriment. But then what? Does Melody choose to remain on land or at sea? We assume on land, but it's unclear. Either way, mysterious fates and endings can be very good, and it's not like most people will care one way or the other about Melody. So on the whole, it's worth seeing IF you enjoy animated movies and the first Little Mermaid, but won't be too touchy about a sequel that doesn't live up. Otherwise, I'd steer clear.",1093132800,15,2481,4.679633867276888
1097455,4,6305940932,"Obviously, the sequel isn't going to be as good as the first.  They never are.  This is no different, the storyline is similar with all the characters resembling each other as well.  Basically, Melody is Ariel, only in a much younger perspective wanting to be a mermaid (just like Ariel wanted to be a human in the first), Morgana is Ursula, only skinnier with her pet shark who is the eels.  Tip and Dash are basically Flounder and Sebastian.  I enjoyed Tip and Dash a lot, especially compared to the annoying Flounder.  All the original characters make appearances, Sebastian is the crap that used to look after Ariel for King Tritan but now he's supposed to look over Melody for Ariel and Eric.  Flounder is still around, yet fatter and his voice is more annoying, King Triton is now the worried grandfather instead of just the worried father.  The real downfall here is Prince Eric, who is rarely in the movie but his voice is different and for the worst.  He looks a bit different too, he has like blue eyes in this one which makes him look strange.
The storyline as I said is similar.  Melody wants to explore the sea, she's an OUTCAST on land and SNEAKS out by going under the wall between the castle and the ocean.  She meets Morgana, an EVIL OCTOPUS who has the POWER to TRANSFORM her into a mermaid (hint: with help from Ursula) and she can REMAIN a MERMAID if she STEALS the ""pitchfork"" (sorry I forget its name) from her grandfather, yet she doesn't know he's her grandfather.  Melody captures it with the help of Tip and Dash and returns to Morgana.  All the while Ariel has transformed back into a mermaid in hope to find Melody in the sea while Eric looks on land.  Morgana TURNS on Melody and transforms her back into a human and keeps her underwater until she drowns.  The shark crashes into the ice barrier and Melody is free, Ariel and Melody chat then realize that Eric and the rest of them are in trouble.  Melody saves the day.  That is basically the whole storyline.
Though very similar to the first one, this is still a good watch and would be a nice movie to show your little kids, especially since they probably wouldn't care if the first one is the original.  It's a fun movie, not as romantic or as funny as the first but still fun.  If you collect Disney movies or really enjoyed this one if you saw it, buy it.

The only thing pleasing (and, I must say, humorous) was the presence of Sebastian.  He alone retained the charm of the first film.

Okay, as a long time Disney fan, I really -hate- direct-to-video Disney sequels. Walt HIMSELF didn't believe in them. He believed in ""AND THEY LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER"" being the end of it. But this one...REALLY ticked the taco. There were so many ripoffs of other Disney films in this, it wasn't funny. Quick summary, if you don't already know...: Melody, the daughter of Ariel and Prince Eric, is born. Ursula's sister, Morganna (who basically looks like Ursula, if she were to dye herself green and go on the Ally Macbeal starvation diet) shows up and, after trying to do the newborn tyke in, and failing, prophesizes (sp?) doom for the characters. After that ordeal, Ariel goes into a lapse of being like her father, and refuses to tell Melody about her mermaid heritage, and later on, forbids her to go near the sea. Well surprise surprise. Melody finds out, being the stubborn brat she is, and runs away, then makes a deal with Morgana to become a mermaid, in exchange for something. (Gee does THAT sound familiar?) She becomes one, but in her half of the bargain, has to retrieve her granddaddy's Trident and bring it back to the sea witch. While doing THIS, she runs into a couple of outcast animals, a penguin and a walrus named Timon and Pumb--huh? wait...no! that's not Timon and Pumbaa! or is it? Could of fooled me. Anyway, i'd like to reveal more, but pretty much anything that could be guessed to happen does. OK so...long story short. This movie ""borrows"" too much from other (better) Disney films...and does it horribly. Come on...Tip and Dash? Why not just make Dash obscenely flatulent and make it an even more obvious ripoff! Ugh. Not to mention, the total character butchery of Ariel's persona. She's gone from being a freespirited, headstrong woman, to a clone of her father. Not good at all...they're basically telling us the sweet, firey little mermaid we've known to grow and love is dead. Plus Melody herself isn't such a great character either...she's damned annoying! And bratty! Not to mention what they've done to Flounder. Ugh...anyway if you decide to see this piece of created-mainly-for-profit-reasons, no-imagination, Eisner-sponsored crapfest, I suggest maybe waiting 'till its on the Disney channel or some other tv station.

Morgana wasn't as scary as Ursula, but she won't give the kids nightmares like Ursula did either. Very well done for an immediate production to video/DVD release.",1035244800,2,629,4.833333333333333
1097722,4,6305940932,"THE LITTLE MERMAID II: RETURN TO THE SEA met my expectations for a direct-to-video film. It did not exceed them. Nor did they fall short. The 1989 original THE LITTLE MERMAID is a very formidable film, making the artistic success for a sequel a great challenge. To its credit THE LITTLE MERMAID II: RETURN TO THE SEA does unfold in a different direction than I had anticipated. The story is not entirely innovative but some of the particular plot situations were well thought out. In any story you have conflict and resolution and those are the aspects that I liked about this film. Some of the dramatics did rely on prior events, which took place in the original. That was thematically important to the overall story. One weakness of this film is the lack of character development. Character development was one of the strong points of THE LITTLE MERMAID. I watched THE LITTLE MERMAID II: RETURN TO THE SEA twice trying to determine if the film digressed in such a way to bolster my contention of this. What did THE LITTLE MERMAID achieve in roughly the same amount of time that this film didn't? And then it struck me that it was the music or more specifically the songs in the original that advanced the story line and defined the characters. That was the brilliance of lyricist Howard Ashman. He and composer Alan Menken developed songs in the original that in several minutes clearly defined Ariel's reckless but innocent curiosity about the humans above and her yearning to discover that world. Every song in the original bolstered the characters, advanced the plot or enhanced the significance of a scene in addition to being very melodic and well written. So in THE LITTLE MERMAID we were given a substantial amount of information and entertainment in a minimum amount of time. There is not a single frame of wasted footage in that film. THE LITTLE MERMAID II: RETURN TO THE SEA does not have the advantage of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman compositions. The instrumental score is very good but the new songs feel superficial. The animation especially during the underwater scenes is good. Morgana is not as menacing as her sister Ursula was in the original. Other than Ursula I believe all the main characters are back. Melody, Ariel's daughter gets to mingle with the old characters as well as meet new ones. I thought that was significant seeing that the scriptwriters were determined not to have Melody just copy what Ariel did in the original. It would have been a very good sequel for theatrical release. If that was done, there would have been a larger budget and the various shortcomings could have been corrected. I liked THE LITTLE MERMAID II: RETURN TO THE SEA. However, I believe that THE LITTLE MERMAID II: RETURN TO THE SEA will continue to have a definite audience with younger family members and there are actually some nostalgic moments that will no doubt attract teens and up who loved the original. I highly recommend this movie.",1031443200,4,2955,4.7734375

One thing I want to know is, this movie is set 10 years after the first one, right?  Well, Ariel was only 16 in the original, and now in the sequel she has a 9-year-old child?  Promoting teen pregnancy, are we?  To have a child that old, she'd have had to gotten pregnant within the first year of her marriage to Eric, making her still 16, possibly 17 at the time of conception.  Hello!  I thought we were trying to discourage that??
And the cool thing out the first one was the whole rebellion thing right?  Well, that's understandable, Ariel was 16 and she didn't agree with her father's strict rules and ways of life.  She wanted a different life for herself than what her father wanted.  But what does Melody have to rebel against?  She's 9 years old for Pete's sake!  What, are we looking to start a kiddie-riot?  There is a major difference between a teenager rebelling for her freedom and a child disobeying her parents. Ariel was pushing for her indepenence and freedom.  Melody was just a brat.
Also, the movie was just plain cheesy with the same plot (well, it's reversed as far as the water to land part goes, but basically the same) and some of the same gags from the first one.  Especially considering that the music wasn't as good at the original.  It just lacked the plot, characters, charm and magic that the original one had.

Now, to the sequael. It would make sense that Eric and Ariel have offspring, but what would he or she be like.
Well, typically the kids end up being completely unlike their parents. And this is no exception. Melody is curious, adverturous and often doesn't listen. This gets her into trouble.
This cause Atlantia and Ariels father King Triton to take action. Why? Who knew Ursela had a sister - that made sense! (Played again, brilliantly by Pat Carrol using a twist on her voice.

My daughter loves seeing Ariel all grown up, talking with Eric in mom-and-dad mode, and being loving and nurturing toward Melody.  She and I had a good discussion that even though Melody was mad at her mother, she should have listened to her and that she was almost badly hurt because of her disobedience.  Also, the villianess Morgana is closer to a more realistic threat that a young child would face; the deceptive 'friend' who lures her away from her parents with false promises.  My daughter will spend hours playing with her Ariel doll, sans fins and in a dress, pretending to have her collect seashells with a dark-haired and ponytailed 'Kelly' doll (pint sized Barbie).  Another neat thing is that Jodi Benson, Ariel's voice, has made a couple of albums of Bible songs for children, and my daughter gets a kick out of hearing 'Melody's mom' singing the same lessons she hears at Sunday School and AWANA.",1022198400,4,1083,4.801075268817204

1097829,5,6305940932,"Little Mermaid II is a great sequel to a wonderful movie.  The animation is beautiful, the songs and the score are very well done, and the characters are fresh and original.
I know there are a lot of naysayers out there who say that Ariel and Eric are ""different"" in this movie...well, duh, think about the time frame...they are both in their early 30s and parents of a twelve-year-old.  Did you expect them to be the same flippant teenagers they were in the first movie?  Now THAT would be disconcerting.
**Mild Spoilers Ahead**
I think the parallels to the first film with Ariel acting to Melody as her father acted toward her when SHE was a teen are humorous and well-placed in the film.  It doesn't make Ariel BORING, it makes her real...how many kids grow up saying they'll never be like their parents and then, as disturbing as it is, find themselves growing more and more like them every year?
As for the plot, I don't think it's anywhere near a ""copy"" of the original...think about it.  In the original, Ariel dreams of going up on land to explore, live life, meet real people with two legs, learn about all the things she's found on sunken ships, etc. and she does with Ursula's help.  In LM2, Melody thinks she's a screw-up, a nobody, and she's upset with her parents for NOT letting her go into the sea because she doesn't know about the incident that happened when she was a baby at the beginning of the film when Morgana tries to kill her and Triton gives her that locket.  It's more of a mystery to her...when she finds the locket, she needs to know what it means.  She does that on her own...she has no intentions of becoming a mermaid until Morgana puts it in her head so the sea witch can get King Triton's trident.  Two totally different stories.
Anyway, enough rambling.  The movie is great.  If you are a fan of LM1, Disney, or just good animated films, check out Little Mermaid 2: Return to the Sea.  I have many Disney films on DVD and this is definitely one of my favorites.",1014681600,6,1997,4.441095890410959

The script is cheesy and the songs are lackluster and unmemorable. The animation is not on par with the original film, but that's understandable. My biggest gripe, however, lies within the characters: the heroine Melody is made out to be an unruly brat; Ariel has suddenly transformed from the charming, somewhat naive young woman from the first film that we all love into some sort of overbearing housewife; the villain Morgana is nothing but a sad, over-cliched parody of Ursula (whom in my opinion was one of THE best Disney villains ever); even the comic relief side-kicks (Tip and Dash)aren't very funny.
If you're a die-hard Little Mermaid fan and absolutely MUST see what happens in this movie, rent it-- don't buy it... Nowadays, it seems that Disney must slap a Roman Numeral II on every single masterpiece they've ever done... why can't they just leave them ALONE!?

All of the ingredients are there: A heroine, Melody (much in the form of the ever-popular Ariel,) A villian, Morgana (who takes after Ursula in almost every way) some conflict (over-bearing parents in the forms of lifeless Eric and equally one-sided Ariel) and a fairy tale ending (this one ends on a happier note than the first.) Add a splash of humor: two would-be heros, Tip and Dash (--- can you say Timon and Pumba from ""The Lion King""? One's fat and kind, the other is cynical and small...) a wise-cracking evil henchmen, Undertoe (the shark who even resembles annoying Iago from ""Aladdin"") and of course the toiling (often tiny) chaperone, Sebastian (tries too hard and seems to be more of a parody of himself than a meaningful character.) Has the formula ever failed? It dosen't in ""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea."" The movie is pleasant and visually pleasing with forgettable but fun songs and characters.

Times have changed and I'm 17 now, but I still like it. Last night, I babysat for a 3 year old who wanted to watch this sequel. It wasn't that horrible, but it was nowhere near the excellence of the original.  First of all, I hated what they did to the original characters. Ariel has more or less turned into her father.(What is it with Disney sequels? They did this to Simba in the Lion King sequel too.) Flounder has turned into an older fish with many children, and Sebastian into an old crab that complains a lot. Personally, I found this rather disturbing in comparison with the characters' spunky personalities of the original. Secondly, the movie lacked one really great song. They tried though. There were songs every few minutes, but none of them were on the level of ""Under the Sea"" or ""Part of Your World"". Third, the villain was Ursula's sister. And, the two of them might as well have been twins because she was exactly like her sister, except less frightening.  Ursula gave me nightmares when I was little. The scene at the end of the original where she becomes really big scared me to death. The end of this movie did not even remotely frighten the three year old I watched it with. She found it really funny. (Actually, that could be a good thing depending on your opinion.)  Ok, now that I've complained about my main problems with it, I'll talk about the good points. Melody, Ariel's daughter, was the best part of the movie. She was a younger version of Ariel in the first movie. (I could write a ton of similarities between them) She was in many ways a typical 12 year old, which I found appealing. I also liked the scenes dealing with Melody's birthday party.

I did like Melody's character a lot, as she was a lot brighter than Ariel was (""sure, Miss Scary-Looking-Octopus-Lady-I-Don't-Know, I'll give you my voice and leave my family and friends to go with some guy whom I've never really met and doesn't even know I exist and hope this guy kisses me, or else I'm done for""), even though I guess Melody probably could have done better than to trust that Morgana character (who buy the way, was way too much like Ursula, even if they were sisters). But at least she didn't do it for a guy. Also, the songs were kinda stinky. I don't know, a lot of people seem to love them, but really, can any of them compare to ""Part of Your World""? ah...no. But then again, how can you compete with Alan Menken and Tim Rice, the Disney Duo, combined with the haunting voice of Jodi Benson (who, thankfully, returns in the sequel)? You can't.

1098061,3,6305940932,"Brushing aside the comparatively lax animation standards and the overpredictable plot (with some very obvious important and interesting reversals) this was a very enjoyable movie.
Finally, we get to see what happens at different stages of a Disney character's life---lo and behold, Ariel has become as headstrong and overprotective as her father was of her. Eric (who oddly remains a Prince while Ariel becomes a Queen) is good for window dressing, but does not appear to have any real function or talent beyond looking good and being nice.
In addition to the return of Flounder and Scuttle, we meet new friends who guide Melody on her quest of self discovery and dream fufilment. Although her mother tries to protect her from the sea, the same thing that once guided Ariel to the land tells Melody she has a special destinty all her own.
Sure, the other land kids in the film laugh at her, but she is ultimately whole when she discovers the real truth between the weird dreams that she had been having all of those years.
THe only real disappointment is Morgana. Instead of the sensual and psychotic Ursula, this sea witch looks like she is long overdue for some serious psychotherapy of any kind. Even though it might be scary for today's young kids, this ""monster"" will no be frightening at all to people like myself who remember seeing the original movie.",974419200,5,1359,4.787234042553192
1098062,2,6305940932,"Even though this sequel to the 1989 Disney classic ""The Little Mermaid"" has many of the same voices as the original (such as Jodi Benson as Ariel and Samuel Wright as Sebastian), it's missing a little something.
Namely, it's missing great animation, a plot that makes sense to adults, and, of course, the classic Menken/Ashman score and songs that made the original such a smash.
The biggest weakness, frankly, is the songs, which display all the creativity and spirit as your average Barbie commercial; come to think of it, maybe that was the goal. The animation also lacks spirit and could easily be from any Saturday morning cartoon; sorry, Disney, that's not why we pay good money to see your product.
It's kind of unfortunate that Disney insists on cheapening its brilliant animated originals (especially this one and ""Beauty and the Beast"") with lame straight-to-video sequels.
I'm sure the economics of a straight-to-video sequel are compelling, but take the case of the only sequel they didn't handle this way - ""Toy Story 2.""
Originally, the sequel to ""Toy Story"" was to be a straight-to-video job as well, but it was decided that it should be produced for theatrical release instead. The result? The film was a massive commercial and critical success, and was better than the original (no small compliment) in many ways.
Maybe the ""Toy Story 2"" experience will convince Disney to stop the straight-to-video dreck specials like ""Little Mermaid 2,"" but I doubt it.
I guess the good news is that this film is harmless fluff for the kiddies to watch, but I found it telling that after she watched this film, my four-year-old daughter said the original ""Mermaid"" was far better.
Well said.",973555200,17,1694,4.926573426573427
1098063,5,6305940932,"""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea"" met my expectations for a direct-to-video film. It did not exceed them nor did they fall short. The 1989 original  ""The Little Mermaid"" is a very formidable film, making the artistic success for a sequel a great challenge. To its credit ""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea"" did unfold in a different direction than I had anticipated. The story was not innovative but some of the particular plot situations were well thought out. In any story you have conflict and resolution and those are the aspects that I liked about this film. Some of the dramatics did rely on prior events, which took place in the original. That was thematically important to the overall story. One weakness of this film was the lack of character development. Character development was one of the strong points of ""The Little Mermaid."" I watched ""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea"" twice trying to determine if the film digressed in such a way to bolster my contention of this. What did the ""The Little Mermaid"" achieve in roughly the same amount of time that this film didn't? And then it struck me that it was the music or more specifically the songs in the original that advanced the story line and defined the characters. That was the brilliance of lyricist Howard Ashman. He and composer Alan Menken developed songs in the original that in several minutes clearly defined Ariel's reckless but innocent curiosity about the humans above and her yearning to discover that world. Every song in the original bolstered the characters, advanced the plot or enhanced the significance of a scene in addition to being very melodic and well written. So in the ""The Little Mermaid"" we were given a substantial amount of information and entertainment in a minimum amount of time. There is not a single frame of wasted footage in that film. ""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea"" does not have the advantage of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman compositions. The instrumental score is very good but the new songs feel superficial. The animation especially during the underwater scenes is good. Morgana is not as menacing as her sister Ursula was in the original. Other than Ursula I believe all the main characters are back. Melody, Ariel's daughter gets to mingle with the old characters as well as meet new ones. I thought that was significant seeing that the scriptwriters were determined not to have Melody just copy what Ariel did in the original. It would have been a very good sequel for theatrical release. If that was done, there would have been a bigger budget and the various shortcomings could have been corrected. I liked ""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea"" but I did not feel it was as good as Disney's other direct-to-video, ""Pocahontas II."" However, I believe that ""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea"" will have a definite audience with younger family members and there are actually some nostalgic moments that will no doubt attract teens and up who loved the original. I highly recommend this movie.",972950400,5,3048,4.79467680608365

It also displayed disobedience and disrespectfulness.  In conclusion, it's an okay movie to watch, but I just wouldn't rate it top-notch.",972172800,,817,5.112781954887218

1098168,3,6305940932,"Before I saw this movie, I knew it wasn't going to measure up to the original movie so I didn't have high expectations. This is probably why I ended up liking the movie to a certain degree instead of being completely disappointed.
It's basically the same plot as the first movie - Ursula's sister wants to rule the sea and uses Melody's desire to become a mermaid to her advantage. While the movie is predictable, there were certain parts that gave me a warm glow. It was nice to see Ariel change from her proper-and-prim attire and return to the sea as a mermaid. There's a nice duet between Ariel and Melody about ""sharing one moment"" in time. It almost captures Ariel's original wistfulness and longing. Prince Eric, as usual, isn't capable of saving the day or even himself. Sebastin's schtick seems to be old to the point where his whining can be grating. However, on the plus side, there are two new song-and-dance characters which serve as a comic relief to detract from the predictable plot.
I recommend renting this movie first before making a purchase. I got the DVD as a belated wedding present and I'm glad I have it, but I can't honestly say I'd have personally bought it myself - not without a huge markdown in the price.

The magic and wonder of the first film is missing here, in the story of Ariel's daughter Melody.  Melody has an obsession with the sea, and, because of events that happen early on, is forbidden from ever seeing it.  A clever idea, but one which could have been executed.
Ursula's revengeful sister Morgana is a weaker character than the original villian, and the addition of two new sidekicks didn't accomplish much more than to make sure that the classic characters didn't get to really participate in the story.
The songs are second tier, but, especially to younger children, hummable.
This film doesn't contain any real objectionable material, and is a fun distraction for fans of the original and those with younger viewers.

Admittedly, this sequel had big shoes to fill, as many people believe that The Little Mermaid is the greatest modern classic that has come out of Walt Disney Studios.  Where the classic had songs by the excellent duo of Menkin and Ashman, the songs in the sequel are flat and forced.  The animation, too, is seriously lacking in the new film; in the original it was beautifully rendered, whereas in the sequel it is reminiscent of the slop Disney puts out for their daily shows.
The story itself was familiar...  extremely familiar.  A little girl wonders what life on the other side of the sea is like and unwittingly enlists the aid of a sea witch to undermine the security of two kingdoms.  About the only aspect that wasn't blatantly ripped off from the original was the new 'comic relief' duo, a not-so-bright Walrus and his little Penguin friend.  I didn't catch their names, but for some reason Timon and Pumbaa comes to mind.

I saw the first one when I was 9, and this one looks like it will carry a good load of fans.  In our story, the arrival of Ursula the sea witch's sister Morgana prompts Ariel and Eric to sever ties with King Triton and the sea to protect their daughter Melody.  But after entering her early teens, Melody begins to take on her mother's rebellious nature and venture out into the sea.  Melody is probably the most welcome new DTV character, inheriting her father's jet-black hair and her mother's expressive eyes.  She is also voiced by the incredible Tara Charendoff (who also voices Bubbles on ""The Powerpuff Girls,"" but don't worry, Melody doesn't sound quite as peppy), a 27 year old voice actress who convincingly makes us believe in Melody's adventures.  After finding a locket meant for her, Melody runs away, and Morgana (voicd by Ursula's villainous voice Pat Carroll) decides that Melody will be the ""perfect tool for Triton's undoing.""  Probably most of the original's fans will find a big change in Ariel.  While Ariel was a somewhat rebellious 16 year old in the first one, here she's become a more responsible 28 year old mother (though she doesn't really look 28!).  Jodi Benson returns to voice her.  On the downside, the sidekicks who once made the original magical have grown up and lost their charm.  Scuttle (Buddy Hackett) feels like he was written in as an afterthought, and Flounder has an even smaller part where he tries to help as well.  Only Samuel E Wright as Sebastian is given a part that best befits his voice-acting. Two new sidekicks are Tip and Dash, a penguin and walrus duo who befriend Melody, but end up being carbon copies of most comic duos (ie Timon and Pumbaa).  Morgana's lackeys are even less pronounced, except for Undertow, a shark that got turned into a pipsqueak by Triton.  He provides a few funny moments.  The animation is choppy in some places, but does try to keep pace, looking much better than the ""Aladdin"" TV-style animation.

Those dissatisfied with the sudden ending of the first movie will enjoy seeing that contrary to the fairy-tales, life's best should and can occur AFTER the ""and they married and lived happily ever after"" event.  TLM2 clinches it. Adults will forget the implausibility of the biology.  It's sheer fun to see how Eric and Ariel have grown ever closer in married life... they support, touch (yes, and smooch), frolic, and fight together.  Naturally, there's a tough mother-daughter conflict. And.. there's  a satisfying ending that will totally amaze you! The story editing hangs together quite well...for those who care. I was always hoping that Disney would bring us a sequel to TLM. And happily, Disney has lavished tons of care and attention on this production. The wait was worth it!

Anderson story line, this one touches on such a wide spectrum of relationships and themes, has such heart, comedy, and  action, it's going to attract thousands of adult fans as well as teens and little'uns. TLM2 is artistically and story-wise true to the original film, but breaks out entirely on its own.  You can plainly see the heart in this film, not only in its story, but in the animation and articulation as well.  Watch the facial expressions (the eyes espec.) and body language. Musically, it gives notable tributes to Broadway Musical giants Alan Menkin and the late Howard Ashman with hints of ""Part of your World"" interwoven with a wealth of new, and original toe-tapping beats.  The backgrounds, color schemes and character styles are rich enhancements over the originals, while still consistent with the original world. If you haven't seen the first one, shame on you!  But this movie stands so much on its own, it won't matter.  We've had it 24 hours and  seen it six times.",969667200,11,2468,4.934624697336562
1098391,4,6305940932,"They RUINED the main characers. Eric sounds like a different person! Couldn't they have found someone who sounded just a little like the original Eric??  And I found it very disconcerting to see Flounder as a fat adult with a bunch of kids. He had such a cute, clumsy, little-kid charm...that's who he was.  Now, most disturbing of all, was seeing Ariel transformed from a spunky and spirited, independent teenager to a very motherly...""old"" character. What happened? They turned her into her father, exactly! That's not who she is, at all.
Otherwise, the movie was adorble. The film was entertaining and fun thanks to Melody and her friends. I didn't think I'd like Melody but she's a mettlesome little daydreaming mermaid with alot of personality.  I just love Sebastian no matter what! And the penguin and walrus she meets along the way are a really cute and funny pair!  If they'd just elimate the original Little Mermaid characters this would be worthy of five stars!",969494400,6,972,4.872727272727273
1098392,5,6305940932,"In this video, Ariel and Prince Eric now have a daughter named Melody. Melody is very much interested in the sea, and Ursula's  evil sister Morgana, knows it, and wants to try and trick Melody into becoming a Mermaid as revenge against Ariel, but will she succeed? Or will Ariel be a heroine? You'll need to get the movie and see for your self. But I will let you know the movie is filled with action, drama, and comedy, just like the first movie ""The Little Mermaid"".  Adults and children alike of all ages can enjoy this wonderfully animated motion picture. Most of the original characters are featured in the movie along with some new faces. As with the first movie, (which by the way was released over 9 years ago) this one contains fun music which the kids can enjoy. If you want a film  you and the kids can enjoy for years to come, ""The Little Mermaid II"" is one to get.",969408000,14,877,4.335365853658536
1098393,4,6305940932,This is a darling show for kids.  It addresses some of the problems that kids and their parents have when kids feel their parents don't understand.  I didn't think the nemesis was as scary for very small children as the last  one also which is good. I'd definitely add this to your Disney Collection.,969408000,,300,4.518518518518518
1098394,4,6305940932,"Having been a fan of the original Little Mermaid for years, and having two children who are big fans, our household couldn't wait for the release of  this sequel.  We weren't let down.  I admit I was somewhat apprehensive  after the Lion King 2 sequel, which was much more frightening than the  original, but as my 2 1/2 year old said after watching this movie ""it  didn't scare me!"", so I was quite relieved.  The kids absolutely loved  the movie and were glued to the screen.  They've watched it twice in the  span of about 20 hours now.
The 4 star rating is somewhat misleading, as  on its own, it would probably be a 5 star movie.  The reason I could only  give 4 stars is that I couldn't help but compare it to the original, and  I'm sure I'm not the only one who will do so.  That said, the movie was  quite good, although not quite up to the standards of the original.  The  music was somewhat repetitive, and not as gripping as the original, but was  still entertaining.  Sebastian, as always, was a treat, and the new  characters introduced mesh quite nicely with the existing cast.
The DVD  extras include a trivia game, animated storybook, and an 8-minute short  cartoon ""Merbabies"", which my children loved.
In summary, I  would certainly recommend this sequel to anyone who enjoyed the original,  as well as all fans of Disney.",969408000,23,1340,4.506276150627615
1098395,5,6305940932,"I walked into the store with excitment pumping through every pore of my being.  I had waited so long for the sequel that I was just as excited as  my two little girls.  And when we reached the video aisle and a special  display caught our eyes, I know we all squealed in delight.  We bought it,  and ran straight home.  The VCR was set to go and the popcorn at the ready.  The lights were dimmed to a golden low and our breath caught in awe as the  opening sequence began.  There before our mermaid hungry eyes was a scene  of unforgettable glee.  King Triton welcoming his new grandaughter Melody  with open arms as the shining, love filled eyes of Ariel watched with  Pride.  All was set for a happy scene when to our horror in bursts Ursula's  evil sister Morgana, snatching an infant Melody and placing her in the arms  of certain death.  I have to tell you this movie kept me as much on the  edge of my seat as the first.  It was so wonderful to go back in time to  when I was a teenager and watching The Little Mermaid for the first time, I  was now watching the sequel with my own daughters, whose eyes were just as  wide as mine.  Thank you Disney for bringing a wonderful story to life  again for all of us who have been waiting for so long.  You have once again  brought a world of wonder into our homes and our hearts.",969321600,4,1329,4.1299212598425195
1098396,4,6305940932,"Ever since ""Return of Jafar"" became a bestselling video, Disney has delighted fans and upset critics by releasing direct-to-video sequels  of most of its recent theatrical features.  After eleven years, The Little  Mermaid gets its own treatment...but this one is actually pretty good.  Disney has come a long way from ""Jafar"" to here, stopping along  the way to create the excellent ""Simba's Pride"".  This movie  starts awkwardly, and the first few minutes are both cheesy and a complete  rip-off of the opening of ""Sleeping Beauty"".  But, if you stay  with it, it really does get better.  There's actually excitement and at  least one or two decent songs.  The animation, however, is still very  direct-to-video, produced by the Disney TV team rather than the feature  film department...but even the characters are looking more three  dimensional than previous ""cheapies"".  This one is worth  seeing...besides, does it really matter?  A true Disney fan would not be  without a sequel, even if it was bad.  Fortunatly, here, it's not...",967852800,21,1037,5.163636363636364
