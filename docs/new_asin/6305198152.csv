986490,5,6305198152,"A product of Canada's National Film Board, you can discern almost immediately that this film was supposed to have been an arch, sniggering hatchet job by big city intellectuals about some backwoods goon in his  ""bearproof"" suit. It really must have surprised the  ""smart"" folks at the NFB when this movie did excellent business  and Troy Hurtubise became something of a national folk hero.
Why? Because  despite his foibles, Troy Hurtubise is truely a hero. People like to hear  him recount his encounter with a Grizzly and why he wants to repeat it.  He's an interesting guy following a quixotic but interesting challange.  that's entertainment!",963446400,4,646,5.095238095238095
986491,4,6305198152,"A must see for lovers of the wilderness.  Clear proof that truth is in fact stranger than fiction.

986492,5,6305198152,This is the best movie that I have ever seen. What could be better than a guy in a protective suit getting hit by a truck at 30 mph? I dunno. And then a log. I wish he were here now so I could beat him with a bat.,959904000,4,213,3.36734693877551
986493,5,6305198152,"If Motorhead moved in next door, your lawn would die.  However, if Motorhead became farmers, they would grow copies of ""Project Grizzly.""  This is cinema at its most powerful and gripping.  This  movie depicts a man who is somewhere between brilliant and ridiculous,  visionary and villain, demi-god and dunce.  You will not be sure whether to  ask for his autograph or help in the effort to have him driven from your  town.  You will certainly be inspired to buy a Bowie Knife.",952387200,3,478,4.7317073170731705
986494,2,6305198152,"In the light that all of the reviews of this bonehead's performance come from south of the 49th, I felt honor bound to throw my two cents worth in.  This video clearly demonstrates how foolish people can be.  I find it  terribly amusing that our hero really believes that he can build a suit of  armor that will let him grapple with a grizzly, when we all know that Papa  bear would make short work of the suit in the Project Grizzly video.  In  fact, the real danger would be if to the bear, who risks dying laughing,  not whether the suit will work or not.  The commentary about Canada and  bears is about as ludicrous as can be.  It is very obvious that Hurtubise  has not researched his quarry, or come to the common sense conclusion that  you avoid a more powerful enemy.  Regardless of how protective the suit is,  ten men aren't as powerful as one middling grizzly.  Armor doesn't do any  good when Papa bear peels it off like an orange rind. Were it not for these  half-baked macho posturings (the comments about bowie knives are especially  hilarious), Project Grizzly would be actual comedy, instead of the  confused, rambling, John-Wayne home-movie that it is.",948585600,2,1171,4.565217391304348

7884965,5,6305198152,"It's a rare moment in which I appreciate any form of performance art. That's what this is, performance art followed on film, and it is awesome.

It's not for everyone. There are slow bits, and there are disappointments. If you're expecting a movie, something with high production value, a thoughtfully written script, or even a coherent plotline, this will not satisfy you. If, however, you seek out that underlying weirdness that makes humans interesting, the one that every reality TV producer tries to fabricate with little success and that too often flounders in the drudgery of actual life, then you need to meet Troy Hurtubise. Bring a little vision of your own to the viewing, and Project Grizzly is a masterpiece.

If you lack vision, you still may find refuge in the simple fact that a guy has built a bear-proof suit in his garage and is testing it in the most ridiculous manner possible for your entertainment.

Bears don't have flame-throwers, but in Troy's mind... why take the chance? It is a damned good time.",1314230400,,1024,4.806818181818182
7884966,4,6305198152,"It would be easy to make fun of the subject of this doc.  It's about Troy, a Canadian who after a brush with a bear, decides to build a bear proof suit.  Yes, this was parodied beautifully on the Simpsons, but I can tell you right now, Troy is much more complex and compelling than Homer.

Let's get something straight here.  Troy is not the mountain man / engineering genius he wants to be.  He's just a regular joe trying to be something more.  That he's chosen this road just shows how misguided we humans can sometimes be.  On the other hand, there's something truly compelling his quest.  Like Don Quixote, Troy lives largely in a fantasy world where he gets to be Davy Crocket and Jaques Costea at the same time.

This movie has more than its share of silly moments.  Shots of Troy getting hit by cars or thrown off cliffs to test (uh, yeah that makes sense) his suit.  Watch Troy rant about knives or give a story of his dramatic bear encounter (which amounts to basically a bear pushed him down and walked away) or hear him talk about the ""Science"" of his bear suit.  All of which are absurd and unbelievable except that they are real moments.  I could not look away, and I can't tell you why.  And for some reason, by the end, I even respected misguided Troy because at least he's out there, trying to make his own legend.

I also recommend listening to the commentary tracks.  The directer track sheds such fascinating light on this character that by the end, you realize there's more going on in Troy's head then even he knows.",1151884800,,1538,4.400709219858156
7884967,1,6305198152,"I've seen some insulting movies in my day, but this is the worst effort I have ever witnessed. The joke is on the viewer in this sleep inducing hillbilly romp. The real messege here is, what happens when a mentally retarded canadian is given a camera for Christmas and told to make a movie. Halfway though the movie I was sure that it was a spoof documentary like ""The Last Broadcast"", but sadly it wasn't. Toward the end of the flick when Troy was shaving with his bowie knife I was begging the knife to slit Troy's throat so as to breathe life into this comatose film. Believe me, there isn't a drinking game in the world that could make this movie any less boring. I took a camera and video taped a blade of grass growing for 5 1/2 days and audiences raved that it had far more action than Project Grizzly. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this doc.",1151280000,3,858,4.269938650306749
7884968,3,6305198152,"Many a long year ago I saw some TV show about a man building a bear-proof suit.  Scenes of a pickup ramming this guy wearing what looked like football armor on steroids was a hoot.  Naturally I had to watch this DVD.

Turns out the inventor of the suit, Troy Hurtubise, didn't know when to stop.  Several of his earlier suits appeared to allow some mobility, but the final version (to date) is so heavy and clunky he can barely move in it and is turtle-helpless when he falls.  His scary one-time encounter with a bear that swatted him must have overwhelmed his practicality.

It's an intriguing idea, a suit that allows the wearer to survive a grizzly-mauling.  It'd have pretty darn limited demand, I suppose, but bear watchers might feel more secure in one.  Treadwell (in ""Grizzly Man"") could have used one.  But the suited-up Hurtubise cannot walk on any kind of slope or rough surface when he takes to the north woods to, he hopes, encounter a grizzly, and sets the suit aside.  Thus there's no climax, only scenes of various previous tests and Hurtubise's own slightly goofy commentary. He should have paid a zoo to let him enter a grizzly cage.

Hurtubise's robot-like suit is a failure, although it reminds me of my mind's image of what Heinlein's starship troopers' exoskeletal armor looked like.  Too bad the grizzly armor doesn't have a similar power source.  Like the suit, the documentary is mildly entertaining but ultimately incomplete.",1142121600,,1452,4.783132530120482
7884969,1,6305198152,Grizzley man makes this guy look like the biggest self promoting idiot ever! This movie is terrible,1140220800,,99,4.882352941176471
7884970,4,6305198152,"No offence to Troy, obviously this movie has annoyed some bush types who feel it portrays him as pathetic. While I admire Troy's love of the wild and industrious methods of building a grizzly proof suit, what the hell is he thinking in building something that you can't walk around in? Did he expect to have a helicopter at the ready to fly him around? All he needs to do is put a jet powerpack on the thing and his problems would be solved! Seriously though, I really felt for the guy when he got so close to his goal of fighting a grizzly in his suit only to have to abandon the thing because he kept falling over. It's humours but also very painful to watch, his disapointment is obvious.

This film is a look into the male mind, specifically those survivalist types who seem to be actually hoping that the world will descend into chaos so they can test all their commando techniques. But this film reveals that realty keeps getting in the way with these guys, the world is not a comic book story. As Troy is Canadian, he is rather harmless and is non uses of guns is commendable, if he were american, he would be armed to the teeth. Troy's stories of his seeming mental instability makes me also question the whole bear encounter entirely.

My other concern with this movie is that $150,000 of tax payer money went into this crazy project, didn't anyone from the government question building a 200lb suit that you can barely move around in?

Oh well, watch and enjoy, it's an interesting story and Troy is a fascinating character, if a bit nuts.",1114819200,3,1549,4.447183098591549
