8729496,4,B0142WFQLO,"At the age of eight, Jane (Katherine Heigl) realized her calling. Being very helpful at a wedding, she realized that she was fascinated with being an integral part of weddings. We meet her as she is functioning as a bridesmaid at two different weddings on the same night. That night she also stumbles upon a writer. However, what she does not know is that this writer who seems very cynical is actually the one that writes articles that she collects about weddings.

You can see how everything is being set up for a formula movie. The producers tried to give the characters more depth than most of these formula movies where there is always a love triangle of some sort. And of course, the writer has to put his foot into it somewhere right at the most inopportune time we know this is coming. However, the thing that makes the movie fascinating is how they get from point A to point Z, and all the people and points in between.

So enjoy the movie and enjoyed the quirkiness of seeing 27 dresses but do not expect anything extraordinary.

I saw the Blu-Ray version; by now, of course Blu-Ray is blas.  So there isn't anything exceptional to say about this and the movie extras are goodies are the standard how did we make this why did we make this what did we do type things which gives a little bit of insight but not enough to make the movie any more interesting.",1505952000,,1366,4.430278884462151
