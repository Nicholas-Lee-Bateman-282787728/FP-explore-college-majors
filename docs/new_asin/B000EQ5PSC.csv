8112892,3,B000EQ5PSC,Was ok.  Had some good info.  Not great.,1506556800,,40,3.875
8112893,5,B000EQ5PSC,"I really loved this DVD as well as the book. While the book is not needed, it helps to have it. To get more in depth the terms & processes to review what you've learned. The dvd on its own is a great watch & very informative. It is excellent for the newbie or someone really starting to get into wine. Or if your a knowledge freak like me & just want to know about things that intrigue you. This is it. It explains everything you need to know. From your grape types to the breaking down of your Reds & whites. How to taste, how to understand & describe your wine, the wine making process, the regions, how to buy, store wines & order wine at restaurants. It even explains about the importance of the different types of Serving glasses & how it makes a certain difference in the wine. Food pairing how to & so so much more. Excellent DVD! Attention: If your a wine connoisseur this DVD will not do much for you.
To the newbies, newly bitten by the wine bug & wine aficionados I also recommend ""An introductory guide to WINE"" and ""Wine Basics : the beginners guide"". Excellent DVDs for your wine needs.",1368403200,,1100,4.267942583732057
8112894,5,B000EQ5PSC,It was great to get to review the basics and learn a bit more of the wine-tasting culture. So glad I viewed this!,1362009600,,113,3.9565217391304346
8112895,5,B000EQ5PSC,"This is a great dvd. I actually thought it was a book when I ordered it, but I was pleased to see that it was a dvd.  It has helped a great deal.  I had no knowledge of wine before this purchase.  I have learned alot and now I feel comfortable in wine conversations with peers.",1296518400,,277,3.9107142857142856
8112896,4,B000EQ5PSC,"I agree with the 3 reviews before me.  Lots of information for the absolute beginner presented by one friendly male sommelier.  Sometimes the advice gets a little generic, but overall for $6, a good introductory lesson.",1294099200,,219,5.055555555555555
8112897,5,B000EQ5PSC,"I actually, believe it or not, received this DVD on accident. I meant to buy the book, but didn't read the product listing properly. So, in spite of my folly, when the DVD arrived I was pissed off. But I popped it in the DVD player anyways. To my surprise, I learned so much more than I expected from the DVD. The DVD kept me attentive, I was able to work around the house and still listen to the DVD at the same time. It took the stress out of reading for once, just because I had the DVD. Plus all the vivid pictures and explanations helped me see the wines, and understand more about what the narrator was saying. DVDs are great educational escapes from books. And I felt that this was a great example. I feel that I don't even need the book because the DVD was so informal.",1239321600,9,777,4.152317880794702
8112898,5,B000EQ5PSC,"I really really really really enjoyed this DVD and recommend it to anyone who loves to drink wine and has come to the realization that there is more to wine than just being able to distinguish between white and red. It's not a connoisseur's guide to wine, it's ""Wine for Dummies"", people like me, who are enthusiasts, not snobs. It goes over all the basics any ambitious ""wino"" needs to know: pouring, smelling, savoring, storing, pairing, wines from different countries and their characteristics, grape varietals... a truly thorough presentation packed with tons of useful tips.
It's like taking a class because we only hear the sommelier speaking to us for the entire duration, but his approach is very friendly, clear, easy to understand, and not at all pretentious.",1227398400,11,769,5.015625
8112899,3,B000EQ5PSC,"I found the information in this to be modestly useful. Its a good starting point and adequate if you want to
just learn basics. I made the mistake of watching it AFTER seeing another more comprehensive DVD on
the same subject. So from that standpoint, this was kind of a step backward for me. Aside from being a bit
too basic, it only really features the host through the entire DVD. And while he may be a reputable sommelier,
listening to just one person's perspective for an hour is somewhat limiting. Especially if you're discussing such
a broad topic as wine. So... If you're a beginner, this is a good DVD. But if you know anything about wine, I'd
really go with something more in depth (such as ""An Introductory Guide to Wine"").",1188691200,14,734,4.526315789473684
