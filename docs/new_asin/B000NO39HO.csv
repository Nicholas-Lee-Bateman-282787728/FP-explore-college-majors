8179662,5,B000NO39HO,"This true story focus's on the journey of a young, intelligent young Australian man called Brendon Abbot. Implicit in the storyline is his conclusion that the financial concerns his family has can be fixed by robbing banks. There is a wonderful scene where his mother is mowing a tiny front lawn on a huge ride on mower as she converses with the local police who are staking the house. It is set in an Australia which no longer exists and the movie is worth watching just to see old footage of Perth, Southern Cross, Darwin and South Australia. Brendon's sense of fun is demonstrated when he participates in a tour of the Fremantle prison and signs the visitors book after escaping from it. The movie gets its title from the enjoyment he seemed to have taking photo's of himself and sending them to the police while he was 'on the run.' It's a tragedy...it's a comedy...it's a 'must see' for anyone who loves the Australia we were.",1388102400,2,931,4.580838323353293
