5278943,4,B0099115Q4,So happy Season 2 of Pac-Man came out recieved it today and making my thanksgiving weekend coming so fast. Happy WB released all the seasons sometimes they start like smurfs and don't finish. Pac-Man is truly one of my favorite 80s cartoons the addition of PJ and Super Pacman make season 2 more fun. Also the Chrismas Comes to Pacland is one of my favorite Christmas Cartoons as well. I hope Saturday Supercade gets released some day as well or Rubik the Amazing Cube. Hanna- Barbera and Ruby-Spears Cartoons are the best!,1353715200,2,523,4.695652173913044
5278944,5,B0099115Q4,"This DVD contains the entire Season 2 of the Pac-Man cartoon series from the 1980s, plus the ""Christmas Comes to Pacland"" special (which actually aired during Season 1 but is not included in the Season 1 DVD set).

Unlike Season 1 which came on 2 discs, Season 2 has fewer episodes so everything fits onto 1 disc.  The disc includes 8 episodes (each episode contains 2 stories):

- ""Here's Super-Pac"", ""Hey, Hey, Hey... It's P.J.""
- ""The Super-Pac-Bowl"", ""Journey into the Pac-Past""
- ""The Public Pac-Enemy No. 1"", ""The Old Pac-Man and the Sea""
- ""The Greatest Show in Pacland"", ""Pac-A-Thon""
- ""The Genii of Pacdad"", ""P.J. Goes Pac-Hollywood""
- ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Pac-Man"", ""Around the World in 80 Chomps""
- ""Super-Pac vs. Pac-Ape"", ""Computer Packy""
- ""Pac Van Winkle"", ""Happy Pacs-Giving""

Each episode consists of the opening sequence (about 30 seconds long), the first story (about 11 minutes long), the second story (about 11 minutes long), and the credits (about 30 seconds long).  There are chapter breaks after each of those things, which makes it easy to skip over the opening sequence and credits while you're watching.

The disc also includes the ""Christmas Comes to Pacland"" 23 minute special (which has a few chapter breaks in it), as well as the eight ""Pac-Mania"" intermissions grouped together (with a chapter break after each one).  Each ""Pac-Mania"" intermission is a humorous 30 second segment that was originally shown between the first and second stories of each episode.  Unlike the Season 1 DVD set, where they put each ""Pac-Mania"" in between the first and second stories of each episode, they have broken out all of the ""Pac-Mania"" intermissions into a separate section for the Season 2 DVD.

As far as picture quality goes - it looks pretty good for what it is.  It has not been remastered, though, despite what Warner Brothers claims (on the WB store web site, it says ""This film is newly remastered"").  While watching the DVD, I noticed a tiny amount of shaking in the opening sequence of each episode, and I also saw tiny white and black specks appearing randomly on the screen during the episodes - stuff that you typically see from VCR tapes.  But none of that should detract from the viewing experience for a 1980s cartoon; I just wanted to point out that it hasn't been remastered.",1353628800,16,2311,4.83756345177665
5278945,5,B0099115Q4,"Another great Season of Pac-Man. This season would be the introduction of Super-Pac who actually in my opinion was a wonderful addition to the show. My favorite episodes for this season are ""Super-Pac vs. Pac-Ape"" and ""Pac Van Winkle"". This disc also contains the First season premiere of ""Christmas Comes to Pac-Land"" which was a televison special that aired at night. Unlike the first season release, Pac-Mania cartoons are a bonus feature and are not slated in between the episodes, not sure if that matters to anyone and does not effect how great the show is for me. The DVD-R Disc plays perfectly in my DVD player and very good quality and design. You have the choice to play all, or choose your selection from the menu. I am happy Pac-Man season 2 has been released to DVD.",1353456000,6,779,4.6521739130434785
5278946,5,B0099115Q4,I received this today and put it in my DVD player I looked at the menu screen bonuses and there was the Christmas special and another bonus that wasn't mentioned all the Pacmania shorts from Season 2 Thanks WB for this complete Series! I will keep buying these classic HB and Ruby Spears series since this is when the animation was called animation.,1349049600,6,349,4.555555555555555

5278973,5,B0099115Q4,If you grew up with it you gotta love it!  The voice characterization of the few lead roles played by the guy who plays Packy is his best role.  Pac Baby is one of my favorites of that actor's roles.  I find myself doing impersonations of the characters I like in cartoons I grew up with when I go through watching them and Pac Baby is one of them lol!,1366329600,2,352,4.0
