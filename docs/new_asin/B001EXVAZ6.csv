8299879,3,B001EXVAZ6,"Ashwini Chaudhary's 'Dhoop' takes a look into corruption of the governmental system. Unlike the several other films about corruption in India, 'Dhoop' takes a different turn. There is no overt bloodbath sequence or dramatic scene where the hero takes the law in his own hands, none of that nonsense. What we see is the parent's struggle against the corrupt system to keep the memory of their son and the several other brave soldiers who were martyred.

Based on a true story, Chaudhary's film starts at a slower pace but it gradually picks up. The screenplay keeps the viewer engaged as we see how the professor overcomes each obstacle and the sacrifices he makes. Music also contributes well. Jagjit Singh's Ghazals are beautiful.

Performances are a standout. Om Puri and Ravathi are truly excellent. One cannot help but feel for these two strong characters. Their performances look very natural and both prove that they are two of the best. In her debut film, Gul Panag definitely holds her own and her next films like 'Dor' and 'Manorama Six Feet Under' further prove that she's here to stay. In a brief role, Sanjay Suri does well. However, he looks a little too old for the part.

'Dhoop' tells a simple story of the common man's struggle against the system. The ending is slightly dramatic but the strong acting and the screenplay more than make up for the flaws. Definitely worth a watch.",1304035200,,1396,4.808333333333334
