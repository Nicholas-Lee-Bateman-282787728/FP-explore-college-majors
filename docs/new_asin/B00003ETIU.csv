1328755,5,B00003ETIU,"Like any piece of popular art, Zacharia stands in ephemeral testament to the everlasting need of the young to be heard, and the less comprehensible and/or accessible to the surrounding hoardes of conservative authority, the better. For many, this was first time ever that you sat down in darkened cinema with 300 kids from the srrounding county and heard things uttered aloud on-screen that, until then, simply were not said. ""I'm gonna buy me a kilo, ALREADY rolled!!"" was not a quote you brought home and repeated at the dinner table, not in 1971 not in the midwest... The point here is the HAPPENING, NOT the film itself! Arguing a critique of this film's cinematic elements is like berating Warhol's soup cans because of the colors chosen to paint them! If you were at a midnight showing of Zacharia, then you will love this revisit (If I close my eyes I can still smell the greasy popcorn intermingled with pot smoke). If you are a film student, this one belongs on your shelf (I would suggest right between ""Wild In The Streets"" and ""Easy Rider"") If, not, you may find it pointless, even stupid - and that's just fine with us...",1400457600,,1134,4.646766169154229

1328774,5,B00003ETIU,"Zachariah, although by no means what one may call a cinematic triumph, is a thrilling return to yesteryear for those who were there. The movie paved the way for Blazing Saddles, launched Don Johnson's career, and put the American West into a whole different perspective.

Zachariah was an assault on one of the most cherished of America's icons, a western fraught with dope and love between men. It is a tale that defines the far too short experiment in alternate values, a tale that defines what the counterculture envisioned for the future. The message may be trite - and certainly has been rejected - but it gives us an insight into what could be if we only we reflect on what truly matters in life.

Whether you are merely curious about the now historical times of my generation or you would like to revisit those lost days of youth, Zachariah will not fail you.",1339891200,4,866,4.616883116883117

1328778,5,B00003ETIU,"Hollywood fired up this fat doobie of a rock-and-roll Western by hinting to the press that George Harrison would compose the score and ""a younger Jack Nicholson"" would star. When all that bogus smoke cleared, what emerged was a veritable stoner's crash pad of a movie that wobbles woozily from one hoot to another.

Set in a fever-delirious Old West that we suspect was dreamed up on way too much acid, Zachariah opens with lithe Jewish cowboy John Rubinstein galloping across the desert towards a mysterious, giant, 2001-esque slab. On closer inspection, the slab turns out to be a huge speaker for a rock group that just happens to be loitering about, ready to play the psychedelic opening number. The appropriate atmosphere now having been established, our hero Rubinstein soon opens a mail-order parcel containing his new gun, which he practices yanking again and again from his trousers before rushing to show it off to androgynously pretty local blacksmith Don Johnson, at whom he makes goo-goo eyes and cracks feeble jokes. After Rubinstein has let this fellow buckaroo fondle his shiny new pistol, Johnson bats his long lashes, whispers ""Far out,"" and the guys chase each other around in a Love Story-style montage. Later, Rubinstein queries philosophically, ""Which do you think it would be easier to shoot it out with, the sun or the moon?"" Rubinstein answers his own koan all by himself. It's the moon, of course, because, ""It's old and it's dead."" Unlike, say, Hollywood.

The two boys ride off in tandem and join up with the outlaw gang the Crackers (played with mind-bending self-satisfaction by the rock group Country Joe and the Fish), who alternate stickups staged to the ""William Tell Overture"" with rock numbers dealing with such topics as what one might want from the cowboy life (""I want to wash in a bathtub of gold... I want 97 kilos already rolled"").

Rubinstein earns a rep as a gunslinger, impressing reigning gunfighter Elvin Jones, who, after indulging in what feels like a 20-minute drum solo, is challenged by the newcomer to a quick-draw contest. All this competition makes our lads restless, however. When Rubinstein proposes that he and Johnson strike out on their own, he goes too far for even the most accommodating cowpoke: he tells Johnson, ""I love you."" This prompts Johnson to utter aloud the words that everybody's got to hear sometime: ""You and me are not on the same trip.""

When Johnson splits, Rubinstein decides to investigate sex with a woman. Enter Pat Quinn, for whom Rubinstein gets bathed by hippie hookers to the strains of sitar music and decks himself out in rhinestone cowboy drag fit for Liberace. Quinn responds with a bizarre go-go dance and beds Rubinstein, aping Mae West as she declares, ""Tom Mix, Ken Maynard, Lash LaRue, Bat Masterson--you're better than all of them!"" Alas, Rubinstein doesn't feel the same way; he hightails it out of town to shack up with older man William Challee. When this duo isn't dancing together in the desert, the old codger is wowing Rubinstein with words of wisdom like ""Hurry up and die, hurry up and die"" -- which, of course, is what the film is doing. Back into Rubinstein's life struts Johnson, now sporting an earring with his rough-trade black outfit, and boasting, ""I've got it together. I don't know if I'm the same, but I'm where I want to be and I'm on my way up!"" He then announces that he, too, is through with women, whereupon he says to Rubinstein, ""Strap on your gun.""

When Rubinstein responds prissily that he has renounced violence, Johnson throws a hair-pulling, scenery-chewing hissy fit during which he blurts, ""Zachariah, come back. I can't do it alone!"" How will it all end, you ask? We don't want to spoil the finale for you, but if you've guessed that the lads hug meaningfully while riding side-by-side atop their matching steeds and then gallop off into the sunset, well, you're quick on the draw.",1238284800,5,3914,4.862068965517241

The other important point to mention is that the story is a loose retelling of the Hermann Hesse novel Siddhartha. But then... so many things are....

1328794,4,B00003ETIU,"I saw this film when it was first released, and still remember it as great fun.  The subtitle ""The First Electric Western"" captures the spirit - tongue-in-cheek stoner western from an indie studio.  The first half of the film was hilarious: electric guitar music in the middle of the desert (very long power cord?); stagecoach outruns men on horseback; Country Joe and the Fish as an outlaw gang named the Crackers (funnier than Cheech and Chong); a mail order pistol turns a boy into gunslinger; an ambiguously gay relationship between Don Johnson and John Rubenstein (or is it just boyish enthusiasm and naivite?)

1328796,5,B00003ETIU,"I have loved this film since i saw it in the base theatre at NAS Sigonella in Sicily.

Just one additional correction to the writer who missed the point and thought it was a drama gone wrong, rather than a purpose-built comedy:

""The Fish"" are not ""Country Joe's band"" (as a lot of people assume) -- rather, the ""Fish"" is guitarist Barry Melton, co-founder and co-writer of a lot of the music.",1136160000,7,393,4.444444444444445
1328797,4,B00003ETIU,"Despite what the reviewer below writes, this movie is supposed to be a comedy with dramatic elements, not an accidentally comic drama.  Co-written by the Firesign Theater (buy their CD's!), this was the first (and apparently only) rock and roll western (not a 'western rock opera' as the other Marc writes below -- 'opera' gives it different conotations -- no one sings in character).  Although I applaud the ulitmate message of the movie (a hippyish exhortation to slow down and follow your heart, not the whims of society), the acting does hinder it a bit.  I've read that the producers took Firesign's first draft and filmed it, rather than letting them rework it, as they usually do with their works -- and it shows.  It comes off as a good first draft.  A must see for Firesign Theatre fans, fans of Elvin Jones and Don Johnson (if any) and the James Gang, but that may really be all.  Otherwise, definitely rent it.  It IS worth seeing if you're in the mood for fun and don't have big expectations (in other words, if you're drunk or high).",1108684800,6,1046,4.591397849462366
1328798,3,B00003ETIU,"The ""western rock opera"" is not a genre that has been explored by many directors (probably for good reasons).  In ZACHARIAH, director George Englund takes a multitude of long-haired actors into the mountains and desert of California and attempts to create a hip, compelling drama.  Don't expect a cathartic experience here.  Instead, you'll find yourself laughing at the campy characters, dialogue, and situations which come up as the protagonist, Zachariah (played by John Rubinstein), learns how to shoot a mysterious pistol discovered buried in the sand.  Soon he cultivates an intense desire to become a gunslinger, and with the help of his best friend Matthew (played by a very young Don Johnson, later of Miami Vice), he creates somewhat of a reputation for himself.  The resident outlaws, known as the Crackers, begin to feel threatened by Zachariah's skills as a gunslinger.

Based on the god-awful dialogue, Zachariah and Matthew's relationship is ambigously gay (though director Englund probably did not intend this to be so) and this seems to produce the most laughs.

So what makes this film a must see?  The inclusion of drummer Elvin Jones -- who spent much of his illustrious career as John Coltrane's percussionist -- is its greatest asset.  Jones plays the role of Job Cain, a true outlaw with mad drumming skills (as he demonstrates in the film). His influence on Don Johnson's character is so powerful that he is able to separate the ambigously gay duo temporarily and turn them into rivals.

The other cool aspect of this film (which makes it worth purchasing) has to be all of the scenes with County Joe MacDonald and his psychedlic group, The Fish.  Here, Country Joe and the Fish play a group of no-good outlaws, who happen to be rock musicians and go by the name of The Crackers.

The opening scene --with The James Gang playing an intense rock tune in the middle of the desert -- is also quite memorable and is slightly reminiscent of Pink Floyd at Pompeii or one of Can's obscure music films.

Patricia Quinn (a.k.a. Alice from Alice's Restaurant) works well as the character Belle Star, a strumpet who runs the local brothel.  Her band, The New York Rock Ensemble, also has one memorable scene.

Watch this movie for the wonderful music and have a few laughs along the way.",1105315200,12,2300,4.861538461538461
1328799,5,B00003ETIU,"""Zachariah"" has remained one of the most vivid memories of my teenage cinematic years. And I only saw it once. As a 14-year-old in 1970, it was perfectly timed to take advantage of the growing fusion of rock, drugs, rebellion, free love and good times that were evolving through the culture. And it packaged them up in a funny, satirical fashion that was uniquely themed as a Western. I still remember one of the gunfight songs ""Zachariah, Zachariah don't go to Apache Wells; 19's tried and 19's died, and you'll make only one.""
If you're a hippie product of the 70s era, ""Zachariah"" is a must see, as much for the fun, gags and drug references, as for the actors who went on to further stardom whether in movies or television.",1073347200,21,727,4.557251908396947
1328800,2,B00003ETIU,"You know, I've even shown this to fellow fans of the Firesign Theatre, who purportedly wrote this piece of dreck, and even THEY can't find much to like about it. (Peter Bergman appears as a bartender for about five seconds.)
Don Johnson, who looks fresh out of high school, and John Rubinstein, who looks fresh out of rehab, play gunslingers in a town that is OBVIOUSLY just flats with no actual buildings. That's the cool, groovy, 60s point, get it? It's just a movie, maaaan.
And it's a movie that's more interesting to watch from a stunned, ""why did they make this"" sense of wonder than from a ""boy, I sure like 60s Westerns"" point of view. Called the ""first Rock and Roll Western,"" it's more a kind of surreal trip of a film, with smoke-hazed nods to Bunuel and Peckinpah.
One thing about the relationship between the two friends/gunslingers/eventual enemies that is a little creepy is that there seems to be a kind of ""more than just friends, nudge nudge"" feeling to their relationship. Your milage may vary.
I'm not going to bother to tell you what it's about, since it doesn't really matter. All I know is, I have never loaned a DVD to so many people and had them all give me the same reaction: ""Get This Piece of ... out of my house!""  That alone keeps it from being a one-star movie.

1328801,2,B00003ETIU,"Zachariah is a cult,college circuit,head movie designed to appeal to pot-smoking. meaning of life seeking, Herman Hesse reading neo-hippies circa 1970.  It was billed as the first Electic Western.  On DVD it's called the First and Only Electric Western. There's a reason for this....

Zachariah is pretty tame stuff.  Too tame.  It's rated PG and has a couple of shots of nudity, some drug use and mild display of violence but it's not a very innovative work.  There's a little satiric homage to 2001 in the beginning of the film (where an amplifier is photographed like the 2001 monolith)but don't get your hopes up for too many moments like this--they aren't here. The Firesign theater did contribute to the script but a few good ideas and scenes (like Dick Van Patten's Horse salesman cameo) aren't enough.  The use of rock music in a period piece wasn't a first, but it was almost a new idea. There's some hard rock, folk rock, country rock, classical rock, and some old fashioned fiddling too. It's pretty good but not particularly memorable.
You might enjoy it as a piece of nostalgia, or you might enjoy it as an entertaining so bad it's kinda' good movie. But for a real trippy 'head' movie track down a copy of 'El Topo' instead.  Don Johnson who looks like he's 15 (He was 21 or 22) has a major but not starring role in the film.  Johnson was in a lot of quirky films from The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart (1970) to Zachariah (1971) to  the Harrad Experiment  (1973) to the notable A Boy and His Dog (1975) before hitting the big time with Miami Vice in  the early 1980's.
Zachariah is a farmer (John Rubinstein) who dreams of being a wild-west gunfighter.  After getting his gun via mail-order, he teams up with his old friend the blacksmith, Mathew (Don Johnson) to seek their fortunes.
Psychologicaly the film is a hoot.  The gun of course being symbolic of  one's manhood and the friendship between  Mathew and Zachariah being thinly disguised homo-eroticism at it's clumsiest.  There's a montage where they share the joys of gun slinging that is high camp classic (as is the films finale').  They team up and pursue The Crackers, a well known gang of outlaws who also happen to be a rock and roll band. The Crackers are played by the once well known Country Joe and the Fish (the band's claim to fame was the  ""F"" cheer at Woodstock and the I'm Fixin' to Die Rag anti Vietnam anthem).
The Crackers play at a local bar and one of the patrons hates their music and picks a fight with Zachariah.  It's the squares versus the hippies set in the old West.  This leads to a gunfight.  Zachariah wins and decides he's a tough gunfighter.  They join the Crackers.  The Crackers however aren't very good outlaws.  In a forced montage set to a rocked up William Tell Overture, The Crackers are seen being incompetent outlaws, failing to rob a stage coach, and then ambushing a Pony Express rider  stripping him of his mail and his clothes.
Zachariah and Mathew come up with a plan and they pull off a bank robbery.  Zachariah needs more out of life though.  He's sure he has a destiny, though he doesn't know what it is.  Shades of Herman Hesse's Sidhartha.  The search for one's true self is on.  In this case Zachariah wants to learn how to be a great gunfighter from one of the most notorious gunfighters in the West... a man named Job Cain.  We know Cain is good because there's a $50,000 bounty on his head.

The names are downright biblical aren't they?
Job Cain turns out to be Elvin Jones who hangs out with the James Gang.  He does an impressive and long drum solo after winning a gunfight....  The James Gang dress in cooler leather outfits and have lots of good looking woman groupies hanging around.  However, even after Zachariah proves himself worthy to Job Cain's challenge he's not fulfilled.  He and his friend Mathew go their separate ways.  Mathew stays to become part of the gang.
Zachariah spends some time with an old man in the middle of nowhere, and then goes to a strange border town to meet some ladies.  The town is interesting, but the film gets really silly during this sequence and Pat Quinn does a very bad imitation of Mae West  as Belle Star, Queen of the Whores.  Zacharia is coiffed and decked out like  a countrified Siegried and Roy  with a big white cowboy hat complete with a large feather. If you ever wondered what Liberace as a cowboy would look like the answer can be found right here.  He then woos Belle Star and decides of course that she is not what he is looking for in life either.
This all leads to... well I don't to spoil the film. . . let's just say if you like high camp you'll have a great time at the end of this film.
If you can laugh AT the film, you'll have a pretty good time with it.  If you can't, the film's charms (assuming you found a few in the film) evaporate completely after the first 45 minutes.
It's an odd hybrid of a film which boils down to a story of two friends searching for themselves and discovering friendships are perhaps most important of all.  It's cornball stuff. The film has more unintentional laughs than earned ones.  It never quite clicks as an exploitation type film ala' Roger Corman's  Psyche Out or The Trip, nor is it a Cheech and Chong Out West type of thing.  It's also not as fun, manic or funny as Blazing Saddles is either.  They almost do a funny campfire scene though.
The DVD is a bare-bones no extra affair.  The film looks and sounds okay, but there are enough instances of grain, edge enhancement, etc to warn the pickier among you of the problems.(. . .)",1006214400,9,5571,4.48807157057654
