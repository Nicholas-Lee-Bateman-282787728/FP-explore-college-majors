8587504,4,B00CYI4L42,The only reason why I believe you should stay away from this 20 dollar movie is because its the same one when you get the box set . Same cover art slip in the cseason one .  So if you buy both volumes sepretly u are paying more then the boxset if its 30 dollars . The only way I find it financially feasible if the price of the boxset goes up to 50 dollars other then that . There's really no special features and the DVD box set is cram with about 26 episodes in this one .,1378857600,3,474,3.787878787878788
8587505,4,B00CYI4L42,"I was so excited to see that Amazon has listed the language as ""Japanese"" for this set, and of course I pre-ordered immediately, as I have been looking for the original Japanese version with good English subtitles for years. :)
However, I did a little research into this product and on many other sites people are claiming this product will be the English-dubbed 4kids version only. ):
If that is the case, I will be very displeased with Amazon's false advertising and will be making a return promptly.
If this product does contain the Japanese language version of the show, however, I will be very happy and sure to reccomend it to friends. :)",1374796800,4,644,4.657894736842105
