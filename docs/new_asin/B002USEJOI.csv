8381515,1,B002USEJOI,"Sorry, this wasn't what I expected.  It consisted of a computer screen powerpoint outline with woman's voice over.  Not even a pleasant voice.

I regret the purchase, and I regret having opened the package as now I apparently cannot return it.",1273968000,,432,5.114285714285714
