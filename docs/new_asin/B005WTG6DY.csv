4899881,1,B005WTG6DY,"I took a Stretch and Tone class at our local gym and loved it. I was hoping it would be a combination of the two, but instead it's 3 different workouts--and I mean WORKouts! These are not intended for low impact, like I was hoping. The stretching portion is great, but I already owned that DVD that has the AM and PM stretches.",1400716800,2,327,4.2063492063492065
4899882,5,B005WTG6DY,3 different levels and they are all great and easy to follow.  Take your time building up but be consistent and you'll soon notice the benefits.  For beginners/intermediate folks get at least 2 blocks and a wrap to help with certain positions/stretches.,1386460800,2,253,5.0
4899883,4,B005WTG6DY,"I just finished going through this DVD for the first time and had some things I liked and some disappointments. The Stretch part was an excellent slow, thorough stretch. It would be great for those who have a limited range of motion, recovering from an injury, or just beginning to exercise. It is also a good all-over stretch for anyone, although it is longer than I usually spend stretching, because I get enough stretch from yoga, usually one of Rodney Yee's DVDs.

The second part, the ""Flex"" section by Rodney Yee, is great. In fact, I already own two copies of Rodney Yee's Power Yoga Flexibility. I didn't need another one. It's worth the price of the whole DVD if you don't have it.

The third part was the ""tone"" section, kind of a ""walk-it-out"", now ""walk-it-out with your knees a little higher"", warm-up where you keep raising your knees a little higher as you warm up, to increase your heart rate, and then a boxer's shuffle. I don't do those because they hurt my knees. Eventually you get into work with some small weights, with motivational encouragement. I have a different cardio and strength workout in place already, so that one didn't appeal to me for my own purposes.

All-in-all, the value of this DVD will depend on your needs and your preferences.",1331164800,19,1270,4.660714285714286

8488095,5,B005WTG6DY,I have done two of these three workouts so far and I really like them!  The first one I've done a number of times and I will keep doing it as it has great stretches and they are different then what I am used to so I am working different muscles. :),1474934400,,248,3.769230769230769
