2697824,4,B000KWZ1NY,"""The Mickey Rooney Show/Hey Mulligan"" was a half hour sitcom that ran on NBC for 39 episodes during the 1954-55 season. The show lasted only a single season, becoming a ratings victim to the immensely popular ""The Jackie Gleason Show"" on CBS. The premise of the show has Rooney starring as Michael ""Mickey"" Mulligan, a studio page working at the fictional IBC television network who dreams of becoming a serious dramatic actor. The show's humor is derived from the situations in which Mulligan finds himself at both home and work. Regis Toomey and Claire Carleton are Mulligan's loving and supportive parents, while John Hubbard is his boss at IBC, Carla Balenda is his romantic interest, and Joey Forman is his best friend and fellow page at IBC. Forman is a very good second banana to Rooney and much of the funnier situations in this show involve the two pages. Look for early guest star roles from Guy Williams (""Zorro,"" ""Lost in Space"") and Angie Dickinson (""Police Woman"") in these episodes. In fact, Ms. Dickinson's appearance as a secretary in the episode titled ""The Executive"" is her very first credited television role.

This budget release, a two-DVD, ten-episode set from the Timeless Media Group, is a condensed version of a larger set also offered by Timeless,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mickey-Rooney-Show-Hey-Mulligan/dp/B000VKLXRS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mickey Rooney Show ""Hey Mulligan""</a>, which includes 30 episodes spread across three DVDs and includes some extra features which are not included in this ""bare bones"" set. All of the episodes in this set are also replicated in the larger set. I was greatly surprised by the audio/visual quality of this set; it is very near the quality that one would expect from the major studios, and all of the episodes appear to be complete and uncut (but do not include original commercials). Given the show's comparative obscurity, this is a very good release (and a nice surprise).

Mickey Rooney fans will want the larger 30-episode collection of ""Hey Mulligan,"" but casual fans of 1950s sitcoms will enjoy this ""sampler"" set. While ""The Mickey Rooney Show/Hey Mulligan"" isn't among television's top-tier sitcoms, it definitely has its moments and, combined with a very good audio/visual presentation, easily earns my four star rating.",1208217600,2,2359,5.390243902439025

2697826,5,B000KWZ1NY,"This is such a cute show.  I'm so happy to own all the episodes on DVD now.  Thanks Timeless Media.  This company rocks too by the way.

Mickey Rooney is hilarious in these great shows as he is in everything.
If you love Mickey Rooney and great 50's comedy, you will love this little show.

Sadly, it was short lived.  It should have lasted longer.  Mickey Rooney is charming and as lovable as Andy Hardy.

Please buy this set.  The cost is great and it's WELL WORTH the money!",1192060800,10,477,4.269662921348314
2697827,5,B000KWZ1NY,"I enjoyed all ten epidodes of Hey Mulligan which I remember from my childhood. Mickey Rooney is great in this show and Joey Forman  , and  the rest of the cast are funny as well. The source material is very clear and enjoyable to watch. I hope it's true that the whole series is coming out on DVD soon - ten episodes only whetted my appetite. And while the're at it, how about The People's Choice, and It's A Great Life.",1188864000,2,420,4.172839506172839

8159280,3,B000KWZ1NY,"In 1955 35 year old Mickey decided he'd revive Andy Hardy as a weekly tv show. Mickey Mulligan lives with his parents ( who do not look old enough to have a 35 year old)! He works at a theater as an usher. He likes the young woman who works with him at the theater. Another usher is his pal.
The stories are very simple and harmless. They are similar to Andy Hardy but less effective on the very low budget of this tv show. Some are strange. In one, Mickey and his buddy build a rocket, get in it and actually expect to visit the moon!
The copies floating around out there are old 16mm prints. Therefore, the quality isn't the best.
By the way, the only reason why this program lasted only one season was because it was up against tough competition ( I believe it was against the hugely popular the Ed Sullivan Show). Hey Mulligan had impressive ratings but aired for one season. Mickey expressed that he really didn't care that the show was canceled.
If you like old TV, Mickey Rooney, or family type entertainment, and don't mind less than perfect quality, Hey Mulligan is for you!",1486425600,,1083,4.366336633663367
8159281,5,B000KWZ1NY,"Great packaging. Nice menus. Is it just my disc or does the 'Mickey Rooney Interview' stop after playing a two minute b/w preview?
It's also a shame we didn't get the entire series. It would have been nice to have every episode in one place. I would also like to the 1964 series released some day.",1439510400,,297,4.321428571428571
8159282,5,B000KWZ1NY,Just love this classic TV show. Rooney is worth watching in everything he does. I was never aware of this little gem until some searching.,1391558400,,138,4.56
8159283,2,B000KWZ1NY,"This is an older black & white tv series and unfortunately it shows. I like Mickey, especially in his ""Andy Hardy"" type roles which this tries to be, but the film quality is somewhat faded and weak and that just takes away from the enjoyment of the show for me. It's not the worse quality i've ever seen but it doesn't have that good clear look to it. Well, the price is certainly right if you don't mind the quality level being somewhat poor. I am picky about quality.",1385337600,,469,4.280898876404494
8159284,4,B000KWZ1NY,Mickey Rooney is one of the great comedians of old and I still enjoy the old comedy shows from the fifties and sixties. They are all class and 100% better than any crap on tv today. Good price for dvd.,1374710400,,201,4.05
8159285,4,B000KWZ1NY,"Mickey Rooney made a lot of TV appearances as a guest on other people's shows -- and won acclaim in the Rod Serling-scripted drama The Comedian, but he never was able to sustain a long running regular series.

The one with the most potential for longevity was The Mickey Rooney Show - Hey Mulligan! (having two titles made things confusing right there). It ran one season in 1954-55 on NBC against The Jackie Gleason Show on CBS.

Each show began with someone shouting ""Hey Mulligan!,"" a title format adopted over a decade later on That Girl. I don't know if those ""Hey Culligan Man!"" commercials had any connection or not. Anyway, Rooney played a twentysomething Andy Hardy living with his parents (played by Regis Toomey and , courting a longtime girlfriend (Carla Balenda) and somehow keeping a job as a network page for a fictional TV network.

The network page idea is a great one for a sitcom, not fully realized again until 30 Rock, though Rooney plays it strictly for broad slapstick. Blake Edwards wrote many of the episodes, foreshadowing the legendary success he had with another bumbling character, Inspector Clouseau.

Guest cast members included Angie Dickinson, Guy Williams (Zorro, Lost in Space); Alan Reed (The Flintstones); Pat Carroll (The Little Mermaid, Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella); and Robert Shayne (The Adventures of Superman).

One of the strongest assets of The Mickey Rooney Show was the underrated Joey Forman as his ""Ethel Mertz."" Forman became a favorite featured player in sitcoms and movies of the '60s (Harry Hoo of Get Smart among others) and was a very talented comic actor. This series doesn't maximize his talents as much as it could, but he and Rooney have a good chemistry and it would have been nice to see how the series progressed had it lasted.

Why didn't it last? The competition, first of all, but perhaps more than that, it was an incident in which Rooney was rude to the sponsor at a social gathering. He described it very honestly in his autobiography, Life is Too Short. He felt as if he was being pressed into service as a performer for their social amusement and chose a very off putting way to strike out at the president of the company.

Interesting series, available complete in one DVD set that also includes an interview with Rooney about his career that touches briefly on the show and trailers from his theatrical films.",1288396800,4,2388,4.823960880195599
8159286,5,B000KWZ1NY,"Mickey Rooney fans will love his TV series. Very funny!!This 1954/55 series gives you 3 discs with 10 episodes on each disc plus a bonus extra on each disc. one extra being a Mickey Rooney interview. I never seen his TV series before and decided to buy it just because I really like his movies. I loved it! My husband and kids really like it too, they really never knew Mickey Rooney until now. This was fun to watch with the family We laugh so hard we cried, He is really such a great talent the younger generation can enjoy him too. This is a very good buy for the young and old.",1234742400,6,581,4.150442477876106
8159287,4,B000KWZ1NY,The show is as hilarious as I remember it. It's just a shame that they couldn't have included the missing episodes. Maybe they'll pop up some day.,1227571200,2,146,4.444444444444445
8159288,4,B000KWZ1NY,"""Hey Mulligan"" may not match up with the best shows of the 50's like ""The Honeymooners"" and ""Gunsmoke"", but it does have one terrific thing going for it and that's Mickey Rooney. Mickey's got all of his usual energy, enthusiasm, and wonderful comedy instincts on display here. Sure, he's a little too old for the character, Mulligan is supposed to be in his early 20's and Mickey looks like he's 35 or so, but a good actor can make you forget about that, and that's exactly what Mickey does. It's got lots of 50's humor, and that's not everybody's cup of tea, but if you like Mickey Rooney and/or 50's TV then you will enjoy it. The picture quality is nothing to rave about, it's just OK.

As for the special features, on the first disc there is a highly enjoyable interview with Mickey that runs 27 minutes. On the 2nd disc there are two skits with Mickey and Red Skelton from Red's show, the first one is B&W and runs 17 minutes and the second one is in color and runs 10 minutes. The third disc has 11 Mickey Rooney movie trailers. All in all a very enjoyable DVD set.",1226102400,4,1071,4.3283582089552235
