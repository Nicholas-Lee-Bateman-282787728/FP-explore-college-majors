1818413,5,B00007L4KG,"...I absolutely loved this movie. It's debaucherous, hedonistic, and maybe even masochistic (wow, that's a lot of ..words there...)
A few various opinions:
I laughed out loud a lot during this movie (Paul and Dick were especially great).
I thought Van Der Beek was perfect for the role and played it well.
Roger Avery did a great job with the camera. His unusual style brought an unusual book to life in a very vivid fashion.
In closing, I told my parents NOT to see this film. It would offend the hell out of my mom, and I figure that most people will be offended by its honest view of college, sex, drugs, and the massive amounts of stupidity involved with those things. But that's ok, I didn't want this movie to be something I could recommend to my Mom.
When people ask me what I thought of the movie I tell them I loved it,...",1038355200,5,831,4.367741935483871
1818414,5,B00007L4KG,"After being force-fed the trailer for this movie- i had little to no interest in paying ...to see it.  i simply couldn't shake the images of teen idols giving movie-of-the-week performances in a hodge-podge of Cruel Intentions, Varsity Blues and American Pie.  That darned Puddle of Mud song ""She Hates Me"" playing in the background while Jessica Biel jumps around like an idiot seemed to sum up what i thought the movie was going to be.
it was none of these things.
The film was arty, well-acted, and utterly disturbing.  If you are into these things (movies like Fight Club, Trainspotting, etc.)- this film really is refreshing.  The subject matter verges on the trite: college students gone wild, but the visuals and surprising talents of the cast save the film from depths of the late night commercial.
Get over your first impression of the movie, get ready to laugh, get ready to be grossed out, and get ready to disturbed.  Then, be ready to be strangely fulfilled.",1035158400,4,971,4.790419161676646
1818415,3,B00007L4KG,"The Rules of Attraction wants to be a better movie. It really does. I know I  want it to be a better movie. And that just frustrates me, because it has so much potential, so many good ideas, but just doesn't fully realize them.
The story, a satirical look at the lives of college students as many really are, uses actors normally portraying the more idealistic or silly versions of students in unrealistic films. The concept is great, just not flushed out enough.
My likes and dislikes begin right away as the three primary characters are introduced at a big party, showing a character in a scene, then the film going in reverse to see another at the exact same moment. It's a great visual way to show the simultaneous nature of their situations, but it's overused. After you get the idea, the film is still going backwards, and it becomes boring. Fortunately, many other gimmicky devices are handled better, and do have a point.
But my biggest problem is that the story is centered on three characters and their relationships together, yet they're rarely together in the film. They are always off with other people doing other things. While it gives them great character development and offers some great scenes, the three primary characters never really seem connected until the very end. This affects the impact the film should have delivered.
What's good about it though are the performances the actors give. James Van Der Beek is great in his sinister, almost frightening role of Sean Bateman. Shannyn Sossamon is equally as impressive as a pretty, nice, grunge-wearing student. Perhaps, though, Ian Somerhalder as a gay student in love with Bateman gives the most touching performance. You feel more sorry for him in his impossible wishes then anyone else.
Also, there are some great visual devices used to display symbolism. Several times in the film, a shot with intense meaning will make you want to  love the film. And that's why I find it so upsetting that it didn't live up to its potential. There is just so much to love here. If the film had built a better cohesiveness among its primary characters, it would be great. As is, however, it's only mediocre. And a mediocre film with great potential is such a waste when so many films aren't even promising.",1035158400,,2267,4.765903307888041
1818416,5,B00007L4KG,"The Rules of Attraction plays out like some over-indulgent exercise in film style.  But somewhere along the way I loved it.  Maybe its the dead-on observations, the voiceovers that are just long enough to not become intrusive and pretentious.  Maybe it is the flagrantly brilliant character introductions.  Maybe its the way the scenes take complete left-turns from their supposed pre-ordained destinations.  Maybe its how a simple act of ripping a note can become a singularly despicable and depressing thing.  Maybe its because when you're watching it, you're thinking ""I shouldn't like this"" but you do anyway.  All of these things and more are here for your viewing.  Its a wonderful film, as wonderful as a movie about sex-crazed deviant drug-addicted college students can be.  It's poignant in very very odd ways.  Where else can you watch a movie where you enter a mans thoughts as he is having sex, and he says ""I can't remember the last time I had sex sober""  That quote was magnificent, brilliance, that line alone sums up the entire character.  Stuff like this is why I go to the movies.  One can make the accusation that this movie is over-directed, you'll get no argument from me.  The visual tricks utilized are occasionally just boring.  But when the trickery hits brilliance, aka Victors introduction.  Then you just have to take the winners with the losers.  Watch this movie without any pre-conceived notion of what it will be, and you'll be surprised, its not really a comedy, its funny but not laugh out loud.  It's more sad funny.  But it hits you hard, especially after walking out and realizing what you have just watched, not much does that these days, and I'm not exaggerating.",1034985600,2,1702,4.867595818815331
1818417,5,B00007L4KG,"While most people that i've talked to think of this movie as a comedy before they've seen it, it definatly was not. the previews may have been somewhat misleading, but im still very glad i saw it. one of the best movies ive seen all year. the deep twisting plot of college relationship angst was just amazing...",1034985600,,311,4.473684210526316
1818418,4,B00007L4KG,"After watching the first 10 minutes of Rules Of Attraction, the new movie based on the novel by Bret Easton Ellis, the man behind the twisted American Psycho,I felt like walking out. However, once it got out of the atrocious opening, I found myself quite involved in this very strange, messed up, teen film about love,sex,death, drugs, and of course, rock and roll.
James Van Der Beek, Jesssica Biehl, and Shannyn Sossoman are excellent playing against type. Ian Somerhalder as Paul is the best character in the movie, and has a shot at becoming one of Hollywoods best young actors. Their really is no plot so its pointless for me to try to explain it, so all I can say is that if you like totally [messed] up movies, then this is the one for you.",1034467200,,747,4.5
1818419,5,B00007L4KG,"In one word, WOW! this film will be remembered much in the way FIGHT CLUB is rmembered now. Here it goes...Sean Bateman (James Van Der Beek, good old Dawson), brother to AMERICAN PSYCHO's Patrick Bateman, goes to New England's Camden College. Lauren Hynde (Shannyn Sossamon, Angelina Jolie's twin from A KNIGHT'S TALE and FORTY DAYS AND FORTY NIGHTS) and Paul Denton (Ian Somerhalder) also go to Camden and happen to be at the same party Sean is at. They are all at the End of the World party (the Camden Christmas bash) and they all are celebrating different things, which we find out through a flashback to the start of the semester.
  Sean has been getting love letters from a mysterious girl and he is slowly falling in love, while dealing cocaine and screwing anyone he can on the side, even though he doesn't seem satisified with his decisions. He assumes that Lauren has been slipping him the letters, but she has her eyes set on Victor (Kip Pardue of REMEMBER THE TITANS and um, DRIVEN), who happens to be in Europe screwing every foreigner in sight and taking every drug known to man. Paul is in love with Sean, but Sean doesn't seem to notice. Sean's more interested in getting more pot and geting laid.
  James Van Der Beek couldn't have picked a better role to make people forget about Dawson's Creek. This role is about as un-Dawson Leery as he can get and he fits like a glove. He really embodied the character. He is great in this film and deserves an Oscar nom but the fact is that no one will even think to give it to him just because he is a Creeker.
  The movie is extremely fun to watch! Director Roger Avary has made an amazingly DARK, comedy. this ian't no ROAD TRIP or AMERICAN PIE that's for sure. Even if this film doesn't become a success atthe theatres it WILL (definately) on video and deservingly so. Oh yeah, teh soundtrack is awesome and Fred Savage is brillant in his cameo as the guy with no money (you'll see). you know what I think....Rock and roll!",1034380800,,1984,4.481994459833795
1818420,5,B00007L4KG,"Where to begin? Simply put this movie is amazing if you're a fan of dark humor and edgy filmmaking. Roger Avery does such a great job with his cast of WB brats. He turns them into shallow college brats. The movie revolves around sex, drugs, parties, and more sex. Also deals with suicide due to unrequited love. That part was probably the most gruesome and sad, but also very affecting. James Van Der Beek blew me away, I never would have guessed this is the guy who plays sappy Dawson. And Russell Sams steals the movie with his portrayal of Richard...er I mean Dick. That 10 minutes alone makes this movie worth going to see. I highly recommend it, but not to the squemish or the prude, you'll have wasted your money.",1034380800,2,719,4.454545454545454
1818421,5,B00007L4KG,"This year's most original and creative movies, The Rules Of Attraction, in a certain sense, ""rules"" A must see for anyone in college, for thats the basis of the film. The movie follows three main characters, Sean Bateman, (the brother of American Psycho's Patrick Bateman), Paul, and Lauren. Sean is a drug dealer who is recieving love letters from a woman throughout the movie, and runs into many different sexual and drug related situations. Paul is bisexual, (although men is what he's mostly looking for), hes gotta crush on Sean, but Sean will only smoke w/ him, he has no interest in him sexually. Lauren, whos still a virgin and whos boyfriend has been in Europe for quite a while, decides maybe she should pursue other men, one of those men being Sean.
The film has a very creative style in inrtoducing its main characters, the first segment, which is really the end of the film, follows each one during a party, one at a time, then reverses literally to follow the next character, its really quite amazing, and probably a lot less confusing watching it than reading it.

The point of it is to express the meaninglessness of existence when you are so caught up in your own world you can't even rationalize staying alive. It's just a jumble. Maybe you can't relate, and yes, the movie seems to bite off a little more than it can chew. Have you ever tried to figure out why the great girl is so attracted to the jerk, despite red flag after red flag popping up in front of our faces? It doesn't make sense to us. That's why it's powerful.

This movie was based off of an author trying to make sense of it all and translating his or her experience into fiction. No one who has ever experienced that level of sadness or nihilism could possibly understand. Go to the movies, spend 13 dollars on a small popcorn, and enjoy the bright animation of the latest pixar cash cow. You won't have to think at all.",1471392000,4,989,4.311827956989247

I seriously wanted to call my adult son and tell him to stay away from any college campus - ever. Not get into cars with strange men. Don't ever take someone to your room/home/apartment to smoke a joint. If it's a guy, especially a 'pretty' guy, he will want to get you out of your pants.
 I had to stop myself at this point and tell myself that the world that Brett Easton Ellis creates in a story and that ends up on the screen does not necessarily represent the real world. Not even a small part of the real world.
 It may be a good representation of life in a maximum security prison, filled with men who despair of ever seeing the sun, have realized they may never touch a real woman, wouldn't know how to talk to such a woman if they were face to face with her, and learn to numb themselves with drugs.",1469750400,,1033,4.185929648241206

1818505,2,B00007L4KG,"First, let me point out some aspects of the movie that the viewer can expect to be well done.
1. The ending credits seemed to be formatted and spelled correctly.
2. The girl from 7th Heaven (I think) does some gymnastics in her dorm room. She does not fall down.

Apparently this is a film adaptation of a book. People may say that I need to read the book to ""get it.""
Let me address that defense first: No, I don't.

Unless there is a disclaimer at the beginning that says ""This movie is going to range from nonsensical to pointless unless you read the book,"" the producers, writers, and directors must have meant for it to stand on its own as a piece of artistic expression.
In this regard (and most others), the movie fails completely.

In 1999, filmmakers precisely and unforgettably encapsulated the confusing, chaotic world of contemporary young adult angst, drug use, and violence by starting a story at the end and filling in the shocking backstory as the movie progressed. This film starred some of the most recognizable young actors who each in his or her own way represented an aspect of the youth culture as it struggled toward maturity and adulthood. Perhaps most notably, this work featured a member of the Dawson's Creek cast.

That movie was Go.

Three years later, someone apparently thought they could reproduce the success of Go by cherry-picking the most superficial aspects of the concept, dropping in another Dawson's Creek cast member, adding a healthy scoop of other unemployed former WB stars, and finally mixing in a bucket of pure contempt for the audience.
Set your oven to ""obnoxious"" for twenty minutes as we are subjected to prolonged clips of the sights and sounds of people aimlessly milling around -- IN REVERSE!! -- to drive home the point that SOME THINGS WE ARE SEEING HAPPENED BEFORE THE THING WE SAW FIRST. Some films use sped-up smash cuts, narration, or titles to indicate some unexpected time shift. Not The Rules of Attraction! We need to watch - and hear - a guy walking backwards in snow for what seems like an eternity.

Oh, but speaking of text, we are reliably informed several times that we are viewing events taking place at ""THE END OF THE WORLD PARTY!"" Is that supposed to have some sort of significance to us? Was this supposed to be taking place in the winter of 1999 as we approached the fabled Y2K disaster? Probably. I don't know. Maybe it was in the book, or the movie explained it and I was already so apathetic that the information couldn't enter my brain.

Then things get really good as we set our oven to ""zzzzzz"" for about an hour and a half while sociopaths batter us with their pretentious internal dialogue and behave in ways approaching human but probably better suited for juvenile aliens attempting to infiltrate Earthling society. No one has clear motivations for anything they do, and they constantly sound like they're making up a lie on the spot. I can never tell if someone is trying to portray insincerity or she is just an awful actor. Given the rest of the evidence against the film, I default to the latter.

But then we get to the final fifteen minutes when all of the inconsistencies, plot holes, and confusion get neatly and artfully resolved! We are left alone with the deep philosophical insight we just received as well as a sadness to see the characters we have grown so close to disappear into the angsty sunset.

Oh, wait, I was thinking of a good movie. This one just flings philosophical poo at us while we sit motionless, spiritually broken, pondering whether humanity deserves to exist.",1460419200,,3578,4.6847133757961785

And if you are a fan of Ellis, you'll recognize that Van Der Beak's character is the sociopathic brother of the ""American Psycho"", a dramatic take on the fact that sociopathy and psychopathy are hereditary, and depending on incidents in one's childhood, can flick into psychotic killing-mode, or functioning, less agressive psychopathy.

Consequently, a film where every character is deeply flawed and narcissistic is never boring, and often full of a visceral energy.  It even has moments where it becomes quite moving.  And most of the showy style tricks work with the excesses of the story.

OK, sometimes the style is self-concious, and some elements are too familiar and on the nose (Faye Dunaway and Swoozie Kurtz as boozy moms who choose not to see how screwed up their kids are, the extra shallow treatment of the gay character. etc).

While I understand how some could be repulsed, personally I think this deserved better than it got from most critics.  I enjoyed watching it, was never bored, and even made to think.

1818529,2,B00007L4KG,"In my college town in the 1980s, the bar we frequented was across the street from the dorms. We would literally walk to the establishment and more often than not stumble home at midnight to relative safety. Sneaking girls into the boys' dorm or sneaking into a girl's dorm room was commonplace, if not ponderous. So while quite a bit of ""Rules of Attraction"" was authentic, many of the parties shown are so over the top as to be some form of allegoric fantasy.

I have not read Bret Easton Ellis' book (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rules-of-Attraction/dp/067978148X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rules of Attraction</a>), though did read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Less-Than-Zero/dp/0679781498/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Less Than Zero</a>&nbsp;followed by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Psycho/dp/0679735771/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Psycho</a>, which was enough for me. I have read critics stating ""The Rules of Attraction"" is Ellis' best work, and certainly a Matt Dillon feature he penned for Interview magazine displayed a level of skill far above his generation.

I did not like the numerous gimmicks director Roger Avary threw at us, an almost desperate attempt to insert some kind of hip meaning into a lost generation far removed from any form of decency or humanity. The one person with romantic ideals commits suicide in a scene so detailed as to be indulgent. Avary doesn't really play fair with these characters or scenes, and his attempts at satire with Swoosie Kurtz and Faye Dunaway as pill-popping moms exposes considerable weaknesses in his craft.

These kids flex, growl and give us nice Jack Torrance/Jack Nicholson stares, but it is anger without meaning, painted with unnecessarily stylish strokes. What you're going for here is something to akin to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/River-s-Edge-Blu-ray/dp/B00OZ8XGQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">River's Edge [Blu-ray</a>] or even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quadrophenia/dp/B00A5IYC38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quadrophenia</a>. But those films had soul, if not an incredible recreation of a time and place.

I completely relate to the reality that many college kids (and I was one of them) do not have the capacity for respectful love due to an intense self-loathing. Such seeds were planted in my own youth prior to those chaotic and wonderful college years. You will not find a hint of those seeds in ""The Rules of Attraction."" This may strike a chord for young moviegoers. It could surprise me and evolve into an anthem of doomed youth. My guess is they'll outgrow it soon enough.",1418083200,2,2803,6.387862796833773

P: The lives of four college students centered around three parties.

In The Rules of Attraction, the characters walk backwards and everything around them moves backwards as the film rewinds the events that have just unfolded. In another scene, a split screen is used to show what two different characters are doing prior to meeting one another. In one montage, a characters entire trip to Europe is told & visualized in less then 5 minutes.  What I am getting at is this, the The Rules of Attraction is a flashy film that uses flashy storytelling, a flashy soundtrack and a star studded cast in flashy roles to tell a story of teenagers and college students living a flashy lifestyle.

The problem is, that all of these flashy elements stop us from getting a sense of who the film's main characters truly are. They are squarely defined by who they are sleeping with or who they want to sleep with. There's no depth, no substance amongst all the the flash.

On the other hand, all this flash leads to a mighty entertaining film, one that never bores. The film always has some kind of cinematic trick up its sleeve from a harrowing suicide sequence, to sharp dialogue, to all kinds of crazy sexual encounters, to seeing good ol' boy James van der Beek of Dawson's Creek fame playing a decidedly unappealing character who makes reprehensible life choices.

The Rules of Attraction is a film that is both fascinating and repellent all at the same time. Roger Avary's storytelling is innovative & cutting edge, yet the characters are shallow & narcissistic, much like the film itself. The Rules of Attraction is a one of a kind movie experience that undoubtedly will hit a real nerve with some people, but when a film gets people thinking and gets people talking, its struck a chord with audiences and challenged them in ways that they didn't quite expect. How often can you say that of a mainstream release that has hit theaters nationwide? --- My point exactly. [R] 110 mins.",1385164800,2,2318,4.826196473551637

This is the one exception!  If fact, the film may even be better than the book.  Ellis himself even said that in an interview once.

No other movie I know captures college as well as this.  You can talk about your classics like Animal House or more modern hits like American Pie.  But all those films deliver a zany, more exaggerated and fantasy-based view of college, in my opinion.

The Rules of Attraction cuts through the fantasy and touches on the dark side of college that goes hand-in-hand with the hijinks.  That's what this film is; it's a dark comedy from start to finish.

I was surprised to go back and read critics' review when the film came out.  Most hated it.  However, I think most of their criticisms were off base.  What I read the most from critics was that the characters are unlikable.  That's somewhat true.  None of the characters are innocent people desperately searching for good.  However, they are very real.  To me, I like the reality over a romanticized portrait with classic heroes and heroines.

1818566,5,B00007L4KG,"I love Bret Easton Ellis.  Seriously.  I mean, I understand that he is rather tactless in his old age (the man will never be old, let's face it) and that his breed of sexual depravity needs a serious update in this modern world, but overall I consider him faultless mainly because he captivated my youth and got me started in what is the most rewarded career path I could have chosen (regardless of the fact that it is not a career yet).  So, I love him.  While `The Rules of Attraction' is not his finest work (that being the super controversial `American Psycho'), it is one of his finer efforts and certainly made for the best film adaptation of his work.

`Less Than Zero' and `American Psycho', while both superior novels, were completely butchered in film form; sadly.

So this brings me to the film adaptation, released in 2002.  Using a flirty and witty construction and utilizing Ellis's love for sex, drugs and rock and roll, `The Rules of Attraction' is pungent, sour and infectiously delightful.  The story is basically a love triangle of the most bizarre kind.  You have Lauren, a young `virgin' withholding herself for her man-whore boyfriend who is off on a backpacking trip where he basically sleeps with everybody (and we see this in a very speedy three or so minute clip).  Lauren has caught the eye of Sean, a slacker drug dealer who has real skeletons in the closet (thank you Bret for interweaving your novels) but who also happens to be deflecting the affections of Paul, a bisexual classmate who has the hots for him.

The slippery decline of depravity follows suit in a way that is utterly priceless.

The entire cast handles this really well.  The early aughts were a time when quite a few young stars were trying to make a lasting impression, and Shannyn Sossamon was one of them.  Sadly, she disappeared, but after `A Knights Tale' she became a sort of a `thing' and so she gets top billing over the breathtaking Jessica Biel (who plays the college slut) and even Kate Bosworth, both of whom carved out longer lasting careers than Sossamon.  I happen to LOVE Shannyn and wish that her career was reflective of her good looks, because she is quite a looker.  I've never been a fan of `Dawson's Creek', and Van Der Beek's face offends me, but he delivers here in a way I didn't expect.  Still, best in show accolades go to Ian Somerhalder if for that hospital parking lot scene alone.  The man is awesome in this movie and really should have garnered some awards traction.  Alas, this is not an awards movie (although it should have been).

This film's main purpose is in exposing that although it seems cool to everyone to basically act like you do not care, all the characters struggle with their own internal confusion amidst peer pressure. It is visually stunning and original film which highlights backwards progression as well as Victor's europe tour which is a sad reflection and commentary on many experiences American students have when visiting Europe which basically consists of partying and little cultural engagement. The soundtrack is also fantastic and encapsulates the 90s and 00's excellently. It is certainly a pessimistic and dark film where the characters regress instead of progress and ultimately do not find the satisfaction and fulfillment they want in their lives. It was torn apart by critics originally but I think this is a movie that will start to gain traction and recognition as the years progress for its insightful commentary.

1818575,4,B00007L4KG,"I think in the end the question posed by the original 1987 source material, The Rules of Attraction, is all about why its characters miss the point that sex, when devoid of all elements of romance, becomes such an empty thing. While this fast-moving film didn't take that question on, it did give us an expos on how one collection of young people at an exclusive east coast college are willing to trade almost anything to gratify their desires, even if the means they are using to fill the emotional void are really the last things they need. Although they probably don't know it, they are so collectively terrified of ennui that they take any path but the obvious one to find the happiness that's lacking in their lives. It's effectively tragic and also problematic, because in depicting such empty banality, the story itself runs the risk of seeming to be ABOUT this druggy void, when it's simply not at all.

Overall, Roger Avary's movie is a capable adaptation of the 1980s novel. With its split screens and buzzy `80s pop music, it kept up a nearly impossible pace that acted as a stand-in for the paragraph-length chapters Brett Easton Ellis often employed when he penned The Rules of Attraction a generation ago. As written the novel The Rules of Attraction presented some real challenges to anyone wanting to faithfully adapt it to the screen. Much of the story took place inside the thoughts of its characters, important moments existed that would have been all but impossible to successfully translate to celluloid, and great segments of the book came and went without doing much toward moving the plot forward. Also with its vast cast of characters, it could have been a film maker's nightmare to jump into any sort of faithful recreation of what Ellis had in mind. (It is, after all, a novel that opens with the callous defloration of a virgin at a raucous party---""...I always knew it'd be like this....""---and ends with the reunion of two lovers...only one of the lovers scarcely even remembers the other despite the young woman's obsessive infatuation with him.)

I think these considerations explain why no one tried to tackle this book for so long. In my opinion the result of this 2003 attempt to set the novel to screen isn't bad at all. It retains the energy of the book while infusing it with a pace that keeps what works well on the written page working well onscreen. It's momentarily amusing to see James Van Der Beek and Jessica Biel shed their lily-white TV character purity and take on roles as promiscuous drug addicts, but after a few scenes you forget the TV personas and instead notice that both these performers are actually adept actors who bring a convincing performance to the big screen.

In among its sex and drugs, its suicide, its homosexuality, and its post-adolescent dramas tragically real and painfully imagined, The Rules of Attraction has a strong back story to tell, and while it's easy to miss it amid the lure of its surface blur, that back story is worth looking for.",1301961600,2,3016,4.751908396946565

During a few scenes, my friends and I ended up doubled over, laughing until our stomachs hurt. Rules of Attraction is filthy, bombastic, and dark. Bret Easton Ellis has a great talent for satire. Although ridiculous and often disturbing, it's an extreme, entertaining view of college life. I'm glad my mother didn't watch this before I left high school, it probably would have given her nightmares. Don't watch this with your family if you want to avoid awkward silences. The three main characters are so impressively devoid of serious goals and motivations, anyone taking this movie too seriously will probably despise it. The same goes for American Psycho, another adaptation of one of Bret Easton Ellis's impressive novels, and probably my favorite movie of all time.

Ian Somerhandler puts on an exceptionally good performance in this film, I was surprised. He never really did anything for me on Lost, and serves as primarily eye candy on The Vampire Diaries. But I was impressed; he not only has looks but also charm. Out of all of the characters, he was the one that felt that most tangible. I greatly enjoyed his scenes and interactions with the other characters.

A few key parts from the novel didn't make the cut for the movie, which was mildly disappointing. They didn't properly convey the awfulness of Sean Bateman's character either. I think the writers were too easy on him. My friends also experienced occasional trouble with following the storyline, seeing as they hadn't read the novel.

1818586,5,B00007L4KG,"I just watched this movie, and I have to say that I really, really liked it, although I can understand why others don't. This is a cult film, to be sure, and it requires a certain sensibility to see through to the end--the film's blunt force trauma approach to Gen Y college kids will leave lots of viewers cold, unable to muster any feeling for the film's characters. But others will enjoy the comedy of it all. For me, the movie clicked from the very first scene. I totally got what was going on and what the filmmakers were trying to say because of my own college experiences. I knew all these bastards, and I appreciated that they weren't really that sympathetic. This movie really is the definitive movie about the most prevalent form of college life that on sees today, so much so that there seems no point of ever making another.

All of this is not to say that the film is perfect, even if you share the film's sensibility. All of the scenes featuring Sean (James Van Der Beek) interacting with the drug dealer were a real drag on the movie. The actor who played the latter evidently never learned that good acting doesn't necessarily mean MORE acting. And although Van Der Beek does a surprisingly good job as Sean Bateman (my expectations were, to put it kindly, low) there are a few uneven moments. Generally, though, the acting is pretty good, and the movie is a technical marvel.

If you're not convinced so far, here are five of my favorite moments from the film. If you like them, consider watching it.

1. Sean has lost a chance at being with the woman he has convinced himself he's in love with, so he decides to kill himself. First, he tries to hang himself with a phone cord. The light fixture can't hold his weight, so he falls to the ground. Then he tries to slash his wrists with a razor, but it's a face shaver and he is again unsuccessful. Finally, he tries to overdose on pills, but all he has are what appear to be cold pills, which he takes a bunch of and chases with off-brand NyQuil. It's a pretty funny take on emo-style hysterics.

2. Sean (Ian Somerhalder of LOST) is late to meet Sean for dinner when one of his friends overdoses. He's completely nonplussed as they drive to the hospital, dismissing the crisis by saying things like, ""Freshmen don't OD."" He doesn't even bother to conceal his boredom when the guy seems to die (but doesn't).

3. ""I only did it with her because I'm in love with you."" Sure...

4. The restaurant scene. ""Well, Richard..."" ""I'm DICK!"" ""Well, Dick, what are you studying?"" Much of the rest of the dialogue is unprintable. The scene is the key to the entire movie: entitlement, resentment of authority, lack of control--it's all there. And hilarious.

5. The scene where Sean's secret admirer (who we had seen several times before) commits suicide. In between all the irony and sleaze, it's a genuinely beautiful and sad moment.

The Rules of Attraction is more than the sum of its parts, though. It makes an effective brief for what its subject group is like, and it does not exactly let them off the hook when it comes to moral terms. It is not, of course, for everyone, but if you're still reading this it might be worth a viewing.

P. S. Van Der Beek also punches Jessica Biel in the face. So, there's that.",1210464000,5,3273,4.478187919463087

1818588,5,B00007L4KG,"Bret Easton Ellis is a writer that has NO middle ground.  You either dislike immediately and not understand what all the fuss is about or you let yourself get drawn into what he is trying to display and go along for the ride.  Rules of Attraction may be the least of his three works brought to the big screen but it may have translated the best with the direction of Roger Avary.  It is also entertaining to watch beloved TV actors and actresses take roles that are worlds apart from their TV personas.  Fans usually HATE the career choices but it is nice to see actors break from what is expected by the massses.  This is NOT Shakespeare, has more shock value than merit, but it is still very enjoyable.  If you read Ellis's novels you will see that they are an accurate although embellished account of the particular time and enviroment he is trying to illustrate.  To nit-pick his work is to NOT get the message.  These characters DO EXIST in the real world, if not as individuals, then as parts of many individuals.  They are a reflection of the time and place he is describing not necessarily any particular PERSONS.  The plot development is SECONDARY.  This movie is a glimpse into a world that many people don't know and will NEVER experience but it DOES EXIST.  There is no fiction in that.

There are Sean Batemans in this world.  Rich Kids in school on Mommy and Daddy's dollar dealing drugs to their equally wealthy and spoiled classmates.  There are Lauren Hyndes in this world.  Virginal college girls saving themselves for their true love who himself is frolicking his way across Europe with not a thought in his mind of his celibate girlfriend at home.  There are Paul Dentons in this world.  Young kids that use the college years to experiment and try to find out what they want emotionally and sexually for themselves.

This move is to be enjoyed by the viewer and not to be used as a warning label or a cautionary tale.  These worlds exist and cannot be changed.  Sit back and enjoy the voyeuristic view.  Several scenes are shot in just this manner.  The Victor Romp retold by him in the diner is CLASSIC.  Worth the price of admission or rental or time spent but so many more scenes are also well done. Many scenes are done so the viewer almost feels guilty watching the action unfold.  From attempted suicides, to dorm room date rate, to misread sexual signals, we are treated to a train wreck of instances in these characters lives.

In the end we may not love any of these characters but there is usually one or more that we feel genuinely sorry for and that is the emotion that Bret Easton Ellis and Roger Avary are able to produce from many viewers.",1207699200,4,2674,4.507276507276507

People who live like this live neither long nor happily but this film attempts more to legitimise and normalise their casual misery than to satirise it. Real ""vomit of despair"" - avoid it.",1180051200,10,817,4.641379310344828
1818593,5,B00007L4KG,"Bret Easton Ellis is an awesome writer. I think his book ""American Psycho"" captures a certain essence of modern America that eludes most authors. It's difficult to say that about a book whose main character spends most of his time killing people in the most nauseating ways possible while working days as a Wall Street insider. Based on that plot summary alone, I would say you'd have to be insane to think ""American Psycho"" is a modern classic. It is, though. It's how Ellis captures the vacuousness of the elites, the absolute absence of any form of morality, which makes the book shine. Too, he captures the mindlessness of rampant consumerism perfectly. He takes it over the top, I think, but he does so only to emphasize the emptiness of his characters. Not surprisingly, his other novels look at the same ideas from different perspectives. ""Less Than Zero"" cast a scathing eye on the immoral goings on amongst wealthy 1980s youth in Los Angeles. Then there's ""Rules of Attraction,"" a book, eventually made into a major motion picture in 2002, which does the same thing for wealthy college students. I think I detect a pattern unfolding here!

""The Rules of Attraction"" exposes the antics unfolding at Camden College, one of those snooty, Ivy League type schools attended by the offspring of America's rich and famous. Let's meet the cast of characters, shall we? We've got Sean Bateman (James Van Der Beek), a drug dealer in hot water with his supplier Rupert Guest (Clifton Collins, Jr.). Lauren Hynde (the delightful Shannyn Sossamon) is a pretty young girl saving herself for her boyfriend Victor (Kip Pardue), who in turn is currently making the party rounds in Europe. Lauren's roommate Lara (Jessica Biel) likes to mix it up with the entire male population of Camden College. Paul Denton (Ian Somerhalder) is a chap that likes to swing both ways. He used to date Lauren before coming out of the closet, so to speak, and now has eyes for Sean Bateman, who he thinks swings both ways as well. I think that pretty much covers the main characters. We've got a host of minor actors in the unfolding story arcs--people like Candice (Clare Kramer), Kelly (Kate Bosworth), and Marc (Fred Savage)--to keep things popping. We also see Faye Dunaway and Swoosie Kurtz as parents in a particularly amusing sequence.

Whew! Just trying to keep track of the characters takes up most of your first viewing experience. You'll need to watch the film again to get the most out of it, however, because director Roger Avary employs a most unusual narrative technique to tell these characters' stories. When we first enter the movie, Sean's prowling about the infamous ""End of the World"" party held every year on campus. We hear him talking about himself and his actions in voiceover, a tactic used for other characters as well, before the weirdness begins. Scenes start rewinding at an incredible pace, zipping back through what we've already seen in order to take us to another character's sad tale of woe. We see Sean's problems with Rupert, Lauren's romantic difficulties, and lots of out of control partying. We learn that Sean receives love notes in his post office box that he thinks Lauren sent. The two meet but eventually drift apart before anything serious occurs. That's mainly the crux of the film right there: interesting things start to happen but don't due to inaction, misunderstandings, and a lack of communication. It doesn't help that the characters labor under vacuousness so total as to preclude meaningful relationships with anyone other than themselves.

I got a huge kick out of this movie. Then again, I also got a huge kick out of the film versions of ""Less Than Zero"" and ""American Psycho"". Others disagree, obviously, but I think Ellis's novels translate well to the screen. ""Rules of Attraction"" works under the capable guidance of Roger Avery. I think a lot of people complain about this movie, and by extension the other film versions of Ellis's books, because they don't understand the subject matter. You can complain about the film's lack of substance (not substance abuse, though, because there's plenty of that to go around), but that's the point. Ellis writes books that expose the various forms of decadence plaguing our society, and writes them in order to show the consequences on its practitioners. If you can't grasp that concept, you won't like this film. Then again, maybe you will if you like your humor as black as pitch. Let me cite two wickedly funny sequences in the movie as proof. One, the scene in which Sean attempts to take his own life had me howling with laughter. I watched it again and again, and it never lost its ability to amuse. Two, Victor's sojourn through Europe is a sight and sound experience one should not miss. Hilarious. If you still can't groove to the flick, two words: Jessica Biel.

You'll find great picture and audio quality on this DVD. Supplements include an intriguing 26 minute ""Anatomy of a Scene"" that explains how Avary and company pulled off an especially tricky piece of camera work involving Sossamon and Van Der Beek. We also receive trailers and television spots for the film, promotional material, and a commercial for the book. We also get SIX commentary tracks. One of them is a bonus commentary with comedian Carrot Top (?). The rest rely on the various actors and a few crewmembers. SIX COMMENTARY TRACKS! What were they thinking? If you listen to all of them, and I did, you'll spend days working your way through this disc's special features. I like the movie, I'm giving it five stars, and even I don't think I needed to know this much information about the film. What's surprising is that director Roger Avary isn't on a single one of these tracks! Weird. Anyway, enjoy the film. It's a keeper.",1179619200,4,5783,4.832492431886982
1818594,4,B00007L4KG,"Despite many large and small changes to the characters and storyline (what little there is) of Bret Easton Ellis' book, ""The Rules of Attraction"" manages to stay completely faithful to the novel's spirit and tone. In this, it a far more successful adapation of Ellis' work than any film thus far. Roger Avary has created an incoherent, chaotic, frenzied work, full of unlikable, selfish characters. Anyone that's read Ellis' book knows that's exactly what it is. However, what works on page often does not work on film, and this film is a clear example of that. Even though the entire cast is great, and James Van Der Beek has never been better on the big screen, the film simply does not really click. I don't know if Avary could have made the film differently and still stayed faithful to the book, but the end result is a great book adaption and a not so great film.

My advice? If you've read and liked the book, you'll like the movie despite its big, glaring faults. If you haven't read or didn't like the book, don't see the movie.",1173830400,,1037,4.545454545454546

What I found instead was hedonism but additionally an honest portrayal of the consequences of that lifestyle.

It amazes me that some of the people who give this film one, two, or three stars criticize it for its hedonism and completely and totally fail to recognize that the film is anything but a celebration of it.  If anything it's a warning to young people that a life lived in the service of the self can and often does lead to pain, anguish and even death.",1166486400,2,734,4.407407407407407
1818598,3,B00007L4KG,"I think with this film there are going to be a lot of people who outright hate it. Most people like happy ending with characters they like. This is nothing like that.

Ill start with the good things. The cinemetography and camera work are pretty damn good. Some scenes that stick out. The beginning party scene with all its time-warping, where the snowflake lands on Sean's face and your not sure if he's crying, the quick-edit feel of the European tour scene, the split screen moment when Lauren and Sean meet. It's not all wonderful but there are some great moments.

Then there are some scenes which genuinely make me laugh. It is a dark comedy (although the comedy parts are hard to find) so naturally I giggled here and there. Such as the drunken retaurant scene, where Lauren walks in on Sean and Lara (""I wouldn't f*ck her if I didn't love you!"" or something to that effect), the gay squad overdose scene, and when Victor can't remeber Lauren and the girl appears behind him. They're not exactly laugh out loud scenes because each one is dealing with something sad while making you laugh, but they are there nonetheless.

The third reason is totally superficial and I'm sure the male population is going to groan when they read this but oh well. Ian Somerhalder is gorgeous...and that's that.

Now on to the bad. Whoever decided to try and make the charcters ""realistic"" should be shot. I think my main problem with the characterization is Lauren. She's the ""innocent"" one and she's buying weed, doing coke, and blowing her professor. But she's a virgin...so therefore she's innocent...right. And another thing. The horrid attempt to humanize or moralize Sean was a big mistake. Okay, Sean loves Lauren, But why? You can't just have someone meet once for 30 seconds and then fall deeply in love. He's a self-confessed vampire. Leave the mushy stuff out of it. And why does Lauren (the ""innocent"" one remember) fall for these horny, drugged up, unfeeling guys? She's the closest thing to a sympathetic character in here and you want to hit her over the head for falling for these idiots.

The last problem I have is the gratuity of the whole thing. Usually, I can handle anything. Sex, drugs, violence, suicide, blood, nudity whatever...I usually don't mind. In this film, however, it comes off like a horror movie. They're just throwing in stuff to turn your stomach. It doesn't matter if it's necessary or not. You just feel like screaming ""Alright I get that these people are amoral a**holes, now cut it out!!""

Basically, the movie doesn't come off as a satire It comes off as a bunch of unrealistic rich bitches who don't care about anyone with a lot of sex, drugs, nudity, and suicide thrown in to make it seem edgy. My recommendation?

For good satire films about dysfunctional people, watch these instead:

American Beauty

Igby Goes Down

Thumbsucker

Ghost World

Or if you like dark films about people destroying themselves, watch these:

Fight Club

Requiem for a Dream",1161216000,4,2987,4.763565891472868

While I am a huge fan of Bret Easton Ellis and have read and loved all of his work, Rules of Attraction is one of my favorites (Less Than Zero is still his best work)...regardless I had to see this film, and while not in anyway a perfect adaptation of his novel it is a great film that holds to most of the same morals that Ellis addressed in his novel.  I have to say first that other than the fact that the charactors have the same names I don't particularly watch this film as if it were based off the novel...for many of the ket scenes in the novel, mostly Laurens pregnancy, are not in this film at all and thus watching it with the intent of watching a film version of the novel will leave you null and void.  The film does revolve around Sean Bateman (Van Der Beek) who is madly in love with Lauren (Sossaman) who once dated Paul (Sommerhalder), but Paul, now openly bisexual, is in love with Sean.  The novel delves more into these three as relationships are concerned, but the film delves into their personalities and there charactors apart from their significant other whomever that may be.  One of the best scenes involves Paul's friend Richard in the resturant.  It's outright hilarious.  Its in the novel too and I'm so glad it was included in the film.  This film does well to show the lack of morality in society and that out generation of teenagers is just as morally debased as any other.  The novel took place in the 80's during free love and drugs and the film takes place now, during free love and drugs.

One of which, that the individual notices he/she has grown into a their own private choas.  As a result, this movie, much like the experience of this sub-culture, offers a treatment of absurdity with no tangible coherence that often builds an objective correlative or a reconcilation of the steam-line of events that take place in the individual's life.

  The love triangle between Paul(Van der beek) Lauren(Sossaman) and kip pardue is meant to convey this.  And people that went away for college and were introduced to this life can, I feel, relate to it and its effects, as a channel that illustrates life's harsh absurdity.

  I thought the soundtrack was amazing and the acting was pretty good, however, Van der beek was over the top at times.  Nonetheless, it was a nice vacation from Dawson Leery...thank god!

It's kind complicated so let's meet the players first: ""I'm so dark and angry"" Sean Bateman(Dawson's Creek James Van Der Beek), virginal innocent etc Lauren(Shannon Sossamyn from A Knight's Tale and might add: gave the worst name to a baby, yes even worse than Gwyneth's Apple, it's Audio Science, yes you heard me), bisexual Paul(Ian Somerholder, Adam from season 3 of Smallville, tv's Lost), resident college slut Lara(WB's Jessica Biel) and drama major slightly gay Victor(Kip Pardue....from somewhere).

Now let's get to the plot: Sean likes Lauren but a college lunch server likes him. Lauren likes Sean but is saving herself for her boyfriend Victor, who's in Europe backpacking(and doing every girl that's willing might I add). Paul used to date Lauren but is now after Sean due to a snafu in miscommunication. Meanwhile, Lara just wants to have everyone. And there's some minor players now and then.

The opening scene is where basically a bunch of stuff happens to our players. And in a neat rewinding scene, we follow one person's situation but then rewind but following someone else. Example: due to being quite drunk, Lauren is raped and filmed until a keg bursts in the room. We rewind the scene only following the keg out of the room, down the hall and down the stairs and back where it started and then seeing the water magically going back to ice. Then we follow someone else's actions in real time.

There's some other notable ones including a split screen conversation between Sean and Lauren and a musical montage which could be straight out of a Kubrick film set to George Michael's Faith. There's also one scene that's so heartbreaking it's difficult to watch if only your eyes would quit watching. A girl commits suicide by wrist slitting in a bathtub and we basically see only her facial reaction of the cut and the beginning of death setting in. Noteworthy piece of acting here.

The film only has one problem, besides the ""I'm an important film!"" feel it has: it's like it doesn't care for its characters. Yes these are people who do bad things but when they do, we're supposed to feel sympathetic to the right people. The film comes across as ""ha, you actually started to like that character? Moron."" One character does get her comeuppance though. Seems our resident slut didn't notice a sign on a door: ""_____, the tests came back positive. Be careful""

1818617,4,B00007L4KG,"The fact that ""The Rules of Attraction"" is based on a Brett Easton Ellis's novel was brought home to me forcefully in the opening segment of this 2002 film when the first character we meet loses her virginity.  It is a rather disquieting scene, not only in terms of the circumstances but more so given her reaction.  I found myself feeling sorry for the character, but not sympathetic towards her, and if there is a major complaint to be made with regards to how it is difficult to access this film it would be because finding a character to root for is rather difficult (at least, for some of us).

The central character, a designation dictated because he provides links to the other main characters, is Sean Bateman (James Van Der Beek), who is a drug dealer at Camden College in Vermont.  Sean likes Lauren Hynde (Shannyn Sossamon), who has been saving herself for her boyfriend, Victor Johnson (Kip Pardue), who is out backpacking across Europe.  Her roommate, Lara (Jessica Biel), likes Victor, Sean, and pretty much everybody including the football team.  Paul Denton (Ian Somerhalder) is bisexual and while he used to date Lauren he is now interested in Mitchell Allen (Thomas Ian Nicholas), who is dating Candice (Clare Kramer) to prove he is not bisexual, which results in Paul having a crush on Sean.  Lauren might be interested in Sean as well.  Who is leaving the notes in Sean's mailbox?  More importantly, how is Sean going to pay all that money he owes for drugs to Rupert Guest (Clifton Collins, Jr.)?

""The Rules of Attraction"" begins at the end and then literally backs up to shift the focus to a different character and follow them for a while.  Again, knowing that Roger Avary, who co-wrote ""Pulp Fiction"" and was writer-director of ""Killing Zoe,"" adapted the novel and directed this film helps to explain this approach.  The credits take place while the images are go in an accelerated reverse to take us back several months to ""begin"" the tale anew.  By the time we get to the final credits if you do not anticipate how those are going to go then you have just not bought into this film at all.

The novel is based on Ellis's experiences in college, and if what happens in this film seems excessive, allow me to point out that today the Collegiate Network announced its seventh annual Campus Outrage Awards today and tied for first place were Sex Week at Yale and a porn ""scholarship"" at UC Santa Barbara.  The former, funded by the university and co-sponsored by Wicked Pictures, included on professor lecturing on the ""History of the Vibrator"" and a ""Porn Party"" featuring a porn star.  Given that, the string of parties that pop up throughout this film to give these characters someplace to go, and the titles of which appear on the bottom of the screen, seem pretty normal.

The best part of this film is the energy that Avary brings to it with his camera.  There is a split-screen sequence that serves as an ""Anatomy of a Scene"" featurette and another sequence that I thought was an eerily elegant suicide sequence.  That is why you keep paying attention despite the fact you have no real affection for any of the characters and are largely disinterested in their plights.  Avary seems as unsympathetic towards them as we are, but his camera refuses to let us look away.  For me the virtues of ""The Rules of Attraction"" are style over substance, but I do not think that is simply because I am decades beyond that side of the college experience.  I did not cotton to Houlden Caulfield either and I have to think he would have been at home with this bunch.",1112313600,3,3581,4.641838351822504

About halfway through ""The Rules of Attraction"", a minor character climbs into a warm tub surrounded by candles, opens the veins in her arms with a razor blade, and bleeds out into the bathwater. I almost envied her. Because for her, the movie was over. I, on the other hand, still had another 55 minutes of watching unlikeable and totally unappealing characters vomit on each other; play with themselves; wipe themselves while sitting on the toilet; shoot up drugs; and advertise Jack Daniels whiskey by clutching a bottle in scene after scene after repetitive, dull scene. Seriously, it isn't often that I run across a movie with no redeeming qualities - usually there's one praiseworthy performance, or a sparkling line of dialogue, or a commendable technical achievement - but ""The Rules of Attraction"" is an utter waste of film. The characters are unpleasant; the script, which is chockful of homophobic and misogynic elements, is totally repellent; the direction is showy yet uninspired; the editing is completely ineffective. Someone needed to remind the filmmakers that it's entirely possible to make a successful black comedy about youthful alienation, but to do so, it's necessary to: 1) be funny, and 2) avoid alienating the audience.

While the film is a resounding dud, the DVD nonetheless can be complemented on offering a clean and sharp audio and video transfer. The extras consist of a brief ""Anatomy of a Scene"" segment produced by the Sundance Channel, and an array of the film's original advertising. Tellingly, the promotional ads give no true indication of the movie's actual content and tone, suggesting that the filmmakers knew they had a turkey on their hands and felt as though they needed to fool people into buying tickets. Don't be misled into adding this one to your home theatre collection; there are hundreds of better DVDs for you to spend your money on.",1109289600,3,1944,5.015479876160991
1818620,5,B00007L4KG,"Unfortunately, which can be the case with most profane yet seemingly shallow movies, this movie is vastly misunderstood and represented. It comes off at the surface as being a dark comedy about rich college druggies and sexaholics, and much to it's dismay, that's about where it ends with most people (refer to prior reviews and you'll see). Allow me to dispell these misrepresentations.

Artistically speeking, this movie shows a mastery of cinematography (coming from a fellow filmmaker) which I find inspiring. Yes, it may seem gimmicky, mainly because some of these camera and editing tricks haven't been done before; i.e., showing a scene backwards and then reshowing it again. However, in that most people miss the beautiful interweaving Roger Avary does between different characters in the same social situation.

In one scene he uses two characters' daily routine in a split screen, where you see everything they're individually doing before encountering each other in a hallway. However, Roger Avary masterfully pulls of a camera trick I've never seen before. He takes the two split screens and pans them together perfectly, something I think that has been taken for granted. I could go on, but just take my word for it, this is in no way gimmicky.

As far as the characters and story goes, if you analyze this movie off of what you're seeing, you're missing the point. Other than show shallow rich and defunct college kids, you're getting an insight into each character's psyche and how they affect the others. There's eventually a few strong underlying points. One, which has been stated in a previous review, is Lauren's line, then repeated by Sean, which states simply ""You will never know me. No one ever knows anybody."" I say simple, but I'll be damned if it's not profound. The other point of the movie, which isn't blatantly stated outright, is that you see all of these characters lead their lives through this love triangle that never really exists. All of their associations and relationships are invented in their minds. Paul thinks he's in love with Sean, and that they're together, Sean thinks certain love letters are coming from Lauren and invents his relationship with her, just as Lauren invents her relationship with Victor. Yes this sounds at the surface like a soap opera, but you must see it and delve into the psyche these characters go through and how they're affected by each other. It states profanely that not only can you never truly know anyone, but everything you feel and see could be in your mind only, a certain homage paid to American Psycho, which shares the same underlying theme. And ultimately, in the end, both movies leave you unfulfilled, much like a Dali painting. You have to figure it out yourself.

Do yourself a favor. Don't listen to the mindless dribble most reviewers spew out about this movie, just watch it and think. Keyword, THINK about it. You'll find yourself as rewarded and pleased as I have.",1108598400,9,2958,4.921843687374749

Jessica Biel was almost convincing as the sad little promiscuous girl looking for love and affection through sex, but who cares, since that character is totally overdone? Shannyn Sossamon, as gorgeous as she is, cannot save this trite exercise in banality. There is an uncomfortable scene in which she is vomited on while losing her virginity, but it seemed gratuitous.

1818623,3,B00007L4KG,"Here's the deal:

""Rules of Attraction"" is another solid effort by Ellis as a novel.  I have always been a fan of his with my favorites being of course, ""American Psycho"" and ""Glamorama."" The main reason for my fascination for the book was the fact that Patrick Bateman's little brother Sean is really the main character in this one.  You can definetely see another American Psycho growing in Sean, making you wonder if Patrick had a similar college life. And while ROA was a good read, not his best but very enjoyable, the movie was gimmicky by contrast.

Yes, I do agree with the other reviewers here that ""if you are able to identify with the characters, you will love this movie."" Yes, I had some rough times myself and looking back, pretty much partied myself out.  I CAN identify with the characters, and that is good for some laughs throughout and a couple of ""Oh S***s"" to squeak out of my mouth.  That's really about it.
As a movie, it wasn't really faithful to the the book, which to me, is always dissapointing.  Sadly, reading the book first has made me not quite like this movie.
So why the three stars?  Well, I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't read the book.  It is entertaining as well as disturbing especially if you have lived this film in some form or another.  You can get a bit of nostalgia watching this flick.  So for me, it's two stars.  I feel if I hadn't read the book, it probably would have been maybe four, so three is in the middle to be fair.

IT is worth watching if for nothing else seeing Fred Savage Doing something that is not quite what we expected from a Wonder Years player.

1818625,2,B00007L4KG,"This is something I seem to hawk on in any review I give that is negative, but it's too important to be overlooked. In order for any art form to be ""good"" (however you want to subjectively define that), it needs to *make sense*. Whether it's a painting, the lyrics of a song, a book, or a movie: the parts which comprise the whole need to work together to create one uncompromising union.

This movie doesn't make sense.

It is a string of gratuitous events, from the very beginning to the absolute end, and anytime the word ""gratuitous"" is used in conjunction with a form of art, that's a bad thing. Our main characters consist of Lauren, who thinks she has a boyfriend who is in Europe for a time, and while he is away she falls in love with another main character. That character's name is Sean Bateman, and why anyone would fall in love with him is beyond comprehension. He is base, immoral, and revolting. The other main character, Paul, was Lauren's ex-boyfriend until he came out of the closet. He too, bewilderingly, falls in love with Sean.

But this isn't a story about a love triangle - in fact, it's not really a story about anything. There's nothing to latch onto and say, ""This is the foundation of this film.""

The images we are shown aren't meant to enlighten us - they never enlighten us. They merely disgust or please us, and that comes full circle back to the film being a string of gratuitous events.

Nothing, absolutely nothing, makes any sense.

The one bright spot in the film, and the reason for its two star rating, is Ian Somerhalder's performance (Paul). If you're interested in his career, then by all means, watch this film. Just look away when he's not on the screen.",1098403200,4,1698,4.514657980456026
1818626,3,B00007L4KG,"Bret Easton Ellis actually does not translate onto film without immense effort because the real stuff of his writing is in the piling up of seemingly mundane events and details. Anything which happens to a character in an Ellis novel doesn't mean much to that character. So things you need in a movie like unity, character arcs... all that is either forged by the screenwriter or doesn't work in the movie.

Here, Roger Avery (the bitter man destined to be remembered for his jealousy of former partner Tarantino) employs a gimmick of scenes running backwards which unfortunately does not add to the story's unity. This is because the book does not work backwords - the book is linear and moves forwards - as does the movie, after the first few scenes! So i wasn't sure what the point of it was!

It does not give the whole thing a feeling of purpose, it does not tie it together. The gimmick is essentially useless. He shows us the final scene first, then we do the movie and by the time we come back to it, we've not learned hardly anything that gives us a new appreciation of it. This is a sign that you're gimmick has done absolutely nothing for you.

So while i thought the actors (particularly James van der Beek as Sean Bateman and the guy playing Paul) did a sterling job at playing these dark, hollow characters - and lovers of the book will have to admire the lion's effort of an adaptation, this problem with the gimmick was damning for me.

1818631,4,B00007L4KG,"I read The Rules of Attraction years ago when it was first released in the 80s (I still have my dog-eared hardback copy).  It has remained one of my all time favorite novels. The resonations from that novel have stayed with me, changing my perspective on what writing can be and making me an instant Bret Easton Ellis fan. I was in college at the time I first read it and it seemed to be a frighteningly accurate portrayal of the excesses of 80s college life.  So imagine my dismay when I discovered that it was adapted for film.  Less Than Zero was a disappointing flop, the original story practically unrecognizable in its film adaptation and American Psycho was a fairly well-done interpretation of Ellis's difficult novel.  So I had no hopes for The Rules of Attraction.  Finally, months after its release on DVD, I decided to give it a go.

Although it isn't a truly faithful adaptation, Avary manages to capture the essence of the novel brilliantly taking some liberties with the storyline and characters (i.e. Lauren was NOT a virgin and did not go to the opening party, Sean and Paul had a fairly extended sexual relationship although Sean was too drunk or high to remember most of it).  Through the use of a cinematic bag of tricks, an alienating soundtrack by tomandandy peppered with 80s hits and a cast of beautiful 20-something actors (Shannyn Sossamon is gorgeous!) Avary creates the same atmosphere of detached disaffectedness with a sense of urgency as the novel.  My favorite cinematic devise used is running the film backwards.  I liked the opening party scene which really is the end of the movie and how each character and their perspective is introduced by running the scene backwards three times.  Also, the use of character voiceovers helps to convey a sense of hopelessness as a lot of the voiceover dialogue is lifted directly from the novel.  The movie even opens and closes in a mid sentence dialogue like the novel.  Watching this movie (and reading the novel as well) creates a sense that something is wrong, but what?  The scary thing is in 1987 this novel was spot on in its portrayal of jaded 80s youth.  I don't think, in 2004, it's too far off the mark in relation to today's youth as well.

I thoroughly enjoyed this film, more so than I thought I would. I was mesmerized with every stunning, shocking and stylized scene.  One of the best book-to-movie adaptations I've seen in a long time.  Definitely not a movie for everyone, but if you really enjoyed the movie then pick up the book.  If you really enjoyed the book, I doubt you'll be disappointed with the movie. Brilliant.",1091145600,8,2613,4.680525164113786
1818632,2,B00007L4KG,"Beautiful people with pockets deeper than they are recklessly indulge their appetites for drugs, alcohol and sex: these ingredients are staples in the novels of Harold Robbins, Jacqueline Susann, Jackie Collins and Judith Krantz. Their books are regarded as trash. With ""Less than Zero"" and ""The Rules of Attraction,"" author Bret Easton Ellis essentially uses the same ingredients, yet in the 1980s he somehow got hailed as a literary wunderkind. True, ""Less than Zero"" maybe has more to say about the privileged young adults of L.A. than ""Hollywood Kids,"" and Ellis' witty style and Nihilistic sensibilities gives him more literary weight than, say, Rosemary Rogers. But Nihilistic trash isn't any less trashy. And it certainly sells, which is why Hollywood is eager to turn Ellis' books into box office gold. Unfortunately, as often happens, trashy books usually become celluloid garbage.

Which brings us to ""The Rules of Attraction,"" the movie. In one scene in this movie, Jessica Biel and Shannyn Sossamon's characters do so much coke that Biel's nose starts to bleed. ""Rusty pipes,"" Biel giggles as she wipes the blood away. This line also is uttered in the movie of ""Less Than Zero"" and while using it in ""Rules"" seemed intended as a joke, it also highlights how much of a ""Zero"" retread ""The Rules of Attraction"" is. Although this time around it's being sold as satire and is free, thankfully, of any ""Just Say No"" moralizing, this could just as well have been ""Less than Zero 2,"" or ""Less than Half,"" or whatever. Set on an East Coast campus where students, besides all being on a first-name basis, are more likely to be instructed to perform sexual favors for a professor than write a term paper, ""Rules of Attraction"" is both plotless and soulless. There are attempts to make characters played by Sossamon, as the ""sensitive virgin,"" and Ian Somerhalder, as a homosexual smitten with James Van Der Beek (who in turn wants Sossamon), as possibly capable of feelings that go beyond the dull tingling of their crotches or the burning in their noses, and a peripheral character commits suicide for good measure, but I've felt a deeper connection to Old Navy spokesmodels.

The performances in ""Rules"" are competent, though I think I enjoyed Faye Dunaway and Swoosie Kurtz's small parts as pill-popping moms more than any of the leads. Van Der Beek does an admirable job of distancing himself from his ""Dawson Creek"" role, but that might not necessarily be a good thing. I know director Roger Avery has been slammed by some for pushing style over substance, but style is really all this movie has. I don't know if ""Rules"" would be watchable without all of Avary's flourishes like split screens, reverse action and MTV-style quick cuts. He's turned Ellis' trashy book into... well, a trashy movie, but what glittery trash it is. If nothing else, the cast is pretty and the soundtrack's decent.

As if ""The Rules of Attraction"" didn't have enough problems, the DVD's commentary track includes some homophobic and immature remarks by Somerhalder. If he truly thought kissing a man is ""the most disgusting thing on the planet,"" why did he take the role of a homosexual? Considering Lion's Gate also courted the gay dollar in the film's release, it was stupid of the studio to include comments that alienate the very demographic they're trying to attract. They wouldn't include racist remarks on a movie targeting African-American audiences, would they? As for Somerhalder, he should get in touch with Donna Summer and find out just how damaging homophobic comments can be to a career.",1091145600,5,3586,4.963394342762063
1818633,1,B00007L4KG,"Directed by Roger Avary ''The Rules of Attraction'' is one of the worst movies of 2002 and there have been a couple.
The movie stars James Van Der Beek from ''Dawson's Creek'' as Sean Bateman, a drug dealing slanking student who basically by his own words is a ''social vampire'' someone who leeches of others, and sinks his fangs to those naive and weak enough around him. The best example is near the beginning where Sean is telling us through a couple of brief flashbacks about the pathetic situations he has been involved in. He then seeks to forgot about his problems like some individuals by consuming himself with alcohol and then finding a cheap girl to sleep with. His prayers get answered when he meets a young blonde who is obviously a little drunk as well. Anyhow fast forward 5 minutes and then we are introduced to a whole slew of pathetic characters. There is the homosexual character of Paul (Ian Somerhalder) who basically likes to sleep with any boys around him. I doubt think gays would have liked this character either. I have seen in many films vile heterosexual characters but dare I say it, Paul is the first vile homosexual character Ive seen in film (another good reason that the movie shouldn't have been made let alone a novel)
Supposedly this horrible movie was taken from a novel by Bret Easton Ellis and I could only shudder to think how bad the book is if the movie of this calibur is taken from a novel. In fact looking at another site it doesn't quite know how to qualify the movie. It has the movie itself listed as a Comedy/Drama/Romance/Thriller? lol
Back to the movie, we see a couple of the stupid situations Mr. Bateman is in. Apparently he has a drug pimp (some weak little 17 yr old white boy) who think he is a big shot because he carries a gun. Anyhow, this pimp wants money from Sean (apparently they have some sort of partnership going where this guy gets his own cut of the drug money). Sean can't pay the money but he comes with a way to get it by swindling a couple of rich preppies who want to get high....lol
Then there comes this sick twist in the film, Paul sexually loves Sean and Sean is interested in this girl Lauren Hynde (Shannyn Sossamon) supposedly because she is pure and sweet (which is not what I heard in the novel).
Anyhow, Sean Bateman well to put in a blunt is real nilist, he likes to turn everything into crap plain and simple. The movie itself takes one direction (to sicken us with one hideous character after the next and shows their selfish stupid actions)
and pretty does until the very end. Speaking of which, the ending itself is written on the wall halfway, it's not surprising, it's a sad ending to a sad vile film.
''The Rules of Attraction'' also has done nothing for the cast either, James Beek hasn't done a movie in 2 yrs and none of the other actors except maybe Kate Bosworth who has a short role as Kelly (friend of Lauren) has gone anywhere.
The only good thing that I think comes from watching such a stupid movie as this, is that it shows that even in 2002 American directors still seek to make incredibly bad movies hoping that audiences will dig them, they won't and I didn't dig this movie at all.
Another horrible movie with James Van Der Beek which started a couple of years ago with his weak movie ''Varsity Blues''.
I did get the blues watching this movie (pun intended). Van Der Beek is just not a good actor at all, all he has is good looks but not much acting depth. So stay away from this movie.

Sure, that description can be applied to almost any teen ""coming of age"" comedy or drama.  But the problem is that none of the characters in this movie had any redeeming qualities.  There was no reason to root for any of them, no reason to care enough to become invested in the directions their lives would take them.  On top of that, the script is a collection of disjointed scenes.  These disjointed scenes allow for cameos by notable actors like Faye Dunaway, Swoosie Kurtz, Fred Savage, Paul Williams, Theresa Wayman, and not-so-notable Russell Sams, but none of their appearances really serve the story.  In fact, you could take their scenes out of the movie, and nothing--absolutely nothing--would be lost.  So, what was the point?  In fact, the only one on that list whose character is an important plot point, a motivating factor for much of the lead character's actions, is removed from the story at the two thirds mark, but because of the disjointed nature of the script, the removal doesn't have any transformational effect on the lead character as it could or should.
As for the stars, from my understanding, Jason Van Der Beek chose this script because he wanted to break away from his Dawson's Creek image.  Well, okay.  The lead character Sean Bateman is a much different note than Dawson Leery.  The problem is, it's only one note.  Part of the blame must be laid on scriptwrite/director Roger Avary, because there isn't much in the way of development for the character (or any of the other characters) in word or direction, but Van Der Beek doesn't imbue the character with any depth of his own creation.  Much of Van Der Beek's performance is made up of tilting his head down and looking up with his eyes to communicate menace, lust, puzzlement, being drunk/stoned, annoyance, fear, and an orgasm (mind you, not all at the same time).  It's an extremely limited pallet, and it gets monotonous.  The other two leads, Shannyn Sossamon and Ian Somerhalder (who have equally difficult names to spell), fare a little better as the script gives them both a little more to do in terms of range and because they are able to inject small bits of humanity into their performances.
Ultimately, I watched the movie until the end and I'm glad I did.  Not because I was transported by the story--that just annoyed me--but because I enjoyed the filmmaking technique.  I just wish it could have been brought to material I appreciated more.
Note:  The DVD contains an episode of Sundance Channel's Anatomy of a Shot that looks at the making of an incredibly effective scene conveyed in split screen.  The scene is breathtaking in the movie and it was interesting to see how it was made.

This scene was particularly well filmed and the accompanying music added definite atmosphere.

My favorite scenes were when Paul and his gay friend Dick were dancing to George Michael's ''Faith'', which was the film's highlight. Jessica Biel wasn't too believeable playing a slutty character in the film. It was just another attempt for Biel to abandon her 7TH HEAVEN tv image.

Like the book, the movie makes you feel really strongly about the characters (all of them, from the good bad Sean Bateman to the intellectual scumbag professor Lauren messes around with..hate him) ...  the movie has to do it more with imagery because they can't have all the dialogue from the book. Great movie, but I think it would have been better if they stuck more to the book.  There were a couple major flaws in the movie that bothered me, the rest I could deal with ...  one that really bothered me is in the book Sean listens to Velvet Underground and in the movie they have him playing Counting Crows on guitar for the bimbo he bangs at The End of the World.  Counting Crows weren't even around when this film was supposed to be set and if they were Sean Bateman would not listen to them.  Also they have Lauren losing her virginity at The End of the World party but in the book she doesn't even attend _that_ party, and she regrets not going.  Another thing is Lauren's relationship with Victor - in the book he is in Europe, and she is missing him but screwing around on him, in the movie he has just gotten back from europe and she just has a thing for him; they hadn't had any relationship.  Also in the book, according to Denton, he and Sean have more of a thing ..  they downplay that in the movie.  All that aside, though, it's a great movie.  James Van Der Beek is perfect as Sean, polar opposite of his lame Dawson's Creek character.  The 80s music goes really well with the movie, it's a great selection.  The strange sequence of events didn't really throw me off or bother me at all.  My advice is see the movie and if you like it and want more read the book, the book is excellent and I think even if I had read the book first I'd still love the movie because of the great casting and the way other things in the film are thrown together.",1075939200,2,1899,4.209944751381215

The directing is edgy and stylish enough, pherhaps even a bit too hip for it`s own good, but excellent nonetheless. There are a lot of jump/ reverse moments in the narrative to make it interesting, as well as multiple story perspectives, split screens and an unique, cretive way of connecting sound and image (the soundtrack is just great and sets the mood properly).

Sure, there are some apparently meaningless scenes but as a whole they make sense and help to develop the characters, who are more than what they first seem (although we never get to know them properly, since ""no one knows anyone"").
The movie offers an interesting look at a part of college experience, showing a darker, cynical and bitter side of teenagers and young adults that isn`t seen in the most common, dumbed down and predictable teen flicks out there. This mixes heavy dark comedy with sad moments of loneliness, despair and alienation. There`s sex, drugs and rock n`roll, but it isn`t really a case of style over substance.

He lusts for a girl he has never met and will do anything to bed her, all the while unaware that his target is not the one who has been leading him on. It's a telling sign of the film that we are presented with the film's ending at the start of the film with the rest of the film as prologue to these characters' unseemly predicaments at the start of the film. The film boasts a wonderful rich soundtrack by Tomandandy which creates this 80's atmosphere to hearken to the book's original setting.
The film's best segment is a European vacation vignette with Kip Pardue that sets up the eventual adaptation of Ellis' novel Glamourama, but if there's one film worth watching for a 5 minute sequence, it's this one as Avary gives us a drug fueled manic tour monologue of the European continent in 5 minutes only to have it set up as a payoff to a joke about virgin conquests, hearkening back to early Tarentino/Avary fare like Reservoir Dogs.

1818648,2,B00007L4KG,"""The Rules of Attraction"" already has an address in the cinematic dictionary under ""cult film"": Writer/director Roger Avary's visually exuberant chronicle of college life is relentlessly nihilistic, sexed-up and drug-addled, embraced as a catalogue of truth. Based on the Bret Easton Ellis book that was never this self-conscious, Avary does dispense occasional wisdom pearls, and pulls a few directorial tricks worth envying, but he sandwiches them between vapid titillation and film school exercises.
There is the coke-dealing Sean ( James Van Der Beek), who'd like to sleep with virgin Lauren (Shannyn Sossamon), who had saved herself for Victor (Kip Pardue) before he went to Europe for a semester. Lauren used to date Paul (Ian Somerholder) a bisexual who'd like to sleep with Sean himself.
Could Paul be the one sending Sean love letters? Could Lauren? Sean is an unmitigated jerk with only a dark humor to his credit; he is attractive to weak people who mistake his malevolence for self-esteem, which they crave for themselves. Van Der Beek proves he's capable amateur sadism as his Sean rebukes the offers of everyone around him, building a wall to his own thoughts so impenetrable even he can't pierce it. ""You'll never know me,"" he yells at Paul and the audience. Do we really want to?
Avary fares better with Lauren's story. Sossamon is quirky-looking, and not classically trained - she was discovered as a deejay - but naturally vulnerable. Her Lauren is smart but precocious, hiding behind lines of coke and her sheltered version of ""promiscuity"" - she performs oral sex on a professor (Eric Stoltz) almost as a duty - until she finally decides that officially losing her virginity is a way of asserting herself. She alone sees through to Sean, seems capable of cracking the shell, until Sean pulls one too freaky a stunt for her to stand. Unlike Paul, who is a Sean-groupie to the end.
The movie swings for the fences and tries to render these relationships through the lens of satire. Mugging director David Lynch, Avary inserts bizarre, unrelated scenes that he lacks the humor and visual restraint to properly orchestrate. What to make of Russell Sams' cameo, which consists of dancing with Somerholder to George Michael on a bed, then throwing a restaurant tantrum? Or of a sequence where an admirer of Paul's tries to commit suicide and is declared dead at the hospital while he's still breathing? Or of the entire subplot concerning Sean's drug deals that features Clifton Collins Jr. playing another half-lunatic?'
 Avary meticulously stages musical numbers for Paul and a long sequence that splits the screen and follows Sean and Lauren from their beds to class until they stare right at each other into their respective cameras. Nice steal of Bergman's ""Persona,"" but what is it for, if the actors don't do anything with it? The source material isn't exactly Ellis' best work, and hardly a bouquet of humor, like ""American Psycho"" or deadly ennui, like ""Less Than Zero,"" both of which were made into entertaining pictures. The kids in ""Rules"" seem to be suffering from a fierce case of acting out, and deserve what's coming to them.
The same goes for Avary, an innovative talent who nonetheless has few storytelling skills behind that bag of visual tricks.
The director's ambition doesn't know many bounds - ""Rules"" is the first in a trilogy, if you can imagine - nor does his ego, as his movie plays like a gauntlet-throw at old partner Quentin Tarantino, with whom he shared the Oscar for co-writing ""Pulp Fiction,"" and who, as Avary claims, stole work credit and material all the time.
Avary may, in fact, have mastered a few extra skills, and stolen from films of a better pedigree - Tarantino rips off Saturday morning kung fu trash these days - but his treatment of the characters is hateful - you don't put Biel and Kate Bosworth if acting chops are of any import. ""The Rules of Attraction"" has a fan base that insists its detractors ""just don't get it"" when, in fact, the movie's major flaw is that there's isn't much to get: Avary is the lone star. He gives it all away, and then some. It's not only indecent; it's like watching Dennis Hopper redux.",1073952000,,4181,4.880450070323488

And so it goes that with endless rounds of drug, alcohol, and sex drenched campus activities to par take in, such as The End of the World Party or The Dress to get Screwed Party human nature determines that in a highly imperfect world, the rules of attraction always apply.
Do not enter this film with any preconceived ideas.

1818651,2,B00007L4KG,"""The Rules of Attraction"" is based on Bret Easton Ellis book of the same title, and the fact tells you all; like the previously filmed ""Less Than Zero"" and ""American Psyco"" the characters spending time aimlessly in university are not your oridinary clean-cut all-American boys and girls.  But let me hurriedly say that that is not a problem at all here (in fact, not everything about them is repulsive as some critics suggest).
The real problem can be found in the name of the director, Roger Avary, who once was working at a local video shop with a film buff called Quention Tarantino.  Unlike his ex-pal, however, Avary's filmic technique are only a showy performance -- split-screen, fast cutting, backward-running shots -- everything is at first mildly funny to see, and then he overuses them.  And we realize that the characters are not well-rounded or interesting in any way (I mean, how many people really care if college students drink so much as the film shows?  We are long past the stage when we are easily shocked by them, living in the time of the internet, you know.)
The story is actually a string of loosely connected episodes around drug-dealing (and brother to another Bateman in ""American Psycho"") Sean Bateman (James Vab Der Beek) and Lauren Hynde (Shannyn Sossamon).  It starts with a party scene where every students got drunk and stoned, and among them we see these two not-quite-happy.  And you are introduced to other characters played by Ian Someholder, Kate Bosworth, and Kip Pardue (though the last two's screen time is fairly short,  Plus you get cameos of Faye Dunnaway and Eric Stoltz.
Sean wants to sleep with Lauren, who is in love with another guy.  Sean then sleeps with different girls while Paul Denton (Ian Someholder) is attracted to him.  Every character wants something which they cannot have, and the only thing they can do is ""deal with it.""
These characters are all shallow and self-centered, but remember, Tarantino has shown many killers in his films and can make them quite engaging and lively presence.  No chance here.  Roger Avary insists on his own ""realism"" so that Dowson's Creek Van Der Beek must show us how he spends his time in bathroom.  All is done as if saying, ""How about that?""  Sorry, but we are not impressed, after watching ""Kill Bill"" lately.
Possibly except for Ms. Sossamon, the acting is of lower kind that would explain why these actors have not achieved higher or bigger level of works after their once memorable performance in career.  They need another agent who has seen Avary's tedious ""Killing Zoe"" disaster, and can give better advice on their choice of jobs.
I do not disagree with the shallow characters -- we may resemble them in some way or other -- but the shallow way of presenting them.  But more fundamental questiuon is the film does not answer the question -- why should we watch this film (which still smells the bubbly 80s) now in the 21st century?",1072137600,,2937,4.776679841897233
1818652,4,B00007L4KG,"I think the best thing about this movie is that it is often very funny. James Van Der Beek 's performance as an amoral but goofy drug dealer and sex addict is extremely comical. His performance was excellent in getting Sean's personality down pat. The end of the movie gets very weird with a succession of rejections including Sean's rejection of a gay guy who seems to prefer straight guys, as well as Sean's rejection by Lauren whose ex has forgotten her. I think that this is what is strongest about the movie:it is very funny at times, has great acting by almost everyone, is a movie that you can not easily forget. In some ways the movie is original although previous movies have mixed fantasy with reality in a manner in which it is unclear what is fantasy and what is reality(such as Rosemary's Baby and Mullholland Drive). What is probably most original about this movie is the backward movement of the timeline. Another interesting aspect is you never know when people are telling the truth or lying including on the voice overs. Any way I would recommend the movie for anyone interested in an offbeat dark comedy and not offended by sexual content.",1069113600,2,1158,4.6536585365853655
1818653,2,B00007L4KG,"There are two types of bad movies.  The first is movies that were doomed from Day One.  (Battlefield Earth, Glitter, Swept Away fall into this category)  The second type is much more aggrevating.  This is movies that COULD'VE have been great, but something went horribly wrong.  Sadly, ""The Rules Of Attraction"" falls into this category.
  Director Roger Avary tries several filming techniques that would have been good in moderation, but unfortunately he drags them out to the point of boredom.  A perfect example occurs at the very beginning.  The first scene takes place at a party and shows events through the eyes of the three main characters, sociopathic Sean Bateman (James Van Der Beek), repressed Lauren (Shannyn Sossamon), and frustrated bisexual Paul (Ian Somerhalder).  After Sean's events and before Lauren's events, the film then ""rewinds"", as everything we just saw is reversed.  This would have been cool for about 30 seconds, but instead the film continues to rewind for a few more minutes, to the point where you want to scream ""WE GET IT!"" at the screen.
  Another classic example is when a character who has been out of the country for most of the movie returns, and his adventures are displayed in fast-motion while he quickly narrates without taking a breath.  Again, this would've have been interesting for about 90 seconds, but the scene continues to drag on for over 5 minutes.
  The movie also suffers under the misconception that being ""outrageous"" will automatically make it interesting.  Watching the characters do drugs non-stop and talk about sex isn't enough to carry a movie.  And if you're going to have a character commit suicide in a graphic manner, it may be more effective if you actually give her at least one line of dialogue during the movie.  It's hard to feel too much sympathy for a character we don't even know.
  There are only two reasons to watch this movie.  The first is for the scene in which Paul and his former male lover dine out with their mothers.  This scene is so hysterically funny it almost makes the movie worth watching.  The second reason is for Jame Van Der Beek, who breaks his usual typecasting and gives an incredibly effective and chilling performance as Sean Bateman.  (American Psycho fans, don't get too excited, the only mention of Sean's serial killer brother is when Sean is informed that ""Patrick"" left a message for him).  Other than these two pluses, watching ""Rules of Attraction"" simply makes us wonder how good this movie could have been had it been put together better.  It almost feels like you've just watched a two-hour movie trailer...",1068336000,,2620,4.882086167800454

Somehow, utilizing mostly satire, this film captures the pain and longing beneath the trappings of wealth.  A straightforward, empathetic approach wouldn't have worked -- these aren't the most charming people.  By distancing us from their pain, Avary actually allows us to see it more clearly.
The film collapses under its own weight at the end.  Anyway it's less a real narrative than a freeform look at sexual confusion and mores at the end of a wretched century.  Beautiful and brave performances from start to finish, especially Ian Somerholder's as a pampered, narcissistic gay student with a very wrong crush.",1067644800,2,771,5.039370078740157

First of Lauren is not a virgin as they make her out to be in the movie. 2nd in the book not that much emphases is put into the character Lara and yet in the movie she is an important player since she's Jessica Biel.(no pun intended I mean she is a fox). And the main thing that bugs me is the fact that Sean and Lauren were never a couple in the movie. And yet they are a couple in the book for at least a quarter of it. So all i'm saying is if your going to do a movie based on a book dont' half ass it and add key elements from the book or rather just brush up on them at least.

1818656,4,B00007L4KG,"In one word, WOW! this film will be remembered much in the way FIGHT CLUB is rmembered now. Here it goes...Sean Bateman (James Van Der Beek, good old Dawson), brother to AMERICAN PSYCHO's Patrick Bateman, goes to New England's Camden College. Lauren Hynde (Shannyn Sossamon, Angelina Jolie's twin from A KNIGHT'S TALE and FORTY DAYS AND FORTY NIGHTS) and Paul Denton (Ian Somerhalder) also go to Camden and happen to be at the same party Sean is at. They are all at the End of the World party (the Camden Christmas bash) and they all are celebrating different things, which we find out through a flashback to the start of the semester.
Sean has been getting love letters from a mysterious girl and he is slowly falling in love, while dealing cocaine and screwing anyone he can on the side, even though he doesn't seem satisified with his decisions. He assumes that Lauren has been slipping him the letters, but she has her eyes set on Victor (Kip Pardue of REMEMBER THE TITANS and um, DRIVEN), who happens to be in Europe screwing every foreigner in sight and taking every drug known to man. Paul is in love with Sean, but Sean doesn't seem to notice. Sean's more interested in getting more pot and geting laid.
James Van Der Beek couldn't have picked a better role to make people forget about Dawson's Creek. This role is about as un-Dawson Leery as he can get and he fits like a glove. He really embodied the character. He is great in this film and deserves an Oscar nom but the fact is that no one will even think to give it to him just because he is a Creeker.
The movie is extremely fun to watch! Director Roger Avary has made an amazingly DARK, comedy. this ian't no ROAD TRIP or AMERICAN PIE that's for sure. Even if this film doesn't become a success atthe theatres it WILL (definately) on video and deservingly so.

The spit shot scene, the numerous shots of time fast-forwarding and rewinding, the multiple character thought patterns, all help to add this to my favorites list. I am very impressed with the well thought out characters, extraordinary dialogue, and character motivation.

1818658,3,B00007L4KG,"I saw ""The Rules of Attraction"" shortly after reading the novel, and found it to be a pretty faithful and entertaining adaption. The movie stays true to the tone of the book, even if it did change the time period from the early 80's to present day. All the visual and stylistic tricks the filmmakers used worked to convey the confusion, drug use, and craziness that the troubled students of Camden college are experiencing. Since the film didn't shy away from many of the dark themes of the book, my only real complaint was how much the film minimized the homosexual relationship between Sean and Paul in the film (which was much more explicit and extensive in the book). It seems that in this day and age, drug use, suicide, and violence are all acceptable film content, but for a mainstream film, male on male sex is still too much of a taboo.",1065225600,2,845,4.529411764705882
1818659,1,B00007L4KG,"I have to say that before this movie I never watched Dawson's Creek. I'm at an age where the word creek sounds more like a burial than a place of teen angst. So I didn't have an image in my mind of what this movie's lead would be like. After watching it twice I have come to believe that tv stars don't for the most part make good movie actors. Sure Sally Fields maybe, but most tv stars take to movies like like George W. Bush to the English language. The problem is usually about the ease and talent that  film acting requires. On a small screen those breaks in the strory can cloud limted acting- ask any soap star- but  in a 2 hour movie I have to believe you from start to finish or else I am wasting all my time. The people in this movie are pretty in that"" Real World"" way. You would only notice them because someone makes them seen. But their characters are also "" Real World"" like. They no real flaw of character that  you believe shows any insight or depth and they are labels  from the minute we see their names on the screen; labels they  never  rise above. The film is written as though we are to think that  the characters all have more than they offer and are passing time try to figure that  more out. But in reality  one wonders how they got into college in the first place and what is more how their sexual needs are any thing  more then  just drugged induced feelings of horniness. Between the drugs, the kisses, the drinks and the screwing this films only  suggest that  their  are  a great many parents outthere  who should reconsider how much allowance to send junior. It is clear that he/she is getting too much. No one can get through college as dysfuntional as these people. Finally I would be thoughtless if I didn't  mention two scenes that really bothered me. First Dawson and the ""gay"" kiss at some point- at least in the ""gay""'s mind. It is the worst kiss I have ever seen. It is wooden, and fake and lacks any true desire. It is meant to shock the viewer and not  deepen the characters. That only proves that  these aren't real actors but image boys. If they really  wanted to break their image they would have  really  kissed and shown the world that a man to man kiss can be as exciting and defining as any other moment. Too bad they are too  homophoic to really see the character and not the kiss. Secondly- one actor Russell Sams(Dick) seesm to think that he is in a real movie and makes his character what all the other one aren't- unforgiving. In his scenes we see a real dysfuntional boy who not trying to be a man but a human with wit and childish honesty. His meanness and crude  behavior is based on a known future and  we can respect his manners because we know he knows  that they are just an act.",1065052800,,2740,4.241312741312742
1818660,2,B00007L4KG,"""The Rules of Attraction"" outwardly has a great deal going for it. Just about no one does it better than Bret Easton Ellis when it comes to capturing the vapid, empty existence of his generation - therefore the adaptation of his novel should be just as scathing, right? In this case, absolutely not. Director Roger Avary has an arsenal of cinematic tricks, violence, and sexual deviance that he lets loose in ""Attraction,"" but all of it doesn't really add up to much. Sure, it catalogues some of the things that go hand in hand with the college generation that the movie shows: wild parties, nearly-anonymous sex, masturbation, homosexuality, drugs, booze, and MORE sex, but the film's pointless plot never really seems to bring meaning to it all. This is not helped by a scowling, one-note performance by James Van Der Beek (trying his hardest to shed his soulful-teen-heartthrob image) and other below-par offerings from Shannyn Sossamon and Kip Purdue. Sure, Avary lets his characters run loose in his vision of modern emotional emptiness, but things go cinematically out of control, and the movie iself dives downward, right with its characters. All in all, ""The Rules of Attraction"" seems a glorified excuse to show guys dancing in their underwear...",1064620800,,1255,5.038461538461538

Of course lots of sex, drugs, and even suicide. It lets you know that college life isn't what movies like Road Trip, Animal House, Old School and others alike would like you to think it is. While those watered down comedies may be fun this is what I wish I saw more of. Just raw harsh realities of being young. James Van Der Beek does an excellent job and finally we can belive that he is capable of being someone other than Dawson. Anyone who loves teen movies like me should definitley check this one out.",1064448000,2,677,4.2153846153846155
1818662,2,B00007L4KG,"Directed & Scripted by Roger Avary from the Bret Easton Ellis novel, RULES OF ATTRACTION is 100% UNCUT in NZ! Amazing!
The ""story"" revolves around a pack of self-absorbed, doped-up college kids- among them Sean Bateman (James Van Der Beek in a bad guy role)cousin of American Psycho Patrick; Paul the token gay guy; Peter a country bumpkin who is attending college on financial aid... and who also needs to pay off a whacked out drug dealer who possesses a vocab as extensive as Mickey Rourke; & other characters I won't bother going into because the movie is so self-absorbed and numbing. Just like the story's protaganists.
THE RULES OF ATTRACTION is basically about a group of college kids & the seemy underside of the American Dream of a privileged education & what lies below the surface. The film is narrated in a dull monotone by Van Der Beek's character; which of course manages to capture the tone of Ellis's book quite well- if you've read the book & LESS THAN ZERO, you'll know what I mean.
The first 15 minutes are the most annoying; which is meant to set up the story before the opening creds- including a scene where Van Der Beek is engaging in a violent sex act. Meant to be shocking, but really when you watch it you just think ""Hey, check it out! Dawson's doing the rumba!""
After that the film turns into a long, protracted two and a half hours of drugs, booze, sex, rape, suicide, vomit & numerous other bodily fluids; a vain attempt by Avary to be provocative & scandalous; but all the movie does is wallow in its own excess & amounts to nothing more than a self indulgent piece of glitzy trash. This especially applies to the overlong, monotonous montage sequence in the last half hour; where my next door neighbour makes her motion picture debut as ""the Kiwi girl""- an entire half second of screen time. (Chances are she'll jump the fence and beat me up if she reads this!!)
Overall, RULES OF ATTRACTION is a movie in which its ambition far outweighs its achievements (What's with the reverse play sequence in the movie? Is it just Avary saying ""Look at me! I can do camera tricks!""?). One of the characters also makes a reference to Quentin Tarantino. Subtle. Is Avary annoyed because BOOGIE BOY & MR. STITCH were far from being great movies? Is RULES OF ATTRACTION a vain attempt to be taken seriously by Hollywood for another 15 minutes? If so he's failed in that respect.
The cast also includes Kate Bosworth, Swoosie Kurtz & Faye Dunaway. Ron Jeremy has a cameo as a pianist. Why did they bother? And why should you? Read the book instead, its equally pretentious but will give you less of a headache.",1064448000,,2627,4.579617834394904
1818663,3,B00007L4KG,"The Rules of Attraction is thought provoking and amazingly surreal without being cheesey. However, this movie lacks any real heart and never gives you the chance to connect with a character. The soundtrack almost makes up for this, including The Cure and a disturbing scene involving Harry Nillson's 'Without You'.
The formula for the Rules of Attraction could of produced a masterpiece of a movie, but something seems to be missing. The film seems to skip through different topics without ever getting a main message across.",1063584000,,525,5.116279069767442
1818664,3,B00007L4KG,I read the book version of this movie before I saw it and I have to say that the book was a lot better! The movie left things out and just didn't grab my attention the way the book did. I'd skip the movie altogether and read the book instead.,1061856000,,242,3.86

Thank God I missed this movie's ten seconds in the theater because I saved 5 bucks since I only had to rent this mess. So, what is wrong with the movie. Where to begin. The Direction of the film feels like a cocky NYU film student trying to show off his effects skills. The Acting is bad all around. The Story goes nowhere. None of the characters are relatable or in anyway nice. The Trailer for the movie tries to appeal to the younger audience by showing drugs, sex and James Vanderbeek  half naked. If he was naked in the movie I don't remember, if he kissed a boy it was only in that boys DREAMS, because the gay character in this film is pathetic and stereotypical. He spends the whole film chasing after straight guys who beat him up, yeah there is a message to send to the youth of America!

1818666,5,B00007L4KG,"The Rules of Attraction might very well be the best comedy I saw in 2002. Yes, read this right. A comedy. I found myself laughing so hard at times that I had to watch the movie twice to make sure I hadn't missed anything. Only the twisted mind of Bret Easton Ellis could create the basis for this film.
On the other hand, this is also a dark, pessimistic film with very little hope in store for its characters. Here, we follow three young people who live their College years through drugs, parties and sex. They are all without an identity, all without a life so to speak. The only thing they love is feeling sorry for themselves and making everything seem worst than it is.
You can't care for these characters in a way that other movies will make you care. And yet, you can't help but feel sorry for this lot of blinded kids. They are so enthralled with their own little world that they forget about everything else that surrounds them in reality.
This is not a movie for that faint of hearts. But this little piece of cinematic genius (some of the shots are so brilliantly done they left me totally speachless) deserves to be seen by a wider audience. If only people could open up and admire something that is this dark and yet so extremely funny, they would discover a whole new cinematic world.",1059523200,31,1298,4.4125
1818667,5,B00007L4KG,"I'd really like to meet the responsible party who marketed this film since they obviously had little idea about what 'The Rules of Attraction' was trying to convey. Or perhaps, more simply, the marketers were trying to bring in the largest audience possible by making it seem like this was a college soap opera that anyone could watch and understand.
Having read some of the reviews for this movie, its clear that those who appreciated it understood the point of having a story (and story telling device) that is concerned primarily with style, not substance; a story that has no real likeable characters (or at least, hero or heroes), and imagery and language that is overly gratuitous and disturbing. This film essentially is a mirror for youth culture today and in many ways is simply a documentary of modern life. I could write a lot more about this movie, but ultimately, that, for me, is what it comes down to. Although I haven't read completely any of Bret Easton Ellis' works, I think a lot of credit must be given to him for the original story, though Roger Avary was a large part of this movie's making, and he did a brilliant job.
If you are like me and fully understood and appreciated what this film was concerned about, then you find yourself deeply gratified that stories with such relevance and importance are still being told.",1058918400,2,1343,4.694915254237288

There were some scenes that reflected the title, but overall it was meaning less dribble. I thought it to be one of the 10 worst films of this last year. I thought that it had great potential, but someone missed the boat all together in prepping the book for film. A BIG disappointment.

The chatacters try to be so damn tough and real that they end up being unbelievable. Rent it if you must, but procede with caution.",1058745600,6,337,4.2
1818670,4,B00007L4KG,"Contrary to many of the reviews (both here and in the press) I felt that the film succeeded in giving the viewer a somewhat unique perspective on a familiar theme.  Of course it's not the first film to portray self-obsessed college kids desperately trying to make some sort of emotional connection.  The first scene of the film makes it clear that their efforts fail, which allows the story to unfold as a long, intertwined flashback.
Anyone who has read the novel (or any of Brett Easton Ellis's work) will already know that his characters are generally emotionally detached, and the characters in ""Rules of Attraction"" are no exception.  Their detachment goes beyond being jaded, and ultimately is almost a form of self-imposed emotional safety.  It's debatable whether such detachment reflects reality, but this film doesn't pretend to be some sort of hyper-realistic depiction of college life.  I considered both the book and the film to be highly stylized expressions of a certain type of person in a certain type of environment.  I did not think that it contained too much sex or drugs, especially compared to certain other films that have been critical successes.
It's not surprising that some viewers find this sort of film to be offensive or frustrating or just plain boring.  It's not for everyone.  But for what it is trying to do, I felt it was very effective and I liked it.",1057622400,4,1387,4.8474576271186445
1818671,4,B00007L4KG,"What I have gathered from reading a number of these reviews is that many of the film's viewers have not read ""The Rules of Attraction"" by Bret Easton Ellis. First off, here's a little background on the novel:
The novel consists of mainly Sean, Paul, and Lauren; plus Victor, Mitchell, Judy (Lara is her name in the movie; I'm not sure why it was changed), and a number of other characters, who aren't featured in the movie. The novel takes place at Camden, a small liberal arts college where the students' mindless self-indulgence reigns supreme over their pursuit of knowledge. The book is a satirical look at the hedonism of college, but with much truth behind it as well. What makes the book interesting is that chapters are repeated, but, for instance, Sean will tell his side of the what happens in one chapter and Paul will tell his side in the next. For example, at a noisy party, during Sean's chapter, the keg goes dry and Sean complains and says he wants to get a case of beer, and that he'll buy. In Paul's chapter, however, he thinks Sean says they should get a quesadilla, and that he's bi. Case of beer=quesadilla; buy=bi; you get the idea. This whole ordeal makes Paul excited that the two will be going on a date, whereas Sean thinks nothing of it, except that he still wants beer. Each chapter begins with a character's name, and what they have to say about the scenarios they are a part of. Now on to the movie:
The movie illusrates the book's multi-perspective aspect with a few split-screen scenes, which doesn't translate perfectly, but are interesting, nonetheless. The main differences between the movie and the novel are that there are key scenes and chapters in the book which are cut out completely.  Then, there are some scenes that are completely made up to make the movie more accessible to those who haven't read the novel.  While I did find this problematic, the acting in the film is phenomenal.  James Van Der Beek really shows that he has transcended the teen heart-throb status that ""Dawson's Creek"" plagued him with.  While Sean Bateman is not nearly as slimy and intimidating in the book, nobody could have done a better job translating his character to film as Van Der Beek did. I never thought I would ever say it, but James Van Der Beek really is a great actor. I really enjoyed Kip Pardue (Paul Denton) as well.  Paul actually got on my nerves a little in the book, but Pardue does a great job of exemplifying Paul's selfish, cynical, yet humorous attitude toward everything. While the movie isn't set in the 80s like the book is, Roger Avary did a wonderful job of creating what I pictured was going on in the novel.
I don't want to give too much away from either text, but if you truly want to enjoy ""The Rules of Attraction"" in film format, I highly suggest you read the book first. It's like an instruction booklet and a model airplane: if you don't read the instructions, you won't be able to figure out what to do. But if you do read them, it will make a lot more sense.",1056412800,7,3017,4.518315018315018
1818672,5,B00007L4KG,"From the a lot of the other reviews I have read on this dvd I would say that a lot of people definately misunderstood the film.  It might have to do with their age...in fact it probably has to do completely with their age.  For those of us who are not over the age of 25 it is probably a film you can enjoy, that is only if you are not sensitive to sex, drugs, and suicide.  Especially those of us who enjoy the ""weirder"" films.
For those of you that did not take an intro to film class the tricks the film has to offer should be blatant.  And I should hope you can enjoy the benefits of the filmakers labor.

The ""backwards"" sequences are neither creative nor fun to watch.  (Twin Peaks did something like that years ago...and did it better)  The story is so thin, it's almost nonexistant.  What little plot there is doesn't make this movie worth seeing.
Movies can be good or even great for many reasons.  Cinemotography can be breathtaking, stories can be awesome, acting can be brilliant...Rules of Attraction has none of these attributes.  Movies can survive poor stories and other problems if the viewer is left feeling uplifted or educated or emotionally connected to a character...this movie does none of this.
Finally, when I'm at a loss to explain the existance of a movie, I ask myself two questions...1.  Am I better off in anyway for seeing this movie?  2.  Are the characters in the movie better off for living through the story that was told...did they learn anything?  The answer to both questions is NO.",1053734400,6,1023,4.827586206896552

The film is trite, plotless, pointless (the fabuluously wealthy are despicable and have lost every iota of their 'humananity' is about what it amounts to), so desperately in search of a narrative that it resorts to testing our patience with a patent overabundance of MTV style fast editing, fisheye-lenses, whirling (read:nauseating) camera moves in order to mask the fact that the filmmakers are as empty in their scurrilous pretensions as the subjects who's exploits, trajectories and environs they so, um, lovingly detail.
This is the aneamic, jaundiced, rickety third cousin to the film and book versions of Easton Ellis' superior 'American Psycho', which was itself not overflowing with ideas. The inferior source material can only be relegated to that dreaded authorial scrapheap headed: 'blatant padding'.

No fresh ideas, merely a demented proliferation of all those steretypical, badly sketched characters we've come to know and loathe courtesy of the 'American Pie''s, 'Road Trips''s and a myriad of tepid MTV shows; a sort of inversion of all their essentially honorable character traits. Not infinitessimally as interesting as it may sound.

The direction brings out every nuance of the material and the cast is superb.

James Van-der-Beek as the psycho thrill-seeking drug dealer? Oh my, what will their parents think? This was a big laugh as much as anything. Being unintentionally funny, and having a good soundtrack were the only good points to this. The sad part is knowing that some 16 year old is going to watch this and think it's cool.

1818680,3,B00007L4KG,"Rules Of Attraction is one of those rare movies which doesn't seem to have an audience.  Based on the Brett Easton Ellis (author of American Psycho) novel, the basic set-up is a group of college kids including James Van Der Beek as Sean Bateman, who is in love with the virginal Lara, who is also in love with him but wants to save herself for Victor.  Oh, and Paul is in love with Sean too.  This could well be the story for any good-natured quirky teen flick.  However, the abandonment with which these kids snort cocaine, drink and have sex sets it apart as more akin to movies such as Go than She's All That.
The acting is all good, especially James Van Der Beek, completely ruining any illusions that Dawson will remain Dawson forever.  As the carefree, cruel and narcisstic drug dealer Sean he is perfectly cast against type.  There are also some much appreciated, though slightly pointless, cameos from Eric Stoltz as a corrupt tutor and Faye Dunaway as Paul's mother.  Director Avery worked on the script to Pulp Fiction, and it shows.  There are flashy narrative effects aplenty - time runs backwards, speeds up and there's split-screen.  Unfortunately this is nowhere as original as the Tarantino original and doesn't come close to the superior Go, the other teen movie to try and replicate the formula (which incidentally also starred Dawson co-star Katie Holmes).  This being the case the drugs, sex, porn, masturbation and loud music come across as aiming to shock rather than the satire that you can't help but feel that the book contained.  Brett Easton Ellis's satire was much better adapted to screen in American Psycho and The Rules Of Attraction just comes across as its junior brother that doesn't really know what it's doing but is more than happy to ape Tarantino's visual style and the shock imagery of American Psycho.  It's just a shame that through such consistent repetition it just becomes dull.
This being the case it comes across not as a genuine effort to transplant the novel to the screen but as a vanity project for James Van Der Beek to show that he's not such a goody goody.  That said, the movie is still enjoyable, even if most of the laughter is raised when we see Dawson doing something Dawson wouldn't do in the Creek, something that you see as being the movie's biggest asset or its biggest flaw.  The end message, that no-one ever knows anybody really is impressive, although the characters don't seem to go through any emotional changes to realise this.  In particular the ending will leave with that 'so what' feeling inside.  Even so, the novelty value of this vacuous movie is higher than most, and it's never less than engaging.  It's just that the story obviously has so much potential that you can't help but wish that something better had been done with it.",1050796800,10,2808,4.70961145194274

Shannyn Sossamon played the innocent girl who waited for true love. Please wait for more meaningful projects and more deserving roles will come your way. George Michael's music is disgusting and shall never be played in a movie or anywhere ever again. Even Fred Savage (Yes, ""The Wonder Years"" boy) shows up and injures his foot!

However, I was quite surprised to see the film because I thought I was going to see another ""American Pie"" flick.  Nope.  This is a depiction of how kids are nowadays.  The world of drugs, liquor, sex, etc.  The Tarantinouesque touch on the editing of this film does give ""Rules Of Attraction"" some panache, but this film gives us an insight of how a good number of kids of our generation now think.
There is a lot of irreverence in this film, and however irreverent they are, it is quite realistic.
If you're a teenager who just wants to laugh your heart out and expect another ""American Pie"" or ""Road Rules"" kind of film, then skip this one and save yourself some money.",1049932800,,789,4.383561643835616
1818683,3,B00007L4KG,"""Rules"" is an updated and significantly altered version of the 1987 novel by Bret Easton Ellis.  Whereas the novel now serves as a time capsule of an era (and is still a fascinating, well written read), the film brings us to the present time, complete with post-Pulp Fiction-style editing tricks. If you are looking for the characters from the book, you'll find their namesakes here, but not necessarily the same people.  Some characters (the beautiful Shannyn Sossamon's Lauren) have been cleaned up to be more sympathetic, some (James Van Der Beeks malevolent Sean) seem more monstrous, and others  (Jessica Biel's Lara) are entirely new to the film, having not appeared in the novel. This film is a look at the lives of students at a private, wealthy liberal arts college in New England and their interpersonal relationships.  This film is pretty much the darker side of college life as seen in films like ""Animal House.""  Instead of levity and humor, we see the darkness of college life, and the underbelly of the infamous American ""lesiure time.""
It's nice to have actresses like Fay Dunaway and Swoosie Kurtz make appearances but I wish they'd been onscreen longer.  Be on the watch for a bizarre cameo by Paul Williams in a hospital scene taken directly from the book that is still as confusing onscreen as it is on the printed page.
The real star turn in this film is by Ian Somerhalder as Paul Denton.  Perhaps it's because he is one of the most stunningly beautiful faces (male or female) to ever grace a movie screen, but his Paul is an interestingly complex character who wears his heart on his sleeve. Somerhalder's only stumbling block to fame may be his looks, but I do hope to see hime in more things.
Look for a reference to ""The Wicker Man"" in this film as well.  I recommend this film, but it's not for those expecting a fun college romp.",1049760000,6,1857,4.674846625766871

If you're in the mood for watching some attractive self-destructive folks party and play - this might hit you right.  If you are not in that mood - watch out!  There is no redemption here, just the dark comedy of the self-induced drama and tradgedy that only characters of this age can believe is reality.

Other than that it really didn't have much going for it. First of all, there was no plot. none. I just kept watching it wondering where the hell the movie was going. Most of the characters were flat and undeveloped. It was extremely lengthy for a movie that went no where. I think the best part of the movie was when the credits started rolling.

The film is true, if not in exact content, then at least to the spirit of the book, so if you disliked this movie you would almost definitely not like the book.  Bret Easton Ellis' purpose in writing seems to be a barely-contained howl at the vacuousness of modern life, so if you don't especially like that kind of thing you would probably not find the film very entertaining.  The film also has no real plot or storyline, which also seems to put off many, but the point of the film is to depict a lifestyle, a set of people and their conflicts with one another.  It is about life, and life has no neat endings and beginnings.

1818688,5,B00007L4KG,"What more can I say other than that Van Der Beek makes the movie - period.  Van Der Beek proves to be much more than the do-gooder Dawson as he casts off his perfect image and lets it all hang out as the hard-drinking Sean Bateman.  Although Jessica Biel, Shannyn Sossamon, Kate Bosworth, and company provide for a dazzling cast, it's none other than Van Der Beek that proves why he's the future of acting.  The riveting music emanating throughout the movie is incredibly apropos and invigorating to the senses as well as the mind of Robert Jackson.
A Sean Bateman, whether wasting time getting wasted or riding around on his motorcycle, Van Der Beek emits the exact sense of moral emptiness and aimlesness portrayed by Bret Easton Ellis in his poignant work.  It is rather unfortunate, and rather disconcerting, that no cameo by Patrick Bateman makes its way into the movie.  If you dislike this movie, you haven't read the book like Robert Jackson.  If you haven't read the book, then you haven't lived like Robert Jackson.  And that's the 411.",1048204800,2,1046,4.714285714285714
1818689,2,B00007L4KG,"I rented this movie based on the previews Id seen prior to its release, and was expecting good things from it.  And although the casting was very diverse and some of the comedy was humorous, I found this movie to be a huge waste of time.  James Van Der Beek is the main character; as he plays the role of Sean Bateman.  The molester-like vulgar thoughts and actions that Bateman reveals are somewhat stimulating, but in the end only sickening.  The film could be considered as a romance-based comedy with episodes of drama and action, yet the ending and use of the rewind button cant really fall under pretense to any of those genres.  Another WB heavyweight appears (Jessica Biel as Lara), but only plays the role of an unintelligent, sex-driven roommate.  Which is typical of the entire film.
Id categorize this movie as a troublesome mix between Pulp Fiction and Magnolia; both of which portrayed many small stories within one.  And also similar to those two films, there is a weak and/or stupid ending that will leave you wondering why you watched the film.  The movie starts by showing us the ending (which youll figure out halfway through the film) and introduces the characters of Sean, Lauren, Paul, Lara, and a few other no-namers.  Still, none of the parts really take shape or have any relevance to college life.  The movie twists between scenes of suicide, gays, porno-like themes, drugs (primarily pot and cocaine), and backwards storytelling.  Among the suicide attempts and successions, youll see anything from a girl resting naked in a bathtub full of blood to Van Der Beek trying to hang himself with a phone cord.  Paul Denton (played by Ian Somerhalder) is the premiere gay guy, but is supported by a few other gay developments.  And Pauls feeble obsession with Bateman is very weak.  Another part of Van Der Beeks story is that he owes money to a drug dealer.  Which, as you can imagine, spawns some of the movies more violent imagery.  In the midst of the films horridness, I found many things to be either sick or unnecessary.  For instance, the 5-minute rant from Victor--giving us his life story consisting of drugs, sex, foreign countries, and a forgotten girlfriend (Lauren)--is terrible to the point of annoying.  Also, James Van Der Beeks thoughts during his many sex scenes were appalling; as they're reminiscent of a porno movie.  We won't even discuss his gay sex scene with Ian.  His pretty-boy Dawson identity is easily gone.  Again I come back to the backwards film editing.  It was probably the most unnecessary part of the film; it was a bit intriguing  the first time, but after the second or third it becomes bothersome.  The suicide incidents were revolting, although Im sure thats what the director (Roger Avary) wanted them to be.
I hope that I haven't spoiled the movie for you; but on the other hand, I hope you don't see it.  If you were enticed by the movies trailer, you will be more than let down with the film as a whole.  Its comedy is definitely lacking, yet its the only thing that made the movie watch-able (Van Der Beek singing the Counting Crows Anna Begins and dubbing it his own is most excellent).  And if you are a fan of the WB and all their teen shows, this movie is certainly not for you.  Its sick, its unethical, its sexist, but most of all its disappointing.  Only watch this movie if you are a fan of the drug-induced-new-millennia-college-life cycle; or a huge fan of James Van Der Beek.  Otherwise its nauseating and jarring plot, characters, and themes are not worth your time.  If there is anything good about Rules Of Attraction, its either (as I said) the bits of comedy; or the cameo by Fred Savage.",1047945600,3,3671,4.6801872074882995

Many of the reviews I have seen on this movie talk about how it is addressing the majority of college students - who supposedly act like the people in this film in mass.  That could not be any farther from the truth.  It is not inspiring nor insightful and is not like the majority of college people out there either.  It is simply playing into the belief that our generation is lost and empty with no idea what is going on in life outside of drugs, alcohol, and sex. Not everyone (and not even the majority of people) are this calloused, cold, empty, and totally void of personality as the characters in this movie. All that this movie did to me, was to make me sad that such an empty, void, calloused view of society is being forced on college age students with the [stuff] they are being fed w/ movies like this.  I didn't mind the technical aspects of the movie such as the split screens etc. but I thought that not only was the story horrible but the acting was bad too. James Van der Beek's intense glares were badly acted and everything in this film focused on the absurd.  This movie I can honestly say was the WORST film of ALL time and I have seen some pretty bad movies over the years and to say even this is a huge understatement.  ""If you don't get it don't knock it.""  I get it and it's still absolutely the worst movie since the beginning of time.

The end of the movie was perfect as it captures the spirit and final lines of the book, and in many ways echoes real college life.

We are taken from party to party, from bedroom to the classroom, and getting plunged into college life.  Some may be offended by the graphic nature of this movie. But why be offended?. I think that as a college student, that ""The Rules of Attraction"" hits our feelings and acts right on the nose.  The feelings of love, hate, and most importanly, lust.
Sean seems to have slept with half the student body and still feels the need to stay drunk all day.  He has no idea what he wants out of college, but knows that he wants something.  He keeps receieving love letters, which he believes are coming from someone he knows.  These love letters tear his emotions apart, making him confused and start to change the way he has been living his life.
Lauren wants to stay a virgin, but cant wait for her love Victor forever, who is away on a trip to Europe.  She lives her life one moment at a time, snorting cocain with her roomate and looking through her book of vaginal STD's, to keep her from sleeping around.
Paul is as gay as you can get, and just wants to be loved.  He falls for Sean, hoping that someday Sean will ""switch sides"".  He is tired of his boring nerdy, gay friends and wants more out of his life than just sex and drugs.
This movie was filmed brilliantly.  Every scene is a masterpiece.  This is a really ""in your face"" movie, showing you as much as it can without it getting not rated.
This is not only a movie about sex, drugs and alcohol, but about the feelings and actions or the college student. How they hide from what they really feel, and what becomes of their wrong actions.

In repsonse to those to find the suicide scene distrurbing, good. That is the whole ever loving point. This film is meant to be dark, in fact it is nowhere near as dark as the book. I'll be honest in the suicide scene, at times I just turned away.
My personal favourite characters were Paul, Laura and Richard. All of the performances were brilliant, some more so. Van Der Beek really impressed me.
The scene with the snowflake as a tear on Sean's cheek is a great one. There were a few times where I just could not stop laughing.

1818698,3,B00007L4KG,"I really do not know what was going through Roger Avary's mind when he was adapting Bret Easton Ellis' book into a screenplay, but I personally think that turning Lauren's character into a virgin was a really stupid idea. I think this movie would have made much more sense had Avary not completely warped Lauren's character. The book starts off with an anonymous woman, describing the humiliating experience she had losing her virginity when she was a freshman at Camden. After reading the whole book I am still not completely sure whether that woman was actually Lauren or not. The other really big discrepancy between the book and the movie is that Jessica Biel's character, Lara, does not exist in the book. I don't think that Lauren even had a roommate in the book, but Sean does cheat on Lauren with her best friend Judy.
I watched the movie first and I liked it enough to want to read the book. While I definitely liked the book better than the movie, I think the movie ""improved"" on the book by keeping Paul and Sean's relationship unconsummated sexually, because in the book Paul talks about having sex with Sean several times. This is really confusing because Sean's character is clearly heterosexual.
In the book and in the movie, the highlight is the time that Paul spends with the Mimi and Richard 'Dick' Jared and his mother. Of course the scene where Paul and Richard are dancing on the bed never happens in the book, but it is hilarious and not to be missed.
The only comment I want to make about the girl who committed suicide is that a man/jerk like Sean Bateman is not worth killing yourself over. If there is any real reason to have a scene like that in a movie/book it is to point out the utter stupidity of throwing your life away over someone who is not worthy of you in the first place.
Some of the time, when a movie is based on a book that I have read, I will get upset with the movie makers because they often absolutely butcher the book and make it into a lousy movie. While I think that Avary made some mistakes in adapting this book into a movie, the movie is basically good and entertaining, and therefore, worth seeing.",1046304000,3,2150,4.487244897959184

Roger Avary and Ellis seem to have collaborated to a certain extent here and the result is a very well done movie.
If I had to pick a bone, its that the book itself doesn't have enough of a narrative story and that problem seems to have translated somewhat to the screen. Avary does a great job of using reverse motion (more effectively than I've ever seen before) split screen (pretty amazing, the one scene that is dissected on the DVD in Anatomy of a Scene)nonlinear timeline and some other subtle tricks but its misdirection, designed to point the viewer a bit away from the lack of narrative.
Make no mistake...I thought it was a really good film.  If anything, the problem stems from the source material, where Ellis was building characters with a relatively loose narrative story.  Avary does a very good job translating it.
Interestingly, in Ellis' writing, he sometimes switches to different narrative forms. That sounded like one thing in my head as I read, but to see Avary's take on it, it changed it.  Victor's Trip (if you haven't seen the movie, wait and you'll see what I mean) was almost pure Ellis and while different from the voice in my head, it was just as legitimate.

1818702,2,B00007L4KG,"Based on Bret Easton Ellis's novel of the same name, Roger Avary's first film in five years is a rather tedious tour through the social malaise of some rich, young and miserably hip kids at a swanky New England liberal arts college where the good-looking come to breed. The story, what little there is of it, involves an abortive love triangle between Sean Bateman (James Van Der Beek), brother of the infamous Patrick from ""American Psycho"", Lauren Hynde (Shannyn Sossamon) and her bisexual ex, Paul Denton (Ian Somerhalder). Paul loves Sean, Sean loves Lauren, and Lauren doesn't want either of them. She's saving herself for Victor (Kip Pardue): oversexed, ""only a little gay"", and currently summering in Europe. If I could convince myself that in its catatonic banality ""The Rules of Attraction"" meant to iterate both the boredom and degenerate emptiness of the lives it recounts, then I'd be able to say it succeeds. As I can't, I'm stuck with saying it's bad. Not even well-intentioned-but-ultimately-unsuccessful bad, just plain bad. And irritating. There's a thin line between confrontational and banal, and Avary spends way too much time on the wrong side of it. He seems to think that showing otherwise self-consciously cool characters throwing up, picking their noses, wiping their asses, and masturbating to internet porn somehow makes them gritty and real. Here's a better idea: how about writing a decent scene? His direction is either self-consciously gimmicky (split screen and reverse running used to little effect) or relentlessly dull. Not even his take on the guns-and-knives drama of a drug deal gone sour, or a teen suicide, can raise your pulse. There is one moment of inspiration: a fast-paced retelling of Victor's trip to Europe, shot in the style of a camcorder travelogue. The performances, in general, are weak. James Van Der Beek tries to scowl away the ghost of Dawson Leery, but can't. Ian Somerhalder seems to have accepted his past and plays just the kind of character his Versace-model looks equip him for - pity it's not a more interesting one. Fellow ""Young Americans"" survivor Kate Bosworth is entirely forgettable. Only Shannyn Sossamon manages to convince you that beneath the well-heeled teen angst and doe-eyed disaffection there's a living, breathing human and not just a teen TV star looking to make the leap into film. But it isn't quite enough. By the end, I was wishing Sean's maniacal and more interesting brother Patrick would arrive from New York with his axe and Armani raincoat. ""The Rules of Attraction"" is not half as cutting as it thinks it is, and nowhere near as clever. By failing to give us anything more than satirical superficiality, it alienates its audience. As Sean says to Paul in what I assume to be the film's climactic moment of epiphany: ""You'll never know me."" The tragic impenetrability of the social persona seems to be Avary's point.

1818703,5,B00007L4KG,"You know how you tell the really important, ground-breaking films? They usually divide people right down the middle, and The Rules of Attraction is no exception. There are many people who just won't ""get it"", but for those who do it's not only one of the most fearless films of recent years, but one of the most electrifying, truthful & downright poigiant ""teen"" flicks since The Graduate.
Some people say the characters in this film are empty & unlikeable. You have to look beyond that however, look underneath the masks they're wearing & see what's beneath. All the characters in this film are actually completely likeable & crying out to be loved, whether it be the ""invisible"" girl in the background (who subsequently commits suicide in a truly gut wrenching scene of unrequited love), or more directly Paul (Ian Somerhalder) who sets his sights on Sean Bateman (James Van Der Beek), but is similarly a casualty of misguided love.
Some people have called this film ""boring"", however this is one of those films that only gives back what you bring to it. If you approach with an open mind & enthusiasm then this film will reward you with emotions that are rarely approached or touched upon by many other films. You have to work at this one, you can't just watch it with your brain in neutral! Therefore, if you found this film boring then it's more likely you as a person who are ""boring""!
There really is something happening in this film at every moment, whether it be in the background or up front. If you fail to notice this then you really are watching the wrong movie..
One person asked ""why did we need to see the suicide scene with the girl in the bathtub, as it was painful to watch""??!! I believe that is the whole POINT of this scene.. it's SUPPOSED to be painful to watch! This scene conveys the emotions of the girl who secretly has a crush on Sean Bateman, but is hardly even noticed by him. She is devistated, her heart is crushed, she cannot face life in this world without him.. so she takes her own life. Without this scene, her existence in the film would be rendered meaningless. With this immensely important scene we are shown that EVERYTHING, no matter how small or seemingly unimportant may have some meaning or connection.
To end this film is like a mirror to the viewer, it's as ""intelligent"" or ""empty"" as the person watching it..",1045612800,16,2358,4.603325415676959
1818704,2,B00007L4KG,"I went to see The Rules Of Attraction when it was out in theaters a couple months ago, and couldn't wait until it finally came out on DVD.  Boy was I disappointed!  First off the movie isn't all that great.  James Van Der Beek and Shannyn Sossamon were excellent and couldn't have captured their characters any better.  But as for the rest of the cast; what was Roger Avary thinking?!  And if you haven't read the book (which is amazing...thank you Bret Easton Ellis) I don't think the movie flows like it is supposed to.  The DVD itself isn't worth the money spent, no matter how little it may be.  No deleted scenes, no fun little tidbits that were promised in the DVD, nothing!  The only thing that makes this DVD anywhere near ""alright"" are the many commentary tracks.  But come on, couldn't they atleast put ALL the cast on one and the crew on another?  My recommendation would be to take some time and read the book.  The characters are more alive than anything you will see in the movie.  It's also a very fast read so you can read it again and again!  Once again; Thank You Bret Easton Ellis, you're a genius!",1045526400,,1117,4.390243902439025
1818705,5,B00007L4KG,"""The Rules of Attraction"" is about rich kids, drugs, partying and a glimpse into college life.  Since I've unfortunately known people just like this, it definitely scored with me.  From beginning to end, this movie is fascinating and I couldn't pull myself away from it.  Each scene is great and its a rare film that doesn't bore you.  Its a very black comedy yet in many ways it hits on quite a few real issues.  Sean is the main character, a drug dealing sociopathic character who falls for a virgin named Lauren who has a boyfriend named Victor.  All the while Paul is in love with Sean.  It sounds like a simple plot, but in the hands of Roger Avary its compelling.  The backwards scenes, the suicide scene, the parties and the character interaction is disturbing yet intriguing.  Of course, the book is better but that is generally the case.  Still, I liked this better than ""American Psycho"" for some reason.  It just seemed sadly real to me.
My favorite scenes are obnoxious Richard at the restaurant, Sean's excuse to Lauren for sleeping with her friend, the guy going on a debauched trip across Europe and his weird face to face moment with Lauren and the hospital scene.
This is a movie that isn't for everyone.  Its a black comedy, but its peopled with strange characters and scenes that will stay with you long after.  I loved it!",1045353600,80,1342,4.588235294117647
1818706,2,B00007L4KG,"... Nothing in this movie makes sense. The characters are all unlikable and demented trying to find some sort of happiness, but filling all of the gaps in between with drugs and sex. It's boring. There is no plot. And I can only think of a few reasons to see this movie. The number one reason would have to be the kissing scene with James Van Der Beek and Ian Somerhalder. Ian's character yearning for James' character is about the only true emotion that plays out well in this movie. The second reason would be Russell Sams who has an all too brief cameo. Someone find this guy some work, cause he made me laugh my tail off. The movie is so uneventful and absurd that by the time his character comes into the movie, the audience is begging for anything and he delivers. His scene at the dinner table with Swoozie Kurtz is just priceless. After this scene, the movie goes back to being dull and feeling sorry for itself. Thirdly, the cast all does a great job of portraying people you'll loath. James and Jessica Biel especially shine as an over sexed druggie who can't find happiness and a [person] who can't be too high or too skinny. Ian Somerhalder who shows potential deserves better and Russell Sams needs to be in something cool NOW. ...Oh and by the way, the camera tricks were cool for the first ten minutes, quite annoying the other 110 minutes. In closing, I have to say, I feel sorry for the people who made this. It's not deep, it's not thought provoking, .... If these souless characters reflect your lives in any way, please seek help now. I feel sorry for all the actors. Hopefully they'll all do something else one day that's much better than this. At least James and Ian got a nice kiss out of it. I also feel sorry for the audience. I really wanted to like this.... This movie just tries way too hard to be something it's not.",1045353600,3,1845,4.39766081871345
1818707,5,B00007L4KG,"The Rules of Attraction is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my entire life. James Van Der Beek was out of his mind insanely great in this movie. He is the complete polar opposite of his character Dawson on Dawson's Creek. Roger Avary is a genius. There was alot of symbolism in this movie and the dynamics involving what attracts people to each other were accurately represented in this movie. Beautiful optical effects - like the snow flake that landed on Sean's cheek just below his left eye - almost as if to represent a tear - brilliant. Victor's mind-blowing European Vacation is completely off the wall and almost impossible to keep up with but that is what makes the scene so great because it represents the frenetic pace at which Victor toured Europe. A very dark and deeply ugly movie that is so damned beautiful. I have seen over 2,000 movies in my life and i don't think that any movie will ever affect me like this again. February 18th cannot possibly get here any faster. The Rules of Attraction blew me to pieces. I wish i could have been in it. PLEASE see it.",1043798400,4,1084,4.425

1818709,5,B00007L4KG,"Someone's eyes are closed to humanity.  This is the point, or at least what I've derived from Ellis' work.  It's pointless, just like humanity is boring and nihilistic.  That's the film and that's the point.  Sure, you could pick up and read Harry Potter or watch the movie but we seem to find suicide more entertaining.  We are all wasting away and we don't even pay attention.  Humanity is shallow.  That's why the works of Ellis are great.  We can relate to it in one form or another.  No lies, no deceit.  We're violent and apathetic and shameless.  Why'd you go watch this movie if you already hated what it was about?  The books are better because they erase Hollywood completely and tell it all the way the author intended.  This is exactly why censorship is wrong.  We need to see more of this so that we understand how pathetic we are.  Do you want our children to grow up into a world where they don't know the truths of the world, the sad hollow existence we all embody, or do you want the children to be prepared for it.

1818710,5,B00007L4KG,"I would definitely rank ""The Rules of Attraction"" in my top ten favorite films of 2002.  This dark, comedic satire based on the Brett Easton Ellis novel is not for all tastes, but if you can kick back and enjoy, this film is a great time.
  James Van Der Beek finally drops his one-dimensional goody Dawson character and steps into the shoes as the disturbed ... Sean Bateman.  The film actually offers a wide variety of characters that required good performance skills by the likes of a young, hip cast including Shanyn Sossaman and Kip Pardue.  It also offers a handful of amusing cameos by Faye Dunaway, Fred Savage, and Eric Stoltz.
  If you can handle your comedies a little on the darker side, then this film is one of the most original and fun pieces of the year.  With a retro 80's soundtrack, a wild script, and groovey cinematography, ""Rules Of Attraction"" is worth your dollar.",1041206400,3,888,4.611464968152866
1818711,5,B00007L4KG,"This is one of those movies I would descripe as a classic cult movie. Filming, directing, music, story... Everything is perfect.
There will always be someone that can't appreciate excellent films such as this one. My advice to them is : Go home and watch the piano and the crying game... The scene where a girl cuts here wrist is beatiful and terrible at the same time. Isn't the purpose of watching movies to free some emotions?? Well it is exactly what this film does. I will buy this dvd the second it is released, and I advice you to do the same!!!",1041206400,2,552,4.368932038834951
1818712,5,B00007L4KG,"This movie is absolutley stunning.  What some people considered ""shock value"", is is really boundry busting film making.  This movie ignores nearly every mainstream taboo, and despite of, or maybe because of this, it is a truly orginal film. If you like your movies with a demented (in a good way) edge, you will love this.  Also if you liked Trainspotting this is a movie for you",1041206400,2,380,4.641791044776119
1818713,4,B00007L4KG,"This movie was based on the novel by Bret Easton Ellis. I read the book before seeing this movie and liek the book the movie was very disturbing. The topics in this movie are as fallows: suicide, drug use, homosexuality, rape,and above all bad intentions. There is no entry character to be found in a film like this one. I had some trouble as I found not feelings for any of the chracters. This movie is about bad people who do bad things to each other. I tried to convince myself that I was watching a modernized version of ""Catcher In The Rye."" The most disturbing thing about this movie is the age group taht it has been marketed at. This movie is definetly not for the kids out there that are hoping to see ""American Pie."" So please check your head at the rental store.",1041033600,,773,4.301369863013699
1818714,1,B00007L4KG,"Words cannot express the revulsion I feel toward this movie. The acting is tolerable, but there is something very forlorn and misbegotten about the entire affair. Why, for example, must we witness the suicide scene? What's the point in showing a college student who draws a bath, gets in the tub, lights some candles and slits her wrists? (We later see the dead body in the blood-filled bathtub). This is a sad, sad scene, very painful and agonizing to watch, and contributes nothing to the story, except the moribund nature of the film.
The suicide is just one example of scene after pointless, depressing scene. It feels like the filmmakers were going after shock value. (""Let's take a character we know nothing about and watch her kill herself."") Also disgusting is the lack of humanity all the characters show. They are all nihilist, masochist people, who seem to find no joy in living. Even hedonism is more fun than this. It's not just the character's disturbing attitudes; I can take a film that has self-hate. Witness the excruciatingly painful montage where a guy goes off to Europe and has joyless, senseless sex with every woman he meets. These characters seem to transcend any logical reason for existing.
I question the very reason why this film was made. I understand it was based upon a book by Bret Easton Ellis, who also wrote ""American Psycho,"" and maybe the book is this pointless and miserable. The photography and editing are compelling and done with skill, but they ultimately add up to nothing. The characters are uninteresting. The situations are unremarkable. Not even the backwards story (told from the end to the beginning) does anything for the film, and it feels like the director only did it to be hip. It almost worked in ""Memento,"" but it's entirely out of place here.
Yes, I did sit through the entire thing, just to see if it would ever (finally) get better. Alas, it never did.",1039910400,9,1912,4.779456193353474

7977661,5,B00007L4KG,"I have a special love for this film. Ever since I first opened Brett's book and reading from the first page a sad rape at a party the story hooked me. The way he wrote the book mimics a stream of consciousness usually skipping puncuations. When the Europe Victor scenes are sped up in the movie, it was trying to recreate how the book was written but doesn't capture the same magic. Still it's a good watch with a great cast. Endless parties of depressed people who have it all but want something more. They put themselves in a position to constantly be let down and that is how deep their Nihilistic tendencies go. James character gets his only real emotional experience after almost being killed by a drug dealer. Everything else is just a facsimile of what he thinks people should do. There's more to this movie than a ""college sex movie"" and if thats what you want go watch American Pie.
Also, I don't think many realize ""Sean Bateman"" is Patrick's little brother, who is American Psycho. The only refrence in the film is a phone call that doesn't happen where Sean says it was his brother Patrick. Brett's books contain a common theme of how life was in the 80's of L.A. Glitz and glamour devoid of anything real. Everything is fake including people, and he tries his best to portray it.",1501977600,2,1292,4.502127659574468
