Although each movie is only 30 minutes long ... the stories are mature and full bodied enough to intrigue adults. Price is right too :) ""Izu Dancer"" = wise purchase",1179187200,3,308,4.517857142857143
7979164,3,B0000844HY,"The ""Animated Classics of Japanese Literature"" DVDs coming from Central Park Media put three episodes on a disc, as opposed to the two offered per VHS tape on the series' initial release, and try to link them thematically. Here the two-part ""Botchan"" is joined by ""Student Days,"" both stories about education in Japan at the end of the 19th century. ""Botchan"" is a condensation of a famous novel by Natsume Soseki (written in 1906 and available in English) that details the experiences of Botchan, a young man from Tokyo who takes a job teaching physics in a middle school in a small mountain town. ""Student Days,"" by Kume Masao, follows the efforts of a young man to study for a college entrance exam in the face of distractions provided by a budding romance.

The initial scenes in ""Botchan"" show the young teacher facing boorish behavior from his ""imbecile"" students who make fun of his innocuous extracurricular activities such as eating noodles at a local restaurant and traveling regularly to the hot springs a half-hour's walk from town. But his biggest problems come from school administrators who turn out to be backstabbing, mildly corrupt and not terribly supportive. He initially distrusts a fellow teacher (whom he dubs ""Porcupine"" for the way his hair sticks up), but they soon become allies and work out a plan to embarrass the administrators.

In ""Student Days,"" young Kenkichi stays with his married sister so he can study for the upcoming entrance exam to a prestigious nearby college (after failing the year before), but is soon distracted by the initially supportive presence of the beautiful Eiko, whom he quickly falls in love with. However, the arrival of his more studious younger brother, Kenji, who also plans to take the exam, soon complicates matters, both academically and romantically.

Both tales are unmistakably downbeat. ""Botchan"" is not terribly deep and doesn't have much in the way of emotional highs and lows. The young man has bad experiences at a teaching job in a small town and that's basically all that happens. ""Student Days"" is a little more interesting because of the romantic angle, the suspense over whether Kenkichi will pass the test, and the genuine sexual tension that results when a sort of love triangle develops. The characters are more compelling and we do care what happens to them.

""Botchan"" does offer a highly evocative portrait of small-town life at the end of the 19th century when modern schools and commuter railroads are plunked down in a small Japanese town that seems traditional in every other way. The backgrounds are beautifully rendered and punch up the proceedings with a visual artistry that keeps viewers interested even if the story doesn't. ""Student Days"" has much stronger character design than ""Botchan"" and shows a much more bustling, urban environment of roughly the same era.

While the material here is not as strong as that in the other three DVDs released so far in the ""Animated Classics"" series, fans should see this volume anyway for the way it manages to paint a delicate portrait of how ordinary Japanese once lived not so very long ago in that period of upheaval when Japan was seeking to modernize, divest itself of feudal ways, and join the new world it had shut out for so long.",1128211200,6,3272,4.920289855072464
7979165,4,B0000844HY,"Some of the episodes in the ""Animated Classics of Japanese Literature"" TV series from 1986 are so beautifully designed and executed they're like watching traditional Japanese art unfold in motion across the screen. This is especially true of two episodes on this disc. ""The Izu Dancer,"" from a story by Yasunari Kawabata, focuses on a high school student traveling through the country region of Izu who is drawn to a girl from a family of traveling dance performers. It features a series of lush background paintings of the mountainous Izu region in all its autumnal glory, as well as detailed renderings of the resort towns where the family stops to perform.

""Ghost Story"" is based on a story by Lafcadio Hearn (a Greek-born American writer credited here under his Japanese name, Koizumi Yakumo) about a blind player of the ""biwa"" (a four-stringed instrument like a lute) who is called on to perform the tale of the brutal end of the Heike (or Taira) Clan before a ghostly audience. The story is grounded in memories of the historic battle to the death between the Heike and Genji clans in 1185 and takes place in a village near the site of the battle. The artwork draws on traditional paintings of Japanese occult lore and includes the famous scene of the Buddhist monk writing holy sutras in ink all over the body of the blind musician in order to ward off the ghosts (a scene also recreated in Masaki Kobayashi's live-action film version from 1964, KWAIDAN).

The other story on this disc, ""The Dancing Girl,"" by Mori Ogai, takes place in Berlin in the late 19th century and tells of a romance between a Japanese man working as a translator and a poor German dancer and the difficulties faced when the man's employers seek to send him back to Japan. While it's not as steeped in Japanese culture as the other episodes in this series, its visual style recalls many other Japanese animated works based on European literature, most notably the 1970s TV series, ""Heidi, Girl of the Alps"" and ""Dog of Flanders.""

The DVD transfers enhance the imagery and allow it to shine in a way that couldn't be appreciated as fully on VHS. The linework is stronger, the colors brighter, the subtleties of the shading more visible and the overall effect more breathtaking. Fans for whom anime has spurred a deeper interest in Japanese art, culture and history should seek out this series for the insights it offers into Japanese customs, social codes and ways of life that existed during the years when Japan had one foot in the modern world and one in the feudal era. We sincerely hope that the 21 additional episodes previously released on tape will join the 12 that have so far made it to DVD (in four volumes).",1107043200,14,2701,4.706131078224101
