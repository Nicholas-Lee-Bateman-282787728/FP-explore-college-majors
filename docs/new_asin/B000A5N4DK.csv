8074637,5,B000A5N4DK,"I was a brown belt in Shotokan many years ago and I was looking for a Kata refresher DVD. I was hesitant at first because the title says ""Beginner's Guide..."" but Jim Wilson, with impeccable form, teaches Kata from Taikyoku Shodan, the five Heian through Bassai Dai kata in such a way that even well practiced karateka can learn much about these forms. I wish Wilson would make a DVD with most of the higher Shotokan katas for black belts. This is a great way to either subsidize your learning with a sensei, or to refresh your kata.",1240617600,4,533,4.448979591836735

8074639,5,B000A5N4DK,I bought this training dvd to help me learn the  kata forms. I showed it to my instructor and he  says its the best guide he has ever seen for beginners to help them learn these karate forms. I have bought other Beginner Guide dvds from the same instructor  and I think all his stuff is excellent. He breaks down each form and teaches each individual move and shows some moves from different angles just as it is taught in class so I can easily follow . So if  you want to learn the first 8 kata of the shotokan karate system then this is the dvd for you . I rate it 5 stars.,1136851200,7,575,3.973913043478261
