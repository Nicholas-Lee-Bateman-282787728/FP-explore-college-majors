8040866,4,B0006A9F5U,"This movie billed as the ""Boys don't Cry"" of the Middle east. Actually it does bear some similarities in themes, ie a girl who dresses up as a boy. That is were the similarity ends.  The main character in this story dresses as a boy because of family expectations and the need to make a living, which apparently can only be achieved as a boy carpet weaver.  This is a story with a lot of integrity and the film maker makes the point that life in hard for this characters.  The master in the weaving factory is terse and brutal.  The pace is plodding with hardly any dialogue but it is strangely compelling and the quiet dignity of the heroine is rivetting.",1352160000,,656,4.352459016393443
