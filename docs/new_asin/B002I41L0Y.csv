3935557,4,B002I41L0Y,"As a Beginner, I was fairly satisfied with this DVD.  The presenter spoke at a slow enough pace for anyone to look down at their hands before playing, with enough time to check back at the screen again and play along with him.

Chords and nothing but Chords---Major / Minor.  This DVD is perfect for touching the surface of accompanying guitar.

In the end though, for the price, there could have been much more...but don't get me wrong, it's quality learning.",1302048000,7,460,4.6419753086419755
3935558,5,B002I41L0Y,"This is a terrific instruction DVD. Granted, I was motivated and really wanted to learn some chords to start playing quickly.  Well, I was up and running in no time. Ravi has a nice manner, explains things simply and well, and if you follow his instruction and practice a bit, you'll be playing in no time. Note that this is to learn a handful of chords and a couple of strumming techniques, but it's enough to get you going and whet your appetite.  I was very pleased.",1264809600,17,469,4.379310344827586
3935569,2,B002I41L0Y,decent video but not all it says it is....have to download a lot of things ...most importantly the list of songs it talks about to practice with is no where to be found or downloadable. Do not recommend ......,1427414400,7,209,4.384615384615385

3935572,5,B002I41L0Y,i wish there were more of these by the same teacher...so Great and easy to understand.  wonderful for beginners!!!,1418947200,,114,5.0
3935573,2,B002I41L0Y,VERY simplistic for someone who knows nothing about guitar and doesn't really go in depth much. Keeps talking about some list of songs but never got list with the DVD and the things they tell you to download didn't work unless you pay more so never had songs to work with.  I'm sure there is better out there so keep looking,1401667200,3,324,4.311475409836065
3935574,5,B002I41L0Y,A great way to get started and to be able to feel comfortable with your guitar. Very highly recommended !,1393891200,,105,4.3
3935575,5,B002I41L0Y,"Got it on my ipad. Very different learning experience. Whether i finish the course can be uncertain, but the ease of having it on ipad and watching it anytime was good. After finishing one video, the next launches automatically which is far better for me. Better than having a book left on the shelf unread, unfinished. Possibility of Downloading the episodes for offline viewing is another plus.",1381536000,,396,4.925373134328358
3935576,3,B002I41L0Y,"The package is not really ""user friendly"". You have to go online and download files to print out and then use them in conjunction with the CD in the package........ It gets pretty confusing for a beginner, an old beginner.",1377820800,6,222,4.575
3935577,5,B002I41L0Y,"I am learning to play guitar and have bought a number of books and videos, and I think this is the best video for beginners so far.

It spends some time on little details of holding and strumming that many other materials gloss over.  It also uses a lot of repetition and does not throw too much at you too fast.  Good practice for switching between common chords.

I am about a quarter way through it and it is helping me out.

This will not make you an expert in 21 days, but it will get you playing some common chords / songs which is a big boost for a beginner like me.",1364083200,16,573,4.035398230088496
3935578,5,B002I41L0Y,I purchased this product for my 12 year old grandson and it has many good points. He will be using the product frequently.,1320451200,,122,4.3478260869565215

8370663,1,B002I41L0Y,No it was not what I expected I was looking for something step by step to help me learn to play my guitar this was definitely not that.,1459468800,,135,3.857142857142857
8370664,3,B002I41L0Y,OK book. Nothing great or special. Could get the same info off the internet. The downloadable material wasn't worth the effort!!,1451433600,,128,5.142857142857143

Easy to fallow lessons.",1449187200,,126,4.521739130434782
8370666,2,B002I41L0Y,"This did not include all of the material advertised.  Its a good starter DVD for a beginner,  but the teacher is too inflexible in his directions.  ""Do it the way I say, not the way I do""",1445472000,,187,4.0
