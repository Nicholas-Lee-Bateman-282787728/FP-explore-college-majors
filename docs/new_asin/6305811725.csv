1082052,4,6305811725,"The theatrical release of this last film about the New Jack version of Philip Marlowe had a humorous cuture shock gag in one scene that I wish had made it into this version. While in Africa trying to bust a slavery ring, Shaft happens upon a handful of local men, who glare at him and chant; ""Yan-kee-go-home, yan-kee-go-home!"" His reaction is one of hurt feelings, of course. Like any other American of immigrant roots who goes back to the Old Country, he expects to be made to feel like he's come back home. Instead, he's just another tourist. There's other interesting material that did make it this far, though. Like the gendarme in Paris that pleads with Shaft to let the police do their job--you don't have to be Vic Anrozzi (""Shaft"") or Pete Bollin (""Big Score"") to have huge problems with a civilian like Shaft. Like Shaft's contact in Addis Ababa who responds with confusion to Shaft's ""give me five"" handshake: ""What is the meaning of this gesture?"" Like a great car chase with Shaft behind the wheel of a pregnant-rollerskate subcompact--a far cry from his thundering Mopar in ""Big Score"". The producers resist the temptation to flood the streets with dozens of Citroen cop cars blaring ""NEH-neh-NEH-neh"" and plowing into each other, thank God! Shaft protests that he's more Sam Spade than James Bond when given a Q-type hidden gizmo, only to later wind up in bed with the oversexed mistress of the top man in the slavery racket in the hottest bedroom scene of the whole trilogy. Plus he's more like 007 in the way he responds to the deaths of friends and allies with as much grief as anger. Over this trilogy, Shaft has developed as a person--we've already seen hints of that in his role as a mourner at the funeral of his friend in ""Big Score"". In the first film, we knew that he was a bad mutha shut-your-mouth, but now we know he has a heart. Good for you, Mr. Shaft--if you'd carried the hardboiled Marlowe number too far, that can swing over into cold-blooded.",979257600,,1977,4.619318181818182
1082053,5,6305811725,"Probably the best of the sequels, but not as good as the original Shaft. This film, which takes our hero to ""The Motherland"", and across Europe, to break up a slavery ring, has some great fight scenes, and a  great ""Shaft girl."" This movie also boasts a great title song  sung by the Four Tops! Great movie, lots of fun, and perfect for fans of  the Shaft films, and the whole Black Cinema genre. Definetly worth a look.",961372800,2,420,4.358974358974359
1082054,5,6305811725,"Hard-core fans of the original Shaft, people who have viewed the movie at least a dozen times, will find a viable gem in Shaft In Africa. Roundtree delivers the goods with the charm and natural  humor the heavens bequeathed  to him. The first twenty minutes provide the viewer with hilarious scences  and great quotable lines that should be tried at every dinner party and  date. Here's one of my favorites:""What's this slave jive, huh?""  or ""Is that American or Hong Kong?"" See, I told you that they  were marvelous-and well written(the screen-writer Sterling Silliphant won  an Oscar for In the Heat of the Night). Shaft once again demands respect  from his enemies and friends always satisfies the ladies. Check it out!!!!",923616000,,725,4.933884297520661
1082125,5,6305811725,I'm a big fan of the shaft movies and being able to find this movie on amazon was like a dream come true.  I looked all over and I could not find this movie in any store.  This movie is just as good as the previous two films and even the reboot with Sam Jackson.  So happy I was able to finally complete my Shaft movie collection!!!!,1377993600,,333,3.9402985074626864
1082126,1,6305811725,"I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN. THEY ARE TOTAL LIARS. AND THEY SENT ME A GARBAGE DVD. WOW I HATE THIS COMPANY A LOT, SO PEOPLE BE AWARE, OKAY. AMAZON YOUR NEED TO DROP THEM FOREVER IN LIFE.",1307232000,,201,4.05
1082127,4,6305811725,"There's a great scene in the movie.  A representative of a group trying to break up a slavery ring in Africa tries to recruit Shaft by saying his family was brought to America to pick cotton.  Suavely dragging on a cigarette Shaft retorts that his family was in tobacco.  This is a good fish out of water vehicle for Shaft.  Richard Roundtree further cements the title character as a classic screen figure not unlike Bogart.  The story is a good one and keeps your attention throughout.  The flaw to the film is the slick direction by John Guillermin(""The Towering Inferno"", ""King Kong"") that is a sharp contrast to the panache Gordon Parks brought to the previous two Shaft entries.  Nonetheless, ""Shaft in Africa"" is a piece with it's predecessors.",1273968000,2,750,4.767441860465116
1082128,3,6305811725,"The tagline(s) for the third installment in the Shaft trilogy says it all. ""The brother man in the motherland"", & ""Shaft is stickin it all the way"". Shaft is recruited to stop a slavery racket..(Africa to France). Shaft,(Richard Roundtree) is in top form as a hard lovin, hard fightin, detective/spy in this flick. Shaft abandons his ""iron"" and uses a stick in some well choreographed fighting scenes. Plenty of violence is served up as the man overseeing the slavery racket, Vincent Amafi (Frank Finlay) is aware of Shaft's identity, thanks to a double agent, Wassa (Debebe Eshetu). Shaft also has his hands full with two beautiful women, as he romances the lovely Vonetta McGee and is seduced by the alluring Neda Arneric. (Vonetta McGee) Aleme - is the daughter of the Emir Ramila (Cy Grant) who hires Shaft to infiltrate the international slave trading racket. Shaft will pose as local native, who will make the trek from Africa to Paris to bring down the racket working from the inside. Aleme gives Shaft a tutorial in the tribal customs and the language spoken preparing him for his trip to Africa. She initially resists Shaft's charms, but of course he ultimately wins her over. Plenty of nudity is served up in the last of the Shaft trilogy, including Shaft himself in a nude stick fighting sequence.

Aboard the slave smuggling ship, that will travel across the Mediterranean sea, Shaft encounters the gorgeous Neda Arneric. (Arneric is a young Yugoslavian actress who makes her American film debut as Amafi's mistress..Jazar). In an earlier scene, Jazar volunteers to travel to Africa and distract Shaft so that Wassa can take out our hero. Upon boarding the ship, Shaft gives her the eye as she is looking super sexy in her blue bikini. Jazar reciprocates the attraction and immediately provides instructions to Wassa on how he must get Shaft to the top deck that evening. Wassa wants to take out Shaft right away, but Jazar blackmails him, thus ensuring she gets to experience ""the sex machine to all the chicks"". That evening, Jazar lures Shaft to her cabin, and they share an incredibly steamy interracial love scene. Arneric is a slavic beauty, but merely serves as eye candy, as her only purpose in the film is to sleep with Shaft. Although Shaft's cover is blown from the beginning of the film, he makes his way to Paris, avoiding several attempts on his life. Once in Paris, he brings down the the slavery racket, as he frees the itinerant workers from bondage. Shaft offers plenty of one liners much like british agent...007. One line is totally hilarious when Shaft posing as an African, is asked if he knows how to ride a camel to cross the desert. His retort, ""no ride camel, ride ass"". The musical score and more specifically, Johnny Pate's guitar work, spices up some scenes. The Four Tops provide the theme song, ""Are You Man Enough"". This film definitely has a Bond edge to it, as Shaft gets a couple of gadgets for his mission. A definite step away from the first two Shaft films and this one completed the Shaft trilogy.",1241740800,5,3048,4.7727272727272725

1082132,5,6305811725,"Shaft does it again!  He brings his street sense to Africa and woos an African princess in the process...and right under the watchful eye of her bodyguard!  Too smooth!  I was actually craving for more after this one...who knows, he might have done the same in Europe had more had been produced!  Richard Roundtree was truly one of the hottest names in the business at that time as John Shaft.  Get the other two as well to complete the collection (""Shaft"" and ""Shaft's Big Score"").",1057536000,,482,4.623529411764705
1082133,4,6305811725,"Shaft is discussing an impending female circumcision with the African princess and suggests ""We put a little wear and tear on that thing before they cut it off"".  SMOOOOVE",1041120000,,171,4.896551724137931
1082134,4,6305811725,"Though the second sequel to ""Shaft,"" there's no remaining trace of the first two ""blaxploitation"" films.  ""Shaft in Africa"" looks more like a big-budget 007 film, and instead of Roger Moore, put Richard Roundtree in the hero's role.
The pair of director John Guillermin and writer Stirling Silliphant will definetely reminds you of ""Towering Inferno,"" pinnacle of the ""disaster movies"" in vogue in the 70s, and ""Shaft in Africa"" has the same feeling -- it is packed with actions and violence, plus costly set (or shots on location).  This time Shaft, in order to stop the modern-day slave trading in Africa, has to endure a chains of brutal attacks from enemies and the scorching heat of Afraica.  The globe-trotting story leads him from NYC to Ethiopia, and then to France.  And Shaft doesn't forget that he is THE sexy guy; Shaft's love is played by beautiful princess Vonetta McGee, and he even spends a good time with a white girl in bed.
If you expect ""blaxploitation"" films in ""Shaft in Africa"" you may be diappointed.  It is no longer that.  The total tone is nearer to films of James Bond (to which Shaft refers briefly) and actions never stop coming on screen between Shaft's one-liners.  As far as the actions are concerned, it never lets you down, and you will see unique things here and there that you can find only in the 70s: in one scene Shaft, completely naked, proves that he can do stick-fighting (!).
Overall, ""Shaft in Africa"" is a good action film.  Often its violence is excessive, but the film's pace is always slick and Roundtree plays convincingly the cool and sexy hero.  There is no more Isaac Hayes theme song, but Four Tops's great song will make you forget that.  And don't miss the airport scene in which Shaft has to take a photo with a lion.  This lion (of course, he is a real one) is audacious enough to give him a quick, threatening look to him.  Shaft (or Roundtree) doesn't look happy about that.",1011744000,9,1934,4.639296187683285
