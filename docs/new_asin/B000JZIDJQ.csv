8153776,5,B000JZIDJQ,"This opinion expressed in the title (I love it!) is that of my son (7 1/2 year old), who just finished the first two lessons from this DVD.  In fact, he just typed that title himself.  He has been going to a local art school for a year and a half, once every week.  He enjoys that art school, but he has yet to learn the sketching technique taught in this DVD.  He seems to thoroughly enjoy learning it, ahead of times, through this DVD!  I think the step by step instruction and ""pause and draw"" feature are great.",1237680000,,515,4.161616161616162
8153777,5,B000JZIDJQ,"This is a clear and easy way to draw horses, the teacher is a good instructor and demonistrates to all levels and abitilies. I think anyone who loves horse's will enjoy drawing them.",1194480000,,182,4.545454545454546
8153778,4,B000JZIDJQ,"We purchased this DVD as a gift for my 12 year old stepdaughter.  She had it in the DVD player with her paper out and ready to go within two hours.  The drawings that she did looked great, and we could tell that she was excited to learn new techniques for horse drawing.  The artist (Cordi, I guess) went through all of the basic steps and built on previously established skills.  I suspect that even once the DVD is no longer in constant use, our little artist will still be taking pride in the techniques that she learned and put to use.",1169078400,,539,4.254901960784314
