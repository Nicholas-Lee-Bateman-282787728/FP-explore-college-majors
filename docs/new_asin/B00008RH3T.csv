1859387,4,B00008RH3T,"...Wordlessly submissive in body and deed? What rights have women?"" --Medea

People seem disappointed with the transfer to DVD, but it didn't bother me too much. It's an old video, so I wouldn't expect it to be perfect. All things technical need not be perfect at all times.

This story was one of my favorites in college, so I was naturally interested in the film versions.  I prefer this adaptation to the one with Maria Callas. The atmosphere is more suitable in von Trier's work, with the mist, wind, barren land, gray seas. It also reflects Medea's mood, I think. Such bleak imagery for her depressed state.

However, I found it interesting that birds were chirping on the sunny day that Medea hung her children (I think she stabbed them in the book). I also found it somewhat unrealistic when the older son told her that he knew what was going to happen, and when he put the noose around his own neck.

Not much dialogue, but that's okay, because it didn't need much (if you know the story).

Great lines by Medea, as one would expect:  ""I'd rather bleed behind a shield than bearing a man's children.""  With this review's title quotation, it is clear that Medea feels her oppression as a female in a patriarchal society. She would rather be a soldier than a mother - more active, aggressive. Alas, she ""was but his prey."" She left her country and family for Jason, helped him find the fleece, but he ends up betraying her.

Medea is obviously a feminist of her time, noting how society discriminates against her, knowing that pride is good fortune for Jason, but bad fortune for her. That's still true in today's society. Aggressive, arrogant women are looked down upon much more than are aggressive, arrogant men. It's the ""bitch"" character flaw vs. the ""normal (strong!)"" male personality. And her powers and intelligence (again, also happens today) are underestimated until the end.

There is a beautiful scene involving a horse that was cut by the poisoned crown. It appears to go crazy, breaking free from its ties and frantically running out to the beach towards the sea, until it finally collapses, seizing until it is still. That horse did some good acting, or maybe they really stabbed it or something.

Something that bothered me about Medea's appearance - that hideous skull cap. I wanted to see her hair, I've always pictured Medea with wild long hair. She let it out one time, at the end of the movie. Perhaps the cap represented her bondage to Jason, and taking it off signaled her release? That's probably a stretch, but it's what came to mind when I saw it.

I've never felt sorry for Jason. He brought it on himself. Did he deserve to have his children, new wife and father in law murdered?  Perhaps not, but it is Medea's last hurrah and her right as a scorned woman. Men tried to diminish her power, but she outsmarted them all by pretending that she had been wrong, apologizing to Jason, acting proper, submissive, meek (non-threatening).

The sad thing is, Jason seems like the kind of man who would do that all over again if given the chance. He is too self-centered to see what how his actions will affect those who have grown to trust and love him.  Moral of the story: obey the ""Do not commit adultery"" commandment, or someone might break the ""Do not murder"" commandment.

""There is no greater sorrow than love."" --Medea",1154217600,18,3352,4.65593220338983
1859388,1,B00008RH3T,"Stay away from Facets. I thought the transfer was poor on the Facets edition of Heimat, but this makes the US Facets Heimat look hi-def by comparison. This dvd is pixelated, grainy & just barely this side of unwatchable. This transfer makes many of the dollar store dvd's look good by comparison. I can't believe Facets has the gall to charge $30 for this. This review & the 1 star rating is for this dvd, Not for the film. The transfer is so bad that I can't judge or enjoy the film.

Edit 1/13/12: I posted the following in the comments section also, but since Facets is only partially to blame for the horrific video quality, I am also adding it to the original review.

I just got a copy of the PAL edition. For whatever reason (see the comments for one person's opinion as to why), this film was shot in HORRIBLE quality. To me it's bad beyond art, but for each his own.

As bad as the PAL edition is, the Facets is worse. The Facets has pixelization in the dark segments that is 100% missing in the PAL, & also has less detail than the PAL. I'm not totally certain if the lack of detail is due to an attempt to smooth out some of the grain by Facets, or if the 2 dvd's are a couple analog generations apart (i.e. the PAL being a direct film transfer & the Facets being perhaps a copy of a copy).

But to be perfectly honest, both versions do have almost unwatchable picture quality.

My interest in this is due to being a huge fan of Carl TH Dreyer. While he may have enjoyed the acting (I haven't watched the extras on the PAL disc yet; one of which is supposed to discuss how closely Von Trier did or did not follow Dreyer's script), but I strongly believe Dreyer would be as disgusted with the production values of this film as I am.

One final comment: The PAL edition has 2 ""bonus features"". One of the 2 features compares 2 scenes; as written by Dreyer & as filmed by Von Trier with no editorial comment. I obviously have no way of knowing how representative the 2 scenes in question are due to the lack of editorial comment; but the 2 scenes as filmed bare absolutely NO resemblance to what Dreyer wrote.

What I am suggesting is that there is a strong possibility that this film has next to nothing to do with Dreyer other than Von Trier using his name & reputation.",1146009600,10,2280,4.263888888888889
1859389,3,B00008RH3T,"Being my favorite opera, I was very excited to see that a DVD was being produced from a recent performance.  So as not to bore anybody with my ramblings about the opera itself, I'll only concentrate this DVD's perfoming edition and performance.

The performing edition is based on Carlo Zangarini's Italian version and is similar to the version that Maria Callas made famous back in the 1950's.  Zangarini's version is based on Franz Lachner's 1855 version with recitatives replacing the original spoken dialogue.  Lachner's version is itself based on Cherubini's 1812 Vienna score with changes and reductions made to the original French Opera Comique score of 1797.  The original French Opera Comique version had longer ensembles and spoken dialogue between the musical numbers which, in the hands of good French speaking actors, can come across as more dramatic and fluid then what we have here.  But, even in CD recordings, no one has risen to the challenge of giving these spoken parts their true dramatic dimensions (I'm thinking that Minkowski and the singing actors he usually works with could do wonders with the original score).

This performing edition looses some of the musical structures Cherubini had created for the original 1797 French version.  The most notable losses are in the fiery duet for Jason and Medea in the first act, the ensemble for Medea, Creon, Neris and chorus in the second act and the finale at the end of the opera.  It's a shame the original 1797 French version hasn't yet replaced this Italian version as the most performed.

About the performers, everybody seems to have some talent, if not totally engaged in their performances. The Medea of Denia Mazzola Gavazzeni isn't one of the better performances I've heard, but she holds her own against the draining, emotionally charged version.  Although, at times, I fear she was on the verge of loosing any kind of control over her singing.  Jason, a role that would test the best singing actor to draw out anything more then a two dimensional character, is performed by Cesare Ruta in a typically flat, deer in the headlights, performance.  The Neris of Chiara Chialli looks like she is on the verge of falling asleep, but when she sings, you know that she is truly the pillar of strength for Medea.  As Creon, Carlo Cigni sings with an authoritative voice, but sometimes seems to get lost with the stage directions.  Elisbetta Scano as Glauce does not iritate like some singers can with the openning aria but seems little concerned about the drama of the piece.  The chorus sometimes sounds muffled, whether this is due to the recording, staging or confusion in the chorus itself, I cannot tell. Basically, all of the performers seem to be stretching their talents to their limits but with this music, and dramatic structure, most singers would be.

The DVD itself is what makes me the most disappointed about the whole package.  What was with the editing of this DVD?  It's obvious it was filmed, then edited, from several different performances (a normal practice) but please while editing an opera try to match up the image with the soundtrack.  At times the video was several seconds behind what was being sung or just plain matched up wrong.  At one point the editor(s) didn't look closely enough to see that Medea is still singing, yet the music is finished.  This was very distracting at times.

The image of the video was good for the close ups, but a little blurry when showing the whole stage.  The picture format is in 4:3 (full screen).

The soundtrack was decent and clear (Dolby Digital 2.0), if not up to the standards being set by companies such as Opus Arte.

Kicco should be commended for putting this recording out, even with the reservations I stated above.  They may not have the resources to bring out a product with the same quality as the larger companies, but they are at least making an effort, with this release, to give us an opera that is rarely seen or heard.

All in all a good DVD of a great opera, even if it is not the best version of the piece.  If you, like me, love this opera, this DVD will be well worth having in your collection to view over and over again.  It may be a long wait until we see another performance of this opera on DVD.",1123891200,32,4262,4.7280108254397835

1859391,5,B00008RH3T,"This beautiful piece of art is one of Lars Von Trier's best works, and is certaintly the best of his pre-dogma period.  It is based on a previously unfilmed script by the master Carl Th. Dreyer (Lars claimed to be in constant telepathic communication with him during its filming), and tells the story of Medea's revenge on Jason (of the Argonauts) after he leaves her to become the heir of a throne.  The plot is sparse; the real star of this film is Von Trier's direction and great command of mood.  Many of the techniques employed in ""Zentropa"" and ""Element of Crime"" are used, as well as an extremely drab and degraded film image, and all serve to create a harsh other-world filled with despair.
About the DVD: sound is good, and while the image is made intentionally ugly by Von Trier, it is hard to say if the picture was made any worse in this transfer.

1859491,4,B00008RH3T,"I love this movie. Criticisms of this movie (minimal to being off-putting, slow moving, horrid picture quality) could be valid depending on the viewer. I found it completely absorbing and watchable. I find it amazing that the choice to film in this grainy, bleached and tinted way stylistically lent itself to feeling I was watching something ""REAL,"" as if film stock had actually existed in the time of Euripides and we are witnessing the excavation of a lost horror. So if you can visually get around the deteriorated look of the film I found everything pretty compelling, from the acting, the unadorned sets (Which really feel like 437 BC) and the naturalism of the film itself. Not to mention that the Medea myth/play is a classic worthy of retelling and this movie seems to get to the heart of Medea's blood-curdling motivations. Also, I've seen most of Lars Von Triers films - his scripts are not very sympathetic to humanity and women especially. But this film seems wholly non judgemental of the character - a rarity for his movies. There's a lot to like here and movie doesn't look or feel like anything I've seen except for maybe some Herzog films.

1859494,2,B00008RH3T,"The story of Medea and Jason is very old, dating from the bronze age.  It is most memorably told in 431 by Greek playwright Euripides, who made several changes in the earlier stories to create a work that has unexpectedly feminist overtones.  Cast off by her husband and without rights or law or society on her side, Medea is driven to kill her two sons in order to exact revenge on her faithfuless husband.  In the process, the playright asks us to consider how her misdeeds may be triggered by inequity--something that many ancients who saw the play found even more horrifying than Medea's crimes.

Carl Theodor Dreyer (1889-1968) is considered one of the greatest and most influential directors in 20th Century cinema.  He is best known for the 1928 THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC and the 1932 VAMPYR--both silent films, although the later was filmed in the sound era.  His work is notable for its dreamlike quality.  At some point in his career, Dreyer contemplated a film of Medea and went so far as to write a treatment and screenplay.  In 1988 Lars von Trier, working from Dreyer's script and filming in Dreyer's style, brought it to the screen as a television film.

Let the film critics and historians say what they like, but I have always found Dreyer's films visually beautiful but so interminable that I'd really rather watch paint dry.  Lars von Trier captures both qualities perfectly.  The film is visually arresting, but both dialogue and story have been scrapped to emphasize the way the thing looks, and the result is beautiful and incredibly slow--and the slowness reads as intentionally annoying.  The film is just over an hour and fifteen minutes, but even so it feels as long as THE ENGLISH PATIENT.  Others think the film is quite fine, and I say let us leave it to them.

1859495,5,B00008RH3T,"I have been wanting this version of 'Medea' by Lars Von Trier' for ten years.  It encapsulates the primal responses of women who have children in good faith, trust and respect.  Only to be dumped when their partner finds a younger woman.  Medea has no rights to her two sons.  She is homeless.  Without means of supporting herself.  She is beside herself with grief and rage at the injustice of it all.  The myth of Medea is taken from classical Greek theatre.  The seed of truth being the emotions women experience when they realise they have no human rights if they are not protected or owned by a man, no rights to the children they have given birth to, and not valued as a citizen with citizen rights.  And what Medea decides to do as a result of the injustice is beyond human understanding.  Or is it?  It is not until a human being is in Medea's position that the primal emotional part of the brain rears its ugly head and Medea choses her form of justice.  A valuable DVD for a historical/social understanding of why women chose infanticide and what emotions are triggered when their whole existence and reason for existence is being snatched from them.  Many levels of discussion can be sparked  from the emotional angst of Medea from gender, human rights, citizenship and non citizenship, sense of belonging, child abuse in all its guises to name a few.",1356998400,3,1362,4.597510373443983
1859496,4,B00008RH3T,"Many big-time spoilers included here.

It's very clear that Lars von Trier has a penchant for digging his nails into the festering wounds of the human psyche, which is almost invariably grist for the psychopathological mill. An asset of this film is that, in disarming the legend of Medea of its fantastic/mythical qualities, and thus ""reducing"" it to a story about a rejected woman who seeks revenge for the slight committed against her, it resonate a lot more with everyday experience, allowing it to shape itself according to our notion of reality. This can be terrifying, especially with the subject matter at hand. Some authors have argues that there is an infanticidal urge in all mothers, whether conscious or not (usually the latter). Those who act on it are usually portrayed as demonic and/or insane. This is a massive denial of the murderous tendencies present in all living creatures, a denial which seems necessary since it allows people to have some semblance of control over their minds and actions. But, given the right circumstances, the illusion is shattered, and a new balance needs to be reached. In the case of Medea, her narcissistic wound is too great to bear, yet the perpetrator cannot be attacked directly (for whatever reason). Her sexuality is rejected, thus she proceeds to destroy any evidence of his. She murders his bride-to-be as well as some of her family members. The epitome of her acts is the killing of her 2 children, which happens in a very matter-of-fact manner. The ""intruder complex"" can be felt in the mind of the eldest son, who gladly assists in killing the younger brother, pulling him down as he hangs helplessly from the tree. He thus fulfills his own unconscious wish of destroying his uterine rival. Her ""psychogenic sterility"" is accomplished, and she can depart. Again, the more realistic tones to the film are a huge asset.. she sits on a ship, waiting for the tide to carry them away... had the golden chariot of Helios, pulled by winged dragons, flown her away holding her dead sons with her, perhaps the impact wouldn't have stuck... score one for the director.",1296259200,5,2118,4.883333333333334
1859497,3,B00008RH3T,"Adaptations of classical Greek mythology are common in opera, particularly Baroque and opera seria, and it's perhaps for this reason that opera traditionally deals with highly dramatic subjects revolving around the twin passions of love and revenge.  With perhaps the exception of Carmen, they don't come much more impassioned than Luigi Cherubini's version of the Euripides drama Medea.

More than the actual drama - it's not a particularly complicated storyline and not a great deal happens - much of the passion is embodied within the character of Medea herself, the sorceress arriving at Colchis to stop the marriage of Jason to Glauce.  Turning up on their wedding day, Medea threatens all manner of vengeance should Jason break the vows he has made, under enchantment, to her.  Made famous by Maria Callas, which probably accounts for it being the only real Cherubini opera in repertoire, Medea is a role that calls out for a big performance and it does indeed get that here in the figure of Denia Mazzola Gavazzeni.

Recorded in Sassari in 2004 in the revised Italian version of the opera, this is a reasonably good production, traditionally staged, costumed and performed - a solid production that suits the opera and plays to its strengths.  The orchestration and singing are both fine, but unfortunately neither are really shown to their best in the rather poor sound reproduction on this DVD release from Kikko Classic in Italy.  A live recording, presumably made for television, the sound is Dolby Digital 2.0, but I'm not even sure it's in stereo, or if it is, there's not much L-R separation.  It might as well be mono, and the mixing accordingly isn't great, the orchestra mostly drowning out the singing.

The video quality is also lacking.  In 4:3, it looks like a TV video master, and is certainly not shot in HD.  Grain and blockiness can be seen in the dark backgrounds, there is faint discolouration with exposure varying between cameras.  There are even one or two buzz glitches that momentarily affect both image and sound.  The biggest problem with the filming is the editing, which makes use of different performances from different nights often within the same scene, the frequent intercutting leading to obvious continuity issues.  Even more problematically, this causes the lip-movements to rarely match the singing or the performance.

Most of these issues are relatively minor and wouldn't individually spoil the enjoyment of what is a fine opera and a good performance of it, but cumulatively, they can be quite niggling and distracting.",1283731200,2,2568,5.052132701421801

7986547,5,B00008RH3T,"This is an adaptation of Euripides play. It starts with Jason and his new wife, but on a very political tone: Creon is yielding power to Jason and to make it more powerful and official in this Greece moving towards hereditary kingship he gives him his daughter Glauce. But Creon requires  and orders  the banishment of Medea and her two sons. We all know what comes after that. Medea begging Creon for one days suspension of his decision. Then the hypocritical change of mind with Jason that she seduces again but he reacts violently, after yielding to the desire, and yet accepts to convince Glauce to ask her father to keep the two children. He goes with them to give her a present: Medeas bridal crown. Glauce will die poisoned and Creon too. Then Medea will have to kill the two sons and go away. Told like that this fable is as simple as a cold draft in a heating deprived house in winter when it is snowing outside.

Lars von Trier in 1988 only had the very low definition of the television of these days in Denmark to make his film but he already had his brilliant both lethal and murderous imagination rooted in the war and the German defeat which is also the allies victory. But Lars von Trier could never decide which was good and which was bad and he only saw the bad side of things.

In this film he modifies some elements to adapt them to this low definition television. The killing of the children is not spectacular with blood. He wants to have them there dead hanging in front of our shocked eyes in a long lasting full screen frame. So he has them hanged to the two branches of a totally dead tree. You can imagine the silhouette of these cadavers, these hanging bodies against the sky. Thats more spectacular than some blood on a nightshirt. But thats too static, dead in a way. He wants life in his vision of death.

So Lars von Trier has to add something a lot more odious, repulsive. The younger boy runs away. The older boy gets him and brings him back and pulls on his leg to help him die faster on the rope that his mother had tied to the tree branch. On the following morning he asks his mother to help him. He ties the rope to the second tree branch, he puts the noose around his neck and she only has to let him go and pull slightly. The final embrace of the mother letting the child die hanged by that mutual desire shared in this final act is more than frightening. It is blood curdling and yet who is at fault, who is wrong somewhere? And during that time Jason is getting crazy.

Medea goes to a ship, waits for the tide. The sail is rolled down and she unties her hair and she goes away. No god, no divine intervention, no Deus ex Machina, just a plain ship going away from Greece probably to some distant country. Maybe Colchis after all.

But where is Euripides in all that? In the final caption on the screen: A human life is a journey into the darkness where only a God can find the way for what no man dares believe God can bring about. Finally a reference to God but this final caption means nothing and yet so much. Thats in fact the vision of Lars von Trier about humanity. He cannot bring man out of this darkness of the cataclysmic war and the ruined Europe and the viciously hypocritical people from both sides who have to save what they can in order to get some kind of revenge, not to speak of vengeance. Lars von Trier has a totally morbid and death-bound understanding of life, though understanding is not the proper word. It should be ignorance, and yet he knows too much, so what? Errant banishment from any over-lording understating understanding! That might be it. He sure wants us to somewhere believe we understand Medea in her suffering, but in fact he probably just wants us to wonder where can she find any haven, refuge, sanctuary with a condescending and understanding God. And if it were a Goddess? Hecate for example? But thats beyond Lars von Trier. A Godless world is his final affiliation and conviction  and the sentence will be unsuspended.

7986549,5,B00008RH3T,"During his ""Europa Trilogy"", Lars von Trier adapted a script the late director Carl Theodor Dreyer, one of Lars's major movie influences, wrote but never filmed. Euripides's ""Medea"". The story of the witch betrayed by her lover Jason. Witch who in revenge commits a terrible crime that will psychologically destroy her former lover.

Tragic and dramatic, Lars's adaptation allows him to profess an homage to his idol, but also dives where Dreyer himself would not have gone to; like nudity, sensuality, eroticism, and a more troubling revenge than what Dreyer had planned.
Here and there, this movie, in a timeless environment closer to the world of Vikings than the Greeks, offers gorgeous Jutland's landscapes, memorable quotes, and strong camera effects. Like in the prologue, which forewarned what Lars would do with Charlotte Gainsbourg in ""Antichrist"", ""Medea""'s dialogue with her maid while her children are asleep, and the final encounter with her husband by the beach. I also have to say that the movie's distorted colors is wonderful as it reinforces the timeless effect of the story. As if we were viewing an an archaeological document. Ruins of an artifact a great writer wrote, that survived time, and which is left to us in shambles. In ruined condition that strengthen the story's relic power.

Of the main actors, Udo Kier and Kirsten Olesen offer wonderful performances and the presence of Dreyer's former collaborators, Baard Owe (""Gertrud"") and Preben Lerdorff-Rye (""Day of Wrath"" and ""Ordet""), pays tribute to the late director. The dynamics and energy between the actors working together are great and Olsen allows her text to stay in the viewer's mind after the story ends. Also the script's length is great. Not too long, not too short, we have enough time to understand the story and what occurred before. Seventy-five minutes, which I think has to do with this movie being a work for television rather than a movie theater. But then again, I think if Lars could have shot a five hour work like he did with Nymphomaniac, then he would have done it.

Now I know that Lars was ambivalent about ""Medea"", even said to an interviewer that he didn't like his movie to which the reporter and fan apologized for saying that he had liked the movie. But personally, I don't think Lars did a bad movie there. Unlike ""Element of Crime"", Lars allowed the characters to connect themselves with us. Their words and their emotions hit us, don't leave us indifferent, succeeding where his first movie had failed for me. In connecting us to the story. But I also think his criticism regarding ""Medea"" has more to do with him being uncomfortable with doing adaptations. Indeed this movie is the sole script adaptation Lars ever did. And as Lars did original scripts afterwards, I think Medea made him realize that he was more comfortable with doing a project whose bases came from him rather than someone else's; which can happen for some directors.

Anyway, I still think ""Medea"" is a wonderful gem that forewarned what Lars would do in his upcoming films. Stories with strong female characters, fable like universes, strong emotions, and Udo Kier's presence in several of Lars's movies. Especially as a bad guy.

Will we ever have a remastered HD release one day with special features? Let's hope so because I think more people should see this movie.",1416787200,,3357,4.934513274336283
