7793399,5,0925279269,"David Barton is an amazing American historian who put together a wonderful documentary on the foundations of our government.  There is no doubt that the United States government is far and away the most uniquely wonderful form of government ever formed.  There is good reason for the amazing prosperity and freedoms that Americans enjoy and this video spells out the reason quite clearly... God.  The U.S. government was, no doubt, framed based on a Biblical, Christian foundation by largely (but not entirely) Christian men.  This video outlines how the Founding Father's faith guided them in the building of the U.S. government and how unbelievers have struggled to discount and dismantle that foundation.

I highly recommend this video for anyone who is interested in American History, religious freedoms, or who have children.  This is the kind of truth that has been purposefully omitted from our public school history books.",1283990400,4,930,5.25
7793400,5,0925279269,"I has seen this program on cable (not this video). I watched this series, not because it is done by a Christian organization, but because I am interested in our country and our freedoms. This is a series that contains a lot of religious references so balance that with what you intend for your audience.  Even though Mr Barton refers to the Bible for some of his supporting arguments, I think what he argues for is sound for ALL Americans. I prefer to refer to his view as Judeo-Christian philosophy instead of Judeo-Christian religion because what he says is an excllent guide to being a just citizen in a republic such as the USA, which is something for all Americans, not just Christians or Jews. He may not have intended it that way, but this is how I approached it and I found the video intriguing and I think it will help you glean more from it, no matter your religious affiliation. Key questions he asks: Can unjust & immoral people select good leaders? Does scandalous conduct in private affairs mean anything on the public activities of a person? How is the First Amendment being misconstrued to restrict religious freedom instead of ensuring it? I think these are absolutely relevant questions for every American to ask. I think if you watch the videos with my afore mentioned caveats in mind I think you will find this video intriguing as well.",1163721600,4,1356,4.65
7793401,1,0925279269,"This video is an attempt to spread a particular religious and political ideology, Christian Americanism--the idea that America was founded as and should remain a distinctively Christian nation.  Its arguments consist of various quotations from the Founding Fathers, mostly taken out of context, and arguments and claims that don't hold up to logic, scrutiny, or further research.  The video ignores any evidence contrary to its viewpoint. (Jefferson Bible, anyone?  How about the writings of James Madison?)  David Barton is neither a historian nor an educator; he is a political activist who runs a company dedicated to opposing the separation of church and state.  There is no shortage of good, readable scholarship on the very important topic of religion and the founding of America--read the books and skip this video.",1150848000,2,822,5.341085271317829
7793402,5,0925279269,"If you're looking for the real history on the foundation of American government, this documentary is an excellent tool.  Anyone who says this video is ""slanted toward religion,"" as one reviewer has done, simply must not like the cold, hard facts that the video presents.  This program presents important information about America's founding that most public school textbooks leave out.  Every key claim in the presentation is documented.  This is an excellent teaching tool.",1106524800,10,474,5.364864864864865
7793403,1,0925279269,"I bought this to show in my Civics class.  It is very misleading.  Instead of being about the more historical aspects of the Constitution and foundations of govt, it is about the seperation of church and state with a very slanted view toward religion.  It is something I would never show to a class in a public school for fear of parental anger and being fired for potential lawsuit.  I was very disappointed.  I have a BA and MA in government and political science and an MA in teaching.  I was expecting something more and there was no description of the video or review.  It was a waste of my money.",1076803200,19,602,4.36936936936937
