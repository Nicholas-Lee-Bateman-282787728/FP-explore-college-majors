328311,5,6301442768,"Beautifully written and wonderfully acted version of the novel & stage play.  It is has a haughty, yet impudent script which is relevant, still, today as a passionate albeit sad expression of contemporary Leftist Liberal political philosophy. Maggie Smith portrays an eccentric and deeply passionate Scottish Girls School teacher who presses her students to follow their hearts and youthful idealism never taking into mind the practicalities & truisms of conservatism. She plays with the hearts of men like a kitten with a cotton mouse always believing she is still 'in my prime' never realising that it is slipping away from her with each new generation of girls she encounters.
The conservatives of the school would like nothing more than to have her out but she has tenure.  She is eventually removed when a student of hers takes to quickly to her advice and follows her brother which gets her killed in the Spanish Civil War. Miss Brodie is 'betrayed' by one of her own confidantes - a man-bating student whom she refers to her as her 'spy'. It is an extremely good watch - replete with humour, passion, drama and pathos.  Highly recommended.",1485129600,,1146,4.927461139896373

328317,5,6301442768,"One of the films I remember seeing at the Fox in San Jose as an impressionable youth. The other most memorable being 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'.
 I haven't actually watched it yet, but was initially taken aback by the price of over 60 dollars for the DVD! The last time I saw it was a couple years back on TCM. I remember mama, (another great movie of an earlier era), trying to cover my eyes when Pamela Franklin's nubile form graced the screen. Back off, old lady! I remember Pamela  from 'The Legend of Hell House' 4 years later while on vacation in Buena Park, but there will never be a summer like 1969 and my sister inviting my friend Jim's sister Missy along for the afternoon. I forget why Jim couldn't go. Oh, well.
  I especially love how Miss Brody's progressive ideas were shown to be horrendously destructive, and Sandy upbraiding her accordingly.
I'll never know if I long for the old days because I was young, or if they were better, but I am forever grateful for growing up when I did. I love the 60's!",1468886400,,1028,4.394736842105263

328386,5,6301442768,"I have given this film the highest rating because it tackles an interesting and unexamined phenomenon with depth and nuance without losing the point. Miss Brody is gifted as a teacher, yet so caught up in herself that she becomes a danger to others, particularly her students.

For all of the elevated aesthetics she sprays over her students, she has completely lost track of the line between professional propriety and impropriety. Ultimately, and heartbreakingly, it costs the life of the student most in need of clear-headed guidance and support.

Miss Brody is a caricature of a great many teachers I had in high school and particularly in college. Self-absorbed, passionate, their motto might just as well have been, ""Often in Error, Never in Doubt."" Fortunately, I chose a mentor who was the opposite and grew immensely by having a positive contrast to Humanities professors who were only too eager and self-approving to waste class time on their pet positions and objections to everything beyond their tower walls.

A lot can be sold to young minds under the banner of idealism and, for a great many, once the habit of idealism become an all-encompassing world view years can be wasted seeing the world as windmills. In my view, Sandy is the heroine of this film for standing up, and putting an end, to Miss Brody. How did she do it? By simply taking the initiative to tell the truth to the right people. Was all the good done in the lives of her students worth the life of the one girl Miss Brody's half-baked idealism ended? As a former student, as a former parent, and as a former teacher, I say ""no.""

If they still bother teaching professional ethics to student teachers, ""The Prime of Miss Brody"" should be part of the curricula with ample discussion to debrief afterwards.",1452902400,2,1786,4.788961038961039

328389,4,6301442768,"I first saw this when it came out and boyishly enjoyed the interplay between all the potential lovers.  On this viewing, I was fascinated to see that there was also a political undertone to the entire thing as well as teacher-pupil relationships that entered very dangerous territory.  What is so remarkable about the performances in this film is how differently the viewer can perceive all of the characters, who are acted with a theatrical acuity that while outdated is still very fun to behold.

Brody is from all appearances one of those remarkable teachers that one is lucky to find, particularly if you are invited into her inner circle.  She provides an intimate view into a world for the claiming, inspiring her best students to a lifelong search for knowledge.  Yet on another level, she lives in a romanticized fantasy that she projects into the minds of her acolytes, sometimes even in a controlling way, such as her positioning of a favorite to become the lover of her passionate suitor.  To say the least, this is ethically questionable, and it leads to results that no one would have dared to anticipate.  Finally, her political views are a controversial reflection of her time, but again, we do not know if she has fully thought through her sympathy for fascism or if it is merely a sentimental yearning for some kind of deeper commitment.

Then, there is the chemistry of her inner group.  One of them is a remarkably intelligent and perceptive young lady, perhaps a future journalist (or a spy, as Brodie somewhat ridiculously marks her out for), who grows beyond Brodie's tutelage a bit too quickly.  Does she act out of principle?  Jealousy?  Both?  There is also the shy one, who is too easily influenced.  Though brief, these are vivid personalities that fascinate.

Finally, there are the establishment types, whom Brodie could care less about alienating.  She seems to gladly become the enemy of the new principal, who is either a fuddyduddy or is aware that Brodie is transgressing somehow.  Unattractive and stiff, she is doing a job, but there is also personal animosity because Brodie is loved by many and certainly a great beauty entering middle age.

The film does feel dated, mannered in ways that modern audiences may not like.  Many older films appear this way now, and even my taste has since moved on.  But it is a pleasure, if only for comparison's sake.

Recommended.  This is a period piece of great moral complexity.",1441411200,,2454,4.83453237410072

328392,1,6301442768,"This film is strange. It takes place in Edinburgh, Scotland in the 1930s, and is based on the novel. The movie is about a teacher of young girls in an all-girls' school. She discusses many things not in the textbooks, even controversial and racy subjects, and is the subject of gossip among the adults in charge because of her love life and her outlook on the many subjects she discusses. I found the dialogue and the storyline boring, and have no sympathy for any of the characters. The ending is predictable and I'm glad Jean Brodie got what was coming to her. This is almost the female version of ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"", another film I did not enjoy. If you don't like films with mostly all females/males, stay away from this and ""Chips"".",1436140800,2,739,4.56390977443609

328435,4,6301442768,"Maggie Smith has always been one of the world's greatest actresses  long before her current role in ""Downton Abbey"" and one only has to view her Oscar winning performance as the eccentric Scottish schoolteacher in Twilight's new Blu-ray of ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie""(1969) to confirm that. This is the film that made her a star and even after 45 years she is simply astounding in the part. Twilight Time has now brought this film to Blu-ray for the first time and it's a vast improvement over Fox's ""Studio Classics"" standard DVD and should delight fans of the film(Bitrate: 30.00). The cinematography by the great Ted Moore is given new life on Blu-ray although much of the filming inside the Marcia Blaine School for Girls still appears somewhat drab. In the included commentary by director Ronald Neame, this is exactly how he wanted the film to look with only Miss Brodie's costumes given bright colors. Those costumes that Smith wears in the film are certainly brighter and even the smallest details are visible. Outdoor scenes of the Scottish countryside are equally lush with greens and yellows looking especially sharp. There are no vertical lines, torn frames, dirt, etc. and overall this is a very pleasing Blu-ray presentation. The Audio(English 1.0 DTS-HD MA) has also been improved and free of any noise artifacts(hiss, pops, etc.) although viewers may have to listen intently to some of the spoken dialogue due to the accents. Although Maggie Smith dominates the film with her tremendous performance the rest of the actors rise to the occasion and are excellent in their supporting parts. Robert Stephens, Celia Johnson, Gordon Jackson and the teenage Pamela Franklin are equally terrific in their roles. ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" is 116 minutes(Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1) and only contains the following subtitle: English SDH. Special features include an isolated music score by Rod McKuen and commentaries by director Ronald Neame and actress Pamela Franklin. An informative booklet by film historian Julie Kirgo is also included. It doesn't get any better than Maggie Smith when it comes to great performances and ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" is one of her best. Twilight's new Blu-ray of the film is an excellent presentation and comes highly recommended.",1430006400,3,2282,5.085333333333334

This tale of a teacher in an Edinburgh girl's school in the 1930s was expanded into an excellent mini-series in 1977 staring Geraldine McEwan (who recently died).  This film also stars Robert Stevens and Gordon Jackson (Upstairs Downstairs' butler, Hudson.)  This classic is certainly worth a place in one's library.",1423094400,2,487,5.285714285714286

328501,3,6301442768,"Maggie Smith is insufferable through most of the film--exactly what the role calls for.  She constantly professes her dedication to her students, and they are under her spell.  The school's curriculum requires her to teach them history, but she covertly aims to give them an appreciation of art and, especially, beauty, truth, courage, and love.  What's really striking about this film is the connection it tacitly makes between these ideals and Mussolini's fascism.  Miss Broadie never tires of telling her girls with a great man Mussolini is. She has the same admiration of Franco.  We don't usually think of Fascism as an attempt to restore classical ideals, though that was how they often thought of themselves.  Nietzsche is not mentioned here, but his ideas are pervasive, particularly the notion that the strong do not live by morals.  Miss Brody is a practitioner of this non-morality: she keeps two lovers at bay.  Each is madly devoted to her, but marriage would, the viewer surmises, spoil the romance for her.  As one lover tells her, what she really wants is to be lead her girls.  He is implicitly comparing her to Mussolini (il Duce).  Indeed, Miss Broadie demands strict loyalty from her girls and sets them at odds with the schools administration.  Her ""leadership"" provokes one impressionable girl to travel to Spain to help Franco, and Miss Brodie plots to have another take her own place with a discarded lover only to provoke a third girl (Pamela Franklin) into an unsatisfactory sexual relationship with this lover.  In short, Miss Brodie's leadership wreaks havoc with her students' lives.  Ultimately, her closest student and biggest admirer betrays her to the school's governors. In a climactic confrontation Brodie accuses this student of assassination.  However, in a final voice-over we hear Brodie's own words that she ""puts old heads on young bodies.""  The implication is clear: it is because of those very ideals that she learned from Brodie that the student betrayed her.  It would seem that these ideals and the fascism that comes with them are incoherent and unsustainable--yet remain so attractive that they cannot be relinquished.",1407628800,4,2166,5.107954545454546

328642,5,6301442768,"By far my favourite roll of Maggie Smith, she plays Jean Brodie, a teacher at a private all girl's School in Edinburgh Scotland in the 1930's. Having lost the love of her life, Hugh, at Flanders in WWI, she is torn between her love for the art teacher and the music teacher, both of whom represent her lost love Hugh. She dedicates her life to 'my girls', guiding them through her class & continuing to guide them through life, as she sees it and as how she'd like to live it. Jean Brodie is a woman who just doesn't 'get it' & is rapidly coming to the end of her prime. A fine study of lost love, dedication and coming of age, it's in my opinion the finest movie Maggie Smith ever made. Wonderful supporting roles acted by Gordon Jackson, Pamela Franklin & Jane Carr as Mary MacGregor, this is a must see film, and Oliver's beautiful theme song ""Jean"" only makes a great film better.",1379635200,2,884,4.331325301204819

328950,5,6301442768,"""The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie"" (1968) is the best stage play ever to be presented in movie form..a great movie.

The charge that most modern day movies (and possibly all movies throughout history) are air-headed, no-content exercises in providing viewers with a clever light show along with interesting sound of different flavors is true enough.

The best stage plays over history made us think, appealed to our mentality and education, and needed good actors to get the play writer's point off the stage and into the audience.

Good set decoration and other visuals are nice to have, but not absolutely needed. The Globe Theater in Shakespeare's day had almost no ""set decoration"" of the type seen in modern times. The ""groundlings"" (many of whom were well educated and worthy audience members, the noble sort who used to buy ""stand up in the back of the theater"" 50 cent tickets for Broadway Theater NYC shows 60 years ago) sat on the dirt floor in front of the open air play presented in daylight hours outside before the age of electricity and artificial light, when plays could not be presented lit by candles, the only night-time illumination before Thomas Edison (and others) changed things at the end of the 19th century.

""The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie"" (1968) is a very high quality play written in play form by Jay Presson Allen, based on a book by Muriel Sparks, and was a big stage hit both on Broadway in NYC, and in London in England before it came to the screen in 1968.

""A Man For All Seasons"" (1966) was another play made into a movie which came to movie houses at roughly the same time. Both movies starred gifted stage actors in lead roles, both movies resulted in Best Actor Academy Awards for the main stars.

""Plays which became movies, and were left mostly untouched"" account for some of the very best movies in all movie history.

""The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie"" (1968), which got Maggie Smith a well deserved Best Actress Academy Award, is perhaps the very best play ever filmed with the very best results in terms of technical and artistic movie making.

It is a treasure.

The subject of ""movies based on plays"" needs much more study and publicizing than it ever gets.

The big money from movies never depended on delivering the quality available in movies like ""The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie""(1968).

The movie ""business"" always was (still is, mostly) all about mass taste and appeal to the mostly unwashed, uneducated hordes willing to spend money in return for a light and sound show which they (the hordes) find agreeable, stimulating, and distracting....a brief escape from their hard, unattractive lives, or at least the hard, unattractive parts of their lives.

The percentage of truly ""high quality"" movies like ""The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie"" (1968) with great writing, great actor and technical movie work, great music, great direction, all blended wonderfully....the percentage of such movies made over history and still available to be got in the marketplace is tiny.....less than 5% of all movies available, and probably less than that....less than 1%.

It is important to know about the ""best of the best"" in movies, just as it is regarding stage plays (e.g. important to know that the plays of Shakespeare are ""the best of the best,"" and have never been equaled, or probably ever will be).

""The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie"" (1968) is a breathtaking movie based on a great stage play about a brilliant early middle aged female schoolteacher in a private school for girls in Scotland in 1932 who is fired from her job in disgrace, thanks to the head administrator of the school ""Miss Brodie"" (Maggie Smith) works for, and thanks to help provided Miss Brodie's main enemy, the ""Headmistress,"" by one of Miss Brodie's most ""loyal"" students and protgs, ""Sandy"" played by Pamela Franklin (perfectly cast as the ugly duckling intellectual favorite student always described as ""reliable,"" yet never sexually interesting or attractive, even though Franklin appears in almost full frontal nudity poses during a scene with her studio art teacher, ""Teddy Lloyd,"" played wonderfully by Robert Stephens, who is not really aroused by naked ""Sandy"" and is rebuked in the same scene for thinking only of ""Sandy's"" teacher, ""Jean Brodie,"" played by Maggie Smith....

It's a movie so good, it should be ranked with ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) in importance for any who care for great movies over history....one of a handful of movies to take away to an island where the best movies of all are gathered to keep exiles company.

A ""Special Features"" commentary by director Ronald Neame (1911 - 2010) and actress Pamela Franklin (1950 - ) was added to the 20th Century Fox ""Studio Classics"" DVD issue of this movie.

The commentary provided by Ronald Neame was produced roughly 40 years after the movie was made, and Mr. Neame was about 85 years old. It is, by far, the very best ""add on"" commentary to be provided for any video I have ever seen. Mr. Neame is intelligent, complete, and insightful as he guides viewers through the movie and his direction of it. I've never witnessed a better job of ""commentary"" than this one.

Pamela Franklin's contribution in assisting the commentary is also very well done, and notable. She stopped movie and TV actor work after 1981....and discusses what happened in a straightforward and poignant way during her commentary, compares her good treatment in the UK (England) to bad treatment she got in the USA toward the end of her 56 credit list of movie and TV actor jobs.

328952,4,6301442768,"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie(1969) is a solid coming-of-age comedy-drama. It's based on the novel by Muriel Spark and the play written by Jay Presson Allen. The film stars Maggie Smith, Pamela Franklin, Gordon Jackson, Celia Johnson, and Robert Stephens. Ronald Neame(The Poseidon Adventure, Meteor) directs. Rod McKuen composed the film's underrated ""dippy, mellow, tender"" music score. A Prime of Miss Jean Brodie TV show aired on Scottish TV in 1978. The film takes place in Edinburgh during the 1930's. Maggie Smith is quite good as Miss Jean Brodie, a teacher who seems nice, but is good at manipulating her students. Pamela Franklin plays Sandy, a student who rebels against Miss Brodie and is willing to criticize her beliefs and values. The play and the 1969 film take some liberties from Spark's novel. The Miss Brodie TV show takes place in an alternate timeline! A young Jane Carr is adorable as the stuttering Mary McGregor.
 The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie was a big hit at the time. Many people have forgotten about it. Some people have never heard of it. This film earned its PG rating. There's a brief nude scene and adult subject matter. Rod McKuen's music for this film was used as stock music in the kung fu film Drunken Master(1978) during tender/comedic scenes. It was also used in the Drunken Master sequels! The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie portrays its characters as flawed and human instead of good and bad. This is a solid movie.

I had forgotten that Jean Brodie was played by Maggie Smith, the same fine actress who more recently has played Minerva McGonagall in the Harry Potter series. Can't seem to leave the teacher rolls alone. I like McGonagall much better than Miss Brodie.

For one thing, Miss Brodie is a fascist. She visited Italy the summer before this story opens in 1932, and she decided that Mussolini was a great man. She comments to ""her gels"" that he has eliminated litter in the streets. She teaches them to admire him for bringing Italy together.

She also teaches them, both in the classroom and by example, about sensuous love. Due to her influence, one ends up having an affair with the art master of the school, a married Catholic who will never leave his wife. She quite specifically teaches them to be snobs, and she is playing two men (the art master and the music master) one against the other. Frankly, she is a bitch.

Maggie Smith does her best but is struggling to bring any sense of worth to the character, and the main students don't ""jell"" as realistic characters. Too much from the book is lost for it to be a reasonable replacement. Having said this, the book itself is a shallow attempt at portraying a weird character, so perhaps the film makers can be forgiven for trying to improve it. The school was certainly right in getting rid of Ms Brodie, a menace to all who came into contact with her.",1321833600,2,638,4.556521739130435
329009,5,6301442768,"Although she wrote steadily from about 1957 to 2004, Muriel Spark (1918-2006) is very specifically remembered for one novel: the 1961 THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE, which been consistently cited as one of the best English language novels of the 20th Century.  With various changes in structure, the novel was converted to a fairly popular stage play in 1968; with still more changes in structure it became a motion picture in 1969.  Maggie Smith was already a well-regarded actress when she starred in the title role, but the film would bring her much wide recognition and an Academy Award as Best Actress.  It also provided Pamela Franklin, who had grown up before the camera in such films as THE INNOCENTS and THE NANNY, with her finest screen role as well as including notable performances from an emsemble cast that included Robert Stephens, Gordon Jackson, Celia Johnson, Diane Grayson, Jane Carr, and Shirley Steedman.

Set in 1930s Edinburgh, the film concerns Miss Jean Brodie (Smith), a flamboyant woman whose personality is more than a little out of place at the Marcia Blane School for Girls, a conservative institution.  Although she is a teacher, she is actually more interested in self-dramatization.  She is torn between two love affairs: one with the school's art instructor Teddy Lloyd (Stephens), who is Roman Catholic, has six children, and will not divorce his wife; and one with the school's music teacher, Gordon Lowther (Jackson), who is single, respectable, and hale and hearty.  But she ultimately rejects both--saying that her true devotion is to her students, most particularly to four who are her special girls: Sandy, Jenny, Mary, and Monica (Franklin, Grayson, Carr, and Steedman.  Although the girls move to the senior school and out of Miss Brodie's classroom, they continue to see her, and she continues to exert a powerful influence on them, particularly in political matters.  Miss Brodie, it transpires, has been to both Italy, where she much admired Mussolini, and to Spain, where she much admired Franco.  But she fails to see these men as fascist dictators, and her admiration will have tragic results for both herself and her special girls.

Maggie Smith gives a truly brilliant performance here.  We are constantly aware of Jean Brodie as an affected, often silly woman who is convinced of an insightfulness she actually lacks; at the same time, we cannot help but like her in spite of all her destructive and self-destructive qualities.  Smith has gone on to a long and memorable career, and deservedly so, but to my mind the real revelation of the film is Pamela Franklin, who was about nineteen at the time the film was made and who, along with her classmates, ages from about fourteen to eighteen over the course of the film.  Franklin had appeared in several notable films during her childhood, most famously the 1961 THE INNOCENTS; she is fully in command of herself as an actress and the equal of Maggie Smith in their scenes.  Unfortunately, in the 1970s Franklin became somewhat typecast as a horror film ingenue, and with her work drifting more and more into television guest spots, she made the decision to retire in the 1980s.

Retirement or not, the producers of this DVD managed to coax Franklin back into the business at least long enough to give an audio commentary on the film, and it is nice to note that she sounds as lively and clever as she did when she made the film some forty years earlier.  The audio commentary is, however, dominated by director Ronald Neame, whose true masterwork this is.  The film moves smoothly, gracefully, and the characters unfold with a power that at times reaches grandeur and edges over pathos towards tragedy.  We believe in Miss Brodie and her love affairs and her misguided sincerity; we believe in her lovers and her love affairs; we believe in her students as little girls (although at least one, according to Neame, was a twenty-year old mother of two) as they progress from giggling fourteen year olds to young adults.  The one awkwardness, to my mind, is the soundtrack by Rod McKuen, which is distinctly of the 1960s and which seems designed to give McKuen--perhaps better known as a poet--the opportunity to sing the ballad-ish ""Jean"" over the closing credits.  McKuen aside, strongly, strongly recommended.

329012,5,6301442768,"This is a really powerful story of what happens when adults, teachers or any others in authority, cross the line and impose their own damaging influences upon children.

Like most people I began this movie seduced by the charismatic Jean Brodie, but as the movie progresses, you see how she is destroying all the lives around her by her ridiculous, convoluted perceptions, seducing them into falling in with her deranged schemes and plans. One teacher who wants only a convential wife and marriage is led into playing a scandalous hidden affair. Brodie throw her students  as substitutes for her into the arms of a another teacher, frustrated by a one night stand with Brodie. Not to mention her preaching of questionable politics, values and ethics.

The children of her special set are not encouraged to follow their own gifts, but assigned roles by Brodie, and constantly encouraged to live up them. Even more chilling when the first class moves on after three years with her to the middle or senior school, she picks students with the same physical characteristics from the new class and assigns them the same roles and begins to indoctrinate them the same way.

Brodie herself constantly plays up her romantic and political ideals. Those students, particularly the most vulnerable, try to act out the roles she assigns to them. One follows a truly physically dangerous path in a war torn country, one who is frustrated by her ""dependable"" label, strives to emulate brodie by having an affair with the teacher that brodie is trying to encourage another, more beautiful girl to assume.

Brodie's influence on all of these children (and some of the adults) is, as one of the girls says, dangerous and unwholesome. Trained in love and war by Brodie, encouraged to be a spy, one girl finally acts to remove the dangerous influence from the school, and is labeled an assassin by Brodie, as well as a conqueror. Sandy then replies that this is what Brodie has always admired, and trained her girls up to emulate and be.  The end scene is of Sandy leaving the school, her face set in terrible realization of how, even though she has put a stop to Brodie from doing the same to others in the future (at least at this school) this girl has been shaped, changed and damaged by this woman in ways she will never fully recover from.

For any parent, the idea of such a disturbed person having charge of your child for three years (apparently in this school the teacher retains the same class from age 9 through 12 at least) preaching her odd mixture of deception, political nonsense and lust to these kids makes one have some sympathy for the headmistress, who is portrayed as a very narrow minded, unsympathetic character from the start to the end of the movie. To me, the only sympathetic and sane character in the movie is the girl, Sandy. She starts out rather unlikable, and is never terribly likable even at the end.  But you end up understanding why she had to do what she did, even though she has been damaged, not just by Brodie's influences, but by the betrayal she had to stage to put a stop to her.

A really good, if disturbing film.",1301097600,8,3138,4.680580762250454

Jean Brodie's name, but for a few letters is that of my Scottish grandmother. I was more interested in the setting than the movie. I was surprised at what I saw.

Maggie Smith does a great job in portraying the character. The character doesn't disturb me as much as understanding of its place in the time of the film's production.

There were very few leading roles of women in this period. The only good one that comes to mind is Vanessa Redgrave as Georgy in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Georgy-Girl/dp/B0009I8QHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Georgy Girl</a>.

There were many supporting roles for women as secretaries, mothers and helpers and prey for the James Bond's and Afie's of the film world.

Here we have a highly unique 1960's feature film - It has female lead!  A strong woman! A feminist!

Jean Brodie fits, supports and fully re-enforces the widespread verdict on 1969's feminists: she's a frustrated, Fascist loving, egotistical, elitist spinster. And what of the female students whom she inspires to break out of the confined life of females in 1932?  One falls prey to a Lothario art instructor, and another dies as she tries to be a heroine in Spain.

I would critique the acting or praise the great costumes and sets, but I cannot get beyond the content.  I would feel very differently were there some balance by other films with strong female leads in this period.",1297814400,2,1809,5.505415162454874

Never have I witnessed a portrayal of a woman who has no need to breathe, pause,or reflect as she responds to every situation brought to her reality as a teacher.  Her highly educated character matched with highly defined ideals serve her with joy as she lives each day so exuberantly.  Should a viewer be surprised that those who surround her despise her? Had she been the office secretary she would have the same opposition. Miss Jean Brodie lives in each moment to the fullest. My most important comment about this film is the incredible screenwriter. He/she captured a life that is so foreign to the masses, a fully developed mind, soul,and heart with beautiful voice. I apply genius to the screenwriter, and do not believe any will exceed this level of writing.",1282089600,3,868,4.690789473684211
329017,5,6301442768,"Maggie's Smith's Jean Brodie accomplishes the near impossible, creating sympathy for an arrogant, self absorbed, dangerous woman.  This schoolteacher blithely steers the lives of her favorite students, ""the Brodie Girls"" into treacherous waters to vicariously fulfill her own frustrated needs and desires.  Her unrealized ambitions are projected onto her girls:  Jenny to be a great lover/artist's model, Monica a famous actress or playwright, Mary a revolutionary freedom fighter, and finally Sandy, a spy or Secret Service Agent to report back to Miss Brodie on the others activities.  Whether they are suited for these particular vocations is no matter to her, as she doesn't see their actual characters and personalities, and will try to make them fit the mould she has created in her image.

That being said, Ms. Smith lets us view the pathos, as Miss Brodie views life through the distorted prism of her romantic illusions she truly has not a clue as to the irreparable damage she unwittingly inflicts on two of her original ""Brodie Girls"".  At the film's climax when confronted with the evidence of this, she is astonished, wounded, and unbelieving of the truth.  This is a tragedy because she does possess the ability to be a first class educator and mentor to her students at the Marcia Blaine School for Girls.  The other female teachers are by and large well meaning, but rather staid, provincial and dull.  Jean Brodie with her strawberry blonde bob, clad in brightly hued dramatic frocks resembles an iridescent hummingbird that has somehow flitted in among the drab sparrows and wrens that comprise most of the female teaching staff.  This coupled with Miss Brodie's independent spirit and rather superior attitude provokes jealousy and resentment down through the ranks of the staff.  The headmistress Miss Mackay perceives Ms. Brodie as a threat, and as such is on a crusade to rid Marcia Blaine of her presence.  Jean is well aware of this but continues on her self-destructive path, mistakenly believing her reputation and tenure as a teacher, and more importantly the loyalty of her girls will protect her.

For us to accept such a flawed character the actress playing Jean Brodie must radiate charisma.  Maggie Smith goes beyond this, she mesmerizes us, and we are as spellbound as her students by her classroom soliloquies, held in thrall by this enchantress.  Miss Brodie opens a new colorful world to her favorites.  Scotch history comes vividly to life as she takes them on a walking tour of the older districts of Edinburgh, where the actual events she describes took place.  There are forays to the art museum, where Ms. Brodie tells them of the life of Gauguin, they attend performances of classic theatre, opera and ballet, enlightening a cultural life that is virtually ignored at the conservative Marcia Blaine.  Diverse artists such as Giotto, Michelangelo, Sybil Thorndike, Anna Pavlova and Dante Gabriel Rossetti are discussed and admired.  In al fresco school picnics and Sunday luncheons, the ""Brodie Girls"" are introduced to such exotic dishes as pate de foie gras, sweetbreads a la Milanese, and charlotte russe.  Initially Jean Brodie appears to be an Auntie Mame of schoolteachers, eccentric, flamboyant but well meaning and loveable, making her clique aware of the infinite possibilities of life until hints of a darker, more malign influence begin to emerge.

There is a lengthy tour de force sequence by Maggie Smith that illuminates the bravura quality of her performance, and shows just why she won the Best Actress Oscar.  It begins in Miss Mackay's office, who makes a ludicrous attempt to force Jean to resign; Miss Brodie's fiery warrior reduces Miss Mackay to a stunned silence, and Miss Brodie leaves the field victorious.  However immediately thereafter she has two stormy encounters with her present and former lovers, Mr. Lowther and Mr. Lloyd.  The cumulative effect of all three interviews leaves Miss Brodie shaken and very vulnerable emotionally, and perhaps for the first time she experiences a fleeting moment of self-awareness that her life is empty at the core. Determined to rise above it however, she briskly gives a slide show presentation of her recent vacation in Italy to her class. Still she cannot maintain this false bravado for long, and slips into a meandering reverie to the bewilderment of her students before finally dissolving into tears.  Of such magical moments are Academy Award winning performances made!

By rights, Pamela Franklin as Sandy and Celia Johnson as Miss Mackay should have both joined Ms. Smith in the winner's circle, in a tie for Best Supporting Actress, but incredibly they weren't even nominated!  Ms. Franklin's achievement is the more remarkable, since she was all of 18 years old, and convincingly plays a schoolgirl from ages 12 to 18 years of age.  Sandy is the brightest of the Brodie girls, made wise beyond her years, but taken for granted by Miss Brodie, who will ultimately be surpassed by her.  In the final charged, verbal duel between them, Ms. Franklin stands toe to toe with Ms. Smith, no mean feat.  Celia Johnson's Miss Mackay is something of an enigma; in her case still waters certainly do run deep.  The viewer is not quite sure what's she's thinking and what is motivating her vendetta against Miss Brodie, why the intense dislike, is it jealousy, fear, honest concern for the students welfare, all of these, something else we'll never learn?  Ms. Johnson's seamless, effortless acting keeps us guessing and interested as to who will ultimately prevail; she is a worthy opponent for Miss Brodie.

The only male roles in the film are those of Miss Brodie's lovers past and present, both teachers at Marcia Blaine.  Teddy Lloyd, dark, intense and sardonic is the married art master at the school, and also a painter in his spare time.  Although Jean loves him, and he is besotted with her, she will not rekindle the romance, and instead uses Mr. Lowther, the music teacher as a proxy in her bed.  Robert Stephens, Maggie Smith's real life husband at the time portrays Teddy, the chemistry between the two providing a real flame to their scenes together.  Gordon Jackson plays Gordon Lowther, the blond, ruddy, music teacher, bound by convention, and very much dominated by Jean.  Their furtive sex life causes him more guilt than pleasure, and he cannot understand why Jean won't marry him.  Lowther is wishy-washy, but Jackson does the best he can with an impossible part, finally giving him a set of balls when he belatedly stands up to Miss Brodie and tells her what he wants from their relationship.

A special mention to Diane Grayson, Shirley Steedman and particularly Jane Carr who play the rest of the Brodie Girls,respectively Jenny, Monica and the hapless Mary McGregor, and are fine indeed.  The script by Jay Van Presson Allen improves on Muriel Spark's original novel while retaining the wit, most of which is tartly delivered by Maggie Smith, as for example the title line of this review.  A final tip of the hat to Ronald Neame who as director who pulls all the elements together to create an excellent engrossing film.

Quick word about the extras on the DVD; commentaries by Ronald Neame and Pamela Franklin, some very good anecdotes about making the film, also some filler, still worth a listen, but you miss Maggie Smith's participation, plus  a still gallery of photographs from the production and the original trailers.

329080,4,6301442768,"The British seem to have an aptitude for making movies about the relationship between teachers and their students. Movies like ""Good-bye, Mr Chips"" and ""To Sir, With Love"" are studies in the fascinating dynamic that exists between students and teachers. One thing that is pointed out is that teachers are an enormous force over the young minds in their charge. Which brings us to the ""Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"". Maggie Smith turns in a stellar performance as the teacher with questionable influence over her students. Miss Brodie is a dominating and intoxicating influence over her students and the faculty at ""Marcia Blaine School for Girls"". Brodie is an egotist, driving into her students the heroic role women must play in civilization. Indeed, it is women, not men, who are the builders of the world. Women are all powerful, sexually speaking, but they must have matching and greater intellect to make their way to the positions they deserve. High, purposeful words. But also dangerous ones. Many times Brodie crosses over the line of what is an what isn't a good influence over her girls. And she can do it. She has the loyalty of her girls and public support; she is an unbreachable fortress. Brodie's dangerous influence is checked only by tragedy and a student's betrayal. The movie is a cautionary tale and a very well done one.

All the performances in this movie are excellent and memorable. For me, the performance of Pamela Franklin as ""Sandy"", Miss Brodie's most faithful and promising student, and, in the end, her ""assassin"". Franklin is filled with bewitching charm and intelligence, her presence is magnetic. Over the course of the movie, she evolves from school girl to a young woman, sultry and adorned in her long raven black hair. I first watched ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" on TV, when I was a teenager, and I was smitten by Franklin's character. I lamented that there were no girls like her at my high school, which was sad for us all. And being young, I was thrilled with the scene where Franklin's Sandy is modelling for a nude portrait. The object of teenaged desire and she naked as well --  this movie is awesome!! It's too bad that Franklin's later career lead her into B-grade Hammer Horror movies and US TV shows. Another rising star never reaching her full potential, save for this excellent movie.",1266192000,2,2337,4.810945273631841
329081,4,6301442768,I had read the book after it was featured on the First Tuesday Book Club on Australian TV (ABC) and had the urge to view the video again after more than 20 years. The video brought the story to life although there were a few differences from the book. You could really believe that it was shot in Scotland in 1932. Maggie Smith was very good except in a few places where she over - acted. Watching with the subtitles on allows one to catch the dialog better.,1265760000,,458,4.215909090909091
329082,4,6301442768,"Muriel Spark's most famous novel about a crackpot girls' school teacher in 19230s Edinburgh and her betrayal by one of her charges was flattened when it was made into a vehicle for Vanessa Redgrave in the West End and Zoe Caldwell on Broadway. It's flattened even further for the film adaptation so that much of the wider things the book was about--for example, Edinburgh's dual promise as the city of John Knox and his version of Calvinism on one hand, and also as the center of the Scottish Enlightenment on the other--almost completely disappear. This film instead works almost entirely as a vehicle for Maggie Smith to show her tremendous gifts in the great central role of Jean Brodie, but what a vehicle it is, and for what a role: this is one of those Academy Award performances that still makes people smile decades after having seen it at the memory of it. The spin Maggie Smith can give to the merest throwaway line (""There, you are inscribed!"") with her theatrical brogue is genuinely delightful, and almost everyone can remember his or her own Jean Brodie--the kind of intelligent teacher who winds up exaggerating her personal eccentricities so the students will remember her personality more than what she's actually taught them.  Smith's floridly melodramatic monologues in the classroom in front of her students are almost indescribably pleasurable, as are her showdowns with her unyielding nemesis Emily McKay, her headmistress at the Marcia Blaine School for Girls. As Miss McKay, Celia Johnson is every bit Smith's equal, which makes their battles all the more memorable. While the screenplay by Jay Presson Allen retains some of the best lines Miss Brodie gets in the original novel, it unhelpfully compresses the parts of the girls in the ""Brodie set"" so that you have trouble keeping most of them straight except for Sandy the betrayer (very well played by Pamela Franklin) and the wealthy stuttering Mary MacGregor (Jane Carr, the weakest link in the cast), who comes to a tragic end through Miss Brodie's inspiration. Smith's hairstyles and the theme song, later famously sung by Rod McKuen, seem unfortunately to be more of the late Sixties than of the early Thirties.",1264896000,2,2193,4.975476839237057

I have owned the video for years, but have finally now, just ordered the DVD edition which I am very excited about! Maggie Smith is a truly beautiful woman :-)

Another film worth checking out that is similar with a slightly different shift to it & would make a great companion piece is The Class of Miss MacMichael (1978), where Glenda Jackson turns in one of her usual outstanding performances.  Both these films would make a great double feature.  Another great recommendation is To Sir, With Love, Sidney Poitier (1967).

Don't miss this film, whatever you do, it'll be the best two hours you've spent in years!  The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie is a winner on all counts.

A cute story during the Special Features Commentary by director, Ronald Neame, indicated that Maggie Smith and her co-star-husband, Robert Stephens, became pregnant during the making of the movie because the B&B where they stayed had peacocks in the grounds that woke them up every morning between 4:00 and 5:00!",1252281600,,628,4.63963963963964
329087,5,6301442768,"The title of this review reflects the bemused observations of the film's title character, unforgettably played by Dame Maggie Smith while reading a note summoning her to an after-school conference with Marcia Blaine Academy's headmistress, Miss Mackay(Celia Johnson) to her beguiled young students. The subsequent 4:15 PM conference will be one of three such conferences that each mark turning points in this film.
  Smith's Brodie does not fit the image of the olive-skinned, dark-haired Scotswoman with the ""Romanesque"" nose described by Muriel Spark in her 1961 novel; crucial incidents in the book are distorted, and some major characters deleted. But Smith brings her own understanding of the character and more stereotypical Scottish looks of a milky complexion and auburn hair to the viewer's eye.
  We first meet her on a lovely day in 1932 Edinburgh, as she cycles to attend  the first day of school. She is soon surrounded by the boisterous students who adore her--the most prominent of these being the red-haired romantic looking Jenny (Diane Grayson), plain but histrionic Monica(Shirley Steedman), and the subtly sharp Sandy (Pamela Franklin) who doesn't miss a trick.
 The new school year introduces a new student to the distinguished ""Brodie Set"":The shy orphaned heiress, Mary McGregor(Jane Carr) who has a slight stammer, and who will find herself alternately being scolded by teachers and bullied by Sandy and the others. For her, Miss Brodie's taking her under her wing will be a fateful encounter, indeed...
  Miss Brodie's methods of teaching history are at odds with the conservative Marcia Blaine curriculum( Symbolically, her colorful wardrobe clashes sharply with the dull gray uniforms around her), and she constantly diverts from the daily lesson plan to regale students with stories about the love she lost during World War I( managing to conceal this fact when Miss Mackay makes an unexpected visit to her class and wonders why Monica is crying), discussing her favorite artist, Giotto, and showing slides of her jaunt into Fascist Italy.
  At the center of the story is the love triangle between Miss Brodie, the married art teacher Teddy Lloyd( Smith's then-real-life husband, the brash, earthy, and charismatic Robert Stephens)and the music teacher Gordon Lowther (Gordon Jackson), both of whom have talents that remind Miss Brodie of her beloved Hugh, the love she lost during the Battle of Flanders.
 During the weekends Miss Brodie and Mr. Lowther share at the latter's family estate at Cramond, they are often joined by Sandy, Monica, Jenny, and Mary. But Sandy soon guesses the two are having an affair and shares her knowledge of this fact with Jenny and Monica.
  We see the routine of the students, and travel with the characters through four years during which we see Miss Brodie's continued fight to keep her job, the tension between her and her two lovers, and her expression of pro-Fascist views and admiration for Franco and Mussolini that will have fatal consequences.
 There inevitably comes the time when one of her four young confidantes, with whom she shared campus ground picnics, trips to Mr. Lloyd's studio, trips to the opera, and trips to Cramond will grow up and lose faith in the middle-aged spinster struggling to relive her past. We see a certain distasteful perversion of  Miss Brodie's that will morally compromise a student as well.
  Supporting characters include Ann Way as the quiet subordinate secretary, Miss Gaunt, Molly Weir and Helena Gloag as the Misses Campbell, who teach sewing, Gordon Jackson's real-life wife, Rona Anderson as the Science teacher, Miss Lockhart, and sweet little Heather Seymour as the young student, Clara.
 Viewers will be treated to riveting performances, including the one that gave Maggie Smith her first Oscar. While we don't learn the fate of the girls from this film as we do in the book, to the sound of a haunting and very Scottish-sounding background theme song, we are given a slice of life in a unique time and place that never fails to stir the imagination.",1251158400,,4064,5.122541603630863

329128,4,6301442768,"This 1960's film is set in an upscale girls school in 1930's Edinburgh. It tells the simple story of an unmarried history teacher's approaching middle age--a fate she tries to deny by insisting that she is ""still in my prime.""

Jean Brodie is pretty, intelligent and obviously devoted--some think too devoted--to her students. She has a special, small group of ""her"" girls that she takes under her wing, filling their heads with highly romanticized notions about history, art & love. Her elitism has attracted the notice of other teachers & the Head Mistress (who wants to give Jean the old heave-ho.) The Head Mistress had tried in the past to have the rebel censored, but Jean rallied the Board of Governors to her side & by the force of her personality, pulled the fat out of the fire. Jean had emerged from that possible fiasco the victor, even if it did nothing to quell the animosity of the other school employees.

Jean is carrying on an affair of sorts with the painting instructor. It is not exactly clear if they had ""gone all the way"" or not. Maybe once or twice. This secret relationship is collapsing because the painting instructor is Irish Roman Catholic and he refuses to divorce his wife or leave a brood of kiddies. This may have been Jean's hidden motivation--maybe she enjoys engaging in doomed relationships, cerebral affairs with no real commitment.

She more openly dallies with the music instructor who is definitely available--and a Scot to boot. He's something of a clod, but he also comes from a good family & obviously adores Jean & wants to get married & start a family of his own.

There is a scene with Jean sitting under a tree, surround by her special girls. One student is reciting Tennyson's The Lady of Shallot. When she reaches the verse that mentions ""the curse,"" all the girls fall together giggling. Jean musingly continues: ""But in her web she still delights/to weave the mirror's magic sights/for often through the silent nights/a funeral with plumes & lights/and music, went to Camelot."" Jean has a very sad, almost haunted, look on her face when she concludes: ""Or when the moon was overhead/came two young lovers lately wed/I am half sick of shadows, said/The Lady of Shallot.""

To me this verse perfectly illustrates Jean's main inner contradiction: She desperately wants & needs love, but her romantic fantasies can never be translated into a real, adult relationship with a man. So she lives in the shadow land of her own self-defeating idealism. This would remain a personal issue and, although perhaps sad, it wouldn't be considered that big a deal. Unfortunately, Jean lives out her fantasies through her coterie of highly suggestible girls. Ultimately her influence culminates in tragedy.

In the end, Jean looses everyone & everything.

Initially, and for a very long time after, I tended to try to empathize with Miss Brodie and her unorthodox teaching methods becasue I genuinely believed that at the heart of it all, she deeply cared about her students.  But upon later viewings, while it is quite obvious she is reliving her youth vicariously through her girls, when taking a long honest look, I could no longer deny that Jean is entirely too dangerous.  Even the opening lines where she tells her new class ""Little girls, I am in the habit of putting old heads on young shoulders"" more than sufficiently suggests that there is something horribly amiss here.  Moreover, even today, Miss Brodie's methods would raise eyebrows.  Eventually, she suffers the ultimate price for her ""special girls.""

Maggie Smith is positively mesmerizing as Jean Brodie and an Oscar for this performance was well-deserved.

The hero is the principal (Celia Johnson) who does what she can do to put a stop to the destructive misbehavior of Miss Jean Brodie. Our villain is so morally and intellectually bankrupt that she even worships the Italian fascist Benito Mussolini. In Miss Brodie's warped elitist view of the universe, this misplaced adulation is evidence of her being in one's prime. She eventually gets one of her more naive and trusting ""Brodie Girls"" killed. And yet, the tragic death fails to deter her from causing further harm. The woman is truly a parent's worst nightmare. Maggie Smith excellently portrays this less than admirable individual. Her Academy Award for best actress is well deserved.

There is one more point that I feel compelled to add. Some people mistakenly believe that totalitarian dictators gain power by focussing on the conversion of the masses. Nothing could be further from the truth. The masses are of secondary importance. Mussolini, Castro, Stalin, and other ruthless thugs find it initially necessary to seduce middle class, pseudo-intellectuals like Miss Jean Brodie. These ""useful idiots"" lay the ground work for the horror that inevitably follows.

329179,5,6301442768,"Even though this film is 40 years old and showing it in some respects, Maggie Smith as Jean Brodie is still one of the most interesting acting performances I've ever seen. She makes you care very much for a character that's actually not all that pleasant - but you get to know Jean, and feel for her. Not to be missed!!",1160352000,4,319,4.245901639344262
329180,5,6301442768,"You only begin to understand what the writer and screenwriter of ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" is trying to say when you realize that the student who ultimately becomes the most like Miss Brodie (Maggie Smith) is Sandy (Pamela Franklin), and that the story is really being told from Sandy's point-of-view. She learns to be as judgmental and irresponsible as her teacher, full of misguided ideals and grievances, and totally confident that the world is as simplistic as she wants it to be. Which is why the film begins with a shot of Miss Brodie on her way to the school and goes out on a shot of Sandy leaving the school,  with a Brodie voice-over about her teaching philosophy.

Once you understand that the Sandy transformation is the principle dynamic, the rest of the story fits together rather smoothly. The on-going struggle between Miss Brodie and the headmistress is almost a Hitchcock McGuffin, providing a lot of character motivation but ultimately of little importance.

Another key is the use of Tennyson's ""The Lady of Shalott"". ""When the Moon was overhead, Came two young lovers lately wed; ""I am half sick of shadows,"" said The Lady of Shalott.""

In the poem she is a magical being who lives alone on an island upstream from King Arthur's Camelot. Her purpose is to look at the world outside her castle window in a mirror, and to weave what she sees into a tapestry. She is forbidden by the magic to look at the outside world directly. Looking at the world in a mirror and depicting it in a work of art is an allegory for the life of a teacher viewing the world from an ivory tower and interpreting it for her young students. And Miss Brodie's often fearless lifestyle is much like the heroic action taken by Tennyson's lady which leads to her doom.

Finally there is the irony of the betrayal by the one student who is the most like her, the only one in whom she really confides. But the film illustrates the disconnect between Miss Brodie and Sandy, who gets her back up that Miss Brodie considers Jenny the ideal. Brodie is too self-absorbed to pick up on Sandy's growing disenchantment just as she does not have the insight to realize that Mary McGregor's brother was fighting against (not for) Franco in Spain.

In many ways Miss Brodie is a wonderful teacher and most young girls would have benefited from membership in the Brodie set, mostly because of her encouragement to openly explore the possibilities life offers. She contrasts the word ""education"", derived from the Latin ""educere"" (to lead out)-seeing her role as leading out her students' own ideas by encouraging them to think for themselves with the conventional teaching style of ""intrusion""- the stuffing of heads with required information.

Which adds a lot of complexity to the production and makes it quite unique. One on level it is a rebel teacher fighting the repressive system to give her students a better education. While on another level it is clear that she is going a bit too far and messing up some of her charges.

The film covers a five-year period and the 18 year-old Franklin believably manages a transformation from a mousy 12 year-old to a sexually liberated young woman. Her nude scene in the artist's studio shocks the viewer because the passage of time has been handled quite casually and because it is really a reverse striptease, starting nude and slowly putting ""on"" her clothes.

The DVD has a commentary feature by Director Ronald Neame and Pamela Franklin. It too is quite unusual as they were not together in the studio and their voices alternate throughout the film without having any interaction. Neame tends to digress too often to other events in his career but the commentary still manages to provide some useful information.

Ultimately this is a depressing but interesting story with Miss Brodie's colorful outfits standing out in the grays and browns that dominate the production design.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1159401600,42,3958,4.771929824561403

She is a vision of rare beauty. It is too bad she retired from acting in the early '80s except for an occasional voice over part.

329184,5,6301442768,"Maggie Smith plays the dynamic (some might say emotionally dictatorial) spinster school teacher in a girls' private school in Edinburgh, circa 1932. Smith is a Romantic; spouting poetry and art, she instills in her charges the idea that beauty is above all things. She claims to have dedicated her life to teaching, which she says is a drawing out of what's already inside her pupils. But her love of the dictators Mussolini and Franco indicate she is enthralled, like Nietzsche, by power. (This eventually gets her fired.)

In her personal life she loves the art teacher (played by her then-husband Robert Stephens) and he her, but he is married with six kids and a Catholic (no divorce). He wants to continue the affair with her, but she wants more; out of frustration she has a fling with the dull music teacher (Gordon Jackson). She is also at constant odds with the head mistress of the school (Celia Johnson) who tries to get her to leave. It's a very entertaining movie; the only letdown is the confontation Smith has with one of her students (Pamela Franklin) who feels wronged by Smith for thinking she is smart rather than beautiful. Some are also annoyed by the ""Jean"" theme song, but it didn't bother me in the least.",1139184000,,1229,4.716279069767442
329185,5,6301442768,"Maggie Smith won an Academy Award for her portrayal of Jean Brodie, an unconventional and outspoken teacher in a stuffy Edinburgh girls' school, who encourages her students to be just like herself.  Miss Brodie proclaims she is ""in her prime,"" and expounds on the glories of a life full of passion and commitment.  Miss Brodie is, in reality, a spinster, still sadly attracted to her unscrupulous ex-lover and often living in the past.  She has a small group of students she is especially close to, but two of the girls take her instruction too literally, and this leads to tragedy.

Maggie Smith was so young and beautiful when she made this movie!  She dominates the screen with her charisma and power.  She tosses off many funny and memorable lines of dialogue with her delightful Scottish brogue, and delivers them with  righteous indignation and withering glances.  Pamela Franklin is excellent as one of Jean's disciples, and Rod McKuen's music is lovely.  This film is a must for fans of Maggie Smith.",1134172800,5,1008,4.882352941176471
329186,2,6301442768,"I finally caught up with this film, and, like so many high profile classics, I found it to be tedious. The script lumbered along and I found no enthusiasm for any of the characters. I must admit that the title character is complex and for that consideration, as well as the look of the period, I gave it 2 stars.",1109808000,7,312,4.216666666666667
329237,4,6301442768,"Towards the end of the movie, as her world started to fall apart, she was told that she was a frustrated spinster. In the movie, Jean Brodie is clearly a frustrated woman, seeking love but rejecting it. She pines for her lost love, Hugh, in WWI action but it is never revealed what there was between them. There are several great performances in this film, set in 1932 in Scotland at a private girls school.  Maggie Smith does a tremendous performance as a strong willed and independent minded teacher, determined to do her own way of teaching, regardless.  She won an Oscar for it, and it is clear why.  Pamela Franklin does a great job as a student who becomes her foil, and some of the ending dialogue is particularly strong as they clash over Jean Brodie's firing.  Jean Brodie lived in a world of unreality but couldn't see that.  Jean Brodie seemed to either steer her students to perform to their potential, or send them crashing.  She kept referring to herself as being in her prime.  Commentary by the director, who gives insight into the making of the film, and by Pamela Franklin, who was 19 when the film was released in 1959.  The weakness in the extras (and there are only a few extras) are the still shots in the gallery.  The shots seemed to be a real mish-mash, without context and some of people not really involved in the film.  This is a good DVD to have if you enjoy a strong performance from Maggie Smith and is certainly a classic movie.",1096416000,7,1460,4.475471698113208
329238,5,6301442768,"The dialogue was creaky and childish, and it took me a long time to get used to it, though Maggie Smith brought it to life and made it take.  The other actors were good enough, but less successful with it (except the hateful head mistress of the school, I hated her, she must be a good actress).  Also on the negative side was the abundance of Parthian shots, the pithy little gotcha exit line as the character walks out and shuts the door.  I can (sigh) still hear all those doors closing firmly.  But other than this I loved the movie.  Maggie Smith was wonderful, mixing humor with her madness.  And her humor was deliciously subtle.  I notice some of these reviewers (god bless them) gave away much of the plot, as usual.  Don't read them.  They'll just spoil a very good movie for you.  Finally I think the title song ""Jean"" is very beautiful and muted, and if it hadn't become such a hit on the radio, it would have been just pleasant (I thought it was in keeping with the story, time and place), not familiar.  I see I've really said nothing about the movie.  I advise you to rent it before buying it (I did both), I doubt it's to everyone's taste.",1096329600,7,1155,4.32093023255814
329239,4,6301442768,"Here's a film whose reputation seems to have declined over the years. Highly regarded and hugely successful when it first came out, it now seems a bit static with a plot that is a tad too predictable. The main attraction of the film was always the mesmerising and award-winning performance of Maggie Smith. But today some people might find her acting overly mannered or too theatrical. However, I am not one of them. I have always thought that Maggie Smith was one of the finest actresses ever. And a genuine eccentric.

The film consists of lots and lots of dialogue delivered in quaint Scottish accents. (The accents are not as much a problem for American audiences as they are in other films such as Gregory's Girl.) There is an occasional glimpse of old Edinburgh but, for the most part, the settings are confined to interiors. The film is directed and photographed professionally and unobtrusively. The 1930's period is nicely byt subtly evoked. The one discordant element is the rather twee musical score by Rod McKuen. The emphasis, as in a play, is on the characters.

The supporting cast are just that but most of them manage to have their moments. Robert Stephens (married to Maggie Smith at the time) is quite good as a slightly bohemian art teacher. Gordon Jackson steps somewhat out of his usual typecasting to portray a wimp of a music teacher. Celia Johnson is positively evil as the jealous and strait-laced headmistress. Best of all is Pamela Franklin as Miss Brodie's pet pupil - a nicely shaded and slightly underplayed performance that both contrasts and complements Maggie Smith's flamboyant turn.

And it is Maggie Smith that you will be mostly watching. Demonstrating all the emotions from dreamy idealist to dedicated teacher to fliratious lover to frustrated spinster to defiant victim. Every line of dialogue is delivered perfectly - every move of her body is exactly appropriate to her character. She dominates the film without overpowering it. In many ways, it is basically a stage performance but she manages to make it work in the context of a film. In the end, you may not entirely love her character, but you will certainly understand her. And that is what great acting is all about.

I have seen The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie many times and have often found myself wishing that Maggie Smith's brilliant performance had been in a better film. But it's hardly a bad one. Old-fashioned and somewhat stagebound perhaps. But you forget all that whenever Maggie Smith is on the screen.",1094083200,106,2512,4.86214953271028

The whole cast is great, and the movie oozed Hollywood grandeur even though it came out of London.  This is what DEAD POETS SOCIETY and MONA LISA SMILES should have been!

The DVD is a classy affair with a pretty good transfer of a movie this old.  Grain and dirt appear, but it looks and sounds better than it ever has.

Gordon Jackson who later achieved world fame as Hudson in

329245,4,6301442768,"Maggie Smith is the elegantly pert Miss Brodie, a 1930s Edinburgh school marm of immense panache, charm and wit in a film that's sort of a cross between a female version of ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"" and ""To Sir With Love."" Smith's performance easily commands ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" beyond cliche and its theatrical trappings as she becomes the ultimate self-deluding spinster to whom Mussolini is a treasure on par with the Mona Lisa, and passionate love is but a taboo. Dame Brodie marks her existance on over-inflated romantic notions about art and beauty. Adapting from the novel by Muriel Spark, director Robert Neame keeps the pacing sweet and nimble, touching on all the right points without dwelling on any of them. Also in the cast are real-life husband, Robert Stephens as Jean's married lover and Celia Johnson who is marvelously insideous as the hostile headmistress. The film score by Rod McKuen may have been Oscar nominated but it betrays its 60s origins and really pigeon-holes the film as a production of that decade instead of seeming a vital tableau of the 30s.
THE TRANSFER: Fox has done a marvelous job remastering ""Miss Brodie"" on DVD. Colors are lush and nicely balanced. Black levels are deep and solid. Contrast and shadow levels are bang on. Some of the long shots suffer from pixelization which breaks up fine detail and there is also a very small trace of age related artifacts. These do not necessarily distract. The audio is stereo. Though dialogue does not sound natural it is nevertheless very clearly presented. The score - in all it's twinkle-twinkle get down of 60s flashback is amply displayed.
EXTRAS: An audio commentary and very sparce stills gallery. It really is a mystery to me why Fox's continues to benchmark certain catalogue titles as part of their Studio Series when their attention to suppliments continues to grow more scant by every release. Just call this a general release and be done with it. There's nothing special apart from the film to recommend such titles as part of a special series.

Maggie Smith beautifully portrays the egocentrical and deluded Jean Brodie, who insists throughout the film that she is ""in her prime,"" thereby excusing her from taking accountability for her actions. But you don't dislike Miss Brodie; in fact, the viewer simultaneously pities her and admires her. Maggie Smith brings a great deal of humanity to the role; we see both her grasp for control and her struggle with her weaknesses. Smith certainly deserved the 1969 Oscar for Best Actress.
Pamela Franklin is captivating in the role of self-righteous Sandy, the only girl in the Brodie set who appears to have any genuine intellect. Her gradual maturity throughout the film is quite credible, and I especially liked the scene near the beginning of the film where Sandy and Jenny discuss their views on sex. Both funny and sad. (However, I was a bit shocked by Sandy's nude scene. This film should have a PG-13 rating.)
The movie was filmed on location in the beautiful city of Edinburgh, and the outdoor scenes compliment Miss Brodie's lectures and opinions beautifully. A good, literary film that examines both the complexities about being a woman and what it means to be a teacher.

So enamored is she of art, literature, and beauty that she neglects to acknowledge the rising fascism in the real world. Miss Brodie, in her self-proclaimed prime, has her little pet pupils, girls she intends to inspire; she also involves them in the machinations of her meetings with an art teacher, her married lover (and real-life husband). For sheer snobbery, Miss Brodie's outlook cannot be topped. There's a denouement, a comeuppance, that is heartbreaking for more than one of the characters.

movies are usually ignored at Oscar time but this time they remembered Maggie Smith who won her first award.  Equally good

It becomes hard to accept her as a dangerous influence when the plot turns dramatic, but her scene where she states that she's ""PROUD""! copped her the AA. Celia Johnson has a genuine triumph as her adversary, Mrs. Mackay, and Robert Stephens does a lot with his role as her art instructor lover.

I watched this movie on a cold winter's evening with a fire in the fireplace, a glass of sherry, and my wife besides me, a pleasant winter's diversion.",1009238400,3,593,4.619047619047619
329349,5,6301442768,"As others have noted, ""Miss Brodie"" is a complex character. To say she's sexually repressed is just the start. In addition, her political idealism is snarled up with her sexual frustrations, so that, on one hand, she appears ""liberal"" in encouraging her girl pupils to explore the ""possibilities"" life offers (even if she herself continually retreats from them), but on the other harbors an admiration for arch-conservative (read ""fascist"") leaders like Mussolini. In reality, of course, her idealism leads her to identify with ""Kaiserian"" autocrats in her role as educator ---one of the funniest moments in the film, in fact, occurs when she's leading some of her understudies on a school outing, and ""Sandy"" (played by the beautiful Pamela Franklin) starts swinging her arms in a marching rhythm, deliberately emulating one of Brodie's ""fascisti."" Yet despite the identification, Miss Brodie is ultimately too timid to play the role of autocrat in any direct way, and so couches her ""fascist"" tendencies in rhetorical paeans to art and beauty. Meanwhile, the only real artist in Brodie's school also happens to be her disdained paramour (played by Robert Stephens) - another amusing moment occurs when he says to her: ""You went to bed with an artist, but were horrified when you woke up with a man.""
Maggie Smith may have won the Oscar as the title character, but Pamela Franklin happens to be one of my favorite actresses, so I'm biased in my admiration for her in this film. Incredibly cute as ""Sandy,"" she also pulls off a convincing transformation from a rather uncultivated little girl in the first half of the film to a sexually liberated young woman toward the end. Her nude scene in the artist's studio, in fact, is startling considering the film was  made in 1968 (see closing credits), and nudity in American commercial films at that time was rare. In fact, she looks so child-like that one can only suppose the studio setting was the only thing that precluded outright censorship. In any case, Ms. Franklin displays a capacity for complexity that rivals Maggie Smith herself, and it seems almost fitting that her character ends up with most of the ""freedom"" that Brodie can realize only vicariously. The pitched battle she wages with her teacher to attain independence of thought and selfhood is just one of the things that makes this a superior and rewarding film.",995241600,16,2378,4.974874371859296

I first saw it a couple of years ago and was haunted not only by the Oscar-winning performance of Maggie Smith, but by the (I thought)  incredible job done by Pamela Franklin as Sandy.  I was so taken by  Franklin that I've even tracked down and watched some of her early Disney  films like 'A Tiger Walks', which is also good.  As for the film itself,  the plot is rich and full, the characters well developed, and the climactic  scene gripping.  I would definitely recommend seeing this movie!

For  the next two hours I was transported to Edinburgh. And what a great  vacation it was!
Maggie Smith is positively brilliant as Miss Brodie. Her  ""guls"" as she pronounces it are breathtaking as well. The actress  who plays Mary looks very much like the girl on ""The Big Comfy  Couch""--I have a very wide range of entertainment interests!  :)

Two things that I'd forgotten or missed about the film previously:  It's  very atmospheric -- Edinburgh in the '30s and the boarding school seem so  oppressive and suffocating!  And the film is very psychologically complex  -- we witness Miss Brodie's gradual breakdown, and it is soon apparent that  she is not merely the quirky, eccentric individual she at first seems, but  is actually a very pitiable, disturbed, and dangerous person.

The acting in this film was amazing but there were parts of the story that I just did not enjoy. I  did not like that Sandy ended up with the art teacher. It moved the plot  along but I could have done without that. I loved the scene where Sandy  tells Ms. Brodi that it was she who told. The reverb of  ""Assassin"" off the walls was truly haunting.

Even though it was in the 1930's, it proves that no matter what age we live in, there can always be somebody that can contol  civilization without us knowing.  We would even welcome such ideas and  ideals such as what Miss Brodie taught to her ""little girls"".  When I saw this movie, I was amazed at how well each person fit their  charater.  I was captivated by Brodie's teachings, her persuasion, her  charm, even her looks.  Everyone was in that dull, lifeless uniform while  she shined like a rose.  I pitied Brodie when she was betrayed by her  favorite student, Sandy, the one she was particularly interested in.  It  seemed as if she couldn't figure her out.  I believe that this movie is a  great classic, orriginal, and even modern for our times.  This movie  deserves more than the five stars.",930441600,8,892,4.608974358974359

Wow... I'm in awe at how unsettlingly relevant this 1969 British drama starring Maggie Smith is still today.  Set in a girls' school in 1930s Edinburgh, Scotland, it's a fascinating study of losing yourself to a charismatic mentor/teacher in your formative years... only to awaken to the fact that she's a dangerous and immoral egomaniac. A megalomaniac!  One who's manipulating your brain and behavior --your entire destiny-- with her crazy personal dramas, delusions, and fascist politics.

It's based on the novel of the same name by Scottish author Muriel Spark.  There's also a play on it of the same name as well as a 1978 seven-part Scottish TV series.  Some movies that come to mind that are surely inspired by this story are Dead Poets Society, Mona Lisa Smile, and Cracks.  Of this list, I think only Cracks, with the seductively twisted Eva Green, dares to capture the darker side of Miss Jean Brodie (and then some!). All three have clear elements of the original in one way or another and are based on an influential, boundary-crossing teacher who hones in on a selected group of students and changes their lives forever.  The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie got piles of well-deserved awards.  It's an impressive mix of drama and scandalous content lightened up and made very watchable by Maggie Smith's wicked smart eccentricity and the comedy that inevitably ensues around dopey teens and the even dopier staff who either pine for or despise her.

FYI: There is nudity in it and a (m/f) teacher/student hook up (oh hell, even teacher/teacher hook ups! lol), so beware ye prudes, PC police, and other preachy fanatics... this one is not for you.  It's all kinds of line-crossing crazy!  Funny, my elderly neighbor remembered it as ""cute"" and ""funny"" when I asked him what he remembered about it back in the day... but I think modern, PC-obsessed and easily-enraged audiences of today will have a very different take on it.

All that taboo stuff aside, what an interesting look at when dangerous politics and unhinged adults control the classroom.  Miss Jean Brodie is a very strange monster on the loose-- a predator.  When you're young and trapped in a world where the best and most fun teachers are the most corrupt... and the bitchy staff and crabby Headmistress (along with her mute, Igor lookin' secretary) are the only good souls, lol... things can get mighty confusing.  And kind of hilarious.  This isn't entirely a drama, as I said... it's definitely got levity and outright comedy... real life is never just one thing and I appreciated the mix. Cuz watching your longtime idol/mentor fall as she takes out your innocence and damages a part of you forever is pure tragedy.  You really are hers for life.  So much moral complexity and fabulous drama here!!

I would recommend reading the book first (if you're a reader).  It's surprisingly quite short, about 150 pages and published in the early 1960s.  It's a good one but this movie is something else, lol-- loved it... oh, and the endings are definitely different.",1514073600,,3244,4.794964028776978

Her acting and mannerisms can't be imitated and like Bette Davis, she's in a category of her own.  After rewatching this movie after many years, I realized that ""Mona Lisa"" with Julia Roberts is very close in storyline to this one and wondered if Hollywood actually just modernized this one.  Amazingly similar in all aspects.  It's the story of a progressive teacher who tries to enlighten ""her girls"" with progressive thinking and so gets the hackles up for the staid all-girl's school.  Add one nasty girl who in the end gets Miss Brodie fired and you have Mona Lisa all over again.
