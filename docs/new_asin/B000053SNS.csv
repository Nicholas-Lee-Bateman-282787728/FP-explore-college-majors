Not seen on television over the last fifty plus years --- this 1938 serial was one of the many Universal cliff hangers based on comic strip characters --- later shown in the early 50s to the young television viewing audience --- but suddenly vanished. alongside ""Ace Drummond"" (1936), ""Tim Tyler's Luck"" (1937) , ""Radio Patrol"" (1937) , and others --- Except for the ""Flash Gordon"" trilogy (1936-40) and ""Buck Rogers"" (1939), also starring Buster Crabbe - these Saturday Matinee serials seemed to have dropped ""off the radar' but thankfully have been revived for Home Video on VHS and now DVD - thanks to VCI Entertainment.

1389774,2,B000053SNS,"This is not as much a review of the serial as it is a comment about the previous review.  Anyone who thinks VCI Entertainment of Tulsa Oklahoma has good serial prints hasn't seen many serials.  VCI has more serials than anyone else, but their work is suspect at best.  In their latest catalog they advertise the Buck Jones serial, ""White Eagle"" with a nice picture of a poster for a non-serial made by Buck Jones by the same title.  Picky you say?  How can any professional film company make such a careless and ignorant error?  VCI's catalog of serials is extensive, but many are very inferior to other serials restored by private collectors.  Their shoddy work isn't limited to serials either.  I recently purchased a set of Buster Crabbe westerns listing 4 movies.  One movie listed in the advertisement and on the cover isn't on the DVD.  Another film with a different title is, though.  But, enough about VCI's poor quality work and inferior marketing....Red Barry is a disappointing serial that's so hard to follow that the actors can't seem to figure out what's going on either.  It's basically a series of chapters where several groups pass bonds back and forth with such regularity that the group with the bonds doesn't even know they have them.  The picture quality of this VHS version is fair and the sound is marginal.  Like a lot of serials that VCI has released on VHS, this one still hasn't been released on DVD, perhaps this one because it's not very good.

Finally, if you're looking for serials you're probably going to end up with some VCI ones simply because of the volumes of materials they have.  If you want high quality restoration, VCI lags behind other sources though and could do a lot better job if they wanted to.",1194739200,12,1742,4.662295081967213

7929985,4,B000053SNS,"In-between outer space jaunts as comic strip heroes Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers, Olympic swimming champion-turned-movie-star Larry ""Buster"" Crabbe headlined another action-packed cliffhanger serial based on a classic newspaper comic: RED BARRY (1938).

Crabbe portrays the titular Barry, a two-fisted, rule-breaking cop whose beat is Chinatown (which means, of course, lots of occidental actors in Asian make-up and rather offensive pidgin English). The plot is typical chapterplay hokum with various factions (the Mob, Chinese agents, Russians, etc.) all trying to steal - and then keep - two million dollars in bonds. There's the requisite number of car chases, fistfights and shootouts, and throughout it all, the charismatic Crabbe remains a tough and impressively athletic hero.

Based on the popular, but now nearly-forgotten, comic strip of the same name, created by cartoonist Will Gould as a competitor for Chester Gould's (no relation) more famous Dick Tracy, RED BARRY was the fortieth sound serial produced by Universal Studios, and the third of five in which Crabbe starred. It's ably directed by veterans Forde Beebe and Alan James, but falls into the same pattern as most cop & robbers serials, with lots of repetitive action and unproductive running back-and-forth. Still, this is really only bothersome if you try to watch the whole 13 chapters in one sitting -- and that's not how these films were meant to be experienced.

Never before available on disc, VCI's new 2-disc DVD includes all 13 chapters and sports a remarkable 1.331 full-frame transfer from a high quality source. Contrast is good, and the overall quality (aside from some of the stock footage) is excellent. The image is virtually free of blemishes, specks or dirt, and considering the serial's vintage, looks terrific. The only extras are a still gallery, promos for other VCI serial releases, and extensive, informative liner notes by Clifford Weimer.

For Buster Crabbe fans and serial buffs, RED BARRY is highly recommended.",1290643200,,2014,5.34384858044164
7929986,5,B000053SNS,For me Buster Crabbe is just plain cool. This serial is evidence of that. It's action oriented and just plain fun. It's hard to watch just one episode. This is not academy award winning stuff but like I said it was made for fun entertainment. The cliff-hangers are crazy at times but they do keep you going to the next episode to find out what happens. Best of all. I love Fedora hats and this serial is full of them (Icing on the cake). This serial was made in 1938. So there are also lots of cool old cars as well.,1288656000,,516,4.118811881188119
7929987,4,B000053SNS,"""Red Barry"" is a 13-chapter serial from Universal released in 1938, starring Larry ""Buster"" Crabbe and directed by Ford Beebe and Alan James, based on a newspaper comic strip by Will Gould that was one of several intended to compete with ""Dick Tracy.""  Universal's effort was likely ""inspired"" by Republic's serials based on the better-known strip.

The plot involves two million dollars in bonds, supplied by Russia to an unnamed country under siege and entrusted to an oriental importer, Wing Fu (Syril Delevanti) to be taken to the United States for the purchase of airplanes.  Back in the U.S., ""crack police agent"" Red Barry is investigating a series of murders taking place in Chinatown.  Wing Fu feels that while Red Barry could be a useful ally, he could also be a problem, because the purchase of warplanes is in violation of the United States' neutrality in the conflict.  But there are other people after the bonds; underworld chieftain Quong Lee (Frank Lackteen), and a Russian dancer named Natacha (Edna Sedgwick) who claims the money is rightfully hers.  Red Barry has problems of his own with the Police Commissioner (William Gould) who takes him off the Chinatown Murders in favor of bumbling British ""scientific detective"" Valentine Vane (Hugh Huntley).  But with the help of his boss, Inspector Scott (Wade Boteler) and female newspaper reporter Mississippi (Frances Robinson) Red Barry continues his investigation of both the murders and the stolen bonds.

The story has a complicated bunch of characters, of more depth than usual for serial movies.  There is no clear division between ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" since those after the bonds are all operating outside the law, to varying degrees, and each employs some thugs to further their efforts.  It is unfortunate that the writers didn't lavish as much attention on the basic plot mover; pursuit of the bonds gets old in a hurry, and some of the plot twists don't make a lot of sense.  The confusion as to who has the bonds extends to the written ""recap"" titles at the beginning of the chapters which are occasionally wrong.  The cliffhangers are not elaborate, and sometimes uninspired; two chapters in a row have Red Barry dropped through the same trap door, though it is supposed to be in different locations.  And dumping Buster Crabbe in the harbor is not likely to help the evildoers any more than releasing the lions did in Clyde Beatty's serials.  But by serial movie standards the acting is good; special mention should be made of Philip Ahn as ""Hong Kong Cholly,"" a friend of Red Barry who has to work against him at times.  The action is fairly lively, with only short sections of padding, mostly by means of the performances in a Vaudeville theatre.  It holds interest best if watched one chapter at a time, making the struggle for possession of the bonds seem less redundant.

VCI's edition on DVD, # 8585 is supplied on two discs, with a pamphlet having background information on the comic strip and the serial.  The transfer is a remarkably good, sharp and clear, to the point where significant difference can be seen between the material created for the serial and the many pieces of ""stock"" footage.  A few ""frozen frames"" are seen in a couple chapters possibly to cover film damage, but the overall picture quality is impressive, much cleaner than the earlier edition on VHS.  The titles are rock steady and quite clean.  But all chapters have the same MPPDA Certificate number, 4292; in 1938 individual numbers were assigned to each chapter, as they were in the VHS edition with a couple exceptions.  Still, the editing has title pictures of the main characters only on the first three chapters, standard at the time for Universal serials, and the sound appears to be the original for each of them.  The sound is fairly good, though some distortion is present, noticed especially in the title music of some of the chapters, but it never gets bad enough to be a problem during the dialogue.

So a good serial, if not a really great one, with many well-known character actors and a plot that is complex enough to maintain interest, and the price for two discs with excellent transfer quality is a bargain.

Note that while my review appears under more than one edition, it was for the DVD, which as noted has a LOT cleaner picture, and crisper sound than VCI's old one on VHS.",1286323200,3,4367,4.813922356091031
