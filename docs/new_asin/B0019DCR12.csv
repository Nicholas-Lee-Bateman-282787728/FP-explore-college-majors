this film is in fullscreen format, bare bones, but runs just as long as the original vhs addition but 4% faster.
the only difference? sandahl bergman's scene of her running out of the bathroom sniffing her nose after doing some
white stuff is replaced by her being found in the staul by her friend played by kim evenson kong'ed out.

this version is in mono rather than stereo and runs exactly 1 hr 25 min 51 sec. by avenue entertainment 2004

the format is pal region 0(get an ntsc/pal multi-region dvd player). i don't know if the unrated pal region 2 was ever released in the united states or not, i haver search the entire web for it. some site even claim their is only 88 minutes, maybe they were unfortunate to get a bad copy.

the reason this version is good to own? most of the vhs copies floating around have either bad pause spots, silver streaks in them or are just plain worn-out from being rented so many times ove rthe last 25 years.

the starmaker vhs version i have never seen and because it is apprently in cheapo e.p. mode. i won't buy it, because my vhs player's tracking is digital(meaning no knob to manually fix the tracking for perfect picture) and most e.p. mode vhs tapes look grainy anyway.",1274313600,4,1317,4.381147540983607
