6590079,5,B00MNBTNZC,"This movie is so much fun from start to finish, not to be taken seriously of course, you know what your getting yourself into from the title so you have to be a real horror nut with an open mind, its very evil dead in a way that it uses fantastic practical monster zombie beaver effects and make-up and animatronic puppets and lots of blood etc, the movie basically as you can tell is about a group of young friends go out to a remote cabin for a quiet getaway only to find they start to get attacked by mutant zombie beavers, there is some funny characters in the movie with great dialogue and laugh out loud cheesy beaver jokes etc, the cast is all great especially the three hot girls, there's even some great topless nudity! The run time is well paced out with humour and horror, this is a gem of a horror and is dying to become a cult classic, make sure you certainly check this one out it shouldn't be missed! Its dam good! I'm also glad to see this movie gets a decent Blu-ray release!

Blu-ray has good picture quality.
Special features include a few short behind the scenes, deleted scenes and auditions.
85mins run time.",1419379200,5,1130,4.355450236966824
6590080,3,B00MNBTNZC,"Three babes head out to a cabin in the woods where they encounter Beavers turned into zombies due to a toxic waste spill. Add some personal problems, no phone service, and guys and you got the picture...exactly what you would expect looking at the DVD cover. And yes they all wear bikinis.

The film had some good scenes. I liked how they tied together the opening and closing scenes. The girl conversation dialogue was good, but went off a cliff went the guys showed up as did the film. The beavers were more fake looking than an Oscar Erickson postcard (obscure reference). Campy by design. The ending outtakes were better than much of the film.

Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Cortney Palm- ""Sushi Girl"")

Note: Toxic waste is generally not transported in an open bed truck and it rarely looks like radiator fluid.",1419120000,3,814,4.71830985915493
6590081,5,B00MNBTNZC,Of course I loved this movie my daughter is Zoe.  Thanks so much for selling this in the states.,1418515200,6,96,4.052631578947368
6590082,4,B00MNBTNZC,"Just like most people I love a good zombie flick and if it's got creatures in it too, then bring it on (as the homies say). This little gem is just that. Three girlfriends decided to have a relaxing weekend in the backwoods of America, They are staying in a log cabin near an idyllic lake.

What they don't know is that some dysfunctional and sexually ambivalent delivery guys have accidentally poisoned the water supply with some toxins that cause the local beaver population to become the undead. Then their boyfriends make a surprise visit and the merry troop start to get down and dirty in their wooden cabin - where strangely there is no mobile phone cover.

Then just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water - or indeed stay in a wooden construction - the beavers strike - mwaaah.

Yes this is really funny, a bit gory and a bit sexist, but it is all done with tongue in cheek or cheeks, and with more beaver jokes than you can shake a stick at; this really does deliver. I liked `'Sharknado 1 and 2' so I was always going to find this one brilliant. The beavers are great too - like Jim Henson had a bad day at the Muppet ranch. The jokes keep coming right to the end, so you have to watch the run off credits. For some mindless zombie related fun - with beavers - you need look no further - brilliant.",1418342400,9,1322,4.238095238095238
6590083,4,B00MNBTNZC,"Low brow C movie fun! I like the movie it was simply,  dun and just plain old goofball horror comedy. Don't wear your serious hat and you'll be just fine. Enjoy the ride and don't take any high brow cinema lovers along and it's all good!",1415491200,5,237,4.1521739130434785
6590084,2,B00MNBTNZC,"I'm guessing, much like Kevin Smith's TUSK, the makers of this film came up with the concept while they were just goofing off (maybe with an herbal jazz cigarette or two), and then one of them dared the other one to actually make the thing. If there's one thing that's obvious, it's that the title came first, because it's easily the funniest and cleverest part of the whole movie.

I'm not going to insult you by discussing the plot. I will say that I was impressed by some of the film's restraint. For instance, it took the movie nearly 17 minutes to use the word ""beaver"" as a double entendre. It only did this twice more before one of the characters actually requested that people stop making ""beaver jokes,"" and sure enough, there were no more in the script. Too bad the rest of the jokes were just as lazy.

It's tough to know what position to take on a movie called ZOMBEAVERS. Was it a good or bad thing that the beavers almost always looked like very poorly made puppets? Was it clever that every young character was a horrible person, and that only the (barely there) adults were really decent, interesting, or complex characters? Are jokes about being raped by your father funny? Are they?

If that stuff strikes your fancy, you might enjoy ZOMBEAVERS. The best I can say for the movie is that it had a ""take no prisoners"" attitude that reminded me, in some small ways, of FEAST, another gross-out, horror-comedy played mostly for shocks. FEAST had the benefit of being more intelligently self-aware, though. This movie has the sense of being completely uninterested in itself, going the easy route with nearly every set-up, nearly every joke, and nearly every gory gag or jump scare. If it had lampooned itself a bit more, gone even a shade more cartoonish, just twisted that satirical knob up to 11, then it might have proved worthy of its name.

The opening of the movie -- starring one of my favorite stand-ups, Bill Burr -- is pretty funny. Beyond that, the most entertaining things about the are the outtakes at the end and the hilarious theme song that plays over the end credits, which means most audiences will be happiest when the movie is over.",1415059200,4,2166,4.603626943005182

This premise is also why it's so very good, as it's done in good humor without trying to be serious.  The acting is surprisingly good, the camera work is capable, and the zombeavers are practical props (not CGI) which actually lends to the laughs.

6590112,4,B00MNBTNZC,"This movie shouldn't work, unless it's on the Sci-Fi Channel alongside the Sharkado series or Mega Shark Vs. Crocosaurus -- the latter having better motivation for a fight than Batman V. Superman.

Back to Zombeavers....a movie I truly thought would be a travesty when I watched it on Netflix, but as a horror movie fan, this movie works as truly enjoyable camp. And the best part is that it knows it's total camp! From the first scene that sets the stage (comedian Bill Bur and songwriter John Mayer in an improvisational free-for-all) through the opening credits that play like a Scooby-Doo intro, this film sets the tone for a film embracing all of the monster-in-the-woods horror cliches without overstaying its welcome. The three female leads (Rachel Melvin, Courtney Palm, and Lexi Atkins) command attention as their obviously clichd stereotypes -- the 'virgin', the 'nerd', and the 'promiscuous' -- but with fun twists on those clichs that redefine each character by the end. Supporting characters played by well-recognized actors Rex Linn (CSI: Miami, Django Unchained, 3rd Rock from the Sun, Rush Hour) and Brent Briscoe (Justified, The Dark Knight Rises, Deadwood, Spiderman 2) round out a fun cast.

At under 90 min, this film clips along and delivers more than it should. If you like horror camp, this is worth checking out.",1466035200,2,1336,5.040723981900452

The ""boyfriends"" are all very unlikable people. I kept asking myself why any of the women would even want to go out with them. There is a rather abrasive woman who, as the film moves on, became more likeable to me.

there is a slight ""twist"" with one of the characters that took me by surprise and I had to rewind as I thought I missed something.

As a late Saturday movie it was ok but I would never ask anyone to see it with me nor would I ever want to see it again. I ""could"" if someone wanted to see it but I wouldn't really recommend it.

6590134,1,B00MNBTNZC,"Zombeavers did absolutely nothing for me.  There is absolutely no fear factor involved, the so-called disgusting parts are just desperate attempts at shock value, and the humor falls completely flat, especially the constant supply of beaver jokes.  I have to believe that the target audience is middle school boys who will laugh at all of the beaver innuendoes, whether they actually get the jokes or not.  The special effects aren't realistic at all, especially that of the zombeavers.  I cant argue with the filmmakers decision not to use CGI, but the animatronic beaver effects they give us aren't any more ambitious than beavers on a stick, with someone shaking the stick back and forth.  I couldn't even find a single character to like or root for, apart from a small dog.  The young people being attacked are the epitome of dumb, self-centered kids.  I couldn't even rustle up any support for the girl who just found out her boyfriend was cheating on her.  And do I even have to mention the fact that the entire script is utterly predictable?

I am more partial to these kind of dumb, low-budget movies than most, but one word  stupid  seems to say everything I want to say about Zombeavers.  That is why I am so surprised that a lot of people actually seemed to enjoy this crude horror-comedy.  I got no enjoyment out of this film at all.

6590138,3,B00MNBTNZC,"""Zombeavers"" deserves three stars just for the insanely ridiculous premise of zombie beavers. What's not to love about that? Well, it turns out that this is a mixed bag. Opening with cameos of John Mayer (!) and Bill Burr as rednecks in a pickup truck transporting drums of toxic waste, texting and driving emerges as an early theme, and the result is a 55-gallon drum labeled ""Biohazard"" in a lake, springing a leak on a beaver's dam. This is obviously a spoof and succeeds as parody on many levels including the common plot setup.

Needless to say, there are three horrible sorority sisters (Cortney Palm, Rachel Melvin, and Lexi Atkins) going out to weekend at a cabin on a lake where they will party and heal a broken heart in one case. I was amused by the extra-atrocious music in the car, which was so awful even the dog hated it. Quickly the girls end up swimming in the lake (Guess how this got its ""R"" rating.) They see the beaver's dam and call out ""Here beaver, beaver, beaver."" No beavers appear, but a bear does, which makes Zoe (Palm) suddenly modest. There is a chance encounter with Smyth, who frightens the bear away with a gun before the horrible and flatulent boyfriends (Hutch Dano, Jake Weary, and Peter Gilroy) show up and take the film down a notch while attempting to max out the offense-o-meter.

We end up with six perfectly awful adolescents in the lake house and I just couldn't wait for something to start killing them off. Fortunately there is a zombie beaver in the tub. The worst of the guys, Buck (Gilroy), is the first targeted by the beavers, and not a moment too soon. Through a ferocious beaver battle they all end up on a raft in the lake, where there is not only beaver mayhem, but an alligator rampage. They can't phone for help because the phone lines have been cut by beavers (an especially wonderful plot twist), and their cellphones don't have signal (how could they expect to last the weekend?) An especially poignant fate awaits the dog which merely foreshadows the fate of the annoying youths. I wondered why after the first sign of beaver-related injuries they didn't get in their fully functioning cars and leave, but this being a horror-comedy called ""Zombeavers"" means that they are legally required to wait till nightfall when they would have to endure a beaver gauntlet. After giardia (""Beaver Fever"") is discussed (""Any of you guys got diarrhea?"") the zombie beaver possessions start in earnest. This is a process that's comically gross, earning zombie transmogrification bonus points for the filmmakers. Since the cabin is made of wood, and beavers habitually chew wood, you can probably predict where this is all going: yes, the cast gets to engage in a game of ""Whack-A-Beaver"", much like the childhood game ""Whack-A-Mole"", but with mutant zombie beavers. Kudos to ""Zombeavers"" for this totally predictable but hilariously executed scene in particular; it was probably my favorite in the movie.

Of course even in the throes of a deadly zombie beaver attack, there's time for romance, but that screeches to a halt with a suicidal beaver electrocution and resultant structural fire. The film finishes with far fewer cast members than it started with (I trust I'm not spoiling anything with that revelation), and I was especially amused by the way the film lapped itself at the end proving that it's not over till it's over. If there was one thing I especially loved about this movie it was the closing credit theme song crooned in the style of Mel Torm (""Say goodbye to your golden retriever...Zombeaver!"") This song was worth the wait till the very end, and was an especially funny skewering of the horror genre: what musical style could be more placid, after all?

The DVD has a lot of great extras, many of which are better than the actual film. By far my favorite is Stephen Merchant interviewing Bill Burr and John Mayer in the most straight-laced way possible: Mayer in particular is hilarious as he discusses paying $30,000 for acting lessons just to get the part. This interview segment is a brilliant addition to the package and is absolutely essential viewing. There is a cast and crew commentary which has a few amusing diversions (note in particular the discussion of a very specific type of rash), a short behind the scenes segment, ""Building a Beaver"", which was far more interesting than expected for a film of this budget, a makeup segment (""Man Becomes Monster""), audition videos (that gets a bit tedious), an entertaining storyboard segment, and three variations of the trailer for the film, all of which were well done.

""Zombeavers"" was hard to rate: there are moments and concepts that elevate the horror parody almost to high art, but those are sometimes offset by pointlessly annoying situations of dubious crassness that tend to get old quickly. The film does feature some gore and effects that are decent for the budget, and is definitely deserving of its ""R"" rating. If you like parodies, schlock, or the horror-comedy genre and aren't easily offended, ""Zombeavers"" is the best movie about undead semiaquatic rodents that I know of.",1441152000,6,5114,4.833333333333333
6590139,4,B00MNBTNZC,"I recently caught ""Zombeavers"" via an online streaming service, and while it certainly had a lot of the intentional and unintentional humor that  a movie called ""Zombeavers"" promises, it also surprised me.  As well as the silliness, there is also a decent attempt at delivering genuine scares, a creepy/disturbing vibe when called for,  and surprising plot developments  It's like they used the silly title and blatantly puppet-like beaver effects to get viewers' guard down, and then- wow!- you see that for long stretches you're getting a genuine horror movie, and an intense one, at that.

Now, I don't want to overpraise the movie, only point out that in addition to the frequent cheap jokes and double entendres made all too easily available by the title, you get a little more.  And, hey, the puppet-style beavers actually aren't all that bad.  Sure, you'll smile at their phoniness here and there, but other times they're actually pretty scary-looking.  And, in this age of everything being CGI, I admire the filmmakers for actually using practical effects for the entirety of their movie, even if that choice was mainly due to budgetary considerations.  They still rose to the challenge and made everything more or less work.

Because of a drum of toxic waste, beavers become undead and start attacking college students staying at a remote lakeside cabin on vacation. As you see, Zombeavers offers parodies of familiar story elements of the 1980s horror movies, as well as gores and nudity.

Some moments are funny, and I like the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the film that uses (intentionally, I think) cheesy puppet effects, but Zombeavers runs out of trick quickly after the initial attack of the creatures. The middle section, where not many things happen, is pretty dull.

Two hillbilly delivery guys delivering toxic materials riding along a country road, hit a deer and container of their poisonous goo falls into a small, beaver infested lake.

It's usual horror movie set-up where the girls are soon joined by their boyfriends at the rustic cabin, and the next thing you know, zombie beavers are attacking.

I'm normally a big fan of stupid. I willingly admit, I enjoy more than a fair share of those lame Syfy movies, and with a little editing, ""Zombeavers"" could almost go into steady rotation with ""Snakehead Terror"" and ""Lavalantula"". Where the film loses me, is the supposedly ""clever"" dialogue, which just.......doesn't........stop.

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

So some guys are transporting some dangerous chemicals down the road in a truck and they get into an accident and lose one of the canisters of chemicals.  It lands on a beaver lodge and it mutates the beavers into zombie beavers that crave warm flesh.

Then we have a group of college kids who show up and we get a bunch of obligatory topless scenes and sex scenes that are usually in these movies.  Moving along the beavers show up and they start attacking people.  When people are bitten die and then come back as mutant/zombie/beaver hybrids.  These people grow beaver tails and claws and huge buck teeth.  I have to admit that these costumes made me laugh hysterically at how lame they were!  Also the ""beavers"" themselves are pretty bad, they are pretty much just hand puppets.  Seriously, I've seen high school football mascot suits that were more convincing than those things.  But again, it was so funny to watch!

6590178,4,B00MNBTNZC,"Given the state of zombiemania in television and film it was only a matter of time before someone came up with the idea of injecting mother nature with an undead virus. This isn't an especially new concept to be sure, numerous movies have spoofed the undead horror trope time and again using everything from humans, to vultures, to hamburger patties.

This begs the question - Why watch Zombeavers?

Ill be honest, I got out voted. My wife and parents decided on the movie while I was busy taking care of the kids. Pfft. Not that I was entirely opposed to seeing the movie, it looked silly and stupid, but also like a movie you needed to be in the right mood to see.

Turns out Zombeavers is a helluva lot of fun. Jordan Rubin and Al Kaplan know exactly what type of movie they are making, embrace the silliness and go out of their way to siphon every single laugh possible out of every single scene.zombeavers beavers zombies girls horror comedy nudity

The premise is simple enough. Barrel falls off a truck. Barrel rolls into pond. Toxic something or other leaks out onto beaver dam. Horny college kids go to cabin thats right next to pond. Queue shenanigans. The movie is campy as hell. All the creature effects are done using puppets, remote control mock-ups and latex. They are done well and its clear the production team had a lot of fun making the movie. The intro is also a pleasant surprise as the credits role through a very low budget Creepshow-like animated sequence. (Word is the director used an iPad app to create the effects)

The acting is pretty decent all around. Several hollywood staples appear in the movie, including: Rex Lin, Brent Briscoe, and Robert Shafer. The college kids do a terrific job as well. Cortney Palm, who previously showed up in a small but solid role in Sushi Girl, plays Zoe, the caustic bad girl who is constantly talking s*** and stirring up trouble. Along with Hutch Dano the two carry the film through a series of comedic homages and horror references that are a ton of fun to watch.

The screenplay is fairly simple in structure (given that its emulating standard zombie tropes) but well written. The dialogue is snappy and quick, timing the comedy well from beginning to end. The movie is ripe for endless beaver jokes and the filmmakers don't miss the opportunities.
Zombeavers is a hoot for the casual horror fans and a riot if you enjoy zom-coms. Its not going to win any awards, but youll probably not be sorry you spent 70 minutes checking it out.",1433894400,2,2502,4.61123595505618
6590179,4,B00MNBTNZC,"This flick dutifully pays homage to the likes of Piranha 3D (2010), which feels like an Academy Award winner next to this.  It answers what happens when an inexperienced director teams up with two inexperienced writers, none of whom having written or directed anything in horror?  Certainly nothing amazing, but perhaps something thats still worth the price of admission at the very leastas long as you brought beer, that is.  Thats what Zombeavers is.  Its the very leastthe very least that it takes to watch a movie and not hate, regret or dislike it to the point that it cannot be enjoyed.

This movie is definitely funny (and fun in general), but there are scenes that I feel may not have been intentionally funny (although this film is very self-aware of its quality and tone).  The acting is deplorable, the writing is horrendous, theres basically no story nor any clever shots to boast.  Yet I didn't mind.

Perhaps a product of the films own self-awareness, no time is wasted before leaping into some lakeside nudity.  It may not be raining breasts in terms of the gratuitous nudity, but they got to it right away for those who care.  Later in the film well endure some quintessentially tasteless sex scenes (brief nudity at most) that feel like a one-way ticket to pound town on frat row.  The sex dialogue is pretty funny.

The highlight of the film is animatronic beavers, which are delightfully bad.  After being exposed to some sort of toxic waste that was dumped in their lake, these rabid twitchy zombie beavers remind me of the glorious creature effects of the 80s.  Their spastic movements are reminiscent of evil Muppets or shaky-limbed gremlins.  While they are surely funny to watch, something about them remains menacing.  ReallyI think the twitchiness makes them appropriately off-putting.  Im somewhat reminded of the mounted deer head in Evil Dead 2 (1987) crossed with the trickster gopher from Caddyshack (1980).

As if directly copying scenes out of Night of the Living Dead (1968), the zombeavers break their way through boarded up windows in the panicked victims vacation house.  The beavers are pretty smart.  They chew through phone lines and know when to regroup.

If the cheap zombeavers were the best aspect of the film, the gore came next.  The rubber guts and torn latex flesh is thankfully abundant as throats are bitten and bodies sundered.

Quite a pleasure was the transformation of a bitten girl into a werebeaver zombie (or werezombeaver?)not unlike what happened in Black Sheep (2006).  These infected victims behave as if they caught a beavered up version of the Evil Deads (2013) contagious zombie demonism.  After being infected, a young woman twerks her tailYES, she grew a beaver tailand terrorizes her friends with her buck teeth which pushed their way through her front teeth.  She even bites off a guys guy parts in the spirit of Piranha 3D (2010).  Yikes!

Clearly this flick has a good sense of humor.  At one point a guy throws his girlfriends dog in the water as a decoy for the beavers and when the zombeavers break their way through the cabin floor, its like a game of Whack-a-Mole.

The ending (and opening) scene is gloriously stupid, along with the outtakes at the end.  My favorite outtake was the dog in the water being chased by the zombeaver props.

 Once again my faith in moviedom has been vindicated.  I watch so much trash that I sometimes become discouraged but my friends, Zombeavers is a golden find.
 It is of course a low budget Zombie film, not Gone with the Wind, don't get me wrong on that point.  But Zombeavers shows that bright writing and strong acting can overcome the limitations of small budgets.
 Some college kids go out to a secluded lake for some down time.  One of the girls has a boyfriend who cheated on her and the three girls have it in mind to just chill and heal, just the gals, no distractions.  Naturally, their horny boyfriends crash the party with week end sexual extravaganza in their minds.  With mutated Zombie beavers in the lake, terror not romance is on the menu.
 Ok, not an original idea.  I can think of several Zombie movies that have the same set up and tons of other horror flicks with the same idea, so why watch?  Because the young actors (I say actors because they are actors and not car hops or bus boys standing in front of a camera) pull it off.  You never have the idea that they are anything but young college kids with little beyond having fun on their minds suddenly caught up in a very dangerous situation.  As written, the kids are nice kids, not the bad or vile creatures we sometimes get in Zombie flicks or characters who are just too dumb to live.  We like them for what they are, so we care if the Zombie beavers eat them up.
 Rachel Melvin, Cortney Palm and Lexi Atkins play the three college girls.  All are solid with Cortney Palm providing an especially entertaining performance as the most exuberant of the trio.
 Director Jordan Rubin keeps his young actors focused on screen, which if we judge by the out takes in the credits, must have been a job.  Zombeavers marks his debut as a feature film director.  His background comes from several years on the comedy circuit and several more years writing for TV comics.  As he also wrote the script, along with Al Kaplan and Jon Kaplan.  The Kaplans have worked together on other projects, namely Code Monkeys and Piranaconda.  They filled the dialog with authentic seeming quips that the actors toss around with aplomb.
 The make up comes well above the usual standards.  For special effects, the crew uses anamatronic beavers rather than CGI which looks quaint but the beavers do look like beavers.  When the contamination spreads enough to create human Zombies, the make up effects are quite good.
 Sound and the other production values come up to regular Hollywood standards, the script provides tension as well as laughs and some horrifying bits to horrify us and actors who are capable of creating characters that we like enough to care if they survive or not.  I liked this low budget Zombie movie and not just for cheesy laughs.
 Zombeavers lasts for 85 minutes and carries a strong R rating for sexual situations (college kids you understand), gore, lots of bad language and prolonged shots of the lovely miss Cortney Palm wearing only half of her bikini.
 Movie fans will recognize Rex Linn in the role of Smyth the local hunter.  He has made his career as a character actor and has some 87 TV and film credits.  His performance naturally has more depth than his younger fellows but they stand up pretty well and are not overwhealmed by the more expierenced actor.
 Zombeavers was filmed in Santa Clarita California at a Disney facility there in only 21 days.

6590204,4,B00MNBTNZC,"Zombeavers is, first and foremost, a morality tale about not texting and driving. When you text and drive you might hit a deer while driving a truck full of poorly secured barrels of chemicals, one of these barrels may roll free and end up floating downriver, it may spring a leak at a beaver dam populated by ridiculous looking fake beavers, and these beavers might become a truly dreadful hazard for people.
Yes, before you ask, that is the basic plot for this movie...and it is just as awesome as you might imagine from that description. It's like the movie Black Sheep, but with beavers, and without the whole intentional experimentation element...and it is about as good as Black Sheep was as well.
Like everyone would expect to see in a terrible movie along these lines, the main cast consists of three passably attractive, scantily clad sorority girls on vacation at a lake cabin (and a small dog). The lake in question brought to mind the lake from Creepshow 2, and that made me happy.
If you're looking for a movie filled to the brim with horror clichs, ludicrous practical effects in place of CGI, and mutated animals...this is your movie. The acting is good for the type of movie it is, and it does include the line, ""Would you rather watch your mom get murdered by your daddy, or get raped by your daddy while your mom had to watch?"" To which the response was, ""I guess, get raped by my dad."" The production value is abnormally high quality for the absurd subject matter, and that makes it even more humorous.

The beavers themselves aren't nearly as impressive as I'd hoped for. They resemble grotesque muppets and you rarely see one full frame. They are always presented near a large object that can hide the puppeteer.

6590234,2,B00MNBTNZC,"Three female friends drive out to a cabin in the woods for a girls getaway after one of the trio finds out that her boyfriend cheated on her at a party.  Then the boyfriends show up.  Then there's some noisy but nudity free sex involving the two couples who are still couples while the remaining girl and her ex glare at each other in the living room.

Zombeavers starts off like a cross between one of those crappy sci-fi channel monster movies and a T&A comedy without the actual T&A--or actual laughs.  Then the first zombeaver shows up and the movie improves dramatically--for about twenty minutes.  After that the lame characters and the complete lack of ambition by the filmmakers quickly sinks this thing again.

Rather than go the cheap CGI route of monsters in sci-fi channel movies Zombeavers go old school with puppets that make the monsters reminiscent of the ill tempered critters from the Critters films of the 1980's.  The energetic and noisy monsters give Zombeavers a quick adrenaline rush of humorous fun--but unfortunately it turns out to be more of a sugar rush that lasts only until you realize the movie isn't actually going to get any better, even with the monsters.

None of the human characters are developed adequately that you can actually care about them or even really tell them apart.  After the monsters are introduced the filmmakers only come up with one reasonably creative thing to do with them--a sight gag where zombeavers under the floorboards turn the cabin into a real life version of whack-a-mole.  Otherwise it seems like virtually no thought at all went into how to use the critters to generate suspense or laughs--it's all so lazy and uninspired that there's really no good reason to sit through this thing unless your standards for entertainment are extremely low--yes there are monsters; yes there's some gore; yes the film is under 90 minutes long although, to be honest, it feels much longer.

I looked up co-writer/director Jordan Rubin on the IMDB--it turns out he was a writer for The Late Late Show With Craig Kilborn and The Man Show, which ended up explaining a lot, actually.  Zombeavers has the monsters for a good horror comedy but unfortunately it's missing everything else.  The script feels like it was dashed off over the course of a drunken weekend and not looked at again until they actually started shooting it.  There are almost no funny jokes or sight gags, no characters more developed than what you would expect from a comedy sketch, no attempts to create memorable comic or suspense set-pieces--it's just a profoundly lazy excuse for a film and a sad waste of time and cool monsters.",1427846400,,2651,4.823399558498896

6590240,3,B00MNBTNZC,"First time filmmaker Jordan Rubin sure has the strength of an original, creative concept in the plot of his debut Horror-Comedy feature Zombeavers. The feature concerns a group of local beavers being exposed to radiation and, in turn, becoming aggressive beasts that rein terror on a mostly archetypical group of teenage stereotypes during their (equally familiar) cabin stay.  With these predictable elements following the formula tread by so many genre entries before them (even the characters appear to be taken from your garden variety genre entry and, with great luck, they are fairly well-played considering what little material the serviceable script gives them in terms of character development and are a cut above the usually sex obsessed and self-absorbed teenage types that dominate these types of films) it is easy to hope that Jordan is setting up the first slow half hour of the film with these tired story scenarios to lull the audience into a false sense of diminished expectation before turning the clichs on their head with an onslaught of originality (as The Cabin in the Woods did in 2012). For the most part such would be a realistic anticipation that Jordan pulls off competently but, perhaps, not to the degree one may hope.
  Despite some appropriately puppet like creature effects (a welcome break from the usual C.G.I. rubbish that injects the vibe of this creature feature with a 1980s horror feel), the occasional witty line of dialogue and surprisingly solid performances for such a low budget independent feature the narrative sadly never breaks free from the familiarity of the generic chain of horror film events and mostly tired set pieces.
  Throughout the duration Zombeavers sports appropriately tongue in cheek atmosphere (obviously a film with such a moniker can't be taken too seriously). It is going for a certain cult status but it never really becomes as wild and in your face as one might suspect but wisely, at a mere seventy-eight minutes in length, it gets in, does what it has to do with fair competence and just enough in terms of pace, B movie bravado, effective suspense and bargain basement level humor and to work as sufficient entertainment that doesnt overstay its welcome. It seems to give just enough of a buildup in the first half and there are plenty of clever parallels to the vastly superior Critters series (which it appears to be the far bloodier cousin to in terms of overall tone and seems to be on a par in terms of plentiful gore effects with Peter Jacksons Dead Alive and Evil Dead 2), such as one scene where the beasts eyes seem to gleam in the dark as they all gather together, sprinkled throughout that the fellow movie admirer should adore and the production values are surprisingly competent. In actuality it wouldnt be out of place to compare the look and feel of this film, and the way it riotously embraces its B movie roots, to one of Troma Films more clever efforts.
  The gore effects are plentiful and imaginative in their conception and use, it starts out with a strong scene of hilarity in the first sequence of the movie that it never quite equals, handles light comedy with its serious thrill ride aspects quite successfully but it really is nothing we haven't seen many times before and never becomes as wild as it could be. Such pulls the film further down into mediocrity although its unique promise still makes it stand a little bit above most entries in the genre. One cant help but feel that the filmmakers were overly confident in the material and that is how we are given so many elements which work, and a script that misses opportunities for humor and unique horror pieces it seems to set-up and forget or ignore entirely, and that is the reason for the inconsistencies in the pieces which are successful and those which arent.
  Regardless, Zombeavers should appease most of us who were raised on low-budget gore fests even if we cannot shake the nagging impression that director Rubin is trying a little too desperately to imitate a good time instead of delivering us one. There is no substance or levity, which is to be expected and could be what some filmgoers will seek it out for, and it should bring back fond nostalgia for us fellow genre addicts of the far better efforts in the Horror-Comedy sub-genre which popped up in droves around the time VHS rentals and straight to video genre fare were at their pinnacle. That may sound like less than an enthusiastic bit of praise but, as it stands, its enough for us who are getting tired of the route seriousness of the genre and desperate to see it injected with a little bit of fun. This is the kind of movie that wants to be a film friends rent and watch on a Friday night and enjoy until the end credits roll and fondly reminisce on bits and pieces that stuck in their mind more than the movie itself. It may not prove to be one of the greats but, that is exactly the type of feature Rubin has created and a feeling, and a venue, perfectly suited for the quality of this bit of celluloid itself. Zombeavers is worthy of a single viewing but don't expect to see anything quite as clever as the differentiations of the living dead plot in this film may have you believe.",1427414400,2,5220,4.708652792990143

Almost enough laughs, almost enough T&A, almost enough blood and gore - all the things you want in a campy b-horror comedy. I think the director and writers should have removed that one last cinematic filter, and really just ""gone for it"" and let the movie go all the way (as the filmmakers did with 2005's ""Feast"", for example).

Deranged beavers attack the unsuspecting, sexually active young folks during a weekend getaway in the woods. I LOVE this movie!!! I am particularly fond of Cortney Palm who plays Zoe.
Five stars out of five. Big thumbs up!",1423008000,,319,4.714285714285714

Young actors, willing to do almost anything for an acting job, even wearing prosthetic beaver teeth and tails, in character, managing to create onscreen tension through sheer will power and acting ability. As usual, I was highly impressed with the subtle jokes they wrote into the script.",1422230400,2,353,5.103448275862069

8673170,3,B00MNBTNZC,"Terrible poster aside, this was surprisingly watchable.  A spoof of zombie films, this one has some legitimate surprises, and some decently clever dialog.  It also has nudity, some sex, some gore, and profanity, so be prepared.  The movie is exploitative for sure, and is campy, while at the same time, it tries to take itself a bit seriously.  One effective trick the movie pulls off is making otherwise obnoxious characters very sympathetic as the movie goes along.  That's one reason I did not care for the (first) ending, which was abrupt and final (you'll see).  There is a second ending after the credits finish, which opens up possibilities for a sequel.

Otherwise, not all the acting is smooth, but the cast overall is effective.  The ""zombeavers"" are puppets, so don't expect slick CGI effects.  There is also a disturbing scene involving a dog, in case you are an animal lover.

If you decide to watch this, Make sure you check out the blooper reel at the end, as well as the ""Zombeaver"" theme song, delivered in true crooner style.  It's a hoot.",1532217600,,1057,4.752747252747253
8673171,1,B00MNBTNZC,"Zombeavers - 1 Star - Nah

There's too much for me to detail. There seems to be a trend in these reviews that bad equals campy. Problem is, I don't draw the line anywhere near the others. If it ain't campy all the way through, then it's just bad. This movie suffers from bi-polar scenes. One minute it's an absurd farce. The next, it's a serious horror.
The script appears to be written by some 8th graders using Mad Libs Scriptwriter software. There's gratuitous nudity and gore taken to its lowest level. Definitely not for mature audiences.",1532217600,,543,4.597938144329897
