8004271,5,B0000X62AE,"I have had this on VHS for years and bought the DVD so that I will always have it. It is the best of all my execise videos. I rehabilitated myself after a severe back injury as a nurse with this program. It is not a cardio or super strength workout, but my abs are better now than when I was in my teens and I am now 60.",1277942400,,320,3.652173913043478
8004272,4,B0000X62AE,"I found this DVD to be an excellent introduction to utilizing the Flex-Band for your Pilates workout.  Also, if you are training on the Pilates Reformer, I am quite sure that you will find this DVD is an EXCELLENT supplement to your training (as I surely did!).  What I found so excellent about this DVD is the fact that Moria demonstrates all of the Beginner Essential exercises that you perform on the Reformer.  It's a great way to practice the sequence at home if you do not own a Reformer (bonus!).  As for the workout, I am experienced on the Reformer and certified in all levels of mat, and I got an EXCELLENT total body workout, particularly my lower body and of course, abdominals/core.  For example, Moria performs 15 repetitions of 5 exercises from the footwork series, and if you have ever done the footwork series before, you know that this is quite a challenge.  The Back Rowing Series was very through (4 were performed) and was a great core and coordination challenge.  The only complaints I have about this DVD is that the audio was pretty terrible at times, the warm up seemed a bit rushed for Moria, and there were several times she neglected to give the name of the exercise being performed.  As a Certified Instructor, I find that the people who do not benefit from Moria's workouts are using poor form and therefore think her method is easy (which it is anything but).  If you use proper form and technique, you will benefit from this workout greatly.  I would highly recommend this DVD.",1252108800,,1509,4.617977528089888
8004273,4,B0000X62AE,"I thought this workout was great.  I have done a lot of different Pilates workouts, and I think Stott Pilates is the best I've tried.  Moira is so thorough in her explanations of the moves, without being overbearing.  I feel challenged, but at the same time she reassures me that we should work at our own individual level.  I feel very toned and invigorated with this workout.  If I need more resistance, I simply shorten the band length.",1206576000,4,439,4.576923076923077
8004274,5,B0000X62AE,"I'm rather perplexed by the review trashing this DVD. I bought it as one of a package of three DVDs in the Stott pilates flex-band workout series and found it to be a wonderful workout.  This is the introductory workout in the series, and it's a good place to start if your're not used to doing a flex-band Pilates workout.

I might add that I am not a gym rat.  I exercise at home and have used a variety of DVDs, but have been drawn to the Stott series due to their safe pacing and detailed instructions.  Moira is a wonderful instructor.  She offers a thorough explanation of the exercises as you go through them and reminders of correct form throughout the DVD (something that Stott pilates emphasizes more that other pilates DVDs out there).

A regular stength green flex-band is included with the DVD (something you don't have to purchase to do the workout).  If the intensity seems to be too low with that band, an extra strength blue flex-band is available for purchase on the Stott pilates website.",1119484800,11,1007,4.561111111111111
8004275,1,B0000X62AE,"I do NOT recommend this DVD for anyone who...

- Works out on a regular basis

- Is younger than 30 (and does not have a physical disability or injury keeping them from doing execises)

- Someone who wants to get in shape, not practically fall asleep on the mat.

- Someone who has done even the most basic pilates exercises before.

The entire workout was based around those stupid bands (which was not made clear, I don't think, by the back of the DVD) and I felt like I was stretching more than ""sculpting"" or toning anything.",1119484800,4,529,4.357142857142857
