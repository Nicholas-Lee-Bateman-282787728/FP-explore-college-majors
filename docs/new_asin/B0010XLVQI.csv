8239180,5,B0010XLVQI,This is an outstanding DVD for learning to build a fly rod. Russ takes his time to show you how things should be done including some fancy work on the rods. And he is also willing to take emails with questions about rod crafting. Great author. This should be your first DVD on learning how to build a fly rod.,1422835200,,309,4.166666666666667
8239181,5,B0010XLVQI,"As an amateur and advanced-beginner level rod-builder, who wants to do more, I've read a lot of books and watched a number of videos on the subject of building graphite fly rods.  I've also watched a ton of tying and fishing videos. ""The Graphite Fly Rod, How to Build a Modern Classic,"" by Russ Gooding is one of the best-produced and most-informative ""How-Tos"" I've come across.  Certainly it is the best as to building a rod and one of the best among fly-fishing guides generally.  Gooding's explanations of what he is doing on the video are clear and easily understood and he takes the time to tell you why he is doing it.  The camera work is excellent, focusing on the work instead of losing the product in the background or blending it into the tier's shirt (a flaw in many tying videos).  I'm using Gooding's techniques and his video as a guide on a rod I have under construction now, and know already that I've saved hours of time and will have a much higher quality product than I have produced before.  I'll be using this for years to come, although I don't think I'll ever have the guts to use the blow torch -- thankfully, Gooding shows an alternative.",1388966400,,1164,4.492890995260663
8239182,5,B0010XLVQI,I've never tried to build a fishing rod and after watching these videos I feel confident that I can produce a quality fly rod that I will be proud to say I built.,1357344000,,162,3.9393939393939394
8239183,5,B0010XLVQI,It provides an easy to understand approach to building a fly rod and by using the video you can easily review the different sections when needed.,1352851200,,145,4.615384615384615
