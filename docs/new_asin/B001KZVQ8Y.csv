8316779,5,B001KZVQ8Y,I have 87 iroc tumport camaro 6 speed manual this DVD tells you all how to fix it and make it run faster,1408752000,,104,3.5652173913043477
8316780,2,B001KZVQ8Y,"This product looks just like the DVD's of the History Channel's ""Automobiles"" series. It is not! This was part of a reality show series in which two ""teams"" of people would modify an IROC-Z Camaro and drag race them head-to-head.

Frankly, I thought it was boring. Neither team really impressed me and just added bolt-on equipment onto the motor. There was nothing more sophisticated than that. I was very disappointed. It definitely wasn't worth the money and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone wanting to learn more about the IROC-Z Camaros that Chevrolet built in the 1980s.

Not worth the money. Two stars.",1380672000,,609,4.902912621359223
8316781,3,B001KZVQ8Y,Watch a couple of twin youngsters (that may not have been around when these cars were new) captain two teams as the throw on some bolt-ons and drag race. They also give some video with a little history (and a little of it incorrect) on the vehicles as the teams are working on the cars.,1364860800,,286,4.218181818181818
8316782,4,B001KZVQ8Y,"If you are a fan of the Third Gen F-Bodies, this is a good watch.  It matches up two teams to install power adders to each car and then drag race them.  The winner gets to keep both cars. There is nothing like an American V8 Muscle car.",1252800000,3,236,3.8958333333333335
