7928513,5,B00004ZER3,"this was a great period in American music with both The Fabulous Thunderbirds and Stevie Ray Vaughan  putting out heavy duty rock and blues recordings and touring non-stop. I saw SRV in 1983 when he was just getting national acclaim then saw The Fab T-birds with original bassist Keith Ferguson not long after that solely because I'd read that Jimmie Vaughan was Stevie's older brother. I'm so glad I read that article. The FabT's hadn't hit it big yet with Tuff Enuff and were playing stuff from their prior recordings only. What a vibe they created in the club that night. You couldn't hear shuffles,slow blues,or 50's rock inspired tunes played any better anywhere else on the planet...well,unless SRV and DT were playing somewhere the same night...but you get my point.

This DVD will put you right back into a time when Texas blues was on the pop charts and music still had soul. The groove these guys lay down from the 1st note is heavier than anything out there today. It's real for one thing,not pretend BS.I wish those days had had a longer run. When Stevie departed,he took a very large chunk of music with him besides his own. Texas blues and alot of the music hanging on SRV's coat-tails went by the wayside in the mainstream. This Fab T's concert still holds up,20 years after it was filmed. Why? Because electric blues and r&b flavored rock are timeless. The tunes here are infectious and most of all,fun to hear. You'll be yelling YEAH BABY! more than once as you watch this show. Pick it up while you can. One day it'll be OOP.",1136419200,2,1543,4.586956521739131
7928514,5,B00004ZER3,"After just recently getting into the whole Fabulous Thunderbirds scene I decided to pick up this DVD along with their ""Invitation Only"" DVD.  I absolutely love them both!

Although Invitation Only I'd say has slighly better video and audio (w/ DTS!!) this concert has Jimmy Vaughan (Stevie's brother) on lead guitar vs. Kid Ramos in Invitation Only.  Both DVD's are totally rocking with outstanding performances.  I recommend them both to any Fabulous Thunderbirds fan; or anyone who wants to hear one of the best blues bands available on DVD!",1109376000,3,543,5.067415730337078
7928515,4,B00004ZER3,"I just bought this DVD recently and I must confess was very sceptical before seeing it, based on what I think is a cheesy cover, and also some of the reviews saying the sound wasn't very good.
I'm delighted to say that I had no sound problems with my copy, and that I really enjoyed it. Good song selection, and it took me back to one of my favorite concerts. This concert was recorded in 1985 in England, and I saw them in '87 in Winnipeg, Mb. Canada.
If you are a fan of the Jimmie Vaughan era Thinderbirds, this is definelty something to check out. Kim and Jim at the top of thier game.",1069027200,6,589,4.130434782608695
7928516,5,B00004ZER3,"This DVD got me ready to see the group, although they were all different except for Kim.  Loved the DVD and the ""new"" group live too.  Kim has changed in looks, no hair, but any thing the T-Birds do is great.",1003190400,2,208,4.048780487804878
7928517,3,B00004ZER3,"Despite the fact that Preston Hubbard is not one of the original Thunderbirds, Keith Ferguson was the original bass player, the song line up and Hubbard's playing are very good. The only problem I found was with the actual recording, the musicians are responsible for making sure that the sound they are producing is nothing but the best. I am sure that the audience that attended this particular concert were blown away, just as I was when I caught the original Thunderbirds at the Club Lingerie in Los Angeles. Of course, the proficiency of the crew that backs the musicians will be reflected in the end product which is what everyone else who didn't catch the live show will end up seeing and hearing. The T-birds have always been good, unfortunately this recording leaves something to be desired.",997142400,3,800,4.804347826086956
