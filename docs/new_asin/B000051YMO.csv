1388003,5,B000051YMO,"It takes a lot to make me cry.  This was one of those films.  Paul Morrison is an outstanding writer.  You feel like you are there with Solomon & Gaenor.  You feel their pain.  You want Solomon to win out but you know it can only end one way.  With Nia Roberts as Gaenor and Ioan Gruffudd as Solomon.  Solomon is a change of pace for the Welsh actor after some of the other pieces he has done.  He is more than up to the task, learning Yiddish for this role.",978480000,8,458,3.956043956043956
1388004,5,B000051YMO,"Just as Romeo and Juliet had to live out their tragic love in the midst of  warring families,so too do Solomon and Gaenor in 1911 Wales. This is a true star-crossed-lovers film that finds it's main characters fighting against the most impossible odds. Gaenor is from a Protestant Welsh family,whose lives are being tossed about by the coal mine strikes. Solomon is a son of transplated Russian Jews who run a goods shop on the other side of the mountain. Solomon is a pacman,a door-to-door cloth seller, who, one day selling his wears, comes upon the lovely Gaenor(Nia Roberts).Solomon (Ionn Gruffudd) is weak-kneed at the sight of her,and Gaenor is as well captivated by him. Because Solomon is aware of prevailing anti-Jewish sentiment among some of the Welsh natives,he fabricates a new name,nationality,and family history in order to ,as he thinks,make the wooing of Gaenor easier. Well...that just doesn't happen!!!Watch the film and you'll see!

Ionn Gruffudd never ceases to amaze  with the depth of his acting. The suffering that Solomon undergoes could not have been acted better. Nia Roberts is thoroughly convincing as the very shy yet incredibly passionate Gaenor. The two stars are lovely to watch and are quite affecting.

Shot on location in Wales,this Oscar-nominated film is a real eyefull that grips the whole range of emotions.",1171584000,7,1346,5.1045454545454545
1388005,2,B000051YMO,"I was pretty shocked at the explicit sex scenes in this movie.  It is NOT the Romeo and Juliet story they portray on the back cover.  We never saw those two in their birthday suits! Romeo had much more integrity than the guy in this movie.  This guy is a very self centered young man and she is a fool.  They end up in the hay pretty fast and continue to go at it with out any getting to know each other.  Not that rollicking in the hay before marriage is good anytime.

I was pretty diappointed.",1146700800,12,496,4.061855670103093

1388007,5,B000051YMO,"Some people say that love is without reason. For Solomon, the young and gentle Jewish packman, and Gaenor, the tender and obedient daughter of a Welsh miner family, the fated attraction between them began with a glimpse, a few words, and a red dress, which he was up all night and made for her. Some people say that love is innocent. Concealing his identity, he loved her no matter what gap might be in between them. Discovering his true self, she loved him for who he is. Some people say that love is transcendent. Their relationship was inevitably secularized by their religions and origins. At the end love was fulfilled beyond everything but life itself couldn't.
This is a beautiful and tragic love story. But more than just a love story with romance and sentimentality, this film is an authentic portrayal of the cruel realities of barriers and bias between two families, or two cultures, so to speak. Ioan Gruffaudd and Nia Robert are excellent as Solomon and Gaenor. As much as Solomon's light personality and charming manner appeals Gaenor, Gaenor's womanhood and demureness attracts Solomon. He is deeply attached to Gaenor, while at the same time, he struggles to choose between his family and his love. This time ""Hornblower"" reveals his softer side and delivers the complexity of Solomon vividly. Nia Robert, with her fine artistry, brings unique strength to the character, which can be felt just from the expression of her eyes and her face. The music is beautiful. The camera depicts the story with simplicity and yet striking effectiveness.
While the story of Solomon and Gaenor is sad, the sadder lies in the fact that nobody but their own families, people who loved them, was to blame for the tragedy. Although one may find the time and location of the story - 1911 Wales - remote, the story itself is but familiar even in the modern times. If only there were more understanding and respect among people no matter what they believe in and where they come from!",1048723200,32,1978,4.803519061583578
1388008,5,B000051YMO,"I love this film mainly because there is absolutely no sentimentality.  It it very factual in its approach, and yet the angst is gut-wrenching, the scenery is incredible (the winter scenery was an amazingly good choice), and the warmth between Solomon and Gaenor is magic.
It seemed obvious to me that the fear that each of the two families had had grown out of lack of communication and understanding about each others background.
If I were looking for a moral to this tale, I'd say that it is that we need to learn to accept each other no matter what our background, and learn that love is something that transcends all and no laws or taboos should exclude those who are truly in love.",1030147200,17,687,4.540322580645161
1388009,4,B000051YMO,"Although a far cry from his ever so honorable Horatio Hornblower, Ioan Gruffudd does not disappoint in this film either. The actress playing Gaenor was superior also, I felt her heartbreak and sadness. The use of Welsh and Yiddish throughout this movie lent an authentic air that was much appreciated. I had originally seen this on vhs and have now purchased the dvd.  It is quite wonderful, am v. pleased with the quality.",1027468800,14,423,4.794520547945205
1388010,5,B000051YMO,"Although tragic and a real good story for a sobbing fest on a rainy day, this movie is absolutely beautiful in subject, passion, and the acting is out of this world. Highly reccommended.",1017100800,4,186,4.666666666666667
1388011,3,B000051YMO,"This is a love story set in Wales, England 1911.  A Jewish boy falls in love with a Welsh girl to the unrelenting disapproval of both their families.  The actors, particularly Gruffud, are fine in their roles, but the story is necessarily harsh in the end.  It's a very Romeo and Juliet sort of doomed romanticism.",1014768000,2,314,4.571428571428571
1388012,3,B000051YMO,"As a Hornblower fan for some time, I was curious to see how Ioan Gruffudd would do in other works so I bought this film. While his acting is commendable as Solomon, it's a shame the movie wasn't better. As hard as he tried, his performance was hampered by a tired plot and predictable writing. It is hard to feel anything regarding the Soloman and Gaenor relationship because it seems based entirely on sex. There needs to be ""moments"" where we see the true love between them. If they were there, I missed it. Because they weren't there, I could feel no sympathy to their delimma. Kudos to the actors protraying the two families. Unfortunately they were more three-dimensional than the two leads, and were the only reason I kept watching this film after the halfway point. Thumbs up for the performances of the actors who portrayed Gaenor's brother and Solomon's mother.
If you're a Gruffudd fan, you'll get this movie no matter what. If you're a movie fan, rent before you decide to buy.",1010188800,5,988,4.651428571428571
1388013,4,B000051YMO,"""Solomon and Gaenor"" attests to the universality of the theme of starcrossed lovers, rehashing the ""Romeo and Juliet"" story against the bleak backdrop of rural Wales in 1911.  Welsh heartthrob Ioan Gruffudd (""Horatio Hornblower"") is Solomon, a Jewish packman selling fabric door to door, and Nia Roberts is Gaenor, a Welsh chapel girl.  They meet, fall in love, and then society intercedes, tearing them apart.  Yes, we have heard this story before, but the film is imbued with a number of unique qualities that make it a worthwhile, if not completely original experience.
The acting, for one thing, is excellent.  Gruffudd nails the complex role of Solomon.  This one is more than just a pretty face, and he's got the acting chops to prove it, making Solomon a decidedly more complex and interesting character than any Romeo.  Although his angelic good looks and gentle demeanor beguile Gaenor, it becomes apparent that he is much more than that.  After their first tryst, Solomon realizes that he is not Gaenor's first lover, and becomes uncharacteristically angry, thus eschewing the typical sensitive-hero type, and creating what is ultimately a far more interesting character.
Nia Roberts is extremely adept at portraying Gaenor's progression from the obedient young daughter who dutifully attends chapel to a mature, strong woman who follows her heart instead.  The scene in chapel in which Gaenor is publically reprimanded for being pregnant out of wedlock (ah! a plot twist!) is particularly wrenching, and Roberts' face portrays a  fascinating mixture of anguish and fortitude.  It is difficult to imagine today the inner turmoil Gaenor had to deal with in deciding whether to stay with her family or go with Solomon, and face banishment from family and community alike.  She has more to lose, yet she still gives it all up for love.
The plot doesn't need summarization, although it doesn't follow the ""Romeo and Juliet"" story completely.  The few twists are a refreshing change from what would have been a fairly standard story about unrequited love.
The movie is also notable for its usage of English, Welsh, and Yiddish, providing the actors with quite a feat of linguistics.  Incidentally, a Welsh-language version was filmed simultaneously with the English version.",1008633600,17,2279,5.177111716621253
1388014,4,B000051YMO,"This was a startlingly good film.  The story definitely lingers long after the last shot, and the chemistry between Nia Roberts and Ioan Gruffudd was very poignant.  Highly recommended...",1003881600,4,187,5.413793103448276
1388015,4,B000051YMO,"As a Jew I can vouch for the detailed and correct depiction of a Jewish Family in the beginning of the twentyfirst century. Wonderful research!!!
The story is so beautiful and timeless,that i had to watch it over and over.
However I think the ending is so incredibly horrid that it might haunt the viewer for a long time.",1003881600,6,321,4.4576271186440675
1388016,5,B000051YMO,"The story of ""Solomon & Gaenor"" revolves around a lower middle class area of Wales in 1911. World War I is merely three years away. Jews are barely tolerated by the marginally educated indigenous Protestant majority. The traditional Jewish values of hard work and intense love of learning increases their odds of upward mobility. This inevitably increases the bitterness and envy of the less than friendly fellow townspeople. Solomon (Ioan Gruffund) goes house to house selling fabric to the women folk. Eventually the young Semitic male knocks on the door of a miner family. Their daughter Gaenor (Nia Roberts) answers, and the couple are soon attracted to each other.
Solomon knows that his Jewishness will be held against him. He therefore lies to Gaenor and tells her that his name is Sam. The mild deception works, and soon the two are lovers. They begin to make plans for the future, but Gaenor senses something is wrong because ""Sam"" is reluctant to meet her family. Solomon is only too aware that neither the Jewish and Protestant cultures are inclined toward blessing their union. He eventually visits Gaenor's home, and is at least grudgingly accepted by her parents. Her brother is intimidated by ""Sam's"" ability to read and write. Furthermore, the blue color worker is not thrilled that his sister's beau does not earn his living in an allegedly more masculine manner. Alas, the couple's erotic romps in the hay ultimately culminates in Gaenor's pregnancy. This is where the situation gets out of control. Gaenor is with child without the benefit of marriage during a time when illegitimacy is severely condemned. Public humiliation is only part of the price to be paid for such non sanctioned physical coupling. The truth about Solomon's actual ethnic heritage is finally discovered. Also, the Jewish social leaders and Solomon's immediate family reject the very idea of his marrying a goy female. Solomon is even threatened with being ostracized from his roots. Everything further deteriorates and the story ends tragically.
One wonders how much has changed in 90 years. Are mixed marriages more accepted today in Wales? Was there ever a chance that the lovers could have found a more receptive secular sub-culture that would have embraced them as a couple? I'm glad the film's creators frankly confronted the bigotry on both sides of the ethnic chasm. The courage not to write in a happy ending must also be applauded. This is indeed not ""Fiddler on the Roof!"" It almost certainly cost them some ticket sales. ""Solomon & Gaenor"" is instead a beautiful work of art. I strongly urge you to see this movie, and allow it to challenge your possible hidden prejudices.",999993600,29,2677,5.004484304932736
1388017,4,B000051YMO,"The anticipation was absolutely killing me, so when I finally was able to purchase Solomon and Gaenor (for less than ...) I popped it in immediately.  I'm a HUGE fan of Ioan Gruffudd and will go out of my way to see anything he's in.  No matter what he's in I love it for the simple fact that he's starring in it.  Solomon and Gaenor is likely the only exception to this rule.  In fact, the film's only saving grace may very well be Ioan's performance. It's not a bad movie, but is very predictable and terribly depressing.  Gaenor seemed very weak-sister to me and lacked the fire that a title character should have.  Solomon was a little better but still very, what's the word, whiny.  It truly breaks my heart to say bad things about one of Mr. Gruffudd's films, but this is absolutely not Horatio Hornblower.  And if you go into this film expecting just that, you will be sorely disappointed.  All in all, two stars for content is the best I can do for the film as a whole, but Ioan Gruffudd brings it up to four stars all together.  You MUST be a hardcore Ioan Gruffudd fan to appreciate this film.",998524800,4,1103,4.336585365853659
1388018,5,B000051YMO,"This was a great film in two ways: first, the love story itself was beautiful and captivating--though certainly for mature audiences; and second, it was a great study of human nature.  Both the Jews and the Christians could see the shortcomings in each other but failed to recognize the same behaviors in themselves.
Both actors did a great job of conveying the internal struggle they waged--their intense need for each other competing with their very real need for their familiy's approval and acceptance.  It's easy to say what they should have done, but Wales in 1911 was a very different world.  How many of us could face complete ostracization from all we know without hesitation?",992217600,3,685,4.939130434782609

His acting is wonderful and sensitive.  This movie was romantic and of course sad, every great romance has sad parts.  Also, I am confused by what ... is interpreting as having sex at every possible moment.  There were only two scenes and wonderfully done.  Thumbs up for this movie, it is a great movie.

Set against the scenicbackdrop of the South Wales coal mining valleys in 1911, ""Solomonand Gaenor"" tells the tragic yet heartwarming story of a Jewishboy and miner's daughter.  Wonderful acting with fantasticperformances turned in by Ioan Gruffudd and Nia Roberts. For lack of abetter way to phrase it, this is a movie that gets you right in thegut. It had me in tears.

This movie was really good, the ending was sad but it definitely held your attention, not boring at all.  I know some reviews of it are scathing about the character he portrays and his lack of propriety with the girl Gaenor that he is attracted to.  But the way I see it is, it's a love story..... Solomon is so attracted to Gaenor and falls in love with her that he just isn't thinking about the repercussions of his actions.... when your young, that's just the way it is.
