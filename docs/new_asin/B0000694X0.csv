8482264,2,B0000694X0,"While you will experience stunning geographic photography, this DVD has little value. There are no captions identifying the buildings, landmarks, historic sites, or gardens, and this DVD is really just a photo travelog of unidentified locations accompanied by music of Tchaikovsky.  There are no tracks dividing the works into movements so once you start, you're stuck with the entire piece. The failure to identify the places photographed limits the usefulness of this DVD.",1206576000,,474,5.493150684931507
