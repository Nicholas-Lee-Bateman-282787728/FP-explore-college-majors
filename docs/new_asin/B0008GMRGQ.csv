8056256,5,B0008GMRGQ,Great old movie of Buck Jones and the Rough Riders.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in old-time movies.,1388620800,,127,4.7727272727272725
8056257,4,B0008GMRGQ,"Another outstanding ROUGH RIDERS adventure as our heroes avenge the murder of marshal Gordon and recover the stolen Garcia jewels while redeeming bad guy Dennis Moore. Buck Jones, Tim McCoy and Raymond Hatton shine as usual as U.S. MARSHALS, Buck Roberts, Tim McCall and Sandy Hopkins. They drift into town alone as strangers, interact on the sly with one another, then come together to close the net on the bad guys in the final reel. This is the set-up for all entries in this outstanding series, and BELOW THE BORDER is one of their best, with supporting help from a fine cast of outlaws including Roy Barcroft (boss heavy), Charlie King, Bud Osborn and Kermit Maynard. Jack Rockwell plays his sheriff routine down pat.

I played the ALPHA dvd on my pc and it appeared somewhat soft, but when I minimized the image it really looked pretty good with good contrast. Not too many splices and/or glitches, which is good. I can recommend this version to fans. The price is right and the entertainment value here can't be beat, even by the ROUGH RIDERS!!!",1320278400,,1052,4.717391304347826
8056258,3,B0008GMRGQ,"Below the Border, 1942 film

The film begins with a stagecoach drawn by four horses going through the hills. There is danger in this country. The Sheriff tacks Wanted posters in the stores. Five robbers chase the stagecoach, firing many shots until the guard and driver are shot. Is the stranger a coward? There is drama in the tavern. A cattle buyer from Kansas watches a man mop the floor. The Sheriff sends out men to trail the robbers. Is it healthy to have too good a memory there? Did someone tip off the robbers that valuable jewels were carried by Miss Garcia? We learn the robbers work for Scully, the tavern owner. We learn who is their contact at the Garcia ranch. ""The Rough Riders"" begin their undercover investigation.

""John Robbins"" has a reputation. ""Don't tax your brain."" ""Robbins"" can fence those stolen jewels. McCall looks at cattle at the Garcia ranch. Joe Collins is on edge; somebody shoots him. He tells McCall that Slade killed Marshal Gordon. The robbers steal cattle from the Porter ranch. The Sheriff rounds up the boys to chase the rustlers. But Slade knew the real Robbins and knows this one is an imposter! The gang has to work fast. Slade snoops around the Sheriff's office. Buck Roberts chews gum, then meets Slade for a confrontation. There will be no more trouble from Slade. Tim trails the gang to their hideout. They pursue the gang, firing shots. Buck captures Scully and recovers the jewels. Tim and Sandy capture the rest of the gang. There is a happy ending. ""The Rough Riders"" will separate to their home states and their personal business. Until they ride again.

This is another classic western that is part morality play and a detective story. A ranch owner is threatened by robbers and rustlers. Acquiring property has its costs. The tavern owner is the secret mastermind of the robber gang (a possible legacy of Prohibition?).",1277078400,2,1875,4.763076923076923
8056259,5,B0008GMRGQ,I have all the Rough Riders movies and find them a pleasure to watch and they hold pride of place in my dvd cabinet,1261872000,,115,3.8333333333333335
8056260,4,B0008GMRGQ,"THe ""3 Mesquiteers"" were one of the most prolific ""B"" western trios, and the group was made up of a rather large group of interchangeable actors throughout the 1930's & 1940's ( e.g. * John Wayne, Robert Livingston, Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan, Max Terhune, Duncan Renaldo, and Bob Steele to name a few). But, though they had a long run of success, they most always came off a little too ""slick"" and boring to watch at times. Other trios came and went, but none ever reached the pinnacle that the Mesquiteers did. ~ Unfortunately, my favorite trio came and went way too soon. Or, was that too late?! This trio was nearing the ends of their ""B"" western days as the entire ""B"" industry was beginning to fade. Though there was a plethora of single saddle pals throughout the 1940's and on into the early 1950's ( e.g. - Don ""Red"" Barry, Ken Maynard, the great Charles Starrett as the ""Durango Kid"", ""Hoot"" Gibson, Alan ""Rocky"" Lane, Rex Allen, Johnny Mack Brown, ""Whip"" Wilson, Tex Ritter, the fascinating ""Lash"" Larue, the fine entertainer and son-of-the west, ""Sunset"" Carson ( way up at the top of my favorite list, though his career of making quality, westerns faded after he and Republic Pictures split over contract differences ), the rugged and durable super western star, Randolph Scott, Hopalong Cassidy - ( Of course!!! ),and other solid and popular ""B""-men. *** But,to me, from the time I saw my first grainy, flawed ""B"" western on our old b&w RCA excuse for a television, my all-time FAVORITE good-guy-cowpoke has always been the rugged, hoss-ridin'est, jaw-bustinest, gal-lovin'est, often humorous Buck Jones. I loved him as a solitary hero chasin' down the owlhoots or together with his 2 fellow ""Rough Riders"" near the end of his career ( He died in a horrible fire which broke loose in the plush Coconut Grove Bar, Lounge, and Restaurant in Boston, Massachusetts in the early 1940's,not long after he had finished his 9th ""Rough Riders"" ""B"" western. Buck Jones, the veteran star Tim McCoy, and the uniquely-funny and unusual Raymond Hatton filmed those 9 ""Rough Riders"" flicks and, God willing, might've gone on to do a few more . My goodness, how I wished that they had made 15-20 more sequels. In my eyes, the 3 ""Rough Riders"" were overall the best trio of all ""B"" westerndom. The chemistry between the group members was unique and a solid bond was evident between all 3. The cinematic quality of the pictures is not always as good as as the level of quality in  other ""B's"", but from the rousing theme song at the beginning of each movie, the ""I've got your back!"" loyalty between all 3, the action-packed scenes, and solid story lines will make you a real fan of the ""Riders"", especially if you are pretty much a diehard devotee of ""B"" westerns already. *** So, what's my bottom line to all of you junior ""Rough Riders""? #1: Buck Jones was the greatest epitome of what the sturdy, hard-ridin'est ( Check him out when he and his horse, Silver, fly across the dusty trails and come to a flashy stop in front of the old ranch-house.), gum-chewin'est, square-jawedest, 10-gallon hat wearin'est celluloid hero the ""B's"" ever produced! If ever there was ever an old-fashioned romantic cowboy hero, then Buck proves it time after time, blowing through all his flicks, a man on a quest for justice! #2: You'll find no band of sidekicks any more suited to each other than Buck, Tim, & Raymond. Such fun, yet such slam-bang, wham-bam climaxes. #3: You won't hear a more exciting and well-sung opening song in any other ""B"" tune. ~  ~ Post: For all my growing years and adult-'til-now life, I have often let my mind wander off to recall a number of the old films I've referred to above. Never, in my strongest imagination, did I ever dream that a time would come when I might have the opportunity to have a ""B"" library of my own, movies which I can watch at my leisure, just any old time I want. And, for such affordable, ridiculously-cheap prices. *** AMAZON.com has made my wildest dreams come true. Beautifully-artistic DVD covers evoke childhood memories, and once again Buck Jones repeatedly gallops onto my 46"" LCD-TV screen with Tim MCcOy and Raymond Hatton right behind. :) REMINDER: Amazon.com offers many ""B"" star films,but the ROCK of the range, Buck Jones, somehow, makes most of the other cowboy heroes of the past seem like ""Coca~Cola Cowboys"")! >>>>> Now, check out The ""Rough Riders"" DVD's! There are 3 in all, including all 9 movies made by the ""Rough Riders"". You can buy them all for less than a $20 dollar bill, all 9 movies that the super trio ever made. Go ahead on!
