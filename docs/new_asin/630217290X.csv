7822959,5,630217290X,"The Live Ghost finds the boys on a ghost ship. The action really starts when they (mistakenly) believe that they accidently
killed one of the crew.

In Dirty Work the boys are hired to clean a chimny. This one has some great gags in it. Including Stan brutally murdering a clock
with a shovel. The rest of the house, and Ollie don`t fare too much better.

Oliver The Eighth finds Ollie involved with a crazy woman who kills men named Oliver. He is to be her 8th victim. But don`t worry,
he has Stan to protect him.

The Laurel & Hardy Murder Case is one of their weakest films. But even this one has some good laughs in it.",1261872000,,623,4.218487394957983

In DIRTY WORK, they're chimney sweeps who manage to destroy a professor's living room.

In THE LAUREL-HARDY MURDER CASE, Stan's deceased uncle leaves him a huge estate. When the boys arrive for the will reading, they learn that Stan is a prime suspect in the old man's mysterious demise.

THE LIVE GHOST is a seafaring yarn of a hijacked crew on a haunted ship piloted by a captain willing to  do bodily harm to the first man who says the word ""ghost."" A drunken swab falls into a vat of whitewash, causing Stan & Ollie to shout out the ""magic"" word.

OLIVER THE EIGHTH is the unsuspecting Ollie, who answers a personal ad placed by a rich but crazy widow with a penchant for bumping off husbands named ""Oliver.""

BONUS: Home movie footage and photos of the boys at work and play, collected and narrated by Stan's daughter, Lois Laurel. (Note: this material is primarily Stan's amateur films of a kids' birthday party and such.)
