the movie itself.",1504051200,,156,3.90625

7822882,5,6302195160,"The guys drive the plot in this one, the girl is just along for the ride.  However without her you would have forgotten Delusion a long time ago. WONDERFUL desert a la Zabriskie Point or Bert Stern.  A couple of seasoned actors are great as secondary characters - mafia boss & marked man.  One of hundreds of road movies, but better than most of them.",1138665600,2,351,4.369230769230769
7822883,4,6302195160,"Awash in the sea of neo-noirs that have surfaced since 1980's Body Heat, Delusion manages to stand out by dint of its slick, edgy hipness, both in acting and script.  Carl Copaert's direction is a perfect complement to the script co-written by him and Kurt Voss, writer of another overlooked, edgy 90s neo-noir, Genuine Risk.
Jim Metzler is George O'Brien, a corporate guy fed up with his boss' stupidity and greed who, because of that, embezzles from his company a nice stash of cash and hightails it from L.A. luxe to barren desert roads.  In so doing he finds Patty and Chevy (Jennifer Rubin and Kyle Secor--he of later Homicide fame), a wacked odd young couple who pretend auto hardship to get a lift from George.
Unfortunately they're not telling the truth.  Chevy is, shall we say, unstable.  And Patty?  Hard to say.  Rubin makes her a great, sexy femme fatale.  The question is, is she REALLY a femme fatale?  Or isn't she?  Actually, it's Chevy's instability that drives this baby, just like it drives George to do things which, as a conservative business guy, he normally would not do.  But of course he's ALREADY done something off the beaten track, stealing the dough.  This is a great noir road movie that updates a buncha earlier flicks.
It's given further oomph when Chevy directs George to his pal Larry, Jerry Ohrbach, who Chevy needs to see about some stuff.  This is the capper for Chevy's instability--hey, I'm not gonna give anything away here.  Check it out yourself, it's worth it.
Patty and Chevy are not always, let's say, compatible.  George and Chevy?  Same thing.  This is a flick that does what it's supposed to do and does a great job, too.  You like noir?
Here's a perfect 90s slice of it, pardner.  Grab it.",1076889600,8,1739,4.6644736842105265
7822884,5,6302195160,"Delusion is an offbeat, utterly fascinating character study, involving a yuppy-ish computer investor (George O'Brien) who, in the process of taking embezzled cash from L.A. to Reno, picks up a luckless pair of hitchhikers near Death Valley. Against a spectacular landscape that is both serene and strangely eerie, the viewer gets to know the strange couple -- Patty, part-hooker, part-Vegas showgirl, and Chevy, her cruel, psychotic, and curiously dependent boyfriend.
There is more to this movie than just a believable and captivating plot. The dialogue, the acting, soundtrack, props, the interaction between characters -- even the timing and camera work -- are done to complete perfection. The complex personalities of these two misfits, at once threatening and pathetic, unravel on film against a backdrop that gives the film a truly spellbinding atmosphere.
Delusion is a masterpiece that explores the contradictions of human behavior in a way that almost defies comparison. It is full of subtle irony and metaphor, and it builds to a conclusion that is more dramatic than climactic, more satifying than exciting. It is one of a kind, and in my opinion, the greatest film ever made.",1008374400,4,1187,5.285714285714286
