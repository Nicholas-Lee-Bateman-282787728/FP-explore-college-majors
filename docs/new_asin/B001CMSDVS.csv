3514282,5,B001CMSDVS,I used to listen to him on the radio on the way home from work. I had some tapes he had done many years ago and wanted to replace them.

3514297,5,B001CMSDVS,"""Over the course of 60 years, Pastor Chuck has consistently and joyously taught through the 66 books of the Bible, line upon line, precept upon precept, giving millions of people insight and inspiration for God's Word.  During this time, Pastor Chuck has delivered engaging sermons based upon each book and chapter of the Bible.  On one hand, Pastor Chuck exposits the text of the Bible, going line upon line through the entire Scripture, from Genesis to Revelation.  On the other hand, he expounds an idea or principle taken from the text of each chapter he is teaching from in the form of a Sunday morning sermon.  What is collected in this T-3000 audio series represents his exposition upon the Scriptures in the form of Sunday morning messages, gathered between the years 1985-1999.""  Absolutely love Pastor Chuck's Bible teachings.  They've helped me grow in my walk with Jesus these past 40 years.",1389225600,2,903,4.947019867549669
3514298,5,B001CMSDVS,"I am very grateful that Pastor Chuck Smith released his through the Bible teaching from Genesis to Revelation in this C-3000 Series.

I have already gone through Pastor Chuck Smith's C-2000 Series from Genesis to Revelation and I am now going though this newer C-3000 Bible study series with Pastor Chuck Smith.

I highly recommend this to all Bible believing Catholics & Christians who want to study the Holy Bible from beginning to end.

As far as I know, Pastor Chuck Smith of Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa is the only Christian Pastor who has ever released Bible study MP3s that take you from the beginning of the Holy Bible, all the way to the very end of the Holy Bible. And at such a great price too.

God Bless Pastor Chuck Smith on his recent promotion to The Home Office of our Lord & Savior Jesus Christ.

It was recently posted on Pastor Chuck Smith dot com, that Pastor Chuck once said, ""Someday you may read in the newspaper that Chuck Smith has died. Don't you believe it! Accurate reporting would say, Chuck Smith has moved!""",1382313600,23,1037,4.553763440860215
3514299,5,B001CMSDVS,"Pastor Chuck is an inspiration, I have loved his teaching for over thirty years.

Thank you very much, prayers to you Pastor Chuck.

3514300,5,B001CMSDVS,"Solid teaching and good to listen to....I was on of the privileged few that was there from the beginning, so for me this series is nice to remember the early days of Calvary",1378771200,3,173,4.2727272727272725
3514301,5,B001CMSDVS,"I was using the C2000 series on twft.com/?page=C2000  for the last year or so... that website went down and my dad mentioned that there was a new one (C3000) that was available, and although I couldn't find it online for free, I found it here. It kind of surprises me that it's up here for sale. I'm not sure if Chuck knows that it's being sold for $20, he always has given the impression that teachings should be free and open for everyone.  Sure, it helps cover the cost of putting it all together; but that's what tithe is for.

Anyway, Chuck is a great teacher, his voice is excellent to listen to.

I started this series in the new testament - I'm in Romans now. Solid, solid teaching.",1370822400,8,690,4.325581395348837
3514302,5,B001CMSDVS,The CDs arrived quickly to my PO Box. The mp3 audio files were of good sound quality and formatted for easy installation onto my IPod.,1355443200,13,134,4.4
3514303,5,B001CMSDVS,"I have been a Christian since October, 1980. Newly born-again, I got a new job, too: copier repairman, with a large territory, and lots of time to listen to radio in the car while travelling between broken copiers.

I found Pastor Chuck's radio program, ""The Word For Today"", among many others on the local Christian radio station. He shined above them all. I listened every chance I got, and bought tapes so that I could listen more.

32 years later, I am still listening. I have the whole bible study on an MP3 player that I listen to while I go about my work. I get more out of the same lessons with each hearing. How is this possible? I don't know. Either I'm dumb, or the Holy Spirit is producing a greater work. Probably both.

But I do know this: you will not be sorry if you buy this. Rather, you will be mightily blessed.

Why am I writing this review? Because 800 miles from me, I have a best friend from childhood that I am trying to reach with the gospel of Christ. I was trying to find free downloads of Pastor Chuck's bible study for him, because though he is rich, he is cheap. (A miser.) But I couldn't. Instead, I found this. I hope to encourage him to buy it and listen. I encourage you as well.",1325635200,6,1213,4.238095238095238

It contains over 10 years worth of weekly messages on the entire Bible. He is thorough, entertaining and really knows his stuff. You really can't go wrong with this product. It will be a blessing to you.",1276992000,35,359,4.538461538461538
3514305,5,B001CMSDVS,"Through the Bible's content is excellent, taking into account the variety of opinions concerning the interpretation of scripture. Pastor Smith's teachings  broaden knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, bible times (specifically culture, traditions, and rationales behind perspectives of that time), and biblical viewpoints. Using scriptures and events, Pastor Smith illustrates how we relate and should relate to God and to our environment. His approach overreaches traditional teachings, as he explains the intentional complexity and simplicity of various aspects of life  and how this is part of God's plan of life and part of God's Plan of Redemption for man. Although several verses were not covered, Pastor Smith illuminated the Gospel.

Note: I had to use a computer with a DVD player to access the files and it took some time to read each disc. Once it worked, I immediately saved the files.",1247529600,3,894,5.326241134751773
3514306,5,B001CMSDVS,"Excellent series, I have listened to Pastor Chuck for years. His first offerings were on cassette tapes and i wore them out listening to them.

3514307,5,B001CMSDVS,"This set contains two double-sided DVD discs, not video footage, but MP3 audio files of Pastor Chuck Smith teaching through the entire Bible in over 700 messages!  These are his topical sermons teaching through the entire Bible between the years of 1985 and 1999.  Honestly, this is an amazing deal for what you get!  In order to get these to work on your computer you must have a DVD-ROM (able to play DVDs on your computer).  These will not work in most DVD players that are used on TV sets.  Just be sure your computer has the capabilities to play DVD discs.  Then you just pop in the disc and extract the files onto your computer.",1237939200,4,634,4.422413793103448

8288222,2,B001CMSDVS,"I love Chuck Smith and his teaching and miss him but this is outdated media that you will need a CD player to hear. MP3 audio files and not the verse by verse version I was expecting. You still can't go wrong with the content if you have a way to play it. Digital download or Podcast would be a better way to hear this content so for that reason alone... not for the message content, it get's 2 stars.",1520294400,,401,4.025

8288226,5,B001CMSDVS,"Great way to increase knowledge of Gods word with an in-depth study at your own pace. I went through the Bible Study the first time using the 2000 series study on line. This C3000 CD version works fine, anytime you want to stop the study just record the time at the bottom of the screen and shut down. On the bottom of the screen you will see the total time of the CD, if you click near that total time, the actual running time will appear which you will need when you pause or stop the study.
I attended Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa California for 36 years and was in the church to hear this entire study taught by Chuck Smith as he continually went through the Bible over and over once he reached Revelation. I enjoy hearing his voice again and his great humor which was part of his teaching.",1480896000,,791,4.245033112582782
