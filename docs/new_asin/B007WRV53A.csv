About details of Miku Hatsune and the band, please refer to the reviews on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miku-Hatsune-Blu-ray-MIKUNOPOLIS-in-LOS-ANGELES-Hajimemashite-Hatsune-Miku-desu-Japan-Import/dp/B006NZL4FQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miku Hatsune/Blu-ray MIKUNOPOLIS in LOS ANGELES -Hajimemashite Hatsune Miku desu- [Japan Import</a>].

This time, they performed 30 tunes and duration is nearly 2 hours. No bonus track, but it's enough. Different angles are available on a few tracks. Additional commentary is subtitled and that is only in Japanese. No audio commentary. I recommend you to write SEGA a request of releasing US version of this disc with English subtitles. I believe it's worth to do. Price is high (price is approx. $80 in Japan and street price is a bit lower).

My conclusion is the same as on my previous review: the concert still is the showcase of the pop music what we love to listen to. Atmosphere is more ""concert"" than ""festival"", not fanatic like in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hatsune-Miku-Miku-No-Hi-Kansyasai-39-s-Giving-Day-Blu-ray-Limited-Edition/dp/B003S9U5CS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hatsune Miku - Miku No Hi Kansyasai 39's Giving Day (Blu-ray) [Limited Edition</a>]. I prefer the older one for the atmosphere but I'm also sure that the older one is not for everyone.

This time the performance of the band (incl. wind section) sounded on my ear like a sophisticated versions of mid '80's - early '90's Japanese pop music. I'm very happy to know that a tradition of Japanese pop is still in a good shape.
Mixdown seemed to be optimized for 5.1-channel. Conventional 2-track mix sounded ""lighter"" than that of Mikunopolis disc. It doesn't matter for those who installed a home-theater system, but it does matter for me since I usually listen to Blu-ray contents with my iPod (in AIFF, no mp3 compression, of course).",1346630400,5,2424,6.710191082802548
