5726143,5,B00CLH0DZW,want a good movie with twists and turns and gives you a good laugh.  we really enjoyed it.  cute story.,1407369600,,103,4.1
5726144,5,B00CLH0DZW,"Bought as a gift,saw this movie a long time ago and it is very funny movie I've watched it several times",1403395200,,104,4.0
5726145,5,B00CLH0DZW,"Ellen Barkin deserved an Oscar for her performance.  In a unique comedic storyline, centered around the seriously deep eternal mysteries of life good / evil, right / wrong, death / afterlife, heaven / hell, she is 100% believable as a ""bad boy"" resurrected-reincarnated in a ""hot chick's"" skin.
Blake Edwards masterfully got around the likelihood of HER stepping into HIS former life by tackling the whole power/money/gender conundrums in our society what a man can do/get away with vs. what a woman can do/get away with, hetero / homo sexual issues, business people (male/female) at their utmost ruthlessness (and depraved) and other anomalies.
All the Supporting Cast (and they are just that) do a great job with a notable superbly hilarious performance from JoBeth Williams as one of his/her nervous murderous ex's.
But like Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct, this is Ellen Barkins film and she very ably carries it from start to finish with her incredibly outstanding portrayal.
I loved the movie and would recommend it to anyone (parental discretion advised).",1392595200,2,1061,5.1686046511627906

5726147,5,B00CLH0DZW,"Switch is a great lesson in understanding the joys of being a male and female. all learned by a former MCP  when he is murdered and reincarnates as a woman.
The choices given my Diety  and the temptations of a Devil are all played out. a wonderful video and a training film for those who are trying to understand Soul evolution and karma.
Highly enjoyable, incredibly on-target and very insightful !  You will totally enjoy !",1382572800,2,425,4.565789473684211

5726158,4,B00CLH0DZW,It's about  a man. Who is a womanizer who chases  women. Who he believes that he can do anything to woman. in a twist of fate. Several of them joined forces to teach him a lession. By fate had other plans. In the moments of death. He was between heaven and hell. He wasn't the nice guy to women . But he wasn't worst either too. Too get into heaven he needed to find one woman that like him. Which was a hard problem. But the other side thought. The task was easy for him . To  teach him a lession he'll needed to know what is like to be the  one being chase so he'll return to earth a girl. This while pretending his sister. And want to find that to woman that likes him. As a person. And finds that is not as easy being a woman. While the same problems as before.,1455667200,,765,3.9161290322580644

8583093,1,B00CLH0DZW,"I thought I was getting the original movie based on the fact I was buying it new.  A factory sealed product.  However, it is dvd-r but it plays. Yet, I wanted the real dvd not a ripped/bootleg copy.  It should have been in the description section.",1524614400,,247,4.326086956521739
8583094,5,B00CLH0DZW,"This one of two favorite movies. It is basically a rewrite of the movie ""Goodbye Charlie!"" They are written different enough that I have both (the premise is the same/)  Switch is a Blake Edwards rom-com that was originally shown HBO in the early 1990's. I enjoy this movie enough, that I have seen it more times than I care to admit.",1522713600,2,334,4.387096774193548

8583100,3,B00CLH0DZW,"I don't know why Tea Leoni is listed first in Amazon's credits.  Ellen Barkin is the female lead and Tea has a very minor role and, if memory serves is listed last in the movie's credits.  The movie's okay; just don't expect much Leoni screen time.  The original version, Goodbye Charlie, is better.",1513382400,,299,4.60377358490566
