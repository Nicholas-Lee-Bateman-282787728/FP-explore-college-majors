3423862,4,B00197YZCW,A film that shows the best and worst of the human animal. Gillian Anderson and her co stars all show excellent performances. This film is very creative and should be enjoyable to audiences of any age.,1238889600,,200,4.583333333333333
3423863,4,B00197YZCW,"Don't expect a Disney style cute story in this movie.  I'd say that it depicts life in Donal's part of Ireland so realistically that one could think they were watching filmed every-day life there.  By this, I mean that there are very few typical film tricks to evoke emotion or to carry the story.  The only one I noticed was at the end when the animal control people were confiscating the dogs from the evil trainer.  There are actually two stories here; one is Donal's relationship with the dog trainer, and the other is with the man who comes into his life, one who carries a long-held secret.  Both stories are interwoven seamlessly into a very satisfying whole.

I do have a couple of caveats, however.  The first is that young Donal, about 13 or 14 years old, is shown smoking over and over again.  Even when the stranger says it is bad for him, Donal defends it.  I don't recall any bad language, once again proving that evil people and 'low class' people can be shown realistically in movies without constant swearing.  The second warning to families with young children is that some dogs are being shown (apparently) drowned in a quarry, and the dog trainer slashes the throat of Donal's assigned dog, one that he trained for racing.

Both my wife and I found this movie to be very realistic and it certainly did not lag in any way.  I would give it five stars if it weren't for the smoking by a young teen boy.  Also, it is graded down a bit because there is not closed captioning, and we simply could not figure out what some (especially the dog trainer) were saying because it the strong Irish dialect of English.  All in all, it is an excellent movie about a boy, a dog, and of both betrayal and creating new family ties.",1233792000,12,1734,4.44620253164557
3423864,3,B00197YZCW,"The Mighty Celt (Pearse Elliott, 2005)

Not a bad little film, this. When I read the description, I figured I was in for a Disney-esque light-hearted family tale about a dog winning against all odds, but that's certainly not what I got. It also listed the top stars as Tyrone McKenna and Ken Stott, so I was quite surprised when Gillian Anderson and Robert Carlyle popped up, as well. Surprises in casting are usually a good thing.

Yes, there's a dog, and there's racing, and all that sort of thing, but a lighthearted family tale this is not. Good Joe (Stott, who's been making a name for himself recently as the title character in Rebus) runs a kennel for racing greyhounds. The tone of the movie is set in the opening scene, when we see him at a quarry tossing in a vaguely bloody and dog-shaped burlap sack. This is not a Disney film, by any means. Donal (McKenna, in his first screen role) is Joe's helper around the stables, and he gets attached to one of the dogs, whom he names The Mighty Celt. The dog trains well in the mornings, but in his first race, he finishes dead last. Donal saves the dog from disaster by making a deal with Joe: he'll train the dog and run him in his (Donal's) own name, and after three races, if the dog's become a winner, Joe will let Donal keep the dog. Cue miracle. Of course, that's not all; it seems any movie made in Ireland in the past thirty years must have a subplot regarding the Troubles (as any movie in America since 25th Hour must say something about 9/11), and that comes with the friction between Good Joe and Donal's uncle O (Carlyle, in a rare impressive performance), the latter of whom is tentatively romancing his ex-girlfriend and brother's widow, Kate (Anderson, in a not-at-all-rare impressive performance).

It's not a great film, by any means-- the IRA plot sort of wanders off into the distance, never to be seen again, for one thing-- but it's emotionally honest, which is one thing that vast numbers of American movies involving children and their attachments to animals are not. That alone makes it worthy viewing for an American audience that's been weaned on such pap as The Incredible Journey and My Friend Flicka. McKenna does a creditable enough job with the role, and the actors around him are quite good; the script's few problems are jarring, but not a deal-killer. ***",1212105600,2,2344,4.576190476190476
3423885,1,B00197YZCW,"For some reason, there was no way to add subtitles and the Irish accent was so thick I couldn't understand half of what was going on so I quit watching it. Too bad because I like both actors heading up the movie.",1458000000,2,212,4.071428571428571

3423888,5,B00197YZCW,Loved this movie and I would recommend this one to others,1437955200,,57,4.2727272727272725
3423889,5,B00197YZCW,"This is a delightful, heart-warming film, beautifully acted, particularly by Gillian Anderson, who speaks in a perfectly consistent Northern Irish accent.  It was made in 2005, and also stars Robert Carlyle.  It touches on the history of The Troubles in Northern Ireland, and also shows the delightful relationship between the boy and a gorgeous greyhound, who he names The Mighty Celt. The young actor who plays Donal, the boy training the greyhound, is marvellous, and it is a must-see film, for which Gillian Anderson richly deserved the award she won for her role.",1427673600,2,568,5.096774193548387

3423891,5,B00197YZCW,"Love this movie! Robert Carlyle was the reason I wanted to watch it... he is wonderful in it! Julian Moore is a favorite too, but the kid, wow... his first film ever and he was terrific! Loved the story, which I won't spoil for anyone here...",1424822400,,242,4.282608695652174
3423892,5,B00197YZCW,"Sweet film, a bit hard to understand due to the accents.",1419120000,,56,4.181818181818182

3423895,5,B00197YZCW,"Beautiful movie. Some of the dialog is a little hard to understand, but this doesn't  detract from the over all enjoyment of t he movie.",1410652800,,136,4.44
3423896,5,B00197YZCW,great movie with favorite actor Robert Carlyle and worth watching even for kids but for one scene where dog dies,1393200000,,112,4.65
3423897,5,B00197YZCW,"There are definitely some scenes in this film that made me cringe, and definitely some scenes that made me cry. There were also scenes that made me laugh and scenes that had me so engrossed I was hanging halfway off of my couch. This is a movie that touches on many different genres. The acting is superb. Robert Carlyle, as always, did a fantastic job, as did Gillian Anderson. I was also especially impressed with Tyrone McKenna; he definitely holds his own against the veteran actors. This was a very touching story that will most definitely pull at your heartstrings.",1363132800,2,571,4.72
3423898,4,B00197YZCW,"This movie gives a rare look into the dark side of greyhound racing in Ireland. Unfortunately, the story told here still goes on and greyhounds are still being mistreated and killed when their owners no longer value them as an income source. I applaud this film for bringing this subject to the masses.",1361836800,2,302,4.716981132075472
3423899,5,B00197YZCW,"I bought this because I'm on a quest to own all of Robert Carlyle's movies and shows. But I've watched it over and over again because I truly love it. Somehow, Mr. Carlyle is at his best when he's defending a child, and that's certainly true here. His ""dad"" instincts come through loud and clear, and he just makes me want to cry sometimes with his fearless ability to show vulnerability and love. Gillian Anderson is wonderful as the crusty mom with all her walls up, and her young son is just....wow. Beware that there is a scene of extreme animal cruelty, so if that's going to put you off, be careful. But that's only one small scene, and it sets up what follows, so grit your teeth, animal lovers, and get over yourselves. I also loved the accents here - whether Mr. Carlyle is doing a movie set in Sheffield, or Scotland, or Ireland, or Maine, or Fairy Tale Land, or Outer Space, he manages to sound authentic. I'll just state it clearly: I could watch him order lunch and be enthralled.",1354665600,18,993,4.4316939890710385
3423900,3,B00197YZCW,"I loved this one for the simple fact that I love Robert Carlyle.  It seems as though no matter what he plays in, the part always seems to fit him like a glove.  While I enjoyed the concept of this movie: boy loves dog, dog wins as underdog, and everyone lives happily ever after.  It just isn't so.  Not to spoil the ending but the perfect ending never happens.  I would've loved to have seen less severe profanity and outright violence.  There's good lessons for children in the film but do to the nature of the script, it is definitely not kid friendly.  Not to mention, the main child character smokes throughout.  All in all, I liked it; I just wished I could share it with my family.  It's a bit like a dysfunctional Lassie.",1330819200,4,729,4.340740740740741
3423901,5,B00197YZCW,"First of all Gillian is the BEST!!! I love her and I think all of them were spot on! It is very Irish and so you need to be familiar with the language to understand it but its not too hard to figure out. I am familiar with Irish movies but I did understand probably about 90% of what was said because of that. But its still a great movie but not for young kids. My daughter is 14 and she was shocked about the dog part but it ended happy and we both were thrilled. I will be buying this movie from Amazon, of course.",1297382400,4,516,3.8773584905660377
3423902,3,B00197YZCW,"The movie depicts a story of a little boy trying to save the life of one dog. It's not a Disney portrayal of a boy and his dog, but rather a more realistic telling of the fate of racing greyhounds. If you are a big Gillian Anderson fan, be aware that she has a supporting role here as the protagonist's mother, and so her screentime is limited. Also, beware of the lack of close captioning and the sick Irish accent and slang that is the language of this film.",1248048000,,460,4.179775280898877
3423903,3,B00197YZCW,I orginally got this movie because Gillian Anderson is in it and I love her. The story line is good but you do have to listen really carefully if your like me and don't understand Irish English slang it can be difficult to understand. Story line is good but if you are a dog lover you might want to prepare yourself for some very intense scenes of animal cruilty.,1247702400,2,363,4.27536231884058
3423904,5,B00197YZCW,scully was wonderful in her performance in another life. It's good to she anderson playing a low status character compared to her upper status character in the x-files. When I seen her character smoking I said no don't do it scully It's bad for your health. she played splendid talking with that irish accent I loved it and her. I recommend it for anderson fans.,1241308800,,362,4.584615384615384
8272335,5,B00197YZCW,"I watched this before, late at night, on the IFC Channel, and really wanted to see it again. I loved it the first time and again this time. As an animal activist and lover, I found the one scene of animal cruelty very hard to watch. But it was necessary to set up the ending, and to provide the necessary glimpse into the dark heart of ""Good Joe."" I've never seen Gillian Anderson doing an Irish accent, and she does it well enough that I'm not sure what her real accent is. Same with Robert Carlyle, also an excellent actor. The boy playing Donal was top-notch as well. I suspect we'll be seeing more of him in the future. This is a movie that I'm likely to watch over and over, so I really ought to go ahead and buy it. Some of the other reviews said that it was difficult to follow without subtitles, and I'd have to agree. Fortunately I did have them, but would have been in trouble otherwise.",1509235200,,897,4.22093023255814
8272336,3,B00197YZCW,"Five stars for Robert Carlyle and Gillian Anderson, but I couldn't understand the boy and the story about the dogs treatment was just to sad for me. The villain should have been taken away in handcuffs.....I couldn't recommend this movie.",1503619200,,238,4.975
8272337,1,B00197YZCW,"This CD does not have the ability to have voice printed captions. Because the Gaelic accents are so strong, it is very hard to understand the story line. What I did understand was great. This review has nothing to do with the story line or actors.",1483747200,,247,4.391304347826087

8272342,2,B00197YZCW,"The plus is watching Gillian Anderson.  The many minuses are a pretty unlikeable, arrogant kid character and accented english that is generally incomprehensible, but the major downer for us was:  **Spoiler follows**
killing a dog in a violent and graphic manner in the movie...the director lost us right there.  It was totally unnecessary and the ending did nothing to redeem this violent act.",1469923200,,393,5.2063492063492065
8272343,5,B00197YZCW,This is a very good movie.  It is not flashy but it is very moving and all of the actors work well together.  It leaves you with a lesson also.,1469750400,,143,3.7333333333333334
