6508445,4,B00LW8APJK,"I loved this campy show. got season two from library, as i had nothing else to watch. can't wait to get season 1. i am giving it 4 stars because the story lines aren't up to par with my favorite italian detective of all time, montalbano.",1420416000,4,237,4.173913043478261

6508447,5,B00LW8APJK,"We Love Manara. . . beautiful people, authentic Italian scenery, quick plots that surprise sometimes.  Guido Caprino is dreamy and sensitive.  We are wishing for Season Three.",1418342400,4,175,5.444444444444445

6508449,5,B00LW8APJK,"Season 2 -- it just gets better.  Of course, it's just silly entertainment.  For those interested in brushing up on their Italian, they speak fast, but not in dialect.",1413417600,2,167,4.724137931034483
6508450,5,B00LW8APJK,"I love Inspector Manara.  It's so ""Italian""!  These characters just roll along full of life and energy.  It's such fun.",1412726400,5,119,4.85

6508464,5,B00LW8APJK,"A younger, hipper, Italian Detective Montalbano spinoff,
not too much depth here, but entertaining.
You may even witness a Montalbano reference on occasion.",1446940800,2,156,5.826086956521739
6508465,5,B00LW8APJK,great total entertainment,1444435200,,25,7.666666666666667

6508469,5,B00LW8APJK,"I am so sorry there are only two seasons.  This was one of the most charming series I have watched in a long time.  The cast are all very memorable and delightful characters.  There is a lot of sympathy for the ""bad"" guys too.  All in all a great treat and a big bargain for the money.",1436745600,2,285,3.9473684210526314

6508471,2,B00LW8APJK,"Poorly written, poorly acted, hackneyed plots.",1424649600,,46,6.833333333333333
8668464,4,B00LW8APJK,"Pretty much run of the mill cop show, but the relationships among the characters are fun to watch and the story arc has some unexpected twists.  Since I don't know Italian, I had to use the subtitles, but they seem adequate, if not a little better than average.",1530230400,,261,4.4375
8668465,3,B00LW8APJK,"This series owes much to Maltalbano and even acknowledges that from time to time.  A frothy, not too intellectually challenging set of mysteries and a cast which seems to have solid chemistry adds up to good entertainment value if not great TV.  The main character is a bit of a jackass with
his romantic leads but it all leads to an eventual happy ending.",1508976000,,356,4.546875
