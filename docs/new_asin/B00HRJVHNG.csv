6200731,5,B00HRJVHNG,"Not only did I enjoy how everyone who was killed got seriously messed up, but the use of prosthetic gore was awesome!! Props to the anti-cgi Make-Up Department!! I respect that art to the fullest and it was great to see it here! The cast & crew held it Camp Dread together as it had all the elements of the classic Horror flicks. It was pleasant seeing Danielle Harris again (she was my kiddie-crush back in ""The Last Boy Scout""), Eric Roberts is always a great villainous character, and Nicole Cinaglia maintains that star power that I have seen in all of her prior works. The cast was as diverse as their deaths and (at the risk of sounding crazy) I could watch them die all over again. A twist ending is always a plus and the final fatality was never-before-seen and CRAZY!! I look forward to seeing more from Director Harrison Smith as he grows in this element. More gore! More entertainment! Lets get it!! ^_^",1397606400,,914,4.479041916167665
6200732,4,B00HRJVHNG,"I was fortunate enough to get a copy of this movie early to review on our show, Bloodbath and Beyond, and I must say I was super impressed. This is a great story that seems like it would parallel the ideas of Robert Hiltzik of the Sleepaway Camp series, had he not have just made 'Return' a few years earlier. That being said, fans of Sleepaway Camp will embrace the performance by Felissa Rose (yes, Angela her(?)self!).

Reminiscent of the reality show 13:Fear is Real (god, I miss that), this is a modernized camp slasher that takes place on the set of a reality show as things turn deadly!

Great kills, gorgeous women, and a nice guessing game the whole way through. Buy this!",1397606400,,681,4.483870967741935
6200733,5,B00HRJVHNG,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film's unique approach to the slasher subgenre.  Obviously the producers and director know their subject matter very well.  I think some people may misunderstand the use of character archetypes, but I thought CAMP DREAD did a terrific job of subverting both the typical tropes and audience expectations.  I expect that, as more people discover this gem, it will become a cult classic.  Well-done!",1397606400,3,431,5.202898550724638
6200734,2,B00HRJVHNG,Long story short cute chicks but no nudity. Interesting ending but weak movie. And the sin of all horror movies (to me) lackluster gore. I bought this overpriced movie because of danielle harris and was very disappointed to find out she is only in 15 min. Of the 1hr. 33min.

6200737,4,B00HRJVHNG,"There's a fine line between respectfully imitating the slasher genre and failing at it. I can't quite tell you why it works at times and why the concept falls flat at others. The ""Scream"" movies did a great job of being self-aware, celebrating all the typical ingredients of a good killer flick, and then expanding upon it. ""Camp Dread"" is a movie that gets the overly-tried and true formula for fun, sophisticated gore, and thrills right for the most part.

A group of troubled young adults are recruited to attend a summer camp at the location where a series of slasher films were made in the 1980s. Director Julian Barrett (Eric Roberts) invites them to take part in a reality TV-based reboot of his franchise where the last person left alive wins a million dollars. The attendees think it's all staged until corpses are found strewn out all over the campgrounds.

""Camp Dread"" tries very hard to rise above the countless other clones of ""Friday the 13th"" that are released weekly straight-to-DVD. Although not perfect, its genuine effort through the use of practical gore effects and an attempt at a fun surprise ending far outweigh its sometimes tedious checklist of genre do's and don't's. In a world firmly submerged in the use of CGI, it's a breath of fresh air to see the use of theatrical blood and prosthetics, even if they don't always look as ""real"" as they should.

The cast of victims are your typical bunch of multi-cultural types from all walks of life. Each one is given traits that instill in the viewer a sense of urgency to see each of them die a horrible death. The actors play their roles quite well on a B-movie level. Eric Roberts is as smarmy and loathsome as ever in his role as the washed-up and desperate movie director. Danielle Harris gets far too little screen-time playing the token sheriff of the small town where the camp is located. It's entertaining to see the little scream queen from all the ""Halloween"" movies grown up and playing an adult in a position of power.

""Camp Dread"" is not rated, but could easily carry an R. There's bloody violence, language, adult situations, and nudity. It has everything long-time audiences of slasher films have come to expect and in one scene a little more possibly.

""Camp Dread"" is a fun rollercoaster ride of thrills and gore that commemorates the slasher films that came before it. The movie mimics its predecessors on purpose while wanting to be taken seriously through throwing in some interesting plot twists and turns in its finale. Fans of ""The Burning,"" ""Friday the 13th,"" and other similar films will take pleasure in this bloody romp through the woods.",1397260800,10,2639,4.753275109170306

6200739,2,B00HRJVHNG,I found this movie to be quite lame. I've seen this kind of plot and story twists in lots of other low budget movies. It's really predictable to the experienced horror fan. Eric Roberts once again proves why he's not an in demand actor because he gives a lack luster performance of a deuce bag character. And for all you Danielle Harris fans out there be prepared to be even more disappointed as Ms. Harris only makes two very brief appearances in this film in the beginning and in the final scene. I  don't even know why she was given second to top billing in this movie behind Eric Roberts because she's practically non existing in this movie. This movie is at best good for a one time rental. I wouldn't buy it again if I had to do it over.,1456531200,3,743,4.2695035460992905
6200740,4,B00HRJVHNG,"This one came into the library where I catalog items, and I snatched it up, since one of my favorite B actors, Eric Roberts, was on the cover. I didn't even read what it was about before popping it into the DVD player.

It was an amusing throwback to the 80s slasher films, with todays technology. The opening where Eric Roberts character, Julian, and the sheriff were eating breakfast, instantly made me think of the small town I grew up in. And then when they showed the cabins it looked almost exactly like Edgewater Inn and Cabins where the yearly IndieHorror. TV Cabin Weekend takes place. I felt a kinship with the movie right away.

It was very enjoyable, and the kill scenes were pretty decent. Towards the end I was lost for a second when one of the characters was attacked, but then a second later the killer was outside the door. But after I thought about it, it made sense. There was a twist at the end that I did not predict, which was nice.
I would recommend this movie, especially if you enjoy 80s slashers.",1452816000,,1022,4.430851063829787

I wanted to watch it for the ""novelty factor"" and we ended up really enjoying it. Reminiscent of the slasher films of my youth, there were plot twists enough with every ""character type"" being represented.

6200743,5,B00HRJVHNG,"Camp Dread, to me, signifies that horror movies that are released direct to video and on demand can be quite more intriguing and deliver more than the ones that make it to movie theaters. Being a rare product of our current time (that being, not a remake or ""re-imagining""), it's shown that horror films can still deliver the kind of fun and shock that we came to love back in the day. No doubt it's a spiritual successor to the Sleepaway Camp series, mainly because of Felissa Rose and the campgrounds.

6200754,1,B00HRJVHNG,"They had a fun idea for a movie here....mixing the world of reality TV with a slasher movie.  However, what we've got is a bumbling mess.  The basic plot doesn't even make sense in that the campers are supposed to be competing for a million dollars.  We keep hearing about ""challenges"" in which the winner gets ""immunity"" and one of the losers will be ""eliminated.""  As a basic premise, sounds good.  Yet, they never compete.  Oh, we get a single round of a paddle fight, but that's it. The rest of the movie we get to watch them do housework and complain.  The movie doesn't even follow the rules it sets up for itself, so what we're left with is a jumbled mess that is the worst thing a horror movie can be....Boring. (Danielle Harris fans can skip it.

The cast is what I liked best, its always good to see Danielle Harris even if it was very short screen time, it was cool to see Felissa Rose pop up for a bit in this movie too as one of the counsellors (people may remember her classic appearance in the original sleepaway camp movie) If you like a good cheap slasher then check it out, its certainly not one of the best but its still good fun for a few quid!",1419379200,,1046,4.183168316831683

The movie was watchable to some extent until the ending. Towards the last 30 minutes or so, the movie goes from regular to a bit whack. Yes, it had gore but its plot twist towards the end dug itself a hole to which I disliked the movie.

6200773,3,B00HRJVHNG,"Eric Roberts and Danielle Harris are in it. That's enough to hook any horror junkie. Don't be disappointed if you are signing on for Danielle. She's only in the beginning and the end. The summer camp slasher is updated by setting it as a 'reality tv show', which is sprung on the 'contestants' at the last minute. They thought they were going to an 'Outward Bound' type of camp because they were in some kind of trouble and it was either that or rehab/jail/parents disowning them, etc. They are informed that the 'last one standing' will win 1,000,000. The director, played by Eric Roberts, had a big success in the 80s with a slasher horror flick set at the same camp the present ""reality tv show"" is set.  He recruits his former star who is now a counselor/therapist to work as the counselor for the contestants. They are not teens, more like 21 and up but not past late 20s. He is planning on taking this taping and pitching it as a remake for his old horror hit. Time has not been kind to him so he's got an urgency for money. Anyway, the movie is pretty straightforward for this type of flick. There are tensions and conflicts between campers and nobody knows who the ""killer"" is (as far as they are concerned, its just an act) but then suddenly things take a turn for the too much reality. The killer's identity isn't known until the end. There's an novel little reveal toward the end about the funding for this 'show'. LOL This flick is like one of the many camper slasher flicks that came out in the 80s. Its mission is to give the horror junkie something to watch, not aiming for any awards. That's why I didn't round up and give it a 4. Better you keep your expectations in check. I wouldn't recommend it as the main event in a movie night shindig. But if you are a horror junkie and need your daily fix, this one will fit the bill. Its not PG13ified or sentimental in any way. Its also nice to revisit the good old days of the genre, and Eric Roberts is always reliable.",1398729600,4,1981,4.354054054054054
6200774,1,B00HRJVHNG,"I thought perhaps because Eric Roberts was in this it might be decent (he has been a ""decent"" actor in some older films he has done), even though it did not get very good reviews by many people. After the first 15-20 minutes it was clear I was wrong. It has a similar type of plot that has been used many times, it had poor acting, poor special effects and poor writing. I think I stuck it out 25 minutes and then I was irritated and quickly stopped it and went to another movie that was much, much better (it would not have taken much to be better!). Unless you like C-D grade slash/gore movies that are poorly done, I would suggest you skip this snoozer.",1398297600,,656,4.214285714285714
6200775,3,B00HRJVHNG,"Emily over at BluntReview(dot)com says: Eric Roberts, who does a larger cameo here, had me at, ""They took my finger Charlie,"" in Pope of Greenwich Village. He is a mega-talent that can't seem to catch the ""star maker"" role, even after all these years... Anyway, here he lets his werewolf-wide pearlys chomp into a really smart script. That being said, Camp Dread suffers in its on and off again composition techniques, its direction, of a story whose big reveal takes a big viewing commitment to get there. And either you'll be excited at the neat twist, or you've turned off the film as the wait's too gosh darn long. What I'm saying is that sometimes the movie and its desire to thrill (albeit summer-slasher-of-olden-days' movie style) is clear and other times your RCA-dogging at the TV, trying to follow and stay engaged. But, director Harrison Smith (who wrote The Fields) has a dynamic future ahead of him; Camp Dread is perhaps his Dementia 13. There are little planted saplings of rare orchid among some swamp weeds.

Story goes...a bunch of ne'er do well people are auditioning for a new reality show. They will get a free trip to an old-school-style camp for the camera's enjoyment of viscerally intruding into every aspect of their day.

But, once the chosen cast, filled with stereotypes of really rude self-centered people, arrives it's the proverbial Ten Little Indians as members start to disappear. It must be part of the show they all think ...

The rather clog-stepped start has a fun pay off. Since, most of the film's audience should be heading down one plot path only to find themselves chutes and laddered down another; that is very clever. But, perhaps as Camp Dread had (obviously) a lower budget, and perhaps this is why some edits, or vital story scenes are a tad confusing (or is it the curse of the writer/director ?). And I'm leaving the actors alone because performances range so much; Roberts is clearly the ""star"", though he only shows towards the end.

Yet, over all the plot is so wonderfully Night Gallery (<- giving its viewing age group a nod here folks) you'll want to chomp that popcorn through to its end. Well, that being said, if it's a raining night and you're in for the night, and up for semi-old fashioned horror that takes its time revealing itself. Bottom line is, Camp Dread is absolutely not for the tell-me-all- Twitter- news-in-two-sentences-set.

This is recommended for film makers and film aficionados to take note on bringing a great plot to screen, while taking notice where the film could have really been reigned in and taken it from so-so to amazing; Camp Dread is a coulda been. And, for those wanting to create themselves, alesson in keeping it tight, and remember your audience is waiting...

8634888,5,B00HRJVHNG,I loved this movie. I love Danielle Harris and Harrison Smith is quickly becoming a favorite of mine in the horror genre. This was a great throwback slasher film. With a good twist in the story.,1474243200,,194,4.416666666666667
