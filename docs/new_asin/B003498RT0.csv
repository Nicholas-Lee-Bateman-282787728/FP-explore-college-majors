4066502,4,B003498RT0,"I bought the movie last night because it's by the makers of Napoleon Dynamite. Loved Napoleon! I get so tiered of your typical Hollywood cookie cutter movies. I figured it was definatly worth watching. The humor was great. I could honestly do without the puke scenes. The part where he threw up and the girl kissed him was beyond gross. What's with all the puke. Every movie seems to have scenes where people are hurling? There are certain things that just don't want to be seen. Other than the throwing up I really liked this movie. It was weird but fun. Definatly different than Napoleon but simularities in clothing, type of characters, and the low budget feel. The characters were awsome. Loved the flying deer and the guy with the bangs. Actually I think the combination of all the characters made this film so fun to watch.",1267833600,,829,4.64625850340136
4066503,5,B003498RT0,"Just saw this movie with a group of friends last night. It is awesome. I could watch it again and again. Scenes range from quirky-creepy to over-the-top-mind-blowers.

The negative press makes no sense. There must be payoffs involved. GENTLEMEN BRONCOS WAS BLACKBALLED!!!",1267660800,3,271,5.4523809523809526
4066504,4,B003498RT0,"I had seen reviews for this movie on Rotten Tomatoes and rated on IMDB and can't understand why it got such horrible reviews. I just watched this movie tonight and found it absolutely hilarious from start to finish. Clement and Rockwell are great, and Mike White makes me bust out laughing in every scene he is in. This is an exceedingly original film, I can't think of anything to compare it to off the top of my head, and the fact that Cher and the Scorpions are both in the soundtrack makes all the more loopy. PLEASE GIVE THIS MOVIE A CHANCE!",1267488000,84,546,4.362745098039215
4066505,5,B003498RT0,"As soon as I heard about Jared Hess' latest project, I was excited to see it - even before the Dr. Chevalier viral videos were released.

So I was a tad let down to hear the negative buzz surrounding the film, and to discover it wouldn't be playing in any nearby theaters.

Even still, I decided to take a chance and purchase it on BluRay instead of renting.  I'm one of the minority who really liked not only Napoleon Dynamite, but ALSO enjoyed Nacho Libre (typical response to Nacho Libre was poor).  So I figured Gentlemen Broncos was a safe bet.  ...and it turns out that it was!

Admittedly, there are a couple of ""what the heck"" scenes (particularly those involving Halley Feiffer) which I think some will find a bit off-putting if not totally repulsive, but overall the film is chock full of hilarious gems.  (The PG-13 rating was due primarily to crude humor.  There was one instance where ""ape sh**"" was used, but no swearing beyond that.)

I thought all of the characters were very well-played by their respective actors.  Jemaine Clement's Ronald Chevalier is often cited as the show-stealer, and for good reason, but I found myself wanting to see more of Sam Rockwell's Bronco character.  His near-hillbilly (fantastic southern accent) action hero portrayal was delightful to watch.  I laughed hysterically at his ""What the crap?!"" reaction upon waking up in Daysius' lab.

It did seem like there could've been more extra features, but maybe that was because I'd seen many of them (the ""Webspots"") online prior to the release.  The behind-the-scenes was a treat, which I would also liked to have seen more of, but the outtakes made up for it.",1267488000,43,1654,4.757894736842105
4066506,5,B003498RT0,"I went into this movie knowing NOTHING about it. And I LOVED it. For me personally this is Hess' best film. It's incredibly quirky, there are so many great moments. Sam Rockwell is comic gold. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who liked his other films at all.

I would also like to say that I think the price of the DVD is pretty ridiculous and will inevitably spurn piracy. I am torn about buying it. I want a copy pretty badly but I don't know if I should wait the price out or not.",1267401600,24,495,4.15625
4066507,5,B003498RT0,"The followers of this crew who have enjoyed their creations (Nacho Libre, Napolean Dynamite) will absolutely love this piece, but I think once again Sam Rockwell steals another film and I think he should be the one on the cover art.

The story follows the universe of a teen writer living in a desolate place (similar to Dynamite - except bleaker), and the fictional universe of his creation led by the hero called Bronco/Brutus - the ever changing Sam Rockwell. Along the way we are spattered with the absolute epitome of nerds and a population living an uneventful Utah existence. But with this journey we see some improv performances that fit right in with how these guys make their stories so unique. The Blu is packed with a volume of material including:

* Deleted scenes, 5:53 minutes. Glad they were cut but it will be more for the fans.
* Outtakes, 8:48 minutes. Hilarious and worthy of every Sam Rockwell laugh.
* Behind the scenes, 15:29 minutes. A valid look into production and special effects, with the usual camp feel of a Hess film. The amount of improv is verified in all of the acting, but it still shows how some of the thinking materializes in the Hess' noggins.
* Mini docs, 17 clips totaling 25 minutes. I wish these would have been placed as part of the behind the scenes, as it gets tedious to scroll through all of them, even with the play all option. Being an obvious fan of Rockwell, I recommend watching the 2nd, 7th, 8th, 14th and 15th minis (or the ones that have Sam in the title selection) - as he manages to show the sides of him (humorous and serious even in the most lamest of sequences) that makes him the owner of this film.

The Blu clarity is decent but deliberately flawed in some of the sci-fi sequences, otherwise a good transfer. The DTS gets a resounding usage in all of the battle scenes and is the best mix to date for their type of film making. Region coded A, English, Spanish and French language with English and Spanish subs only. A thorough product for the people that love this group, and maybe a renter if you sit on the fence of how you like their previous work.",1267315200,6,2116,4.476683937823834
4066508,1,B003498RT0,"I guess Salt Lake City was ""lucky"" enough to be one of the few venues they tried this film out on. My brother, a huge Napoleon Dynamite fan was very excited to see the film, so against my better judgement, I went. Trust me, as I am not a huge Napoleon Dynamite fan, this film is nowhere as interesting. The best part, in fact the only part is the Dr. Ronald Chevalier character. He at least has some of the quirkiness and novelty the main characters in the other movies had. The only feeling after this film was an overwhelming sense of being annoyed by the whole thing. I am pretty sure the other four people in the theater had the same reaction.",1265587200,7,647,4.2682926829268295
4066509,5,B003498RT0,"Fox Searchlight is handling this movie in the most bizarre way. I can't find out anywhere if they are going to widely release the movie or not. I e-mailed my local independent movie theater to ask if they were going to EVENTUALITY screen it and I got back a snarky e-mail about it being the worst reviewed movie of the year. It hasn't even been fully reviewed, because Fox Searchlight postponed the screenings! Such is the power of negative buzz.

  Honestly for a company that releases independent films they seem pretty wishy-washy. If it's going straight to DVD than say so, otherwise actually let the movie stand on it's own and release it nationwide. This weird silence is quickly killing this movie before 99.9% of us have had a chance to see it.",1262131200,4,752,4.639097744360902
4066510,5,B003498RT0,This movie would be a hit in theaters if they would release it properly. All they have to do is advertise it linking it big time to Napoleon Dynamite and people would bite for sure.,1258761600,2,181,4.2
4066511,5,B003498RT0,"I am what I would call a casual fan of Jared Hess and his films. I own both Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre on both DVD and Blu-Ray along with the soundtracks for each of the two films. I have been looking forward to seeing Gentlemen Broncos since I found the Ronald Chevalier website earlier this year and discovered it was tied into Jared's newest upcoming film. It was distributed in what they call limited release on October 30. Now two weeks later I finally have the time to go see it after a tedious move into my new apartment only to discover that it is not being shown anywhere in the Los Angeles area. On top of that I find there is no soundtrack available. Total box office gross at the time of writing this is reported at just over $50,000 nationwide (in limited release) with a total production cost of $10,000,000. I'm sure I'm not the only person who would wonder why Fox/Searchlight is, from what one can gather, going almost out of their way to make sure this film bombs. True, it is suffering a fair amount of heat from critics, but so have many other movies that I own and enjoy. And perhaps it wouldn't be as well-received as Napoleon, but at least give it a chance to breathe. Paramount and Nickelodeon Films gave Nacho the publicity it deserved, and I think it's sad that Fox/Searchlight isn't willing to do the same for Broncos. Bad form, indeed.",1258243200,8,1370,4.46215139442231

To me it is a cult classic.",1497571200,,304,4.1525423728813555
4066518,1,B003498RT0,"I just saw this movie the other day after having just come by it on the video store shelf.  As I had never heard of this movie before a week ago when I saw it I never knew what to expect but as much as I enjoyed Napoleon Dynamite I figured there must be something entertaining and thought-provoking about it.  Needless to say that didn't prove to be the case in the slightest after viewing it.

The movie focuses on Benjamin Purvis, a teenage kid who wants to be a writer.  Benjamin takes a bus trip to a writers class taught by his favorite sci-fi fantasy writer Dr. Ronald Chevalier.  In class he teaches the wannabe sci-fi and fantasy writers a lecture on good and successful ways to name the characters in their stories.  Dr. Chevalier has all of the students submit their proposed potential novels for a contest to have their story published.  Benjamin has to rush home to help his mother at her clothing shop so he never gets to attend the second day of the writers class.  While getting to know this beautiful young woman named Tabatha of whom has a friend named Lonnie who has a video production company, Tabatha convinces Benjamin to allow them to make a movie out of his book idea Yest Lords after he does a trailer for a movie that they were working on.  Meanwhile, a very desperate for a new book idea Dr. Chevalier is fumbling through all of the students would-be books only to decide to not only plagiarize Ben's book but also make really ridiculous changes to it.  Ben has 2 fights on his hands now for the integrity of his story while his mother Judith hopes to impress a fashion designer with her clothing designs.

The problem with this movie besides the nasty and unnecessary gross out jokes, is the characters are way too flat and not that interesting plus some are just plain annoying.  Also the writing is pretty dull and lightweight.  The character development is hardly even there.  The only star whose acting was any good was lovely and sexy Jennifer Coolidge as Ben's mother Judith.  She was also the only well developed character in the movie.  None of the non-disgusting humor was funny or clever.  The storyline was weak.  How Ben's father died and anything about him just wasn't developed.  Ben's would-be book is stupid, weird, and too gross.  What a waste of Sam Rockwell's time and career it was to have him play his fictional character Bronco in Ben's story of Yeast Lords. Things often get brought up and then dropped in this movie.  There were 2 beautiful young women in this movie that seemed like one of them would be the one that Ben falls in love with but it never happens.  The book contest is never mentioned again.  Whether or not Ben's book becomes a success or not gets override by his mother's fashion show.

Overall, this movie is just plain worthless.  The vast majority of the characters are flat, the plot is not very interesting, the soundtrack is bland, the pacing is too slow, the gross-out humor is nasty and juvenile to say nothing of completely unnecessary, the characters fail to be relatable, the main characters personal conflict isn't done much with, nothing is really said about his father, things keep getting brought up and then dropped, finally there is not one funny joke in this movie, not one signature or memorable moment, to top it all off there aren't even any catchphrases either.  How Jared Hess could go from Napoleon Dynamite and then make completely worthless garbage like Nacho Libre and this movie is a total mystery.  FOR SHAME!!!  Don't even bother with this one.  0 starts out of 10!!!",1495152000,,3565,4.605388272583201
4066519,5,B003498RT0,"My friend forced me to watch this movie and I enjoyed every bit of it. Definitely give it a look, especially if you liked Napoleon Dynamite.

The best way to describe this is film is to say that it is by the same people who did Napoleon Dynamite. So it has an off-beat Intermountain West/Cultural Mormon sensibility, without being a session of General Conference. In fact, this film is PG-13 for a reason. Its not appropriate for the family home evening, or BYC or EFY.

There is good here: a good message about off-beat people achieving their dreamsBenjamin is  a George McFly-type, an aspiring sci-fi writer, and his mother is seamstress with big dreams. They realize their dreams, so you do feel good about that. But ...

  But the humor veers into a type of Austin Powers double entendres, or deadpan discussion of mammaries, gonads, fetuses, Bronchanuss, snakes pooping, pink vomit, popcorn balls, etc. So, it's really just junior high school snicker humor.

But the characterization and actingwow! Each screwball character looks the part (much like Calvin Grondahl's comics) and has charm, and each are immensely likeable. Even the geodesic house is perfect for the film.

And keep in mind that the low production values and cheesy-hokey aspects to the film are intentional. Like the Aquabats, the film is a nod to 1970s kitschespecially the sci-fi scenes. Admittedly, there is a generation gap here, and that contributes to some people's problem with the film. If you grew up with LDS roadshows or Boy Scout skits, you understand this film's angle.

This film differs from Napoleon Dynamite in that the film inter-cuts with the sci-fi story (Yeast Lords) that Benjamin Purvis has written, much like The Never Ending Story. It adds variety to the story, like the old Calvin and Hobbes comics.

But overall, this film gets a thumbs-down. There is a lot of good here (quirky characterization being the best, and Jermaine Clement's performance almost saves the movie), but the crude potty humor just did not end, and drug it down.

If we could just isolate Jermaine Clement's performance somehow  sigh.",1490572800,,2346,5.867647058823529

4066538,3,B003498RT0,"3.5 Stars. Jared Hesss little known third feature, after Napoleon Dynamite (2004) and Nacho Libre (2006), once again centers around some really quirky characters in small town America, which is the formula that made Napoleon Dynamite a hit. Tennager Benjamin (Michael Angarano) is home-schooled by his eccentric mother, Judith [Jennifer Coolidge; American Pie series, Best of Show (2000), Legally Blonde (2001), 2 Broke Girls (2012  Present)]. Barely scraping by, she owns a womens nightgown store in the mall and makes popcorn balls. Benjamin loves to write sci-fiction and ends up attending a fantasy writers convention with some other homeschoolers. There he befriends Tabatha and Lonnie and meets his favorite fantasy writer, Chevalier [Jemaine Clement; Flight of the Conchords (2007-2009), Dinner for Schmucks (2010), Men in Black 3 (2012)]. Chevalier, who is looking for a new book, rips off the story Benjamin submits at the end of the conference. Tabatha and Lonnie, the towns most prolific filmmaker in town, also buy the rights to the book with a post-dated check. The cream of the crop is the story in question is told in a linear fashion throughout the with Sam Rockwell [Charlies Angels (2000), Matchstick Men (2003), Iron Man 2 (2010), The Way Way Back (2013)] as the lead. A different style is used depending on if its Benjamins, Chevaliers, or the movie version. Gentlemen Broncos doesnt have the desperate, down and out flair of Napoleon Dynamite but definitely has the quirkiness and some hilarious moments that make it worth watching. The parts with Sam Rockwell are definitely the spot on cheese they are suppose to be. If you're a fan of Napoleon Dynamite or that style of comedy, its worth seeking this movie out.",1468454400,,1735,5.109154929577465

There is absolutely no middle ground with this absurdist sort of humor. The basic plot is simple enough: a teen's original story is submitted to a fiction writing camp seminar, where a washed up author is teaching. The author, under pressure from his publisher for another bestseller, steals the teen's story and releases it as his own to great success. Wrapped around that framework is the insanity of the teen's single mother, her boyfriend, the oddball town they live in, the zaniness of the author, and finally sprinkled into this mix are scenes from the teen's sci-fi story, all acted by Sam Rockwell as the hilariously named Balzak. The goofy, silly, so-stupid-you-have-to-laugh antics and dialog are almost nonstop for the whole film. Be prepared to groan a lot, then laugh. If you have ever been involved in the amatuer sci-fi writing world, this will be even more hilarious and slightly too close to home for you.",1440201600,,1061,4.771739130434782

Jared Hess movies require 1 to 2 viewings to get over the awkward shock before you really start adoring every subtle detail and line throughout the movies. This movie approaches Nap Dyn and Nacho Libre's quotability and is side-splittingly satyrical of semi-rural Utah culture paralleling a wonderfully bizzare fantasy story. Jennifer Coolige NAILS her part, and Jemain Clement plays a harmlessly hatable and pathetic ""villain"" (if you could even call it that).

And I have a feeling those who hated this movie were watching it on the most basic level - noting things like the plot, and waiting for BIG, OBVIOUS jokes and punchlines.  NAPOLEON was a movie that was very accessible by this audience, because the plot in that movie had those types of jokes, as well as some subtle jokes that were easy to detect.

On the other hand, is the more peculiar, eclectic humor found within the movie itself.  Strange characters; strange costumes; complete scoundrels; subtle jokes that are not so easy to detect.  On this side sits GENTLEMEN BRONCOS.  If you are a fan of this director, and the odd worlds he creates, this movie is for you.  Jermaine Clement is AWESOME as a scoundrel author who steals the bizarre sci-fi manuscript of one of his biggest fans.  Truth is, the characters are so interesting, and those floating around them so funny and bizarre, that the plot is really secondary to the humor found in their lives and how they interact.

Jennifer Coolidge plays a wacky mom character who's not quite ready to give up her dream of being a nightgown designer. And I love love love Michael Angarano as Benji, the innocent, beat-down home-schooled high schooler with big dreams of his own. All this with enough juvenile gross-out humor to make it icky. I think you really have to watch it more than once to truly see how cool it is. It's not for everyone, but if you like the geeky and the odd, it's great.",1405036800,2,846,4.801369863013699
4066648,1,B003498RT0,"The reviews and overall star rating for this movie are very deceptive.  In order to even FIND this movie you have to be a Jared Hess fan and enjoy his humor in Nappy D. (Napoleon Dynamite) and Nacho Libre.  I loved Nappy D, but was unimpressed with Nacho Libre.  If Nappy D had a 50/50 love/hate split then Gentlemen Broncos is more on the 5/95 love/hate split.  I think 95% of people would find its humor alienating.

Gentlemen Broncos is a movie where a snake poops on a guy's sweatshirt, a Sci-fi hero defends himself by vomiting like a fire hose, and the central plot line for this seemingly popular novel is the fact that the protagonist had a testicle removed (but he found a random testicle and sowed it back on).  Some of this might have been funny if it were the least bit self aware, but I didn't detect much awareness.  I even searched for deeper meaning.  Was this a critique of the Sci-Fi genre?  The Sci-fi novel and scene recreations were not even scientific.  It was more like a fantasy book.  Wrong genre?  Huh?

Meanwhile the novel written by Purvis is illustrated in movie form not once, but THREE times.  One film is an amateur small town production, and two other versions seem to jump from the pages.  Sound confusing?  Kind of, and also very ""ho hum"" boring.  How can I care about characters when they change across three different film versions?  The special effects were intentionally terrible, which is fine, but the terribleness was humorless, leaving you with this kind of sickening feeling somewhere between anger and embarrassment -- angry you're wasting your time, and embarrassed for anyone that worked on this film.  As a somewhat normal person, I found almost nothing in this movie that I could relate to.

If this was some deeper critique of the home school crowd and the Sci-Fi community then I can only guess that Hess has a low opinion of the two.  The Bronco novel ends when Bronco defeats his opponent by activating a canon that comes out of his ""stags"" anus and blows up his enemy.  After reading the account of this finale his Mom tells her son (the author) how great the books is.  Is Hess saying all of these people (home schoolers and Sci-Fi fans) are mere trash worshipers?  If so, this is a darker and far less endearing critique than we saw in Nappy D.

Probably the only insightful scene in the movie is the one where the local small town movie production of Purvis' novel utterly fails at the theater and many people just walk out.  Yes, that is what people do when a movie is terrible, like they walked out of this movie before it was pulled from theaters.  One star for foreshadowing.",1403913600,,2636,4.553191489361702

4066664,5,B003498RT0,"The most common criticism I see for this movie is that its just weird for the sake of being weird.  I disagree.  I love how its very specific to this unusual subculture within a subculture, home schooled mormon kids who have been signed up for a science fiction writing workshop, probably to get them out of the house for a little bit.  Though I can't personally relate, I get the impression that the writers, Jared and Jerusha Hess, have some experience with it.  It's not hard to believe that you'd run into some really eccentric characters in such a place, like the self important but struggling SF author Chevalier who's teaching at the workshop, and feels like he's landed in the ninth circle of hell.

The plot does take some absurd turns, like when Chevalier steals one of this students stories, called ""Yeast Lords"" in order to bring his dying career back to life.  It's sort of a mash up of pulpy Star Wars space opera and more serious literary SF.  Ridiculous, sure, but probably not that far off some of the horrible writing you might come across from kids at a workshop like this.

It's a truly unique movie, kind of a rare thing, and often hilarious.  I give much credit to Hess for taking a chance and making such a movie, instead of giving us Napoleon Dynamite 2.",1389312000,3,1278,4.521739130434782

It's 3 movies in one, a satire of indie and big film production, a heartfelt hero tale about a young author who lost his father, and the most bizarre, beautiful sci fi scenes on the backdrop of a brilliant soundtrack. The gratuitous gross out comedy put a lot of people off, but I think it was to inspire that lost sense of childhood impulse as seen through the lonely, super-creative 15 year old kid whose art found a way to blossom amongst the mire of hacks and narcissistic ambition. Sam Rockwell is absolutely brilliant and Jemaine Clement is hurt-your-stomach-muscles high-larious: ""Does he shape-shift into equine form ever?"" ""Rupture the mooncrust she's thinking."" The movie definitely requires more than one viewing, the first one is difficult to swallow because the images on the screen are hard to process as they are delightfully weird and irreverent to say the least.

Too often, the specific kind of weirdness he brings to the table is co-opted, prettied up and mass marketed as a string of Kooky Comedies of the Month. Or at least it feels that way.

My fears were at least put on hold when I saw ""Nacho Libre,"" and though I didn't love it, at least it was still its own thing. After finally viewing ""Gentlemen Broncos,"" I think we can say with tentative surety that Jared Hess isn't interested in selling out. Film buffs, think of it this way: if Alenjandro Jodorowski had been raised as a small-town Mormon, this film might have resulted. GB feels every bit the midnight movie ""El Topo"" does, only without the obsession with Eastern mysticism, dwarves, and naked naughty bits. Casual movie-goers, think of it this way: this is one weird-a-- movie. Your reaction to it will likely be ""this is the biggest steaming pile of yeast I've ever seen"" or ""I think I may have a new favorite movie.""

I can't really imagine an ambivalent reaction to ""Gentlemen Broncos."" It's delightfully uninhibited and cozy-comfy in its affectionate skewering of sci-fi fans and authors, home-schooling families, and the nave earnestness of hick-town Utah/Idaho residents. It revels in being its exceptionally nerdy self in the process of sending up exceptional nerdiness. It's both excruciatingly awful and transcendently, squeal-with-glee breathtaking at the same time. I stand in awe of Sam Rockwell's sense of humor and alarming disregard for self-preservation for agreeing to do put this on his resume.

Who can say if you'll like it? I don't even know if I did. The word ""like"" seems infinitely inadequate to convey what any sentient being's reaction is likely to be. You don't ""like"" or ""dislike"" this movie any more than you can ""like"" or ""dislike"" being shot out of a cannon. You'll either think ""This is the highlight of my life . . take me now, God!"" or ""I just soiled myself and I'm going to die without clean underwear. Take me now, God!"" In other words, it's an experience. All I can say is, if J.J. Abrams backs out, I nominate Jared Hess as the writer/director of ""Star Wars VII."" A big-budget ""Yeast Lords"" wedged into ""Star Wars"" parameters might cause the internet and George Lucas to self-combust.",1360886400,,2465,4.808962264150943
4066708,5,B003498RT0,"I feel ill-equipped to review the movie, because I don't want my lack of professional movie-reviewing skills to detract from how great it is.  I'll do my best.  If your sense of humor is like mine (favorite comedians: Paul F Tompkins, Maria Bamford, Jim Gaffigan, John Mulaney, Al Madrigal . . .), don't miss this real treat of a movie.

Taste in comedy is of course, very subjective.  I would say use whether or not you liked Napoleon Dynamite as a baseline for whether you will like this movie.  You either like cilantro or you don't.  You either like subtly silly movies that are quirky without being creepy, or you don't.  This is an underdog becomes the hero story, played out in the world of people who are in the margins of our culture: homeschoolers, sci-fi fans, dwellers of geodesic dome houses.

In this one, a  homeschooled, amateur novelist teenager, Benjamin, played by Michael Angarano (Young William in ""Almost Famous"", young Red Pollard in ""Seabiscuit"") attends a teen science-fiction writers' conference, led by his hero, hit sci-fi author, Chevalier (Jemaine Clement of Flight of the Conchords, Men in Black III, etc.).  I don't want to say, ""When Chevalier plagiarizes Benjamin's novel, hilarity ensues"", because the hilarity begins in the first two minutes.

Like a Robert Altman movie, that gets you into a world you've only ever given a cursory glance from the outside, Gentleman Broncos gives you a real taste of the world of homeschoolers: the doting, struggling, sometimes oddball parents, the usually great relationship between homeschooling parents and their children, the confidence, misplaced or not, homeschooled kids have that they can do what they aspire to do.  While not typical, there are certain great little details that homeschoolers and readers of Mother Earth News, will recognize.  The plot, the dialogue, the action aside, these sweet little tidbits make watching this movie like eating a really great tira misu.

All the performances, from every actor, are just perfect, as is the casting.  However, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the really standout performance from Sam Rockwell, who plays the protagonist of Benjamin's novel in the Benjamin's and Chevalier's duelling versions of it.  When is Sam Rockwell going to get an Oscar, already?",1358985600,14,2291,5.0855614973262036

Why can't Hollywood ever come up with anything original? And why can't there be a sarcasm font?

This movie is pure, exuberant mayhem. It taps into the bizarre, probably drug-fueled science fiction work of the 70s and 80s with their crazy covers and prog-rock inspired plots, and maintains two stories within a story, complete with dueling movies. Along the way, it examines young love, life in a really small town, home schooling, the creative process, pompous authors and more.

I saw a clip of it in The New Yorker iPad app and was hooked. Jennifer Coolidge is amazing, and so is the lead, Michael Angarano. There's no way around it, Gentlemen Broncos is a bizarre and crazed movie, but well worth watching.

""Gentlemen Broncos"" is so off-the-charts weird at times that you often can't tell whether it's breaking new ground as a brilliantly original and creative work - or just trying too hard.

Michael Angarano (""Forbidden Kingdom"") plays Benjamin Pervis, a friendless teen who lives with his penniless mom in a geodesic-domed house in rural Utah.  Ben is a writer of sci-fi fantasy fiction who has one of his stories stolen by Ronald Chevalier (the delightful Jemaine Clement), a world-famous author with a James Mason voice.  Ben also runs into a couple of bizarre indie-film makers who want to make the same story Chevalier stole from him (entitled ""Yeast Lords"" from the series ""Gentlemen Broncos"") into one of their shoestring-budget productions.

It's hard to know whether writers Jared and Jerusha Hess (Jared also directed the film) have any real affection for their characters and the world they inhabit or whether they view them merely as objects of out-and-out mockery and ridicule.  In fact, the characters, with their mouth-breathing, slack-jawed expressions and atonal line readings, achieve near-freak show status at times.  It's this air of condescension, rather than the tale itself, that sometimes makes it hard for us to laugh at what's happening on screen.

Despite this discomfort, however, there is still much to admire in the work.  The movie has fun parodying both the unscrupulous nature of the publishing business and the accoutrements of low-budget filmmaking.  Clement is marvelously deadpan as the sci-fi penner whose writer's-block forces him to scrap all traces of authorial integrity in pursuit of the almighty buck.  And Angarano creates in Benjamin a character we can actually care about and root for.  The enactments of scenes from Benjamin's novels are appropriately hokey and cheesy, and the movie also makes astute musical choices, particularly Zager and Evans' 1969 hit ""In the Year 2525,"" which effectively book-ends the story.",1318982400,2,1968,5.312903225806451

And the Knob Creek I was sipping hadn't even kicked in. . .

So much for baseball; I left my flat screen where it 'twas, and watched the quirky freak fest known as GENTLEMEN BRONCOS.

Turns out, that is entirely correct.  This low-energy, badly made, downright goofy film about a nerdy sci-fi author wannabe getting his ""Yeast Lords"" manuscript plagiarized by his favorite author is as mesmerizing as it is entertaining.  This is the proverbial train wreck; there's just no turning away from the bizarre and surreal and nonsensical images that roll like psychedelic waves.  I still may need to see my shrink after viewing GENTLEMEN BRONCOS, but at least I can tell him my new mental dysfunction was fun to acquire.

Michael Angarano, Jennifer Coolidge, Jemaine Clement, Hector Jimenez, Halley Feiffer, and the hysterical Mike White (along with Rockwell, of course)--among several others--all give banal, quirky, yet deliciously delightful performances.

Written and directed by Jared Hess, who was also responsible for Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre, this eccentric comedy lands somewhere in between the hypnotic success of the former and the disappointing shortfalls of the latter. The opening act is a real riot, with quirky, colorful characters stepping out of the wallpaper around every corner and amazing over-the-top visualizations of Benjamin's work that treat his gorgeously hokey material with unmasked deference. While those big-screen interpretations of his hilariously awful novel continue to bring the goods throughout the film (with competing visions from the two other writers' interpretations raising the bar) the primary storyline doesn't keep pace. The awkward, passionately inept cast doesn't quite have the charm of Napoleon or Pedro, (with the exception of Jermaine Clement of Flight of the Conchords, who's outstanding as selfish sci-fi plagiarist Ronald Chevalier) and there's a notable lack of a top-of-the-mountain moment that was so present in Dynamite's dance scene.

I watched this with an open mind and after 10 minutes or so I was hooked. As well reported this is another offering from the creators of `Napoleon Dynamite' - `Vote for Pedro' etc., husband and wife Jared and Jerusha Hess. They specialise in off the wall characters that are just this side of being medically sectioned, but who are in many ways life affirming.

This tells the story of Benjamin played by Michael Angarano who writes sci-fi and his dear mum (who designs and makes clothes for the terminally bizarre ladies of this planet) sends him on a weekend literary festival where Benjamin's hero sci-fi writer (Dr. Ronald Chevalier) is not only giving work shops but judging the stories for a possible shot at being published. He makes some friends and his story is picked up and plagiarised by the brilliantly erudite `Chevalier'; played by Jemaine Clements (Flight of the Conchords'.

The story is told and interwoven with the story of his book `Yeast Lords' being played out in the two alternate versions of the book by Sam Rockwell playing the eponymous `Bronco' and alternating as `Brutus with Ballzac' (his inter galactic wolf dog type thing - it was a Lynx in the original version.)

Anyway there are brilliantly comic moments that all tie together in what for me was a really enjoyable hour and a half, so please approach this with an open mind and if you do you will hopefully find that this is a little under estimated gem.

You also need to have an appreciation for deadpan acting that takes a long, long time for the payoff.  Wacky and worth it, and pushes the comfort level of the normal viewer.  Fun even taken in parts, there are good parts.  Do NOT view the trailer it makes NO sense and alters your perception of what it is about and concatenates scenes that are not related.  Trailers are often disasters, I hate them.  I avoid them.  I'll be your soldier during the Bronco years, may the light of the borg queen shine on you.",1296864000,2,892,4.582278481012659

4066757,4,B003498RT0,"Gentlemen Broncos is the latest oddball comedy from Jared Hess, director of Napolean Dynamite. It's a film for anybody who's ever loved a bad sci-fi story or aspired to write one of their own. Allow me to rephrase that: this is not a film for everyone. One must possess an affection for the cheesiest of low-budget science fiction and fantasy for the comedy in this film to work it's insane magic. But that magic is pretty damn magical when it does work.

This is the simple story of a boy with a dream and the subsequent raping of that dream by idiot film producers and an unscrupulous author. This is a story that will not be unfamiliar to film fans and it does a great job spoofing the eternal conflict between writer and filmmaker as well as the cutthroat nature of the entertainment industry. Everybody should know by now that anything you write and you don't want stolen needs to be registered and/or copyrighted before showing it anywhere. What makes this particular standard song-and-dance anything but is the sheer insanity and whimsy of the material in the film, which contains several scenes from different interpretations of varying quality of the contested book ""Yeast Lords: The Bronco Years"" Is it the surveillance does and the battle stags that give the story in question it's charm? Maybe. Moments like pained hero angrily shouting ""You took my nads!""? A little. Poop-coated blow darts? Why not. Black Sabbath-fueled cross-dressing rampage? If that's your thing. Illustrations featuring space Harpies' mammary cannons? I'd like to think so. All of the quotable quotes that are too bizarre for me to recall at the moment? Probably. Puke and testicle jokes? Depends. The point is, if you have a taste for the unusual and an appreciation of cheesy genre books and films then you will probably get a kick out of this one. If you go in expecting Napolean Dynamite 2 or anything approaching standard Hollywood fare, don't go in at all. This is for the kids who grew up on Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers and movies about giant fire-breathing turtles and ant queens who control humans with pheromones. The rest of y'all can take a hike.

The cast of characters is the usual troupe of rejects whose faces are frozen in bizarre expressions, talk in an awkward and apparently brain-damaged manner, and have strange senses of style. After the novelty of Napolean Dynamite and Jack Black's rescuing of Hess' other film, Nacho Libre, this motif has worn a bit thin and feels contrived at this point. However, as Black made Nacho work, Broncos has a savior as well. Jemaine Clement of HBO's hysterical musical comedy series Flight of the Conchords gives an absolutely flawless performance as a pretentious and self-important sci-fi novelist whose appearances at conventions (his workshop on believable fantasy character names is indispensable) and signings are responsible for most of the knowing guffaws that any fan of the art form is likely to experience while viewing this. That man is damn funny and would have earned this flick a pass all by himself.

 ""Gentlemen Broncanous"" (ooh, that DOES have a nice ring to it!!) is the This is Spinal Tap of low-rent sci-fi. It's both an homage/tribute and a satirical parody of the genre. Not everybody is going to appreciate it, but the ones who do will appreciate it a lot. You know who you are. Check it out.",1281398400,6,3357,4.843205574912892

I have to admit that Clement amazing, but he has little to work with here.  Poor guy cant get a break.

The main character keeps switching from a sloppy deadpan to apparent constipation.  He was probably told to keep emotionless but had to stop periodically to weep quietly.  Its neither funny nor relatable.  That is unless you've had someone who was mildly interested in you eat the sick off your face before.  Watching him walk through a constant gauntlet of embarrassment is like watching a cat get kicked for an hour and a half only to swipe gently at its attacker in the last few minutes.

As for the comedy its an endless string of groin jokes, every slang term, symbol, and joke apart from a AFV football gag are strung together with a sprinkling of other bodily fluids.  All the disgusting humor would be a lot more amusing if it were set up properly, but no care is taken in the setup or delivery.  Theres no real loss, vindication, motivation, or redemption.

In short, the plot and characters echo and share many of the Hess's trademark characteristics; a remote setting somewhere in a small economically challenged mountain southwestern town (Utah), awkward and sometimes overly quirky characters, simplistic and comedic dialogue that relies more upon body language and facial expression,  a nostalgic soundtrack and a short run time.

Fans of their previous and debut hit, ""Napoleon Dynamite"", maybe disappointed due to its unlikeable protagonist that makes his character somewhat rather difficult to route for. The reason for this unintended consequence is that Benjamin Purvis becomes more of a diluted version of Napoleon Dynamite; like Napoleon, he is a social pariah too. However, Benjamin aspires to become a successful writer as opposed to running for class president; and, unfortunately, this path leads him to satisfying a deeper feeling of revenge after an acclaimed author plagiarizes his work. One reviewer on this site put it more plainly, ""Another geek on a revenge rampage"". ( a very accurate description) The rest of the cast is serviceable at best with some reappearance's from their other films (Hector Jiminez Nacho Libre) along with some new comers such as Sam Rockwell and Jemaine Celement who plays the most redeeming character of all, Ronald Chevalier. Their two characters are quite possibly the funniest; Sam Rockwell plays Benjamin Purvis's main hero Brutus/Bronco in ""Yeast Lords"" who battles cyclop enemies in a 70's sci-fi world with psychedelic colors and vibrant backdrops.

Ronald Chevalier, the supposed ""acclaimed"" author at the writing camp, steals this work of art (Yeast Lords) when his publisher threatens to drop him entirely from their publishing company because he is not generating enough sales. As a last act of desperation and a very poor one indeed, Chevalier blurts out ""Moon Fetus"", (one of the funniest scenes in my opinion) where his publisher abruptly hangs up on him in disappointment. After throwing all of the student's novels from his seminar in an enraged hissy fit, he stumbles upon Benjamin's Purvis's novel entitled, ""Yeast Lords"". It is at this point where the plot begins to run it's course and all of the characters shine in full bloom.

The film is entertaining but the intermittent cuts between the actual film, Gentlemen Broncos and Benjamin's Purvis's ""Yeast Lords"" with the exception of Sam Rockwell's flamboyant character comes off as obnoxious and does not add any real comedic value or substance. But once again, Sam Rockwell's character as Brutus is hysterical. (Can't stress this enough)  and Jemain Clement steals the show with his monotonic and intellectual voice, not too mention his outfits are also a riot. This film is worth a rent, given the short run time, (82 minutes), cheap laughs and somewhat enjoyable characters.

4066769,5,B003498RT0,"""Gentlemen Broncos"" was mesmerizing to me from beginning to end.  It's one of those films you can watch over and over and still catch something funny you missed before.

All the main characters are interesting in a quirky sort of way.  I also enjoyed the sweetness in the relationship between the mom and her son, Benjamin.  He always treats her with deference, respect, and tolerance in spite of her peculiar fashion statements and her ""bag of popcorn balls"".

I guess it's one of those movies you either really like or vehemently ""just don't get"".  I highly recommend it, but I also recognize that this film will not appeal to everyone.

That being said, the story was almost totally predictable.  After the first 15 minutes, you could tell exactly how it was going to end.  Stylistically, it was very much like ""Napeoleon Dynamite""--no surprise since they were made by the same team.  What I found disturbing about both films, however, was their portrayal of Americans as a bunch of quirkly, ineffectual buffoons.  The erstwhile filmmaker was the worst--he literally made my skin crawl every time he was on screen.  Some no doubt find this to be an endearing quality of these movies.  The characters in these movies don't represent the America I know--nor one I would ever want to live in. I suppose it was 'cute' the first time, but this time round it really got on my nerves.

4066771,4,B003498RT0,"""Dude. Circle of life.""

Broncos is far too similar to Hess' classic Napoleon Dynamite in various ways to be at all unique, and often reminded me of a junior Wes Anderson movie in some ways (not bad ones). Yet it's also very much its own film in certain aspects, and has so much gentle heart it's almost impossible not to like Gentleman Broncos to some degree.

The acting helps a lot, though Hess obviously demands constant deadpan from all of his actors (much like Wes), which really does get old after a while. This seems to be his main conceit, and while funny at first here it becomes stale after seeing the concept in full flight, as in ND. Fortunately he picked the right actors again for it again. Angarano is almost Micheal Cera part two, but holds up well enough, and Coolidge is perfect as his mom (the popcorn balls must be some sort of inside joke, I guess). Rockwell is quite amusing, as is Yeast Lords in general, but Clement steals the film with his wonderfully wry portrayal of the sci-fi writer, with his perfect voice as the key. He made me laugh a lot, and lifts this movie into a much funnier dimension. Lonnie is pretty much Pedro redux; Hess must have had a friend just like those two as a kid....one imagines that this and ND are tributes to his childhood, due to the loving care he heaps upon these misfits.

Broncos is after all, like ND, a celebration of geekdom, and it's a pleasure to be made to identify with such a pleasant, well-meaning hero. Even the villain here is a pretty nice fellow; there are no bad guys, actually. Just a bunch of very bored semi-rural small-town folks clutching at whatever straws come their way. Hess keeps it nice and brief, and while I found it nowhere near as funny as Dynamite, it was amusing enough to be worth watching, especially for Clement. If you've ever read much sci-fi or seen any enjoyably bad sci-fi flicks, you'll love him and this movie, and if you enjoy rooting for underdogs, Gentleman Bronco has your name on it.

My wife and I are in need of some laughs right now, and this film provided them. It was not perfect, and fell far short of genius, but it was indeed fun and weird and silly and quite entertaining. It skewered and poked and prodded, and as long as we don't think about it too carefully (just how often do major authors come to small town Utah?) it did so quite successfully.

And what it did extremely well was laugh with, rather than at, its forlorn set of loser characters. These were all folks on the fringes of life, with enough oddballness (home school? religious? fat? designs ugly clothes???) to make Hollywood want to roast them alive, but other than the one true villain, no one suffered the indignity of any such torment.

I too do not understand the virulent hatred of this film. It was clever, tidy, dead-on in its portrayal of the various weirdos and oddballs it presents, and genuinely funny. Jermaine Clement (I don't know why they made him speak in that odd forced way and couldn't just let him use his natural voice; I felt as Dusty did when hearing his voice replaced in his screen debut--what for?) was a perfect choice for a pompous and self-important jerk, and his scene on naming the characters was a hoot. Worth the price of admission alone, and a clever send up of science fiction as well.

4066778,4,B003498RT0,"From the creators of ""Napoleon Dynamite"" and ""Nacho Libre"" comes a new comedy from husband and wife team - Jared and Jerusha Hess titled ""Gentlemen Broncos"".  The film features cinematography by Munn Powell (""The Sasquatch Team"", ""Napoleon Dynamite"") and music composed by David Wingo (""George Washington"", ""Snow Angels"", ""All the Real Girls"").

VIDEO:

""Gentlemen Broncos"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (widescreen - 1:85:1).  The film does showcase quite a bit of detail from the skin pores and beard of Jermaine Clement, the leather jack and even the vibrancy of certain outdoor scenes, especially during the sci-fi segments of ""Yeast Lords"".  AVC is @33MBPS, skin tones are natural, blacks are nice and deep.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

This is where ""Gentlemen Broncos"" shines.  Featured in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and Spanish and French 5.1 Dolby Digital, for the most part, the film is dialogue and musically driven but during the ""Yeast Lords"" segments, there is actually a good number of sound effects from laser shots to Bronco destroying the opposition.  There is also a scene where Benjamin and his mother are caught in a car while Don Carlos is shooting at them.

So, for a film that is pretty much dialogue and musical driven, there are spurts of action sequences in which the surrounds and rear surrounds are used. But those sci-fi segments are not so long.  So, ""Gentlemen Broncos"" is a bit of mix bag when it comes to audio but for the most part, audio is clear and understandable and music ranges from a few popular tracks to schmaltzy '80s-like ballads.

Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Gentlemen Broncos"" comes with the following special features in High Definition with English Stereo:

  * Audio Commentary by Writer Jared Hess, Writer Jerusha Hess and Director of Photography Munn Powell - Both Jared and Jerusha have fun with the commentary and keeping it fun and hilarious.  From Jared's appreciation of ""Star Trek"" and discussion of ideas being pitched around and setting up various scenes and what went on behind-the-scenes.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Gentlemen Broncos"" didn't do well in the theater and because the general consensus of the reviews were negative, it didn't receive a national release.  But the film has this quality similar to ""Napoleon Dynamite"" of taking that small town look and making the characters looks as if they are somewhat behind on the times, especially when it comes to clothing and fashion styles.

I did find Michael Angarano's performance as the awkward Benjamin Purvis to be quite interesting.  Benjamin is a normal kid but was brought up with not much money and thus he eats vegetables and his popcorn ball.  Kudos to Jennifer Coolidge who plays Benjamin's mother Judith because as you'll see on the special features, she did a lot of improvisational scenes that even surprised the film crew when it came to dialogue.  Jemaine Clement as Ronald Chevalier also did his fine share of improv.  As for Sam Rockwell, I was surprised he took this role as Bronco/Brutus but needless to say, he adds star power to this film.

But it's the characters that surround him that just seems way bit surreal.

From his other Judith who just creates the ugliest fashion designs that seem very bad polyester 70-ish mixed with ""I Dream of Jeannie"" and ""Princess Leia""; Dusty who seems like Napoleon Dynamite and likes to use a blow dart which he mixes his concoction with his own feces, Tabitha who tries to use her sexuality to get what she wants and then Lonnie Donaho who embodies the strange and freaky guy with a bad '90s hairdo and his outstretched mouth (I will say that after watching Hector Jimenez in ""Nacho Libre"", I was looking forward to seeing how he would be used in this film).  In some way, one can easily mistake this film as taking place in the '80s if not for Chevalier's bluetooth headpiece.

For me, coming into this film, I was expecting the similar humor and craziness of ""Napoleon Dynamite"" but was hoping for a more entertaining film like ""Nacho Libre"" which I enjoyed.  For the most part, the awkwardness, bad fashion style and bad music (with the exception of the ending theme - ""Carry on My Wayward Son"" by Kansas) are integrated into this film and I found the film to be much more gratifying as a whole, unlike ""Napoleon Dynamite"" (which I enjoyed only the first half of the film) when comparing the two.

I suppose one can come into a Hess film in the same manner as when you go watch a Judd Apatow or Happy Madison film.  It's comedy that will have its share of immaturity, bad jokes and but at the same time, you either love it or hate it.  I'm used to these films and if I'm entertained for an hour and half, then the film has done its job.

After watching ""Gentlemen Broncos"", by no means is the film anywhere near being a very good movie but for an awkward comedy,  there were a good number of immature, dumb and even a disgusting scenes (one which included a vomit kissing scene), but no matter how embarrassing those scenes were,  I felt it worked with this film.

As for the Blu-ray, Twentieth Century Fox did a good job on the picture quality and it's audio (especially during the sci-fi segments) and there are a good number of special features included.

If you have enjoyed Jared and Jerusha Hess' previous films, you more than likely will enjoy ""Gentlemen Broncos"".  I'm pretty open to these type of films and no matter how silly or awkward, I was entertained by the film.  It's not as quirky as ""Napoleon Dynamite"" but it does have its share of awkwardness and hilarious moments. And if you like the style of comedy of the Hess's previous films such as ""Napoleon Dynamite"" and ""Nacho Libre""...then ""Gentlemen Broncos"" is definitely for you.",1268179200,4,6689,4.829675153643547
4066779,5,B003498RT0,"So many reviews are giving this movie a terrible wrap, and in my opinion, they are completely wrong. I was laughing constantly throughout the entirety of this movie. This beats Nacho Libre and Napoleon Dynamite by far and I doubt that Hess can beat this one. I would not hesitate to recommend this movie. I do realize that not everybody can appreciate this type of humor, but at least give it the chance. I think  you will  be pleasantly surprised.",1268092800,,448,4.5875
4066780,4,B003498RT0,"In Jared Hess's third film, Micheal Angarano starts as Benjamin, a home schooled Sci-fi writer who takes a fateful trip to ""Cletus Fest"" a sci-fi writers convention filled with weirdos and oddballs. At Cletus fest, Benjamin submits his prized work ""Yeast Lords"" in a contest that will be judged by a panel of writers that includes his hero Ronald Chevalier(Jermaine Clement). Benjamin's life get turned upside down when Chevalier steals ""Yeast Lords"" for his own and turns its macho protagonist ""Bronco"" into a transvestite named ""Brutus"". Benjamin must now try to expose Chevalier and get credit for his masterwork, overcoming obstacles and meeting strange characters along the way.  I thought ""Gentlemen Broncos"" was hilarious. Jermaine Clement is perfect as Chevalier and gets the sci-fi intellectual type down pact. Chevalier explaining to a group of young sci-fi writers how to properly name their lead characters is one of the best scenes in the film. Sam Rockwell adds the funniest performance of his career as the avenging yeast lord Bronco, a roll I'm sure he thought was ridiculous when he read the script but decided to have fun with anyway. Though the film is hilarious, it rides a fine line between being hilarious and being just plain stupid. When I watched Bronco fire heat seeking missiles off his battle stag I thought to myself ""okay, that's just dumb"" but I decided to laugh anyway. That's kind of how the movie is, Just go with it and enjoy.",1268092800,2,1461,4.963265306122449
4066781,2,B003498RT0,"When GB didn't make it to theaters I thought it was just mishandled by Fox marketing, then I found out it was mishandled by the director.

Good:
-Mike White as Dusty. Essentially a Napoleon clone, but if the movie had been about this ""Guardian Angel"" it would have been much more enjoyable.
-The very effeminate character of Brutus was wonderfully performed and hilarious to behold in the book/fantasy sequences.
-Chevalier had a unique and off-beat accent, but was given few opportunities to use it to induce laughter.
-The last 20 minutes contained some funny situations, but could in no way save the film from itself.

Bad:
-BATHROOM HUMOR! Seriously, this movie could not go 5 minutes with mentioning or showing fecal matter, gonads, mammary cannons or vomit.
-Attempts at quirky character behavior were much too obvious and heavy handed to even cause a giggle of the ""what a weird-o"" variety.
-Sam Rockwell's Bronco was just a sad, lifeless, hick stereotype.
-Hector Jimenez, who was wonderful as Esqueleto in Nacho Libre, but is terribly annoying throughout this story with his stupid lip pout/curl face.
-The main character of Benjamin is absolutely without any type of quirk or character trait to make him even noticeable in the story. He's practically invisible! He exists simply to attract the strange supporting players and move the plot along, but provides no interest at all the the audience.

I could keep going, but hopefully this review explains how disappointed I was with this movie. When it was playing at only one theater in Los Angeles for a week I actually considered driving out from Arizona just to see it, but now I am so glad I didn't. What a waste.

Jared Hess, redeem yourself. Give us something worthy of your quirky talents.",1268006400,6,1754,4.91554054054054
