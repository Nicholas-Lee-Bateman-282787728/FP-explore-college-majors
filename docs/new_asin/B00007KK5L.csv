7977490,5,B00007KK5L,I wanted Wish Upon A Star since my sister and I used to watch it constantly so when I found this I was stoked! I wish it wasn't a double pack but a movie is a movie and it shipped very fast!,1380931200,,190,3.5476190476190474
7977491,5,B00007KK5L,"I bought this for Wish Upon A Star, which is a fun and magical movie that stars Katherine Heigl and Danielle Harris as 2 sisters who's lives transform after making a wish on a shooting star. It's really a fun movie.  Little Secrets is also a good movie, about a girl who's an up and coming violinist who has a neighborhood business, keeping secrets, but when she finally tells one secret, to learn another secret,  she finds the pressures of keeping those secrets, starts messing with her personal life, and she learns keeping secrets isn't always the best way to deal with things.",1352505600,,581,4.631067961165049
7977492,5,B00007KK5L,"We have three girls (ages 10, 8, and 7) who loved these films. The 7 year old was inspired to take violin lessons after watching Little Secrets several times. Little Secrets came with a CD of the soundtrack, which was inspiring. These are definitely 'girls' films, but I'm the Dad and I thoroughly enjoyed watching them with the girls. Most families will enjoy them. Highly recommended!",1147219200,5,386,4.863636363636363
