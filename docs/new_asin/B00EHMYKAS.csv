8605338,5,B00EHMYKAS,love all the national geographic DVD I get,1490313600,,42,4.375
8605339,5,B00EHMYKAS,"Not quite as good as the very best documentaries, but close enough. The narration/soundtrack could be a bit classier, and there should be a blu-ray version.",1405382400,,156,5.038461538461538
8605340,5,B00EHMYKAS,Saw it on TV recently and was very impressed by the footage and commentary (I collect nature videos) - the cameras get very close and personal (ex. one is apparently on an eagle) and the commentary is very deep/interesting (ex. this is the 20th generation of arctic fox to use this burrow:).  My 7 year old son who has trouble sitting thru most nature videos asks to watch this one.,1391644800,3,382,4.457142857142857
