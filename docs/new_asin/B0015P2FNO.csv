3146472,5,B0015P2FNO,"Adapting a novel is no simple task. Having read the book by Robert Whitlow I must say I am truly impressed. Is it exactly the same as the book? No, but it captures the heart of the book's message and I left the theater satisfied from a thrilling tale of good versus evil.

Perhaps even more impressive is the ""production value"" of the picture. Often low-budget films can really look cheap on screen only to be sent crashing and burning by even cheaper acting. Malcolm McDowell and Chuck Carrington lead the way for an ensemble cast of characters that truly captures the ""Old-Money, Deep South"" of Charleston. I was particularly impressed with scenes by Pat Hingle (of Gunsmoke fame, as well as Batman) and Will Patton which provided the most touching moments in the film.

I was always concerned that this movie would end up preaching to the audience (like most movies I have seen of this genre). The List is not that movie. A few of the characters talk about their faith and their belief in prayer but it is just a part of who those people are in the greater story of The List. It was nice to see someone on-screen portrayed as a selfless, compassionate human willing to sacrifice themselves for others WITHOUT TURNING TO VIOLENCE (a rare character in Hollywood).

So grab some popcorn and a coke--pull up a chair-- and enjoy this fantastic little Indie- flick!!",1208476800,32,1363,4.647302904564316

3146486,4,B0015P2FNO,"I liked this movie even though the climax was a bit weak. Without explicitly saying it, ""The List"" is really a satanic cult forged by the blood of men who gave their souls to the devil in order gain power and prosperity.  I was not expecting the Christian element, but was pleasantly surprised. This movie shows the power of God through conquering evil. Prayer and faith are key elements to the story. Redemption is also an element. Even though humans can make horrible mistakes, God hold the power to redeem.  He can turn what is hopeless into victory if we give our lives to Him.

3146570,2,B0015P2FNO,"an interesting film and according to Google research; theatrical showings were limited to select states in the south.

It seems to me that the reason for this was purely cultural as there are many elements of this movie which would be alien and even distasteful to those who would be offended by reenactments of confederate/union battles and the like. there are others like myself, whose ancestors came over form ""the old country"" to Ellis Island, for whom many aspects of the ""war between the states"" and even subtle occidental modes of thought and speech still remain an intangible obscurity and are limited exclusively to the world of academia, old Hollywood movies and documentaries by Ken Burns.

Aside from that, there are predictable similarities between this and the Gena Rowlands film ""The Skeleton Key"".
Malcolm McDowell delivers an adequate performance as the head of a Satanic like ""old south"" secret society, however, I prefer his role as a celebrated Maestro in the HBO series ""Mozart in The Jungle"".

The supporting actors deliver satisfying performances, although the overall plot is rather simplistic and formulaic.
This actually comes off as a ""made for television"" production which I assumed it was at first, until a Google search provided more detailed information about the production.

There is a strong thread that runs throughout the film about the ""power of prayer"" vs. ""evil"" which I found rather boring and disappointingly pedestrian; qualities unworthy of the talents of an actor like Malcolm McDowell.",1488240000,5,1530,5.2073170731707314

0I'd really like to rate this one better, but I think I probably gave it one star too many as it is. The production values are good, as is the cast, which features some respectable star power in the form of Malcolm McDowell and some great veteran character actors you're sure to recognize, even if you may not know their names. Anyway, for all the build up about ""the list"" and the power it has, we're left to scratch our heads and wonder precisely what that power is and how it works, and WHY. Apparently, ""the list"" has the power to kill, at least when its mysterious powers are summoned by placing one's thumb over the bloody thumbprint initiates are required to place over their signature after signing ""the list."" We're also left to wonder exactly why the power of ""the list"" can be so easily broken when it's been repeatedly described as having such a potent force behind it. Apparently, the spell, if you want to call it that, is released if you simply yell at the guy who cast it. That's easy!

Too many questions left unanswered, including one that doesn't even have anything to do with the apparently supernatural force behind ""the list."" One can easily understand why a group of wealthy Southerners might seek to band together to hide and protect their assets, but sneaking them out of the country and investing them in foreign deposits seems good enough to me. Why go so far as to make a financial arrangement into a pact with the Devil, or whom or whatever gives ""the list"" it's eerie power? No wonder that one guy didn't want to sign it.

3146657,1,B0015P2FNO,"THE LIST might have been a good movie if the producers could have figured out what kind of movie this was supposed to be. It starts out like a John Grisham novel, makes a sharp left into Stephen King territory, and ends up being a commercial for TV evangelism. Described as a ""supernatural thriller"" it lacks thrills.

Renny Jacobson is the ""104th lawyer out of 104"" at his Firm. His estranged father dies, leaving Renny nothing of his $22,000,000 fortune. Nevertheless, Renny's father leaves instructions regarding ""The List"" and ""The Covenant of South Carolina."" Not long after, Renny is invited to a Board Meeting of this mysterious group, which turns out to be the Original Good Ol' Boys Club.

So far, so good. The old men of the Covenant, all descendants of a group that spirited away the Confederacy's precious metals, consider themselves the Masters of The World. Renny really doesn't fit in. Neither does Renny's friend, another young new member. Neither does Renny's girlfriend, the last daughter of her family line, mistakenly invited because the Covenant members thought she was a ""Joseph"" not a ""Josephine"". In short order, ""Jo"" is kicked out of the group and falls ill. Renny's friend dies of an apparent heatstroke during a Civil War re-enactment.

This is where THE LIST derails. It soon turns out that the Chairman of the Board has dark arcane powers and is using them to rearrange the world to his liking. Renny soon finds himself disbarred, broke, and friendless. In desperation, he turns to his (African-American) Nanny for help. Suddenly, THE LIST espouses Muscular Fundamentalist Christianity as an anodyne to the ills caused by the Covenant members. All this drama fizzles at the endpoint, with Renny shouting, ""It's over!"" and stalking out of the Boardroom.

Thank God it's over.

THE LIST markets itself to a general audience, so I felt rather offended to be force-fed a Bible Studies course when I wasn't expecting one. I already went to Sunday School, thanks, and the corny melange of elements that make up this milquetoast tale of Good versus Evil didn't do credit to either.

I was intensely disappointed. I had no clue from the blurb on the packaging that this was a propaganda movie for Christian mysticism.

I should have looked more closely at the Special Features, because if I had, I'd have realised that the legend ""DISCOVER THE POWER"", printed in big bold letters next to the barcode, was biblespeak for ""Discover The Power Of Prayer,"" and been forewarned.

For anyone else who is an avid McDowell fan, but whose ability to suspend disbelief is limited to the realms of science fiction, surrealism, and reasonably inventive fantasy or horror, my advice is to just watch the quite innocuous first 43 minutes of this movie, to the point of the Civil War reenactment, and stop there. This would be while you are still able to think: ""What is everyone talking about? This is quite a decent movie!""

Pretend that this was as far as they got in making the film, or that you watched the entire movie but had a fortunate bout of memory loss. Any excuse. Then make up some possible continuation and ending for the story out of your own imagination.

It is also predominantly a Christian morality tale about unchecked ambition, spiritual warfare, self-sacrifice, redemption and the power of prayer.  These latter elements will be lost on many viewers, although from a Christian perspective it carries a refreshing if cautionary message.  Even so, it tends to get a little smarmy toward the end.

As to the production itself, Chuck Carrington and Hilarie Burton were passable in the lead roles, with Malcolm McDowell doing yeoman's work as the devilishly charming pseudo-gentleman Desmond Larochette.  Most of the supporting acting was so-so, with the Mrs. Stokes character seeming to me to be a bit caricatured.  The storyline was at least engaging if not entirely credible, but one wonders why Jo never seemed to have anywhere else to be but by Renny's side.  Overall, for Christian viewers this would probably rate a B or B-, whereas non-Christian viewers would probably give it a high D or low C.

3146672,2,B0015P2FNO,"My impression before seeing ""The List"" was that it's a thriller. It is, in fact a mix of Christian drama, occult/supernatural horror and romance. And the combination doesn't work. It doesn't work as a thriller because it completely lacks suspense.

The supernatural elements don't work because there's no understandable logic to them and they only appear towards the end of the movie, with no hint beforehand that there was anything supernatural about the secret society that Renny, the main character, has joined. And speaking of Renny, he's just not a very nice guy who spends most of his time whining about money. It's hard to identify with or care for him very much. And Chuck Carrington is not a very good leading man.

And while the movie tries to be an inspirational movie, there's almost no character development that feels convincing. Usually in such movies, we get to follow the character's change of heart. In ""The List"", Renny just suddenly appears to have become a Christian for no particular reason, and the same goes for the romance. We don't see Renny and Jo fall in love; they're just suddenly a couple.

All in all, the movie is much too boring. It's very slow and never made me interested. A weak two star rating thanks to the great performance of Malcolm McDowell and the other old men on ""the list"".",1217548800,13,1320,4.755458515283843

3146674,2,B0015P2FNO,"Based on the novel by Robert Whitlow, The List is a suspense story about a young lawyer named Renny and his involvement with a secretive investment brotherhood known as The Covenant List of South Carolina, Ltd.  As he tries to escape the financial and spiritual domination of this mysterious group, he falls in love with a young woman named Jo, and learns some lessons about the power of prayer along the way.

When I reviewed the novel (also a two-star effort IMO), my primary peeves were the fact that the story's middle was bogged down by Renny & Jo's romance, and that Renny's ""conversion"" to Christianity was a very weak presentation of the Gospel.  I was curious to see if these flaws would be addressed with a more tightly-written screenplay.  The answer is both yes and no.

The book-to-screen translation did eliminate the saggy middle of the novel, but I think they actually cut too much, boiling Renny and Jo's love story down to one or two brief scenes.  The story as told here seems rushed; the slow parts of the book are tightened up, but everything else got curtailed too, even the good parts.  Frankly, if I hadn't read the book I'm not sure how much of the story I would have grasped.  Perhaps budgetary restraints made them keep the film short, but the resulting screenplay only hits the highlights of the book.

Though I hardly thought it possible, Renny's ""conversion"" is even weaker here than in the book.  He just sits in a church, crying and staring at a statue of Jesus.  There's no Gospel at all!  There are some good spiritual lessons about the power of faith and prayer, but the choppy storytelling weakens the effectiveness of the message.

The production values are excellent, and the performances are good as well, especially the actress who plays Mama A.  The overall casting was excellent, too.  I did wish that the motivations of the villainous Desmond had been made clearer; sometimes he seems to want to help Renny, but then he turns around and stabs him in the back.  Also, unlike the book, the movie ends with his fate unresolved!  The source of his supernatural abilities is never made clear either -- he just seems like a bad guy with some kind of unexplained spooky power.

Bottom line, despite a good cast and production values, the sketchy storytelling make The List a movie to scratch from YOUR list.",1216512000,22,2343,4.687041564792176

Renny learns that his father has left his entire estate to charity, leaving little more than a mystery for Renny to filter through to find his true inheritance. A key to a small deposit box containing a tape and a book are just the beginning. Renny follows clues that lead him to a group of gentlemen who form what is called the Covenant List of South Carolina, Ltd.

On his way there Renny encounters Jo Johnston (Hilarie Burton), a young lady on the way to the same meeting. With her car broken down, she catches a ride with Renny to the meeting of this organization.

They arrive to be greeted by Desmond Larochette (Malcolm McDowell), the head of the group who oozes with Southern grace. Treated royally, they are offered a chance to rest before the big meeting that night.

At dinner they discuss very little about the group as well as terms of joining. Once dinner finishes, they let Jo know that they had no idea she was a woman and that this is an all male club. Stripped of her mysterious inheritance and defended by Renny, Jo is asked to leave the meeting and Renny learns the truth about the group.

The gentlemen of Covenant List are all highly placed members of their communities. A member of each of the families represented has been a part of the Covenant since its inception 140 years earlier. And the secret behind ""the List"" is more about power than it is about mere wealth.

Power struggles between members manipulating Renny from the beginning do little more than strip him of what was potentially a vast fortune. Determined to claim what is his and to set things straight, Renny does little more than play into the hands of these southern gents, in the process placing himself and Jo in grave danger.

But the power offered here is not simply an earthly one. Metaphysical moments bring us to the fact that more than earthly solutions are powered by ""the list"". And in searching for answers, Renny finds more than his will tested. He discovers his faith not only tested but brought forth to give him more power than the list could ever have.

Does he confront the members of the Covenant? Does he straighten things out? Does he save Jo? All is revealed by the films end.

There is much to like about THE LIST. For one, the story involves more than simple good guy bad guy themes, instead focusing on the results of falling for temptation. The lire of power and wealth can be great, but they grant things only found here on earth and less on a spiritual plain. Renny's quest for answers results in more than wealth.

That being said, the film does offer a slower pace than most, at times causing the viewer to reach for the remote to find out just how much time is left of the film. The story may be good, the execution done well, but that doesn't increase the pace.

The acting is top notch, with McDowell offering one of his best performances. It's sad to see an actor of McDowell's stature reduced to the B-grade horror films he's done of late. This movie gives him a chance to shine once more, exuding a calm, cool and calculating bad guy.

Other supporting roles are well done by all involved. Perhaps the weakest link acting wise here is lead actor Carrington. His southern accent at times seems over the top and his subtleness is greatly lacking. But he does show potential. As for Burton, she's become somewhat of a star in her own right in the TV series ONE TREE HILL. Having never watched the show she was a new face to me in this film where she did a fine job.

All in all THE LIST is not the greatest movie to come along in a while. It does offer something that few films do these days which is a moral and a message based on faith that seems to be nearly non-existent in movies these days. Let's hope it garners enough interest that more films like these are made.",1214524800,10,4252,4.434615384615385

Both the novel and its movie version beg the question of what is really behind the many ""unique"" decisions that are made by mankind.  If one were to consider the physical side of our universe, and the universal Creator of it all, then along with the inherent good working in the minds and hearts of men and women that is readily apparent and understandably assignable to God; then in opposition, there must be corresponding evil also working in the minds of man and womankind.  This story submits, and I agree, that evil can be overcome by the prayer of the faithful (and the spoken Word).  Forget what was left out, or that was left in, the fact of the matter is, the book and movie makes the point prayer works:  Blessing or Curse, you choose.  It is difficult to find a well done Christian movie these days.  You will enjoy this one.",1213315200,5,1109,4.323671497584541
3146681,4,B0015P2FNO,"The List, based on the first novel by best-selling Christian fiction writer Robert Whitlow, debuts on DVD June 10th from Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment's faith-based label Fox Faith.  It coincides with the release of his latest novel, Deeper Water.  In a world of secrets where evil has reigned for over a hundred years, there lives a treacherous blood covenant and vast fortune guarded by a dark prophecy that will change the life of one man forever in the gripping suspense drama, The List.  It features screen legend Malcolm McDowel (A Clockwork Orange), Chuck Carrington (""Jag""), Hilarie Burton (""One Tree Hill""), and Will Patton (Rememer the Titans).

After being shaken by the news of his father's mysterious death, Renny Jacobson (Carrington) is mystified to discover that his father has left him nothing but a reference to an obscure entity called ""The Covenant List of South Carolina, Ltd.""  Setting out on a quest to learn the truth, he unvocers a treacherous blood covenant and vast fortune guarded by a dark prophecy that will change his life forever. He meets another descendent of a family bound to the secret society and soon discovers that they are both inheritors of an ancient and sinister secret as well as a vast fortune that is held by it corrupt leader (McDowell).  Having signed the covenant with his own blood, Renny is unprepared to fight the evil forces that now seek to devour everything, and anyone, he holds dear.

This is a taut thriller that keeps the viewer of the edge of her or his seat.  There's little rest for anyone watching until the final moments of the film when truth prevails and the real secrets come to the surface.  It's a heatbeating tour de force as Renny unravels the mystery surrounding the list.  You'll enjoy this film as much as I did from start to finish.  It's a hold-your-breath tour into the unknown.

Highlighted by DVD features including audio commentary by producer/writer/director Gary Wheeler and actress Hilarie Burton, a Power of Prayer featurette, deleted scenes and additional DVD Bible study guide content.  The 108-minute DVD is in Dolby surround with English and Spanish subtitles, captioned and in widescreen format.  Suggested retail price:  $26.98 USD.",1212883200,5,2234,5.016260162601626
3146682,5,B0015P2FNO,"I watched this movie yesterday with my two teenage sons and all three of us enjoyed it immensely.  Both boys are history buffs, so the opening scene set during the Civil War era was the ""hook"" they needed to get them involved in the film.  We have not read the original book upon which the script is based, so I'm unable to comment on its relevance to the original source material.

The movie is action packed with a compelling plot line that will keep you glued to the screen.  I felt that acting was good, but my boys were slightly put off by the acting of Renny's caretaker - a portrayal I felt was heartfelt but that the boys found over the top.  The setting of the film is simply breathtaking and the scenery was beautifully captured by the filmmakers.

The faith message of this film is subtle - it's obvious intention is to point to the fact that a life centered in Christ is the ultimate source of  happiness in this world.  But the film's action packed plot unfolds in a manner that keeps the movie from feeling at all preachy or overly religious.

We loved Renny's portrayal and that of the sweetly sinister Desmond Larochette.  The film's conclusion was a very satisfying resolution, but it was also very interesting to watch the deleted scenes in the Special Features and contemplate alternate endings.  The film sparked a wonderful family discussion.  This is one I'd definitely recommend to families with older children.  Due to some intense scenes with supernatural elements, I would not recommend this film for young children despite its PG rating.",1212537600,11,1564,4.684981684981685
3380969,5,B0015P2FNO,"Adapting a novel is no simple task. Having read the book by Robert Whitlow I must say I am truly impressed. Is it exactly the same as the book? No, but it captures the heart of the book's message and I left the theater satisfied from a thrilling tale of good versus evil.

Perhaps even more impressive is the ""production value"" of the picture. Often low-budget films can really look cheap on screen only to be sent crashing and burning by even cheaper acting. Malcolm McDowell and Chuck Carrington lead the way for an ensemble cast of characters that truly captures the ""Old-Money, Deep South"" of Charleston. I was particularly impressed with scenes by Pat Hingle (of Gunsmoke fame, as well as Batman) and Will Patton which provided the most touching moments in the film.

I was always concerned that this movie would end up preaching to the audience (like most movies I have seen of this genre). The List is not that movie. A few of the characters talk about their faith and their belief in prayer but it is just a part of who those people are in the greater story of The List. It was nice to see someone on-screen portrayed as a selfless, compassionate human willing to sacrifice themselves for others WITHOUT TURNING TO VIOLENCE (a rare character in Hollywood).

It seems to me that the reason for this was purely cultural as there are many elements of this movie which would be alien and even distasteful to those who would be offended by reenactments of confederate/union battles and the like. there are others like myself, whose ancestors came over form ""the old country"" to Ellis Island, for whom many aspects of the ""war between the states"" and even subtle occidental modes of thought and speech still remain an intangible obscurity and are limited exclusively to the world of academia, old Hollywood movies and documentaries by Ken Burns.

Aside from that, there are predictable similarities between this and the Gena Rowlands film ""The Skeleton Key"".
Malcolm McDowell delivers an adequate performance as the head of a Satanic like ""old south"" secret society, however, I prefer his role as a celebrated Maestro in the HBO series ""Mozart in The Jungle"".

The supporting actors deliver satisfying performances, although the overall plot is rather simplistic and formulaic.
This actually comes off as a ""made for television"" production which I assumed it was at first, until a Google search provided more detailed information about the production.

Apparently, ""the list"" has the power to kill, at least when its mysterious powers are summoned by placing one's thumb over the bloody thumbprint initiates are required to place over their signature after signing ""the list."" We're also left to wonder exactly why the power of ""the list"" can be so easily broken when it's been repeatedly described as having such a potent force behind it. Apparently, the spell, if you want to call it that, is released if you simply yell at the guy who cast it. That's easy!

Too many questions left unanswered, including one that doesn't even have anything to do with the apparently supernatural force behind ""the list."" One can easily understand why a group of wealthy Southerners might seek to band together to hide and protect their assets, but sneaking them out of the country and investing them in foreign deposits seems good enough to me. Why go so far as to make a financial arrangement into a pact with the Devil, or whom or whatever gives ""the list"" it's eerie power? No wonder that one guy didn't want to sign it.

3381154,1,B0015P2FNO,"THE LIST might have been a good movie if the producers could have figured out what kind of movie this was supposed to be. It starts out like a John Grisham novel, makes a sharp left into Stephen King territory, and ends up being a commercial for TV evangelism. Described as a ""supernatural thriller"" it lacks thrills.

Renny Jacobson is the ""104th lawyer out of 104"" at his Firm. His estranged father dies, leaving Renny nothing of his $22,000,000 fortune. Nevertheless, Renny's father leaves instructions regarding ""The List"" and ""The Covenant of South Carolina."" Not long after, Renny is invited to a Board Meeting of this mysterious group, which turns out to be the Original Good Ol' Boys Club.

So far, so good. The old men of the Covenant, all descendants of a group that spirited away the Confederacy's precious metals, consider themselves the Masters of The World. Renny really doesn't fit in. Neither does Renny's friend, another young new member. Neither does Renny's girlfriend, the last daughter of her family line, mistakenly invited because the Covenant members thought she was a ""Joseph"" not a ""Josephine"". In short order, ""Jo"" is kicked out of the group and falls ill. Renny's friend dies of an apparent heatstroke during a Civil War re-enactment.

This is where THE LIST derails. It soon turns out that the Chairman of the Board has dark arcane powers and is using them to rearrange the world to his liking. Renny soon finds himself disbarred, broke, and friendless. In desperation, he turns to his (African-American) Nanny for help. Suddenly, THE LIST espouses Muscular Fundamentalist Christianity as an anodyne to the ills caused by the Covenant members. All this drama fizzles at the endpoint, with Renny shouting, ""It's over!"" and stalking out of the Boardroom.

Thank God it's over.

THE LIST markets itself to a general audience, so I felt rather offended to be force-fed a Bible Studies course when I wasn't expecting one. I already went to Sunday School, thanks, and the corny melange of elements that make up this milquetoast tale of Good versus Evil didn't do credit to either.

I was intensely disappointed. I had no clue from the blurb on the packaging that this was a propaganda movie for Christian mysticism.

I should have looked more closely at the Special Features, because if I had, I'd have realised that the legend ""DISCOVER THE POWER"", printed in big bold letters next to the barcode, was biblespeak for ""Discover The Power Of Prayer,"" and been forewarned.

For anyone else who is an avid McDowell fan, but whose ability to suspend disbelief is limited to the realms of science fiction, surrealism, and reasonably inventive fantasy or horror, my advice is to just watch the quite innocuous first 43 minutes of this movie, to the point of the Civil War reenactment, and stop there. This would be while you are still able to think: ""What is everyone talking about? This is quite a decent movie!""

Pretend that this was as far as they got in making the film, or that you watched the entire movie but had a fortunate bout of memory loss. Any excuse. Then make up some possible continuation and ending for the story out of your own imagination.

It is also predominantly a Christian morality tale about unchecked ambition, spiritual warfare, self-sacrifice, redemption and the power of prayer.  These latter elements will be lost on many viewers, although from a Christian perspective it carries a refreshing if cautionary message.  Even so, it tends to get a little smarmy toward the end.

As to the production itself, Chuck Carrington and Hilarie Burton were passable in the lead roles, with Malcolm McDowell doing yeoman's work as the devilishly charming pseudo-gentleman Desmond Larochette.  Most of the supporting acting was so-so, with the Mrs. Stokes character seeming to me to be a bit caricatured.  The storyline was at least engaging if not entirely credible, but one wonders why Jo never seemed to have anywhere else to be but by Renny's side.

3381169,2,B0015P2FNO,"My impression before seeing ""The List"" was that it's a thriller. It is, in fact a mix of Christian drama, occult/supernatural horror and romance. And the combination doesn't work. It doesn't work as a thriller because it completely lacks suspense.

The supernatural elements don't work because there's no understandable logic to them and they only appear towards the end of the movie, with no hint beforehand that there was anything supernatural about the secret society that Renny, the main character, has joined. And speaking of Renny, he's just not a very nice guy who spends most of his time whining about money. It's hard to identify with or care for him very much. And Chuck Carrington is not a very good leading man.

And while the movie tries to be an inspirational movie, there's almost no character development that feels convincing. Usually in such movies, we get to follow the character's change of heart. In ""The List"", Renny just suddenly appears to have become a Christian for no particular reason, and the same goes for the romance. We don't see Renny and Jo fall in love; they're just suddenly a couple.

All in all, the movie is much too boring. It's very slow and never made me interested. A weak two star rating thanks to the great performance of Malcolm McDowell and the other old men on ""the list"".",1217548800,13,1320,4.755458515283843

3381171,2,B0015P2FNO,"Based on the novel by Robert Whitlow, The List is a suspense story about a young lawyer named Renny and his involvement with a secretive investment brotherhood known as The Covenant List of South Carolina, Ltd.  As he tries to escape the financial and spiritual domination of this mysterious group, he falls in love with a young woman named Jo, and learns some lessons about the power of prayer along the way.

When I reviewed the novel (also a two-star effort IMO), my primary peeves were the fact that the story's middle was bogged down by Renny & Jo's romance, and that Renny's ""conversion"" to Christianity was a very weak presentation of the Gospel.  I was curious to see if these flaws would be addressed with a more tightly-written screenplay.  The answer is both yes and no.

The book-to-screen translation did eliminate the saggy middle of the novel, but I think they actually cut too much, boiling Renny and Jo's love story down to one or two brief scenes.  The story as told here seems rushed; the slow parts of the book are tightened up, but everything else got curtailed too, even the good parts.  Frankly, if I hadn't read the book I'm not sure how much of the story I would have grasped.  Perhaps budgetary restraints made them keep the film short, but the resulting screenplay only hits the highlights of the book.

Though I hardly thought it possible, Renny's ""conversion"" is even weaker here than in the book.  He just sits in a church, crying and staring at a statue of Jesus.  There's no Gospel at all!  There are some good spiritual lessons about the power of faith and prayer, but the choppy storytelling weakens the effectiveness of the message.

The production values are excellent, and the performances are good as well, especially the actress who plays Mama A.  The overall casting was excellent, too.  I did wish that the motivations of the villainous Desmond had been made clearer; sometimes he seems to want to help Renny, but then he turns around and stabs him in the back.  Also, unlike the book, the movie ends with his fate unresolved!  The source of his supernatural abilities is never made clear either -- he just seems like a bad guy with some kind of unexplained spooky power.

Bottom line, despite a good cast and production values, the sketchy storytelling make The List a movie to scratch from YOUR list.",1216512000,22,2343,4.687041564792176

3381175,4,B0015P2FNO,"Not to be confused with THE BUCKET LIST, THE LIST is a movie about conviction and faith. At the same time, it's a thriller in the John Grisham mode that plays its cards straight through to the very end.

Young Renny Jacobson (Chuck Carrington) is a young lawyer with hopes for the future. While working, he receives news of his father's sudden death. Taking a few days off, he heads home to learn of his father's legacy. It's not at all what he expected.

Renny learns that his father has left his entire estate to charity, leaving little more than a mystery for Renny to filter through to find his true inheritance. A key to a small deposit box containing a tape and a book are just the beginning. Renny follows clues that lead him to a group of gentlemen who form what is called the Covenant List of South Carolina, Ltd.

On his way there Renny encounters Jo Johnston (Hilarie Burton), a young lady on the way to the same meeting. With her car broken down, she catches a ride with Renny to the meeting of this organization.

They arrive to be greeted by Desmond Larochette (Malcolm McDowell), the head of the group who oozes with Southern grace. Treated royally, they are offered a chance to rest before the big meeting that night.

At dinner they discuss very little about the group as well as terms of joining. Once dinner finishes, they let Jo know that they had no idea she was a woman and that this is an all male club. Stripped of her mysterious inheritance and defended by Renny, Jo is asked to leave the meeting and Renny learns the truth about the group.

The gentlemen of Covenant List are all highly placed members of their communities. A member of each of the families represented has been a part of the Covenant since its inception 140 years earlier. And the secret behind ""the List"" is more about power than it is about mere wealth.

Power struggles between members manipulating Renny from the beginning do little more than strip him of what was potentially a vast fortune. Determined to claim what is his and to set things straight, Renny does little more than play into the hands of these southern gents, in the process placing himself and Jo in grave danger.

But the power offered here is not simply an earthly one. Metaphysical moments bring us to the fact that more than earthly solutions are powered by ""the list"". And in searching for answers, Renny finds more than his will tested. He discovers his faith not only tested but brought forth to give him more power than the list could ever have.

Does he confront the members of the Covenant? Does he straighten things out? Does he save Jo? All is revealed by the films end.

There is much to like about THE LIST. For one, the story involves more than simple good guy bad guy themes, instead focusing on the results of falling for temptation. The lire of power and wealth can be great, but they grant things only found here on earth and less on a spiritual plain. Renny's quest for answers results in more than wealth.

That being said, the film does offer a slower pace than most, at times causing the viewer to reach for the remote to find out just how much time is left of the film. The story may be good, the execution done well, but that doesn't increase the pace.

The acting is top notch, with McDowell offering one of his best performances. It's sad to see an actor of McDowell's stature reduced to the B-grade horror films he's done of late. This movie gives him a chance to shine once more, exuding a calm, cool and calculating bad guy.

Other supporting roles are well done by all involved. Perhaps the weakest link acting wise here is lead actor Carrington. His southern accent at times seems over the top and his subtleness is greatly lacking. But he does show potential. As for Burton, she's become somewhat of a star in her own right in the TV series ONE TREE HILL. Having never watched the show she was a new face to me in this film where she did a fine job.

All in all THE LIST is not the greatest movie to come along in a while. It does offer something that few films do these days which is a moral and a message based on faith that seems to be nearly non-existent in movies these days. Let's hope it garners enough interest that more films like these are made.",1214524800,10,4252,4.434615384615385

Both the novel and its movie version beg the question of what is really behind the many ""unique"" decisions that are made by mankind.  If one were to consider the physical side of our universe, and the universal Creator of it all, then along with the inherent good working in the minds and hearts of men and women that is readily apparent and understandably assignable to God; then in opposition, there must be corresponding evil also working in the minds of man and womankind.  This story submits, and I agree, that evil can be overcome by the prayer of the faithful (and the spoken Word).  Forget what was left out, or that was left in, the fact of the matter is, the book and movie makes the point prayer works:  Blessing or Curse, you choose.  It is difficult to find a well done Christian movie these days.  You will enjoy this one.",1213315200,5,1109,4.323671497584541

It coincides with the release of his latest novel, Deeper Water.  In a world of secrets where evil has reigned for over a hundred years, there lives a treacherous blood covenant and vast fortune guarded by a dark prophecy that will change the life of one man forever in the gripping suspense drama, The List.  It features screen legend Malcolm McDowel (A Clockwork Orange), Chuck Carrington (""Jag""), Hilarie Burton (""One Tree Hill""), and Will Patton (Rememer the Titans).

After being shaken by the news of his father's mysterious death, Renny Jacobson (Carrington) is mystified to discover that his father has left him nothing but a reference to an obscure entity called ""The Covenant List of South Carolina, Ltd.""  Setting out on a quest to learn the truth, he unvocers a treacherous blood covenant and vast fortune guarded by a dark prophecy that will change his life forever. He meets another descendent of a family bound to the secret society and soon discovers that they are both inheritors of an ancient and sinister secret as well as a vast fortune that is held by it corrupt leader (McDowell).  Having signed the covenant with his own blood, Renny is unprepared to fight the evil forces that now seek to devour everything, and anyone, he holds dear.

This is a taut thriller that keeps the viewer of the edge of her or his seat.  There's little rest for anyone watching until the final moments of the film when truth prevails and the real secrets come to the surface.  It's a heatbeating tour de force as Renny unravels the mystery surrounding the list.  You'll enjoy this film as much as I did from start to finish.  It's a hold-your-breath tour into the unknown.

3381179,5,B0015P2FNO,"I watched this movie yesterday with my two teenage sons and all three of us enjoyed it immensely.  Both boys are history buffs, so the opening scene set during the Civil War era was the ""hook"" they needed to get them involved in the film.  We have not read the original book upon which the script is based, so I'm unable to comment on its relevance to the original source material.

The movie is action packed with a compelling plot line that will keep you glued to the screen.  I felt that acting was good, but my boys were slightly put off by the acting of Renny's caretaker - a portrayal I felt was heartfelt but that the boys found over the top.  The setting of the film is simply breathtaking and the scenery was beautifully captured by the filmmakers.

The faith message of this film is subtle - it's obvious intention is to point to the fact that a life centered in Christ is the ultimate source of  happiness in this world.  But the film's action packed plot unfolds in a manner that keeps the movie from feeling at all preachy or overly religious.

We loved Renny's portrayal and that of the sweetly sinister Desmond Larochette.  The film's conclusion was a very satisfying resolution, but it was also very interesting to watch the deleted scenes in the Special Features and contemplate alternate endings.  The film sparked a wonderful family discussion.  This is one I'd definitely recommend to families with older children.

My husband, who likes faith-based films, laughed from time to time.  The movie was rather hokey. The characters were less than believable.
