2688785,5,B000KF0DF2,"Whenever a film shoots for ""realism,"" it generally opens the door for a predictable set of signifiers: Handheld cameras, real locations, a naturalistic lighting scheme, streetwise dialogue, and tortured Method theatrics. In just two features, Funny Ha Ha and the new Mutual Appreciation, writer-director Andrew Bujalski has reconfigured the language to something much closer to the real thing. His DIY aesthetic and semi-improvisational dialogue has earned him frequent comparison to John Cassavetes, but he doesn't care nearly as much for high-pitched emotion; the characters in his films are awkward and inexpressive to the point where they can't say what they feel, at least not without fumbling around with it first. Mutual Appreciation isn't much more than a refinement of Funny Ha Ha, following a similar group of idle twentysomethings as they struggle with relationship issues and attempt to give their lives some traction. And yet it's equally uncanny to watch, because Bujalski's brand of stylized dialogue sounds genuinely fly-on-the-wall.

The scruffily charismatic Justin Rice stars as a musician who moves to New York just after his band breaks up, which puts him in a weird spot, since he's due to play later in the week. Once he arrives in town, Rice reconnects with his friend Bujalski, a good-natured graduate student, and Bujalski's girlfriend Rachel Clift, to whom Rice begins to develop an unspoken (and, as it happens, mutual) attraction. Meanwhile, Rice finds a champion and more in attractive college radio DJ Seung-min Lee, but gets into trouble when he brings on Lee's brother as his drummer and tries to get some distance from her romantically.

All this intrigue sets up a romantic encounter between Rice and Clift, and a serious rupture in their relationship with Bujalski, but nothing in Mutual Appreciation goes according to the usual script. The scene in which Rice and Clift finally vocalize their feelings for each other is the perfect example of what Bujalski does so well: Any other romantic melodrama would have them bubbling over with passion, but these characters are painfully tentative and believably so, given that they're both betraying someone they care about. What ends up happening between them is completely unexpected, yet entirely true to who they are and to how most caring people would act. But such things rarely happen onscreen, and Bujalski's willingness to follow through makes him a singular talent.",1174176000,3,2454,5.273657289002558
2688786,5,B000KF0DF2,"This movie really resonated with me. Unlike so many films that supposedly depict people of my age interacting, this one was real. The dialogue had all the awkward pauses and weird chuckles that real conversation does. It felt very natural. I identified with these character. It also spoke to me as a 20-something fresh out of school and dealing with the real world and things not being as simple as they once were. This is a wonderfully charming movie. Bujalski has made a film that will certainly not appeal to everyone, but to a certain segment of the population will touch deeply.",1171929600,6,583,4.7254901960784315
2688787,5,B000KF0DF2,"I really really love this movie. The performances are smart and sweet and feel utterly true. And I admire it as a marvel of actual independant artistry in this corrupt, predictable, corporate infested world.",1171756800,5,207,5.117647058823529
2688788,5,B000KF0DF2,"The film had a wallflower quality to it. In fact, I got the sense on many occasions that the method they were employing was to stick a camera in the corner, hit play, get drunk and see what happens (of course, there was no 'hit play'- they filmed in grainy 16 mm black and white). Try to be witty, cool, funny, intelligent, engaging but mostly just have fun and we will worry about it in post-production. All of this though is actually to the director's credit. When the fly-on-the-wall method is done poorly it either seems overly contrived or feels like you are watching an old VHS tape of your 3rd birthday. This has the effect of taking you out of the film. When it is done well it draws you in and makes you feel as if you are there. And being there felt good.

The film has a loose story line but isn't really plot driven. Which is more true to real life. We create narratives and in retrospect can piece events together and establish or create meaning, but life seemingly proceeds in disconnected bursts of energy and happenstance events. This film captures this feeling perfectly - a feeling especially poignant during your 20s.

Also, there is some great acting in this film despite using non-actors.

It should definitely be viewed more than once. The quirks and idiosyncrasies of all the characters will grow on you and many nuances not appreciated during a first viewing will become apparent upon closer inspection.",1171497600,6,1427,4.632411067193676
2688789,5,B000KF0DF2,"I love this movie!  Very happy to get the DVD!  This is definitely a film that deserves repeat viewings.

For those that didn't ""get"" the film, my guess is that their reaction stems from what I found to be quite new and progressive: the film's noticeable lack of surface emotion and heightened drama.  By ""surface,"" I mean ""obvious""; and by ""heigthened,"" I mean ""manufactured.""  The lack of surface emotion (there's plenty of emotion beneath the characters' faces and between the lines if you follow closely) is more than some self-imposed indie style; it is central to part of what the movie's about for me -- it would be the very ""manners"" that this comedy of manners sharply observes.  There's a self-consciousness attached to the characters' emotions, preventing them from being openly expressed.  Any statements of meaning or confessions of feeling are slyly dropped and hidden inside larger conversations of...things like cancer moles or math rock or Pete Seeger.  The emotions are expressed from a protective distance, abstracted with silly metaphors like asymptotes; in fact, many of their conversations sound more like meta-conversations.  This neurotic self-consciousness - fearing the emasculation of being emo - is perfectly realized in the movie's setpiece:  the excruciatingly long after-party, slowly building to the moment the main character is completely emasculated in front of a mirror.  It's funny and it's odd and it pulls off the impossible trick of seeming shapeless and rambling and true-to-life, while revealing itself to be a controlled and authored work of art.  What other filmmaker today can really claim that?

Ah, I remember the good ol' days when Sundance used to herald new and exciting voices in American indie cinema.  Actually, I don't -- I was like 10 or something, doing the Roger Rabbit to C+C Music Factory in my bedroom.  It's been a looooong time since Sundance represented true independent film.  Bujalski's the clear and bright alternative.  You gotta check him out.",1171324800,6,2010,5.192546583850931
2688790,5,B000KF0DF2,"Brilliant.  Definitely one of the best films of the year. Bujalski really hits the nail on the head here with regards to the trials and tribulations of life post-college.  Justin Rice's authentic performance as an aspiring rocker is absolutely hilarious-you find yourself thinking ""I know that guy!""  After seeing this at the theatre, I rushed out to find a copy of Bujalski's first film 'Funny Ha Ha', and was not disappointed there, either-Andrew Bujalski stands out as a refreshing and unique voice in today's cinema-I cannot wait to see what is coming next!",1171324800,4,561,5.010752688172043

2688793,5,B000KF0DF2,"I drove two hours from a small southern Ohio town to see this movie recently in Columbus - it was worth the drive. Ok, I drove to see something different and hoped that this would be good.  Bujalski rubbed up against issues like fidelity, success, honesty and even networking -- but he never dived into much of anything.  Who would have known a movie where people discuss the smell of books would be so entertaining and thought provoking. It was excellent, but could have used a little more editing.  The music was great.",1165795200,7,521,4.580645161290323
2688794,5,B000KF0DF2,"""Do you have a boyfriend?"" asks Alan (Justin Rice), a budding musician who has recently moved to New York, in Andrew Bujalski's wonderful second film, ""Mutual Appreciation.""

""No,"" replies Patricia as they try on wigs. ""But I have eye shadow.""

In the beginning of the most recent American independent film movement, in the late 1980s, early '90s, it seemed there would finally be a place in mainstream cinema for stripped-down, low-budget, honest filmmaking. Spike Lee's ""She's Gotta Have It,"" Richard Linklater's ""Slacker,"" Kevin Smith's ""Clerks"" -- all touched a nerve and became breakout hits, delivering a reality at its core that Hollywood films could not provide.

But true indie cinema never had a chance. It morphed into ""Indiewood,"" wherein independent films now cost millions of dollars, have bankable stars and are funded by professional production companies, then released by a Hollywood studio. Some movement.

Bujalski's idiosyncratic work, however, stubbornly harks back to those early beginnings, and ""Mutual Appreciation"" -- shot on a shoestring, in 16mm black-and-white film and cast with nonprofessional actors, including Bujalski himself -- arrives looking something like a miracle.

It is about a musician, Alan, who moves to New York, sacking out at a friend's apartment, trying half-heartedly to pursue dreams of forming a successful band while steadily trying to avoid getting a real job. At first, a radio DJ (Seung-Min Lee) falls for him, but he is more interested in Ellie (Rachel Clift), a journalist for an underground newspaper who is the girlfriend of his best friend, Lawrence (Bujalski). He might or might not have a shot at a recording contract, but part of Alan's slacker appeal is that he can't seem to decide what he wants; he's just taking life as it comes.

What plot there is springs from character and dialogue, not artificially contrived ""plot points,"" so it seems as if nothing is happening -- except for a smorgasbord of sharp insights about everyday life.

Bujalski's first film, the equally aimless and engrossing ""Funny Ha Ha,"" changed some of the models of indie film distribution. Shot in early 2002, it played at small festivals, was shown on the Sundance Channel -- then received a theatrical release in 2005.

""Mutual Appreciation"" is even better. Bujalski's writing is so good, and every shot and edit seems exactly right. Hopefully, there will always be a place for a film like this on a theater screen, no matter the whims of the marketplace.

8155965,3,B000KF0DF2,"The pace is slow here. The dialogue is full of awkward stumbling, and so is the acting, which I guess was the point. It's a portrayal of post-college angst as the cast of barely 20-somethings stumbles through their not quite adult lives, unsure what to do or say next. Everyone needs a shampoo and hair combing. There's no plot. The indie band sequence is kind of ok, though. This is better than ""Funny Ha Ha"" by the same writer/director, who acts here as the almost jilted boyfriend.

8155966,5,B000KF0DF2,"Alan (real life indie rock star Justin Rice of Bishop Allen) and Ellie sit awkwardly next to one another on his bed. The trouble is that there is palpable chemistry between them, a chemistry that is absent in her relationship with her boyfriend Lawrence, who also happens to be Alan's best friend.
""This feels like ninth grade math class,"" she says and he doesn't get it but goes along anyway.
""Yeah I guess this reminds me of math class too,"" in his always slightly bemused tone.
What she means to say is that you have these lines that converge, but never quite reach.
""Asymptotes,"" he says, ""A - symp - totes.""  She says that's what they are like, those converging lines.
""Yeah,"" he smiles, ""I guess I got that part.""

Lines that never quite converge, trajectories that are never quite fulfilled, people who can never quite say what they mean because it would presume too much, would solidify commitments and presume conventions that none feel they can fully and unironically endorse. In spite of the apparent improvisational feel of Andrew Bujalski's brilliant sophomore film, there is a geometrical motif that runs throughout the film and that helps to lend it a coherence that holds up to repeated viewings. The film opens on two parallel lines, the bodies of Alan and Ellie as they lie down and speak of nothing much on the futon bed that Ellie shares with Lawrence in his apartment. Lawrence arrives and deliberately superimposes himself between them, saying nothing but suggesting a premonition of their asymptotic convergence. The love triangle, which is only belatedly and barely acknowledged by any of them, becomes a circle in the end.

This is a brilliant film, easily the equal in terms of originality and honesty and power of revelation as any of the great indie masterpieces like Stranger than Paradise or Sex, Lies and Videotape or even works by Cassavettes -- in fact it is the raw and improvisational feel of Cassavettes' work that this film resembles most. I think, in many ways, it is a funnier and more spontaneous film than any of these others. At the same time -- and this is true of Cassavettes' work as well -- the appearance of an improvisational and spontaneous approach is the result of a great deal of forethought and planning and careful scripting. Bujalski builds his stories around real life characters and real life conversational styles, but it is modified and tailored carefully.

There are a number of features of this film in particular that indicate this care and attention to detail. The film is shot in rich black and white 16mm film -- and has a texture and range of tonality that you don't see in indie projects shot on video. While it has a documentary feel, with a slightly shaky camera -- the framing is clearly thought out very carefully, and every scene is composed to convey a specific meaning (like the geometrical shots referred to above). There is a very intriguing scene in which Alan and Ellie are in a cafe talking, again about nothing much, but circling around questions that would imply a growing intimacy -- and Ellie's friend shows up and stands between them. The camera shows him arriving but after that (and until he begins to leave) always insistently frames only either Ellie on his left side or Alan on his right excluding the new arrival and shows them reacting to what he says by looking to see how each other is reacting. What is remarkable about this film is that it has such a careful and deliberate structure that feels casual and improvisational -- at least on the first viewing.

One thing Bujalski almost never does is present his characters when they are ""on their game,"" or when they are putting on their professional personas. There are times when we don't speak like these characters do, when we don't hesitate or pause awkwardly -- it is when we know what we are about, when we have a specific agenda and we are clear about our motives or when we are performing a task we understand. Certainly the characters in this film have such moments, and in most films these are the only moments we see of characters -- the classical style of film involves cutting out or eliding all the awkward pauses and focusing on moving the action forward, having every moment be decisive. But Bujalski is not interested in such moments, when we are polished and we have planned out what to say -- and are, effectively, hiding our insecurities and awkwardness behind a mask. He looks to the moments that bring out insecurities, and uncertainties, when one doesn't quite know what to say or do -- and also to the moments when, with friends and lovers, his characters can led their guards down and be dumb and boring and weird and awkward, and he tells his story by connecting together a series of just such moments into a whole whose coherence only appears gradually.

The exception in this film is notable: when Alan goes on stage and begins to sing and play he is in his element, he is confident and shining and having fun, and sounds very good (once again: Alan's character is played by the lead singer of the very fine band Bishop Allen and all of the music is theirs). It is important to the story to show that these characters, who don't quite know what to do with their lives and are insecure in their loves and in their words are not incompetent or lazy or untalented. Alan, who may be the least stable of the three, is a drifter by choice, but an artist by vocation -- his pursuit of music is a drive that he can't let go of without losing something of himself. He dreams of a kind of ideal society, something like the artistic community he believes he is finding in NYC, in which artists could sort of just come together and support one another in their various projects and not let mundane things like commitments and economics get in the way. That is, of course, unrealistic, as Lawrence suggests and as Alan's father never ceases to insist. Still it is a good fantasy, a vision of mutual appreciation, a celebration of both individuality and collaboration. A very fine film.",1196121600,8,6043,4.664165103189493
8155967,4,B000KF0DF2,"Apparently, Bujalski is now part of the ""Mumblecore"" movement. This film along with Funny Ha Ha definitely outshines the movement's other films by Aaron Katz and others. I can't wait to see what Bujalski does next.",1190332800,,214,4.972222222222222

This film received an 88 at Rotten Tomatoes and so I thought it would be really good but it does not deserve such a high score. The film lacked the things most people look for in a movie: comedy, action and drama.  I did not find the characters to be very sympathetic and I pretty much hated Bujalski's character, who seemed like nothing more than a lazy rich kid who wanted to mooch off of his parents for the rest of his life. The film does portray quite well the awkward moments that life can bring but I don't think I want to watch 105 minutes of that. I give it a thumbs down!",1186876800,3,688,4.0962962962962965

8155970,5,B000KF0DF2,"Andrew Bujalski's films capture something very true and very painful about young adult life, yet in a casual, seemingly offhand way.  It's as though, despite the higher education the characters have received, more or less fresh from college, something key is still missing, call it an education of the heart, an education in coming to know and manage and communicate feeling.

Some have compared Bujalski to John Cassavetes.  Their similarity, however, is of a peculiarly inverse kind.  Both depict people assaulted by their emotions.  But while Cassavetes' characters express their emotions violently out into the world, Bujalski's seem to cower in psychic corners, as though trying to hide from the emotional pressures pressing in on them.  You can see their films as case studies in divergent responses to the assaults of emotion.

Bujalski's films, ""Funny Ha Ha"" and ""Mutual Appreciation,"" are lenses into the lives of many young adults today, providing focus and clarity.  If you wish to understand these lives, whether from without or within, see these films.  They will enhance and refine your sympathy.",1181692800,3,1110,5.261363636363637
