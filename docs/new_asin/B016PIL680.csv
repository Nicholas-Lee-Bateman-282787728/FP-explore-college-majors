7479248,4,B016PIL680,"Buyer beware: if after reading the first review concerning Doug Wilson's current ""scandals"" you begin to think ""Douglas Wilson must not be trust worthy""- I urge you to watch the documentary. The film, in part, spotlights the current culture's neglect concerning reasoning and thinking through arguments and what people say. It's easy to accuse someone of something. It's hard work to see if the accuser is correct. Doug has a blog and has addressed this openly for all to see. I urge you to watch the documentary and to use your mind.",1446854400,9,534,4.815217391304348
7479249,5,B016PIL680,"Forget all the contrived, premeditated, diplomatic ""safe"" soundbites and points of view. This film tackles some heavy duty issues HEAD ON. When you're not afraid to make waves and stand boldly on the foundation of your faith, you get films like this.

Not just a bunch of talking heads either, cinematically I really liked how it was shot, cut etc. I dug the music choices used too. It helped it ""keep moving"" so to speak. IMO sometimes documentaries can be a bit slow/boring depending on the topic. Some of the bangin' beats and fast cuts kept me awake to absorb all the ""punch you in the gut"" truth the film is dropping on you.

I would expect a lot of BIG reactions, you're either gonna love it or hate it, depending on which side of the fence you're on. I could see people wanting to cheer and clap, but I could also see someone else wanting to throw something at the screen too lol. Watch it and decide for yourself.",1446768000,6,921,4.411764705882353
7479250,5,B016PIL680,"I was left with eyes wide and mouth hanging open more than once. What really gets me is how people react online to this movie. i quote one Facebook commenter: too bad we can't shoot you all in the face and end your kind..... Society now seems to believe that if you think the ""wrong"" opinion, you cannot be allowed to speak without being hated for it, all while crying ""hate speech"" as they hurl their own hate speech at you. This movie documents a very sobering realization that free speech and the right to disagree are long gone in this country. Wake up, America!",1446768000,7,566,4.4
7479251,5,B016PIL680,"Just watched this. Wowza. It felt like a war documentary fused with over-the-top political satire---but satire it ain't.

You want to matter in the culture war? Be up on the issues here. You want a swathe to cut through all the twisted, hypocritical, self-worshipping garbage about abortion, gay mirage (not a typo), and so-called tolerance? Sharpen your blade with the Free Speech Apocalypse.

You'll watch brave men and women like Douglas Wilson, Kim Davis, and Aaron & Melissa Klein (of Sweet Cakes) stand up to the tolerance buzz saw (yeah, that one) with precisely the kind of winsome moxie that has inspired reformation and revival in years past and countries far and wide.

Join the ranks. You can't go wrong. God will bless this. How? Don't know yet. But He will. Because (spoiler) the good guys always win.

Take 90 minutes. Watch.",1446768000,4,840,4.894366197183099
7479252,4,B016PIL680,"In 2012 Pastor Douglas Wilson gave a public lecture on the contentious topic of sexuality God's way. But it wasn't simply a public lecture: his event took place on the campus of a large university and was advertised well ahead of time, giving campus LGBT groups and their supporters time to arrange protests and arrange to fill the auditorium seats. In addition, this wasn't just any university campus: it was Indiana University, home of the Kinsey Institute, where the infamous sexologist Alfred Kinsey helped launch the Sexual Revolution. For a talk on God's thoughts about sex this was as hostile a setting as could be had.

His talk, and all the hysteria and hoopla that surrounded it, is the centerpiece of director Darren Doanne's new documentary The Free Speech Apocalypse. Doanne uses the event to tackle three related subjects:

1) The intolerance of the Left  As the title suggests, free speech and tolerance are the main topics tackled. Douglas Wilson comes to Indiana to dialogue, but that's not what the Left does. Instead activist students scream and shout: ""We believe in free speech, but this is hate speech!"" Instead of countering his arguments they aim to paint him as an aggressor, and themselves as victims. They go so far as to paint on fake bruises, claiming that this is what will result from Wilson's speech

2) False allegations made about Douglas Wilson  The film is not, primarily, about Wilson  it is about far more than the man  but it is about him too. So when students chant, ""Racist, Sexist, Anti-Gay; Douglas Wilson go away!"" we get to see, in the question and answer period after his speech, how Wilson is able to respond and rebut these accusations.

3) The difference between Left and Right  Wilson notes, ""this is the difference between the conservative mindset and the liberal mindset: The conservative thinks always in terms of tradeoffs. The liberal thinks in terms of solutions. The liberal wants solutions. And he doesn't want to think in term of tradeoffs. He doesn't think there is ever a price tag for what he is advocating."" Liberals demand more and more, not thinking about how someone will have to pay for this. Conservatives are grown up enough to realize there are no perfect solutions  everything comes with a cost.

Other related topics are also tackled, including the American Civil War. In the US it is a near universal belief that this was a good and just war because it ended slavery. But it also resulted in 600,000 dead - that was the tradeoff that liberals don't consider. A conservative might ask (as Wilson has), considering this high cost, might there have been a better, less bloody way to end slavery? After all, everywhere else in the West slavery was ended peacefully. It's a good question, but, as happened to Wilson, one liable to get you labelled a racist and a slavery lover.

American presidential candidate Ted Cruz appears in the film for less than a minute, but his interview highlights how even conservatives and Christians can forget to consider the tradeoffs. Concerning the Civil War he says it ""was absolutely a just war"" but concerning abortion, ""We have the ability to change this, and to change this without a war fought in the streets."" So he understands that war would be an unsatisfactory tradeoff for today, but won't even consider whether that might also have been true for the Civil War.

The topic matter  sexuality God's way vs. the world's way, and tolerance God's way vs. the world's way  means this is a film for mature audiences only. And there are other cautions. The F-bomb is put to regular use by students, and these occurrences are not bleeped out. The one thing I found surprising was the selection, by the director, of some backing music for a ten-second segue that also included multiple f-bombs. That was an unnecessary addition but, fortunately, a very short addition. There are also a few brief shots of homosexuals and others prancing about in short shorts, and one line-drawn diagram shown for a few seconds that includes a depiction of a naked male butt.

This is an enormously ambitious film but because it tries to fit so much in, it might leave viewers exhausted by the time the credits role. But it is worth putting in the effort. Few Christians are both able and willing to beard the liberal lion in his den, and it is fun and encouraging to watch Wilson venture forth. Here we get to see a brave man standing up, outnumbered, but not outmaneuvered because he stands on God's Word.

This film is also a must-see because it shows what is coming and what we are up against. As the Left continues to marginalize Christians, it may well be that in some circumstances no matter what we say or do we will not be able to win the debate. And not because of any weakness in our position, but rather because the other side has no interest in discussing. They'll want to meet our words with their shouts, or their claims of victimhood, or even their fists.

However even then our light can shine. If our words are shouted down, our demeanor can stand in sharp contrast. In Wilson we see a joyful warrior, secure in the knowledge that God has already won. This is how we need to be.",1446422400,13,5183,4.714601769911504
7479253,1,B016PIL680,Doug Wilson may be the most hated preacher in America for a reason. He certainly relishes the title and regards it as an award. There are some valid issues raised in this slick film project however it is unfortunately completely discredited by Wilson's current entanglement in 2 separate scandals involving mishandling of sexual predators in his church. Cruz and Carson will regret having their names tied to it especially in an election year.,1446422400,19,443,5.082191780821918

7479258,2,B016PIL680,"It's not that there are no decent arguments to be made here (the need for constructive dialogue, the dangers of group-think in education), etc... but Wilson and Doane don't seem interested in making it. The repeated use of Orwell's 1984 is particularly amusing given his support of Democratic Socialism.

The college students do themselves no favors, but let's also not pretend that giving a deliberately provocative lecture (did you know laws against polygamy are apparently discriminatory against bisexuals? So says Mr. Wilson) is the same thing as ""trying to have a debate."" Rather than actually speak about the importance of free speech to a healthy political culture or the potential dangers of government over-reach, we get treated to random swipes at feminism (get ready to hear all about the ""swooning couch"") and lengthy montages of people apologizing for putting their feet in their mouths. (God forbid!) Want more? Get set to be spoken down to by several Christian college professors (one gets particularly outraged that gays and others successfully manipulate Christians' natural desire to support the underdog-- really?), sit through random and gratuitous Holocaust footage, watch Wilson plaintively pine for a non-violent solution to slavery (exclusively blaming Lincoln and not, say, the Confederacy that would have never voluntarily ended slavery) and finally, be lectured by Wilson that all non-Christians who benefit from freedom of speech owe religious Christians a big thank you. Fun times.

The best (unintentional) point is made by Wilson about halfway through: ""Language is full of political ramifications... when someone says, 'you hurt my feelings' people take it at face value, but there's an agenda here.""

Indeed, language does have meaning, and there are agendas on all sides. It's unfortunate this film is unlikely to do anything to improve our discourse.

Oh, and a bonus half-star for a great moment where a camera man makes Ted Cruz deeply uncomfortable by asking why he won't support fighting a civil war ""for the unborn.""",1532217600,,2056,5.316923076923077
7479259,4,B016PIL680,"If the film and the the preacher's goal was to promote  freedom of speech,  then this film may help since it documents in graphic detail freedom of speech being impinged upon and silenced in an academic environment.  However, if his main goal is to help people to eventually come closer to God, then his lecture is counterproductive, it would have been better to say  ""God Loves You. Hate the sin but love the sinner"" and stop there, because the speech he gave was just driving his LGBTQ audience farther away from religion. I also think preachers should spend as much time on other Christian issues like love, acceptance, divorce, adultery. The video is a bit choppy and hard to follow at times.",1529020800,,696,4.680327868852459

These perpetual victims dress in black and use violence to silence opinions they disagree with while calling those your attacking Nazis.

A good look behind the scenes, if you will, at America's current ideological Civil War, with some great insights on the topic, and a bit of hope thrown in at the end.  Obvious from the title that this is put together from a Christian perspective, so the views denouncing this fact are a bit disingenuous and silly.  Kind of like complaining a recipe book is all about food.  So obviously, if you have a bias or strong disagreement with the Christian worldview I doubt you will appreciate this documentary very much, though it may be informative for you if you have an open mind.  Editing was a little confusing at times but the content, interviews, and live campus footage outweighs any production/editing deficiencies.

7479268,1,B016PIL680,"Dont waste your time! This movie is little more than propaganda. It started out decently enough but once the director could no longer support his platform, he resorted to personal attacks and utilizing the exact same tactics he was chastising others for employing. The pastors body language alone was enough for me to be skeptical about anything he had to say. He couldn't (or wouldnt?) square himself in front of the camera or interviewer, as if  he was hiding from or behind something. Any claims made about rationality are negated by the fact that he just happened to choose to pontificate about promiscuity and straight marriage on a college campus that is internationally known for conducting studies in human sexuality (never mind that it houses the worlds latgest collection of porn). He knew he was kicking a hornets nest, and its no coincidence that a movie was filmed to document the whole ordeal, hence reducing the work to propaganda.",1524355200,,946,4.949685534591195

It's amazing how thin skinned and hypocritical the speakers featured in this film are shown to be without any commentary about their behavior (only interviews mocking the students and calling them stupid).

The filmmaker does a very poor job hiding his own agenda and that's not a good sign of a documentary filmmaker.

As a side note, people aren't calling Wilson a racist because they disagree with his religious point of view. It's because he heralds American slavery as an era of ""genuine affection between the races"" that will never happen again.

7479291,5,B016PIL680,"Amazing documentary but reprobates are rejected by God and cannot get saved.
Homosexuality is not why they can not be saved. Homosexuality is the result of being a reprobate. Thus it is a symptom of reprobation. One does not cough all the time when they are healthy but when they are sick. Coughing is a symptom of something is wrong. Thus Homosexuality is a symptom of being rejected by God.

Leviticus 20:13King James Version (KJV)
13 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

Now how does the New Testament approach this subject?

Romans 1:25-28King James Version (KJV)
25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.

26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:

27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.

28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;......Romans 1:32King James Version (KJV)
32 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them. Looks to me that Leviticus 20:13 still applies in the NT.

2 Peter 2:6King James Version (KJV)
6 And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;. Looks to me that God has not changed on his view on the sodomites.

2 Peter 2:12King James Version (KJV)
12 But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;. Again we see that Leviticus 20:13 still applies in the NT.

The first time we see the word reprobate is in the Old Testament. Lets see what is said. Jeremiah 6:30King James Version (KJV)
30 Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the Lord hath rejected them. Reprobate means rejected.

2 Timothy 3:7-8King James Version (KJV)
7 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

8 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. Corrupt minds reprobate mind is based on the same thing. Notice the word of God here. ""reprobate concerning the faith"". Meaning that reprobates can not get saved. God gave them over to a reprobate mind and in part of this reprobation is the filthy burning lust for homosexuality.

If you are a reprobate then you are not of Christ. 2 Corinthians 13:5-7King James Version (KJV)
5 Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?

6 But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.

7 Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.",1515024000,,3375,4.55702479338843

They were so busy acting out, that they missed some vital points that came about from the video. This developmental psychologist the university teaches and these students give so much credit. Did they ever connect the dots as to how he got his information. How does on find out if a very young person is a sexual being? Also, one historical misconception. Nazis of the WWII era were not Christians. Hitler was against the Bible and had many of them burned. Hitler's own book, which was a household staple in Nazi Germany included many prayers to himself. Notice I didn't say for. Here is a thought; free speech is best expressed when the words used do not accuse, bully or profane the recipient. Ideas can be shared with dignity and respect. We can also choose to disagree with respect and dignity as well.

7479349,5,B016PIL680,"This was a very interesting and eye opening documentary. Though nothing inherently new, the intolerance and vigilance of many self-proclaimed prophets of liberty, progress, diversity, and tolerance is ever shocking. Several key points of this documentary that has the honesty of declaring it is far from perfect highlight these points.
Douglas Wilson effectively highlights that indeed one of the core issues is that though the left claims to only want certain rights, truthfully they will not stop at anything to go above and beyond that in order to get an affirmation, approval, and confirmation of their bias and point of view. One example of this is the repercussions to Christian business owners that after denying service to a gay couple are being fined $135,000. Many other examples are shown.
Other self-declared advocates of free speech and liberty present at the Q&A of Wilsons talk, more often trying to get off their statements, remarks, and at times insults than actually pursuing dialogue. People rudely interrupting him, going as far as having the audacity of quoting passages of his works without being familiar with the context. This goes hand in hand with the classical taking Holy Scripture out of context. ""Did Jesus say XYZ?"" as if the rest of the Bible was not God's Word.
Aside from the debate about Christian heritage and values, Wilson's illustration of the shortcomings of the Civil War and its repercussions opened to me a whole new perspective I previously was unable to appreciate, as well as giving me deeper understanding of the true conservative position and what it is based on. Very helpful! You can sense his disappointment and maybe frustration with how unfair today's discussions are held, disregarding the need for in depth information and knowledge before speaking up. Many of these people who disagree with Wilson are woefully uninformed and even more woefully unwilling to openly consider perspectives other than their own. Repeated calls for ""logical"" arguments are telltale signs of the lack of attention, while statements like ""I did not listen to most of what you said but I am here to get something off of my chest and ask some random question"" attitudes are saddening and disrespectful.
I am aware of several controversies about Wilson's character, which I think should be discussed at a different venue. Though these may weaken some of his points, I think it is of importance to return to one of the Biblical quotes relayed so out of context by one of the LGBT contenders Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her. While opinions differ and I am the first one to say that I do not agree with everything that has been said and all political positions voiced, I can only commend how in the end Wilson and other contributors bring it full circle back to the one thing that matters most: Though now enlightened, we are all sinners. All of us needed Jesus Christ, who is part of the triune Godhead of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit to come to this world in a human body, uniquely fully human and God and to live the only life on earth that has ever been fully free of sin. He then proceeded to die on the cross for our sin and by making his sacrifice our own and by invoking his sacrifice upon ourselves we can then have access to the Father because Jesus paid the penalty of death for our imperfection. The Gospel is at the center of what is both at stake here and the bigger picture of world history. Though free speech, Christian heritage, and religious liberty and freedom may be declining in this country, in the end God is sovereign over all these things and we will see his kingdom come. He is the only source and author of true love and ultimately will fill everyone who opens himself to this truth with that and much more.",1491004800,4,3823,4.724550898203593

7479352,1,B016PIL680,"I went into this with an open mind. It started like a Michael Moore documentary, but then very quickly we got to the beliefs of the Pastor Doug Wilson thrown at us - and it was pretty apparent from his words that he has no respect for science in any capacity, the women's liberation movement, or the gay rights movement. Then we got exposed to how ridiculous his thought process is when he said the complaints about 2-person marriages of either gender ignore the needs of bisexuals - the laughs in the crowd were audible and well deserved. The man talks about things he LITERALLY knows nothing about.

We're eventually subjected to his band of other religious zealots, interspersed with clips of celebrities apologizing for saying racist, homophobic, or misogynistic things - as though people shouldn't apologize for being offensive, or as if being racist/homophobic/misogynistic should be tolerable and acceptable behavior in America. But he wants us to feel sympathy for the wedding cake bakers who refused to bake a cake for a lesbian couple because of their ""conscience"" and their religious beliefs. Let's be clear here: if a gay couple had done the same thing, and discriminated against a Christian couple (because of Christianities many known flaws and problems, and negative societal impacts), you'd hear far and wide about the ""intolerant Left"" and ""intolerant gays."" But we don't do that. The LGBTQ community is successful without needing to discriminate against the people who seek to destroy us - but maybe we should do unto Christians as they do unto us...

As soon as American white men are hung from trees for the color of their skin, kept in concentration camps because of their ancestry and dragged behind pick up trucks because of their sexuality then maybe a guy like Douglas Wilson can cry about the Free Speech Apocalypse.  The White American Man's point of view is entirely over represented in today's entertainment industry and quite frankly,  it's boring. Four stars for this film proving this point.

It specifically focuses on the so called progressive movement and shows us how progressive educators have impacted the US educational system and turned colleges into places where radical ideological indoctrination takes place. Colleges and Universities are not effective with regard to fostering critical thinking skills. The young people in this documentary were unable to think critically about and analyse Doug Wilson's arguments on ethical decision making. They were functioning at a low cognitive level due to the politically biased teaching they had been subjected to. There are no models for intelligent discussion of ideas or concerns. People are being shown only ad hominem (personal) attacks or canned responses to concerns.

Dumbed down liberal progressives are unthinkingly throwing away traditional boundaries and norms like they are garbage. Dissenters are routinely taken to court,boycotted,demonized 're educated',and/or destroyed [as seen in the interview with the owners of a Christian bakers who were fined $150000 for refusing to bake a same sex wedding cake].These extremist leftist conceited zealots think they are doing something new and exciting by rebelliously overthrowing oppression (normality) when in reality they are ignorantly shattering something precious and essential to humanity. The bunch of college students who disrupted Doug Wilson's rationally presented lecture on sexuality God's way vs. the world's way & tolerance God's way vs. the world's way,because they interpreted it as nothing more than despicable hate speech seemed deranged.

And students shouting and name-calling only detract from and harm the points they are trying to make.  I found WIlson's condemnation of the Civil War especially interesting, especially when he compared his stance to being behind a sand dune on Normandy during WWII.  Huh.  This was a wonderful depiction of how nobody is willing to budge their opinions, as both sides are coming from emotional, not intellectual, reasoning.  And that's where I think he went far astray in thinking that slavery could have been abolished by peaceful means.  Yes, other countries did it peacefully, but we're not other countries.  We are America, where we have long declared war on everything.  I wish that we had ever been true to the tenet of separation of church and state, but we have not.  The founding fathers recognized, at least in theory, that religion has always been a huge source of conflict.  In the end, while I strongly disapprove of the students' behavior, Wilson should have been in a church, not at a campus with a diverse population, a large portion of whom he would be insulting with his messages.  Frankly, I'm surprised the University allowed it, given that religion and politics are known powder-keg issues; and educational institutions should maintain neutrality.  As far as the cake couple, yes, self-righteousness will hurt your business.  They took a stance and will have to live with the consequences.  But I wonder if they've ever considered that the heterosexual marriages they provide services for have a very high chance of ending in divorce and an even higher chance of infidelity, which are also anti-Christian actions.  I doubt that the plaintiffs will find much success in court as their ridiculous suit threw in everything but the kitchen sink.  Thankfully, I don't have to provide proof of my heterosexuality or stance on reproductive rights whenever I ask a business to provide goods or services to me.  Wilson comes across as stubbornly ignorant, and the opposition comes across as reactionary drama queens.

7479403,5,B016PIL680,"I was vehemently against the Douglas Wilson whenever he debated Christopher Hitchens, but I was very much with him in this penetrating film.

Of course, Hitch was a big proponent of George Orwell, and I'm guessing he'd also appreciate this film.

The main arguments presented in this film were the grave importance of free speech and culture, and how they're under attack (not in the overt, violent, sense, but in the covert, insidious, sense).

The film shows how, instead of making an argument, you can just call someone a ""bigot."" This, and similar tactics (or just lack of intellectual capacity), are used to silence, or at least discredit anyone with a conflicting viewpoint.

As the film pointed out, George Orwell espoused how language could be weaponized to achieve one's ends. Orwell said, ""Freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear,"" and this documentary points out how we, IN PRESENT DAY AMERICA, we can now be arrested for exactly this, and it is under ""Hate Speech."" This has picked up a lot of steam in Europe and Canada, where a comedian was fined $35,000 for an ""offensive"" joke. If you think it can't happen here in America, (1) it already has, and (2) everyone always thinks sh*t can't happen, until it does. Look around. Use different sources for your news. You'll be shocked (even algorithms for search engines have been influenced with bias).

As far as culture, I use to think ""the culture war"" was just something Bill O'Reilly blew out of proportion for ratings. As I've grown older, I've continually asked, why do even the people that complain about America want to live here? Why is America so much better than anywhere else? I've realized two things: (1) culture matters a hell of a lot, and (2) our culture is the best. If you study Rome, you'll see that civilizations as strong as ours die from the inside (YouTube, ""The Truth About The Fall Of Rome: Modern Parallels"" for a FANTASTIC presentation eerily relevant to modern times).

7479415,5,B016PIL680,"I decided to give this documentary five stars for several reasons. Firstly, Doug Wilson does show that a university setting, where someone who is educated in the tenets and history of his/her faith should be respected with listeners and cordial dialogue, does not always result in the correct atmosphere. Secondly, there appears to be some misconstrued information about Christians and Christianity that is held by some in radically liberal corners of universities. And, thirdly, he was respectful despite what he endured at Indiana University.

Admittedly, however, those were young university students, who can easily be swayed by the excitement and social interests of friends, creating a larger environment of reaction. When I was studying for a BA degree in English Literature I was sometimes swayed by the community spirit at a basketball game or another event. Most notably when the university team went to the playoffs for our small conference and we won, the excitement of the crowd and team and the win nearly overtook me. It was euphoric. And that's great. But, I am not a basketball fan, and I did not have a friend on the team. The only connections I really had was my friends who wanted to go and the community spirit of the stands. Similarly, it is easy to imagine that some of the students at Indiana University were tagging along with friends in an environment of excitement. Supported by one another they did not have fear but excitement and perhaps even collective anger. They even cheered at one another's shouts that interrupted his speech and simultaneously clapped at questions to Doug Wilson.

Doug Wilson should be given credit. He should be given credit not just for his courage but also his respect and professionalism. Having a group of students yell chants in the middle of a speech would be deterring both mentally and emotionally. I am unsure how he kept his composure. But he also gave answers that were well-reasoned and accurate. While he shares different views from my own, he is a Calvinist and I am not, the theological and biblical answers he gave to student questions were primarily traditional Christian answers. It is obvious he is well-educated, but the answers shown were not anything other than traditional Christian ones. I applaud him for being respectful, and in a world where Christians are too often demonized for ""hate-speech"" and worse, he is a prime example of one who was quite respectful under difficult circumstances. Essentially, he disproved their assumption that he is a ""bigot.""",1471737600,29,2537,5.02375296912114

So, lecturing is like debating and as Pope Francis says, he thinks some of us should not have a fundamentalist view of the scriptures which automatically makes me against this New World Order that is coming and The One World Religion.  I keep saying America was not founded correctly.  My people were property so there was hypocrisy in the founding of the United States of America.  The film does not present this view which is very important to see that man created so called Christianity not in line with what Jesus meant.  The film shows the depravity of our country and where do we go from here Martin Luther King Jr wrote a book, Where do we go from here, Chaos or Community.

This documentary was heavily bias towards the right, spoke directly to white, Christian, conservative America, and did quite a bit of cherry picking. There was some value in the film, which is why I gave it three stars. The extreme left is taking things too far with being politically correct and crucifying people for human beings. There has to be a middle ground. Both the extreme left and extreme right are seeking to control people.

While there is most certainly a difference between free speech and hate speech; there has to be room for real discourse and the way the LGBT organization at IU handled the situation was embarrassing and hateful. The exact opposite of the message they claimed to stand on and ""practice"". That is not the way you engage another person whose views are different than yours and certainly not the way you change hearts.

The owner of the bakery isn't as black and white to me. There was a bit of information the film omitted, such as the owners of the bakery publicly shared the address of lesbian couple whose cake they said no to baking, which in turn led them to being harassed. No one won in this situation.

There is one point that Douglas Wilson says one of the stupidest things I have ever heard in my life. He was trying to illustrate that he didn't believe that the lives that were lost during the American Civil War were worth it. He then says the north could have used the money it spent on the war to just buy the black people who were enslaved. Is that even a real thought process? What would happen if the white slave owner refused to sell? The human being should just continue to be a slave? Human beings are not property to be bought or sold, Mr. Wilson.

The film does a good job of showing how so-called progressive policy is merely a nice sounding euphemism for censorship of dissenting voices. Well done.

I have a sincere distaste for labels such as the right and left but sometimes its easier to use such words rather than getting into the details.

The fact that IU is a public university is irrelevant. Wilson spoke, some of the students responded negatively. Like it or not, that IS free speech at work.

What type of a reaction would I get if I gave a speech at Liberty University entitled ""Hey Conservative Christians, Quit Having Public Sex In Mens Rooms!"" and referred to all traditional marriage advocates as a bunch of closet cases, comparing them to people like Larry Craig or Ted Haggard? I seriously doubt I would receive polite applause and invitations to tea afterwards.

Sorry, right-wingers. There is no ""persecution"" being displayed in this movie.

7479467,5,B016PIL680,"This is a topic that needs to be addressed.

One of my favorite lines from Doug in this movie is, ""If you want diversity, than show me how committed you are to it.""

Far too often people only want their speech protected and then proceed to use legislate in an attempt to suppress ideas that they find reprehensible.

Ron Paul said it well, 'We don't have freedom of speech so that we can talk about the weather, we have freedom of speech so that we can talk about controversial things without fear of government oppression.""",1459209600,14,524,4.494736842105263

7479469,5,B016PIL680,This movie shows that tolerance is often a one way street. People who often demand tolerance and free speech do not practice either with those they disagree with. They are unable or unwilling to engage intellectually with ideas they don't understand and want to shout down anyone who holds a different view. It looks and feels pretty closed minded to me.,1447113600,6,354,4.819672131147541
7479470,5,B016PIL680,"So yeah, I pre-ordered the FSA a couple of weeks ago, watched it this past Saturday night, and LOVED IT!  It's more than worth it, a fantastic overview of our current cultural situation in America with a good christian worldview analysis from Doug Wilson and others.
Thanks for making it!  I highly recommend watching it.",1447027200,4,321,4.818181818181818

8737067,5,B016PIL680,"As a documentary,  It's a bit slow and dry,  however the topic is even more relevant today than when it was made.

Unfortunately,  as is obviously the case,  those who need to watch to better their understanding are far too busy allowing the press and the liberal movement to manipulate them into an emotional frenzy to actually take the time to listen and see the actual points being made.

Further in pastor wilson brings together these thoughts nicely with his a analogy:

If we could . . .  would we choose to kill 1 million people to ensure OR eliminate on demand abortions . . . and thereby nullify State's rights . . . such as was done in the precedent of the civil war to overturn slavery.

This is part of what we've sacrificed during to the whims of the people instead of agreeing to the constitutional process already established . . . It IS a two headed snake and can turn back on those who use it to manipulate policy.

Most NEO Liberals don't think deeply enough or listen long enough to understand the points.

USA's bill of rights was set up with Religious liberty front and foremost on their minds . . . There's NO DENYING IT.",1534636800,,1143,4.395238095238096

As a woman/mother in my mid-thirties, w/a degree in philosophy, a personal interest in theology & politics, I was furious, shocked, proud, hopeful, & anxious. Douglas Wilson spoke facts, eloquent, & never backed away! This is a documentary every person under 30 should see! Common sense & a window into our failing, liberal society.
