8601323,1,6303823386,"My cat Gussie is a tv-watcher, especially animal shows. So we figured she'd be a prime candidate for a kitty video. But before laying out any money, we tested what we could find at the library. One title, Cat TV, she loved. She sat and watched, she stood up on her hind legs to see better and swatted at the screen to catch the little birdies, etc.
So we ordered it. But it turned out to be a different video by the same name. This one intersperses its bird-feeder birds and mice, etc., with the sound of cats meowing (not music to her ears) and someone dishing out yummy-looking catfood for a large group of cats to eat. But Gussie didn't get any! She loses interest in this video quickly.
I recommend the other one with the same title, which I have tracked down from Media West Inc. and ordered through their website.
Now she is a happy Gussie!",1010361600,3,846,4.327044025157233
