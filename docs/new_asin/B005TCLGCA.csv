4889452,4,B005TCLGCA,"In a career well riddled with formulaic westerns, Audie Murphy claims two shoot-'em-ups - NO NAME ON THE BULLET and this one, DESTRY - as cut from a different cloth. But while NO NAME ON THE BULLET is a fascinating psychological oater, DESTRY is a 1954 comedy-western that upends the image of the iconic gunfighter who comes to town and cleans it up. DESTRY remakes the memorable 1939 Jimmy Stewart/Marlene Dietrich vehicle DESTRY RIDES AGAIN, which in turn had remade the 1932 Tom Mix version (which in turn was very, very loosely adapted from a Max Brand novel; or not adapted, more like the title was lifted and Brand's plot abandoned). Anyway, at first glance, it may seem like casting against type, shoehorning Audie Murphy in a more lighthearted role. But don't be surprised when he wins you over. His low-keyed acting style is ideally suited for the role of Tom Destry.

In the rough and rowdy frontier town of Restful, sheriffs have a very limited shelf life. With a crooked mayor and a cheating saloon owner running the place, law and order take a back seat. When the latest sheriff interrupts a sneaky land grab deal and meets a suspicious death, the mayor with a straight face assigns ""Rags"" Barnaby, the town drunk, as new sheriff. But the joke is on the knaves. Rags immediately straightens out his act and sends for the son of a legendary lawman to act as his deputy. Awaiting his new deputy's arrival Sheriff Rags Barnaby talks him up big, brags to the rowdies about how this new fella had cleaned up the nasty town of Silver Creek and how this new deputy was raised to be ""the toughest fightin' man who ever wore a star."" Naturally, the first time the town of Restless sets eyes on young Tom Destry, fresh off the stagecoach, dude is holding a parasol and a birdcage. In a character-establishing sequence, Tom Destry strolls to the saloon, at which point we learn that he doesn't believe in packing a pistol and that he prefers milk over the sinful stuff. Noting this soft-spoken milquetoast, the mayor and the saloon owner relax.

Except don't mistake pacifism for a yellow streak. Audie Murphy has got that baby-faced visage and that slight 5'8"" frame, and so it's real easy to dismiss him. As Tom Destry, he is laid back and affable and first impressions suggest that he's bending over backwards to accomodate the town's kingpins, to the extent that one of the bad guys remarks: ""Well, folks, looks like we finally got a deputy that knows what's good for him."" But Destry's got the backbone. Even if you've seen the earlier James Stewart version, it's still thrilling when Destry exhibits his uncanny marksmanship using various guns borrowed from a bunch of disorderly hooligans. Witnessing Destry's accuracy, the mayor and the saloon owner stop relaxing. Especially when it dawns on them that Destry is investigating the former sheriff's murder.

A feisty Mari Blanchard assumes Marlene Dietrich's role of the saloon girl with the gradual heart of gold, and if Blanchard doesn't quite have Dietrich's flair, she's still pretty good. What sinks her some is that director George Marshall - who also directed the 1939 version - opted to lift heavily, at a scene-for-scene clip, from the 1939 film, including huge chunks of Dietrich's scenes. So it feels very much like Blanchard is doing a pale imitation of Dietrich. Blanchard performs three musical numbers (""Empty Arms,"" ""If You Can Can-Can,"" and ""Bang Bang""). One of them, ""Bang Bang,"" suspiciously sounds like Dietrich's ""See What the Boys in the Back Room Will Have.""

DESTRY is not superior to DESTRY RIDES AGAIN, and it's not even close. But that doesn't make DESTRY a bad film. It's worth watching for Audie Murphy's relaxed performance. The story is nicely paced, establishing Destry as the peaceful lawman who'd rather talk things out than resort to violence. But there comes a time when one just has to walk the walk. It's a dramatic payoff when the moment finally arrives for Tom Destry to strap on his gun, and I did get charged up watching him walk purposely towards the big showdown, eager to administer a smackdown for justice (and maybe for just a smidge of righteous vengeance).

Now I don't think DESTRY is available yet on Region 1 DVD. What I've got is this Region 2 French DVD in which the film title is ""LE NETTOYEUR."" The DVD gives you the option to play the movie in its original English track, but there are those French sub-titles that won't go away. And if you're feeling adventurous, you can watch the French-dubbed version (but there are no English sub-titles). There's also a bonus featurette in which Patrick Brion, a French specialist of American cinema, talks about the film. Naturally he speaks in French, and there are no English sub-titles provided. So dude might as well have been talking about Jerry Lewis.",1323561600,14,4813,4.8009650180940895

8486065,5,B005TCLGCA,"RELEASED IN 1954 and directed by George Marshall, Destry is about a tough Western town run by corrupt local mogul Decker (Lyle Bettger) and the Mayor whos in league with him (Edgar Buchanan). They appoint a drunk as the new Sheriff (Thomas Mitchell) because they know hell be easy to control, but the Sheriff hires as his deputy the out-of-town son of an expert lawman for whom he used to work (Audie Murphy). Unfortunately, when Destry (Murphy) comes to town he quickly becomes a laughing stock because he refuses to even carry a gun!

The film is a remake of Marshalls 1939 hit Destry Rides Again, which was a remake of the 1932 movie of the same name, a closer rendition of Max Brands novel. Marshall desired to do the film again because he wanted to do it in color and thought he could improve upon it. While most critics say Destry is inferior I give it the edge because (1.) its in color, (2.) Murphy is stalwart as the humble-yet-confident protagonist, and (3.) Mari Blanchard is hotter than Marlene Dietrich as the saloon entertainer and has the mojo to pull off the challenging role. Blanchards saloon babe of dubious character is counterbalanced by Lori Nelsons character.

Another thing I appreciate about Destry is that it supports the concept of LIMITED pacifism, which is the ideology that one should only resort to violence when theres no other recourse, after more peaceable means have been sought and proven ineffective. This, by the way, is what Christ and the early church subscribed to, as detailed in the New Testament, not the idea of TOTAL pacifism, which is the idiotic mindset that a person should NEVER resort to violence in any form, even when loved ones and innocents are threatened.

The Messiahs teaching on turning the cheek didn't refer to responding to criminal acts and, particularly, not to a law officer responding to potentially violent criminality. Slapping someone on the cheek was considered a personal insult in 1st century Near East and therefore when Jesus instructed people to turn the cheek he was simply illustrating that ignoring an insult a couple of times (you only have two cheeks) is a matter of wisdom & self-control and is a good way to stave off unnecessary strife, which effectively squelches the escalation of violence (not always, but generally speaking). It helps prevent you from being victimized by fools who want to draw you into their darkness and ruin your day (or week or life). This was nothing new at the time because the Old Testament taught the same principle (e.g. Proverbs 19:11).

THE MOVIE RUNS 95 minutes and was shot at Universal Studios, Universal City; Janss Conejo Ranch, Thousand Oaks; and Alabama Hills, Lone Pine, California. WRITERS: Edmund H. North & D.D. Beauchamp from Felix Jacksons story based on Brands book.

8486066,4,B005TCLGCA,"This review is only for the movie, not the DVD.  I love this early-to-mid 50's western.  Audie Murphy is perfect in the role of Destry, the deceptively mild-mannered deputy.  Mari Blanchard, though she can't compare with Marlene Dietrich, is good as the saloon singer but her singing lip-synching is sup-par.  I'm surprised this film has not been released to US DVD or DVD-R.  Please release this SOON.  Highly recommended.",1455494400,2,423,5.057971014492754
