4233040,3,B003Z8ZCD4,"I WANT to buy this but I already have all the DC movies that these shorts are on.
And if Green Arrow will be on Apocalypse, that's just the nail in the coffin.
For other people like me that have the movies, the only reason for buying this is for the Black Adam short...which is essentially paying all this money for a 5 or 6 minute bit.

I do't want to say it's a ripoff, I just hope there's more to the DVD than this.",1284422400,12,418,3.9176470588235293
4233041,4,B003Z8ZCD4,"The Amazon listed run time is 22 minutes, but by zooming in on the image of the back of the DVD it says the run time is 63 minutes.",1284336000,16,131,3.5517241379310347
4233042,3,B003Z8ZCD4,i was about to click buy when i noticed the run time for this short is 22 minutes...... A dollar a minute let's be a little rational. I will wait a few months and see the price drop by half. If this is an error please let me know.,1284336000,4,230,3.7142857142857144
4233043,4,B003Z8ZCD4,"First off, I haven't seen ALL of what's on this collection. I'm mainly writing this to help add tags to it so others can know it's already up on Amazon, because thus far this set is only rumored on IMDB!

I have seen the Showcase cartoons ""The Spectre"" and ""Jonah Hex"". Now, this collection purports 3 cartoons in addition to the main new one (Supes & Cap Marvel team-up? For once they're not fighing each other? Sounds awesome!) which you can read on the cover by zooming in on it, and I believe the third one will be the new Green Arrow short being released on ""Superman/Batman Doomsday"" (aka The Supergil Animated Film with Darksied).

This will be interesting to say the least.

""Jonah Hex"" was a really good cartoon short. ""The Spectre"" I didn't like the animation style, but the mood and feel was really good. Very gory.",1282089600,15,826,4.530201342281879
4233044,1,B003Z8ZCD4,This was deceiving as it was actually a series of short films with obscure characters.  The Shazam! portion was like 15 minutes.,1510617600,,128,4.818181818181818
4233045,1,B003Z8ZCD4,This movie is less than 5 min long... then it plays another cartoon that has nothing to do with Superman/Shazam.,1508371200,,112,4.65
4233046,3,B003Z8ZCD4,It was fun to watch. But Superman vs Shazam was only about 30 minutes. Then there were a bunch of other episodes with other characters. It would have been better if they had mentioned the on the description.,1508025600,,207,4.473684210526316
4233047,5,B003Z8ZCD4,"Excellent all the way.....through and through. Good animation, good voice overs and good writing. It was a thrill to see a novice Captain Marvel duke it out with Black Adam and having to team up with Supes to even out things.....blow by blow against the big bad that is Black Adam. The plus side is having all those expanded Showcase stories from previous DVDs added to this digital release at no extra charge. .Worth the price of admission all the way. Marvel may have the live action stuff locked down, but they can not hold a candle to DC's animation.",1507507200,,554,4.55

4233051,3,B003Z8ZCD4,Actual movie length is approx 20 minutes. Then you get short movies of other DC characters. I feel ripped off.,1504310400,,110,4.55
4233052,5,B003Z8ZCD4,awesome - i heard they might make a movie with the Rock playing Black Atom in a live action movie - not a cartoon.,1503878400,,114,3.7916666666666665
4233053,4,B003Z8ZCD4,DC's animated films are always enjoyable to watch. This Blu Ray covered a few different heroes stories in some short films but was just as good as the feature film length animated movies.,1502150400,,187,4.696969696969697

If you want this for Shazam just watch all the amazon previews for this movie cause that is all there is to the Shazam short.

I haven't watched the other shorts because I don't care for any of the others on this dvd just disappointed me because I was really excited to see a movie but instead got shorts.

4233104,4,B003Z8ZCD4,"At the beginning Black Atom returns to Earth.

Long ago he's been given magnificent powers by a Wizard, and entrusted to protect the World.  Instead he became corrupted by the Power.  He declared himself a God, and expected to be Worshiped.  He'd been mystically sent into deep space, and had to fly back - over a period of 5,000 years.

On arrival he sensed a potential rival.  Billy Batson's heart was stronger than most humans.  The wizard intended to give him Power like Black Atom's, to make him Captain Marvel.  Black Atom's return forced the Wizard to give Billy his powers, even though he was still a child.  By calling the name Shazam, Billy was transformed into a being with strength, speed, and flight ability comparable to Superman's.

Superman vs Black Atom provides great battles.  Superman is vulnerable to Magic, but not helpless against it.  Also Black Atom didn't have Heat Vision or Cold Breath.  Captain Marvel vs Black Atom wasn't as good.  Marvel was just learning his New Powers, and came close to being corrupted by them.

Superman and Captain Marvel vs Black Atom was great.  As a Tag Team effort they easily overpower him.  Also Superman becomes a role model for Captain Marvel.  Superman helps Captain Marvel Master his Powers.",1461456000,,1254,4.834905660377358

4233113,5,B003Z8ZCD4,This is neat collection of DC short stories. Arnold Vossloo does a great job of voicing Black Adam to the point that I think that Black Adam almost steals the show. The Spectre and Jonah Hex shorts were two of my favorites.,1456617600,,223,4.333333333333333
4233114,3,B003Z8ZCD4,"The Superman/Shazam/Black Adam cartoon is only a short. It's well animated but I wish it was a full length cartoon. There's a lot of action, in fact it's all fighting scenes because it's completely lacking any plot or development. I wanted to know more about Black Adam and Shazam but you only learn enough to understand how they can endure a fight with Superman. The other shorts are well done but the same shorts are also on other DC full length cartoon DVDs as bonus features. There are also some episodes from various animated TV series (Batman, Justice League) which are fine. Overall, an okay DVD if you don't pay a lot... not worth the same as a full length cartoon. It feels like a DVD full of bonus features and no main feature!",1456617600,,737,4.507462686567164

4233132,1,B003Z8ZCD4,Disappointing. It is a vignette of four different stories. They are not all about Captain Marvel and Black Adam. While they are interesting they are not what I expected when I rented this video. The Shazam story was far too short. The other stories included a Spectre story which was mediocre. A green arrow story that was not very good. And a Jonah Hex story that was okay if you like cowboy stories,1443139200,,400,4.493150684931507

4233157,5,B003Z8ZCD4,"If you have read any of my previous comic book reviews, you know that I am a Marvel guy and only read or watch DC once in a while, but I saw this in the library and I decided to pick it up and give it a shot.

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

The Superman and Shazam team up was pretty awesome!  I had no idea that Black Adam and Captain Marvel were so powerful that they could hang with Superman for so long.  It was a real pleasure to watch this and see a young boy who held on to his morals and values be given the power to protect the world.  It actually reminded me of Captain America's origin story because it had a lot of similarities and it also had a lot of awesome action scenes!

The story with Green Arrow was suprisingly terrific!  I didn't know that Green Arrow could be such a great fighter!  I always thought he could only use his bow and arrows, I had no idea he could do so well when he went hand to hand!  And the cherry on the top of this story was when Black Canary showed up to finish off Merlin!

Now I have never heard of the Spectre before, but when I watched this part, I instantly wanted to know more about this character!  Seeing him deliver justice and vengeance to these murderers was incredible and I want to see what else he can do!

The final part had Jonah Hex in it.  Now the only stuff I know about this character is what I saw in the live action movie a few years ago, and that was disappointing.  But this story was much more interesting!  It had Jonah hunting down someone to bring them in for the bounty on their head and then he utterly destroys the people who try and play him.  It was terrific!

It is basically on origin story for Capt. Marvel combined with Superman and Capt. Marvel teaming up to fight Black Adam.  So it's mostly a fight and not much else.  That said, the art and animation are very good and the story, such as it is, well done, including a pretty good fight that goes on for quite a while.  Then there is a Spectre feature.  Pretty straightforward and kind of lame storywise, but at least it's the Spectre in his first animated feature.  Then Green Arrow has a short feature.  This one is better and might have the most developed story overall of the three features.  Bye and bye, this is a good collection to your DC Animated features collection.

Thumbs Up!",1392595200,,260,4.4375
4233241,4,B003Z8ZCD4,"This isn't a single movie; it's a fairly short main movie (one hour) with three other short videos added to flesh things out. Let's get those other videos out of the way first.

The Spectre is a moody film noir story of detective Jim Corrigan investigating a murder as his alter-ego, the Spectre, takes vengeance on the perpetrators. It's very well done, both in mood and in story, and it actually works pretty well as a mystery in its own right. This is one that I think could have been fleshed out a bit more and it might even have worked well as a longer movie.

The Green Arrow story has the archer taking on his opposite number, Merlyn, protecting a princess from the assassin. The action is non-stop and the ending a lot of fun. Highly entertaining.

And, finally, Jonah Hex takes on a vicious saloon madam and her cohorts, in a saloon where strangers who come in don't come out again.

The main movie in the collection is a retelling of the origin of Captain Marvel. A destitute orphan, Billy Batson, has nonetheless managed to maintain his heart and his courage. He has a strange encounter with a homeless man, then goes on to breakfast with reporter Clark Kent, who is writing his story for the readers of the Daily Planet. The two are shocked by a thunderclap as Black Adam makes his presence known by blowing out the windows and wall of the diner in which they're eating.

Adam, exiled by the wizard Shazam to the farthest reaches of the galaxy, has made the 5000 year journey back to Earth. He recognizes in Batson the chosen successor and he decides to take him out before the wizard can act. Superman acts to protect Batson but is outmatched by Black Adam. They are evenly matched in strength but Adam's magic, to which Superman is vulnerable, gives him the edge.

While Superman takes on Adam, the wizard finally acts, bringing Batson to the Rock of Eternity and explaining his destiny before sending him back to Earth. There are a few plot twists remaining before all is said and done and I won't reveal the ending except to say that I found it strangely unsatisfying and a bit anticlimactic.

Overall, though, I found the movie entertaining. The battle sequences were good and it was nice to see Superman take on a foe who really could go toe to toe with him and even beat him. I loved the way they drew Black Adam; they really brought out his deadly menace and his persona. The voice acting wasn't bad, although I have to say that, even though I normally love James Garner, he really wasn't a suitable choice for the wizard Shazam.

Aside from the Green Arrow video, all of these are a bit darker in tone than is customary for the WB animation studio. Nonetheless, all of these videos add up to a pretty entertaining collection.

4233253,2,B003Z8ZCD4,"Pretty much all the reviewers here are the standard comic book fanboy or Michael Bay lover. I would agree with the points of animation being impressive, however ... for the most part - apparently, though, character is not imperative with these ""aficionados"", with the facial gestures here being only a par above 70s Filmation cartoons. For those of you who are concerned with their favorite characters over simply the action involved, you may like the Capt Marvel/Superman/Black Atom short - just likely, not love it. However, as others have mentioned here, such an origin tale is quite rushed at 20 minutes. Also, true Capt Marvel followers will likely not be so impressed by the ""modern"" look of the character, considering how C.C. Beck's great characterization is completely lost here, including both the look and humor of the character.

The beauty of Marvel is that he's really just a boy. That opens up some great development, as a boy inside the body of an adult superhero. However, of course, there is really no humor here, as well, just an average kid with gosh oh gee exclamations to boot, narrating his adventures as they occur as if he's a silver age DC hero or something (and yes, that's a knock on the 60s era of National Publications). As a fan of the Big Red Cheese, myself, I would warn here: go for the Justice League Unlimited version, instead. At least it's fun. Nevertheless, I will agree, again, that the animation - and the battle - are pretty good (even if the inclusion of Superman is nonsensical ambivalence-referring to both his placement here as well as his characterization). The other shorts included on this dvd, as others have already mentioned, are on previous sets. I would NOT agree with these reviewers that they are worth the ""price of admission here"", so make your own decision how you view them.

Again, the characters are somewhat wooden and its the action that really drives the stories, alone. The Green Arrow entry (which has been called the best thing on this compilation by a number of reviewers) is a decent piece. At least, the character is pretty true to form (so, to be fair, perhaps there is a speck of development on this dvd). However, like all the pieces, the ""tale"" is simply another action one, although not really a bad one (Malcolm McDowell's part, however, is NOT that imperative, with a pretty thankless role in the piece). The more ""adult"" entries here are of the characters The Spectre and Jonah Hex. The former has been one of my favorite comic characters since I read his original golden age stories in 70s DC ""Super Spectaculars"" and such (my favorite comics as a boy). However, I feel there's really more to the character, again, than this short can offer.

It's really just a dark piece, lacking any of Corrigan's nature. Basically, this could be any Spectre. Either way, this one is REALLY not for kids. I'll be blunt. Only an idiot would show this to their children. Okay, the last piece, a standard western story with Hex, is really my favorite. Where the emotion is still lacking, for the most part, this one is at least a bit edgy, making this piece ESPECIALLY NOT for kids. All in all, I would give this last one three stars, but just barely. Don't buy this set on that last recommendation, though, whatever you do. Check it out on Netflix instead. You've been warned.",1374192000,3,3340,4.715753424657534

4233264,3,B003Z8ZCD4,"I love DC. I buy all of their DVDs and movies. But, you gotta learn that sometimes, you don't need to get things right away. I did the same thing with the Lord of the Rings - I didn't want to pay $60 for the Bluray, so I waited a year and a half, and got it for half the price.

When this came out, I was low on cash, so there was no way I'd pay $20 for 30 minutes of new material. No matter how many old shorts they crammed in there. No matter how much I love Superman or Captain Marvel. So, I waited, and now it's finally cheap enough.

Okay, ""The Return of Black Adam"" is a new interpretation of the Origin of Captain Marvel, cobbled together from various sources, from the Golden Age Origin, Jeff Smith's ""Shazam and the Monster Society of Evil,"" and ""Superman/Shazam: First Thunder."" Billy Batson is a boy, who is granted superpowers by the Wizard - Shazam. His new powers attract Black Adam, the Wizard's first failed champion. Superman joins with Captain Marvel to defeat the new threat. It's one action packed slugfest.

I can't complain about the voice acting, but the one thing that was distracting was the animation. I can't tell who is responsible for this, but they chose to use the same animation style as the Boondocks. So each time I watch it, I expect Billy to start swearing at any moment. That's just me, though, if you haven't watched the Boondocks cartoon it won't be an issue for you.

As for the rest of the content on the Bluray, it does contain the first three animated shorts featuring The Spectre, Jonah Hex, and Green Arrow. Sadly, the Catwoman short was produced AFTER this was released. They're supposed to be ""Extended Versions,"" but it's a matter of seconds added to each short cartoon. I does come with commentary for each feature, including ""The Return of Black Adam.""

One minor plus, they also include four bonus cartoons from other DC cartoon series. ""Initiation"" featuring Green Arrow from Justice League Unlimited. ""Clash"" featuring Captain Marvel from Justice League Unlimited. ""Chill of the Night"" featuring The Spectre from Batman the Brave and the Bold. And ""Showdown"" featuring Jonah Hex from Batman: the Animated Series. This might be the only way to get these episodes on Bluray for a while.

But, ultimately, I was only mildly satisfied with the overall product. Billy and Captain Marvel deserve their own full-length movie, or their own series. This short only made me realize that I want more. Plus, having to wait two years for it to come down in price, I rate this Bluray a 3-out-of-5 Stars. If you're the type of fan that loves to buy everything, it's finally cheap enough to own, but for the average consumer I say you can give it a pass.",1362787200,,2691,4.572614107883817

4233270,4,B003Z8ZCD4,"A dotted white line appears in every frame which sometimes breaks up as well !!! Poor quality copy...........

The second copy I sent back because it had the same problems!

The Videos themselves were wonderful but their quality was marred by the cheap copy I received... probably not from Time Warner but perhaps from a third party.............

However none of the people who wrote any of the other reviews know anything about film editing, animation, coloring etc so they cant be taken seriously.  Each one of these animated shorts is a gem.. They have some of the best sound editing, coloring, art and animation I have ever seen. They are superbly edited by Margaret Hou. The voice acting is perfectly pitched and the sound by the track team is at 100%. The plotting via the editing is intricate ... apparently none of the other reviewers know anything about the history of Green Arrow. This is condensation of all the other Arrows.

I am not fond of the Spectre but the 70s film noir has some great coloring and the characters are superbly played. I have watched Black Adam/Shazzam many times... the shot composition is intricate and beautifully executed all the while balancing acting, sound, plot, editing etc.

The last Feature is Jonah Hex which has wonderful coloring and superb detailing in the animation. The artists are mostly from Korea working with a totally american team and they have really pulled out all the stops. Each of these animated features is supposed to demonstrate the high standards that DC and Warner has brought to their animation art.

See these for yourself. If you know anything about filmmaking and/or animation you will really be pleasantly suprised when you closely analyze these shorts which are a testbed for some of the best art and science in DC/Warner's animated features.",1358294400,,1815,4.911764705882353
4233271,4,B003Z8ZCD4,"Captain Marvel is my absolute, all-time favorite superhero, so I was pretty excited he got an animated adventure at all--even if it is an abbreviated one, and needs Superman in there as co-host.  All in all, they did a pretty decent job. It's a tiny, tiny short--not even 30 minutes, but beggars can't be choosers if you are a fan of the World's Mightiest Mortal.

They did some cool mish-mashing of the Captain Marvel backstory for this release. They had Mr. Tawky Tawny as a servant of the Wizard, straight from Jeff Smith's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shazam-The-Monster-Society-of-Evil/dp/1401209742/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shazam!: The Monster Society of Evil</a>.  They kept the original Black Adam origin from the Golden Age, which made me happy (I have never been a fan of the ""Theo Adam"" version). The origin of Captain Marvel, with Billy Batson riding the subway to the Rock of Eternity, was very well done, and both Billy and Captain Marvel looked great.  Throwing in the Clark Kent / Superman angle was odd, but worked for the story. And they gave Black Adam some new powers, including the ability to shoot the magic lighting.  But those small things are easy to forgive.

The kicker here is that it is just a short. They really should have done a full-length Captain Marvel movie, and brought in the rest of the Marvel Family as well. DC has been adapting famous works to animation recently, and Jeff Smith's ""Monster Society of Evil"" would have been a perfect springboard for an animated Captain Marvel adventure.  Or they could have brought in Captain Nazi and done the Captain Marvel Jr. origin story. Or ... well, there are 70+ years of stories they could have adapted. But they obviously didn't think the Marvel Family had enough pulling power to justify a feature length film of their own.

The rest of the shorts on here are great.  Jonah Hex, Green Arrow, and The Spectre are all somewhat second-stringers just like the Marvel Family, so together they would make this disk a worthy purchase. Except--they are all already available on different DVDs.  If you are a regular buyer of the DCU animated shows, they you probably already own all of these shorts, except for ""The Return of Black Adam."" That was a bit of low-handed dealing by Warner Bros.

I was happy they included the Justice League Unlimited short ""Clash"" as a bonus feature. I love that episode, with its Superman / Captain Marvel battle that shows the differences between the two characters. They may have similar powers, but their outlooks and personalities are completely different.

For all it shortcomings (pun!) this is a DVD I watch over and over, maybe even more than most of the full-length cartoons. I would love to see more animated Marvel Family in the future.",1357171200,,2806,5.010752688172043

4233280,3,B003Z8ZCD4,"This movie was sparking high hopes for me since Superman Doomsday was the best Superman animated film that I have seen. While the animation is good for the Superman/Shazam DVD, I believe that it leaves one disappointed and wanting more.

The biggest disappointment is that while I was expecting a full length animated film, I was left with a 20ish minute episode that could have been used during the old Superman animated series on TV or a ""lost"" episode of the Justice League. The Superman/Shazam short is followed my more short films of The Spectre, Jonah Hex, and Green Arrow. Green Arrow being the best one. All four films total just over an hour.

What does your 20+ minutes get you? Well, the movie opens with Black Adam coming back to Earth and causing chaos. Superman doesn't look so super in this movie. Apparently, Superman can be effected by a wizard's magic because that is how Black Adam gets his powers. Billy Batson is introduced and is immediately sought out by Black Adam because he has been marked by the wizard. During the scuffle with Superman, Billy is transported by magic on a subway train to the wizard. The wizard explains to Billy that Billy is pure of heart and bestows his powers upon Billy. Now, all Billy has to do is say ""Shazam!"" and he is transformed into Captain Marvel. The place where Billy meets the wizard falls apart and the wizard dies. That whole exchange takes place in less than three minutes. Billy is instantly transported back to the middle of the fight between Superman and Black Adam. After one mistake, Billy has his powers figured out. Really? Captain Marvel and Superman beat Black Adam and then the story slowly comes to an end.

The movie could have easily been longer to explain more. The exchange between Billy and the wizard should have been longer. If one is getting super powers to be a new hero to save the world; wouldn't that conversation take a little longer than a few minutes? I am pretty sure that it took Spiderman, Superman, and all of the X-Men a lot longer than a couple of minutes to figure out their powers and for Black Adam to have the same powers as Captain Marvel; he was defeated pretty easily and all in less than 20 minutes. Yep. Stupid. But don't take my word for it. Watch the horror for yourself.",1347840000,,2277,4.575980392156863

4233285,4,B003Z8ZCD4,"SUPERMAN/SHAZAM: THE RETURN OF BLACK ADAM features four DC Showcase shorts, three of which have been previously released. The only new short is the title one ""Superman/Shazam"" that is an origin story of Captain Marvel, the Big Red Cheese who can even make Superman look bad. In this short (about 30 minutes), Black Adam arrives on Earth after traversing the galaxy for the past 5,000 seeking to get his revenge against the wizard Shazam and his anointed warrior. As it turns out, Shazam's chosen warrior is a boy named Billy Batson who idolizes Superman. Billy is lives by himself and has to fight street crime every day just to stay alive. Clark Kent interviews him for a special report he's doing about the city's homeless. Well, in the midst of the interview Black Adam shows up and tries to kill Billy. Billy has no idea why, but a magical journey beneath the ground brings Billy to the wizard Shazam who tells him he is his new chosen warrior and gives him the powers of Shazam.

""The Spectre"" is a short that was originally released with the JUSTICE LEAGUE: CRISIS ON TWO EARTHS DVD. Narrated by Jim Corrigan, this short has a definite 1970s vibe to it, from the aging of the film, to the style of narration, to the costumes and props seen in the short. This short isn't an origins story, but is an introduction to the character of ""The Spectre"". A movie mogul is murdered and Jim Corrigan wants to know why and who is responsible. Meanwhile, the main suspects in the case start dying off one by one in strange and bizarre ways. The Spectre is the pure spirit of vengeance, so though he's often on the side of good, sometimes his interests conflict with those of a more tempered spirit.

""Green Arrow"" was originally released on the SUPERMAN/BATMAN: APOCALYPSE DVD. Like ""The Spectre"", this isn't an origin story either, but does introduce viewers to the character of Green Arrow and what makes him unique from his other hero counterparts. The smugness and cockiness that came with the character in the late 1980s and early 1990s is gone and is replaced with the humility of a man who is all too aware of his limitations of a costumed hero. In this short, Oliver Queen spots the assassin archer Merlyn while on his way to the airport.  As it turns out, Merlyn has been hired to kill a young princess.

""Jonah Hex"" was first released on BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD. Like most of the DC Showcase shorts, this isn't an origin story, just an introduction story. Filmed in the style of a 1970s Western, Jonah Hex is hunting for a bounty. The man is wanted dead or alive. Turns out he showed up in town a few days ago, but was never seen again once he went upstairs with the local madam. Actually, no one who goes upstairs with the madam is ever seen from again. Jonah isn't interested in her wares, but he really is interesting in finding his bounty, so he sets a plan into motion.

Extras on the DVD include four episodes from various DC cartoons selected by DC animation supervisor Bruce Timm. There's an episode from BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES entitled ""Showdown"" that features Jonah Hex in an extended flashback with Batman only appearing at the beginning and end of the episode; an episode of BATMAN: THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD entitled ""The Chill of the Night"" that features The Spectre and The Phantom Stranger; an episode of JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED entitled ""Initiation"" that features the recruiting of Green Arrow for the Justice League; and lastly another episode of JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED entitled ""Clash"" that features the first meeting of Captain Marvel and Superman and a Lex Luthor who seems to have had a transformation of character. There's also a promotion video for BATMAN: THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD DVD sets.

Hard core DC animation fans probably already own the previously released DC Showcase shorts featured on SUPERMAN/SHAZAM. If that's the case, unless you are a completest or a die-hard Captain Marvel fan, you're probably best off renting SUPERMAN/SHAZAM. However, if you don't own JUSTICE LEAGUE: CRISIS ON TWO EARTHS, SUPERMAN/BATMAN: APOCALYPSE, and BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD and are a fan of DC comics, you might want to pick this DVD up. The shorts are excellent pieces of animation.",1328572800,,4213,4.709633649932157

shorts films including The Spectre, Green Arrow and Jonah Hex... and bonus
episodes from assorted series featuring the title characters.

Each feature is notably short but direct and to the point as a one-issue story
in a comic book would be. Entertaining in moderation.",1314230400,,347,4.783333333333333
4233290,2,B003Z8ZCD4,"So, Shazam!'s superpower is being the cheesiest adolescent power fantasy ever, Superman's power is being a heterosexual Shazam! (No jaunty sash?  Why bother?), the Green Arrow's power is having arrows that ignore the laws of physics, Jonah Hex's power is not needing an adequate motivation to drive a plot, and the Spectre's power is being an enormous a-hole.

In all seriousness, these shorts are very well made (often with a profligate waste of voice talent, like having Michelle Trachtenberg speak only two short lines that might as well have been mimed), but they'll really only appeal to diehard fans of DC's non-Batman properties.  I've seen these same characters elsewhere and enjoyed them, but here I was mostly bored despite the production values.  I'd say the Green Arrow's segment is the best, followed by Jonah Hex's, but those are both pretty short.  Overall, these are often too violent for kids, and too cartoony for adult non-diehards like me.  And I say that as someone who has watched and enjoyed pretty much every animated version of Batman and a couple of Superman.

* Minor spoiler *

The Spectre's segment actually made me angry.  He's essentially a ghost jedi who avenges murder victims and who masquerades as a police detective by day.  That's a pretty sweet premise, but after asking exactly two questions of one witness (""Did he have any enemies?  What are their names?""), he then proceeds to murder the suspects.  They all turn out to be guilty, but if the case is that easy to solve, why not just let the police handle it and, you know, let that whole fruity due process thing have a shot?  I understand there are time constraints on the plot, but they really couldn't spend 30 seconds establishing that the justice system had failed by showing someone bribe a jury or something?

***By the way, I know the character's name is Captain Marvel and not Shazam (that's actually the wizard who invites little Billy into a cave and gives him powers), but it's more fun to call him Shazam!",1311465600,,2010,4.805232558139535

meet Black Adam and how tough he is, but thats not all!
EXTRAS:
you get the other showrts you would find in other dvd's included with some DC animated features
in a nut shell...
*Jona Hex - animated short
( Bounty hunting and western fun! )
*The Spectre - animated short
( cold justice, 70's style, right down to the music and the washed look, almost dirty Harry like)
*Green arrow - animated short
( a fast paced rump with the power couple, Green Arrow and Black Canary!)

now more extras! These are episodes relating to the characters hand picked by Bruce Timm.

* Jona Hex - Showdown - from the Batman Animated series on fox , Jonah faces an old enemy of Batman
and his henchmen
* The Spectre - Chill of the night- from Batman the Brave and the Bold, this actually got me hooked with
the campy series, which I despised until I saw how dark the show can get. loved it watch here as
Phantom Stranger and Spectre bet on Batman's soul.
*Green Arrow - Initiation - from JLA unlimited, good fun :D
* Shazam - clash - from JLA unlimited also, NICE!

so you get a few shorts and a few full episodes, widescreen matted format
a run time of 63 minutes, but it's worth it! Many characters in one DVD
in their own little adventures, which were very well animated too, excellent voice acting.

now you know a little more before buying it :D hope yall love DC as much as I do and pick this one up",1310688000,,1469,4.273381294964029
4233293,4,B003Z8ZCD4,"If this DVD contained only the titular piece, I'd give it three stars:  ""The Return of Black Adam"" is a pretty good piece of superhero animation.  It's ridiculously mistitled (being the origin story of Captain Marvel [""Shazam""], with Black Adam as only a plot device) but it's well voiced, well drawn, and--given how inherently ridiculous Captain Marvel's origin is, even by comic book standards--well written.  However, it is only half an hour's worth of entertainment.

The rest of the disc is what makes this package truly a good deal:  three 12-minutes new shorts (featuring The Spectre, Green Arrow, and Jonah Hex) plus, in the ""Special Features"" section, four *full* episodes of other DC superhero series:  one each from ""The Brave and the Bold"" and ""Batman: The Animated Series"" and two from ""Justice League Unlimited.""

The new shorts are all very well done, but parents be warned:  many would see the new Spectre and Jonah Hex features as NOT suited for pre-teens (unless you've already talked with your kids about patricide and the combination of prostitution and murder).

The TV series episodes are all entertaining, for various reasons, and (like the Superman/Captain Marvel piece) appropriate for all ages.  If you appreciate this sort of thing, pay close attention to the voice credits for the ""Batman: TAS"" and, especially, ""The Brave and the Bold"" episodes: the latter is a feast for Batman geeks, while the former has some people one would never--I mean *never*--expect in a superhero cartoon.

All in all, this DVD provides nearly 2 1/2 hours' worth of varied superhero fun, a truly good deal.  Enjoy!",1303948800,,1620,5.048872180451128
4233294,4,B003Z8ZCD4,"Pros: 1. Jonah Hex Story: this story is a tremendous amount of fun. Not especially original -- takes place in some
  gritty Western Saloon slash Burlesque House -- but it is tremendously atmospheric, choc full
  of ""tough guy"" one-liners and reparte. And the animation is superb (as it is in all the stories).
  2. Animation: animation is top notch, in all four stories. Done is pretty much the same, highly detailed style as ""Superman/Batman:
  Apocalpyse"" feature.
  3. Characters: you get to see a lot of legendary DC comic characters who have not previously made it to the big screen: Black Adam (nicely
  brought to life by voice actor Arnold Vosloo), Shazam himself (ie. the wizard), and two of Green Arrow's fiercest
  opponents, Merlyn and Vertigo. None of these characters have appeared in any of the DC animated features to date (including
  all of the Justice League and Justice League Unlimited episodes).

Cons: 1. Weak storylines: The story lines for the Black Adam and Green Arrow features are flimsy at best, designed really to showcase the tremendous
  animation and nicely choreographed action sequences. The other two are not exactly strong but they are fairly interesting, each
  hinging around an intriguing plot twist.
  2. The Spectre Story: most big DC animated feature fans have already seen this short as it is pretty old. If I remember correctly it was included
  with the Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths DVD. Would have been nice if DC had substituted an original story for this one.

Conlclusion: the DVD is not without its flaws, but the Jonah Hex Story is a fun and gripping story, the action in both the Black Adam and Green Arrow stories is tremendous, and the animation in all four stories is top notch. If you're a nut for DC animated features like I am, this baby is a keeper.",1303689600,,1817,4.799352750809062
4233295,5,B003Z8ZCD4,"If you love DC Comics, this DVD may be for you! The shorts in this are done in an Anime style, a lot like Gotham Knights. Ive only see the movies of the ""Big Three"" So all of these shorts were new for me. The Superman/ Shazam short is a lot of fun. Captain Marvel looks great, and the Super smackdown between him/Superman/and Black Adam is AWESOME. A nice clean version of The Captains origin story.

The Spectre short is also a lot of fun. Easily made me re-appreciate a silver age icon. The direction of the short is tight and neatly explains the character. The story about vengeance and justice makes me want to see the Spectre developed a bit more in a longer feature.

One of my personal favorites, Green Arrow, is given a sleek pedal to the metal adventure, where he has to protect a young monarch. Two classic ""Arrow"" villains make an appearance in this one. My favorite DC heroine saves the day and I think its the fist time, I'VE seen Black Canary. WHEN will Arrow get his own live action movie? Could be cool.

Lastly, the Jonah Hex short was more enjoyable than I expected. One of personal favorite actors, Thomas Jane does a great voice portrayal of Hex. This short made me more curious about the live action movie, which as of the viewing of the DVD, I hadnt seen yet.

Nothing but good things to say about this one. Glad I watched it, I would recommend it to slightly older fans, not to young, (parents) take the PG 13 as seriously as you deem appropriate. Kids will dig the Superman/Shazam and Green Arrow shorts most. I enjoyed the Spectre and Jonah Hex best for myself. As I mentioned, the only things I'd want from this movie is deeper exploration of some of these characters on the big screen.

Would not recommend on Blu-Ray (because of the price) and certainly not worth $25.  Pick it up if you haven't seen any of the shorts before and you can get it for less than $15.

I was wrong on all accounts. I am not that big a fan of Superman or Shazam but loved the three shorts and thought expanded editions meant longer versions which would have made this disc worth the purchase price even without the main feature.

4233306,4,B003Z8ZCD4,"The only new work on this disc is the Superman/Shazam short. The other three shorts were previously included in deluxe editions of previous DC Animated films and are now presented in slightly extended versions. All four are very well done with top notch animation work, great efforts from every voice actor and tight, concise plotting.

Superman/Shazam eschews character work for action and succeeds for it. Cars, buildings and even a dam get smashed in a superpowered brawl between our heroes and the villain. The Spectre, my favorite of these short films, replicates the grindhouse style with artificial film grain, 70's beats and voice-over narration, creating a spectacular horror vibe. Green Arrow is action-packed as well, but is the weakest of the shorts, featuring a fairly standard rescue story. And the Jonah Hex short is everything the Brolin movie wasn't - a true western setting, full of atmosphere and immersed in the questionable morals of the period.

Unfortunately, all that greatness only adds up to 62 minutes. And I wonder why the studio saw fit to release this disc when it would mainly appeal to fans that already own the deluxe edition of the previous animated films. Having already bought the movies that included the Jonah Hex and Green Arrow short films, I was reluctant to shell out full price for this disc. Still, the material is great and highly re-watchable. Maybe soon DC will consider giving these lesser known properties the full feature treatment.",1297382400,2,1482,5.069672131147541

4233310,3,B003Z8ZCD4,"I won't enter into the gripe about this being a collection of shorts.  Everyone has already done a decent job at addressing that.  But what I will do is provide my insights into this collection of vignettes from the DC Universe.

SHAZAM - This is the one that brought me to the party.  I was curious to see what they would do with Shazam and the Man of Steel.  Honestly, it was a superpowered street fight.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but this could have been so much more.

THE SPECTRE - I didn't really know anything about the Spectre before seeing this short.  I think it was well done and like the Crime Noir feel to it.  The ending was especially cool.

GREEN ARROW - I am a bit of a fan of The Green Arrow, whether that's the traditional flavor or the 21st Century Smallville incarnation.  This Emerald Archer outing is a fun ride and draws the viewer in to a quick outing that's a bit Robin Hood, and a bit Die Hard.  Nicely done.

JONAH HEX - Again, I've got to plead ignorance when it comes to Jonah Hex.  The story setting was done well enough.  But I just didn't get much of a feel on who our anti-hero was or why he was so interested in his prey.  The interaction was intriguing enough.  Just not sure what it told me about Jonah Hex, or why i should care.

DC and WB certainly didn't cheap out on the voice talent.  There's a great array of talented actos and actresses here, from series regulars to pleasant surprises.  In the end, I'd say this one is worth a rent, or a bargain-bin clearance.  But save your money for one of the full length features.  This peek through the fence only gives a fleeting glimpse of the heroics.",1297209600,,1649,4.268608414239482
4233311,5,B003Z8ZCD4,"For a very short film this was great. The animation was very smooth, and the introduction of Billy as Captain Marvel was very true to the original comic. It was very clear that Superman is not nearly as powerful as the magic based Black Adam and Captain Marvel. The additional shorts included were very well done as well.

4233314,5,B003Z8ZCD4,"The title itself maybe misleading, but this set of four stories has something to offer everyone especially if you are a fan of the DC comics and/or animated series that Warner Bros. has put out over the years.

It starts of with the Superman/Captain Marvel/Black Adam story which is outside of the comics the best origin story of Captain Marvel. You spend about 21 minutes involved in a well-paced action oriented tale that comes down to a decision that only the truly powerful super hero's like Superman and Marvel have to face.

Then it shifts over to the moody and stylized piece about The Spectre. Voiced very well be actor Gary Cole it was good to see the Spectre get a stand alone story. The pacing of some of the scenes may not have come across the way they intended, but I love the attempt they made with this piece.

The Green Arrow gets his own story that's a decent action piece, but probably the weakest of the bunch. Thought still very fun.

Finally it ends with The Jonah Hex story which is my personal favorite. Really good story with the perfect score that matches the setting and tone of the story. With the feel of a classic western, but only running about 11 minutes or so this was the best overall piece in my opinion. With just the right mix of action and pathos it makes you wish the live action movie about Jonah Hex was this good.

I didn't look up the little fact this is just shorts, not a real release. there are 4 shorts which are parts of other releases from the last few years. granted, I had not seen 3 of them and 1 kind of sucked anyway. I will say this, the fight sequence on the green arrow short is very good. very rarely do you see real martial art techniques. and to see them used correctly? they need to use that talent to give us real films and not things just to make money. this is like waiting for a new cd from a group, pay for it and find out is a greatest hits of stuff you already own thinking it's a new release.

Now granted the writers and animators did in fact add all of this information into the movie, but it felt lacking since it was only an 18 minute long scene. I felt cheated since they packed all of that information into a cartoon that could have been done on tv. The entire dvd was a let down since all it truly is is a bunch of 20 minute long cartoons of different characters of the Justice Leauge.

Between the Batman and Superman animated solo series and the Justice League series, they've managed to branch out into features. They've been great thus far (some more than others of course), but one thing that escapes me is why DC didn't see fit to do a full length feature for Shazam. The book ""Monster Society Of Evil"" would have been a great start. I am a huge fan of the ""big red cheese"", and the concept of a child who can become a god with a single word is just fascinating to me. I think it would be interesting to see more of Jerry O'Connell's JLU characterization in a feature length. In the episode ""Clash"", Captain Marvel is an even bigger boy scout than Superman..and is naive and very much a kid in big boy's pants. That child-like naivite and wide eyed optimism is what makes him so endearing. I loved this short and The Spectre short is my fave among the previously released Showcases. I just think DC dropped the ball on this one.

I think they really need to explore the DC Universe in future releases. We don't need every other feature to include Superman or Batman. Captain Marvel, Green Arrow, Aquaman, Flash...they all deserve a bigger solo spotlight.

With that said, I found this collection of shorts to be VERY enjoyable.  Oddly enough I actually found the main short (Superman/Shazam) to be the least entertaining one.  The Green Arrow one was very action packed and fun while the spectre was an amazing 70's throw back short and the Jonah Hex short was as good as they come for animated entertainment.
I would like to point out however that the Spectre and Jonah Hex shorts are NOT for children.  The Spectre is shown punishing the evil in very violent ways while Jonah Hex showcases plenty of guns, booze, and prostitutes.  It's just nice to know for anyone thinking that the rest of the shorts will be as sugary sweet as the main one.  If the price to purchase scares you away then you MUST at least rent this wonderful collection.",1292544000,,1140,4.478260869565218

Pretty much the rest of the DVD is a collection of other shorts or episodes from other shows that have some relation. If I'd have paid 20 bucks for this, I'd have been disappointed.

Check it out from Netflix or Redbox if you have the chance, or wait and see if you can get just the new stuff VOD.",1292544000,,368,4.097222222222222
4233322,2,B003Z8ZCD4,"I think the pre-order price was originally $19.99 for this...wow.  But if the only thing new here is the 20 minute Captain Marvel/Superman short, that's an outright crime against fandom!  I imagine that most folks who support DC direct animated productions already own the previous editions with the other ""shorts"" AND have already bought the entire run of Justice League.

Don't get me wrong, I very much enjoyed seeing Captain Marvel/Billy portrayed as he was in this version, almost a dream come true given his poor and clumsy treatment in other animated versions.  However, WHAT IS THE POINT TO A TWENTY MINUTE SHORT?  The story is pitifully contrived (Clark Kent interviewing some ""random"" homeless kid who lives out in the burbs...sure there aren't any homeless kids in METROPOLIS!!!).  I understand the necessity of such a plot device to get the action started, but puh-lease!

I was drooooling intensely at the idea of ""First Thunder"" being translated into an animated feature.  Heck, the style of animation and designs almost perfectly match that of the source material. BUT,unless you completeley discount the short, it takes a lot of steam out of what could/should have been a phenomenal feature by canibalizing some of the elements that make that story so meaningful.  Clark knows Billy is the Cap, can't put that cat in the bag!  Billy must know Clark is Supes, otherwise it's hard to explain how he didn't splatter against a brick wall and left a crater in the side of the building!  Oh, it's just so frustrating to even think about it (now I'm twitching!).

I would still purchase a feature First Thunder done in this style, and unless your (DC's) marketing geniuseses told you different, I'm sure it would do as well as the other releases!  Why is this sooooo hard?",1292284800,,1781,4.8966666666666665

The Spectre, Deadman, and others also star in this collection. The Spectre's 10 minute show is shockingly spooky. I was not expecting it to be as scary as it was.

Not being a fan of Captain Marvel, wasn't sure I would like this. But it turns out I actually enjoyed his character in this. It was a great short.

I was kinda hesitate to buying this, since I already owned the shorts on the other movies. But I would like to see them continue making these shorts, so I wanted to support it. The lack of special features is a little annoying. It was nice they had commentaries on all the shorts and had episodes of various DC animated shows for characters that had their own shorts. My favorite short is Green Arrow. This actually got me interested in the character and started reading some of his comics, now he's probably my favorite hero there is. Jonah Hex one was epic. It's what the live action film should have been. The music was amazing for it! The Spectre is definitely my least favorite out of them all.

4233329,3,B003Z8ZCD4,"DC Universe decided to go ahead and take their DC Showcase features from three of their prior regular full-length releases into a single movie anthology, along with a brand new longer segment, the headliner of Superman/Shazam: The Return Of Black Adam. It also claims to have all three of the previous shorts now in expanded editions, but that is not the case with this as none of the shorts of The Spectre, Jonah Hex, or Green Arrow were changed in any way from their original release. Why they advertised it like this I have no idea, as Warner Bros. is usually pretty straight forward with their promotions and let you know what you're really getting.

The first feature is of Superman/Shazam that actually acts as an origin story for Captain Marvel, which is pretty cool since there's never really been anything done of him outside the comic books. BTW, I need to point out that this is the DC Comics' Captain Marvel who is really the original one, and not the Marvel Comics character of the same name. There's a long history behind that involving copyrights and whatnot, that I suggest you look up on your own time. Anyway, it opens with an evil superpowered baddy called Black Adam arriving on Earth after hitchhiking it across the galaxy for the last 5,000 years. Adam was given the powers of the Greek Gods by the wizard Shazam long ago, but went rogue, so the wizard sent him far into space. Now that he's returned, Adam seeks out the next one who will inherit the powers of Shazam. It turns out to be a young orphen named Billy Batson who is currently being interviewed by Clark Kent for a news report on the homeless(even though he has an apartment). Adam shows up and flings Kent through a wall, although conveniently Superman shows up(weird!)to give him a run for his money. Billy manages to escape, and is magically sent to the underground lair of the aging Shazam. He gives Billy the ability to turn into an older version of himself with the powers of flight, speed, and superstrength, with the new name of Captain Marvel. He and Superman team up to take down Black Adam, and with the help of Shazam's talking tiger friend, con the villain into reverting back to his old form which ages him five millenia in a single moment. The mini-movie ends with Billy sorta forgetting the whole concept of a ""secret identity"" when confronted by some punks. This was a great little feature which explored some of the old DC Comics Presents territory where Superman would team up with other heroes in Brave And The Bold fashion. It was wonderfully directed by Joaquim Dos Santos who also did great work in Avatar: The Last Airbender, as well as the other DC Showcase shorts .

The first of the three original Showcase stories is The Spectre which is done like a cross between a 70s detective TV show and a grindhouse movie. Jim Corrigan is a police detective who is really the Spirit of Vengenance, and as the Spectre he hunts down the murderers of an ex-girlfriend's rich father. This has some particularly spooky and gripping scenes in it. The Spectre himself is very convincing as voiced by Gary Cole(aka: Harvey Birdman!)

Next is Green Arrow, where the Emerald Archer has to rescue a young princess in an airport from assassins. He gets into a chase with several thugs while being shot at by the evil archer, Merlyn The Magnificent. GA bests Merlyn, but is nearly taken out by his client, Count Vertigo. Luckily, Black Canary shows up to bail Arrow out. Neal McDonough was fine as GA, and Malcom McDowell is charismatic as ever as Merlyn.

The final bit is Jonah Hex which was phenomenally better than that crappy live-action movie. It's a regular tale of the horribly scarred gunslinger with no supernatural plotpoints thrown in for no good reason. Jonah goes hunting for an outlaw with a large bounty on him, and runs a fowl of a crooked but dead sexy bar owner and her goons. This holds up as being a great Old West tale, while still holding onto the great feel of a nostalgic comic story. Thomas Jane is also just as tough as the voice of Hex, and not just doing a Western version of The Punisher.

Aside from how there was nothing new added to the previously released shorts, I'd say this is worth at least renting if you didn't have the Justice League: Crisis On Two Earths, Batman: Under The Red Hood, or Superman/Batman: Apocalypse special edition DVDs or Blu-Rays. I dunno if there are plans to release Superman/Shazam as a bonus on an upcoming feature release, but otherwise unless you're a huge Superman or Capt. Marvel fan you might wanna save your money until this ends up in the used DVD rack.",1290556800,17,4612,4.612667478684531
4233330,4,B003Z8ZCD4,"Bruce Timm and company just keep cranking out the hits. Ever since BTAS, I have just been overwhelmed, by everything that these guys have done. One of things that I love about the DCAU, is that while have been given great stories about Batman and Superman and the other big name DC heroes, they always remember the little guy.

DC Showcase is a collection of short films that revolve around `other' heroes in the DC universe and give us a story about how they do what they do to keep truth and justice. Three of these shorts have already been given to us in the last 3 DCAU DVD releases, but it is still nice to get them in their own package. Of course the main attraction is the title, `Superman/Shazam: The Return of Black Adam' Captain Marvel isn't what one would call a less popular hero, in fact he is extremely popular. Still, the DCAU has not really given him the screen time he deserves. After the JLU episode `Clash' I was so happy to finally see Captain Marvel as part of the DCAU, now he gets his own origin story. The short is about the length of an actual tv episode and it is great to see Superman witness the creation of Captain Marvel. Brining back George Newbern and Jerry O'Connell to voice their respective characters was awesome, because like in `Clash the two actors work off each other so well. Arnold Vosloo brings a great persona to Black Adam and just having Black Adam in general in the short is great as well, because like Captain Marvel he is another character that never really has been given much time in the spotlight.

Along with this new short there are extended versions of the first three shorts. You barley notice the changes, but they do seem longer with a lot less broken dialogue so the flow is much better. `The Spectre', is perhaps my favorite because it uses the old 1970s film scratch effects to make it come off an old cartoon. The casting of Gary Cole to voice The Spectre was pure genius, as he is probably one of the best character actors out there today. It's a great story of revenge and mystery and it works well from beginning to end. `Green Arrow' is the most modern of the shorts. Casting Neil Mcdonugh and Malcom McDowell is a real one two punch. It is a great Green Arrow story of him doing what he does best. It's got great action sequences and witty humor and throwing a little surprise in at the end is just the icing on the cake.  The final short is `Jonah Hex' and its style is a true western. The animation is very brown and earthy like the westerns of old, so the vibe is there. You have a great cast in Thomas Jane, Linda Hamilton and Michelle Tractenberg. It's a very slow story more plot driven than action driven, though the action sequences are great.  It definitely makes up for the bust that the actual film was.

The only negative that I have about the package in general is that there were not enough short films. It would have been great to see at least 6 Showcase shorts because there are so many characters that still have yet to be Showcased. While this installment is a tremendous success I really hope that this is the first of many more installments to come.

4233331,5,B003Z8ZCD4,"This is a really fun collection of the animated shorts that DC has been doing as a bonus for their recent animated movies. It was a fairly audacious project but the results have been just great. While all suggest potential for a longer-form story for these characters each stands up very well on its own. It probably should have been marketed a little more clearly as a collection of shorts, but frankly anyone who'd be upset at getting the shorts already in their collection should be savvy enough to know what they are getting here since they'd already been getting the collector's editions. I can tell you, though, that I don't mind owning these movies again. They are incredibly well crafted and I'm more than happy to support the series in the hopes that DC continues to produce their showcase features.

The title short brings back the voice actors from Justice League Unlimited for a longer piece that tells a Captain Marvel origin story. Its a treat to hear George Newburn performing Clark Kent and Superman again and Jerry O'Connell reprises his fine turn as Captain Marvel. The action is well choreographed and there is no shortage of it even with the whole origin business built in. That said, the bonus shorts are where it really shines. Green Arrow is probably the weakest of the bunch, but still shows what a great character he is a moves at a brisk pace. Jonah Hex and The Spectre are both gorgeously atmospheric and superbly acted. Both have a very well defined sense of place and work as fantastic genre pieces. The film distortion effects on The Spectre are just brilliant and the warm tones of Jonah Hex fit the Western setting perfectly.

These bonus features get bonuses themselves and are a great collection of TV episodes featuring the showcased characters with Batman: TAS, Justice League Unlimited, and Brave and the Bold all represented with must-see episodes. Might be thin to a big DC animated collector, but these are genuinely great episodes well worth watching.

As others mentioned the title is misleading, it is actually 5 15 minute shorts focusing on minor DC characters.
In all cases I thought the stories were good, the animation good, and it was a great value for the money. For those that felt the stories should have ran longer, I believe the writers did a good job of capturing the essence of the story and showcasing the characters in the time aloted (not to say I wouldn't love to see longer features, but I think the stories worked withing their running time, focusing on the action with just enough information for the viewer to fill in the blanks, without wasting a second of screen time).
This also got high marks from me for presting more adult-focused material. Maybe a PG-13 rating would be more appropriate (definatley not R material though). But it was refreshing to see something a bit more dramatic.",1290211200,,920,4.6503067484662575

Especially if the movies they star in suck big time. So instead of getting a fresh MOVIE starring Captain Marvel, we get a 22 minute short featuring Superman. Yes, Superman, because apparently all other DC superheroes, aside from the big two, SUCK. The short plays out more like the pilot episode for a Shazam! animated series. Sadly, we probably won't even get that. Although the short wasn't bad, it wasn't particularly good either and it felt rushed.

Then there's the rehash of already released shorts, which is a good idea if you didn't get the Two-Disc Special Editions of the three craptastic films released this year. (I'm being a bit harsh here, Batman: Under the Red Hood was excellent.) The Green Arrow and Jonah Hex shorts were pretty good, but The Spectre was total crap. It was nice that they TRIED to play it out like a film noir but it failed miserably. I don't know, maybe I'm expecting too much from cartoons.

Still, I would've prefered to see animated movies of those ""superheroes"". But no, let's keep making Batman, Superman and JLA features. Because we haven't seen enough of those already. How cool would a Flash movie be? Aquaman? Heck, even Lobo! These DC animated movies are geared towards an older audience anyway, the fans. So there's no reason why they won't sell.

Everyone of the DC Showcase films are too short to be an adequate ""Day in the life..."" kind of film, and they WAY too much source material to draw from and try to support. I know that DC, WB, and the Bruce Timm team want to make a movie for every great DC character and keep elements of their audience happy, but they're trying to make everyone happy, which isn't possible.

They should really focus doing feature length DVD's of either Team-ups, Batman, Superman, or the Justice League.

This DVD is a primarily as disappointment because the Shazam story is OVER just as it gets interesting.  It's a total of 20 minutes I think, not really worth the $$$$ they're asking here. No real plot development and a FINAL resolution.

This DVD would have been better served as a DVD extra or a featurette on the Cartoon Network.

The creative forces behind this DVD would be better served to do a little research and find out what the Top Ten DC selling Trade Paper Backs are and just go down the list producing each one in turn.

It'd be great to see ""Kingdom Come"" and ""Final Crisis"" get turned into feature length DVD's.

Alas, I'm sure that there is a reason behind why this crap was churned out as a stand alone DVD for an 11 minute fight and 9 minutes of Billy Batson running around.

4233345,4,B003Z8ZCD4,"Joaquim Dos Santos( JLU, G.I. Joe: Resolute, Avatar: LAB ) has been the director/producer on the DC Showcase Shorts which for me has been great as I'm a big fan of his work( he even got me to watch a short on Green Arrow who I HATE ). What's even better when his name is attached to something you're pretty much about to see some high quality animation that not even a lot of prime time cartoons get other then The Boondocks that is still traditional 2D animation.

Shazam/Superman is the origin story of Shazam and Black Adam, now I'm not a Superman fan but I am a fan of when him and Shazam get into their tussles but I am a huge Black Adam fan. Who gets this short rolling as he makes his return to earth after being exiled with two things on his mind, kill the wizard Shazam and his new champion. Which leads us to Billy Bastion who is being interviewed by Clark Kent, some would argue that this sounds wrong but again it's a short film and instead of a long drawn out way to have these two in the same city they just cut to the chase. Joaquim and the writer of this had the perfect idea of what happens when super powered people get near each other in a fight, throw buildings and cars at each other giving us a major fight that hasn't been seen since the JL episode featuring Shazam/Supes( which is a bonus feature on this disc ). The choice of getting Arnold Vosloo( The Mummy ) to voice Black Adam was great as he brings that regal voice to the role, Jerry o' Conell was ok but then he didn't really say much other then grunting.

The Specter was a very great throwback to old school horror thanks to Steve Niles and the added choice of having the old film grain was great. While it doesn't have the hand to hand combat Dos Santos is known for he still had people being attacked by objects and you'd never know that this could have been his first time doing so. The music score was also perfect for this and done by the ""Track Team"" who pretty much handled all the music for these shorts, it would be nice to see what these two could do with a full length feature.

Green Arrow is pretty much my fav short which is shocking as while I'm not a Superman fan I really can't stand Green Arrow( more of a fan of his son Connor ). It could have also been this was written by Greg Weisman who created Gargoyles and was a head writer for Spectacular Spider-Man but it also helped that he basically let Dos Santos turn up his fight meter to 11( even had Ollie pull off a armbar ). Not shabby that Malcom McDowell lends his voice too boot

Jonah Hex is pretty much was better then the live action movie and as a fan of the comic it was nice that the cahracter at least took some steps forwards after that disaster. Thomas Jane once again proves that he's perfect for voicing cowboys( having done so in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gun/dp/B0009Z3HYW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gun</a>&nbsp;) and Linda Hamilton while not saying a whole lot makes sure every time she does it's worth something.

Superman/Shazam: Return of Black Adam - pretty neat origin story for Shazam.  Actually doing an origin story on Black Adam to get the lenght up would make this an outright worthwhile DVD purchase.  Instead I was happy with a rental.

The Spectre - interesting enough just not my cup of tea.

Green Arrow - interesting to see what they can actually do in 10-15 minutes.  Cute ending

Jonah Hex - this one got me more interested in the character in 10-15 minutes than the feature length live action movie.  I'm not sure which one that says more about because I did like the movie okay.  Warning to parents.  This one has the most adult themes & you may want to preview this before deciding if you want to let your kids watch.  It almost seems out of place with the others although the Spectre one probably comes closest so if that one makes you nervous about your kids reaction, this one would probably be worse.",1289779200,,1177,4.368663594470046
4233348,5,B003Z8ZCD4,"First thing:  The Blu-ray is actually a Blu-Ray/DVD combo.  Amazon does not indicate this at all, nor does the case, but the Blu-ray is a two disc set.

Now let's go straight into the controversy surrounding this release:

1. The only brand new film is indeed a short film, the Superman/Shazam film (which is definitely more about Captain Marvel's origin, than a full team-up feature). About 20 minutes long, and is now my favorite of the short films and is WELL worth the price, alone, in my opinion.  The animation is terrific and personally, I don't think Superman has ever looked better in an animated film.  The voice cast is great, including George Newbern, who played Superman in the Justice League Unlimited series.

2. The other 3 shorts were all released on the previous special editions of the recent DCU features, but these are slightly extended and the blu-ray has a commentary on each.

3. Another VERY cool special feature are the four animated episodes, each featuring a character from the shorts: Jonah Hex (in Batman Adventures), Captain Marvel (Justice League Unlimited; the one in which he and Superman have a huge brawl!), Green Arrow, and The Spectre (Batman: The Brave and the Bold, ""In the Chill of the Night"" - probably one of the best episodes of that series, featuring Mark Hamill as The Spectre, Kevin Conroy as the Phantom Stranger, and Adam West as Thomas Wayne!).

As far as I'm concerned, this collection is well worth the price.",1289692800,,1461,4.812
4233349,4,B003Z8ZCD4,"SUPERMAN/SHAZAM! - THE RETURN OF BLACK ADAM is the featured short in this DVD offering, and the spotlight is well warranted. This is a terrific action-packed adventure which reintroduces (and modernizes) the origin of the World's Mightiest Mortal and has him teaming up with the Man of Steel, to boot. Since this featured short runs at only around 24 minutes long, it's damn decent of DC and Warner Brothers to also pack this DVD with three previously released shorts in the DC Showcase animated collection (featuring the Specter short from JUSTICE LEAGUE: CRISIS ON TWO EARTHS, the Jonah Hex short from BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD, and the Green Arrow short - in his Mike Grell hooded costume - from SUPERMAN/BATMAN: APOCALYPSE). So, yes, know what you're going into. The Superman/Shazam! story is the only thing spanking new in this DVD.

Superman has three vulnerabilities: kryptonite, magic, and girls with two 'L's in their names. Black Adam has magic oozing out his ears, which presents a definite challenge for the Man of Steel. Black Adam has returned to Earth after five thousand years of an exile imposed on him by the wizard Shazam. Crashing into Fawcett City, Black Adam's mission is to seek out Shazam's chosen new champion and kill him. Except that young Billy Batson hasn't yet met the immortal wizard. Billy inhabits a cramped apartment in a slum neighborhood, but he hasn't allowed the awful urban condition to infect him. Billy has his head on straight, strives to do the right thing (little dude even feeds the rats in his apartment). It helps that he's got Clark Kent for a mentor.

It's ironic that Black Adam's first attempt on his life proves to be the catalyst which introduces Billy to the wizard haunting the subway station. And so, with one magic word, the lightning flashes and the kid transforms into the imposing Captain Marvel. It's an exhilarating thing to see. It's nice, too, that at this stage Superman doesn't just get shoved to the sidelines. He and the rookie play equal roles in taking on and besting Black Adam.

The animation is superb. Whoever came up with the blistering action sequences was dreaming big. I love that the scope of the battle reflects the inhuman power of our characters. Automobiles and colossal obelisks hurtle thru the air. Heroes and villain collide with concussive force. Black Adam holding up that fire engine truck is an awesome, awesome sight. The animation sells all this marvelously. This being a short, there isn't much time for heavy plot development, but the story moves at a crackling pace while doing a solid job of conveying the core personality traits of the three main characters. I love that the writers managed to capture Billy Batson's exuberance and innocence, especially in his guise as the Big Red Cheese. And the Mister Tawky Tawny sighting is much appreciated. I think C.C. Beck would've been proud of this one. Not even the fat kid from STAND BY ME doing the voice of Captain Marvel could ruin this one. James Garner as the wizard Shazam is nothing but awesome.

Besides the three other animated shorts - which are all fantastic (with the Green Arrow short being my favorite of the three) - the DVD also has the trailer to BATMAN: THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD and four episodes from past DC cartoon shows as selected by Bruce Timm: ""Showdown"" from BATMAN: T.A.S. (featuring Jonah Hex and Ra's al Ghul), ""The Chill of the Night"" from BATMAN: THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD (featuring the Specter, Phantom Stranger, and Zatanna), ""Initiation"" (featuring Green Arrow, Captain Atom, Supergirl, and Green Lantern) and ""Clash"" (pitting Captain Marvel and an enraged Superman in an absolutely epic brawl), both episodes from JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED.",1289692800,6,3714,4.890476190476191
4233350,5,B003Z8ZCD4,"When Can you get four for price of one?

This collection of DC Comic animated shorts are mostly been found on other DC animated films. The new short Superman/Shazam is new. However if you have not seen the shorts of The  Spectre.  Jonah Hex and Green Arrow, then they are all new.

The Highlight is the extra adventures from other DC comic animated collections.
*Jonah Hex in the episode Showdown (from Batman the Animated Series)
* The Spectre (with other guest hero The Phantom Stranger) in the episode The Chill of the Night (From Batman:The Brave and the Bold)
* Green Arrow (with Captain Atom, Green Lantern and Supergirl) in the episode Initiation (From Justice League Unlimited)
*Shazam in the Episode Clash (From Justice League Unlimated)

It is a well done collection for those short showcase films, if you have not bought other DC comic collections. It is a great starter kit for parents to spring board their children to read graphic novels.

The animation is well done. Great for the holiday stocking this holiday season

Noticed several macroblocking and colorbanding so I was a little disappointed considering this is supposed to be blu ray and not DVD. I did like the short for the Spectre which I didn't have.

I don't know why this story couldn't have been told like this, Black Adam arrives to earth looking to kick-ass and Shazam stands up to him but wait they are equal. Superman arrives and tips the balance of power to Shazam side, and makes a mention about the justice league.

  The Original Shazam/Superman is 22 minutes long With the the extra shorts the Green Arrow, Jonah Hex,And Spectre making up the other 39 minutes. The unfortunate part for those who have purchased past animations from Dcu is your basically paying 19.99 for shorts you already own. I hope this won't be a practice we will continue to see from Joaquim Dos Santos and his crew of anime creators.

 The Movie itself is a basic knockdown drag out between Some of the Dcu mightiest heros. But everything seemed to be to linear. everything happened just as expected without any real surprises. Situation just happened to unfold just like it was a setup. From the lunch meeting between Clark Kent and Billy to the first introduction of Black Adam. By not having that extra time to create a full storyline we were left with the quick rush rush of events mentality.

 If you don't own the others story's this can have some retribution on you you will see some great short story's but to those who have purchased the others your outta luck. Surprised?",1289520000,29,1083,4.698412698412699

Likewise the Green Arrow episode is described by one reviewer as ""Initiation,"" but that was the first episode of Justice League Unlimited. So does this disc have the JLU episode, or something new?
Another review said the Spectre tale has him with Batman and the Phantom Stranger - so is this a new piece, or the ""Batman - The Brave and the Bold"" episode which aired not long ago.
In any event, I have no idea what's on this disc beyond the names of the featured characters - and, like most of the recent DC DVDs, I'm losing interest fast.

4233357,2,B003Z8ZCD4,"First off I felt duped... I had seen the trailer but somehow missed the fact that Superman / Capt. Marvel was only one of four in this movie.  So really there are four completely separate series here that I would like to rate separately;

Superman/Shazam: Was a lot of fun and extremely well done.  I rate this 4 out of 5 stars.  Even here I seriously question the solid PG rating expecting violence more towards the Animated Superman series.  It was much more physically violent.

Specter:  2 our of 5 Stars... it was way too dark and extremely violent and had my 7 and 11 year old disturbed.  PG rating my butt!  Had I an idea that it would be that dark and violent I never would have put it on for them.  As is my 11 year old was ""weirded out"" while my 7 year old hid under the table until was done.

--- After this I stopped the movie and watched the rest myself and was glad I did so.

Green Arrow: I give 3 out of 5 stars for being fun and violent as a simple action movie.  But really you could have substituted any skills /street level character and written this plot around them.  Fun...but nothing to write home about. (Again not for kids!)

Jonah Hex: I give 2 our of 5 stars...not a bad western but really again could've been any western tough guy character.  Nice western tid bit but really in the end nothing too original or exciting.  Again NOT for kids.

So in all first one was really good the rest wasn't nearly as successful because they failed to have plots that really grabbed you and felt original and developed those characters.",1289433600,,1551,4.307958477508651
4233358,3,B003Z8ZCD4,"The title of this particular animated feature is kind of misleading. My initial expectations were that of a movie in which Superman and Shazam teamed up to take on Black Adam. While that does happen it often feels a bit forced, and the pacing feels very condensed. Which makes sense, considering it's only about 18 minutes of the footage. The rest of the 1hour 2 minutes is dedicated to Specter, Green Arrow and Jonah Hex. I'd give this short 3 out of 5 because of some awesome action sequences.

  The Specter feature is a pseudo 1970s horror-flick and is animated as if it were a live action film from the era. There are some twists and turns in the story, but the overall arch is a bit cheesy for me. I enjoyed the retro feel, some of the specter being the specter and thats about it. The length of this short really hampers it and puts any possibility of strong story development or character attachment in the very difficult to pull off category. Overall I'd give this short a 2 out of 5.

  The Green Arrow minor feature is my favorite of the bunch, it relies, abit, on your prior knowledge of the DC U. Particularly, when it comes to knowing who Dinah is. I like the overall pacing and the the finale of the piece, but still it suffers from ""Just getting started"" syndrome. It feels like the piece should go one for another 45 minutes building on the story. 3.5 out of 5.

  Finally, we have Jonah Hex (Tom Jane). It has a great western feel(as it should with Mr. Hex) to it, but it just doesn't have enough gusto for my liking. 3 out of 5 has a decent fight scene and that is about it. Still wayyyy better than the horrible Jonah Hex movie.",1289433600,13,1648,4.324675324675325

Superman, jealous of new JLA member Captain Marvel, with Lex Luthor playing it up?...EXCELLENT!...Batman as the object of a wager between the Spectre and the Phantom Stranger, with 'guest' appearances by Zatanna and MANY of Batman's 'Rogues Gallery' (AND Adam West and Julie Newmar as Bruce's parents!)...WOW!...Ra's Al Ghul on a mission, with a century-old tale of Jonah Hex...pretty cool, even if I don't care for Hex!...Green Arrow's 'Initiation' into the JLA, with cameos by most of the expanded League, a great initial 'mission' and Arrow's first, brief glimpse of Black Canary at the end (and boy, were the sparks flying from the Emerald Archer!)...FABULOUS!

In Superman/Shazam, the evil and ultra-powerful Black Adam (voiced by The Mummy himself Arnold Vosloo) seeks to take out the new inheritor of the Power of Shazam, which happens to be young Billy Batson (voiced by Zach Callison).  Superman (voiced by Justice League Unlimited Supes George Newbern) shows up to lend a hand as Billy gets a crash course in being Captain Marvel (voiced by Jerry O'Connell), and there's some great action and animation throughout.  As said before, Superman/Shazam is the only new short to be found here, but that's not saying that what's also included is bad either.  The short featuring The Spectre is worth the price of admission in itself, as DC's resident spirit of vengeance (voiced by Gary Cole) exacts brutal retribution upon the guilty in a noir-ish type style, while a short starring Green Arrow (voiced by Neal McDonough) finds the Emerald Archer defending a princess from his arch-nemesis Merlyn (voiced by Malcolm McDowell), and finally a short starring Jonah Hex (voiced by Thomas Jane) finds the scarred bounty hunter taking on a murderous madam (voiced by Linda Hamilton).

At least I knew of this release early enough that I could save money by buying just the single disc edition of Superman/Batman:Apocalypse. It's too bad I caved and got the double. The bright side is that we get extended(?) versions of the previous shorts. And don't forget those ever-present two/four bonus episodes presented by Bruce Timm. I really enjoyed the first three shorts. The Spectre is my favorite because of its realistic animation style. The others are cool too, just more like the JLU show which I suspect the Supe/Shazam short will be too, based on the back cover. But I'm still not letting you off the hook Warner/DC!!! You want your dvds to sell, then stop short changing us fans.

NEW 2011 REVIEW: I finally rewatched the older shorts and while they're still great, they do NOT seem extended like the packaging claims. They are practically the same length as they were on previous DC releases. And Captain Marvel is such a great character that he deserved a full length origin movie WITHOUT any other heroes stealing screen time. The four choice selected bonus cartoons pad out this  short release and as they should. But this whole tired formula wears thin. The 60-75 min. feature, one maybe two documentaries which are not always thorough (the best ones only on the blu-ray), and the recycling old episodes we already have, split on two discs for profit, when it all really fits on one disc. Listen Up DC/Warner, this is the reason fans rent instead of buying. Be the exception and put out complete and thorough products that your loyal customers deserve. See the first Spider-man movie for what a REAL 2-Disc Edition looks like. How many and what features are on each disc? Then look at yours.",1286668800,8,1917,4.719402985074627

Your welcome people hate to read and jump to the conclusion without getting their facts straight.",1285027200,9,354,4.546875
4233380,2,B003Z8ZCD4,"I'm all about supporting DC animated films. But yeahhhhhhhhhh. This is a rip off. I'll definitely be watching this a different way.
I own all the shorts, so theres no point for me to buy another Blu Ray with them in it,just have a 22 min movie.
I must say, this is a stupid move on DC's part. They are spending money on manufacturing the Blu Ray/ DVD's for this, but I highly doubt they'll be selling much, especially with the face that its so easily downloadable nowadays.
Sorry DC, but I won't be buying this one. I'll definitely will be buying Superman/Batman: Apocalypse though!",1285027200,15,582,4.552380952380952
4233381,4,B003Z8ZCD4,"It seems that DC comics is using batman and superman to try and promote other dc comics charactors they do this with batman brave and the bold and with smallville. This dvd could be really good and i'am looking forward to seeing superman and shazam take on black adam. This seems to have an anime style to it as wel. I have not seen this and i plan on seeing when it comes out.
one thing that i hope for is that the new superman batman animated movie that has supergirl in it finds a lot of sucess so that they will make a third batman superman team up movie because in the dc universe superman and batman is all that i pay any attention too.",1284595200,2,642,4.103174603174603
4233382,1,B003Z8ZCD4,"OK, the DC animated flicks have been overall decent, but this is ridiculous. Nobody should be willing to pay full feature price for a short that's no longer than a single episode of JLU. The other shorts have already been released on other disks so that doesn't count for much.

Greed dominates over artistic integrity once again.",1284508800,28,330,4.7894736842105265
4233383,4,B003Z8ZCD4,The naysayers need to relax. This is another excellent short in the DC animated line. The superman short runs 22 min. With all the previously released shorts it brings running time to a total of 63 minutes. So your paying 13 dollars on ammazon for anew movie and all the other shorts well worth the money. This isn't like the scam thats been running with Brave and the bold relleasing season one on four seperate dvds and now instead of a full season release they are releasing only 13 episodesin one set.,1284508800,14,505,4.5

8410027,2,B003Z8ZCD4,"I feel bad for giving it a bad review because the 20-minute episode that I wanted to watch was entertaining, but, like everyone else, I was tricked because I didn't know that the other 40 minutes was a bunch of people I don't know or care about.  They weren't in the title, the box art, nor the description.  This is borderline false advertising.",1523923200,,346,4.476190476190476
8410028,5,B003Z8ZCD4,"This is a collection of vids with solid voice acting, good art, good animation. The cover art is indeed not clear that the Shazam story is only 25 minutes long, but it's a good 25 minutes. It's at least as good as any Justice League Unlimited episode, imho. The stories, in order:

Superman/Shazam
The Spectre
Green Arrow
Jonah Hex

I'm not at all disappointed I added this to my library of DC Animated shows.",1523836800,,409,4.513513513513513

8410032,2,B003Z8ZCD4,"The name of this film and the description leads you to think it would be a full length feature featuring Black Adam, Captain Marvel and Superman.
 Instead you get this short clip and then a bunch of other clips on different DC characters that had nothing to do with the name of the ""movie"".

  I don't mind watching short video clips that features all DC characters out there, but it would had been nice to know up front about it. I was promised something else entirely, and instead I paid for this??",1518307200,3,500,4.4021739130434785
8410033,1,B003Z8ZCD4,"The reason this got 1 star is it showes it is 1 hour and 22 minutes long. But only 24 minutes is the Superman Shazam part. The rest was terrible, my grand daughter was very disaponited",1517184000,,184,4.138888888888889
