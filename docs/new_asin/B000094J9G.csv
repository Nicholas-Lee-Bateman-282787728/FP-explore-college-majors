7989312,5,B000094J9G,"This review refers to the Columbia Tri Star DVDs ""Jack-3Pack""
Such A Deal!....Jack fans, RUN, don't walk to add this fabulous selection of Nicholson films to your shopping cart! ""Easy Rider"", ""A Few Good Men"", and ""As Good As It Gets"" are all outstanding films, that all include other mega stars as well, and three that span Jack's career from 1969 through 1997. The editorial reviews here will give you an excellent description of the films themselves(if by some remote chance you have not already seen any of these), so this review will concentrate on this package deal and the DVDs.

Coulmbia has put together a very nice deal. All three look and sound great. All may be viewed in widescreen(""As Good As...also gives you the choice of a full screen version),and have bright, clear pictures with outstanding color. I was especially impressed by ""Easy Rider"", which was made in 1969.
Each DVD also gives you the choice of surround sound in 5.1 or 2.0(go to audio set-up, as they all automatically default to 2.0), and surrounds beautifully. Wait till you hear that classic soundtrack from ""Easy Rider""! Each DVD in their own keep case, has some special features, including commentary, interviews(""Easy Rider""&""A Few Good Men""), and a ""Making Of"" featurette(""Easy Rider"").They each also include inserts, that have various info related to each film. ER may only be viewed in English, but AFGM and AGAIG, have other languages selections including Spanish and French. There are many choices on the subtitles...they are a little tricky to get to though. Other than English! , I had to go through the sub-title button on my remote, I could not get them to come up just by going through the DVD menu(I never had to do this on other DVDs). And on ER..the first scene, of the drug deal, most of the dialouge is in Spanish, but there are no subtitles in this scene at all. After that, even all the great music has subtitles!

For yourself, or a gift, for any fan of Jack Nicholson...the films, the quality and Jack!....It's ""As Good As It Gets""...
