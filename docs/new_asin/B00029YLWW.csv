8024968,4,B00029YLWW,"If you're an experienced rifle shooter, you won't get AS MUCH out of this as a beginner would.
What I liked about this is he goes into the step by step of getting in and out of positions while maintaining body consistency. This video has tons of little tid bits of info that's going to make life a lot easier for you and probably answer some questions you may have.

He goes into his rifle (M14) and talks about some of the authorized rifles and modifications, then into shooting positions and gear, then his insight which any shooter will tell you is worth its weight in gold to hear someone like this man give his insight.

He does talk a little about how the basics are applied such as his use of a 6 o'clock hold instead of a center mass because of consistency and things like that but it's not a discussion of basic fundamentals like you'd see in an NRA basic shooting DVD.

Look geek, if you want to get that EIC badge you're already spending crud loads of money on everything involved and now you want to questions spending less then $40 on a DVD with one of the best shooters in the game and how he's been able to succeed? Let me know when you want to see that fancy shooting iron. #doyoueventakethisseriously?",1426982400,,1218,4.356828193832599
8024969,5,B00029YLWW,I love old VHS tapes like this because they seem so homemade and folksy. This had many good pointers and great visual demonstrations.,1390608000,,133,4.826086956521739
8024970,4,B00029YLWW,"This is a good video about service rifle competition shooting.  It doesn't go into great detail about positions, however, the material covered is thorough but you must pay attention as Mr Hill doesn't repeat himself much.  It's definitely worth the purchase price.  Mr. Hill is a triple distinguished shooter which is quite an exceptional achievement.  Watching him shoot from the various positions is very instructive and he shows how to achieve those positions very well, but, again, doesn't repeat himself.  I was tempted to give it 3 stars, but the material covered, and how it's covered really do warrant 4 stars even though it's not the best instruction format.

For some basics on positions, I like the series of YouTube videos by retired USMC Master Sergeant Ken Roxburgh, a rifle and former sniper instructor.  He covers prone, sitting, standing (offhand), front sight width, and how to properly install a standard leather sling (not a simple task!).

After watching MSgt. Roxburgh's videos, the material in this DVD will make much more sense to a beginner.  Experienced shooters can learn much from both the YouTube videos and from this DVD, but I'll say it again, you must pay attention.  I had to rewind in a couple of instances because I realized I had just missed something important.  The best instructors repeat themselves for this reason.  The best doers aren't necessarily the best teachers, but that doesn't mean we can't learn from them.",1373673600,,1457,5.025
