7832953,5,6302983592,"The video presents interviews with 7 children living in the Soviet Union.  Included are: a boy in a Siberian children's home, two girls hoping to enter the national ballet program, a girl who cannot go to school because  she is needed to care for her younger siblings, a wealthy Georgian boy, and  others.  I was impressed by the children's eloquence and the interviewers'  sensitivity.  Politics, religion, ethnicity, and life are dicussed.  The  producers hoped to follow the children every seven years, but I don't think  that was accomplished with later documentaries.",964396800,7,572,5.197802197802198
