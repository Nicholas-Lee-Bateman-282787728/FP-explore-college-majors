8391936,5,B003951K9S,"~ The 53 minute DVD currently under review originates from to TV shows in which Anita fronts a piano-bass-trio and performs in front a small intimate audience. During the mid-1960's through the mid-1970's, when American audiences and concert promoters shunned jazz, especially jazz singers, many jazz artists made their living in Japan and Europe where audiences appreciated the art form known as jazz. For the two shows recorded for this DVD, Anita used pick-up bands, as she did on most gigs during this period. The only familiar face in the band was on the 1963 show: her long-time drummer, road manager, and drug procurer John Poole. Poole is a master of the brushes and a master of anticipating and reading Anita's rapid shifts in tempo and rhythm.
~ The band for the 1 November 1963 show in Sweden is Goran Engdahl (p), Roman Dylag (b), and John Poole (d). They perform Sweet Georgia Brown, Let's Fall In Love, A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square, Fly Me to the Moon, Honeysuckle Rose, On Green Dolphin Street, and Tea for Two.
~ The band for the 21 October 1970 show in Norway is a French group consisting of George Arvanitas (p), Jacky Samson (b), and Charles Saudrais (d). They perform Let's Fall in Love, Yesterday/Yesterdays, Four Brothers, I Can't Get Started, Sweet Georgia Brown, and Tea For Two.
~ Do not be put off by the fact that two tunes appear in both concerts. Indeed, comparison of the performances from one concert to the other clearly show what a great improvisor and bandleader Anita O'Day was. In fact, one of the must stunning thing about this entire DVD is watching Anita O'Day the bandleader directing the trio - indicating who will solo when and for how long. The other stunning thing about the DVD is watching how Anita the musician improvises and interacts with her fellow musicians - who obviously hold Anita in the highest regard. Watch Anita exchanges fours with her pianist or bass player or drummer. You just do not get this dynamic exchange out of studio recordings.
~ The 1963 concert is perhaps a little more loose and joyous, and Anita is a little more adventurous in her improvisations. Not sure if this is due to the presence of John Poole on drums or the quality of the other two musicians or the fact that in 1963 Anita was in the depths (or is it the height) of her heroin addiction (which was not the case in 1970).
~ When I listen to Anita O'Day I try to ignore the words and listen to her voice as a tenor sax or trumpet. By doing so it helps remind me that she was much more than a singer - she was a musician - she was a fantastic improvising musician with excellent tone control.
~ Highly recommended DVD.",1333238400,2,2660,4.566945606694561
