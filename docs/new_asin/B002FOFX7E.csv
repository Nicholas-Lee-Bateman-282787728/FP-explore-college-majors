3923018,4,B002FOFX7E,If your a sci fi nerd ( like me a doctor who lover) you'll like this movie because if gives you a scare knowing afterwords you can go to bed at night. Dont watch if your under 10.  And remember this is a b movie so the effects are not going to be amazing but still pretty good. Watch if you like suspense horror and somewhat gore.,1262044800,10,330,3.925373134328358
3923019,5,B002FOFX7E,"This is a really good creature movie.  Contrary to what you might read from other people, the acting isn't bad at all.  The special effects by far exceeded my expectations and were very impressive.  The worms in the movie are very large too.  The characters are actually very likeable as well. Overall I really enjoyed this movie, and I think if you don't expect some huge epic blockbuster or something, you will too.",1262044800,19,417,4.671232876712328
3923020,4,B002FOFX7E,"I'm only giving this movie 4 stars because of the hot blonde actress
""Captain Henle""! ;-)
Her caring nature in the movie seals 4 stars in this review.
OK, I like blondes~ ;-P
I'll cut that sexy ""Captain"" some slack.

Lieutenant Stanley's heroic self-sacrifice in the end
deserves a star or a Medal of Honor.

Is this a sci-fi movie or a comedy?
I sure was laughing from the very start!

The movie starts with a rag-tag platoon of US soldiers
in Afghanistan about to complete their last tour of duty.
They spot what looks like abandoned facility in that
God-forsaken land and was commanded to check it out.
This is when the fun begins!

The script-writers ought to have done further research
on how the US Army moves in to clear a hostile area,
because however that platoon moved out to check out
the abandoned facility is completely hilarious, and
dangerous to themselves in a real-life scenario.

No high-alert battle formation, talking and chatting
away while moving close to an enemy position?!
What did they teach you during Basic Military Training?
One single burst from a Taliban machine gun unit and
that bunch of US ""soliders"" could have been wiped out!

The facility the soldiers checked out wasn't abandoned
after all! Invisible Taliban fighters came out of nowhere,
engaged the US soldiers in gunfire. Second segment of
the comedy begins. The brave US soliders were stepping
into one another's line of fire while engaging the enemy
and during their retreat, which didn't succeed. Before being
stunned into capture, the Taliban shot a rocket or released
some bomb that unknowingly awakened some sleeping
undergound giant earthworms.
The US soliders got captured, bound and taken to a room in
the facility while the Taliban enemy soliders debate on what
to do with them.
The giant earthworms saved the American lives by eating the
Taliban boys away before disappearing into the day.
The American soldiers freed themselves and wondered why
everything went silent so suddenly.
As if lulled into a false sense of security, they exited
their hostage room like they were never held hostage to
begin with. I found that funny.

(I wonder if any of you has seen Discovery Channel's
""Lost Tapes"" which featured a real-life incident that
actually happened in Afghanistan where 3 soliders
were attacked by female ""Cave Demons""?)

I'll fast-forward.

The rest of the movie is hilarious at best.

The US soliders get stalked by giant earthworms
and get eaten one by one.

The US soliders quickly learn that the creatures can only
detect human presences by the sounds the latter make,
and not by sight. Quick thinking, Lieutenant Stanley!

The US soliders try to escape the initial contact area
by hotwiring a truck and sacrificing at least 2 of their
own in the process.

As they were escaping on the road, a little Afghan girl
pops out of nowhere in front of the vehicle, causing it
to overturn and pinning the female driver down onto the ground.

An Afghan man pops out with the little girl and tells the soliders
that the road is mined and that the girl somehow tried to
save them and prevent them from continuing on down that path.

Earthworm continues its chase from afar, comes to the accident
location, eats the injured driver, scatters the soldiers and
their 2 newfound local friends who now takes them to a nearby
""refugee camp"". Hold your laughter here!
Despite its derelict surroundings, the women in this ""camp""
sure looked like they had good dental care and must have had a
hidden beautician - look at their well-kept hair, excellent facial
skin care and waxed eye-brows! That's funny!

The US soldiers repaired a truck at the scene and went
back to the original abandoned Taliban facility to repair
a radio found at the refugee camp.
The US soldiers made contact with their base for a rescue
pickup.

Taliban soldiers appear again, a firefight ensues.
Lieutenant Stanley catches a grenade (you read that right!)
that was thrown into the building and throws it back! :-)
You have less than 4 seconds to dodge a grenade after
its pin is pulled and the grenade thrown. Didn't the Army
teach you that, Lieutenant?!

Earthworms appear again and pick off the Taliban one by one because
the sound of the gunfire was disturbing their afternoon nap.
They later chomped off an injured US soldier as the American soliders
tried to run.

With the help of the Afghan man they met earlier, the US soldiers
fled into the caves. The Afghani man steps on a mine, gets blown
up. The cave entrances were sealed. An opening was discovered
and the little girl was tasked to go through it and find
a way out from the outside. The girl bumped into Taliban soliders
and got saved when the earthwroms appeared out of nowhere and wanted
an afternoon snack. In the turmoil that followed, the girl
found a way out for the US soldiers. Only 2 left now.

Lieutenant Stanley straps a suicide belt, just in case.
Captain Henle takes care of the little girl.
They throw grenades to distract the earthworms till they
run out.
A rescue chopper comes in time, fires at one earthworm,
rescues the stranded trio.

While the chopper was flying away, one giant earthworm
heads towards it. Lieutenant Stanley jumps out of the chopper
and bravely sacrifices himself into the jaws of the giant beast
so that the chopper can get away. Triggering the suicide belt
that was strapped on himself earlier, he blows the monster up.

That's how it all ends folks - what an anti-climax!
At the very least, Ms Sexy Blonde Captain Henle was saved in the
rescue chopper...

3923021,1,B002FOFX7E,"One night, I was channel surfing and had the misfortune of flipping to the SyFy channel, or however they spell it this week, and came face to face with this steaming pile of crap.  The thing that first struck me was the fact that everything was ""shaking"" like the cameraman was an 8 year old child with ADD and had downed an entire case of RedBull.  The little SyFy logo was not shaking, so I figured this wasn't a problem with my TV or the channel, but a VERY poorly made movie.  I assume the plot is a bunch of US Soldiers are in Iraq and are attacked by sandworms, or something.  I couldn't even watch long enough to understand the plot due to many, MANY problems:

1)  The already mentioned camera shaking
2)  TERRIBLE acting.  I mean, REALLY BAD.  It's akin to several drunk stereotypical ""frat boys"" attempting to act.
3)  They obviously had NO consultant on anything military, as one of the first three characters I saw was a female whose uniform had both Ranger and Special Forces tabs.  Ok, really?  Really???  for those who don't know, NEITHER Ranger or SF allow females.  And below both tabs, her unit patch was ABSENT...so what, now she's a Delta Operator???

I could go on, but here's the bottom line...spend $13.49, or whatever they're attempting to swindle out of you to purchase this movie, on a BETTER movie.  There are so many other better acted and directed horror and science fiction movies out there, that there is absolutely NO POINT to EVER pay money, or even waste time watching this.  Don't buy this, don't rent it, don't even watch it free on TV.  This is yet another movie that never should have been made, or at least should have been edited properly.",1251936000,3,1679,4.5215946843853825

3923082,2,B002FOFX7E,"Like many said, it's like tremors. Going straight to the point, there's a lot of bad acting and really bad script to follow. I found the action very lacking because I wanted to see more monster-related action. However, being obviously low budget, the worms are just there for show, you don't ever see one truly explode or any cool, epic, or memorable scenes. They were decently created, but again, it's just there for show.

There were no truly suspenseful moments in this movie that put me somewhat close to the edge of my seat, second guessing what might happen. Soldiers got  worm issues, finally got helped and got out of there. The movie had a boring, too straight forward storyline without any real twist, it ran a typical hour and a half, only a handful of people survived in the end, usually that's about 1-3 as the typical number. Bored me, will not watch again.",1299456000,,871,4.612903225806452
3923083,3,B002FOFX7E,"I enjoy this type movie. Reminds me of all the SciFi movies that came out in the 1930s-1950s. They may not be overly well acted, but they are certainly entertaining to watch. Even classics like Frankenstein never got rave reviews from the critics. So I expect them to turn noses up at this one. If you enjoy SciFi movies about giant monsters you will probably find this worth watching. Rent it and then you can decide if it is worth buying. I think the current price is reasonable for the story, casting, directing, special effects, and music. if you enjoyed this, catch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raptor-Island/dp/B000HDRB7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raptor Island</a>

3923084,2,B002FOFX7E,"Sand Serpents is actually about giant worms.  ""Sand Worms"" doesn't quite have the alliterative quality to it, so Sand Serpents it is.

Like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Manticore/dp/B000UYN9PO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Manticore</a>, horror filmmakers have found America's overseas operations a real goldmine of new settings to play in.  Every ancient evil can be played out against a backdrop of conflict, which means there are plenty of soldiers with guns available to helplessly fire at the beast. Who needs the Colonial Marines from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens/dp/B000G6BM00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens</a>&nbsp;when we've got real Marines?

That's the sales pitch anyway.  The truth is that director Jeff Renfroe just wants to remake&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tremors/dp/0783226837/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tremors</a>.

Because it's Afghanistan (instead of Iraq, like in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Manticore/dp/B000UYN9PO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Manticore</a>) there's lots of talk about the Taliban, captives getting their heads cut off, and innocent citizens caught in the crossfire.  It's pretty clear that Renfroe has a political ideology he wants to push, and he pushes hard.

In between the proselytizing, cardboard characters get eaten by giant worms.  These worms are bigger than the critters from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tremors/dp/0783226837/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tremors</a>. They're Dune big, which makes them nigh impossible to shoot or really avoid.  The worms are fond of chomping down on top of anybody stupid enough to stand out in the open and, just like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tremors/dp/0783226837/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tremors</a>, they navigate by sound. When they're on camera, the worms are suitably imposing.  Most of the time, see the worm's point of view, which involves soldiers shooting over their shoulders at the camera while they flee. It's about as exciting as it sounds.

One by one, the stereotypes (angry black guy, underclass girl scrabbling for a second chance, sarcastic guy, dweeb who just wants to get home to his family, etc.) are sucked up into those awful maws.  Occasionally, the Taliban gets caught too. The movie's emotional core rests on the small shoulders of a young girl and the wide-eyed blonde private (Tamara Hope as Jan Henle) who's determined to save her.

The problem is that young girl doesn't speak English, so she conveys emotion with only her eyes.  Cute as she is, this gets old fast.  Henle, on the other hand, has all the charisma of a rock - she speaks her lines like she's in some sort of trance. Her foil is the team's captain, played by Jason Gedrick.  Gedrick tries hard to whip up something, anything, between him and Henle but there's nothing there. He has a more convincing connection to the worms.

Speaking of the worms, Renfroe has a message that involves American soldiers wearing suicide belts.  The movie's final iconic scene (interrupted by a commercial on Syfy channel - I nearly shut my Tivo off because I thought the movie was over) is both disturbing and peculiar.  What's the director trying to say?  Where did the giant worms come from? And why isn't anyone calling in a missile strike on worms that can be seen from space?

Sand Serpents doesn't have any answers because it's like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tremors/dp/0783226837/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tremors</a>&nbsp;without humor, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dune/dp/B00371QQ0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dune</a>&nbsp;without religion - just another can of worms.",1287360000,8,3934,6.733201581027668
3923085,3,B002FOFX7E,"The acting and special effects are a notch above the usual RHI production on Sand Serpents. I found the Sand Serpents to be very realistic looking, perhaps because underground creatures don't need a lot of detail and color. However, the film sagged at points where characters bickered while waiting to be attacked. Perhaps a little humor would have helped. By the way, Jason Gedrick was actually quite good as a weary, on-edge soldier.",1282521600,,435,4.972602739726027
3923086,2,B002FOFX7E,"Part of the Manhunter series, Sand Serpents (2009) is set in Afghanistan, and follows the ill fated adventures of a small group of US army soldiers, who are threatened not only by the Taliban, but also by giant carnivorous creatures that live underground.

The completely computer generated ""sand serpents"", actually look more like worms.  The special effects are decent, although nothing new or original.  The worms are so huge, that only explosives seem to be effective at injuring or killing them.  Perhaps their size contributes to their hearty appetite, as the creatures are willing to travel underground for great distances, and then pop up for a bite to eat.  No explanation is given for the monsters presence.

The army unit is led by Lt. Richard Stanley (Jason Gedrick), with Captain Jan Henle (Tamara Hope) along as an advisor.  The soldiers appear to be reservists, rather than career soldiers, perhaps reflecting current conditions in the military.  There is plenty of bickering and backtalk in the ranks.  The unit runs into a civilian and his daughter, who become their guide, as they attempt to evade the enemy and the worms, long enough to be evacuated.

Outside of the worms and a couple of minor action scenes, there isn't a lot to recommend here.  The soldiers don't seem to be very competent or likeable, and their numbers steadily decline with each misstep.  Lt. Stanley's actions in the final scene, puts a nice cap on this disastrous mission, that you can probably catch on SyFy if you are really interested.",1277942400,,1531,4.9375

Worse, when the creatures aren't present the story stalls, lost to needless conversations that don't help matters much because most of the characters aren't that nice or at the very least interesting.  There's also a shocking lack of discipline in this group, led by an obnoxiously seditious private who just can't keep his trap shut.  They also use this same crabby complainer to narrate the story in a couple of rants, as though we require some type of background information and a rehash of the story up to that point!  It's a pretty simple plot.  There's a mission, it immediately goes wrong, they have to fight their way out of it and reach the extraction point.  It's not that complicated.  (It's also quite obvious that the filmmakers have a very low opinion of the military.)  It's handled pretty much as one would expect from this type of movie.
