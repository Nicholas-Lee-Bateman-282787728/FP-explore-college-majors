It begins with a barn dance. Joan dances with Harvey. She doesnt like banker Moline. Outside Harvey signals to men that the coast is clear. Joan explains to her father why she doesnt like the banker. Three men ride away; what were they doing by the bank? Three masked men enter the barn with drawn guns. One dances with Joan, then removes his mask. Doug gives a key to Harvey, but drops his bandanna. Doug rides with Joan, they hear gunshots. Doug Redfern races away. Three men shot at another, he gets off his horse. This man is a stranger, hes looking for work. Harvey rides by, there is a conflict with Doug. Lucky Garden asks Harvey for work. Harvey needs more money to drill for oil.

Doug follows Harvey to watch him. There is a shot. Lucky meets Harvey again. Back in town Doug meets Joans father, the Sheriff, and tells why he doesnt like Harvey. Doug is given a letter, it has a message from Joan. When he leaves someone shoots at him. Doug races after this man, but another knocks him out. Back home Doug discovers planted evidence. Harvey and his men search and find dollars in Dougs house from a bank robbery, but no gold coins. Doug is found guilty of the robbery by a jury and given twenty years. Harveys men dig up Dougs yard looking for the gold coins. Doug shows up to stop them and sends them away. They tell Harvey. How did Doug get loose? He was paroled. Doug arrives in town and sees the Sheriff.

The Sheriff advises Doug to move to a new area and start over. Doug tells Harvey to get out of town by sundown. Lucky suggests Harvey find a gunman to shoot Doug. There is a shot in Dougs room! Doug walks outside, he is accused of shooting Lucky. Will he be lynched? Lucky walks out and explains his undercover work for the Governor [Surprised?] The Sheriff arrests Harveys man. Harvey grabs his records and cash to leave. Lucky explains that Harvey robbed his own bank to get funds to drill for oil. Joan tells them Harvey is getting away. Doug chases after him, other men follow. There is a fight on the wagon! Lucky finds the records to prove bank looting.

This has a fairly complex story that uses the motives of love and greed as motives for crimes. The idea of a banker taking bank funds for his personal use must have occurred enough times to make this story believable. Since Roosevelts New Deal created banking regulations that insured depositors would get their money. This required examiners to audit banks regularly. Before this a bank robbery would create a local economic hardship due to a loss of cash needed for commerce.",1510012800,,2586,4.4724576271186445

7968131,4,B00006G8F1,"Republic Pictures presents ""PAROLED TO DIE"" (11 January 1938) (55 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Bob Steele was an American actor --- He was born Robert Adrian Bradbury in 1907 in Portland, Oregon, into a vaudeville family --- Bob's career began to take off for good in 1927, when he was hired by production company Film Booking Offices of America (FBO) to star in a series of Westerns. Bob--who was rechristened Bob Steele at FBO--soon made a name for himself, and in the late 1920s, 1930s and 1940s starred in B-Westerns for almost every minor film studio, including Monogram, Supreme, Tiffany, Syndicate, Republic (including several films of the Three Mesquiteers series) and Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC) (including the initial films of their ""Billy the Kid"" series)

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, that ""new medium"" television had many hours to fill and few dollars to fill them --- They re-discovered the B-Western, still a popular mainstay of Saturday afternoon matinees and many cowboy stars thrilled a new audience --- Taking advantage of this rebirth in popularity, publishers brought to the marketplace comic books featuring these western heroes of ""Bob Steele"" Westerns --- These bimonthly issues were copyrighted in February and April of 1950 by Fawcet Publications --- His career which included nearly 200 feature films, serials and TV appearances --- Steele in his twilight years at the age 59 when he got the part of the cantankerous ""Trooper Duffy"", in the western comedy series ""F Troop"" (1965), who at the drop of a hat would give his rendition of fighting ""shoulder to shoulder with Davy Crockett at the Alamo"" --- Steele retired from the screen in 1973 --- Bob's long career, spanning more than 50 years came to an end in 1988 when he passed away.
