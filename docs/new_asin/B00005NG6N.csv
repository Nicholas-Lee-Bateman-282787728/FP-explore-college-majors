7946898,3,B00005NG6N,"Compared to ""American Pimp"" and ""Pimp's Up..."", this video (you really can't call it a film), is of low quality. It's not even so much a documentary. Rather, Pimpin' Ken Ivy, just seems to turn the camera on and he, and others, say what they have to say. It doesn't really break any new ground. If you saw ""AP"" and ""PUHD"", and expect to learn something new or different from ""Pimpology Uncut"", then don't get this video, because you won't. However, if you want to experience more pimpin' and be immersed in their environment, this may be worthwile to you. The nudity content is HIGH, and is at times, GRAPHIC and gynecological. So if you are offended by nudity, then you may want to skip this video as well. And if you don't know the language of pimpin', this video will be hard to follow. So I say, if you are REALLY into this subject...spend the money for this video. If you take just a casual interest in this subject, then it's best to stick with ""AP"" and ""PUHD"". Video quality ranges from good to fair. Sound quality and mixing is ""primative"". Definitely a LOW BUDGET affair. I guess Ken Ivy spent more money on his cars and jewels, than on this production. Eh, I'm not hating, because I bought the video, and it's fairly interesting.",1027900800,11,1239,4.486725663716814
