8482826,2,B005Q0FO5U,"The packaging on this DVD lead me to think it was a program about the whole state of Montana.  Instead it consisted of just two old episodes of Travel Scope (not a bad series of travel shows overall).  One was about the Flathead Lake area and Glacier National Park and the other was entitled ""Custer Country"".  These 2 shows should have been packaged for what they were, two episodes of Travel Scope about two parts of MT, not a DVD about the the state as a whole.",1366156800,9,464,4.310344827586207
