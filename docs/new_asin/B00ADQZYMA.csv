8550138,3,B00ADQZYMA,"Fairy Tale Killer is a psycho-thriller written and directed by Danny Pang (co-director of The Eye, Bangkok Dangerous, and The Messengers) in collaboration with director of photography Decha Srimantra (The Eye, Chocolate). The DVD is available from Terracotta Distribution, specifically Terror Cotta, an imprint devoted to Asian horror and thrillers.

Police detective Han (Lau Ching-wan) and his team make an unforgivable error in judgment when they release a mentally unbalanced man named Jun (Wang Baoqiang). While answering routine questions, Jun confesses to a murder and identifies his victim. Officers soon locate the supposed victim, who is alive and well. So, they let Jun go with a warning about making up stories and misleading the police. A few days later, the named victim turns up dead and Jun is nowhere to be found.

For the rest of the film, Detective Han tracks his suspect through a grisly series of meticulously staged murders. Han is a crime thriller anti-hero, accepting responsibility for catching the killer while covering up and lying about the mistake his team has made.

Han is also a father. His inability to accept his son's autism, and his wife's determination to coax creativity from the boy, has crippled Han personally and professionally. As he pieces together clues about the murder case, Han begins to see that the methods chosen by Jun (and an accomplice) are taken from popular fairy tales.

The film is over-the-top in its depiction of a killer whose derangement would, in real life, preclude his ability to set up Hannibal- and Jigsaw-worthy traps. The final sequence is especially contrived, with our hero placed in a do-or-die situation that is part Heroic Trio and part Scooby Doo.

Yet the heart of the story remains true enough. Fairy Tale Killer is, essentially, about Han's relationship with his son and his wife. He has an extraordinary job, and it takes an extraordinary case to pull him out of his numb acceptance of life's unfairness. He has to be tested, to find his inner strength and his devotion to his loved ones. Along the way some despicable individuals receive their just reward for cruelty, and Han has a chance to see what his son might face without a loving family. Jun's violence is the culmination of many years of abuse and deprivation, but this point has to be made for Han in the most extreme manner before he can understand it.

There is a combination of fatalism and possibility to Fairy Tale Killer. What has happened to Jun, the cruelties that have made him a murderer, cannot be undone. He isn't a sociopath, but a man with a misunderstood condition pushed beyond the limit of his sense of justice and outrage. Han can only address what he sees in Jun by bringing his own son closer and finding in himself the strength to provide unqualified love.
