7858620,3,6303995942,"Paracelsus (arch-nemesis to the tunnel dwellers) kidnaps Catherine in order to lure Vincent into a trap.  Vincent and friends encounter some (perhaps overly) fanciful settings as they venture deeply below ground in  seach of Catherine.  We eventually get a WWF-style wrestling match between  Vincent and a very large man as a chained damsel-in-distress (Catherine)  looks on.  What Paracelsus wants to achieve by setting up this whole thing  is not entirely clear.  Paracelsus' actions are particularly puzzling when  one considers his behavior in later episodes (when Vincent seems to be the  apple of his eye).  ""To Reign in Hell"" does have some good  moments, including some mournful ones.
In 1998 I conducted a poll among  Beauty and the Beast fans asking them to rate the 44 episodes of the first  two seasons on a 1-to-10 scale.  31 fans participated.  ""To Reign in  Hell"" finished 25th out of the 44 episodes.
I placed ""To Reign  in Hell"" 34th in my own personal rank-ordering of the episodes.",960249600,2,1000,4.9939024390243905
7858621,1,6303995942,"Paracelsus, an old enemy of Vincent's, kidnaps Catherine and Vincent goes in search of her.  She is being held deep down in the sewers, a few days travel for Vincent.  Most of the show is about Vincent's journey which is  mind-numblingly boring. I found myself fast forwarding through much of it.  Catherine is hardly in the show at all, and she is the main reason I watch.  Please do not buy this video.  It is sorely disappointing.",951609600,,433,4.558441558441558
