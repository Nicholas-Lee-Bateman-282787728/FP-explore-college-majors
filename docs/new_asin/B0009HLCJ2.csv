With this double feature, you get half and half: one film entitled ""Star Reporter"" that is so snowy, blurry and muddy that it is unwatchable; and the other film entitled ""Headline Crasher"" that is watchable, but has soft focus, a few splices and jumps with some missed dialogue, and a fair amount of background hiss.

Having said that, I watched the second feature ""Headline Crasher"" (1937, about 60 minutes) that starred Frankie Darrow, Kane Richmond, and Muriel Evans. Over the last few years, I've grown fond of Frankie Darrow's Poverty Row movies, and ""Headline Crasher"" does not stray from his usual formula. This film is fast-paced and even thought-provoking in places.

Frankie is James ""Jimmy"" Tallent, Jr., the son of U.S. Senator James Tallent of California.  Jimmy is a kid of about 18 who lives in the fast lane and enjoys all the good life that his father's money can provide. But Jimmy is also a good kid with a heart of gold who will help anyone in trouble.  Jimmy's father is running for his third term in the U.S. Senate and has an underhanded newspaper publisher running against him.

The corrupt newspaper publisher instructs his reporters, including ace reporter Kane Richmond, to follow Jimmy around and try to dig up dirt on him. Also, the newspaper boss tells his reporters, ""If you can't find anything on the kid, make it up.""  And that's exactly what happens.

Over the next few weeks,  Jimmy finds himself on the front pages in trumped-up stories, all in an effort to undermine his father's re-election efforts.  The bad publicity finally reaches a point where Jimmy decides to leave town and go to this father's lodge a few miles out of Los Angeles until things cool off in the papers.

In the meantime, a gangster is recently released from prison who has a grudge against Senator Tallent and vows to murder him. He heads for the lodge, too, with a plan to lure Senator Tallent there. He doesn't know that Tallent has sent his pretty and resourceful secretary played by Muriel Evans to the lodge to look for Jimmy. Kane Richmond arrives at the lodge at about the same time as the others and that's when the fireworks begin.

""Headline Crasher"" is a great little Poverty Row film with a cast of actors who don't let ""working for scale"" stand in their way of delivering first class performances. It's an entertaining way to pass an hour if you don't mind the condition of a film that is a long way from ""TCM quality.""",1340064000,2,2697,4.678646934460888
8061036,2,B0009HLCJ2,"The file features the services of many fine actors, and is worth seeing.  The transfer by Alpha Video (oldies.com) is very poor and looks like it was transferred from a poor VHS copy.  In addition to many scratches and jumpiness it has excessive noise with not very good resolution.  The CD does play just fine.  The packaging is very nice and may be worth the price if low enough, but it is wasted on the quality of the CD.  I have a much better VHS copy from Sinister Cinema, but unfortunately it is not currently in their catalog.",1152316800,3,533,4.3979591836734695
