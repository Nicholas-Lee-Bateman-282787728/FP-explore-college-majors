8067436,3,B0009VIHNW,"I liked Sensei Kanazawa Shotokan'series. This DVD series is rather good but there is no advance Kata. There is a huge misleading information about this DVD series, please be aware that Gojushiho sho/dai and Nijoshiho and Unsu/sochin/ etc is NOT included. It make this DVD series of less valuable.

Again, I am dissapointed because I was misled by the wrong info, if you hoping to see advance kata then look somewhere else. Otherwise the quality of bunkai/form/explaination is just as great!",1139961600,3,490,5.049382716049383

Production quality is at the lower end of the amateur market-the JKA or Kawasoe series and the ""All Kata of Shotokan Karate"" series by the same author, are far better quality for up to 70% less money!",1131235200,2,347,4.704918032786885
