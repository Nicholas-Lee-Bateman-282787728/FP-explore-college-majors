8426301,5,B004DYQ7U6,"OK, I admit it! I have become a massive Bollywood fan! Shahrukh Khan converted me!

These are 8 of his films. All are good! But are they the best? Hmm..., with so many to choose from, I suggest you begin with these and just purchase the rest as you can find them. All are good.

If you only have time for 1 and have the guts, go with 'My Name is Khan': about a fellow with mild Asperger's Syndrome trying to make his way after the events of early September 2001. He's a Muslim... and not a terrorist... but just try to convince the average person on the street.

SRK is fabulous in this role.

But OK, back to these 8 films.... Let me get the box and I will make a few specific comments....

OMG! I can't find my copy!!!!

All right, be calm... deep breaths....

OK, I'm better now and I will not reorder them immediately.... I will probably find them... (a friend helped me clean up my apartment and I can't find my hat, much less a set of wonderful DVDs, so I'll just have to poke deeper!).

Look, just get these DVD..., watch them..., allow yourself to be converted..., and go for as many others as you can find....

Be well...",1354838400,,1130,4.21860465116279
