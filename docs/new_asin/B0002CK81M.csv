8026057,1,B0002CK81M,looks like a faded vhs tape.  It never should have been sold.,1421712000,,61,4.083333333333333
8026058,3,B0002CK81M,The DVD was scanned in from a cheap VHS. Distorted from start to finish. Would have rated it lower if it hadn't been the ONLY source for this charming flick...,1408060800,,159,4.333333333333333
8026059,2,B0002CK81M,"This DVD is very bad quality.

Both sound and image are awful.

And on top of that, the DVD jams before the end, I never could see the conclusion.

It's too bad for the movie that seems to be good.",1268956800,,197,3.875
8026060,5,B0002CK81M,"I was swept up with powerful emotions ranging from intense pity and sadness to rage and shame. The Mr. Johnson Character is so confused, and deluded that he has no great regard even for himself. His shame and self-hatred shows deep emotional and psychological maladaption as he ingratiates himself to the Europeans who work in his community.

I almost wept in pity for the character who was so distant from appreciating himself and his own culture that he disowned any connection to his own people. This was a great case study of the psychological effects of racial oppression (i.e. Franz Fanon).

I highly recommend this film for people who wish to see the effects racial oppression and the loss of personal and cultural identity as a human being. Further proof that racism should be classified as a mental illness.",1264809600,,816,4.863309352517986
8026061,1,B0002CK81M,"The story line is decent and entertaining enough but the Video quality is very poor. I'm not sure when this was put onto DVD but it should be redone. Perhaps I got a bootlegged copy because mine was so poor that it didn't even have the ending on it, I'm sitting there watching him be weighed in the chair and then it just stopped. The DVD was purchased from Amazon so I doubt it is bootlegged.",1215907200,3,393,4.184210526315789
8026062,5,B0002CK81M,"I particularly liked this movie because the main character, Mr. Johnson, who was black was trying so hard to be a proper English gentleman in the small village of East Africa. Putting on airs & talking the administrator into thinking there was more money for building roads when there wasn't. In essence, embezzling. Living from hand to mouth until finally killing someone & facing the gallows. You feel sorry for Mr. Johnson at the same time wondering how he can get away with all his shenanigans. But the administrator is an enabler & is partly to blame.",1199664000,,556,4.742268041237113
8026063,4,B0002CK81M,"I appreciate the previous reviewer's tip.  I was shopping for this item to show it to my World History class.  The film does an excellent job of demonstrating the position of the indigene (Mr. Johnson) trying to navigate his way between serving the British imperialist class (represented by Pierce Briosnan's character) while trying to maintain his Africanness in the eyes of his Nigerian fellows.  While this undoubtedly made few waves at the box office or with the Academy, it is an excellent portrayal of the confused comprador and the strains which European imperialism placed on the identities of indigenous peoples who served as functionaries within imperialist infrastructures- all done with a workaday touch.  Johnson attempts to please both classes of people- pining for Christmas in an England he has never known, yet secretly slipping out of his English shoes before entering the village so as not to upset the sensibilities of his fellow Nigerians.  A really well-told tale of tragic identity crisis.
 BUT, while I recommend this very good film- especially for educational purposes- to anyone interested in imperialism, I will try to buy it on VHS thanks to the previous reviewer's scouting efforts.",1185062400,6,1211,5.216494845360825
8026064,1,B0002CK81M,"If the packaging doesn't frighten you away, the transfer will.  The package is covered with scans from the movie that a 10 year old could make on their home computer.  The DVD transfer looks like it was taken from a VHS tape.  The telltale glitch VHS is at the bottom of the frame the whole time.  This is not what DVDs were made to do.  Everything about it says amateur.  Watch this movie on VHS, the quality will probably be better than this version.  This is an excellent movie that deserves far better than this treatment.",1106697600,14,526,4.416666666666667
