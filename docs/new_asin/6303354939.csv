635373,5,6303354939,"Pauly Shore plays "" Bones Conway"" who signs up in the Reserves to Chad and ends up being a troublemaker for the army. Hilarious and wonderful, it proves that Pauly Shore can't always be annoying and it sure will satisify anyone's laughing taste.
Recommendations: Son-in-Law, Jury Duty.",989020800,,285,5.085106382978723
635374,5,6303354939,"Just like Jury Duty, Son in Law but never "" Bio-Dome"", this is what Shore proves to be funny and at his best.",987465600,,109,3.782608695652174
635375,5,6303354939,"This movie is so funny!  Every time I see it I laugh at new things that I've just noticed for the first time.  Pauly Shore is VERY funny, but even while you're laughing at his escapades at mistakes, you are also really  rooting for him, wanting him to succeed.  Yet you're still rolling around  on the floor. This movie is, without question, one of the best movies I've  seen, and well worth the money.",963187200,,402,4.364864864864865
635376,3,6303354939,"i can honestly admit this movie is far from oscar material... really, this movie was stupid. but it brings back memories.. lol and it's true. i mean i remember when i saw this movie with my friend, we must of laughed at the  most stupidest jokes.. but the movie was really fun.. we liked it because  we both knew it was stupid. we would watch this movie like when ever we got  bored... we still do sometimes... and the weirdest thing is we still  laugh.. and trust me, the jokes really are stupid. but watch it with a  friend that you always laugh with, because you will have good memories  later.",952905600,,597,4.333333333333333

635658,4,6303354939,"Bones (Pauly Shore) and his friend Jack (Andy Dick) find that they are not quite ept at selling or much of anything for that matter. They find the perfect solution, the U.S. Army Reserves just a weekend each month and two weeks a year and they pay you. One can even learn a new skill.

Quickly thinking they chose water purification knowing that they would be the last to be called in the event of a conflict. Oops just what is needed in the desert. They make a last ditch effort to avoid mobilization by insisting that they are ""funny that way."" The Sergeant calls on them to prove it. Bones replies, ""Is it hot in Chad?""

So the adventure begins with a gung ho buddy Christine (Lori Petty), Special Forces and a camel.

Will they survive and what lessens do they learn?
What is that that the camel is standing on?

The comedy is more in the Shore line with double-entendres and situations more than sophomoric slapstick. (With a few exceptions)",1504483200,,946,4.482558139534884
635659,5,6303354939,"It is a ""b"" comedy movie. But a entertaining one! Lets stay for a Pauly Shore Movie this is the best supporting case..You couldn't pick anyone better to do the roles! the start ..is a little dumb..but then it gets good .Since I like to put things into movies that I feel they could have done better..let say..A good powerful sound track..maybe an ACDC song..since that seems to be the norm in war movies. This would be good to sell with Spys like Us. IT is a ""B"" movie..but a fun one!",1502323200,,484,4.271739130434782

635989,3,6303354939,"I bought this movie for my husband, apparently he's a big Pauly Shore fan, which I wasn't aware of until recently...  It's an old movie, and if you're familiar with Pauly Shore, which I wasn't, I'm sure you'd find it hilarious.  I didn't.  It was an ""okay"" attempt at comedy, but didn't really hold my attention for very long.  Save your money.... unless of course your [loved one] is a Pauly Shore fan.",1481846400,,403,4.47945205479452

635992,5,6303354939,"In the Army Now is what I like to refer to as the conclusion to Pauly Shore's great comedy trilogy preceded by Encino Man (which frankly, Shore's responsible for atleast 65% of its success) and Son in Law. Pauly Shore will sadly never get the credit he deserved. He was a highly unique, original and brilliant comic talent and personality and In the Army Now is one of his most underrated movies (though I'm thrilled to see that this along with Encino Man and Son in Law have very well deserved high ratings here on Amazon). I really hope that these 3 comedy classics get proper blu ray treatment someday. Maybe as a Pauly Shore triple feature!",1479081600,4,644,4.512820512820513

637187,5,6303354939,"IN THE ARMY NOW

I will admit it right here and now, I am a Pauly Shore fan. I think a lot of people who read this will ask me why or something but half of them are probably closet fans. Plus I am sure most would admit to liking at least one of his movies. These are those types of guilty pleasures for people but I have to say I enjoy them. Now this is not my favorite of his films but I do like it and the characters in it.

The story follows two friends that are your everyday slackers looking for an easy payday. They here how easy the reserves are and go ahead and sign up. It becomes a little harder then they thought but they make a few new friends in basic training. They all sign up for the water detail since they think it is the easiest there is. Little did they know it would be the first to be called to duty. Once in the desert they deal with their situation day by day being picked on by the veterans and higher ranking officers. That is until they get lost in the desert after an attack on their convoy. Now they are lost with little water and the enemy lurking some where in the hot sun.

This is not the greatest movie ever made or even the greatest comedy ever but it is fun. Pauly Shore's brand of humor and style is not for every body but for those who like it this is one of his better films. Also Andy Dick was a great choice here for his buddy and sidekick. These two together make a great on screen team and next to Shore Dick is not his usual crazy self like in other films. Also the great David Alan Grier shines as usual here and was a wonderful addition to the cast. Then of course the female of the group [every good group has to have one] Lori Petty rounds out the click very nicely.

This is a funny movie although not a laugh out loud constantly flick but it is funny. The group here and the people they cast make for a charismatic cast. In the Pauly Shore flicks this may be my third favorite or something like that. ""In the Army Now"" is one of those flicks that are good for a day you have with nothing to do, stupid funny sometimes hits the mark.",1362787200,,2082,3.9975961538461537

637427,3,6303354939,"Whatever happened to Pauley Shore? I guess he's still around but you didn't hear much from him after this movie, which was a decent success. It was a surprisingly-good lightweight comedy with a bunch of likable goofs and weirdos from Glendale, California, and their adventures after they join the Army Reserves.

The language was pretty tame in here but there were a lot of sexual innuendos, too many for a PG rating but not surprising in a modern-day comedy. That comedy overall is good with some laugh-out-loud scenes.

Also, as with many films, the ending gets carried away. It was really dumb, but for most of this movie it was entertaining enough to certainly recommend if you need a laugh.",1235606400,3,695,4.783333333333333

637431,3,6303354939,"This movie never quite makes it to the level of being classically funny, but it does try. Made in the 1990s following Desert Storm, the movie follows a couple of losers who join the Army Reserve for a cash bonus, never dreaming that they might be sent to Chad to fight the Libyans.

The movie has ""Desert Storm"" written all over it, from the uniforms to the jokes but the producers clarly made an effort to put together a movie that at least TRIED to get it right. Some genuinely laugh-out-loud  moments make it worth watching but not worth watchng over and over again.",1200700800,,569,4.461538461538462

NOT FOR CHILDREN THOUGH!!",1168300800,,324,4.366666666666666
637435,3,6303354939,"This film is typical of the Pauly Shore screwup comedy, but is definitely better than Bio-Dome. Pauly is the definite star of the film with the much less talented Andy Dick playing the sidekick. They join the Army reserve because it's easy money and they choose water purification as their army specialty as that is the least likely in their pea-sized brains to see combat (I bet you can't guess where this is going.)

Before long they are on a mission to Chad and off to war. Now let's ponder this for a moment...this is a Pauly Shore slapstick comedy about making potable water in Chad. As improbable as that sounds for a movie project, that's the bottom line, and before it's over Pauly becomes a war hero and gets the pretty girl with the crew cut.

While most of the movie was pretty lowbrow, there were a couple of things I really liked. My favorite character was Fred Ostroff, played by David Alan Grier, who is a paranoid dental student, and who has the consistently best lines (like the ""emotional enema"" line from which I took the title of my review) and humorous vignettes, most of which feature dental flossing technique demonstrations.

Far and away, though, my favorite bit in the movie is an ultra-obscure reference the writers slipped in to a very bad movie from 1980, ""The Pumaman."" Pauly Shore apes the brutish Vadinho when he seductively says to a starlet ""I couldn't have done it without the inspirational guidance of my brother the Pumaman."" This line won't make sense if you haven't seen ""The Pumaman,"" but for those that have it is pure gold.

The movie is silly and will please fans of Shore and the brain-dead-stoner comedy genre. Three stars for the dentistry and Pumaman references.",1144454400,3,1709,4.6866666666666665
637496,5,6303354939,"First, off, if it has Pauly Shore it is pretty much guaranteed to be funny.  In this comedy, Pauly Shore and his buddy sign up to be in the reserves because they need the money, little does he know when he picks their area of expertise, water clarifacation, that it is something that will actually be needed and they get called into active duty.  Watch this movie!",1130976000,,364,4.417910447761194

637498,3,6303354939,"After I graduated from Basic Training (I went to Ft. Leonard Wood, not Fort Sill) I was in this ""Army movie kick"".  I watched all sorts of military movies, from funny, to serious, to ridiculous.  I was surprised to find that the basic training scenes in this film are very realistic (to extents).  I was shocked to see cattle cars, gig lines, ""drop the pin, throw the grenade"", and the way Pauly Shore says ""Drill Sergeant"" is perfect.  It is lacking in a few areas.  First of all, flirting with a drill sergeant is the absolute last thing you would ever do.  In the real Army, Pauly Shore would have probably been chaptered out of the Army for such fraternization.

The rest of this movie is just silly.  The broad variety of characters keeps the movie interesting, but unfortunately, the plot thins out in the middle and I found myself wishing it would get to the point.  There are some funny one liners in the film, such as, ""Son, I'm your First Sergeant"".  ""I'm sorry, but I've already had a few.""

It's worth the time to watch it, especially if you've gone through basic training in the past 12 years.  Give it a try.",1118880000,5,1122,4.446078431372549

Pauly Shore and Andy Dick need money after losing their jobs, find their way to the Army reserve recruitment center (quick money, easy hours, right? right???), and all is fun and games until they are called up because of a small type war in Libya... And guess what? Yep, Pauly and Andy save the day. It's formula, it's predictable at times, but it's just too fun to resist. I enjoyed my afternoon with this movie. I'm getting the DVD.
