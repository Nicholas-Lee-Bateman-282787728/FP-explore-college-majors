2487150,1,B000E3LGMY,"I rented this movie because I have recently gained interest in Japanese horror films as many people recently have. This one looked interesting and it was directed by Takashi, who directed ""Juon""- which quite possibly could be the most disturbing motion picture I have ever seen. Forget about ""The Grudge"". It doesn't even come close to the impact of ""Juon"".
 But ""Marebito"" was highly disappionting! For one thing it's not the slightest bit scary, and it's only a little bit creepy. This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. Horror or sci fi? So it becomes neither and is tragically stuck somewhere in the middle.
 The plot is real simple. A man on a quest to be terrified to death embarks on a journey into the underworld of Japan. Along the way he runs into a man that he filmed killing himself. It is never explained whether this man is still alive or if he is a ghost, or if he is a robot or what. This man proceeds to tell him all this longwinded crap about underworlds and how they're all over the world and underground cities. This information serves absolutely NO purpose and has nothing to do with the plot, but for some reason it's in the movie. The guy ends up finding a naked girl in some ancient underground ruins and ends up taking her home. The girl does not talk and eventually we find out she feeds on human blood. But she seems to be no threat to any humans. So the man ends up killing women and draining their blood for the girl to drink. Somewhere in all this mess it's insinuated that the girl is really his daughter and that he killed his wife and fed her blood to the girl. It ends with the girl leading him back down to the nether world, back to where he found her. The last scene is of her filming him and an intense look of terror on his face. But we have no idea why he looks so afraid.
 Much of this movie is shot POV through a handheld camera a la ""The Blairwitch Project"" but nothing ever happens. So it is not scary. I wasted 4 dollers and 92 min. on this film. Now you don't have to.",1143504000,,2018,4.25
2487151,2,B000E3LGMY,"Asian horror is a very nice genre. It has had quite a few atmospheric and just plain spooky movies. For a while, I had completely given up on horror movies, since most US horror was of several different kinds, none of which really thrilled me. First there is the slasher type, ""I know what you did so I'll scream"" type of movie or your basic watch me die horribly, ""My final disemboweling destination"" type, or the bad remake, ""Thirteen mind-bogglingly stupid ghosts"" type.

Then along came J-horror. Its no secret that I really like some of the horror movies than have come out of Asia in the last 7 or 8 years. They did to some extent revitalize  Hollywood's concept of horror. The Ring, aka Ringu Opened up my eyes, as well as many other people's in tems of possibilities for a different direction for horror. Forget the shock, try a spooky atmosphere, more likeolder horror movies of yesteryear. The first theatrical version of Juon: the grudge rocked my world. For the first time, since I was five, a horror movie actually scared me. Not shock, not gross me out, but genuine spooks.

With this introduction, I present Marebito. Why? Because it has none of the atributes mentioned above. Let me be blunt. I was extremely dissapointed in this movie. Directed by Takashi Shimizu, the Director of Juon: The Grudge, and starring Shinya Tsukamoto, I woul have expected better from this movie.

Shinya plays a videographer who wants to understand fear. He wants to understand what people go through when they experience great fear, and what the physical manifestation of it is.  So, he decides to video people as they are scared. At first he thinks that people get scared because they see something horrific, the he decides that the act of being scared almost to death brings about something horrific. One day he is around taping, when someone at the subway commits suicide. After studying and obcessing over this tape, our star realises that there must be an underground under the subway and there must be some sort of ""dorrway"" to that other demonic world, that ""Hell"". He takes his video camera, and proceeds togo down the subway, to a secret cavern well below the city. Here he meets a young naked and mute girl, chained to the wall. He takes her home, where his video hobby has taken over, with lots of video cameras, and lots of monitors  showing both inside and out, as well as TV recpetion all going on simultaneously.

Side note: The man is a video freak. He tapes everything, including just walking down the street-he goes nowhere without his camera. There are times, that his camera picks up things (ghosts?, demons?) that his eyes miss.

Anyway, the girl doesn't really do much, sleeping most of the time, behaving very animalistic but refusing to eat or take any food what-so-ever. One day he cuts his finger, and she shows a definite interest so he lets her lick the blood from it. Realising that she is probably a vampire, he cuts his arm and lets her drink. He then starts bringing her cats and such to feed off of, but its only a natter of tyime before he kills someone, so he can drain their blood to have a steady reserve of blood for the mute to drink. In the mean time, there are strange people calling him, and following him appartently concerned about his new roomate. Eventually, the burden gets to be too much, and our star abandons the mute vampire. Unfortunately for him he has a change of mind, and there is a reunion that I'ld rather not give the  details of.

That's the horror of this movie, but that's not really what the movie is about. To be honest, the movie was about sexual slavery. Yes, vampirism has always had an erotic side, frquently used to represent sexuality and/or sexual experimentation, or liberation, or deviation. Its always been that way throughout history.

This is different. This movie was rather blatant. To put it in a nutshell, the guy kidnaps his daughter, turns her into a sex slave, kills his (ex)wife and feeds her blood, via a baby bottle, to his enslaved daughter. The guy was just plain psychotic. He sopped taking his Prozac, so he could ""focus and think clearer"". He was delusional, paranoid, and heavily hallucinated. Also, the majority of this movie is seen through the video camera-sort of like Juon meets the blair witch project.

This is not a scarey movie, but not really a boring one either. It is mostly an uncomfortable movie. Both my wife and I felt the same way during it. If that was Shimizu's goal, he succeeded, but it sure wasn't a fun movie to watch. Also, this movie was amazingly incoherent, even for J-horror.",1143331200,2,4592,4.662546353522868
2487152,4,B000E3LGMY,"Well I am a fan of Japanese cinema.  I've seen a good deal of films, my favorite films being from Takashi Miike and Shinya Tsukamoto.  My favorite movies in the past have been Ichi the Killer, Gozu, Audition, Tetsuo, as well as other films from them as well as other assorted directors.  Well my friends offered me a trip to a distant theatre to see a stange Japanese film that was rarely talked about.  Marebito was its name.

So after I watched it and left the theatre, I was speechless.  Well let me get this out of the way.  The movie didn't make a damn bit of sense.  There were more plot holes in this movie than can be imagined.  It left open a lot of discussion, but some parts were either too metaphorical, or were just random and unexplained.

Other than that gripe, this was a great movie.  It had a lot of style, and just a real haunting aura to it.  The plot in the movie has something to do with the main character wanting to capture fear on camera, than wishing to experience this fear.  He goes beneath Tokyo, in the advanced subway system.

Before you can scream ""lots-o-literary-referances,"" he winds up in Lovecraft inspired dreamscape where he finds a vampire girl, who is gaurded by robot creatures that walk around on all fours.

Or something like that.  I'm not really too sure.

So he then takes this vampire girl home, and of course, wierd things start happening.  I won't tell too much more of the plot, I'll let you experience it in all of its noncoherant glory.

The film is filled with obscure referances to historical events, as well as scientific theories.  There are all of these subtle commentaries on society, but they aren't exactly executed too well.  In fact, I'm just presuming most of these subtle commentaries existed, because otherwise, a lot of the scenes I witnessed were just random.

Ok, I was a bit harsh on this movie, for the fact that it made no sense.  If you are a fan of japanese cinema, or horror, check this film out.  Its full of style, and wierd / violent going-ons.  I'm so glad I saw this one in the theatres...  Its one of my favorite Japanese films, only second to Tetsuo: Iron Man.",1140134400,11,2142,4.456185567010309

2487155,2,B000E3LGMY,"This monk was the brother in law of Hirohito.  China and Corea should make the familial connections if they want to stop this war.

Count Kozui Otani 1876-1948

Son of the 21st abbot of the West Hongan Monastery, brother-in-law to the Mikado, Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, 22nd Abbot of West Hongan Monastery and the leader of the Jodo Shinzu (Pure Land) Buddhist sect between 1902 and 1914.

He was educated in England, where he developed a passion for the archaeology of Central Asia.

All available information points out to Otani's involvement in Japanese espionage on the Asian mainland, and he was the man coordinating the archaeological/espionage missions along the Silk Road, and in the Taklamakan area in particular. As early as 1901, Otani sponsored 'monks' were studying geography in Oxford, and Otani was quite familiar with the works of the most noted archaeologists and explorers of the time.

The first mission was sent to the Taklamakan in 1902, soon after Stein had published his finds in the area. The Japanese 'archaeologists' (allegedly monks from Nishi Honganji Temple) retrieved Buddhist text and fragments in wicker baskets, and a number of paintings, but failed to publish the results of their expedition. Otani was himself part of the expedition, but had to leave the field and return to Japan due to the death of his father.

In 1908 - changes in the political arena having brought Japan to the fore in the meantime - the British intelligence operatives in Kashmir took much more interest in the second Otani-sponsored expedition. The two Japanese researchers - officially a Buddhist monk and Otani's personal temple secretary - were identified - by a Russian informer - as Zuicho Tachibana, of the Imperial Navy, and Japanese Army captain Eizaburo Nomura.

Incoming from Peking, and using a Mr Ama (about whom more to follow) as a contact in the area, the two men separated for five months, Tachibana executing a series of digs along the southern arm of the Silk Road, while Nomura concentrated his excavations in the northern arm of the Road, finally reaching Kashgar where he was rejoined by his companion (on the actual date of the meeting official papers show one week of discrepancy if compared to official British Intelligence reports).

While officially in Chinese Turkistan 'to make investigations in matters of religious interest', Tachibara and Nomura generally acted in a suspicious way (doing extensive and unrequired surveying and sketching sessions, examining and following the telegraph network). After an exchange of letters between British and Japanese governments, the two men were officially disavowed by their Government. In 1909, Tachibana and Nomura were back in Tokyo.

As for Mr Ama, information is scant - he was officially a buddhist priest of Japanese nationality, but his ties with the Japanese Secret Service were given as certain by British Intelligence. He made frequent trips in the Chinese Turkestan area ('in search of Buddhist remains'), and attracted much attention from Intelligence observers with his frequent detours in Tibetan territory.

In 1910 Zuicho Tachibana is back in Chinese Turkestan for a third expedition, this time accompanied by an Englishman, an O. Hobbs. Penetrating in Chinese Turkestan from Russia, the two men spent four months doing excavations in the Kucha area.

On Jan. 13th 1911, the British authorities in the region received two telegrams:

one informing him that the British A.O. Hobbs had been taken with smallpox
one from Hobbs himself
""I am suffering from skin disease wich has affected all organs I can only keep my eyes open for a few minutes at a time.... My mouth and throat covered with slime and I cannot swallow any food and very little water... For ten days I have been like this and I have not left my bed.""

By Jan. 16th Hobbs is dead.

Tachibana is present at the burial service, and despite being identified as 'the Japanese archaeological traveller', he is shadowed all the same. In one occasion he points towards Tibetan territory - where his sherpas desert him and his burden animals die.

For a certain period Tachibana is reported missing in Japan, probably killed in the Chinese 1911 revolution.

Finally, on Christmas Day 1911 Tachibana meets in Tun-huang Koichiro Yoshikawa, that has been sent personally by Otani to track him down. The two travel extensively together and finally (1914) visit the Caves of the Thousand Buddhas; they are given six hundred texts, mostly sutras from the secret hoard, by the librarian Wang, alone manning the lost library.

And at this point Tachibana takes the long road to Urumchi and disappears without a trace.

At the same time exactly, Count Otani resigns from his position as abbot and leader of Jodo Shinzu and sells his Kyoto residence, claiming financial difficulties.

Not much is known from this point on about his activities - his huge collection of Chinese and Silk Road artefacts and texts is dismembered and distributed through a number of locations (see addendum below), and he does not appear to be holding any office.

He is still a player in the political/diplomatic arena, anyway, and the British Foreign office has a few files on him compiled, as late as 1928, by observers in the Nagasaki embassy.

Otani's main concerns seem to remain with the future developments of the Japanese policy towards Korea and China. His profile remains extremely low (and open to conjecture) untill his death in 1948, and his involvement with the South Manchuria Railway Co. has not so far been explored.

Addendum: the fate of the Otani Expeditions Loot

The material collected by the three Otani missions was deemed the third largest collection of antiques from Chinese Turkestan, including paintings, statues and texts. Count Otani published a two-volume essay on his collection, including pictures and details on most of the pieces, but today the exact material collected, and the whereabouts of said material are obscure to say the least.

Some stuff (mostly statuary) was exposed in Kyoto Museum in 1910, but no catalogue of the exhibit survives today. When Otani found himself in need of money (having dried his family funds dry financing his expeditions), he donated 249 pieces of his collection to Kyoto Museum, and kept a further 100 pieces for himself (mostly texts, we are led to believe).

The rest of Otani treasure went with his Kyoto villa, and was bought by a former Finance Minister.

The former Minister then gave part of the material to the Japanese Governor-General of Korea, to set up the Seoul Museum. In exchange the former minister got mining rights for Korea. Otani himself gave part of his one hundred pieces to the Japanese Governor-General of Lushun (Port Arthur, Manchuria), for a local exhibit.

Today, the Korean portion of Otani Collection is crated in the basement of Seoul Museum.

The Manchurian portion of the collection, once thought to be in Russia (where the Russian forces took it after handing Port Arthur back to the Chinese in '55) turned out to be in the Chinese Delian Library instead - consisting of 5.500 volumes (Chinese, japanese and European), its filed as a ""gift"" from Count Otani to the Chinese people. This is in all likelyhood the material borrowed for the Lushun exibit.

The Kyoto Museum and the Tokyo National Museum hold much of what Otani donated before selling his house. How much of his collection is still missing is as yet unknown.

I just wanted to mention a few interesting background tidbits, that are not usually known to western viewers, that were left out of the better reviews. First, Japan is rich in mythology of spirits and demons. Many are disguised, or use trickery to manipulate humans. Second, Many Japanese movies end abruptly--without the sense of finality, or resolution seen in western style films. Most American viewers find this irritating. And, third, there IS a vast maze of drainage caverns located under Tokyo to protect the city from flooding. I am sure that many are curious about this subterranean world, because entering is strictly forbidden!! What will happen to the protagonist when he starts breaking the rules?

2487173,4,B000E3LGMY,"""Marebito"" was a very spontaneous buy for me. I saw it in on the shelves of HMV. The back read promising. It was directed by Takashi Shimizu (""Ju-on: The Grudge""). That was enough.

It starts slowly and builds. It's like a rollercoaster gradually climbing up the tracks. Clicking-and-clacking, and as it gets higher the hysteria heightens. By the time the rollercoaster is at its peak, the moment before it plunges down the drop that has your eyes reeling and your breath sucked away, you're scared but at the same time ecstatic.

This movie is beautiful but not in the classical sense. In fact what's happening throughout is repulsive but I couldn't resist but to find it endearing. You care about the characters. You want Masuoka to find what he's after--but you want him to be happy, though that's not what he wants. You want to discover `T', you want to care for her like Masuoka does and you want her to be healthy. A mainstream movie-goer or a fan of casual horror will not like this movie. In fact, they'll probably hate it. They'll call it boring and tedious and convoluted, but all of that is just superficial. You must commit yourself to ""Marebito"". You must let ""Marebito"" take your hand, let it captivate you; let it lead you into the world of the insane.

""Marebito""'s atmosphere is one of morbid, somber unpredictability. The first time I tried to watch it I simply couldn't because the darkness (both literal and figurative) was too off-putting for me. I found you had to be in a certain mindset in order for ""Marebito"" to really lull you. It's not a movie of light-heartedness or comfort--it's a Lovecraftian-inspired piece so anyone familiar with HP Lovecraft's writing should find all the weird and wonderful things in his stories prominent in this.

I won't go any further because I believe ""Marebito"" is one of those movies that packs a bigger punch the less about it you know. This is definitely not a movie for everybody. Like I said above mainstream or casual horror fans beware. You're liable to detest this movie. People freshly introduced to Asian horror should start with something simpler--this isn't a movie to ease you into the genre.

""Marebito"" is a rare, underrated gem and if you don't fall into any of the categories cited above than I recommend it. Otherwise, stay away.

2487174,2,B000E3LGMY,"The film was a disappointment to me.  Most of the Tartan previews / commercials did a great job of making this movie look a lot more interesting than it actually was.  It was short on intrigue for my taste.  I also figured out all of the plot twists early in the film (and I'm typically dim in that regard).

The level of surreality in some of the scenes (especially the discovery scene in the sandstone cavern) was refreshing, but those occasional vignettes of oddity were not enough to keep me interested for the whole thing.  I promptly sold my copy to the 2nd hand store after viewing.

It hinted at things but left a lot of definite answers to the thoughts of the viewer.

And things about the occult, vampirism, different beings living in dimensions next to ours that we cannot detect but by the tidbit of one energy frequency can exist in our dimension. (I also liked From Beyond .. its classic)

The protagonist of this movie was seeking knowledge of fear as per his own words. However when he found the girl, it seemed he started learning more than he wanted. And for a while he had somewhat given up, but curiosity and the possibility of knowledge and experience piqued his interest again. And even at the end, the movie did not really present a solid resolution, just more possibilities and theoris to provoke wonderment.

I like this movie and similar themes because they represent in analogy my own true life quest. To find what is beyond the limitations of humanity and maybe experience it.
Because if living around humans and humans only is the only path until death, whats the point in living?

Awesome film. For me something I can watch over and over.",1236643200,,1159,4.699507389162561
2487176,5,B000E3LGMY,"Marebito (Stranger from Afar)
Takashi Shimizu - Japan, 2004

A reviewer of our 2007 ""Shaver Revival"" sci-fi movie Beyond Lemuria said that we should have a place in the history of science fiction films as the first Shaver Mystery movie. As much as I appreciate that recommendation, the credit must go to Takashi Shimizu (Grudge 1&2) and his team for their moody, introspective 2004 horror film Marebito.
This film avoids the sudden shocks of the Grudge films (amplified by loud
musical ""stings""). Marebito creates a subtle mood of brooding terror and mystery which progresses downward into the gloomy underworld beneath modern Tokyo while descending deeper in the subjective torment of the protagonist's developing psychosis.
 Tokyo, like most modern cities, has a multi-level subterranean network of subways and utility tunnels that connect to earlier abandoned and forgotten excavations at deeper levels. The tormented video-journalist Masuoka witnesses a grisly suicide in the subway. Driven by a compulsion to discover the unknown terror that caused the man to kill himself, Masuoka explores this gloomy netherworld, going deeper and deeper until he reaches a dark passage between the worlds where he meets the ghost of the suicide. The ghost gives him a brief explanation of The Shaver Mystery and warns him to beware of the deros.
 Masuoka ignores the warning and enters the Cavern World of the ancients---which this film depicts as vast and mysteriously lighted. We get an impression of a Hollow Earth like Burroughs' Pellucidar. Here Masuoka finds `F' the mute and naked female dero chained in a rocky niche.
 Next we find him with `F' in his Tokyo apartment. She won't talk and she won't eat. She scuttles on all-fours like an animal and has fangs. He discovers that she is a vampire and he must feed her blood: --his, that of live animals, and finally---as his psychosis degenerates into homicidal mania---other people.
 Masuoka flees Tokyo and takes refuge in the countryside where he has a moment of clarity and realizes that he has killed his ex-wife and that `F' is actually his daughter whom he may also have killed---but the other world returns. The ghost of the suicide finally answers Masuoka's question: What was the ultimate terror that caused him to take his life?
 ""Ancient knowledge!""
 --In agreement  with Richard Shaver and H.P. Lovecraft.
 Once again resuming his dark quest, Masuoka returns to Tokyo.
On the way to his apartment he glimpses the deros running on all-fours in the shadows. He realizes that they are in another dimension. At his apartment he collects `F'. He and 'F' then descend into the subways, and the abandoned tunnels beneath. Finally they reach the dark limbo between the worlds where he realizes the ultimate terror as his beloved dero begins to devour him.
 According to Shaver, dero vampires (like wealthy and powerful vampires on the surface) maintain their youth with regular transfusions of baby-blood. We get closer to the truth in Beyond Lemuria but Takashi Shimizu's metaphor is still on the mark---even if `F' didn't have the characteristic dero ""white eyes""--but if `F' was Masuoka's daughter...?

2487177,4,B000E3LGMY,"Japanese Horror has become widely popular in the U.S. after the successes recently achieved by acclaimed hits such as ""Ringu"" and Ju-on, and while these past horror films are classics in their own right; there are quite of few imitations that deaden the premise of long-haired vengeful ghost.  I remember watching a very different type of J-horror in early 2005; ""Marebito"" directed by Takashi Shimizu (Ju-on:The Grudge) is somewhat a ""lovecraftian"" film in a very different way. It is somewhat similar to short ""shock"" stories and has the philosophy and psychology of contemporary Japanese culture. Quite frankly, I'm very surprised with the low rating this film has received in amazon, it is a lot better than most reviewers gave it credit for.

Synopsis partially derived from the back cover:
Masuoka (Shinya Tsukamoto) is a cameraman possessed by the craving to understand fear. In particular, he obsesses over his footage of a grisly suicide in the subway. Returning to the scene to better understand the dead man's reasoning he opens a doorway into a bizarre, cavernous underworld. Here among the ghosts and subterranean creatures, he finds a beautiful, naked, mute young girl whom he takes to his home. As the days past, Masuoka suspects that there something truly inhuman about this girl. When he begins to uncover her terrifying secrets, Masuoka realizes that he has finally found the key in gaining the terrible knowledge he so craves...

Shot in a meager 8 days, with only a few actors with a very limited budget, with very limited special effects, ""Marebito"" achieves a lot by carefully understanding the mood of psychological horror. Alienation, self-pity and loathing, mutation, alien influences, loneliness, the collapse of tradition, perverted sexuality...all these hidden themes and motifs are observed in subtle fashion by this film. The film creates a bitter and unique moody feel to its main premise of very creepy obsession and inevitable descent into madness and eventual doom. The director's unique style in delivering the audience into the delves of Masuoka's unhinged consciousness through the camera's perspective adds a lot of gritty and disturbing ""feeling"" of being immersed into a psychotic mind. I commend the director in avoiding some overused special effects, because truly, the basic psychotic mind is such a terrifying thing to be privy to.

Shinya Tsukamoto is the right choice to play an alienated, solitary obsessive man. The man is an awesome director as well as a director. He played the antagonist on the recent hit ""Nightmare Detective"" as well as in the cult hit; ""Haze"" and is the director responsible for the TETSUO franchise. He plays his character with almost effortless fashion, he truly shines in playing a man detached from mundane reality and society, completely focused on finding the darkest, sinister truths in the nethermost places of human experience. The nude girl (Tomomi Miyashita) is obviously not normal, perhaps even inhuman, and she remains unnamed, which adds more to its flare of mystery. Disturbing highlights of Masuoka's madness include him feeding the girl blood, and with a twisted touch, from a baby bottle! Don't worry, this is NOT another vampire film. Masuoka has his own agenda why he took this nude girl to his apartment, and the reason is a bit subtle that some reviewers missed it. Masuoka lost his daughter in the past and now he awaits the final horror that this nude girl may be the avatar to his desire for self-destruction. There is also some use of subtle symbolism that represents Masuoka's commitment to his cause, the masochistic desire to feel and understand the darkest ultimate reality. The only way is down...into the abyss.

MAREBITO is at its strongest with its very subtle suggestive themes and teases. The film may get a bit slower-paced in the middle and gets a little hampered with promises unfulfilled. But with its backdrop of a very peculiar mind, that may have been imagined than as a reality; ""Marebito"" may disappoint those looking for explanations and details, but for me, the film is not a film about set-pieces, nor is it a film full of scary aliens and landscapes. ""Marebito"" delves into the psychological aspect, maybe blood represents something else and viewers may have to take multiple-viewings to understand the complexity of its plot and hidden details. It is more a mood piece about an obsessed individual on a downward spiral towards insanity and eventual destruction. The film is definitely cryptic in its delivery and maybe geared to an ESOTERIC few very initiated to this style of psychological horror. Dark, moody and cryptic, ""Marebito"" may not be a plot-based affair, but for some strange reason, I really enjoyed this offering by Takashi Shimizu. It is a welcome departure from the typical J-horror that has flooded the U.S. lately. It is an experience unlike any other, which is so effective with existential dread and mind-bending claustrophobia.

The unknown definitely arouses my interest....

Highly Recommended! To those who love mind-bending horror. [4 Stars]

2487178,4,B000E3LGMY,"Marebito comes from Takashi Shimizu, director of The Ju-On and The Grudge movies.  It is about a camera man, Masuoka that is obsessed with fear.  On the way home from an assignment he videotapes a man committing suicide by shoving a knife in his eye.  Upon returning to the scene of the suicide he finds a door to an underground world full of tunnels that seem to span Tokyo.  While in the tunnels he finds a completely naked girl chained to a rock and decides to rescue her and bring her back to his apartment.  His attempts to nurse her back to health and communicate with her do not seem to work.  Masuoka refers to her as F.  While Masuoka is slowly slipping into insanity, he accidently discovers what it is that F needs to survive.

Marebito was made on a small budget, so the effects are not that great.  I found it to be a great psychological horror movie, and enjoyed it better than the Ju-On series.  It can be a little slow at times, and not everything is handed to the audience like many of today's horror films, so some imagination helps quite a bit.  If you are looking for something a little different, or are a fan of J-Horror, this is worth checking out.

Shinya Tsukamoto, the actor that played Masuoka, is also a director.  He directed Tetsuo: The Iron Man, which I also reviewed.",1201219200,,1299,4.407563025210084
2487179,3,B000E3LGMY,"Marebito (Takashi Shimizu, 2004)

I'm not a big fan of Takashi Shimizu's stuff; The Grudge, in both its American and Asian forms, always struck me as silly and unnecessary, not treading any new ground, nor doing anything to make the old ground fresh. When I found out that Shinya Tsukamoto has starred in a Shimizu film, however, I decided to give him another chance. While Marebito (literally, ""strange beings"", though the title is translated here as The Stranger from Afar) never quite comes together as a coherent flick, it's still miles better than the Grudge films, in no small part because Tsukamoto, a gifted filmmaker in his own right (Tetsuo: The Iron Man, A Snake of June), is so completely absorbed in his role.

Not that that's hard; Tsukamoto plays a filmmaker, Masuoka, a freelance stringer for a TV studio. He comes upon a story of spirits that haunt the subways of Tokyo and, in a sequence that can only be described as a severely understated acid trip, he finds out that there is, in fact, an entire other world down there. (And we're not talking In Search of the Mole People here, though the movie pays homage to Viktor David's documentary more than once.) He comes back from that world bearing F (Samurai Chicks' Tomomi Miyashita), one of its denizens... or does he? How much of what's going on is just in Masuoka's mind, how much is real, and who's the guy who keeps calling him?

Shimizu shot Marebito in just eight days between filming the second Grudge flick in Japan and hopping a plane to America to film the even worse remake of the first movie. Interestingly, the incredibly tight shooting schedule for this flick probably worked both for and against it. For because Shimizu didn't have much of a chance to muck around with it, so what we're getting is, most likely, as close to Chiaki Konaka's adaptation of his own novel as we were ever likely to get; against because a few extra days in the editing room might have helped garner some coherence for the second half of the movie, once we really get into the question of how much of this story is rooted in Masuoka's fantasies and how much is really going on. It's possible to put it all together with some reflection after the film, but it seems less a case of planned ambiguity than simple sloppiness, which greatly detracts from atmosphere and enjoyment.

An interesting picture of what could have been, but wasn't. Intriguing, but not good enough to wholeheartedly recommend, despite the all-too-rare presence of Shinya Tsukamoto in front of the camera. ** ",1193875200,,2538,4.720090293453724

2487181,3,B000E3LGMY,"Director Takashi Shimizu took a short break from his endless re-filming of ""Ju-on"", between his last Japanese version and directing the new American version called ""The Grudge"".  In order to refresh his mind from his crowd-pleasing formula, he went with something entirely different, the kind of random and brave experimental film that won him ""Ju-on"" in the first place. What he came up with was ""Marebito"".

Shot in just eight days, and filmed with a mix of film and hand-held video, ""Marebito"" might just be a little too experimental for most people.  Shimizu took the theories of Richard Shaver as his starting point. Shaver, a 1930s madman/prophet who believed he had been given the power to read minds from a welding gun, wrote books about a secret race of underground dwellers that he named ""deros"", or detrimental robots, who were a degenerate sub-species living in a hollow Earth. Very few people remember the ""Shaver Mystery"" nowadays, so this reference gets unfortunately lost, and is a bit confusing.

The story, on the other hand, is quite simple.  Masuoka, a camera-obsessed social misfit, become obsessed with the idea of experiencing true terror after watching a suicide on TV. In his quest for fear, he enters the underground sewers, where he encounters a dero-girl naked and chained to a wall.  He frees her, names her ""F"" and takes her home as his new pet.  Not a wise idea. From there, Masuoka's descent begins, along with the audience's as director Shimizu asks us to question what is real and what is not, what is sane and what is insanity.

All in all, ""Marebito"" is only a decent film.  Shimizu's attempt to break out of his formula is respectable, if not successful.  There is more psychology here than any genuine chills, and his reliance on the obscure Shaver Mystery is guaranteed to lose many viewers who are not familiar.  It is short enough, at only 90 minutes, that it doesn't drag on too long, and it is a refreshing change from the usual j-horror.",1180569600,6,1981,4.814159292035399
2487182,3,B000E3LGMY,"Foremost, you may know the director of this film, Takashi Shimizu, from his work with ""Ju-On: The Grudge"" and ""Ju-On 2.""  Both films employ the concept of the uncanny with shivering exactitude. Marebito is a bit different.

Film premise: Wanting to experience genuine terror, Masuoka tosses his Prozac in the garbage (literally) and descends into the bowels of the Tokyo subway system. In this dim emptiness, he encounters an apparition who guides him to the underworld. (And reveals the terrors of ""detrimental robots"" which rob a person of blood). In the CGI-esque realm, he finds a beautiful, nude woman chained in a cave. He ""rescues"" her ... toting her back to his apartment. Without spoilers, what follows is ""How To Feed A Vampire 101."" (Including ridiculously adorable baby-bottles!)

Thankfully, more resides beneath the surface. An encounter with Masuoka's wife begins to reveal the truth. And that Masuoka calls his new, monstrous ""pet"" ""F"" actually begins to make sense ... another name seems to begin with ""F"";) (You'll understand after viewing the film.)

Still, most of the film is exposition, which is frustrating. (Takashi Miike does this well in ""Audition,"" so we know that exposition-heavy films can work ... when there is a huge ""pay-off"" in the end). Moreover, there is precious little dialogue: most of the story is first-person voice-over. This can become a somewhat isolating (and I am quite certain that this sense of isolation echoes Masuoka's own loneliness ... I ""get"" that ... but I'm just not certain it is entirely effective here).

The film is worth a rent if you are a J-Horror fan. But, if this is your first attempt at the genre, try a more ""viewer-friendly"" film (check the many Listmania's here at Amazon) and then return to this one once you have a ""feel"" for them.

the directing was so-so, at times it created some really captivating scenes, while other times it felt like they were being dragged on. i personally felt it ironic that Shimizu had cast Shinya Tsukamoto in the lead role, as this film seemed to reflect much of the fellow director's trademark subject matter(ex:protagonist succumbing to the pressures of city life, as well as obsession) aside from a few scenes few minutes too long, the imagery is wonderful; disturbing yet very captivating, much like the film itself altogether.

2487195,5,B000E3LGMY,"This is a very cool and weird movie. Everybody has already written what this movie is about so I won't explain its plot. Instead, im going to contribute my interpretation of it.

SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!! READ THIS ONLY WHEN YOU FINISHED WATCHING THIS MOVIE. Im going to explain this in parts, so read along......

Ok, this cameraman is a lonely individual that wants to experience fear, absolute terror, but cant do it by the ""normal means"", so he seeks terror in uncommon places, like suicide attempts and filming people. He uses Prozac to help his medical condition, and when he throws it in the garbage at the beginning of the movie, he starts seeing and hearing things that are not there, like the conversation in the underground with the suicidal man ghost, or the Deros. Also, this is why he doesn't remember his ex wife.

Everything the camera films is real, because film cant lie, so I assume that the underground is real, as we can see this underground filmed. Also, the vampire girl is real, because she is filmed also, fangs an all. At the end of the movie, you can see that the cameras are still filming his descent into the underground, so this weird world of downstairs is real also. The ghosts or the Deros are not filmed, so they are only in the insane mind of the protagonist. There's a line in the movie where he says that everything is more real when he films it, and also we only see the faces of other people he is looking at correctly through his camera lenses, because they are real to him only through the camera lenses. All this supports this theory too. He even says when he sees this weird snuff film at the beginning of the film, that he will become a psychopath to really experience terror. This explains his later killings.

This person and his ex wife had a children, information that is not in the movie, and this child maybe was killed or got lost, and this led this couple to their respective insanities and separation. This is not explained at all, but it helps understand the plot, so play along. The cameraman doesn't recognize his ex wife until he already killed her, and in his little moments of lucidity we see that he understands the situation that he is in, and that he is becoming a bad person everyday, but stills doesn't experience absolute terror. Also, we see that he is not satisfied with the terror showing on the face of his victims when he kills them, so he thinks that what he needs is something else to really get where he wants.

At the same time, he meets this ""Vampire Girl"", who is very real, and he mistakes her for his lost daughter. That's why he gets her things, food and takes care of her. He sees her as a redemption option, but the kid is out of this world, and will only lead him to his death. He even gets her animal and human blood to drink, ignoring the weirdness of this situation, thinking that is normal. The kid even got lost, when the lunatic mother, his ex wife, enters his apartment and makes a mess looking for her missing daughter. That's why everything is messy and that's why she knows that he has somebody living in his apartment. But she returns, to still live with his protector.

At the end of the movie, we see in him another moment of lucidity, where the cameraman says that he has tried everything to get terrified, killings and all, but nothing helped him, so he will reorganize his life, and forgets about the creature. But his insane mind is still at work, and he starts hallucinating again, seeing Deros in the city urging him to return to his apartment. So, he returns to his vampire child, who is dying of starvation. In this crucial moment, he rips open his tongue, therefore condemning himself to death by heart failure due to blood loss, to give her life, the life that he doesn't want anymore because he doesn't have anything to live for, and takes the creature back to where he found it so it can live underground.

And that's when it hits him right in the face, the terror he seeked desperately all along is there at last, because at this very moment he sees that this creature is otherworldly and is not his missing child but a demon monster, and so he now realizes that everything that he did was to feed a demon child, and the mere presence of being looking at this demon, who is not his little kid anymore but a monster, scares him to death, a death that also is real because he is now at the other side of the camera, and this made it more real than ever.

Who was this kid??? Well, there's a theory in the asian mythology that there are deities called Marebitos, that come to our world every now and then to heal things, so maybe this kid came to Masuokas life to heal his longing for his child, and ended being the terror he seeked during the movie.

He frees her, takes her home, and keeps her like a pet. It seems to be working out all right, until he finds that the girl has a strong preference for drinking human blood.

It's a creepy but sometimes sensuous little movie. I liked it mainly because it doesn't try to overplay anything; it sets an effective tone and sticks to it, and never really shows its hand fully.

2487202,5,B000E3LGMY,"But what the hell kind of species is it, anyway?

Let's boil ""Marebito"" down: it's either,

1)A sordid, turgid, dingy chronicle of a man's descent into loneliness, fear, madness, and the foulest abomination; or,

2) It's like this: ready? Imagine you toil uneasily, for a pittance, for a meager wage that keeps you in Ramen noodles and rental payments, and you live in some dirty, foul-smelling little dirtwater dungeon off a freeway somewhere.

And you're obsessed.

You're obsessed with the notion, the idea, the fancy---that there might be vast subterranean caves and dungeons and abbatoirs and oubliettes stretching out for Stygian MILES beneath your humble abode. And in all those curving, twisting, writhing dark tunnels, and holes, and sawtooth death traps, down below the festering, breathing, hulking, sweating, teeming, whoring City---there might be Something.

Something, you know, that can teach you tricks about your deepest Obsession: Fear.

So let's be generous: let's give failed Tokyo cameraman Masuoko (the sublime, dingy, scruffily bearded Shinya Tsukamoto) his due, and say it's all about the Caverns, the vast, inky depths, that lurk, coiled, beneath his sad little studio apartment. Fine? Yes?

Good. Anyway, our Man Masuoko is totally impelled by his conviction that he should, at the very least, see the source of the mind-blasting fear that impelled a subway transient to stick a knife into his eye-socket. The whole idea here: what did he see? Can I see it? Will I stick a pen-knife deep into my eyeball? Do I have wayyyyyyy too much time on my hands?

So our hero stakes out the subway, figures the best possible entry point to the Horror, and penetrates the vast global abyss-spanning cavern-network into the Stygian recesses that lurk beneath all of the cities of Earth.

Seriously.

Takashi Shimizu (who helmed up The Grudge), pretty much tears open a portal to the Nightworld with ""Marebito"", plunges you in, turns out the lights, and leaves you without a guide. To either burrow deeper, or fumble around for the exit.

Our Man burrows deeper, finds something curvy, and bound with shackles, and exiled to a forlorn cave, and fleshy, soft, helpless.

Naturally, our Photographer sets her free, and leads her up into the sun-drenched haunts of Tokyo.

And watches her, with the help of all his hidden cameras. Intently. Obsessively. Did I mention she's naked, and writhes around on the floor, and skulks beneath the bed, and stays away from bright lights, and has razor-sharp teeth, this precious little feminine find that Masuoka finds on the far periphery of what he calls the ""Mountains of Madness"", the far stomping grounds of Shaky Reason?

She has razor-sharp teeth. For, you know, rending flesh.

And she's up to all sorts of nasty things, all captured, in high definition, by the unblinking, unflinching eye of the camera.

Anyway, Fear starts crawling all over the place: Fear gets hungry, lusts for blood, lusts entirely out of an appetite that our boy Masuoka has no clue how to control.

And then there are the fabled, fearful DETROS---the ""Detrimental Robots"", who police the Tokyo Underworld, though they're far less like any Robots I've ever seen and far more like some kind of inhuman toad, lurking in that phantom expanse between the passage of the second hand and the waking minute.

""Marebito"" is a chilly, helping serving of frozen Grue, and Despair, and Obession, all the worse because the brazen, harrowing, Underworld Journey may be nothing more than than the figment of a diseased mind in the terminal throes of a murderous insanity.

That said: the Girl, the Fear, that you brought up from the Caverns---she has razor-sharp teeth. And she skulks around in the shadows. Don't you want---don't you have---to watch? To see? To record?

To join?

2487206,4,B000E3LGMY,"In the middle of making all of those ""Ju-On"" movies, director Takashi Shimizu comes up with something different than a haunted house movie.  In fact, ""Marebito"" (""The Stranger From Afar""), was shot in eight days between ""Ju-On"" and its American remake.  Masuoka (Shinya Tsukamoto, director of the ""Tetsuo"" films) is an amateur videographer who becomes a student of the nature of fear.  While shooting in the subways beneath Tokyo he captures the suicide of an old man.  Masuoka becomes convinced the man did it out of fear and wonders what it was that he saw that drove him to do what he did, finally deciding: ""They didn't see something that terrified them. They saw something because they were terrified.""  Masuoka decides he wants to experience such fear, and begins exploring the Tokyo underground to find was it was the old man saw.

Masuoka, a freelance cameraman obsessed with trying to understand the nature of fear, accidentally captures footage of a man committing suicide in the Tokyo subway. Intrigued by the event, Masuoka returns to the scene, where he finds a passage into the underworld, called the Mountains of Madness (a reference to H.P. Lovecraft?). Exploring the subterranean tunnels and caves of the netherworld, he finds a naked girl (Tomomi Miyashita) chained up in an alcove. Masuoka rescues her and brings her back home to his small apartment.  Calling her F, he discovers she is not quite human.  F crawls around on all fours and does not speak, or eat or drink, until he learns the blood is mother's milk to her and Masuoka becomes determined to supply it for her.  Then a mysterious Man in Black (Shun Sugata), begins following Masuoka and calling his cell phone, as the mysterious things start piling up faster and deeper.

Shimizu uses a lot of handheld digi-cams to represent Masuoka's view of the underground world through his videocamera (I am starting to notice that technology is not considered a good thing in these Japanese horror films).  ""Marebito"" is not a film with shocks and scares, as much as one that leads to its horror through psychological dimensions as Masuoka willingly descends into hell.  Since this is largely a personal journey, there is relatively little dialogue, with the film relaying on voiceovers by Masuoka to let us know what the character is thinking each step of the way.  What Masuoka says becomes a bit ponderous at times, but I do not know if that is because of Chiaki Konaka's screenplay, based on his novel, or whoever did the translation.

""Marebito"" comes with one big warning and that is that you have to watch it (at least) twice to come to terms with it.  This is not because Shimizu is telling a confusing story, but more because our expectations, both in terms of the culture and the genre, lead us off track.  The end ing is not as abrupt as it seems, but I can understand if viewers do not want to work hard to figure out the ending of a Japanese horror film.  But on balance, I think ""Marebito"" is worth the effort.  At least it is something different from Shimizu.",1147651200,4,3045,4.756653992395437
2487207,3,B000E3LGMY,"So I'm sure everyone knows that 'Ju-on' is one of my favorite movies. So when I heard that director Takashi Shimizu was coming out with something different, I was skeptical at first. Luckily for me my father-in-law had a copy and he loaned it to me. Anywho, onto my review. From the writer and director of Ju-on, Takashi Shimizu presents to us Marebito. Marebito tells the story of a news cameraman named Masuoka. Masuoka had just recently filmed a man killing himself in the subway station and that experience has left him wondering, what is fear? He then soon discovers ghosts living in homes and he learns about a place below the subway, a place that is like the underworld. He finds his way there and finds a girl naked and chained to a wall and he takes her back with him to the surface determined to teach her to act like a human. The only person who ends up changing is him.

I was interested to hear that Takashii Shimizu was doing another movie; at first I wasn't too interested in seeing it. But when the release date came it wasn't playing at my theater. So I had to wait to see it on DVD. I thought the movie was pretty cool. It did make you really wonder, was Masuoka actually crazy and was he making everything up? Or was everything actually happening? So that did confuse you a bit. Especially when they tell you one thing, then change it. I enjoyed watching this movie very much, it started off like a ghost story but then turned into more of a psychological horror. I will admit this movie wasn't very exciting and that's what I did kind of expect, but it was still good to watch. I did like Shinya Tsukamoto acting in it and he in fact has been in several other, I guess you can say cult movies. Ichi the killer and Tetsuo the Iron man to name a couple.

The movie reminded me a bit of a Kiyoshi Kurosawa picture in terms of lack of music and subtlety, but it did not have the same effect. The movie is actually based on a novel of the same name, the writer also wrote the screenplay adaptation. The screenplay was a stand out amongst all things. Psychological and maybe even a bit vampiric, very original especially at a time when remakes and copies of other movies are coming out into our theaters. It is about time everybody went to the foreign section of their video store and see what they can find. If your still unsure maybe this quote can help; ""Horror, is actually an ancient wisdom that we find deep in the memory of our souls.....""",1146268800,6,2460,4.357298474945534
2487208,2,B000E3LGMY,The new movie from the director of The Grudge is even more narratively murky than that film and not as creepy. A cameraman who wanders under Tokyo's subways discovers a naked girl and brings her back to his place where she develops a taste for blood...or is that really what happens. This movie plays with our perception with scrambled video footage and does feature some unsettling and bloody scenes. Unfortunately it's all too mysterious for it's own good and you're left scratching your head in the end. Unique but too weird to be satisfying.,1145750400,2,545,4.808510638297872
2487209,3,B000E3LGMY,"What a great opening concept this film had. It gripped me from the beginning until the point that I finally realized that I wasn't watching what I thought I was watching. I can't really describe what I didn't like about the film without giving away the main plot point (which hits you slowly and gradually and not in a shocking, sudden twist.) Before then it was an extremely entertaining surrealistic film which I thought was breaking some new ground in fantasy story-telling. What a let down at the end. Three stars for the first two thirds of the film.",1145491200,3,555,4.616161616161616
2487210,3,B000E3LGMY,"Using the video camera as it's weapon of choice, Marebito ultimately explores the theme of perception by forcing the viewer to see the world through the eyes of someone who mostly likely has a very different outlook on life than you do.  Our protagonist Masuoka(Shinya Tsukamoto!), is a free lance cameraman who obsessively records everything he sees, searching for what his eyes miss.  But of all Masuoka's recordings, it's a strange suicide in a subway that fascinates him the most.  Before stabbing out his own eye, the man apparently experiences fear beyond mortal experience and appears to see something no one else can see. Masuoka concludes that it was this seemingly unreachable fear the man experienced that caused the ""enlightened"" vision and after withdrawing from his Prozac he sets out beneath Tokyo's subway system to find this fear for himself.

Here, he enters a world where the stories of Weird Fiction are more than fiction and at the depths of the hollow earth discovers he a beautiful mute girl he names ""F.""  It seems she was a human raised by the Deros of Richard Shaver's stories and has acquired their taste for blood as a result.  Masuoka tries to domesticate the frail and helpless ""F"" but it's not long before he indulges her blood lust, her complete and utter dependency in turn giving him a reason to live.  But when this demented sci-fi/horror  fantasy falls apart and the camera is turned on Masuoka he finds the horror he's been trying so hard to experience is the reality he's been avoiding.

 Marebito can be a difficult film in more ways than one. Major plot revelations are never really  unveiled, instead it's up to the viewer to find the clues and piece together the film themselves.  While there's nothing wrong with this approach, many of the clues are often too vague and yes, there are many loose ends as well.  Coming from more of a traditional horror background, director Shimizu struggles when it comes to visually presenting the more meta-physical and metaphoric horror of the story.  A lack of atmosphere is also evident, which is key to a movie that depends so much on visuals.  One can't help but wander what somebody like Cronenberg, Miike, or even Shinya himself would have done with the script.  Also watch out for the painful low budget and horrible overreaching special effects. Even the Deros are a disappointment, often causing more laughs than screams. There's some forced subtle spooks(""Don't forgot I directed Ju-On!"") as well and lot's of flat out silliness that at times kills the tone of the movie.

 However the murders and scenes of blood lust are true stand outs for the film.  The blood sucking is  incredibly sexual and suggestive yet far more repulsive and disturbing than erotic and sensual.  The acting is impressive as well with Shinya turning in a low key but not completely detached performance.  It's not a likable performance but he is at times very engaging, though sometimes sadly a little too ambiguous. ""F"" is flat out surreal, with her unnatural movements and haunting looks of vulnerability.  Overall, the movie hits a lot more than it misses. But viewer beware: there are no real scares despite promising builds, cheesy effects and some silliness, loose ends, and an intentionally open ended plot that revolves around an interesting but unlikable main character. But most of all, the movie's best asset is the fact that it's simply interesting and different.",1144540800,2,3440,4.913494809688581
2487211,2,B000E3LGMY,"I like Takeshi, which is why I was excited to see a new movie from him. But um..what was this? This was no Ju-on! Was this a movie he did years ago and they brough it out to America hoping to make some money? Actually, that sounds plausible, I'll buy that. If you love Asian horror, or are just getting into it, don't buy this movie. It is NOT scary, it's barely even creepy. The plot is non existant, loose ends are everywhere, and yes, the hand-held camera shots got old, very quickly. Blair Witch is was not. I give it 2 stars because it started off well and had some nice cinematography. As I stated in the title, maybe I just missed something because I don't have an Asian background, maybe the Japanese think it's scary.",1144022400,,726,4.306569343065694
2487212,2,B000E3LGMY,"this film captured my attention in the beginning, seeming to have a plot line and allow the audience to follow along.  i was very intrigued by the protagonist's motives to search for fear by being fearless.  there was a disonence that captured my attention greatly.  then it took a plunge into the netherworlds where a mass of unanswered questions and literary references confused me to a point where i could no longer follow along or relate in any way to the protagonist or the obsure events surrounding him.

the only way you can relate to the protagonist is in his intention for being terrified as if to wake him up from the insanity of a peaceful, apathetic lifestyle.  that is completely obliterated when he captures a blood sucking girl and breeds a fetish of self-mutilation in an attempt to keep her alive.

okay, maybe i'm still keeping up with him.  maybe i can't follow his intentions within his world and find it worth watching in some way, but then the director coaxes the audience into believing the whole movie is a dream, but leaves no indication that this is true in any way, other than the protagonist's random living scenarios and encounters with some creepy guy in a trenchcoat (and the question as to where that guy came from was never answered either).

bottom line: the story is horrible unless you enjoy watching an old guy stare at video screens for half the movie and then for the other half, watch a chained up naked lady suck blood from a his tongue, cause that's the whole film.  sorry i spoiled it for you.

as with cinematrography, no attention was paid to the lighting.  i would consider it a motif if it were consistent and had some correlation to the story, but for the most part, most of the shots were either muddy and under exposed or way too overexposed and blurry.  the hand-held camera didn't make it very easy to watch either.  and all of the shots were in a really high contrast.  i would have assumed it were because of a bleach bypass, but then i figured the director had filmed this whole thing digitally.  oh yeah, and half the movie is just pitch black with eerie noises in the background.  it felt like water torture, or watching a really long indie student film.

i really thought i would enjoy this film because the first fifteen minutes were intriguing, but then it went awol and tried to shove so much information into such a short film that the direction and intention for filming all this in the first place was completely lost.  i'm sorry, but don't waste your money unless you intend on making a few drinking games out of it.",1143504000,,2581,4.54978354978355
8105477,3,B000E3LGMY,"Starring Shin'ya Tsukamoto in the lead role, Marebito is a strange, and foreboding horror film that feels like it was in fact directed by him. With clinical voiceovers and both handheld and static camera work, the story unfolds at an eerie, slow pace. Something of a character study, Marebito isn't interested in jumpscares or gore. Instead it goes to great lengths to make the viewer feel unease. Definitely watch this while you're in a healthy mindset as this film delves into the main character's mental illness in a powerful way without relenting. Interestingly, while the script is based on a Japanese novel, it would seem the novel is based on an established American mythos as published in Amazing Stories in the 40's. These original stories were written by Richard Shaver who claimed his stories to be based on fact as communicated by his welding-gun! He also claimed he was captured and imprisoned for some years by the subterranean, sub-human Deros!

This DVD release features a respectable, anamorphic transfer that does it's best with the film sources involved in filming. Tartan Asia Extreme did a good job including interviews with the director, lead actor, and producer.",1491436800,2,1185,5.076923076923077

8105480,4,B000E3LGMY,"Marebito is peculiar tale. It's hard for me to figure out who to recommend it to. It doesn't have the same driving force as the Grudge or the Ring. It's a quieter, more foreboding, type of horror movie. The precipice never becomes fulfilled and the viewer is promised more than he is delivered. Still, that's not to say the movie itself isn't good, on the contrary. Despite been somewhat odd, though pretty tame by some of the more bizarre things out of Japan, the movie brings a somewhat unique experience and despite not been the nightmare enduing success the original Grudge was it's definitely worth a watch. For all it's drawbacks there is still enough here to give it a solid 4/5.",1458172800,3,686,4.631147540983607

But it is actually about an already unhinged cameraman, who seeks ""terror"", and goes off his meds to try to find it. The girl is implied to be his daughter. I absolutely love Japanese horror films.
