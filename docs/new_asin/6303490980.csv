671949,4,6303490980,"I first saw this movie back in 1983.  I found myself crying and needing to see it again.  After viewing it several times I realized the changes I needed to make in my own life.  Now in 1999 I face the need for change, and  pull ""The Earthling"" off the shelf for a refresher course.",920073600,4,281,4.054545454545455

For anyone interested in purchasing the theme song ""Halfway Home"", sung by Maureen McGovern, it's available on the ""David Shire at the Movies"" DVD, 13th cut.

672274,5,6303490980,"Got  this  on  VHS  a  few  years  ago.  The  bad  side  of  this  is  the  tracking  is  a  little  off.  &  I  have  tried  to  adjust  it  to  get  a  non  fuzzy  picture,  but  it  doesn't  work.
This  is  the  very  first  movie  I  saw  Rick Schroder  in.
Patrick Foley  (William Holden)  has  returned  to  the  land  where  he  grew  up,  &  prefers  to  die  due  to  a  cancer  he  feels  he  can't  beat.  &  wants  his  privacy.
Shawn Daily  starts  out  being  with  his  family  who  has  just  arrived  in  Australia  &  has  rented  a  Winnebago  to  do  some  exploring.
Shawn  has  no  idea  what  awaits  him  &  what's  about  to  happen.  He's  young  &  mischievous,  doing  everything  a  boy  does  including  not  knowing  how  to  keep  himself  out  of  trouble.
Patrick  turns  down  advice  when  a  friend  offers  to  take  care  of  him  &  nourish  him  back  to  health.  &  decides  to  stop  taking  his  medication.
Shawn  &  his  family  are  getting  further  &  further  away  from  civilization  seeing  the  country  &  camping.  &  soon  Shawn's  Dad  ends  up  in  a  major  position  when  he  parks  too  close  to  the  edge  of  a  cliff,  &  tries  getting  back  on  leveled  ground.
&  because  the  wheels  are  spinning  &  getting  no  traction  the  Winnebago  goes  over  the  cliff  killing  Shawn's  parents.  Several  nights  before  meeting  Patrick  Shawn  gets  bewildered  &  scared.  &  realizing  he  needs  help  decides  to  pair  up  &  tag  along  with  Patrick,  who  not  only  teaches  him  something  about  nature  during  their  Journey  but  also  teaches  Shawn  courage,  on  &  off  Shawn  wakes  up  &  finds  out  that  Patrick  has  gone  on  ahead,  to  make  Shawn  realize  Patrick  can't  help  him  out  forever.  &  Shawn  must  learn  the  most  important  thing  that  will  get  him  back  to  civilization,  he  first  overcomes  the  fact  that  he  must  put  aside  his  feelings  over  the  death  of  his  parents  &  not  give  up  in  order  to  survive.
&  for  the  record  some  old  people  can  be  cranky.  I  would  surely  assume  that  where  Patrick  Foley  died  there  at  his  old  abandoned  home  at  his  fathers  farm,  was  at  least  100  miles  or  so  from  where  he  turned  down  his  friend  Christian  who  had  tried  to  reason  with  him.
Yes  Foley  lost  his  temper  plenty  of  times.  He  was  dead  right  even  when  he  was  hollering.
You  take  for  instance  Him  saying  (You  couldn't  stalk  a  butterfly)  (Your  on  your  own)  (Telling  him  his  parents  were  in  his  heart)
The  wild  dogs  who  were  chasing  Shawn  because  they  were  interested  in  the  rabbit  he  was  carrying,  I  would  have  to  doubt  those  kind  of  dogs  are  common  in  Australia.  Blue  healers,  the  kind  we  keep  as  pets.
The  movie  is  sad  But  it  has  something  to  benefit  from  &  learn  something.  Holden  points  out  a  lot  of  things  throughout  the  movie.  Good  advice,  good  suggestions.  &  Rick  Schroeder  honored  Holden  after  starring  in  this  movie,  these  things  make  a  difference.  &  He  names  one  of  his  sons  Holden.
He  adapts,  overcomes  his  nervousness  &  learns  to  be  brave  &  confident.
Still  once  he  gets  out  of  the  wilderness  &  finds  someone.  What  next?  He'll  have  to  get  back  to  America.
Then  I  guess  somebody  would  have  to  adopt  him.  When  most  movies  end  it  only  leaves  us  guessing  as  to  what  might  have  happened  afterwards.
I  would  have  to  say  most  movies  do  end  without  a  meaning  because  we  don't  always  get  to  see  what  we  want  to  see.
Seeing  Shawn  get  back  to  civilization  would  have  really  completed  the  film.",1501891200,,3791,4.346089850249584
672275,5,6303490980,"I had a VHS copy that failed; it is an exceptional opportunity to have a DVD version, although not the best copy; it was difficult to view due to clarity in some episodes.  For my collection this is historic because it was one of the last if not the last movie in which William Holden was a star before being deceased.  A very young Ricky Schroeder was the boy actor for Shawn Daley.  Some of the outback in New South Wales, Australia is very rugged and ideal for the setting in which a young Son lost his parents in a tragic accident.  Patrick Foley (William Holden) who is terminally ill was going back to live out his last days in a wilderness home of his youth, by happenstance, he encountered Shawn in hysteria.  He mentored the boy and enabled him to survive in the wilderness by teaching him life skills in the wild.  After Shawn found Foley dead, he buried his Mentor and covered his grave with stones.  Shawn left and as Foley instructed him before his death, the boy went down to the river and followed it back to
a town and civilization.  Not only is this an excellent movie about human weaknesses but also a spectacular opportunity to view life in the outback of Australia.  Despite the lack of viewing clarity, nevertheless for the acting worthy of 5 gold stars!",1499126400,,1275,4.461206896551724

We just got around to viewing the movie, having bought it in December, 2016 and unfortunately it's too late to return it for a refund.

This film tells their story as people, with frailties exposed, and it tells the story also of mother Earth, with her frailties exposed. Patrick (William Holden) teaches the viewer how to help the species survive, and help the earth survive, at the same time as teaching ten year old Sean (Ricky Schroder) to survive on his own in the Bush.

673480,5,6303490980,"I think The Earthling (1980) was one of the first movies I watched that I that I found to be a little life altering.

Young Shawn Dailey (Ricky Shroeder) finds himself alone in the out back of Australia after his parents meet a tragic demise. Alone and completely unable to survive on his own, Shawn is cast into a world of complete shock and desolation.

Also in the out back is a man named Patrick Foley (William Holden). Patrick has been diagnosed with terminal cancer and is returning to the place of his birth to die, a place completed secluded from civilization.

Foley is a hard, almost bitter man that has lived a full life. He see's the distress Shawn is in but knows that there is no real way to help as the youngster is half out of his mind. Foley can't take him out of the wilderness as he himself would not survive the trip, there isn't enough time.

Foley just can't abandon the boy so he repeatedly tries to give him instructions on how to navigate his way out of the wilderness, but the ""in shock"" 10 year old doesn't even know his own name. In a moment of triumph for the young Shawn Dailey, he is finally able to recollect his own name and cries it out to Foley who has decided to leave him in the wilderness to die. Foley, a true survivor himself, starts to recognizes Shawn's ability and willingness to fight his way back into a new reality, a reality that no one would want to accept. Foley begins to believe that Shawn may actually have a chance to learn the ways of the wilderness and survive.

The two form a bond that is foreign to both of them, but yet, a bond of complete trust and love. As Shawn learns the ways of the woods, the tables turn and soon young Shawn is the one leaving the food scraps for Foley in a loving ""in your face"" kind of thing. In the end, Foley gives Shawn the final instructions so that he may complete his journey out of the wilderness on his own. Shawn in return, gives Foley the ultimate gift.

In this movie as well, you need to keep your eye on the ""Indian Bag"" and watch the circle of life as it completes its own journey. If you believe that what you give away comes back to you, this validation will put tears in your eyes.

The Earthling is kind of a kids movie and the acting of the parents is atrocious. Fortunately, ma and pa get killed off early on leaving Holden and Schroeder center stage and their acting reputations speak for themselves.

While it is a very uplifting movie, it is interesting to note that the director of the film was dying of cancer in real life while filming was going on and created a very sad film with no redeming qualities. After he died, the actors returned and filmed a new and positive ending for no pay.

In his biography, it says that William Holden and Ricky Schroder had a great relationship and Schroder named one of his sons Holden. It also says that because of this it was the only film in his later years where Holden stayed completly sober.

It has no gun battles, no rap soundtrack, no references to drugs or sexuality or 'relationships'--horrors, this film suggests there might be more important things--& is perhaps 'shockingly lowbrow' by the standards of the sophisticates of New York. I can honestly say this film taught me some things as or more profound & filled with wisdom as anything in the Bible. I really wish this was out on DVD, it ought to be. It is basically a 'family film' that can also make a grown adult think & grow (& perhaps reduce them to tears).

The plot is simple.
The dialogue is sparse.
The countryside is beautiful.
And it renews the soul.
You know you can't do it over.  We live with our mistakes forever.  But you can pass on your knowledge and love to the other.  Even a stranger who only meets you because of adversity and heartbreak.
Even on the way out, down and out, it is still possible to give and to love.  And to forgive.
This is an incredible find.  ...  It was worth it at that price.
It will touch your soul.  It can touch your soul if you will allow that.  You will cry and, perhaps, regret.
But you can see there is always hope of love, even when least expected.

William Holden did some good acting and Rick Schroder was not acknowledged for his part in this movie by the Hollywood Historians, how sad! Loved it!",994636800,5,248,4.904761904761905

Rickie didn't play the silver spoon Daaaaaa in this Movie. Great  performance Mr. Spoon, at last an acting Job..  From 1 to 5, I'd give it a  solid 5.",936057600,2,285,4.109090909090909
7849482,4,6303490980,"If they waited this long to even make this into a DVD, you would think they would take the time to digitally remaster it.  They didn't.  They did give a warning up front that it was based on older copies.  That meant a bit of rolling at the bottom of the picture at times in the latter half and some inconsistent quality.

This was made in 1979 and released in 1980.  In those days, I thought just about all movies were widescreen - especially with all the views of the outback!  However, this move is fullscreen!

There was also NO menu - it just went directly to the movie - just as the older VHS copy did.  This was basically a dub from VHS.

The story is still good.  There's just no beating little Ricky Schroder  when it comes to emotional crying scenes!  He just tears your heart out.",1525910400,,791,4.23489932885906
