549226,5,6303046436,"This is Ray Bradbury's classic science fiction tale of an alien spaceship that accidentally crashes to Earth in the remote California desert. Its completely alien inhabitants ""convince"" a cross-section of the local inhabitants to help them quietly repair their damaged ship, but not without various unforeseen complications that nearly leads to their destruction. Their only goal is to get off our primitive alien world and continue their journey to the stars.

""John, are they really gone?""  ""Yes, for now, the time wasn't right for us to meet. But there will be other nights, other stars for us to watch. They'll be back.""

Universal's first polarized 3D black-and-white feature film is loving restored via digital Blu ray to the way it looked and sounded in theaters more than 60 years ago. The polarized 3D effect is amazing and not overly done like today on so many modern 3D CGI effects films. This alone makes this Blu ray a ""Must Buy"" for any home film library. ""It Came from Outer Space"" has also been restored with its original three-track *stereo* soundtrack, a breakthrough theater sound technology of that film era. A ""flat"" version of the film, in mono sound, is also included, as are both 3D and flat versions of its theatrical movie trailers. Also included is a documentary on Universal's science fiction films of that era and a voice-over commentary that plays over the film on a separate track.",1509408000,14,1412,4.92436974789916

549229,2,6303046436,"Really like the film as an adult (was too talky for a kid) and was looking forward to the blu-ray. It can be watched in normal 2-D, or 3-D if you have that equipment. I just have a TV and blu-ray player. Unfortunately there is only one audio option, and that is for the original 3-D audio. That is, 3 channel, where the 3rd is ""behind"" you. The folks in charge of the restoration failed to appreciate that not every consumer has a home theater with 5 speakers spread around the room. Consequently, you can barely hear the audio which takes place usually off screen, behind you, which is especially noticeable during conversations. The old dvd release audio was also 3-channel but was mixed down which, while not perfect, integrated the back channel enough that it didn't sound too quiet. I cant understand why they didn't add that mix, or even a new mix, as an option for consumers with only stereo setups.",1508544000,3,906,4.564417177914111

549392,5,6303046436,"I originally saw this movie ""It Came from Outer Space"" aka ""Strangers from Outer Space"" on a 14"" black and whit TV as a child. And believe me I was seeing eyes all over the place for several nights.

John Putnam (Richard Carlson of ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" fame) an amateur astronomer was watching the desert sky with his girl, Ellen Fields (Barbara Rush) a local school teacher, when a strange meteor came down near buy. John, first to reach it swore he saw a door shut. We see it and believe him. However no one else does. What will happen next? Watch and find out.

You can spot a Jack Arnold film by the pacing and initial dialog. This one gave me nightmares as a kid. However now when I watch this film now, I can enjoy the DOWN TO EARTH portrayal of misplaced aliens. You get the alien view from its innards. I was disappointed to find that this is not a 3-D film. I also have the children's book of this with still shots. Your next film to view is ""OUT THERE"" (1995) an HBO film staring Bill Campbell and Wendy Schaal. It shows real alien interaction with people and accordions.

There is always hope that a 3D version has survived and will surface in the form of a DVD.",1502323200,2,1185,4.28125

549572,3,6303046436,"This is one of the best science fiction films of the 1950s for it's thoughtful take on a first contact situation that does not ultimately fall prey to the usual bug eyed monster tropes. This one ranks up there with 'This Island Earth' and 'Forbidden Planet' though it is not as widely known as those others (perhaps because it is in black and white?)
That said the transfer of this film is near appalling. There is far to much graininess and noise in the transfer. There are times where the background shimmers almost like old tv static - i wouldn't be surprised if they simply used the DVD transfer for this.",1501459200,2,609,4.495495495495495

549745,4,6303046436,"Classic 50's  sci-fi. I watched it first in 3d and the 3d effects were surprising good, Video quality for a movie of this age was very good, probably the best this movie will ever look. Now the bad, audio quality was not good, but not bad enough to really complain about, again this is a very old movie so again I wasn't expecting too much audio wise. Like I said I first watched it in 3d on my sound system in the living room and then later watched it in 2d on a different sound system in my bedroom and pretty much sounded the same, not too good. I wasn't expecting anything stellar due to its age but this was still a bit disappointing. Dialogue was all over the place.  Sometimes when one actor was speaking to another he was loud and clear but when the other actor spoke he sounded muffled? Still I loved this movie and for the price I am very happy with it, They kept the video exactly as it was when it was first released right down to a break where the movie stops and the screen states Intermission, its only for a few seconds not enough time to get up and get a soda or popcorn, lol. I did not know Russell Johnson was in this movie but I recognized him right away, Some of you might remember him as the professor on Gilligan's Island.

I can't stress enough how well done this restoration is, and at the current street price of under $9 is perhaps THE BEST DEAL

I was blown away by the sophistication and beauty of the 3D effects, and their use in the creation of atmosphere and the advancement of the plot. What we had been missing all these years! My fervent wish was for a 3D version to be released commercially that reproduced the original with no fakery.

This is it. Having just acquired a high-end 3D TV, this was my first test-disc - and it's a beauty. It looked great on my 2D system; it was stunning in 3D, at least as good as the theatrical experience on film. Enjoy the film for the wonderful Ray Bradbury story - but, if you're like me, you also come to cherish little moments of 3D effects along the way: the telescope, the xenomorph's eye protruding on a stalk, the Joshua tree, the telephone wires, the reach for the gun in the holster - and those amazing coat hangers!

550172,5,6303046436,"I saw this film in a theater when it opened in 1953, and this restoration is exactly what I saw in the theater 64 years ago. The wide screen restoration is flawless in my opinion.  When I saw this film in 1953 it had a 3-D short subject that featured Russ Morgan and Nat ""King"" Cole.  It would have been nice if this short subject had been included on the 3-D Blu-ray for nostalgia reasons.  But I'm not complaining, because this disk does have some nice bonus features and the disk is such a great bargain that it's a ""must have"" for the collection of everyone with a 3-D TV and a love of classic 3-D films.  I've read that the Blu-ray contains the original three channel stereo soundtrack.  I can't confirm this, because it's not mentioned on the box, so I had my home theater system turned off when I watched the disk. All the box cover says is ""theater quality sound"", which could mean anything.  The next time I watch this disk I'll be sure to have my home theater surround sound system turned on, because most of the original stereo sound has been lost from 3-D films made in the Fifties and the inclusion of the original stereo sound is a big plus for the restoration.",1494115200,,1175,4.342465753424658

550176,4,6303046436,"I was rummaging through my favorite used book store which also carries movies and music (yea vinyl) and I came across this old movie on Blu ray and in 3-D no less.  It turns out this is one of the first, if not the first, 3-D movies.  It was directed by Jack Arnold who would go on to make 2 more movies in 3-D for Universal, Creature from the Black Lagoon (a personal favorite) and Revenge of the Creature.

The films opening narration by its hero John Putnam (Richard Carlson, a mainstay of this genre) goes something like this: This is Sand Rock, Arizona, of a late evening in early spring. It's a nice town, knowing its past and sure of its future, as it makes ready for the night, and the predictable morning. The desert blankets the earth, cooling, resting for the fight with tomorrow's sun. Based on a story by famed sci-fi writer, Ray Bradbury, Arnold and screenwriter Harry Essex maintain a certain sophistication and elegance that comes with Bradburys stories.

Putnam is a writer who escaped the city for the desert.  Hes also an amateur astronomer peering frequently into the starry sky.  One night, he and his girlfriend, Ellen (Barbara Rush) see what appears to be a meteorite flash across the horizon and crash.  They grab a neighbor, Pete (Dave Willock), who conveniently has a helicopter and head for the crash site.  John decides to go down into the crater to see whats what.  He finds what appears to be some kind of metallic structure buried by the earth.  He also sees movement.  When the sides of the crater begin to crumble he scurries to the surface, explaining what hes seen.  Pete thinks hes seeing things and even Ellen has her doubts.  When the towns sheriff, Matt Warren (Charles Drake) is called in, he is likewise skeptical.  In fact he doesnt like John who is playing kissy face with Ellen, his former heartthrob.  Matt even threatens John because Ellen isn't tending to her school teacher duties.  Ahthe 50s.

In any case the aliens from outer space are real and real ugly, but fortunately they also have the ability to shape shift into human form.  But they need to put the actual humans on ice first.  It is made clear that they will recover.  This leads to their humanoid appearance becoming more zombie like, emotionless and verbally constricted.  The reality however is that the aliens had car trouble with their space craft and need time to fix it.  They will then be on their way.  John understands and tries to buy them time.  But of course the xenophobic sheriff and his posse have other ideas.

I will suggest this film be seen in 3-D if possible.  It is truly well done and in fact was shot purposely in 3-D, not some after production methodology.  Dare I say, it is as good as what is available today.  The Blu ray transfer is excellent.  I didn't watch the 2-D but for a few minutes and found it very good from what I saw.  The 3-D is demo worthy, with only a shade of darkness over the 2-D version.  That is to be expected.  It is still easy to watch.  The disc comes with 1080p video resolution and an aspect ratio of 1.34:1.  The 3-D is tastefully done, providing depth and scope to the film.  We get a few reach outs including one of the arms/tentacles from the creature.  The audio has a DTS-HD Master Audio 3.0 track, restored from the original stereo 3-track magnetic tape.  It is very, very good.  The disc includes English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.  Extras include a terrific 32 minute documentary (480i) called The Universe According to Universal).  Narrated by film historian Rudy Behlmer, it gives us a look at Universals place in film history with regard to the sci fi films of the 1950s.  Entertaining and informative.  There are 2 trailers, one in each dimension, and an audio commentary track by film historian Tom Weaver.  Highly recommended.",1493510400,3,3814,4.604754829123328

It was, along with CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON Universal's foray into dual projection, polaroid 3D.  The ""alien creature,"" such as it, was pretty hokey, and certainly watching this film, you are very much aware of the technical limitations of what could be done with special effects in the 50s.  That said, also in that same year (1953) came a major leap forward in much more realistic special effects (and quite frankly, much more of a coherent story line too) with the release of George Pal's WAR OF THE WORLDS (Paramount) which raised the special effects barre by light-years in the same way Kubrick's 2001 did in the 60s.  IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE still is what today we would consider a ""B"" movie, although at the time it did very good business for Universal.  More interesting than the movie itself is the very informative commentary that is part of the added features with this BluRay release.  BTW, THE WAR OF THE WORLDS and IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE both start with a metior hitting the earth, out of which both spew aliens, nasty and benign (sort of) respectively.",1489968000,2,1228,4.714953271028038

550866,5,6303046436,"This review is for the Universal Studios Home Entertainment blu-ray version of 'It Came from Outer Space' released in February, 2017.

This is one of the better 50's science fiction movies. It is base on a story by the great science fiction writer Ray Bradbury.
'It Came from Outer Space' was the first of the 50's science fiction films to be filmed in the desert. Afterward there would be many.

This is an excellent release if you are fans of 50's science fiction and are on a budget. At the time of the release it was selling for $9.29 on Amazon.
You get both the 2D and 3D versions of the movie. Be sure to watch the 3D version if you are only going to watch it once.

BLU-RAY: The image was decent but not as great as I had hoped. I was surprised to see that the 3D version actually looked cleaner than the 2D version. The picture appears to be clean and all imperfections have been removed. My only complaint is that the pictures just didn't appear as clear as I've seen other movies from the time period.

3D: The 3D is excellent. To my eyes, the 3D version actually looked better than the 2D version. I am not sure what the reason is for that. I'm sure any person in the field of photography  could explain why.
'It Came from Outer Space' is considered one of the best 3D movies from the era. The great science fiction director, Jack Arnold, utilized the 3D in such a way as to add to the movie rather than to just use it as a gimmick. There are several scenes where the 3D is used to show depth. It is used in such a way as to convey dread as John Putnam (Richard Carlson) peers into a cave or in a doorway.
The 3D is especially effective out in the desert. There are several scenes that give you a spectacular view of the mountains in the distance and it gives you the impression that you are there. Also when on a cliff edge, you get a real feeling of depth as rocks tumble into the depths below.
There are the more traditional 3D scenes with stuff flying at you. For example there is a rock slide and you see the rocks bouncing into your lap. My favorite scene was at the beginning when John and Ellen go outside to see the stars and the telescope comes into view in front of you. It looks as if it is in your living room.
There is a small negative to the 3D as well. It becomes obvious which scenes are shot in a studio. While viewing in 3D, the backround will appear to be a wall with a picture on it or it will be quite obvious when the characters are in the car driving that the background is a running projection. But that should be overlooked due to all of the great 3D scenes.

EXTRA'S: There are several extra's included with this release. The are:

- Comentary with film historian Tom Weaver. I have not listened to this as of the date I wrote this review.
- A half hour documentary titled ""The Universe According to Universal,"" an Origianal Documentary on It Came From Outer Space."" This is a pretty good documentary. From it I learned that this was the first science fiction movie filmed from the alien persective and that it was the first sci-fi filmed in the desert. Also it was Universal's first 3D movie and they created their own 3D process using two camera's.
- There is a trailer in 2D and 3D.
- Subtitles are included.

PLOT/SUMMARY: John Putnam (Richard Carlson) is a science fiction writer. He has gone to the Arizona desert where he and his girlfriend Ellen Fields (Barbara Rush) witness what they believe is a meteor crashing into the desert. When they get there John climbs down into the crater and sees a space ship which is then buried by a landslide. John later confronts the aliens. Essentially, the tell John to stay out of their business and nobody will get hurt.  We find out that the aliens have crashed landed and they have to repair their ship and then they will be on their way. The aliens don't trust humans and believe they will try to harm them if they reveal themselves. It's not made clear why they trust John Putnam and nobody else when they have just met him. He has a lot of trouble getting anybody to believe him. When people start disappearing and behaving strangely the town sheriff finally believes John. John has to convince the sheriff not to kill the aliens before it's too late.

THOUGHTS/RECOMMENDATIONS: The direction is excellent as would be expected from the great director, Jack Arnold. There are several genuinely creepy moments.

There are some plot holes just like in any of the movies from this time. The aliens seemed to be more than competent enough to take care of themselves and there really was no need to take any hostages. Also, having the ability to shape shift should have prevented them from ever having to show themselves. The sheriff shoots one of the townspeople in a truck without ever really knowing if that person was an alien as he had not seen an alien up to that point and only had the word of Putnam, whom he distrusted. The whole 92 degree thing they had going seemed kind of forced.

The glitter like trail of the aliens seemed to be above the ground in some scenes such as in the house when it disappears.

The writing is uneven at times. It's often obvious which lines were taken directly from Ray Bradbury and which lines were written for the movie. There are a few interesting ruminations. But for the most part the writing was very good.

I give this release 5 stars primarily due to the excellent 3D and budget price. The extra's only add to the value.
5 out of 5 stars for the movie. 5 out 5 stars for the 3D. 4 out of 5 stars for 2D.

I highly recommend this release to fans of the movie and fans of all classic science fiction. Also for 3D buffs.",1487635200,2,5649,4.341232227488152
550867,5,6303046436,"Finally, It Came From Outer Space in 3-D.
It's about time these classic 1950's 3-D movies are becoming available.
The audio is great but when an actor is speaking off camera the audio drops a little and has different equalization...It's difficult to explain but it does not take away the great quality of the 3-D presentation.
Throw away those worthless Red/Blue glasses from previous releases because this is beautiful Black & White  Blu-ray 3-D at it's best and you even get the original 3-D movie trailer.
Beware that there is similar version selling at expensive prices.

Richard Carlson was my Hero, in this one and The Magnetic Monster.  And lovely Barbara Rush, what can I say?--that my preteen body did not already flag when I first saw her in this sci-fi Classic?  (She pointed that high-power laser at me near the end of the film, and I pointed back.)  I am so glad ICFOS has been resurrected and the rumor that one of the two 3D sides was lost IS NOT TRUE!  3D movies NOW are often so full of CGI Special Effects, rammed into your eyes at top speed, that you cannot follow the plot.  I hear many friends say 3D sucks, gives them a headache.
Not so in the 1950's.  Carlson, in the movie THE MAZE, was creepy, and when his relative, a guy in a rubber frog suit, jumped out from behind a hedge, people in the audience dropped their popcorns and drinks and screamed bloody murder.  Now reviewers troll that same flick, now shown in flat 2D.  I know it takes a lot of time and money to resurrect old movies, so it's no wonder that many are neglected.  This one is worth it!  I met Ray Bradbury twice many years ago, and it is obvious HE wrote the story and had his treatment merely retyped.  Some of the beautiful poetry remains in the dialogue.",1480636800,45,1602,4.35016835016835

The making-of featurette gives a nice overview of the film's production and discusses its place among other Universal SciFi films from the era. The commentary is also very informative with interesting information not duplicated in the making-of featurette and the commentator is not frightened to provide his own personal opinions even if they are not always positive. This is something I like in a commentary by a knowledgeable expert.

My original review commented negatively that this 3D version of the film was not in widescreen format even though the film had been released in widescreen. I have been corrected by some knowledgeable commentators who have stated that this film was originally filmed and composed in the old TV full-frame format (1.33:1) and only cropped for some specific showings in the new widescreen format. So it would appear that this full-screen (1.33:1) format is the optimum version of the film as the director intended.",1480377600,2,1259,4.995238095238095

Amateur astronomer John Putnam [Richard Carlson] and his fianc&eacute;e Ellen Fields [Barbara Rush] are stargazing in the desert when a spaceship bursts from the sky and crashes to the ground. Just before a landslide buries the ship, a mysterious creature emerges and disappears into the darkness. Of course, when he tells his story to the sheriff [Charles Drake], John Putnam is branded a crackpot; but before long, strange things begin to happen, and the tide of disbelief turns

Based on a story by acclaimed writer Ray Bradbury, It Came From Outer Space is a science fiction classic that is as thought-provoking and tantalizing today as it was when it first ""landed"" on the silver screen.

FILM FACT: The film's script is based on Ray Bradbury's original story treatment but not, as sometimes claimed, a published short story in The Meteor publication. IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE was first film in the 3D process from Universal-International. Filming took place on location in and around the California towns of Palmdale and Victorville, and the Mojave Desert. The uncredited music score for the film was composed by Irving Gertz, Henry Mancini, and Herman Stein. The special effects created for the in-flight alien spacecraft consisted of a wire-mounted iron ball, with hollowed out 'windows,' with burning magnesium inside. The Arizona setting and the alien abduction of telephone lineman and two other characters are fictionalized story elements taken from Ray Bradbury's younger life, when his father moved the family to Tucson, Arizona. This 3D Blu-ray has the image mastered and the original stereophonic three-track magnetic audio meticulously restored by Greg Kintz and the 3-D Film Archive! For the first time since 1953, you will see IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE with the original intermission break.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Despite the out-of-this-world title and the involvement of several Sci-Fi film genre, IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE [1953] is hardly a typical Fifties type Sci-Fi film because it was based on material by the bona fide science fiction writer, namely Ray Bradburys short story The Meteor. Add to this the all-encompassing fears engendered in us by the burgeoning Cold War, with the whole nation at the time, caught up in a panic of potential Red infiltration, and you have a perfect storm of sorts, which would result in a golden age of science-fiction horror. Technology could not be trusted; the strange, the unknown, the outsider, could not be trusted. It was a time of rapid paranoia, and filmmakers were more than happy to step up and take advantage.

Jack Arnold's screenwriter was Harry Essex, the same man who would deliver the script to Creature from the Black Lagoon to him the following year. Jack Arnold also had as his star the earnest and intense Richard Carlson, who also starred in The Creature From The Black Lagoon, as well. And although that latter film gets all the press when it comes to Universal-International in the 1950s, it's entirely possible that this is the better film.

During the 1950s Hollywood produced some of its greatest science fiction genre classics. It was during this decade that science fiction films became focused with the possibility of visitors from another planet arriving on the Earth. In some cases, the aliens were beneficent as was the visitor in THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, who came to warn the people of Earth against their destructive warlike ways. However, in many cases the aliens were hostile and bent on taking over the planet, as they were in EARTH VS THE FLYING SAUCERS or WAR OF THE WORLDS. Somewhere between these two extremes we find the film IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE in which the alien visitors are depicted in a neutral fashion, as travellers making an unexpected stopover on Earth when their spaceship breaks down.

IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE is based upon a Ray Bradbury screen story and the final film benefits from the poetic quality of the authors writings. Portions of the dialogue came directly from Ray Bradburys screen treatment had given the film and its characters greater depth than one would typically find in a 1950s science fiction genre film outing. Of course, Director Jack Arnold infuses the story with the right level of chills, thrills and unexpected jolts. There are some weaknesses in the structure of the story, but I would imagine they were introduced after Ray Bradburys work on the project was completed.

The plot of IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE centres on a meteor strike in the Arizona desert. Local amateur astronomer John Putnam [Richard Carlson] and his girlfriend Ellen Fields [Barbara Rush] witness the meteor strike and head out to the desert to investigate. John, Ellen and a local helicopter pilot are the first people on the scene, and John decides to go down alone into the massive impact crater to get a good look at the meteor. What John Putnam finds resembles a spaceship, and when he approaches too close to the unknown object, the rim of the crater collapses, completely burying whatever landed in the desert. Of course, no one believes Johns fantastic tale, that is, until some of the locals are abducted and replaced by alien duplicates. Things don't become any better when John uncovers the aliens true intentions and finds himself protecting the aliens from discovery, as a means of insuring the lives of their very human hostages. The cast of IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE also includes Charles Drake, Joe Sawyer, Russell Johnson and Kathleen Hughes.

It's a classic formula, and one that delivers profusely. Part of the 3-D craze of the early 1950s that also gave us the likes of House of Wax which was vying for audiences in the summer of 1953, and in The Creature From The Black Lagoon the following summer, It Came from Outer Space is engagingly shot by Clifford Stine, who would go on to shoot such epics as Spartacus and Patton. Yes, the 3-D effects were often forced and contrived, as is so much of the 3-D of that era, but it's a testament to the forethought of both Jack Arnold and Clifford Stine that the Sci-Fi film works just as well in 2-D, but overall the 3-D in this fil works beautiful and creates a wonderful depth of field.

The plot, conceptualised by Ray Bradbury, is innovative for its time, portraying the aliens as misunderstood by a mistrusting and primitive human populace and it's the kind of progressive sci-fi thinking that would later give rise to the likes of Star Trek and other such thoughtful, hopeful, utopian sci-fi entertainment. The movie also has so much of what we've come to expect from genre pictures of the 1950s and an exasperated, dire protagonist; a constantly screaming leading lady; and of course, lots of lots of Theremin, played by the legendary master of the instrument, Samuel Hoffman. Universal-International of the 1950s may have been a shadow of what it was in the 1930s, but this Sci-Fi picture is still a whole lot of fun, and proves that the studio could still be counted on to deliver a rollicking good monster movie, which is amongst the massive sci-fi horror movement and one that is still one of the best.

3D Blu-ray Video Quality  Universal Pictures brings this remastered 3D Blu-ray in a stunning crisp black-and-white 1080p transfer itself looks really good, offering a very sharp and well-defined image. Film grain is not very noticeable throughout the course of the film so giving a smooth image and especially that IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE is well over a half a century old. Blacks are very solid and deep, while the whites remain stable. Contrast is fairly smooth, plus the look of the day for night photography holds up pretty well in this image transfer. This is a near flawless viewing experience as the image much of the time looks like and feels like it was shot for the modern audiences and not well over 60 years ago. For both the 2D and 3D experiences, fine film grain has been retained and provides an incredible amount of detail. Facial features, clothing, the desert landscape, the aliens and all come through with terrific clarity and without any horrendous DNR [Digital Noise Reduction] or smoothing that I can see. The greyscale provides some deep and inky black levels and plenty of shadow separation. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

3D Blu-ray Audio Quality  Universal Pictures brings this remastered 3D Blu-ray in a brilliant 3.0 DTS-HD Master Audio LCR Discrete soundtrack that is a really nice surprise, giving the movie a bit more atmosphere than a flat monaural presentation. I did notice that a number of the stereo sound effects were inversed, coming from the opposite side of the screen where they are depicted visually. Fidelity is limited by the recording technology available back in 1953, but the films Theremin intensive score still manages to sound quite good and quite creepy. Dialogue reproduction is pretty clean and the actors voices are always completely understandable. Neither background hiss nor any other forms of audible distortion were noticeable at fairly natural listening levels. From the first big impact explosion to the rock slide to the thrilling conclusion, this audio track punches up the audio tones giving it a very unsettling sense of immersion, and you might want to turn the sound down, well don't as it is all part of atmospheric effects of this Sci-Fi film  so keep it loud! Dialogue is still audible without any interference and the rich background audio only complements the impressive 3D experience.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: The Universe According to Universal [2000] [480i] [1.33:1] [31:36] This is an original special feature documentary about Universal Studios Sci-Fi films of the 1950's. Though the piece may initially play out like a shameless self-promotional montage of Universal sci-fi productions, especially from the Flash Gordon pictures of the 1930s to This Island Earth [1955] and E.T. The Extra Terrestrial [1982], this may be the most accessible learning tool for those unfamiliar with Jack Arnold and his brand of 1950s post-atomic creature features. Discussed here is the paranoia of the atomic age, the fear of new technology as prompted by the 1945 invention of the atomic weapon, the poetry of Ray Bradbury's language, the use of alien perspective, especially in later films like Tarantula [1955] and the archetypical use of the Theremin. The featurette serves as an evocative tour through Jack Arnold's work, from It Came From Outer Space [1953] and Creature From the Black Lagoon [1954] to his masterpiece The Incredible Shrinking Man [1957]. It offers a very nice narration from film historian Rudy Behlmer; like Tom Weaver, Rudy Behlmer is a veteran of many Universal Classic Monsters that were released on inferior DVDs. We also see lots of film clips from both Space and many other genre of that period, along with interview comments from people like Vincent Di Fate [Science-Fiction Illustrator/Historian], Bob Burns [Collector/Archivist], David Schecter [Producer of Monstrous Movie Music], Paul Jensen [Film Historian], Bob Furmanek [Curator of the 3-D Film Archives] and Irving Gertz [Composer]. All in all this is a very nice little feature that is packed with so much insightful fascinating information.

Theatrical Trailer [1953] [1080p] [1.33:1] [2:41] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE and you get the choice to view each trailer in either 3D and 2D images, so double the enjoyment. It informs us Please Keep Your Glasses On For A Preview Of Our Next Attraction In 3-Dimension.

Feature Audio Commentary with Film Historian Tom Weaver: This is a truly excellent audio commentary and is densely packed with information about the film, its stars, writers and director. Tom Weaver also brings an enthusiastic and entertaining quality to the audio commentary, which convinces the listener that they are in the room with a fan who is talking about a favourite Sci-Fi film. Though film scholar Tom Weaver's commentary track may sound scripted and hurried, it could be one of the more engaging commentaries you're likely to come across. When the film starts, we are introduced to this fascinating audio commentary with Tom Weaver, who informs us that the composed film music by Herman Stein was hauntingly played on a Theremin, and now speaks the words from author Ray Bradbury saying, across the night sky a vast roaring furnace, a bright blazing stream of fire, like a gush of molten metal from the stars, races across the horizon to horizon, and Tom Weaver also says that these are the opening sounds and 3-Demensional sights that it came from outer space, written by Ray Bradbury, produced by William Alland, directed by Jack Arnold. We are informed that the film was partially shot on location in Victorville in the Mojave Desert. For eighty non-stop minutes, Tom Weaver exposes incredible secrets and lies: Universal Pictures only seeing the obvious and they asked that Jack Arnold construct the audience-friendly Xenomorph alien after production was completed; and screenwriter Harry Essex claiming that the film had little to do with Ray Bradbury's exhaustive treatment to purported to be some 100-plus pages long; and how the film left an indelible impression on directors like Joe Dante and Steven Spielberg. Tom Weaver's casual acknowledgement of goofs and trivia that is particularly very funny, especially when he says, ""Why is Richard Carlson's pipe upside down?"" or ""Is that Francis the Talking Mule?"" Tom Weaver talks about the scene where the meteor spaceship crash lands in the desert and explains that in fact the meteor ship was about 8 to 9 in diameter and was about the same size as a bowling ball, and it was made out of iron and formed into a hollow ball, then they cut out 6 little side pieces out of the iron until all that was left was a hollow cage, and then they put on tail fin on the back of it and also put a little door on the back of it and through that door they inserted a can of magnesium powder, which burns very brightly, and we see it at the start of the film, it was fitted to a wire so it could slide down towards the camera and lands in a sandbox, and was film in the Universal Studio, but when we see the object coming towards the camera, the camera was pointed at a mirror and on the impact of the mirror you can see on the left hand side of the screen the edge of the mirror, and if you freeze frame the impact, and you can see the shards of glass shattering into tiny pieces. When you see the three character actors at the top of the crater looking down, this was actually filmed at Red Top Mountain and the director spent six days of location shooting, but when you see Richard Carlson goes to the bottom of the crater, which by the way was a stand in walking to the bottom of the crater, and this was actually filmed in the Sierra Canyon. Another fascinating fact we hear is that Universal did a test in 3-D shooting in widescreen, so slightly annoyed why they didn't shoot the whole film this way, as it would have been so much more dramatic. One thing you might not know about this film is that the original intention was to keep the Xenomorph alien off camera throughout the film, to make the audience use their imagination and Ray Bradbury warned Universal not to reveal the alien to the audience, but as usual Universal ignored this advice, because Ray Bradbury felt revealing the alien spoiled the mystery of the alien, especially for the audience going to see the film. So to sum up this audio commentary, well I think Tom Weaver is a totally brilliant speaker and keeps you fascinated throughout the film and gives you so much information which I have not heard in an audio commentary before and you never get bored, as he tells you lots of other fascinating facts about the film that I have not mentioned, also at the end he tanks all the people involved with the film, that helped him with his research notes to reveal to us the audience and I can whole heartedly recommend everyone should listen to this brilliant audio commentary, it get a five star rating from me.

Finally, IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE is a fifties science fiction classic that has been given a pretty solid release by the folks at Universal Pictures. Back in 1953, IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE was set out to shock and dazzle the audiences, but todays audience will find it a slightly quirky and a slightly old fashioned Sci-Fi film, but I beg to differ, as to me it is still a totally brilliant film with its science fiction concept, but you must remember that when it was released in the cinema it was very competent for its era. The film could have worked equally as well in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio enhanced widescreen presentation. This is a really excellent package that is certain to please fans of this Sci-Fi genre. If you are a Sci-Fi film fan buff, then it is a must to add IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE to your Blu-ray collection. Established fans will really enjoy this Sci-Fi film, and especially for me after viewing it again for the first since I viewed in the cinema. Highly Recommended!

I have been waiting for this film to appear in 3-D Blu Ray format for a long time, to add to my more than 75 3-D titles. I can only hope that even more of the classic 3-D films will eventually be released.
The 3-D effects are truly stunning, with very little ghosting apparent. This is how 3-D is done, and is a lot more realistic that the current practice of 2-D to 3-D conversions done on modern films, though some of them are made quite well. I have watched it with the bonus commentary, so cannot comment yet on any stereophonic sound elements present. Yes, it is in the ""square"" video format, but is still well presented. I have always enjoyed films with Richard Carlson, and Barbara Rush is a visual treat. I would highly recommend this film if only for the impressive original 3-D photography.

551477,4,6303046436,"First off, just to set the record straight -- this is a must have film for anyone interested in classic films, great stories, early directional stereophonic sound, great B&W cinematography, taunt drama, and mid-1950s 3D films. The rest of you -- may simply find it very entertaining.

Filmed and presented in the standard Academy ratio, ""It Came from Outer Space"" looks and sounds great! Those desert landscapes are a sight to behold -- vast, sparse, and alive with character. The dialog is never buried in the mix. The drama feels like something Rod Serling would write. Ray Bradbury wrote the original screenplay which was further adapted for this film.

Filmed using 3D cameras, depth feels natural for the most part, quietly drawing in the audience. There are instances where it comes right at the viewer -- the meteor, the telescope, the ladder, the boulders -- those are impressive. But it's the story and performances that draws us in -- the rest is very tasty 3D frosting on the cake.

The cast acquit themselves very well. It's a taunt story well told. Definitely a keeper and I'm glad to have it!

This is a first class release from Universal!

I would compare it to episodes of The Twilight Zone.  Its about the plot, the atmospherics, the acting, not the props.  Highly recommended.  Why only 4 stars?  This was MEANT to be a grade B movie, a good movie with a serious message, but still a Saturday afternoon matinee, drive-in classic.

Although it has a few similarities to ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (the feeling of paranoia, people in the small town seeming to be not themselves), this movie is one of the few to make the aliens sympathetic.  They don't want to hurt or kill people, they just want to make repairs and leave the Earth.  Richard Carlson portrays the ""good guy"" who believes that the meteor that fell from the sky was a ship from outer space. The other town members don't believe him until faced with proof, and then they do what is expected: grab a few guns and let's go get 'em.  As in ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"", Carlson is the mild mannered hero who gets the girl. My husband calls him ""the B movie Charlton Heston"".  Oh, and don't expect to see too much of the blond on the box cover.  She is in the movie for about 4 minutes, but she is a little extra eye candy.

552230,3,6303046436,"It Came From Outer Space, 1953 film

A flaming ball hurtles across the sky. Sand Rock Arizona is a nice town. John the author has sold another article. There is an explosion when the flaming object crashes. A door opens to reveal the interior. What is there? Spooky music provides sound effects. A helicopter flies by the crater, then lands to investigate. Rocks fall into the crater. ""It's like nothing we've seen before."" ""Find out what they're doing here."" John drives away in his 1954 Mercury convertible. [Remember horn rings?] ""What was that?"" John takes his pistol to look around. A big eye views the departing car. Dr. Snell says the evidence points to a meteor.

The desert can kill in a thousand ways. What is that strange noise? What happened to Frank? ""Don't be afraid."" There are no marks or signs of them. John finds the two imposters, they give him a warning. We see prospectors in the desert. What happened to Tom? The Sheriff summons John and Ellen. Frank's wife knows something is wrong. George skipped dinner! Can somebody take over another person's body? What happened to Dr. Snell? What about Ellen? ""Be careful."" The aliens explain their needs. They want to leave, its not time to meet. But we see what they look like! Will people kill what they don't understand? [Fear and panic motivates people.] John returns home to find his clothes missing! What will happen? Does high temperatures cause murders? [Yes].

The Sheriff raises a militia armed with rifles. They will set up barricades to halt traffic. They shoot at the pickup truck, it crashes and burns. Will John meet Ellen? Will the earthlings be released to save the aliens? Can they seal the mine entrance? ""I guess that takes care of them."" A flaming ball flies through the sky. What about the future?

This was based on a Ray Bradbury story. It is a low budget film that reflects the culture of the 1950s. ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" was a better horror film. What does it say about the psychology of the public that want to be entertained by such stories?",1444262400,,2046,4.690807799442897

The story keeps you attentive but it has the classic movie predictability. Never the less, It kept me that I had to see it without interruption. Typical 50's Sci-Fi movies with pretty decent special effects for it's time. I particularly liked how they show how the aliens saw earth people through their ""eye"" (ok, no spoilers). In all, this is a good oldie movie worth watching over. I first watched this when I was a child back in the 60's and watched it a few times over through the years and I bought it because being a classic, who knows when it'll go out of print for good.

The cast is good and I liked the fact that it was put into the desert which, for some reason, made me think of it as better suited for an alien visitation.  Unlike the majority of 1950s SF tales, the aliens were not evil, not planning on an invasion.  Very refreshing and better that way.",1433980800,2,623,4.073770491803279

552812,5,6303046436,"""It Came from Outer Space"" is one of the real classics from the 1950s - the wonderful, glorious days of science fiction movies. I had first seen it during the Saturday afternoon ""Monster Matinee Double Feature "" (are you old enough to remember when you could see two movies for the price of a ticket?) at the Wilshire Theater in Fullerton, California as a little boy, sitting in the very front roll, taking in the whole screen while stuffing my mouth with popcorn! Many, many years later I taped it off TV, with commercials, then bought an original on VHS tape (remember VCRs? They were wonderful for their time!). And now it was time (finally) to get a copy on DVD. I may be old and well behind the times, but I am making progress. And thanks to Amazon I have been amassing a collection of my favorite sci-fi movies from the 1950s, as well as some of my favorites from later years.

""It Came from Outer Space"" is one of those movies that relies more on characterizations and dialogue than on special effects to make it interesting. It is one of those movies that I can watch periodically and not get tired of it. And yes, there is a very ugly alien creature in it that you see a little of, but mostly the alien takes human form to allow it to walk around in the open. It is a very fun movie!",1422489600,,1292,4.295081967213115

Groundbreaking plot and narrative in several ways, as other reviewers have pointed out very entertainingly. I won't spoil the plot here, but trust me, you'll have fun.

Everyone should see this. It's not quite up there with 'War Of The Worlds"" or ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"", but it's pretty good. It's a 1953 time capsule snapshot of the America of those days, and that's part of the charm.

So make some popcorn, put all expectations aside and relax, and you'll have some good 1953 B-movie fun.

Hope this review is helpful. Enjoy!",1410048000,,766,4.78030303030303

One of the things I find fascinating is the similarity in plots of old science fiction movies and Star Trek episodes. It isn't until the end of this feature, after all the action, is the nature of the invasion revealed. They could have revealed this sooner and had a few alien scenes to make the film more interesting, but didn't, opted to make it a mystery.

At the point where earth people confront the aliens, we discover they have evolved into energy. As Spock's words ""pure energy"" sang in my ears, I became aware it had more in common with a different episode of 1968, ""By Any Other Name.""

Elements in common:
1) Aliens are from a different galaxy.
2) Aliens occupy human beings and control them.
3) Aliens need a spaceship to return to their galaxy.
4) After a confrontation where aliens take over the humans and humans defeat their efforts, we offer to help them as friends.

A decent sci-fi film which incorporates the spinning color wheel.",1376870400,,981,4.686046511627907

Not until a lot of weird things begin to happen does anyone take the sighting seriously.
The person who actually witnesses the crashlanding (Carlson) helps the creature to get away by holding off a posse that is bound and determined to destroy it. The story line between the crashlanding and the final take-off is what makes this sci-fi movie worth watching; the interpersonal relationships and the mob mentality that erupts are realistic.",1368921600,3,798,4.962686567164179

553623,3,6303046436,"This is a thoughtful and intelligent Sci Fi film It is so much better in it's original 3D.
Many of the customer reviews are spot on. The original release of this film along with the creature from the black lagoon were shown on dual projector polarized systems.
The 3D was certainly on par with today's digital 3D when properly shown. The reason for the decline of that system was that the quality varied from theater to theater because the physical projection had to be perfect or the 3D effect would be painful to watch. The RED/BLUE anaglyph versions were a product of the 70's when the left & right reels were printed thru filters and superimposed on a single color print. There is no reason why Universal cannot release a crystal clear 3D blu ray of this as they did with The Creature from the Black Lagoon. I have seen this movie in it's original polarized 3D and it looks fantastic. FYI: Serious 3D fans may want to check out this years 3D Film Expo in Hollywood :
The World 3-D Film Expo III will be held at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood, California, September 6-15, 2013. The 10 day festival will pay tribute to the 60th anniversary of what many film historians regard as the ""Golden Age"" of 3-D, and will include screenings of the John Wayne western Hondo (1953), the Vincent Price horror film House of Wax (1953), Cole Porter's musical Kiss Me Kate (1953), the sci-fi thriller It Came From Outer Space (1953), and even later 3-D films, such as Jaws 3-D (1983). Lesser-known titles, such as The French Line (1953) with Jane Russell and Second Chance (1953) with Robert Mitchum, will also be included.",1368662400,,1613,4.604166666666667

553625,4,6303046436,"How frustrating, to see a flying saucer and have no one believe you.  Of course, in this case the saucer in question was already grounded............literally.

Richard Carlson plays the amateur astronomer/eye witness John Putnam as a petulant crackpot.  The more he insists he saw a flying saucer, the nuttier he sounds.  Those fools!  I did see it!  Its a good thing he didn't add the part about the BIG-alien-one-eye-floaty-whatsit.  They would have locked him up for a loon (surprising they didn't anyway).  I especially love the scene where he rants aloud to no one in particular, where are you?  Again, surprised his girlfriend didn't take this as a bad sign and go back to doing what she was paid for (apparently, in hick towns teachers are allowed to be delinquent as long as they're in the service of their demented boyfriends).
Fortunately, everything was easily explained once contact was made with the body duplicating alien crooks who just wanted some spare parts and to be left alone.

I like this movie.  There are several sinister scenes that out shine some of the wackier moments.  I love the duplicity of the aliens who insist they're good but in the same breath threaten to kill Putnam and a few miscellaneous townsfolk that they just happen to have kidnapped.  Maybe their definition of good is different from ours?  I also love that peace loving Putnam whips out his handgun no less than 5 times.

This is one of the few sci-fi films where the aliens are not the dominating interest of the movie; it's the interactions of the characters and what happens to them that makes this film out of the ordinary.

554153,4,6303046436,"It Came From Outer Space is sort of comforting 1950s nostalgia in sci-fi. The story line is unusual for the 1950s Cold War era. The Aliens are extremely ugly, but claim to have souls like us. They did not come to invade and when they do take over our bodies they mean no harm. Their reason for being on Earth has human logic to it i.e. their spaceship has an engine failure and they just want to make repairs and be on their way...and in the meantime they only to be left alone.
The black and white photography does not date the film so much as give it context and a kind comforting nostalgia, but it is however have stereo-sound.

John Putnam (Richard Carlson) the hero is a romantic dreamer misunderstood by the townsfolk and ridiculed for claiming that the ""meteor"" that fell to Earth has a lot more going on. Only his girlfriend, the, at times, hauntingly beautiful Ellen Fields (Barbara Rush) stays by his side ~ although she screams a bit too much.

Because they kept much of the Bradbury treatment the dialogue is unusually poetic. Note the linesman Frank Daylon's description of the mirages in the desert and the sound humming in the wires.

The big bonus for me was the Documentary on the history of Universal sci-fi films and the comments of Bob Burns sitting next the blue one eyed monster used in the film. The documentary points out that the 1950s sci-fi films reflected the paranoia of the Cold War. Monsters taking our neighbours over - the communists' brain washing people we know and never suspect as subversives. Death from the sky - flying saucers.
The commentary over the film suggests that an extra in an army corporal's uniform at the ""meteor"" crash site is comedy writer-performer Morey Amsterdam, later of the Dick Van Dyke Show, but they're not sure.

554154,5,6303046436,"It Came From Outer Space(1953) is one of the best and most important Sci-Fi/Horror films of the 50s, introducing a different concept to the fold that would play a huge impact on the genre. Where The Thing(1951) was bent on World Domination and Klattau from The Day the Earth Stood Still(1951) was intent on saving our planet, the alien in this film simply wants to get the hell out of here! The alien has crashlanded on our planet and being he's rather gruesome, has to assume human guise to seek aid to repair his ship. So he takes over a couple of humans and gets to work. Unfortunately, us earthlings don't quite understand the invader's intentions and mess up the works. Than the alien leaves. The end.

Okay, the film is actually somewhat better than that. It's very well acted by a good cast including Richard Carlson in the first of his many leading man roles in 50s Creature Features. His girlfriend, Barbera Rush is a real doll, too. The dialouge is great, mostly written by Ray Bradbury, but acredited to Harry Essex, who according to Bradbury simply rewrote his script and gave it to the studio! The direction is able by Jack Arnold, the leader of 50s Sci-Fi directing his first major film in that genre.

The film was originally released in 3-D, but the DVD isn't which is something of a shame. However, unlike most bare bones Universal DVDs, this one actually features some excellent supplemental features to compensate.

Amateur astronomer John Putnam (Richard Carlson) and schoolteacher Ellen Fields (Barbara Rush) view a ""meteor"" crash outside Sand Rock, Arizona, that turns out to be an alien spaceship. The craft is buried by a landslide, so with tangible proof gone, the town residents think Putnam and Fields have been watching too many scary flicks and are dreaming things up.

But feelings change when residents vanish for short periods of time and return in a robot-like state. Sheriff Matt Warren (Charles Drake) - who initially feels the story is a hoax - gets investigating, while Putnam picks up clues to get on the trail to locate the craft.

And what comes out of Putnam's search is alien explorers who want to repair their ship and leave Earth without causing panic. But it may be too late to give peace a chance.

554296,5,6303046436,"Nostalgia: 1950s sci-fi:

That kid on the front row of his father's small-town movie theatre was me, looking up at the wide screen while wearing my 3-D glasses and surrendering my burden of personal consciousness to the science-fiction plot.

Film theorists suggest that the act of viewing a motion picture, particularly in a theatre, causes audience members to temporarily lose their burden of personal consciousness. Although they may identify with the characters on the screen, they need assume no responsibilities. However, certain cinematic processes such as Cinerama, Panavision, 70mm prints with six-channel Dolby stereo, IMAX screens, and 3-D more actively involve movie viewers. When any of these filming and projection methods are combined with the subjective point of view, viewers may feel that they are not only participants but in control of the characters. In Jack Arnold's 3-D film IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE (1953), viewers are given control over the earthlings because the point of view when they confront the aliens is from the aliens' perspective.

This film was not the first to rely heavily on the subjective camera (see LADY IN THE LAKE 1946), nor the last (see those FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH movies that put the audience members in the position of a brutal serial killer); however, the fact that the characters here distrust what they see, and further, relinquish control of their own lives to the aliens makes this otherwise standard science-fiction entry in this over-stuffed 1950s genre worthy of another look. The point of view causes the viewers to identify with both earthlings as fearful victims as well as with the controlling aliens -- the watched as well as the watchers. With earthlings as their doubles, viewers are able to recognize their own fear of loss of control; when they view the earthlings from the aliens' perspective, however, they are able to determine the significance of this loss.

Three-dimensional cinematography, by its very nature, involves audiences subjectively; they can see the characters on the screen as cinematic doubles of themselves. Since the film is shot in black-and-white, the real as rendered by this Natural Vision process may be thought less real than those films shot in color as well as in 3-D. But even in monochrome, 3-D can transform the Arizona desert into a life-sized, museum-like exhibit that we could, if permitted, step into as easily as stepping through a window frame. Unfortunately, the controls on this window to the plastic world have been carelessly manned. The 3-D craze was short lived; despite ongoing attempts to resurrect it with such films as BEOWULF and Imax features, 3-D has never re-emerged to repeat the mass appeal magic of all those gimmicky but exciting 3-D films of the 1950s (like HOUSE OF WAX, THE MAZE, PHANTOM OF THE RUE MORGUE, SANGAREE, MAN IN THE DARK, GUN FURY, HONDO with John Wayne, INFERNO, DEVIL'S CANYON, KISS ME KATE, TAZA SON OF COCHISE, two of the three Creature of the Black Lagoon movies, and the first-out-of-the-gate BWANA DEVIL.)

The protagonist's telescope, the golfball-like spaceship itself, and the rocks of a huge avalanche are the most notable 3-D effects, and in this film they seem less gimmicky than in other early 3-D efforts. However, the protruding cyclops eyeball of each alien meant to penetrate the personal consciousness of the audiences might irritate some viewers in the same manner that the spears and arrows do in THE CHARGE AT FEATHER RIVER, jolting them from their comparatively relaxed involvement of the subjective forward tracking shots through the desert. Unfortunately, the polarized 3-D prints used in the 1950s have been largely replaced by the red-and-green anaglyph versions shown in theatres and, in some cases, on television. However, most of us today view IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE (1953) in its flat, two-dimensional version on television showings or in DVD versions such as this one, a bargain with all of the extras at this AMAZON price.

Even in two-dimensional viewings, without these 3-D protrusions from the screen, the subjective perspective of the camera is not only evident but is still powerful, and therein lies its significance. For our purpose, the fact that the film was originally shot in 3-D is no longer of major concern. It is the point of view of the aliens that intrigues critical scholars decades later, the subjective camerawork showing the earthlings through the cyclops eyes of the aliens. This point of view allows the audience to see the earthlings as victims. The residents of the sleepy desert town of Sand Rock, Arizona, find themselves enveloped in the billowing fog that borders the perspective of the viewers while the viewers themselves stalk victims from behind the bubble-eye of an alien. When the protagonists are captured, the viewers participate in their abduction the way viewers of the FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH movies participate in the murders of horny teenagers at Crystal Lake. When two miners, one of whom could be Gabby Hayes' twin brother, emerge from a mine shaft entrance, the viewers participate in their capture. The characters look toward the camera as the misty arms of the audience reach out to enfold them. Even when linemen (Russell Johnson and Joseph Sawyer) drive along the desert road in daylight, the audience tracks them from a moving high angle that could hardly be the point of view of an earthling. Both of these perspectives give the audience, as well as the aliens, a sense of control over the earthlings. These two affable linemen, Frank and George, tease resident amateur astronomer and writer John Putnam (Richard Carlson) about the ""riding"" that the townspeople and the media have been giving him for insisting that he saw aliens from space, yet they prove to be just as mystified by the sights and sounds of the desert. George tells Putnam and Ellen that Frank, who listens to a tap he has placed on the wire, ""is sure hearin' things."" Putnam scales the ladder to listen through this phone tap, and, in one of the effectively haunting scenes from a 1950s science-fiction film, the audience also hears the Theramin whining -- an eerie, high-pitched musical refrain that exploits our fear of, and fascination with, the unknown.

The ladder which John climbs extends out into the audience, inviting us to share his paranoia when Frank suggests that someone might be listening to them the way they are listening to whatever is on the line. Neither sight nor sound is to be trusted in the desert sun. As Frank points out in some of the more poetic lines ever appearing in a science-fiction film: ""After you've been working out on the desert fifteen years like I have, you hear a lotta things. See a lotta things too. The sun in the sky. Heat. All that sand out there. The rivers and lakes that aren't real at all. And sometimes you think that the wind gets in the wires and hums and listens and talks. Just like what we're hearing now. Still hear it?"" Putnam no longer hears the walking wind; it becomes one of the mysteries of the film that he never unravels. He merely knows that something is tapping into his life, listening and watching him with a cool intelligence. [Note: History majors and film scholars need not be reminded of the political climate during the time when the film was made.]
Because this something has not revealed its identity or its purpose while it continues to manipulate people and events like a cosmic film director, it maintains the control that Putnam has clearly lost.

After George tells Frank about a date that he has with Jane (Kathleen Hughes) that night, the two are captured by one of the cyclops aliens who protrudes his eye from the screen. For a moment, the audience is no longer safe in the theatre seats, yet once we are scrutinized by the alien intelligence, we are invited to become part of it; we see this later when Putnam and Ellen (Barbara Rush) encounter George's zombie-like duplicate in a scene again effectively photographed from the alien's point of view. The bubble representing the solitary eye and the sparkling mist surrounding it both condense into a solid replica of George's arm an instant before it touches Ellen's shoulder. The hand that does actually make contact appears to be completely human, but we know that it is not. The alien inadvertently reveals himself to Putnam and Ellen by staring point blank at the sun and by speaking in a voice that sounds as if it had been recorded in a tin shed. Putnam knows that what he thinks he sees is an illusion, but he rationalizes his confusion over identities by again blaming the sun for playing tricks on him. Unable to cope with the fact that they are now the investigated, not the investigators, the watched and the watchers, he ignores any edge which the revolver he carries might give him and drags Ellen back to town to get the sheriff.
As the audience, we share Putnam's frustration at not being able to convince anyone of the presence of the aliens. Putnam is an ineffectual adolescent in the face of parental authority figures like the professor, the pushy newspaper reporter, the Army major, and particularly the small-town sheriff until he fights with the sheriff (Charles Drake) and takes his gun away. He has failed to use a gun against the obviously superior force of the aliens, yet the weapon grants him temporary equality with his peers and power over the authority figure. He has regained at least a limited amount of control over his life.

Curiously, the audience remains in a neutral position when Putnam grapples with the sheriff, even though the 3-D process could place the audience within range of thrown punches, flying chairs, and phallic gun barrels. Directors of other 3-D films have exploited the depth process by including such gimmicks, but Arnold resists the overkill temptation by reserving the first-person point of view for the sequences in which the aliens directly contact the earthlings. Like a boy who whistles in the dark to mask his fears, Putnam tells the unseen alien who speaks to him from inside the mine to ""stand out in the sun."" Putnam reveals that he cannot trust what he cannot see, even though he knows that his vision in the brightly lit desert is not trustworthy. When the alien, who insists that he and his fellow travelers have souls and minds and ""are good,"" reveals himself to be a cyclops more frightening than Polyphemus but much more civilized (he doesn't eat visitors the way that the son of Poseidon devours the men of Odysseus), Putnam turns away in horror.

The fact that the eye of this cyclops often penetrates the space around it as well as the space beyond the screen in 3-D showings substantiates such a reading, and both of these fears represent, for many, a loss of control or power (a figure which the sheriff, more than Putnam, represents). Even in the daylight, however, Putnam has been blind, unlike the other humans who have not caught a glimpse of the roving eye, he becomes aware of his handicap -- his loss of control. Even though the alien has identified his race as ""good,"" he frightens Putnam by imparting the requested knowledge. Knowledge, after all, has a price. Even when he does ""see"" what is going on, he cannot share this vision; he can only realize that he, like the sheriff and the others, is definitely not in control.

When the aliens capture Ellen and create a double that can be sent forth to entrap Putnam, the audience sees her abduction from her perspective as she honks at Frank's duplicate in the middle of the road, then from the alien's point of view as the duplicate apparently drops its disguise to become the reality that terrified Putnam earlier. The point of view prevents the audience from seeing the alien's visage a second time. This alien's-eye view gives the audience, whether or not they are wearing their 3-D glasses, the perspective of a judge with cool, superior intellect, but the people they are observing and judging are not others -- not members of the starship Enterprise distanced from their lives by centuries -- but themselves; viewers can see their own frailties and limitations that these characters embody. These characters really are doubles created for an audience to view and -- through the aliens -- observe, judge, and control.

Curiously, Ellen's double appears to be less benevolent than the other aliens; when Putnam and the audience see the mysterious figure atop the hill, she wears a black evening gown with a flowing scarf instead of the conservative schoolteacher suit she wears during her abduction. The double's mere presence, resembling the heroine on the cover of a romantic paperback novel as well as a film noir heroine or femme fatale, compels Putnam to follow, which she does. However, she remains beyond his -- and our -- reach because her function is to lure him to the entrance of the mine, to the threshold of the heart of darkness which he is not yet ready to enter. After all, he does not trust his visual judgment in the daylight. How can he expect to fare better in the dark?

However, Putnam does gain the courage to penetrate the darkness and journey toward its center. He encounters there the double of Ellen who informs him that he can no longer be trusted. She tries to lure him into the River Styx that separates them, then attempts to kill him with a phallic wand. When she shoots a white ray at him like Harry Potter and his friends are able to spew forth an orgasmic force from their magic wands, the perspective is that of the alien; the audience participates in the attempt to penetrate him and to kill him. This power in her hand is ineffectual, however, as it swings in a wide swath above his head. Despite their power, the aliens (and the audience, since they see this from the alien's point of view) are unable to destroy the human original (and viewer counterpart). He fires a revolver at her, penetrating her shell (and the audience's); the alien and the audience fall into the gulf between them. Since never again in the film are any on-screen activities or earthlings seen from the point of view of the aliens, both Putnam and the audience have achieved a state of awareness. Instead, they confront the doubles and their originals -- the captives.

Putnam takes viewers deeper into the labyrinth in search of a cyclops or two where he encounters his own double wearing his clothing -- but clothing that is unlike the dull suits he usually wears. This double, however, possesses a stronger weapon than the wand which, instead of cutting Putnam in half, only carves slashes in a cave wall. This phallic machine that ejaculates a more powerful white ray at a spherical object can destroy the entire earth -- threatening enough to make it a hot topic on George Noory's middle-of-the-night radio show COAST TO COAST AM. ""Look at its power,"" intones the alien in human form, illustrating how this power allows them to be completely in control. The weapon provides enough ""power to drive a ship through space. Power to tear your earth apart."" These doubles, the audience sees, are stronger than, and more in control of, the originals than the originals are of themselves, even though they are illusory projections.

The aliens, despite their control, cannot destroy the human earthlings because these humans are a primitive form of themselves, and because it was they who fell upon the world of the humans and not the humans who invaded their world. When the duplicate of Putnam orders the release of the human prisoners, none of whom have been harmed, the other alien duplicates look on. Except for the different -- but earthly -- garments they all wear, one group is a mirror image of the other. The point of view in this scene is neither that of the humans nor of the aliens; the audience is free to evaluate both the human originals (their counterparts) and the alien duplicates (the illusory but powerful projections of themselves).

After Putnam emerges from the mine with the abducted humans and -- in a gesture to convince the other humans to give up control of that of which they have only imagined control anyway -- seals off the entrance, the sheriff assumes that the alien doubles have been repressed. However, the ground shakes as the engines of the spaceship are activated and, in a reverse of the opening shot of the film, the aliens leave. Ellen asks if the aliens have gone for good, and the camera brings the audience in for a close-up of Putnam as he delivers a dose of 1950s philosophical moralizing. ""Just for now,"" Putnam utters wistfully. ""It wasn't the right time for us to meet."" The dual perspective might invite us to add: ""the right time for us to meet ourselves."" Putnam continues that ""there'll be other nights, other stars for us to watch. They'll be back.""

Aliens did return in more frightening and subtle films such as the noir classic INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (1955) and much later in such high-tech films as the special effects extravaganza CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and the somewhat maudlin E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL, but, unfortunately, mankind, still thinking that it is in control, remains blind and repressed under tons of rock. even in the glare of tricky sunlight. The message of IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE (the screenplay was based on a treatment by Ray Bradbury, thus the poetic dialogue) does urge audiences, through the point of view which involves them as well as through the innocuous-sounding speeches, to be understanding and tolerant.

Let's hope this was the message that the little boy sitting on the front row of his father's theatre wearing those cardboard 3-D glasses, like other little boys and girls who are now grown-ups, came away with. Let's also hope that new generations can look beyond their addictions to explosions, car chases, bloody violence, and CGI in order to appreciate this ageless message as they watch this film on DVD.",1203552000,,17904,4.860747051114023

With the advent of HDTV, surely this isn't an impossible or unreasonable request.  Along the way you also learn about the many script credit battles and that Sand Rock, Arizona, is really Victorville, California.  Way cool.

554465,5,6303046436,"Bwana Devil (1952) may have ushered in the `golden era' of 3-dimensional films in the early 1950s, but two of the best features to utilize the process at the time, in my opinion, were Vincent Price's House of Wax (1953), which I actually got to see in most spectacular 3D some years ago at Chicago's Music Box Theater (if you love movies and are even in town, you really should make a point to visit the place), and this science fiction thriller classic It Came from Outer Space (1953), which I have yet to see in 3D, but would surely love the opportunity.  Based on a treatment by Ray Bradbury, the film was directed by Jack Arnold (Creature from the Black Lagoon, Tarantula, The Incredible Shrinking Man) and starred Richard Carlson (The Amazing Mr. X, The Magnetic Monster, Creature from the Black Lagoon), Barbara Rush (When Worlds Collide, Captain Lightfoot), and Charles Drake (Winchester '73, Bonzo Goes to College).  Also appearing is Joe Sawyer (Them!, The Killing), Russell `The Professor' Johnson (This Island Earth, Attack of the Crab Monsters, ""Gilligan's Island""), and Kathleen Hughes (The Golden Blade, Cult of the Cobra), in a small, but noticeable, role.

As the movie, set in Sand Rock County, Arizona, begins we meet a handsome young couple named John Putnam (Carlson) and Ellen Fields (Rush).  John's a junior astronomer and part time writer while Ellen is a schoolteacher.  As they enjoy a quiet evening together out at John's remote, desert shanty (well, maybe not so quiet as Ellen keeps blabbing on about getting married), they witness a flaming object streaking across the sky, eventually smashing into the Earth out by the old Excelsior mine.  Upon investigation they find a huge, honking crater.  As John ventures in (you're a braver man than I, Gunga Din), he discovers the object wasn't just a meteor, but a space ship, one that contains cycloptic, squid-like alien life!  As John tries to comprehend this amazing happenstance, an unfortunate rockslide dumps a couple hundred tons of Earth on the ship, effectively burying any proof John has of his fantastic story.  Soon Sheriff Matt Warren (Drake), whose got the hots for Ellen, makes the scene, along with some other rubes, and John tries to relate what he saw, but of course no one believes him (even Ellen is unsure what to make of it), and eventually he becomes something of a laughingstock, especially after the newspapers pick up on the story...well, we'll see who laughs last when someone gets their face melted off by a trigger happy Martian sporting a Type 6 Megasonic Destructor Ray...turns out the plucky aliens didn't perish in the rockslide, but are out and about, forcefully co-opting local yokels and assuming their appearance so that they may move freely among us.  Their purpose?  Well, you'll just have to watch the film and find out for yourself...my money's on the seizure of our women for procreation purposes, as if science fiction films have taught me anything aliens have a real yen for Earth babes...

While It Came from Outer Space isn't my absolute favorite science fiction feature to come out of the 1950s (that's a toss up between 1951's The Day the Earth Stood Still and 1956's Forbidden Planet), it's definitely up there in the top five, and considered by many to be a staple of the genre with good reason, primarily because it's extremely entertaining, even despite the fact it lacks the original 3D presentation on this DVD (there's any number of scenes shot specifically for the process, some obvious, some not so much).  While watching this film, I learned a number of things including the follow...

1. Despite mastering the delicate intricacies of space travel, aliens still have yet to work out the kinks on landing (while plowing into a planet with enough force to wake the dead is technically a landing, it's not one I'd want to engage in on a regular basis).

2. Venturing into a huge, smoldering crater recently formed by the impact of an object from space may not be the best idea.

3. Junior astronomers keep handguns in the glove compartments of their cars.

4. Helicopter pilots are a great source of smart alecky remarks.

5. Aliens are crafty (and ugly).

6. You can slug a sheriff in Sand Rock County and not get arrested (heck, you can even steal their gun and their car to boot).

7. Prospectors get cranky when they haven't eaten.

8. Living and working in desert climates often makes people weird.

9. Barbara Rush would scream at the drop of a hat.

10. More people are murdered at ninety-two degrees Fahrenheit than any other temperature.

11. Humans will often destroy what they cannot understand.

12. Aliens possess some wicked awesome weaponry, but their targeting skills are sub par.

13. Don't go blabbing about spaceships and aliens if'n you don't have the proof to back up your claims.

I think the two elements that work the best here are the writing and the direction.  While Bradbury wasn't hired to write the final script, enough elements of his original treatment were preserved so that anyone familiar with his writing could easily feel his imprint on the material.  Arnold's direction works extremely well moving the story along at a decent pace, along with generating enough suspense at times to keep viewers glued to the screen.  There's no doubt the aliens look pretty hokey by today's standards, but I have little doubt their appearance on screen back in the day probably produced a few nightmares among some patrons.  As far as the performances, I thought all did very well, especially Carlson as he seemed to pull off his role with relative ease, with Barbara Rush supplying the eye candy.  Her role had considerably less meat to it than Carlson's, but then that was fairly common of female characters in the genre at the time.  There were a couple of minor things that bothered me a little about this film, the first thing being the reluctance of the military or scientific community towards digging up whatever it was that crashed in the desert.  Most were content with the idea it was just a meteor, but still, given its size and from whence it came, wouldn't that generate enough interest to warrant an excavation?  The second is actress Kathleen Hughes aka Betty Von Gerkan (that one heck of a moniker).  She had a bit part in the film, and yet she gets a photo credit at the end of the film, right along with Carlson, Rush, and Drake.  Certainly she was an attractive woman, but since she was only on screen for all of about two minutes, I don't understand how she got the credit she did here unless she was either related to someone, dating someone, or the studio was trying to promote her in the hopes of moving her on to bigger and better things...ah well...regardless, this is a great feature, and required watching for anyone interested in classic science fiction features.

The picture, presented in fullscreen (1.33:1), looks relatively clean and sharp...there are some aging elements present throughout (white specking), but nothing to get worked up over.  The Dolby Digital 3.0 audio comes through crisply, highlighting the extensive usage of Theremin to produce that electronic, far-out, `spacey' sound.  As far as extras, there's an entertaining documentary titled The Universe According to Universal (31:42), an audio commentary track by film historian Tom Weaver, a photo gallery, a theatrical trailer, production notes, cast and crew biographies and filmographies, and subtitles in English, Spanish, and French.

Aimed squarely at the youth market, each of these films run less than an hour and a half, and are brave and spunky as they feature a human race that always survives and is better as a result of the battles with the monsters. Most importantly, each has spectacular special effects by the master, Ray Harryhausen. In the years before computer-generated graphics, monsters were either created by very sophisticated cartoons, or, in the case of Harryhausen, a technique called ""stop action,"" in which models would be shot a frame at a time; natural movement was suggested by moving the figures slowly, frame by frame. This was time-consuming, painstaking arduous, and for non-fans, pretty cheesy.  But the cheesiness is, in a way, more than half the fun. Populated by such grade B through Z performers as Hugh Marlowe, Faith Domergue and William Hopper, these movies are a comfy as a pair of old slippers and a well-worn robe.

554570,4,6303046436,"While not in the class of ""Them"" or ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"", ""It Came From Outer Space"" is close to the top of the 1950's Science Fiction heap. This was only the second film that Jack Arnold directed and his experiments and innovations here would serve him well four years later when he made  his ""Incredible Shrinking Man"" classic.

In this film, Arnold experiments with the genre, not showing his monster until the very end (an unintentionally hilarious scene where Richard Carlson recoils in stunned horror despite being warned in advance). This idea works because he also experiments with point of view, showing much of the action from the POV of the monster, with some kind of membrane attached to the camera lens. This is interesting because the viewer immediately begins to identify with the monster, even though the monster does not speak until later and there is no attempt to do a voice-over of its thoughts.

It is always interesting to watch a ""3D"" movie in just two dimensions because you have to try to imagine the effect. Plus there are scenes that seem strange until you realize that they were constructed and filmed for their ""3D"" effect. For example, at one point Carlson returns home and finds a dust trail that the monster leaves behind. To a rising suspenseful score Carlson opens his closet to reveal the ""horror of horrors""-empty coat hangers. As Carlson opens the door Arnold cuts to a shot from inside the closet looking through the hangers at the horrified Carlson-which must have looked very cool in ""3D"". The monster's theft of his clothes was not an essential plot element but it made for a good effect.

Barbara Rush (who would later play villainess Nora Clavacle on Batman) was a real dish and she gets some good scream queen moments, the best one when a local kid in a spaceman suit surprises her.

554574,4,6303046436,"The great thing about 1950's sci-fi movies is the way in which they took the psychological fallout from the Soviet-USA Cold War confrontation that dominated the decade (paranoia, McCarthyism and the ""Red Scare"", fear of the atomic bomb), and turned it into edgy science fiction that's unlike any present-day moviemaking. Some of these relatively low-budget films were awful, but others have stood the test of time to become classics of the genre. One of the best is 1953's ""It Came From Outer Space"", which features a great plot, solid acting, and is based on a story created by the great Ray Bradbury, one of the best sci-fi writers of his generation.

Richard Carlson - who also starred in another 50s sci-fi classic, ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"" - plays John Putnam, an amateur astronomer and scientist who lives in the desert outside a small town in Arizona. The townsfolk consider John to be a loner and something of an oddball, but he does enjoy the love of Ellen Fields (Barbara Rush), a pretty schoolteacher who thinks he can do no wrong. John's relationship with Ellen has earned him the ire of the town's sheriff (Charles Drake), a down-to-earth, cowboy-type fellow who can't understand Putnam's interest in ""weird"" things like science and astronomy and who wants Ellen for himself. One evening both John and Ellen watch as a huge meteor crashes near an old mine outside of town. The next day they investigate the meteor's crater, but only John makes it to the bottom, where he sees a large spaceship which is promptly buried in a landslide that nearly engulfs him as well. Ellen believes his story, but others are doubtful and laugh at him, and even the local radio station makes fun of him. However, events soon begin to convince even the skeptical sheriff that something odd is afoot, especially when several townspeople begin to act in bizarre ways, such as speaking and behaving in a zombie-like manner and staring directly at the sun for long periods of time. As it turns out, the ""townspeople"" are actually aliens from the buried spaceship, and the real humans have been abducted by them - including Ellen! Although the sheriff and some other townsfolk wish to attack the aliens (out of fear and paranoia), Putnam suspects that the aliens are actually peaceful and only want to repair their spaceship and leave.

I won't give away anymore of the plot, but the storyline of ""It Came From Outer Space"" is decades ahead of its time, and strongly resembles modern sci-fi (such as ""Star Trek"") in showing that even strange ""aliens"" are not always hostile and can be peaceful if given a chance. This attitude comes directly from the stories of Ray Bradbury (for example, ""The Martian Chronicles""), in which aliens aren't always the bad guys and humans aren't always the good guys. It's this moral complexity that makes ""It Came From Outer Space"" stand out from the other (and often more simplistic) sci-fi films of the decade. As an added bonus, the DVD set of this film will be a delight to all fifties sci-fi movie buffs. It has a short documentary entitled ""The Universe According to Universal"" showing how ""It Came From Outer Space"" and other fifties sci-fi movies were made, the theatrical trailer, and a commentary by film historian Tom Weaver. Overall, this DVD set is well worth the money, IMO. Recommended!",1080950400,243,3334,4.837127845884413

554576,4,6303046436,"1953's IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE is often touted as the first of the 1950s sci-fi films to depict extraterrestrials as intrinsically benevolent, but that distinction actually belongs to 1951's THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL.  Nonetheless, IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE is still a rarity in that it was one of the few McCarthy-era Hollywood space operas that did not use invading aliens as allegory for the evils of communism.  (Alas, the extraterrestrials are still bug-eyed monsters.)
The plot revolves around John Putnam, an amateur astronomer who is eyewitness to what he initially believes to be a meteor crash in the Arizona desert.  However, when he and his girlfriend, Ellen Fields, go to investigate, they discover that there is a large extraterrestrial vehicle buried at the bottom of the impact crater.  No one from the nearby town will initially believe Putnam or Fields, of course, but when strange events start happening around town and in the surrounding desert, the local sheriff and his posse decide there might actually be something to the spaceship story and head out to confront the aliens (referred to as Xenomorphs).  Putnam makes contact with the aliens first, however, and they convince him that their visit to Earth was an accident and all they want to do is repair their vehicle and leave.  They explain to Putnam that they are isolationists and do not want to make further contact with the people of Earth, and they therefore ask him to intercept and stave off the approaching posse until the spaceship is ready to depart.  But if he is unsuccessful and the posse gets through, Putnam is warned, the future existence of the Earth and its inhabitants will be in jeopardy.
Although the script for IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE is based on a short story by Ray Bradbury--that venerated and prolific American writer whose science-fiction and fantasy stories have been the fodder for innumerable movies and TV shows--it is not quite as literate or as deep as THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL.  But like the other film, IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE also has a strong subtextual message, to wit, it is wrong to prejudge or reject others simply because they are physically or culturally different.  As mentioned, the film was created and released in the years of McCarthyist paranoia and anti-communist fervor in the U.S., so it was pretty bold at that time to disseminate a message of intercultural or political tolerance.  (Then again, science-fiction has a long tradition of using the guise of fantasy to address controversial and disputatious social and political issues without invoking the wrath of the powers that be.)
The movie's director is Jack Arnold--who would the next year direct THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON, the eponymous character of which was the last to earn a spot in Universal's classic-monster pantheon--and he does a fantastic job of creating the cold and eerie atmosphere required for the story.  The cast is also pretty good. As John Putnam, Richard Carlson--also to later be a part of THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON--is not the most dashing of leading men, but he actually fits the role of science nerd quite adequately.  The comely Barbara Rush, who plays Ellen Fields, makes a beautiful heroine-in-distress, and buxom Kathleen Hughes is also delight to watch (albeit her acting is marginal and her role a minor one).  Ardent fans of classic TV will also get a kick out of seeing Russell Johnson in an early role.  Johnson would go on to gain great fame in the 1960s playing the Professor on TV's GILLIGAN'S ISLAND, but here he portrays a telephone lineman whose mind is temporarily taken over by the extraterrestrials.
There have been rumors that the movie was filmed in widescreen, this in spite of the fact that its filmed aspect ratio is 1.37:1 (essentially, the standard 1.33:1).  Some rumors address the aspect-ratio question by insisting that, like Orson Welles' TOUCH OF EVIL, the frame layouts were arranged in such a way that the film could later be matted top and bottom and projected as widescreen.  Unlike with TOUCH OF EVIL, however, there is no cogent evidence to support this theory.
It is true, though, that IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE was filmed in 3-D, but it has not been released as such for home video.  It works very well even without the 3-D effects, so don't let the lack of 3-D deter you from buying the film.  If you ever get a chance to see it in 3-D, though, do it!  There are lots of entertaining details that play wonderfully in 3-D, and it adds just a bit of flair to the viewing experience.
So overall, IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE is a surprisingly entertaining movie that stands out above the typical 1950s space-opera schlock, and it certainly deserves a spot in the collection of any science-fiction fan or lover of classic Hollywood movies.  Universal's DVD release offers a few cool extras, not the least of which is an interesting feature commentary by film historian Tom Weaver.  Well worth the price of admission.",1068595200,3,4984,4.846878680800942

554668,4,6303046436,"I love old movies. They are an entertaining glimpse into who we thought we were filtered through a fun house history mirror. It Came From Outer Space was a great movie when I was a kid. Like The Day The Earth Stood Still Bradbury's original film treatment focused on character and suspense at the expense of bug eyed monsters. The final film (changed from the original conception of Bradbury and director Jack Arnold) does have the BEMs but, luckily, Universal didn't evisorate the characters and thought provoking plot that drove the film.
Amateur astronomer John Putnam (the reliable and stoic Richard Carlson)witnesses what he believes to be a meteor striking the desolate desert surrounded his small town. It turns out to be -- surprise!--alien's with a major blow out that has incapacitated their space ship. These Xenomorphs begin to kidnap the locals and replacing them so that they can get the materials to repair their ship and keep a lid Carlson's wild story about their arrival.
Jack Arnold's subtle direction works wonders with the budget and the 3-D format. He manages to create a film that has aged exceedingly well. Bradbury's original concept is mostly intact as well. In fact, it sounds like screenwriter Harry Essex may have incorporated dialog from Bradbury's treatment largely intact during a number of important scenes.
It benefits from being create in the wake of The Day The Earth Stood Still and it also benefits from its unusual setting (the Desert). Sadly, I can't wholeheartedly recommend this DVD. Universal has done a great job of restoring this classic film. Unfortunately, they don't offer the option of viewing it in 3-D. That's a pity as Arnold made effective use of the gimmick using a number of subtle tricks (and a couple of dramatic ones as well) to artfully blend the 3-D format with the narrative of the film. Since It is presented on a dual layer disc, I'm surprised that Universal didn't figure out a way to present the film in it's element. Unfortunately, some of the film's most powerful sequences suffer from the flat presentation here. Given the extra effort that went into the restoration and the extras, it's a pity that Universal didn't go the extra mile and present this fine film in the format it worked best in.
The extras including the documentary (The Universe According to Universal)includes interviews with illustrator/collector Vincent Di Fate, film historians and collectors (such as Bob Burns). All discuss the circumstances around the making of the film as well as the impact it had when it was presented in its original format. Additionally, they bring up the little known fact that the creatures were never seen in the original cut that Jack Arnold prepared. Universal executives went back and took reshot a couple of sequences with shots of the aliens. While this doesn't work against the film, it would have been much more powerful with the aliens presence only suggested via Arnold's idea of showing the alien-human encounters from the alien's point of view.
The photograph and poster gallery is interesting but hardly essential and the production notes informative about the cast and Arnold. The documentary will probably show up in a number of variations on other Universal science fiction and horror thrillers coming to DVD. Perhaps This Island Earth (Universal's attempt to make a picture on the scale of MGM's Forbidden Planet)will eventually be re-released to DVD with the same care. A bit of trivia on This Island Earth--Jack Arnold isn't credited but he directed many of the scenes involving the aliens and their world.
Regardless of this reissues shortcomings, It is an impressive package for the most part. It's a pity that Universal missed their opportunity to reissue this minor classic the right way the first time on DVD.",1047686400,24,3799,5.003159557661927

554670,4,6303046436,"One night astronomer John Putnam (Richard Carlson from ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"") is watching the night skies when he sees a flash in the desert night sky.  Dragging the pretty Ellen Fields (Barbara Rush from ""When Worlds Collide"") with him, he goes off to investigate what he thinks is a meteor.  But what he discovers at the bottom of the creater is not a giant meteor but a space ship composed of glowing hexagons.  Of course, back in town nobody will believe him, not even Sheriff Matt Warren (Charles Drake) who also likes Ellen.  But then people start wandering around town in zombie-like trances and our heroic astronomer starts to figure out that there is an alien invasion taking place in his little town, which means the little love triangle here need to be put on hold.
""It Came From Outer Space"" was one of the first 3-D films (you can easily guess what parts were directed out at the audience) and provides a nice mix of cheesy horror effects with eerie sci fi music.  The original story is by Ray Bradbury and has all the earmarks of a pulp magazine alien invasion story.  Of course, this was a period when UFO sightings were starting to be covered in the press as well.  The story has a strong resemblance to ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" but remember that this 1953 film came out three years earlier and if you are looking for elements of paranoia about the Commies the subtext is a lot stronger in this film.  Also, the recent film ""Evolution"" clearly uses this Fifties Science Fiction classic for its basic framework.  Director Jack Arnold was one of the kings of Fifties ""B"" films having done not only ""It Came From Outer Space,"" but ""Creature From the Black Lagoon,"" ""Tarantula,"" and ""The Incredible Shrinking Man,"" all of which are films you need to screen at some point as you learn all about the roots of contemporary science fiction.",1034812800,37,1868,4.636363636363637

This latest digital transfer DVD series is fantastic with the best quality picture & sound.  The Scifi of the 1950's was more philosophical and less graphical in the violence.
In Summary:  An amateur astronomer (Richard Carlson) & his fiancee (Barbara Rush) witness a meteorite impact in the the desert near his cottage.  They investigate the crash site and he discovers an alien spaceship at the base of the newly made crater.  How will man react to this UFO event?  It turns out that this spacecraft landed here on earth to make repairs.  (ET storyline of the 50's).  Man over reacts and the aliens perform cameleon like forms to seek repair parts.

The main characters are all very believable, and the star, Richard Carlson, does his usual fine job.  The plot is more mature than your usual 1950's sci-fi alien movie.  About the DVD: the picture quality is slightly better than its VHS cousin, and the bonus features are mildly entertaining.  Film historian Tom Weaver provides audio commentary during the movie.

554674,4,6303046436,"It Came From Outer Space is one of the better films brought to life in the golden age of science fiction.  It is not an alien invasion story; rather, it develops and explores the ambivalence of man's own scientific progress in regards to the unknown.  The aliens are not Martians; they are quite un-E.T.-like ""monsters"" who hide themselves.  They seem to know one of the tragic secrets of humanity--it very often hates and destroys that which it does not understand.  The story starts with amateur astronomer John Putnam (Richard Carlson) and his fiance Ellen Fields (Barbara Rush) looking at the stars and engaging in some lovey-dovey conversation; suddenly, a giant fireball goes sailing across the sky and strikes the earth with a terrific impact.  Putnam and Fields rush to the site via helicopter, and Putnam goes down into the crater to examine the ""meteorite.""  He finds a ship lodged in the ground and senses a presence there; before he can peer into the ship's interior, the door closes and a landslide covers everything up.  Putnam fearlessly tells the authorities what he saw and is, of course, laughed at.  The sheriff, who obviously has the hots for Ellen, is particularly hard to convince.  Eventually, some townspeople disappear and, even more mysteriously, reappear with whole new personalities (or lack thereof).  The resolution of the movie has a philosophical aspect to it; there are no bad guys and no good guys, and one is left to ponder the real standing of Earth and society in a universe in which alien life does exist.  This thought-provoking movie is based on a story by Ray Bradbury, which does much to explain its success.  Some viewers may also be interested to know that Darrell Russell (the Professor from Gilligan's Island) has a co-starring role in the picture.
In its theatrical release, this movie was shown in 3-D, and it is unfortunate that today's viewers cannot enjoy it in its original format.  However, it is the story and not the special effects that makes this movie a success.  While its themes do not captivate modern audiences the way they did viewers in the 1950s, the movie retains a moral clarity and vision that distinguishes it from most science fiction movies of its era.  It asks the viewer to trade places with the aliens and consider how things would look if he were the outsider arriving in a foreign land, which is a refreshing theme to emerge in a Cold War American motion picture.",1024704000,,2439,4.829326923076923

The story is, by today's standards, typical for the 1950's science fiction film.  Handsome, rugged scientist (Richard Carlson of Creature From The Black Lagoon fame) and beautiful girlfriend (Barbara Rush) witness a meteor crashing to ground in the Arizona desert, only to learn it is a spacecraft from another world.  No one believes them until people begin to disappear, and later return as almost robotic zombies.  But this story was based on a Ray Bradburry short story, and that story, combined with wonderful script writing, takes this from a bland sci-fi popcorn muncher to a thinking man's (at least on the B-grade movie level) story of paranoia and terror that ultimately shows the weaknesses, and the strenths, in humankind.
What most young people today don't realize is that this film was a first of many kinds.  It was the first science fiction movie to portray aliens as anything but blood thirsty.  It was the first of the desert sci-fi films.  It was one of the first films to use the theremin for the eerie, wavering, electronic music we all associate with science fiction films from that era.  It's the first time a movie used the perspective of the ""monster"", by letting us see through its cyclopian eye.
The lonely desert landscapes are almost alien in themselves, sweeping and harsh, and seen many times in the long shadows and gray light of dusk.  The soundtrack is mono that has been encoded to stereo, which sound wonderful on a home stereo system.  The acting is top notch, and the special effects, though dated, have that comic book Buck Roger's feel that was bigger than life in the 1950's.
The extras here are nice, as well.  There's a really nice documentary about the movie and a few other films in the same genre.  There's a audio commentary with film historian Tom Weaver.  There also a nice photograph and poster gallery, as well as the theatrical trailer, production notes, and a brief cast and filmakers section.
The only reason I don't give this DVD five STARS is because they didn't include a 3-D version of the movie.  Maybe that's asking too much for the ... price tag, but darnit, Univeral has been so commited to releasing wonderful horror and sci-fi gems to DVD in wonderfully restored condition, that I can't help but wonder why it was decided not to offer this rare and exciting way of viewing the movie.

554743,3,6303046436,"Ray Bradbury pens passable '50s sci-fi fare, but it's not what everyone cracks it up to be. The movie is more fun than actually good, but definitely worth a watch.
B-movie vet Richard Carlson has his not-quite-love-match with the always wonderful Barbara Rush interrupted by a flaming meteorite, near his gorgeous desert home. Faster than he can light a pipe and don a houndstooth jacket, professorly Carlson goes out to investigate. The thing is too hot to approach - and big, too.
But that's hardly the greatest of his worries. Before long, many of the townsfolk are acting unusually, and Carlson finds his tracks dogged by these zombie doppelgangers of their former selves (including the Professor from Gilligan's Island, Russell Johnson, himself). He figures out that the meteorite was actually a crashing space ship, and eventually manages to meet face-to-face with...well, a pretty horrible 3-D thing, living with its buddies in a nearby abandoned mine shaft. The aliens really aren't all that friendly - they're just not hostile, eager to get their ship repaired with their rented zombie-human space-car mechanics and escape this backward berg. The usual ""Earthling, Beware!"" zany hijinks ensue.
This is not a great movie. But it is a good one. The cast is good, the script adequate. The special effects aren't great, but they are at least interesting, and the atmosphere is pretty spooky.

I rate ICFOS equal first with 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' and 'The Blob'. What great movies!

554746,4,6303046436,"In the 1970s I had the privledge of seeing IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE on the big screen in its original 3D format, and as such it was a visually fascinating film. But like all 3D films, IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE suffers in the translation from big screen 3D format to a standard television screen: the special effects, which seemed so spectacular in 3D, seem only so-so. And that is truly regrettable, for in its original format IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE is a classic of 1950s science-fiction.

The story, created by Bradbury, concerns an amateur astronomer who discovers that aliens have crashlanded in the desert--but no one will believe him. Although the basic premise has been done to death, at the time OUTER SPACE was released it was still fresh, and Bradbury gives the tale an unusual spin that lifts it out of the realm of later 1950s and 1960s teenybopper flicks. But shorn of its 3D effects, the film lacks impact, and the creatures that were so impressive on the big screen become literal and slightly silly. Viewers who have never seen the film in its original 3D will be apt to wonder what all the fuss is about.

And this poses a question. Why can't we have 3D films--a roster that includes THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON, Vincent Price's WAX MUSEUM, and IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE--on tape or DVD in their original format? Admittedly the glasses are cumbersome, and there might be some issues about including them in the package, but other (and considerably less interesting) films have been released to video in 3D; why not the great classics, so we can see them as they were intended to be seen--and enjoy such films as IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE to their fullest? The original 3D version deserves a five-star rating, but in flat presentation it is worthy of only a three. I'm splitting the difference.

Ah,classic 50's dialogue. The man who delivers that line is refering to Richard Carlson who plays the lead in this film. He does a good job as the man whose story no one will believe. The part of his girlfriend is played by Barbara Rush. Even in her one-dimensional role,as the one person who DOES believe him,she really stole the show. Shes very likeable as his dedicated girlfriend(and a cutie patootie besides)and provides some of the films best laughs as she screams at everything she encounters including a boy wearing an astronauts helmet,the professor from Gilligans Island,and even a tree!!
The films desert and cave sets are very well detailed and the aliens are cool looking in a bizarre way(they have one eye that protrudes to make the most of the 3D that the movie was originally filmed in).Most of the spfx are fair except for a few scenes which were exceptional for the time period.
All in all this is a very satisfying picture and a great example of all the things that made this genre so entertaining. The movie is well paced and the film-makers do an exceptional job of introducing all the characters and setting up the conflicts in the first 20 minutes.
