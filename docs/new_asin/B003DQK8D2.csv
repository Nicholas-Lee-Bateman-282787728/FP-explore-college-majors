8394877,3,B003DQK8D2,"First let me start with a request to Mark to make more instructinal DVDs!  This guy has it all, the talent, the personality, the means to produce a quality product, etc.  The problem with this DVD is it tries to cover so much material that there is no real depth to any of them.  He spends more time on some topics than others, and not surprisingly, these are the strengths of the DVD.  If you're a rank beginner at recording drums, you'll learn some valuable tips on how to set up mics.  If you've never tried to chart a song, you'll see his way in action.  But all the other topics are given such a superficial coverage that it's just .....fluff.  Signal paths, drum tunings, playing techniques, track editing....each get some attention but not much.  To be fair, the title of the DVD is accurate.  You get to see just a tiny bit of so many of the elements that happen during a recording session.  If you're primarily a curious spectator, this DVD will deliver.  If instead, you're hoping to learn some important new methods, you'll probably be (at least partially) disappointed.  Just be aware of what this particular DVD is, and what it isn't.  Having said THAT, I bet Mark could produce SEVERAL in-depth instructional DVDs on several topics, including his views on audio-production and engineering quality drum tracks, playing techniques etc.  Though I was a bit disappointed in this particular DVD, if Mark ever releases another more detailed product, I'll buy it.  He's that good.",1296000000,3,1487,4.7315175097276265
8394878,4,B003DQK8D2,"I highly recommend that you get some knowledge about recording, because Mark does not stop at all to tell you what each thing he talks about is. He already assumes that you know it. But, past the engineering stuff, Mark really gives some solid advice on micing your drum set and the different options. And he does it in a funny matter, too! I recommend his advice to many. He gives some pretty good tips on preparing for gigs and more. This is not something that should be in a drummer's essential list but I do recommend that you check it out!",1289865600,,544,4.3431372549019605
8394879,3,B003DQK8D2,"This DVD tries to touch on many areas of drumming, and while it does cover many aspects of the recording process, it does not get into enough detail in any one area for this to be a great DVD.  If you're inexperienced with tuning drums, there is a good section in here, but I would recommend Bob Gatzen's  DVD, which is entirely focused on tuning drums.  The best part about this DVD is seeing how Mark charts out a tune.  Sure, there are a million different ways to do this, but mark's version is very concise, easy to follow, and takes very little time.  If you have and extra 20 dollars, I'd still buy this DVD.  THERE IS SOMETHING YOU WILL LEARN! Just don't expect to be able to make professional drum tracks in your studio after watching this DVD",1275782400,4,751,4.328571428571428
