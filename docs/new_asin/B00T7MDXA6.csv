I could leave it on all day so that whenever I look up, there it will be. Of course, the soundtrack is one of the bests of all time. This Blu Ray is REGION 2. Dont think it might play on your high dollar Blu Ray player.  IT WILL NOT, unless it specifies Region 2.",1534464000,,419,3.9176470588235293
8700858,3,B00T7MDXA6,"I have LOVED this movie since I first saw it all those years ago!!! However, I bought a copy from Amazon Global Store UK, and it DOES NOT WORK IN THE US!!!!  I even tried it on my computer, but got an error message that the Region is fixed to Western Europe, Japan, and South Africa.  Amazon KNOWS I live in New Jersey, USA!!! Hello???  SO DISAPPOINTED!!!  I would have given 0 stars if I could, but the movie is just SO GOOD, i didn't have the heart to do it!!",1532304000,,461,4.032967032967033
8700859,5,B00T7MDXA6,"But cinema has a habit of folding back on itself; this week sees the reissue of one of those imperishable 1960s films, Far From the Madding Crowd, an adaptation of the Thomas Hardy novel, in which Stamp plays the coldly raffish Sergeant Troy opposite Julie Christies Bathsheba. Spruced-up and spring-cleaned, and just less than half a century old, Far From the Madding Crowd is something else: they really don't make them like this any more. Almost three hours long, smeared with mud and sheep dung in its grimly realistic recreation of early 19th-century Dorset, and benefiting from performances from actors at the top of their games, it glows on the screen exactly the way it must have when first released in 1967. At the time, however, it was considered a disaster: poor reviews, especially in the US, and a general inability to see past the with-it celebrity personas of Stamp and Christie, translated into underwhelming box-office and a severe career misstep for its director, John Schlesinger.

A quote from a recent Guardian profile of Terence Stamp.

OF COURSE THE VERDICT IS NOW IN - IT IS ONE OF THE GREATEST SCREEN ADAPTATIONS OF ALL TIME AND - AS ITS REISSUE PROVES - CAN BE ENJOYED AT ALL TIMES.

Is this because of the scale of acting here, or the sheer ambition of the film studios and directors then, or all of these?",1499558400,,1333,4.737068965517241
8700860,4,B00T7MDXA6,"Far From the Madding Crowd is John Schlesingers adaptation of Thomas Hardys famous novel. This film is beautifully shot and you will come across some of the most enchanting landscapes that you have ever seen. Nichols Roeg captures some of the best locales in the United Kingdom with his cinematography work. Julie Christie plays Bathsheba Everdeen and she is a feminist protagonist who is bent on playing around with the feelings of three men who fall for her and teasing them. Schlesinger captures the relationship between the people and their land and their farms quite nicely. The English countryside never looked so glorious. Richard Rodney Bennett has written a good music score and you can easily get impressed with the suite of themes composed for this film. Before I saw this film, I expected Alan Bates as Gabriel to steal the scenes but by the time the film was over, it was Peter Finch as William Boldwood and his brooding obsession over Bathsheba that impressed me the most.",1456704000,,986,4.875
