5581596,5,B00BDSRM4K,"Bonnie fine PI mystery. Bonnie -not wee, as EACH story is over 3 hrs. 16+ hrs total. Ian Carmichael as Lord Peter Wimsey plays a perfect 1920/30s gentleman emitting proper pomp and finesse. Glyn Houston is gentleman's gentleman. Bunter is Watson-like in investigations, a chef, and spiffy as any Brit butler. View a parade of fine period vehicles.

SDH SUBTITLES available while enjoying English and Scot dialects. Scenery is wonderful, costumes perfection. A period delight in all ways. The BBC adapted Dorothy L. Sayers' Wimsey novels spot on, thank you.

CLOUDS OF WITNESS -book published 1926
Wimsey's vacation interrupted by his brother's, Duke of Denver, murder trial. A dispute was followed by a man being killed by Gerald's gun. The Duke has no explanation for his action and time. Wimsey investigates clues and changing facts. Lies? Secrets? Who has motive? It's a family affair of trouble. Delightful costumes and interior sets.

THE UNPLEASANTNESS AT THE BELLONA CLUB -book published 1928
Can this investigation get more complicated? A respected Bellona member dies in the reading room. A sister the same day. Wimsey is called to verify a death time needed for an inheritance issue. Poison? Just the beginning of complicated discoveries. Watch for Phyllida Law.

MURDER MUST ADVERTISE -book published 1933
Ad copywriter, Dean, associated with wealthy drug user group. Was his spiral staircase death fall accidental? Sister Pamela (Gwen Taylor-""A Bit of a Do"") says he's clean. How`s Maj Milligan (Peter Bowles- ""Lytton's Diary"") connected? An annoying over-played blonde actress in this story, but bang-on good. Book-true, a surprise, uncommon, satisfying end.

FIVE RED HERRINGS -book published 1931
Wimsey discovers Bunter's art hobby on a Galway train. Holiday time in a fishing area frequented by artists. Campbell is ejected from a golf club leading to a pub fight. While fishing near an abandoned easel, a body is discovered. Vacation ends. Enough art suspects to fill the Glasgow Gallery. 1 killer and `five red herrings' near Kirkcudbright in 1931. Dramatizes early police times as PI Wimsey, appoints himself to investigate, contaminates scene & evidence. Wonderful landscape film artistry.

THE NINE TAILORS -book published 1934
Most anticipated Sayers story adaptation. The title refers to church bells being rung 9 times for the old year, or for a man's death. c1914 in Fenchurch St. Paul, emeralds were stolen. Maj. Wimsey's WWI bunker's hit. He's pulled to safety by Sgt. Bunter in 1918. c1924, Wimsey and now-butler Bunter have a car accident outside Fenchurch St. Paul. Wimsey rings bell for New Year Peal. c1930s, a hand-less body drives Wimsey's search for emeralds. A mystery consuming decades.

5581597,4,B00BDSRM4K,"Dorothy Sayers created a rather unusual sleuth in Lord Peter Wimsey -- think Bertie Wooster, except with a formidable crime-solving brain, a haunted past and a tendency to stumble across murders. And ""Lord Peter Wimsey Mysteries: Complete Collection"" brings together all of the solid BBC adaptations of her works starring Ian Carmichael, which are hampered mainly by the fact that the cast is a bit old for their roles.

In ""Clouds of Witness"" Peter is on vacation when he finds out that his brother, The Duke of Denver (informally ""Gerald""), is on trial for murder -- he had a blowup with his sister Mary's fiancee, Denis Cathcart, and the next morning, Cathcart was found shot through the heart by Gerald's gun, with Gerald bending over the body. The Duke stubbornly refuses to explain why he was out in the rain at three in the morning. Now Peter must unravel a mass of lies, secrets and red herrings, and figure out who truly killed Cathcart.

""The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club"" happens while Peter is lunching with his mentally fragile friend George Fentimen -- elderly General Fentiman expires in his chair. Because the exact time of death is unknown (and the general's sister died at around the same time), it's not clear who the inheritance is going to. And when the body is exhumed and examined, it's found that the old guy was actually poisoned.

""Murder Must Advertise"" when an employee at an advertising agency falls down a spiral staircase and breaks his neck. Using the name ""Death Bredon,"" Lord Peter goes undercover at the agency, and quickly discovers that he has a natural talent for it. He also discovers that the agency is involved somehow in a seedy drug smuggling ring, and has links to an upper-class party crowd. Oh yeah, and there are more murders.

Then in ""Five Red Herrings,"" a fishing/painting vacation to an arty little village in Scotland goes horribly awry. Bunter and Wimsey stumble across the body of Sandy Campbell -- a violent, malicious, verbally-abusive painter who has alienated almost everybody in Galloway -- face-down in the pond. At first it appears to be an accident, but Wimsey soon realizes that it was murder. Now he has to figure out who actually murdered the man everyone wanted to throttle.

And finally, in ""The Nine Tailors"" Wimsey helps out the bellringers at a remote village by helping them ring in the New Year... and of course, a corpse is found the next day. As Wimsey investigates the identity of the mystery man, he discovers that it's connected to stolen emeralds from several years ago -- AND the biggest mystery is not just who killed the man, but HOW.

The BBC did an excellent job preserving the spirit of Dorothy Sayers' classic mystery novels, steeped in the atmosphere of post-World War I England -- gentlemen's clubs, tweed jackets, wood-paneled manorhouses and flapper dresses. There's incisive wit in the dialogue, clever humor (""Every time I get my pay packet, I glow with honest pride!""), and an array of characters including fusty old gentry, office drones, feisty artists to drug-addled flappers.

Even better, these are genuine whodunnits. All three mysteries are tangles of lies, deceptions, infidelities, errors and the occasional bizarre twist such as a Nosferatu-esque man scaring a maidservant into a few grey hairs. In every situation, the solution ends up being wonderfully simple.

Perhaps the biggest problem of the story is that the cast is a bit long in the tooth: Ian Carmichael, Rachel Herbert and Anna Cropper are all at least a decade older than their characters are. It's a bit weird, especially since Carmichael is old enough to be his own character's dad. But despite being in his mid-fifties, Ian Carmichael plays Wimsey with a light, incisive touch and a clever tongue (""I like facts... and there are remarkably few of them in this case""), and he's a likably plausible detective who can be steely when the occasion demands it. Glyn Houston is a warmly jolly Bunter, and he's sorely missed whenever he isn't in one of the stories.

""Lord Peter Wimsey Mysteries: Complete Collection"" has a cast that's a bit old for their roles. But otherwise it's a solid collection of murder mysteries that stick close to the original books.",1362096000,49,4226,4.899300699300699

5581601,5,B00BDSRM4K,"Ian Carmichael plays Lord Peter Wimsey in the Dorothy L. Sayers mystery series that was made for Television.  The film quality is poor, especially on my small DVD player, but for fans of the books or for those interested in the Sayers mysteries still enjoyable to watch.  The DVDs have captioning for the hard of hearing and also helps the American ear with the British accents.  If you have recently read the book, you will notice that small details have been omitted or altered, but the plots and story line stays true to the novels and maintains the integrity of the stories.  I've read the books multiple times so I can't say how a non-reader would react to the plots, but I think anyone would find it entertaining.  Each story has multiple parts and runs over 160 minutes, so you can view it in parts, although I enjoyed watching so much I kept going, viewing three or parts one night and finishing the next.  The period details are very well done and it was interesting to see the monocle worn, or to hear the ""what ho"" sound authentic.  While social mores have changed over time, it was interesting to view how social ills have not.  Highly recommend this DVD set for your library.",1518048000,7,1188,4.544600938967136

I did buy them, do own them, and all the books besides.

I've read them all, and they are the best of the best ... and so say many more than I.  Of all the detectives one ought to get to know, of all one would be privileged to know back here in real life, Lord Peter Wimsey tops the list.  Urbane, witty, much more than meets the eye, unrelenting in love and detection, unassuming in his wealthy privilege, uncommonly beloved by those welcomed in, I would only say, be sure, be absolutely sure, that if you make this purchase and haven't read Gaudy Night or Strong Poison or Whose Body, you won't deprive yourself of Ms. Sayers timeless classics on account of the slightly period effect of these otherwise enjoyable episodes.

I give them 4 stars because there is an Edward Petherbridge series of three books on film that's better, but also newer.  I should like to give nobody 5 stars until Hollywood or PBS or the BBC makes them again and makes them just exactly right.  Very tall order.",1501200000,6,1289,4.436440677966102

I have distant memories of the original broadcasts and was hoping for some of the delight of those first viewings.  The fine acting and writing, settings, costumes, and props would certainly justify a restoration effort if any is possible.

Update. Since writing this review I have replaced my old DVD player with a newer model, Samsung BD-J7500. This unit solves the stretched-format problem by automatically playing programs in their native format (in this case 4:3 with dark bands on both sides). The color in this series is still murky, of course, but the overall  improvement in viewing enjoyment is strong, and I would delete my original  review except that some other customers may need a reminder to modernize their equipment from time to time!

5581721,5,B00BDSRM4K,"I had not watched these since they were broadcast on PBS in the mid-'70s.  I remembered them as being scrumptiously delicious in the manner of the original Anthony Asquith/Michael Redgrave/Joan Greenwood/Dame Edith Evans version of ""The Importance of Being Earnest,"" but I had presumed that my memory was being reviewed through rose-colored glasses, because so very little is actually that good.

But I was wrong.  These were as good as I remembered them, maybe better.  The stories are clever and gripping, the characters sparkle with the weirdness of the British upper-crust of the 1920s, and the acting is very finely nuanced.

Lord Peter is the ever-so-slightly ne'er-do-well scion of an aristocratic family -- his brother is a duke.  His manservant, Bunter, is played by two different actors depending on the mystery -- the one in ""Clouds of Witness,"" ""The Nine Tailors,"" etc., played by Glyn Houston, is my favorite character in the whole thing, and I much prefer him over the rather bland fellow (Derek Newark) who plays Bunter in ""The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club.""

The speech is rapid and the accent is thick -- you have to pay attention and turn the volume up a bit to catch the full richness of the dialogue, but it is very, very rich indeed.  The reproduction is as good as can be expected from something for which the original media is early-'70s videotape.  The theme music runs incessantly through your head, which some might consider a drawback but it's not a bad little ditty.

There are some reviewers here who have expressed the view that this series is boring.  I suppose they are the type who think that ""Transformers"" is the pinnacle of the cinematic arts.  But like baseball, the Lord Peter Wimsey Mysteries are dull only to people with dull minds.",1427414400,2,1778,4.870431893687708

Wimsey, supposedly in his thirties, is played by an actor who's at least fifty. All the other actors are equally far too old for their roles, and all overact to the hilt. The adaptations do stick closely to the plots of the novels, but the series never comes to life. The production values are second-rate. Everything from the sets to the style seems wooden, theatrical, and cramped.

Take a look at the titles that feature Wimsey and Harriet Vane, which are available in a separate collection.  In these Edward Petherbridge plays Wimsey, and I find that I like him better than Ian Carmichael.  And Harriet Walter is just wonderful as Harriet Vane.

Before all of these originally aired on TV (1980's?), I had already read all of the novels.  Now that I've viewed all the videos again, I'm going back to reread the novels.  And perhaps, while I'm at it, I'll look in on the mysteries of Ngaio Marsh (Inspector Roderick Alleyn) and Margery Allingham (Mr. Campion).",1400716800,34,815,4.771428571428571

I ordered this set of DVDs only because I was searching for mysteries after I ran out of the Miss Marple series and the DVD set received many positive reviews.  I hate to rain on the parade!  I can say it isn't an  Agatha Christie mystery, for sure!!  The first movie Cloud of Witnesses is slow with no suspense other than at the conclusion of Part 3, I just wanted to know who killed Captain Denis Cathcart!  The acting, holy mackerel,  it is bad (especially Lady Mary, AKA Polly ).  I have to space the watching for short periods of time because that is all I can take!!!  It is probably just me since so many other reviewers found the movies positive. I like movies to move at a fast clip and this just isn't that.  Perhaps the next movie in the DVD set will be more to my liking but what with the horrible acting on the Cloud of Witnesses, I highly doubt it.",1398729600,6,962,4.2076502732240435

One of the very few exceptions to this revisionist trend was the BBC Lord Peter Wimsey Mysteries with Ian Carmichael in the title role.  Seeing them again was utterly delightful -- mostly because of
the careful adherence to the original novels by Dorothy Sayers.  For more information re. Dorothy Sayers and where she's
coming from, send your search engine out to seek Touchstone Archives: The Making of a Mind which presents a quite
thorough treatise on Miss Sayers' career in several endeavors, and mentions her relationship with C.S.Lewis.  (Not THAT kind

5581789,4,B00BDSRM4K,"I first saw these on Masterpiece Theater in the seventies.  They were good stories then and they are good stories now.  Ian Hamilton's Peter Wimsey is lighter and more eccentric than Edward Petherbridge in the later Wimsey series.

5581791,3,B00BDSRM4K,"Being produced in the 1970's it is not up to the current standards in BBC.  The acting varies in portrayal actor by actor.  Some are superb and some mediocre.  The costumes and sets are extremely beautiful.  The editing on the stories needs work.  It is very wordy and could be shortened.  Perhaps it is filler to make the series longer.  At times, it became tedious and my mind wandered.  Even after having lived in England for a year, I had to strain to hear and understand the dialogue.  Obviously, the sound technology has vastly improved in 40 years.  Characters fade in and out.  Video is grainy and not hd.
In comparison, the scripts were not as interesting as other BBC shows.  If however you are looking for detailed information on how the peerage lived, then this show is for you.  I believe this show should be used as a period piece in the development of British mystery.  It would, however, not be my first choice in viewing.  The exposition is lengthy.  The subtle, English dialogue is difficult for the American viewer..",1389830400,9,1035,4.6353591160221
5581792,5,B00BDSRM4K,Perfectly packaged and produced plus  forty minutes of comment/interview by Mr. Carmichael. This alone is worth the price but the five mysteries are civilized entertainment.,1389225600,2,173,5.92
5581793,5,B00BDSRM4K,"This is a review of five of Dorothy Sayers' superlative mysteries staring Ian Carmichael as Lord Peter Wimsey, Glyn Houston as Bunter, who is Lord Peter Wimsey's gentleman's gentleman, David Langton as the Duke of Denver and Mark Eden as Detective Inspector Parker. It was published in two sets of three discs each. Set One contains two mysteries: Clouds of Witness and The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club and runs for 398 minutes; set Two runs for 604 minutes and contains three mysteries: Murder Must Advertise, Five Red Herrings and The Nine tailors. All five mysteries are intriguing and entertaining; they each lead the reader through an intertwined plot finally emerging at the truth as though they suddenly burst into bright day light.

In Clouds of Witness Peter Lord Wimsey works hard to clear his older brother the Duke of Denver who has been charged with  murder and refuses to divulge the detail of his alibi which could have cleared him. In The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club a prominent club member passes away in a lounge chair in the club on the same day as his sister dies miles away; the exact time of death of each would determine who will inherit a fortune. In Murder Must Advertise Lord Wimsey must solve both a murder and a drug import and marketing operation. In Five Red Herrings Lord Wimsey must find out which of the six artist painters committed the intricate crime; and in The Nine Tailors he must unravel a gnarled trail of events to find the beautiful and valuable Emerald necklace that was stolen and hidden many years ago. It is all beautifully written, the stories are well conceived and the character of each player is fully developed.

The dialogue is engaging and is brilliantly delivered by Ian Carmichael, Glyn Houston, and . Each mystery is a new challenge, that unlocks new doors to the personality of the principals. The mysteries are a joy to watch and deserve close attention. Each mystery is divided into four or five parts. If you find them too long to view in a single sitting you can take a break between parts. You will find them sufficiently intriguing that your early return to them will be assured.

After seeing Mr. Petherbridge's interpretation of the character, with his subtlety and understated performance, I have to say I much prefer Mr. P's characterization.  While watching Strong Poison I tried to imagine Mr. C's performance in the part and truthfully, cannot imagine that he could have given the depth Mr. P gave.  Mr. Carmichael plays Wimsey as almost a silly man.  Mr. Petherbridge plays him with the depth I prefer, including his relationship with Bunter.

This collection has the two dvd's from a previous edition in one box. The cases and dvd's are the same as the previous sets, so if you are looking for a better remaster, this is not it. If you have the previous sets, then you already have these dvd's. The box in the new collection is about a quarter inch thinner (I was hoping for thinner cases), so as a space saver it is not much help. Since I am a fan of purple, I like that. As far as the mysteries, I have seen them all several times and if you are a fan of British mysteries set in the 30's, you will like these. I like Ian Carmichael in these productions. He refused to do the Petheridge set of Wimsey mysteries because he saw himself as too old to do the more romantic Wimseys. Petheridge is excellent as Wimsey in love with Harriet Van but his take is a very different Wimsey - more eccentric. I like them both. I play old dvd's like this on a small blu-ray player with a 9 in. screen and they look fairly good on the stage sets but fair to poor on the outdoor shots.",1376352000,9,1159,4.087719298245614

He is a ""dandy"" who relies on his butler for the heavy work and is pretty blaise about his detection methods. I get the impression that ""Lord"" Peter Whimsey is more into enjoying himself and relating that to the audience than he is in solving the crime. The stories drag on through two or three discs when they could have been boiled down to one with nothing important left out but what I deem to be repetitive conversations. I have had to turn them off out of boredom (how many times can they call each other ""old thing""?) They are also low budget. One or two scenes looked like a toy plane being dangled over a backdrop.

This one, with Ian Carmichael, has Lord Peter as less brooding and more procedural. I agree with another reviewer here on Amazon who said that many of the actors in this series are a bit older than the characters were meant to be in the books, but like that reviewer, I don't think this detracts too much from enjoyment of one of the first and best mystery series that came to PBS. As for the quality of this collection, there is an extra of an interview with Carmichael parceled throughout the DVD's, and it is interesting listening to him talk about the series, and his approach to the character.
