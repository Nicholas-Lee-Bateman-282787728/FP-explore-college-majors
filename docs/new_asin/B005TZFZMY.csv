8486708,5,B005TZFZMY,"A scout for the Dallas Mavericks runs a feeder-school in Senegal in an effort to locate physical talent to send to the United States with the ultimate goal of players going into the NBA,  Shows the culture (poverty) and their hopes to get to the United States. Once there they play at private schools and get looked at by college coaches. Insightful, some elements of faith. Some sub-title.",1460851200,,390,4.735294117647059

8486711,4,B005TZFZMY,"Talk about touched, moved and inspired. Amadou Fall is giving back and changing the trajectory of many lives in Senegal by teaching these young men how to be men and using a tool to get an education.",1366329600,,199,4.405405405405405
8486712,5,B005TZFZMY,"What an inspiring and moving documentary.  I was moved by the journey that the 4 young men embarked on.  They all had a dream and used their ability and hard work to achieve the impossible.  Very moving, I would highly recommend this documentary to basketball fanatics, sports enthusiasts and EVERYONE who has ever dreamed of a better life.  My husband is a teacher/coach and shows this film to many of his students and athletes, what a message it sends!! I appreciate the hard work and incredible dedication the film represents.  The film is a testament that nothing is impossible, dream big - work hard and never quit!  Love it!",1332806400,,630,4.73394495412844
8486713,3,B005TZFZMY,"Nice directing, script and cinematography showing a selected part of everyday life in Senegal. Whether the conditions are worse than was shown was never discussed  and so it's hard to tell from the movie how stable the country is politically and economically. The storyline is essentially the final process of selecting basketball youth with some potential to warrant playing at some higher level. We follow a few players as they travel to the US for high school and hopefully collegiate offers.

The negatives that I noticed are:
(1.) We don't see or is it discussed what percentage of those who devout themselves to the dream actually succeed. What happens with failure.
(2.) We don't see if the middle men receive compensation that might be either ethical or rules violations.
(3.) We don't see how private high schools in the US take advantage of and make money off exchange students. One example, there's a private school in the Seattle area that circumvents the one year visa rules by longterm, years of high school boarding which then gives those students unhindered access to US universities and afterwards automatic US residency. The school's owners are exceedingly wealthy as a result of what they charge the parents of those financially privileged students.",1332115200,,1268,5.091346153846154
8486714,5,B005TZFZMY,"I am a student from Senegal and I have been studying in the U.S. for 1 year and a half. I do not play basketball in college but, watching this movie was like I was watching myself. The story is very touching and inspirational and made me realize again how lucky I am to have parents that can afford to pay me studies in the US. I would recommend every Senegalese to watch it because you will love it!",1330214400,2,400,4.075949367088608
