He goes into detail explaining the different forms that the government requires a company to file and what they are, how to read them, and why you should read them before investing in a company. I found this DVD to be very informative and he teaches you things that the average investor may not know and should know.",1356998400,,408,4.311688311688312
8554859,5,B00ANSB59E,"If you are an investor but never used Edgar before then this video will teach you how to navigate the site and get the SEC filings of publicly traded companies. But even if you used Edgar like me, you can still learn a lot from this video.",1355702400,,239,4.1063829787234045
8554860,5,B00ANSB59E,"I have used Edgar before to access 10-Ks and 10-Qs of companies but I never knew that you could download financial statement in excel. I was always retyping everything. If I watched this video before, I would have known how XBRL could make my life easier. Also, it was kind of neat to see how you can use Edgar to find investment ideas by accessing hedge funds' SEC filings.",1355443200,,374,4.434782608695652
