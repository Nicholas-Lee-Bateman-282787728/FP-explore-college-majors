4011159,5,B002XZ62DO,"I must say that each workout that Debra releases just gets better! I have her 3 previous DVDs and all I love dearly; Lets Get Stepping is my favorite. After doing this DVD, I can honestly say that it's a tie now for my Favorite Debra DVD bwt this one and her Step Aerobics workout. If you are a Leslie Fan or like me, tired of Leslie and her monotonous workouts, this is a must have and a breath of fresh air for any in-home walking program! Debra has an instant hit on her hands with this one! Her laughter and interaction alone with the cast brings a smile to my face and makes me want to put more of myself into the workout.

IMO this DVD is more Intermediate than Beginner and can easily be made Advanced by adding plyometrics and weights gloves/belts. The choreography starts basic and gets more ""complex"" as the DVD progresses. The complexity of the movements is still easy to catch onto and really makes the time fly! My favorite moves being the Tri-Star (not Cathe Friedrich's or Firm's Tri-Star) and the Wedding March. The majority of the moves are low impact but can be made high impact for more of a burn or harder workout. There is no TIFTing in this DVD or in her earlier 3. Her cast is inspiring and fun; Tonya being my personal fav as I can relate to her story which she says in Circle Time. Being a Shapely Girl myself, a size 14, I LOVE having DVDs that I can do with other women that look like me, have been in my shoes, and know my struggles. Just because we may be ""larger"" doesn't mean we are not physically fit or can become so! Circle Time at the end of the DVD is the best yet and it really will speak to so many women. I am healthy at a 14 and I love being able to workout with Debra and DVDs that I find absolutely fun with no DREAD factor what so ever. I looked at the clock at minute 15 and before I knew it, we were onto the AB Section and final stretch!

The Ab section is more about overall core work using a lot of balance and stability moves. This isn't the ""6 Pack Abs"" workout, but it is one that will promote better posture and better overall core function. Some of these moves my Physical Therapist has me doing already. The day after doing the ab section, mind you really focusing on the movements, I could feel my obliques and other muscles were sore. This was not something I had expected from her standing ab routine, and was a welcome surprise. This is a fabulous DVD, better than ANY Leslie DVD IMHO; God I am never going back to that woman's workouts!! With workouts like this there is no need to do the same old and boring 4 basic steps! There is variety galore! Debra is the best and I am so happy that I made another investment with her. She's changed my life and will change yours too. Whether you're a Size 2 or 22, Debra is the perfect instructor. FYI for those beginners, if the movements are too tricky at first, as always she mentions to go back to the March and watch and practice. I love how she says ""Quitting is not an option, you can slow down, but you CANNOT quit!""",1251072000,34,3024,4.194158075601375
4011160,5,B002XZ62DO,I purchased this DVD and enjoyed every minute of it.  I'm mostly a Leslie Sansone fan but Debbie's workouts and most definitely this walking workout are a good change of pace.  The toning section is great and I couldn't be happier to see a stanidng ab workout for shapely girls (everyone is not able to get on the floor and do crunches or bicycles)  Debbie's workout are definitely for shapely woman who want to loose weight or just get in shape.  She's God sent.,1250121600,56,463,4.476190476190476
4011161,5,B002XZ62DO,"I received Walking Fit & Fab yesterday and did the workout last night -- woo-hoo, what fun! Debra is extremely encouraging, the music is very motivating, and the workout is fast and energetic!

After about 40 minutes of various walk/step moves, we switch to the ""toning"" which also moves at a brisk pace (side knee lifts, etc.) The toning is followed by another approx. 10-minute fast walk. I didn't think I'd want to walk again after stopping for toning, but the toning moved quickly enough that I didn't feel too ""cooled"" to do another burst of walking. There are about FIVE PRE-MIXES as well, from a 15-minute (or so) walk to just over an hour! I love Leslie Sansone's walking workouts, but she could take a few pointers from Debra Mazda (i.e., the MUSIC, the PRE-MIXES, the VARIETY!)

I really, REALLY like this workout!  :-)",1249948800,45,829,4.703448275862069

4011163,5,B002XZ62DO,"Yes, finally!  A video I can easily follow and actually look forward to using several days per week.  It was fairly easy to get the routine down pat by the second or third time I watched it.  Definitely worth buying.  Plus I appreciate having women on it that actually resemble me and not some 14 year-old cheerleader.  Thanks!",1432771200,2,327,4.568965517241379
4011164,4,B002XZ62DO,"I like the workout -- and after only a couple weeks and two workout videos - the shapely girl system has helped me a lot. This workout is kind of frustrating though because of a ""chapter"" problem. If you want to start with the beginner workout (which is a choice at the menu) you end up with a sudden cutoff and no cool down. I thought it was a mistake the first time - then I tried to skip through the chapters to find the cool down a couple times --- then I gave up.",1431388800,3,468,3.9368421052631577
4011165,2,B002XZ62DO,"I have used other DVD's by Debra and just loved them, but this one was an instant dislike.  Cuing was off and didn't care for some of the moves. Still like and will purchase new videos ( if she ever makes them) but this one just didn't work for me.  Sorry Deb.",1430784000,,260,3.980769230769231

4011168,5,B002XZ62DO,"This is a great workout for shapely girls.  Debra's manner kind of put me off at first, because she's not cheery and chirpy like Leslie Sansone, but I grew to appreciate her style. I love that she and the others on the video are shapely themselves, but if they do these workouts very often, they are also very fit.  Shapely and fit - these are not mutually exclusive.  After the long workout, there is additional abs work, but I haven't done this because the workout, which is almost an hour, is enough for me.  Give it a try!",1422489600,,526,4.336734693877551
4011169,5,B002XZ62DO,"Really enjoy this walking workout. It is so nice as a 300 lb woman to do a workout with heavier girls. Usually thin trainers go a little too quickly. Thankfully, Debra does not. It is best for those who are seriously overweight. I would say about 75+ lbs. It was too easy for me when I was around 200 lbs several years ago. I am trying to lose weight again and think I will stick with her workouts for now.

I like this video because it gives me a lot of steps on my pedometer and seems to emphasize the butt and hip area. It is fun too. Leslie Sansone workouts are good as well but a little monotonous.  This workout has a lot of variations of walking. Side walks, heel digs, walking back and forth, v-steps and many other moves.",1421280000,2,730,4.170212765957447
4011170,2,B002XZ62DO,"As soon as I received this DVD, I popped it in the player and started exercising.  Although some of the movements were unique, the pace was entirely too slow.  If you are a medium or advanced exerciser, this might not be the DVD for you.",1418860800,4,237,4.2444444444444445

4011176,5,B002XZ62DO,"Shapely girl and her crew show us how to walk at home with a lot of fun. Although for beginners, there are a few heart pounding and temperature raising sessions on this DVD.  Good for someone who wants to begin in home walking or an exercise program on their own. The women are of various ages and sizes; no one will feel intimidated!",1403395200,2,334,4.301587301587301

4011178,5,B002XZ62DO,"I honestly thought that this might be a tad on the easy side since all her participants are plus size and she would keep the movements turned down - boy was I wrong!!! This CD was killer!! I have been doing a huge range of the Leslie Sansone DVD's, 3 + miles which all provide a good workout and this was definitely comparable. Debra uses alot of innovative steps and exercises so the workout is never boring and she cues very well. My only caution is that if you have knee issues this may not be the tape for you. Otherwise if you want 45 minutes of solid sweating, then buy this. Also her cooldown/stretch is awesome and goes for atleast 15 mins. It should be a workout in and of itself.",1399939200,6,689,4.2272727272727275
4011179,5,B002XZ62DO,"Debra is motivating and I also really liked the music. The moves are interesting and varied, plus some of them challenged me and I did I did master them.

4011181,5,B002XZ62DO,"Debra is so upbeat, and not at all lame.  I like her motivation and reminders throughout the work out.  Encouraging, get's ya movin'.  Some of the workout videos I have used are soooo lame.  Completely not worth using. This one sucked me in right away.",1391990400,,252,4.533333333333333
4011182,3,B002XZ62DO,I have exercised regularly for years but after having 2 broken ankles at the same time I got out of the routine and was nervous about doing anything too vigorous. At 61 years old I thought this might be what I needed to get started exercising  again. I have some of Leslie Sansone's videos but can't stand her stupid chattering and turn off the volume and was hoping this video would be better. It is better in the that respect but I didn't get much of a sweat worked up until near the end. After getting used to the routine I supposed I can add some more vigorous moves to it and get my heart pumping more. I would recommend it for someone just starting out.,1389312000,,659,4.23015873015873
4011183,2,B002XZ62DO,Meh. I found there were lots of times where she was simply marching in place (like for over 2 minutes) and this got really boring. I also didn't like that there were no updates to how far she had taken us so far like Leslie Sansone's videos do. Not sure I'd purchase this again.,1386028800,5,278,4.166666666666667
4011184,5,B002XZ62DO,"This is a great, advanced walking workout dvd.  I really like debra and her girls.  It's nice having bigger girls show they can work out with the skinnies, just as well also.  It's a nice change of pace from Leslie.  It has alot of nice different moves.",1381017600,2,253,4.319148936170213
4011185,5,B002XZ62DO,"I got this video to start working out again and try to lose weight. It's going great! I bought another one of Debra's videos, too. She really tries to motivate you throughout the workout, and her little circle talk at the end is very inspirational. Would definitely recommend to anyone who is struggling to get up and just move!",1379808000,,328,4.576271186440678
4011186,2,B002XZ62DO,"I have three of Debra's other DVD's, but was disappointed with this one.  I started out with the beginner walk.  After 15 minutes it abruptly stops mid step and goes back to menu. I cleaned DVD, but this still occurs so it's the way the DVD was produced.  I don't want to do the Fit workout after the beginner as it starts you out at the beginning again, with another warm up.  I then switch to pre-mixes and chose standing ab workout.  Another warm up, but I do it and then the ab workout which is fine.  But she leaves out quite a few cues.  Also says, ""no arms,"" and proceeds to use her arms.  Then when done, THERE IS NO COOL DOWN.  There is also no option in the menu to just do a cool down.  Very frustrating.  Returning.",1371168000,10,727,4.121428571428571
4011187,4,B002XZ62DO,"Good vigorous DVD and, though I'm not overweight, I'm a psychologist specializing in food and weight issues, so it's very good to see overweight role models for my patients (who often avoid working out due to self-consciousness about body size).

However, as noted by at least a couple of other reviewers, my copy of this DVD also had the same defect of stopping in the middle of one of the workouts. I didn't bother returning it because it seems to be characteristic of replacement DVD's as well (another website selling these had this same repeated complaint).  At least one of the two workouts can be played without a problem, so that's the adaptation I've made.

Please note that my rating is given independent of the technical defect--I wanted to separate the content from the DVD defect.  However, I do think it is worth noting this because there's a very good chance of getting a problem DVD should you order this--caveat emptor!",1370649600,2,936,4.795031055900621

4011196,5,B002XZ62DO,"I have had the privilege this past month to use the ShapelyGirl ""Walking Fit and Fabulous"" workout DVD. Debra Mazda and her Shapely Girl Team really did a wonderful job in keeping me motivated; I really enjoyed this workout DVD. Debra Mazda mentions in her videos that no matter what size you are- even if you've never worked out before - get off that couch and move. At the age of 21 Debra weighed 300+ pounds, was in an abusive relationship, having chronic depression and high blood pressure she took one simple step by joining a health club. While moving her body she improved what she ate. Debra realized that she could inspire other women; she sought the credentials to become a teacher and trainer. She earned a BS in Human Movement and a M.Ed. in Sports Psychology at Temple University. Debra created ShapelyGirl Fitness a motivational fitness program that includes workout DVD's, inspirational CD's and access to an online community ([...]).
When I started the Walking Fit and Fabulous workout I weighed 191.5 pounds I have lost down to 187. My weight goes up and down also due to having thyroid issues.

4011198,2,B002XZ62DO,This workout is pretty good. The problem is that the DVD stops in the middle of the workout and so its usefulness is really limited. I see from at least one other review that the reviewer had the same problem. She exchanged the defective DVD for a new one. It had exactly the same defect...stopped at exactly the same spot.

The best part was the ab section.",1323216000,2,319,4.161290322580645

4011202,4,B002XZ62DO,"I bought this video based on the reccomendations online, particularly those people who said that they had become bored by Leslie Sansone's dependence on her 4 basic moves.  The DVD is to be commended for offering a number of ways to view the exercizes, including a number of ""pre-mixes"".  I chose the 50 minute premix because I usually had been doing LS's 3 mile 40-45 minute walks and figured that 50 minutes would be pretty close.  Once I got over Debra's NY/Philly accent and recognized walker Angel as a model/host from QVC, I got into the exercize. There were a number of new moves to learn, which were fun (the Sashay, the Wedding March, the Starburst), but they weren't explained very well- I think, though, that that is a function of the ""premix"", because presumably if you watched the video from beginning to end in the manner it was filmed, you'd know the steps and not need so much instruction.  The workout took longer for me to break a sweat, but once I did, the sweat just kept coming (particularly with  Debra's ""quick feet"" and ""leg lifts""- they sound innocent, but they will kick your butt).  The cooldown stretch didn't include a stretch or the lower leg, which I certainly could have used after the calf nightmare that is ""quick feet"".  Overall, I'll use this occasionally to supplement my LS taapes, but I'm not replacing them entirely- I like LS, and don't have any propblem with her repetition (plus, I alternate betweeen a number of her workouts with their various ""boosters"", including the stretchy band, the walk belt, the weighted belt, and the hand weights- I never get bored because I'm using them in rotation).

The steps are basic but interesting, not at all intimidating for those new to exercise.  Very safe (but not on carpet and modify the swivel in the side ""wedding"" move if you have bad knees). The cuing is excellent.  The cast follows well and is an inspiration to the real-life average woman (and man).  And, it should be noted that the instructor is mature and has succeeded at weight loss AND maintenance of said weight loss, which greatly adds to her credibility in her target audiences. The emphasis is on a healthy and gradual increase in fitness, which has been proven to greatly decrease risk of death, whatever a person's weight.

Leave it up to Mazda and her team to energize you and keep you motivated to finish this aerobic walking workout. Afterwards, have a healthy breakfast and spend the rest of the day basking in positive self glory because earlier this morning you did what you knew you had to do. Self discipline feeds upon its self and you start to find yourself actually looking forward to the next workout. Before you know it you are losing weight and wanting to eat healthier.

I liked it so much I ordered the tape that incorporates weights which I liked even more.  They're both tough, challenging and quick and the music is great.  I've just ordered her step tape and feel like between the three of them and the occasional Sansone 5 mile tape I'll have it covered.  I work out about 4 time a week and my only complaint is that I wish there was more a serious stretching segment at the end of all the tapes.  The chat segment is good, but once you've watched it, you've watched it.  An additional twenty minute yoga segment would be a great.  I'm sixty six years old, in pretty good shape and  Mazda's no BS working class approach suits me to a T.

If you're listening Debra, more intermediate tapes with more stretching/yoga at the end.  And while I'm at it, a better quality sound track and maybe the addition of an option of ""music only"".  After you've done the tapes for a while, it's all about just getting it done.",1255046400,19,1139,4.3254716981132075

8383948,5,B002XZ62DO,"""Love, love, love this video. Very entertaining and good for the Body movements. The music is good too. Very interesting combinations of moves. This isn't for someone who wants a strong, hard cardio experience. Its good for someone wanting the intermediate range of difficulty. It doesn't make you kill yourself doing reps so that you want to quit. I bought two other videos of hers and tho I like Sansone, I like Mazda better! No, shes not perfect but i just follow along. Im only trying to get my exercise and enjoy it. This dvd does that. It has more variety, more fun moves.""",1482969600,4,579,4.576923076923077

I was able to keep up with the video, sweated like crazy and didn't feel like the chubby middle aged woman I am.  This video was a refreshing change to all of the other ones I have tried over the years.  Highly Recommended!",1479340800,2,349,4.028985507246377

I can and have been doing this since December 2015 and have lost a lot of inches and dress sizes . my weight lost is a struggle but  this helped. Love the workouts and circle time discussion.  Thank you Ms. Debra Mazda ... This was the perfect fit for an obese lady who struggled to reclaim my activity, mobility and peace about myself. Love you Monet",1458691200,4,449,4.385542168674699
8383951,5,B002XZ62DO,"I have used a lot of walking workout dvd's and I have to say, I really like this one.  It's easy to follow and I also sweat more than I do with my other walking workouts.  Debra is very motivating and I felt very encouraged to keep moving.  Plus this particular walking workout is a bit different than others I have done...I like the different steps and movement...I felt like my whole body was getting a workout even though it didn't require the use of light weights.  And there is 5 minute core workout which is easy to do but I think it will be very effective.  I like it and I recommend it...It's a great workout that doesn't require you to leave your house on a cold winter day.",1454198400,2,683,4.223076923076923
