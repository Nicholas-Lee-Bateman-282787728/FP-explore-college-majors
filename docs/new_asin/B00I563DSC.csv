6251195,5,B00I563DSC,"Great blue ray dvd. The price is great for two movies in one blueray dvd set. I enjoyed both movies. Da davinci code was an entertaining movie from the beginning. Its about symbolism. Both movies is about symbolism and somewhat like a history like movie. Da davinci code has alot of events in hunting down a murderer and ending up finding the key to finding the holy grail. Along the movie they find of puzzles and clues. They ended up using their knowledge about what they knew to find what they where looking for.
Angels and demons was a good movie and it was about illuminiti. Its about church and what can i say ""Church."" Its a good movie again with symbolism and finding clues and points in the Vatican city. The time the pope died they are in the process in voting for a new pope in the Vatican city. They are in for clues and a race against time to find the next victim ended up all around the Vatican city. a lot of popes died in different areas in the Vatican city. The map ended up like a cross four points where they killed the church members. The killer had them branded with illumaniti symbols on their bodies when they killed them. The ending was very dramatic with a big bang saving the whole Vatican city from explosion.",1408838400,2,1236,4.354978354978355
6251196,4,B00I563DSC,"The package came earlier than I expected. I originally bought this because I love Tom Hanks and was fed up when UTorrent didn't have it in high quality. Overall, a thrilling movie and a fantastic company selling it.",1400889600,,215,4.684210526315789

6251211,5,B00I563DSC,I have seen the last movie and read the first book. Because I still have to locate the final movie in the trilogy but this has been well worth it. The mystery and history combined makes the movie challenging. You just have to remember that the secret societies and religions discussed in this type of movie does not necessarily reflect current religions and organizations.,1493942400,,372,4.828125

6251232,2,B00I563DSC,"The subtitle shows that BOTH movies have an Ultraviolet and Blu-Ray Disc included. Yes, both titles they both have Blu-Ray Discs. However - the ""Digital Copy"" of Angels and Demons apparently expired on 12/2/10, therefore it's completely unusable! That's a big reason that I bought this set in the first place, is for the digital download of BOTH films! Oh, that and DaVinci Code doesn't have digital download at all... so Angels & Demons code is expired and DaVinci Code has zero digital download. Not happy. They need to change the description of this item as it's seriously inaccurate and misleading.",1485907200,,602,4.97029702970297

6251243,2,B00I563DSC,"Believe it or not, we had not seen either of these films.  They just came out at the wrong time for us (busy job, young children, etc.).  When we saw this release, we figured it was a great way to catch up on some popular culture.  We are not able to compare this to the theatrical release.

At the risk of being overly blunt and brutal, we found this version of The Da Vinci Code to be downright tedious.  We watched it through to the end, hoping that it would get better, but it never did.  Instead, it drug on from one odd turn to the next in a clumsy dog paddle.  It's just flabby.  It doesn't seem that much thought was given as to whether anything added really did anything for the story.

Based upon the popularity of the film, I would like to think that the theatrical cut is much better.  However, considering that only about 26 minutes was added, I have to wonder.  It may just be something of a stinker.

The audio and video are excellent quality, as one would expect from a Blu-Ray version of a ten year old film.

We have not gotten around to watching Angels & Demons.  After trudging through the first film, we are not in much of a hurry to, either.",1482451200,,1163,4.203619909502263
