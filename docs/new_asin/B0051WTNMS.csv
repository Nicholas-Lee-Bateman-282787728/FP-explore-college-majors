8453346,5,B0051WTNMS,"Clasic French acting, atmospheric ; that is, you are there.",1522972800,,59,5.0
8453347,5,B0051WTNMS,I first watched it about 1958. Over the years I have felt it was the funniest comedy I had ever watched. Now I have a copy and can watch it anytime!,1522022400,,148,3.806451612903226
8453348,4,B0051WTNMS,Fernandel is fantastic and the story line is exceptionally clever,1497571200,,65,5.6
8453349,5,B0051WTNMS,Old time is always the best,1466899200,,27,3.6666666666666665
8453350,3,B0051WTNMS,The Sheep Has Five Legs is a poor quality rendition of a good movie.  At times it is so dark it is nearly impossible to view.,1402704000,2,125,3.8076923076923075
8453351,5,B0051WTNMS,"This is a very funny  film.  The premise is outlandish yet everything fits like a charm.  Really, a must see!",1396310400,3,109,4.35
8453352,5,B0051WTNMS,"Fernandel plays all five sons and Father of all in this film.  The sons become estranged from papa and make their own way in life, one writes advice to the lovelorn, another is a famous hairdresser, yet another is the captain of a tramp steamer somewhere in the South Seas.  The town elders want to have a reunion of all five and set off to find them all and convince them to come back for the reunion.  Story lines for each of the sons emerge--this movie is funny and Fernandel proves to be a master comic.",1365811200,,507,4.260416666666667
8453353,4,B0051WTNMS,"Fernandel plays a father and his five quintuplet children.  Their stories are brought together amusingly and/or romantically.  The result is sheer entertainment.  Unfortunately, the subtitles are in white and, when the background is white, they are not easy to read.  Nonetheless, it is amusing to watch and worth watching again.",1353110400,3,329,5.52
8453354,1,B0051WTNMS,"The Sheep has Five Legs - I bought this DVD to replace the one I had recorded several years ago from television. I have to say that my original recording was far superior in both picture and sound quality to the disc I purchased. The picture quality is very fuzzy and the subtitles are unreadable and the sound quality is harsh and distorted. Therefore, I am keeping my own recording. This is one of the best french classics to be had, spoilt by a very poor transfer. NOT recommended!",1339545600,2,484,4.449438202247191
8453355,2,B0051WTNMS,"This is a most disappointing product.  Firstly, the picture quality is not good, and, secondly, the subtitles are frequently printed in white on a white background, thereby rendering them useless.  The actual film, which I first saw many years ago, has, frankly, not improved with age, and I now can only consider it somewhat feeble and overrated.",1312329600,2,347,5.0701754385964914
