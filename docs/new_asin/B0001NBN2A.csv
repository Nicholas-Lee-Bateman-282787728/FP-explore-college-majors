8602792,5,B0001NBN2A,I saw this video online and decided to order it on here. I never got it. So i emailed the guy and he said he was sorry and that he'd send me a new one asap. I waited and waited and waited and i never got it. So i decided to order it just one more time ang gues what... I NEVER FREAKIN GOT IT!!!!!!!!!!!Dont order this video because you probaly won't get it. I've never had this problem before and i'm not baggin on Amazon it's just the guy i ordered it from. I don't remember his screen name but i do remember that it was from one of the guys selling it for between $2.00 and $2.99 and he's still selling the DVD.This is from april 22 2010.

8602793,1,B0001NBN2A,"The title picture is cooler then the actual video, don't be fooled. Not much behind the scenes either..one of the least fav skate videos Ive seen.",1256515200,,146,4.653846153846154
8602794,2,B0001NBN2A,"ok video, no groundbreaking tricks and no real look into the local euro skate scene.  should not have been a stand-alone release but rather a segment of a team video.",1206662400,,166,4.533333333333333
