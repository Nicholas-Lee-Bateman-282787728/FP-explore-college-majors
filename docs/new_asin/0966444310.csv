7793880,2,0966444310,Should be available on DVD. VHS format is a definite low point as not many people still have VHS players.,1412985600,,105,4.3
7793881,4,0966444310,I only do the cardio portion however.  I use Buns and Abs of Steel (Post-Pregnancy) for the floorwork.  I really like the exercises even though they took a few times to get the hang of.  I love the fact that there is no jumping around but lots of variation in steps to keep it interesting.  I began using this video about 1.5 months after delivery and have been using it since (almost 4 months postpartum).  It is not too hard and not too easy which was important for me because I didn't want to get discouraged and quit using it.  I have always had a hard time being motivated to exercise at home--not with this video.  I would like to see other videos by Aileen Sheron.,1015977600,3,671,4.277777777777778
7793882,5,0966444310,"This video is great for new moms.  It has many intensity levels, so you can choose just how far you can go.  I lost 20 pounds over 4 months with it.  I thought they would be on forever after my second baby.  It is upbeat  and motivating without being too corny.  It is hard to believe how long you  have been excercising when it is over.  The stretches feel so good, and the  workout combines aerobics and weight training in three sections, so you can  workout as much or as little as you have time for.  I plan on purchasing  positive prenatal fitness for my next pregnancy, I enjoyed this one so  much.",954374400,29,604,4.238938053097345
