But what is up with the prices listed for this currently in print DVD?

Order it directly from Stefan Grossman's Guitar Workshop for $29.95, or as a direct download for $24.95.

$258.99?!?!?

$541.04?!?!?",1399593600,,302,5.1020408163265305

Tom walks you through a tastey selection of tunes by Charley Patton, Tommy Johnson, Willie brown and Son House in a variety keys (E,A,C, D, open G). TF's teacing is clear and precise; his playing spot on.  Enjoy.",1387670400,,313,4.032258064516129
