8056445,4,B0008O30MI,"This would be a decent double-feature for Laurel & Hardy if their final film, ""Utopia,"" was not so depressing a farewell to the great comedy duo.  ""Utopia"" was originally released in 1952 as ""Atoll K"" and later as ""Escapade"" and ""Robinson Crusoeland,"" and whatever the title finds that an aging Laurel & Hardy have inherited a yacht and an island. The boys set off to see along with a refugee as their cook and a stowaway. The yacht sinks in a storm, but a newly created atoll (hence the original title) emerges from the sea to give them a place to live. They are then joined on their new little island paradise by Suzy Delair as Chrie Lamour, who is running away from a jealous fiance. Together they create their own private little utopia, where everything is just perfect until uranium is discovered and all of the nations of the world begin to battle over ownership of the atoll. Just as the boys are about to be lynched, the atoll sinks back beneath the seas.

Whatever its title, this final film from Laurel & Hardy certainly provides mixed feelings. The political satire angle is ambitious, but scarcely appropriate for comedians who rely so much on visual humor (compare with the Marx Brother's more success effort in a similar comic vein in the classic ""Duck Soup""), although the sequence where Hardy distributes key political posts to everyone but Laurel (he gets to be ""The People"") is pretty good. But most of the sight gags are not typical Laurel & Hardy routines and several people have claimed the best gags were cut from the film (it would be nice to believe that, but I have my doubts).

There is also the shock of the appearance of Stan Laurel, who had been ill before the production from prostate and dysentery, literally looks like he is at death's door. As for Oliver Hardy, he looks distressingly overweight (he would die in 1957 after a series of strokes). The result is that when Oliver slaps Stan or there is any sort of physical routines it is not funny but sad and you cannot help but think that they are going to get hurt. Laurel had an operation during the filming and recovered, living another 15 years. Laurel & Hardy made some stage appearances after this and there was talk about a film with Billy Wilder, but this was the last film appearance for both and Hardy's 426th screen appearance in a career that went all the way back to 1914 (Laurel only made 187 films going back to 1917 and it says something that he never made again once his partner was in ill-health). Consequently, ""Utopia"" is a sad farewell to the screen's greatest comic team.

That makes the other film here superior by default, but it is really a decent offering.  ""The Flying Deuces"" gets its name from the final sequence where Laurel & Hardy escape from a firing squad in an airplane. The boys get in this predicament because Ollie is jilted by his girl friend (Jean Parker) and wants to commit suicide. Despite Stan's more than willing help the attempt fails and the boys end up joining the French Foreign Legion instead. Needless to say, Stan and Ollie are not very good soldiers, hence the appointment with the firing squad. The comedy routines in the film are okay, but there is nothing special. The best moments are the more musical ones, especially a nice soft-shoe routine and Stan playing a prison bedspring like a harp. This 1939 seven-reeler was directed by Edward Sutehrland for RKO and co-stars Charles Middleton, James Finlayson, Reginald Gardiner, Jean Del Val and Clem Wilenchick. One of the writers receiving screenplay credit for ""The Flying Deuces"" was Harry Langdon, the great silent comic who was just a notch below the celebrated triumvirate of Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd.",1118016000,3,3696,4.688751926040061
