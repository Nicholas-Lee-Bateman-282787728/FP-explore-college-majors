8641115,1,B00ID9Q0J0,"I hate it when less than 2 minutes into the film a documentary starts telling lies that are easily verifiable with a quick google search!  When a supposed historical work lies about anything I know they have an agenda and I cannot trust anything they say.
""Preserving the Union was an idea that resonated with northerners in a deep and profound way.""
Give me a break!!!!! The New England states had threatened to secede from the union FOUR TIMES before the South ever did. And the American Anti-Slavery Society said it was the duty of every member to fight for secession from the United States.
They give the impression that the Confederate bombing of Fort Sumter was unprovoked and don't mention that 7 of Lincoln's warships were just outside the harbor. Nor do they mention that the Confederates had promised the commander at Fort Sumter that they WOULD NOT fire on him if he promised not to fire on them! Then they compare Fort Sumter to the Japanese bombing of ""Pearl Harbor"" and the Muslim-extremist terrorist attack of ""9-11."" That is just sick! They sure don't want us to know that the South left the Union peaceably, sent many peace commissioners to Washington D.C. and begged for peace at any price ""save that of honor and
independence."" Too many lies in this film to cover.",1500508800,2,1283,4.702222222222222
8641116,1,B00ID9Q0J0,"The problem, as with Ken Burns' Civil War, is that it does nothing to expose the real motive for the Civil War....the South's advantage of a lowland rail route from Savannah to San Diego, California laid out by Jeff Davis, drooled over by the New England ""China Traders"" ....a synonym for opium importers...as the fastest way to the Golden Crescent and Ottoman....Turkish, Pakistani, Afghanistani, Iranian, Iraqi and Indian poppies.  That it is sponsored by the Smithsonian Channel and that the Smithsonian Institute in 2016 sponsored Edward Bonekemper's presentation of his book Myth Of The Lost Cause: Why The South Fought And Why The North Won which also avoids this logical, face-slapping, but well-avoided fact of history, brings both of these projects little credibility.  ""Sherman believed that to burn a field, to burn a barn, to prevent the South from waging war, would ultimately save life,"" says the program through Peter Carmichael, PhD, in episode 2, ""Confederacy 360"" says nothing about Sherman's work for the railroad in Sacramento and San Francisco, California that would compete with Davis' envisioned route to San Diego, nor that the South's Atlantic terminus of that route was Savannah which Sherman twisted into cork screws to remove the South's advantage.  The smoking gun on the motive for war.....hidden behind the lace curtains of ""state's rights"" or ""abolition of slavery"", was the push to the Golden Crescent's opium to be used as the British had done in enslaving the Chinese.  Suddenly the program's acknowledgement of Britain's supplying the South's armaments is in clearer focus, as is the avoided fact that William Tecumseh Sherman was the pre-Civil War and post-Civil War business partner of Braxton Bragg. No mention is made of Bragg's brother, Thomas Bragg the Attorney General of the Confederacy or that Sherman was working in California with George F. Bragg where he was securing the Union Pacific railhead in San Francisco immediately before his return to sack Vicksburg along with Grenville M. Dodge, the post-Civil War Chief Engineer for the Union Pacific.  It was there in California in 1850 (Thomas Layton, Voyage of the Frolic: New England Merchants and the Opium Trade, Stanford University Press, 1999.  Layton is Professor Emeritus at UC, Chino and son of the U.S. military's chemical warfare division, whose mother died at Jonestown, Guyana, whose sister was Jim Jone's mistress, whose brother was the only American jailed for the murder of California Congressman Leo Ryan whose Congressional aide insisted that that sad chapter was an ""experiment"" not unlike Tuskegee or Pruitt-Igoe, St. Louis, Missouri) that the Heard's opium cutter, built in the Gardner Shipyard, Baltimore Maryland, where Fred Bailey, AKA, Frederick Douglass, had worked before becoming the orator who had spoken against slavery at Boston's Faneuil Hall just as Jeff Davis had done at the invitation of Caleb Cushing....not against slavery....but for it.  Cushing, George Luther Stearns and John Brown's other ""Secret Six"" backers propably controlled the beer and popcorn concessions at Faneuil Hall just at they did with the munitions factories.  The Frolic sank in 1850 at Cabrillo Point near Fort Bragg.....no, not North Carolina.....California....built in 1857!

There's a smoking gun like the smoke from the Brown's Merchant Shot Tower in Baltimore that employed James Hamlet, the first Fugitive Slave Law test case where he worked fashioning Stearn's lead into musket balls.  Here it is..... remembering that Caleb Cushing had negotiated the Wanghia Treaty that displaced the Brits in China.  It is the letter from Jefferson Davis to Franklin Pierce that says.....""WHEN LINCOLN COMES IN HE WILL HAVE BUT TO CONTINUE IN THE PATH OF HIS PREDECESSOR TO INAGURATE A CIVIL WAR AND TO LEAVE A SOI DISANT DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FACT.  GENL. CUSHING WAS HERE LAST WEEK AND WHEN WE PARTED IT SEEMED LIKE TAKING A LAST LEAVE OF A BROTHER."" (Letter from Jeff Davis to Franklin Pierce, Jan. 20, 1861, domiciled at the Jefferson Davis Project, Rice University, Houston Texas, under the oversight of historian, Frank E. Vandiver).

Let the Smithsonian Channel do a documentary on this little factoid and while they are at it, can they get Ken Burns to redo his, too, addressing just why their nearly sainted Shelby Foote in his interview with Brian Lamb on CSPAN at 19 minutes in says ""I consulted no original manuscripts in my histories.  It's all been gone over before.""  Maybe James A Baker, former Secretary of State, can shed light on this apparent well-guarded factoid since Rice University also domiciles the Baker Center for Public Policy and since Baker's family of attorneys were the attorneys for the Union Pacific!  They could bring it forward to Mr. E.H. Harriman and even to Mary Harriman's Cold Spring Harbor project that Edwin Black unpacks in his book WAR AGAINST THE WEAK!  Most of these well-avoided and inconvenient truths have been unpacked by Lowell P. Wigglesworth.

Wigglesworth has reported that he had wanted to ask Vandiver, a virtual walking encyclopedia of Civil War history, why he made nothing of this letter and just what ""soi disant"" means in that context.  Sadly, Vandiver had died in 2005 so he couldn't be asked.  Wigglesworth did the next best thing.  With a copy of the letter in hand he went to the Jeff Davis Project passing Presidential Historian, Douglas Brinkley in the hallway, and in the office of the Jeff Davis letters put a simple question to the editor of the Jefferson Davis Letters, Lynn Lasswell Crist, without revealing his reason for asking.  ""Do you know just how close Jefferson Davis was to Caleb Cushing?  I've read somewhere that they were very close.""  What did she do? She went immediately to the key paragraph and said....""ah, here it is.  They were like brothers.""  ""This was NOT an oversight,"" concluded Wigglesworth.

Furthermore, Wigglesworth has written....""a letter as important as one from Jeff Davis to Franklin Pierce referencing his meeting with Caleb Cushing would be well thought out by Davis.  The words carefully chosen.  In this case, let us look at the French words ""soi"" and ""disant"".  Etymologically these French terms in tandem were used in English from 1752.  John Ruskin used the term in his works in 1860, but its meaning is unmistakable.  It means ""self proclaimed"", ""self styled"", ""would be"", ""calling oneself thus"", ""self-dubbed"", ""trumped up"" or simply ""pretended"".  There was NOTHING ""pretended"" about a Civil War that soldiers fought and died for on whatever grounds they envisioned was their cause.  Here we have the titanium tip of the spike through the dark heart of the real motive for war as envisioned by an unholy triad.....Davis, Pierce and Cushing.  There is no other way of explaining it.""",1463443200,,6821,5.15880217785844

8641119,3,B00ID9Q0J0,"Though interesting, the Smithsonian's determination to look at the purely historical documents, clothing etc can seem not to be truly critical of slavery and is therefore its weakness. The South's side was (is) still very hard for me to feel anything but huge anger and sadness. Yes, the South was economically dependent on slavery but the enormous cruelty to other human beings seems to be avoided here in the South's second of episode of this three part series. I know that, having grown up in the South, its racist ways have rarely left the narrative. I wish this had been a more determined approach - that is, hey, everybody living in the USA, all people are created equal and should have equal rights! Of course, this is meant to only follow our mixed history of finally bringing slavery to its end. However, in the second part which shows the South's situation, it still seems to hark back to the ""good ol' days"" and I feel this particular historical program could have been more incisive and delve into the entire world of racism which the Civil War managed not to stop but to keep festering in our world today.

The Third part (that of the slave) is much more balanced in every way simply because the huge changes and awareness of the blatant cruelty and acceptance of slavery was now affecting all aspects of our country. Strange that the North rid itself of slavery in the early 1800s yet its industries kept it all going in the South where the product of cotton originated and worked by slaves. Money always talks as today's world shows and morality often takes a backseat.",1418860800,3,1584,4.6571428571428575

8641121,5,B00ID9Q0J0,"Ashley Judd, Trace Adkins and Dennis Haysbert lead viewers on a journey 150 years back in time to learn about Americas greatest conflict in a Smithsonian Channel three part documentary, Civil War360, now available on DVD.

The documentary delves deep into the archives of the Smithsonian Institution to explore the war from three differing perspectives.  Ashley Judd hosts part one of the documentary, The Union; Grammy-nominated country singer Trace Adkins follows up with the documentarys second segment, The Confederacy; and Dennis Haysbert heads the documentarys final installment, Fight For Freedom, which traces the African-American experience and view of the war.  Each of the documentarys three hosts have ancestors who were greatly affected by the war. Lincolns Washington at War, narrated by Barry Zate, is included on the DVD as a bonus feature.

Each of the documentarys episodes bring insights and stories of the war to life through dramatic recreations, analysis by a long list of noted Civil War historians and scholars, and the Smithsonian Institutions vast collection of treasured artifacts (including one of Abraham Lincolns stove-pipe hats).

Through its varied perspectives Civil War 360 gives its viewers a panoramic view of the wars events and those who participated in them.  It is a terrific addition to any history lovers video library; it is a perfect introduction to the Civil War to those who are just beginning to learn about the war; and it presents sometimes overlooked stories of the war that students of the war may want to go back and revisit.",1414281600,3,1577,5.238095238095238
