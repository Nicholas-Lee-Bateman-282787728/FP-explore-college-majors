8117253,5,B000F3UAAM,"Very good selection, but the best prison break movie IMHO is unfortunately missing: ""House of Numbers"" with Jack Palance.
""House of Numbers"" is based on a novel by Jack Finney and takes place in San Quentin. Everybody who enjoyed ""Dark Passage"" (Humphrey Bogart) would most likely enjoy ""House of Numbers"".",1335398400,,306,5.14
8117254,5,B000F3UAAM,"Standard old fashion type Hollywood movies and stories w/ predicable endings. However, I can never get enough of 1930' and 1940's movies and especially films involving Prisons and Submarines. I love to watch very old films made during the times before I was born showing old vintage cars, outlandish clothing fashions, interesting small shops and streets and enjoying the old style of acting when actors knew their trade. Comparing these past things to the now-a-day movies which rely on beautiful/hansom actors who, for the most part, have very little acting ability. These modern day things coupled w/ reliance on far too much action and extremely uninteresting (and in some cases unbelievable/unrealistic) screenplays.",1294876800,,721,5.446428571428571
8117255,4,B000F3UAAM,"ST. CLAIR DVD multi-packs are reasonably priced, and offer fine quality video/audio transfers of unrestored public domain material. Discs are single-side recorded, plastic storage cases fairly sturdy, liner notes appear on box's back cover.

Like gangster movies, prison films enjoyed a heyday in the 1930s and '40s. The dozen hour-length B&W examples from that era in the PRISON BREAK CLASSICS movie box set were made by indie studios such as Mercury, Invincible, K.B.S. and Monogram (which would one day become Allied Artists). The stories here are gritty, and the jailed men and women desperate at times. Highlights include:

PRISON BREAK-- Character actor Barton MacLane gets a starring role in the story of a wrongly imprisoned fishing boat captain who protects a friend by confessing to a crime he didn't commit. Ward Bond is excellent as MacLane's nemesis.

THE OUTER GATE-- Known primarily as a western movie supporting player, here Ben Alexander portrays a man framed by his boss for embezzlement. A further complication is Ben is in love with the bad guy's daughter.

THE LAST MILE-- Based on a stageplay. A man, supposedly-innocent-of-murder, arrives on Death Row just before a sadistic inmate instigates a prison break. While he's on the outside, the man's friends try to prove his innocence.

LADY GANGSTER-- A typical yarn of false imprisonment is distinguished by its future-star supporting players: Jackie Gleason (Ralph Kramden on TV's ""The Honeymooners"") and William Hopper (son of gossip columnist Hedda, he would one day portray detective Paul Drake on ""Perry Mason"").
