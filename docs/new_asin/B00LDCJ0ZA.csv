6479928,3,B00LDCJ0ZA,"Russian film with good acting.  The dubbing of the voices was pitiful and so many older actors.  It's hard to picture 80% of Alexander's forces being 65+ yrs old.  Yet, I liked the movie.",1410307200,2,187,4.4411764705882355
6479929,1,B00LDCJ0ZA,Don't waste your money. This movie is a total DUD. It's a low budget Russian film with English dub. I watched it with my roomie for about 10 minutes and had to turn it off.,1410048000,4,172,3.942857142857143

6479941,5,B00LDCJ0ZA,"I'm really interested in the period of history in which this story takes place, and it seems that the director, Igor Kalyonov, did as good a job on the costumes and settings as he did a terrible job on the English dubbing.  This is the same story as ""Alexander Nevsky"", for those who are interested in a very heroic and colorful period of Russia's history with a great victory against foreign (Swedish) invaders,",1422489600,2,412,4.6438356164383565

6479948,1,B00LDCJ0ZA,"Amazon has posted this DVD as being offered in its original Russian language with English subtitles. I believed them, so I'm out of $20. Ouch, as the DVD comes only in one version: dubbed. There are NO other options.

There's nothing wrong with the movie itself. It is well produced, beautifully photographed in amber tones, with a trio of attractive leads. The battle scenes are not overly enhanced by over-the-top CGI, so the proportions of troops in battle are more realistic. The story is quite a complicated set of historic events, probably peppered with some fiction. I've no idea since I'm not familiar with the facts.

My beef is with the lousy DVD treatment this otherwise interesting epic has received. They dubbed it with voices that are similar to those you hear on your GPS. They also have provided the sound effects for background noise, but they did not hire voices for the background cast, so you watch people laughing and making loud comments in the background, but no voices are heard on the soundtrack! On top of that, some of the dubbers can't seem to keep up with the actors on screen: the dubbers stop speaking while the characters onscreen are obviously saying six or seven more words. Unacceptable at best. This is the worst dubbing job I've ever encountered since the old Ursus days of Italian peplum. A vintage Maciste cheapie is better dubbed than this. And I think that is why some people are finding this epic cheaply made. It was not cheaply made; it was simply cheaply dubbed, and it is a great disservice to the original film makers. And a final chuckle: whenever there are titles onscreen apparently stating locales or dates, there are no English subtitles, so unless you can read Cyrillic, you're out of luck.

I am committing to memory the name of this crass company of amateurs, Revolver Films, so I never again buy anything that carries their name.

There's another version of this film for the same price, and ostensibly in the original language, on Blu-Ray and NTSC. It is available elsewhere, but it has NO English subtitles! I guess sometimes you just can't win.",1411862400,6,2103,4.769230769230769
6479949,4,B00LDCJ0ZA,enlightening but the dubbed in voices sound not authentic,1411084800,,57,5.444444444444445
8665333,2,B00LDCJ0ZA,Thought it was going to be in original Russian language - nope it's a dubbed version....  The dubbing is as bad as a Japanese Godzilla movie which ruined it.... poor translations as well....,1514592000,,190,4.757575757575758
8665334,2,B00LDCJ0ZA,Just not a great movie..mostly because of the dubbed in english.,1497916800,,64,4.909090909090909

8665337,5,B00LDCJ0ZA,"This movie is, thankfully, dubbed into English. The dubbing is very good, not hoaky. The film itself is a minor masterpiece, but one shoud view Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky. Eisenstein is considered one of the greatest-directors of all time.",1471737600,,242,5.394736842105263
8665338,3,B00LDCJ0ZA,"As others have written the dubbing of this film leaves much to be desired. They did not even bother to try. It's too bad because this could be a much better film with either subtitles or better dubbing. It has a good, if cliched, plot plus very good pacing. The lead role looks as if he could have some promise, if only he were better dubbed or allowed to stick to Russian. The voices really do not match the bodies or the emotions. The two female costars are especially bad, the voices are too childish and their dialogue clunky at best.

The end fight scene is well choreographed and excellently paced with rousing score in the background. There is a bit of a cliffhanger, but not much with the film providing a journeyman finish that is solid.

A note on the production, it's more than competent. All special effects are done practically which give the film a lot more grit than your typical swords and slashing flicks. Costumes are spot on and the armor and other military fittings seem to be done with care. The Cinematography is sold if not too adventurous.

At cost of a rental, it's not all that bad, it's a good enough popcorn fair if not to be confused with one fore the ages. Personally I could not see owning this film as once you get the gist of the film you can always watch it again, in Russian, on YouTube. A DVD purchase seems out of line unless the DVD is truly subtitled.

Again this is solid film that is unfortunately hobbled by a terrible dub. Knowing the dub is going to be bad from the beginning, and accepting that, will help you actually enjoy the film a little more. If you come in cold, not knowing that the dub is going to suck, it does decrease your enjoyment. The dubbing will help you follow the plot, but it isn't going to be pretty. This film is worth a shot, think of it as radio with moving pictures and you will have more tolerant attitude to the film. It's not the greatest film by a long road, but it is a remainders bin jewel. There are worse offering out there for the $3.99 rental price.",1469059200,,2029,4.331578947368421
8665339,2,B00LDCJ0ZA,"WHY OH WHY THE DUBBING?? It's a good action/period movie otherwise, but they RUINED it!! Why can't they leave the audio alone and just add subtitles? Amazon described it as with English subtitles, not dubbed. Also, the persons doing the dubbing have NO CLUE how to pronounce anything (Names of places, of people, argh!). After watching it in YouTube we were anxious to get a translated version but this is painful. What a shame.",1444262400,,428,4.797297297297297
8665340,1,B00LDCJ0ZA,The acting and screen shooting were awful.  The English dubbing was poorly done as well.,1436400000,,88,4.866666666666666
8665341,1,B00LDCJ0ZA,I don't event know where to begin with this one very different most likely a B rated movie with badly translated audio,1432944000,,118,4.409090909090909
8665342,1,B00LDCJ0ZA,Couldn't get through the first few minutes of it. The English dub over doesn't even approach second or third rate and may be the worst I've ever heard all while overpowering the rest of the soundtrack with how loud it is compared to everything else. It might have been an ok film if the English dub over could be turned off but that the only option for sound there is. Wishing I could get my money back on this one and have it scrubbed from my library.,1430611200,,452,4.206896551724138
