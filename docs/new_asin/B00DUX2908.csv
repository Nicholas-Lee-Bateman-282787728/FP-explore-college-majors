5857177,5,B00DUX2908,A superb way of getting at one of the 20th centuries most important moments in terms of mass media.  Very well done.,1393286400,,116,4.2727272727272725
5857178,4,B00DUX2908,"This is the story of one of the most famous radio broadcasts in history, perhaps the most famous. It is an essential look at a crucial period in Orson Welles' life, the time between his theatrical accomplishments and his later departure for Hollywood. The 1938 broadcast of the play and subsequent controversy would make Welles an overnight celebrity. The film makes for a very good companion piece to the 1996 documentary called The Battle Over Citizen Kane.

The film is well done. I especially appreciated all the old film footage and still photographs. However, I did not much care for the actors who read letters written at the time, though they all did a fine job. In my view, simple voice-overs would have been equally effective, if not more so. Despite that, the film offers a great deal of information regarding a signal event in broadcast history. It is also an important part of the story of the man who would go on to create one of the most influential movies of all time, Citizen Kane.",1392854400,7,998,4.670454545454546
5857179,2,B00DUX2908,"There are a few factual errors here that someone even casually familiar with the event will catch. For instance, the decision to frame the broadcast as a series of news bulletins was part of the idea from the beginning, according to Howard Koch's account of working on the script. The fake-documentary style wasn't adapted only three days before air, as reported here.

What really grated on me, though, were the amateurish recreations of listeners reporting their experiences. These are shot in distressed black and white (like ""News On The March"" footage), but you know instantly that they're contemporary, over-the-top, rather dinner-theatre-ish performances (with one exception at the end), not remotely convincing as period footage. This is in lamentable contrast to the event being celebrated, in which actors like Frank Readick and Ray Collins really managed to sound like non-actors, to sensational effect.",1389052800,11,914,5.436619718309859
5857180,4,B00DUX2908,"This is a DVD about the infamous Orson Wells radio broadcast of War of the Worlds.  There are excerpts from the radio drama, there are recreations of reactions, there is a nice narrative flow.  The focus is on ""why"" people reacted as they did and not so much a presentation of the show.  I found it very interesting.",1387065600,,316,4.413793103448276
5857181,4,B00DUX2908,"The DVD contains the one-hour program plus a few extras.  The extras mostly have to do with the making of the program itself.  I was hoping for more historical extras on the DVD; at the very least a recording of the broadcast.

The program includes dramatizations of comments sent in by listeners at the time.  These are somewhat interesting since they are first-person accounts from people who were seriously frightened by the radio show.  The presentation is a little strange since they are shot as interviews in period dress, on a period-furnished set.  I was a bit confused at first until I realized that they had to be present-day actors.  Some of them chew the scenery a bit, which seems over the top.  I guess not even PBS is immune from the pressure to put these staged re-enactments into documentaries that in former days would only use historical material.

Overall, though, this is still worth watching if you are interested in this episode and/or Orson Welles.",1385942400,,972,4.807228915662651
5857182,4,B00DUX2908,"I first heard Orson Welles' WAR OF THE WORLDS when I was in elementary school.  Even then, I couldn't understand why people thought that the Martian invasion was real.

I watched this PBS AMERICAN EXPERIENCE documentary on Tuesday, October 29, 2013, on Washington, D.C. affiliate WETA - the eve of the 75th Anniversary of the original broadcast on the Columbia Broadcasting System (not ""Service,"" as the documentary claims). I received the DVD on November 1, 2013.

The documentary is a fine behind-the-scenes look at the documentary and the panic it caused.  There are interviews with Welles' daughter, Chris Welles Feder, director Peter Bogdanovich, and several others, along with recreations, played by actors, of reactions of people who heard the broadcast.

Not much in the way of extras, except for a few outtakes, a brief ""making-of"" segment, and some of the letters written to Welles.

A good documentary, though I think 2 hours would have given it justice.",1383350400,4,965,5.114649681528663
5857183,4,B00DUX2908,"I wish the DVD had the full recording of the radio broadcast of ""The War of the Worlds.""  It is still a good documentary about how a radio drama based on a science fiction story and presented as a live real time news report could produce a panic.  Mostly people who tuned in after the show had started heard only the parts where the Martians were attacking New Jersey and they missed the introduction to the show that explained that it was just a radio drama.  The public reaction after it was realized that it was only a radio play ranged from praise to rage.  The DVD only deals with the events in the United States late in 1938.

This was not the only radio dramatization of ""The War of the Worlds,"" there are others not mentioned on the DVD.  The more infamous example was the broadcast during February, 1949 in Quito, Ecuador.  It created a mass panic among the citizens of Quito!  When they learned that it was a radio play, they were not amused.
Reportedly a mob formed and a riot broke out.  The building where the radio station was located in was set on fire.  Tragically, a few people were killed as a result.  For more information about this incident, you might enter terms like Quito, ""War of the Worlds, and ""radio hoax"" into the search engine of your choice.",1383350400,5,1272,4.416309012875536
8598088,5,B00DUX2908,"My folks grew up in the depression and we got to hear the old radio shows. Then we heard this one & considering the times & all, it was damn scary. Then we saw ""The Night That Panicked America"" which showed what was really happening,like Orson angry that he had to take a station break to announce it was a radio stage play--by that time it was too late. No one heard it. The ending was as it was intended.  All copies of scripts collected by the police except Orson's Guess who bought his copy for $1 million? Comon just take-----STEVEN SPIELBERG!!!!!!!",1510272000,,554,4.431372549019608

8598090,5,B00DUX2908,"I love it mostly because my family, father, mother, sister and myself are actually in it.  I am now 83 yrs old, my father was a photographer (George A. Douglas), and  many of his photos have been used in this manner. Somehow this picture of all of us listening to our radio (I was about 5yrs old at the time), this picture got to the producers and was included in the many photos they used for this film.  Amazing, but true..",1472428800,3,425,4.222222222222222
8598091,5,B00DUX2908,Received in good order. Thanks.,1453939200,,31,5.4
8598092,5,B00DUX2908,excellent,1431993600,,9,9.0
8598093,4,B00DUX2908,"This documentary evokes quite effectively the crazed atmosphere associated with the broadcast of ""War of the Worlds"" in 1938.  The episode is quite fascinating.  My criticisms are not substantial but should be noted.  More might have made of Welles himself,. and where the episode fits into his own career.  And clearly actors were portraying those who wrote at the time of the impact of the broadcast upon them.  Yet only at the very end is the fact that the expressions of shock and outrage etc. were staged by actors is revealed.",1417996800,,532,4.802197802197802

8598095,5,B00DUX2908,Wriiten from survivors years ago and THE last survivor. It also breaks it down and uses some of the original script. Wonderful!!,1410739200,,128,4.863636363636363
8598096,5,B00DUX2908,We bought this after watching this on P B S. We enjoyed it so much we decided we needed to own it.,1396137600,,98,3.5
8598097,5,B00DUX2908,"This is based on the broadcast, but applies to the DVD, also.  The rogram has a quick scroll of newspaper articles about public reaction to the broadcast.  One is a NYT article about Brevard College in North Carolina (evidently, someone contacted the local newspaper which put the report on a wire service; the article then went, in theory at least, world wide).  Students fainted, and many telephoned parents to take them home.  In a history of the College, it is said President Coltrane of the College received several letters chastising the BC students for being so gullible.",1394064000,,578,4.927835051546392
