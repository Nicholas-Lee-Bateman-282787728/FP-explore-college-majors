8561115,5,B00B1UYJ14,"One of the most endearing and delightful series presently on the market,this is the story of Ohana Matsumae,the never-say-quit 16 year old daughter of a irresponsible single mother who is,in turn,the estranged daughter of a resort owner whom Ohana has never met. When mother decides to go on the lam with her latest boyfriend to escape his creditors,Ohana is sent to stay with her grandmother. After a long train ride and a steep walk up to the top of the hill she is so delighted to see how magnificent the hotel is she immediatly begins to pull the weeds she thinks are cluttering up her view...except they aren't weeds but wild rocamboles,an ingrediant used by the trainee-apprentant to the assistant chef,another 16 year old employee at the spa...and her new room mate. Just as the squabble begins,an old woman from an upper widow calls out for Ohana to hold out her arms. It is her grandmother and instead of getting a warm welcome,Ohana is tossed a bucket and told to get to work. Thus starts a fast-paced and rich story,filled with the arcs of the several major players but mostly that of a delightful and persistenly up-beat girl bent on setting things to right.
The character designs are well above average and some of the background artwork,especially around the train stop,is near-superphoto realistic.
An exceptional and fast paced series,best for teens and young adults and worthy of the highest of recommendations.",1368489600,12,1428,4.929460580912863
