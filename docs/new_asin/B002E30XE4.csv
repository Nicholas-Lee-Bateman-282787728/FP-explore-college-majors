8538644,3,B002E30XE4,"This DVD is a compilation of different performances throughout Bobby McFerrin's career.  This in itself is a problem.  See, Bobby McFerrin is a funny man, and builds rapport with his audience along a concert.  Since this is just certain performances from a longer concert, some jokes are kind of lost in the moment, as opposed to have been built if you had seen the whole concert.  Still, some jokes remain funny regardless.
If you are a Bobby McFerrin fan, like me, you will like most of what's on the DVD.  However, I felt that some of the old performances (around the 80's) had under parr video quality.  If you want the popular songs, this is the DVD for you.  If you want the whole concert experience, look for another DVD.
I don't regret buying this DVD, but I will buy another one for the whole experience.",1344902400,2,813,4.527397260273973
