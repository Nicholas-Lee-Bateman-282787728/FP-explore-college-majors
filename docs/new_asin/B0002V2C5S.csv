8295893,4,B0002V2C5S,"The best thing about this series is having both Rusty and Pete showing you the steps for leaders and followers.  Often you have instructors concentrating on just one or the other, but Rusty and Pete do a good job of breaking it down for both dancers.  If you're taking Lindy Hop classes, this DVD along with Levels 1 & 2 make good ""refresher"" dvds (although, if you're already a lindy hopper, you may want to skip the level 1 dvd).",1168473600,2,431,4.375
