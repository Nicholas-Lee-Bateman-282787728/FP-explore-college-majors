8328019,5,B001NWR6X8,I learned a little too late that if you order outside of your country that the DVD don't play in your DVD player. We are checking into our options and hoping to get this DVD to work. Country options are different for every country. For example: we live in the USA. We ordered this DVD that came from Japan. Movies from Japan will not play on our Sony DVD player. Check your options before buying anything from other countries.,1451001600,,426,4.405063291139241
