7962327,3,B000066E2Y,"The film opens with an automobile wedged in a tree. I haven't seen anything like this since my company stopped supplying me with rental cars. (Rental cars are magic. They can do anything.) We soon find out that Steven Grlscz [sic] is a vampire who courts women then kills them. He can taste emotion in their blood and keeps a log book. The film takes place in the non-metric part of England that measures speed in miles per hour instead of kilometers per hour.

Steven becomes intrigued by Annie Labels (Elina Lwensohn), an engineer with a French accent and B positive blood. About the same time the police (Timothy Spall who would later become a rodent in those Potter films) also becomes interested in Steven who has lost two girlfriends in the last few months.

The film was also released under a different title, ""Immortality."" It is an interesting and different vampire film. The character of Steven was intentionally dead pan for much of the movie which weighed the film down in a number of scenes.

I would of liked to have seen Steven's character more developed through dead girlfriends instead of just the one we get to see. Worth a peek if you like vampire films. It is currently available on a multi-pack called ""8 Horror Classics"" which includes ""Dracula 2000"" and ""Dawn to Dusk"" both of which should be in any horror collections.
