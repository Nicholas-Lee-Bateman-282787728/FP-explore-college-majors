7915398,2,B000023VUQ,"I like Danny Glover and I do think math is something everyone should have a good grasp on, be it an artist, an athlete, a poet or, of course, a future scientist. I liked the idea of a documentary that will show the general public how important math is and how everyone does some sort of math too.

However, this set talks about math very vaguely. It mentions the words ""math"" and ""mathematics"" a lot, but it never gets to explain anything of it. It tells you that statistics are used in sports, for example, but never comes around to tell you what statistics is or what part of it turns out to be important in sports, or how decisions are made based upon statistics. It's like someone telling you how awfully useful a hammer is and never getting to show you what one looks like or how is it used.

I was disappointed with this product.",1407715200,3,835,4.312101910828026
7915399,5,B000023VUQ,"This series is great.

Unfortunately, I ordered from Overman2000 (to get the lowest price).  But, this crook NEVER SHIPPED the DVDs and NEVER ANSWERED MY EMAILS.

Fortunately, Amazon will refund my money.

This crook is hoping that YOU forget about your order so he can keep your money.",1200528000,26,286,4.895833333333333
7915400,5,B000023VUQ,"Danny Glover hosts this series originally aired by PBS. In each of the hour-long programs, there are a number of related segments, providing a look at mathematics that most high school (and even college!) graduates rarely experience. True, there is some ""traditional"" material, like statistics and probability, but most of the material is very contemporary, and extremely interesting. Topics include: possible shapes for a closed yet infinite universe, how IMax movies and ""virtual"" amusement park rides are designed (computational geometry- the basis for all computer graphics), how discrete graphs are used to track shopping habits (part of a HUGE field called data mining), the experience of ""seeing"" space that has more than three physical dimensions, how GPS works, and the list goes on. This is an excellent learning and teaching tool, as well as being very entertaining. For folks who only think of mathematics in terms of what they learned in school, this series is a very eye-opening and informative experience.",993427200,23,1020,5.341614906832298
