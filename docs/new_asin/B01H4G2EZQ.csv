8764747,5,B01H4G2EZQ,This was an amazing concert.  The concert venue was impressive.  Both the Grafenegg Schloss and orchestral shell were awesome.  The audience seemex somewhat small but enthusiastic.  The color on this standard DVD was beautiful with very clear images.  The video direction was excellent with few uninteresting shots.  The sound was fantastic -- I listened to it using the DTS 5.0 setting (PCM stereo and Dolby digital 5.0 are also available).  I am impressed that the audio engineers could get such clean sound from an outdoor venue.  As with many of these outdoor summer concerts the program started in the afternoon and ended after dark.  The stage lighting was so good that this transition was hardly noticed.  Other reviewers have mentioned the program which was varied and quite interesting.  All of the performers were very good.  The DVD that I received was in NTSC format and played with no problem on a standard North American DVD player.,1507507200,,946,4.993589743589744

8764749,5,B01H4G2EZQ,"I bought this DVD along with Sommernachts Konzert 2016. I thought this one would be the uninteresting of both.  It's program at a first glance looked bland. But I was all wrong! The first part are seldom performed pieces but by no means second rate. The Von Weber's Kozertstuck played by the great pianist Rudolf Buchbinder is enticing, beautiful and complex. Peretyatko  and Terfel are top notch and they make a great duo with a very good and fun interpretation of ""Quanto Amore"" from ""L'elisir d'amore"". The only bland thing about this DVD is the audience. Highly recommended.",1483833600,4,578,4.887755102040816
