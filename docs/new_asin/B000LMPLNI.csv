2710615,5,B000LMPLNI,"Very good Movie. Not intend for kids to watch. Several bloody scenes, would never think that John Travolta would be in a bloody movie. If you like a thriller get it. But, please no Kids!!!!!!!",1188432000,,192,4.514285714285714
2710616,3,B000LMPLNI,"Crime drama thriller. A true story of two psychopaths who murder people for money without any conscience. However the film explains that money is only reason why they do it. The revealation is hard to digest but superb action of Salma Hayek and obsessed cop Travolta make the movie plausible although it is true story. Salma Hayek with her sultry and curvaceous body also proves that she can act unusual roles showing jealousy. Leto's performance as killer is not up to the mark. He looks like a innocent fool rather than a ferocious killer. Travolta is electrifying as ever.
  The plot is simple..a cat and mouse chase for the killers by dedicated cops. The chemistry between Travolta and Scott doesn't click although they worked in 'Get shorty' earlier. Scott performs his job as if he is doing a favor to get his paycheck. We wonder how Travolta puts up with him.
  The film stands out in meticulously done art direction and good cinematography to depict that 1940's era. The cars, even the plans, streets and country are atmospheric of 1950' (actually filmed in florida)The killing are gory and definitely not a family movie. But if you want to sit back and travel to 1940's disturbed killers, a workholic cop who has to find self-esteem in his job to fill the void of personal life, this might be the one ! We would hope the ending reveals more than it is but it is not !",1188259200,2,1376,4.604081632653061

When I was watching it I thought, ""how the heck did I miss this in the theater... and how did everybody else?"" This is a good movie. I am suprised that it wasn't marketed better and I am suprised that it did so poorly in the theater.

2710618,3,B000LMPLNI,"this is based on a true story and it is a wild film. now John Travolta and James Gandolfini are solid in this film,but Jared Leto and Salma Hayek turn it out. Salma in particular got it going on with that Glazed Doughnut in the Bag Body.  She showed me something not only visually,but her acting game came way up in this film for a change. this is a pretty good film that goes a bit too long in some parts,but it is worth checking out.",1186790400,,435,4.058139534883721
2710619,4,B000LMPLNI,"The quote above is from James Gandolfini's character, who, (like John Travolta), plays a detective on the tail of two serial killers.

The movie is reminiscent of film-noir. Getting off to a slow start, with a seemingly bland story about a con-man, it builds into a character study of two serial killers.
Unfortunately, not enough time is spent on characterization of these two, as we flip back and forth between them and Travolta's story. Nonetheless, we get enough of a glimpse into the mind of the killers to make this a tense drama.

Salma Hayek was the real star of this one. And though the film has some graphic violence, and suggested violence as well, her performance alone is worth the time you'll spend watching.",1186790400,5,722,4.768
2710620,4,B000LMPLNI,"LONELY HEARTS tries very hard to evoke the feeling of the 1940s and the troubled police officer whose wife's suicide haunts him until he finds revenge in the investigation of a pair of lonely hearts scam artists.  But what happens for the most part is a story that looks, sounds and fells like a 1940s crime movie - 3 parts celluloid transfer, 1 part story.

John Travolta and James Gandolfini play buddy homicide detectives who overcome the ennui of their job when they begin to investigate the multiple murders of 'lonely women' who fall prey to snappy con artist men.
The pair they are chasing are Ray Fernandez (Jared Leto) and his partner in crime Martha Beck (Salma Hayek), a diabolical couple who find their victims through the personal ads and then fleece then murder them victims in heinous ways. Todd Robinson wrote and directed the film based on his grandfather's experience - Elmer C. Robinson (Travolta) - and it is this bit of personal touch that makes the sluggish story work.  The capable supporting cast includes such solid actors as Laura Dern and Scott Cain with fine cameos by Alice Krige and Dagmara Dominczyk, playing victims.

Hayek and Leto muster a chemistry on the screen that, while strange in type, allows the viewer to understand the motivation of the crimes.  It is a solid cast and a good story: it just seems more derivative of old movies than a film with original thought.  Grady Harp, August 07",1186099200,9,1428,4.737903225806452
2710621,4,B000LMPLNI,"I read a few reviews about the movie and it got my attention so when I watched it I was surprised how good the performances were, Travolta and Gandolfini got good chemistry, Jared Leto makes an ok perfomance but is SALMA HAYEK who steal the movie, not only she gives a great perfomance but she's the center of the movie, I was amazed how good of an actress she is, she plays a psyco and malevolant cold-bloded killer  !!!
  The movie might be a little slow but it's a good movie with a killer perfomance by Salma, and I totally agree, she deserves an Oscar nomination for this one !!!",1186099200,,584,4.290909090909091
2710622,4,B000LMPLNI,"The focus of this movie is on the detectives, rather than the Lonely Hearts killers, and therefore Gandolfini and Travolta got what little of the critical notice there was.

But Salma Hayek and Jared Leto also turn in fabulous performances as the dysfunctional couple who prey off of, and ultimately kill, the women who fall for their scam.

2710623,5,B000LMPLNI,"Director Robinson remade the movie ""Lonely Hearts"" because Detective Elmer Robinson was his grandfather.  He wanted to explore the many faceted sacrifices that the police endure witnessing a lifetime of criminal behavior and  more importantly, the strain put on their families.  Detective Robinson solved the Lonely Hearts murder(s) case, but with a huge price.  It's a fine movie and deserved full distribution.

2710648,3,B000LMPLNI,"Good solid crime story.  A bulked up Travolta was good as a detective.  It was done as a Noir movie, with the Femme Fatale

to portray actual events accurately.
When I first saw this title, I had hoped that it was Miss Lonelyhearts, with Montgomery Clift.  For some reason, this movie has
never been released in the US as a DVD.  It was a better---though entirely different--movie.

2710649,4,B000LMPLNI,"This is a star studded cast of a remake of a previous film. Much of the story is true except the role of the murderess is played by Selma Hayek, not an obese older woman. John Travolta, plays Elmer Robinson, the lead detective based in Long Island. His partner, Charles Hilterbrandt, played by James Gandolfini.  Raymond Martin Fernandz played by Jared Leto, and Scott Caan plays the smart a**** junior detective. It was directed by Todd Robinson, the grandson of the lead detective, Elmer.

Why, this escaped the theatre so soon in 2097 is a mystery to me. This is a film of the early 1950's. A couple are preying on lonely women, stealing their money, and then murdering the women, trying to make it look like suicide. They might have succeeded if not for Elmer Robinson's great intuit, and the killing if a policeman in the mid-west. This is a good detective film Travolta and Gandolfini have good chemistry. Travolta has an interesting personal story that plays into this film, well. However, it is Jared Leto and Selma Hayek who steal the film. They are riveting when they are in the screen.  Well done.

When I praise this little known film it is only because of how well Travolta and Gandolfini complimented each other.  It is really a loss if you can watch this film and not pick up on it....give this film another chance, quit looking at the dame and watch the subtle undercurrents.",1391904000,2,552,4.670103092783505

2710656,2,B000LMPLNI,"This is a remake of ""The Honeymoon Killers"", the true story of Martha Beck and Raymond Fernandez who set up women who place lonely hearts ads and together murder them for their money.  Tho the old movie would be great remade (it hails from 1969 in b&w), this movie is way off track.  Martha Beck was a plus-sized American nurse, and in this movie her character is a real attractive Mexican (?) woman.  It looks like someone got carried away with enough fiction that it doesn't resemble what happened.  This DVD broke while I was watching it for the first time - and I didn't care.

2710658,2,B000LMPLNI,"Basically I found this film over all rather dissapointing, but not to any unforgivable level mind you, it's just that the plot it's self was totally mediocre and even rather dull. I will say that the production values were very good, as was the acting by everyone involved. I love James Gandolfini, and he's genuinly good here but his acting while great kept reminding me of his emmy wining run as mob boss, Tony Soprano, only this time with a toupe and a hat to go with it But He was so incredible as Soprano I suppose as hard as he tried to shake that role it will probably haunt him for the remainder of his career. Travolta on the other hand was pretty good here, but except for his performance under the direction of Tarantino in Pulp Fiction, he's just an average actor, but he's better than average here, The story on it's own is just plain dull. Hayek was fine too but nothing spectacular. But Letto just annoyed me. his performance was certainly very good, but the character he plays along with a dull script left me thinking his role here was pretty unmemorable. It's easy to see how this went direct to video, with the except of a small run in a few theaters here and there. it's just not at the level of major movie making. The whole thing while welll acted just seems flat.",1367625600,,1286,4.384937238493724

2710661,5,B000LMPLNI,"Although two other movies have been made about the 'lonely hearts' murders, neither framed the killings within the true story of one of the detectives working diligently to solve this almost (for a time) invisible crime spree.

The least accurate aspect of the film is Salma Hayek's beauty. My heart stopped beating for a second when she entered the hotel to meet Leto's character for the first time. And she was on screen with, as I said, Jared Leto and I am female. So let the fact that Martha Beck was hugely obese slide. Movies are supposed to be entertaining. Immensely talented and beautiful actresses need to work too. Especially when their performance mines the depths of creepiness and channels the essence of a monster, as Hayek's does all too well here.

Leto is equally as creepy, playing a character who seems to get entwined in a sort of relationship he certainly wasn't planning on.

Travolta turns in a broken-hearted yet even performance that we all already know he's capable of.

The real star of the movie, is of course, the new perspective of a family member of one of the detectives on the case.

This is a must-see for those interested in true-crime accounts-- the extras on the dvd add perspective to the crime, criminals and the writer/director's family history.",1321315200,,1286,4.800904977375565
2710662,5,B000LMPLNI,"Although I have been a fan of James Gandolfini and John Travolta for many years, this is a worthy film but hard to watch because of the fact I am a father and I have kids. Violent crime is never an easy subject but when it turns heartless, it surfaces human emotions that are hard to shed for awhile. This film was very well done and all the actors were top notch but as I indicated, the subject matter is disturbing. Just when you think people couldn't be sicker, somebody always tops the list with something else. This film will have you dealing with raw emotions and the fight over eye for an eye.

2710665,4,B000LMPLNI,"I here compare this film with its model The Honeymoon Killers (1969)

The two films go together since the former is a remake of the latter. They have to be watched together, one after the other, no matter in what order. The story is pathetic and pitiful. A man takes advantage of the loneliness of some women to literally ""abduct"" them from sanity and ""infect"" them with infatuation, which enables him to clean them up of their possessions. But one really falls in love and she abducts him from sanity and infects him with her jealousy into killing the women on whose backs they live. A killing couple, supposedly brother and sister, who skim and milk the crowd of solitary and lonely middle class women.

The older film (1969) in black and white was a small budget thriller and it shows how jealousy is mounting and building up in the woman and how she manipulates the man into becoming a killer, till the moment she discovers he is a liar. Then she will cause his downfall herself and her own at the same time. Pure jealousy confronted to a lying partner in a situation that can only give birth to extreme jealousy. It is not easy to be a female pimp of a male gigolo. But the man and the woman are both perfectly composed and logical till the end. The beginning though seems too slow.

The more recent film (2006) shifts the vision of the criminal situation from a more or less objective unidentified abstract observer to a team of two cops following the murderers and the bloody trail they leave behind. And the observer is the partner of the main detective. This film shifts the criminal idea from pure jealousy in the woman to insanity in the man. He is a killer instead of being a manipulated gigolo. He is not lying to the woman but she can't stand what she makes him do, hence she is crazy somewhere too. But she will not cause his downfall. They will be caught up by the cops from New York because he starts enjoying killing simple witnesses or passers-by. But here the beginning is turned into some circus parade.

This latter film intensively also shows Old Sparky, the full execution of the man with it and only the first phase for the woman. It becomes a graphic film against death penalty since Old Sparky is positioned both at the beginning and at the end of the film, sandwiching the story between these haunting visions. The technique used in this color film is a lot more dynamic and lively than in the older film. But it does not really add to the subject except the vision of Old Sparky but it is an easy explanation to declare a criminal crazy. He might be deranged and get deranged by his own crimes but he has to be sane and perfectly well balanced to go on with killing and escaping. That's why he is shown as losing his mind when at the end he leaves corpses along the road and does not run away.

2710668,2,B000LMPLNI,"The film starts with music that suggests the 1940s. We see ""Sing Sing Prison"" and the witnesses to an execution. This is the story about a con man who romanced lonely women to swindle them out of their money and illusions. [Does that white suit seem out of place?] Is that language realistic? The situations seem to be deliberately shocking, which distracts from the story. One detective chooses to look into the suicide of a girl. The scenes are staged to stay in the 1940s. [Note the story to explain Ray's history during the war. Beware of self-serving statements!] The story seems to drag because of the emphasis on shocking the viewers. The shifting of scenes is also distracting.

The police investigation finds other victims that match the pattern. A daughter from Albany has a complaint. A patrolman remembers an incident, the records provide an identification. The detectives find the postal box, then trace it to an address. Blood soaked into the floorboards! They just missed them! [Who tipped them off?] The detective continues his search, he knows Ray Fernandez will strike again. And he does. Twice. Ray is traced to Michigan. Are their actions believable? The police arrive to capture them alive. They find the bodies. Martha Beck makes a statement, they are extradited back to New York for the murders. Guilty. The final scene shows their ending. ""So long."" [You can research this true crime for more information.]

There is a long list of credits at the end. This is based on a true crime from the 1940s. I wonder how much was changed for dramatic effect? A better script and direction would make a better story. They took special care to imitate the clothes and cars of that era, but that money could have been spent on a better script. There is no need for the settings when things like that go on today.

2710669,2,B000LMPLNI,"SPOILER ALERT!  This could have been a gritty, realistic crime drama on par with Monster.  But, instead, it looks like a Salma Hayek vehicle, with cutesy-poo Jared Leto tagging along to please the girlies.  John Travolta is so low-key he seems bored, and James Gandolfini is little more than a sidekick sounding board.  Laura Dern comes off as a stooped, too-skinny spinster, the very kind of female Leto might pursue.  Travolta's treatment of her appears itself shortshrift as he sneaks into her dad's house and beds her in his dress shirt.  Was the director reluctant to allow a flash of the star's plump arms and chest?  No doubt fat was verboten in this flick.  Hayek's character is based on a woman purportedly too broad to squeeze into the electric chair. (She supposedly sat on the arms).  Okay, so no one designated this film a docudrama.  But it's simply not credible that a con man would go around with a drop-dead-gorgeous gal in tow, trying to pass her off as his old-maid sister.  There would be too much danger that the marks would smell a rat.  A beautiful woman attracts too much attention, especially in the provocative attire Hayek often wears.  Men would pursue her right to the victims' doors.  Cool, all-American Leto himself, with his baby face and big blue eyes, is too good-looking to convince most women he needs a lonely-hearts column to meet a prospective partner.  Had he come across as a shy, awkward foreigner (which the real killer may have) he would have been more believable.  The only attempt to make him less attractive was shaving part of his hair, which on the crown is done so unrealistically that it resembles a Franciscan monk's hairdo rather than natural balding.  And, of course, Travolta's wig is no tonsorial work of wizardry either.
Like the Black Dahlia, this film is a failure.  There is a profound lack of suspense as the plot plods onward.  Women are fleeced off-stage as Hayek wiggles by in a skin-tight dress.  There's little motivation or build-up as she and Leto shoot and bludgeon.  One of the blandest scenes is one in which she plops into a highway patrolman's car and, with barely a word, sinks her face into his lap.  There's no discussion, no resistance, apparently no concern on the cop's part that she might go for his gun, stab, or even bite him, or that Leto, parked ahead, might try to attack him off-guard.  The policeman doesn't appear to grope her in return.  He doesn't smile.  He looks more like a man emptying an overfull bladder.  About the only character who exhibits any passion about anything is Scott Caan, who in evident fits of short man's syndrome, screams out obscenities.  In the forties, shouting the F-word in mixed-gender police stations was probably not permissable, but in this film, no one even blinks.  Time is wasted on insignificant chatter between Travolta, Dern, and Dan Byrd, who plays the former's son.  And then there's the obligatory ain't-execution-awful scene with Leto carried struggling to the chair, where he spasms, smokes, and slobbers.  Though it's said the two killers were electrocuted side by side, viewers are spared the death throes of the composed and perfectly coiffed Hayek.  The audience should have been spared the whole sordid affair.",1248220800,,3248,4.850909090909091

Martha becomes blindly jealous when Ray gets intimate with these pigeons & it becomes their undoing. Ms Hayek & Leto do a fine job. So does John Travolta, playing Elmer Robinson, the police detective assigned to the case. It becomes highly personal & obsessive because of tragedy in his own life. James Gandolfini is his partner, a lazy, amiable detective. Really it's the same character he plays as Tony Soparano, except he's a cop instead of a sociopathic hood. Go figure. The movie spans 1927 When Elmer joins the P.D. to 1951 in the closing scenes. There is little notice of World WarII, except for the proliferation of widows with death benefits.

2710672,2,B000LMPLNI,"Lonely Hearts chronicles the true story of the rise and fall of Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck, serial killers, who were responsible for a series of gruesome murders beginning in 1949 on Long Island. Fernandez initially started as a solo act, conning widows and love-starved lonely hearts out of their life savings. After he met up with Beck (in real life unattractive and overweight but here played by the attractive Salma Hayek), the pair then turned to murder while plying their nefarious trade.

The film was written and directed by Todd Robinson, who happens to be the grandson of Detective Elmer Robinson, the lead detective who basically was responsible for tracking the two psychopaths down and bringing them to justice. Robinson is played by a grim-faced John Travolta who attempts to convey the detective's working class persona. James Gandolfini plays Charles Hildebrandt, Robinson's detective sidekick who is the film's narrator (a more skilled screenwriter could possibly have dispensed with the narration and conveyed important information on a visual level).

The main problem with the film's narrative is that we're a captive audience as the two intrepid detectives proceed very slowly in trying to establish that it's Fernandez and Beck who are responsible for the murders they are investigating. While the investigation may have proceeded at a snail's pace in real life, it doesn't make for good drama. A good deal of judicious editing could have improved this film quite a bit. What's more, Robinson and Hildebrandt are pitted against another team of detectives who are unethical and the 'good cop-bad cop' clashes between the two pairs are full of clichs (a scene involving a discussion about Jackie Robinson inside the squad room, tinged with racial overtones, appears clearly anachronistic).

Detective Robinson's troubled personal life constitutes the film's ""B"" Story. We learn that his wife had committed suicide prior to working on the Fernandez-Beck case but we never find out why she did it. Travolta doesn't have much to do except almost coming to blows with his superiors and colleagues whenever the subject of his late wife is brought to the fore. Laura Dern plays Robinson's girlfriend but that relationship doesn't seem to go anywhere during the film. Gandolfini is unable to jettison his Tony Soprano persona despite playing a character on the other side of the law.

The rest of the film deals with the relationship between Fernandez (played by Jared Leto) and Hayek's Beck. There aren't a great deal of twists and turns as the killers dispose of one victim after another. Hayek plays Beck as over the top and the director seems obsessed with emphasizing her penchant for oral sex. Leto's Fernandez is pretty much one note as we get it early on that he's a passive-aggressive personality, obeying the orders of his Svengali-like lover.

There's a great deal of attention paid to period detail in this film and it seems more attention was paid to the set design than on the script itself. Lonely Hearts was a failure at the box office and it's pretty clear that early word of mouth had to be pretty negative. It might have been a mistake on the part of the film's producers to have hired the grandson of the film's protagonist to write and direct as he was probably too close to the material to be objective about it. His grandfather's personal life did not turn out to be very engaging the way he told it.

The subject of Lonely Hearts was already done years ago in a much more successful film entitled ""The Honeymoon Killers"". One wonders if there was anything really more to say about this subject matter. With the glut of screenplays out there for producers to pick from, I'm wondering how and why Lonely Hearts actually got made. One thing is for sure: film buffs will not be talking about this one in the years to come.",1236988800,,3862,4.924731182795699

2710675,4,B000LMPLNI,"Based on a true story, LONELY HEARTS is a powerful thriller that is even more compelling because it was written and directed by Todd Robinson, grandson of homicide cop Elmer C. Robinson, one of the key detectives responsible for bringing to justice Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck, a pair of psychopathic killers who preyed on rich, lonely women during the late 1940s.  Although they were only charged with three murders, it is believed that these ""Lonely Hearts Killers"" were responsible for 17 more.

John Travolta (as Elmer Robinson), James Gandolfini and Scott Caan play the detectives, while Jared Leto and Salma Hayek are cast as Fernandez and Beck.  Also in the cast are Alice Krige and Laura Dern.

Director Robinson has done a masterful job of recreating the look and feel of the post-war 1940s.  The actors all deliver cutting-edge performances.  Although she looks nothing like the real, overweight Martha Beck, Hayek's sultry portrayal is absolutely frightening.

2710676,3,B000LMPLNI,"The tone of the story and the cold bloodedness is unfolded with a lady who commits suicide. She happens to be the wife of a police detective (Elmer 'Buster' Robinson played by John Travolta).
The story then turns to 3 years later and a narrative flashback to the current events, by Charles Hildebrandt played by James Gandolfini. It traces the origins of the Lonely Hearts killers, Raymond Fernandez (Jared Leto) and Martha Beck (Salma Hayek) and how they met and went on their murderous spree.

Its an average thriller, but falls way short of character development or to be more precise, integrity. The real Martha Beck (according to historical archives) was overweight, not pretty and quite a foul mouthed vile personality (to say the least), now you have a spanish accented bombshell played by Salma Hayek who plays that role, it somehow does not fit. That fact aside she did give an encouraging performance.
I would say the real winner in this film was Jared Leto who played Raymond's weasel like psychotic character perfectly, i thought it was a fantastic performance by him.
Overall, the film is defintiely quite disturbing, especially with the last scene and viewer discretion is STRONGLY recommended. You may feel quite uneasy watching some of the scenes. But remember although it depicts a true life incident, its still just a movie.

Travolta was much better than I expected because he didn't rely on the tics and mannerisims that he uses on almost all of his other movies, the pauses between words, the statacco delivery, the playing with the cigarettes etc. Gandolfini was pretty good and I was able to separate him from Soprano even though he used the same voice. Leto and Hayak were great, hard to imagine during the movie that Leto had played Steve Prefontaine to perfection.

His life changes drastically, however, when he meets beautiful Martha, who sees through his lies instantly and drags him into a series of more heinous and violent crimes.

The true story of Martha Beck and Raymond Martinez Fernandez, or ""The Lonely Hearts Killers,"" has already become the basis of ""The Honeymoon Killers,"" but ""Lonely Hearts"" is substantially different from the 1970 cult film. That is, Martha and Ray, played by Salma Hayek and Jared Leto respectively, are described as gorgeous and handsome couple. Leto's performance is simply great as the man manipulated by his partner in crime, but more memorable is Salma Hayek as Martha, conniving and chilling femme fatale, though some say (rightly) this sexy image is far from real Martha Beck.

The film also shows the investigations of the detectives mainly by Elmer Robinson (John Travolta) and Charles Hilderbrandt (James Gandolfini). Elmer Robinson, whose wife committed a suicide recently, looks as if seeking the answer to the death of her while having an affair with another woman Rene Fodie (Laura Dern). All the actors' performances are wonderful and this part of the film is almost as strong as the Martha and Raymond part, but I think the film might be better with less time spent on Elmer Robinson's relations with Rene and his son.

2710687,2,B000LMPLNI,"Based on the true story of a serial killer couple, ""Lonely Hearts"" sometimes feels more like a parody of a 1940's film noir drama than a film noir drama itself.  This is particularly disappointing given the high-octane rating of its cast which includes John Travolta, James Gandolfini, Salma Hayek, Laura Dern and Jared Leto among others.

Travolta and Gandolfini play two homicide detectives hot on the trail of Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck (Leto and Hayek), two psychopaths who, posing as a lovesick Lothario and his spinster sister, bilk money out of lonely women who post pen pal want ads in papers around the nation.  After one of the women turns up dead in her bathtub (seemingly a suicide), the two investigators discover that these individuals may have cut a much more impressive swath of death across the country than originally suspected.

Written and directed by Todd Robinson, ""Lonely Hearts"" is a second-rate detective drama that, at most, gives viewers the chance to watch a bunch of A-list level actors play dress-up for close to two hours.  Everybody looks dashing in their fedoras and high heels, but beyond that there is little of substance here to engage either the interest or the imagination of the audience.  The screenplay lines up the usual array of film noir stereotypes, including the brooding detective, the wisecracking cynic, the nettlesome jokester, the virtuous woman, the heartless female fatale, and the henpecked petty criminal.  Moreover, the arch dialogue and over-earnest acting on the part of Travolta and Gandolfini add to the decidedly faux-noir feeling.

The relationship between the psychopathic lovebirds is so much more complex and intriguing than anything else in the movie that every time we cut to the investigation (which takes up a goodly portion of the film) the story pretty much stops dead in its tracks.  However, the killers leave so many clues and dead bodies in their wake that it's amazing it takes the authorities as long as it does to finally track them down.

There's admittedly a certain poignancy that creeps into the closing stretches of the story, but it really isn't enough to rescue the fine actors or the movie itself from the overall taint of mediocrity.",1192838400,,2227,5.0271739130434785

I also approved of Selma Hayek, although I was amused when I did some reading on the real-life Martha Beck and learned she was, in the flesh, close to 300 pounds.

Hardly a justification for the slender (if shapely) Miss Hayek to portray Martha with any justice.  I suppose Hollywood is still light years away from having a ""heavyweight"" play a leading lady, even if Nikki Blonsky did recently steal the show in the lead of ""Hairspray"".

The DVD was a colossal disappointment BECAUSE it had no extra features of note.  It should have, at the very least, included a documentary about the real-life Lonely Hearts killers.

Everything is well-done in Lonely Hearts. The script is good, performances are all decent, with Selma standing out. Buuut...there's just not enough x-factor, that magic thang that makes a film really get inside my brain and heart. There are so many other excellent films noir out there that this ends up on the A-minus-list. Still, considering how few decent story-based films are made these daze, Lonely Hearts is no slouch.

Unless you've already seen Double Indemnity, The Killing, Touch of Evil, Out of the Past, Maltese Falcon, etc etc, you may want to wait on this one.

That said, it's a good psychological portrait with the added soupcon of being made by the original main character cop's grandson.

(And btw, here's Gandolfini doing his Tony voice as usual...listen to him on the commentary track and you hear his real and very different voice.

Hayek's performance is especially riveting, and her Martha Beck comes across as unflinchingly evil whilst besotted with her lover.
