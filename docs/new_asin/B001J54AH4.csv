3651514,4,B001J54AH4,"I really loved the movie, and showed a lot of great views of Alaska, I was there myself in 2008 and fell in love with the land and the people, I do recommend this movie to anybody who love watching the outdoors. I just wish it was about 2 hours long. It makes you want to live there and be apart of something that a lot of people do not know anything about, and how to survive the Alaskan wilderness, keep up the great work Paul and I look forward in seeing the next video you put out. Take Care.

3651515,1,B001J54AH4,"Riding around on an ATV (and snowmobile), grilling chicken wings on a baby Weber grill while waiting for the next delivery of building materials to be airlifted by helicopter is not what I imagined for this DVD. Some nice scenic shots, but that's about it. If you are looking for the (typical) romantic saga of the struggle to survive in Alaska, forget this movie.",1278547200,,364,4.703125
3651516,5,B001J54AH4,"I found this DVD very inspiring and relaxing. I had no idea how awesome Alaska is, how breathtaking! I really enjoyed the lay-back Walt Disneyish- Ole' Yeller type of narrative style. I must admit, at times, I would have liked to hear even more narrative. However some of the scenes simply don't need words! A city slicker finally takes the jump to living out in the wild land of Alaska with all it's challenges and adventures. Some of the shots must have taken hours and just the right timing to capture. It also kind of reminds me of a film I saw years ago called ""My side of the Mountain"" where a young man finds solitude, peace, and adventure out in the wild. It was just great!",1238025600,,682,4.377952755905512
3651517,1,B001J54AH4,I have copies of Dick Proenneke's videos which I consider classics. Watching them is fascinating in every respect and they seem to melt the stress away. This video is about a guy who moves to Alaska but has very little real wilderness appeal and the music and narration are irritating. You can tell the guy spliced together a bunch of home movie clips. I bought this based on the other 2 reviews but I didn't see any redeeming wilderness quality whatsover in this. A guy sitting by an outdoor grill cooking chicken wings and riding around on a 4 wheeler is not what makes up a true mountain man. What a joke! Don't waste your money on this one.,1236902400,2,644,4.420168067226891
3651518,5,B001J54AH4,This film is truly captivating and gives an insightful view into a life seldom experienced by everyday people. This documentary is great for anyone wishing to get a mere glimpse of life in the Alaskan bush. With all the chaos and uncertainty in today's economy....this film brings a new perspective on what is truly important and basic in life...thank you for that.,1225584000,,365,4.903225806451613
3651519,5,B001J54AH4,"Beautiful footage of rural Alaska....great narration!
Highly recommended. Would make great Christmas good for those who appreciate life in the outdoors.",1225497600,,152,6.285714285714286

8311881,5,B001J54AH4,Great documentary on Talkeetna and the options as you journey up to Denali.,1508284800,,75,4.846153846153846
8311882,3,B001J54AH4,"I love the idea. But sometimes great ideas need to be greatly executed. At the start, I thought I was going to see survival techniques, but it was more of a family video.",1490745600,,170,4.181818181818182
8311883,4,B001J54AH4,"Heads up nature lovers. This is a beautifully filmed and documented outdoor adventure of life in the Alaskan frontier. Follow Paul Hemann and his son on their daily lives building a home in the wilderness, trapping for food, mushing dogs and so much more in this stunningly beautifully filmed story of their daily chronicled lives. The scenery is breathtaking and the pace is real, about real people doing real life in one of the few remaining truly frontiers of the world. Makes me want to take a vacation there and jealous that they live there. Well done!",1490745600,,557,4.752577319587629
8311884,2,B001J54AH4,Long & dull. Bad video footage too!,1490659200,,35,4.142857142857143
8311885,5,B001J54AH4,"Some people are so blessed that they don't just visit Alaska but get to live there! I found this montage of scenes of the rugged yet beautiful life of Alaska  to be comforting and touching to my soul. Each scene lead you to wonder what's coming next There's something so profound about simplicity and real people just doing normal ordinary things  that are extraordinarily moving. I had a chance to watch National Geographic's dead-end express only to see that some of the actors or characters are actually  Real people up there! Some people watch this and they ""get it."" And some probably won't. I did and I'm glad I watched it!",1490313600,,629,4.648648648648648
8311886,5,B001J54AH4,"Awesome movie especially to have a realistic understanding of true today life in Alaska!
This film is exactly what I hoped it would be...spectacular footage.  Makes me want to move to Alaska!!!",1490313600,,193,5.03125
8311887,5,B001J54AH4,Soooooooooo amazing! BEAUTIFUL!,1490313600,,31,9.666666666666666
8311888,5,B001J54AH4,"Finally an authentic Alaskan film that doesn't have all the ridiculous antics and drama of all the the so called reality shows on tv these days. It shows real souls in their real environment doing things that most of us about dream about . It's a beautiful film that keeps you wondering what's coming next. Going through not only different days in their life but years, seasons and more . Makes me wish I was a young kid again. I would most highly recommend this film and I don't think 5 stars are enough ... And I got to watch it free with Amazon Prime which made it even better..",1490313600,,581,4.290909090909091
8311889,5,B001J54AH4,"I have played this I guess fifteen times or more I still am not tired of watching it, love the scenery.",1356739200,,103,3.9523809523809526
