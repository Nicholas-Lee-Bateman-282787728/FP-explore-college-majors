8178759,5,B000NJWIQC,A very good overall descrption and documentary with actucal film footage of the Vietnam War.,1415404800,,92,5.2
8178760,5,B000NJWIQC,"Interesting selection of U.S. Government information and propaganda films made during the Vietnam War period.  Films chosen are both from documentaries made for the troops and for the american public. Includes several of the famous Army ""Big Picture"" television series shows, as well as John Ford's classic and hawkish documentary made in 1970 for the USIA but withdrawn because the tide of public opinion toward the war had changed.  Includes a wonderfully campy sex-education film for the troops titled ""Where the Girls Are"".  Overall an eclectic group of films that reflect the times as presented by your government.",1226793600,2,619,5.295918367346939
8178761,1,B000NJWIQC,"What you get is a series of dis-connected vidoes produced by various government organizations throughout the mid to late 60's.  What you don't get is much in ways of front line combat photography (there is some, but limited).  You'd only be interested if you wanted to understand how a government uses the media to influence your views on war.  Overall, a big waste of money for those looking for hard hitting front line video.  For that, go get Cronkite's DVD's.",1212969600,15,463,4.75
