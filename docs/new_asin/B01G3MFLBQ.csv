7753768,5,B01G3MFLBQ,"A film true to Ballard's near-prophetic insight into the flaws of human nature. Civilization, without sincere change in the hearts of mankind, is inevitably fated to sink into such low levels of depravity as showcased.

A film which breaks the atypical mold of what audiences have come to expect from a versatile art form. Wheatley has cast and directed those best suited to their roles, utilizing Ballard's original work in the best of ways. An homage to the source material and the author, High-Rise is a game-changer in every sense of the word.",1468022400,12,547,4.881720430107527

7753770,1,B01G3MFLBQ,"Little to no substance.

The message on class-structure and the line between civility and barbarity is obvious, outdated and poorly addressed herein. Not to mention, like the book, there's quite a massive plot hole from the very beginning of the movie up until its ending that's never addressed.

There's little to no actual story. The movie has no conflict to propel what semblance of a narrative there is. There's no protagonist, no antagonist, no conflict. It's mostly just a lot of ""fancy"" shots made surreal by the juxtaposed music. Some people do bad things. Some do drugs. Some people have sex. There's a little bit of violence and some people babble pretentiously about humanity while doing uncivilized things and then it ends with none of the characters ever having gone through any sort of arc or development.

If you like your movies with a complete lack of reason, bare-bones plot and Kubrick levels of undeserved self-worth then by all means... Go watch a porn.

If you want a great post-apocalyptic film that details people's fall into depravity, check out The Divide. Now that's one intense, no holds-barred flick with an amazingly emotional original score and an uncompromising ending.",1467417600,13,1201,5.05050505050505

7753778,2,B01G3MFLBQ,"OK, so it's a movie adaptation of a J.G. Ballard (or Bah-lard as Tom Hiddlestone would say) but it's still dumber than a box of rocks. What's never explained is since this high-rise building is not a prison, when it descends into chaos, why don't people just leave to get out? Why don't they call the police for help?

The sets are oddly mesmerizing. I loved the rooftop garden which was massive. Yet this whole upstairs downstairs class struggle the movie tried to depict shows the folly of the worst of Ballard's sci-fi. I mean, let's get serious, Crash was just as dumb a plot and in movie form it was even dumber.

Having said all that and with the limitations of the book this comes from, the first hour of the movie is watchable. The last bit just fast-forward as it's so boringly repetitive in its depiction of anarchy and chaos.

There are zero extras on the DVD, by the way.",1487462400,2,883,4.438271604938271

7753780,2,B01G3MFLBQ,"At the edge of mid-Seventies London, several floors of tenants reside in a forbidding high-rise set against an angry sky, separated sharply by class from servants to cake-baking, Summer-dress wearing lower-middle class mothers, to snotty 18th-Centuryesque elites who revel in coctail parties and masquerade balls. When the building starts having frequent power outages and other logistical fiascos, tenants grow filthier in their habits and more violent in their ways. Blood, garbage and callous social mayhem ensue.

You won't enjoy this film. That is the highest thing I can say about it. At best, it is horrifically intriguing, at worst, meaninglessly demoralizing. If it were not self-conscious, it would be surreal. Its filthy palette is blood-spattered, full of stench and rape and impetuous, passive-aggressive musical shifts. Its plot is by turns slow and lurching, its characters by turn lethargic and violent. It is cold,strange, cerebral, jaded, and absolutely brilliant if you happen to be a high-art hipster with a brain-infested colon; maybe only then is its apocryphal darkness worth the effort.

In general, what you are watching is a nauseously long series of consciously over-snipped scenes which reveal little enough to allow a suspicion of some advanced art form taking place. A cheap trick: the illusion of mystery.

The biggest problem I have with this film is probably its absolute lack of moral dynamic, like a steady song that goes on and on without changing pitch, rhythm. It has no melody, it has no range. The characters have no real driving force or motivation, not even desperation for survival, though perhaps a vague notion of it. Even the violence, which in most films would at least serve as an indication of passion, is poorly motivated and sloppily executed.

Unfortunately, several great actors lent their ever-competent talent to this train wreck, including Jeremy Irons and Sienna Miller, which keeps the trick going a bit too long.",1485475200,,1971,5.267515923566879

7753784,2,B01G3MFLBQ,"Dr. Robert Laing (Tom Hiddleston) moves into a new and futuristic high-rise on the outskirts of London in 1975. His apartment is on the twenty-fifth of forty floors. The very top is occupied by Mr. Royal (Jeremy Irons), the architect and owner of the building. He's also constructing four others in the vicinity with a lake planned in the middle. The building has an indoor pool and a grocery store that is used by everybody. The one quirk of the building is that all the poorer, lower-class people live on the lower floors while richer, higher-class people live higher up. Royal's intention is to create a catalyst for interaction and change. While he intends improvement, things actually start to fall apart. Living in the lower floors is Mr. Wilder. He is upset at various injustices and slights he sees--power outages that take longer to resolve down below or the pool being reserved for rich people while children (most all of whom live in the lower half of the building) can't use it. He stirs up trouble. Naturally, Laing is caught in the middle, literally and figuratively.

The movie is based on a novel by J. G. Ballard published in the 1970s as a satire of the coming economic disparity he assumed would happen under Margaret Thatcher. Laing is a bachelor and a doctor of physiology. He keeps himself in great shape and is interested in participating in all the parties both above and below him, as well as the occasional sexual encounter (it is the 1970s, after all). He's a new-comer so he gives the viewer a chance to discover things about the building. The rich people make fun of him though Royal takes a liking to Laing and shares his intentions and desires with Laing. Royal is a figurehead for the rich just as Wilder is for the poor.

Wilder is a social climber who can't get anywhere and resents it. He's a TV documentarian who has been out of work. His very pregnant wife is befriended by Laing (who winds up just taking advantage of her). Meanwhile, the building descends into chaos as the grocery store is cleaned out and the pool becomes a place for the poor people to wash clothes. Power is intermittent throughout the building; water comes and goes as well. The clash between the rich and the poor gets violent several times and conditions get so bad people wind up eating pet food from the store, and eventually the pets themselves.

As satires go, this is very unsatisfying. In spite of the claims that rich and poor are different, they both are cruel and thoughtless to each other and even to themselves. The movie tries to be realistic about the social interactions but the situation becomes so absurd that the realism is at odds with the satire. Why don't people just leave? Why aren't other authorities brought in? If the point of the film is to show how a small but isolated and stratified society will implode why are these questions brought up within the film? The film makers don't understand the role of exaggeration in satire. The satire looks really weak in comparison to movies like Brazil or A Clockwork Orange (which is clearly an inspiration and source for the movie makers). Or even Idiocracy. The ridiculous elements of the story are taken too seriously, leaving the film empty and unconvincing.

For my part, I loved it (obviously), which almost never happens when I've read the book first.

7753801,2,B01G3MFLBQ,"Given its all-star cast and dystopian subject matter, I thought this film would be right up my alley.  Set in the U.K., the bleak countryside is devoid of buildings but for a few angular skyscrapers.  There is no talk of what might have just happened so, we are led to believe that things have been like this for a while.  Tom Hiddleston plays Dr. Laing, a single man who has just moved to one of these new buildings.  His apartment on a lower floor is emblematic of his status among the residents.  The more prominent the individual the higher up the floor.  The Brits seem to be more class than racially sensitive in these matters.

The top dog is Royal (Jeremy Irons), the architect.  Hes joined on the top floor with his emotionally distant wife, Ann (Keeley Hawes) who keeps a white stallion on the rooftop garden.  Sienna Miller is Charlotte, who lives a few floors above Laing with her 10 year old son.  Shes a party animal as are most of the inhabitants.  Wilder (Luke Evans) is a drunken documentarian and is married to Helen (Elizabeth Moss), who is very pregnant.  That doesnt stop her from drinking and smoking non-stop however.

The film has a decidedly 70s feel about it from the look of the cars, the clothing and Wilders impressive hair and mutton chops.  People party pretty much all of the time, taking time out only to venture to work or go shopping in the self-contained building.  The grocery store is well stocked, but with no-name brands and all in similar containers.  Generic takes on a whole new meaning.  Troublemakers exist upstairs and down.  Upstairs, the most effusive is Pangbourne (James Purefoy) who hates to venture downstairs where he might encounter someone of that level.  Downstairs, Steele (Reece Shearsmith) is constantly annoyed with all of the children, dogs and people stuffing up the trash chutes.

There really isn't much of a story here, but as time goes on, the residents become increasingly more restive, drunk, drugged, violent and yes, horny.  With little in the way of explanation the second half of the movie becomes part savagery, part sex orgy.  Alas it isn't very sexy, or entertaining and barely watchable.  One has the feeling of a voyeur watching on hidden cameras planted in a bedroom or something.  The film is directed by Ben Wheatley and written by his wife Amy Jump and is adopted from J. G. Ballards novel.  Not having read the novel, I cant comment on the films faithfulness.  While I can grudgingly understand how some can like this dark comedy,  it just isn't my cup of tea.  Cheers!",1474502400,,2551,4.710407239819005

7753803,4,B01G3MFLBQ,"I was intrigued by the trailer for this film and also that it was adapted from the novel by JG Ballard.  Let me say that it did not disappoint!  Tom Hiddleston plays easy going yet strangely serious Dr. Laing, a brain specialist who moves into a luxurious high-rise apartment in what appears to be 1970`s England.  At first he enjoys the place`s many amenities, such as a spa/gym, well-stocked grocery store, and extremely friendly neighbors who enjoy giving parties of various types.  As the weeks go by, however,  strange developments occur, spreading an ominous tone over the high-rise.  The main problems arise from the discontent of the people living on the lower floors: they are constantly resenting upper floor denizens and claiming discrimination.
There is a darkly humorous scene in which filmmaker Wilder leads a band of children to take over the communal swimming pool (they`ve been banned from it) and events steadily descend into chaos from then on.  Apartment residents raid the grocery, engage in various battles, and force the upper floor folks to exist in a state of siege in manager Royal`s luxurious place.  Laing is sympathetic to the plight of the rebels, though he is alternately courted and threatened by Royal`s allies.

All of this builds up to a startling conclusion that I really did not expect to transpire the way it does.  The film has the obvious parallels between the high-rise`s tenants and the British class situation, yes, but many other themes are treated, including  how simple it can be for human ""civilized"" values to break down in the midst of a crisis (this could also translate to a wartime situation or any natural disaster).  It`s definitely a unique  social science fiction  movie in the tradition of Soylent Green  and 1984.  Good performances, especially from Hiddleston  and Jeremy Irons as Royal.

7753807,3,B01G3MFLBQ,"Just finished watching a recent adaptation of J.G. Ballard's 1975 novel High-Rise, an allegory of social stratification (made literal in the building itself), isolation, and devolution. I had read the book some time ago and was curious to see what kind of movie it would make. The answer in this case is a slow one, a two-hour outing that would be better at 90 minutes, and maybe even better at 60. Despite a nicely contained lead performance by Tom Hiddleston and the appearance of Jeremy Irons, the novel's flaws appear even more pronounced when its world is rendered visible. (Why don't they just leave?) But Ballard's story is at least as much thought-experiment as social portrait, and it takes only a couple of assumptions to make the world of the novel come about. What if things began to deteriorate? And what if people liked it?",1473811200,2,837,4.779310344827586
7753808,2,B01G3MFLBQ,"High-Rise is adapted from a book, a book that I was inspired to read from the trailer of this movie, and without having read the book before-hand, I doubt the movie would've made much of any sense. There is an incredible amount of context that is built-up in the original story that has been eliminated or altered (and generally not in a positive way) within the movie's final cut. One such key note is the entirety on why Laing ends up in the building in the first place is because his sister (not actually dead!) encourages him to get an apartment there, and it is also within a short walking distance of his place of employment. The entire relationship between Laing and his sister, one of the biggest parts of expressing how twisted things become for him, isn't even present in the film.

The original story is dark, it goes down several roads that many might not feel comfortable with, and I can easily accept that not all of the original source material is adaptable to a wide audience, but there's absolutely no progressive aspect of the film's script that conveys the ""what"" and ""why"" of the story. Instead the film is filled with montage's of people dancing, Laing acting strangely, and general chaos throughout.  By the end of it all, much of the mental anxiety and reflection on society is lost in a few random dead bodies and a few murdered pets.

The cinematography and artistic value of this movie are great. It's filmed well, the shots are all fantastic, but the script is horrible and it will ultimately leave a bad taste it anyone's mouth who watches it. If you haven't read the book, the film will easily fly over your head, and if you have read the book, set the bar low going in. Also, don't watch it just for the acting cast, that's the worst form of ""reading a book by its cover"" you can do with this movie.",1473724800,,1829,4.486486486486487
7753809,1,B01G3MFLBQ,"Good luck making it through the singular piece of misery adapted from the 1975 book by British author J.G. Ballard.

Ballards work was the basis for Steven Spielbergs outstanding Empire of the Sun and David Cronenbergs bizarre, Oscar-winning Crash. His work is legitimately dark. Raised in Japanese internment camps during WWII, he lived with the worst humanity had to offer.

Producer Jeremy Thomas has tried to make High-Rise into a film for the past 40 years. It opens on a scene of utter devastation as Tom Hiddlestons Dr. Robert Laing meanders along the hallways of a crumbled apartment building. Hes accompanied by a beautiful, white Siberian Husky. They look like any man and dog pair, but following a few cryptic, human encounters, we find Laing outside, grilling the dogs leg over open flame for dinner.

It is the first death of a companion animal the film has to offer. It isn't the last. Killing pets has become the new trend, possibly why Thomas got the go-ahead on his movie. Those who find this offensive  as I do  should keep out of High-rise. The film has a giant share of graphic murder, torture and rape, too. A young man, tricked into believing hes dying, commits suicide.

Perhaps you had to live in Margaret Thatchers super-conservative England to get it. The film has the look of a dystopian future, with its ruined buildings and scavengers, except this is a dystopian past  of the 70s? It takes a commentary to let us know where we are.
Inhabitants of the new, towering apartment building range from lower middle class  bottom levels  to the excruciatingly rich on the top. Its full of luxuries: spas, a school, its own grocery store. Nothing that seems too special today. Social dysfunction results from a variety of petty gripes and class clashes soon have residents at each others throats. Again, nothing new if you've ever had to deal with a condo or home owners association board.

Still, High-Rise takes the conflict to the extreme without a trace of subtly.

The biggest question is: Why don't they move? The 70s has a rep for being self-indulgent and excessive, but why live in a situation like that if you don't have to? High-Rise would have us believe the buildings chaos is a preferred lifestyle. Initially, those with occupations outside continue to go to their jobs. But, like Dr. Laing, they give it up to live at and among the worst.

The 1080p picture and 5.1 Master Audio soundtrack from Magnet, an imprint of Magnolia Home Entertainment, is generally good. Audio is always clear, with good immersive effects; color, depth and detail occasionally wavers, but is mostly quite sharp. Bonus features include Building the World of High-Rise: 70s Style, Heady Special Effects, Breaking Down High-Rise and Its Tenants, and Bringing Ballard to the Big Screen.
High-rise opened in few U.S. theaters and quickly closed. Many viewers walked out  in Britain and the U.S. Some stayed, hoping it would get better. It doesnt.

Some critics hail it as a dark comedy. The cover blurb has The New York Times calling it a Rollicking, nastily funny apocalyptic romp. Commentary by Hiddleston, director Ben Wheatley and producer Jeremy Thomas support that.

Jeremy Irons is excellent in his role, but he is always excellent in any role he plays...and in my opinion it is his performance that makes this film tolerable.",1473638400,,708,4.535433070866142

Definitely not for the squeamish and to those who don't have an open mind for out of the box cinema.  This movie is a strange trip on a Kubrick and Cronenberg journey to far out land!  I admire Tom Hiddleston and crew for taking a chance on a movie they said could not be done for the silver screen.  Really loving Ben as a new visionary of cinema.  Based on a 1970's novel, the film delves into class warfare and other takes that you can Google on the internet if you get bored.  Again, this film is not for everyone and will offend fragile minds.  To those who want to watch it just because Tom is in it, you may want to research it and have an open mind because this is a very weird and graphic movie.",1472342400,14,871,4.198795180722891
7753820,1,B01G3MFLBQ,"I have to say that I read the original book well before the movie came out.  The book was average at best.  The plot (as it is) sounds very interesting: a divorced doctor (played weirdly by Tom Hiddleton who always seems to have that maniacal smile in most of his movies) moves onto the 25th floor of this bizarre high rise community.  The ""high rise"" is designed so that you never have to leave (the building includes a supermarket, etc.).  The high rise apparently is home to some of the most extremely violent mental ill individuals, with the hard working ""lower"" classes on the bottom and the rich on the top.  Soon after the doctor arrives things go very wrong.  Tenants turn on each other then the plot turns into this violent, muddling convoluted mess.  In the midst of this brutal behavior I couldn't help but wonder why no one calls the police or even tries to escape from the madness.  Hiddleton is supposedly the ""actor to watch out for"", although he has made his share of truly forgettable movies (such as ""I Saw the Light"" which was released after this movie, an incredible dull and boring affair).  Don't waste your time or money, you will be disappointed.",1472256000,2,1170,4.586538461538462
7753821,5,B01G3MFLBQ,"High-Rise is the adaption of JG Ballard's 1975 novel. If you have a crush on LOKI (Tom Hiddleston) from Avengers you will not like this movie. Don't even bother.
If you like dark humor and you enjoyed Bret Easton Ellis' American Psycho you may like this movie. Its not a horror film though. This is a very dark satire that deals with class structure and the peeling away of its fragile facade. It's a bit like a blend of Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut meets Lord of the Flies. Do you have to be familiar with JG Ballard to enjoy this film..probably not. I love his writing, so I am not impartial. High-Rise the film deals with the erosion of technology with in the building in itself and the simultaneous erosion of morality with in the tenants that live there. There are some great performances from Jeremy Irons (Dead Ringers), Elisabeth Moss (Mad Men), Luke Evans (The Hobbit), and Tom Hinddleston (Only Lovers Left Alive)",1471651200,10,927,4.624242424242424
7753822,5,B01G3MFLBQ,"Fantastic movie, one I will watch over and over. Complaints are from people who are not familiar with the book, they perhaps should have checked out Ballards work before buying this. Film is a great adaptation of the descent into chaos that happens in the text, where it is even more extreme and severe.
While Hiddleston is great as the detached Laing, Luke Evans' performance as he goes off the rails is just brilliant.",1471651200,7,420,4.6891891891891895
7753823,1,B01G3MFLBQ,"The film industry has been known to produce some movies that are 'less than stellar' to say the least, and I don't generally feel the urge to write reviews of them, but this particular film is without a doubt the worst, most pointless, thoroughly disgusting piece of garbage to ever have the distinction of making it into the world of actual sales.
I could possibly see this being the product of some student film-maker doing an avant-garde project, but to foist this on an unsuspecting public is a travesty that should be against the laws of common decency.
The only thing I could take away from the experience of having watched this is a degraded sense of hopelessness towards the future of our species.",1471132800,3,705,4.693548387096774

7753826,1,B01G3MFLBQ,"This is one of those ""love it or hate it"" movies. It's based on a cult-favorite book by J.G. Ballard, and apparently people who have read the book enjoyed the movie. Unfortunately, we hadn't, and didn't. It's apparently intended as an allegory of Thatcherite Britain: people live in a high-rise with working people on the lower floors, rich people above them, and the Royal family (get it?) in the penthouse. Everyone behaves strangely and appears to be mentally ill in some way. The residents continually attack each other, both verbally and physically, for no apparent reason (other than general human depravity). I gave up after the first hour. My husband stuck it out to the end and tells me that it didn't get much better.",1470355200,10,727,4.824

7753830,5,B01G3MFLBQ,"Whoever managed to give Ben Wheatley a budget and an all star cast did the cinematic world a huge favor.

""High-Rise"" was a bit much to take in on my first viewing, but my second round really sealed my appreciation. The story takes place in a futuristic high-rise apartment building where everything is provided... schools, shops, pools, and pedestrian spaces. There is something for everyone in the high-rise. It depicts the perhaps inevitable societal breakdown of a culture trapped in a confined space. Thanks to the unique vision of Ben Wheatley, the set of High-Rise is actually a throwback to the 1970s done in what might be considered future for then. Jump's script sums it up with Laing's voice over saying ""Sometimes he found it hard to believe they weren't living in a future that hadn't already taken place"".

This is the kind of movie that really fuels my obsession with cinema. It is surreal, unique, passionate, intellectual, and makes the viewer work for the reward. The acting is beyond reproach, Laurie Rose's cinematography is brilliant, the soundtrack is excellent, and this has to be Amy Jump's best script yet. This movie will be the cult film of tomorrow. I streamed the film because I was too impatient to wait for the theatrical release in May, but I will certainly go see it on a proper screen and will buy the blu for my collection, if for no other reason than to see the film with subtitles.",1468540800,26,1418,4.7368421052631575
