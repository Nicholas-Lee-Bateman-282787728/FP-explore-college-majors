This isn't hi-tech stuff, and don't expect a video production value from Hollywood, but this fun little video shows you EXACTLY how to build mind blowing sand castles.  The video producer steps the viewer through building a really great sand castle from beginning to the end(the usual end for sand castles ha ha).  My family has made a tradition of building sand castles with the kids every beach trip, and as the kids got bigger, so did the sand castles.  But we always just used the cheap plastic molds from the convenience store.  We got very, very good at using the little kiddie molds but I knew we could go no further and the kids were ready for more advanced stuff.  If we wanted to be sand castle masters, we would have to learn the master's techniques.  This video delivered that for us.  We sat down as a family and watched the video in amazement as the secrets to building awesome sandcastles were revealed to us on our TV.  We used to always get compliments on our elaborate sand castles before, but that was mainly due the effort, not the look of the sandcastle.  Now we were going to give them something to really compliment.  Our first spring break trip I swung by a construction site and picked up a discarded 5 gallon bucket which I cut the bottom out of.  We bought some dollar store kitchen utensils and built our first masterpiece that looked very similar to the one from the video.  We improved our sand castles each of the three trips to the beach this past summer.  We would build the castle early in the day, and return at sundown and sit far away and just watch people walk by and admire it.  Very satisfying.",1447113600,3,1654,4.430463576158941
