Being a twin myself, and my birthday close by, it brought tears to my face..
The only time I too, had a big party with my father at 6-8 years old was a joyous
time.  Since then, my life has been filled with much sadness and misery caused
by a cruel mother who wanted only to be rich and show meanness to both me and my twin sister because we are poor..
I jumped for joy when Shyam twin, sang this is a time for happiness and the end of cruel injustice in this home..I have endured 45+years with this miserable
cold hearted evil mother who is loved by all, and can never get away from her because of her influence and hold on everyone in this world.
This movie really uplifed me and for the first time made me feel the joy, and
gladness I felt as a child on my birthday party with my father, who died when I was 9 years old.. I will be 52 years this year with my twin sis and this
movie was a God sent and best present I could ever have..",1316390400,2,1018,3.9901960784313726
