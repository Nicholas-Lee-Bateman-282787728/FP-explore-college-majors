8374840,3,B002N8AQLK,"Not too terrible, but not too great sort of spy adventure.  A collaboration from various countries, West Germany, Austria, Italy, Lebanon, and Hungary. This goulash was filmed in the mid-to-late 60's.  Another Komissar X adventure starring Tony Kendall and Brad Harris.  This time they are after LSD producers and traveling all over dreary looking Middle Eastern countries.  The quality of the DVD-R is rather poor.  The picture is not clear, somewhat blurry, and the color is faded.  Sadly the Sinister Cinema DVD-R is apparently the only version of this film available.  Unlikely that this film will be re-mastered.  Only for fans of this genre.",1516406400,,647,5.153846153846154
8374841,4,B002N8AQLK,"I could not give this movie five stars as it does have some picture and sound drawbacks, but to go away from Sinister Cinema's ""Death Trip"" waiting for a better print if one comes along is futile.  This is not the first case for me where the film source used by Sinister Cinema has color fading and splices and in this instance gaps in picture and sound but is perhaps the best that can be had now.  The films were immensely watchable and I have never felt ripped off by the company as most of the films I've gotten from Sinister Cinema were rare and quite enjoyable.  I am not sure but I think ""Death Trip"" is part of a series of ""Commissar X"" films perhaps similar to Ian Fleming's James Bond but this information is, at present, somewhat sketchy with me.  I do not know what country produced this film but it stars Tony Kendall as ""Jo Walker"" and Brad Harris from a screenplay by and directed by Rudolf Zehetgruber with Angelo Lotti as the Director of Photography and the great Franceso De Masi doing the music.  Editing was by Edmondo Lozzi with special effects by Richard Richtsfeld.  The ""macguffin"" here is LSD and the film I think is set mostly in Istanbul.  It is mostly played tongue-in-cheek and has a lot of comedy and I definitely will watch it over again.  This film is very good, so enjoy it while you can.",1337212800,3,1321,4.385245901639344
8374842,1,B002N8AQLK,"I love the KOMMISSAR X movies and was eagerly awaiting the DVD. Unfortunately, this was pressed from the perhaps the worst master Sinister Cinema could find. The film is scratched, dirty, out-of-focus, and apparently was edited with a pair of scissors by someone with palsy, then reassembled with Elmers glue. Do not buy this DVD. You will be throwing your money away. Somewhere out there is a decent print of DEATH TRIP. This is definitely not it. Sinister Cinema should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this print.",1313193600,7,522,4.943181818181818
