3691168,4,B001LRTTCG,I must admit I was slightly disappointed with this film although that is from a personal perspective. I ran one of the marathons in Vermont with Dean and was totally thrilled to do so. I thought the film for me did not fully represent the excitement I felt while following the actual event(s) in real time. I understand the difficulty of compressing 50 marathons into a 2 hour movie though. So I think for most people it will be a positive and inspirational film to watch. Nothing can take away from Dean's amazing accomplishment.,1238803200,,530,4.648936170212766
3691169,5,B001LRTTCG,"I don't want this to come off as some kind of left handed compliment, but I have to mention that Dean takes a lot of criticism in the ultramarathon world basically because he is so popular but that there are other runners out there who do the same amount of running or even longer or faster. In other words, people say he has marketed himself as this hero of running that he is not. I hope this film puts that argument to rest. Dean is a truly genuine, kind man who loves running for the sake of running and wants to inspire others. He's not a show off, he's not a braggart. He's just truly amazing! So what if he puts himself in the limelight to get his message out?  If he inspires people off the sofa he's done even more than the ultrarunner who peacefully breaks a course record and disappears into oblivion.

On to the film: Truly awesome. I had trouble sitting through the first 20 mins because I am a runner and wanted to get out and run but at the same time was glued to the screen. Dean goes through the first few races, spending 5-10 mins on each, then later shows highlights of some of the tougher days. Toward the end the trail races are shown in more detail and this really peaked my interest. The camerawork is great through the whole film but particularly good on the trail sections. I almost felt like I was right on the heals of the runners.

If I have to give one critism it would be over an injury scene where Dean falls down. I kmow it hurt and it was scary but this part is really dramaticized in the same way as if he had lost a family member along the way. Slow music, camera on the wound...Just a little much. I guess just another attmept to show Dean as a real person.

I'd recommend this to any runner, or anyone thinking about running. I rented it and will now buy it. I'm sure I'll watch before every big race, just like I used to do with Running on the Sun.",1238025600,10,1886,4.173076923076923
3691170,5,B001LRTTCG,"Congrats to producer JB Benna.  In this inspiring DVD, he chronicles Dean Karnazes's 50/50/50 quest.  The DVD is a must buy for anyone interested in hard core fitness, marathoning and ultra-running.  As a gift, one couldn't do much better.",1237766400,,239,5.076923076923077
3691171,5,B001LRTTCG,UltraMarathon Man takes viewers on an emotional journey like no other. We watch as Dean Karnazes attempts to run 50 marathons in 50 states in 50 days. Beyond the physical challenge is the incredible beauty of where he runs and with whom. This film is inspiring for all who dream of doing something seemingly beyond human abilities.,1236988800,2,331,4.824561403508772
3691230,4,B001LRTTCG,"This product meet my expected, positive testimonials and demonstration of victory of people who conquered their goals, beautiful landscapes, and Mr. Dean, that proves to be a simple guy and generous with everyone, even though one is above the average for most human beings in physical strength.

3691233,5,B001LRTTCG,"I was very impressed by this inspirational tale of an endurance athlete. Dean strikes me as one of those people who has never met a stranger. Somehow, Dean managed to turn this amazing feet of endurance running into a story about all of the people he met and his amazing experiences versus a documentary about how tough or great he is personally. I am sure I will watch this many more times over the months and years to come.",1263686400,,425,4.3924050632911396
3691234,3,B001LRTTCG,"I had high hopes for this DVD to be as inspirational as ""Spirit of the Marathon"".  In the end I was waiting for him to finally get done in New York.  While challenging and difficult, I found this to be more of an homage to Dean than as a story of training hard and achieving a difficult challenge. He was pretty laid back, meeting people, and getting used to being a star as he ran marathons across the country. The challenge part of this feat did not come across.",1263254400,5,464,4.202247191011236

3691236,5,B001LRTTCG,"If you know a runner ask them about Dean Karnazes. Everyone has their opinion about him some see him as a role model some do not. I saw this movie before I ever heard anyone debate about Dean. Even if you are not a fan of Dean this is truly an amazing film. This movie follows Dean as he travels around the country to run 50 marathons in 50 days. Some marathons are recreated on the course they take place on at a later date and some are live. Dean invites runners to come out an join him. Heavy rain, injury (Dean takes a pretty bad spill) and even running into a pole do not stop these determined runners. The first few marathons get more screen time and some marathons are recapped due to time constraints. The experience at each marathon is different and Dean meets some truly inspirational runners at these races. This film is not only inspirational but thought provoking. A must see for any runner epically someone cosidering entering a full marathon or an ultra running event.

3691237,5,B001LRTTCG,Very interesting. If you read the book you can actually see the things he tells. It is all true!!! Amazing,1258156800,,106,4.35
3691238,4,B001LRTTCG,"I've read both of Karnazes books, so I was eager to watch his documentary on the Endurance 50.  I was not disappointed as we watch him move through the 50 states, running all the while.  Although not as informative as his books, I found this still fascinating to watch.

Part of the reason I find it fascinating is that I too love to run marathons, so to see this captured on film is always fun to watch.  What was enjoyable was seeing the different types of conditions and courses that were being ran.  I was amazed to see how many times they had to run through pouring rain and yet they just kept on trudging.  The people that ran with Dean made this documentary more interesting as well because you not only get to see what they went through b ut you were able to put yourself in their shoes are relive your most recent marathon.  What this documentary does show a lot of is the logistics of accomplishing something like this just as much as the actual running.

That being said I was a little disappointed at times.  At times I wished we would hear more from Dean on the actual running part of the E50, whereas we saw more of Dean talking about the media and travelling and so on.  Which doesn't necessarily degrade the documentary since this was what was set out to do, but more running wisdom interspersed throughout from such an accomplished runner would have added a lot more flavor.  Additionally, there were a ton of marathons that were glossed over with nothing more than a screenshot and the name of the marathon.  Wish we would have seen more of these, even if it was some more shots of the course and the scenery.

I would definitely recommend this to any runner.  One last suggestion, when you watch it do not turn the Simstat (sp?) on, because at times you jump from marathon to marathon so fast that you are constantly having to flip back and forth with only seconds between the documentary and the stats for that marathon.  I found the flow to be much better when you run it on normal.

4 stars.",1257638400,,2013,4.4
3691239,5,B001LRTTCG,"Trying to write a review for something there are no words for is kinda hard.  Just watch this.  See what this man can do.  See what you can do if you just put a little work into it.  Your body will reward you.  Life will reward you.  You'll see things more clearly.  This DVD doesn't just focus on Dean's great feat of 50 marathons in 50 days; it focuses on the one marathon individual people are running with Dean.  This can not be stressed enough.  Dean never loses focus on each person trying to obtain a personal goal, finishing their first, a best time, running their 2nd, 3rd, 15th.  It doesn't matter, Dean knows what it take a person to run one and that is the focus of this DVD.  Buy to see the individual stories.  Buy it to be inspired by the one race, not intimidated by the 50.  Dean does what he does well, we each have something we do well, this is a way to expand that, get better all around or just push our bodies for a little something more and prove we are not stuck where we currently are in life.  I'd write more, but i gotta go run.",1239840000,,1055,4.107843137254902

8319734,5,B001LRTTCG,"Some people are just made different.  Dean Karnazes makes that point in this video: it's all about choosing your parents well.  Karnazes's ultrarunning feats astound anyone who's heard of him, and many have.  He's been featured on countless news shows, talk shows, published a couple of books, and run in races all around the world.  It's easy to look at him as a hero.

UltraMarathon Man chronicles one of his many bold feats: he ran, as the title suggests, a marathon in all 50 states over the course of 50 days, culminating in the New York Marathon.  Some of the marathons were organized races.  Most were put together by his crew, in which case they followed the course of the host city's established marathon.  Through the grapevine and his blog, Karnazes gathered a group to run with him at each site, sometimes hundreds of people, in one case only one.

One thing that struck me while watching this was how much fun it must be to run with Karnazes.  I have heard criticism of him as a self-centered self-promoter, but none of that came across in this video.  He shows lots of interest in the people he runs with, and shows genuine humility when people express their admiration.  He promotes not himself, but activity, exercise, getting people off the couch, fighting childhood obesity and general inactivity.  Who can argue with that?

This feat, running 50 marathons in 50 days, has been replicated, probably by a number of people.  Karnazes does it right, though, with great support and planning, getting to every state in 50 days.  It's hard not be inspired by him. For someone who runs the occasional marathon, you have to ask, can I do more?  For someone who's never run one, you have to ask, why not try it?  Before I get too excited, though, Karnazes reminds me that his body chemistry and genetic make up have enabled him to have an extraordinary level of endurance.  Can I get there through nutrition and training?  That's the big question.  But after watching this movie, you'll be inspired at least to think about it!",1343779200,3,2035,4.692090395480226
