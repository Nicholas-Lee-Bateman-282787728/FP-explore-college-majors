2597376,5,B000G1ALI4,"Margot Scholz is truely one of the great ballroom teachers. Everybody should take a lesson with Margot just to see how expertly she spots problems and how fast she can fix them. Anybody who takes a lesson with Margot is in for a real treat...and now you can have her on video.

If you're a beginner just starting out, this DVD is a great tool. Even if you're not a beginner, the way Margot explains this material can fill in some gaps your beginner teacher perhaps forgot to mention. It covers a lot of begninner material but don't let this fool you that it is not good. Margot precisely mentions EXACTLY what you are to do. In contrast a lot of other videos of teachers leave the student guessing as nothing is explained well...or the footwork is sloppy.

One of the mistakes of beginners is not getting the right foundation before moving on to the more complicated material. If you were dancing solo, this would be tolerable....but ballroom/latin dancing takes two people and if you're not grounded in the basics, its a real problem of ""the blind leading the blind"". So its best to go slowly and pick up the basics to as much completion as possible. In this manner this video will help. You can rewind and fast forward and you'll find the material expertly and preceisely presented.

Happy dancing!!",1165017600,45,1301,4.623376623376624
2597377,4,B000G1ALI4,"This is very well done and easy to follow. For each dance covered it provides the very basic step sequences and demonstrations. It won't make anyone an expert, but will make you quite capable of dancing the most fundamental steps.",1368662400,2,230,4.775
2597378,5,B000G1ALI4,This is a great dvd for the beginner - easy to understand. Excellent for use in the privacy of your own home :) Will soon be looking for the advanced version!,1364947200,2,158,4.129032258064516
2597379,5,B000G1ALI4,"Easy to understand instructions even for a person who can tell which is the right foot, which is the left one.  Highly recommend it.",1362960000,2,132,4.5
2597380,5,B000G1ALI4,"We are taking ballroom dancing from Margot & purchased this DVD for practicing during the week.  It's such a compliment to her classes.  One could honestly learn to dance from the DVD alone.  It is very clearly illustrated, precise & easily understood.  I would recommend getting this DVD whether you are a beginner dance student taking classes or learning solely from the DVD.  EXCELLENT product.",1359936000,4,397,5.046153846153846
2597381,4,B000G1ALI4,"Excellent DVD showing the steps for 6 different dances from several viewpoints.  This gives the beginner a better idea of how the steps look and work.  It also has some practice music in the last half of the video.  Best dance lesson video I have seen so far.  Includes variations and embellishments for each step.

2597382,5,B000G1ALI4,"There's not much more to say about this DVD. I read a few of the reviews of the product before I bought it, which all influenced my decision to buy.
The reviews were accurate and the DVD did what it set out to do. If the producers have more along this line for advanced classes I will also get them with a great deal of confidence that I am getting what I want.
The only negative aspect was that it took five weeks to get here in Perth Australia.",1324598400,3,446,4.022471910112359
2597383,4,B000G1ALI4,"Ballrood Dancing is an instructional DVD on the traditional dances such as Swing, Rumba, Cha-Cha, Waltz, and Fox Trot. The program runs about 68 minutes. The instructor is  Margot Scholz and she teaches both the mens' and womens' steps but starting with the mens' first.

The instruction is clear with which steps to take and the count also. The camera zooms to her feet periodically while she is performing her steps. Behind Margot, there is a small troop of older people dressed traditionally and ready to perform the particular dance after Margot does her initial instructions.

As a side note, I want to point out that this appears to be a pretty old program. The graphics and picture quality looks like a VHS copy from the late 80's. The music, style of clothing, and overall feel of this program is a bit unexciting.

But aside from that, the main point of this program is the dance instruction and this part delivers. Being on DVD, it's easier to skip ahead in case you want to try Waltz instead of Rumba, for example. Better with a partner to get the true feel of a dance.",1297209600,7,1080,4.580310880829016
2597384,4,B000G1ALI4,Most dance videos I've seen do not teach dancing accurately. This video on the other hand is correct according to every standard of dance I've learned. The only thing I have a problem with is that the teacher is not very clear about what count (in the music) that you should start on. Most dances you start on the one-count but in the Rumba and the Cha-cha you should start on the two-count and the teacher does not tell you this. The teacher is very clear about how to step and how many counts should be in each step. She teaches from the gentleman's perspective to start and then shows the ladies footwork. She allows sufficient time to practice the steps one by one and then at the end of each dance all the steps are put together. I highly recommend this for any beginner who wants a solid foundation in the basics of Ballroom dancing.,1270166400,9,839,4.384615384615385
2597385,4,B000G1ALI4,"This video really breaks down the steps and the instructor is very talented and graceful.  The problem is: she teaches the male steps and tells the female do just do the reverse which is not as easy as it may seem.  Plus, it looks like someone shot it with a handheld camera.",1190332800,17,275,4.269230769230769
2597386,4,B000G1ALI4,"The video was just what I was looking for for my granddaughter.

The only problem was the rhumba.  It was shown differently than how I was taught and I prefer the way I was taught when I took lessons at Arthur Murray Studios.

When she learns these dances, I will get her the next edition.",1180396800,6,289,4.218181818181818

8128302,4,B000G1ALI4,"Probably made 30 years ago, but who cares if you see the dance steps- they haven't changed! Didnt have a couple of dances we would have liked to have learned, but this worked well in conjunction with the 5 private lessons we had- we could use the DVD to help us remember what we had learned in the classes.",1499472000,,306,4.203389830508475
8128303,5,B000G1ALI4,Margo Schultz is so fast and efficient at demonstrating and then allowing us to practice each sequence of steps. This video really helped me get a beginners grasp better than any other videos (purchased or on youtube).,1497398400,,218,4.918918918918919

8128307,5,B000G1ALI4,"This DVD is perfect for someone who is just beginning BallRoom dancing and is a great review tool for those who have been dancing 6 months to a year.  I recommend this video to anyone I meet who is just starting.  I was taking Ballroom Classes (group), and getting nowhere.  I found this DVD at the public library and checked it out.  My Ballroom Teacher was astonished at how I caught on to the basics after watching this DVD.  I found the DVD on Amazon and ordered it.  I have not seen a video that teaches the basics of foxtrot, swing, cha cha, waltz and bolero Rumba any better than this one!!!!",1429315200,,599,4.303571428571429
8128308,5,B000G1ALI4,"Purchased this for my Father who is 83 and getting back into dancing.  He likes it, and he's starting to get his Fred Astair on.",1407974400,2,128,4.12
8128309,4,B000G1ALI4,"Excellent for the beginner.

Its a little fast paced, but the advantage is that you can go back and view the steps over and over.

Can recommend.

Note this is a DVD set to USA Region only in NTSC.",1378857600,,197,4.0
