8376983,5,B002PHD9CW,"this is even better than the Frozen Alive dvd that came out 2 years prior !  the sound quality is immense and the setlist is awesome. If you are a fan of Obituary , I can't recommend this dvd enough . Watch the band tear through 16 songs from their entire discography from the epic Slowly We Rot to the Left To Die ep . Features Ralph Santolla on guitar and former bassist Frank Watkins . One of the highlights is an awesome drum solo from Donald Tardy complemented by a flashy guitar solo from Santolla. Bonus features include additional stage footage and a recording of the band practicing in the garage . Nearly 30 years old , Obituary have not lost their powerful live presence !",1419120000,2,683,4.377952755905512
8376984,5,B002PHD9CW,"The music set is well thought out.  Each new song is titled, to help the new comers with song names.  Also, the video and sound quality is excellent.  If you can't make it to a Obituary concert, my guess is this is the next best thing.  For the drummers out there, minute 50 of the video starts the drummers solo.  Man this guy is good!  He keeps the crowd going, just when you thought it was over....at minute 54 the guitarist comes out to jam too.  A must buy!",1287446400,5,462,4.123595505617978
