7919278,5,B00003OSSW,I Love the Garlic jr Saga For many reasons but the biggest one is that for the first time you see the Z Fighters in Action and Fighting to their fullest power Without Goku to step in and do all the work. I like Goku But it gets really old when he is always the Hero. It Is fun to see him be the main Hero in some of the sagas but it is WAAAAAAAAAY better to see the Whole Team of Z Fighters at Work on the Villains because all their powers are matched up and it is all the Z Fighters in the fight going toe to toe standing face to face and clashing fist to fist with a new clip load of villains whos' powers are matched up with the Z Fighters with the villains out to destory the earth. This is one of the best sagas of DBZ EVER and the only saga without Goku comming to the rescue. It's everyman for himself and everyone (the villains and the heros) are powered up to the Max and ready to Bring It On Because there is no Strongest fighter and a bunch of weak fighters. Everyone is the Strongest Fighter and the  Strongest one of the Strongest is the last man standing when the dust clears.,1051056000,,1090,3.9771689497716896
7919279,4,B00003OSSW,"well if youve ever watched the movie special ""Dead Zone"" then you know who garlic jr is because i think Akira  wanted to add a litte something extra to kill time or otherwise. well basically galic comes back and tried to take the guardian status away from Kami. of cource thats where our young hero Gohan and Krillin comes in. its rather good as far as the DBZ episodes go. if you own any previous ones, then you should own this one. actually you gotta like DBZ enough to own any of its DVD episodes so be sure you catch this one",1031443200,,529,4.186274509803922
7919280,2,B00003OSSW,"I suppose some people who are into DBZ will like any tape that comes out but this one was just kind of boring.  The action wasn't the best and the  villian just wasn't as threatening as some of the others you have seen on  DBZ.  This was lacking the normal DBZ content where you get to really know  characters, Garlic Jr. was just proved to be annoying.  Even when Vegita  was fighting in the Saiyan Saga you had to say ""He's pretty  cool..."" or like with Freeza you just hated him so much you wanted him  to die but with Garlic Jr it's just boring.",967852800,,549,4.152380952380953
7919281,3,B00003OSSW,"This saga was really short, lasting only a couple of episodes.  Although it was kinda nice to see a lot more action with Piccolo, Gohan and Krillin, because Goku had just defeated the previously strongest fighter in the  universe.
The plot needed some more development, and you won't really  know much about Garlic Jr. unless you view the film ""Dead Zone"",  which explains a lot about his past and why he wants revenge on  Gohan.
Otherwise, this saga is okay, for the Trunks saga follows this  one.",963187200,,498,4.666666666666667
7919282,5,B00003OSSW,This video is the best one out of DBZ videos iv seen. Like the other person said i cant wait till the next one. The spice boys can be hard but can they beat them? Can they spread the sacred water in time? You will just  have to find out. Plus the preview of Trunks is awsome.,950918400,2,275,3.824561403508772
7919283,1,B00003OSSW,"Well...here we are with the second volume of a 10-episode arc that really serves no purpose to the plot of the series. It's not present in the comics, Goku's not present, all of the heroes seem a lot weaker than they should be...there's a lot wrong with these episodes, but I won't get into everything here. Suffice it to say that they really aren't worth watching in Japanese, let alone English. While the later Afterlife Tournament has some redeeming qualities despite its plot holes, these episodes just reek of filler pointlessness.
You're better off just skipping to the Trunks episodes. Preferably on DVD.",950832000,,611,4.941747572815534
