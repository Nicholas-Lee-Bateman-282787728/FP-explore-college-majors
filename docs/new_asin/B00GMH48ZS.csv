8624586,3,B00GMH48ZS,"More Eurotrash drivel from hack poseuse Liliana Cavani. Should've known, but Clementi was such a great presence. Too bad this wheel-sputtering vehicle squanders him, although it does serve to document an era of overregarded auteurism. H. Steele",1401062400,3,244,5.621621621621622
8624587,4,B00GMH48ZS,"In an unspecified Italian city, the fascist government in power assassinates rebels or enemies of the state and lets their bodies lie where they were killed. Wanting the bodies to set an example to those who question the government's authority, citizens are forbidden from removing or burying the bodies under penalty of prison or even death. If the narrative sounds familiar, Liliana Cavani (THE NIGHT PORTER) has updated Sophocles' ANTIGONE into a political fable about a new generation's revolt against the repressive bourgeois government state. Cavani lacks nuance in her approach however and while the film is interesting (mostly in its visuals), it's a bit oppressive and obvious in her execution. The film looks great with its slightly futuristic feel (it was filmed in Milan) and Giulio Albonico's images of everyday citizens shopping or going to work on sidewalks and streets littered with corpses are impressive. Britt Ekland (THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN) as Antigone gets a role that uses her as an actress (she's good) rather than decoration. The score is typical Ennio Morriocne, meaning both original yet often annoying. With Pierre Clementi as a Christ like figure, Tomas Milian, Delia Boccardo and Francesco Leonetti.

The DVD from Raro Video is a nice anamorphic wide screen (2.35) transfer.",1394928000,6,1308,5.228571428571429
