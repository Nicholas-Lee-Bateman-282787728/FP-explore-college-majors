8305180,3,B000NK0QFG,"Image quality for Lubtisch film wretched.  Soundtrack good.  Still--of interest to film history buffs and Lubitsch fans who want to see early (1918)Lubitsch efforts.  (His underlying talent shows.)  Also, Pola Negri performance is captivating despite severe shortcomings of image quality..",1481155200,,289,6.15
8305181,3,B000NK0QFG,"I read both of the reviews (the only two reviews that were posted) before I bought the DVD. The picture seemed alright. If you go on youtube and try to watch it, it looks very blurry, but if you buy the DVD you can easily see the difference in visuality. I could make out everything. It was alright for a silent film made in 1918. The person on the first review who spoke about the visuality might have been talking about youtube or some other DVD version. The movie is good and if you like the story of Carmen you will enjoy it.",1331769600,4,529,4.145631067961165

Why I express this in terms of uncertainty has to do with the quality of the DVD. It was copied from sources that cry out for restoration!  There are many scenes that art (from a technical perspective) is unintentionally imitating life--it's a blur.  Too many scenes are basically unwatchable, a real disappointment for Pola Negri appreciators trying to connect with her body of work.  If the viewer puts forth imagination & serious viewing effort, you can ""feel"" her talent & artistry coming through, despite the almost overwhelming limitations of film deterioration.  You also get a perspective of how film work in general was handled during this early period. Many directors have still not learned to incorporate good crowd scenes into their story line, and this one is no exception.  The plot & motivation are simple, the Carmen story:  poor & ""exotic"" woman connects with rich ""high-born"" man ""already taken"" & the complexities that are expected flow.  Pola Negri makes this common-place stuff interesting because of her interpretive skill @ going beyond simple, surface dimensions.  Too bad we cannot see her artistry  better in this film!  Again, my soapbox, why her career is not being showcased in the few venues that permit a wide public viewing--well?  Maybe we can have a Long Distance Bicycle Ride That Benefits Silent Film Restoration (LDBRTBSFR--splendid acronym!  Knew if I lived long enough I'd add something to the Oxford English Dictionary!).  Seriously, this one could be a poster child for the cause of Silent Film Era Restoration.  Enjoy it if you can see it!",1273276800,8,1786,5.443636363636363
8305183,4,B000NK0QFG,"German director Ernst Lubitsch's CARMEN (aka ""Gypsy Blood"") is one of his and Polish-born Pola Negri's earliest surviving photoplays. Based on Prosper Merimee's famous work, this is the tragic story of a Spanish cavalryman and the gypsy girl who steals his heart.

Also included is a related Charlie Chaplin two-reeler, THE VAGABOND. Chaplin produced, scripted, directed and starred in this comedy. The story: A street musician (Chaplin) falls in love with a gypsy girl (Purviance). Charlie's convinced that his sweetheart prefers an artist who painted her portrait. The girl's mother, now a wealthy woman, takes her daughter to live with her in the country but Chaplin thinks she's abandoned him for the painter.

The next oldest Negri/Lubitsch collaboration available on DVD is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PASSION/dp/B000NK2690/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PASSION</a>&nbsp;(""Madame DuBarry"") from 1919. This co-stars the great Emil Jannings.
