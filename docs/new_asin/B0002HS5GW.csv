2098477,5,B0002HS5GW,"I bought this for my children because I love Halloween and I loved the pictures.  I thought it would be something I'd like my children to see.  I was right. I have two children, ages 4 and 5, and they were totally absorbed in the DVD. It had a nice theme (that all pumpkins (therefore children) are all alike).  I liked that.  The pictures were adorable, and I especially loved the male narrator's voice.  It was wonderful entertainment for my children.",1092873600,2,453,4.54320987654321
8028060,5,B0002HS5GW,bought for grand kids who live out of town I am sure they will love it its a halloween present,1380499200,,94,3.75
8028061,1,B0002HS5GW,"I bought this for my children and they couldn't get through it. It is very dull and basically just a book being read outloud. I wish I had read these reviews before buying it. I recommend ""Spookley The Square Shaped Pumpkin"" instead. My kids loved that DVD. It was much more interesting, and cheaper, than this boring book read aloud DVD.",1170201600,,338,4.557377049180328
8028062,1,B0002HS5GW,"Wish I had seen the boring review before I purchased the DVD for my 4 year old grandaughter.  I was expecting a movie with a read along book ( guess I didn't read close enough)  My granddaugher loves books and movies , but this was neither and was boring. I didn't enjoy even listening to the story myself.  Was overpriced considering the DVD Spookley is so much better.  She begs this to be read to her and to watch the movie.  Was a waste of $$$$ in my opinion.",1163376000,,463,4.157303370786517
8028063,1,B0002HS5GW,For $20 this is WAY overpriced.  The narration is either boring with no expression - or sounds like the reader is rushing through it.  Buy Spookley the Square Pumpkin for half the price and twice the entertainment.,1160611200,,214,4.756756756756757
8028064,5,B0002HS5GW,My child loves this dvd.  She watches it all of the time.  Very entertaining.,1130198400,,77,4.428571428571429
8028065,5,B0002HS5GW,"I recently purchased this dvd for my 3 kids (ages 2, 4, and 8).  All of them thought it was fantastic.  My youngest ones watched it repeatedly.  My oldest also loved the pictures and the story.  It was worth the purchase! I highly recommend it.",1130198400,2,244,4.355555555555555
8028066,5,B0002HS5GW,My son showed this to his second grade class and they all loved it - including his teacher.  This is a great movie for all ages,1130198400,,127,3.8846153846153846
8028067,2,B0002HS5GW,I was not as impressed with the graphics as I had hoped.  Also my son doen'st like to watch it.,1128816000,,95,3.75
8028068,5,B0002HS5GW,"This clever, fun to read-along and `nice to look at' dvd makes it one of my favorites for the Halloween season.  It's nice to see a genre that is usually focused on the scary element redirected to something the kids can relate to as well as learn from.  After playing this at a birthday party for my son, I was surprised to see the kind of attention demonstrated by the kids.  I wish I could get that attention when it comes to chores!

Good dvd to own and play for all your young ones.",1095811200,4,486,4.138297872340425
8028069,5,B0002HS5GW,"This is perfect for the little ones that are too young for the scarier stuff.  It makes a great gift since there isn't much on the market for Halloween season.  You could also show it at children's Halloween party.  Wonderful, vivid images and a positive message.  I highly recommend this to round out your holiday video collection.",1095724800,3,332,4.771929824561403
