4641843,5,B005AU8M9G,I don't buy tv show dvds but this is one I have to have!  I laugh every time I watch this show. Worth every penny.,1342137600,12,114,3.56
4641844,5,B005AU8M9G,"I live in the US but my mum introduced me to Miranda when I went home and the show is brilliant. Its so funny, really good physical comedy. Shes big (6'1""), in her mid 30s with a nightmare mother who's desperate for her to get married. She talks to the camera too which is really funny (letting us in to what shes thinking in embarrassing situations). I love it. If you liked Peep show/Faulty Towers/IT crowd you'll love this - I guess its just very British!",1340496000,21,458,4.337209302325581

4641857,5,B005AU8M9G,"This is one of the funniest shows I've seen lately.  Miranda Hart, who is all but unknown in the U.S. (except by fans of the BBC ""Call the Midwife"" series) is considered a national treasure in the United Kingdom, and it's easy to see why.  The title character is a tall, large and often ungainly woman who finds herself in a variety of comical (and often embarrassing) circumstances.  But what makes the show so good is that it's almost impossible NOT to like Miranda, and to identify with her on some level.

Yes, it often devolves into slapstick; and, yes, sometimes the humor is a bit tacky and risque.  But it's pure fun, and the cast members seem to be having such a good time that they carry you right along with them.

It's a given that some of the best TV shows in the U.S. are British imports.  That said, this very British and very funny show still hasn't made it here, and still isn't available on DVD for the U.S. (except for those of us who own region free DVD players, which I highly recommend!)  I have no idea why, but I hope Miranda Hart continues with this series for a long time to come.",1401580800,2,1106,4.309178743961352
4641858,5,B005AU8M9G,"but I fell in love with Miranda Hart as ""Chummy"" on ""Call The Midwife""  and just had to see what else she's been in.  I watched this series on a free tv site, but will definitely be purchasing all three seasons.  I watched 18 eps. in less than 3 days, they were so addicting.  Absolutely hilarious, charming, and endearing.  The whole cast is splendid, as is the writing - it's just a top-notch series altogether, that I will be sure to watch many more times through.  Can't believe we have to wait 'til at least 2015 to find out the results of the cliff-hanger, but it was rather a no-brainer anyway. :)",1397779200,,604,4.348214285714286
4641859,5,B005AU8M9G,"We were introduced to Miranda Hart through the series, ""Call the Midwife"".
She through force of personality is the funniest lady we have ever seen.
We have purchased all three seasons and are enjoying each and every moment.
The only thing missing is more full frontal..........",1397347200,,277,5.043478260869565
4641860,5,B005AU8M9G,I was on youtube when I first saw the tv show Miranda. I am hooked. I Love it!! Can't wait until I order series 3.,1396051200,,114,3.6
4641861,5,B005AU8M9G,Miranda is really funny and makes me laugh a lot and I really llkv her she is tall and funny,1386374400,,92,3.65
4641862,5,B005AU8M9G,"Like many others, I was introduced to Miranda Hart as ""Chummy"" in 'call the midwife'.  For me ""Chummy"" made the show endearing and funny.  One night when I was suppose to do many other things I decided to procrastinate a little by looking Miranda Hart on youtube.  2 hours later I was laughing out loud and had tears in my eyes... I found the 'Miranda the series' clips and I was hooked.
I was not able to see complete clips in youtube and purchased the region 2 format of the DVD (I would have purchased it anyway...)  I have a multi-region DVD player so the fact that this DVD is a region 2, and the US is region 1 was not an issue for me, but... I do think that this is not an option for most people and it would be fantastic if PBS, BBC America, or Comedy Central would buy this show and show it to the US audience.  This is funny stuff!  ""Such fun!""
Miranda Hart is an excellent writer and a performer.  The British Humor works well even across the Atlantic Ocean.  Definitely worth your attention!",1377388800,6,1003,4.242105263157895
4641863,5,B005AU8M9G,Really Great Series! Hilariously Funny! Each episode will have you in fits of laughter! Definitely a fave series of mine!,1376352000,,121,5.1
4641864,5,B005AU8M9G,"I admit I'm here on false pretences--although this show IS as described by so many worthy--praisworthy reviewers, and deserves five stars all the way. What surprises me is the huge amount of people writing here on Prime,, who could NOT enjoy their British DVD purchases because the 'Warnings/advising' by Amazon Prime, was clearly insufficient to avoid purchasing a product, that was NOT suitable for regular US use. My advice to all customers is to make your disappointing experience known to them, in no uncertain terms. The odd complaint will not be effective. Suggest that the details of the DVDs REGION number, be made very clear at every stage of the purchasing process. maybe, this will prevent further disappointment.

4641878,5,B005AU8M9G,"If you haven't discovered Miranda yet, give her a try.  I laugh until I was in pain.

One thing to be aware of if you buy this, it is Region 2, so it will not play on standard U.S. DVD players.  I kept seeing that problem with different DVDs I wanted.  It finally occurred to me to check and I discovered that I could buy an All Region DVD player from Amazon, starting at less than $27!  I promptly did and have been enjoying my British flicks ever since!.",1367452800,10,456,4.078651685393258
4641879,5,B005AU8M9G,"Hysterical series.  I also loved her is ""call the midwife'.  If you do not have a universal DVD player be sure to buy one if you buy this DVD because it's not formatted to play on U.S. formatted DVDs.  To know her is to love her.  You can search for her interviews on You Tube if you don't know this wonderful British Actor comedian.  She has amazing presence, she's witty, quick as a flash, sensitive and sentimental but can be searing and sarcastic.",1364256000,,451,4.385542168674699

4641882,1,B005AU8M9G,"I thought I was being re-a-l-l-l-l-l-y careful when I ordered this, but apparently none of these discs are compatible with US DVD players.  I just love watching Miranda on PBS and am very sorry to know I can't just watch them whenever I need a large dose of fun.  This is my first mis-order and unfortunately they were forwarded to me while I'm out of the country so I can't return them in time.  Guess I'll have to gift them to someone with the correct DVD player who can enjoy them.",1362614400,,484,4.2967032967032965
4641883,4,B005AU8M9G,"This video was great !  The only  problem was that I could only watch it a few times.....then it would not work.
I do not know what happened but it looks like I cannot watch it again.
I bought the DVD so I COULD watch it whenever I wanted to but that does not seem possible .
It  would have been worth the money.if it played many more times.
The sound and picture quality was great.
Miranda Hart is a wonderful actress. Lots of slapstick, physical humor, and I loved it when she looks at the camera as though she only talking to you.",1362528000,,533,4.105769230769231
4641884,1,B005AU8M9G,Love Miranda but no longer offered by my local PBS stations.  So ordered it only to have it deliverd and CANNOT play it as Eurpoean dvd VS USA player.  Now I have the disks and can do nothing with them.,1360713600,,202,4.025
4641885,3,B005AU8M9G,Didn't like the canned laughter and the humor is a bit over the top. I'd like to see her  treated with more sensitivity.,1360368000,,120,4.217391304347826
