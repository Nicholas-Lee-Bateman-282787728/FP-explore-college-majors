5675949,5,B00BURN0GI,"Continuing to police the bloodiest beat in London, we see the appearance of an agent provocateur apparently responsible, encouraging vicious villains to commit crime.  DS Miles'  instincts & street wisdom  begins to pinpoint the individual acting as the agent provocateur not only infiltrating the police station to commit psychological intimidation & sabotage there but also appearing unchanged through the years, influencing the horrible criminals.",1396828800,,450,6.0
5675950,5,B00BURN0GI,"If ever a successful TV programme had to keep reinventing itself it is Whitechapel as anyone who has seen the previous seasons will appreciate. To its credit, we are now on the fourth series and each has been fascinating as a study in the dark side of human behaviour. The first two series were about Jack the Ripper and the Kray Twins respectively, which are the only two crimes which most would associate with the Whitechapel area of London. We then moved on to two part stories for the third series, based on historical crimes which would not be widely known, but nonetheless were true crimes, details of which could easily be googled.

This series, however, again consists of 3 two part stories but these are based on rather gruesome crimes with medieval overtones of torture, rather than specific historical crimes, although Buchan usually manages to come up with some precedents. For example, the second tale which was probably the grisliest, involved a series of murders where the murderer specialised in flaying the faces from the bodies of his victims. This series is, on balance, probably a little more gruesome than what went before and there are definite supernatural overtones which were not present in previous series. It certainly retains the ability to shock and makes for dark but absorbing viewing.

Rupert Penry-Jones and Philip Davis are convincing DI Chandler and DS Miles, although their relationship remains less than harmonious on occasion since they are often not on the same wavelength. However, in many ways they do complement each other. Chandler himself often appears on the edge and at times close to a breakdown. Edward Buchan, played by Steve Pemberton, is the expert in historical crimes who is usually able to come up with the historical parallels which help to solve the crimes.

I imagine that Whitechapel is set to be with us for some while which is really good news. Dark it certainly is and probably not for the squeamish, but it all makes for great entertainment.",1392681600,15,2003,4.920118343195266
5675951,3,B00BURN0GI,an excellent series  hopefully there are more coming  the first 3 series were released in the U.S.  why not this one,1390694400,3,116,4.428571428571429
5675952,5,B00BURN0GI,"If any show deserves credit for breaking free of its original formula and striving to remain fresh and innovative, it's ""Whitechapel"". It began as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/a-three-part-mini-series/dp/B005G172Q8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">a three part mini-series</a>, postulating what it would happen if the contemporary police force had to solve the mystery of Jack the Ripper. Using modern methods and historical precedence, old veteran Ray Miles and inexperienced, overpromoted Joe Chandler put aside their differences in order to hunt a copy-cat killer through the streets of Whitechapel.

Fast-forward to season four, and you'll find that the storylines, format and even the genre has shifted into something quite different. For the first two seasons ""Whitechapel"" was a fairly straightforward crime drama, whereas season three veered more into crime horror, with a range of macabre murders and the barest trace of unexplainable ghostly phenomena at work.

With season four, we've fully entered the Gothic genre, with all the staple characteristics and themes you'd expect: unexplainable supernatural occurrences, loss of identity, the onset of paranoia, the questioning of whats real and what isnt, and a shift away from the usual police procedural to include an added emphasis on each individual in the team as they undergo their own personal hauntings.

The characters are as strong as ever: by now Miles and Chandler have become a tight duo (the former is the only one who can help the latter with his crippling OCD tendencies)  and they're backed up by the over-enthusiastic historian Ed Buchan, who provides unpaid research out of self-importance and sheer love for the investigative process. There's also Kent, a young investigator who may or may not be in love with Chandler, the womanizing and irresponsible Mansell, who begins dating the hitherto unknown twin sister of Kent, and Megan Riley, the only woman on the team who is beginning to feel the strain of balancing work and home, as well as the men's unspoken assumption that she'll automatically be the one to comfort bereaved victims.

There are three cases altogether, each one divided into two episodes. The first has the team discover a tramp who has died as a result of 16th century torture, the peine forte et dure (in which a person is pinned down and has heavy stones piled upon him). This is followed by the discovery of an elderly woman burnt at the stake in her back garden, and the team realize that someone is hunting and executing witches in Whitechapel.

Written by actor Steve Pemberton (who plays Ed Buchan), the second case involves a grisy discovery of flayed skin in a museum, with a murderer who seems to take a certain interest in people who have eluded justice. Finally, the third case has the team in disarray as they uncover a disembodied corpse in the sewage tunnels. More are still to follow, with various organs removed, and it is Buchan who hesitantly suggests the possibility of cannibalism.

But throughout all these episodes is a subtle thread that connects them all, one that takes season four into darker waters than anything we've previously seen. Early on, Chandler is approached by a rouge MI5 agent who insists that all the grisly crimes that take place in Whitechapel have been engineered by a provocateur: a dark force that incites otherwise ordinary people to commit heinous acts against other men and women. Naturally Chandler dismisses this accusation, but the audience is privy to scenes of a recurring figure in the background of certain shots, a little old lady quietly watching and seemingly waiting as the team go about their business. She first appears at a book-signing for Buchan's new book, approaching each member of the team and engaging them in conversation that prys open their deepest fears.

Like a spell has been placed upon them, all five members of the investigative team are beset by anxiety and paranoia, and it's only by pulling together and facing their fears that they have a chance to finally catch the perpetrators.

Between this strain of the supernatural and the grisy nature of the cases, it can make for quite a harrowing viewing experience! Everything is designed to be as creepy and unsettling as possible, from the unexplained scar on an MI5 agent's neck, to the accurate predictions of a police psychic, to the growing sense of demonic powers at work throughout the station.

Of course, some may not like this marked switch into the paranormal. If you were to watch this season immediately after the first, you'd find that it feels like a completely different show, and if there is one unnecessarily element, it's that this season really ramps up the grisliness. Whereas the first season was incredibly restrained in its depiction of death and murder, often implying rather than showing the results that serial killers left in their wake, season four has no qualms about giving the audience lengthy mortuary scenes, grisly slow-motion murder sequences, and plenty of slow-motion pans over blood and gore. Heck, even the bursting of a pus-filled blister is shot in extreme close-up. It gets a bit much sometimes and is certainly not for the squeamish.

But I applaud the writers and producers for realizing that the show's initial premise (copy-cat killings) had a limited shelf-life and that they weren't afraid to take their storylines and characters into very different territory. Sadly, it would seem that this is to be the final season of ""Whitechapel"", with ITV declining to commission any further episodes.

That it all ends on something of cliff-hanger may frustrate many, especially since the element of the paranormal (and more importantly, the team's *realization* of its existence) served to re-galvanise the show and promise a range of new supernaturally-themed cases for the future. Hopefully the Powers That Be will realize their mistake and at least give the writers a chance to wrap things up properly in one last mini-series. If it ends like this it'll be on a suitably eerie note, but there are still plenty of plot-threads left dangling, and the actors especially deserve some sense of closure on such compelling and likeable characters.

Also keep in mind that this is a British show, so check the region of the DVDs before purchasing anything.",1385510400,69,6360,5.157129000969932
5675953,1,B00BURN0GI,"I am an avid fan of British detective shows but it is because they are written for smart people. This one is so dumbed-down. Take a minute to pay attention to the dialogue and you will see what I mean. I really like the actors but I bet they felt the same way. Also, if you enjoy horrific violence, then watch on, but if you don't much care for watching people being skinned and disemboweled, then take my advice and find another British show to watch. There are oodles of much better ones.",1522108800,,490,4.279569892473118

5675956,4,B00BURN0GI,"A decent show, with interesting plot lines. Watching Season 4, I cannot understand why there are never enough lights in the police station. There are just so many shadows - intentional, clearly, but overdone. The team seem to be getting paid well enough (overtime = 2x?) to wear well cut suits - so, it cannot be budget cuts.  Likewise with the creepy music - a bit too much and needless, often. And lastly, can the DI or DS not call a plumber to fix the faucets, and if so, why not?  So many incongruities, and that discordance was jarring.",1521244800,,541,4.454545454545454
5675957,4,B00BURN0GI,"Absorbing and entertaining for all 4 seasons IMO.  I really liked the characters, especially Rupert Penry-Jones as the tormented DI Chandler.  His relationship with his salt-of-the-earth sergeant lent the series a satisfying odd-couple buddy vibe.  Too bad it ended when it did.  One point off for its graphic depiction of the aftermath of murder: I learned to close my eyes during the autopsies.",1520899200,,396,5.238095238095238

5675963,2,B00BURN0GI,"The first 3 seasons were very good indeed. This season, 4, had less drama,much less and a great deal of hand washing and changing ones shirt. I would definitely skip this season and rewatch the first three. It appeared to me they ran out of ideas for a full season and focused on the foibles of the main protagonists. This season was a big disappointment to me..",1515801600,,362,4.417910447761194

5675965,2,B00BURN0GI,"Nasty for nastiness sake. A rehash of gruesome Victorian crimes. The Victorians had some, well, mitigation, in that amount of Opium innocently consumed in otc cough medicines, rash medicines, etc., in the arsenic permeating the walls of Victorian homes - where only the wealthy could afford window tax so the rest stayed in unhealthy darkness; they had the ergot poisoning following the flooding of the Thames which triggered psychosis, necrosis and seizures. No excuses for this psycho sadistic in your face garbage.

So, I stuck with this, not for entertainment, but to see where it was going, the 'raison d'etre,' so to speak. Was it funded by the Wahabis - the English were made to appear sadistic, psychotic, sociopathic and stupid, and of course the 'eye candy' DI (top detective) was a neurotic mess - upper class bolstered by the street savvy Detective Sergeant. WONDERFUL PERFORMANCES, by the way, but the sadistic and vicious images and dissonant sounds (won't call it music) every five seconds were very annoying and detracted from potentially intelligent story lines.

Where was it going - well, the ultimate in Christophobia!  The hymn singing 'bible thumpers' were really a bunch of sadistic, insane cannibals.

Whitechapel and Amazon - you have insulted three billion Christians with this grotesque excuses for entertainment. Those fine actors, doing their best with an ugly script deserve so much better.",1512950400,,1420,5.214912280701754

5675967,5,B00BURN0GI,What I liked most is the series. The only thing I didn't like was some fool went and cancelled my favorite show. I switched from watching american series just because of this problem. I loved this group dynamic and depth of character development. I thought the BBC would have enough sense to keep a good thing going but I guess not. Please prove me wrong and put them back on. This is no way to treat loyal followers or the cast. Get your junk together and at least be decent enough to give us an ending.,1512086400,,504,4.260416666666667
5675968,5,B00BURN0GI,"Brilliant programme, was gutted when ITV cancelled it originally. Some say it was a bit OTT at the end, but nah just creepy goodness. As a UK ex-pat love that it's on Prime.

5675969,4,B00BURN0GI,"I have enjoyed watching this and have one more episode to go. My only complaint is the lighting of the sets has gotten darker and darker. Do they not have electricity in England? It started out with normally lit offices and ended up with the DI needing to pull the overhead light over the easel/white board  in order to see it. It is a distraction because it is obvious that no police incident room would be lit like this. And the dentist's office was ridiculous. In fact, every room or office in every building was dark. Rather than turn on the lights, the police used their flashlight to search. More silliness. I hope that someone who films these kind of things takes notice. The dark rooms do not add drama, only incredulity.",1510963200,,729,4.5227272727272725

5675985,5,B00BURN0GI,"Ok, this show just scares the living Hell outta me.  It is first rate in every way -- absolutely superb writing, casting & acting.  This is the one of the best detective series ever.  It is right up there with Grantchester and Broadchurch, but it takes ""creepy"" to new heights (or, should I say ""depths""?).  There is an under-atmosphere of sheer terror, and I love it!  Also, if you continue watching this show past the first few episodes, you'll notice that you do actually care about what happens to the main characters.  That is a sign of a winning show in my opinion.  I haven't researched online to see if there will be a Season 5 (and beyond), and I'll definitely experience grief and withdrawal if I find out this is it.  I'm currently on the 1st episode of Season 4, and I had to stop watching a few times because I got too frightened. :-D  I've noticed that the show gets scarier with each season.  Yes, there is a lot of gore --  not so much violence, but gore.  Well, I think that has a place in this type of show and they don't over-do it.  Can't get enough.  Building up my courage to continue watching. Haha",1497916800,,1121,4.326923076923077
5675986,5,B00BURN0GI,"I enjoyed the first season so much. I love many of the various adaptions and reinventions of the Ripper murders. Buchan as a historical detective was a marvelous invention and helped make this version unique.
I admit I was afraid they wouldn't be able to sustain the same ""out of time"" dimension in Season 2, but I was very pleasantly surprised. Reinventing the show again in Seasons 3 & 4 kept me happy. I'm sorry the show wasn't popular enough in England to get us a few more seasons. Maybe they should have produced new shows for American TV?",1494892800,,545,4.515151515151516

5675988,5,B00BURN0GI,"This is an amazingly good series.  The stories are well-written, well-acted, and big-time creepy.  I started watching and had to binge through the entire series in a single weekend.  Couldn't stop!  If you love a great cop mystery series, this one will really keep you watching.  The premise is that Whitechapel, where Jack the Ripper committed his awful crimes, is now suffering a series of copycat murders that mimic numerous other historic crimes.

The only caveat I will give is this:  I won't say 'cliffhanger' because that would be unfair.  Each story does have its own satisfying conclusion.  However, there is a single, greater story arc that can only be described as 'What the HELL is going on here???' and that question will never be answered.  We do get some tantalizing clues at the end of series 4, but the show was cancelled at that point.  There will be no series 5.  It's too bad because I really wanted to see more of these wonderful characters and get a better look at the bigger picture.",1494892800,2,1006,4.685714285714286
5675989,5,B00BURN0GI,"I have been watching Brit TV, particularly Whodunits, for so many years, I don't hear the accents any more. They all sound American, except for Yorkshire. In the case of the acting though,  they remain distinct from American.  The "" Look at me, ain't I great "" seems conspicuously absent. They seem as if they all want to help each other get the most possible out of the story.  This series is a good example of  everyone helping to make it great, and it is.",1493510400,,458,4.352941176470588
5675990,5,B00BURN0GI,"I also stumbled on this series and have been hooked ever since. It is smart, thrilling, and unexpected. You will be sorry when you watch the last one and will be hoping that another season is in the making. Staring regular British actors, some of whom I recognize from other shows, I was captured from the begging. I am a history buff, so the way the writers weaved the historical into modern day was refreshing.

It is with trepidation that I now start season 4, for soon my adventure will be over. You will not be disappointed! Invest your time and enjoy this series. Season 4 is the most intense show I have ever watched. It is the creepiest, scariest, most suspenseful series I have ever watched. I found myself dreading it, yet I could not turn it off.

As is the case with most BBC America programming, ""Whitechapel"" is intelligent, intriguing, and suspenseful. The writing, the sets, and the acting are all superb. In addition, the complicated relationship between the inexperienced command detective, and his hardened veteran investigators, makes for an interesting dynamic for the viewers of this excellent series. ""Whitechapel, Season 2"" is an outstanding BBC America detective procedural, and it merits a five-star rating, along with a strong recommendation.",1491609600,4,739,5.7889908256880735

The DI's obsession with washing makes it just a bit much that he should be wandering through sewers in his coat and tie. One grows weary of his protestations and the flashbacks.

It's a bit too violent for my tastes, so I knocked it from 5 stars to 4 because I felt a lot of the violence and gruesome scenes were unnecessary. Occasionally the stories got goofy, but were quickly pulled back by a good twist at the end of each episode. The single biggest drawback was the gaping loophole involving the head DI's mental health. CLEARLY he was un-fit for duty - even though he was a good detective - but not once do you see him seeking help for his problem, nor does his staff ever once suggest that he should be seeking help. It was disturbing to watch him un-ravel in episode after episode, and also never find happiness from his loneliness and lack of intimacy.

5676003,3,B00BURN0GI,"I just don't know. It started out great. Not quite brilliant, but not everything is. It was quite watchable in the first two seasons. I'm pretty sure it jumped the shark in the Third season when they introduced the Mi6 element. I kept hoping they were able to dig the storyline out of that pit in this fourth season but I can't quite say they did. They were able to give the characters some badly needed depth this time around, however. Maybe it's note quite done yet.",1487203200,,468,4.390804597701149

 The crimes are a little fantastic, but are handled in a normal, not super-human fashion.  The additional aspect of historical crime research and the character involved, makes the show a bit more distinctive.

I think the show happens too much in the dark.  Some scenes are barely able to be seen, and the characters often seem to be walking from one small lighted area to the next.  Seems  a good idea overdone.",1484006400,,536,4.824175824175824

5676203,5,B00BURN0GI,"Have truly looked forward to and enjoyed every season of Whitechapel.  Yes, it is extremely dark but these actors, Rupert Penry-Jones, and all of the cast, make you absolutely believe in them as people and as policemen and detectives.  The writing for Whitechapel is flawless, the plots tight and convoluted enough to keep you riveted throughout.  The continuation between storylines and episodes is seamless.  The interpersonal connections between boss and staff keep you wanting more of a glimpse into how they function outside of their jobs and together.
Really love this show, and have been upset that it was not picked up again by iTV.  I'd recommend Whitechapel highly to anyone who is into fine acting, great writing and tight innovative plots.  But if you love British TV, as I do, you'll love Whitechapel.",1477958400,4,814,5.037313432835821

5676222,2,B00BURN0GI,"Amazon Prime has opened up for us a world of exquisite British entertainment.

Whitechapel is well acted, directed and edited. Seasons 1-3 are well written, although they darken in later episodes. However, writing in season 4 shifted to the macabre, the supernatural, and the absurd. Characters become unbelievable. Otherwise intelligent detectives ignore the obvious (mildew, faulty electricity, leaking water and sludge in water pipes - enough to condemn any public facility - often go unnoticed, and remain unconnected until the final episode?). I endured the fourth season through its conclusion, hoping it would redeem itself, and regretting I hadn't researched reviews more closely from the start.

However, don't let my opinion of the show's final season prevent you from watching earlier episodes. Watch seasons 1-3, then skip the last season, knowing there's a reason the show wasn't renewed, and switch to Inspector Lewis or Lark's Rising to Candlewood - magnificent English TV.

One poor season does not make for a bad show.",1476921600,,1035,5.3765432098765435

5676228,4,B00BURN0GI,"A good season; in my opinion it was not up to the quality of the preceeding seasons. I felt that the stories were more contrived and fanciful than the earlier ones. I think that fanciful stories must have enough reason and realism in them to make the fancy believable and the fear frightening. I think the earlier seasons did  this, but season four did not.

5676241,4,B00BURN0GI,"The show is getting a bit stranger but that is consistent with the supernatural mythos surrounding  the legacy of heinous crimes in and around London, expecially the Whitechapel area.  While a logical explanation is always introduced in terms of why a crime was committed organically, or why a culprit or victim thought of the situation in the manner that such a one did, enough mind twist factor is left for the viewer to understand,  empathize with the woo woo factor of plots/stories presented within the show.",1475625600,,513,4.941860465116279

5676256,5,B00BURN0GI,"The entire series is excellent - as long as you are not already hooked on what I consider substandard American television action offerings: car chases, hottie-body jiggle-blondes in thongs, and stage fights, oh my!  If that's your taste, move on. If you read books and appreciate theatre you will probably love this show, as I did.

The acting is wonderful, the cinematography and sound editing superb, and the writing original and fresh - including character development, dialogue and plot.  This is not a show where you figure out whodunit half way through the episode - plot twists and turns kept me engaged until the very end.

The ONLY negative I can come up with is that a few of the scenes are too dark for my eyes (referring to lighting, not emotions, btw - although those are quite dark as well).  I am particularly appreciative that viewer time was not wasted with music inserted to stand in for insufficient dialogue, as has become popular on American shows.

These are not American TV glamour cops, either - the fact that they are affected by the stress of what they do is reflected in the story as it moves forward -- gritty, not pretty. The central protagonist struggles credibly with OCD, and all of the characters are cast with actors who are age-appropriate, given the story-line. It is especially refreshing to see that the on-duty females wear clothing in which they could actually be expected to work and shoes in which they could actually walk!

Unfortunately, it would seem that the American system of watching the metrics rather than the shows seems to be infecting British producers as well, or this show would never have been cancelled after only four seasons.  I can think of no other explanation for the end of a series that deserved to go on for many years.

The characters are fully-fleshed individuals with quirks and flaws aplenty, but they make an effective team because they complement one another and prove a cohesive barrier to interference from within and without the police department.

5676292,5,B00BURN0GI,"After starting and abandoning a string of lackluster police drama series, I stumbled upon this gem and was hooked.  This series, set in modern times, covers macabre murders in the notorious Whitechapel section of London, often with ties to old unsolved murders.  DI Joseph Chandler--privileged, educated and on the fast track, is assigned to a Whitechapel detective unit just as a Jack the Ripper copycat is beginning to recreate that series of murders.  He is given a mandate to solve that series of murders, then he will be moved on up the ladder.  As with the original Jack the Ripper, police fail to identify and capture the killer, thus ending DI Chandler's fast track in the police department.  DCI Chandler, who is OCD, decides that he rather likes working in that detective unit, so he stays on and thus begins seasons 2 - 4.

His unit, consisting of an undisciplined lot of personalities, has been headed by DSI Ray Miles who is looking toward retirement, has an acerbic personality, and is plainly disgusted with losing his leadership to an obsessive DI with no street experience.  They frequently clash in a way that I found added humor to this show.  Also playing a predominant role in the squad is a Ripperologist... but I'll stop there and let you discover the rest of the personalities for yourself.

I have read some reviews that are quite critical of what is considered to be uneven scripting and performances.  Sometimes, I find reviews such as this off-putting.  I watch something for entertainment, not to become a critic--if I enjoy it, it's good, end of my story.  Guess we both can be seen as arrogant, lol.

I find it sad that this show did not have the popularity when it was originally aired on UK's Independent TV (ITV) as it has seemed to have on streaming video.  The lack of a solid viewer base and ratings on ITV resulted in the show being cancelled after it's 4th season.  Throughout the seasons, each story line is given a set number of episodes to resolve (generally three), then the show begins a new story line around new murders with none being carried over to the next season.  Unfortunately, that does not seem to happen with the last episode of the fourth season, and it appears to be a cliffhanger waiting for the next season..",1472428800,21,2268,4.6893939393939394

As for the show, it's pretty okay. They play up the Perry-Jones character as a detective when he's not really written as much of one. The crime-historical insights are somewhat amusing.

I don't want to spoil anything for anyone but if the show's going in a more supernatural direction than crime-solving they're sure taking their sweet time about it. I guess you can't blame them, though. It's a business and they've got a right to run their business the way they see fit.",1470009600,,632,4.592920353982301

5676366,5,B00BURN0GI,Loved seasons one through three and was happy to see season four made available. The interplay of the characters and the plots (all so wonderfully creepy and engrossing) make this much more than your run of the mill mystery program.,1469059200,,232,4.825

5676369,5,B00BURN0GI,"Creepy, atmospheric, well acted.  Season 4 has two 2-part mysteries.  And one story arc of a ""provocateur"" who is tormenting the precinct.  And especially tormenting Det Sargent Miles.  Tension builds as each main character discovers a darker side, or gets put into dark situations.  No one comes out of Season 4 without some scars - both physical and emotional.  Well done.  I hope there is a Season 5.  The provocateur is still free and active.  And is possibly, maybe, the ancient force that is causing Whitechapel to be the doorway to Hell.",1468800000,,544,4.826086956521739

5676402,5,B00BURN0GI,"This is a fantastic fourth season in a really great series.  It's got it all: murder, mystery, a little mayhem, and then add a touch of supernatural to the mix. Through the series we get to know the characters and watch them evolve which adds so much interest. The crimes can be a bit grizzly, but there is also a touch of humor here and there for balance. The only BAD thing is that this is the last season.  They could have filmed one more season to tie off all the loose strings, but alas, in their infinite wisdom the show was cancelled and this is the end.  Go back to the very beginning and watch all four seasons.  You will not be disappointed!",1467676800,,651,4.225806451612903

5676433,4,B00BURN0GI,"The characters are set up and ready to go, so this season is pure plot, and they do a pretty good job of it. I've been a fan of Penry-Jones since MI5 (Spooks in the U.K) and he continues to put in great performances, but Phil Davis (Miles) is the meat of this series. So great to see him playing a good guy. Usually he's just excellent at making you want someone to run over him with a truck. (Which is good, but, you know, bad.)",1466380800,2,429,4.0

5676435,5,B00BURN0GI,If you enjoy edge of your seat drama & unpredictability watch the entire Whitechapel series. This show originally aired on BBC America where I watched it the first time. When I saw it was on Amazon I started watching it again & I am enjoying it even more the second time around. The writing is brilliant. The acting is really superb. The main characters are very clearly defined & by the end of all of it you almost feel like you know them. It is a great series & well worth your time. Watch it at night & you will find yourself going around your house making sure the doors & windows are locked.,1466380800,,596,4.2368421052631575

Compared to Death in Paradise, the psychopathology of the DI here (Rupert Penry-Jones) is far less entertaining than that of the DI portrayed by Ben Miller.  The latter was about family history, while this one has a tenuous connection to family history but is much more classical OCD with a heavy overlay of supernatural poppycock.  No Matthew MacFaryden of Ripper Street in modern day Whitechapel!  Just insecurity and silliness.  Seasons 1 and 2 were much better written than Seasons 3 and 4.

Btw why did it take so long for them to figure out what was happening to them in the police station.. if they did find out ? I thought maybe  more ergot poisoning. But they dragged that out and when they were hallucinating.. they should have figured it out sooner. Lame .

Finally all the flickering and flashing constantly. They should put a warning for epileptic an  those sensitive. StAy away this show sux in the end. Started out decent failed in season four. Ultimate fails!",1459641600,,749,4.616541353383458

5676594,1,B00BURN0GI,"I am a big fan of the starring actors in this series, of BBC and European mystery series of all types and origins generally and even of the first three releases of Whitechapel, but this edition I couldn't finish--the first two episodes were enough.  The story was bizarre and not very challenging, the dialog so mumbled and unintelligible I couldn't understand it and the music so loud and intrusive I couldn't follow the story line.  So what value did I gain for investing my time and money?  Not enough.  By the way, it has no subtitles which for me are normally a ""don't buy this"" turn off, but I did get through the first three series, so I thought why not this one too.  It was a bad decision.

A final request to all DVD/Blu-ray producers, manufacturers and distributors--please add appropriate language subtitles, they add substantially to your market and revenue.",1422316800,,871,4.735099337748345
5676595,5,B00BURN0GI,I love the whitechapel series  and wanted the rest of them since America only had the first one out,1415750400,,99,4.2105263157894735
5676596,1,B00BURN0GI,I cannot play this tape on my DVD player. I did not understand that region 2 means it doesn't play on most DVD players in the US. I think to avoid confusion a statement should be made to consumers that this import will not play unless you have a special DVD player or live in a region 2 area . I had assumed that this just meant it was shipping from this area. Buyers beware and don't make the mistake I did. It's totally useless for me and I checked with friends and none of them understood what that meant. Further proof a statement should be issued explaining this to perspective buyers. But I do love the series!,1412035200,,616,4.228813559322034
5676597,3,B00BURN0GI,"The stories get progressively more weird in this series.  The first and last stories in Series 4 are entertaining, but the second one was a rip-off of Silence of the Lambs (and written by Steve Pemberton--shame on him!).  I am sorry that there won't be another series, since the last story called for Miles to shut down the nasty old woman who was causing problems.  I'm also sorry that the Commissioner has disappeared from the show, as he could have provided some much-needed rationality and stability in the last story in Series 4.",1409356800,6,534,4.720430107526882

5676599,4,B00BURN0GI,I enjoyed the ending of the series. I wish it had gone on longer. It is unfortunate that they haven't released it yet in the US.  The only way I found to see it was to buy the DVD from the UK then watch it on a region free DVD Player.,1398988800,10,234,3.588235294117647
8574178,5,B00BURN0GI,"This was great....I could stop until I was forced to after season 4.  It was good to see four of the cast members from SILK in the show; 2 consistently.
Rupert Penry-Jones and Phil Davis are awesome in their roles and the supporting cast does good work.  I'll say it again, many of the good/great shows were cancelled -- unfortunate.  When you see this type of quality work, you're standards are raised..  Fortunately, I found this show after watching SILK.  Who can I write to request that a show not be cancelled or brought back?  It's worth the time to put it in writing!",1530748800,,574,4.471153846153846
8574179,5,B00BURN0GI,"Really enjoyed this series.  Season 1 was the best, while season 4 got a bit odd, but enjoyed it all.  Really hate it was cancelled without giving viewers some closure on the series.",1530489600,,182,4.484848484848484
8574180,5,B00BURN0GI,"Being English, watching in the US, I may be bias, but I loved this show and binge watched it all and will do again. Each episode pulled me deeper, the characters were believable and whereas the murders were 'fantastic' it makes you wonder what the real police have to see and do, what doesn't make the papers !!. Sad though that it ended, but it seems that fewer and fewer well written and well acted programs are being made. Thank goodness for Amazon putting some great shows on a platform we can access.",1529712000,,505,4.440860215053763

8574182,5,B00BURN0GI,What a shame this excellent series was canceled. The history alone of crimes was so interesting it could be called part documentary. Rupert Perry Jones and his  Sargent are perfect choices for their roles. I would have enjoyed many more episodes but again someone who has no clue has again destroyed good TV.,1527120000,,308,4.811320754716981
8574183,3,B00BURN0GI,Good crime show until season 4. Should have stopped at 3.  4 was way too weird and syfi. It they would not have made season 4 into a fairytale I would have given them a 4. Not quite a 5 level.....,1524787200,,196,3.7804878048780486

8574185,2,B00BURN0GI,"The First season was great, second kept me scratching my head.......OK, third scary and a bit supernatural, fourth was down right upsetting.  A great build up, just to be let down with an unfulfilling quick ending that didn't tie up any loose ends or have meaning.  Don't get sucked in, you will be dissappointed.",1523232000,,313,4.777777777777778
8574186,5,B00BURN0GI,Rupert is a phenomenal actor and DI Joe Chandler in the entire Whitechapel series couldn't have been done by anyone else.  Excellent series.  You WILL get hooked.  Nothing in America like it.,1523145600,,191,4.90625
8574187,3,B00BURN0GI,"It's a good show. There are many wonderful British detective series with superb actors. The setting seems really stupid, though - and does not ""set the scene"" for me. No police department in England today is going to be based in an office with hardly any light, and no plumbing, it seems. That whole ""haunted basement"" thing just detracts from a great story. Also, I'm not sure if OCD is usually accompanied by hallucinations - but again - it detracts from what could be a fascinating series.",1522886400,,492,4.666666666666667
