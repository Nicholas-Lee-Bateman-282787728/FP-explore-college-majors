4498355,4,B004XYABQC,"""Pardon me if I don't toast the man who ruined my life.""  After a book exposing all his families secrets is published and becomes a hit Nathan must deal with the fallout.  The fact that his brothers and sister now hate him, his dad he is completely self obsessed is the only one who is proud of him.  The movie takes place the day of the annual birthday dinner for thier dad's birthday and we watch how each person deals with the stress of that as well as the book release.  Judging by the preview I was expecting this to be funnier then it was.  I'm not saying this was not a good movie, but I was expecting funnier.  I did enjoy it, and the movie was perfectly cast I thought, but I just thought it was missing something to make it better.  Watching each person deal with thier own personal problems set against the way they feel about the book is enjoyable to watch, but again something was missing.  I'm just not sure what.  Overall, I really did enjoy this, but it could have used something else, I just can't figure out what it is.  I give it a B.

Would I watch again? - I don't think I will.

8447599,5,B004XYABQC,"If you enjoy awkward, sometimes cringe-worthy humor, you'll enjoy Peep World.  It also has the right amount of mushy, heart-warming junk, which is nice :)",1369612800,3,154,5.16
8447600,5,B004XYABQC,"I really love the brutal honesty in this film.  The cast is amazing, it's one of my favorite dark comedies.",1363824000,,107,4.35
8447601,3,B004XYABQC,"Nathan(Ben Schwartz) has written a novel based on his dysfunctional family to the dismay of his family. The main characters are whimsically introduced by Lewis Black doing narration. The problem with the introduction is that when things become dramatic, you don't feel connected to the characters, you just wish the scene would be over so the film could move on to something funny.

Nathan, this generation's John Irving, has his own premature issue. Sarah Silverman stars as his sister Cheri who is so upset by her portrayal as a B_ in the book, she is suing her brother. To add insult to injury, they are filming the movie about the book outside her apartment and her 70 year old dad is dating the actress playing her character. Of yes, Cheri is an actress too. This is the kind of irony the movie needed more of, and less of the serious stuff.

Nathan gives us some truisms, such as when his assistant says, ""So that's why guys write...to get laid."" Nathan responds, ""That's why guys do everything.""

The movie had some funny scenes and not so funny scenes. I liked it when Silverman was on the screen. Lesley Ann Warren, who looks great, plays the mom in an under utilized role. Recent Academy Award winner Octavia Spencer had a minor role. Nathan's two brothers are Joel (Rainn Wilson) an attorney who is considered a loser and face it, the guy doesn't have his life together and Jack (Michael C. Hall) who frequents peep shows.

Don't spend more than $2.00.
