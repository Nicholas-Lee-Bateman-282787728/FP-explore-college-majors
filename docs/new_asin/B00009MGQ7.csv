7991963,5,B00009MGQ7,"There are only a few MC's left in the rap game, and Nas is one! This concert, filmed live at a club in NYC, is hot! First, it's Nas, the bravehearts, and a few special guest (Ludacris, Jadakiss, DMC). Nas performs a number of his hits & a few songs I haven't heard before. Lyrically, Nas is easily top 3 in the rap game. Some of his songs should be used in schools to teach kids about our history. Just the fact that it's Nas with a mic & maybe one or two other cats with a mike on the stage & not 10 people with mikes screaming & not making any sense, make this concert one that can show those who don't know, what really hip hop is! No crazy lights, lasers, dancers, just a MC, DJ, turntable & a mike! DMC while a ICON, seems out of sort with his ranting!",1290124800,,757,3.954248366013072
7991964,3,B00009MGQ7,"This dvd was cool because I love Nas but he should have rapped the whole songs.  I would still recommend it if you love Nas like I do, it's worth it.  Best rapper alive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1232236800,,187,4.470588235294118
7991965,3,B00009MGQ7,"Iam a huge Nas fan he is my second favorite rapper only to 2Pac

This concert had some classics on it

Some of the songs where to short and he didn't even spit all of the verses

To me Nas seemed drunk or high in this concert because it always seemed as if he where out of breath and could not finish the verse

If you are a die hard Nas fan you buy this like me because you feel that you have to other than that I would not reccomend buying this dvd",1139788800,,450,3.75531914893617
7991966,4,B00009MGQ7,"I enjoyed this dvd, but it could have been a lot better. First, the dvd was too short. Second, Nas could've finished some of the sentences in the verses he was reciting. Maybe, he didn't finish them in order to throw off the bootleggers. If this was the case, then he's a smart business man. If not, then the pros more than made up for the cons.  His performing of ""One Mic"" made up for 45% of the cons in this dvd, with ""NY State of Mind"" making up for another 25% and the other old school joints (plus ""The Cross"" and ""Get Down"") making up for the remainding 30; dropped lyrics or no.
  In short, a must have for the old Nas fans, and a should
have for the new.",1076716800,3,663,4.0458015267175576
7991967,4,B00009MGQ7,"I had no idea what to expect.  When I see it, this is a good concert and nas is great.
Negative -
1) Not enough of whole songs, seems to just say 1st verse or chorus and move on. (especially on street dreams)
2) Doesn't say enough,  he raps for a few lines than takes a break!
3) To much bravehearts, one guy in the background saying the last word to every line gets annoying
Positive -
1) It's nas, good playlist,
2) Ether is amazing!!!!
3) puts a lot of heart into one mic
4) Like how he went back to illmatic
5) It's nas
overall this was good.  i will watch this a lot.",1075161600,4,572,3.913793103448276
7991968,1,B00009MGQ7,"Nas is one of my favorite rappers so when I saw this I was pretty much shocked.
First of all, the picture-quality is very cheap... I have VHS-movies with better quality than this DVD.
The sound is also very bad, and NAS doesn't seem to care alot to make this concert extra special with the camera-crew around.
At many times NAS doesn't even rap in whole sentences but leaves the rest of the words to be said by The Braveharts which by the way u can't hardly hear anything from, my guess is they forgot to turn on their microphones.
The concert only lasts for 49 Minutes...
Shame on u NAS, go and buy PUBLE ENEMY - LIVE AT THE HOUSE OF BLUES instead.",1073174400,2,649,4.241935483870968
7991969,5,B00009MGQ7,"This DVD is in one word brilliant. Nas show us why he is the greatest lyricist of all time. He plays songs from his last effort ""God's Son"". But also goes back in time when he drops jewels as ""The World Is Yours"", N.Y. State of Mind"", ""It Ain't Hard To Tell"", ""Nas Is Like"" & ""Got Urself A..."". You also see Nas drops his superb diss-record ""Ether"" for the first time in front of an audience. The 2 most impressive perfomances are ""One Mic"" (Nas gives his all in this song) and ""Made You look Remix"". The crowd goes wild on this track. There is also an intermissen where Darryl McDaniels (DMC) comes on stage for showing his love for Nas. This DVD is a must have for every fan of REAL HIP HOP. One love.",1060473600,3,703,4.138686131386861
7991970,3,B00009MGQ7,"the goal of Nasir Jones' DVD was to show that he's from the streets but can also bring knowledge and that's what sets him apart from other rappers
music videos are pretty decent. they're from a concert in new york where he hails from.
some good special features too, including an interview, music videos, and a picture gallery with music",1055376000,2,337,4.633333333333334
