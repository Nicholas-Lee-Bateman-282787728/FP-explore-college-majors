2912474,3,B000TZJCOG,"The second most well known of Bruno Mattei's horror flicks isn't nearly as entertaining as his zombie opus, Hell of the Living Dead, though it has some fun moments.
In a post-nuke future, people live underground, but groups of rogue humans attempt to start life anew on the surface.  One such group of Road Warrior rejects hole up in an abandoned building in a dead city.  Luckily the building was home to some sort of science experiments that include growing plants and purifying water.  The down side is the building is swarming with intelligent, flesh eating rats.  They don't seem to bother our ""heroes"" too much at first, but quickly make their intentions known.
At about 97 minutes,this movie feels a bit too long because it seems there are long stretches without anything terribly interesting happening.  Gore is rather minimal too.  But since we're talking Bruno Mattei here, it does have it's own brand of entertainment value, which as we all know, means it's schlocky as hell and quite unintentionally funny at times.  One prime example being right after the group finds the building-Obviously they are on the search for food, and come across a bunch of dried goods, like sugar and flour and whatnot.  So how do they celebrate?  By throwing it around and dumping it on each other!
The movie is an obvious ripoff of Night of the Living Dead, even going as far to have a frightened, catatonic woman, and the inevitable ""Mr. Cooper"" character who seems to want to piss on eveyrone's parade and just be plain difficult.
Maybe I missed an important plot point or something, but I never understood why these people didn't just flee the damn building.  I mean, it didn't seem like anything was really trapping them there. They had casually strolled in, why not casually stroll out?  But we fans of Italian horror don't bother ourselves with trivial junk like logic.
But all in all, Rats is not the schlock classic it could have been.  Maybe if it were a tad shorter, perhaps a bit more over the top, more gore, it would have been twice as good.  But who am I to question the genius of Bruno Mattei?",1346198400,,2101,4.676630434782608
2912475,1,B000TZJCOG,"Rats: Notte di Terrore (Bruno Mattei, 1984)

I have seen a handful of Bruno Mattei joints over the years, and every time I do I resolve I will never watch another one. But there's something about the car-wreck awfulness of Mattei that makes me think that, okay, maybe this one will be just that much better than Zombies: The Beginning or Violence in a Women's Prison or Hell of the Living Dead. And every time I am wrong, wrong, wrong. My most recent descent into the world of Bruno Mattei is Rats: Night of Terror, a god-awful sci-fi flick that basically takes a single scene in Escape from New York and expands it into an hour-and-a-half flick with a cheesy twist ending you'll never see coming. (Please adjust your sarcasm filters if you didn't catch that.)

Plot: in a post-nuclear-holocaust world, most of the surviving humans moved underground in order to escape the radiation. Bands of savages remained on the surface, fighting each other and the inevitable wildlife. In this case, it should be no surprise that the particular band of savages we're following (who are tired of their savage existence and discussing descending into the underground to see if they can hang with the civilized folk) seem to have gotten on the bad side of a very large swarm of rats, who harry them into an abandoned building, etc. Meanwhile, the group starts fracturing along the predictable lines while every once in a while one or two get picked off by hungry rats. (Here's a hint: when two of them go off to have sex...)

So, yeah, this is your typical Bruno Mattei movie. The acting is horrid, and the dubbing even more so. (Usually I would have held out for subtitles, but come on, it's Bruno Mattei. That's like buying a 60-inch HD plasma TV so you can watch Adam Sandler movies on it.) Some of the completely gratuitous special effects aren't all that bad (which will come as a huge surprise to Mattei veterans), which at least keeps them film watchable when they're onscreen, and the dialogue is chock full of the usual unintentional hilarity, so it's not a complete waste of time. But if you're looking for great cheese along the lines of Kingdom of the Spiders or Shriek of the Mutilated, you'd do well to stay far, far away from any picture where Bruno Mattei had a had in its creation. *",1277251200,,2286,4.611793611793612
2912476,5,B000TZJCOG,"AMAGAD!!!!! AMAFACKINGGAD!!!!! AMAMOTHAAFACKINGGAD!!!!! This movie is a *beep* masterpiece! It's so bad that it's totally awesome! It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen! It's full of sleaze, gratuitous violence, hilariously bad acting, ridiculous dialogue and awful special effects that you just have to laugh at! I couldn't stop laughing my ass off! It's just as (unintentionally) funny as movies like Troll 2, The Room, Women's Prison Massacre, Burial Ground, etc... Bruno Mattei is a god! 10/10!!!! AMAGAD!!!!!!

If you like cheesy Italian horror and/or exploitation movies, you'll love it! If you don't like cheesy Italian horror and/or exploitation movies because you take them seriously and you can't laugh at the bad acting and ridiculous dialogue, you're a boring person and you don't have a sense of humor.

2912493,3,B000TZJCOG,"I think anyone nervy enough to throw three stars at this gobbler has to be willing to defend their position, and I will try to do so. The acting, dialogue, and dubbing are all on a par with low-budget kung fu movies. Some of us enjoy that. So there's a star. Then, the characters are so unrelentingly repugnant, one cannot help but cheer for the rats. Go rats! Get 'em, rats! Let's hear it for the rats! Bon appetit rats! So that's worth a star. (However, I must give credit to the human actors, they mostly have great hair and makeup for a bunch of post-apocalyptic punks.) Finally, the ham-fisted organ music alone deserves a star in this chase-and-chomp. The sound track could have been played by Dr. Phibes himself.",1405468800,,719,4.538461538461538
2912494,3,B000TZJCOG,"After THE bomb, the second human race evolves with the ""sophisticated ones"" living below, the ""primitive beings"" living above ground.  The funny thing is there isn't much of a difference, 225 A. B. notwithstanding.  There appears to be no heavy damage to the one part of a city where the action takes place and apparently, there are still gas stations to fuel their motor bikes, still fancy apparel for this biker gang to wear, and plenty of perfectly coifed perms to go around.  Their clothes must have magically properties because immediately after a major food fight, including dosing one lady in flour, they're all clean again!  This has to be one of the strangest non-horror horror films I've ever watched.  Despite the lovely cover art on the DVD, depicting a raging horde of angry rats, the rats (guinea pigs) in the movie are lethargic at best, wholly uninterested in their surroundings and the people they were supposed to be attacking/killing/eating.  I've never seen such lazy quasi-rats!  It would have been better had they thought to use fake rubber rats or sock puppets.  As for the actors involved in all these crazy shenanigans........well, I'm not really certain `actors' were involved, you certainly can't prove it by what I watched.  I will admit the ending is a doozy and almost worth sitting through the entire feature just to see it.  But it's not enough to persuade me to ever watch the darn thing again.  Once was enough, not a keeper.",1381017600,2,1459,4.842741935483871

2912496,1,B000TZJCOG,"This is not worth the purchase price, long, boring, and unbelievable, and it just doesn't make sense.  I realize that movies of this sort often don't, but this is at the bottom of the barrel.",1355011200,,191,4.457142857142857
8211567,3,B000TZJCOG,"In 2015, the earth was devastated by nuclear holocaust. Now, 225 years after that tragedy, our story begins. We are introduced to a group of post-apocalyptic bikers, who are amazingly clean, especially their hair, which holds its body, even on a dead planet! Their clothes -a cross between ROAD WARRIOR and BILLY JACK AND THE BORN LOSERS costumes- are equally well preserved, and pressed! Hell, even their spiked armbands are right off the shelf! Perhaps the radioactive fallout made everything brand new! Anyway, our anti-heroes happen upon a certain ghost-town, in search of supplies. Uh-oh! They soon realize that the only living things besides themselves, are rats. Lots of rats! These are no ordinary rodents, as they attack and devour human flesh! Several rotting, half-eaten corpses are discovered, and the well-groomed motorcycle enthusiasts still refuse to leave town. Of course, this is no run-of-the-mill town either! Something happened here. Something involving ""science"", and ""technology"". When night falls, the real hoopla begins. Suddenly, there are more rats running around, than at Willard's birthday party! The bike-riding boneheads seem oblivious. Nudity ensues, when two of their number decide to go to the basement for their lovey-time. Oh dear! This might not have been such a good idea! Another biker investigates a vegetable-growing facility. The next thing they know, it's: ""Squeak!"" ""Chomp!"" ""Eeee-aaaghh!"". RATS: NIGHT OF TERROR is one of those rather hilarious, Italian horror films from the 1980's (the scene in which a rat-puppet emerges from a biker's mouth, is a particularly memorable moment of merriment). It contains the requisite gore, sex, big-big hair, and animal cruelty. As rubbish cinema goes, this is a bucket-load of Grade-A vermin-droppings! It is a howl to watch, though! However, there are a few stretches of dullness that had me begging the schlock-gods for some face-eating to commence already! All that can really be said about this movie is: ""It's a good thing rats love cheeeze!""...  P.S.- Best watched w/ a group of friends. You'll be reciting lines of this ding-a-ling dialogue for weeks!...",1500940800,,2144,5.34319526627219
8211568,1,B000TZJCOG,OMG This movie gave bad acting a bad name! I found myself feeling sorry for the poor rats constantly being tossed back into the scene from off camera. I think this movie has moved into a tie for first place in my bad movie list!! EEK!,1498953600,,234,4.108695652173913

8211570,4,B000TZJCOG,"Rats: Night of Terror opens with text and narration recounting how in the distant future of 2015, a nuclear war devastated the earth and forced the survivors to live underground. Then there's something about the species splitting in two all Eloi and Morlock style because of course but none of these details really matter. Now cut to 225 years after the bomb, and we've got a poor man's version of Toecutter and company cursing the wasteland on junked up motorcycles set to some awesomely Mannheim Steamrollerish music. Now that's how you open a movie.

After the rather bleak opening, the film quickly descends into full camp. Somehow the dialog and acting just keep getting worse and worse as the film goes on. I felt compelled to keep watching just to see how bad it could possibly become, and the film doesn't disappoint. The writing is marvelously atrocious to start with, but it's the delivery that gives the whole experience that special something that only the future director of Troll 2 could pull off. And the questionable dubbing makes it all even better.

While the film is entertaining throughout, some parts, especially the ending, approach a level of campy brilliance. Nothing remarkable, and other parts drag a little, but always fun. If you appreciate Troll 2 or just love campy post-apocalyptic Italian cinema, be sure to check this one out",1494979200,,1358,4.925764192139738
8211571,2,B000TZJCOG,Very bad acting. Running around this building back & forth from room to room. Rats being basically dumped on top of people. Terrible F/X. Way too much screaming. I'm trying to figure out why I gave it 2 stars. Hard to keep interested. Actually the only good part was the ending & even that was predictable & of course it ended in screaming. Maybe 2 stars for the nudity.,1491696000,,370,4.3768115942028984

8211574,4,B000TZJCOG,"This is one crazy '80's vintage Italian giallo film with some of the unintentionally funniest scenes and characters.  Set in the far future, a group of Mad Max wannabees end up in a deserted town where they encounter a ton of rats...which don't seem very interested in them until the stage hands fling them at the actors!  Also, these rats are having a seriously bad hair day which is odd since grooming is one of their major activities.  Also, either the camerawork or some post production gave them the reddest eyes - almost fluorescent!  I did learn some important safety tips like if you're covered with rats don't ask your buddy with the flame thrower to help you!!  It has a twist ending that is also amusing.  All in all a fun film unless you're a rat-a-phobe!",1451260800,,767,4.562043795620438
