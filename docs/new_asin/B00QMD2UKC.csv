6876450,3,B00QMD2UKC,"For AC, Westinghouse was mentioned as buying patents form various inventors.  Tesla, the inventor of AC, was not mentioned.  Tesla sold his patent to Westinghouse with the proviso that he, Tesla, would receive royalties.  When Westinghouse found it difficult to get his company off the ground, Tesla told him he did not have to pay any royalties.  Big mistake.",1422662400,2,360,5.0508474576271185
6876451,5,B00QMD2UKC,"In 1900, America was no Europe since America lacked in the prestigious institutions that Europe had to offer but America had one thing that it made America what it is today, geniuses who could invent. Edison started working at age fourteen and by twenty nine, he believed enough in himself that opened a 5,000 square feet headquarters in Menlo Park as his lab to invent and create. Just go back and think when the power is out in your neighborhood but multiply it few fold over all over the country and the whole world. What a dramatic issue that was when Edison promised just to light up a whole city square block in New York when nobody had seen any light bulbs in their lifetime less alone witnessing light in their homes. Edison had to be more than an inventor. He had to be a businessman, a salesman, an administrator, manufacturer and much more all at once while running his company to lay 8,000 feet of copper line below the streets of New York to supply electricity and to provide light to every subscribing home and business in the district with the simple flip of a switch. Lamp, meters, and other components had to be mass-produced and Edison had to oversee the factories as well while dealing with investors who truly never failed to provide distraction.

Light bulbs were invented eight years before Edison was born but for decades no one could invent a light bulb that could give light for more than few seconds till Edison came into the equation. Edison was an entrepreneur, a visionary who understood business good enough that he had investors like JP Morgan lined up years in advance before actually making a light bulb that could burn for hours and hours. This is a superb documentary about an American genius with no education except a sense of creativity with pure dedication. As always, American Experience has done a marvelous job of producing a fascinating true American story with superb cinematography and narration of an American genius whose dedication to invention gets us to this extraordinary accomplishment that really changed the world in so many ways for better. Edison a millionaire at thirty seven year old with three children lost his twenty nine year old first wife to some medical complication. Edison was no average genius, he was a millionaire who lived in a twenty three room mansion who at thirty eight married his second wife Mina, a nineteen year old beauty, a daughter of an inventor who moved around the rich society and had her own interest but gave Edison three more children.

On October 18, 1931 on his death, for two days and nights more than fifty thousand people passed his body to pay their respects and on the third night in response to a request by President Hoover, radio listeners across the country switched off their lights in unison, the darkness meant as a reminder of what life would have been like, had Edison had never lived. Thank you Mr. Thomas A. Edison.",1422403200,5,2922,4.716242661448141
8691907,3,B00QMD2UKC,"With a runtime just under two-hours, this documentary is slickly produced, well-paced, nicely narrated by Michael Murphy and pays credible service to the larger societal anxieties occurring alongside--and being driven by--Edison's titanic creations. Present, too, is the commentary of authors, academics, and inventors striking just the right balance of psycho-historical analysis into Edison's protean drive, demons and self-mythologizing.

The first of many critical lapses:  this documentary unbelievably assigns no emphasis to Edison's legendary ""Universal Stock Printer,"" aka ""Stock Ticker."" (Imagine watching CNBC today absent its ever-present pricing ""bug"" at the bottom and side of the screen; continuously streaming the Markets' real-time pulse, pitch and yaw!) Instead, Edison's innovation is barely implied and lumped into a ubiquitous, if not rather pedestrian, description of ""printing telegraphs"" that he improved upon before he was 30-years old.

However, without the success of this one, specific, innovation, Menlo Park could not have been financed--and by extension, the creation of the first practical incandescent light bulb likely wouldn't have been Edison's. (The Universal Ticker was his first genuine, unambiguous, commercial success; handily beating out the phonograph by several years and selling over 5,000 units in the first few years of the 1870's alone before the NYSE eventually purchased the rights from Edison in 1890.)

Absent as well is his notoriously harsh childhood and the crippling impact of a series of traumas including a chemical explosion, scarlet fever and a beating by a railroad conductor; all of which contributed towards his complete hearing loss in one ear and 80-percent in the remaining ear before exiting young adulthood. Bizarrely and instead, outtakes from a treacly 14-minute film called ""The Boyhood of Thomas Edison"" from 1964 is offered up as a definitive (albeit consciously idealized) depiction.

Meanwhile, there's also no clip of his infamous electrocution of the beloved Coney Island attraction, ""Topsy The Elephant"" (which outraged a nation still keenly aware of ""Jumbo The Elephant's"" tragic rail yard death under P.T. Barnum's stewardship years earlier).

Absent as well is his equally legendary feud/rivalry with Nikola Tesla (THE other--if not legitimate--electrical genius of the Age).

Similarly lax, is the depiction of the decades-long estrangement and destruction of his first son and namesake (Thomas A. Edison, Jr.) which is all but glossed over as a seemingly isolated squabble resulting from a single incident of the younger man pilfering the family name.

You get the idea.

In fairness, 120-minutes is possibly simply inadequate for a genius whom spanned eight-decades and filed 1,000 patents. However, the film misses the mark more by what it omits than by what it includes. The producers lit upon a bright idea but ultimately kept too many intriguing aspects in the shadows.",1524355200,,2956,5.63963963963964

In mid-October, 1922, a film crew arrived in the small town of West Orange, New Jersey, to spend some time with one of the most famous men in the world: the phenomenally prolific American inventor Thomas Edison.  Over the course of a few days, the cameras captured the great man at workin his laband catching up on the latest advances in the [inventions] for which he was best known, the incandescent light, [the phonograph], and motion pictures.

For these and scores of other inventions, Edison has justly earned acclaim as the Inventor of the Age. But no mere machine could account for his metamorphosis from inventor to icon.

Poised at the starting line of America's rush into the modern world, Edison became its standard bearer.  The impact of his native genius made infinitely more powerful by his timing, his canny knack for self-promotion, and his compulsive need to win.  In the end, the intensity of Edisons drive proved both blessing and curse, costing him the allegiance of a life-long friend and control of the industry to which he had given life, even as it guaranteed him a kind of immortality.

The above is spoken by the narrator at the beginning of this extraordinarily informative documentary about the life of Thomas Edison (1847 to 1931).  This is an episode of the television series entitled American Experience.

Besides the excellent narration, there are brief comments given throughout by historians, biographers, etc.  What I especially enjoyed was the old black and white film footage where we get to hear Edisons actual words.  There is also extensive use of black and white still pictures.

Edison had over a thousand patents to his name.  By the end of this program, I guarantee youll understand why he was called a wizard.

Finally, this documentary mentions that Henry Ford actually worked for Edison before he founded Ford Motor Company.  It does not mention that Nikola Tesla also worked for Edison.  Tesla is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.  (I mention this because Edison was involved with direct current {DC} and, as this documentary explains, Edison saw AC as a major rival.)

In conclusion, this is just a fantastic documentary about a man, Thomas Edison, who single-handedly created the image of an inventor!  I leave you with the first words that Edison uttered into his phonograph:

Mary had a little lamb, its fleece was white as snow and everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go.
