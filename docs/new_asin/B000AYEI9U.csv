While the stories are a bit predictable to me , and Shatner's interludes are sometimes a bit annoying, we are having fun watching, and I do find most stories to have good moral lesson behind them . Not exactly twilight zone nor outer limits , but good family entertainment",1381104000,,328,4.306451612903226
8080414,5,B000AYEI9U,"I love love love this series. I used to watch it as a kid and when I found it on Amazon years and years later, I decided to buy it anyway. Along with the Adventures of Shirley Holmes, MythQuest, Outriders, William Tell, Swiss Family Robinson, and the Cave of the Golden Rose, this mystery-packed show was a major part of my childhood. It has 13 episodes, each more enticing than the other. I really cannot point out why its such an awesome show; all I can say is I watch it whenever I feel nostalgic. I do however, recommend it to parents looking for something a little less superficial than the majority of kids' shows today.",1296432000,2,626,4.405172413793103
8080415,5,B000AYEI9U,"I taped this series when it was on television.  I loved the stories.  They reminded me of the Eerie, Indiana (which I have on DVD as soon as it came out) or the Goose Bumps series  for children.  I'm a rather  elderly person now  and I still like the series.  I would like to give it to some young people I know, but some parents may be uneasy about it.  Parents need have no fear unless their children are very easily spooked&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ei-9-Bring-Me-Dream-Eerie-Indiana/dp/0380797852/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ei  9: Bring Me Dream (Eerie, Indiana)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Goosebumps-The-Haunted-School/dp/0439774756/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Goosebumps: The Haunted School</a>.(I don't like horror or Elm Street or movies like that).

8080416,5,B000AYEI9U,"I got ""William Shatner's A Twist in the Tale"" for one reason, to see the story with Charles Mesure, ""The Green Dress."" While this story and the others focus on the supernatural adventures of children and younger teens, the adults' parts are also compelling. Nick and Brigid Martinelli (Charles Mesure and Michele Amas) are estranged over life choices. She always wanted a career on the stage and now has high hopes for their daughter Rose (Beth Allen) to boldly go where she never went before -- to paraphrase Mr. Shatner! When Rose gets her big chance, thanks to a mysterious green dress bought for a school play costume, the family comes together but is almost torn apart forever by the ambitious spirit inhabiting the dress.

Narrator William Shatner is very reassuring as he tells the stories to a group of young people that includes the stars of each episode. Good spooky stories for kids with a lot for adults too. When you buy this collection and watch ""The Green Dress,"" notice how Nick and Brigid work out their problems like grown-ups. Be sure to notice Nick watching his daughter on stage -- breathtaking!",1219968000,5,1116,4.782383419689119
8080417,5,B000AYEI9U,"Willam Shatner's A Twist In The Tale was a 15 episode short lived television series in the late 1990's. Every week the narrarator/host (Shatner) would have a group of children he would tell a story to. The main children were always in the story itself. There are several great episodes including ""Obsession In August"" dealing with the legend of King Arthur and Camelot. The stories were well written and easy to follow. They had a certain chill factor, but not really scary. Watching them reminded me of watching old black and white B horror movies, no real shock value, just some uneasiness. My 10 year old cousin loved them. Some of the episodes can get complicated, but an older child should enjoy them. Interestingly enough, there was another series on around the same time called ""The Legend of Willam Tell"". A few of the young actors/actresses from that series appeared on ""A Twist In The Tale. Both shows were produced by the same company.
This dvd would make a wonderful addition to anyone's collection. If you are concerned about what your children are watching on tv today, this is a dvd you can be completely confident in letting your children watch. It is good, clean fun.",1139788800,17,1184,4.752427184466019
