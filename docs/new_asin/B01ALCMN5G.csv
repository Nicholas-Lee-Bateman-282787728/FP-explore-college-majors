7607316,5,B01ALCMN5G,I don't mind my kids watching this...fun and educational...ish.  Worth the time they waste if they are going to watch TV.,1375056000,,121,4.761904761904762
7607317,5,B01ALCMN5G,Those kids just keep the hits coming ! All in the name of science. Love the revisits. They must be pro's since after all these years they still have all limbs in tack. Just good entertainment when your tired of all the high tension drama.,1374710400,,238,4.311111111111111
7607318,5,B01ALCMN5G,"Yes, ok. It's cool watching them blow stuff up (giggles) but I do enjoy the science and movies myths too. I think this show is so popular because its not only fun and entertaining but smart too.",1365724800,,194,4.27027027027027
7607319,5,B01ALCMN5G,Myth busters is my favorite show. I was very excited to see the 10th season available. The quality of the show is excellent.,1358467200,2,124,4.434782608695652

7607321,5,B01ALCMN5G,"Where's buster when you need him?
You can't help but be entertained my Mythbuster's antics and humor.

MythBuster/
""Uh... Is this another mocking reference to me being old as dirt?""
/MythBuster

If you haven't seen Adam give the mocking finger-walrus-mustache treatment of Jamie (his cohort), you're missing out.

What's not fun about watching Jamie chase red-suit Adam around the shop with a baseball bat.

""Don't try this at home.  Ever!  We're what you call... 'experts.'""
/MythBuster",1355875200,,499,5.415584415584416
7607322,5,B01ALCMN5G,as always the mythbusters deliver a fantastic season with great ideas tried experiments performed and of course amazing explosions!!!  You will not be disappointed,1355616000,,163,5.791666666666667
7607323,4,B01ALCMN5G,"The episode gets its title from the part of it that needed a build but the good stuff in this episode is on the sidelines.

The main action of this episode is the ""Blow Your Own Sail"" segment that gives the episode its title and required the crew to build something, but the peripheral segments of the episode, the parts where Savage and Heinemann, investigate the accuracy of Hollywood sounds effects, is the real meat of the matter and the place where all the interesting slow-motion happens.

Of special charm is Savage's almost childlike surprise at finding that the classic, movie and television silenced pistol sound effect is not nearly as farfetched as it seems.

Definitely worth a watch or two.",1332374400,,704,4.801652892561983
7607324,4,B01ALCMN5G,"Remember when the Mythbusters tested out Spy Car myths a while back? Well they come back with two of the best, the axle of death (having various metal spikes attached to the wheel of the car) and the classic automatic gun and how accurate it really is (they use a paintball gun instead, but still.)  Seeing Jamie chuckle with mad glee when designing the biggest axle of death makes this worth the price alone.

Tori, Kari, and Grant meanwhile test the myth if you fire a gun into ice/snow the bullet will spin in circles.  Not the more interesting secondary line in the world, but not bad.",1315353600,,589,4.485981308411215
7607325,5,B01ALCMN5G,"I wish that Discovery channel had put ALL the shows in, the DVD only covers a small part of the shows.  Missing lots of episodes.
Great show for those who love anything about science.",1473120000,,183,4.382352941176471
7607326,5,B01ALCMN5G,It was very entertaining and lots of fun to watch.  They always have a good sense of humor.,1465948800,,91,4.055555555555555

7607329,5,B01ALCMN5G,Love Mythbusters...,1462147200,,19,9.0
7607330,4,B01ALCMN5G,The Mythbusters are as entertaining as ever even without the three member build team.  But the set is overpriced.  Other seasons for the same price include six discs and there are only three here.,1461974400,,196,4.735294117647059
7607331,3,B01ALCMN5G,good set- not all episodes are here.,1460937600,,36,4.285714285714286

7607333,2,B01ALCMN5G,"It's just not the same without Kari, Grant, and Tori. Now it's just a macho Jamie and Adam sausage fest.",1458950400,,104,4.25

7607336,3,B01ALCMN5G,More clear connections to scientific method during experimentation for the benefit of science students would be appreciated.,1427500800,,124,6.352941176470588
7607337,5,B01ALCMN5G,Fun for the whole family! We watch this with our 5-year old and he loves the show.,1418860800,,82,3.8823529411764706
7607338,5,B01ALCMN5G,I watch these over and over.  I just love them!!,1409011200,,48,3.8
7607339,4,B01ALCMN5G,Good season of a great show.,1408060800,,28,3.8333333333333335
7607340,5,B01ALCMN5G,"What more is there to say? Well, they can quit with all the 'specials' with other shows I've never even heard of, much less watch, for starters, and get back to what they know and do best. (NOT just bigger explosions for the sake of them) Of all my favorite long running Discovery shows, this is the only one still running. I remember once, when asked if they would ever run out of myths and old sayings and such, the answer was a clear NO WAY! So, lets get back to that please! Old wise sayings and wisdoms, like bull in a china shop, for example. And herding cats. (Even though I've never heard that one, no pun intended) As thick as molasses in January. (Or as slow as) A stitch in time saves nine... OK, that one is rather obvious. And the drafting behind a truck... while interesting to see them prove what I've known most of my life, was never a 'myth' to anyone who's ever watched a NASCAR event, or been too broke to make it back to the base on a late Sunday night! Dirty vs Clean car, now THAT was a good one. I hadn't heard of it quite as they put it, but the golf ball car was brilliance! Getting out of a sunken car alive... Well worth watching every show they ever did, even the dumb ones. (Chickens, thawed or frozen, and getting the wrong type of airplane) NOW, they have to do it all the same, except in real water, not a pool, DIRTY muddy water. even rather clean water is going to get stirred up by the impact of car with bottom of body of water. On the whole though, Mythbusters IS my number one favorite show, and adding M7 was genius.  Returning to the 'myth' that started it all and FINALLY getting it all together, was also genius. Nice full circle. Now, loose some weight and get that damned 'jet pack' to fly! I've SEEN they fly, I know it can be done!",1401667200,,1777,4.180758017492711
7607341,5,B01ALCMN5G,Any season is worth watching. I like having them available to watch over and over. I don't use a satellite or cable so I can be very picky as to what I watch. I just love those Mythbusters.,1396656000,,189,4.0
7607342,5,B01ALCMN5G,"By far my favorite television series!  Back to back Mythbusters marathons are pretty common in my house.  Explosions, a redhead with guns, science content, and ""Don't try this at home"" warnings...what more could a guy want!",1389744000,,223,5.166666666666667
7607343,5,B01ALCMN5G,"It's Mythbusters!  'Nuff said!
My whole family has a Mythbusters ritual set up now, with popcorn, looking between the couch cushions for the remotes, shooshing the dog away from the popcorn, getting set up, last minute trips to the loo, shooshing the dog again, and then a debreif of the episode after.  While shooshing the dog away from the popcorn.
Very enjoyable, family appropriate, and stimulating for young and old minds alike.",1386547200,,433,5.0
7607344,5,B01ALCMN5G,I love it and my 6 year old daughter loves it too. Lots of science and comedy.  Three more words.,1375228800,,97,3.85
