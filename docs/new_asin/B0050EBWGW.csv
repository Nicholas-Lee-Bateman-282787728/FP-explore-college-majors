8451132,5,B0050EBWGW,"I love musicals and wanted to share my favorites with my grandchildren. They have seen the previous version and liked it, but love this version!  Love the fact that my four year old granddaughter hums songs from Bye Bye Birdie while she plays with her Legos.",1455148800,,258,4.608695652173913
8451133,4,B0050EBWGW,"I thought it was ""stretched"" to fit widescreen tvs.  I hate when they do that.  However, it was my blu ray player
When I put it in a standard DVD player the aspect ratio was normal.  I regret my mistake.",1444348800,,203,4.025
8451134,5,B0050EBWGW,My kid watches Bye Bye Birdie over and over again.  He loves it.  Vanessa Williams acting is just okay but she is easy on the eyes.  Jason Alexander gives a great performance as well as George Wendt.  China Phillips and the guy that plays Birdie seem way too old. But their still pretty good and like I said my kid loves it.  I haven't watched any of the other movies.,1421712000,,368,4.2
8451135,5,B0050EBWGW,I bought it so my daughter could see the original Bye Bye Birdie.  Our local school is putting on the Musical this year.  The DVD was a delight. She and I watched it a half dozen times and I expect we will watch it again.  I think we know all the words now.  Love it!  The other three moves were okay.,1363478400,2,301,3.8688524590163933
