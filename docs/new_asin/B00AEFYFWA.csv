5410639,5,B00AEFYFWA,"Seriously, how can you not love this movie?  Tim Meadows, Will Ferrell, and all the other comedic masterminds work together to make a brilliant and HILARIOUS film.  ""Can I buy you a fish sandwich?""  Why yes, you certainly can.  You will remember so many one-liners from this film.  A classic that no collection should be without.  I loaned this to someone, and it never came home.  I had to buy it again.  It's that good.  Moral of the story: buy this film and don't loan it out!",1415145600,2,479,4.413793103448276

5410645,5,B00AEFYFWA,"This film is one of my favorites, and a truly underrated and underseen classic. I was happy to add this to my collection after spending many hours watching it at lan parties and other such things. A great many people haven't even heard of this movie, so seeing it can be a nice bonding experience, which I found out when I was hanging out with a band before a show and referencing this movie came up, them being surprised anyone else had seen it. The movie is hilariously quotable in the worst way, and while it isn't a classically good film, it is funny and easy to watch. Most of the time. It also has Billy Dee Williams man.",1401148800,3,627,4.277310924369748
5410646,1,B00AEFYFWA,I tend to love SNL movies but this one is so bad that I had no other desire than to get it out of my home after I stopped watching it at about the thirty minute mark. I have always liked Tim Meadows as a supporting character but this movie goes a long way to explaining what happened to his career (or didn't). He is a one-trick pony and this script is so poor that the combination of an actor with limited range and an inane and unfunny plot is lethal - and long term.,1397433600,,469,3.9473684210526314
5410647,5,B00AEFYFWA,Leon Phelps is classic tv!! Glad to have this movie back in my collection. Hilariously funny must have. Great price!,1396656000,4,116,4.85

5410649,5,B00AEFYFWA,"There really isn't anything really good about this movie except that it is really funny, nasty and incorrect.

I would not tell anyone that I think it is halarious except in a review.",1393804800,3,183,4.545454545454546

5410652,5,B00AEFYFWA,"If you have not watched The Ladies Man then you are missing out. This movie is much like the other SNL skits gone full motion picture. Same characters you enjoy, but with a bigger and longer story. Check it out if you like the SNL skit ""ladies man"" or if you just want some good adult humor",1378080000,,290,4.105263157894737
8550508,2,B00AEFYFWA,"Tim Meadows of SNL fame had a frequent sketch on that TV show where he played a very shallow. self-centered, confident man determined to live out his fantasy world where he was a world-class ""lady killer"" (sex symbol). His ""cool"" rap was always silly and vapid although he never realized it.
The lame stretched-out silliness of this movie gets tiring after a short time of watching it. As a weekly short bit on SNL this was funny, but 90 minutes of it is much too much! The comedy writing just doesn't hold up for that length of time. Good writing is hard to come by anyway.
I will never watch this movie again.  :  -  (",1522022400,,620,4.327586206896552
