3176138,3,B0017XFSOM,"Overall, Season two of Hotel Babylon is pretty much fantasy on auto-pilot. The plot lines are mostly paper thin with little growth and development in the characters. There is no real over-riding story arch, but just a series of disconnected soapy episodes. The novelty has long since worn off from the narrative at the beginning and end of the show, and while it provides some minimal insight into the episodes, it often winds up sounding trite and unneccessary. Bottom line, season two is heavy on dazzle, and light on substance despite the effort of a fine cast.",1349481600,,564,4.824742268041237
3176139,4,B0017XFSOM,"I'm watching this series on Netflix while home sick with bronchitis.  For the most part, I've enjoyed it a very great deal.  The show provides a glimpse into a fictional five star hotel in London, which is a world that I'll never see behind from the perspective of an insider and probably won't see any time soon as a guest.  While some of the capers and scams the staff and guests get up to seem a bit exaggerated for dramatic purposes, a lot of the stories do have some factual basis I'm sure.

""Hotel Babylon"" seems to me to be a sort of combination of the much more inferior (and wholesome) ""Love Boat"" (with the regular cast being ""the crew"" interacting with various passengers and their storylines) and the superior British series ""Hustle"" (about goodhearted British con artists).  Stylistically, the series uses a lot of the same tricks that ""Hustle"" does (sped up action and other visual stunts).

The cast is superior and unlike some I actually like the character of Anna (maybe because she's so pretty and has that sexy British upper class accent).  The standout characters are Charlie, the super-concierge, and Max, the hotel manager.

The plots are fun most of the time with one of the best being when an all star British soccer team visits

The only major negative I would give the show is when they decide to have a plot that sends a sometimes overwrought political message:

1.  a preachy episode plot about illegal aliens featuring a heartless immigration inspector
2.  an episode plot featuring a Bosnian Serb war criminal whose resolution has the cast arguably colluding in a kidnapping and probably murder
3.  an episode plot that decries child labor in the fashion industry

Another fault is that the characters lie to each other an awful lot and I think that would pretty much erode trust and friendships.

But overall, I'd say that if you can suspend disbelief some, it's worth ""checking into"" Hotel Babylon for a little fun. Just remember ""What goes in Hotel Babylon, stays in Hotel Babylon.""",1297728000,,2015,4.76657060518732
3176140,4,B0017XFSOM,"This innovatively designed TV series tells the story of life inside a five star hotel in London. Little did we know what really went on! I always feel that in order to enjoy any story, there must be a protagonist that is in some way likable, someone we can relate to. In Hotel Babylon the entire hotel staff is sympathetic and you quickly get to know them as their beautifully crafted characters develop over time.  These hard working people share a secret life, a home away from home. Throughout all the bizarre goings on and demands of their rich, eccentric clientele, they manage to keep it all together, and in so doing they maintain their hotel's 5 star rating, preserving this rarefied world and ultimately, their symbiotic relationship with it.",1225324800,,751,4.776923076923077

The video is nice and bright wide screen and the audio is 5.1. This is something every family member would enjoy. Now i have to wait for season 3 to be released here in the US.

3176142,4,B0017XFSOM,"HOTEL BABYLON: SEASON TWO is an interesting 8 episodes to tackle.  Rather than continue existing storylines --- which there weren't many to begin with --- ""Series Two"", as they call it in UK, ups the ante in almost every way.  If you were unsure about whether HOTEL BABYLON was a comedy or a drama, you'll find out very quickly.

To me, the 1st Season was a fairly realistic portrayal of the insanity of luxury hotel work.  Believe me, I work in a hotel, and there is no glamour in it whatsoever.  But in true TV fashion, HOTEL BABYLON just exaggerated the details a bit, so that we could enjoy ourselves.  Well, actually the show's VERY exaggerated, but there's a degree of truth and conviction underneath the silliness.  The Second Season pretty much drops most of the dramatic arcs, and sort of becomes a parody of itself.  If you can imagine this, think it like a British live-action SIMPSONS --- nothing is off limits, the comedy is both broad & subtle, and the attention to detail is in the background as much as the foreground.

Is this change of pace a good thing?  To me, the season takes an episode or two to get off the ground.  I never disliked HOTEL BABYLON's sudden turn to even wilder adventures or more outlandish scenarios.  It's just that SEASON TWO's first few episodes are bit tame compared to rest of the incredible bunch.  In other words, the concept was always spot on, but the greatest episodes are saved for last.  We begin with silly stories like a college friends' reunion (you know where that one is going, right?).  But later, we get some very touching stories.  There's a betrayal from receptionist Ben's past, concierge Tony's desperation after a deal gone wrong, and Emma finally becomes less of a caricature.  Oh, and if you thought the 1st Season's finale was too unbelievable for your tastes, I promise you this one is much more grounded and (in my opinion) stronger.

Once you accept how little HOTEL BABYLON takes itself serious, you can enjoy yourself a lot more.  One of the best bits --- and don't worry, it's early in the Season --- is a poker game that's shot in a style that would make Sergio Leone laugh hysterically.  Speaking of style, the photography, music, casting, and production remain absolutely perfect.  The show's main theme is a tad silly, but again, so is the entire show.

So, does ""Series Two"" satisfy my needs, or do I feel its service was unsatisfactory?  Like any vacation, HOTEL BABYLON: SEASON TWO gets off to a rough start, but then doubles its efforts to make me a happy guest.  Sorry for the hotel cliches --- I figured since the series series threw traditions out the window that I could use them.

HOTEL BABYLON is on an excellent roll, 16 episodes and running.  Can't wait for the Third Season to reach the States.",1211241600,9,2784,4.619144602851324
