8458314,4,B0055HK6UM,"Puss In Boots: A Furry Tail is a simple story told with
workmanlike writing and a decent musical score.
The character voices are very well done.
If you appreciate Crusader Rabbit from the fifties or Rocky
and Bullwinkle from the sixties, you'll be at home here.
The tale is free of contemporary references so common in low
grade cartoons today. No ""attitude"" poses, no cheap references
to today's fads or so-called hip culture. Your kids will not
be contaminated with the trashy ideas so common in cartoons now.
This is a very low budgeted film that will not offend or alienate
and will most likely entertain your kids.
Director Darrell Van Citters was quoted as saying that if the
writers came up with a scene that would cost more than $1.98,
that scene was bound for the round file.
As a student of animation, I studied the DVD closely for ideas
on animating economically. My time was well spent.
Your little Kids will be entertained for a while.
You won't be offended. What more can you ask for in a little cartoon?",1327276800,,1018,4.5989010989010985
8458315,5,B0055HK6UM,"Normally, Gaiam release meh kid movie titles like ""Chop Kick Panda"" and ""What's Up: Balloon to the Rescue!"" which the kids and I dislike. Mainly because they were not at all original ideas. But, I was willing to get this film for them since the tales of Puss in Boots was told by many people (not just the Dreamwork's ver of him coming out soon) out though the years. Let me tell you; I'm glad that I did get this for them.

Pros: This story is mostly an after tale from the original story. In a nutshell; Russ, I mean Puss is missing and the King is in search for him. Doing this time a side plot and another event happens and it's up to Russ to save the King. (I mean Puss) It's sounds like I should have added more info about the side plot and the main one, but that will spoiled most of the film for you. Overall, the story is good; not the best, but it's more original this time around.

The animation of the film is not 3D, but 2D. The art style is about the same as the old Hanna-Barbera cartoons which I'm a fan of. It's has a nice and sharp picture like ""Chop Kick Panda"" so it will look nice on your HDTV w/ DVD or Blu-ray player upconverted to 1080p.

The humor is to your today's pop culture. The kids laughed at a few of the jokes. I must say; that even I laughed at them. For the most part the jokes are ok for kids; up to Cartoon Network and Nick Toons standards.

And lastly; the voice overs are really good. Puss was voiced vary well w/ him even speaking French from time to time.

Cons: The only thing I can think of is that this film was too short. The kids were left wanting more. Ha ha, me to in fact.

Buy or Rent?: Yes, It's a must buy. I only hope more cartoons from Gaiam are as good as this one in the near future. Kids like it; I liked it.",1319241600,4,1766,3.988668555240793
