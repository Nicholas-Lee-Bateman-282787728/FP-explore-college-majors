7543853,5,B018AXRLN2,"Awesome movie!!! Definitely a fun ride!! Full of suspense,  mystery and humor. Reminds me of the classic Hitchcock movies mixed with modern horror. Also, NOT a gore fest! Which is a nice break from the run of the mill, paint by number, low budget shlock.
Check it out and enjoy the twists and turns!!",1456963200,4,300,4.555555555555555

7543855,5,B018AXRLN2,"Saw this movie at a party and it was so much fun!  There were a lot of silly, funny parts and a surprise ending that most people will never guess.  I could see this movie being a cult classic like The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  I want to see it again as I missed part of the dialog from my friends cracking jokes and laughing. I thought the best actress in the movie was Tammy Kaitz as she played a very lively, quirky and interesting character named Laurie.  If you don't take the movie seriously it can be a lot of fun!",1455926400,,522,4.088235294117647
7543856,5,B018AXRLN2,this movie was so funny yet kind of twisted! I loved it so much,1455840000,4,63,3.5714285714285716
7543857,4,B018AXRLN2,I have watched this movie three times this week! My kids loved it and I've let my friends know to check it out. There were a lot of laughs along with some good blood and guts splashed in there. And the plot twist totally surprised us all! Guess you really never know someone!!! I highly suggest watching it and can't wait for the next movie by Mike Gutridge!,1455580800,4,358,4.279411764705882

7543859,2,B018AXRLN2,"Pretty low budget and not much to offer, only reason i watched it was because of the Friday the 13th connection with Tracie Savage and Paul Kratka but i wouldn't advise anybody watch this film.",1455148800,3,193,4.542857142857143

7543861,1,B018AXRLN2,This was awful. Tracie Savage was a better actress at 8 years old than she is now. The entire cast was dreadful. Jason the dog was the only redeeming character. Don't waste your time with this crap-fest.,1510444800,,203,4.513513513513513
7543862,3,B018AXRLN2,"It's been awhile since an ending surprised me.  That alone gives it three stars.  Other than that, it was kinda weird, I think it reached for humor but only hit the mark a few times.  The gory parts were pretty good.",1510358400,,216,4.219512195121951

7543864,1,B018AXRLN2,Terrible movie with worse acting .  Story started out good  but became worse as it went along.  The dog was likeable but the cast was terrible.  A waste of money spent on the production.,1509580800,,186,4.382352941176471

7543867,4,B018AXRLN2,"I thought it was pretty good. I really enjoyed watching. There was a lot of twist and turns in this movie. Pretty cool. Definitely entertaining. Yeah, I think it's definitely worth four stars.",1508630400,,192,4.848484848484849
7543868,3,B018AXRLN2,"** 2-1/2 Stars ** Yes, those 20-something actors from ""Friday the 13th"" (Parts 1-3) are now almost 50-somethings, and a lot of them show up for Mike Gutridge's 2014 film, ""The Bone Garden.""  Despite feeling like an 'R' rated Lifetime channel flick, 'Bone Garden' can be fun, and has more than a few twists. Acting and production values are about like 1980's 'Friday the 13th' ... but without the gore and the low-budget genius of Sean S. Cunningham.  All in all, a fun flick except for the really pedestrian performances by actors who should (all these years later) be capable of much better.  Thanks for reading.",1508544000,2,613,4.764150943396227
7543869,4,B018AXRLN2,"Gotta love a movie that starts out running. Grandma has a flat tire on a deserted road, fixes it, up comes shadow man with a shovel in his hand, you get the image, and it just keeps gettin better. Quite a little thriller horror with plenty of suspense and build up. A really great who dun it along with the horror aspects. Alice Hardy (Tracie Savage) seems like a normal, respectable woman. Quite the opposite of her slimball, cheating college professor husband. But she is surrounded with mysterious events when a number of people from the neighboring college and even her own next door neighbors go missing. She already suspects the male neighbor of murdering his wife, and her husbands secret girlfriend is one of the missing as well? This one will keep you on edge as the mystery unwinds and the saying, ""You never really know somebody' certainly rings true in the twisted ending. Most excellent!",1507680000,4,900,4.738853503184713

7543871,1,B018AXRLN2,"I did NOT intend to play this. Thought I initiated a sample and only seen a few seconds of credits, then a month later it showed on the bill. Amazon Streaming App REMOVED!
(I did look into disputing it, but rules said only the 1st 24 hours can be disputed. Your app needs better safeguards, or it will never see my Roku again!)
Review not aimed at The Bone Garden as a movie, but at Amazon Prime's Streaming system.",1485993600,,415,4.265822784810126
7543872,4,B018AXRLN2,"A fun, creepy romp that's as much about the ""horror"" of relationships (be they at home or in the workplace) as it is about evil that people do.  The writer/director, Mike Gutridge, has made a sly horror movie that's clearly a love letter to great directors like John Carpenter and Alfred Hitchcock, but also has its own unique voice.  Good, playful performances by both Tracie Savage and Tammy Kaitz add greatly to The Bone Garden.  I've seen a lot of horror movies and it's refreshing to have the leads be over the age of 25.  They play off of one another very well and make their characters both entertaining and refreshingly different than the typical heroines of so many lesser-made slasher movies.  Nicely done!!!",1476921600,2,718,4.758064516129032
7543873,5,B018AXRLN2,This movie kept you guessing from beginning until end with many twists and turns!!  The ending truly caught me off guard!  I enjoyed every moment!!,1473033600,4,147,4.84
7543874,1,B018AXRLN2,Terrible acting. Tried to have a surprise ending which would have worked if the acting was better.,1473033600,,98,4.823529411764706
7543875,4,B018AXRLN2,"I liked the movie, however I think the main character went a little over board, with the crazy ,  yes the crazy one or was it both and neither woman knew about the other being as crazy ...... I almost didn't understand the movie  but then I realized both women were men haters. but also hated  the girls the men were involved with where one had her trunk stuffed with things while the other  hid her things in the middle of the corn field...... It was definetly  creepy but why didn't they hate each other or did they just not know. Ron Millkie my friend and teacher was great tho acted and looked a real cop always sneaking around..... Bravo Ron you were amazing.",1471305600,3,664,4.32258064516129
7543876,5,B018AXRLN2,"For the budget, this Movie has great color and sound quality. It is unlike the predictable plots you usually see in this genre of film. The movie keeps you guessing till the end. Btw, don't turn it off until you're sure you've seen the final scene...",1468540800,3,250,4.456521739130435

8741879,2,B018AXRLN2,"""He was here about and hour ago, but he left.""

That sentence sent me packing my popcorn and ice tea. WIth twenty three minutes left, I lament the time I spent on this movie.

Who in their right mind says this to the only other person in the room. Isn't it a foregone conclusion? No one is in a room so you have to announce that they are not in the room. The sentence should read, ""He was here about an hour ago, I don't know when he left.""",1536278400,,440,3.932584269662921
8741880,2,B018AXRLN2,"Murder She Wrote without Angela Lansbury's charm but with all the busybody. Couldn't stand the woman, her friend, the husband, etc. Did like the dog. Then it got really, really stupid. I can see it. ""Lets make a movie and get all the gang together, I bet people will watch. A bit of nostalgia should do it."" Well it did not do it for me. Worse part, the OVER ACTING at the end. I guess it was supposed to be funny, but by then I was so sick and tired of this mess, that I wanted to barf instead.",1536105600,,495,4.01010101010101
8741881,5,B018AXRLN2,"A real treat for fans of the Friday the 13th franchise, as it stars Tracie Savage, Ron Millkie, and Paul Kratka.  While low budget, it's a labor of love, and full of references to classic horror flicks, particularly those of John Carpenter.  In that respect, it reminded me of Night of the Creeps.  The story is reminiscent of Rear Window, about a housewife who witnesses some strange goings-on that escalate in the neighborhood, and eventually pull her into the drama.  There's also nods to Thelma & Louise, and some sick & twisted wackiness of Motel Hell, too.  The score is particularly interesting, and seemed to be a play on John Carpenter's evolving styles, starting with simple piano music, then synthesizer, and finally ambient rock.  Nice drama in the first half about middle-aged characters (rather than the typical teenagers,) a dissolving marriage, midlife crisis, and some funny moments with a promiscuous ""cougar"" character.  Mostly a thriller, it finally goes full on horror for the finale, and the gore effects are quite effective.  It's a lot of fun, and inspirational for low budget film makers.",1527033600,,1113,5.043715846994536
8741882,5,B018AXRLN2,I am not a big scary movie person but i loved it!!....For me this was a really tense thriller with a great twist in the end.,1521676800,,124,3.8076923076923075
8741883,5,B018AXRLN2,"Great movie to put on some night with the lights off and a storm brewing outside.  Lots of atmospheric fun, complete with some twists and turns you'll never see coming.  The filmmakers obviously have a lot of love for the genre, and it shows.",1521158400,2,242,4.4772727272727275
8741884,5,B018AXRLN2,A great low budget horror film that's the perfect thing to watch for a night on the couch with some popcorn.,1520553600,,108,4.190476190476191
8741885,1,B018AXRLN2,Thought it would be the movie version of the Tess Gerritsen novel - it wasn't. Very dissapointed.,1520121600,,97,4.764705882352941
8741886,5,B018AXRLN2,"This movie was amazing!!  A REALLY well written script (which is rare for low budget thrillers) and a tight plot with PLENTY of twists!  Anyone who gives this film a bad review simply doesn't understand what the filmmaker was trying to accomplish!  One idiot even panned it because it did not stream properly!!  Like that's the filmmaker's fault!!!  If you're looking for a slow burn, if your looking for a who-dun-it in the vein of Alfred Hitchcock, then THIS is the film for you!!  If all you want is paint-by-numbers boobs and gore, then skip this one!!  Plus, it was great seeing FRIDAY THE 13TH alumni in a movie again!!  Especially Tracie and Paul from Part 3!!  So, pay attention to how well written the script is, sit back and enjoy an old school (John Carpenter/Alfred Hitchcock) thriller!!  Oh, and I really loved all the in-jokes!!  This movie celebrates film and filmmaking!!  Plain and simple!  Don't listen to the haters!!",1519084800,2,936,4.775
8741887,5,B018AXRLN2,Great movie with an amazing plot! I definitely did not see that ending coming!! Definitely some great twists in there and a movie you must watch a few times!!,1518998400,,158,4.482758620689655
