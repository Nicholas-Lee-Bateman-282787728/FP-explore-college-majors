Autre petite dception, la langue disponible n'est qu'en franais. Ca se laisse regarder toutefois^^

Nice movies, pleasant to see, but I have to say you haven't to be too perspicacious with the history (Fleur de lys's royal blue flag is adopted by kings two or three centuries after Charlemagne's reign, franks soldiers look like more beduins and no brogne at sight, except for frank counts XD). Anyway, it remains nice movies to watch.",1322956800,,749,4.928571428571429
7853802,5,6303704786,"I ordered this movie (VHS) as a gift for a friend, but later noticed the product description says it is in French, which surprised me since the version I had seen was in English.  Fortunately my friend said it was actually in English, but if you order it you may want to verify the language with the seller.  This is a great film and worth seeing!

2011 Update: I noticed that the VHS product description no longer mentions the language at all, but that there is now a DVD available (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlemagne-2-DVD-French-only/dp/B003TNW01C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlemagne 2 DVD (French only)</a>) which is listed as ""French only"", so it looks like there are French versions out there.  Sure wish they would release the DVD in English!",1262044800,19,799,5.471544715447155
7853803,5,6303704786,"I'm a medievalist, and believe me, I've seen some HORRIBLE movies set in the time period. This is not one of them, perhaps because Hollywood had nothing to do with it. The storyline loosely follows the account written by Einhard, and Christian Brendel's portrayal of Charles is believable and even moving. The costumes and sets are very nicely done, and the cast- mostly French and Italian- is certainly not the usual pretty faces from Beverly Hills. This is a series I watch over and over and always enjoy. Yes, I have to stop and tell students ""This is not exactly what happened here. The historical account is..."" occasionally, but the digressions are usually not too bad, and make some sense within the context. This is a series I can recommend for classroom use as well as personal enjoyment.",1248566400,10,797,4.782608695652174
7853804,3,6303704786,"Prior to viewing this series about Charlemagne I knew about him in name only.
The acting, cinematography and the overall ""feel"" of the series is excellent and was most entertaining.
What I found unfortunate is that certain aspects of his life were treated with little more than a few moments on film when in actual life I'm certain they were far more significant and had greater consequences than were shown on the screen.
In addition, the fact that the story ends so abruptly leaves one wondering if there had been an intention to create additional videos but the money had run out.
Overall it was great entertainment but with the ending as it was, a series that I would gladly have given 4-5 stars has ended up with the mediocre rating of three.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlemagne-1994-5pc/dp/6303704786/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlemagne (1994) (5pc)</a>",1204329600,3,907,5.579710144927536
7853805,4,6303704786,"I watched this with my father when it first aired.  Both us us being history buffs, the six hours was easy to sit through on a sunday afternoon....and evening.  Historically accurate with minor artistic liscence, this miniseries ranks well above most others in the genre.  Though I haven't seen it since its initial broadcast, I hope that it will come to DVD soon.  If not, Ill have to check ebay unless the VHS comes back into print",1146182400,2,433,4.584415584415584

7853808,4,6303704786,"I really like Charlemagne, as he falls into my period of studies. My husband loves Charlemagne. This man is his hero. This was one of only two films I found ever to be made of the great ruler. This was the only one I could actually buy.
Like one reviewer, his life was chopped up for this film. There were also certain things portrayed wrong, such as Charlemagne's joy at being crowned by the Pope. In reality, Charlemagne had been tricked by the Pope and was NOT happy about it. He felt the Pope was not to be involved with ruling and rulers in that way.
The ending was also dissappointing. The film took him only so far in his life. Charlemagne did more than what the movie showed. I figured the five hours would cover to his death. It did not.
As far as a movie is concerned, then this was good. Even though the ending was too quick. And heck, the actor playing Charlemagne was kind of cute too. But that's just me as a female talking.",1045008000,16,938,4.245810055865922
