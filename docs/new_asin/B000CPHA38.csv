8100089,3,B000CPHA38,"Volume 10 includes episodes 55 to 60. Overall this volume is OK with some good episodes. Others have interesting premises, but the resulting episodes could have been better. As for the actors' commentary on episode 60, there's not much insight on the episode.  It's rather a conversation focusing on the actors' backgrounds and careers.

55.  The Daring Mini-Submarine:  Berg Katse tries to blackmail Dr. Nambu and the Science Ninja Team into surrendering to him by polluting the oceans one by one.  Gatchaman and his team pretend to go along with Berg Katse's game but their plan backfires when a series of misjudgments by our heroes (see, they are very human) causes the release of more poison and puts the God Phoenix in danger. This is not the usual episode in which the good guys prevent the disaster from happening.  Instead, it's Berg Katse who unintentionally saves the day.  Unfortunately, the pace of this episode is unusually slow.  [2 1/2 stars]

56.  The Bird Missile of Bitterness:  Jun runs into her childhood friend, Koji, who had disappeared 3 years ago.  In spite of all the evidence, Jun refuses to believe that Koji is working for Galactor.  In the meantime, Koji is also running into trouble with his ""employer.""  Now that he knows that Jun is around, he hesitates to complete his destructive missions.  This is a Jun episode and the story of two friends who must make tough decisions because they have become enemies.  [3 stars]

57. The Evil White Sea: Mike Miller, a sharp shooter, has been released from prison after 35 years.  He's now an old man but he remains an excellent marksman. Berg Katse hires him to get rid of the Science Ninja Team.  Katse provides him with a weapon and 5 special bullets that kill by freezing its victims. On the South Pole, each member of the Science Ninja Team faces up Miller in a duel.  I still cannot understand why this episode is entitled ""The Evil White Sea"" as it has nothing to do with the sea.  But watch it just to find out why Ryu has always had to stay behind. [3 stars]

58.  Hell's Mecha-Buttha: Berg Katse has stolen ISO's prototype of the Jet Cutter and installed it in his new mecha, a four-faced Buddha.  Dr. Nambu orders the Science Ninja Team to either recover or destroy the Jet Cutter. Ken, still seeking revenge, goes reluctantly.  As they battle the Mecha-Buttha, he has to overcome his personal feelings and be a leader to his team. [3 1/2 stars]

59.  The Secret of the Monster Mecha Factory:  Jun and Ken investigate strange goings-on on Ghost Island.  They find a mecha factory where Galactor's scientists are about to present their latest creation to Berg Katse.  Our heroes infiltrate the factory and not only does Gatchaman have a chance to capture Katse, but also to unmask him--only that Katse is up to his tricks again. [4 stars]

60.  Science Ninja Team, Number G-6: Ken rescues the only survivor of a mysterious crash.  The young man is suffering from amnesia but Dr. Nambu suspects he has a connection with Galactor and perhaps information about Katse's new mecha, the Sky Squealer.  The young man proves to be so skillful at handling some of the team's weapons that Jinpei starts to call him G-6, the sixth member of the team.  However, Berg Katse and his men, afraid that the young man will reveal the secret of the Sky Squealer, are determined to silence him forever. [4 stars]",1172361600,,3374,4.689948892674617
