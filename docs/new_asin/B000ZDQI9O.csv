3039190,5,B000ZDQI9O,I liked this documentary because it's told from John Wilkes Boothe's perspective. Usually the Lincoln assassination is told from the Lincoln perspective.

3039203,5,B000ZDQI9O,"What a fantastic documentary on the assassin John Wilkes Booth! Most, if not all, know the story of this man as he is the first Presidential Assassin in American History and that he killed Abraham Lincoln, one of our Country's best Presidents.

Detailed here by the History Channel is a 90 minute documentary with very informative bits of facts and information probably not well known unless you have seen this.
 It delves deeper into the mentality of this man and his cohorts that conspired the killing. It also goes into details about how most of the people that were involved in this tragic event died or lived out their lives well after Mr. Lincoln's passing. That I found very interesting to know.

 It does not say though that when John Wilkes Booth died, Stanton ordered his body returned to Washington and had it buried along with the other conspirators for a short time. It was then exhumed and buried in his family plot in an unmarked grave. (That is from the PBS documentary on Lincoln.)
Well done and highly recommended for ALL Americans to learn from!",1426550400,,1064,4.704301075268817

It does touch on why some historians believe that there is a conspiracy, but mainly sticks to the facts as we know them.

3039215,5,B000ZDQI9O,"After reading Killing Lincoln by Bill O'Reilly, I became quite interested in all the history that surrounded Lincoln's Presidency and of course, his assassination. I thought I was well versed in the details that John Wilkes Booth had shot Lincoln while he was attending an event at the Ford's Theater.
There is so much more to the story of the assassination and the characters who conspired with John Wilkes Booth to not only kill Lincoln but assassinate other top level leaders in the government leaving the US floundering. John Wilkes Booth had an evil entourage assisting him in the plans to kill Lincoln. Even a woman was one of the conspirators and was the first woman who was hanged as punishment for her crime. This DVD will keep you on the edge of your seat as you see how each person in this conspiracy had a role to play and when the house of cards began to crumble it left John Wilkes Booth in a predicament that he could not act his way out of. An excellent portrayal of the days leading up to and following the plan to kill Mr. Lincoln.",1371081600,2,1049,4.46875
3039216,5,B000ZDQI9O,"Everyone knows that John Wilkes Booth murdered Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theater, then jumped onto the stage, broke his ankle, shouted at the audience (reportedly ""Sic Semper Tyrannis""), and ran. Most people also know he was cornered and shot by soldiers. What many people don't know is that it took almost two weeks to hunt him down, and what happened during that time is an incredibly gripping story.

Booth believed his act would bring him great honor and adulation in the South, and might even give the Confederates the hope and courage to fight on. In fact, most people - Northern and Southern alike - were repulsed by Booth's heinous act and considered it cowardly and appalling. Many Southerners realized Lincoln's plan for reintegrating the South into the Union was an unexpectedly generous and merciful one - ""with malice toward none"" - but his murder, along with the vicious attack on Secretary of State William Seward by one of Booth's fellow conspirators, put an end to any merciful treatment of the former Confederates. Vengeance and retribution became the order of the day, and a harsh Reconstruction created tragic conflicts and resentments that still have adverse repercussions today. In short, by murdering Lincoln, Booth achieved the exact opposite of what he'd intended. He brought down a wrath upon the South that would echo for generations.

Had this crime happened today, Booth would have been quickly - if not immediately - apprehended. But in 1865, the President was barely guarded and the theater audience was stunned into inaction. Some even thought the assassination was part of the show, especially since Booth was so well-known and easily recognized. At the time, the territory between Washington, DC and Northern Virginia was heavily forested and, in some areas, very boggy. There were few inhabitants. Accompanied only by a somewhat dim-witted accomplice, Booth struggled to find help, shelter, and food. Those he thought would be eager to help him wanted nothing to do with him. He knew he was being hunted, and his situation became more and more desperate. That manhunt, along with Booth's physical and emotional deterioration, is an edge-of-the-seat story in itself. And really quite an incredible one, given the conditions of the time.

This video is highly recommended!",1368057600,6,2305,5.141333333333334

I bought this when I bought Lincoln with Hal Holbrook.  My aunt had seen the Spielberg movie.  We were talking about both Lincoln movies.  I told her about this one, sent it to her with the Holbrook one too.  Unfortunately, I don't think she had watched either as she passed away the end of February, a couple of weeks ago.  She would of liked both.",1362873600,,526,4.360824742268041

8235281,5,B000ZDQI9O,"This a great adventure, historically relevant and significant. The hunt for Booth is chronicled here with almost eerie detail, plus a little background on the nation's first presidential assassin. Day by day for twelve days Booth is tracked by the Union soldiers. With each passing day Booth's delusion of grandeur passes as the nation mourns one of it's greatest leaders and vows unrepentant revenge. We are given very vivid details of the era, glimpses inside Ford's Theater, Samuel R Mudd Museum, and the lot where Garrett's tobacco farm once stood not to mention actual photos of the gallows where the conspirators are put to death. It stands as a monument to a much loved president as well as Police procedure in tracking down the assassin.",1448323200,,745,4.968
