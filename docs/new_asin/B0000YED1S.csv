It walks you  through the selection for full-frame or widescreen, then the selection for DTS  or Dolby Digital 5.1.  It was very simple, no looking around for the audio and  video selection, like some DVD's.  In DTS, the sound is incredible.  In Dolby  Digital 5.1, the sound is only slightly less so.
The film is fabulous overall.  ""Coral Reef Adventure"" won the Giant  Screen Theatre Association's Best Film of 2003.  I can see why.  It was filmed on location in Australia, Fiji,  Rangiroa, Tahiti, and the United States.  The music is by Crosby,  Stills, Nash.  The movie opens with ""Teach Your Children Well"".  I loved it.  There is also some music that sounds like native singing, acoustic instruments,  and percussion. The video is spectacular. The colors are crisp and clear.  Without a doubt, this movie has some of the best audio and video that I have  heard and seen on a nature film. The display on a 65 inch rear projection TV is  spellbinding. There is one short scene of hang-gliding in the mountains that is  breath-taking.
Disc 2 is for the computer only.  (The  minimum requirements for the computer are Windows XP; Windows Media Player 9  Series (included on the disc) or Windows XP Media Center Edition; 2.4 GHz  processor; 384 MB of RAM; 64 MB video card, DVD-rom drive; 1024x768 screen  resolution; 16 bit sound card; and speakers.)  When I inserted the DVD into the  computer, it smoothly installed the required Windows Media Series 9 (and did not  require a reboot!)  It played the high definition picture beautifully.  The  movie is widescreen and plays in Dolby Digital 5.1 mode. The computer has only two very cheap-looking speakers, and the sound was surprisingly good.
The underwater scenes of the coral reefs and marine life  are beautiful, the sound is awesome, the ""Making of"" Feature is one that I enjoy  on all the Imax movies. There are some sad moments as the movie discusses the  destruction of the coral reefs.  Recommended.",1073347200,,2023,4.8240469208211145
1958884,5,B0000YED1S,"I may be a bit biased- as I have dived all the reefs shown in this movie, and have enjoyed diving in Fiji with Rusi Vulakoro, focus of the film (and dove with Rusi again for two weeks in November 2003, for the last time, as he has now retired.) The footage is superb- showing Australia's enormous Great Barrier Reef, French Polynesia's Rangiroa Atoll (with a huge school of about 300 grey whalers / grey reef sharks) and lots of Fiji's world-class reefs- from its spectacular soft corals to the eutrophication of a once-vital reef just offshore to one of Fiji's islands. One even sees how the huge IMAX camera is maneuvered in ""Rangi's"" stiff currents, as well as in 107 meters / 350 feet of depth as cinematographer Howard Hall and scientist Richard Pyle discover fish completely new to science, using CIS Lunar Mark 4-P rebreathers.
The sound track is excellent, the footage outstanding, and the explanation of why coral reefs are failing, while basic, is quite accurate: overfishing of reef inhabitants, silt from logging and development, and waters warmed by the global warming some still deny and the El Ni?o / Southern Oscillation phenomenon.
Unfortunately gone missing in the simplification are fishing for aquarium specimens and food fish with cyanide, dynamite fishing, coral removal for various commercial schemes, and inflow of insecticides and fertilizers, as on barrier reefs off Australia and Central America. And some explanations and scenes are, shall we say, a little bit ""embellished"" up for effect... but in the end, this is an awesome movie. Divers will love it, those who do not dive will begin to get an idea of why we who do actually dive and travel to such wonderful places. Those concerned about reefs' well-being will be gratified there is some information how people can help conserve reefs, with some prominent mention being given to NGO Reef Check and its activities involving sport divers.
If you enjoy underwater film, this is a ""MUST SEE"". A very good supporting book (Living Mirrors: A Coral Reef Adventure, by Jack Stephens, Umbrage Editions, ISBN 1-8844167-26-8) is available, and Coral Reef Adventure is also available in VHS and DVD editions; I bought the DVD, and it's nice to still be able to see Rusi diving and all Fiji's underwater denizens, even when I am at home.",1061942400,9,2307,4.917948717948718

1958902,1,B0000YED1S,"Although some of this video has good views of coral reefs, it is only a backdrop for a diatribe against the myth of global warming.  Inland logging of the rainforest and fishing are even blamed for alleged destruction of coral reefs.  The video starts stating that ""..corral reefs have been growing for 60 million years"" yet they are trying to tell you that although these reefs have survived volcanoes, the ice age and movement of the earth's plates, mankind is destroying the reefs at ""an alaming rate.""

As a diver who has over the last 43 years dived all over the globe, I have seen good and bad reefs but I believe it is natural for the reefs to ebb and flow as it is natural for all parts of the natural world to do so.  This video uses underwater photograpic ""tricks"" to push their agenda.  The color red washes out rather quickly underwater and requires light to see it.  When they show a ""healthy reef,"" they use their light to ""light up"" the reef, showing off the colors.  When they show a ""dying"" reef, the lights are off showing the reef as it really appears to the naked eye, a bluist grey.

If you have bought in to man-caused global warming, you'll love this video.  If on the otherhand you believe in truth, you'll find it annoying.

1958909,5,B0000YED1S,"I am so glad I ordered this...not only is it very colorful in Blue-ray, but also very informative about the devistating and horrific destruction of our earth's gorgeous coral reefs. Before I saw this, I had no idea how important our coral reefs are for our world, our ecosystem. Nothing on earth can survive without them. We need them like we need air. Fish and corals can not live with out each other. Coral need the fish in the sea to clean them, and the fish need the corals to provide them food and shelter (homes). If one is gone, the other won't survive. And then, we can not survive. It is a great film and so glad they produced it. It is very important that everyone should view this! I give it a 5 star rating. The photography/filming is excellent quality. Length is about an hour to an hour and a half.",1336521600,,812,4.313725490196078

1958931,4,B0000YED1S,"Liam Neeson narrates a 45 minute documentary on the benefits of coral reefs on the eco-system on the ocean.  This film focuses on the Great Barrier Reef (northeast of Australia) and also the islands of Figi and Tahiti, which is east of the Great Barrier Reef.

You learn a lot about the interplay between fish and other creatures and their dependence on the reef for shelter, and food.  And the reef survives because small eat the bacteria that grows on the reef; otherwise, the algae would suffocate the reef and it would die.  So their is a interdependence on the reef and the surrounding aquatic life around it.

Stunning photography and filming are also a part of this documentary.

What I didn't want is to be PREACHED to about the ecology of disappearing reefs - which is a serious problem, but NOT what this film purports to be.  And, I didn't care about seeing tax-payer funded university types wasting money endlessly repeating experiments finished by others.  They are so obviously desperate to justify their priveleged life style it they try to convince you reef proximity to shore is worthy of months-long studies by numerous funded (and volunteer) biologists and divers.",1312243200,2,541,5.056179775280899

1958936,2,B0000YED1S,"I agree with the other reviewers who were disappointed with this DVD.  The video is only about 40 minutes long, and way too much time was spent watching divers on the boat getting ready to dive, viewing Fiji greeting customs, and hearing that global warming is a really bad thing.  I fully agree with that, but I don't need to be ""educated"" all the time - I get it, now let me watch coral reefs, and fish, in amazing hi-def.  I'll write a check for the rest!  I don't dive, and I never will.  Videos like this can be my substitute for the real thing.  The actual coral reef photography was really pretty amazing in Blu-Ray, there just wasn't that much of it and that is what I was looking for, not a South Pacific travelogue and environmental education.  There are quite a few of these I-Max videos available in Blu-Ray and I'm sure the photography is amazing.  Based on experience with this video I'll try these out on Netflix, see if they really devote the video to the the subject advertised in the title,  and then decide if I want to really buy for myself.  I guess I give it a 5 for the (way too short) actual reef video, and a 1 for the rest of the dreck.",1271721600,8,1162,4.240909090909091

1958939,1,B0000YED1S,"Coral Reef Adventure: 3 out of 10: Do you like pretty pictures? Do you hate Global Warming (boo hiss)? Do you like the music of Crosby Stills and Nash? Let me repeat that last question again because this is very very important.... Do you really like the music Crosby Stills and Nash ? Even if it is remixed and sung by starving children to a Peter Gabriel back up band?

If you answers are yes to all three questions, then you might enjoy Global Reef Adventure. Everyone else above 12 should check their eyeballs before watching, as rolling them this much could cause permanent damage.

This is the story of a husband and wife team who investigate the death of a village's reef in Fiji. It turns out the villain was.... Hold on before I give away the big surprise let me explain a few things. My girlfriend and I had just finished watching John Hurt in Michael Radford's Nineteen Eighty-Four and I put this documentary on because I thought a nice short colorful coral reef film might be nice after such a grey depressing movie. (Plus a piece of coral was a feature object in the former drab film so I was going for a subtle synergy).

Little did I know I was putting on a piece of propaganda so heavy handed that Big Brother himself would have blushed. Look no matter how you feel about global warming the villain in this piece was clearly those nice Fijians who were logging and overfishing and killed their own damn reef. The movie clearly shows this and then completely ignores its own findings to declare global warming the boogey man (Though in this particular case it was obviously innocent. As local reefs not near the GIANT SILT RUNNOFF and not located IN THE FISHING GROUNDS were thriving.)

But the Fijians can't be guilty of course because they look so cute in their Sunday best and they have quite a haunting rendition of Marrakesh Express. Such propaganda, no matter how well intentioned, needs to be called to the carpet. In particular when it is aimed towards children.

The film has other faults as well. It is over produced by half with wipes and sound effects that sound like they belong in a Disney Ducktales movie. Top billed Liam Neeson narrates for all of a minute and top billed Jean-Michel Cousteau appears for about as long.

This probably isn't that bad a film with the mute on. For one thing you would miss the appeal at the end to support politicians who hate global warming (boo hiss). Apparently 2 plus 2 does sometimes equal 5.",1268870400,11,2458,4.549773755656108

It basically follows a 10 month journey of two underwater photographers as they investigate coral reefs in a variety of conditions throughout the South Pacific.  Inspiring, moving, sometimes sad, the film will truly make you want to do something to save coral reef ecosystems before it is too late.  The underwater imagery is breathtaking in 1080P with some scenes looking like you are viewing the fish and corals in an aquarium and the narrative moves along nicely as you follow these two individuals on their dives.

I personally liked the story and there were some fascinating, and thoughtprovoking, things in the story that kept me captivated.  I've seen many Blu-Ray nature discs, and I was expecting more of the same for this one, but actually was pleasantly surprised by the story to go with it.

Quality wise - I don't think it's as top notch as the Earth series, but it's close in some respects.  Soundtrack is excellent as many reviewers have noted - awesome soundtrack, and some great songs in there that match the video perfectly.

The rest of the disk is beautifully photographed and the images are sharp and clear. The problem is with the writing and editing and what has gone into the production.  There are too many people and not enough reef. It should have been titled Fiji adventure, because that is where most of it is filmed, with a bit in Australia and Tahiti. That represents a miniscule portion of the world's reefs. Yet even these are not described and identified in much detail. The narrative is annoyingly preachy about global warming and the soundtrack is improbably Crosby, Stills, and Nash, though what they have to do with scuba diving is never explained. As a documentary it is also Imax-short, and does not rise at all above what you can see on Nature or National Geographic every week on TV. It is unbelievably stated that this production cost $10 million, though where it went is not evident. You also have to wonder why on earth the National Science Foundation is funding something like this with tax dollars.

Rusi and Jean-Michel Cousteau demonstrate some of what they are doing to preserve this paradise.

The McGillivray-Freeman production and Michele and photography is top notch, and our friends Rob and Cat, owners of the liveaboard dive boat NAI'A used for the filming, guided Howard and Michele Hall to all our favorite sites - their cinematography is superb, in spite of the major problems faced by using the huge and unwieldy IMAX system.

I thought the movie was going to be all about the coral reefs; that is, all underwater with stunning video images but a lot of it was old people in scuba gear talking.

Some depressing overtones.  Constant reminders that coral reefs are dying due to global warming and other repercussions of human effects on earth.

Other depressing elements.  We're told that a man nearly died from the bends, and then we see him going into another very deep dive, threatening that he will get it again.  We're told that several people were viciously bitten by sharks, and then we see people in the midst of hundreds of dangerous sharks, ""partying"" with them for an hour.  It is frustrating and pointless to annoy us with these dangers because the participants themselves are voluntarily putting themselves in danger.

Here, worry with me while I do something dangerous because I choose to.

Instead of being a celebration of coral reefs, this film is a plea for help, and a depressing one.  It is a downer.  Its saving grace is that the video is beautiful.  Hey, if I could get rid of the knuckleheads who run my country I would.  I'd elect other knuckleheads who would take global warming more seriously.  But there's nothing I can do, Charlie, and that's the sad truth.

The soundtrack is a lot of old music by Crosby Stills and Nash.  Teach.  Your children well.  I'm not a big CSN fan.",1141776000,4,1354,4.661016949152542
1959053,5,B0000YED1S,This DVD captured the attention of our 5 & 7 year old girls and held it all the way through!  My husband and I loved the sights and the music.  It is an overall wonderfully relaxing documentary of some of the prettiest coral reefs.  I highly recommend it.,1140739200,,255,4.270833333333333
1959054,4,B0000YED1S,It's a great to have HD content even before the HD-DVD or Blue Ray discs start shipping. Picture and sound quality are great. I don't see any difference betwen the 720p and 1080p resolutions although my projector is only 720p.,1140652800,,226,4.675
1959055,2,B0000YED1S,"Sure, they capture some great footage, but most of it is above the surface of the water.  BBC's Blue Planet series does a much better job below the surface and explains more about the interaction of life on the reefs.

This work spends most of its time preaching (to the choir as it were, since those who would choose to watch it are likely stewards of one form or another) about the various factors that have an effect on the underwater.  Very over-dramatic and tends to ""dumb it down"" for their perceived audience.  Very dissapointing.",1138838400,5,537,4.621052631578947

1959057,1,B0000YED1S,"I wish I had read a more critical review before purchasing this DVD, so here's mine:

Beautiful photography and wish I'd seen it in an IMAX theatre.  As this is supposed to be a film about CORAL REEFS, however, you'd expect that alot of it would take place UNDERWATER.....  It doesn't.  .... Too much coverage of ""human drama"", with an islander's disappointment in the dying reef near his island, one of the diver's brush with the bends (but you know it will all be wrapped-up in a happy ending, right?), and photographers flying and boating around tropical islands.  Personally, I had been looking for more photography and more real information on coral reefs --fascinating beautiful creatures with plenty of interesting drama on their own.

Soundtrack features great music, but the editing of which makes viewing the film quite annoying.  You're listening carefully to Liam's relaxing voice and all-too-brief interesting commentary on the subject matter and then BOOM!, your hit with CSN at a volume that has you scrambling for the remote to turn it down three notches.

Overall, its a film that wants to be everything for all interests.  Sure ! ...In 45 minutes?",1138579200,58,1165,4.963917525773196
1959058,2,B0000YED1S,"I bought this DVD based on buyers that had bought Baraka thinking they might be similar. There isn't even a comparison! Coral Reef doesn't hold a candle to Baraka. Coral Reef is more like watching a little show on the Discovery Channel or OPB. The underwater shots are great, but nothing epic and the narration is cheesey. The music has no flow to it, jumps around too much and is even a little obnoxious. There are some goof ball sound effects added in the documentary as well. I'm just surprised that people would reccomend this movie in relation to Baraka. They just aren't in the same category, not to mention Baraka is full feature length, and Coral Reef is just 40+ minutes. I give Coral Reef 3 stars because it's good as a documentary and 'Discovery' type show... But it's nothing epic and out of the ordinary.",1137024000,2,817,4.5646258503401365

1959065,5,B0000YED1S,"All I can say is WOW! What an incredible film. MacGillivray films has mastered the art of using the IMAX camera to capture amazing footage and now has mastered the ability to use the WMVHD format to bring their films new lives on HI-DEF screens in your home. The clarity and color are simply top notch not to mention the teriffic music. The colorful reef footage is exquisite and the footage of the dead reef saddened me beyond words. If you are a fan of brilliant underwater photography, this DVD is definitely for you.

And now, my soapbox moment:

There are a few people who have written negative reviews here, but they are disappointed Mac users whose operating system provider hasn't brought a portable Hi-Def format to market. (Get over it or buy a PC.) If you have a suitable Windows XP-based computer connected to your Hi-Def TV, you won't find any better imagery to have playing at a party than the MacGillivray films. I own ""Coral Reef Adventure"" and ""The Living Sea"" and will definitely be ordering more of their titles soon.

I also use this film for demonstration when my friends ask me about the differences between Standard-Def TV and Hi-Def. Since this set comes with both formats, I am able to switch from my Windows XP machine to my Set top DVD player quickly for comparison.

WMVHD may only be an interim step in the evolution of portable Hi-Def for consumer use, but the software to play it is free, the DVD's aren't any more expensive and if you have an HDV Camcorder, you can even make your own WMVHD discs at home for free. All the software required comes with Windows Media Player 10. (The first WMVHD enabled set top DVD players are due out on the market this year too.)",1125619200,8,1695,4.547540983606558

No matter what you try on your mac or other non-windows based computer the dvd is locked for microsoft only. I do not know why this company decided that windows is the only operating system on the market but I guess they are not familiar with HD rendering. So if your happy with a mediocre picture and have a windows computer hooked up to your TV this is the dvd for you.",1118793600,11,969,4.046875
1959068,4,B0000YED1S,"I didn't know what to expect from this film that I saw at an IMAX Theater but I knew I had to see it. I'm a scuba diving enthusiast and I love coral reefs. Coral Reef Adventure is an eco tour of reefs and the dangers that exist for this delicate ecosystem.  We follow Howard and Michele Hall, underwater photographers and authors, in their study of coral reefs to help Rusi Vulakoro, a diver in Fiji, to discover the cause of a dying reef.

Much of the underwater footage is from the Great Barrier Reef, Fiji, and French Polynesia. To say the images are breath taking is an understatement. Watching this film just re-enforced why I love to dive. I love the sea and all its wonder. At the end of the film a small child sitting in front of me told his parents that's what he wanted to do when he grows up, that is dive for a living. I love that so I told his parents about my dive club that teaches diving and has a program for children to play in to pool with dive equipment. There is nothing like seeing a wee one learning to dive.

As for the diving, it was exciting. The divers in this film are experienced professional divers and therefore they dive to depths all recreational divers should stay clear of. In the film you'll see depths of 350 and get a real feel for the wonder of scuba diving. Also, there was a guest appearance by Jean-Michele Cousteau; son of famed Jacque Cousteau, father of scuba diving. I also took a good look of the equipment that was used and was amazed at the use of re-breathers. I want a re-breather now.

Anyway, you'll see lots of coral, fish, manta rays, gray sharks, drift diving, incredible depths, and beautiful scenery. The film was incredibly educational and made me think of all the adventure I am missing. This is another film to spark your wonder lust for adventure and instill a respect for nature.

1959069,5,B0000YED1S,"This DVD, especially the HD content, is truly breathtaking for two primary reasons - the imagery is unbeliveable and stunning and the information provide about the death of the reefs knocks the wind out of you.

It is this double edge approach that makes this a bittersweet movie to view but it is well worth it.  Liam Neeson's narration is smooth and elegant.  This IMAX rates amoung the best with its great camera work and handling the subject matter with a compassionate, scientific approach.",1116633600,2,495,4.869047619047619
1959070,5,B0000YED1S,"This one is one of the rarest Imax movies in which information is equally well combined with the videography. The basic advantage and thus the drawback with the Imax People is that they are too good at videography thus being less informative in so many of their movies. Their primary focus is always on visuals and not on informations and facts. But this one is exceptionally well done with the very best knowledge available about the Coral Reefs as to how they form, where in the world are best coral reefs located and what are the causes of their decay and somehow how can they be saved.

I got the ActiveX error for the first time when I inserted the 2nd disc. I figured that out from the technical website and managed to play the 720p version.

The display was calibrated using Sound and Vision Home Theatre Tune Up and confirmed by Nokia Monitor Test. Colour is crisp and rich of details. Given my projector limited contrast ratio (400:1), this DVD really pushes it to the limit. The sound quality does not disappoint too. I must say it's comparable to DD and dts. I have seen some differences using RGB 15 pin and DVI digital. The DVI digital produces cleaner image with less pixelation and it looks as if the contrast is enhanced.

This is a drop-dead gorgeous movie to watch. And unlike the other existant HD-DVD, it is easy to use.
I look foward to purchasing other nature films released in this format. My only regret about this beautiful, intelligent movie is that it is an advocacy film for environmental preservation of coral reefs but it does not give its intended audience a clear push out-of-the-door to act in a meaningful way to save the oceans through legislation etc. Maybe I am being policy-wonkish here, but feel-good propaganda that does not motivate people is dishonest to its intents.
Liam Nieson narrates excellently, the underwater cinematography is pristine and the audience develops an appreciation of the coral reef milleau. music is goofy but fun.

It is also a feast for the eyes as well.  The filming/ photography is magnificient.  The ocean is the next wild frontier, and we need to learn more about it and appreciate it, before it is completely ruined.  The film focused on a couple whose love of marine life takes them on a journey from Fiji to the Coral Reefs of Australia.  It was informative, interesting, and overall a very beautiful.  I would suggest seeing at the IMAX theatre, if possible.
Also, the soundtrack makes this film move right along with songs from Crosby, Stills, and Nash.  The songs fit the footage perfectly ( which you may be surprised about !)

1959079,5,B0000YED1S,"If you own a high end HTPC (home theater personal computer), and a HD capable display, you owe it to yourself to buy this movie. Simply put, the Microsoft WMV transfer in high definition (both 720p and 1080p) is the best image I have ever seen on our home theater's very expensive projection system($30k JVC Lcos system).
There are some downsides....
1) Requires a very beefy computer. 3.0 Ghz is recommended by Microsoft, although some are getting away with lower powered machines by using the lower-quality 720p verion
2) Proprietary audio codec requires you to have the computer decode the audio, and send it to your amplifier via analog cables. There is no DTS or DD track on the HD version.
3) DRM - You have a choice of one video player, Windows Media 9. The movie has digial rights management on it, which can only be viewed by a Microsoft player. While this implementation is much better than the T2 high definition release (which required you to have an internet connection to get authorization), it's still a bit limiting.
Despite the problems, This is right up there with the best film based HDTV content I have viewed from HDnet or HD HBO.
