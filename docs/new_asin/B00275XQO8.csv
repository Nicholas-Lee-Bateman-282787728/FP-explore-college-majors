The author's own adaptation brings color, a bigger budget, better period detail and a more cartoonish feel to the proceedings, but nothing carries any real weight. The violence is pitched firmly on the comic book and playground level, not helped by his poor staging in the first half of the film, though matters do improve for an impressive shootout in a bar. Belmondo lends his body to the part, standing where he's needed and saying what's in the script, but not his presence: it's a curiously unengaged performance, as if genially doing a favor for a friend because it's not as if he has anything better to do that week, but aware that he has scenes but no character to play.

Restored to the novel's period setting, the film is at its most interesting in a lengthy section on French prison life during the war, where one escape attempt is thwarted when the outside man who is inadvertently smuggling gun parts into prison is arrested by the Nazis and where the same guards start the war guarding resistance members and end it guarding collaborators. The mine clearing scenes on the beach work fairly well despite Giovanni's inability to build any suspense, but ultimately they leave little lasting impression because, like so much in the film, they seem little more than colourful episodes to hide the lack of involvement with the bland characters: Constantin's dim thug leaves you unmoved, Claudia Cardinale has little to do as his sister and the object of Belmondo's affection beyond one sweet scene where she finds her first grey hair and sends it to JP in prison, a young Gerard Depardieu turns up briefly at the end, but only Philippe Brizzard's amiable and increasingly philosophical gay hanger-on makes much of an imprint in a minor supporting role. Unfortunately, the Hungarian DVD only features a dubbed English soundtrack, as does Madman's Australian PAL release, which is a better bet since it's part of a collection&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jean-Paul-Belmondo-Vol-2-French-Screen-Icons-3-DVD-Set-The-Inheritor-Scoumoune-Mafia-Warfare-The-Body-of-my-Enemy-L-h-eacute-ritier-La-scoumoune-Le-corps-de-mon-enne-NON-USA-FORMAT-PAL-Reg-4-Import-Australia/dp/B002ZV6PHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jean-Paul Belmondo - Vol. 2 (French Screen Icons) - 3-DVD Set ( The Inheritor / Scoumoune: Mafia Warfare / The Body of my Enemy ) ( L'h&eacute;ritier / La scoumoune / Le corps de mon enne [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 4 Import - Australia </a>], although none of the three films included is Belmondo at his best.",1351555200,,3037,5.517167381974249
