4461841,5,B004S6E26K,What's going on with the release of this blu-ray? Was suppose to come out a month ago. This is not a review.,1342656000,2,108,3.9545454545454546
4461842,5,B004S6E26K,"As Christian Bale's introduction film (his first) you will not find another character in the film that does a better job. John Malkovich comes in second in his believable job coming and going in a young British boy, Jim Graham's life. The film takes place in China when the Japanese invade and changes the lives of many, especially young Jim Graham. He will eventually be put into an internment camp and survive in his own way. The most moving scene in the film is when he discovers the American aircraft flying over the camp and Christian Bale does a SUPER job that should have at least given him an Academy nomination performance. He didn't get it but after 20+ years Christian will receive an Academy Award. Empire does get the nomination but not the award. Christian receives the National Board Of Review USA award as the Outstanding Juvenile Performance and Young Artist Awards as Best Young Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama. You will not be disappointed if you see it and I am sure you will want to take action and keep it in your collection of World War II films.",1338336000,4,1071,4.55440414507772

4461863,5,B004S6E26K,"A poetic and spirited coming of age tale set against WWII, Empire of the Sun is an exceptional film. Its scope, narrative and elegant John Williams score (his best IMO) place this in more sophisticated company than Spielberg's usual childhood fantasies. Some viewers have remarked about its implausibilities and war as fantasy conceit, but this is a facile read on the material. It's not a sober Prisoner of War tale but about loss of innocence. A boy evolves from class privilege and entitlement into a man before our eyes (and before his time). Unfolding like a great novel in it's storytelling, and framed like a David Lean epic, Empire of the Sun is ripe for rediscovery. A lost classic.",1440460800,3,691,4.815126050420168

4461866,5,B004S6E26K,"Nine Things About the Film ""Empire of the Sun""

1. This is perhaps the best representation of the loss of innocence ever put on screen.

2. It's the story of a British boy named Jim (played by 13-year-old Christian Bale in his very first movie) caught between China and Japan during WWII, and how he goes from being privileged and sheltered to being... somebody else.

3. The movie is epic both externally and internally - huge scenes of wartime China juxtapose with huge shifts in Jim's psyche and emotional development.

4. In some ways, this movie can be seen as a modern, wartime interpretation of the story of Buddha.

5. The screenplay was written by the legendary Tom Stoppard, and the movie was directed by the legendary Steven Spielberg. I feel sorry for people that see Spielberg's name and think it's going to be like ""Jurassic Park"" or ""E.T."". This is not a regular Spielberg movie. The partnership between Stoppard and Spielberg results in a film that is densely packed with ideas, allusions, metaphors, and symbols. You can peel it almost endlessly, and find something else to ponder.

6. To really appreciate the context of the film, you have to know some basic history of World War II and Japanese culture.

7. At certain scenes of the film the dialogue drops to a minimum, or even disappears entirely. These scenes are not breaks from the story. They are the real story. The most important ideas in the film are impossible to explain verbally, but must be communicated visually (and musically). They have to move past your talky-brain and deeper into who you are. The ""Cadillac of the Sky/bones in the runway"" scene is one of my most favorite scenes in all of cinema.

7.5 The final minutes of the film are subtle, but devastating.

8. The movie is about childhood, death, overthinking things, pragmatism, and the realization that you are not special. The world owes you nothing. You deal with that, or you die.

9. It's impossible to fully explain in words the multi-layered masterpiece of this movie. It's a visually astonishing, existentially profound examination of the beauty and terror of being alive. From a kid's perspective.",1439164800,15,2150,4.833787465940055

4461868,5,B004S6E26K,"Spielberg doesn't get enough credit for this masterpiece, I believe. I think it's because it was a product of his ""Oscar bait"" phase that it got overlooked. It's a stunning achievement both in terms of production and filmmaking technique.",1429747200,,238,5.128205128205129

4461874,5,B004S6E26K,Phenomenal movie. Christian Bale as a tiny lad...hard to image he's been around the screen for so long. His performance is outstanding in this story of war ravaged China. Steven Spielberg does a remarkable job in directing this movie with a very talented cast of characters. You can't ignore Christian Bale's love for aviation & the thought of becoming a pilot before & during the Japanese occupation. The cinematography is exquisite & the story mesmerizing.

4461883,5,B004S6E26K,"One of Steven Spielberg's best movies that wasn't that successful when introduced in theaters. Now, thanks to DVD and Blu-ray, it's finally achieving the recognition it deserves. Much has been written before me about the film's greatness. so I'll defer to previous positive reviews. Most of these reviews are written far better than I would.

The one thing I will add was how impressed my wife and I were with the young Christian Bale! He's in almost every scene, and is absolutely brilliant. A natural actor at such a young age. I remember saying to my wife that this young man was going to be a superstar one day, if he decided to continue acting. He is because he did!

I recently loaned my DVD to a member of my extended family, who never returned it. I guessed he liked it? So I took the opportunity to upgrade to Blu-ray. A win for him and a win for me!",1404864000,3,859,4.39622641509434
4461884,5,B004S6E26K,"An often overlooked Steven Spielberg opus, this wonderfully enthralling account of J.G.

Not to be missed.",1396310400,,285,5.4772727272727275
4461885,5,B004S6E26K,"Years ago, I saw the movie and loved it. Years later, I own the movie in Blu-ray now and appreciate it more! It is long, about 2 hours and 30 minutes. However, I am captivated the whole time, and there is no idling or slow moment.

This is arguably one of the BEST Spielbergs movies. The young Christian Bale acting is of Oscar-worthy. Most of all, the story is very compelling, from a small childs view of the great WWII in China, involving four countries (China, Japan, England, and America). It may not be politically correct, but is politically true. From a pampered spoiled brat to a street smart survivor, little Jim reflects on how different people adapt to new challenges. Yet, he acted as morally possible as he could during the wartime a noble soul, as we all possess within (how we act out... is a different story).

This is not only an epic movie, but also a deep discussion on human nature, morality, life and death, and the relation with The Higher Power (God in this movie).It is interesting that Jim cited in Latin during his tried times (he learned when he attended a Catholic school).

I am moved and touched by the story, and felt the triumphs and despairs wholeheartedly as Jim went on his life adventures. Spielberg paid great attention to details, in lines and in scenes. These details have great meanings. Therefore, I urge viewers to pay attention to them.

By the way, the Blu-ray version brings wonderful colors, high definition, and fantastic sound to the movie A successful transfer from the 1987 original.

It is a totally enjoyable movie, whether you enter it from the shallower or deeper end. Highly recommend it!",1394928000,,1644,4.694444444444445
4461886,5,B004S6E26K,I reviewer the book above. Christian Bale is an amazing actor and should be appreciated more than he is. I loved all of the Batman movies and I liked American Hustle. I would love for him to win the Oscar but I bet it will go to 12 Years a slave. He sure didn't look like himself in that movie but he was amazing. How many actors can change their appearance so much for a movie. In Empire of the Sun he was only 14 and already amazing. Would recommend this highly.,1392768000,,464,4.054347826086956

He is truly a gifted actor, the absolute best of his generation. He is generally very particular about what projects he's involved in. Just a wonderful actor.... And the movie, just a masterpiece of filmmaking... The cinematography, acting etc. Spielberg really proved himself with this film and this wasn't well received????? It just proves how common and stupid the american public is...My very favorite scene was the reunion with his parents. He saw his mother and so gently removed her hat to touch her hair, then her mouth. Then she embraced him and the last scene was his eyes, slowly closing.... The relief that was expressed in his eyes was so simple a gesture but so powerful... Unbelievable....",1380412800,3,827,4.830985915492958
4461898,5,B004S6E26K,"I never cease to wonder at Spielberg's ability to move between different genres and deliver a result that others could only do if it were their specialty.  The seal of approval that author J. G. Ballard gives to this production speaks volumes for the treatment given to this incredible story.  The choice of Christian Bale to portray Jim Graham was a masterstroke of casting.

When the movie begins, it is very easy to develop a near instant dislike of young Jim - a spoilt little English rich kid living in an enclosed world of upper class British privilege. But when the Japanese invade Shanghai, he suddenly finds himself alone and having to fend for himself. All too suddenly, separated from his parents, we see his character evolve into one who understands that to survive he must do whatever it takes with his own judgement as his guide and what he learns from two American seamen, Basie and Frank (John Malkovich and Joe Pantoliano).

Inevitably, Jim and his new found companions are interned and it is in Soochow Creek Prison Camp he really learns to survive, finds courage in pursuit of doing what is right and earns genuine respect from his captors.

Jim is a complex child but under the guiding hand of Steven Spielberg, Christian Bale delivers all of the traits and emotions that make up this character in a powerful performance - a performance you would not expect from one so young and making his debut movie.

The supporting cast is equally well chosen and combine to make Empire of the Sun what it is - a 5 star movie of astonishing brilliance.  To not see it is to deprive yourself of a real piece of cinematic excellence.",1380326400,4,1639,4.650519031141869

4461907,3,B004S6E26K,"This is a very strange movie. It is obviously high budget, given the size of the pre-CGI sets, the number of extras, and the use of real military craft.

But it is such a strange movie. Christian Bale does a fine job of acting in this film (it's uncanny seeing features in young Christian that I recognize in the adult Christian Bale), but still, he's a 12 year old kid who is prone to doing 12 year old kid stuff. He lives in a Japanese concentration camp during the war. You see lots of suffering and cruelty with no vengeance or payback. People endure beatings and don't fight back, don't try to get revenge. It's just suffering and then more suffering, starvation, death, and arbitrary violence.

Spielberg brings some clever camera angles to the table, and given the source material it is well-made, well scripted, and well-acted, but I really don't see how this was a good idea as a movie. It's just that the central structure of the story simply doesn't lend itself to commercial success or popular appeal.

4461914,5,B004S6E26K,"I won't spend much time on the film itself.  Suffice to say the film is amazing, it was nominated for several Academy Awards, but took home zero - but it had to compete with 'The Last Emperor'.  Tough year.  Spielberg considers this film one of his most profound.  It takes place in and around Shanghai from 1941 to 1945.  It centers around Jim, a spoiled youth (played by a young and talented Christian Bale) who is separated from his parents during the Japanese invasion and forced to live in a prison camp.

The Blu-Ray is stunning to say the least.  There are a few shots where the film really stands out, mainly the scenes involving planes flying over.  There are also some stunning shots in and around the prison camp and airstrip.  The sound is also well updated and will give your sound system a workout.

The included booklet is a nice addition but not really as interesting as the booklets included in similar releases (such as Amadeus).  The additional disc is a documentary about Warner Brothers during WW2.  Interesting, but self appreciative to say the least.  It's Warner tooting their horn about their contribution to the war effort.  If you like documentaries you will probably find it average.  If you want more back story on World War 2, then go for 'The War' by Ken Burns.

So yes.  Great film. Beautiful Blu-Ray.  But worth it?  Currently the Blu-Ray is going for $26 and change.  It's not really worth it at that price for everyone.  Those who love the film may want to pick it up.  But I suspect the price will drop, as usual with the major studio Blu-Ray re-releases.  I've picked some of these up for $10 and under after they've been out a year or so.  So if you are patient, then you might want to wait for a price drop (always the risk of the film going out of print though...).  It makes it tough when I've picked up the collectors edition Blu-Ray boxed sets (with tons of swag) for Casablanca ($29) and Sound of Music ($24) at around the same price.

I recommend renting or checking it out from your local library if you're not sure about purchasing.  (I checked mine out from my local library on Blu-Ray - thank you Washington County!)",1358294400,3,2165,4.512886597938144
4461915,5,B004S6E26K,"With ""Lincoln"" currently in theaters, it's no surprise that several of director Steven Spielberg's past works are being released on Blu-Ray for the first time. Though a commercial disappointment and the recipient of numerous mixed reviews at the time of its original release, Spielberg's ""Empire of the Sun"" remains - for me - one of the filmmaker's finest achievements. A towering adaptation of J.G. Ballard's autobiographical novel of a young British boy (Christian Bale) separated from his parents during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai in WWII, Spielberg's film - scripted by Tom Stoppard - follows ""Jamie/Jim""'s subsequent internment in a POW camp and efforts to survive alongside contrasting parental figures ranging from a British doctor (Nigel Havers) to an American sailor (John Malkovich).

""Empire of the Sun"" has dozens of indelible cinematic moments and remains incredibly compelling for all its two-and-a-half hour running time. Though many have argued through the years that Spielberg only ""grew up"" when he made ""Schindler's List,"" ""Empire of the Sun"" proves otherwise thanks to its evolving story - one that bridges the gap between a child's initial view of war with the character's coming-of-age and growing adult instincts of survival and responsibility. Stoppard's smart, well developed screenplay is brought to life thanks to impressive work from frequent Spielberg associates like cinematographer Allen Daviau (whose efforts here rank with his finest) and especially John Williams, whose glorious music enhances the picture without overscoring its emotions. Unlike Spielberg's more contemporary films - which have often employed ""movie stars"" like Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise - ""Empire of the Sun"" utilizes an ensemble-driven approach for its casting instead, with Bale a revelation in his first feature performance, and Malkovich memorably essaying the cynical ""Basie."" It's a brilliant film - entertaining, enthralling and emotional - and one that continues to age gracefully as one of its director's best.

Warner has brought ""Empire of the Sun"" to Blu-Ray in a wonderfully crisp 1080p AVC encoded transfer with DTS MA audio. Extra features include the vintage ""China Odyssey"" 50-minute documentary, narrated by Martin Sheen, as well as a second DVD offering an hour-long, Spielberg-narrated examination of Warner Bros.' war pictures. The two discs are housed in one of Warner's Digibook packages offering glossy photos and behind the scenes information. Highly recommended!",1356825600,5,2500,5.576315789473684

4461917,5,B004S6E26K,"I was among those who were enchanted by Empire of the Sun upon its release in the mid-80's and could never understand why it was treated so shabbily during the award season. It is possibly Steven Spielberg's finest film - managing to capture a sense of the terror, brutality and despair endured by both the Chinese civilian population and the European internees in China during WWII and the magical-horrific journey of survival of a young British boy amidst it all. Those who have read JG Ballard's semi-autobiographical novel will know that we are presented with a somewhat sanitized version of this story and the scale of the horrors inflicted by the combined effects of the war, the Japanese and the associated famine in China are only really hinted at. Spielberg was perhaps simply not ready to push the limits with EOTS only appearing some 5 years after ET and nearly ten years prior to Schindlers list with Saving Private Ryan, Munich etc still to follow.

The provides a snapshot of pre-war Shanghai in the period just prior to Pearl Harbor and then exploresAbove all though the film is about Jim Graham and his physical and emotional journey from being a precocious, over-indulged son of a China-based wool merchant to becoming a hardened, street-savvy, if still precocious, orphan of the war. Christian Bale's rendering of Jim is simply a revelation, beautifully capturing both the terror of loss and abandonment alongside the wide-eyed wonder of a young boy who finds himself amongst and fascinated by the machinery of war. Such horrors as are presented in EOTS are deftly balanced by some wonderful touches of humor mostly derived from Jim's grappling with the adult world and the contradictions/paradoxes of war.

This blu-ray release is simply stunning and does a magnificent justice to some of the most incredible cinematic images that Spielberg has captured on film. The near dream-like images of Jim's sheltered world amidst the chaos of Shanghai are wonderful to behold but are easily eclipsed by the aerial scenes involving the internment camp and the nearby Japanese airfield later in the film. For a mid-80's film the blu-ray picture and sound quality of EOTS makes this purchase/upgrade worth every penny. Enjoy.",1355961600,9,2233,5.048780487804878

4461922,5,B004S6E26K,"`People will do anything for a potato'

When I think about the films of Steven Spielberg, ""Empire of the Sun"" ranks among my all-time favorites by this director.

There's so much to take in here, from the story and acting to the sets and cinematography that ""Empire of the Sun"" is also one of my all-time favorite films, period.

Set during World War II, the story centers around Jamie, a boy from a well-to-do British family living in Shanghai.  When the movie begins, we witness events in Jamie's idyllic life - he's spoiled and takes advantage of those charged with his care. After hostilities escalate between Japan and China, Jamie becomes separated from his family, and the remainder of the movie deals with the boy's ability to survive on his own in a drastically different environment.

You may never quite warm up to Jamie (played perfectly by an adolescent Christian Bale), but you have to admire his ability to adapt. Like him or not, the final scene in ""Empire of the Sun"" should bring a tear to your eye.

If you are a fan of this movie, you will be blown away by the quality of the Blu Ray transfer!  An incredible amount of fine detail that was missing from the original DVD is revealed in this transfer -I was struck by a scene early in the film where Jamie comes upon a downed fighter plane - you see all the wear and tear the aircraft went through. Color(check out the ""costume party"" scene) and contrast and sound are excellent. A must-have!",1353456000,7,1460,4.549618320610687
4461923,5,B004S6E26K,"It's ironic that both ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Empire of the Sun"" were finally released on Blu Ray the same day last week(Nov. 13). Ironic for two reasons, the first being that they are ""epic"" films of the kind that is very rarely made today. And second because David Lean, the director of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" was originally scheduled to direct ""Empire of the Sun"" with Spielberg producing. Lean spent a year on the pre-production shortly after his return to filmmaking with ""A Passage to India"" (1984) after a fourteen year absence before finally turning the whole thing over to Spielberg. That was a wise decision because ""Empire of the Sun"" would have looked completely different had Lean actually made the picture himself. I've always liked ""Empire of the Sun"" since I first saw it at the old Cinema 21 theatre in San Diego upon it's release in December, 1987. I've owned every home video version of it from VHS and regular DVD and also purchased both the vinyl and CD of John Williams superb music score as well. Now with this brilliant new Blu Ray version thru Warner Home Video, my collection is complete. ""Empire of the Sun"" on Blu Ray is stunning to say the least. Every detail, no matter how small, is crystal clear. There is some minor grain in one scene filmed inside a rusting tanker that serves as a hideout for John Malkovich's character, but it doesn't last that long and doesn't detract from Allen Daviau's brilliant photography. Colors, period costumes, Japanese warplanes and everything else just pop off the screen. This is the best that ""Empire"" has looked since it was first released twenty-five years ago. Christian Bale is perfect as the young Jim Graham who comes of age after being separated from his mother in the crowded panic driven streets of Shanghai during the Japanese invasion of that city in 1941. Warning to all children: Do not let go of your mother's hand if you're ever in a situation like this. It's that separation, along with alienation and the loss of innocence that make ""Empire"" one of Spielberg's greatest films. It was his second ""serious"" film following ""The Color Purple"" in 1985 after making such entertaining and crowd pleasing films such as ""Jaws"", ""ET"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", etc. He would go on to bigger heights and acclaim with ""Schindler's List""(1993),""Saving Private Ryan""(1998) and the just released ""Lincoln"". His work on ""Empire"" certainly paved the way for those later films. Fans of Christain Bale won't be surprised to see how good he was as a young child actor in his first starring role if they only know him from the ""Batman"" films. As he proved in his Oscar winning role in ""The Fighter"" he was born to act. Spoiler alert: The final scene when Bale's character Jim is finally reunited with his mother and father is one of the most touching and heartrending scenes ever put on film. It was done with little dialogue and was the perfect ending to such an outstanding film. ""Empire of the Sun"" was praised by most of the critics at the time, but did not do well at the box office. It was nominated for six Oscars but was overshadowed that year by another film about China, Bernardo Bertolucci's ""The Last Emperor"" which won the Oscar as Best Picture. But that's okay because both films can stand on their own as filmmaking at it's best. This new Blu Ray Edition is a digibook release much like the other Warner digibook titles of the past few years. There is a second disc called ""Warner at War"" which is narrated by Steven Spielberg and covers the efforts of Warner Bros. studios during World War Two. There are many clips from Warner films of this era such as ""Sgt. York"" and ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" among others. ""Empire of the Sun"" may not be as popular as some of Spielberg's other films, but it certainly deserves another look on Blu-ray and comes highly recommended.",1353283200,11,3843,4.70326409495549
