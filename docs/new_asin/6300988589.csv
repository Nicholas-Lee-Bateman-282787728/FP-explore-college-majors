7809069,4,6300988589,The beginning of the Third Season was really good. This episode is no exception. The battle scene was one of the series finest. You then have Kirk and Elaan ending their fling in order to do their duties and responsibilities. This is a nice little episode.,1242345600,,256,4.586956521739131
7809070,5,6300988589,"This episode is extraordinarily rich in literary references. First and foremost, it's an obvious re-telling of the Tristan & Isolde myth, about a knight who was sent to fetch his king's bride but fell in love with her. (TNG did a take on that as well, but in a much slower-paced episode.) Second, the title alludes to Helen of Troy. Also, there are scenes that play like Pygmalion or My Fair Lady, but pitched at greater intensity. Comparisons to Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew"" would also not be out of place.

The Enterprise is sent on a diplomatic mission to take a princess named the Dohlman to the planet Troyius, where a marriage has been arranged to create peace between two planets. The Dohlman is selfish, crude, and savage. When she knifes the Troyan ambassador, Kirk takes on the job of teaching her manners and persists even after he is almost knifed himself. The plot thickens when he accidently touches her tears, which act as an irresistable love potion.

This episode sums up much of what Star Trek is about. Kirk, as ever, is the spokesman for liberal democratic values. Meanwhile, the Dohlman represents an ancient mentality which Earth has mostly grown out of... an attitude of privilege, arrogance, and war. The Dohlman is Cleopatra, Helen of Troy, and the Queen of Sheba. It is fascinating to see how Kirk, the icon of liberal values, interacts with such an atavistic mentality. Basically, he is the adult and she the child.

Even after being ensnared by the love potion, he's under no illusions. ""What sort of mind can think up such a thing?"" he asks when she suggests that he destroy the planet in order to have her to himself. It's this reaction, as much as his love for the Enterprise, that enables him to break the spell.

The episode ends with an exciting space battle against the Klingons, who want to sabotage the Enterprise's mission. Once again we see Kirk outplaying and outthinking his opponent. First, he tries bluffing them; when that doesn't work, he fixes the Enterprise engines (through a lucky break) and then sandbags the Klingons, waiting for them to approach and then firing off a full battery of weapons. If there's any episode that makes you hate Klingons and cheer for their defeat, it's this one.

Although this episode is primarily written as a tempestuous love story, its best feature may be that the space battle is one of the most exciting in the entire original series -- or any version of Star Trek. The final scene... with its insightful comments by both McCoy and Spock that Kirk's first love is the Enterprise (""For once, Doctor, I must agree with you"") ties everything together, including the battle, and leaves the episode on a marvelously bittersweet but satisfying note.",1182211200,2,2733,4.794055201698514
7809071,4,6300988589,"Episodes like this one, along with ""Who Mourns for Adonis?"" ""Mudd's Women"", and ""Mirror, Mirror"", are probably the reason the original Trek is, by far, the sexiest of the various incarnations. Perhaps, it fortunate that the series initial run was during the ""sexual revolution"" of the 60's, allowing female characters to be suggestively attired to the obvious delight of males everywhere.
While the story line isn't one of the series best, ""Star Trek 57: Elaan of Troyius"" does feature an eye-popping turn from guest France Nuyen in the title role. Nuyen is one of the most exotically beautiful actresses to even grace both the big and small screen. And she is more than just a pretty face; she is an excellent performer that has, sadly, not had extensive work.
Her appearance in this episode is one of the many trailblazers from the landmark show.",1067644800,,848,4.895833333333333
