7998214,5,B0000C0FLQ,"The first episodes I had of ""OZZIE & HARRIET"" were ""THE BUSY CHRISTMAS"" & ""LATE CHRISTMAS GIFT"". They were on a  Collection called ""THE CHRISTMAS TV EPISODES"", which also contained two ""JACK BENNY"" episodes and an episode from ""THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES"".  I bought the collection in 2003. I had heard people talk about ""OZZIE & HARRIET"" but I had never seen not one episode. I hadn't even heard of ""RICKY NELSON"" until a collection of his songs were advertised on television that had to be ordered. This collection was in the ""THROW AWAY BIN"" at a local WAL*MART near where I once worked. The ""THROW AWAY BIN"" was what I called the big bin where all kinds of Movies, TV SHOWS, and Series were placed in that didn't seem to sell to well. Or the store didn't have a better place to put them. Or they just weren't popular among what the shoppers were shopping for. The two discs were sold separately, volume 1 and volume 2. There wasn't an outer sleeve. I've long forgotten how much they cost but they weren't much. Of course I didn't buy them and eventually they disappeared. I was disappointed about that. Then I came across a three episode disc, containing the first three episodes listed on disc one in this collection: ""KRIS & THE QUEEN"", ""A WIFE IN THE OFFICE"", AND ""DAVID GOES BACK TO WORK"". I paid a whopping dollar, plus tax. On the first episode was Wally Plumstead, Played by ""SKIP YOUNG"" & Ginger Salare, Played by ""CHARLENE SALERNO"". I didn't know then that they would become my ""Favorite Couple"" on the show. Anyway, it took me years to buy anymore collections. Then last year when I was shopping for CHRISTMAS I came across a collection of ""OZZIE & HARRIET CHRISTMAS EPISODES"", which I purchased. Plus there were two others that I purchased besides this one. I was so happy. I was finally on my way to collecting more OZZIE & HARRIET EPISODES.

Unfortunately the episodes in this collection has not been remastered. But I don't think they are to bad for the price that I paid for them. And with the collections all having episodes that are on other collections, I figure if I get an episode that I don't have for each dollar that I have invested, then I have gotten my money's worth. Of course this would be a very expensive venture, since this show have Four Hundred and Thirty-five Episodes total. Of course some of the collections are a lot better than some of the others.

The quality of the pictures on some of the episodes are not so great. Like in this collection, the episode ""THE MAID OF HONOR"" is more grainy than it is in the collection ""THE ADVENTURES OF OZZIE & HARRIET: BEST OF RICKY AND DAVE"". And some of the Titles are wrong. ""The Maid Of Honor"" is supposed to be ""RICK, AND THE MAID OF HONOR"". And ""Horror Of Oz"" is supposed to be ""AN HONOR FOR OZ"". And another more subtle annoyance is the logo of the company that distributed this collection. On the lower right corner of the discs it is a constant reminder.

It is to bad that this show has not yet been placed on discs by seasons. Every collection I have, have some episodes from most of the seasons. But it would be so wonderful to sit down and watch this show from start to finish, in the order in which they aired. I think the closest we may get to that anytime soon is on Youtube. I think up to half or more of the episodes may be available to view that way, if one doesn't mind constantly looking to see if the next episode is available. For me a real treat would be if I can acquire all of the episodes that ""WALLY & GINGER"" appeared in. Wally was so funny with that contagious laugh of his. In this collection my favorite episode with him in it, is: ""ANY DATE IN A STORM"".

Wally and Rick run into David, who is having lunch at the Campus Malt Shop. Wally, as usual haven't any money. Rick finds out from David that he was there because he was doing some Legal Work for the owners of the new ""Campus Restaurant"". David gives them both a Business Card for the Restaurant and tells them that it is booked for Opening Night. In the meantime Wally is still worried because he haven't any money to take Ginger out and Rick has told him that he has a date for the weekend with his girl, Peggy, Played by ""PAMELA AUSTIN"". So Wally devises a plan to make it look as if he was taking out Ginger to the new Campus Restaurant, on Opening Night. All he has to do is ""make reservations"", which he doesn't because he haven't any money. He then hints around enough and Peggy then invites him and Ginger to join them on their weekend date. Then later Wally and Rick runs into an acquaintance of Rick's, named Joan Carlson, ""MIKKI JAMISON"" who then introduces them to her friend, Sally Taft, ""SHARYN HILLYER"". The comedy begins when Peggy and Ginger gets trapped by a Rainstorm, keeping Rick And Wally from their original planned weekend. Rick And Wally then go to the Library for a lack of something else to do, with Wally complaining about why can't they get other dates and go to the opening of the restaurant. They then run into Joan and Sally, at the Library too, and  Rick blurts out an invitation to them, inviting them to the Opening Night of The Campus Restaurant, which surprises Wally. David has fixed it so that they can go on Opening Night free of charge, courtesy of THE MANAGEMENT. Rick And Wally wind up in trouble when they find out from Peggy that the roads have cleared up. She thought he was calling to invite she and Ginger to Opening Night at THE CAMPUS RESTAURANT. So Rick And Wally wound up having to keep their dates with both sets of ladies. They took Joan and Sally out first. They rushed them through the Dinner and the Dancing, causing their dates to question their behavior. When they got ready to leave Rick And Wally got trapped in the Restaurant because Peggy and Ginger were coming in. Joan and Sally were wondering what happened to them, while Peggy and Ginger were looking around for them. Eventually Rick And Wally got Peggy and Ginger seated and Joan and Sally out of the Restaurant after some fancy maneuvering with the Maitre'd. They rushed them home, leaving them standing at the door wondering what just happened. Rick And Wally then rushes back to the Restaurant, pretending as if they were just getting there. After they had eaten, again, Rick informs Wally that they haven't the money to pay for the second dinner. They solved the issue by entering a ""Twist Dance Contest"". The winners and their entire party would be guests of The Management for the evening. So they had to dance their way out of the restaurant. GEE, I WONDER WHO WON?! LOL! Ten to one I would have bet on Wally and Ginger. This was such a funny episode. FOR MY MONEY, THIS ENTIRE COLLECTION WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY I SPENT.",1459814400,2,6708,4.444354183590577

7998218,4,B0000C0FLQ,"Transfers of PLATINUM DISC (aka ""Echo Bridge"") public domain TV shows is about average. No sign of restoration here, with none dubbed from pristine studio prints. Minor downside: this company superimposes a faint logo on-screen every so often.

When band leader Ozzie Nelson married girl singer Harriet Hilliard in 1936, the two had no idea that they and sons David and Eric ('Ricky') would become a national institution. ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" began in 1944 as a radio show. Two actors portrayed the Nelson children until David and Ricky took over in '49. The family act switched to TV in 1952. Their youngest became a teen idol in the late '50s. Ricky Nelson had several top selling records and often performed on the show. This gentle sitcom ran continuously until mid-1966, thus the Nelsons were part of the American scene for 22 consecutive years.
