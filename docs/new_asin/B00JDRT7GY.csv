6355319,5,B00JDRT7GY,"Set in 1997 we meet the Lim family - this is the start of the financial breakdown and Mr Lim has made some ill considered investments. He also works as a salesman for a company who seem to make useless tat in the glass department. His wife also works and they have a young son Jiale. Because of their work commitments they decide to get a Filipino maid - as was the fashion at the time. Enter Terry who has left her native home and young child to earn some money by being a virtual slave to her new masters.

First thing they do is take her passport away in case she runs off. She also has to sleep on a `put me up bed' in the same room as Jiale. It is not easy for her but she is one of lifes' strugglers and so she begins to work her way into the affections of the family - especially Jiale. This is essentially about their relationship, trust and love. The Asian title for this film was `Father, Mother - Not at Home' which is really what the film is about. The `Ilo Ilo' reference is alluding to the Ilonggo dialect of Iloilo province where Terry comes from. We hear her speak this when she calls home.

This won the Camera D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 2013 and deservedly so. It is a debut feature film from film director and writer Anthony Chen, so I hope we get to see a lot more from him. The acting is all excellent and the period detail is subtle but effective. Most of the dialogue is in English but because of the very strong regional accents it is all sub titled. An absolutely surprising and rewarding film that I find very easy to recommend.",1410652800,6,1563,4.1551155115511555

6355321,4,B00JDRT7GY,"A film from Singapore that looks deeply into family relationships may not be what we expect, but Anthony Chen's screenplay and direction bring this sensitive little story alive.

The time is 1997 (during the Asian Financial Crisis) in Singapore. Jaile Lim is a young boy whose strained home life affects his behavior patterns at school and at play. His parents are overworked and do not cope with Jiale's problems well, and with another baby on the way they hire live in maid and nanny Teresa, a Filipino girl searching for a better life. The friendship between the maid Teresa and young boy Jiale at first causes the mother's jealousy, while the Asian recession hits the region: the bond between Jaile and Teresa actually weakens the strained relationship within the family unit until Teresa manages to calm Jaile's temperament and the result is a an extended family, one that no longer is family and maid. What begins as a strange relationship between a young boy, lonely as his parents are busy making money to support their family, and a maid, who left her young boy to her sister in another country  to come to Singapore for earning, becomes a permutation of a true family.

The cinematography by Benoit Soler heightens the drama. The acting is high quality - Yann Yan Yeo as the mother, Tianwen Chen, the father, Angeli Bayani as Teresa and Jailer Koh as Jaile. The film is in Mandarin, Tagalog, and Hokkien with English subtitles. Grady Harp, September 14",1410048000,4,1462,4.816733067729084
6355322,5,B00JDRT7GY,"Ilo Ilo is set in Singapore during the financial crisis of 1997-98, but the themes and issues it so well depicts are universal.  The Lim family is part of the struggling middle class. Both Teck and his wife Hwee Leng must work to maintain their standard of living, and as a result neither has much time for their 10 year old son Jiale. Inevitably Jiale begins to seek his parents' attention through misbehaving at school and at home.  With Hwee Leng expecting another child and the pressures of daily life becoming overwhelming, the Lims hire a Filipina maid and nanny, Teresa or Terry.

Terry is a young woman with a baby of her own she has left with relatives back home.  She is an outsider in the family and in Singapore, but she eventually makes a place for herself, especially as a sort of big sister/mother substitute for Jiale.  Her life is hectic and uncomfortable, but in some ways she is still better off than the Lims themselves, who struggle with employment issues, money shortages, and countless other problems.

Ilo Ilo provides a gritty and realistic look at life in Singapore from the point of view of its overworked immigrant working class.  Much of the dialogue is Mandarin Chinese, but there are segments in Tagalog and in English as well.  English subtitles are provided.",1409616000,2,1291,4.732142857142857
6355323,5,B00JDRT7GY,"For me this is probably one of the loveliest movies of the year. It is set against the background of the Asia financial crisis of 97-98, but aside from a representation of the grim condition that the crisis put the Lim family into, the movie is full of humor, biter-sweetness and a deep understanding of family relationship, which is so universal that no one will not feel emphatic with the characters after watching this movie. At the beginning you may recognize several stereotypes of family drama: the tiger-mother, the frustrated father, the mischievous kid and the servile maid, but the story develops all of these are peeled off and more nuanced emotions are showed. High recommend!",1405468800,4,688,4.939655172413793
6355324,4,B00JDRT7GY,"""ILO ILO"" (2013 release from Singapore; 99 min.) brings the story of the Lims, a middle-class family in Singapore which has just hired a live-in domestic worker from the Philippines, ""Auntie Terry"" (but really no aunt). As the movie opens, we see a 10 yr. old boy Jiale getting in trouble at school, and his mom needs to come solve the situation. Turns out ater a while Jiale truly is a brat. When Terry arrives to start work for the Lim fmaily, Jiale is equally disrespectful to her, if not worse. Meanwhile his mom (expectant with another child) and dad (on the verge of losing his sales job) are struggling to keep everything in balance. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, I was never able to figure out what the movie's title (pronounced ""eelo eelo"") means but the DVD jacket notes clear that up (I won't spoil it here). Second, while it is never explicitly stated during the movie, comments from the director and also on the DVD sleeve notes make it clear that the movie is set during the Asian financial crisis in the late 90s. Singapore, an otherwise very stable and well to do country, was equally hit hard by that crisis, and the struggles of the Lim family embody that. Third, the treatment of Terry as the 'immigrant' domestic worker by both the Lims and by Singapore society in general is pretty tough to take, but I suppose it is a reflection of reality, albeit an ugly one. Fourth, the acting performances are nothing short of stellar. Check out the little boy who plays Jiale, about as unlikeable as you'll ever find a young boy. Last but certainly not least, kudos to writer-director Anthony Chen, bringing his debut feature movie. In the DVD sleeve notes, Chen comments that the movie was inspired by his childhood, making this a very personal and emotional movie for him.

This movie was the February, 2014 release in the on-going series of Film Movement's DVD-of-the-Month Club of foreign and indie movies, and it will be released to the public at large in June, 2014. As usual, the DVD comes with a number of bonus materials, such as a ""behind the scenes"" look at ILO ILO, including footage from the 2013 Cannes Film Festival where this premiered, and also a nice animated shortie (""Blik"", 2013 release from the Netherlands; 8 min.), equally worth checking out. ""ILO ILO"" is another worthy addition to the ever-growing Film Movement library. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1395964800,6,2499,4.703196347031963

6355326,5,B00JDRT7GY,"Set in Singapore, 1997  the year of Asian financial crisis  Ilo Ilo follows the touching story of the friendship between Teresa (Angeli Bayani), a housemaid from the Philippines who lives with a Singaporean family the Lims, and Jialer (Koh Jia Ler), a young boy of the Lim family, who is a troublemaking elementary schooler.

Written and directed by Singapore-born Anthony Chen (his first feature), Ilo Ilo is a moving and slightly poignant drama with realistic characters. There are no evil people and nothing big happens in this Singaporean film, in which small things matter. While the film focuses the relationship between Teresa (or Terry) and the boy Jialer, it also effectively describes the life of the two-income family struggling to keep their heads above water. (Part of the films story is inspired by the directors own childhood, and the films title Ilo Ilo refers to the city of the Philippines the real-life counterpart of Teresa came from.)

Ilo Ilo is also a social observation from the director, who compassionately describes the life of ordinary people, especially maids from abroad. There is a memorable scene in which a maid, hired by Teresas neighbor, asking Teresa to send her money to her family. Probably she has been locked up in the room by her employer.

The film keeps a good pace throughout, well-acted and tightly edited. It is a very impressive debut from the director Anthony Chen, who gives us an absorbing drama.",1426982400,,1446,4.983402489626556
6355327,4,B00JDRT7GY,"Ilo Ilo is about a middle class family whose world is rocked by the Asian financial crisis in 1997. A film about a family which is pushed to the brink by events outside their control. Teck ( Chen Tian Wen) loses his job as a salesman and his savings by trading stocks, but cannot admit to his wife Leng ( Yeo Yann Yann). The couple's 10 year old Jiale ( Koh Jia Ler) has a propensity for getting in to trouble and for winning lottery numbers. To get him in control they hire a maid Terry ( Angeli Bayani) from the Ilo Ilo province in the Philippines.
Terry has a lot of adjustment to do especially with the child who gives her hell until when he breaks his hand. As Terry begins to take care of him, she starts forming a bond with him making his mother jealous.
These four individuals are vulnerable and desperate to make money as the world around them starts falling apart.
The relationship between Jiale and Terry is haunting and stays with you as the simple tale unfolds.

When I watch a film like this I want to be moved, but this film insists on a kind of quiet artistry that never makes a claim. Certainly, life is hard, and this film explores that desperation, but I would have liked it to go bigger than it does. But, again, a pretty good film--acting is fantastic.",1412553600,,384,4.202702702702703
6355333,4,B00JDRT7GY,"This is one of the films ""curated"" and released by Film Movement that has won awards at film festivals such as , in the case of this film, one at Cannes in 2013.  I won't go into the plot very much because other reviewers here have done a fine job of that, though, honestly, I went into watching this film with no knowledge or expectations other than knowing the NY Times gave it a ""Critics Pick"".  It is not a fast moving film and takes it's time, but at under 100 minutes, it is certainly worth watching.

Though it takes place in modern day Singapore, one of the main characters is a ""maid"" brought in from the Philippines. (Apparently many Filipinos come to Shanghai to become maids and ""nannys"" for families with both working parents. ). So even though some of the dialog is in English (the Nanny can't speak Mandarin or Tagalog) there are always English subtitles (and they are easy to read too!).

So farno one has commented on nthe bonus features on the DVD so I'll point those out. I found both nice additions.  There is a 22-minute ""Making of"" featurette which intercuts comments (in Mandarin - with English subtitles) from Director Anthony Chen (who went to film school in the US) with scenes from the film and comments from all the major actors. Though you should not watch this until after seeing the film, it might help to know that much of the action in the film is autobiographical for Chen.
The title of the film translates to mean ""The Parents Aren't At Home"".
There are trailers as well but these don't add much.

The other nifty bonus is an animated 8-minute short film from the Netherlands about a young boy's first love- with the ""older woman next door"". It's cleverly done

This DVD is well worth your time. It was for me.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6355334,4,B00JDRT7GY,"All of Film Movement's releases have garnered film festival praise and accolades. Such is the case with Ilo Ilo, from director Anthony Chen. It was a winner at Cannes and a New York Times critic's pick.

 Ilo Ilo is set in 1997 Singapore. Teck and Hwee Leng are comfortably middle class with one son, Jiale, and another baby on the way. Jiale is constantly getting into altercations at school, embarrassing his parents - mostly his mother. Mom is working lots of hours and decides they need someone to help with the housework  - and Jiale. They hire Teresa - a Filipino.

 There is no great plot twist to Ilo Ilo, rather it is the documentation and exploration of a small group of people whose lives intersect for a window of time. Teresa is not accepted by Jiale in the beginning - he treats her quite cruelly and maliciously. Mom takes her passport for safekeeping'. Dad is quite distant - he is keeping his job loss a secret from his wife. I found the family's treatment of Teresa quite depressing, although I realize it is reality based. As the economy worsens, tensions grow higher in the family. Jiale and Teresa's relationship changes, much to the consternation of his harried mother.

 The standout actor for me was Teresa. She too has personal issues that we only learn of through the phone calls she places home. The 'secret' world of the 'domestic help' is where we see Teresa smile, instead of the robotic yes ma'am, no ma'am blank face she adopts with the family. But I want to add that each actor was excellent.

 It was only on reading the director's notes that I discovered the origin of the title - and the basis of the film. Ilo Ilo is Philippine province that Cheng's own nanny/maid was from. I wonder how much of Jiale's role and antics stem from Cheng's childhood.

 Ilo Ilo has small moments of joy and happiness, but I found the majority of it quite sad - each character is struggling. I was thinking about it at the end and I don't recall Mr. or Mrs. Lim smiling in the film at all.

 I enjoyed the look at life in Singapore. Although 'nothing happens' in Ilo Ilo, I was quite engaged from start to finish, wondering where these character's lives were going.",1412294400,5,2182,4.535714285714286

The parents are odious, esp the wife who is a spoiled thing, so we can see why their son is so nasty.
