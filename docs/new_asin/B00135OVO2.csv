8249253,3,B00135OVO2,I got lucky and found a copy on TRS Direct.( Threat Response Solutions.) It's a DVD R and it's got all 3 volumes on it. Presented by Smith and Wesson. First Volume sucks. Usually TRS has dvds of practical self defense. This is the opposite it's Katas. They're just showing off how fast they can go. I bought it because Gene LeBell and Benny. They all get a skit and 5 mins to show off. Gene and another guy are the only ones who do mma moves. Volume 2 is Improvised Weapons. A lot of educational value to this volume. Again each guy gets 5 mins. Volume 3 Is the psychology of an attacker. Cops usually never share what they're looking for. These cops do. It's amazing how they're trained to spot these things. Volume 3 Is just talking. Either way try buying all 3 volumes. All these men have like 25 years of martial arts experience. Fight coordinators in Hollywood.,1443139200,,866,4.385093167701863
