1996299,2,B0001FVEDG,"Maybe it was because it was Japanese. Maybe I didn't read enough reviews, but I wasn't expecting a W.I.P. flick. I thought I was walking into a crime thriller. Wrong!!! This is exploitation pure and simple. About the only thing interesting to me was that I thought these kinds of flicks were a purely American phenomenon.

Here's the scoop. Our heroine is locked up in prison after being duped by her detective boyfriend into participating in a sting operation on some drug pedlars that actually ends up putting him higher up on the crime ladder. She has to go to prison so she can't spill the beans and she vows revenge.

This is some pretty awful stuff. It has all the elements of other W.I.P. flicks with an interesting difference. No dyke guards for these ladies. All the guards here are male. They are stupid and exceedingly cruel. Some of the harshness they dish out to the ladies made me uncomfortable. And there's barely a brain cell working in the script either. Our heroine, Matsu, is tough. She can take the crap being thrown at her. Yet she has revenge on her mind and you see nothing of any kind of plan she might be concocting to escape. She got away once with another prisoner only to get recaptured. The other prisoner was shot in the attempt and Matsu helps nurse her back and the two form a bond. This is one of the few nice elements in the film. When she does escape it's by taking advantage of a prison riot. And when she gets out, the revenge she exacts isn't at all clever. She just guns all the bad guys down one at a time.

I suppose these movies have to be brutal, to some degree, by their very nature. But this was nasty. It was cheap too. The directing was hack. The sound mixing was awful. It just stunk to high heaven. I've seen a few American W.I.P. flicks and even the not so good ones (are there any good ones?) were much better than this.

Unless you have to see every W.I.P. flick ever made, I'd give this a pass.",1309651200,,1947,4.34065934065934
1996300,5,B0001FVEDG,"I saw the second episode in the series (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Female-Convict-Scorpion-Jailhouse-41/dp/6305943885/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Female Convict Scorpion: Jailhouse 41</a>) by chance one evening on tv, looked it up on the internet and decided that I would have to give the whole series a go, starting with the first movie, Female Prisoner #701 - Scorpion (not that you have to see them in order to make sense of each story), which tells us how the main protagonist, Nami Matsushima (Kaji Meiko), an apparently nice and rather shy girl, is used by the man she had fallen in love with, corrupt police inspector Sugimi (Natsuyagi Isao), in a plan that badly backfires for her. Sugimi doesn't hesitate one moment between money and his girlfriend and Nami, having just been abused by a gang of Yakuza, is left on her own. Betrayed and humiliated, she seeks revenge, attacking Sugimi with a knife in broad daylight and on the steps of the police headquarters. As expected though her attack fails and she finds herself arrested and sent to jail

These events are actually told in a flashback early on. The movie itself begins with Matsu, as she is usually called in the prison, and fellow inmate Yuki, attempting to escape. They are caught, however, and put in individual cells where they lie tied up on the ground, at the mercy of the guards and the no less sadistic prison trustees. As the head of the wardens uses the occasion to impose punishment on all inmates, the resentment against Matsu grows among the women just as her resilience and silent stubbornness only serve to infuriate the prison wardens even further as all their attempts to break her fail. As tension escalates, only compounded by Sugimi's scheme to have Matsu assassinated by fellow inmate Katagiri, it isn't difficult to tell that the situation is about to get out of hand....

The plot isn't the movie's strongest point, although it is decent enough and does work adequately as the background layer on which the more interesting and successful aspects of the movie are laid. Firstly, it is, undeniably, a feast for the eyes. Pinky movies were typically done on a shoestring budget, and here it shows, but somehow Ito manages to transcend that and make it a strength, rather than a hindrance: the scene of Nami's first time and the transition to the sting operation are great examples of that as it tells you all you need: a four-posted bed and candles would hardly have made more of the scene

It is hard also to believe it was Ito's first movie: no scene is left to waste. At every turn, he will find an angle or come up with a device to turn every moment of this movie into as many visual pearls, helped in that by the excellent cinematography of Nakazawa Hanjiro. Every shot is powerful and what's more, many of them do add to the story, instead of just being exercises in style, even if some might seem absurd, particularly the first time around: that's true of the more psychedelic visuals (the ""transformation"" of Nami into Scorpion as she lies on the floor) just as much as it is of those which transcend time (trustee Masaki who, in her rage, ironically resembles a Kabuki character; interestingly, this reference to traditional Japanese theatre will be taken one step further in ""Jailhouse 41"")

Another great strength of the director is his ability to simultaneously embrace the Pinky genre, all the while turning many of its concepts on their heads(once very literally as the scene unfolds upside down). Most WiP standards are present which is to be expected: after all, as it is exactly what the Toei wanted. But they never quite turn out to be what one could expect. Sadistic wardens also turn out to be impotent, their batons having to substitute for their sexes when they hurl abuse at Matsu. On the other hand, when given a chance, the prisoners will have little problem to collectively abuse their jailers by using their bodies, in an almost surreal scene: joyous, with the women not in on the action rhythmically chanting and moving their feet and arms, mimicking what could pass for a ritual dance of old. It all comes in complete contrast with the scene of Nami's rape by the Yakuza gang: very subdued, shot from under Nami's shoulders as she lies on a transparent, glass-like surface. All we see are the grotesque expressions on the yakuzas' faces but that's exactly what makes the scene all the more disturbing and stand out

Of course, for the movie to be at all credible, you'd need an able actress in the titular role. Luckily, Kaji is not just an able actress. In fact, her performance goes beyond the notions of ""bad"" and ""good"". She just owns the role completely, managing to make it appealing to both men - her undeniable beauty and sex-appeal - and women - as an avenger of all the wrongs society have committed, and continues to commit, against us. You therefore cannot help but forgive the director for including her in just about every scene, and for the many, many close-ups on her face, and most importantly, her gaze. Matsu never speaks much, although she does utter a few sentences (much more than in the following installment in the series), but her eyes do all the talking, making her presence menacing even though she's, after all, a slender woman without extraordinary physical strength. Her only power lies in her resilience and ability to set her goals and withstand what she has to in order to get there

There are many more aspects of this movie that would deserved to be discussed and expended upon, in particular the implications regarding Japanese society, and, to some extent, developed countries' societies as a whole, in the 70s and beyond: the use and abuse of women as a work- and life force, their instrumentalization (the stain of blood on the white sheet, a result of Nami's defloration, taking the shape of the Japanese flag before becoming diformed, related to the Japanese flag floating at the beginning and conclusion of the movie and to the banner outside the building at the top of which seat the Yakuza boss and Sugimi); the development of post-war, industrial society as one devoid of humanity, and which ultimately ""devours"" those that make it (forced-labor consisting of repetitively digging the ground only to fill the holes again right after; the symbolic burial of Matsu by the other inmates when she stands alone in the trench)

But at the end of the day, ""Female Prisoner #701 - Scorpion"" is more about an experience for the senses and the mind than it is about words. It is definitely not suitable for children, and the faint of heart may want to give it a miss too. As for everyone else, don't let its Pinky/WiP affiliation fools you, although it is in part the very use - and diversion - of the codes of the genre that makes it both a delectable guilty pleasure and a great and unique movie

PS: this review is based on the French box set where the contrast has definitely been increased compared to the original Japanese transfer. It does results in a slight loss of details in dark or bright scenes and I would guess some of the colors are deeper and more vibrant than initially intended, but it is very pleasant nonetheless. I've had the occasion to see the version presented on this page and the DVD transfer is solid, which is to be expected considering it's the original one from the Toei. There is some ghosting issue though, which comes as a surprise. Sound is the original mono for both version, which is probably a good thing, and in both cases, subtitles are adequate. Not much in terms of extras but that doesn't really come as a surprise, and this movie doesn't need them",1251590400,4,7684,4.772180451127819

Note to folks who complained about subtitles: on some DVD players, you must ACTIVELY turn the sub titles ON using your DVD's internal function. There is no menu item to do this on the DVD. I have found this to be true with a few of the Media Blaster/Tokyo Shock dvd's. On my player I can do this just using my remote control and hitting the 'subtitles' button.",1118966400,9,549,4.435643564356436

Stylish, surreal, violent and a true cinematic work of art. At a time when cinema really peaked w/ classics like Top Sensation and The Psychedelic Girls ( Mexico) and on.. there was just so much great stuff going on. It has always pained me that a talentless windbag director would rape the culture. You can't top this stuff, so you leave it alone. The dvd from Tokyo Shock/Media Blasters looks good and definitely is a huge improvement on my tapes.",1523923200,,595,4.467889908256881

8011903,4,B0001FVEDG,"Based on a graphic novel, ""Female Prisoner #701: Scorpion"" is about a woman, Matsushima (or Matsu), who had been used by a corrupt cop to infiltrate the yakuza.  She is sent to a women's prison where she is just brutalized in so many ways!  Because of her many transgressions within the prison, including an escape (at the very beginning of the movie), she becomes the scourge of the other women inmates who are punished together for what Matsu does.  She is an extremely hardened woman, strong and nearly unflinching.  She is also hell-bent on revenge on the cop.  I don't want to give away too much.

First, Meiko Kaji has to be one of the MOST stunning Japanese actresses!  She is best known for being Lady Snowblood in the movies/sequels of the same name.  She is also in the sequels of this movie.  I've only seen parts of ""Lady Snowblood.""  Her face is perfect, and she would just about put any modern Japanese actress to shame in similar films for her ability of not uttering a word and using facial expressions.  I would give her 5 stars for this film based solely on her.

The movie is pretty over-the-top, but it is an exploitation flick.  It is a very stylized film, many times shot on sets that look like graphic novel backdrops.  The makeup and acting is cartoonish, especially by the prison guards, warden, and gangsters.

The movie is filled with nudity, violence, blood, torture, two graphic rapes, stabbings, shootings, and did I forget to say nudity??  It is DEFINITELY for those who enjoy this type of film.

Amazingly, the movie was made in 1972!  Other than some of the hairdos that many women have, the movie looks and feels like it was made in the late-1990s!  Amazing. The film is the first for the director, Shunya Ito.

Although I am not fond of this type of movie (the women's prison exploitation flick), I did enjoy it for its highly stylized looks, the strong woman character who is unphased by anything, and the decent (but sometimes way over-the-top) acting.  It is another manga-based Japanese movie, and one has to keep that in mind while watching.  I did not like the fact that the movie is ""Not Rated"" and doesn't give reasons on the DVD (it is extremely violent and has oodles of nudity).  The DVD case also seems to assume that it is some type of detective movie, and it is NOT.  It is the women's prison exploitation movie (and probably the best one I have seen as far as look and story).

4 1/2 of 5 Amazon stars (Amazon does not give 1/2 stars).  Worth a look, but NOT for the casual movie watcher!  NOT FOR CHILDREN BY ANY MEANS!  Excellent subtitle work (the black-framed white lettering that make it easy to read on light backgrounds).",1376956800,,2678,4.5576519916142555
