8478183,5,B005LJF1BS,Easy to understand and follow. I've been looking for a instructional DVD for ages.,1520985600,,82,4.928571428571429
8478184,4,B005LJF1BS,"This DVD has a lot of useful info. Seems to be filmed either in the 80s or 90s. While it is informative, and I'm not knocking it at all, pretty much everything on it can be found on youtube for free. There's a series of clips looking to be filmed around the same time this one was by another artist that has a lot of the very same info this has on youtube. Plus there's new guys on youtube who teach pretty much the same info. I don't regret buying it all altho it seems a little overpriced considering this was filmed a looong time ago and is only around an hour long. I think it should have been priced around $9.

But having said that I did order another one in the series just because I like the dated look and feel of everything and just for the memories of those days.",1501718400,,774,4.0588235294117645
