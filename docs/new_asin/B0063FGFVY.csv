4935901,1,B0063FGFVY,"I would like to express my disappointment in Cartoon Networks insatiable greed.  I love certain programs like Adventure Time.  However, I am outraged on how there are now, not one, but five random selections of episodes out on DVD.  I will take time out of my day to make sure reviews on all websites that sell these partial seasons will clearly tell people how CN is driven by greed and not to buy these mixed seasons and not to support partial season DVDs.  You can put crap in a shiny box and call it a favor, but it is still crap.  So many customers demand full seasons ONLY!  You may fool the average house mom, but with a little education, my fellow peers will have their eyes opened to CN's deceit of its customers and insatiable greed.  What ever happened to producing quality products?  What ever happened to companies that didn't try to gouge the customer and fool them into thinking they are getting a good deal?  The DVD's cost you way less than a dollar to produce, but yet you want to try and fool the common customer to buy these mixed seasons of wonderful shows. Sadly, taking care of the customer and offering quality products appears to be a thing of the past.

Please don't hack up the dream works dragons of Burke when you put those seasons out on DVD.  I will follow the releases and also educate the average customer on your business tactics and lack of general ethics.  My voice will be heard, if not by CN, but by the average consumer.

I don't normally complain, but I am sick and tired of large companies scamming and price gouging the loyal fans for the sake of a few extra bucks.  America is no longer a producer of quality, now it seems we are a producer of deception and greed.  You should be ASHAMED CARTOON NETWORK!",1333497600,2,1747,4.415625
4935902,3,B0063FGFVY,"I can honestly say that this is the first time I have been truly disappointed by Shout! Factory.

To follow up a Seasons 1&2 box set with only and 1/2 season release feels downright disrespectful to the fans.  It's as if the first box set was bait was a series of slapped together cash grabbers.

I understand that business is business, but they haven't treated other shows this way before.  It's strange that they're beginning to break up seasons now.  (i.e.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CatDog-Season-One-Part-One/dp/B005BUA1JE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CatDog: Season One, Part One</a>&nbsp;,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CatDog-Season-One-Part-Two/dp/B006JN87SY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CatDog: Season One, Part Two</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hey-Arnold-Season-Two-Part-1/dp/B006JN870C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hey Arnold! Season Two, Part 1</a>, etc)

As a fan I did pre-order this item as there is no alternative.  Some studios will offer full season releases paired with individual volumes for those not so committed to the series.

I've always bragged on Shout! Factory, and never harder than when the 2-Season DVD premier of Angry Beavers was announced. I've been telling everyone about Shout! Factory since I discovered the Home Movies box sets (e.g.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Home-Movies-Season-One/dp/B0002YCVY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Home Movies - Season One</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Home-Movies-10th-Anniversary-Set-Limited-Edition-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B001D2WUCK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Home Movies 10th Anniversary Set [Limited Edition] [Deluxe Edition</a>]),but for the first time I can honestly say that I'm disappointed with the company's approach to sticking it to the fans that support them and have supported them for so many years.",1330128000,12,2007,8.00900900900901
4935903,1,B0063FGFVY,"Just release season 3 and 4 together complete!! I was pretty happy with Shout Factory's first Angry Beavers release with season 1 & 2 together, even though they didn't put any special features on the discs. But please release Seasons 3 & 4 all together as one to complete the set. I really don't want to have to buy FOUR more sets to complete the collection.",1322265600,12,358,4.4393939393939394

8491976,3,B0063FGFVY,"I loved the angry beavers growing up... the reason being I realized after watching this is because I watched during the first and second seasons which were the best.
This season falls short of laughs relying mostly on cheap gross out jokes and body humor. The two brothers are still as charming as ever but the stories just border on stupid.
Worth a watch for nostalgic value but not much.more",1394236800,,393,4.628571428571429

8491978,5,B0063FGFVY,I'm going to buy all of the Angry Beavers DVDs. I love this show. You can tell Bakay and Horvitz had an opportunity to play in the recording studio which brings even more color to their characters. Angry Beavers is a treat to own and watch.,1356048000,,240,4.239130434782608
8491979,5,B0063FGFVY,"Okay, so after the ""surprise"" success of the first DVD they apparently got stingy and only put half a season on this one... but... it's Angry Beavers!!!!  I'm still sold.  Bought it and am enjoying the awesome viewing experience, which is high quality as well, compared to other less professional editions I've seen.  So if you're an Angry Beavers fan, do yourself a favour and just buy it.  Pretty sure you won't regret it.",1344124800,3,424,4.6891891891891895
