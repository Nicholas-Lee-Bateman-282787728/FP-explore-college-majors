7801081,5,1893907503,"I have had this video for about a week and am amazed at how quickly I have picked up from it. As long as you keep the remote handy to rewind often, and don't try to advance too quickly. Don't order it without getting the book also. Otherwise you will be using alot of paper writing up your practice sheets! Happy pickin'!!",1012176000,4,322,4.209677419354839
7801082,3,1893907503,"This video is good if you already have common knowledge on how to play the banjo, but if your just starting and have never picked a banjo up, I would consider trying something else.  He goes through the basics, but he goes  through them rather quickly and it doesn't give you a real chance to see or  learn what he is doing.  He also likes to show off in the video.  After he  instructs at a slow speed, he shows off and plays the whole song at normal  speed, knowing that you can't keep up.",949449600,32,491,4.105263157894737
