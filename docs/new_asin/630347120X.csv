The 'Tale of Samuel Whiskers' is one about three mischievous kittens and their watchful momma.  At first it appears that mother is over vigilant, but then we find out why she keeps such a tight rein on them.  When she becomes diverted for a moment, Mittens and Moppet hide in the flour barrels, and naughty Tom goes up the chimney (of all places!) where he meets Samuel Whiskers and his wife.  They  (the rats) soon decide that Tom would make a fine meal and they tie him up.  Momma and Auntie come to the rescue.

As usual, the quality on this series is excellent and everything that the other reviewers said is true.  Classic stuff.

Four to Five Stars.  Excellent all around.  Single reservation about content that could be scary for some, but not all (apparently) small children.",1121126400,,894,4.490683229813665
7848250,5,630347120X,"This is top quality, particularly the pacing and composition of the dialogue. This is a video that young children love (mine are 5 and 3) because of the characters and suspenseful plot, but is not dumbed down in the least. Frankly, the British have a much better handle on the English language than we Americans. This type of video shows children the potential for poetry and elegance in the English language, without being over their heads.",1050451200,3,441,4.815789473684211
7848251,5,630347120X,"For children 3 or older this is an excellent show.  I agree with all the superlatives in the other reviews.
Very young children, however, may be perplexed as to why Mr. and Mrs. Whiskers have wrapped the kitten up in a pastry, or why Mrs. Twitchett locks her kittens up in a cupboard.",1011916800,4,284,4.3584905660377355
7848252,5,630347120X,I would rate this one the best of the series.  Samuel Whiskers and Anna Maria are delightful villains with their mannerisms and personalities.  Lovely music track we actually found on a tape which includes many songs  from the Beatrix Potter series.  The naughty kittens are wonderful with  their quaint sayings and childish ways.  A family favorite!  I love the  English voices and settings.  Original art animated.,923961600,,416,5.181818181818182
