8600840,3,B00E44EZXG,I just collected this movie because I had Action Jackson in my collection and wanted to add another Carl Weathers film to compliment it. The plot meandered and the sex scene was not steamy although it was grist for the mill as far as late 80s early 90s sex scenes go. I always thought Carl Weathers to be asexual in his films so to see that in this film was different. The film itself was good quality as of the transfer to DVD.,1395100800,,428,4.168674698795181
