The narrator is truly believable in his enthusiasm and brought me into the film like no other. I reccomend this to anyone looking for an unparraleled experience. My one complaint, it ended. I only give it 5 stars because I can't give it anymore.",1516924800,,350,4.85
8137302,5,B000H7I4X6,I am getting DVD for my grandson's 6th birthday.  It is very interesting and the narrator does a great job.,1370390400,,107,4.35
8137303,5,B000H7I4X6,"At first I thought having a narration by a small child would be annoying, but it actually helps recapture the joy one gets in seeing all these very neat birds.  It also has some of the best photos I've seen, and as far as I know, there is no video like this specifically aimed at adults. I had seen parts of it in a museum in Alaska before buying, so I don't know if I would have bought sight unseen, but maybe my review can help in a decision for people that want to see the wonderful variety of birds that call Alaska home for at least part of the year.",1189641600,,555,4.0
