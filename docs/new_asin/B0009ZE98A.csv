8070845,5,B0009ZE98A,"My partner is Cuban, and came to the U.S.A in 2001,( though the lottery system Bill Clinton introduced). He thought this movie captured the Cuban immigrant experience perfectly as well as the nuanced humor intrinsic in Cubans: A unique and and dark humor that is at once alarming and hilarious.
  The Cuban immigration experience can be a sad subject, but the film kept it lighthearted. It is a film that anybody who likes some insight with their entertainment can appreciate.
 The humor and nuance is captured and performed with absolute grace by the cast and especially the stellar  Jorge Perugoria ( strawberry and chocolate etc.)
 The characters in this film may be flawed, but we all are, for we are human! American films suck at showing humans is a realistic light, and when Hollywood does try and do this the result is some heavy handed piece of crap. That is why foreign movies rock!
  Buy this film, it is worth it! And my hunch is that you will watch it again and again!",1373587200,,980,4.630057803468208
8070846,3,B0009ZE98A,"An entertaining movie about the lives of three Cuban sisters who emigrate to Spain. What's most interesting about this film is the study in contrasts between the sister's closeted, communist homeland and the wild, capitalist culture of Spain. The culture shock that the sisters experience and the funny moments that arise from it as they accustom themselves with their new home are what endeared me to this solid bit of filmmaking.",1337558400,,431,5.084507042253521
8070847,5,B0009ZE98A,"If you love Cuban comedies, this is a great film for you to get.

Even with sub-titles you should be able to understand the comedy and commentary presented by the film. Cuba is a country of contrast, and this is just one example of that.

I have watched this several times, and laugh every time.",1322179200,,295,4.345454545454546
8070848,1,B0009ZE98A,I watched it all the way through because I kept waiting for it to get better. Nothing but the government's official spin and stereotypes. I threw it in the trash.,1195948800,,162,4.433333333333334
