7953454,3,B00005S8LA,"This patriotic DVD is badly edited.  Their are numerous times when the audio isn't in sync with the lips of people talking.  Transition from scene to scene is rough and abrupt.
I am returning this DVD for replacement because it is defective, and the last 1/3 of the DVD is unviewable. Perhaps the replacement DVD won't have these faults.",1043366400,3,337,4.694915254237288
7953455,4,B00005S8LA,"This was a really good overview of historic events in America.  There is so much news footage of events that many of us were not alive to see or if we were - to remember it.  I remember my dad waking us up to see the walk on the moon - but I didn't remember the footage of it because I was so young.  It was neat to see it.  I also remember the Challenger explosion and they included a very short speech by President Reagan that night.  I can appreciate these things more now that I understand the gravity of these situations.  They had really good coverage of the September 11 attacks, including part of the prayer service on the 14th.  It is well worth seeing several times and keeping to show to children, grandchildren, and on to other generations.  I would recommend it highly - the only thing is, they got the date of Kennedy's funeral wrong.  They have 1962 - otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.",1027900800,2,907,4.257309941520468
