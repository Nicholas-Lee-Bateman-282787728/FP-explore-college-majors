Thank you Amanda Shires for pointing him in the right direction. I preordered ""Something More Than Free.."" and should have it by Thursday. Can't wait.

6701828,5,B00O20UV1C,"Great Set by this guy. I have probably seen him live about six or seven times. Pours his heart in to each show. Still can't believe he only got a half hour on the TV broadcast. ACL does that a lot, gives a great performer 30 minutes and then gives scrubs a full hour. You can't go wrong with Jason Isbell, best songwriter around.",1433980800,,329,4.15625
6701829,4,B00O20UV1C,This is the first music I have purchased from Jason Isbell.  I listened to him on Youtube and I liked his music and that led me to purchase it.  Music is good but picture quality is average.  Even though it is a DVD not blu-ray the picture could be better.,1433635200,,256,4.08

6701836,4,B00O20UV1C,"The concert is fantastic (5-stars).  I'd saved this ACL episode on my DVR for months and watched it several times.  Unfortunately, the quality of this DVD is sub-par -- lower than that of the show on my DVR.  Though that likely has nothing to do with the exceptionally talented Jason Isbell, the product itself doesn't deserve 5-stars at that production level.",1424908800,,360,4.868852459016393
6701837,5,B00O20UV1C,"Magical performance by Jason Isbell, his beautiful and talented wife Amanda Shires, and the awesome 400 Unit.  Heartfelt, beautiful songs and also kick-it-up numbers.  I just disovered Jason a few months ago, driving home late at night and listening to World Cafe - I heard the first few lines of ""Cover Me Up"" and almost had to pull the car over, I was so moved.  Since then I've bought three albums and seen him live in Kansas City - amazing live performer.  So what a treat to buy this DVD and get to see the whole band up close and personal.  It's like being there, only better.  :-)  Well worth your money, about 1.5 hours of excellence.  He's a national treasure.",1424822400,,669,4.471074380165289
6701838,5,B00O20UV1C,"An absolutely amazing night of music that I thank God was recorded for everyone's benefit.
Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit - at the top of their game - playing the best songs from Jason's four albums.
This is so highly recommended that I wish I could get a high-powered spot light and shoot it up into the sky so that everyone would know how absolutely incredible this album is. Two thumbs up all-around!",1424563200,,402,4.445945945945946
6701839,4,B00O20UV1C,"I bought this after seeing the abbreviated version on Austin City Limits.  I love the songs and the performance, think it's awesome music.  I would give it a five, but the sound and picture quality are sub par.  Just about every DVD I own has a spectacular picture.  This one is a bit grainy.  As to the sound, it's not bad or scratchy, but you have to turn the volume level up double the usual level to get the same loudness.  That's probably not the artist's fault, I'm guessing more it's what they had to work with.  I watch Austin City Limits almost every broadcast, and I have to turn my TV and Stereo up to max volume every time.  No idea why the sound level is so much lower than other broadcasts, but it's been that way as long as I've been watching it.",1424563200,3,761,4.2

6701841,4,B00O20UV1C,Jason Isbell is an excellent songwriter and performer. This set catches him in peak form playing mostly from the extraordinary Southeastern LP.,1423353600,,143,5.545454545454546

6701843,5,B00O20UV1C,"Jason never fails to surprise and entertain. This guy is today's answer to Jackson Browne. Like Jackson, his songs are in many cases ""dark"" and like Jackson, his lyrics are brilliant and his music original. You get halfway into hearing one of Jason's tunes and you find yourself trying to memorize the lyrics and sing along! That to me is the very definition of a ""great songwriter""! Even when he covers another artist as he so creatively does with the Rolling Stones' ""Can't You Hear Me Knocking"", Jason makes it his own, dazzling with guitar solos as the original had but changing them just enough to reflect his own style without taking anything from the original structure. This gentleman is a modern musical genius and this DVD is a perfect exhibit of that genius in action! Don't pass this one up, it's a killer set!!",1421971200,2,823,4.682758620689655

6701845,4,B00O20UV1C,"Very warm, very enjoyable concert.  Even Jason Isbell admits that some of his songs are sad and melancholy, but the writing and performing are excellent.  Well lit, you get a very intimate concert feel here.  I especially liked Elephant and Stockholm off of his award winning Southeastern album.  The addition of Amanda Shires on Violin/fiddle really add  feeling to these songs.  Great job.",1421452800,,391,5.126984126984127

6701848,5,B00O20UV1C,Absolutely awesome!!! I have seen Jason and the 400 Unit several times and this DVD is an excellent representation of their work. Way to go guys! (And the lovely Amanda Shires makes it even better!),1420848000,,198,4.685714285714286
6701849,5,B00O20UV1C,"Jason Isbell was a top notch singer/songwriter with a hit or miss career, largely due to his alcohol abuse. In the last few years, he settled down, got clean and married, and recorded the best cd of his career, ""Southeastern"". This dvd is a top notch recording of the Austin City Limits broadcast that got me hooked on Jason Isbell in the first place. The dvd is the complete concert, not the few songs played on the ACL broadcast. If you buy this dvd, you might as well order the ""Southeastern"" cd, you'll be wanting it after watching the show, most of the acoustic numbers are from this cd and the concert is from the tour supporting that cd. Check out his you-tube videos, especially ""Elephant"".",1420848000,2,698,4.5476190476190474
6701850,5,B00O20UV1C,"Jason Isbell's brilliant talent is on full display on this DVD. Austin City Limits always provides such an amazing  balance of live performance energy and studio-quality recording, and this concert is no exception. Not only is Jason  at the top of his game here, the 400 Unit is absolutely on fire during this performance. A must have for any DBT fans, Isbell solo fans, or anyone who has good taste in music.",1420761600,,409,4.666666666666667

6701853,5,B00O20UV1C,Awesome DVD! Isbell is the man. Great set! He comes out with pure heat to start the set! It flows into some of his more softer acoustic songs and follows with a killer encore! I love the  arrangements and set list. Great show. Great production. A must have!,1420588800,,257,4.354166666666667
6701854,4,B00O20UV1C,"I love getting to see the full performance (versus the edited version shown on ""ACL,"" but I can't give it five stars because there is no closed captioning. The TV show is captioned, so I'm very disappointed that the DVD is not.",1420502400,,227,4.428571428571429
6701855,5,B00O20UV1C,One of the greatest singer songwriters of this or any generation. Great live with the 400 unit. Nothing's not to like. Only thing better would be blu ray.,1420243200,,154,4.535714285714286

6701862,5,B00O20UV1C,"When you look at my Itunes playlist of ""Most Played"" songs, the top 10 spots belong to songs from Isbell's Southeastern album. It is nothing short of a masterpiece and I have listened to it on constant repeat. I was so excited when I found out that his complete ACL set was being released as a DVD and it does not disappoint. There are some old favs from his Drive-By Truckers days, plus some cuts from  his solo work before Southeastern. I highly recommend if you're already an Isbell fan--and if you aren't, you will be after you watch this DVD.",1419724800,4,547,4.415841584158416
6701873,5,B00O20UV1C,Lovely DVD with an amazing artist and a great band! Great to hear him joke around between the songs and cool to see Amanda Shires on fiddle. Love all the songs but my favorites are Outfit and Danko/Manuel.,1419638400,,205,4.421052631578948

6701881,5,B00O20UV1C,"Ever since his days with the Drive-By Truckers, Jason Isbell has increasingly proven that he is an excellent songwriter.  His album ""Southestern"" was picked by many people including myself as one of the best albums of 2013. I saw him perform live in March of 2014 and he was excellent.  It is great that the entire ACL performance of this is included  A real nice mix of his songs ranging from somewhat humorous ""Super 8"", to very heartfelt and personal ""Elephant"" (about a friend who is dying of cancer).  My only complaint is that i wish it was also available on Blu-ray.",1418083200,3,573,4.588235294117647

Mr. Isbell, Mrs, Isbell and The 400 Unit :

You all have - IT- !
It has been a long long time since I last enjoyed discovering a band as good and real as yours.
By good I mean you knock me back and make me stand there with my mouth open enthralled with your every word, note and nuance.
People . . . if you like ""Good "" music BUY THIS DVD (and 400 Unit albums). Like Duke Ellington said : ""There are two kinds of music. There is Good music and then there is every thing else"".
Amanda Shires, the violinist and vocalist, (Mrs. Isbell) . . .
really adds to the band BIG TIME !
besides all that she could easily get a job as worlds most beautiful woman
(yah I think she's great can you tell ?) Be sure to look up the YouTubes of just him and her in the studio ! ! !

PS: When the Blue-Ray of this Austin City Limits or similar 400 Unit concert comes out I am there.
PPS: When I first played this DVD I was listening through head phones and it sounded awful:  harsh and some vocals and the violin sounded off in the distance.  I went into the sound options on the DVD menu and selected 5.1 surround and it sounded right even though the head phones are obviously just stereo.",1417564800,12,1208,3.995850622406639
