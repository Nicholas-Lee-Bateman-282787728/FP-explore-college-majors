Science wins hands down.",1409702400,,111,5.166666666666667

6268202,5,B00IK4XK64,"very factually done  it was as good as, or better than, being there for the debate.  I'm surprised that the debate was held at Creation Museum!",1402185600,,143,4.461538461538462
6268203,5,B00IK4XK64,"Finally, creation advocates are allowed to speak!  This is the long awaited counterpart to the infamous Scope's trial.  Very gratifying.",1397520000,3,136,5.75
6268204,5,B00IK4XK64,"Ken Ham and Bill Nye go mano-a-mano in this debate that was heavily hyped online and broadcast live earlier in 2014.  The two had a structured debate which included formal presentations, debate, and Q/A.  As you can imagine, the arguments ultimately dwindled down to Ham insisting that the known universe is only 6,000 years old and Bill Nye demanding proof beyond a translated book.

The debate itself is worth watching, primarily for those who are interested in educating themselves more on what exactly the standpoint of Intelligent Design and Creationist consider to be their talking points.  It's interesting to note that Ken Ham uses several video quotes from ID scientists who don't necessarily support the 6,000 year old universe theory.

Bill Nye progressively points out the age of existence by pointing out observable light, sedimentary layers, and fossil records.

While no winner is declared during the course of the debate, most will agree that Nye's data-centric approach was more persuasive than Ham's redefinition of scientific terms and his ""we weren't there to record it happening, therefore it must be questioned"" approach.

The debate is also humorous, with Bill Nye cracking a few jokes (some are successful, some painfully are not), as well as Ken Ham often mentioning that there IS indeed a written record which answers all the unknown answers of the universe.",1397001600,16,1384,5.179372197309417
8642852,5,B00IK4XK64,"Originally, I saw this discussion between Bill Nye and Ken Ham when video of the event was made available on the Internet only hours after the event had taken place.  I should point out that this discussion was not a true debate in the sense that both parties did not share a common frame of reference on which to base their arguments.  Evidence of this was the fact that both parties (and their respective supporters) felt that their own side had won the debate.

With that being said, the discussion between Nye and Ham was riveting from start to finish.  Nye had definitely done his homework when he laid out his own arguments; and, nobody could deny that Ham knew the Bible well.  It reminded me of a staring contest in which neither side blinked.  This discussion demonstrated rather dramatically why it was unlikely that either side would ever win over any significant number of recruits from the opposite side of the discussion.  Each man felt that his own arguments were water-tight based on his own paradigm.",1493942400,,1017,4.711864406779661

8642854,5,B00IK4XK64,"I love this debate (if you can call it that). Bill Nye lays out the evidence fantastically, obviously falling on deaf ears. The only issue is the last disc which is supposedly after the show commentary, it is actually a disc with an interview of Ken Ham by one of his employees where they take turns insulting Bill (who isn't there to defend himself. I wish this had been distributed by another source, I'd rather have not given my money to The Creationist ""Museum"".",1456099200,2,466,4.559523809523809
8642855,5,B00IK4XK64,"I sat down to watch a ""little bit"" of this debate and ended up watching the entire 2 hours--which says a lot! It was interesting that Ken Ham, in his opening statement, said that based on the FACTS of science [including the same facts that ""secular scientists"" agree upon] creationist can make these ""predictions."" More than once in the course of the debate, Bill Nye said that one of the problems with the creation science is that they could make no predictions. Three or four times during the debate, Ken Ham made the statement that ""based on creation science we can predict...."" This is an interesting presentation and from what I read, both sides feel they won. :-)",1453334400,,669,4.677966101694915
8642856,5,B00IK4XK64,"Fantastic debate. Bill Nye looks like a third grader debating a college professor, he uses arguments that were proved wrong over thirty years ago...",1434412800,3,148,5.208333333333333
8642857,4,B00IK4XK64,I  use these videos for in the high school biology class I teach. We all seemed to be fascinated with the arguments presented.,1428019200,,126,4.478260869565218
8642858,1,B00IK4XK64,"It is stupid to see this debate. It was not a debate. Evolution is a fact and Bill utterly explained it to Ham. But the idiot didn't listen and dodge questions. This was not a debate, just a schooling and creationism exposed there stupidity by not giving any specific answers. Don't waste your time.",1425254400,4,299,4.555555555555555
8642859,5,B00IK4XK64,Ken Ham does a great job presenting creation science and includes video's of other scientist that have contributed greatly to modern science and are also creationist.,1424822400,4,166,5.423076923076923

8642861,5,B00IK4XK64,"Admiringly I actually bought my copy from the Answers in Genesis ran The Creation Museum in Petersburg, KY an I got it for free with a $24.00 one year subscription to there Answers Magazine! The set I got is the legit manufactured release seen here and not the other version on Amazon that is just a DVD-R copy. It is 4 discs as described and is a nice and informative set. I would encourage any potential buyer to also obtain Bill Nye's boom Undeniable: Evolution and the Science of Creation (which was written in response to these debate) to go along with these DVD's, they'd make a great gift combo!",1416182400,2,602,4.4818181818181815
