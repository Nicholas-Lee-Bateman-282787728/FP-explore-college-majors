5007320,5,B0013U4RWS,"I just love Law and Order: SVU.  These episodes are intelligently put together.  Very captivating and perfectly suspenseful.  If you are looking for a good crime mystery, this is it for you.  Guaranteed.  Don't settle for CSI and NCIS. :)",1467763200,,238,4.85
5007321,5,B0013U4RWS,"I love the show.  Good chemistry in the actors.  Cases that make me want to vomit.  Well written.

Where are seasons 2, 3, and 4?",1463270400,,129,4.04

5007328,5,B0013U4RWS,I am a late-comer to the Law & Order phenomenon.  I didn't get interested in the show until about six months ago and now I have made it through season 10. I love the plot lines and the characters on the show. I don't think you have to start with season 1 but I did find it helpful that I learned about Olivia and Elliot a lot in the first season. A part of me was worried that the plots would get redundant but they never do  Each episode has such a diverse range of supporting actors and actresses that they keep the show lively and entertaining. Definitely recommend buying the DVD series for people who have seen the series before and for those who have never seen it before.,1435276800,,678,4.207692307692308

5007331,5,B0013U4RWS,so exciting to watch. This show has me hooked. I bought this season after season 1. I wonder why they don't have seasons 2-4 on instant?,1433808000,,136,4.269230769230769
5007332,1,B0013U4RWS,It still has not downloaded and it's been 3 days.,1429142400,,49,4.0
5007333,5,B0013U4RWS,Excellent episode and especially the subject matter which I discussed in my AIDS & STD's class.,1426377600,,95,5.0
5007334,5,B0013U4RWS,"Great Movie, used it in my psychology class to discuss the Approaches and Key Issues in Psychology.",1426204800,,99,4.882352941176471
5007335,3,B0013U4RWS,I ordered this episode specifically because it deals with FASD.  While I appreciate there being an episode of a prime time TV show that took on what is a very complex issue I wish that it had dealt with more than how FASD affects the parents - children born with FASD become adults with FASD.  This topic has so much more to consider than just the prevention message they zeroed in on.,1422230400,,385,4.333333333333333
8501381,1,B0013U4RWS,These are not legit- will not play- tried them all and yes my DVD player is working for all other DVD's,1527724800,,103,3.9523809523809526

8501384,1,B0013U4RWS,Ive never done a review before - but this DVD IS BOOTLEGGED!! I tried multiple DVD & BluRay players. Nothing is working. It keeps giving me the message this device cannot play media from abroad I waited too long to return the item or I would have. (I wasn't finished with season 4 yet) Anywho. DO NOT BUY THIS!!! Find a different seller.,1514246400,,337,4.365079365079365
8501385,5,B0013U4RWS,"I love that the officers in the show are ""good"" cops, as opposed to some of the characters on some other shows,The characters are firmly ethical, and complex enough to be human. As a teacher of at-risk children, I identify with the heartbreak and its toll on people's lives. Yay! Good wins!",1496188800,,290,4.596153846153846

8501388,2,B0013U4RWS,"I really enjoy the program and the season. I gave it only 2 stars because I purchased season 5 when it was available as streaming video, and 1 month later it was pulled from availability by Amazon. Now when I try to watch, the message Watch thru Hulu comes up. ( but you only can do THAT if you have a membership WITH Hulu.) There should be information someplace to indicate how long Amazon will carry a program so that those of us who purchase streaming video can decide if it is worth it. DVDs don't disappear from your shelves when they are no longer carried.",1485043200,3,562,4.311320754716981
8501389,5,B0013U4RWS,I don't know why but I never watched this show when it was new and aired on tv.  Seen it a few times at friends house and I'm hooked.,1482969600,,133,3.586206896551724
8501390,5,B0013U4RWS,Fantastic presentation.,1480118400,,23,11.0
