4368394,4,B004FGA2HQ,"There are a lot of good history re-enactors scenes as well as commentary. You got a sense that you was in the actual battle. However, these re-enactments are re-played often throughout the film and after awhile you think you're looking at the same scene over again. I found the map commentary to be very good, although I would have liked to have seen more of it. I still recommend this DVD for the history buffs out there and for those who enjoy re-enactments.",1326672000,30,460,4.554216867469879
