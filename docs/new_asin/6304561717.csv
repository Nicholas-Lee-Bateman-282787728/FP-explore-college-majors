and Last Don and watched FREE! both as good as I remembered when they first aired. The Last Don is as good as any Mob movie but it does
have it's parts that just wasn't necessary but the story is well written directed and acted by all the cast. I wish Aiello had been in more of the
story but he makes part one really good. The 2nd part with the sister and the priest was the part I didn't like I just thought it was stupid. She
should have fallen in love with another mob guy instead. But the rest of the movie moves fast and the ending done really well. If you love good
mob movies like Godfather, Goodfellas, Power of Attorney, The Don is Dead, Gotti, Boss of Bosses etc...you will love this movie.",1438646400,,820,4.067901234567901

917429,5,6304561717,"The Last Don & The Last Don 2 are fantastic. Often compared rightly so to The Godfather movies. Mob movie fans will not be disappointed. The story pulls you in right from the first scene and doesn't let go until the final scene in Last Don 2. The actor that plays the lunatic grandson Dante is someone that no one would want to meet in daylight let alone at night. Interestingly that part was played by the actor Rory Cochran who went on to be a cast member of C.S.I. Miami.

I have always been amazed by the mindset and logic of mob guys. Listening to Danny Aiello and Pippi's (Joe Mantania) logic is mind blowing. I can highly recommend both of these mini series. They are worth the time watching and the money spent and definitely belong in every serious movie lover's library",1421625600,,779,4.409722222222222

917699,5,6304561717,"I had never seen the mini series and never read the book, but I always enjoy these ""mafia"" type movies since I have a lot of interest in the history of the Italian mafia families.  Also, I am a great Jason Gedrick fan and that cinched the buy for me.  I have since read the book and found to my amazement the screenplay (unlike so many other rewrites) is very faithful to the book with few ""Hollywood"" changes/additions.

I've always felt Jason Gedrick has been overlooked as a great actor and he, as well as others in the cast do a terrific job of bringing this book to life.  I have also acquired The Last Don II and found it to be as good.  Can't go wrong with this series, especially if you enjoy the Mafia style stories.

917991,4,6304561717,"MARIO PUZO'S ""THE LAST DON"" is intended for those who are  keenly interested
in the backdrop and in the  behind the scenes look at the individuals running
their own business operations generating a lot of earnings, profits and cash,
in this instance, in the underworld.

Danny Aiello, does an outstanding job as the head honcho, who is lays out the
medium and long term strategies and plans of his group, and guides along his
caporegime  grandsons, consiglieri and  family members day in, day out.

Joe Mantegna's acting, as well, is on par, playing the hammer or collector
of illegal debts for the group, with a valid balanced approach between hard-line
rubouts and enjoying life outside work, interacting with a number of sensual women,
in the picture, such as Daryl Hanna, Penelope Anne Miller, Kirstie Alley, and more.
A significant amount of time is spent showing his married lifestyle, comprised of
his kids growing up, and guiding them along to a young adulthood until independence.

Jason Gedrick brings freshness to the picture, by living out the workoholic lifestyle of
a young single man, who runs the operations of a casino, in this case, with parallel
money laundering and the catching fraudsters at the tables- who cause illegitimate losses
to the casino. A chemistry with Hanna, is definitely the case on screen, as the two
are ambitious and successful individuals in their areas.

Extending over 4 hours, the movie captures the imagination of the viewing public, and
drawsm into the picture, that itself, although not released on DVD as widescreen
unfortunately, is still spectacular with  its glossy, quality look and its sharpness and
focus throughout the filming.

The audio is comprised of instrumental or orchestral numbers that are no-nonsense,
adding beauty to the work overall, in a classical or European sense, that will
appeal mostly to those with a learned palate  since it's not pop or rock based.

If there are perhaps some flaws to this picture, it would be the predictable nature of
events and in how things turn out, as well as the ending that panders to Hollywood, since
the guy gets the gal, and the bad guys get what they deserve. Another flaw is namedropping
Schwartzie, and Van Damme  as stars and simulating the filming of a picture inside a picture
with kd land as the director, which is a distraction in the overall work,  and dates it,
although it perhaps  lessens the introspective social view of the characters.

A curious aspect, also Hollywoodian, is the tendency to introduce a disability or disease to
the public by showing a character suffering from it,  in this case, the autism of Hanna's daughter.

The positive aspects, aside from those already mentioned, is obviously the
presence of Europe, its culture,  values,  gastronomic lifestyle on people ; the characters,
Italian Americans, are shown as being at ease living in Sicily  and Italy as much as in the
USA,  equally patriotic and relaxed  in both lands, with professional contacts  on
both continents, for business purposes.

Aiello is notable in his portrayal of the Don, who is  a deep philosophical thinker, having no
no guilt or remorse for past actions based on direct knowledge of the injustices and poverty
experienced in Sicily, from the government and from the entrenched Establishment there against
the common  man, who, ""in God's world, a prison, must earn his daily bread in face of others who
are merely carnivores, giving no mercy"".

A rapport is built with viewers, by laying out a system of human values, discipline, a conduct
that is imposed on and followed by members of the organization, showing its hierarchy, and a bit how
one joins it and progresses from being a soldier in an enclave, to making your bones, being a made man, etc.

Known issues with society are shown, such as confidential informants, double agents, corrupt law defectives,
payoffs to Senators, with the ""quid pro quo"" as a modus operandi, as the mob being  called upon
to right injustices, as a vigilante vs unpunished individuals  having beat the justice system, etc.

There is a parallel with Puzo's earlier work, in that the most successful and talented capo is
the one who was first financially successful outside of the organization, not having wanted originally
to belong to it,  balancing other goals outside of it, and leading his own life, etc

Viewer reactons may vary in face of the wisdom given in the narrative, suggesting love is unreliable
as compared to  gratitude, obedience and harmony...""She's dangerous...from being too skilled in bed.""

A cynical comment is made of CEO, some of whom  are weak from the need  for eroticism, and in turn,
easily manipulated by personal relationships of colaborators.

A mention is made of the witness protection program, the RICO laws,  how informants can rebuild their lives
after serving as a stool to the FBI not without repercussions since, as Aiello shows, stools are
not tolerated, immediately ordering a hit.

The violence is modest in this movie, in terms of rubouts; the code words being preferred in face of
wiretaps and bugs such as confirmation or communion.

The tourism attractions of Las Vegas and Nevada is spectacularly shown.

In the Puzo tradition, fundamental life-altering events are also shown, such as  marriage , birth , death ,

918164,4,6304561717,"TV movies are inherently awful, it's like an iron-clad rule.  This one is a cut above the rest, and it was quite popular back in 1997, especially for the morbidly curious.

Now, in this post-Sopranos age, it's still quite funny.  Puzo just went for broke with his source novel, another attempt to write about his fairy-tale Mafia.

The Last Don is the story about...the last Don, Don Clericuzio (for some reason, even the name is funny), a truly old-school Don who, while a thief and a murderer, is also a quasi-philosopher, loving father, and a venerable man of wisdom, his years of experience extorting, racketeering, and ordering the deaths of men having given him great insight into the human condition.

This is an 'epic', which means it had to be shown over two or three or however many nights it was, to tell the story of the Don's 'family', his troubled nieces and sons and all of their issues.  Basically, the Don has some ridiculous stake in Las Vegas (since apparently, Puzo never watched Casino) and his son, or nephew, I forget, a guy named Crucifixio (is this even a name?) runs the...I forget which casino.  Then there's this son, or heir, Dante, who wears renaissance hats that wouldn't be out of place in a Slick Rick video, who is just a bad guy and who you know will ruin the family.

There's a whole subplot about Hollywood, too, and the various degenerates and lowlifes who are found in the film industry.  Cross falls for Athena, blah blah blah, there's a scummy agent, there's a bitter old writer (basically a Puzo-esque character), and some other bad people who get shot, etc.  Easily one of the best characters is Lia Vazi, or Vazzi, who is from Sicily, and therefore 'the real deal', a stone killer proficient in all manner of execution.  He's a good character.  I was glad they brought him back in The Last Don II.

And of course, we have Danny Aiello, who has this amazingly bad aging makeup at the end which is hilarious and reason enough to watch this rather entertaining made-for-TV business.  Of course, the ending 'suggests' that the don dies peacefully in his sleep (apparently, nobody in this family has been indicted or is in Federal prison, and the FBI is typically incompetent).  Of course, when The Last Don II opens, and yes, I'll spoil it for you, the Don is still alive long enough to discuss how his old-school wife used to knit his own shirts(!), etc, etc.

It's completely fairy tale Mafia stuff, almost as if Puzo wished the Mafia were like this.  Will offer no insight into the real world of organized crime, and compared with something well-written and realistic like The Sopranos, The Last Don is simply Cheez-Whiz for a slow night.  But with this ridiculously cheap DVD, at least you won't have to watch commercials, too.

Just a tremendous effort by Aiello, Daryl Hannah, that Sicilian guy, Jason Gedrick, Joe Mantegna, and Kirstie Ally, who cries a lot, etc.  I have faith that a Last Don III will appear one of these days...",1136505600,7,2977,4.6558317399617595

I would rather watch ""the Godfather part III"", ok no I wouldn't this movie is really not that bad, but its close. If I had not been such a big fan of the book I would have more then likely skipped watching this. I HIGHLY ADVICE READING THE BOOK FIRST IT REALLY DOES RIVAL ""THE GODFATER"". This fits the text of the book great, but the actors were very wrongfully cast in my opinion. I pictured the Don as more carasmatic, Pippi as more of a brut, Big Tim a little less big, Boz more of an athelet, Athena alittle less man-ish, Georgio with a bit more of a leaders personality instead of a book worms, and Donte a bit shorter, for someone who was said to wear his hats to make him look taller in some scenes you can see the hes taller then alot of the cast.

While ""The Godfather"" tended to glorify the mafia, at least in Part 1, this film really doesn't.  In fact, the basic theme of the story is that the patriarch Don is trying to remove his family from the world of the mafia, to safely enter the legitimate world, with the family wealth intact.  While The Godfather more or less focused on the mafia from roughly 1930-1960, this story deals with the modern mafia of the 1990s and beyond.  As always when writing about the mafia, Puzo tells a great story.
This is a really interesting storyline, told more or less from the standpoint of the wise old mafia Don.  The characters are very true-to-life and engaging.  The storyline moves along briskly, with many interesting twists and turns.  The acting is mostly pretty good.  Overall, this is a really engaging miniseries that is great entertainment.  One interesting twist is the film's portrayal of the movie business, which it portrays as being every bit as ruthless as the mafia.

  Well, I don't want to say it is bad, but I guess all those who have read the book first might have been disappointed by this movie. The biggest mistake: the Santadio massacre scene should have been put at the end of the movie, as it is in the novel. Instead, having put it in the opening scene, everything becomes easier to anticipate and the movie loses a lot of intensity and verve. Don't even compare it to any of the three Godfathers. There's absolutely no track of the Godfather here: no sign of Pacino, de Niro, Duvall, Caan, not to talk about Brando.

Either that, or they would give THE GODFATHER PART 3 five stars!  Danny Aiello sleepwalks  through his part.  Joe Mantagna is inconsistent from scene to scene.  The  movie as a whole is extremely inconsistent, but it doesn't matter, because  the people who saw it as a mini-series were seeing blaring ads intersperced  throughout and were watching it over several nights (or even missing a  night in between, without noticing anything missing!)  A miniseries on TV  is a hit if every seven-minute episode packs a punch, and this one does,  except that if you remember the earlier punches, the later ones fizzle out.  For example, Aiello doesn't mind if his own mob kills his own daughter,  even though she posed no threat to him (it turns out she wasn't shot  because Mantegna has one of his inconsistent changes of heart).  But when  it comes to Aiello's grandson, who Aiello knows is posing a lethal threat  to the entire family, Aiello can't bring himself to order the hit, because  ""well, he's my grandson.""  Great sir, but what about your  daughter?  The interesting thing here is that it doesn't matter to those  who saw the show on TV; they will have forgotten the beginning by the time  of the end.  But if you see it all at once, as I did, then you'll have  these problems.  I do want to say that the movie has its entertainment  value if you suspend disbelief in the characters and the plot.
