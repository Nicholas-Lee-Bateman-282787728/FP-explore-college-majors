4055014,4,B00325YVWS,I didn't think I'd like this documentary but there it so fascinating fact reveled and the really enjoyed what I learned.,1374624000,2,120,4.761904761904762
4055015,5,B00325YVWS,"I'll be honest, I purchased this based on reviews, and I now agree with every positive review.  The DVD itself has a hint of cheapness - for example, it is an hour long and has no chapters at all, the sound balancing for the music is a tad off, and the DVD audio as a whole seems to be much louder than normal (just turn your TV down a bit to compensate and it's 100% normal) just little things like that, however the program itself is very good.  Personal interviews, archived footage, etc - all of which more than make up for the tiny formatting complaints mentioned earlier.  I am very happy with the purchase.",1335312000,10,613,4.3130434782608695
4055016,5,B00325YVWS,"If a person is into the "" Fitzgerald "" sinking I believe this DVD documentary will be a worthwhile investment. Not so much as a minute by minute record of the "" Fitz "" sinking slowly from approx 15:00 hrs onward but there is worthwhile knowledge of the boat to be had with some interesting interviews from men that built her to men that sailed on her.
Even the actual radio transmissions of Capt. Bernie Cooper conversing with the Coast Guard after she disappeared , presumed lost. Also included was the mention of the mystery body that lies beside the forward end on the bottom. The retired investigator that in other interviews seemed in my view to blame the crew on the faulty hatch cover issue has this time around changed his view leaning away from crew negligence. Some very interesting points are brought up by all those interviewed. I think the more a person rehashes this DVD the more they'll learn , I think it's a good addition for those who are interested in the tragedy to compliment their other books , tapes, DVD's , etc. It has a few surprises from people who are in the know ,
enjoyed it ! 5 STARS.",1320537600,12,1115,4.443902439024391
4055017,5,B00325YVWS,"Ric Mixter is a Great Lakes shipwreck researcher, and in ""The Edmund Fitzgerald Investigations"" has produced an excellent documentary on the history of the ""Fitzgerald"" from design, through construction, operation, and ultimately, of course, her sinking. To me the amazing thing about this DVD is the amount of motion picture film that Mixter uncovered of the ""Fitzgerald"". I was especially interested in her modular construction, and found the details of the boiler installations fascinating in particular. There is no doubt that the ""Fitzgerald"" was an impressive freighter, and the DVD really brings her to life, although footage of the bridge would have been welcomed.

Mixter details the multiple investigations into the accident and their varying conclusions, interviewing people on all sides of the issue with fairness and respect. Although Mixter doesn't offer a definitive conclusion about the cause of the sinking, he does allow the chief proponents of each to clearly state their case. The interviews with Great Lakes sailors, and especially former ""Fitzgerald"" crewmembers are very enlightening, as are the interviews with shipyard workers who built and launched the ""Fitzgerald"".

The documentary reports on all the expeditions to the ""Fitzgerald"", with some truly amazing underwater photography of the wreck. Mixter also details the memorials and museum displays dedicated to the lives of the 29 men who died in one of the worst storms in Great Lakes history, while setting it in the context of the crew being 29 of an estimated 30,000 sailors to have perished on the Great Lakes.

This is a special ""50th Anniversary Edition"" (so designated because it was updated for the 50th anniversary of the ""Fitzgerald"" being launched), that has loads of additional footage and extras. These are particularly strong, showing details about all the expeditions to the ""Fitzgerald"" and the submersibles involved, the bell recovery and preservation effort, the memorials, a five minute piece filmed on a modern Great Lakes freighter showing what onboard life is like (and interviewing the freighter's Captain, whose first Third Mate job was on the ""Fitzgerald""), and previews from other Mixter documentaries.

This is a great DVD for anyone interested in the ""Edmund Fitzgerald"", Great Lakes shipwrecks, or maritime engineering and failures. This documentary does what it set out to do, it both educates and entertains: I learned a lot about the ""Fitzgerald"" and Great Lakes freighters in general, and I was captivated by the footage that Ric Mixter uncovered and edited together so skillfully: I certainly look forward to future Mixter efforts.",1280275200,33,2645,5.381642512077295
4055018,4,B00325YVWS,"The original one had better music. But it isn't too bad. Ric kinda talks like Microsoft Sam, it's annoying. But informative for anyone who doesn't know much about her and wants to know more.",1438041600,,190,4.617647058823529

4055025,5,B00325YVWS,"I bought this video for my husband, the ultimate Great Lakes shipwreck nerd, based on appreciation of Ric Mixter's other efforts seen on TV and at programs. We've been diving at Whitefish Point for decades and thought we couldn't add to our familiarity with the Fitz and everything associated with it, but found this video fascinating: well-organized detail from the construction through the years of investigation following the loss of the vessel, all while capturing the gripping drama of the central tragedy. I'm looking forward to seeing it again with my dad, and expect to find more to appreciate. A must for anyone who appreciates real-life drama on the seas and the detective work that goes into unraveling the cause of a tragedy.",1422057600,4,737,5.0
4055026,3,B00325YVWS,"bought it for an education unit for teens, but it's rather boring. Goes into way too much detail (for that purpose) on the making and structure of the s***, less so on the aftermath and why it is so famous and such an intriguing story. I lost nearly all of the kids in 15 minutes",1420329600,2,279,4.090909090909091

8387344,5,B00325YVWS,I've been interested the Edmund Fitzgerald since the first time I heard Gordon Lightfoot's song.  A good addition to my Fitz library.,1477526400,,133,5.045454545454546

8387348,4,B00325YVWS,Product delivered in great time.. as promised.,1457654400,,46,5.714285714285714
8387349,2,B00325YVWS,This wasn't what I expected it to be.  Drug on and was so general about the whole incident that it was almost vague.  I thought this program would get into the aftermath and be in depth but it didn't.  Production value was low quality; it's already in the giveaway box.  Read any of the books on the Fitz and you'll get more information than this program. Just my opinion,1451260800,,371,4.333333333333333
