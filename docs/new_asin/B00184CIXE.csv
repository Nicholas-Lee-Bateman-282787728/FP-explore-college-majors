8268388,5,B00184CIXE,Carrie Ann Inaba hosts a series of 15 vignettes around Tokyo describing contemporary Japanese pop culture.  These range from the expected - Akihabara and Harajuku- to the more obscure underground art scene to the just plain bizarre prison- or church-themed restaurants.  Each of the stories is short - 3 to 5 minutes.  So this documentary is quickly moving around and almost never lags.  It delivers an off-beat and entertaining view of Tokyo.,1310342400,,443,5.111111111111111

8268391,5,B00184CIXE,"If you want a more fun approach to popular hangout spots, a step into the anime and manga scene and some of the trends of Japanese fashion, then definitely give Tokyology a look.  Tokyology not only introduces viewers to modern Japanese culture, it also gives insight into the popularity of fashions, places and trends from the people who are living it without a hint of creepiness and plays up the fun factor, whether it's being an otaku at a convention or visiting a hair salon at 3 o'clock in the morning.",1224547200,,508,4.582417582417582
8268392,3,B00184CIXE,"This DVD was, for the most part, interesting. There are about 15 segments included which range from a few to ten minutes in length. There are scenes showing more parts of Tokyo, but this DVD focuses mostly on Shibuya, Akihabara, and Roppongi.

I enjoyed learning about the stranger places in Tokyo in which this feature focuses on, though I'm not sure I myself would visit them. There is also a lot of different visual styles looked upon including gothic, lolita, decora, oshare, and visual kei.

The reason I didn't give this five stars (and I'm still unsure with even 3) is because of the host of the show, Carrie Ann Inaba. After finishing the DVD, I gathered she's a bimbo from LA and was given the opportunity to go to Japan and act crazy because she has japanese in her. While I thought she might know a good amount of japanese, I found she just has a translator for the most part and will just act obnoxious around the people in Tokyo. She appeared to know less about Japan today than most likely someone who would purchase this DVD. I was truly annoyed with her way of hosting and I only continued to watch so that I could learn more about Japan's pop-culture, not to mention it was a bit dated for some reason (about 2 years).

I'd comment on the extras but I couldn't bring myself to watch the outtakes for I felt awkward enough.",1218499200,,1339,4.434959349593496
