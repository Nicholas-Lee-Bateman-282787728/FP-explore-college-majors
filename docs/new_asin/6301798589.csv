369986,5,6301798589,"Bernhard Wicki's film of high seas suspense in a world of espionage during WWII.  A very tight script and good direction compensated by the amazing talents of Brynner and Brando.

The film focuses on the character of Marlon Brando who plays a wealthy German who had escaped from Germany to settle in India. Brando is the epidemy of self interest and doesn't care who wins the war.  British intelligence approaches him and orders him to board a German merchant vessel leaving Tokyo Harbor for Strasbourg France with a cargo of rubber for the war effort. The Allies are also short on rubber and so coerce Brando to seize the ship under the threat of deporting him back to Germany where he would probably be shot as a traitor.  Under such duress, Brando accepts the assignment and begins to demolish the explosives that are intended to scuttle the ship should it be captured or impaired. Brynner is the ship's commander and is an apolitical character.  Although old fashioned in terms of patriotism, Brynner's character has no love for Hitler or the party unlike his 1st mate. Brando uses his cover as an SS officer to manipulate the first mate.  At the same time, Brando uses his real identity to persuade the prisoner crew to mutiny and come with him to meet the Allied ships waiting for them.  Things go terribly wrong however as the ship deviates from its expected course and Brando's cover is blown.  What follows is a high suspense story of courage and determination.

This is a great film with lots of character development and suspense. The performances of Brando and Brynner are simply outstanding.  This is a great film to own.",1126224000,17,1634,4.742049469964664
369987,3,6301798589,"The Morituri is a good movie. Brando and Brinner are outstanding and Wicki does his job honestly. Underneath the action there is room for some serious meditation. The Morituri is not just a war movie or a spy story. It's a story that deals with a basic question: are wars all idiotic, like Brando says? Men, women and children are slaughetered and then enemies become friends and friends become enemies... No, beyond his personal belief, even Kyle (Brando), this nihilist selfish man, finds that if good men do nothing then the triumph of evil is possible. This is the main lesson The Morituri teaches. The rest, even the personal drama of Brinner, a captain once devoted to his Fatherland with a nazi-fanatic son who earns an  iron cross sinking an hospital boat, is just complementary. I read the plot is complicated. I don't agree with that. I prefer to stress the quality of the dialogues, the cinematography and the acting of this superb pair of stars. The dvd offers a good picture with minor faults (some scenes deserve some remastering). The lack of extras and the flatness of the audio are not offensive...  If you like WWII movies, Brando and Brinner, you won't be disappointed.",1122768000,3,1188,4.790243902439024
369988,4,6301798589,"This movie came out amid a spate of World War II remembrance movies in the early 60s, I think, and by then people were getting tired of the genre. That's a pity, because this is a really remarkable piece of work. There are parts of it that seem almost directed by Orson Welles, particularly the extraordinary camerawork below decks as Brando tries to defuse the bombs that would sink the ship. The script is one of the most searchingly intelligent you'll ever come across, and the whole thing explores the theme of loyalty and lying and expediency with a brilliance you just don't see in movies anymore. It's like Kafka at sea. There are splendid scenes where Brando, using an exaggerated German accent, makes himself into an SS agent, then has to backtrack to present himself in another role to Yul Brynner (who is also excellent in this film) like an instant chameleon. Then he has to act another way for the crew. Then he has to act another way for the woman. Then he has to act another way for the German officers. I've never seen Brando do better. There is a sort of hall-of-mirrors strangeness and refined characterization in this film that makes it quite unique. The DVD presentation is crystalline and the play of shadows and light over the decks and underdecks is quite astonishing. Jerry Goldsmith, who must have been very, very young when he did this, did the score. It reminds me strongly of ""The Third Man,"" with virtual zither-like effects. I don't want to make this sound too academic and hypercritical, but this odd little movie is one of the smartest, most intelligent, artistic things I have seen in a long while. It makes all the John Wayne movies about Marines taking beaches and saving China from the Chinese, look very, very stupid. Exquisitely written, exquisitely acted, exquisitely filmed. This is the best movie you never saw.",1115510400,68,1852,4.7368421052631575
369989,4,6301798589,"MAD magazine once compared movies made after the war with movies made during the war. This is DEFINITELY one made after the war. Somewhat sympathetic toward our German hosts, Brando as an SS officer but in reality a hired spy for the Allies and Yule Brenner in one of his best roles as a Captain for the German Merchant marine now unsure of his countries policy and beliefs. Improbable but interestingly written, the plot surrounds a vital shipment of Rubber bound for the Axis powers. Brando is blackmailed into stopping it by not allowing it to fall into enemy hands. He has a toxic relationship with Brenner, a Captain with a reputation for being drunk on duty. He frequently mocks Nazi ideals and is disappointed in his son, a Nazi sub officer who sinks hospital ships for a living. He even tries to hide a Jewish woman from the usual crew of fanatics on board in a ""good samaritan"" sequence which never would have appeared in a war period picture. Filmed in appropriate and errie Black & White, it features an excellent supporting cast and Brando in a very interesting role. Well worth it, off the beaten path of the usual war picture and shows imperfections on all sides. The Title is based on the salute of Gladiators in ancient Rome about to die in the arena.",1104364800,4,1267,4.58590308370044
369990,4,6301798589,"It's thought by many that Marlon Brando was probably one of the greatest actors to grace the silver screen, if not one of the weirdest (at least later in his life).  Based on that alone (his acting, not his weirdness), I purchased Morituri (1965), having heard little to nothing about the film.  The fact it also stars Yul Brynner didn't hurt either.  Regardless, I am glad I picked this one up, as it's really quite good.

The title, as far as I can tell, is Latin meaning `for those about to die', which seems apt after watching the film.  Directed by Bernhard Wicki, someone I've never heard of, probably because he was an Austrian who mainly directed German films, the film stars Marlon Brando and Yul Brynner.  Also appearing are Janet Margolin (Nevada Smith), Trevor Howard (The Third Man), and a German actor I've never heard of named Martin Benrath who I thought was quite good.

The film, set during WWII, begins with German Captain Rolf Mueller being given charge of a cargo ship, leaving Japan and destined for occupied France, one that contains critical raw materials, mainly rubber, important for Germany's war effort.  He's none too happy with his assignment, as some of the crew is made up of undesirables and political prisoners destined to be tried upon arrival (I would guess they wouldn't be to eager to reach their destination).  The Allied forces, on learning of the contents of the ship, approach Robert Crain, a German demolitions expert and ex-patriot hiding in English ruled India, for the purpose of getting him on the ship, not to blow up the ship, but to disarm the scuttle charges (apparently German ships contained explosives so that if they were to get captured, the captain was to detonate the explosives and `scuttle', or sink, the vessel to keep it out of enemy hands).  The Allies want the contents of the ship, not only to hinder Germany's war efforts, but also to assist their own.  With assistance, Crain does get aboard the ship, under the guise of an SS security officer named Hans Kyle.  Members of the SS, it seems, were not entirely popular by any one's account, especially not by other Germans (think the police and their dislike for their own internal affairs division).  This creates complications for Crain/Kyle, as he must secretly search the ship for an unknown number of explosive charges, disarm them, within a certain amount of time, all while keeping the captain and the crew `in the dark'.  Not only that, but the ship is forced to take on a group of American prisoners for transport.  Things are getting hairier by the minute...

Most of the film takes place on a cargo ship, providing for a very claustrophobic, tense atmosphere throughout.  Brando plays his role in a very subdued manner, but it works well.  I thought his German accent a bit odd, not entirely bad, just odd, but I got used to it, especially since the movie runs about two hours.  Not only did Brando have the acting chops to pull off his character, but he also had the physique, as he had to run, climb, swing and crawl to get around the ship to disable the explosive charges.  He seemed very within character, especially the parts when his character discussed his feelings against against war in general.  Brynner was also very good as a non-party German, who, while maybe not believing in his leaders political motives, wasn't a traitor either.  I really liked the diverse complexity, including compassion and kindness, of his character, the sailor committed to his duties, forced to captain this particular ship with a questionable crew.  There was a great deal of character development throughout, which served well to really display the differences among the German people in general with regards to their feelings and loyalties towards their leadership and/or their country.  I thought the direction of the film to be really good, as the camera always seemed position in such a way to capture the best possible point of view for that particular scene.  The story moved along well, although some will say it was too slow, but I didn't think so...I found myself pretty much glued to the screen, enjoying all aspects of the movie.  One of my favorite scenes was when Crain/Kyle is confronted in closed quarters by two German officers from the submarine, which delivered the American prisoners.  His ability to play on their own sense of paranoia as they questioned him about his reason for being on the ship was very intelligent and interesting to watch.  The plot is complicated, but if you can watch with no distractions, you should be able to follow it along well.

The anamorphic wide screen picture on this DVD looks pretty good, but I did feel it could have been cleaned up a little.  There were some very minor flaws visible every once in awhile, but the main thing I noticed was the `softness' in the black parts when scenes were heavily shadowed.  It's kind of hard to explain, but a bit more noticeable than the other flaws.  As far as special features go, there's a teaser trailer for the film (I'm unsure who made this, but after watching the movie, I felt the person who did make it had no idea or even a sense of what the film was about, as it presented something other than what the movie was, at least I felt), and original theatrical trailer, and trailers for some other, older Fox war films like Crash Dive (1943), The Hunters (1958), and What Price Glory (1952).  All in all, I thought Morituri was very decent, well made film rich with characters and a complex plot that rewards those with the patience to enjoy the more sophisticated side of films (I'm not trying to be snobby here, but I do feel this film hasn't gotten the attention it deserves, unduly so).

369991,3,6301798589,"I just happened across this movie off the Satellite. So I decided to buy it because I found it a pretty fair WWII movie. Marlon was using his ""Young Lions"" German accent. Yul Brenner was the ships captain. Subversion of the Third Reich working aboard ship. Failed mutiny but lots of acting and developemnt of characters. Not just blowing up ships. Not a great movie but holds your interest and entertaining if you like Brando and Brenner (I do!)",1092873600,,445,4.6455696202531644
369992,3,6301798589,"The first time I watched this film, I must admit that I fell asleep during it. But over time, after viewing it several times, I found that it was not as bad as I initially thought. In fact it was somewhat entertaining.  Some parts of the film are indeed gripping, but for the most part the film is slow-paced.  Brando gives a captivating performance, considering what he has to work with, as a saboteur sent to disarm explosives on a ship traveling from Japan to Germany. But I believe top honors go to Yul Brynner in his performance as a grouchy, no nonsense sea captain, who seems more concerned with lighting up a cigar than anything else. Brynner provides a nice and interesting contrast to Brando's cool, slick and self-contained character. And not to be overlooked, actress Janet Margolin, gives a powerful performance as a Jewish refugee that makes the ultimate sacrifice to aid in the effort of disarmimg the ship, her performance alone deserves a star. Overall, I recommend this film with reservations. If you're looking for a faced paced edge of your seat thriller, look elsewhere. But if you're just looking for a decent 1960's Brando film that gets better over repeated viewings then you've come to the right place.",1091664000,10,1227,4.783018867924528
369993,4,6301798589,"Marlon Brando plays a German deserter and ex-patriot living in British occupied India unwillingly drawn into a war he doesn't believe in.

The hardnosed Captain (Yul Brynner) has Allied prisoners and a concentration camp survivor (Janet Margolin)that he's ferrying from Japan to German. More importantly, his precious cargo is desperately needed to fuel the war effort in Germany.
Fox has done a great job transferring this fine film to DVD. The widescreen presentation and rich Deluxe vividly come to life with remarkable clarity and sharpness. While a couple of sequences look a bit soft, on the whole, the transfer is remarkably accurate and rich.

370141,2,6301798589,"I count this seemingly very promising 1965 war film as one of my most disappointing viewings EVER. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

1. Historical background

This is I believe the only war film that was ever made which action takes place on board of a WWII German blockade-runner. Such ships really existed - most of them were large, fast and modern cargo ships which travelled initially from Germany itself and later from occupied France to Japan or Japanese occupied territories in the Pacific. Between 1939 and 1943 they would bring to Japanese precious plane engines, high tech tools, electronics and optic instruments (like targeting devices for bombers) and then return with a cargo of precious materials such as rubber, tungsten, tin, vegetal oils, silk and quinine. Many of those ships were intercepted and were either sunk or scuttled by their crews, but many others went through the blockade. With allied navies and air forces growing in numbers and using a better technology, blockade runners had to stop their missions in spring 1944 - before that however they contributed a lot to the war effort of both Germany and Japan.

2. The film

""Morituri"" was directed by Bernhard Wicki, a German actor and director who previously made the very famous German war drama ""Bridge"" as well as a highly praised Hollywoodian drama ""The visit"" starring Anthony Quinn and Ingrid Bergman - he also turned German sequences in ""The Longest Day"". Wicki was also a communist in his youth and for that reason spend some ""quality time"" in a Nazi concentration camp during WWII - therefore his hatred of Nazis was very personal... There is no doubt that he was a very talented director - but in this film he seemingly completely lost control over his work and as result virtually nothing in the whole story makes the slightest sense.

The film begins with a German citizen, a certain Robert Crain (Marlon Brando), who escaped from Germany after Hitler came to power and went as far as India, where he tries to live a normal, undistinguished and somehow reclusive life, waiting for the war to end. He is however found out by British Intelligence section in India and its commander, Colonel Statter (Trevor Howard) forces him to cooperate in a secret operation. He is supposed to:

- assume the identity of a SS officer (no SS ever travelled on blockade runners, which were manned by Kriegsmarine personnel)

- somehow travel from British India to Japan (probably by teleporting, because such a trip was simply impossible during war)

- secure a place on board of German blockade-runner S/S ""Ingo"", an old cargo ship surprised by the beginning of war in Japan, which is being prepared in the greatest secret in Kobe to attempt a run to occupied France (God only knows how is it done)

- locate demolition charges which were supposed to sink the ship if it was intercepted

- disable those demolition charges, without getting caught, but only once he is certain that the ship will be intercepted in the next few hours

- be rescued once the ship is boarded and captured by allies

The purpose of this mission is to seize the ship and its cargo of rubber as seemingly it is greatly needed by Great Britain, which is ludicrous - allies mercilessly hunted and destroyed German blockade-runners, but never had any need to seize their cargo.

The whole ""go from India to Japan and get on board of enemy ultra-secret blockade runner"" thing takes like one minute and the details of this mighty exploit are never explained. Then we meet captain Mueller (Yul Brynner) an alcoholic with a poor pre-war record who by some miracle just received the command of this secret, arch-sensible mission... And then we meet the crew of this important blockade-runner, composed of various misfits, malcontents and society rejects, most of whom are anti-Nazi...

Now all of this covers just the first minutes of the film and all absurdities enumerated above could be easily forgiven, if the great and hazardous voyage of the blockade runner was shown well, as a tense, dramatic adventure. Well, it is definitely NOT the case. Instead, once we are at sea, director and scenario writer kept adding new absurdities - such as the blockade runner, which in real life would rely on stealth as its only weapon, maintains regular radio contact with Japan, Germany and numerous Japanese and German submarines, SCREAMING to allied SIGINT (Signal Intelligence) ""I am here!"".

More characters are then added when the ship is still going through Indian Ocean. A German admiral (!), no less, comes a-visiting as well as some sailors from a sunk allied cargo ship and Esther (Janet Margolin, mostly remembered for being Woody Allen's partner in ""Take the money and run""), a very attractive civilian female passenger who travelled on the latter. Quite obviously for a woman named Esther it is a VERY dangerous and potentially deadly thing to land on board of a warship flying the III Reich flag...

3. My impressions - with SPOILERS

The whole scenario is just an accumulation of nonsense, bordering on ridiculous and completely wasting the talent of four good actors (Marlon Brando, Yul Brynner, Trevor Howard and Janet Margolin). The character of Esther is particularly abused, in every possible aspect of this term. We are told that at one moment this woman escaped from Nazi Germany after being, amongst others, sexually abused by the Gestapo interrogators. Then she offers her favours to ALL allied sailors imprisoned on the board off the blockade runner to incite them to mutiny... This is a very shocking, very unpleasant and completely useless development. I really cannot understand why the director needed such a thing in his film.

Be also advised that even if it is in principle a war film, there is no war scenes of any kind - in fact, with just a minimum effort it could be a theatre piece. Which could be actually a good thing, if dialogs were good. Which they are not.

The film doesn't have a real ending but it still was my most favourite moment, as it meant that this nightmare is finally over...

CONCLUSION: this is a bad, very disappointing film, which very deservedly bombed at box office notwithstanding the excellent cast. Very naively the producers thought that it was because of the title, which the public supposedly couldn't understand, so this film was quickly renamed when still in theatres and became ""Saboteur: code name ""Morturi"", but of course without any result.

370154,4,6301798589,"This film was made less than twenty years later WWII and Hollywood was still painting the Nazis as soulless lock-step automatons bent on conquering the world. This is a departure from that mind set.

Here's the scoop. The British have tracked down Marlon Brando in India. He is a German who has fled Germany because he doesn't believe in war in general and Hitler's policies in particular. The Brits want him on a German ship transporting raw rubber. The Germans will scuttle said ship if they're seized, so Brando needs to disengage all the charges because the Allies need the rubber as much as do the Germans. Problems arise in that some of the crew are German political prisoners and even the captain (Yul Brynner) has some questionable baggage.

This is a well written, well acted film of its time. It's presented in a straightforward time line with bits of the story entering the fold at regular intervals. What is happening here is that all of the Germans aren't Nazis and Brando tries to use this to his advantage. The captain himself has some reservations about his position. He has a black mark on his record in that a previous ship he captained was torpedoed while he was less than sober and the party has since put his son (also a captain) in harm's way in the North Atlantic. This humanizing of the Germans must have been cutting edge at the time.

This is filmed in glorious black and white with some neat deep focus shots and some really cool crane shots. The format is pedestrian but not out of touch with its time. All the leads do a good job. Brando is his usual great self and this seems an odd project for him given the rest of his history. The arc of his character is cool in how he feels he cannot watch events unfold from a distance. Jerry Goldsmith handled the music and this had to have been better than a lot of the scores of its day.

There are a lot of great films dealing with the events of that war. This might not be the best but it's one of the more important.",1361404800,,1991,4.4021739130434785

Marlon Brando (a refugee from Nazi Germany) is blackmailed to sabotage a German Cargo Ship (captained by Yul Brynner) which is carrying enough rubber to keep the war going for another few months. Disguised as a SS Officer, Brando slowly begins to realize that this may be a suicide mission, and must make a choice which could ultimately change his life.
Apart from the unique and original story, the cinematography (shot by the legend, Conrad Hall) will keep you mystified through the entire film. Trick photography and absolutely stunning ""one-take"" shots, leave the audience in awe. This type of photography is unheard of for this time, especially the films use of Black and White, in an age of color.

The ship is on a sucide mission and Brando has been given a suicide mission within that suicide mission by the British. They try to give events some sort of a moral context, but it doesn't fully work. But the casting and the quality of the actors involved is A+.

370160,4,6301798589,"I remember enjoying this film in the movie theater as a kid.  So I purchased it on DVD and watched it last night.  It was an excellent film and surprisingly, little remembered despite starring 2 screen legends like Marlon Brando and Yul Brynner. The premise of this black and white film is that a German diserter living in India (Brando)  is blackmailed by a British army Major (Trevor Howard) into getting aboard a German freighter carrying tons of rubber to the German military in France.  Brando's job is to disable the freighter, but prevent the Germans from scuttling her.  She will then be captured by the American Navy and the allies will get the all-important rubber.  (It is interesting to note that the last time Brando and Trevor Howard worked together was in the 1962 remake of ""Mutiny on the Bounty.""  Brando's obnoxious behavior on that film was legendary and when the budget zoomed out of control, he got much of the blame.  Apparently Howard had very little use for him after that film.  Now they were briefly working together 3 years later on a film about another ship that eventually culminates into another mutiny.  I wonder if they got along better this time.)
Brando is absolutely great as the foppish German forced into this mission and Yul Brynner is as good as the anti-Hitler German commanding the ship.  The mostly German supporting cast is excellent, especially Janet Margolin as a young female Jewish prisoner caught up in the plot.  My only possible criticism is that Brando becomes a superspy a little too quick, disabling explosive charges, posing as a Gestapo agent and climbing all over the side of the ship during the explosive climax.  There is no indication at all that he has any experience in this area and should be able to do any of these things.  As a matter of fact, when we first meet him he appears to be an effete, foppish snob.
This film was a failure at the box-office when released in 1965, it was one of the many big-budget flops that almost put 20th. Century Fox out of business.  Perhaps it was the confusing title which was later changed to ""The Saboteur-Code Name:Morituri (really a not much better title.)Perhap it should have been made in color.  Brando was in the period of making one flop after another when he made this one.  He would not hit the big time again until ""The G-dfather"" and ""Last Tango in Paris"" in 1971.  There are little extras on the DVD except the trailers for this film and 3 other trailers for largely-forgotten Fox war films.
Still this is a suspenseful and exciting film with outstanding performances from Brando and Brynner.  And while largely forgotten today, you could do a lot worse than check it out.",1265500800,2,2685,4.686567164179104
370161,4,6301798589,"Morituri is an underrated WWII thriller that is anything but your typical war movie.  Living in India in 1942, German defector Robert Crain is living the life of luxury until he is blackmailed by British Intelligence into undertaking a dangerous mission.  Posing as an SS officer, Crain will board a German blockade runner in Tokyo that is carrying 7,000 tons of rubber destined for the war effort.  An engineer in his army days, Crain must defuse all the explosives that will be used to scuttle the ship in case of a run-in with Allied ships.  Then, when the ship cannot be destroyed, the ship will float right into an Allied ambush. But right away, the ship's captain is suspicious of his new passenger.  Can Crain complete his mission before anyone catches on?  Filmed in black and white which adds to the tension in a way, Morituri is an excellent movie that has never received much recognition.  The drama is exciting from beginning to end, aided by Jerry Goldsmith's score, somewhat similar to his Von Ryan's Express music.  Definitely give this movie a try.

  In the lead role, Marlon Brando gives a very strong performance as Robert Crain, a German defector blackmailed into completing a suicidal mission for British Intelligence.  Crain doesn't believe in war, no matter what the cause or end result, and only works so hard to complete the mission to increase his odds of surviving.  Yul Brynner is equally good as Captain Mueller, the German captain of the ship suspicious of Crain's actual motives.  Mueller is loyal to a cause that he doesn't truly believe in, a true soldier/sailor who follows his orders no matter what.  Trevor Howard has a brief but good appearance as Colonel Statter, the Intelligence officer who confronts Crain in India.  War movie buffs will surely appreciate Hans Christian Blech's part as Donkeyman, a great supporting role of a political prisoner forced to join the ship's crew.  Some of the rest of the supporting cast includes Janet Margolin, Martin Benrath, Wally Cox, Max Haufler, Rainer Penkert, and Oscar Beregi Jr.

  The DVD is a good purchase overall with a good-looking widescreen presentation in its original black and white format.  Special features include two trailers, one short teaser and one regular theatrical trailer, along with three trailers for three somewhat similar war movies from Fox Flix.  Not often talked about with WWII movies, Morituri has slipped through the cracks somehow, but don't miss this movie with great performances from Brando and Brynner, check out Morituri!",1224288000,2,2541,5.0

A rag tag crew has been assigned to sail with him. The ship is a blockade runner meaning that they will try to make it through any enemy defenses and if it looks it will not make it, the Captain is required to blow up the ship. In India, a German citizen (Brando) who escaped Germany when the war began is being blackmailed by Allied forces to pose as a German SS officer assigned to duty on that ship. His mission is to defuse all the bombs set to destroy the ship so that when the Americans capture the ship, it will not blow up the precious cargo. Brynner smells a rat and keeps a short leash on Brando and a tense game of cat and mouse develops as Brando tries to find and defuse all 12 bombs. The mission becomes more complicated when a German Admiral brings a group of American prisoners on board who have been captured by a sub in the area. The Admiral wonders why a SS officer is aboard a cargo ship and decides to investigate. A lesser known film of both Brando and Brynner but a good WWII film. Not an action film but a battle of wits between two megastars. While you may not like the black & white, it's what gives it the mystery and intrigue and definitely adds rather than detracts. Enjoy.

Brynner is a sea captain, Brando a pacifist forced by the British to help get the boat into Allied hands, and Margolin as the American-German-Jewish prisoner. It's good to see Janet in one of her few leading roles a few years after David and Lisa.

This scenario has all the ingredients of greatness, yet the film never rises to it as the plot is ill-concieved with an unfinished feel to it. However it's well worth watching rare performances by these actors.

370206,3,6301798589,"That Morituri didn't exactly set the box-office alight in 1965 can be gauged from the fact that it's known under at least three titles (Saboteur and The Saboteur - Codename: ""Morituri"" - which isn't actually the anti-hero's codename!). Taking its title from the famed gladiator's address `We who are about to die salute you,' it's a surprising seabound reunion of veterans of the 1962 version of Mutiny on the Bounty who you'd think would know better and certainly wouldn't even want to see each other again, let alone board another ship after that famously nightmarish shoot. While Trevor Howard had the good sense to remain on dry land in a lengthy cameo, Brando soon resorted to type, demanding rewrites, refusing to memorise his lines or hit his marks and generally making producer Aaron Rosenberg and director Bernhard Wicki's life hell as the film drifted increasingly over budget and over schedule before slowly sinking with all hands at the box-office.

Brando's Crain/Kyle is a peace-loving, somewhat Bohemian German exile living under an assumed identity in India who finds himself blackmailed into going undercover as a Nazi by Trevor Howard's ruthless British intelligence officer (""You're a cold b*****d,"" snipes Brando: ""I was born on a chilly island,"" replies Howard in the film's best exchange). His mission isn't to sabotage and sink a German freighter with a vital cargo of rubber but to prevent it from being scuttled so the Allies can claim the cargo for their own war effort. Since much of the crew is made up of criminals and political undesirables less than eager to return to Germany, he finds himself occupying an intriguing moral grey area: Kyle's first and most useful ally is not found among the allied prisoners of war (many holding Janet Margolin's Jewish survivor of their torpedoed ship in as much open contempt as the Nazis) or Brynner's aggressively apolitical captain, but rather takes the form of the ship's second officer and most fanatical Nazi Party member Martin Benrath. The film isn't blind to the moral ironies and dramatic possibilities this presents and throws in numerous interesting spins and obstacles to his task, yet while it's not a bad film at all it's never really as thrilling or compelling as it should be.

Part of the problem is Brando, who had by then moved into that period of his career when he was increasingly bored with just delivering a solid performance and increasingly felt need to make his parts more eccentric to keep himself interested. It's a long way from the surreal self-indulgence of later films and it's not an especially bad performance, but rather than doing what the film requires you often get the feeling that you're watching him go through acting exercises as he drifts in and out of the film that everyone else is making. As a result it's Brynner, giving a typically arrogant and stentorian turn in a role originally intended for Lee J. Cobb who comes across as the more convincing screen presence despite having much less screen time and much less to work with.

It's on a technical level that the film impresses the most. The Oscar-nominated black and white camerawork is often astounding, with some of the most technically ambitious and flawlessly executed helicopter shots ever achieved on film, often moving from extreme long shots of the ship at sea into close-ups of characters on deck before tracking with them along the decks. In an age before Wescams or CGI the sheer physical difficulties in getting such remarkably smooth shots must have been extraordinary - between the seas and the wind alone hitting the right marks and focus points on a moving ship should have been next to impossible - making them all the more impressive, so it's a shame that at times the DVD transfer overcompensates for the deep blacks that are one of cinematographer Conrad Hall's trademarks and noticeably regrades and softens the contrast in some shots. Jerry Goldsmith's score fares better, its haunting East European main title played on the zither as ominous strings build up in the background doing services in a variety of guises alongside some striking action cues using the same mixture of rapid pared-down percussion, driving piano work and electronics that would become a hallmark of his Man From U.N.C.L.E. scores.

It's a shame that the infamous short film 'Meet Marlon Brando' about the star's increasingly peculiar behavior on the film's press tour (hitting on a passing black woman in a rather patronising attempt to make a point about racism, being typically vague at a press conference and offering the words of wisdom that ""You won't know how to proceed in life unless you see Morituri."") isn't included alongside the film's two theatrical trailers.",1194307200,2,4739,4.987357774968395

The movie drags a bit for modern tastes and the cinematography is unnecessarily dark (even for black and white).  The plot is a bit of a stretch and too many coincidences are needed to advance it.  For its day it probably was quite daring in the manner that it dealt with rape and the dehumanizing effects it has on both victim and rapist(s).  Yul Brynner and Marlon Brando both are excellent in their roles but also limited by them.  The screen writer never quite figured out how to achieve the kind of suspense/plot-twist/character study that was achieved in, say, John Lecarre's ""The Spy Who Came In From the Cold"" which is far superior in that regard.

Beautifully shot in moody noir and white it is also directed with a terrific sense of sustained excitement, and certainly kept me guessing --- every cliche was side-stepped. I had no idea how it was going to end. The plot line is so convoluted that at times it seems almost shapeless, but what holds it together are the extremely well-written individual scenes, where the dialogue is razor-sharp and exceptionally well-delivered by the performers --- Brando especially. It's sad to think that these kinds of adventure tales are no longer made: almost all we get now are monotonous TV-style bang-bang-bangs; or overblown blockbusters aimed at morons.

Yul Brynner plays the captain of a German cargo ship in Japan. He is an honorable man who despises the Nazis but he is a patriot. His mission is to get a cargo of badly needed rubber back to Europe for the German war machine. In doing this, he is plagued by a true believer Nazi for a 1st officer and by his reputation, tarnished by a previous sinking.

Brando even comes to learn that there are some things worth dying for. The title comes from the Latin for the old gladiator's salute: ""We who are about to die, salute you.""

***SPOILER***: Unfortunately, a twist in the plot that at first looked brilliant and amped the suspense up even higher fell absolutely flat with a politically-convoluted ""THUD."" Rather than continue on the course of an excellent espionage thriller, the film took-on a pack of prisoners from supporting U-Boat, one of whom was a woman. Unfortunately for the top-notch build-up of Daniel Taradash's script, this female character's back-story included not only a decidedly-racist anti-German bent, but then she (on a German boat, no less) decides to announce her khazar-jewish heritage. That's not all. No, she goes even further and waxes poetic about death camps and ritual rape.

Why did this turn the plot decidedly sour? -- for many reasons.
#1: How many TENS OF THOUSANDS of self-identified jews served in the Waffen SS as GERMAN soldiers? And no, they didn't wear special arm bands with the star of Molech. Contrary to the hollowwood WWII revisionists, khazar-jews were not hunted to near-extinction in Europe by National Socialist Germany. Any khazar-jews that were interned in camps were so done because they identified as communists, freemasons and of various other ideologies hostile to the war effort. In other words, Germany went to pains to vet these prisoners UNLIKE the United States government, which imprisoned Japanese-Americans simply for being part-Japanese.
#2: The charge of rape in the Wehmacht was punishable by DEATH. And this is why the discipline of German fighting units far exceeded the brutality that Russian, American and British soldiers subjected Europe and North African civilians to. Complaints of rape by allied soldiers were widespread as soon as they invaded France. That's right, the ""liberation"" of France was marred by rampant rape and theft by the glorious allies. I wonder why that's never covered in US history? Yet the khazar-jewish female character rants and raves about rape in at least two vomit-inducing scenes.
#3: In this last hour of the film, a radio broadcast from Berlin credited Brynner's character's son with the Knight's Cross for sinking an allied ship off of France. When Brynner looks-up the identified allied vessel, he goes ballistic because he finds it was in fact, a hospital ship that his son sank. Really? Firstly, German captains found guilty of sinking civilian or medical ships were immediately investigated and (if evidence was found) court martialed. This in fact, did happen early in the war to a U-Boat captain, but when it was discovered that possible US war supplies and personnel were aboard, the sinking was justified. But this film portrays Germany as pinning medals on captains that sink Red Cross vessels? Okay hollowwood, tell us another one.

I will say this, the sinking of clearly-identified medical vessels was repeatedly done several times late in the war by Russian, British AND American air forces. But again, that's something that they tend to gloss-over in US history classes.

This film went from a 5-star WWII suspense thriller to a 1-star exercise in typical hollywood hatred of the Germanic peoples.",1462320000,,3355,5.173112338858195
