1727352,5,B000068UXI,"Although the information is sketchy, I believe this version of the opera is that conducted by Pierre Boulez.  The music is part of the focus and it is well recorded.  Instead of picturing the orchestra players during orchestral interludes, the full score is shown.  In the other available video performance, the emphasis is on the vagueness and innocence of the principals.  In this version, Melisande (Alison Hagley) and Pelleas (Neill Archer) seem caught up in their unavoidable physical attraction.  The singing of the whole cast is impeccable, but the dynamics and expressiveness of the singing and the acting add up to an unbeatable combination to bring out this interpretation of the opera.  I also prefer this staging to the alternative version.  Still, anyone who expects the tremendous extremes of a tragic opera will probably not be prepared for the flowing and rather low key range of expression in Debussy's music.  Repeated viewing is recommended.",998438400,3,960,5.188311688311688

7964815,5,B000068UXI,"As is well known, ""Pellas et Mlisande"" caused a scandal at its 1902 premiere, instantly polarizing the French musical community between those who loved the opera and those who loathed it. But it has long since achieved recognition as a one-of-a-king masterpiece,  a career-defining work for Debussy, and one of the great operas of the twentieth century. But it's not an opera for everyone. Everything is vague, suggestive, and understated. There are no arias or ensembles, just a wonderfully expressive and flexible sort of speech-song, with orchestral writing of infinite colors and textures. The average operagoer is confused by the lack of ""operatic"" trappings, and the intimacy and subtlety are lost in a large theater. So this DVD is an excellent way to experience the work. Pierre Boulez has long been known for his clear, communicative performances of twentieth-century music, and he has always considered Debussy a major twentieth-century composer. When he first recorded the orchestral works in the late sixties, the clarity and precision of the performances were considered revelatory. He brings the same qualities to ""Pellas"", along with an unexpected passion and lyricism. And he has a superlative cast, without a weak link - beautiful singing, strong characterization, and exemplary French diction. I especially enjoyed Alison Hagley. I knew her from her delightful Susanna on a Glyndebourne ""Figaro"". Perhaps surprisingly, her Mlisande is also delightful - not a pallid cipher, but a witty, multifaceted heroine. I was also most impressed by Samuel Burkey as Yniold; this little boy handles the difficult music with aplomb, acts well, and is unfazed by the language. The sets are mostly abstract shapes and very dark, but they work well; and the lighting effects are striking. I rather enjoyed seeing pages from Boulez's conducting score during the orchestral interludes - an unusual and innovative approach. I agree with a couple of other reviewers that this is one of the best opera DVDs available. Strongly recommended!",1278115200,9,2036,5.3229813664596275
7964816,5,B000068UXI,"How mysterious, haunting, and other-worldly was Debussy's beautiful score!  And Alison Hagley's portrayal of Melisande perfectly matched these qualities.  A rare thing of beauty in a dark place, always searching for light.  Neil Archer as Pelleas, seemed to come from the same mysterious place, ending in their inevitable mutual attraction.

But it was Donald Maxwell as the multi-dimensional Golaud who deserves laurels for his passionate performance, so gently loving, so mad with jealousy, so torn by guilt and remorse.  He gets more than five stars for this, not to mention his wonderful baritone!

Kenneth Cox as Arkel was also moving as the wise and gentle, aged king.  Penelope Walker as Genevieve and Samuel Burkey as Yniold were also excellent.

I loved how this opera was divided into scenes, each, in this production, beginning with pages of the actual score.  I thought this added momentum to the entire story, so that it did not drag at all.  In fact, I was so caught up in it, I didn't even notice that there was no audience or that the conductor and orchestra were not shown!

This production excelled in everything:  music, singing, acting, sets.  By Act V, I was moved to tears.  I loved it!",1200700800,12,1208,4.886699507389163
7964817,5,B000068UXI,"Visually and musically, I cannot imagine a better production of this opera.  Yet, the opera itself is depressing as hell and if you want to sit through hours of opera that never seem to end which include lies, infidelity, betrayal, incest, murder, and in which everybody dies in the end, I'd stick with Wagner's ""Ring.""  Somehow, the investment seems more rewarding to me.",1118880000,9,372,4.888888888888889
7964818,5,B000068UXI,"I wish that in the future all operas are filmed without audience.

Coughing, especially in USA, is so very distracting in most operas filmed with audience present.",1113955200,6,163,5.037037037037037
7964819,4,B000068UXI,"Debussy's Pelleas et Melisande is the new Deutsche Grammophon release of the 1992 performance by the Welsh National Opera, conducted by Pierre Boulez with Stage Production and Design by Peter Stein.

Briefly, Pelleas et Melisande is a tragic opera of two half brothers, Pelleas and Golaud, who are in love with the same mysterious woman - Melisande. Golaud, who first meets and marries Melisande, introduces her to his half brother Pelleas - the two fall in love and ultimately meet tragic and untimely deaths; Pelleas by his brother's hand and Melisande, mysteriously. This is the opera in a nutshell though the character development throughout this production is considerably more extensive.

Before going into the detail of what is most enjoyable about this DVD lets first get what is not so enjoyable out of the way. When sitting to watch an opera on DVD you want to enjoy the feeling of being there, as if you were a part of the audience, but with a better seat, seeing the orchestra perform, the conductor conduct and hearing the applause of the actual viewers.

This DVD is presented without an audience in attendance, and if it was in attendance, it didn't express approval or disaproval or display any emotional reaction to the performances. The absence of an audience seemed to detract from the ""live"" feeling one might expect upon viewing a DVD, as opposed to simply listening to it on a studio recorded CD. Second, in scenes where the music is transitional, beautifully scored by Debussy, the camera merely pans through the musical score. This is where you might expect to see live shots of the orchestra working its way through a marvelous score. And finally, it's hard to understand why DG put this particular opera on two discs. It doesn't seem to require two discs, so why force the viewers out of their chairs to load the final Act? Is it merely to justify a $39.99 price for a two disc set?

Now, the good stuff: the cast was superb. Soprano Alison Hagley as Melisande and Tenor Neil Archer as Pelleas were outstanding. They were believable in their roles. Both were young and attractive, and each sung the beautiful Debussy score with heartfelt emotion and sincerity. The Act III scene of Pelleas stroking Melisande's hair from the balcony window was wonderfully done and the director was able to achieve a beautiful level of innocent eroticism by filming it as it was. Donald Maxwell as Golaud was exceptional, with a clear strong baritone sound and a wonderful job conveying the tortured emotions of his character, including an Otello-like breakdown. Also in wonderful form was bass Kenneth Cox as King Arkel, his deep lush sound portrayed the aging King with grace. All other principles and supports did a fine job and contributed to a very well done overall performance.

The sets by Karl-Ernst Herrmann were interesting, providing the viewer with a non-descript time (seems to be what everybody is doing these days) with a dark modernistic stage offset by striking silver blue and black costumes. Only King Arkel and Melisande in Act II wore white, which played off well against the otherwise dull backdrop. Throughout the performance the viewer will find oneself drawn into the opera smoothly as it moves along from scene to scene, emotion to emotion, thanks to deft direction and believable performances by a very talented cast. Though I would not recommend this as a `date' opera, or the first opera you watch, it is a beautiful and thoughtful piece that at times rises to hypnotic. On a recent internet site P&M won first prize as favorite opera to sleep to. Everybody agreed it had great depth and a powerful score.

Pelleas et Melisande is very Wagneresque, in a Parsifal kind of way (listen to the entrance music of King Arkel and you will be immediately taken back to the scene of Gurnemanz and Parsifal entering the Hall in Act I of Parsifal), accompanied with long sweeping melodic melodies with very little `action' on the stage. The orchestra seems to carry all of the meaning and emotion of the piece, like a tone poem. Debussy described it as creating a message where the music substitutes for dialogue. This is a great way to approach this piece when you view and listen to it. As noted, each Act is separated by transitional music, giving the piece the feel of one continuous line of music. Maybe this is why the producer opted for no audience and no breaks between the five Acts.

Pelleas et Melisande has taken its lumps over the years and clearly may not be everybody's favorite, requiring more of an acquired taste and time before being understood for its more subtle genius. But there is no denying that in the right hands and with the right production team this opera can be a powerful piece of music with strong and deliberate emotions carrying you from the beginning when the curtain rises to the tragic conclusion. I highly recommend. (J.G.)",1109116800,41,4890,4.821215733015495
7964820,5,B000068UXI,"I've always had a difficult time with this opera.  After awhile it just becomes so beautifully boring.  BUT, not so here.  This production held my attention from beginning to end.  It is probably the most perfect opera on DVD you will ever find.  My only complaint is with the packaging.  Why on earth did DGG spread it over 2 discs?  The second one has only the short Act 5 which could have easily been on the first disc.",1044576000,26,422,4.333333333333333
7964821,5,B000068UXI,"This is the best combination of conducting, orchestral playing, singing and sound quality that I have yet heard in this highly distinctive masterpiece (also, the staging is spare, but attractive and believable). Boulez belies his reputation for coldness with conducting full of warmth, atmosphere and dramatic involvement (unlike the bland and placid Von Karajan), and the orchestral sound is both lush and refined. Secondly, the singing of the principal roles of Pelleas, Melisande, Golaud and Arkel is first class in terms of both beauty of sound, sense of style and perception of characterization. Moreover, both Neil Archer and Alison Hagley, the Pelleas and Melisande, are young and good looking, thus adding to their credibility. In particular, Archer as Pelleas sings with a genuine light baritone timbre (what the French call baryton marton-I have only heard this vocal quality from the young Jansen on the classic 1941 Desormiere recording) ,which not only further conveys the youth of Pelleas but also presents a meaningful contrast to both the heavier baritone of Donald Maxwell as the considerably older Golaud and the genuine basso of Kenneth Cox as the elderly Arkel. The only complaint that I would offer is that the recording of this less than 3 hour work is spread over 2 DVDs, thus needlessly increasing the cost (strangely, the first four of opera's five acts is on disc one). This performance, which I find distinctly superior to those of both Von Karajan and Abbado, deserves to become a classic.",1036454400,91,1517,5.145748987854251
