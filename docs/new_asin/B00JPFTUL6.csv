6382644,5,B00JPFTUL6,This is not a timeline history of World War One as the other reviewers already mentioned.  This set does include a lot of interesting information though.  For instance the use of Zeppelin's to bomb England in the first air blitz.  As well as a very brief overview of how the Zeppelin company came into being.  It also devotes one entire episode to the early use of WMDs.  And another episode to the  history of submarine warfare.  So if your looking for a historical timeline approach to World War One this set is probably not for you.  But if you want to better understand how World War One was the changing point between conventional and more modern warfare methods this should fascinate you as it did me.  The only minor draw back is that all the modern reenactment footage on disc one is shown in black and white.  I suppose they did this to make it look authentic.  However we get an entire disc of bonus footage plus the four part series so I'm not complaining.,1408752000,8,967,4.468571428571429
6382645,3,B00JPFTUL6,not what i expected. i thought it was more of a history of the war. it's more about the elements.,1408492800,2,97,3.9
6382646,1,B00JPFTUL6,"From the title and promotion I expected a history of world war I, This is nothing more that a rehash of weapons of war! My only wonder now is that it doesn't include motorcycles jocks and prisons of world war !.",1407715200,8,211,4.170731707317073
8652759,5,B00JPFTUL6,Very well done!,1503360000,,15,4.333333333333333
8652760,2,B00JPFTUL6,"Strange, to say the least,  the programming  includes neo political jargon and effects, that distort instead of preserve Historical Record,
to make it History More interesting in some warped way",1464825600,,194,5.433333333333334
8652761,5,B00JPFTUL6,"I bought this DVD for a US History class and there is quite a bit of great information in these videos. I don't recall hearing about these programs when they were on History Channel, but this is a great series that will hold student's attention. Each episode kid of recaps some of the same basic information (causes of the war, bogging down in trench warfare, etc.) but includes plenty of other information.",1454889600,2,407,4.666666666666667
8652762,5,B00JPFTUL6,"A worthwhile buy. I watched it and enjoy immensely, it is as usual a well done program from the history channel. I ended up recommending it to several people and they all enjoyed it.",1448236800,,182,4.382352941176471

8652764,5,B00JPFTUL6,this was shown on the discovery channel in 2014.  And it was a well done overview of the weapons and each type of combat of world war one. It is not a general history of the conflict. But it is a outstanding dvd set.  I would highly recommend this one to anyone who wishes to enjoy a interesting and well recreated overview of the type of weapons that came of age during this terrible war.,1426896000,2,389,4.173333333333333
8652765,4,B00JPFTUL6,As a history buff I found it to be pretty interesting. It did not much into the causes of WWI but I don't think it was meant to. It was about the weapons of WW1. It was worth the price.,1423612800,,185,3.65
