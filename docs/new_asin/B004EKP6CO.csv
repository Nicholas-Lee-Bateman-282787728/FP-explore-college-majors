8427206,1,B004EKP6CO,"This is NOT Carl Palmer's drumming.  Don't know what it is, but the audio ain't him!  Perhaps tthey took 30 seconds of a performance and slowed it down to fill ten minutes.",1399680000,,172,4.34375
8427207,1,B004EKP6CO,Who would ever then think of putting a midi soundtrack to this.  There's 10 minutes of my life that I will never get back.,1394150400,4,122,4.083333333333333
8427208,1,B004EKP6CO,"Here are my reasons:

1. Video is of Carl, audio is NOT.
2. The actual video is in slow motion so the ""drum-synching"" electronic drummer can ""play"" Carl's solo.
3. Did I mention it is a steaming pile of crap?

This video is a TOTAL disservice to Carl. (Period)",1382227200,5,260,4.285714285714286
8427209,5,B004EKP6CO,LOVE IT. It Could use some interviews though. It shows how he is playing his solos live. It also has the same solos in slow motion with midi drum tracks to get a better idea on how his drumming is being played.,1315526400,3,210,4.023809523809524
