8666382,5,B00LLLPYFI,I love this series of documentaries by Tim Keesee. But I love even more that God is powerfully at work to spread His Word in places where the gospel has not been heard. This 7th DVD is my favorite. God's light shines the brightest in the darkest circumstances. I am thankful for men and women of God who are unafraid to spread the gospel at the risk of their own safety.,1419638400,2,370,4.225352112676056
