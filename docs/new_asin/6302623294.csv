503415,5,6302623294,"THE LEGEND OF BOGGY CREEK has become a cult classic for several reasons:
It's based on a true story.
Even though it was made on a low budget, it still manages to frighten.
Eyewitnesses to the nightmarish events depicted in the film play themselves in many instances.
Throughout the flick there is a narrator (whose mother sent him running, at age seven, to the neighbors for help after sighting a ""wildman"" in the neighbors' field).  The events occur in the rural little woodsy town of Fouke, Arkansas, where sightings of a large, hairy, manlike monster have been taking place for years.  Several eyewitneses, playing themselves, give brief interviews of what they saw.  Other encounters with the big hairy unlovely are staged, docudrama-style...and they're quite scary indeed.
There's teenage student Mary Beth Circey, who's home alone at night with a female relative and the relative's baby.  ""Mary Beth, could you cover the window with a blanket?  A draft's gonna get on the baby!""  Mary Beth first lets her mewling little kitten outside, then grabs a blanket to put over the window...when she hears a quiet, persistent breathing outside in the darkness, and peers through the glass into the yard--and screams in utter terror!  What had looked at first to be a tree that shouldn't be there is MOVING outside!  As the hulking shape moves closer, she collapses into a fit of hysteria...and the next morning discovers her dead kitten outside like a rag doll, unmarked, apparently just ""scared"" to death.
Then there's the Three Teenage Girls In the MotorHome At Night.  Young Nancy has invited two friends over for a ""bunking"" party, and the girls are sitting around with orange-juice-can-sized curlers in their hair, drinking Coke and talking about boyfriends, when they hear breathing outside.  At first they think it's just the wind, but as it intensifies they realize that something is moving outside in the darkness.  The whatever-it-is starts grunting and puffing, causing  the hysterical girls to race for the shotgun, spilling bullets everywhere while trying to load the rifle.  Then, suddenly, all is quiet.  ""I'll take a look out,"" says one of the girls, and she parts the curtains, peering into the forested murk--whereupon there's a heart-stopping freeze frame of her blonde head thrown back in an ear-shattering scream as she violently clutches the drapes.  ""Next day,"" says the narrator, ""flowerpots were found broken outside and garbage cans overturned.  But there was no sign of the creature.""
The most horrifying ordeal of all was endured by two young couples who moved into a farmhouse to split expenses.  The first night, the two young women, alone--one of whom resembles a bespectacled Velma from ""Scooby Doo""--hear heavy breathing as something moves outside the house.  They put a chair under the doorknob.  The next day, a male cousin comes to visit and he discovers large humanlike three-toed footprints outside.  That night, more breathing and sounds of something shuffling around outside.  Then someone--or something--tries to turn the doorknob.  The young women are hysterical when their husbands arrive home...a monstrous furry arm gropes through the living room and bathroom windows...the men rush out to shoot at the invader and one is mauled by the thing, grasped by huge fuzzy hands and lifted up and down and shaken like a toy.  He's rushed to the emergency room of the Texarkana Hospital, where a doctor pronounces him in a state of shock.  Both young couples immediately move away, never to return.
In towns containing theaters where THE LEGEND OF BOGGY CREEK was first released in 1972, citizens reported a rash of Bigfoot sightings.  Hysteria?  Perhaps.  But maybe box offices should have featured signs reading: ""WARNING:  THIS FILM MAY MAKE YOU SEE SWAMP SLOBS.""  Like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, this film is low budget and the horror is almost never onscreen but instead in the viewers' imaginations, making it all the more effective.  Unlike THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, however, BOGGY CREEK is true.",1019692800,4,4033,5.103658536585366
503416,5,6302623294,I recall this movie being the all timespookiest thing I have ever seen. It's lack of clarity combined withit's setting lends to the films overall mystique. This picture I beleive proves that true horror doesnot need to rely on a multi million dollar budget to be executed well. As a child this flick left me desperately trying to figure out what this creature was...where it was.....was this true ...etc.......Thefact that this could have happenedsomewhere in those dark creepy swampsfor real as opposed to some fairy tale written by a big movie produceris what makes this cheap film seriously eerie. The primal element........the power of suggestion is what somehow get's you totally inthis flick ...real fear can be real cheap.,1018483200,2,729,5.1344537815126055
503417,5,6302623294,"I am outraged with excitment for ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" to finally be on dvd. This film is very creepy. There isn't any innapropriate content in this particular motion picture but at times it is INTENSELY SCARY. This film is a true story about people down in Texarkana doing reanactments of their experiances with a monster that hides out in the backwoods. This film is a horror/documentary that is good to watch at night with a friend BUT NEVER ALONE! You could also watch it with your kids if you have kids but as a warning don't watch it with your kid's if they scare easy. Now buy and watch this (with a friend,at a party,or with kids)and get your self soooooooooooooooooooooooooo scared you can't sleep. I STRONGLY RECCOMEND THIS FILM AND ENJOY!",1016928000,7,755,4.641791044776119
503418,3,6302623294,"I can't say this was a really bad movie,yet I'm hesitant to say it was a really good one. I don't know the whole story behind this film,but it's very obvious that it was ""no budget"" and looks like it might have been filmed on a super-8 camera. With those handicaps(depending on your viewpoint,of course) in mind,I can see how it can be considered quite an accomplishment indeed. But that music...""Hey,Travis Crabtree"" and that song about the creature wondering if there's another monster out there for him to love...it's unintentionally hilarious. You can tell it was written in all seriousness,and I have the sneaking suspicion they were sung by the narrator (probably written by him as well).
It makes it hard to take the movie seriously.",1011398400,3,740,4.880952380952381
503419,4,6302623294,"I saw this in the theatre/drive-in back in its initial release. Talk about obsession, after seeing this nightmarish screamfest, I made my folks pass through Fouke, Arkansas and I had them take a picture of me by the welcome to sign.  We drove around that small town and the woods there are definetely SCARY!!!  This movie is like Blairwitch in that there are no special effects, you don't get to see the creature that often and mostly you the viewer are put in the situation.  Not recommended for young children!!!!  Very atmospheric, real creeeeeeepy!!!",1005523200,9,554,4.861702127659575
503420,4,6302623294,"I don't give this movie so high a rating because it is a piece of cinematic art. On the contrary, ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" is a grade B movie at best. The four stars above are based on the fact that ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" has stood the test of time for this viewer. I first saw this ""docudrama"" about the Fouke, Arkansas member of the bigfoot clan on TV as a kid. Repeated viewings over the years have not dulled the late night enchantment of that first time.
Produced in the early 1970's, ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" is the documentary reminiscence of an unnamed and perhaps fictional narrator. The cast of unknowns and real people lend an air of credibility to the dramatizations of supposed actual encounters with the smelly, three toed, hairy hominid said to have stalked Boggy Creek. When it comes time to reveal the monster to the camera, the film makers were savvy enough to make most of his shots shadowy and/or distant. You know it is a man in a suit but you may find yourself wondering if there was (or is) an actual creature out there in the bottom lands of Arkansas.
If you have not already seen ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" you may want to look for it on TV before buying. It may not hold the same charm for you that it does for me unless you are a fan of ""psychotronic"" film or, perhaps,a cryptozoologist.",997142400,10,1326,4.350806451612903
503490,1,6302623294,I really like this film but this DVD is absolute garbage. Looks like it was copied off of a copy off of a copy of a TV broadcast. The Sterling Entertainment DVD released in 2002 is a much better transfer.,1517184000,,204,4.125
503491,5,6302623294,Grandpa and I would find this on a late night show or on a off the main stream tv channels.  I thought it was gone forever.  Spooky enough to believe yet doesnt have the gory fake stuff the movies of today do.,1517184000,,209,3.9523809523809526
503492,1,6302623294,I remember seeing this movie on a show called Creature Feature back around 1980. It scared me then. I haven't seen this movie since then. I couldn't even watch it to the end because it annoyed the crap out of me. Holy smokes I can't believed this actually scared me 40 years ago. What a crappy movie,1517011200,,299,4.2631578947368425
503493,5,6302623294,This is a true story that took place in Fouke Arkansas in the 1960s. Most people in the movie are not actors but the real people that had these encounters. It's pretty good. One of the best sasquatch movies out there.,1516838400,,217,4.317073170731708
503494,5,6302623294,"This film is great on so many levels; I can understand why it is considered a classic within it's genre.  If you are in the mood for a thoughtful, yet eerily atmospheric ""docudrama"" with a vintage feel, ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" is an excellent pick.  The fact that real witnesses and actual settings are in many cases incorporated into the film adds an additional level of interest, and the rural setting, unique music, and layered perspectives on the part of the narrator contribute to the overall quality of the movie.  The somewhat grainy look may require a moment of adjustment for the modern audience, but ultimately adds (rather than detracts) from the ambiance.  However, if you are looking for a big-budget, Hollywood gore-fest, you may want to keep browsing...",1516406400,,772,4.915384615384616

Otherwise, it is a fascinating trip down memory lane of the southern rural culture in the 1970s. It is interesting to note that the stories and interviews do strive to treat the people portrayed or the real witnesses with respect--the films focuses on the creature and simply tells the story.",1514073600,,420,4.929577464788732

I was 6 when it came out, scared the Hell out of me because we had to cross a Boggy Creek going to our hunting lease.  Now its a great trip down memory lane.  We have become so accustomed to computer generated perfection and Discovery Planet factoids, people just can't enjoy a good old fashioned yarn any more.  I guess I got a different copy of the DVD than some of these other folks, because its as good a copy as the one on Prime.  I'm a big fan of crypto-zoology, and the Sasquatch legends in particular.  I think the Finding Bigfoot series is the most hilarious thing I have ever seen in the field of pseudo-science.

503557,4,6302623294,"The version that I purchased was circulated by Cheezy Flix, I'm assuming it's considered cheesy because most of the actors were locals, and many played themselves. I'm sure that today, the costume for the creature would be a bit better, but for it's day I guess it was pretty good. The cinematography was actually very good, with the nature shots and lots of moody woods scenes--they set the tone quite nicely. The music had a definite local feel to it.

I watched this movie when I was a teenager with my best friend Christi--we screamed like maniacs at the appropriate times, LOL. We enjoyed it so much we hid out in the dark until the next showing and watched it again! The fact that it was based on a true story really impressed me and I'm sure, added to the fear. It doesn't surprise me that it's become somewhat of a cult classic in it's genre. My own boys watched it when they were young, and we've just viewed it again--and really enjoyed it, despite the...ahem...lack of acting classes.

One thing that bothers me about this movie, is the issue of money. It was made on a shoestring budget (approx. $100,000), but ended up grossing (over the years) over 20 million dollars. From what I've read, the townspeople who participated, and folks who played themselves in the film, were not/were under-compensated, and I think generated a lawsuit or two. Very sad, as the folks of Fouke were very helpful in the making of this movie.

The Wikipedia on this movie states that it ""claims to be based on a true story""; whether this particular incident is true I don't know, but it mirrors pretty closely an incident that occurred in the far southeast corner of my state--probably not 100 miles from Fouke, AR. Only our incident happened in the late 90's instead of the 70's. The ""monster"" harassed the family for about a year; I honestly don't know if the family still lives there or not. This incident generated quite a stir in the ""bigfoot community"", and is from what I read, mirrored in several other locations across the US over the years.

I guess in summary, I'd say this movie is a well-done amateur effort, attempting to portray a small town and it's work-a-day folks, attempting to deal with a nightmarish creature they had lived around for many years but had no experience dealing directly with. It asked some interesting questions: Why did the creature stay hidden in the back woods most of the time? Why did it suddenly feel compelled to initiate contact with people? In a very rural, sparsely-populated area, if it were shy it would have no trouble staying away from people. The poignant song about the creature talked about it's loneliness, and asked if it were the only one of it's kind. Perhaps the lonely cry was a call for company?",1497657600,,2748,4.648148148148148

503776,5,6302623294,"A 1970s documentary-style drama questions the existence of a hairy 7ft tall Sasquatch-type monster that lives in a swamp outside of Fouke, Arkansas. According to the locals there;  the monster walks on two feet, has a characteristic smelly odor and kills chicken, cattle, dogs & livestock but, so far, it hasn't killed any people. The monster supposedly harassed two families in the late '60s, but since then few have seen the monster yet it can be heard in the swamp at night. Actual interviews with area residents tell the tale.

Due to shows like In Search Of and, later on, in Unsolved Mysteries and shows of this ilk, I learned about creatures like Bigfoot, The Mothman, The Loch Ness Monster and the like. They've always been a mystery and have always intrigued me. It wasn't until later that I learned about The Legend of Boggy Creek. When I first watched the film, I actually thought it was a real documentary on Bigfoot. When I got older, I found out it was a psuedo-documentary with re-enactments taking place about the subject but, still, it was one of those films that creeped me out back in the day that made me skittish to be out playing in the dark. Horror fans will probably find this film to be quite boring and uneventful. Especially since this film comes from the director of The Town That Dreaded Sundown, which most horror fans will know of this classic. There's no blood, no killing, and you hardly see Bigfoot at all in the film. However, the film is quite good at giving you a creepy vibe if you're watching it alone in the dark.

 The Legend of Boggy Creek was released theatrically to major financial success given its budget of only $160,000, earning around $20 million at the box office and was the 11th highest-grossing film of 1972. To this day, it continues to be a work of fascination by fans as well as moviemakers alike. The film, itself, spawned 4 sequels...Return to Boggy Creek, Boggy Creek II: And The Legend Continues(which, despite it being the third film, it was written as the sequel to this film and involved the director of this film, hence the odd title) Boggy Creek: The Legend is True and The Legacy of Boggy Creek.

At the very least, this film is worth a look. It's a film beloved by the older generations and is one that the younger generation should watch, soley, to see where films like The Blair Witch Project, The Poughkeepsie Tapes, Paranormal Activity, Area 51, The Dinosaur Experiment all got their documentary/Found footage idea from. It's a really good film, despite it's age and flaws and one I definitely recommend.",1462838400,,2576,4.677704194260485

503778,3,6302623294,"If you are tired of movies that portray Southerners poorly, you'll love the authenticity of the dialogue in this movie. Also, the attempt to make it seem like a documentary was pretty advanced for the time. However, people who were frightened by this movie when they were children grow up to laugh at it later. There are some perfectly ridiculous interludes in which sappy music plays and human motives like loneliness are projected onto the monster. I'm not sure why Legend didn't get a cult following a la Rocky Horror or Big Lebowski. Guaranteed fun. Bring popcorn.",1461110400,,568,4.865979381443299

Its never very scary but there are a couple of scenes that are done in a nice, creepy style.  Most of the people I know who saw this film when they were kids thought it was very scary.

I bought the movie because I know the background story.
My family and I were forced to leave our campsite along the Boggy Creek (near Fouke, Arkansas) in the late 1960s. An unknown animal threw rocks into our campsite. It screamed, roared and grunted. The smell wafting from what-ever-it-was made you nauseous. The events scared the beegeesus out of every member of our family. Camping gear was left in place in our haste to escape.
Over the holidays we began to reminisce our youth. We had never heard of Boggy Creek or the monster when we set up camp. But, we believe every bit of the story.",1419984000,2,635,4.628318584070796
504126,5,6302623294,"If you are in any way a 'bigfoot fan"", then this is a must have video.  However; there have been many releases of this film on DVD over the years and most of them are near impossible to watch.  Typically they are too dark and you literally can't see some of the monster scenes.  One particular release of the classic film seems to have been remastered and is much easier to watch than the other releases of TLOBC.  It's done by ""Hen's Tooth Video"" and actually is almost like watching a different film.  Most importantly, all the dark shadows and strong color have been modified so you actually get to see the monster!  Kind of an important thing in a monster movie.  There is a recently (2014) released version under a ""deluxe collector's edition"" heading and it's just as dark and murky as most of the others.
The review by ""Poisoned Dragon"" is right on in getting more deeply into this if you want to get your hands on the best copy out there - And what to avoid (I have most of them).  Also, the book by Lyle Blackburn (Available on Amazon) on the Boggy Creek Monster is a great companion if you are truly interested in the film and all that happened before, during and after it was made in the area around Fouke.",1419552000,,1217,4.353982300884955

504234,4,6302623294,"If you grew up with this movie, like I did, you will be more forgiving of it's flaws than if you are coming into it fresh. I remember watching this film with a bunch of my cousins, we were all crowded on the floor at my grandma's house, and I think the oldest was around 10 years of age, and I was probably 6 or 7. Bigfoot captured my imagination when I was a kid, and thanks to a TV show called ""In Search Of"" scaring the hell out of me at this time, I couldn't get enough stories told about the hairy monster.

""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" is actually a pretty innovative horror film, or at least it was at that time. Presented as a documentary based on ""True Events"", and featuring real people, not actors, ""Boggy Creek"" tapped into that same ""this is really happening"" fear that ""The Blair Witch Project' would emulate 20 years later. It also helped that on TV at the time we would get tons of those nature documentaries by Disney, and Mutual of Omaha's ""Wild Kingdom"" would play every Sunday night. ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" played very similar to what I was watching on network TV at the time.

The film is slow....very slow. As the narrator tells us about Fouke, Arkansas, we meet the townspeople (quite a few named Crabtree), and their experiences with a hairy creature that seems to watch them from the woods. Several hunters and trappers recall their run-in's with the beast, and we get lots of nature shots of the swamp, a couple awesome 70's country tunes; ""Lonely Cry"" and ""The Ballad of Travis Crabtree"", and all of this is slowly (very, very slowly) building to one heck of a climax as the Fouke Monster terrorizes a country clan in their house, attacking over a couple nights. The last 15 minutes of this film are what I carry with me to this day...and I can still feel that quaking six-year old kid inside, hunkering down with his cousins as the monster attacks.

I really don't think that someone coming to this movie today will enjoy it. Too much has changed, and even with a healthy dose of nostalgia thrown in, the first hour or so of this film can be a slog...even for fans. But one it gets rolling, ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" still has the ability to raise a few goosebumps.",1410393600,4,2199,4.398034398034398

It is one of the most beautiful productions I have ever seen.  Small wonder the film-maker went on to bigger things, but this just might be the best thing he ever did.  The story is authentic.  The actual settings  --  many of the actual eye witnesses describing their experiences.  It gives you a real feel for the people, the culture, their homes -- and the strange events as they transpired and as the people who lived through it describe them. You will certainly wonder just what it was they saw.  I expected an amateurish monster movie.  Instead I was awed by the beauty of the place and the personalities of the people.

At the risk of ruining my reputation (of which I have none in the online world to speak of) I'm still on a quest, searching for answers to my own experiences.

504357,3,6302623294,"In 1972 Charles B. Pierce did his best to scare a good part of the movie going population with a small independent film about a big foot type monster that was appearing in a little town called Fouke, Arkansas. The film, made on a shoestring budget of $160,000 grossed more than 20,000,000 making it one of the biggest films of that year. Shot as a documentary with reenactments the film has a sort of nostalgic charm that has influenced many later independent film makers.

Fouke, Arkansas is a sleepy Southern town that borders Louisiana and Texas. The people there spend most of their time working the land and hunting and fishing. The unique thing about the town is that since approximately 1946 a strange creature has been prowling the bottom lands near Boggy Creek. This creature  described as a seven foot tall bipedal is covered with fur and has three toes. At first gentle the creature has gotten more and more aggressive since its contacts with the local population. The film culminates in an attack on the Ford family in 1971 that sent one person to the hospital.

Told in a folksy narration the story contains interviews with many of the townspeople  often playing themselves. The question that comes to mind throughout the film is whether what we are seeing is real or some sort of elaborate hoax. I remember seeing this when it came out and seeing it some forty-two years later found it still to be enjoyable if a little dated.

The DVD is a standard  defination full frame presentation. The source material is not very good. The picture is very soft throughout t but serviceable. The mono sound is pretty clear and poses no problems of understanding. One wishes that there had been a decent restoration of the film but the interest level was probably quite low. The DVD by Cheezy Films presents some trailers, an intermission reel and a silent episode of a creature from the Black Lagoon type serial.

Many independent film makers credit this little film as an inspiration so it is worth checking out. The lower rating is for picture quality not content.

Worth checking out.

504393,5,6302623294,"When you ask a horror fan what their top 5 monster flicks are, there's a strong chance you are going to always get a butt kissing list of the greats. Michael, Freddy, Jason, Pinhead etc etc. Those guys are fine, and deserve their place in pop culture, but let's get a little diverse.
  For me, Boggy Creek will always be on my top 5 list. I received the VHS for my birthday when I was 7 or 8. Bigfoot? Swamps? I was excited. When I watched it, I was no longer excited, I was actually scared of this 70's drive-in fodder! Reason being, Bigfoot will always  have a creepy undertone, no matter how many stoners want to imagine him as a being just oh so one with nature. Adding to that, I grew up in somewhat rural Ohio with family in Appalachian West Virginia. As a kid in West Virginia, I can remember looking into the mountains at night, no light to be seen except the stars above, and thinking to myself that there HAS to be something lurking around out there. This movie was the fuel to my paranoid fire and made me afraid to be in the woods at night.
  Now granted, someone without having a true blue love for ANYTHING horror or cryptic related is going to look at this movie and think it's a joke. I wouldn't blame you if you did. It is enjoyably spooky and the Fouke monster's scream is blood curdling. It still gives me the creeps because it instantly transports me TARDIS style back to my childhood, watching those black mountains for anything that moved. It's a midnight creature feature flick (it's sequel was on MSTK), but what honest horror fan doesn't love those?",1391990400,,1574,4.376712328767123

It reminds me just a bit of the Blair Witch Project. It's production value is actually really good considering it is just two guys who filmed it and used the real people involved in the incidents instead of actors. I have no idea if any of it is true, and, frankly, don't care. It was great to watch. It starts off pretty slow and picks up a bit, but don't expect it to be like today's crypto-docu-dramas: Flashy and intense. It was made down South were things move at their own pace. I just loved the atmosphere in the movie. It's fun to watch the old cars, cloths, and the way people were in the early 70's. I think for people my age (40's) it might be fun because it brings you back to the early 70's when people actually took care of themselves; hunted, fished, trapped, gardened, canned, etc.",1386201600,2,968,4.295081967213115

Of course at that age you'll scoff at anything and think it won't be scary or eerie at all. That was until he told me to check the dogs outside at 9:30 at night. That's the power behind this 1970's Charles B. Pierce flick. It's a micro-budget, documentary recanting several terrifying run-ins with the cryptid known as the Fouke Monster. In my opinion, it's required watching for horror buffs due to its Blair Witch level success and just to see how truly eerie it is.

Of course if you live in a city or urban area it won't be scary at all; but if you've lived your whole life in the rural boons like I have and claim an over active imagination; this movie creeps up on you and pervades this sense of primal fear that something may be out there in the dark.

It is the worst of the various releases of this film, for its picture is contained within a thick black frame that occupies fully one quarter of the available screen space; the picture itself is a small window in the center. Within that window, the picture is ostensibly full screen, but figures show that peculiar narrowing that denotes compression. The picture lacks resolution, so much so that most of the names on the end credits are unreadable yellow blobs. The sound is overloud, and lacks crispness; there is a lot of hissing and popping. This version does not have the Cinema Shares International Distribution Corporation logo at the beginning, but instead an ugly ""Rated G"" in poor condition. At 1:14:45 (panther tracks under the Ford house), there is traveling tracking static moving up and down the screen, revealing that this version was sourced from a VHS tape.

I found the best part to be the final third of the movie. It had action, humor and suspense. The movie is dated but it was fun to journey back in time. The songs were pretty funny too. It added to the movie. I think this is better suited for younger kids. There is no gore and it's not that scary. I thought the narration was great. The actor voicing it was great and his lines were well written. I didn't find this movie boring I found it interesting and entertaining.

504648,5,6302623294,"""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" is a cult classic from the 1970's. It comes close to being a turkey movie, but somehow manages to stay clear from this questionable honour (just about).

Part documentary, part low-budget horror flick, ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" confirms our most deep-seated prejudices about fly-over country. Set in the Deep South, in a small community where rodent-hunting, cow-ranching and bean-cultivation are the major pastimes (whenever the locals are brave enough to leave their trailers), the film tells the story of the Fouke Monster, a hairy giant roaming the swamps and scaring the living daylights out of pretty much everyone from teenage girls to stray cowboys. Country music plays in the background, while the narrator expresses his sympathies for the presumably lonely monster who simply wants some human company. Best lines: ""Mary Beth, there's a draft on the baby"" and ""HE ALWAYS TRAVELS THE CREEKS"".

All actors are amateurs from Fouke or Texarkana in Arkansas, and the film is based on real events, in the sense that a Bigfoot-like creature really was spotted in the area a few years earlier. Sightings have continued to this day, and the TV show ""MonsterQuest"" recently sent an expedition to track down the monster (unsuccessfully).

It seems the big guy got away. Hardly surprising, since he got three toes and is immune to hillbilly bullets!

I'm not sure how to rate this pop culture icon, but since I don't want to be followed by an armed posse of hooded cryptozoologists in the dead of night, I suppose I have to give it...five stars. :P",1353715200,2,1575,4.954545454545454

504653,3,6302623294,"This movie is supposedly, along with Cannibal Holocaust, what inspired The Blair Witch Project. Being a fan of that film, I wanted to check it out.  While not a carbon copy of it, I can see how it clearly echoed it.  It does utilize the shaky camera, though not quite to the extent of Blair Witch.  Cannibal Holocaust, though I haven't seen it in its entirety, is probably a much closer match due to the fact the footage was found, but let's get back to this one.  This movie, made in 1972, was a kind of ""In Search of"" like movie that concerned a big-foot like creature haunting the swamps around Fouke, Arkansas.  It was produced on a micro budget of only 100,000.  The movie has lots of lush scenery, and fluid tracking shots near the beginning, as they glide down the swamps on a boat. The main complaint I have is the songs. Yes, you heard me right.  There are a few songs strummed on a guitar, but fortunately, you can always fast forward.  Well, let me get to my verdict on if I liked it or not.  Overall, it's not bad.  The best scenes are when the monster is sneaking up on a family in a farmhouse, and peaking in windows.  But the bad thing is the movie is often boring.  I don't find it particularly scary either, and the monster is obviously a man in a suit.  Some mumbled the same about the Blair Witch(I wasn't scared by this movie either, I just found it interesting), but to me, the sense of boredom is worse here, though they both clock in at around a measly 90 minute running time.  I think the difference is the songs (particularly the ditty about Young Jim.  Oh, my poor ears!)and the long pauses between when the beast shows itself, and when it disappears for a while.  But, this movie does deserve credit for being the first movie to be shot in this manner. If you liked Blair Witch, and Paranormal Activity, you might want to give this a watch.",1345075200,2,1867,4.32183908045977
504654,5,6302623294,Ok it doesn't scare me now but it really scared me then. I was 7 years old when I first saw this film and yes I was scared for 2 years. Looked out my back bedroom window at nighttime constantly and stared at the massive pine tree 30 feet away and always expecting that creature to be in the shadows behind it. It is a fun film to watch today because it brings back the memories of scarey films not being gorey and shadows and silouettes are usually more frightening then a close up of a poor ape suit...but it worked. The monster voice/sound still was creepy and glad I watched this during the day light hours. Not a well done film as far as camera and general sound go but it's from 1972 so I can ignore the average/below film quality. This film came out during the height of the bigfoot mystique. BFs were everywhere and Mo Mo the monster and the Fauke monster etc....all kids my age then were captivated by this and scared we might really run across one while camping with the folks.

Good picture quality, a nearly perfect print, save one spot where the underlying print has a skip, at 32:54, and one loses a word of the song: ""[Here] the Sulphur River flows..."" It is this defect which makes the Cheezy Flicks print identifiable as being derived from the Henstooth. This one has a cute menu, featuring one of the Circes looking out the window; the window frame contains a small snatch of moving gifs featuring the Creature.

2. Sterling Entertainment (July 31, 2002) listed 85 minutes.

This print begins with the Cinema Shares International Distribution Corporation logo, something the others (except Beach) lack. The picture quality is a shade less than the Henstooth, and unlike the Henstooth, this one cuts off a couple of seconds at the end of the credits, which is maddening to a completist. Under the film title (5:40), the artifact "" 1975 Pierce Ledwell Productions"" has been electronically added. In a few sections, the sound/picture timing is a couple of seconds off - one sees the cow startle and move before the Creature screeches (13:04). Very annoying when you're watching, once you've noticed it. These defects are also found in the Beach Productions version.

3. Education2000inc (February 2, 2002) listed 90 minutes.

No doubt about it - this is the worst version, hands down (or was, until the On-Demand DVD-R came along). Picture is grainy, color bluish-green, contrast very poor, and dark - one can't make out much in the darker scenes. The print has an old, scratched ""Rated G"" bumper at the beginning. But it has one thing going for it, which might make it desirable to someone with the technical know-how to digitize, computer-enhance and improve the print: It's widescreen. But just watching it, that's a quality one can't appreciate, because the screen is compressed to fullscreen; everything's skinny. There's a small white dot in the lower righthand side of the picture that maddeningly remains for the entire film. The description claims to be 90 minutes, but it's no different from the rest - all of the versions clock in around 87 minutes.

4. Cheezy Flicks Entertainment (May 6, 2008) listed 85 minutes.

This one uses the Henstooth print, with its same identifying quirks, but has enhanced the color, resolution, and contrast slightly. As far as watching copies go, it's probably got the best picture, if you don't mind the Cheezy Flicks artifacts it imposes just after ""This is a True Story,"" and again at the end, during the credits. As a bonus, there are some very old B&W Drive In theater bumps on a menu selection called ""Intermission Time.""

5. Beach Productions (November 22, 2009) listed 87 minutes.

This one is a cheaper reissue of the Sterling, on a white paper-covered disc, with a color print copy of the case cover art.

6.  Amazon Manufactured On Demand (March 28, 2012) 87 minutes.

This one is burned onto a DVD-R, with no frills whatsoever. It is the worst of the group, even worse than the Education 2000 version, for its picture is contained within a thick black frame that occupies fully one quarter of the available screen space; the picture itself is a small window in the center. Within that window, the picture is ostensibly full screen, but figures show that peculiar narrowing that denotes compression. The picture lacks resolution, so much so that most of the names on the end credits are unreadable yellow blobs. The sound is overloud, and lacks crispness; there is a lot of hissing and popping. This version does not have the Cinema Shares International Distribution Corporation logo at the beginning, but instead an ugly ""Rated G"" in poor condition. At 1:14:45 (panther tracks under the Ford house), there is traveling tracking static moving up and down the screen, revealing that this version was sourced from a VHS tape. Amazon ought to be ashamed, especially since there is a better version out there to use as a source - the free public domain version at Archive.org, in letterbox, no less. That was the version I'd hoped they'd dressed up, polished, and burned to a disc. I could not be more disappointed.

I hope these descriptions will help the would-be collector of this film to make an informed choice from the versions currently available. Of course, it's to be hoped that a future release, with anamorphic widescreen, subtitles, and special features will someday eclipse these. I know I'd buy it. ;)",1337990400,127,4559,4.896238651102465

Can't imagine anyone but us remembers this movie unless they had the same funny memory that keeps getting a laugh every few years.

It came used and was VERY affordable, so I was able to pre-view it. While the DVD was excellent in condition, the video quality is poor, and the story is extremely slow. More documentary than anything, and not terribly engaging. It's not a great film overall but has been a funny memory between my sister and I for decades.

Boggy Creek is a very boring and nearly unwatchable movie from the 1970's that does nothing to build the suspense, mood or atmosphere that would be related to the mystery of Bigfoot sightings. The whole film is made even worse by the happy sounding bluegrass, hillbilly music and a ""Wild America"" style narrator, who sounds like he's announcing the arrival of a healthy litter of playful wolf pups rather than presenting something ominous. The one or two actual good scenes of a lurking Bigfoot are ruined by the music.

504701,1,6302623294,"While watching this video last night I kept trying to recall why I bought it.  Then I went on Amazon and decided all those 4- and 5-star reviews must have influenced me.  I also noticed the negative reviews are generally marked ""unhelpful,"" so I suspect this film has a strong cult following (like ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"") and my review will be rated ""unhelpful"" too.  This is supposed to be a documentary about sightings of a ""Big Foot""-type ""monster"" in a rural area of Arkansas.  Yet there are no scientists or other authorities interviewed. Assertions are made without support, like the claim this creature is the ""only one of his kind"" and may reappear out of loneliness and frustration. There is no critical analysis of the data.  Most of the film involves recreations of reported events, with laughable dialogue and acting.  It is not clear whether anybody in the film was an actual eye-witness. Certainly no one is asked any tough questions in an interview to try and determine whether this is a hoax.  There is absolutely nothing scarey about this movie either.  In fact, I think it had a ""G"" rating.  Overall, even if he exists, this seems to be a pretty benign ""monster,"" although they did claim that one resident's kitten was frightened to death by the creature.",1298419200,4,1276,4.737556561085973

But back when it came out Bigfoot and Evel Kneivel were King.  This movie scared the pants off me and my friends.  We weren't much older then the young boy at the begging of the movie though.

The music through the movie and the commentary throughout just has the feeling of a good, camp side ghost story.  You must remember that back then we weren't subject to hundreds of rapes and murders and incessant violence like today's tv.  Surprisingly enough we did have war coverage from Vietnam.  Some things it seems are more 'Real' to a 9 year old I guess.

So I view the movie now through nostalgia and watch it at least once a year.  My wife groans as the singer goes into 'The Ballad of Boggy Creeks' ""hey there Travis Crabtree...."", well, when you hear it you'll never get it out of your head, try as you might.

movie making has made such leaps and bounds since this one was made.  If the idea of whipping out Don Knots 'The Ghost and Mr. Chicken' once a year appeals to you, you'll need to purchase this dvd and add to your collection.  Right up there next to Robbie the Robot in 'Forbiddon Planet'.

Do I like the movie much?  When my VCR ate my worn copy that I fished out of Blockbusters 2 dollar bin years ago, I made this purchase of the DVD.  I'd do it again in a snap.  It's under 10 bucks anyways unless you get one of the special versions.

On the other hand, if you have a chance to purchase one of the next movies in the series, DON'T.  I watched the sequel once upon a time and for a Nancy Drew meets the Hardie boys and a benevolent monster being hunted by the evil, mean man it fell terribly short.  'Return to Boggy Creek' can only be described as less material and more bunk OR Boggy Creek, directors cuts.  Director cuts usually being parts of the original movie so disconnected that they were left on the cutting room floor for a reason.

Godzilla movies generally have plots a hundred times better than all of the Boggy Creek films.

I know, I collect those too.

Looking at it now...wow...make sure you have plenty of alcohol or airplane glue to sniff otherwise it's a bit tought to sit through the semi-dull fotoage of the admittedly beautiful bottomlands.  Attorcious folk music accompanies the movie, but it has its own charm I suppose.  The narator sounds less like a supposed denizen of Arkansas than Boris Karloff, instead sounding like a Fred Astaire impersonator.  The monster's scenes are well done and not overly done.  It's got just enou ghair of reality around it to be thrilling in a way.  Not unlike the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""

Still, the movie is entertaining and captures the time well.  Monsters in the swamps were all the rage in the '70s!  Though never explicitly claimed to be Bigfoot (the Boggy Creek critter only had 3 toes), later Bigfoot fans tried to make him one.  Just let Boggy be Boggy!

Mostly because this one moves in a small town documentary level, that makes you feel it could happen in your ""neck of the woods."" No, it's not in some posh swank penthouse, or decrepit house located down the street, but in the sanctuary of your backyard. That's spooky!

504893,4,6302623294,"THE LEGEND OF BOGGY CREEK is an old favorite from my movie-going youth. It's about a supposedly real beast that wanders the bogs around Fouke, Arkansas, made in the faux-documentary style that was popular for movies about cryptozoological wonders back in the late 60s and early 70s. I remember so well seeing this one for the first time when I was about 12 and being thoroughly creeped out by it. The atmosphere is distinctly eerie -- when it's not inspiring some pretty serious chuckles. It's the only movie that comes to mind that has a theme song for a character who does essentially nothing over the course of the movie except fish (""Hey, Travis Crabtree...Wait a minute for me...""). And the beast's melancholy theme (""Perhaps he dimly wonders why...there is no other such as I...To touch, to love before I die...to listen to my lonely cry ..."") is such sweet schmaltz you can't help but about be moved to tears...for whatever reason.

I gotta hand it to director Charles B. Pierce, who managed to make some of nature's most beautiful scenery appear outright sinister. The beast itself is never seen very clearly, mostly in silhouette, and is thus all the more effective. Much of the atmosphere comes from the sound effects -- often the barely heard grunting of the creature along with the chirping of insects and the sounds of birds. And the monster's roar is truly hair-raising. Its nocturnal attacks -- particularly the climactic one, where it tries determinedly to get into a house full of panicked young people bearing shotguns -- are beautifully staged, so authentic you feel like you're right there.

As much as anything in this movie, I've always loved the ending, where the narrator returns to his childhood home and says ""I almost wish I could hear that lonely cry one more time, just to be reassured that some mystery still remains in the wilderness.""

504899,3,6302623294,"Prior to the actual start of the film The Legend of Boggy Creek (1973) some text appears on the screen stating, `This is a true story.  Some of the people in this motion picture portray themselves...in many cases on actual locations', which I read into as meaning `this is an extremely low budget production and we can't afford real actors, so we're going to use some locals with the hope that the thrill of being in a real, honest to goodness movie will be sufficient compensation'.  The movie was produced and directed by Charles B. Pierce (his first), who would later go on to make such films like Bootleggers (1974), The Town That Dreaded Sundown (1976), and The Evictors (1979), titles most of y'all probably never heard of...well, neither have I, but there out there and someone's paying to see them as Mr. Pierce has produced and/or directed something like 12 features in the span of 25 years...

The film begins with slow pan shots in a boggy, swamp-like area with an extended (more like distended) sequence of nature shots, featuring what appears to be every stinkin' beaver, lizard, newt, frog, turtle, bird and mossy tree stump the filmmaker could find.  The dubbed audio played over this sequence features a lot of strange noise sounding like those of two, large gorillas fighting each other for dominance over a female in heat, or Rosie O'Donnell at feeding time (I've never heard the latter, but I gotta figure both sound fairly similar).  After about six hours of this (I'm exaggerating a little), we finally roll into the main credits, and then into the movie proper.  Through a series of re-enactments (some with actual dialog, some dubbed over by narration or what appears to be prerecorded interviews) and establishing shots, we learn of a creature, dubbed the `Fouke Monster', which has been stirring up some trouble in and around the area of Fouke, Arkansas for a number of years.  Here are some facts the film imparts;

1. It's hairy...very hairy.
2. Has three-toes (you know, everywhere else in the world where there's been bigfoot/Sasquatch sightings the creature generally has five toes on each foot...leave to Arkansonians to find one with three toes per foot).
3. Walks upright like a man.
4. Dwells along the densely thicketed, bottomlands of the region, sticking relatively close to the numerous, aquatic tributaries that populate the area, as it likes to wash its feet.
5. Like to eat prize livestock, with a particular fondness for large hogs.
6. Frightens all animals, sometimes to death (especially cats).
7. Has been shot at a number of times and hit at least once.
8. Likes to prowl about after dusk, inadvertently scaring folks witless (or scaring witless folk...).
9. Is drawn to trailer homes, tarpaper shacks, and lean-to shanties.

So what is it?  Bigfoot?  Sasquatch?  A rogue hippy?  An alien being in need of a shearing?  Or perhaps it's all a hoax, perpetrated by the town residents with an eye towards developing a lucrative tourist trade, selling monster related memorabilia like snow globes, three toed castings, and t-shirts proclaiming `My parents went and saw the Fouke Monster and all I got was this lousy t-shirt'...perhaps we'll never know, as some things in life are meant to remain mysteries (like why does the clothes dryer continually steal my socks?  Or why people think Carrot Top is funny?).

A true story?  More like carefully constructed dramatizations exacerbating already overblown events.  Now, I'm not saying none of this stuff is true, but I do wonder how much of what was related may have been the result of homemade spirits...I mean really, you can't expect me to believe any number of these distinctly ruralistic individuals hadn't partook in some stump liquor...one thing I really liked about this film was the voice of the narrator, belonging to a man named Vern Stierman, who was, at one point, the weatherman for the Texarkana-Shreveport NBC affiliate channel 6.  His voice was very smooth, almost calming, which provided a very professional tone and a good balance for a film filled with unprofessional, haphazard shots and awkward edits.  Given the variance in the methods of presenting the material, I wasn't entirely sure if I was watching a documentary, a horror film, or a hillbilly travelogue.  I say documentary, but I suppose I should preface that with the term `quasi' because it resembled such, as I got the sense much was embellished during the re-enactments...we all know events, especially those experienced under duress, have a tendency to grow over time.  And this wasn't helped much by the presentation of the creature, looking very much like a man in a gorilla suit with a Beatle wig.  I won't comment much on the acting, as it appeared director Pierce used a lot of non actors i.e. local residents in the re-enactments, most likely due to lack of funds, but I'm sure he'd say it was done in an effort to maintain a sense of veracity.  The movie does tend to run a bit long, as good deal of the material is dragged out with lingering shots, certainly not helped by a couple of pointless musical interludes smack dab in the middle of the film.  One of my favorite parts included a visit with the elderly hermit who sported a limp, caused by, as we're told, him shooting part of his foot off in a boating accident (?!)...there's a tale I'd be interesting in hearing.  Now you'd think since the man had been an isolated resident of the bottomlands for some 20 years, he'd surely back up the claims of the existence of such a creature, but he actually refutes it, saying it's a bunch of malarkey.  Another part I found entertaining was during the last re-enactment as we see a group of people occupying a lonely house, and the creature is depicted prowling about over the course of a couple of nights.  There are a few of scenes within this section showing the creature going after the same man, the last being while the man was occupying the commode (the creature tried to grab him through the window).  The narrator states it was a mystery as to why the creature was so interested in that, particular house, but I'd venture to guess it just really liked that man, as perhaps his individual scent was a mating lure.  All in all not a bad independently released feature, if your expectations aren't all that high.

I've noticed there are a few different DVD releases of this film, but the one I have was produced by a company called Hen's Tooth Video, and the cover artwork has a figure imposed on a orangish tinted backdrop of a sunset.  The full screen picture (1.33:1) looks reasonably decent, for an independent film released some thirty plus years ago.  Some areas of the print are a bit rougher than others, but it is watchable.  The audio comes through fairly clean and clear so I had no complaint there.

504900,4,6302623294,"First off, let's deal with what's true and not true here. The first thing is the title, ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"".As anyone in that part of Arkansas can tell you, Boggy Creek had no more affinity with ""The Monster"" than any number of creeks or branches in the area. Nor was there any ""legend"" (explanatory backstory) applied to that creek (and no legend at all applied to the Big Hairy Monster...it was just around the county for no known reason). Charles Pierce, the producer , just simply took a fancy to the ""wilderness""-sounding name of that one stream and hooked it up with ""Legend"" because it all went together for a ""catchy"" title that he thought would have box office appeal.

  He was right. It did.

  Nor was the ""thing"" known originally as the ""Fouke Monster"".

It's appearances had mostly been reported in a little community outside of Fouke called Jonesville, where area people referred to it as the ""Jonesville Monster"". In the early 70s, when there was a small flood of sightings out Jonesville way (particularly around the land holdings of an extended family named Crabtree),the local paper in Fouke began printing articles about the thing and these articles were picked up by news services. Because of the Fouke bylines in the press the ""Jonesville"" Monster soon got turned...against his will, no doubt...into the ""Fouke"" Monster.

  And Charles Pierce saw the possibility of turning Mr. Monster a bright shade of ""money green"" in investment potential.

  Factually, the ""whatsit"" never really did anything more than be seen by hunters (mostly assorted Crabtrees, as he showed a partiality towards their lands above others),harass dogs, get shot at, shot,stampede horses ( for ""kicks""?), wander around screaming and screeching in the bottoms, and get spotted crossing the highway every now and then by motorists

and school bus drivers. Kinda scary? Yes, true enough...but apart

from an alledged hog snatching on one occasion...the thing never did anything aggressive that was known to anyone. ""Ahhhh"", you say,"" then what about the Searcy incident with the cat? And the attack on the two couples in the house?"".

  Well all that actually happened with Mary Beth Searcy and her family was that the thing seemingly came to the edge of the yard and watched them and she saw it through the window and was screamingly terrified by it. What did IT do? Nothing really. This is nothing more, really, than a little goose-pimpler of a story. Pierce ""juices"" the incident, however, with the inclusion of a purely fabricated fiction (Searcys say it never happened)about the family's new kitten being scared to death (literally) by the booger...with a freeze-frame in the movie of a dead cat's wide-eyed face. A clever touch, but misleading.

  The big whoop-ti-do of the movie is, of course, the ""night seige"" of house of the two young couples, where the thing makes repeated appearances around the house and the home defenders have to rush out to defend themselves with shotguns. This sequence ""makes' the movie, pretty much...and hangs a note of fear onto the image of the monster.

  The truth, which the movie does NOT tell you, is much more prosaic. A local in the area had an old horse that was considered ornery and about half crazy. This horse was good about getting out of his pasture at night and running around the neighborhood raising a ruckus (snorts, squeals, etc.). He would get into people's flower beds and tear them up and do all sorts of things. Kept the neighbors complaining and irritated at his owner.

  In any event, that basket-case horse got out that night and went on one of his rants over near the Ford place ( site of the ""night attack""...where the young folks had to blast the Fouke Monster with a shotgun to save themselves). It became a known fact locally that the horse was out there that night...because they FOUND him there the next morning..fairly close to the house...dead of a shotgun blast.

  But Charles Pierce (unlike Paul Harvey) is somewhat dishonestly disinclined to tell you ""the rest of the story"" in his movie. Heck, that would SPOIL the EFFECT!!! And might pull down the box office potential!

  As a movie, ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" is quite entertaining. The overall use of non-actors and real locations and the photography and editing make it look like a real documentary (as does the cooked up narration that makes it seem it is being told by some reflective local). And it IS at least a

documentary of sorts (all the Crabtree incidents are seemingly recounted pretty much as they occurred, and the same with Searcy except for the cat business). The ""Night Seige"" is largely true (except for the discovery of the dead horse), and DOES pretty accurately depict how adrenalin-pumping panic can work on the imagination at night. The people really were scared and really trying to defend thermselves from...something. It just appears from subsequent discovery that the ""something' WASN'T the Fouke Monster. But presenting it as Pierce did, though, was GREAT cinema!!!

  Was there/is there a ""creature"" there in Miller County? I'd say so. Such things are seen from the Florida Everglades on across the Gulf states to Texas ( The Big Thicket country is the ""stomping ground"" of ""Ol' Mossyback the Wildman"" and the Honey Island Swamp Monster in Louisiana MAY be kin). A big

something ran around South Carolina's coastal Fripp Island back in the 30s and 40s. Called ""Old Salt"", it ran through a Coast Guard barracks staffed with beach patrollers one night...in the front door, out the back...and had all those worthy gentlemen in agitated excitement. From Pennsylvania to West Virginia, on to Wyoming, Idaho, and the Pacific coast, the sightings have occurred.

  People pay more attention to this enigma now, and for a lot of them this stems from seeing ""Boggy Creek"" on the silver screen years ago. It is an intriguing movie, cleverly assembled, and it can still raise the hackles a bit when you watch it. Definitely worth a look, for nostalgia value...and for for mental chew-food on what may or may not be out there in the ""real"" world.",1120262400,16,6100,4.883495145631068
504921,4,6302623294,"In my opinion, this low-budget documentary was the real inspiration behind the sudden appearance of the Maryland Sykesville Monster in the summer of 1973.  In the weeks leading up to the first sighting WBAL and other Baltimore-area stations carried a series of memorable commercials about this movie--so memorable that one of the reviewers on this page mentions one. The movie did eventually play in Carroll County theaters. It is no coincidence that a big, smelly, hairy monster--the East-Coast cousin of the Boggy Creek monster--began stalking the residents of Sykesville for a week or so about that time.  With all of that said, this documentary is pretty hokey in an old-fashioned drive-in sort of way.  However, if you're a serious student of American urban legends (and the Sykesville Monster has become just that) then you should take a look at the movie that inspired a monster to be born.

This is quite inaccurate because while the DVD release is fullscreen, the entire running time of the original VHS release (as well as the credits sequence on the DVD) was released in a ""squeezed"" anamorphic full-frame format.

The DVD is an ""un-squeezed"" pan and scan full frame version. Watch how the image pans during the long shot to follow the boy as he runs across the field in the pre-credits sequence.

There is no such pan on the anamorphic VHS release, proving the original image was supposed to be wide screen. Owners of the ""squeezed"" anamorphic VHS version who also own a widescreen monitor can use the ""strech image"" function to approximate what a properly formatted letterboxed release might look like.

Owners of the DVD must content themselves with ""stretching"" the image during the credits sequence for this effect.

By the way, does anybody know what the other two DVD releases look like? Does a letterbox version exist in ANY format?",1114732800,2,1340,4.75
504923,5,6302623294,"Fouke, Arkansas is a microscopic town located near Texarkana, by the Texas/Arkansas border. It's the kind of town you can drive through without even knowing you were there. People do it everyday. If they only knew what a mysterious place they were passing through, they might actually stop and look around for a while. Ya see, Fouke is said to be the home of ""The Legend of Boggy Creek.""

The legend is known as the Fouke Monster, a huge, hairy, three-toed, red-eyed, bigfoot-like creature, and it's said that he's been sighted in those parts for over a hundred years. It was his rash of bold appearances in the 70s, however, that inspired director Charles B. Pierce (the man behind ""The Town That Dreaded Sundown"" and ""Boggy Creek 2: The Legend Continues"") to make this B-movie that is, in fact, a legend in itself. The film is a docu-drama of sorts; a collection of reenactments of some of the more recent and horrific sightings of the creature as experienced by residents of the area. Like the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" or similar films like ""Just Before Dawn"" and ""Encounter With the Unknown,"" ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" is saturated with a highly effective, eerie atmosphere that is enhanced by the low budget, the creepy setting, the amateur acting from average looking people, and the otherworldly decade in which it was shot. The surreal music, which includes two original folk songs that greatly add to this bizarre viewing experience (one sung by the director, himself), combines with the swampy locale to transport the viewer to a dreamlike reality that can quickly turn into a nightmare at a moment's notice. The film may seem tame by today's standards, heck, during the day it's almost relaxing, but the knowledge that the stories are supposedly true can still provide the viewer with some decent creeps when seen in the proper atmosphere and setting. Despite the bookend tale of the film's narrator character, the whole thing comes off as very sincere and convincing.

For cryptozoology fans and 70's B-horror lovers alike, ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" is a must for the home library. The DVD presents the film in fullscreen format, and the picture and sound quality are less than perfect, but completely watchable. The photo gallery and production notes are nothing more than stills from the film, and the only other extra is a Filmography for director Charles B. Pierce. Still, ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" is an affordable American classic that every true film buff should own! Don't expect fantastic camera work, gripping character dialogue, or mind-blowing effects, but if you're interested in hearing some spooky tales of what might be lurking out in the woods and swamps by day, and occasionally coming by your house to pay you a visit at night, this one's for you!",1113782400,15,2795,4.906976744186046

Also what most people don't know is that the recorded howls in parts of the film are REAL!. They were taken by Pierce and witnesses though out the years before. Yes the hairy suit and acting are a little goofy but Pierce didn't have much to work with either.

Of course this movie doesn't have the greatest effects or actors but it is a great movie to sit around and watch with a nice bowl of popcorn with friends and family. I am fascinated by the Bigfoot phenomenoun and although I have never had an encounter I personally am a believer. I highly doubt so many people could see somthing that doesn't exist, unlike UFO'S AND LOCH NESS it is a very logical probability when you think about it. Anyway back to the review, this movie takes place in Fouke, Arkansas, and did I mention this movie has a great opening. It features the legendary Fouke monster and features many people who have seen the creature in an actual movie. Many raidings by the creature take place as well as a sighting by three women and a baby completly isolated twenty or so miles in the woods having a sighting(hows that for spooky), anyway they explain many different sightings and many interesting chases after the creature, who truly just wants to be left alone(they even have a sad song for the monster) in conclusion this is a good movie that I think is worth seeing, it goes out with a very good ending as well, but I won't spoil it for you, but the narrator(who saw the creature as a child)has some very good ending lines, and although the creature isn't really seen face to face it just adds to that creepy filling. The final line in the movie is ""Yes he's still here, and if your ever in Fouke and you see somthing peering at you in the woods"", or somthing like that. A movie about a true legends which like all legends will never die.",1103414400,2,1710,4.380503144654088

The weird camera angles, the creepy people, and the way it cuts from documentary to dramatization is astounding. There are some pretty intense scenes in this most significant entry into ""Cinema Du Sasquatch"" There is a great scene where these girls and a baby are in a run down cabin deep in the woods, the one girl walks outside to get a pail of water from the well and notices some movement from beyond the timber. This particular shot is so impressive it is similar to ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" style of filmaking. The scene follows with with a dynamic episode where the ""big ol' hairy monster"" is scaring the poor girls half to death. But then that scene is followed by another of the monster walking through the swamp with a nice folk song being sung about him. Its almost like half the film was directed by Tobe Hooper and the other half by Cheech and Chong.

Regardless, for any fan of Bigfoot genre-this is a must!! It is nightmarish, laughable and twisted but above all it is a very, very entertaining film.",1097884800,5,1143,4.4951923076923075
504929,4,6302623294,"The Legend of Boggy Creek is not a documentary, nor is it a grotesque horror flick or mundane drama. It's a love song dedicated to that venerable American icon, the Sasquatch, and it's a safe and enjoyable scary movie for youngsters. This tale brings us back to a time when we were able believe in such intriguing and terrifying creatures as Bigfoot. The narrator invites us to take that nostalgic journey as he recalls and recreates the ""real life"" events that occurred during his childhood in Fouke, Arkansas and connects them to more contemporary (1970s) sightings. Quaint farm folk provide eyewitness accounts of the wild man's antics in interviews conducted by the filmmaker. This documentary style lends a sort of dodgy legitimacy to the legend as well as the vague feeling that you are watching a 16mm wildlife film in an elementary biology class. This approach soon gives way to several other narrative modes such as over-dramatization and bumpkin balladry. The overall direction is just as unpredictable and uneven; going from poorly filmed and confusingly edited dialog sequences to poetic, atmospheric shots of the hauntingly beautiful environment. The acting, music and other aspects of the film are of the extremely low budget variety. If you can manage to look past the film's many faults, you can come out with some memorable moments though. At the very least, it can be quite funny when watched with a critical eye. However, with a more forgiving view one can appreciate this film's heartfelt homage to the fascinating and frightening mysteries of the Legend of Boggy Creek.

This DVD is a no frills sort of affair, but it beats trying to watch a chewed up old VHS recording of the same print. It's probably a two star film that gets a couple of extra stars out of me for purely nostalgic reasons, but since it works as both a thriller for the young viewers and an unintentionally funny cheese flick for others, it deserves about three and a half stars.

BTW - The movie being quite accurately described by reviewer T. Gates is a film titled ""Return to Boggy Creek"" which has no relation whatsoever to this film, ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"".",1096588800,6,2157,4.842818428184282

You would not believe the people that will not come to Fouke at night just because of this movie. I have never been afraid to go outside in the dark. I believe people let their imaginations run a little to wild or just wanted our little town of Fouke to have some kind of Fame. So I wouldn't come searching for the monster anytime soon. It is not really a documentary. Its just a film about an urban legend. It is pretty funny though. I garuntee you will get a good laugh at this movie, I always have.

504959,4,6302623294,"This is one of the strangest documentaries ever filmed.  Vern Stierman was a boy when he first heard the cry of the Fouke Monster.  Now he is back in town and telling the story of the elusive creature.
Fouke, Missouri is located in the Southwest corner of the state.  It has been the home of monster sightings for decades.  The monster has been dubbed the Fouke Monster.
This move is part dramatization and part documentary.  Many of the townspeople are played by themselves although Vern is not.  The movie chronicles Vern's early encounter (aural only) with the creature and the way locals slowly began to believe that there really was something keeping to the water.
At one point there is some supposition as to what the creature is.  It walks upright like a man.  It is not a Sasquatch as it only has three toes instead of five.  It is not a gorilla as it is orange.  It might be an orangutan but doesn't act like one or have the right toes.  No final theory is reached other than that enough people have seen it that it must be real.
The film looks like a low budget production and many of the night shots are quite dark.  The shots of the creature are usually shadowy or an occasional arm through a window.  But the atmosphere is seriously creepy.  Modern horror film makers could learn a lot about atmosphere from this one.
This is a wonderful film but it is not a Discovery Channel or Tim Burns documentary.  This is more down to Earth.  Look for Return to Boggy Creek.",1082332800,,1477,4.434944237918216

When I saw it in the bargain bin at WalMart I told my wife she had to see it...total classic. Surprise of surprises this has become my 2 (almost 3) yr. old daughter's favorite movie! She's not scared at all and loves the monster. She's loves it when the monster tries the doorknob on houses and can't get in (doesn't have a key). She also thinks the reason he's trying to get in is to use the bathroom (no doubt influenced by the famouse ""arm through the window with guy on the john"" scene).
If you approach this movie with the proper attitude (adults will not be scared but it can be unintentionally funny and thus entertaining) you will enjoy it. It's family entertainment...very participative. Yell ""run"" during the appropriate scenes; ask the kids if they see the monster yet; say ""did you hear that"", etc.
Elvis makes an appearance (not really but the guy in the white T-shirt with the big sideburns is pretty close). Yell encouragement to Elvis (he's not a great shot and needs all the help he can get). Scream when the women/girls scream...kids love that too and its fun for adults as well.

I didn't want that dog-gone creature to get anywhere near me!  If you are a fan of grainy 70's pseudo documentary, this is the film for you.  The chintzy 70's music, the narration, the non-actors, the bigfoot terror...it's got it all!  It would be interesting to get an update on these characters & locations from the present day.  Unbelievably, there was a sequel made in the 80's which I'm sad to say I have only caught glimpses of on TV.  It looked even chintzier than the original with a bigfoot baby that time around!  I'd love to find it on DVD one day as well just for fun.  You'll either find the original film interesting, engaging and amusing if you are into this type of thing or you'll just shake your head in disbelief and be bored to tears.  You either love it or hate it.  That seems to be the general conscensus.  I find myself to be in the first category.  Please also note that the quality is pretty sub-par...I mean it is an old beat up low budget 70's film.  This is probably about as good as it'll ever look.

504963,2,6302623294,"Although folklore suggests sightings as early as the 1850s, something has troubled the tiny town of Fouke, Arkansas since the 1940s right up to present day--and residents claim it is a tall, hairy creature with hands like a man and glowing red eyes.  And after a series of somewhat spectacular sightings in the early 1970s, director Charles B. Pierce decided to make a movie about it.

I saw LEGEND OF BOGGY CREEK in original theatrical release when I was twelve or so, and it scared the blazes out of me.  When I found this inexpensive DVD version, I grabbed it for the sake of nostalgia--and discovered that what scared me at twelve can barely elicit a raised eyebrow nowadays.  It may still frighten the kiddies, but from an adult point of view, LEGEND OF BOGGY CREEK is pretty tame and lame.

Although the film has a few effective moments, they seem to have happened by accident instead of design. The cinematography is a weak effort at a documentary style, and the costume for the Fouke monster is hardly more than a long-haired suit, but now and then they do combine to give you pause--especially in shots when the creature is largely motionless and obscured by trees.  But on the whole, the movie consists of a mix of interviews, scripted actors, and the occasional pause for some hilariously bad ""ballad of boggy creek""-type country music.

The transfer quality is flatly awful.  Made on the cheap, the look of the film was probably never great to begin with, but after some thirty years in the vault it now in a truly sorry state.  Colors are bleached, the picture is riddled with blips and scratches, and the soundtrack is occasionally crackly.  My final take on the whole thing: if this has some nostalgic appeal, by all means buy it, but don't expect too much.  And if you've don't have those childhood memories to fall back on, pass it by, because that's really all this DVD has going for it.

After hearing him speak of it for so long, I finally got the 'opportunity' to see it maybe 15 years later.  It was as cheap and crap as I'd always thought it would be, which leaves me mystified as to what people see in this colossal mess.  Just last night I picked up the DVD from the bargain bin - just in case my cynicism got the best of me when I was younger, I could view it more objectively now.

If you are expecting a documentary like you see on the Discovery channel or a horror movie of the type that you will find in the new release section of the local DVD store, then forget about getting this movie. If you are expecting this film to have you jumping out of your seat with fright then forget about it too. This is not what the film does. It lingers with you psychologically long after you have seen it and you will think twice about taking a walk in the woods as you would taking a swim after seeing ""Jaws"".
Basically it is a family documentary, with a universal rating but it is certainly not for kids.. which is how most people remember seeing it in the first place and explains why it gave them nightmares. Looking back I can see how many people can say that it was a truly frightful experience watching this movie... if you where 12 years old. In fact if you are 12 years old and want to see a tame horror movie with family values that will live with you long after you have seen it - then watch this one. If you are a parent then I am sure that this film will have your kid more interested in science and zoology than a trip to the local zoo park.
The film makers establish this little backward town out in the middle of nowhere and you get to see and listen too some very strange characters that look like they just hopped out of the movie ""Deliverance"" or ""Southern Comfort"". Then you start to hear them talk about this strange creature that just happened to be out in the woods, or making a racket in their barn, or running around the outside of their house raising all sorts of hell. Many of the different stories about the creature are reenacted but these can be a little corny at times. The print is also shockingly bad, but I think it was probably shot on 16mm or the original has gone through a lot of wear and tear.
All in all I would have to give this docu-drama 5 stars for a least documenting the local townsfolk of  Fouke, Arkansas. That alone is gold. There was also this trapper man who lived way out in the middle of a swamp and looks like some sort of a redneck guru.

Forgotten classics I am anticipating in the mail include: Humungous, My Bloody Valentine, Prom Night, Zombie, The Gates of Hell, and eagerly waiting the re-release of Halloween 3 which I saw once as a child. Only to name a few. (I know some of you might not consider these ""classics"")
The first arrival was the DVD of ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"".
I grew up in a country house on the edge of some creepy woods in Kentucky. We had our own legend of the monster in the woods. Our monster would follow you in the woods as you walked down secluded roads that were surrounded on each side by forest. I recently revisited my childhood neighborhood and drove on that road where our beloved Bigfoot, or ""White Thing"" as he was named, dwelled in the woods.
All the locals still swear that he existed. Although sightings died awhile back. My distant relatives all had a story to share of their encounters. I remember a terrible thunder storm, and my father ran outside to see who was walking around our house looking in the windows. Defying his command to stay in the corner with my sister, I decided to get up and look out the window. I saw my father struggling with a figure, a man I could not make out, in the flashes of lightning. I know it was one of the most frightening things I can remember from my childhood. My father is long gone so I cannot really know what happened that night. But he would never speak of it. Could have been an intruder, and could have been our town legend too. My mother claims to have been grabbed by the creature once in the woods near the rail road tracks that ran through the woods.
Watching ""Boggy Creek"" took me back to those times as a child on that farm in the woods.
The film is a documentary based on fact, or supposed fact. It is set in the Arkansas swamps. The events are recreated by the town folk. Something is lurking in the woods in the little town of Fouke and scaring the locals, killing their animals, peeking thru their windows at night, pawing thru the windows at them, and howling in the woods. They believe it a bigfoot type creature. I am so glad I bought this movie. The only complaint I had was the cheap costume they used for the creature and the tedious folk song in the film. I can't help but to wonder if ""The Blair Witch"" was inspired from this film.
A definite great film, although cheesy in its own charming way. But creepy and moody.

504994,5,6302623294,"I've had an interest in Bigfoot since I was a little kid, and BOGGY CREEK was one of the first experiences I'd had with Bigfoot Docudramas. There's a part in the movie where the narrator says ""I was a boy when I first heard him scream. It scared me then, and it scares me now."" Know what? It scared the bejeezus out of me too, and it still does! There's a lot of behind the scenes stuff about the making of BOGGY CREEK that makes me wonder about the integrity of its director, but personal politics aside, this is one fine example of why at 33 years of age I STILL won't go wandering around in the woods. Sure it's just a guy in a ratty monster suit, and the reenactments are sometimes on the cheezy side, but there's something about this movie that gets under your skin and stays there. If you like the Sasquatch like I like the Sasquatch, then throw away that godawful fourth-generation VHS copy and pick up this DVD. It's about as good as BOGGY CREEK is ever gonna look, and with it on disc you can jump right to your favorite scenes. Mine's the one where the monster grabs at the guy sitting on the toilet. :)",1045353600,84,1113,4.230046948356808
504995,5,6302623294,"This movie is a classic example of the beauties in independent film making. Before there was ""Blair Witch"", there was ""The Legend of Boggy Creek."" Through voice over narration and subliminal framing of setting and a monster never quite seen, Smith builds a great suspense in the movie. Even though this was shot in 1972, it is still quite remarkable how such a simple idea made such a fine movie. Of course, if you ARE NOT a film buff or interested in the intricate art of movie making, you may find this film hokey and hard to watch.

.., WOW, what a difference from the initial crummy release of this movie on dvd.  Make sure you get this one, the picture is a hundred times clearer, the sound is so much better, I felt transported back in time, like I was watching it on the big screen.  The shots of the monster are super clear. I can't express enough how this clear version makes a huge Total different watching experience then the first dvd release of this classic.  For those of you who have the crummy first release of the dvd, with the mysterious white dot in the right corner of the entire movie...guess what....it's gone!!!

505021,5,6302623294,"Okay, you can toss your bootlegs, the greatest Bigfoot Docu-drama of all time is -finally- available again, and in DVD for the first time (legit, anyhow.)
No, the print isn't fantastic, no it's not in widescreen, but it's THE LEGEND OF BOGGY CREEK, people! C'mon! You get to hear a guy wonder if maybe an orangutan was in his sweet potato patch! You get to listen to another guy who got part of his foot shot off in a freak boating accident! You get to ponder why so many people in Arkansas seem to be named ""Crabtree""!!
And that way cool SONG! How many other bigfoot movies have a love-theme for the MONSTER?!! (And there's another song about...another guy named ""Crabtree"", but hey...)
In all honesty, I'd have LOVED to have seen this restored and released in widescreen. However, I share the opinion that a widescreen print of the film may not -exist- now. At any rate, the DVD is head and shoulders above any VHS copy that's been released to date. Some of the colors come in like gangbusters at the least expected times, and you can actually see the grain on the tree bark in the darker scenes, so this is the best transfer this film has ever had, without doubt. My biggest complaint is that annoying little white speck about halfway up on the right side of the middle of the picture. What the heck IS that?
""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" is one of my absolute -favorite- films from my childhood. It has withstood viewing after viewing, it doesn't get old, it's just it's own sorta good, clean FUN. There's never been anything like it, before or since.

I see where one person gave this one star, seemingly because it isn't in widescreen: I'm a widescreen fanatic too, but just having it on DVD is good enough for me.  Widescreen would be great, particularly since I plan to get a widescreen TV, but...
I've been to Fouke a couple of times, including just a couple of weeks ago.  The folks out there are rather proud of their legend.",1026259200,,573,4.287037037037037

Ok...so it's not widescreen. Alright..there are no features.
Who cares !?!
For true fans (and first-timers) this is the best possible print available to date. I know this version is pan and scan and omits upto half the picture information but really (and widescreen purists will hate this), half a picture is better than no picture at all..!

""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" is one of those films that seen at the right time with a theatre full of other teens, complete with screams and flying popcorn, make up my one of my fondest movie-going memories.  ""Boggy"" played several times over the first 2 years after it's 1972 release to a packed house, double-showing Saturday night audience on Charleston Air Force Base.  I didn't miss one of those showings, I was hooked after the first time!  Told through the adult voice of a boy remembering the first time he heard it scream ... ""it scared me then and it's scares me now!"" ... ""Boggy Creek"" is good campy fun with a several scares, a catchy ode written to ""The Creature"", & a tour of Fouke, Arkansas complete with its charming inhabitants ... human and otherwise.  So wait no longer for before ordering this DVD treasure ... pop the jiffy pop, grab a soda, your favoirte candy, turn out the lights and gather everyone 'round the glow of the television and relive, share with a new generation, or experience for the first time ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"".

505026,5,6302623294,"After hunting this movie down in one of my local video stores, it has become a favourite, one that I pop in every now and again.  This is one that really lets you use your imagination, all to great effect.  It is told in a documentary style, with interviews from local people who claim to have seen the monster, re-enactments of monster attacks, etc.  Because it is rated G, the whole family can watch it.  I don't think there is any blood in the entire movie!  This one doesn't rely on blood and gory effects to creep people out... it taunts your imagination, making you wonder if such a thing does exist... or if it is lurking in the woods behind your house...
Now, a word about the video presentation.  I know this movie hasn't been released yet on DVD, but I really hope that it will be presented in its original 2.35:1 widescreen format.  The video tape I have manages to keep all of the image by ""stretching"" the image (much like anamorphic DVD's... only much more so), which makes everyone look REALLY REALLY skinny.  So, I know that all of the image does exist in some form, because the video tape does not resort to pan and scan.  But, a decent letterboxed presentation would be really awesome.  I know the movie was made on a small budget, so I am not expecting a totally pristine transfer, but the letterboxing (if it's meant to be) would be more than enough for me to rush out and get this as soon as it comes out!!
This is a movie for everyone... it is rated G, but don't let that fool you.  No buckets of blood and gore, but it will keep you thinking long after you watch it, and that is what makes it so powerful.  If you love a good scare, then you will want to own this.  But, I think for now, I will wait and see whether the DVD will be letterboxed before I decide to pick it up!  Ever since I first saw it, I have been hoping it would come out in a nice widescreen DVD... so here's hoping!",1022889600,7,1908,4.206043956043956

While this may be spine-tingling information to some I find that a fictional approach more aptly suits my pleasure. I prefer hideous creatures, tough-talking heroes, sexy girls (in tank tops, of course), and lots of shooting and screaming, although neither of latter two characteristics are effective from dissuading the creature.
