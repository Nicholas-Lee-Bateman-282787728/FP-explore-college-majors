8186018,5,B00008FGG5,"Since there is not an image of the video shown,I cannot be sure that my video is the same, but it probably is. My video has the same title without an exclamation point!

  There are 13 songs on this video, with of course, the two songs that were staples of FM radio in the 70s. What is unusual is that one is a female estrogen-oozing ballad: Love Hurts. The other is a male testosterone-laden rocker: Hair Of The Dog.

  Other songs are as follows: Telegram, Razamanaz, I Want To (Do Everthing For You), Boys in The Band, Beggar's Day, Dream On, Cocaine, This Mother's Messiah, This Flight Tonight, Teenage Nervous Breakdown, and Ain't Got You.",1126742400,,644,4.556521739130435
