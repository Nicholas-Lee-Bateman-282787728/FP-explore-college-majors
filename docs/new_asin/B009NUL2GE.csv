8543271,4,B009NUL2GE,This series has many funny parts. I would compare it to another British comedy titled Are You Being Served wherein John Inman also stars. As to my purchase I was highly impressed when asked to make sure this DVD was compatible with my player as I live in the United States and the DVD is compatible with UK or foreign devices. That was very helpful.,1426550400,3,349,4.384615384615385
