1356062,5,B00004UCV3,"The professional wrestling observed by PPV is also good.  However, they have what it can have only in them.  It is the soul which changes a common thing into arms or the stage and carries out Hardcore bout there.  It is heard that such backyard wrestling was performed once also in Japan.  But, coming out of the region of a mere exchange of blows did not have it.  They do not forget to also carry out Entertainment bout.  He likes a portion hardcore in appearance, and such spirit of theirs is also observed.  It is anyhow wonderful VHS.",997056000,2,539,4.438775510204081
1356063,1,B00004UCV3,"Backyard wrestling is a one-way ticket to serious injury.  If you think watching untrained teenagers maul each other in bloody mockeries of what wrestling should be, go ahead and order.  But any real fan of wrestling should stay far, far away.",991612800,3,243,4.902439024390244
1356064,5,B00004UCV3,"I've seen it all..WWF, WCW, ECW, XPW, the Japanese death matches, ...and none of it can compare to the down and dirty action found on the Best Of Backyard Wrestling Video tapes.  It doesn't surpise me that these videos are the most popular selling thing on Amazon.com...I have waited for a long time for something like this.  THANK YOU!  Please make more because I just can't get enough.  Fav scenes include: The runaway car with two guys wrestling on top of it, the flaming fire matches, human torch figfhts, the Leap of faith...HOLY CRAP!!!  BYW, RULES!!!!",970185600,3,558,4.770833333333333

7923878,1,B00004UCV3,"I am all for giving indie and amatuer wrestling talent their due, but this tape deserves no such respect.  The enormous bulk of the tape is simply teen-agers throwing each other through plywood boards and hitting each other with chairs or similar objects.  There are only two actual matches (both heavily cut, with unnamed characters) and an occassional interlude of an unattractive woman doing PG rated cheesecake poses.  That is it.  The ""backyard"" is certainly there, but you would think a tape with the word ""wrestling"" in the title would give you actual wrestling matches, right?

Actually, I probably shouldn't have such high expectations.  The teenaged ""stars"" of this movie clearly don't know anything about what they are doing.  After almost every hit you can hear loud swearing, often followed by a ""man, that hurt!""  You just jumped off a roof, smashed through a sheet of plywood and landed on your knees genius, what did you expect?!  To be fair, some of these kids clearly have excellent athletic potential and might make good wrestlers with training.  Unfortunately, the injuries they are likely to sustain from their hobby will probably end their careers before they start.

The redundant nature of this tape makes it move very slowly.  Even the cruel humor of laughing at these fools wears off quickly, and you find yourself wondering where their parents are.  The bottom line is, this tape has nothing to recommend it.  The real future kings of the ring are receiving professional quality training in wrestling schools, not pretending in front of shaky hand held cameras.",1150848000,,1588,5.011450381679389
7923879,1,B00004UCV3,"I bought this DVD used for five dollars. I paid way too much.
I was looking for the lamest DVD available on Amazon to give as a special 'gift' to a friend as part of a relentless competition to see which of us can find the worst film ever made. Although this isn't the worst film ever made (that award goes unquestionably to ""The Underground Comedy Movie"") it wins in a special subcategory called 'Group of Apparently Stupidest People Ever Put Together on One Video.' My favorite part of the DVD is in the introduction where a credit claims that these 'wrestlers' are highly trained professionals who have painstakingly striven to provide the viewer with an entertaining performance but always keep to the highest levels of safety possible. Like, for instance, lighting someone in a fish suit on fire and then realizing belatedly that a hose or fire extinguisher would be a handy thing to have around the fish fry. Brilliant.
This is, honestly, so hokey, and the stunts so ill conceived as to make it virtually unwatchable. Think of this as just a bunch of idiots trying to injure themselves and failing only through their own ineptness. I presumed that this would be intriguing (or funny, or both), but it is really just a waste of time. If you are a die hard wrestling fan, stick to known quantities: this is a mess and the visual quality of the DVD is fairly awful in most parts as it was shot by a hand held video camera by rank amateurs.  This really isn't even entertaining enough to give as a (bad) gift.",1077580800,,1511,4.555147058823529
7923880,1,B00004UCV3,"...  This DVD ain't good!  ... I thought ""Best of Backyard Wrestling, Vol. 1: Future Kings of the Ring!"" would be as real ... but it's NOT!

These punks on the video are nothin' but posers!  They rip off moves from the REAL wrestlers, make up stupid names for there characters, and fake all there injuries!  They set up these ... wrestling rings in their ma & pa's backyard, and tell all they friends to come over and watch.  ... Quit yo pretending, cause this video just ain't good!!!",1032307200,2,485,4.393258426966292
7923881,1,B00004UCV3,"Die hard wrestling fans of the world, heed my words well! DO NOT BUY THESE VIDEOS! I have seen Quentin Tarantino movies with less mindless bloodshed than this, and these videos don't even try to be entertaining. The wrestling moves used are not real, the so-called Wrestlers executing the moves are not professionals but amateurish 17-year olds giving professional championship Wrestling a black eye in the process. There is no entertainment in watching these psychos almost kill each other with sloppy piledrivers or running cheese grinders over their heads. The only thing that would make this even mildly entertaining is viewing footage of the Police Officers arresting them for assault, battery, and homicide. Evidently there is some market out there that seems to find value in this stuff, or the tapes wouldn't exist. Bottom line: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS! By doing so you would only end up supporting a bad product and paying the taxes for these freaks' medical bills - who are probably permanently disabled.",1030838400,4,1022,5.053254437869822
7923882,5,B00004UCV3,"This tape has everything a fan of hardcore wrestling could want. It shows amateurs in their backyard wrestling, except its not your daddy's style wrestling. Its hardcore as hell. People get set on fire, do backflips off the roof smashing someone threw a table, piledrived onto a car, get powerbombed and chokeslamed onto lightbulbs, and best of all they use thumbtacks and barbwire... This is not for the weak. This tape has crazy violence, and amazing stunts. If you enjoy wrestling, especially the hardcore style, you will enjoy this tape. Watch, and laugh at bloopers and other silly screw ups. My only complaint is that short segments as interludes between parts of the tape, show a blond bimbo doing poses and showing her big ugly fake breasts at the camera, as if she is somehow desired. The only reason they put this here is to up the sales with from teenage boys. But anyway, watch this if you like ECW or the Japanese Death Matches. This is some crazy stuff. 5 stars. Check it out. Oh yeah, Do not try this at home. ; ]",1029801600,3,1028,4.562162162162162
