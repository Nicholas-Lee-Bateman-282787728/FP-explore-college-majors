7751698,5,B01FRMOXBW,"A wonderful Criterion package of this Orson Welles gem (originally made for French TV). Though it's only an hour, this remains one of Welles' most suggestive and fully realized projects; it shows how inventive he could be working with a very small budget. In addition, the restoration work on the film has been superb: even in its initial release, this film has never looked as good. And the extras are enormously informative, especially the includion of the documentary PORTRAIT: ORSON WELLES from 1968. Jeanne Moreau's performance must be commended: it is one of the major performances in any Welles film, ranking with Agnes Moorehead in THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS for its intensity.",1478649600,15,684,5.171171171171171
7751699,1,B01FRMOXBW,"The single Blu Ray came in a package as big as a shoe box with a lot of stuffing, so it didn't fit through my letter box and I had to make an extra trip to the post office. There I had to pay an extra 18 Euro because the label on the package said 'Electronic Devises' and I had to pay import taxes. So this has become a very expensive order (32,30 Euro + 18 Euro) for one Blu Ray. The film is good though but this experience leaves a sour taste and I will not repeat it again. Single DVDs and Blu Ray should be sent in an envelope.",1477785600,,531,3.7927927927927927
7751700,5,B01FRMOXBW,"Another gem from the great Orson Welles: short in length, tight in construction, beautifully acted by all. The pity is that Welles never made more of the of the short stories of the Danish writer, Isak Dinesen. The Blu-ray transfer is very good. Well worth the money

7751701,4,B01FRMOXBW,"THE IMMORTAL STORY  (1968) was Orson Welles first color film and his last completed fictional feature.

Running less than an hour in length, the movie was intended to be part of a film anthology based on the stories of Isak Dinesen (the pen name of Danish writer Karen Blixen), but for whatever reason (probably lack of funds) since no other stories were filmed, it debuted as a stand alone on French television.

Welles, who wrote and directed the screenplay, stars as an elderly, wealthy merchant in 19th century Macao, obsessed with bringing to life an oft-told tale about a rich man who hires a poor sailor to impregnate his wife.  Unfortunately, Orson does not have a wife, so he sends his aide to employ Jeanne Moreau, the daughter of a man Welles had destroyed in business, to play his wife in the charade he is planning.

Its really a grim story and, frankly the soundtrack is such that it often makes understanding what the characters are saying somewhat difficult.  Certainly, if the films budget had been more, this would not have been an issue.  And, as far as the color is concerned, lets just say that Welles visions were better served in black-and-white.

Welles and Ms. Moreau, however, are fine in their respective roles.

THE IMMORTAL STORY has received a new 4K digital transfer for the English-language version of the film.  There is also an alternate French version on the disc.

Other extras for The Criterion Collection release include 2009 audio commentary by film scholar Adrian Martin,  a 1968 documentary on Welles, a new interview with  actor Norman Eshley, who appears in the film, and much more.  There is also a booklet accompanying the set, containing an essay by film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum.

7751702,5,B01FRMOXBW,"This is an extremely rare, latter day film by Orson Welles.  It was shot for French TV in 1968.  It is only an hour long, but like most of Welles's films, it encompasses the world.  Despite the fact that it was shot for French TV, it's in English (even though some supporting players are clearly speaking French, but they're dubbed in English).  It's about a rich merchant (Welles) who lives alone.  He's very rich, but morally and spiritually empty.  He decides to make a story that every sailor tells come true.  It's a boastful story, an ""immortal"" story, that sailors tell over and over again, but it never comes true, that's why people tell it.  Despite Welles's vast wealth, the story doesn't really get ""told"" (I won't say anything further).  The film is beautifully told, has a brilliant color scheme, and it's quite moving.  I recently saw the film on TCM as part of rare Orson works, so if you can catch it, please do.",1179187200,75,928,4.569696969696969
8761383,5,B01FRMOXBW,"Orson Welles' final dramatic feature to be released, like Citizen Kane, stars the late actor/director as a decrepit, wealthy and lonely businessman who realizes that his values are misplaced much too late. Both Kane and this movie's Charles Clay have hang-ups when it comes to friendship, love, intimacy, etc., but the one thing this movie highlights is that Clay never learned how to appreciate the value of a good story. In a last-ditch effort to right this wrong, Clay hires local mistress Virginie (Jeanne Moreau) and destitute sailor Paul (Norman Eshley) to reenact a local legend about a rich man who pays a sailor to impregnate his wife. One thing Clay doesn't realize is that Virginie has plans of her own that are borne from bad blood between Clay and her family. Since it's 60 minutes long and it mostly takes place at Clay's mansion, this is a particularly efficient movie, but its efficiency is in no way a drawback. Every aspect of the filmmaking from the editing to the acting give the movie a poignancy that similar movies I've seen with likely ten times its budget don't match. There's also an efficiency of emotion - this is only movie I can think of where nobody smiles - but strange as it may seem, the movie is all the better for it since all that reservation reflects how soul-crushing it is to be and to be around someone Clay. While it's not on the same level as Kane and Chimes at Midnight, it's still an engaging expression of Welles' love of stories, not to mention his frustration with having to contend with the likes of Charles Clay to put them in theaters.",1531785600,,1586,4.627659574468085
8761384,5,B01FRMOXBW,"Absolutely wonderful.  Didn't realize it at the time of purchase but written by the same author who wrote ""Out of Africa"" and ""Babette's Feast""  Danish Aristocrat Baroness Karen Christenze von Blixen-Finecke who wrote under the penname of Isak Dinesen.  Baroness Blixen had two of her books made into Oscar Nominated Films.  I'd like to caveat this statement with the following:  The Immortal Story was not widely recognized for the masterpiece which it is until long after its release. Wonderful and magical interpretation by Orson Wells who directed and starred.",1531440000,,564,5.292134831460674
