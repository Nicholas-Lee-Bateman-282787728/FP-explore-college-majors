7320772,5,B0112HPRLG,"I watched all of the Equestria Girls movies online except for Friendship Games and so far Rainbow Rocks is my favorite. I am a collector and I also wanted to watch the new movie that came out. I saw this trilogy pack and I was like ""SO AWESOME!!!"" so I ordered it. The front logo is holographic which is cool and it comes with the three films in separate boxes that fit into the paper cover. It only comes with the standard DVD (no Bluray) but that's fine. All in all though, definitely worth a buy considering it's less than $20 and you get three MLP EG movies. :)",1447977600,7,565,4.192660550458716

7320774,5,B0112HPRLG,Great movies!  All are very enjoyable with some wonderful music also!  Now at a great package price!  Too bad the blu ray versions are not also avaiable in a set.  Also still hoping for blu ray releases of the tv seasons.,1446076800,2,221,4.317073170731708
7320775,5,B0112HPRLG,"Thank you Shout Factory for sending us this DVD to review!

We have previously reviewed My Little Pony Rainbow Rocks and Equestria Girls and my kids thoroughly enjoyed those movies.  Surprisingly, my son enjoyed them all as well. Along with those two movies, Friendship Games is included in a 3 movie combo pack that will list for less than $25.  This is quite a bargain for My Little Pony fans.

Since this is our first time watching Friendship Games heres our review of it:
Rainbow Dash sent out an emergency text gathering all of the members in the band in fear of Canterlot High School being in danger.  As it turns out, it was a false alarm since Rainbow Dash only needed a replacement guitar string.  Instead of heading home right away Sunset Shimmer hangs around the portal for a little bit and catches a mysterious figure scanning the statue/portal.  Could it be someone from Crystal Prep Academy pranking their school for the upcoming Friendship Games competition?  Canterlot High School has never won a competition against Crystal Prep so their morale is pretty low until Rainbow Dash rallies everyone up with a stellar performance.  Could magic be involved in her performance?  Sunset Shimmer has been tasked to get to the bottom of it to avoid their school from being disqualified for magic use.  Twilight Sparkle is also looking into this phenomenon.

The Twilight Sparkle in this show doesnt know anyone in Canterlot High School since she is a Crystal Prep student.  However, they all know who she is and don't know why she doesnt recognize them and suddenly wears glasses.  They also discover that she has the ability to steal magic.  Will the Friendship Games go on without a hitch?  Watch to find out because Im not going to spoil it for you!

Like most My Little Pony shows, the power of friendship overcomes any misdeeds.  I like how they emphasize forgiveness and promote kindness to one another.  I highly recommend this show for kids of all ages.  While the target audience is girls, many boys enjoy this show as well.  My son included.",1445558400,2,2058,4.757062146892656
