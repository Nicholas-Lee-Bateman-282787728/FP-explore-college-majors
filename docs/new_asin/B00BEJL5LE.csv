I had many troubles with the movie playing all the way through.  I couldn't  watch the end because the movie stayed on  stuck mode. Maybe check this out to see what the trouble is. The movie itself was entertaining, but not epic. I give it a 4 star because I am a writer and I liked the theme. Thank you.",1381795200,,317,4.080645161290323
5603848,5,B00BEJL5LE,Very emotional and touching. It made me smile and cry all at the same time. Would definitely see it again.,1381708800,,106,4.35

5603850,4,B00BEJL5LE,I enjoyed the movie and great line up of actors. Very nice storyline. True to the genre of Crazy in Love. Great girls night movie.,1381708800,,130,4.24
5603851,4,B00BEJL5LE,I really liked this movie. It showed so many different perspectives of every member of a family going through what everyone has gone through life and can relate with. It was charming and refreshing. Certainly worth your time.,1381536000,,225,4.947368421052632
5603852,3,B00BEJL5LE,"""A writer is the sum of their experiences. Go get some."" William Borgens (Kinnear) is a famous and best selling author who hasn't written anything since his wife left him three years ago. He is raising his two children who are also trying to become published. While his children are trying to figure their lives out William is stuck between trying to move on with his love life or keep waiting for his ex to return. This is a movie that I had high expectations for basically because I really like Greg Kinnear. This movie is very much like Crazy Stupid Love in tone so if you like that movie you will like this one as well. The acting in this is great as would be expected and this is a very real life type movie. Everyone in this is flawed but nothing to outrageous or unbelievable. That fact alone made the movie seem real and grounded. There really isn't much I can say without giving things away but I do recommend this and I did like it a lot. Overall, fans of Crazy Stupid Love will really like this. I give it a B.",1381104000,,1021,4.241025641025641
5603853,4,B00BEJL5LE,"""Stuck In Love"" (2013 release; 96 min.) brings the story of the Borgens family. As the movie opens, we see Bill Borgens (played by Greg Kinnear) secretly looking inside the house of his ex-wife Erica (played by Jennifer Connelly), who left him a few years ago to marry a younger guy. We learn that Bill still isn't over Erica, and is ""stuck in love"". We also meet their daughter Sam (played by Lily Collins), a college student who somehow managed to publish a novel with a major publishing house, and hence following in the footsteps of her dad. Sam is all tough on the outside when it comes to love and relationships. Then there is their son Rusty, a HS kid who also aspires to become a writer and who has a crush on Kate, a seemingly unavailable girl in his class. Lastly, we get to know Tricia (played by Kirsten Bell), Bill's occasional girlfriend, and who is trying to coach Bill back into the dating scene. Will Bill and Erica get back together again? or will Bill find success in the dating scene? or both? will Rusty win the love of Kate? and what about the toughness of Sam? To tell you more would ruin your viewing pleasure of this plot-heavy movie, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the feature debut of writer-director Josh Boone, who brings us a pleasant rom-com, even if at times it's played too safe in my opinion. In fact, the movie stands out for me for the acting performances. I almost always enjoy Greg Kinnear, and likewise for Jennifer Connelly, and I did here again. But the bigger surprise here is Lily Collins (daughter of Genesis singer Phil Collins). When she makes her first appearance in the movie, I thought for a second or two ""wow, Jennifer Connelly looks so young!"", only to then realize it was not Connelly, but Collins does in fact looks like a replica of Connelly 20 years ago. And it's not just the looks, as Collins carries a big part of the movie on her shoulders, and with ease. We surely have not seen the last of her (she also stars in the upcoming ""The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones"" in a few weeks). Last but certainly not least, the movie features a great soundtrack of indie music, scored by Mike Mogis and Nathaniel Walcott (from Bright Eyes), with some new songs and also a few older from Bright Eyes and others (at one point one of the HS kids gives a Bright Eyes CD as a Christmas gift--do teenagers really still buy CDs?).

Bottom line: take this movie for what it is: a pleasant rom-com that is as utterly predictable (as to the plot) as it is enjoyable (as to the performances). This movie showed up last weekend at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati without any pre-release hype or advertising. I figured this won't play very long so I went to see it today. The screening that I attended was attended okay, but certainly was not packed. If you find yourself in the mood at some point for a lighter and pleasant film where you don't get challenged whatsoever and all the work is being done for you on the screen, go ahead and check out ""Stuck In Love"", be it in the theatre or on DVD.",1375142400,10,3106,4.428321678321678

This was a very good movie about four members of a family each with their own story line (well, the ex-wife less so) as they try and pull their lives together and find happiness.  My only issue (and this isn't much of a spoiler... but be warned), I wasn't completely sold on Kinnear's 19-year-old daughter being a published author.  Other than that, the story and actors were all very believable.  There's comedy, there's drama, there's romance.  4.25 / 4.50 stars.",1513900800,,479,4.72289156626506

There is also something important to be said for even stubborn love in a troubled relationship, because in my experience people are too quick to give up, especially if they are distracted by an attractive mirage.

5604152,5,B00BEJL5LE,"So I was browsing Netflix, looking for something to watch. I have had no encounter with this movie before tonight. I read the description, and figured that I'd give it a whirl, and wow was I blown away. I absolutely adored this movie.

So it has a premise, but I kind of liken it to Crazy, Stupid, Love where it's just more multiple character arcs of different family members, and what's going on in their life than an actual 'plot'. It's one of those where there is a plot, but there's also kind of not. Essentially what's happening is it's been two years since the mother (Played by Jennifer Connelly) cheated on the father (played by Greg Kinnear). Because of this, the family is a little broken, and it's just going through how each of them have dealt with it since it happened.

Josh Boone, who both wrote and directed the film, did an excellent job. I thought that the writing was excellent, and the direction was good as well. But what really made this movie shine in my opinion was the acting and the chemistry between the characters. The writing was excellent, but the chemistry between each of the characters was so authentic. Most turned in a solid performance, but I was especially impressed by Lily Collins and Nat Wolff, who play the daughter and son respectively. Not only did they interact extremely well with other, but I was very impressed by their performances individually as well.

Parents: I don't know the 'official' R rating, but content-wise, it's mainly just language. Quite a few F words throughout the movie, as well as some sex (No nudity, just seeing characters thrusting or implied sex). Honestly though, I would wait until kids are older if they're interested in watching. Not due to the subject matter (That's totally up to you as a parent whether or not you feel that the subject matter is appropriate for your children), but due to the complexity and the message that it's trying to send. I assume it would most likely be teenagers that would have any sort of interest, but I would advise having them wait until they are older, simply so that they can really appreciate what is going on in this movie. Just my two cents :)

Sadly, I think that this will be one of those hidden gems that will go unnoticed by many. I was one of those, it came out in 2012 and I hadn't heard of it until about two hours ago when I stumbled upon it on Netflix, and it instantly has become one those movies that is just dear to my heart, because I can relate with the subject matter so closely. You're only with these characters for 90 minutes, but they're some of the most emotional and heart breaking 90 minutes of your life. I would highly recommend this movie to all. It has a great message but also avoids your standard romantic drama cliches for the most part. Watch it, you won't be disappointed :)",1470960000,,2819,4.52156862745098
5604153,3,B00BEJL5LE,"Sometimes in the heat of summer you reach for a light-hearted comedy, lets call this one under review, Stuck on Love, a romantic comedy since the trials and tribulations of failed and budding romance are central to anything comedic about the film, for the same reason that you reach for summer- lite reading. You know those thrillers, mysteries, and private detection novels that are an easy read and quick too. That was my reaction to this film after viewing on one hot summer night when one more of a recent string of heavy foreign films thick with social meaning and classics status were just too hard on the head, too hard to digest against the summer doldrums.

The plot line on this one is simplicity itself. A well-known and apparently successful considering the house on the beach he resided in, novelist, Bill played by Greg Kinnear, two years after having suffered divorce from the mother of his two children which he had custody of, Erica played by Jennifer Connelly, still had it bad, still had not moved on, was still stuck in love if you want to know. He lived and acted like Erica was coming back, that not all the hopes he had for the future were for naught.  So interspersed throughout the film were  scenes between the two which dealt with the coming together and moving apart of that possible return that everybody in the audience knew was  going to be end result of this one. See Erica had waited for him once when he wandered off the reservation and Bill firmly expected her to do the same-when she came to her senses despite her re-marriage to some light-weight guy.

Of course plotting the build-up to the grand finale of a stuck in love film based solely on our writer friends expectations would leave very thin gruel for our viewing pleasure. So to fill out the story we are taken up close and personal on the ups and downs of the love affairs of those two young adult children, who surprise, surprise are both chips off the old block, both wannabe writers, one the daughter who already had a book contract and publication (despite not having on screen anyway lifted pen to paper, or better fingers to word processor for one minute). So we get a high school romance between the sensitive guy son, Rusty, who fell for some dime store sister cocaine fellow classmate, Kate, and Sam who despite her wanderlust hook-up and love em and leave them guy existence fell for a guy, Lou, in her class at college. Sam who had before Lou had been happy to wander and not be touched by love after Erica left the household and who felt betrayed by her.

Naturally all these interpersonal tensions (except the one with Rusty and Kate since she was in rehab and so a serious question mark) also got resolved when Mom and Pop were reunited at the Thanksgiving dinner table. No high cinematic credentials and certainly no high literary credentials for the contrived story line here although Pop quoting from the great short story writer Raymond Carver from one of his most famous stories and some very good sound track songs meant that I could not totally hate the effort. A great film for a very hot, humid summer evening, okay.",1468800000,,3135,4.60931899641577

5604290,3,B00BEJL5LE,"I was interested in Stuck in Love (2012) because of the writer/director Josh Boone (his debut), who went on to direct, but not write, The Fault in Our Stars two years later. I was impressed with the latter, especially with the main characters played by young stars, so I decided to try Stuck in Love, which turned out not bad, but a little disappointing due to the uneven writing.

Greg Kinnear is Bill Borgens, a successful writer whose ex-wife Erica (Jennifer Connelly) left him three years ago and now is living with another man. Bill cannot forget Erica, so he sneaks into the backyard and spies on her. But in his beautiful seaside house Bill has a casual sex with a jogging neighbor played by Kristen Bell). Well, why should we care?

Bill has two children Samantha (Lily Collins) and Rusty (Nat Wolff). College student Samantha is an aspiring writer, a gifted one it seems, as her first book is being published by Scribners. Rusty, envious of that, also keeps a journal, and his father says what he needs is experience. So what will Rusty do? The answer is obvious.

The film covers love stories of them, of Samantha cynical about love, and Rusty not quite so. Logan Lerman plays Lou, who is attracted to Samantha.

Like Almost Famous,, it has a cast of talented players, young and veteran, but characters do not convince. We are supposed to believe that the Borgens has three talented writers, but despite the frequent references to literature and rock music, as well as endorsement from Stephen King (who appears  voice only  in a cameo), none of them looks like one.

Stuck in Love is, in short, a romantic comedy trying to be different by being intelligent like Cameron Crowes semi-autobiographical drama, but fails because of the clichd narrative and unbelievable characters. The film follows three love stories, but not with enough character development that is often done in a heavy-handed way. Stuck in Love has its moments thanks to the fine acting from the cast, but the slick film, maybe too slick, doesnt know how to make use of it.",1439337600,,2051,4.74438202247191

I wanted to see Greg Kinnear but after twenty minutes I had to turn it off. I feel sorry for actors like Kinnear who have talent and can play a variety of roles, but because of the demand for unimaginative, predictable, bland stories these days, he doesn't have much to choose from in the way of scripts. And the poor guy's got to work just like the rest of us. So he accepts these 'stock' character roles in these movies made for people with no imagination, just to keep his name out there.
I turned this off and put on another Kinnear movie where he actually did some acting in a compelling story with other fine actors: ""Auto Focus"".",1436054400,,801,4.647887323943662

This movie filled me with so much emotion that I cried quite a bit. I know that sounds sappy but the movie was just really well done. The cast was very well chosen and their acting was also extremely good. The movie is one of those movies you need for your movie collection. I would recommend the movie to everyone within the appropriate audience. Though the movie is rated R it really wasn't that bad, not like another movie I like very much, Love Actually, there was frequent swearing and sex scenes but I think people are use to seeing scenes like that because it seem to appear in movies more now a days. Some parts about the movie seem unrealistic and uncommon in divorce, but is also what everyone in that situation hopes for whether its the kids or one of the parents, if that makes any since at all.

Probably because it wasn't the usual feel good happy ending sort of plot but more the message that if you really believe in true love they will cheat on you, die, or both. But if your cynical and don't believe that it's possible then somehow it just might work, sounds kind of a screwed up to me ! The acting for the most part was ok, but it felt like a very long 11/2 hours. The movie appeared to be searching for a heart and soul that it somehow just couldn't find. No comparison to some of the epic love stories like Love actually or Kate and Leopold which have much more sweetness and romance to them.

The chemistry between these actors and actresses is phenomenal. Very underrated and a very great journey. If you liked Perks of being a wallflower, this movie is on your must see list. One of the better movies I have seen in sometime, and may even make it in my top 10. The content of this movie may be rated R, but it isn't a wild movie.

5604739,2,B00BEJL5LE,"I wanted to love this film.  Greg Kinnear is one of my favorite actors.  I had several issues with the movie, though (in no particular order):

1.  So many parts of the movie were unbelievable.  The father is a writer who hasn't had anything published in over 2 years, yet he lives in a sprawling 3-story beachhouse.  His wife left him 3 years ago, but he thinks she'll return, so he still sets a place for her at the dinner table every night.  Really?!  He also goes to her new house and peeks in her windows.  Are we supposed to find that endearing rather than just plain creepy?

His kids are both writers.  The 23 year old daughter is published, and the 16 year old wrote a piece that was so awe-inspiring that Stephen King called him on the phone and said he loved it.  Yeah, right.  The daughter is a cynical b*tch who tells a young man at a bar how he has absolutely no chance of ever dating her because she doesn't believe in love.  But she finds out his mom is dying of cancer and all of a sudden she falls in love with him.

The mom spends more than half the movie telling the dad that he needs to get over her, that she will never take him back.  But then on Thanksgiving day, the doorbell at his house rings and...you guessed it....the mom is there asking for another chance.  Good thing he's been setting a place for her at the table for 3 years.  Cue the sappy music.

2.  The film was slow.  Many times I was tempted to fast-forward.  At times I found myself checking my e-mail while watching it.

3.  Too many plotlines:  The marriage problems with the mom and dad, the son's girlfriend who has a drug problem, the daughter who is afraid to fall in love, the daughter's book being published caused son to be envious, the neighbor who jogs over to the dad's house daily to have sex with him, the daughter's boyfriend's mom dying of cancer.  Too much was crammed into a single movie.

All in all, it wasn't a horrible movie, but not one that I certainly recommend.",1391990400,,1978,4.275675675675676
5604740,4,B00BEJL5LE,"I'll be honest, unless someone had mentioned I watch Stuck in Love, I may have totally missed this gorgeous gem. This title really didn't appeal. But then, if you look closer, while Kristen Bell hasn't always made great movie choices (and I've watched them all as I rate her comedy highly!), Greg Kinnear's overall filmography is solid and Jennifer Connelly's is outstanding. Stuck in Love must have had something to bring this cast together, I thought.

It is a movie about love. The performances are heartbreaking and honest. Connelly bring her usual pathos, and the kids played by Lily Collins and Nat Wolff are perfect. It's gorgeous, it's messed up, but never cheesy.

I  did not think I would enjoy it because it was based on a family of book/novel writers. I am married with three kids and often ponder how things could be different. This was a great story about family, children and how life never goes as planned.

Greg Kinnear is appealing as always, and a phone-in cameo by Stephen King is a delight, as is an introduction to beer-can turkey. Jennifer Connelly is severely under-utilized here, but she is easy on the eyes. Other than, that, it's a well-acted by routine movie about a family of dysfunctional writers. Rent for a holiday family get together; it's a good way to nod off from turkey overdose.",1391385600,,468,4.936708860759493
5604755,5,B00BEJL5LE,Very nice movie if you like Romantic comedy... It keeps you guessing how things will end with the characters of the movie and how the story will unfold.. Nice ending too..,1391212800,,171,4.548387096774194
5604756,3,B00BEJL5LE,"Someone once said ""You cannot dictate to something its nature."" It is what it is and we are who we are. For my dollar that's what this movie was about.

Here's the scoop. Bill Borgens (Greg Kinnear) is an award winning author. His 17 year old daughter is publishing her first novel and his son is writing poems and short stories. The daughter is promiscuous. She holds all men at arms length and uses them strictly for sexual gratification. The son has a thing for a girl with real baggage, He figures his love will get her to shake some of that baggage. Dad is divorced and waiting for his ex to reconsider. He figures he'll hold tight and one day she'll realize her mistake and return. Can these folks find their way in the world?

I guess you could call this and Indy flick but with Kinnear, Jennifer Connelly, Lily Collins and Kristen Bell in attendance this is a bit closer to Hollywood than to Indy. I did enjoy it but it all seemed so obvious. And the need for the director/writer/producers to wrap it up so nice and neat at the end really irked me. Life is not art and art is not life but this could have (should have) been much more subtle. All these people trying to change those around them and all with a specific character framed from specific incidents just didn't ring true. I liked much of the dialogue and it was dotted with some nifty Indy tunes from the likes of Bon Iver and the National. It was nicely (subtly) shot and edited. It was all handled well but it suffered from a script that was too self aware.

I can't tell someone to avoid this movie because, for all its faults, it was a pleasant view. I liked the characters and all did well in their roles. Just don't set your hopes too high.",1391212800,,1714,4.316770186335404
5604757,4,B00BEJL5LE,Greg Kinnear excels in this movie as he often does in family crisis films. I like that it is about a family of writers. The little cameo of Stephen King's voice on the phone was an added perk. oh yes Kinnear's character is still stuck on his wife but if yer gonna call it predictable that's kind of ridiculous because there are only two options she comes back to him or she doesn't. That's a 50/50 choice unless she gets run down by a car..Oh how cutting edge.(being sarcastic) The movie centers a lot on how much the divorce damaged these children and that is an important message.

5604845,2,B00BEJL5LE,"A  promising cast isn't able to inspire much interest in or sympathy for their broken characters, and the essential unreality and  contrivance of this dysfunctional  family as they limp toward a fairly pat denouement  makes it a cold and distant experience for this viewer.  It's not exactly a very romantic rom-com, nor is it especially funny, so what is it?  What they used to call  a ""drawing room"" movie, I suppose.

There isn't much emotion that doesn't feel forced, not much sweep, and precious little spark. Kinnear is capable of more humor than this script gives him to work with, and his compulsion to reduce all life's experiences to story-fodder is creepy in its detachment from basic humanity; Connelly mopes and looks doleful most of the time, hardly a stretch for her abilities; Wolff plays stoned even when his character isn't; pretty Lily Collins may have the most screen time and at least looks like she *could* be Connelly's daughter (nice bit of casting there), but her character is relentlessly jaded, cynical, and emotionally retarded despite her surface breeziness and sass.  Other minor characters are cyphers, and with the exception of Lerman's nice-guy boyfriend wannabe,  it's very hard to feel close to any of them.  And there seems to be more than a little wish-fulfillment fantasizing going on with this film -- I mean,  writer-director Boone actually centers this movie around an entire FAMILY of writers -- not only is dad an admired author (who seems to be able to go two years without writing anything new and still afford a large beachhouse on the seashore), but his daughter (Collins) is on the verge of publishing her first book (destined to be a big hit, obviously), her love interest Lerman is a fellow writing student, and son Wolff is an aspiring poet/novelist.  None of them seem to have agents yet they are all living in the writers' dreamworld of instant fame, success, casual flings, and the avoidance of day jobs.  Oh, were this only the case.  Stephen King's cameo voiceover is especially beyond the beyonds (""Hey, I loved your story!"" he tells Wolf over the phone) and he deserves to be pummeled with thousands of unsolicited manuscripts after this. I am wary of first-time director-writers like Boone, who regards this project as ""his baby"" and has drawn heavily from his own background for characters and incidents.  I can't help but feel some people ought to be in therapy working out their problems rather than inflicting them on the rest of us via the entertainment media. Maybe a moratorium should be proclaimed on the ""Write what you know"" approach, because we sure have way too many angst-ridden suburban-privilege stories being written and filmed by too many miserable well-off whiners.

The usual heavy-handed soundtrack (oh, these tyrannical dictates to the iPod generation), with the standard ubiquitous and mostly dreary pop tunes, dominates and telegraphs, browbeating the viewer with ""serious"" moments, or ""tender"" moments, rather than the dialogue or the actors carrying these emotional peaks and valleys.  This lazy sonic shorthand is used as a crutch by far too many directors and producers and is a reason why so many of these movies wind up looking like long movie trailers or other commercials.  Despite being clearly told by the directors what and when to feel,  I never really cared about these characters, with their prickly personalities, their privilege (I don't know, maybe it's normal for today's high school  and college students to have plenty of money for clothes, cars, drugs, and not need to earn a mundane  living),  their lack of awareness, their sense of entitlement and immaturity, casual vulgarity, and empty souls.

So beyond the problem of appealing to non non-struggling authors, are any of these people very engaging, interesting, or worth our involvement?  My feeling was, ""No, not very.""  The story takes the usual twists and turns, well signposted, to suggest stock character-building and formulaic development but it all comes across as forced or convenient.  Maybe there are too many plotlines to fit into a 90-minute movie -- many events seem rushed, and we never learn the fate of Rusty's girl, the troubled Kate, or how Dad disposes of his zipless-eff neighbor, or exactly what Erica has done to sever ties with her second husband -- but I was glad to reach the predictable end when it came, never mind putting up with another act.

I must note the prominence here of short, two-line, nonsubstantive  glowing reviews. Is this another example of corporate promotion of products on Amazon by marketing agencies paying for sock puppets? Or is the audience for this movie about ""Writers"" unable to craft a review much beyond the 20-word minimum?  Gosh, writing IS hard work after all!",1389571200,,4777,5.010126582278481

I rented it because of the great cast, and knowing it was a movie about writers.  All of the characters bring something to the table.  Each personality stands out from the others.

Movies with three different story lines can be done badly, but this one was done well.  Since the three couples (the college girl Samantha, the high-school student Rusty, and Kinnear/Connelly as parents) are all a part of the same family, there is a connection that is often lacking.

The thing I love best about the film is the script.  It is honest, heartfelt, and surprisingly jarring at the right moments.  Each of the actors makes their lines not feel rehearsed.  I feel it is the type of film that can be enjoyed by a twenty-something like me or a more mature viewer.

Are we really expected to believe both teenage children of a famous author have published works of their own?  It's absurd.  They show no signs of the maturity, work ethic, or even life experience it would require to be great writers.  The worst moment was a personal call from Stephen King to the 16 year old to tell him how awesome his story was...as if they weren't all bloated and self important enough.

While the underlying familial issues and dysfunction are obviously true-to-life, the writer does push credulity with regards to the contexts in which these issues and dysfunction emerge. For example, the daughter/writer character is way too cynical, streetwise, and worldly to be believable. Has she really experienced so much of life at the age of 22-23, that she can speak with such authority, wisdom and disrespect to her peers and her parents? I don't think so. Which makes the fact that she's written not one, but two publishable books an even greater stretch. To the writer's credit, this character undergoes a transformation-thankfully, which in the context of film, provides a dramatic turn.

5605031,1,B00BEJL5LE,"In LA Stories Steve Martin talked to a magic light post.  The movie established right away that it was taking place in an alternative universe.  When movies establish this film characters can engage in behavior that promotes romantic fairytale  stereotypes while winking to the audience that ""this is not real life.""

Stuck In Love, a family drama comedy, promotes some absolutely unhealthy messages while grounding the movie in a here-and-now reality.  This, to me, is annoying in the extreme.  What kinds of messages is this movie sending?

To Nice Guys - If a woman tells you in a brutal and honest way that she is only interested in sexual hookups, she is not interested in relationships and she is most definitely not interested in sex or a relationship with you what she is really saying is ""Pursue me with more vigor!"".  And if you have a backstory with enough pathos she will most definitely realize what a mistake she made in rejecting you.

To Pretty Young Woman - If you are outwardly beautiful enough you can be as mean as you want to nice guys and they will continue to pursue you until you get bored of the hook up and truly want a nice guy.
To Ex Husbands- If you truly feel you and your former wife were ""meant to be together"" it is okay to sneak onto the property she shares with her current husband and peak through the window while they argue and have make up sex.  It is okay even when your adult children tell you what you are doing is stalking and that you are delusional.  It is okay even when the current husband is a gym owner who is fit enough to whoop your behind in fifteen seconds.

To Ex wives - When you know your ex-husband has an unhealthy obsession with you it is okay to look him in the eye wistfully and admit that you wonder whether or not you made a mistake in leaving him even though, the sentence before that you were telling him how important it is that he move on.

To Current Wives - It is okay to take 30 minutes out of your jog each morning to have sex with the neighbor who is not your husband, all the while telling him how important marriage is to happiness.
To cokehead teenage girls - It is okay to try to treat your substance addiction by making a nice boy into your boyfriend.

That last message was actually tolerable because A) It did not work out well and B) It is realistic that the adolescent brain would believe that something like that would work.

It is the behavior of the adults in this movie that sends the kind of messages that are the total opposite of what people should do to achieve healthy relationships. And that would be tolerable too if the behaviors were not presented as cute, funny or endearing and the consequences of the behaviors were not happy, tiddy endings all around.  If the film wanted to be a fairy tale, the universe of the film should have been set long ago in a land far away.",1385596800,8,2864,4.375471698113207

5605063,4,B00BEJL5LE,"You know, after the first 10 minutes of this particular movie, I was not sure I was going to like this movie. But Readers stay calm. Stuck In Love Is a movie to watch.

Meet Bill (Greg Kinnear): Bill is a well known author and father of two. Samantha( Lily Collins) is Bill's daughter also a writer like her dad. Rusty, (Nat Wolff) is Bill's son and also writes from time to time.

The story in this movie is dramatic thanks to the many great performances by each individual actor. Each emotion the character in Stuck In Love has whether it be: happiness, sadness, loneliness, etc. you feel it right with the character. Watching this movie reminded me of why movies like Perks of Being a Wallflower, even The Descendants hit home when I watch them. The situations present in this movie feel real and are actually relatable for myself believe it or not. I will not call Stuck In Love absolutely amazing or super terrific, but it is definitely one of this years independent films that is well acted, well sequenced and very well scripted. Glad to have watched this movie.

I have probably watched the movie ten times this year so far. The reason that I love the movie so much is that it marvelously runs through the whole gambit of human emotions and makes you want to laugh in some parts and laugh in others. The movie has such a quality and evokes such a positive emotional response that it makes me feel very human, and happy to do so. I think the quote from  Raymond Carver that is used in the movie more than adequately explains the main theme of the movie: ""I could hear my heart beating. I could hear everyone's heart.

 I thought the story was great. Poignant. I saw a reviewer say it was not complex, and that person obviously does not know about love and loss and reconciliation.

Best of all, it has a great ending. I loved it!

A writer/director made it...such talent! And a single vision. Films suck because of too many people with too many visions. Good job! Kudos!

There is a lot of bad language and drug use by teens. I guess I overlooked those things because of the richness of the story and the characters. I wouldn't want a teen to see this or even a YA, it does require some maturity to separate these offensive elements. I still think it was poignant---the scene where he is watching his ex-wife through the window was done so perfectly. A subtle hand, which I like.",1382832000,2,975,4.517045454545454

5605185,4,B00BEJL5LE,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

As human beings, we look at love as this all-important feeling that dictates our happiness. However, in reality, love is an unfair and complex concept that isn't easily accessible. There are people who go their entire life without finding ""the one"" and there are others who seem to hit the jackpot on their first try. Still, even after all the heartbreak and all the suffering, most never give up hope. It should come as no surprise that love is a constant topic in the rich-indie Stuck In Love, but there's definitely more to it than that.

Stuck In Love follows the Borgens family, a complex group of individuals with a huge passion for the literary arts. Bill Borgens (Greg Kinnear) is a novelist who's been struggling for three years after his wife Erica (Jennifer Connelly) left him. While together, Bill and Erica birthed two children; Sam (Lily Collins) and Rusty (Nat Wolff). The former is in college and is in the process of getting her first novel published. The latter, on the other hand, is a high school student who suffers from a lack of life experience. While Bill, Sam, and Rusty may each be going through their own personal issues, there is this unbreakable bond between the three of them due to their love of writing.

The unique thing about this film isn't necessarily its story, but in the way that story is told. Because these three family members are living very different lives, they aren't always going to be in the same room together. Instead, the narrative is strategically organized so we follow each individual separately. For the most part, the story follows Rusty, then Bill, then Sam, and the ending ties them together. When it was all said and done, it was clear that each of them had experienced their own personal transformation and it was the result of everything we witnessed them go through.

In fact, what I found most impressive about Stuck In Love was this character development. For example, at the beginning of the film Sam is very cynical about love and she considers herself to be a ""realist."" However, by the end of the story she does a complete 180. Part of this is due to her meeting Lou (Logan Lerman) and part of it is due to her learning new information about her parents' relationship. It was amazing to see such a huge change that felt both natural and genuine. No matter who you are, there are going to be events that are going to alter the way you think, and I believe this film did a wonderful job of showing that.

Another thing I really loved was the way the actors made you connect with their characters. Specifically Collins and Lerman, who probably have the two most emotionally unstable characters from the entire cast. Both Sam and Lou are struggling with some heavy issues that go beyond the simplicity of Bill and Rusty's problems. Now that's not to say their problems aren't significant, but Sam and Lou's are more grand in their scope. One is suffering with severe trust issues while the other has a very ill mother. In the end, I think this is what allows the audience to connect on a deeper level and it allows these individuals to feel more three dimensional.

That's not to say the film is perfect, though. The way the story is structured results in the film feeling a bit uneven and unfocused. There were times where I was watching one thing unfold, but then we jumped to another character and it broke the flow of the actual story. Also, some of the characters -- like Kate (Liana Liberato), Rusty's love interest -- were severely underdeveloped. This is another individual who seems to be going through a really tough time, but the writers never do much to expand beyond just telling you what's wrong with her. I also would have liked to have seen more from Lou, but he at least felt fleshed out in comparison to Kate.

Finally, as a whole, the cast was very enjoyable. During some of the more emotional scenes things did get a little rocky, but there weren't many of those so it didn't hinder the experience too much. Also, I personally felt that each character was perfectly cast. Even the minor roles like Tricia (Kristen Bell) and Jason (Spencer Breslin) -- when was the last time you saw him in something? -- were flawless. In fact, I think this is one of my favorite roles from Bell. She may not have had a lot of screen-time, but her character was so... spunky.

Overall Score: 7.9/10 - Stuck In Love is far from perfect, but it's still very enjoyable. It has a nice cast of characters and the story is well thought out, but it is a bit uneven and some of these characters could have used some more attention. With that said, though, I really enjoyed it and I think there's a lot to love if you choose to give it a chance.",1382572800,,4753,4.570422535211268
5605186,4,B00BEJL5LE,"Greg Kinnear always gives a good performance in his movies...in this one he is a Father, a Widower and how he deals with both makes the story line relative to today's relationships and complications within a family...I liked it ....it was real....and I would recommend it to all the Greg Kinnear fans.",1382572800,3,301,4.8076923076923075
5605187,2,B00BEJL5LE,"Is anyone else tired of watching movies about dysfunctional families where the parents act ""cool' by allowing their children to smoke pot, drink alcohol, toss around ""F Bombs"", and discuss their sex lives? Apparently that is the Hollywood film industry's version of sophisticated, hip parents instead of the reality where those kind of horrible parents would be turned into social services!

 I found no redeeming characters in this lame film except for Louis, who is mocked by his girlfriend for having ideals and family values. The girlfriend played by Lily Collins was just vile, and I got the distinct impression that she is fairly close to that character in real life. The other thing that puzzled me in this film was the fact that Jennifer Connelly was trotted out yet again as the stunning, unattainable ideal of womanhood, as she is in so many films; I find her quite average-looking and anorexic, myself.

 This movie is billed as a romantic comedy, while I found nothing funny here. It's just a run-of-the-mill drama with a few sweet moments thrown in. (On a side note, Patrick Schwarzenegger has a small role in this film, which clearly his parents helped him get. He is no great shakes as an actor, and his entire part was to utter several ""F Bombs"" and shove a girl to the ground. I hope his mother Maria inspires him to be better than that in real life, as his father isn't exactly a role model.)

Boasts an all star cast with believable and mostly likable actors that in the end gives you a Hollywood ending towards most of the romances which some cynical Americans will despise. Rampant themes about love, holding on to hopeless dreams, forgiveness, curing old wounds and opening yourself up to life experiences to become a better writer.

I believe this movie is a great film of an American family--given, a very intelligent, overly cynical American family that's either at the brink of collapse, or at the point of return, you never know until the end.

It deals with real issues, friendship, love, romance, familial strife, and living under the shadow of a great parent.  The dynamics and character play beautifully off each other.  The writer and director of this film would go on to direct some very praiseworthy works and this was his debut work.  Give it a try if you haven't already.  It's a fun and emotional movie that you won't regret getting.",1525046400,,939,4.763975155279503
8567229,5,B00BEJL5LE,"I love this flick! Greg Kinnear is great - he plays a romantic very well. All around, the film is well acted and believable. Cinematically, I don't remember any ""stunning"" shots or unique transitions that would make this movie rememberable; however, whatever the movie lacks in cinematics it makes up for with an engaging and interesting story from the first scene to the last. I would highly recommend it!",1525046400,,406,4.898550724637682

8567231,5,B00BEJL5LE,"This is one of those movies I could watch once a month and not get tired of it. It's got a great message, a great cast, and well written. Grab your popcorn and tissues and climb under the covers on the couch!",1524960000,,208,3.9761904761904763
8567232,2,B00BEJL5LE,"Quite possibly one of the corniest movies I've seen this year.

Every character is there to teach someone a lesson. Feels too forced. Everything seemed predictable. Acting so-so.",1523577600,,178,5.357142857142857

8567234,3,B00BEJL5LE,"I absolutely love this movie and it has been hard to find, that being said I was skeptical about purchasing it from someone abd it being used. At this time I should have been. Since I just opened the package to a disc case that has been smushed and a dvd with several scratches, if it skips when I watch it here in a bit im going to be thoroughly disappointed.",1521504000,,360,4.084507042253521
