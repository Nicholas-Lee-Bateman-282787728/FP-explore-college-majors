8536879,3,6302038375,"Honestly, if you are looking for a well concieved plot, you do not need to see an Andy Sidaris film. If you are looking for Playboy Playmates, running nude through tropical locations trying to look like serious, then you are right on the money. I bought this video not because Ted Lange (Issac - The Love Boat)was in it. I bought it for Hope Marie Carlton. Miss July 1985 always will have a special place in my heart. She was smarter than most because she married and raised a family in Utah, leaving her brief acting career behind her.
This movie takes place in CA on the beach (of course) as two guys get involved in a murder by accident. To get out of the trouble they find themselves in, they turn detective and try to prove their innocence. Film does have a few good turns so see what happens next.",1088208000,2,803,4.324503311258278
