7476608,3,B016NVSEDE,"Not quite up to earlier seasons, but still good viewing. The premise was fully explored and the viewer is left hanging. Overall, one great series.",1455926400,2,146,4.88

7476610,5,B016NVSEDE,"We miss Hill Street Blues.  It may have ended with many conflicts unresolved, but that's life.  Maybe someone will pick the series up again.",1492732800,,140,4.791666666666667
7476611,5,B016NVSEDE,"You NEVER get ""Over the Hill"". It was a series that no one knew how to watch. The first 2 years were imaginative and clearly a break away from the traditional ""Dragnet"" design, and set the stage for all of the future ""Cop"" Dramas. It is a shame Daniel J didn't appear in the ensemble discussions that so many of the others did. And Veronica Hamel is Still the definition of a Classy Lady.
There isn't a crime show today that does not owe it's basis in some fashion to Hill Street. From Law and Order, to NCIS, to any of the knockoffs you mention, this was the foundation of what is Crime Television.

I am only happy that I saw it first. :-)",1490832000,,641,4.169354838709677

7476614,5,B016NVSEDE,"Now I have the complete series and it is some of the best television viewing coming from America even though it is three decades old.  I thoroughly recommend it to anyone as it is far more entertaining than most of the current, so called, entertainment.",1461542400,,253,4.622222222222222
7476615,5,B016NVSEDE,Sad to see the finale again.  One of the greatest series that ever  ran on TV.  Kudos to SHOUT! for bringing it out.,1458345600,,116,3.9565217391304346

7476617,4,B016NVSEDE,Easily Norm and Sid the Snitch were the best thing to happen to the final season.,1457740800,,81,4.125

7476619,3,B016NVSEDE,"Show was losing it's fife.  Tool with cop mustache is not as good as Joe Coffey.  Dennis Franz would fare better in his more well known Bochco project, still getting his chops in. And Howard as the Sargent?  What the hell?  No wonder he would end up being Dougie's Dad!",1456876800,3,269,4.32
8736853,5,B016NVSEDE,"Head and shoulders above any other cop show. I worked in Law Enforcement for close to 20 years. I saw many of the same situations and people during my career. I never had a Sergeant as good as Phil Esterhaus, but I've had a couple like Sgt. Stan Jablonski. They had Captain Furillo, I had Captain Harrington. Decent men trying to get the job done. I've worked with someone just like nearly every character (No, not Belker).
This was one of the finest ensemble casts to be brought together for television. I usually hate cop shows for being so fake. not so with Hill Street. That and Barney Miller. Network TV just isn't worth the time anymore. You have to go to pay TV for good shows now. This Disc package completes my set of the entire 7 seasons.",1525478400,,748,4.388489208633094

8736856,5,B016NVSEDE,"Fantastic finish to maybe the best cop show that ever lived.  (along with The Shield, Wisguy, The Wire) HSB was probably the best of it's time and looking back, it's easy to remember why.  Seasons 6 & 7 sort of existed on their own plane.  Steven Bochco the creator of the show was asked to move on as his 5th season was big, expensive and a little too political - not enough helping the guy on the street, big political statements (yet it was still great.)  So they asked David Milch and his then partner Jeaffrey Lewis to helm a final 6th season, which became the 7th and final season.  In seasons 6 & 7, lots of fun was had with some perceptions of Hunter, Belker and LaRue.  Hill and Renko stories still reigned supreme but clearly - the biggest shocker was killing off a regular or two (no spoilers) early in season 6 - and then bringing back Milch's new creation NORMAN BUNTZ, who was great in season 6 and really got some more juicy stories in season 7 along with his side-kick, the resurrected SID THE SNITCH (last seen in the 3rd season.)  Much has been made that Milch wanted some of his own character payment money - which is why Sid came back and he created Buntz who slowly started permeating eps, but the truth was Buntz and the tone he brought was the best thing that could've happened to the show at that point, giving Furillo a true foil and bringing the show into some real noir.  It took a few eps but once Buntz faced down a mental patient in season 6 he had put away, it was impossible not to take his character seriously after a bit of a false start.  (There were moments in early Buntz that felt like Dennis Franz' other HSB character from the 3rd season, Sal Beneddetto.  But halfway into season 6 I think they finally had a real hold of Buntz and the show revolved a lot around his character in those last two seasons.  Every season had it's fair of clunkers - THE RUNNER FALLS, which was the 20th episode was a dud - but the 2 part finale was everything great about Hill Street and it had such an incredible ending along with some amazing stand alones. Particularly the David Mamet penned episode where Buntz helps a female cop through her first officer-involved shooting.  This is the best of the best - get every season, watch in order and enjoy.  And the season 7 opener, SUITCASE is arguably the most tense stand-alone Hill-Street episode to ever air.",1508112000,,2381,4.384090909090909
8736857,5,B016NVSEDE,Can't wait to finish the series.  Know that the quality will be as good and Seasons 3 & 4.,1505088000,,90,3.736842105263158
8736858,5,B016NVSEDE,This is the the best cop show.  I have thoroughly enjoyed watching the 7 seasons and am ready to start all over.,1503792000,,112,4.090909090909091

8736861,4,B016NVSEDE,"Yes, The Final Season of HILL STREET BLUES came at the right time.  Still proud to own the entire 7 year run.
The new characters played by sexy Meghan Gallagher did well as did the reasonably well cast Robert Clohessy as ''Flaherty"" who can't quite handle his 'want' for his partner Russo (Gallagher).  Pretty boy meets his match!  And I had a difficult time realizing Clohessy is the same actor who works for ""Commissioner Reagan'' Tom Selleck on tvs Blue Bloods (no mustache OR hair for Clohessy on Blue Bloods!)

 On a very high note:  The scene with Buntz and Washington, Larue, Jablonski, with Davenport and Furillo ALL standing side by side at the hospital is a tv moment etched in my head.  Without saying too much about episode, it was/is quite moving.
And Jon Cyphers as Chief Daniels became comedy relief with his hyper, ""hypocritical"", political rants.  The arrogance of the guy, yet, Cyphers makes it funny.  His facial expressions and pompous ere are priceless ... as you wish ""Furillo"" could just pop him one in the face.  Furillo can't though.  He just tries not to get pissed off or roll-his-eyes.
HILL STREET'S FINAL SEASON still good tv.  Especially for the 80's.
 4 stars.",1493424000,2,1191,4.751219512195122
