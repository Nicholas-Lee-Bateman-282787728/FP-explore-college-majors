This set contains two movies that were adapted from Sherlock Holmes stories. A. Conan Doyle wrote the first long story in 1887, the short stories in the 1890s. These stories have lessons as part of their entertainment. Doyle was interested in criminology and used true crimes as inspiration for these stories. Human nature (greed) continues. These movies are not copies of the original stories, but used parts and adapted them to modern times. They are worth watching as entertainment and preserve the culture of that era. The original stories are always worth reading. Read the individual reviews for more information  on each movie.
