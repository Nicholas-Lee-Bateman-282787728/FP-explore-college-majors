8237001,5,B00104HBI4,"I use to watch this series when I was about 10 years old and I loved it. The characters are great and keep you entertained. I now have two girls of my own ages 7 and 10 years old, this movie kept them in one place for just over two hours. They loved it. Its the perfect movie young children even adults.",1371859200,,303,3.903225806451613

8237003,4,B00104HBI4,"I stumbled onto this cartoon during Summer of 1997 (one of my many sweet Summers that I had to myself during the 1990's) while channel surfing after waking up one morning and fell in love. The Pocket Dragons and their friends are very charming and children will enjoy the show's medievil, fairy tale setting. Get ready for enchanting adventures with Filbert, Specks, Scribbles and the whole gang on this magical DVD. It's just to bad that this is the only Pocket Dragons DVD that seems to be availabe right now but trust me, no matter what the price this DVD is worth every penny.",1267142400,4,580,4.586538461538462
