921736,5,6304680899,"First off, if you are looking for an Oliver Stone style film about the manson incident then run away, run far away. This film is amazing, the soundtrack is priceless. I am into this sort of exploitation film, it is very roughly based around the manson thing, but it does contain some amazing footage. Yes a good bit of the film has no dialogue but mysterious black and white footage of drug use, nudity and even Hitchcock style murder footage makes it a ""late night"" must for me. It is very over the top and slightly psychedelic, definitely makes you wish you were apart of the manson family. This one is for my collection. long live tp rainbow",1181347200,8,644,4.466101694915254
921737,5,6304680899,"Oh it was done in black and white booh hooo!  It makes the film work! This stark realism of B/W is especially true in the murders scenes. It also gives a feeling past-tense which is how the script is set up.  As for dialogue -- can you say Noir Film?  Atmosphere folks, body language, reviewing minds and time-periods through narrative/scenery/cinemaphotograpy, all done well.  The lighting could have been better in the beginning but gets better towards the middle. This movie is very dark and moody and quite frankly more than I expected.  I think this is the rub with some of the other reviewers on here, they wanted the Docudrama - Helter Skelter - and got another film instead.  That isn't a valid reason to low rate a flick.  Quite Frankly this film ""takes you there"" to the crime scenes, insides the killers heads and the victims suffering, an empathic immediacy the the TV docudrama didn't achieve -- check this one out!  I was actually surprised!",1167782400,19,955,4.710843373493976
921738,2,6304680899,"I bought this movie, basically knowing it would be awful and I wasn't disappointed.  All the reviewers on here are right (except the two that gave it 5 stars)  -it is a horrible movie.  BUT,  I gave it two stars.

Why,  you may ask?  Because I read the great book by the same name,  and it was very cool to see the scene with actual footage of Spahn ranch.  (burned down not long after), and to see the scene with authentic hippies.

The rest of the movie is throw away.  If you want a good movie,  don't buy this.  If you loved the book,  or are very interested in the Manson trial/family and want to see footage of Spahn ranch, here it is.  Be warned - you'll get five or ten minutes of hippie/Spahn ranch footage.",1164067200,5,716,4.161764705882353
921739,1,6304680899,"I bought this movie thinking it would be an enlightening and interesting account of the Manson family and the murders.  It was TERRIBLE!  It was all in black and white, with barely any dialogue.  Manson and his family were depicted as zombies reminiscent of ""Night of the living dead"".  I actually fast forwarded through most of this movie hoping to find a scene worth watching.  Don't waste your money!  I wish I hadn't.",1115510400,7,421,4.698630136986301
921740,1,6304680899,"This movie was an unrealistic portrayal of the Tate La Bianca murders that occured in August, 1969.  If you want the real version buy the 1976 Helter Skelter if you can find it.  It is obsolete.
Don't waste your time or money watching this movie.  The guy who portrays Manson has a booming voice and Charles Mansion did not.  ""I am God, I am Satan, I am you, and you are me.""
A lot of the film is too dark to see and the photography is very poor.  The script is hard to follow and the acting is subpar.  Folks, don't waste your time on this version of Helter Skelter.",1072137600,12,567,4.109090909090909
921741,1,6304680899,"The best thing about this terrible movie is the packaging it comes in. I'm sure that has been what's drawn viewers to either purchase and or rent it.
I would personally rather wait to see the 1976 tele-film re-released to video and Dvd in it's full length instead of the cut down European theatrical version that was released years ago by Key Video.",1062547200,6,349,4.555555555555555
921742,1,6304680899,"I saw this movie first around 1991, though I knew right away it wasn't the tv mini series, as I was well familar with that. Yes this movie is taxing to watch, very long, maybe not in actual time, but it seems like it goes on forever. It's so bad it's almost funny though. I do, however enjoy the way it is filmed. It has almost a early Russ Myers feel to it, which is cool in a way. But story wise there isn't much to it, and factualy it does go astray at times. It does try to touch base on the life out in Spahn and Death Valley, with the lifestyle of the family, which is 'interesting'. Though some of it borderlines on the steamy and racey aspects. There is also a very long boring passage of Sharon Tate as a young teenager, or something at some kind of dance. The actor who plays Manson is dull as is everyone one else. For some reason everytime he speaks he sounds as if he is a southern preacher with a big booming voice..""Tell Me What You Can't Kill?!!"". The murder scene is probably the most interesting part of it all, filmed well enough. Certain facts are wrong as someone else has already pointed out. Though, there is an ammusing moment where Tex crouches down to the window of Steven Parent and smiles a evil smile. There is a lot of created stuff in this movie, such as the long ceramony right before the killers leave, the passing of wepons and drugs, which to most info out there didn't happen.
Yes the most interesting part of this film is they use Manson's song Mechanical Man. But a strange thing is, and no one has mentioned this before is that there is quite a few songs by the 1960's garage band The Music Machine in it. They were popular for the mid 60's song ""Talk Talk"". To my knowledge the Music Machine were not involved in any way to the Manson Family, so it seems strange to me that they use these songs.
I would not suggest to any to buy it, unless you are someone who HAS to have every single thing related to Manson. I am sure you can rent it at some video stores, as I have.",1051142400,8,2009,4.167095115681234
921743,1,6304680899,I was so excited about purchasing this movie and was very disappointed.  Not only is it boring (I fell asleep) but it is very short and only tells part of the story. I found the advertising is very misleading as I thought it was the original Helter Skelter.  The part that really upsets me is the price that is being charged for this piece of garbage.,1047859200,,351,4.303030303030303
921744,2,6304680899,"The interest of this film is that it was made at the time of the Manson trial, so all the (interminable) footage of contemporary hippy events is totally authentic.  Unfortunately, as it announces at the start, it was entirely derived from newspaper reports about the Tate/LaBianca murders, not from court transcripts or (because it hadn't yet been written) Bugliosi's book Helter Skelter, so the court scenes are minimal and sketchy, and the bulk of the film's running time is taken up with hippy concerts and dream-like re-enactments of Sharon Tate (not that she - or any other characters - are referred to by name) in Louis XV period dress which feel like filler in a very short (80-odd minute) film.  What is there is often wrong.  For instance Susan Atkins (Sadie Mae Glutz) is shown doing no more than holding Sharon Tate while 'Tex' Watson stabs her. This was Sadie Mae's original story, but by the time of the trial she had confessed to various cell-mates that she had stabbed Tate herself & got a sexual thrill from it.  I get the feeling this film was hacked together very fast so as to make an exploitative buck at the time.  There doesn't seem much reason to watch it now.  Plusses are the grainy black & white style & morbid atmosphere, and the fact that it was made basically as the trial was going on.  Oh, it says on the box two Manson songs will be heard.  And then at the start of the film it says only one will - Mechanical Man (very weird and not especially good, by the way) - but that's Exploitation!",1007337600,12,1521,4.505454545454546
921814,2,6304680899,"Best thing about this movie, if anything is that they play Manson's actual music recordings on the film. That's interesting enough.  Oddly enough the man was talented.  Pretty descriptive re-enactment of the murders that hot summer night.  They go into detail and everything.  That part was probably researched.  Besides the ending, if you make it that far, the beginning, and middle is a complete waste of time.",1003881600,,412,5.08955223880597
921815,1,6304680899,"1 star was the lowest rating, if there were negatives to pick from...this movie would get it.  please don't buy this movie unless you're looking to torment someone and put them into a coma.  this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life.  I'm just grateful I bought it for $5 off of eBay instead of paying the actual amount it's sold for on Amazon.  ANYTHING else you can find on Manson would be better than this, I'm sure!",1003536000,,436,4.216867469879518
921816,1,6304680899,"For those real True Crime buffs who love great documentries on this type of subject, be sure to have a pillow and blanket ready when you view this movie.  I promise you will be alseep after the first few minutes of this flick.  Still trying to figure out how to get my money back on this one. The problem with this movie is unless you have read books on ""The family"" and ""Helter Skelter"" you will be completely lost.  I sure hope Valium-productions is not hoping for an oscar on this film.  My advice is steer clear of this one folks.",1002844800,10,534,4.257425742574258
921817,1,6304680899,"Incomprehensible and disjointed ""story"" about the Manson Murders.  Film gets one star for a somewhat convincing recreation of the murders, but other than that it's all downhill.  I was right outside the house where the murders occurred early in 1993, and the house used here is completely different.  Dust off your copy of ""Helter Skelter"" instead.",985651200,3,348,5.178571428571429
921818,1,6304680899,My husband bought this for me when I finished reading the book.  He thought it was the movie I had seen bits and pieces of in the early 70's.  Well...it isn't!  I was terribly disappointed in the incomprehensible crap that's on this video.  It was a complete waste of time & money!!  I wish that the documentary with Vincent Bugliosi wasn't out of print in the U.S. this one should be out of print!,985132800,7,398,4.324324324324325
921819,1,6304680899,"My wife had shown a bit of interest in the murders after I had brought it up once so I got this video thinking it might be along a more biographical nature of the killings rather than following the movie of 1976, which might give her a better understanding of the actual killings. This video is the epitome of the word crap. I have never had such a waste of time, money and energy as with this. This movie is too bad to even qualify for ""what not to put into a movie 101"". Do not even waste your time, poor acting, poor cinematography, poor everything, AND they did not even get the facts straight...steer clear.",983318400,3,612,4.2844827586206895

921821,1,6304680899,"I rented this recently thinking I was going to see a film from my childhood called Helter Skelter.  I wasn't even allowed to watch it when it was on but years later saw it on very late night T.V.  It was a two-parter  which started with the murders and concentrated on the trial which was more  of a circus than O.J.'s ever could have been.  Now to get back to this  particular film.  It is not the movie I am thinking of.  It is too weird  for words.  This had barely any dialogue for over an hour, poorly shot and  it took forever to find any info on it.  Apparently this was some student  film made in 1971 or 72' after the trial was completed.  I felt compelled  to write this so no one buys this by mistake.  The real movie was based on  the excellent book by Vincent Bugliosi which was very researched and lived  through by the author.",953769600,68,841,4.15
921822,1,6304680899,"It looks as if ""Dark Angel"" (great name, yeah right) missed the point as these pro Manson freaks always seem to.  First off, how does this movie keep the watcher entertained?  It doesn't, all that happens is (in  black and white at that) people dancing around to very hard to hear music  with an occasional voice over.  Then near the end comes the violence.  The  viewer from Chicago didn't say anything about being ""disturbed""  by death and violence as any thinking person would be, these Manson people  always bring up this argument.  What the Chicago viewer said was that this  was not the T.V. movie that is most famous and I'll bet what people are  actually looking for.  But as far as the violence issue that DA brought up  most people are interested in it, it shocks us and there is absolutely  curiosity about this case and any idiot that acts like there's hypocracy  involved obviously is not listening and hearing only what they WAnt to.  But viewers, trust me this is not the film you are thinking about.  That is  called Helter Skelter and is based on the infamous book of the same name.  By the way Manson is so over.  C'mon.",950659200,24,1138,4.5073891625615765
7876948,5,6304680899,"I have no idea what everyone is griping about. This is one of the best films about the Manson Family murders. While it does drag in the courtroom scenes, it was the first exploitation adaptation of this episode, to the best of my knowledge. It was the best until Jim Van Bebber released 'The Manson Family,' which is quite explicit and horrific (a word of warning to those who were shocked at the gore in this film about multiple murders).

7876951,5,6304680899,"Considering this was made in 1971, it seemed to do a good job of following the ""official"" story given at the time.
