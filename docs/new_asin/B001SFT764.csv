3785435,4,B001SFT764,"This is an excellent video to learn isolations with lots of exercises at different speeds. The explanations are clear and Sandra demonstrates the movements very well. These include: hip slides, rib cage slides, chest circles, hip drops, vertical figure 8, small hip circles and flat figure 8. However I was disappointed not to see a bonus performance on this DVD.",1240444800,5,363,5.066666666666666

The only thing I don't like is that she wears long pants, so I can not see her knees or feet at all.",1384128000,2,302,4.611111111111111
8339699,3,B001SFT764,"Sandra is a wonderful dancer, her technique is amazing, and she is a great teacher. I just wish there were more drills on this video.",1308268800,,133,4.36
8339700,4,B001SFT764,"I have an entire arsenal of basics and isolations videos, some of which I hven't even got to yet. So you wouldn't be blamed for thinking I don't need another. Not so. Like many dancers, I like to go through the basics with different instructors, in different styles, moods, formats and music. I chose to work with Belly by Sandra today - and loved every minute of it.
First things first: Sandra moves beautifully. So beautifully that when she shoes you something you should not do, even that looks good! She has lovely poise and form and frankly, the smallest movement looks great on her.

On top of that, she has great advice to give. I thought I'd heard all the tips I could take, but today I caught several mistakes I've been making and took many points of advice to see immediate improvement in the look of a move when I adjusted. I was impressed enough to quickly get down to writing my thoughts down to share them with many of my friends who, like me,  have similar collections of basics videos and may not be considering another.

Another reason I totally enjoyed working with this video was the beautiful music. Many of the moves are done slowly to the lovely Nay Taxim track by Samir Siblini. The sound on this video seems to be particularly good and that only made it a greater pleasure to review basics with.

So, on all these counts, I pretty much recommend this to dancers who already have some isolations videos.
On this video, you begin with a short warm up. I think I'd have liked something to get the blood flowing first, but as it happens we get into some deep stretches. The collection has some of my favorite ones. For absolute novices, I would have had some warnings against right-to-the-floor sweeps and bends. A surprising number of young people have back-related problems these days and it would be best to explain more carefully how to get into flat back positions. Be that as it may, I myself am entirely comfortable with these stretches.

The format followed on this DVD is very comfortable and natural. The instruction is well-paced and flows from one thing to the othre without forced breaks. We learn an isolaiton like the hip slide, the vertical eight or a chest circle and we move into a short practice session. For some of the moves, Sandra gives you a variation. But for all of the moves, Sandra gives you fantastic explanations and the rationale behind why a movement should be done a particular way.

A surprising amount of good advice has been squeezed into the instruction on each isoltion. When you're ready, you do along without vocal cues to the prettiest music ever. Somehow, the packaging ensures that you don't get bored for a moment. Sandra is not lighthearted or leisurely here; she is focused and pleasant.
I was beginning to wonder whatever happend to the large hip circle, undulations, one-hip circle, variaitons with hip lifts etc, when I realized this was Vol 1 of a series. I have no idea how many there will be in this series and when the next one is coming, but I think it will be wonderful to have them around together. That's the only reason I take a point off this one.  Vol 1 is 90 minutes but it feels like it ends too soon. It may have been a good idea to leave the learner with something to do by way of putting the isolations together to dance. Until the next one comes.

Well, whenever it does come, there are enough concepts and muscle-wisdom in this one to make me want the rest.",1277769600,7,3444,4.52572347266881
8339701,5,B001SFT764,"Belly by Sandra is an excellent start for the beginner or great as a supplement for class practice.

The volume I isolations covers much more than basic isolations. In almost every chapter, there is a section for different variations, with added level, weight changes, traveling or arm positions. There is also a practice sequence after each section, with cues. You drill each isolation to music, then at different speeds to help strengthen and incorporate the movements into your body (muscle memory).

Sandra's teaching style is clear and to the point. She uses comparisons, descriptions of musculature, and visual explanations/demonstrations to help the student learn & understand how to execute each isolation flawlessly.

The chapters included are:

Posture
Warm-up
Rib Cage Slides
Chest Circles
Hip Drops
Single Hip Drop with Leg Release
Vertical Figure 8's (both up & down)
Horizontal Figure 8's

I would definitely recommend Belly by Sandra.

 In my opinion, this DVD was informative and fun it would be a sound-learning tool for the beginner and can be used as practice for the advanced beginner.

NOTE: This dvd covers a large portion of the basic isolations for bellydance, but not all of them. Coupled with the material on Sandra's Volume 2, should round out and complete your basic dance vocabulary.",1273017600,10,1312,5.184834123222749
8339702,5,B001SFT764,"This DVD quickly worked itself into heavy rotation in my belly dance regime. Sandra is an excellent instructor and breaks down each isolation well. This DVD is great for anyone looking to improve the quality of their isolations or to drill these movements into their muscle memory. The DVD is great done all the way through for a full body work out, or with each section individually as needed to tone and train specific areas. A must have in my opinion!",1265500800,3,454,4.617283950617284
8339703,5,B001SFT764,I loved this dvd. It is a good addition to any dancers training. The information will help deepen or begin a strong foundation. It really drills the basic for all forms of belly dance. The instruction is clear and informative. Fun to follow and not bogged down with too much chatter.,1262995200,3,283,4.568627450980392
8339704,5,B001SFT764,"I bought it after viewing the vedio clip made by one of the reviewers and I thought I liked it. No regret. I have benefited a lot from the teachings. I also like the practice after every explanation. Some teachers keep talking and give very little time for practice; after a while, I get bored. But so far my isolations become better after viewing this DVD.

So far my shimmy & figure 8 aren't perfect but I guess they will improve soon after I make use of the teachings.",1252454400,2,471,4.292134831460674
8339705,5,B001SFT764,"I highly recommend this instructional dvd. It really gets to the meat of the different types of hip movements, what you should be feeling as you move your muscles and abs! What your teacher doesn't have time to talk about in your hour of dance, Sandra does! I give it five stars!!! Stella",1244592000,5,288,4.452830188679245
