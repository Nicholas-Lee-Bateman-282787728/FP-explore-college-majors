7999269,4,B0000CG8BL,"I've always loved Linnea Quigley's stuff, and she was super hot in this, but this was the first time I've had the pleasure of seeing Delia Sheppard in a movie, and she is HOT. I mean REALLY hot. Not just her perfect features, but also her snooty material girl attitude had me drooling... but that could be my medication. Anyway, those are the main two reasons (or four reasons, depending on what you're counting) to see the movie, and it does have that purposely cheesy 80's quality that's always good for a laugh, and the plotline's even pretty clever.

I first read about this movie in an expose for Linnea Quigley in a shortlived Fangoria-era magazine named Slaughter House. I've looked for it ever since and this is the first release of it I've EVER seen. I've looked for bootlegs and everything, so thanks for digging this one up, Media Blasters.",1169942400,12,851,4.635761589403973
