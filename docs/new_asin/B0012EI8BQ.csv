3087355,2,B0012EI8BQ,"great to have lone on dvd at all but this dvd is obviously compressed to some degree because everything moves unnaturally fast. lone speaks too fast. it's like you're not getting the real show. it's compressed at a rate of 130% or something. the episodes open with the full song, the middle ones open with like an abbreviated opening (which is ok because we watch more than one) and don't close with the ending song until the end of the disc so that the episodes average out to 23.5 minutes each so i am thinking for a show from back then it has to be sped up so they could fit more eps on a disc. don't know what disc is better yet, really. the one from cracker barrel i think i remember might be better. the hopalong cassidy volumes don't seem to be so bad. anybody know of a better not compressed lone ranger disc than this one? will post to a discussion on here when i get a chance.",1278460800,11,886,4.187134502923977

3087361,4,B0012EI8BQ,"While the overall quality of this DVD set is very high, I am curious as to why the end credits with the wonderful ""William Tell Overture"" of Rossini are omitted in all but the last program of each side.  This means that the information on directors, producers, guest actors, etc. is missing on 15 of the 17 programs.  Truly ""uncut"" programs would take us all the way to the end as the original producers intended.",1222560000,45,413,4.493333333333333

3087363,5,B0012EI8BQ,"The 221 episodes of ""The Lone Ranger"" were originally broadcast on ABC from 1949 to 1957; and then for many years they played in local syndication.  For most of the original broadcast years the series was ABC's most watched piece of programming.

This new DVD set from Pop Flix contains the first 16 episodes (15 Sept-29 Dec 1949) and for some unknown reason episode 22 from the fifth season, for a total of 17 episodes (the same 17 available on last year's Mill Creek Entertainment release so these are probably in the public domain).  These sets pretty much render ""The Legend of the Lone Ranger"" movie superfluous as all three episodes that were combined in 1952 to form the movie are included in these releases.

These early episodes hark back to radio as there is considerably more voiceover narration used as an introduction and to introduce key plot moments.

The series itself was pure kiddie western with clear-cut good and evil distinctions and no romance.  The title character (played by Clayton Moore) started out Texas Ranger John Reid.  The first three episodes provide the background for his transformation to Lone Ranger status, his partnering with the Indian Tonto (Jay Silverheels), and the taming of his horse ""Silver"".

There is an unambiguous code of positive morality infusing each episode.  The Lone Ranger is totally good but he adopts the guise of evil.  While a masked man in the west was normally feared by the good citizens and an Indian was distrusted, the Lone Ranger is feared by those who would do evil.  One persistent theme is that when the Lone Ranger and Tonto first encounter an average citizen they are greeted with suspicion, and by the end of the episode the citizen has been convinced of their value.  The trademark ending was a secondary character asking the question: ""who was that masked man?"".

To really enjoy the series you must accept it for the simplistic morality tale it was intended to be.  If you don't take it seriously and keep wishing for some self-reflexive campy parody elements you will only get frustrated.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1207094400,89,2114,4.814404432132964

I wanted them to see what the Lone Ranger really was like, but once again this came off as a joke. they compressed the shows to get more episodes on the D.V.D. It came off sounding like a cartoon and I for one was very unhappy. If you are going to do something, do it right or don't do it at all! I will NOT purchase from this company again. If you are thinking of purchasing this product I recommend you reconsider, it's not worth the money.",1393804800,,557,4.027027027027027
3087455,5,B0012EI8BQ,"One overriding thing, Moore believed in what he was doing and enjoyed it tremendously. And did it all very well.
On thing about seeing the series compilation is that it's obvious that he did his bounding onto Sliver, fight/stunt
work himself. His sort of (now) corny style and morals I think reflected his own character.

There have been many parodies about such TV characters taking their roles too serious; Moore took it just right.

Re mom and the Long Ranger: They dated briefly. Then mom made a big mistake. Sher brought him home to meet
her room mate, Sally. Kismet or just a BOINGGG!, Clayton and Sally clicked. They were quickly happily married and
lived happily ever after. Don't know what happened to Silver, or Tonto, for that matter.

These episodes are, incidentally, REALLY entertaining, more so than I remembered them to be. Action, Western ethics,
social commentary, insight into people, times then (both in Hollywood and in the fictional West). In both casts, often
unintentionally funny. (I resist saying 'corny'; that'd be sacrilege - not in religious terms, but in western ethics...)  rc",1392163200,,1107,5.0

3321860,5,B0012EI8BQ,"The 221 episodes of ""The Lone Ranger"" were originally broadcast on ABC from 1949 to 1957; and then for many years they played in local syndication.  For most of the original broadcast years the series was ABC's most watched piece of programming.

This new DVD set from Pop Flix contains the first 16 episodes (15 Sept-29 Dec 1949) and for some unknown reason episode 22 from the fifth season, for a total of 17 episodes (the same 17 available on last year's Mill Creek Entertainment release so these are probably in the public domain).  These sets pretty much render ""The Legend of the Lone Ranger"" movie superfluous as all three episodes that were combined in 1952 to form the movie are included in these releases.

These early episodes hark back to radio as there is considerably more voiceover narration used as an introduction and to introduce key plot moments.

The series itself was pure kiddie western with clear-cut good and evil distinctions and no romance.  The title character (played by Clayton Moore) started out Texas Ranger John Reid.  The first three episodes provide the background for his transformation to Lone Ranger status, his partnering with the Indian Tonto (Jay Silverheels), and the taming of his horse ""Silver"".

There is an unambiguous code of positive morality infusing each episode.  The Lone Ranger is totally good but he adopts the guise of evil.  While a masked man in the west was normally feared by the good citizens and an Indian was distrusted, the Lone Ranger is feared by those who would do evil.  One persistent theme is that when the Lone Ranger and Tonto first encounter an average citizen they are greeted with suspicion, and by the end of the episode the citizen has been convinced of their value.  The trademark ending was a secondary character asking the question: ""who was that masked man?"".

To really enjoy the series you must accept it for the simplistic morality tale it was intended to be.  If you don't take it seriously and keep wishing for some self-reflexive campy parody elements you will only get frustrated.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1207094400,89,2114,4.814404432132964

3321952,5,B0012EI8BQ,"One overriding thing, Moore believed in what he was doing and enjoyed it tremendously. And did it all very well.
On thing about seeing the series compilation is that it's obvious that he did his bounding onto Sliver, fight/stunt
work himself. His sort of (now) corny style and morals I think reflected his own character.

There have been many parodies about such TV characters taking their roles too serious; Moore took it just right.

Re mom and the Long Ranger: They dated briefly. Then mom made a big mistake. Sher brought him home to meet
her room mate, Sally. Kismet or just a BOINGGG!, Clayton and Sally clicked. They were quickly happily married and
lived happily ever after. Don't know what happened to Silver, or Tonto, for that matter.

These episodes are, incidentally, REALLY entertaining, more so than I remembered them to be. Action, Western ethics,
social commentary, insight into people, times then (both in Hollywood and in the fictional West). In both casts, often
unintentionally funny. (I resist saying 'corny'; that'd be sacrilege - not in religious terms, but in western ethics...)  rc",1392163200,,1107,5.0

If you're looking for pure Clayton Moore as The Lone Ranger in pure style, this is a handy little 2-disc DVD set for pure entertainment, plots, and cowboy legendary conflict with that masked man of the open prairie, The Lone Ranger. B&W episodes make you feel like you're living in a time warp. Excellent!",1297900800,,346,4.688524590163935

The reviews made it sound like it contains all of the episodes listed - when obviously the reviews were for a different Lone Ranger dvd.

3322048,4,B0012EI8BQ,"This is a nice collection of the classic TV show. It includes the ""origin"" show. The reproduction is good.  These will likely only be of interest to people old enough to remember the original show.  By modern standards they are incredibly hokey and provide an ultra romanticized version of the Wild West, including stereotypes of Native Americans that are unimaginable today. The show was noteworthy for its lack of killing.  They were, however, quite the thing for kids to watch in the early days of TV.  There is some humor value in watching them, but also a rather warm fondness for their simple plots and predictable outcomes.",1290470400,6,630,4.859813084112149

8245568,4,B0012EI8BQ,"The Lone Ranger was one of the truly iconic shows from the early day of television, and thrilled kids and adults alike from 1949 through the early 60s, although for many of those years nothing but re-runs were shown (there were only five seasons of original episodes produced). In the process, Clayton Moore became a beloved figure for the rest of his life, making a good living from personal appearances as the Lone Ranger for most of the rest of his days.

All but one of the episodes in this product are from 1949, and they are in amazingly good shape for TV from that era. I docked a star because the opening and closing were cut from most of the episodes. They frame the episodes on each DVD, rather than each episode itself. That was disappointing, since frankly the opening and closing to each episode were salient features of the series.

In appreciating this series, you have to get yourself in the frame of mind of audiences in the middle of the last century. ""The Lone Ranger"" had thrived through the 30s and 40s as radio and movie serials before coming to TV, and the TV show retained much of the spirit of the radio broadcasts, with stylized dialogue and imposing voice-overs. Tonto speaks in stereo-typical ""Indian speak"", with contrived poor grammar and often stilted delivery. The Lone Ranger often speaks with exaggerated enunciation in a ""heroic"" manner. LOL

However, most of the acting is surprisingly natural and good, particularly since most of the supporting cast were veterans of years of the myriad westerns shot in the 30s and 40s.

For its time, ""The Lone Ranger"" had a remarkably advanced attitude towards ""Indian"" relations. At a time when many westerns were still portraying ""Indians"" as savage murderers preying on simple defenseless settlers, in ""The Lone Ranger"" they are depicted with dignity, and often as victims of unscrupulous ""white men"".

The price on this set is trivial to get a taste of the early days of this series. It includes the three part ""origin"" story, and during its course you'll even get the treat of seeing DeForest Kelly in one of his many western roles before his ""name role"" as Doctor McCoy on Star Trek.

I'll never forget watching The Lone Ranger myself, then heading into the back yard as a 4 year old to ride the teeter totter like crazy while exclaiming, ""Hi Yo Silver ... AWAY!!""",1503446400,,2343,4.730392156862745
