The songs are top notch, the ensemble performances far better than expected, and it's a really good time.  Unlike so many films aimed at teens, this one is fun for all ages. I'm in my 40s and I had a good time.

2549382,5,B000F2BNW2,"High School Musical, released in 2006 and directed by Kenny Ortega, follows the lives of two basketball jocks, twins that have starred in 17 school productions, one academic geek, and one genius new girl that transferred after winter break.

This story starts at a ski lodge where two innocent people are forced to sing karaoke at a New Years Eve party. These two people don't know each other at all, but feel a connection from their three minute jam session. So, when the girl is transferred to the guys school after winter break, both are shocked, but excited. These two are the main characters, Gabriella Montez, the genius, and Troy Bolton, captain of the basketball team. After the couples stint at the ski lodge, Gabriella tries to get Troy to audition for the schools production of the Twinkle Toes Musical. Troy refuses to audition because he doesnt want to face what all of his jock friends will say about the captain of the basketball team participating in anything twinkly. But his attempts to hide this side of him from his friends doesnt pan out. Mrs. Darbus, the drama teacher, overhears him and Gabriella singing together and brings them back for a groundbreaking callback. This is probably the first time a jock has ever done anything but sports at East High. Inspired, a wave of people come out of their socially accepted positions and embrace their inner passions.

I love this movie. That quote I put in the opening paragraph? I just knew that off of the top of my head. As I write this the catchy tunes of this series are swirling around my head. But, this movie also has a great message. It shows viewers that it is okay to pursue new things- though you might be rejected at first, as shown in the song Stick to the Status Quo in which people are told to go back to hiding their special interests. But by the end of the movie, and the series, the gaps between the social classes have been bridged. One of the academic geeks has become a cheerleader, a basketball jock is now openly a baker, and a skater kid now embraces his love for the cello. But the main influence on the student body is Troy Bolton and the friendships he has formed between the social groups, helping the so-called social lines to disappear.

But, I must say, this movie follows a fairly predictable plot line, as do the other two in the series- so much so viewers can predict what song will come next based on musical sequences in the other two movies. As in most movies, the guy tries a new thing, survives the hardships and succeeds, the girl gets the guy, and everyone wins. Sure, predictable. But there are always other components in a movie that help it stand out from the rest. In High School Musical I would say that those components are the brilliant choreography, stunning vocals, the sense of true family and friendship on set, and lastly, the incredible message that High School Musical carries.

There is only one other thing that could be referred to as a flaw. Very much like the end of both Pitch Perfect movies, it feels like High School Musical concludes leaving loose ends. I really hate the endings of the Pitch Perfect movies because they never really wrap things up enough for me. In Pitch Perfect, watchers know that the Barden Bellas win their competition from statements after the competition, but there is never a awards ceremony confirming this knowledge. This relates to High School Musical because, though viewers know Troy and Gabriella get the parts, they never get to see them in the Twinkle Town Musical. Though I do dislike the endings of Pitch Perfect, I feel like this ending works in High School Musical because during the callbacks it seems like everyone in the school came to cheer Troy and Gabriella on. And then I don't really care how the actual musical went because the entire student body had decided to support Troy and Gabriella no matter what.

All in all, I think that this movie carries an incredible message. So be it if the message must be carried through a unsurprising plot that was not 100% resolved. If you haven't seen High School Musical, or haven't seen it recently enough to understand every reference I could throw out there, I strongly recommend you spend your weekend participating in a High School Musical marathon.",1476835200,,4270,4.665338645418327
2549383,5,B000F2BNW2,"High School Musical is a movie about Troy Bolton and Gabriella Montez and how they overcome what people think and become confident in doing what they want to do. They both get over the fact that people are going to judge no matter what, but it only matters what they really wanted to do not what other people wanted them to do. They both meet each other on New Year's Eve when they were peer pressured into singing karaoke with each other. Once they were done singing they both hung out and watched the fireworks leading up to both of them exchanging phone numbers. But what they didn't know was that they would both be going to the same school once winter break gets over. Once they realize that they do it turns into a lot of drama revolved around them. With a great outcome in the end.
Troy Bolton (Zac Efron) is the best player on his basketball team but that gets jeopardized when he starts to sing with Gabriella. Troy starts to focus on the musical more than basketball which makes a huge impact on the team because Troy is their star player. Troy didn't always like being the captain of his basketball team due to the fact that he had so much pressure on his shoulders. Troy said Sometimes I don't wanna be the basketball guy. I just wanna be a guy..
Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Hudgens) is one of the smartest students in her school. She has a 4.0 GPA, and is ahead in all of her classes. Throughout the movie she struggles with liking Troy because of his reputation around the school.  When she figures out who he really is and tries out for the musical with him they become boyfriend and girlfriend.
When I first saw this movie, I was 6 years old, and I was in love! I had watched High School Musical so much I knew every word to every song they sang. But lets be real, I still watch High School Musical. This movie is such a great movie to sing along with which is why I think I was so in love with it and still am in love with it. Its the type of movie that gets you pumped up and in a good mood when you are having a bad day or need to get excited.
Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens were perfect actors to play the roles of Troy Bolton and Gabriella Montez. They truly seem like they belong together, and for a little while I was hoping that they would get married and have kids, and those kids would make a High School Musical remake. Because how great would that be? But I knew that would never happen. Once I got over the fact that they weren't going to have kids that would make a High School Musical remake, I was glad because I doubt it would be as good as the original anyway.
This is a family movie because it is an easy movie to sing along to and it is very funny. I guarantee that everyone in your family would love High School Musical. With all of the comedy, romance, drama there should be no problem getting your kids or your mom and dad to watch this movie.",1476748800,,2879,4.206148282097649

2549394,1,B000F2BNW2,"I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an ""Amazon"" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!!

2549462,5,B000F2BNW2,"High School Musical (HSM) is a feel good movie for the whole family. No matter whom you watch it with; whether it is with your grandfather or regular father you will have a good time. When it premiered on Disney Channel in 2006 it was an instant hit. I was captivated by the spicy dance numbers and touching lyrics.
 In the movie, Gabriella is moving to East High in the middle of the year and is shy and kind of nerdy. She meets basketball hottie Troy Bolton and they immediately bond. They share their secret love of song and dance and decide to sing in the school musical together. This power couple auditions against the deceitful Sharpay and her brother Ryan. Troy and Gabriella, in the end get to be the leads in the school play.
 HSM has one strong message, to take down social barriers. The songs and choreography makes it possible for viewers to conquer these on their own by making it more relatable and interactive. This is shown when Troy falls in love with Gabriella and don't care if people know that they love to sing. This starts a chain of events where people start being themselves and confessing their hidden hobbies; Zeek bakes cakes and a skater loves to play the cello! As I watch this now as a young adult it inspires me to do the same thing, not caring about what other people think of the real me. This openness among the characters creates a bond that makes them able to say (or sing) that they are All In This Together while dancing together, basketball players and mathletes alike.
 All of the songs in HSM have an upbeat pop sound that makes them fun to listen to. These are a few of my favorite songs.
""Start of Something New is the song where Troy and Gabriella meet for the first time in a snow lodge. They sing this song in a round of karaoke and feel an immediate connection. This song introduces us to the romance that will blossom throughout the movie.
""Get'cha Head In the Game is sung with Troy and his basketball teammates. Troy is distracted because he really likes Gabriella and he also loves singing. His teammates can see this because is basketball skills are slacking right before the big playoff game. To get Troy focused, he and his teammates sing this song.
""What I've Been Looking For"" and ""Bop to the Top are sung by Sharpay and her brother Ryan. They are drama club royalty and this song shows their talent. They do end up being the antagonists of the film but the song is very catchy.
""Stick to the Status Quo"" is a song that basically tells people to stay within the boundaries of their social class. But at the end of the song the message is transformed into embracing who you are and people won't judge you for it.
""Breaking Free"" is the song Troy and Gabriella sing in the last round of auditions. This touching duet showcases their talent and helps them become the leads in the school musical.
""We're All In This Together"" is by far my favorite song in the whole movie. Its the last song and it features every character in the movie. It is everyone on the basketball court dancing together like one big happy family.
 HSM gives a good and light expectation of high school to counter the infamous bullying and violent stories. Students entering high school are scared of being pinned against lockers by upperclassmen, which never really happens. Though I am not suggesting that HSM is a realistic expectation of high school, it is a strong counter to the dreadful stories. The relationship of Troy and Gabriella gives middle school students a chance to be excited about high school and not fear it. It also gives them insight on what makes a good relationship. Gabriella and Troy build each other up and help each other become comfortable in who they are, they do not refer to each other in derogatory terms or do derogatory actions. HSM sets down a guide of how to make your experience the best one possible by showing that high school can be positive and beneficial.
 HSM is a light hearted approach to dealing with serious problems in high school. It teaches young students to be themselves and not fall in to the stereotypical high-school-student mold.",1399420800,,4111,4.55

I've since purchased the HSM 2 and 3 movies and they are fantastic as well, so much so that I've given the entire movie set as gifts to numerous little girls. The response is always the same, they love High School Musical. This is a Disney Production and appropriate for any age (no adult behavior (sex, smoking, drinking, swearing) is represented).

2549482,3,B000F2BNW2,"Boy meets girl, they defy convention and come out on top.

So the producers said, ""How can we make this fresh?""  And answered themselves with, ""Why bother?""

The good stuff was, sort of, in the details. The Gabriella character has a single mother who is not an interfering harridan, they are hispanic without living in poverty, and the principal is Asian without making a huge deal about it.  There are some interracial romances that are nicely handled.  There's a cute little song about defying convention.  But we mustn't get TOO proactive, and the principals are all pretty bland conventions.  The black characters are only supporting cast.  The smart girl who likes hip hop and is plus size has about three lines--we couldn't have anyone but the beauty queen get the hunk, could we?

The songs were catchy without being any good. I never, ever want to hear Vanessa Hudgens sing again (or whoever was singing). And her acting was awful--maybe it'll get better as she gets older, but from the very first scene where she is supposed to be shy--she looks as though she is taking direction, ""You're shy, put your head down!""  So she looks like a confident girl with her head down.

And everything--and I do mean EVERYthing--resolves in the end. They win the championship, AND the academic bowl, AND the good guys get the leads in the musical (without ever actually reading for the parts, I might add)and the stuck up girl accepts a date with the guy that likes to cook.

Oh, dear, was that a spoiler??

It's a cute little movie that I'll let my 8 year old watch and she can feel she's a part of an older culture. That's the best I can say for it.  It's cute. Horribly, horribly cute.",1369267200,,1682,4.600671140939597

2549505,1,B000F2BNW2,"This is my son's review.

We had to watch this film on the van at my old school. It had ear-grading singing and an unimaginative score. The characters were cardboard. Every last one of them relates back to basal stereotypes. The jock. The vain popular girl. Her wimpy brother. The hot nerd. The disapproving coach. The over-dramatic drama teacher. All cardboard, all there.

The songs could have been written by two year-olds. All these ""Disney Channel Original Movies"" are insipid, every one aimed at the 6-15 year old demographic, the only reliable audience left, since Disney has been demonized as pandering to small fry. Never has entertainment reached such lows. EVERY KID ON THAT VAN WAS ENTERTAINED. I knew different.

2549506,1,B000F2BNW2,"I would have thought that the whole point of 'High School Musical' would be the music.

Well, as a trained musician, and one who has written my own material, and directed high school musicals, I have to say that the music in HSM was WOEFUL!!!! Whoever wrote these numbers has no talent for writing tunes whatsoever, or (more concerning), they were under instructions to write the most bland, innane trash they could think of.

The fact that so many people thought it was great, is of real concern. It shows the inability of so many people to recognize the difference between good and bad music (and these people are allowed to vote!). To some extent this is a matter of taste, but I do not know any trained musicians who would say anything good about HSM.

The acting and the story followed a similar vein - all reflective of the Disney factory which produces an idealistic, squeaky-clean world of prestine beauty which doesn't exist.",1316390400,,934,4.682926829268292

But just like with Glee, I don't care, cause that's why I'm watching it! I love music! I REALLY think Zac Efron is a major hottie too, so I can't say it is just the tunez that are making me love this movie. I don't really see him as a basketball player tho. He's kinda short. But whatev. I don't mind. :^) Anyways, I really do recommed you check out this movie, especailly if you are a kid. It's really good.

The story doesn't progress that far in the one and a half hours of its length, and people don't automatically know the right song lyrics and dance moves in a high school cafeteria. But that's what musicals are all about, so if you're willing to suspend your disbelief for 93 minutes, and you're looking for a family-appropriate movie (no violence, kissing, nor anything beyond that), you might want to get this film.

I just mentioned some points you might not like about the movie, so here are some things you will probably like. The songs are pretty catchy, the characters are good-looking, and the protagonists are lovable, relate-able characters. Some of them may remind you of people you've known, perhaps even yourself if you hesitated to do something in high school because you were afraid of what other people might think.

While I still think it is corny, I changed my mind about ""too"" corny cause I ended up liking the whole series and thought each one was better than the last.  I don't know what made this work where others like Camp Rock and Glee just don't do it for me. I suppose it is simply the combination of cast, story, and music --- like any musical.

Yes, HSM is cheesy, obvious, and innocent - which was the intent of Disney in order to appeal to a certain age group.

Short Summary...Troy meets Gabriella while vacationing with his family over the holidays. They sing a duet together. When he gets back to East High he notices that Gabriella has been transferred to his school. They are both excited to see each other since they have a crush on each other. Troy being the basketball star can't let his friends know that he sung with Gabriella over Winter Break so he tries to keep it a secret. Gabriella talks Troy into doing the Spring Musical with her only to find himself in a predictament...basketball or theater. Troy's teammates find out that Troy is doing the musical and they are not happy especially Chad (his best friend and teammate). However the jealous Sharpay has other plans for the couple. She has a crush on Troy so she tries to eliminate Gabriella. She changes the date of the musical to the same day as the basketball championship game. What is Troy going to do now? Watch the movie to see if Troy chooses Gabriella or Sharpay and to see if Troy chooses theater or basketball.

2549537,1,B000F2BNW2,"HSM has been notoriously billed as the ""Grease"" of this generation to draw a connection between it and this movie's musical roots. That's an analogy that highlights the superficial, ""fun"" aspect of this movie, but HSM has other praiseworthy attributes. HSM is the type of entertainment that should be mass-marketed to teenagers today because that demographic is cataclysmically in peril of entering into high-risk behavior such as premature sex, gang-involvement, drug use, apathy, violence, idleness, etc.. HSM is a very laudable antidote to this predilection of risky, teen misbehavior because of the values it espouses: healthy activities, pride in oneself, determination, achievement, school involvement, rejecting peer pressure et al.

Because of the way the values espoused are treated, HSM is in danger of being dismissed as a breezy, thoughtless piece of banality and triteness where its values are so rigidly clean-cut they come off as being insincere. In fact, this only scratches the surface of HSM's enormous faults, and aside from the facade of clean-cut values, everything else is in freefall.

Despite Disney's focus on constructive values for teens, a deeper analysis unmasks really harmful influences throughout the movie, influences which are to blame for our society's decay in the form of over-sexualization, vanity, appearance-consciousness, obsession with wealth, and low self-esteem.

All the young starlet-actors, whether its Efron or Hudgens or Tisdale, don't look like the average, normal teenager. Maybe that's because they're many years older than most teenagers, but mostly because they're unnaturally appearance-oriented. Efron's character Troy is someone the vast majority of teens WON'T relate to because he looks like a little Calvin Klein model with his perfect hair and his chiseled face (Efron is currently hyped as a sex symbol by debauched magazine Rolling Stone). The girls (Stripperella Hudgens/Tisdale) are even more loathsome: their faces are repositories for an explosion of makeup and their clothing puts an emphasis on the superficiality of wealth and vanity.

The Sharpay character particularly is a destructive ""role model"" for young girls because her attire shows exorbitant amounts of skin (too short skirts) and misleads teens to think that one needs expensive clothing to fit in. Though the Sharpay character's supposed to be a lesson against this sort of misconduct by teens due to her being the villain, HSM fails to make this clear enough, and impressionable (read: stupid) teens and those younger will fail to get this connotation. Instead, many teens probably will come away with the misinformation that misbehaving like a selfish, vanity-obsessed Sharpay is praiseworthy--not just since our liberal-infected pop culture pushes those toxins--but because HSM glorifies the villain in Sharpay.

Aside from these unpardonable breaches, HSM also should concern parents for its deadly messages of emasculation and effemination when teenage boys are watching; the themes of feminine dancing and singing are enough to potentially neuter the masculinity of teen boys watching this foulness, which is what liberalism wants anyway. Boys should participate in sports and community service in order to both keep them busy and build character, yet this film indoctrinates teen boys to squander their time with limp-wristed singing and dancing. This shouldn't be totally startling since Disney is culpable for clandestinely indoctrinating young boys to turn effeminate via the overwhelming skew towards female activities in their products--just look at other popular shows on the Disney Channel: Hannah Montana, Raven, etc..

Since HSM has themes/values that are so much healthier and cleaner for teens who are in desperate need of guidance in their impressionable lives, it's with a somewhat heavy heart that I write this next paragraph. I have many friends who are young couples with young kids, so I intimately know what Disney should do to retain its patronage of their demographic, families with children. Many reading this review likely know by now the scandalously lewd expose that hit one of the debauched starlets in this film, Vanessa Hudgens due to her own misjudgments and lust for temptation!!!! Hudgens took stark-naked pictures of herself which where then plastered all over the internet.

Only if one's a moral relativist who excuses hurtful, moral misbehavior could one still support this product after one of its most prominent faces betrayed all the little kids to whom she's supposed to be a role model with her salacious exhibitionism!!!! Speaking on behalf of all my many friends who are couples with young kids, they'll NOT be buying ANY MORE Disney products until Disney redeems their company from the taint left by Hudgens. That is to fire her and show the families with young children that Disney really protects and promotes traditional, conservative family virtues, or else, it appears like Disney only cares about making money. In fact, Disney has gone on record about Hudgens, that the reason they'll not discipline her is not to upset the attraction of youngsters to Hudgens and her popular character.

All the young couples with young kids whom I know are boycotting Disney until they sanitize this uncleanliness left by Hudgens' misconduct.",1208390400,6,5315,5.426150121065375

Now that I have seen it I can understand both sides.

High School Musical is first of all a true Disney production. Everything is very colourful and happy. You either like this true Disney feeling or not. One thing is for sure, this happiness and true Disney feeling makes younger children fall in love with it immediately.
It's all a matter of taste. A classic story about two high school students who want to compete for the main roles in their High School Musical but are, if they do it, not excepted by their friends anymore. Now give it some nice Disney sweetness and make it a world where characters can break into a hit song any minute.

High School Musical is definitely a very good film in it's genre and is perfect for it's goal audience. Still, it is made with so much fun and a true happy spirit that it also reaches outside this goal audience.
The songs are very catchy and are in your head easily. This sure helps the movie's success. Just like with Grease, these songs are ones you can, after a few times of listening, happily sing along.
Then there are a lot of colourful characters people can relate to. Zac Efron and Vanessa Anne Hudgens are good charming leads and give the story a nice touch.
But next to all that fun, there are of course some lessons in the film as well. Lessons about acceptance and friendship that are well placed in the storyline.

All I can say is that I'm going to check out High School Musical 2 and see if that one is as entertainingly Disney fun as this one.
Recommended for anyone who wants some light, colourful and mainly happy sing along entertainment.
But then again, it's of course all a matter of taste if you will fall in love with it or not.

So what is it about HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL? It's sure cheesy enough and the plot couldn't be more on the beaten path. Well, for me, the movie's exuberance and the engaging leads are what sold it. Turns out I'm not so jaded that I can't be swayed and won over by youthful enthusiasm and energetic performances. And, yikes, this one's a musical.

The plot? During vacation, on New Year's Eve, basketball jock Troy Bolton (Zac Efron) and the brilliant, bookish Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Anne Hudgens) meet at a teen party, forced to sing a karaoke duet together, and end up exchanging phone numbers. Then, for Troy, it's back to school at Albuquerque, New Mexico's East High.

But it turns out that Gabriella is East High School's newest student. So, a week after their duet, the two meet again and their interest in music and in each other is renewed. And there's a school winter musical looking for new blood. Do Troy and Gabriella sign up? Doing so would mean breaking out of their respective cliques and fracturing the school's status quo. Troy's with the jock crowd, with a big game in 2 weeks as the EHS Wildcats play for the championship. Gabriella is with the brainy set and expected to compete in the scholastic decathlon. As the song goes, as chorused overwhelmingly by the student body: ""No, no, no - stick to the stuff you know."" But, it turns out, what Troy and Gabriella know best is following their hearts. And singing.

HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL is kid stuff, sure, served up with a bland, run-of-the-mill storyline, and with the usual messages of individuality and following your dreams wholesomely spoonfed to the audience. But it's all executed with a certain vitality and is so darn winning that even creaky, old dogs like me surrender under its spell. HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL is as family friendly as it gets, about as objectionable as a brown-eyed puppy. Efron and Hudgens are sweet together and are most assuredly the biggest reason for Disney's newest monster franchise. Ashley Tisdale (Sharpay) and Lucas Grabeel (Ryan) shouldn't be left out as their sister-brother act is darn sidesplitting.

And most of the songs are pretty catchy. Certainly, tons of fans have propelled the film's soundtrack to the Billboard chart stratosphere.  I'll probably forget these tunes in a week or so, but for now, I've been at it nonstop, humming ""Breaking Free,"" ""Stick to the Status Quo,"" and ""I Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You."" This last song, by the way, is busted out merrily by Efron, Hudgens, Tisdale, and Grabeel (who shows off his chops here) in the dvd's bonus music video.

I also like this movie for the fact that it came out of nowhere to become a phenomenon. The Disney Channel certainly didn't expect all this hubbub at first. But in HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL, we have star turning performances, unbridled, bubbly enthusiasm, and a certain generic charm - all combining to form this happy synergy. And, who knows, just maybe Walt Disney even gave his blessing from his cryogenic chamber. But there's simply no denying that this movie is a bonafide sensation and speedily becoming an unstoppable force. Me, well, color me a fan. And, to demonstrate solidarity, I'll echo the kids at East High: ""Wildcats, everywhere!""",1196380800,2,3702,5.110743801652893

2549557,2,B000F2BNW2,"First of all, I really love musicals. Wicked, Jekyll and Hyde, Phantom of the Opera, Beauty and the Beast, Sweeny Todd, all those good ones. But this would not go on that list.

Eh... This was... alright.

Lets start with the singing. Ashley Tisdale and Vanessa Hudgens can't sing. Tisdale sounds very nasally, especially in ""What I've been Looking For"" and Hudgens... her voice hurts. A lot. When she was singing ""When there was Me and You"" she was way too overdramatic. Just that entire thing. Ugh. Lucas Gabreel was really good, though. I love his voice and I really wish he had his own song, cause he sounds fantastic. Or at least a duet without Tisdales voice next to it. Zac Efron can sing pretty good too.

""Stick to the Status Quo"": I thought it was cute how they would bust out in song and dance, singing that it was uncool to be in a musical. Really, that part made me laugh.

""Breaking Free"": At the end when Troy and Gabriella auditioned, they had full lighting and  an audience and everything. Do you know how much lighting costs? It's really expensive. Trust me, I know because my drama teacher always reminds us of that fact. But this school must have all the money in the world because there was a picture of the basketball team (with Troy in the middle) hanging on the school wall. And this poster was taller than everyone else in the movie and took up an entire wall. It was insane.

This movie bugged me because I'm in High School and everyone in this movie is so shallow. They act overdramatic and they stay in their clicks. High School is NOT like that.

If you want to watch this, I suggest you rent it or borrow it from a friend. Or just wait until it's on Disney Channel again. They like shoving this thing down people's throats, it shouldn't be too long before they show it again.",1195948800,3,1805,4.418674698795181
2549558,5,B000F2BNW2,"""High School Musical"" is a great movie for kids (and for some parents who resist to grow up).",1192492800,,93,4.222222222222222
2549559,3,B000F2BNW2,"At first I was completely opposed to watching this. All of my friends loved it, and at my school you could hear all of my sixth grade classmates singing the songs. Maybe it was the fact that the songs were so chessy, or maybe it was the fact that my friends are terrible singers, but I really didn't want to watch this movie.

However, on a trip to Eagle River to see my friend, I realized that maybe there was more to the movie than meets the eye. Because I trust my friend's judgement in movies, and she raved about HSM, I decided to give it a try.

So, maybe it wasn't the most magical experience. However, I was glad that Disney was at least trying now. I liked the concept of it. I was glad that there was finally a fun-for-everyone movie that talked about peer pressure.

But it wasn't all fun. I have a few complaints:

1) Who the heck decided to cast Vanessa Hudgens? Can you say slut? Also, she's not a very good actor. Maybe she just doesn't know how to do geeky, but she really bombed in HSM. Where did the girl from Thirteen go?

2) The wardrobe. I mean, the geeks dressed like the jocks and popular kids. That's not how it is. I'm not saying that you should stereotype them, I'm just saying that you should try to make each individual character have an individual wardrobe. And the popular kids wear Abercrombie and Fitch, not nerdy shirts with green stripes. Come on. Disney, at least put SOME imagination into it.

3) The lack of realism. I understand that they were trying to do a remake of Grease. It it ain't broke, don't fix it. Grease is unremakable. Especially not by Disney, and especially not with Vanessa Hudgens. I mean, boy meets giirl at party, then must they fall in love without even talking for more than two seconds, and then they must part. Tragic, right? I'm not finished. Poof! Boy and girl end up in same school. Then they sing their problems away and everything falls into place perfectly. GAG! If this movie had been set in junior high, then it would have believable. In junior high, kids care a lot about these kinds of things. In junior high, differences are deadly. But by the time kids reach high school, they're matured and okay with differences.

4) The songs. There were three of them that I hated: The Start of Something New, Getcha Head In The Game, and We're All In This Together. I didn't like The Start of Something New, because like the other reviewer, I also noticed that they didn't have to look at the screen as they sang. Blooper alert! Plus. I know that as you sing you get confidence, but going from shy and timid to, basically, stripping in a matter of seconds is rediculous. I didn't like Getcha Head in the Game because Zac Efron looks totally gay. Literally. I expected him to start singing I'm A Barbie Girl any second. I didn't like We're All in This Together period. Because we're not all in this together. We're all in this separately, with no help and no guidance.

But even with that list of complaints, I do have some good things to say. Zac Efron did a wonderful job in his role as Troy. He's good with the dramatic parts, and he has great comedic timing. Also, whoever casted Ashley Tisdale as Sharpay is a genious! She was fantastic as the mean girl. And I liked Lucas Grabeel as Ryan. He was good at being in Sharpay's shadow, while secretly shining on his own. Plus, I loved the song Stick to the Status Quo. However, like I said before, this song would be better placed in junior high. Overall, decent watch if you're under twelve.",1192406400,5,3504,4.404945904173107

2549565,5,B000F2BNW2,"Because everyone's high school experience is like a little microcosm of society (separate groups competing and manipulating for recognition and control), I think High School Musical is very valuable (and very fun) edutainment for both kids and adults.

In the crucial stage of a teen-ager's search for identity that can often come with suffering to both child and parent, it is a beautiful thing that this movie offers the pure essence of happiness, confidence, and strength.

For me, one portrayal of the high school/society parallel was during the excellent song ""Get'cha Head in the Game"" when Troy sings ""Why am I feeling so wrong? My head's in the game but my heart's in the song."" The battle between the head and the heart is painful no matter what your
age. Society can be too saturated in its compulsion at ""doing things right"" and obligating a person to keep their ""head in the game."" Yet, at the cost of beauty, one's sense of self, and love (as this
movie successfully conveys).

Wonderfully, a happy balance between these two (the head and the heart) and their equal validity is expressed in ""We're All in This Together.""

The Jocks' and the Brainiacs' attempted to divide Troy and Gabriella's relationship for their own agendas (at the manipulation of Sharpay and Ryan). A very beautiful and key part of this movie was when after the two groups failed at this attempt, I perceived that they were so moved by
Troy's & Gabriella's sadness at separation (and guilty by their own behavior, at what they themselves had engineered) that each group sincerely apologizes to the couple for what they have done wrong. A very adult thing to do! This mature behavior turns all of their high school world around. And after further manipulations, this unifying spirit propels the two camps to join with the couple instead of trying harder to separate them and succeed at only their own game.

The joy and celebration of ""We're All In This Together"" confirms the happiness of finding greater success in the joining with others and being who one truly is vs. being separate from others and not being who one truly is! Troy - ""I finally figured out that all our dreams have no
limitations."" Gabriella - ""Everyone is special in their own way, we make each other strong.  We're different in a good way. Together's where we belong.""

The energy from these kids is contagious and the presence of happiness is easily felt!

NOT TO MENTION -- this is a superb musical! Musicals can be corny or dumb, but this is thrilling singing and dancing! Sharpay and Ryan's ""Bop To The Top"" number is so incredible that it leaves me practically speechless because there is so much that could be said on just that
one song alone! But there were no duds whatsoever. Every number was top-notch.",1191024000,,2769,4.766179540709812

I had seen Zac Efron on Summerland and never saw what was so great about him, but he is really great in this role and he can sing really well!  As far as people stating that he is too short to be a basketball star, he is in high school and the average height and weight varies.  I went to school with a very short person on our varsity team as a freshman because he was just really good, so it isn't impossible.  i didn't find it too hard to believe except that he wasn't very built.  In the second one though he looks more the basketball star.  The rest of the cast does and great job and Vanessa has an amazing job.

Nothing about this movie was unexpected; everything from the cheesy dialogue to the cliched plot to the corny songs to the caricatures, I mean characters, were predictable to the point of being campy and over-the-top. And not in a good way. Why exactly is a scrawny, short kid the star of the basketball team? What reasonable people are that frenetically obsessed with maintaining the status quo? And what's up with Sharpay and her brother starring in every school show *together*? Incest, that's a new one for Disney.

2549572,5,B000F2BNW2,"You know, there have been SO MANY MUSICALS to hit the screen since ""Grease"" (released the year I was born), but I can't think of any one musical that you can actually watch again and again and still not tire of.

I mean, would you watch ""Dreamgirls"" again? Even if you did love Beyonce? Yes, its a good film, but you probably would NOT want to watch that movie again. To me, that is the true hallmark of a musical that transcends its material to become almost legendary, and I think this is why ""High School Musical"" has been so successful.

I have friends who are children, and friends over 40 who all know the words to all the songs here. And with good reason! Granted, none of this is exactly earth shattering music - in fact, most of it is good old fashioned cheesy pop music of the ""Hannah Montana"" variety (a bit more polished though). But its simple lyrics and singalong choruses will win you over. I can't wait to see this at a Karaoke theater - this was one movie where I knew the words to most of the songs by the third viewing!

The highlight of this film is the music. I am not a Zac Efron fan, and frankly I found him a bit bizarre looking (some of my friends thinks he looks like a 50 year old woman in drag, but thats a bit extreme), but once I got past that, I found lovable characters almost everywhere. Vanessa Hudgens is a real find. How wonderful that they cast a Hispanic actress to play Gabriella.

To me, the real star of the show was the brother-sister duo of Ryan and Sharpay. Lucas Grabeel is absolutely breathtaking as the singing and dancing boy wonder with an atrocious fashion sense (is his character supposed to be this flamboyant? - it left me wondering), and Ashley Tisdale does an impression of Alicia Silverstone in ""Clueless"" that left me laughing for more. Her one-liners were the best.

Heres the thing, this is not ""Gone with the Wind"" or ""Benhur"". But chances are, when you're looking through your DVD collection on a rainy day, THIS will be the DVD you choose over all others, because I cannot think of any other musical apart from ""Grease"" that is so memorable.

I had read another reviewer complain (a little) about the ""over-the-top"" acting by the Sharpay and Ms. Darbus (drama teacher) characters. It was SUPPOSED to that way, and it worked very well. I actually LOVE Ms. Darbus and was a bit depressed that her role diminished quite a bit in HSM2. I wanted more of her!

2549574,4,B000F2BNW2,"Disney has had its fair share of hits over the decades, but few have been as unexpected as the Disney Channel's HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL.  I finally decided to watch it simply because of the buzz it has received.  I was both pleasantly surprised and mildly disappointed in viewing it.  The mild disappointment is that it was clearly aimed at a much younger age group than I was hoping for.  I would guess that the optimal age group is 6-13, while I had hoped before seeing it that it might be 12 to 18 and thus more interesting to an adult.  Nonetheless, given its target age group and the fact that it originated on TV, it is of remarkably high quality.  This truly is a superior children's movie.

The music was fine, the kind of tunes that you can enjoy instantly without too much of a desire to ever hear again.  The singing was consistently pleasant without be truly outstanding.  The acting and performing all excellent but nothing truly extraordinary.  The cast was solid.  I had some trouble with male lead Zac Efron.  I found him a tad too pretty and his voice was pitched so high that at first I thought he was lip-synching a female singer in the karaoke scene near the beginning.  But my real beef was having him play a basketball star.  If you've played a lot of basketball you develop a host of subtleties in the way you handle a ball, and Efron had none of these.  Still, he had a likable personality.  The real stand out of the cast was Vanessa Anne Hudgens, who reminded me very much of another Disney star of a different era, Annette Funicello.  The two at that age had very similar skin color and tone, similarly shaped faces, were both pretty short (I think Hudgens might be even shorter), and both exceptionally pretty and enormously likable.  The movie didn't ask for Hudgens to act much, but she sang very appealingly.  The large and varied support cast was more than adequate.  I have to add that this is the response of an adult.  For a kid who is 10, Zac Efron's prettiness might be for more a virtue than it is for me and his having more of a soprano than a tenor voice might not be such a negative.

All in all, this is a remarkably well-done movie.  Most adults will probably find it too juvenile in tone to enjoy much, but I can't imagine very many non-animated movies that would be better for a parent to watch with their kid.  And it certainly has to go down as one of the best kid musicals ever produced.  If we exclude animated films with singing, there are amazingly few kids film filled with song.  Perhaps this movie will inspire some imitators in addition to the two sequels that are already in the works.",1187395200,,2637,4.419087136929461

The actors blow, but hey, it's Disney, what do you expect? If you've ever watched a Disney Channel movie, they basically regurgitated those types of people. This movie is basically Disney's way of increasing the amount of cash they receive, and it makes me sick.

2549576,5,B000F2BNW2,"I must admit I had heard of high school musical long before I watched this DVD.  I was skeptical at first, one because I love musicals and there are several of them espically on TV networks that are just not good and two I just didn't want to see a movie that was just good because they good looking kids with ""okay"" singing ability.  I should mention that this is going to have several spoilers in it so if you haven't at least rented the DVD from your local Blockbuster or Netflix or where ever please stop reading this.  This movie for me has a lot of visual images from both West Side Story and from Grease.  The high school scenes and musical sequences like ""Stick to the Status Quo"" and ""We are all in this together"" look very Grease to me.  West Side Story is all over this movie to me, right down to the people they casted for Gabriela Montez and Troy Bolton.  Vanessa Anne Hudges and Zac Efron look like a young Richard Bemer (Tony) and Natalie Wood (Maria).  The party scene where Troy and Gabriella meet is very similar to where Tony and Maria meet in the gym in West Side Story.  Vanessa Anne Hudges is quite possibly the closest dead ringer to Natalie Wood I have ever seen.  Like Natalie she has the ability to make you care about what she is doing even if she is acting a little blank.  The song When There Was Me & You is a direct homage to Maria in West Side Story but this is being told from a heartbroken female point of view.  There is many intimate with Troy and Gabriella that harkin back to the bridal shop scenes and the fire escapes scenes from West Side Story.  The over arching story is really about labels how people see you in high school.  And how there is unwritten rule in high school that certain people in high school don't do certain things.  I.e. Troy the captain of the East High basketball team wants to be in the school musical.  However, he has a lot of pressure from his teammates and from his father who just also happens to be his coach as well.  Gabriella has similar struggles to Troy's she has always been viewed in whatever school she goes to as the ""freaky math girl"" and she just wants to be seen simply as a girl and singing with Troy makes her feel special and normal at the same time.  There is a love story between the two of them but it is more implied.  There is no passionate kissing scenes between the two of them and this probably because of it is a Disney Channel film and supposed to for younger children.  I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did but I do and I'm proud to say it.  If you love musicals and or love stories you'll like this movie it isn't too long and as far as the special features you might want to buy the 2 disc special edition of this DVD also found on Amazon.com because it has much more stuff on how the movie was made.  Lastly, the Director and chareographer of this film Kenny Ortega has quite a resume.

2549580,1,B000F2BNW2,"Okay, this should really be a zero, but this rating system won't allow it.

First of all, this movie has nothing interesting that hasn't been seen already: the struggle to move from the social norm has been done so many times I wonder who the heck started it (Probably ""Pride and Prejudice""). Anyway, this is nothing new.

This movie is no great shakes. It doesn't really say much to call it ""A hit"" because anyone can say that. And I don't really understand why people are so into it. It doesn't grab me. Maybe I've seen too many films already, but that proves my point, it does nothing for me. I like intelligent films. Films that have meanings under the words being said, new themes, new ways of introducing those themes. And new words in songs for it to be a musical. If you think that this movie is good when you're five, okay, fine. But not past seven. At age seven most kids who are my age had already started reading books like ""Holes"", not the best movie, but a good book. And Harry Potter isn't bad either. It's something a little different, I respect that.

But again, High School Musical is nothing more than an opportunity for a bunch of high school age actors to get famous. Not everyone I know can sing like that, even me. So, I know that not everyone can sing in reality. Now, you want an accurate and funny school musical? I suggest ""You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown"". Peanuts is a classic, funny, and realistic view of how kindergarten is, and it's fun to sing along to!

Geniuses like Charles Shultz, Walt Disney, and JRR Tolkien, cannot be just attempted to copy and then labeled as great within a short three years or less of filming. In reality, most experts say it takes ten years minimum to be an expert. And the LOTR movies came close by taking seven years to create the movies, they were flawed, but Tolkien's world was captured.

High School musical fails to capture anything but a gag and acid in my throat. I can't believe how loosely labeled this movie is.

Next, the people who watch this need a reality check. Who actually thinks that high schools are like this? I go to an arts high school (And people sing, yes) but it is by far not like that at all. And the other thing is why, why, why can a science nerd sing? It makes no sense! If you focus on your studies, logically, you will have no after school time for music lessons. And same goes for basketball jocks. And this is really all too complimentary of jocks. I've been to many places and seen jocks. They are all one demensional as they are stereotyped. Not that some aren't different. But what needs to be said is that when you have something you concentrate on, say, hockey, you need another person who you can see who has a similar schedule. Anyway, that's how real high school works. I don't even know if the Disney staff wants people to be prepared for the real thing. All I know is that this is not it.

The only thing that was somewhat appealing was the music, and even that was only because it was catchy, otherwise it sucked.

I agree with the other reviewers, this movie tries to hit new (Excuse my bad pun) ""notes"" but it is so far off with its singing characters trying to overcome their conflict of being stuck under pressure. Yeah, sure, I get that it's a conflict, being under pressure in school, but the movie is so ludicrous about how the problem is solved. I'm not trying to be morbid, but singing doesn't solve diddily squat.

Not to mention the songs are really annoying. Songs have to have more than one line. End of story. Even the Beatles (good band by the way) have more than just ""We all live in a yellow submarine"" and it's catchy, but there's a point.

There's a story in those songs that requires thought. High School Musical made me feel brain dead. I couldn't think about anything that wasn't in the song already.

I might want to add that to be a Disney movie, it has to be a movie with a good plot that is original. Which it's not. I've seen movies about overcoming social barriers at least fifty times before now and I've enjoyed better musicals. Good example (Cynical) but good: ""Avenue Q"", good show with music that says something about our society and is funny at the same time. That's entertaining.

I was not really interested in High School Musical simply because after I saw the comercials, there was nothing left to see. I watched it to see if I was wrong, but I wasn't.

Story:Girl meets guy at party, girl and guy leave. Girl and guy meet up at school. Girl and guy are on separated sides of social status. Girl and guy fight status and win and sing about it. There you have it.

The reason for my statement about the ""Rip Off""? Oh, that, maybe some of you should take a look at the (I think even before 1999) film ""Grease"" and tell me if that looks familiar.

Two high school kids meet and then meet again later to find out they go to the same school. The guy is popular... get the idea? I liked Grease and I think it deserves all the credit this High School Musical is getting.

Second of all, Disney is dead. Not dying, dead. Great classics like ""The Lion King"" and ""Fox and the Hound"" aren't produced any more. Kids of this generation have been cheated out of a good movie and TV experience.

Shows like ""Kim Possible"" and ""Spongebob Squarepants"" barely make the cut for good shows.

Good shows are more than just social problems, get creative! Anime has the same plot, but... the guy might turn into an animal or demon (something like Beauty and the Beast) and the girl has to deal with the guy being a demon and having to hide his identity. That is good drama. And heck, they can sing about it and make it seem funny because it's serious when your boyfriend might end up killing the school if you're not careful. Morbid humour, yes, but it's interesting to watch.

For example: Grease is a good movie because it touched a new subject.

High School Musical is a sad version that I was laughing at (Not because it was funny) but because it was a sorry excuse for an overated film).

I have a suggestion for you disney goers: STOP WATCHING DISNEY CHANNEL BEFORE YOU REALIZE HOW MUCH TIME YOU'VE WASTED!! Disney has not produced too many good movies since Disney himself died. Okay ones have been ""Smart House"" and ""The Thirteenth Year"" about a sinister house and a merman. Not bad, really. I haven't exactly seen too many Merman movies, mostly mermaid ones. And I have heard of horror movies with senile houses, but this one was bittersweet, but good. Might want to watch those instead.

With few exceptions of some shows with good acting, the Disney Channel does not produce good shows.

Suggestions: Go to your TV guide channel and watch these shows/channels: Comedy Central (most of the time it has hillarious comedians) I really like Dane Cook and Mind of Mencia isn't bad either), watch Adult swim on Saturday nights (for teens and older), Avatar is excellent (It's not American by the way), Don't watch the Cartoon Network versions of Anime shows, go to Youtube or rent them. Watch the subs not dubs! (Meaning, don't watch it in English, they're overedited, the voices stink, and they are censored like there's no tomorrow). Oh, if you do watch Nicktoons, watch Avatar, Danny Phantom, and (Buy or rent this) ""Invader Zim"".

2549581,4,B000F2BNW2,"I'm one who has been very skeptical of the Disney Channel for sometime. Much of their programming depicts a very antiquated idea of High School. Before seeing this movie, I assumed it would follow in the pattern. After seeing it, though, I will say I was pleasantly surprised.

The portrayal of East High was more or less accurate of a real high school, though the lines between the cliques were a little too clearly drawn. Cliques are rarely, at least in my experience, as well defined as they are in this movie. There is usually a fair bit of mingling among different cliques, unlike in High School Musical. However, it's nothing that isn't easy to overcome, especially for younger audiences who likely won't know the difference anyway.

The soundtrack, while a little annoying at times, definitely contains a few toe-tappers that are enjoyable to listen to. However many of the songs, though enjoyable, seem out of place in my opinion. The movie is about kids auditioning for a musical. Accordingly, many of the songs fit perfectly into the story line (i.e. Start of Something New, Breaking Free, etc.) while others seem forced into the movie in order to make it a musical unto itself (i.e. Get'cha Head in the Game, Stick to the Status Quo, etc.).

The actors are all great picks for their respective parts. Vanessa Anne Hudgins is a joy to watch. Zac Efron seems to move his mouth a lot more than necessary during songs but does an otherwise respectable job.

Overall, this is a good movie. Enjoyable even to some older audiences, and greatly enjoyable to the younger ones. There are a few faults that older viewers might notice but this is a great choice for kids and some young-hearted adults too.",1180569600,2,1704,4.746621621621622

I was a major fan of Grease and Dirty Dancing, the Brady Bunch and the Partridge Family. This was the clean version of all of those. The star of the movie looks like a young David Cassidy, from the lips, to the eyes to the voice. And that's not a bad thing. While I was having fun reliving my youth, my daughter was up and down dancing along with the actors every time they broke into song. Oh, and I must point out the film was directed by one of motion pictures TOP choreographers (Dirty Dancing, Newsies and much more), turned director, Kenny Ortega.

I planned to watch a few minutes, and get the general idea of the show. I ended up watching the entire movie - couldn't take my eyes away. The scenes move quickly and hold your interest. The actors are talented and because they are actually high school-aged, they seem so genuine. The messages of the movie are great for all ages. NO bad language, no violence or indecency. Parents are respected, and so are the kids!  And if you ever went to high school, you are sure to find reminders of the friends/students you knew ""back when"".

I can see why the overt message about cliques is popular, but getting that message from watching the lives of incredibly rich kids in a world where the biggest problems are cliques, made it seem shallow.  We're all in this together...those of us with money anyway.  We're all stars...since we have enough money, a great school, and lots of equipment, and parental involvement.

2549614,3,B000F2BNW2,"I feel a little cruel picking on something so pure of heart. They just want you to be yourself (especially if you can do so while singing and dancing) and have a great time while you're at it. But this is some pretty hokey stuff right here. The characters are nothing more than plastic rich kids who have no personality. One wears a pink beret (while simultaneously being male). Another carries a basketball with him wherever he goes like this is some kind of Bazooka Joe comic or something. Their idea of a problem is being too smart, or having to survive the dreaded 15 minute detention. The musical numbers feel taken straight off of Broadway only with a little high school flavoring added to them. One uses bouncing basketballs as music and another takes place in a cafeteria. The film itself can't be considered good even though it really tries, the cheese factor is just too overwhelming in this case.

Their points are very noble. They start off by teaching kids that being smart is more valuable than being pretty, but who is really gonna listen to that one? Then in movies into another overarching theme which says that the status quo should be bunked in favor of your true desires. That's all fine and good but we all know that peer mockery trumps Disney Channel morality any day of the week. Our main characters are Troy and Gabriella, a jock and a nerd respectively, who both secretly pine for the glory of theater. But since kids these days have taken a real liking to passing judgment their classmates are constantly obstructing their way to this goal. And even though the movie is about high school theater it is in no way a love letter. The theater teacher is a crazy old bat who spends her days spouting nonsense and turning detention into her own little forced labor camp. Then there is Sharpay and Ryan, a brother sister duo, who take the idea of lame drama geeks to a whole new high. Of course they are so over the top in their love of theater only to make Troy and Gabriella, also theater geeks, look normal by comparison but it doesn't totally wash. The performances here are all good but my guess is that these poor actors will be embarrassed by this later in life.

The singing itself was somewhat detrimental in my opinion.  Their voices were all so angelic and flawless that I kept hoping for a Tom Waits cameo. It was all just too much. The school spirit was so off the charts that it had me groaning. The ending was too perfect. The boys were a little too hairless. I would also like to state that the ""Punk'd"" joke they went for was a total miss and performed soooo much better in ""Just Friends."" I can't muster any anger towards the film because it was exactly what I expected. A morality play with song and dance and not much budget that hopes to overwhelm you with silliness to the point where you just get used to it and surrender. The sensation that it caused is why I saw it, but even after seeing it I still don't understand what all the fuss is about. Of course, I also don't understand how ""The Covenant"" won the box office either. **3/4",1170374400,4,3075,4.458259325044405

The story of High School Musical is rather predictable but for children and teens it is a wonderful opportunity for them to realize that school and life offers them opprotunities and to never give up exploring them.

I loved the songs and the dancing and the good wholsesome fun.  A particlar poignant moment was when the basketball star's father said to just have fun whiel playing in the championship game.

2549627,1,B000F2BNW2,"And if that title doesn't serve as sufficient warning of what sort of silliness this piece of fluff has in store for you, then maybe the opening scene should. At a New Year's Eve party, two youngsters are picked at random from among the crowd to sing a karaoke duet. They don't know each other. The guy is a varsity basketball player, the girl is a science geek, who wastes no time establishing her character by sitting by herself and reading a book - at a party. And guess what? They both sing well. Not just that, they're both good-looking. Talk about contrived openings. After the impromptu showstopper, they talk, get to know each other, discover their common love for music, and exchange phone numbers. Of course, the mutual attraction has begun. Yawn.

From that point on, you may want to continue watching this movie in the hopes that it will get better. Trust me, it doesn't. It starts out bad, and it stays bad.

The girl's geek friends tell her, and the guy's basketball teammates tell him, not to waste their time trying out for the musical. And they do it in song and dance. Duh... don't join a musical, they say, but they're in one. Creative license? No, it's just plain dumb. (I was almost expecting some equivalent of that Pirates of the Caribbean character to enter the scene and tell these kids, ""You better start believing in musicals. You're in one!"")

And what exactly is the point of that ""Stick to the Status Quo"" number? So what if an athlete bakes, a skater plays the cello, and a geek girl likes hip-hop? Would their friends really go ""no, no, no, no!""? If anything, I imagine they would find these revelations interesting.

The characters are as flat as pancakes. Funny how a movie that purports to be all about breaking stereotypes, being true to what you want to be, and not limiting yourself to what others expect of you, fails so miserably at at least making the characters interesting.

Earlier-mentioned geek and baller not only pass the audition, they get the lead parts, over the school's two most frequent lead players, based on one song they sing at the callback. Excuse me, but shouldn't you show your acting and dancing prowess as well as your musical skills before you get the lead parts in a musical?

The songs are mediocre at best. Nothing really jumps out at you the way songs in a musical should. Sure, they mostly have nice, bouncy, danceable tunes, but nothing here is particularly memorable. You don't find yourself humming any of the songs after viewing the movie.

The ending is even more contrived than the beginning. In fact, it's so bad, it's sickening. Hey, let's all be friends now, we're all in this together. Ugh.

And please don't tell me, hey, lighten up, it's a movie for kids, etc., etc. That's no excuse for shoddy storytelling, scripting, characterization, songwriting and acting. Look at Disney's past theatrical releases: The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, and Tarzan are just a few of the made-for-kids Disney films that adults can enjoy. Why? Because they had good stories, good scripts, good songs, and good characters. You won't find any of these in HSM.

But the characters lack any semblance of reality or even convincing stereotypes that would make you identify with them. Gabriella, as the supposed brainiac, is gorgeous and dressed to kill.  All of her other brainiac friends are equally adorable.  Sorry, not how I remember the brain geeks at school.  The basketball jocks (who want Troy to skip the auditions in favor of playing in the ""big game,"") and the brainiacs (who want Gabriella to skip the auditions in order to compete in the Scholastic Decathalon) put together a mean-hearted plan to squash their friends' theatrical ambitions by convincing Gabriella that Troy is just a lowly, dumb jock who doesn't care about her or the school play anyway. They are convincing enough to make Gabriella cry (which doesn't seem to upset her ""friends"" in the least,) and temporarily derail the pair.  But suddenly and inexplicably, the friends all become remorseful, apologize, and decide to support Gabriella and Troy by throwing a monkey wrench into their prospective obligations so that they can skip out early and participate in the auditions.  The only highlights were Sharpay and Ryan, who WERE convincing as the theatre-obsessed duo, (who incidentally, put on the better performance at the audition.)  In general, this movie lacked ANY originality, any surprises, and anything that made me identify with or like the main characters.  The girls were all overly thin, overly pretty, and overly made up, perpetuating that damaging ALL-GIRLS-SHOULD-BE-THIN- PRETTY-AND-MADE-UP message.  Grease is one of my all time favorite movies ever.  Please don't compare this weak excuse for a musical to Grease.  Once your kids are about 12, pop that movie into the DVD player.  They (and you) will not be disappointed.",1168992000,6,2379,5.010178117048346

First, it demonstrates high schhol age children engaging in positive activities and it also sends the message that you can experience and excel at a number of things despite being know for just one particular talent, sport etc.  (Tween/Teen movies with postive messages such as these are hard to come by these days).  Secondly, the teens in this movie overcome their fears and perform in an unforgetable performance!

The music in the movie cover basically most of the top 40 styles that are popular today. The acting is passable, considering they are teenagers and young adults, and the movie is made for tweens. The talent is amazing!

Your daughter will know every song by heart as she watches... sorta like your wife knows every song in Grease and Dirty Dancing.

2549643,5,B000F2BNW2,"I found myself just as enthralled and amused by this movie as my kids were.  It is cheesy, yet entertaining and very humorous at times.  The songs are catchy and the brother and sister act, Sharpay and Ryan, are hilarious in their roles.  It is the Grease of this generation but with an important difference:  it really is a G movie that kids of all ages can watch.  There isn't any smoking, drinking, talk about teenage pregnancy, brawls, etc.  The movie does highlight issues like teenage competitiveness, fitting in, and vanity, but in ways that are amusing and helpful with an overall message that you shouldn't have to stick to a particular mold or succumb to peer pressure.

I wish there were more movies like this where my 2 1/2 and 5 year old can dance and sing along and my older (up to 9 year old) nephews are also interested in the storyline and music.  This movie is one of the few I let my young-uns watch that was not specifically made for kids in their age group but is engaging, sweet, and everyone can enjoy it (like Milo and Otis and Mary Poppins).",1167955200,5,1066,4.430769230769231

There are no 30 year olds pretending to be 16 year olds.

While, people don't break out in song in the cafeteria in real life, the theme in the movie is still relatable.

I love the fact that it teaches, its okay to break out from your friends and do something different.

There are no cheesy songs, they are all good.

2549647,5,B000F2BNW2,"I just LOVE this musical that was shown first on the Disney Channel. Too bad it wasn't in theatres as it is really good for all ages despite being tagged as for the tweens (teens & those in their 20's). It is reminiscent of Grease from the 70's but is completely clean in every way. The music is also very good and you'll find yourself singing along. I guess that's why they came out with the karaoke version! If you love music and romantic movies, this film is for you!

Two teens come together through music even though they seem to be on opposite sides of the social spectrum. He's the captain of the basketball team & coach's son, and she's a shy Math & Science whiz. They are thrown together to sing at a New Year's Eve party, and then find they are at the same school in the new year. They come to have feelings for each other and together try out for the school musical. Zac Efron really does an outstanding acting and singing job in this movie, and I can understand why he is a top teen star right now. Vanessa Anne Hudgens is also very good in her role. The romance between the 2 characters is light and very sweet. There are so many romantic moments that you will want to play over and over again. I especially love the part when he sings for her. There are some good messages in this film such as following your dreams and not worrying about what other kids think of you. It deals with peer pressure and how the two teens need to pursue their dreams despite the interference from their friends.

I see that a sequel to this movie will be made soon. I can hardly wait! :)",1167091200,2,1581,4.231788079470198

So the recepie is right on today's entertainment standard of refried, reprocessed products. In concept, nothing new. But this time, Disney's creative genius cooked the idea at full heat, and SURPRISE, IT WORKED BIG TIME. So in spite of being formulatic, it's family entertainment done right. To younger audiences its fresh and new of course, but it will appeal to adults, specially those who lived the 80's in their youth (that now have kids & teens), because this movie does retain somekind of entertainment element that has been missing from pop-music and movies for some time. The songs are good, the story is simple, the dancing is cool. Maybe too clean by today's standards, but that's the good thing. This movie proves that quality entertainment for teens (and younger) can still be done without the violence+sex thing and be successful.

To us, it is the modern day ""Grease"" - full of energetic songs and dances, and a lovely budding romance between the hero and heroine.  Teenagers love it because of it is a movie of their generation - high school ups and downs, friendship, and modern day angst (but in a very PG way).

I cant take her seriously because she goes so far over the top. People don't actually act like that. Zac Efron and Vanessa and Lucas aren't bad actors and they pretty much fit the part. As far as singing goes the only person who could actually sing was Lucas. I am not overly critical of peoples voices, but Vanessa and Ashley both have very nasal voices. That is a sign of an undeveloped voice. and in Ashley's case she is 21 she should know by now that she cant sing. It doesnt really matter that Zacs voice isn't his own.

Now back on the subject on why I hated this movie. The actor with expection for only a few CAN NOT SING, heck some of them could barley act. kind of a biggie when doing a musical. The music was alright, there was a couple of good songs but they were most of the time screwed up by someone who couldn't sing. Last by not least THE PLOT ummm okay garbage is the first word that comes to mind. The kids give up nothing and everything works out in the end. School happy, boy's dad is happy even the pretty popular girl is happy. Give me a BREAK. Yeah this is a Disney movie but still that doesn't happen in real life. The Biggest opps of the whole movie was the fact that the pretty blond siblings's song was better then the ugly underdog's song and yet the ugly underdogs won. Oh and by the way getting extra lessons with the play writer is not allowed.

Bright spot of the movie

Yes there was one person who could sing, dance and act that was Ashley Tisdale (Sharpay Evens) the rest were could do with a cast change.",1158969600,2,1147,4.1855203619909505
2549677,5,B000F2BNW2,"Why has ""High School Musical"" become such a phenomenon amongst the teen demographic that it has become the highest-rated Disney original TV movie, earned 6 Emmy nominations, a chart topping soundtrack, and now licensed to become a stage production? Because it is honestly a very good film that, given the right audience, will have you singing and dancing along and rooting for its characters. With its infectious pop numbers, spot-on choreography, and appealing cast, ""High School Musical"" is a delight with many lessons and morals that young teens face today that make it incredibly positive and appropriate. The cast is very attractive yes, but most of all, downright talented. The story follows two teenagers (Zac Efron as Troy Bolton and Vanessa Hudgens as Gabriella Montez) who defy the norms of their high school society by trying out for the winter musical, thus throwing the school in an uproar but still inspiring others along the way. The stuff in this movie are very entertaining, which include clashing cliques, clever plot schemes, and a hilarious American Idol-like auditions scene. Efron and Hudgens have remarkable chemistry, and with meant-to-be vocal harmonies. The snotty Sharpay Evans (Ashley Tisdale) and her brother Ryan (Lucas Grabell) are comic relief with their spontaneity and crowd-pleasing theatrics. As for the songs, ""What I've Been Looking For,"" ""Breaking Free,"" and ""Get'cha Head In The Game,"" are all standouts. My personal favorite is ""We're All In This Together,"" a feel-good, catchy, and inspiring finale with the message of friendship and teamwork. Be prepared to have these songs hooked in your head for days! Definitely a must for kids, teens active in vocal/drama/dance, or fans of movie musicals. I will admit, I did not understand all the hype surrounding its release, but when I went to go check it out, it came off as surprisingly fun and entertaining. The DVD contains a short music video, a ""making of"" behind-the-scenes feature, a song not included in the movie, and a dance teaching session (""Bop To The Top""). Don't miss it!",1158019200,3,2073,5.136094674556213

What I found was a very light-hearted and delightful FAMILY musical, yes musical, with very catchy tunes along with a slim but agreeable storyline.  Somewhat similar to Grease but not as greasy!  At least all the teenagers are played by actors ~18-20 years old (wasn't Rizzo around 35?:)!

Who said musicals are dead?  It took Disney and a DCOM movie to prove the format CAN & SHOULD be done again.  And speaking of catchy tunes, I can't get the darn ""Breaking Free"" song out of my mind.

From a technical standpoint, as Disney filmed this movie in  1.78:1 aspect ratio, I'm super sorry that Disney didn't release either DVD releases in an anamorphic widescreen format.  Think of all the extra money they could have extorted from the buying public by offering both FF (YUCK) & WS.  They matted the original print to 1.33:1 for 'The Disney Channel' but, (sigh) when does contemporary Disney Corp ever honor Uncle Walt's innovative cinema standards?.",1158019200,7,1050,4.751381215469613
2549679,2,B000F2BNW2,"High School Musical is a musiCAL (a crude form of musical in which there is no acting)- but it sure as heck isn't about High School.

This movie is in a series of many stories written about the Golden Years of life for children in kindergarten, so that they can look forward to the point when every one is nice, a winner, and able to follow their dreams. Hopefully, though, they'll realize that by the time they get to High School, their school teams will win very few games, they won't be guaranteed the lead in the school musiCAL, or a cute boyfriend.

The songs are so obnoxious- imagine Grease. Now, part of Grease is that's practically about real life- mixed up relationships, drugs, sex, alcohol, and cliques. HSM has relationships and cliques, but it isn't anywhere close enough to buoy the movie.

Take ""The Start of Something New."" What a horrid way to start a movie!! Take a cute guy and he can sing (this in itself is a rarity) and add a smart girl who is a total floozy (honestly, I swore I could see straight through her) and voila! What else!! They fall in love during a magical karoke song!!

Plus, as a devout theatre participant, I must denounce the entire audition. Not only are Sharpay and Ryan obnoxious, exagerated, and unrealistic, two people would never push around the director or screenwriter that way because directors will always, always look for people they personally want to work with.

Plus, it is absolutely inconceivable that there are 2 drama club participants who can sing well. And, since Sharpay is such a musical geek, do you honestly think she'd flirt so hard with Troy? NO!! She might like him, but she wouldn't flirt with him!!

The only redeeming qualities are . . . uh, I don't know!!",1157414400,11,1727,4.590909090909091

They talked about Johnny Tsunami, and Kim Possible, and I'm like ""Gag Gag Gag"". I found this to be rather good as it shows that not all jocks are insensitive, and all brainiacs are hiding in books. The songs are above average, and the cast is rather good where they all seem to gel together, and this made me regret not having participated more in high school, but being a traditional musical out of the cut of Garland/Rooney, or Astaire/Rogers the ending got to be a little too much. Not the way they merged the musical recital, and the basketball game together, but the musical number at the end. ""We're all in this together"" is a relevant song, and I feel that this is right, but can't take this seriously as we as human beings sing this, but we don't believe. I feel if we did believe in this that I can certainly appreciate it more. Other than that it's a good Disney vehicle.",1157414400,,1025,4.4

wrong but doesn't a musical require singers that actually sing?!

Jock and geek fall in love.  Jock and geek's friends try to tear them apart

due to scocial status.  Jock and geek find a way to be together in the end

and

everyone is happy.  BORING!  HSM is just another way for Disney to get their

actors a singing carrer.  Enter Ashley Tisdale and Vanessa Anne

Other documentaries can be produced, including such based on the successes of translating the movie to musicals in actual high schools.

Overall, the movie is great for kids, but adults may be bored with the unoriginal, mostly single-level story.  The musical sections can be appreciated by all ages; however, the movie does suffer a bit from the casting challenge of finding kids who can sing well, have a nice voice, look attractive, and can act.  (Of course, singing with, for example, nasal or thin voices, hasn't hampered the success of many popular singers, so this should not bother many viewers.)",1157155200,,850,4.801369863013699

Composed by a great cast of actors and singers, EXCELLENT without a doubt, it presents us a proposal different from entertainment and music where for I finish it triumphs the desires of making it what feels each one, before what they think the other ones.

A great work of Disney Channel

Diseada para toda la familia desde el mas grande hasta el mas chico disfrutar de esta simptica pelcula, que no ensea que el trabajo en equipo puede lograr derribar los problemas, nos invita a que todos aceptemos lo que somos y no nos mintiramos a nosotros mismo, a veces el dejarse convencer de los dems puede provocar un dao muy grande a nosotros mismos.

Although Troy clearly attempts to kiss Gabriella two times, both times he is interrupted. It is extremely rare to see a movie without any physical romance! Even the ""G"" rated Ice Princess has kissing! The characters in the movie are concerned about breaking out of the stereotype cliques they belong to and whether or not they will be accepted by their friends if they do.  The moral of the movie is that they should follow their hearts, break free of the stereotypes, and do what they think is best.  There is a scene where Troy even stands up to his father for boxing him in to the jock role. The diversity of the characters is a plus.  And it doesn't hurt that Kenny Ortega (who directs a lot of Gilmore Girls episodes and choreographed Dirty Dancing) was in charge! The dance scenes are entertaining for everyone and the original songs are decent songs, sung by amazing talents. Vanessa Anne Hudgins' voice in particular has a wonderful tone to it.

2549695,1,B000F2BNW2,"This movie sucks!

This movie is unrealistic and is full of flaws. This is .... Disney ChanneL is broadcasting every SINGLE day!

I'll list some flaws.

1) This movie portrays high school as an Utopian society where dudes can tolerate geeks and even to a high - flown, ""romantic"" case of Troy, the most popular guy in school, loves Gabriella, a girl who would not leave her books, except to sing. This is sad because this movie does not portray the harsh life of a nerd and the neverending superiority of snobby dudes and arrogant jerks, the reality we all should face. Eventually the movie shows their love as simple - as if trying to add their friends to separate them from each others is going to cause reality in teenagers' love life. The reality is teenagers will be tempted by drinking, drugs, sex, etc., and they will face lots of problems. High School Musical should be about the reality of high school, not unrealistic 'romantic"" quest to be a star in a musical.

2. Everyone is, without knowing themselves, doing the musical, and they are telling their friends not to join a musical?!

3. The snobby girl and her brother are annoying but not true villains who stir hatred among audiences. They just accept the fact they lose and became friends with Troy and Gabriella, completely unrealistic, for they were enemies even before the sign - up, and even if they're rivals in theater they never supported one another. The snobby girl made the rehearsal a day before, when Troy had a game and Gabriella a knowledge bowl, so she is an enemy, to become friends with our protagonists is to set a booby trap, but here in this movie, she has no malice, this is not realistic in the real world. the screenwriter tries to deny this, a very sad fact indeed.

4. A principal who shows favoritism for the basketball coach instead of the theater teacher. The principal cared about winning a basketball championship game instead of discipline policy laid down by Mrs. Darbus because the students were disrespectful in class. A basketball game over discipline policy. This is why teenagers do whatever they want, because they are not controlled by the authority. Authority must show who's the boss around here, not the teenagers, but THEM.

5. Troy's friend and Gabriella's friend fell in love after they, who were ""bitter"" to each other,worked together to separate the love of Troy and Gabella and singing, is coincidential and unrealistic, because it is not developed enough.

6. All the teachers are shown as obsessive of their own goals. Mrs. Darbus over her class of theater, and Troy's dad over basketball, principal over basketball.

7. Speaking of the principal, the principal's acting is horrible. I d on't remember the line very well(after all, it is a forgettable piece of trash), but he said, ""WE ARE ONE FACULTY, ONE SCHOOL!"" If you hear carefully, he sounded like ready to burst into laughter. Really!

She told be it would get better, but guess what it never ever did. There was nothing at all good in that horrible movie. I can't believe they call it a musical. Is this supposed to be a kid musical? Because I did not know that that meant a corny predicable thing. The songs have no meaning and I hate them. This by far the worst musical I have ever seen, no wait it is too bad to be a musical, it is by far the utter most horrible movie. What ever happened to real musical's : Annie get your gun, Phantom of the Opera, Rent, Music Man, West Side Story, South Pacific Wicked, Les Miz. Avenue Q., I could go on for ever. I hope this is not what musicals have come to. It is the worst thing i have ever heard or laid my eyes on.",1153612800,10,1147,3.8438818565400843
2549707,1,B000F2BNW2,"this is for everyone who has been raving about this film. I'm personally just a bit confused as to why and feel that these people need an intervention involving ANY classic musical , a title that this will NEVER recieve. and i mean any musical, even the classic animated disney films would serve quite nicely since this is time for a diar help.

this ""musical"" has many problems strting with, well the music. it is lacluster at best, and even modern pop acts would never perform this fluff. the songs hold no weight or meaning and fail to advance the story, the only character traits they reveal we already knew! the truely disturbing thing is that the music may be the best part! the story line is absurdity captured on film. anyone who thinks this represents high school should go back, or wait to get there. the drama kids, jocks and ""nerds"" are all nice, and no one cares about cliques and *gasp* singing in the musical. also, how is it high school musical if we only see the audition process, much more goes into a musical production. that could have been used to flesh out the film, but i guess that's what sequels are for, and i'm guessing we'll be tortured with one or eighteen knowing disney chanel. as for a side note, how did the two that were less talented get the parts? sharpay and ryan were far better, but troy and gabriella got the parts. WTF?!

then there's the element of them bursting into song, hey i've got no problem with musicals. phantom of the opera is probably my favorite movie, but with HSM, we never learn why the singers are singing. at first it seems deliberate and conceous with early songs like ""start of something new"", but by ""get'cha head in the game"", it seems like they are just singing and that should be normal, which is also fine. the writters just needed to pick one method. (the really screwing thing is that that phantom uses both methods but actually makes it work.) the acting is also way over exagerated through most of the film, and the singing talents are far less than sub-par. the voices and songs all sound like useless pop songs from the late 1990's (not exactly the mark of a classic). i just don't understand why everyone is so enamored with this lovely little piece of trash which should have debuted, and dissapeared.

PS i really don't get how this can get emmy nominations for everything from direction to choreography to outstanding music and lyrics, did the acadamy hear the lyrics!! but the truely scary part is phantom was more or less snubbed at the oscars, but at least phantom of the opera will remain a timelss clasic musical, while high school musical will just be forgotten, god willing.

and for all the parents that think this is so great for their kids, stereotypes are NEVER good, and that's all the characters are. if you want good clean fun, just get them old disney moveies, it worked for the rest of us!!",1153612800,15,2882,4.536538461538462
2549708,5,B000F2BNW2,"I know this is billed as a movie for tweens, but as a 34-year old male, I personally love it. The story takes place in an idealized, fantasy high school, one you'd wish you'd gone to yourself. The nemeses of the film's heroes aren't malicious or even really that mean, just competitive. Not being familiar with a single actor in this, despite later learning that several were quite popular and ""famous"" in the tween or Disney genre, I fell in love with each one. The two leads, especially, have a real innocent and touching romantic relationship. Good for tweens and young kids in that the only affection is shown by holding hands and a kiss on the cheek. But mostly it's the positive message, and the heart right there under the surface of the entire picture, that really got me. It made me feel like finding true love, overcoming fears, and achieving one's dreams are all possible.

I was unsure whether or not to watch this movie (due to the fact that most/all of Disney orginal movies are 2-dimensional and well-worn.) But I had heard it had gotten good reviews, so Iwatched it. It was horendous. The songs were terrible. Starting with the 2nd song ""Get'cha Head in he Game"" (Which got an Emmy nomination for some reason) Istarted skipping all of the songs. The acting was terrible. Sometimes, I put my face in my hands, and shook my head, and then looked around in embarresment to see if anyone saw that I was watching this awful movie. Everything in the movie  was either predictable or unrealistic. I also felt annoyed that the movie was just about the auditions. I felt like THEN WHAT!!!!

2549718,5,B000F2BNW2,"The Studios of Hollywood should really take notice of this film.  It points out so much that is wrong about Hollywood films.  Are you as amazed as I am about all of the really bad films that Hollywood churns out every year?

Disney comes up with a ""Bollywood"" type film that is G-rated.  I'm sure most producers and studio execs were scoffing that this project and thinking, ""There's no way this movie will take off.  Nobody watches G-rated films anymore, and certainly not a musical.""

This smash hit film is fun for everyone.  I don't care what age you are, you can sit down with your family and friends and enjoy a fun, up-lifting, sensational film that will leave a smile on your face!  You will probably also ask the inevitable question: ""Why aren't more American films like this one?""

The tradition of India's Bollywood films is to always have song and dance.  A famous Indian actor was quoted, ""A movie without music and dance for us is the same as a movie without special effects for Westerners."" Also, the music of many Bollywood films isn't just music.  The lyrics actually have something to say, usually with words of inspiration or encouragement.  I noticed that the songs in High School Musical followed the same tradition.

Bollywood films are catching fire all around the world.  I know.  I lived in Kazakhstan for 2 years where Bollywood films are loved.  America seems to be the last place on Earth where Bollywood is still vying for a spot of interest.

High School Musical is a great film about a young boy, Troy, (Zac Efron) who is a star basketball player at his local high school.  He is pulled on ""stage"" by his friends at a karaoke party to sing with the new girl, Gabriella (Vanessa Anne Hudgens), who spends most of her time studying.  These two characters quickly discover that they sing very well...especially together!  Efron plays the ""cool"" Troy without going overboard with the stereotype.  He's a good guy with a cool head who is not as egotistical as what you might think.  Hudgens plays Garbriella with a soft cuteness and gentleness which makes are very appealing.  She has a tender smile which helps the audience tap into the wholesomeness of her character.

When these two characters contemplate trying out for the winter musical, they find themselves in a quandry between maintaining their ""reputations"" with their friends (since their friends don't know about their hidden talent!) and following their hearts and dreams.

What really makes this film compelling, isn't just the music.  It's about unification.  American high schools are torn apart by prejudicial clicks.  This film tries to convey the message that we can look past the differences and support each other.

The story really is a simple one, but they really make the most of it.  This movie should almost be required viewing in high school.  It may help our teenagers learn a lot about themselves.

The song and dance routines in this movie are first-rate.  And you can tell that the actors and actresses had a blast doing it.  You'll find yourself clapping and cheering from beginning to end.

And let's hope that Hollywood looks to make some films like this one, and that Disney makes more!  I certainly have not had enough!",1152489600,3,3231,4.779385171790235

Other great features include a behind-the-scenes look at how the film was made and interviews with the cast.  There is also a feature that teaches some of the dances.

2549722,5,B000F2BNW2,"This movie was such a refreshing change from most ""tween"" movies. It's a rare treat to find that someone has decided to make a modern-day movie with clean language, without any adult/sexual situations or suggestions, and without any questionable social or moral issues --one that I can show to my kids over and over again without any hesitation.

As the (36 year old) father of young kids, I found this movie almost as entertaining as the kids did. Sure, the storyline is thin and predicable, the plot maintains a happy-feel-good tone and most of the characters are a bit ""over the top"" (Sharpay and Ryan)--but who cares? This is a stage-musical-made-for-TV and not a movie--the title is a double entendre; this IS a high school musical ABOUT a high school musical.

The music, choreography and characters blend together extremely well and is as good as it gets. The scene during ""Status Quo"" is probably the best choreography I've seen of any show of recent times, not to mention the way it brings the movie together--Chad: ""What's up? Oh let's see, um you miss free period workout yesterday to audition for some heinous musical and now suddenly people are confessing. Yeah Zeke, Zeke is baking Creme Brulee.""

One of the best family-friendly films I've seen, and I expect this movie will stand the test of time. Highly recommended for tweens, teens and their families.",1152230400,3,1370,4.871244635193133

2549725,5,B000F2BNW2,"The thing about this musical is that it's awful. The first time I watched it, I found myself rolling my eyes constantly. The acting was mediocre for the most part, which is partly due to the bad script writing, the plot was nauseatingly cheesy, and the music was (mostly) fluffy Disney pop. I knew this going into the movie, but my friends told me that I just had to see it because my life would not be complete without seeing it. So, I was reluctant to enjoy it. I went in thinking ""I am 16 years old, watching a Disney Channel movie geared towards 12 year olds. I will not like this.""

And then I watched it.

I've seen the movie multiple times now and I find myself singing along and doing the dance to ""We're All In This Together"" at the end of the movie. I've even been caught by my friends (who tied me down and forced me to watch the movie in the first place) singing ""Bop to the Top"" when I think no one is looking. The tunes are very catchy, the coreography is ASTOUNDING, and I discovered Zac Efron :] The cast is beautiful and talented, and I am absolutely in love with this movie, no matter how much I hate to admit it. So, even if you're thinking that you probably won't like this movie because it's made for a slightly younger audience, trust me, you will.

As I said before, this musical is pretty much awful. But it's so amazing that all the bad parts seem to float away after only a few minutes :] Enjoy!!!",1152057600,3,1423,4.205128205128205

Then after exchanging numbers, fates played them again as Gabby disappeared leaving Troy impacted with her pressance.

School started giving both of them the delights as they realized they were in the same school and able to spend time together and get to know each other better. Much more better that their own cliques were beginning to dislike it.

The Evan's tried whatever to be chosen following lots of paranoias on their part when people were doing their own sneaky plans to break Troy and Gabby up for their own purposes.

Among most of DCOM's movies, this has been quite a movie for me. It was actually highlighted for a month or two before it was actually aired in my part of the world and it was a good wait. I love the chareography of the dances and great songs. The plots are actually good and relative to the real world.

Returning from vacation, Gabriella is starting at a new school.  She's hoping to shed her geeky girl image.  On her first day, she runs into Troy, who is the captain of the basketball team at her new school.  He's busy getting ready for the upcoming playoffs against their rival school.

In the back of their minds is the magic that happened when they sang together.  The sign ups for the school's winter musicale have been posted, and both of them are tempted to sign up.  Of course, that means Troy would have to face his friends, who think he should be focusing all of his time on basketball.  And Gabriella would have to deal with Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) who, along with her brother Ryan (Lucas Grabeel), is always the star of the school programs.  Is it worth the potential social upheaval to audition?

This Disney Channel Original Movie has been getting lots of buzz, and for a very good reason.  It had been on for about five minutes before I got a smile on my face, and the smile didn't leave until the movie was over.  The story is fairly predictable, but the movie is lots of fun and the songs are great.

Instead of doing traditional Broadway type songs, the music here is pop.  Of course, this works well with the intended audience of pre-teens and early teens.  They even work in a hip-hop song and a salsa song to spice things up a little.  About half the songs in this movie are auditions for the winter musicale, and they are very appropriate to the storyline.  This actually starts with the karaoke song that Troy and Gabriella sing at the beginning ""Start of Something New.""  For the climax, Sharpay and Ryan sing ""Bop to the Top"" which talks about getting to the top no matter what while our heroes sing ""Breaking Free,"" a song about their desire to break out of the molds they are in.

The actors do a great job with their roles.  Zac Efron and Vanessa Anne Hudgens are especially great as the leads.  There is a real chemistry between them that makes all their scenes so believable.  I was a little annoyed by the over the top acting of Ashley Tisdale as Sharpay and Alyson Reed as the drama teacher.  I know it was done on purpose, but I could have done with out it.  Over all, it was a minor complaint.

The DVD features two versions of the movie.  One is the regular film, but the other is the sing along edition that features the words to the songs at the bottom of the screen.  The other features are ok.  There are two music videos, a very brief behind the scenes featurette, and a ""Learn the Moves"" featurette that sort of teaches you a part of the dancing from ""Bop to the Top.""

While most of the bonus features aren't worth getting excited about, the movie itself is great fun.  I'm just sorry I rented it since now I'll have to spend more money to buy it.",1150588800,43,3062,4.402852049910874

Unfortunately, it is not.  As others have mentioned, they only showed some of the moves to ""Bop To The Top"". You would think they would at least have shown the big finale choreography.  And what they did show wasn't really anything much to learn from.

But this really is my only complaint and the only reason I don't give it 5 stars.  I'm rating the actual DVD here and not just the movie.  The movie itself is great; a cleaned-up modern ""Grease"".  Yes, it's campy and silly and you have to suspend reality a little but isn't that why we watch these anyway?!  (Oh, right... I mean isn't that why our KIDS watch these)?!

However, my daughter eagerly awaited the DVD knowing that there was a ""learning the moves"" portion of it.  BUT, Disney royally screwed up by putting Bop to the Top instead of the hit finale ""We're All In This Together"" for the dance moves section.  I would recorded the one from TV where they taught the dance moves to ""We'er All In This Together"" and saved my money on the DVD!!!!

2549743,5,B000F2BNW2,"Okay,I love this movie. It does in fact show conflict and people being mean. Like with what the academic club and basketball team do to Troy and Gabriella. And what Sharpay do to the day of the call-backs. (I'm not gonna go in to detail because I don't want to ruin it for anyone.) I enjoyed the ending and the We're All in This Together. I think it teaches kids that they shouldn't discriminate others because they are different. There isn't any inappropriate material because its DISNEY channel. It's mainly a channel for younger people. I think a lot of parents would be offended if they found a show with abusive characters or non-happy endings etc.

I loved the plot and I sing the songs all the time. They are very catchy.

The only reasons that I'd even consider knocking a star off for would be that Get Cha Head in the Game is the worst song ever, in my opinion. I also thought the acting started out a little shaky in the begining.

I thought the musical brought a new style to Disney and I enjoy watching the movie. I bought the DVD two days after it came out.

I would definitely suggest buying this movie or at the very least watching it.

The story's great, the actors are great, the songs are great, and overall the movie is great and I can't wait for a sequel.",1149638400,,1276,4.34453781512605
2549744,2,B000F2BNW2,"My seven-year old daughter has both this DVD and CD.  And she loves it.  She can't stop watching or listening to it.  It's pure pop entertainment schmaltz at its finest, which is all Disney seems to issue these days (the originality now falls on companies like Pixar, whose every release is better than the last).  When I hear the music from HSM, or when I walk into the living room and see Zac, Ryan, Cody (or whatever their wimpy nambly-pambly new age names are) prancing around, I want to eat a bullet for dinner.  The superficial story tries to make it seem like these characters come from school cliques that are ""worlds apart.""  Fact is, as presented here they're all fairly homogenous.  And it's not like Troy and Gabrielle are up against the odds--he's the big man high school basketball star and she's the newly arrived beautiful diva transfer student.  They're both well liked, and it's simply not plausible that anyone in their clique or otherwise would reject them for wanting to be in a musical.  The story would have been more compelling had the geek or some social outcast wanted to spread their theatrical wings.  Alas, no.  You get Ryan and his sister, Sharpei--yes, the dog breed, singing syrupy songs about nothing.  There's no conflict.  Nobody does anything wrong.  No one is mean or outwardly vicious, not even Troy's dad, who as high school basketball coach plays the ""heavy"" of the story.  No one is on drugs, no one is depressed, nobody's parent is an alcoholic, and none of the students have jobs after class.  Even the token fat girl is accepted by all.  The popular black boy and popular black girl appear to be an item, of course.  Nothing risque, or risky, about that.  In short, HSM is unreal, completely without controversy, and teaches young kids that we really are ""all in this together,"" when both you and I know the cold reality that cliques do not mingle in high school unless forced to do so, nobody crosses the jock quarterback, and the jocks certainly do not hang with the kids in stage crew, and nobody lives happily ever after, certainly not together.  Go get Grease.  Or better yet ""The Breakfast Club,"" which more accurately reflects high school students of a ""type"" and how tough it really is to get them to transcend those types.  Plus, the music is better (albeit dated).",1149638400,5,2318,4.685643564356436

2549748,2,B000F2BNW2,"Although the music and dance sequences were good, the rest of the movie was severely lacking.  True, the plotline is fairly simplistic, most DCOM movies are that way.  However, the acting leaves a lot to be desired.  Ashley Tisdale did a good job with her character, but because her character was written so over the top, she was not able to shine.  Vanessa Anne Hudgens seemed way too happy to land a part in the movie.  She's got a sweet face and looked the part of an All-American girl, but I didn't find her acting all that convincing.  The rest of the cast were okay, nothing impressive.  I loved the song ""Get Your Head in the Game.""  The dancing and the song were great.  I can't say the same thing with ""Stick to the Status Quo.""  Although the song and dance number was performed quite well, it was weak.  As another reviewer pointed out, ""no one"" does their homework in the caffeteria at lunch.  Since DCOM movies are geared toward 10-year-olds, I suppose this movie fits that target range (although some 10-year-olds may find it a bit lame), I find that many DCOM movies appeal to a much wider audience (especially the movie that Disney made about apartheid in South Africa.  Now, that's an awesome DCOM movie!).  I was surprised when I saw that Disney was offering the scripts for High Schools to use for their spring plays.  I don't think it'll appeal to high school audiences at all.  If you can forgive some of the wooden characters and over-the-top acting, then this movie could be quite fun.  If you can't, go watch ""Tiger Cruise,"" ""Double Teamed,"" ""Cow Belles,"" ""Cadet Kelly,"" or my favourite, ""Gotta Kick it Up.""",1149292800,2,1630,4.604166666666667

I actually assumed this was taken from a stageplay.  Where else do you see a basketball team (all male) break into a song on the Basketball court.  (Think Grease).

This movie makes us all think about the ""clique stereotypes"" we fall into, and how we need to think outside the ""Stereo-box.""  The songs were wonderful! Reminded me of the music you hear for Sitcoms of the 80's and 90's.  The kind of diddy's that stick in your head long after the show is over (I still have one of the songs going through my head, though I can't remember the name of the song.)  Yet the storyline has a positive message.

Sure the plot is a bit sloppy at times, and I kind of doubt that the school ""Play stars"" are the ""villians"" at many of today's high schools, but that may be what the movie makers were trying to show.  Even sportos and band kids can get along.  I also liked how ""parents"" to the most part, were left out of the storyline.  Sure the father was the highschool coach, but the silly drama teacher was funny, and likeable.

The main stars, the good looking basketball player, and the New female student ""brain"" were EXTREMELY likeable, and you wanted to see them succeed.

Great movie, for the entire family!

There were bits and pieces from all kinds of other books and plays.  The balcony scene REEKED of Romeo & Juliet, but without the nice words and metaphors.

The music wasn't bad, and the singing wasn't either.  Still, the dances were so awful that it took away from the effect.  I was surprised when I heard people at my school singing ""We're Flying"" in school because I thought that nobody would ever see that movie (I only watched it b/c I was bbsitting that night and she wanted to watch it).

This movie isn't for anyone who isn't already in High School.  like most awful Disney productions, it is so stereotypical that I think many kids would be afraid of high school.  The nasty teacheris WAY too overdone.  If anyone can show me that kind of teacher in a public school I'll immediately write a letter to the principle.  The ""Status Quo"" song was the worst stereotype of all.  The fat, smart kids sitting at a lunch table doing homework together and not dancing is NOT TRUE!!!

Zac Efron is the lead role guy in ""High School Musical"" and is a good young actor, he has been in more movies than you probably think and has been pretty good in all of them, other than that the other actors are pretty uneducated but still pull it off.

I ddosnt watch the Disney Channel anymore but I do remember some of the older ones and those compared to this are just not a the same level. My sister wanted me to watch this and I said ""NO"" but after my stepmom (The really hard movie critic of the family) said it was good I decided to go ahead and give it a chance,... and I am glad I did

The music in this film was actually quite good and catchy I am really REALLY not a fan of pop music but the music in this did not bother me too much, all of the songs are decent if not better...

I would recommend this movie to just about everybody of all ages, but do keep in mind that it is not a GREAT movie

Anyway, this is a really good movie. I kind of wanted to see it (when it first premiered on Disney Channel) just to make fun of it being cheesy. But it turned out the other way; it's really very good!

Zac and Vanessa are very well-cast in the lead roles (especially for being relative unknowns), and it made me laugh seeing Ashley Tisdale (from The Suite Life) as the school's diva-in-residence. She's good and she knows it. Her brother was hysterical.

But this film is more than just for the younger kids. It has really realistic themes; the school cliques, the ""you do this, they do that"" attitude (my friends laughed when I first said I wanted to be on Broadway, but now they encourage me about it), and of course, the high school romance. Gotta love cliches every once in a while.

The music is catchy, the dance moves are cool (especially Troy's footwork in ""Breaking Free""), and all the actors show that they're doing what teenagers do best: having fun!",1145491200,,1136,4.553921568627451

2549808,5,B000F2BNW2,"I've heard alot of things about this movie, fortunately all of them after I saw it. I went in with no bias whatsoever, I'm not a musical person, there are very few I like. It feels like people will judge a movie too quickly, especially if it's marketed a certain way, or if the plot isn't a hard hitting sundance film festival winner. Just because this is a tv movie doesn't mean you can't like it, tv movie isn't a stigma for 'this movie will suck so badly it hurts'. On the contrary, this movie is one of the shinning stars of tv movies and Disney should be proud for finally succeding.

 One plus with this movie is that it's clean, I didn't have to wince, I know swearing and sex happens all the time, but isn't it overused to the extent of 'ahhhh!!! make it stop!!!', I've gotten to the point where I either tune it out or turn it off. For me this movie, is like sugar, it's crack, it's bouncy, it's clean fun, all those add up to enjoyable for me. The characters are strongly put together, while slightly cliched they charm you, the plot while thin tugs at your heart. I can relate to Troy and Gabriella, I may be 17 and this is targeted at me, but isn't that okay? They deal with the things I deal with, pressure, seperation, pain, and all because of friends who they trust. Both characters, Gabriella; strong but not rock hard nor the perfect girl, Troy; Confused, unsure, but confident. This isn't just a fairy tale romance either, but ups and downs, no storybook kisses, just closeness and honesty.

 The music itself is extremely catchy and well worth watching just to listen to it, the sounds and songs amuse me and they are enjoyable not painful (like most musicals I've seen lately, famous or otherwise). You can be forty or sixty, thirteen or five and you'll still enjoy this, it's made for nearly everyone, it's guilty pleasure if you don't want to admit you like it. :) Seriously, watch this movie",1144972800,14,1914,4.4289772727272725

Kids of all ages will love this movie; it has everything!  I love that there are going to be not one, but TWO versions of the movie on the DVD.  There will be the movie we saw on Disney and the Sing Along version as well.  I cannot believe all of the special features that are going to be on the DVD as well.

Zac Efron is SUPERB as basketball supter-star Troy Bolton.  He is a great actor and has a great voice as well.  Vanessa Anne Hudgens, who portrays Gabriella Montez, the ""freaky math girl"" as she puts it in the movie has a gorgeous voice!  Ashley Tisdale (Maddie from The Suite Life of Zack and Cody) plays the villain Sharpay Evans so well.  In real life, Ashley is anything but evil, but it does not show in the movie.  Her voice is great as is her acting.  Lucas Grabeel portrays Sharpay's twin brother Ryan Evans, the guy who brings a lot of the comedy to the movie.  Corbin Bleu (Chad Danforth) and Monique Colman (Taylor McKessie) also co-star in this movie as the friends of the main characters.

I will admit that I am much older than many of the people who watched the movie; I'm almost 25, but this movie connects to anyone!  The message in the movie is to be yourself and make it known!  Don't be afraid of what other people think.  Just do what YOU want to do.  I love that message because it really gives kids and adults even, hope.

But who really cares?? It may not be some great mind teaser of a story but it has all the qualities I love. Music, Fun, Wholesome and Romance.

A lot of the interviews have made such comments as ""If you've got a kid in the house you've probably heard of High School Musical."" There are no kids in my house and I LOVE this movie. Funny thing was, I had no desire to see it when I saw a trailer for it back in November. In fact, I so did NOT want to see it. I thought it was just another way for Disney to feature some new singer I'd never heard of that they were supporting. Then the weeks went by and I didn't hear much more about it, as I don't watch Disney Channel much. Then one night (Jan. 20th to be exact) I was lounging at home and saw another preview. I thought, ""What the heck. I'll give it a whirl."" I've been addicted ever since. Pathetically so. I've seen it too many times to count (but it's way more than six). I bought the soundtrack as soon as it was available again (having previously sold out) and I listen to it all the time. And usually by this point the music would have gotten old for me but not with HSM. My family and friends know it as my latest obsession and probably know more stats (ratings, cd sales, etc.) than they ever cared for.

I love the movie. I love the music. I'm counting the days until the DVD comes out AND the release of the second movie (which sadly isn't going to be until early next year). If you haven't seen it, DO! Turn on Disney Channel, borrow a copy from a friend. Anything! Show your support! We need more fun clean shows like this.

2549824,5,B000F2BNW2,"I cannot believe a Disney Channel Movie has been so incredibly successful!

I'm a senior in college and so it must seem strange that I've even seen this movie.  But let me tell you, people of EVERY age will really enjoy this movie!  I've become so obsessed with the music in this movie!  I am usually pretty elitist when it comes to the music I like--I am graduating with a degree a music theory, and so I have REALLY high standards when it comes to music composition.  But the music FAR EXCEEDS my standards--there is something about it that lifts you up, inspires you, and makes you feel a connection with the characters in the movie.

Indeed, the movie is the biggest success of the year!  Don't believe me?  Check this out:

After 10 weeks in stores, the soundtrack has just been certified platinum and just hit the number 1 spot on the billboard 200--for the 2nd time! The soundtrack has been number 1 on the Digital Albums Charts, has been in the Top 3 for the past 4 weeks, and has been in the Top 10 for the past 6 weeks.  It has also been the number 1 album purchased on iTunes, the number 1 album purchased on amazon.com, the number 1 most downloaded song on iTunes, and the number 1 most requested song on Radio Disney every day.

This movie has become SO popular that Disney is planning to make TWO sequels and start a tour with the cast.  Once again, I cannot believe how a Disney Channel movie could be so successful.

Again, this is an excellent movie because of the excellent music!  The cast is VERY talented in their singing abilities, especially Vanessa Anne Hudgens.  Some of the best songs are ""Start of Something New"", ""Stick to the Status Quo,"" ""When There Was Me and You,"" and ""Breaking Free.""

DEFINITELY watch this movie!  It's uplifting, it's inspiring, and it's just musically wonderful.  I have literally seen this movie over 40 times...it never gets old!  I HIGHLY recommend it!

...Now if you'll excuse me, I am going to go watch it again.",1143936000,6,1970,4.495774647887324

I am 44 year old Mom who has truly enjoyed this movie each time I watched it and I plan to watch again and again.  I wasn't suprised that it is now my 15 year old daughters favorite movie and The sound track her favorite CD.  I was surprised that my 13 year old son who so enjoyed making fun of the commercials and tormenting his sister over her growing excitement as she awaited the premier.  Imagine my suprise when I realized after the first 5 minutes my son was completely engrossed and won over.  The real proof that this movie can appeal to most anyone is during the second showing I realized my 45 year old husband was quietly watching from the kitchen desperately trying to appear he wasn't watching a kids movie, especially not a musical one.  It took about 20 minutes for him to join us on the sofa to supposedly read his paper, 5 minutes later he dropped all pretense of other activity and started asking questions about the characters and trying to sing along much to our kids horror.  People give this movie a chance you won't regret it.  If it can grab my 2 cavemen and win them over into multiple viewings veiwers, then it might become one of your favorites too.",1143849600,2,1250,4.380952380952381

I've taped the show and have had Korokee parties with my kids along with my friends kids.  I'm still going to buy the DVD when it comes out, I'm so crazy about this movie.  It brings back memories when we all went crazy over a similar movie, GREASE, when we were young.

when I first saw the commercials, I knew that this movie was going to be an ""extreme"" hit and could not believe our luck that we didn't have to go to the theaters to see it.  I was counting the days until premiere day.  The dancing, the singing, the music, the storylines, the total package was such a joy to watch.

I find this the most fun and refreshing thing I've seen in a long time, and probably for the very reasons ""serious"" critics find it silly or pedestrian: the movie embraces its cliches and campiness wholeheartedly and makes me laugh aloud each time I watch it (and I've watched it more times than I care to admit) and the songs are hummable and singable and delightful.  I've listened to the soundtrack at least once a day since I got it from amazon, usually on my way to work because the songs put me in a good mood.  I mean, who doesn't want to do one of those cool dance moves in the car when ""Stick to the Status Quo"" or ""We're All in This Together"" comes on?  I do refrain.

2549835,4,B000F2BNW2,"While on vacation, Troy and Gabriella find friendship, and a musical talent they never knew existed.  But when Gabriella coincidentally starts going to Troy's school, where everyone follows social labels to the fine print, the brainy girl and super-jock are finding themselves in a mess.  Could one musical bring them, and their school, together?

""High School Musical"" was good...for a Disney Channel Original Movie.  I give it four stars because it was fun and it held my interest, but looking back on it I'm sure it would mostly only appeal to pre-teen girls.

First of all, there were a lot of unbelievable parts in the movie.  The school was too luxurious, Troy and Gabriella's first time singing together was way too comfortable, and it was obvious that they were lip-synching to the songs, the music sounded just as it would if you were listening to it on the soundtrack.  Not to mention that seeing atheltic boys in basketball jerseys dancing can be a bit odd to watch.  The songs were corny but catchy.  The characters could be random at times but were likeable.  They never showed the actual musical, which was a bit of a dissapointment...but really the cons should end here.  It's a Disney Channel Original Movie, not a high-quality musical that took years to film.  It's fun, funny, a bit typical and predictable, but enjoyable.  It's a hit with younger girls, and that's no surprise: Zac Efron and Vanessa Anne Hutchinson are most girls' dream main boy character and main girl character, and the dance steps are so (surprisingly until I figured out the reason) easy that girls can learn them and dance along to the music.  I recommend this movie to all girls; some teen girls may even enjoy it.  There was no questionable content unless you include the teeny bit of femininity that the boys were forced to throw in when dancing.",1143417600,3,1841,4.781645569620253

On the premiere of this movie i stayed home and counted down to the start, but even with expectations already high, this movie blew me away. Im not usually a musical fan, but this one was so well made that it wasn't  even cheesy, just cute. And i can honestly say that most people turned it on for the super hot zac efron, but stayed for the amazing dancing and songs. The actors have amazing voices, and they made this movie perfect for all ages. It had just the right amount of singing, dancing, acting, and romance.

2549842,5,B000F2BNW2,"This film should have been a major theatrical release. The music is that good, and the performances by the young but highly talented cast are uniformly superb, led by the amazing Ashley Tisdale. From Les Miserables to High School Musical by age 20, she is a Broadway prodigy in a class by herself.

As a composer/librettist of Broadway musicals myself (""Marva!"", a musical play about famed inner-city educator Marva Collins), I can appreciate the extraordinary combination of effort it required to make High School Musical into the splendid production it is. All of the songs are first-rate, but ""We're All In This Together,"" ""Stick to the Status Quo,"" and ""Get 'Cha Head In The Game"" are particular standouts. You'll find yourself singing them endlessly.

There are good reasons why the musical recording of this film is the first television soundtrack album to top the Albums Chart in twenty years. Those reasons are the songs. They are uniformly melodic, intelligent, and professional--rare qualities in today's music scene. I cannot recall any other album that actually made me wish that many of the tunes had been of longer duration! Several of the excellent numbers on High School Musical are only 2 minutes long or less, yet pack an enormous amount of heart and quality into every one of those few seconds. What a contrast to most recordings, where a bare minimum of musical and lyrical ideas are stretched, prolonged with preludes, repeated, and repeated again to make up for the almost total absence of substance!

The ""Stick to the Status Quo"" song warrants special mention because it brilliantly captures the reality of high school peer pressure within the context of an engaging large-cast production dance number. Who has experienced high school without feeling the stifling impetus to remain within rigidly defined boundaries of behavior, dress, and attitude? This song illustrates the foolishness of such self-imposed censorship without preaching, and is all the more a triumph because of that subtlety. If an athlete can bake, and a scholar can be into hip-hop, maybe there's hope for all of us.

It would be inaccurate to pigeon-hole this as a ""message movie,"" notwithstanding the worthy subtext of tolerance, individuality, and inclusion.  This film does not overemphasize or exaggerate its theme.  Rather, it is seamlessly woven into the overall fabric of the entertainment.  In the same way, racial and gender equality and diversity are not spotlighted as obvious morals, like they might have been in a lesser work.  Instead, these principles are taken for granted as givens in the lives of these young people, who never would think to question whether it is appropriate for people of different races to date, or whether females can be the most accomplished scientists and mathematicians around.  The film is much more effective in conveying these noble messages because of the subtlety with which it handles them as part of the unquestioned structure of modern life.

The musical-within-a-musical approach works well, too, because it makes room for a wide range of song styles, including a parody of the old Donnie & Marie Osmond song and dance shtick and a hot salsa number, ""Bop to the Top,"" which is catchier than virtually any hit single within recent memory. These infectious yet funny numbers are nicely interspersed with the songs that are part of the main story as sung extemporaneously by the characters. And the wonderful high-energy choreography by the great Kenny Ortega is breathtaking, particularly in group-dance songs such as ""Get 'Cha Head in the Game"" and ""Stick to the Status Quo.""

My daughter and I watched this movie without fail, every time it was broadcast on the Disney Channel.  As a result, I can testify from personal experience that it holds up well under repeated viewing, and I do mean repeated.  Because of the wonderful combination of song, dance, romance, humor, and inspiration this motion picture always seems fresh, even after many viewings.  I believe ""High School Musical"" will transform popular culture in a highly positive direction, moving a new generation of young people toward a much broader appetite for music, dance, and drama.  It will preserve the genre of melodic book musical for many years, at a point when its future appeared precarious at best.  No one could have predicted this impact in advance, but now it seems clear.  What a contribution!

Bravo!",1143244800,13,4426,5.0897790055248615
