8508969,1,B000CPJH2U,I usually trust that the products Amazon sells are going to be of good quality.  This dvd was a big disappointment.  The camera work is awful and the video itself not cohesive at all.  I wish I had not wasted my money on this!,1267488000,,226,4.090909090909091
8508970,5,B000CPJH2U,"I have seen very much modern dance over the last few years.

Last week I saw Zumanity in Las Vegas Nevada playing at the Treasure Island playhouse, and then ordered this DVD.

After seeing this DVD I will start collecting dance DVD and videos.

Where I live it is hard to find live performances ( Pennsylvania )
