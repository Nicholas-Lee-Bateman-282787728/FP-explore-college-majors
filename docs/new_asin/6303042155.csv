7834918,5,6303042155,"The best Canada gave the world, although my favorite Adams song is ""Back To You"" from 1997, this tape made me rewind all those years when music videos were the talk of the town, I recommend these live and video clips, Highly recommend for Bryan's fans.",1441152000,,252,4.5
7834919,5,6303042155,I think this is one of the best set of concerts of Bryan Adams out there. I burned it to a DVD since there isn't a DVD of this particular series of songs. This is like a greatest hits concert series. Absolutely wonderful.,1285027200,,221,4.162790697674419
