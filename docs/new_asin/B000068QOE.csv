1726022,5,B000068QOE,"This is fantastic series.  I love it!  Interesting characters and the British do a great job with mysteries.  David Suchet does Poirot so well you can't imagine anyone else doing it (like Jeremy Brett is the only one who can play Sherlock Holmes for me).  I hope production companies will do more series like along these lines (Poirot, Marple, Holmes, Nero Wolfe, etc.).",1137024000,7,370,4.825396825396825
1726023,1,B000068QOE,"Thanks for the heads up,Ixion28, on the A&E version of the series.  I have only seen the Poirot series on A&E, and I like it enough to purchase the DVD sets.  However, I was disappointed to find out that A&E cut out minutes for ads.  I am checking into the AcornMedia version.",1105920000,33,276,4.269230769230769
1726024,5,B000068QOE,"NOTE:  I thought we could only do ONE review.  Seems like the same person was able to repeat his review many times.  REVIEW:  Hey I'm not complaining since every DVD I own has commercials.  I have all of the Poirot series on tape with few exceptions and I now have the DVD thanks to the availability of this set.  Each one is a gem, beautifully filmed with great actors, perfect costumes and quality sets.  If this were done in the U.S. you'd see Poirot drinking a Coke we're so jaded.  Not so with the UK productions.  I love them!",1104969600,8,532,4.292929292929293
1726025,2,B000068QOE,"I am a great fan of the novels of Agatha Christie and have collected every one of them. I also enjoyed very much the movies from the 70's and early 80's featuring Albert Finney and Peter Ustinov. Which may result in my disappointment with this collection of DVD's featuring David Suchet.
There is great television being made today and I found these adaptations less than great. I felt the acting in most of them bland and uninteresting to down right bad. The thing I love about the novels is the clear build of tension towards the unmasking of the killer or killers. In these teleplays I thought the tension was lacking so there was no great pay off at the end which is the main satisfaction of reading the novels. In other words the directing too, was bland. I felt also that the scripts were confusing and not so neatly thought through as Dame Agatha's novels. If you have seen the movies 'Murder on the Orient Express' 'Death on the Nile' 'Evil under the Sun' then you will get an idea of great payoffs and all lose ends neatly tied up at the end which is the point of all Agatha Christie murder mysteries. I feel Peter Ustinov and Albert Finney came closer to capturing the essense of Hercule Poirot than David Suchet has. These movie length teleplays did nothing to satisfy this Agatha Christie fan because of their lack of tension, blandness and mediocre adaptations to the small screen.",1079654400,19,1393,4.576
1726026,1,B000068QOE,I recommend that you stay away from this set.  American green eye shades from A&E's advertizing department cut ten-twelve minutes from each episode so that they could squeeze more fast food ads in to the showings on television.  The resulting botch makes several of these episodes unwatchable.  Sorry; hopefully Acorn will put these out in pristine form.,1075680000,156,354,5.175438596491228
1726027,4,B000068QOE,"David Suchet as Poirot is always a delight to watch, and I would love to recommend this DVD collection... but there is one major problem, at least as far as I am concerned. These versions were issued in the US and, I suspect, because of the ruthless hacking to accommodate commercials, these stories are each about 10 minutes shorter than the original U.K. versions. This is particularly damaging to Evil Under The Sun: In the edited-down version, characters inexplicably crop up and disappear and threads are left hanging. There is also a tendency to edit out scenes which are intended to exploit Poirot's little eccentricities which make the character so appealing. In the full version it all makes sense, with events unfolding as the director intended, rather than according to the dictates of the hacks who subsequently cannibalized it! If this irritates you even half as much as it assuredly does me, you might want to consider getting a region-free DVD player or a multi-format VCR (because this doesn't only happen with Poirot, but ALL films which cross the Atlantic), and then ordering British-made movies from amazon.co.uk, or any other reputable British supplier - it will be well worth the trouble.",1073520000,26,1209,5.019900497512438
1726028,5,B000068QOE,"I love this series. The production is fantastic - places, dresses, etc - and the actor is what I think of Poirot. After Albert Finney (Murder on the Orient Express) Suchet is  definitive , Like Agatha describes him, and not that big, large, and fat Peter Ustinov ( nothing against this great and fabulous actor, But Poirot is another matter....)",1405728000,,345,4.75
1726029,5,B000068QOE,"I love Poirot!  The Box set condition I received was tattered & old but the cd's were in good shape...
Still, a good rating to me!",1398124800,,130,4.0
1726030,5,B000068QOE,"I was so happy to add this to my Poirot collection!  Despite all the renaming and repackaging that has been going on with these DVD's that confuse the buying public, I am determined to own all the Suchet Poirot programs.  I am now 3 programs closer to that goal.  Watching them never grows old!",1395792000,,294,4.407407407407407
1726031,5,B000068QOE,"To me David Suchet is the ultimate Poirot.  These movies have been done excellently.  If Mrs.
Christie were still here she'd love them.",1381795200,,135,4.826086956521739
1726032,5,B000068QOE,Especially when David Suchet plays Hercule Poirot!  I believe I have every movie and all of the tv series.  Love it and never tire of watching them.  So well done and we love the atmosphere!,1354838400,,190,4.371428571428571
1726033,5,B000068QOE,"as usual arrived in good shape in a timely manner.
Still needs close captioning. I had to turn it up very loud to understand it.",1322524800,,128,4.16
1726034,4,B000068QOE,"In 2000, ITV's classic series ""Agatha Christie's Poirot"" resumed after a four-year hiatus. In this time, the indomitable Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot (David Suchet) seems to have aged not a bit, though he retired to the county to tend a vegetable garden, of all things. Poirot's old friend Capt. Arthur Hastings (Hugh Fraser) has gotten married, greyed a bit, and suffered some financial misfortunes in South America. Miss Lemon (Pauline Moran) has become a brunette -though mercifully only for one episode. And Poirot's apartment in Whitehaven Mansions has changed a bit, as he moved out for a while. The show's creators have not endeavored to make big changes as they would in later years, but rather to recapture the series' charm of the 1990s.

""Poirot: The Complete Collection"" includes the episodes from Series 7 and 8, which amount to four feature-length films that aired on ITV from 2000-2002. They are not of uniform quality, but they are all perfectly entertaining. David Suchet is still in very good form as Poirot. ""Lord Edgware Dies"" features one of Christie's most convoluted and diabolical plots, and ""Murder in Mesopotamia"" takes place under the British mandate, where Poirot must battle sand and a perplexing case of murder in the desert. I think those are the best of the collection. These DVDs are from A&E, whereas earlier series were from Acorn. The bonus features have, if anything, gotten worse. There are brief text bios of Agatha Christie, David Suchet, and Hercule Poirot on the discs. Still no subtitles. The episodes are:

""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"" may have been selected to re-introduce the series, because it brings Hercule Poirot (David Suchet) out of retirement. For reasons unexplained, the Belgian detective has quit London for the village of King's Abbott, where he is perfecting his vegetable garden. But Poirot cannot escape man's criminal nature. He becomes concerned about his friend Roger Ackroyd (Malcolm Terris), who owns a large chemical company, after Ackroyd's paramour Mrs. Dorothy Farrars (Rosalind Bailey) dies of apparent suicide. Ackroyd had learned that someone was blackmailing Dorothy over the suspicious death of her late husband. He intends to find the culprit, but the culprit finds him first.

""Lord Edgware Dies"" finds Poirot back in London and hard at work after a brief retirement. Capt. Arthur Hastings (Hugh Fraser), who has married and returned to London from Argentina, joins his old friend in sleuthing once again. The pair meet the comely actress Jane Wilkensen (Helen Grace) at a performance by American impersonator Carlotta Adams (Fiona Allen). Jane asks Poirot to convince her husband, the abrasive Lord Edgware (John Castle), to grant her a divorce. But while Poirot, Hastings, Miss Lemon (Pauline Moran), and Chief Inspector Japp (Philip Jackson) have a reunion dinner, and Jane Wilkensen dines with friends, someone who looks a lot like Jane stabs Lord Edgware to death in his study.

At the advice of his doctor, Poirot travels to the Sandy Cove Hotel, just off England's coast, for two weeks of dieting, exercise, and sea air in ""Evil Under the Sun"". He is accompanied by Capt. Hastings (Hugh Fraser). Poirot immediately senses danger when he observes a pretty actress, Arlena Stuart (Louise Delamere), cavorting with her old friend Patrick Redfern (Michael Higgs) in front of their respective spouses. Arlena is widely hated on the island, seemingly by everyone who knows her, including an acquaintance of Poirot's, Mrs. Darnley (Marsha Fitzalan). So it is no surprise when Arlena is discovered dead on the beach.

""Murder in Mesopotamia"" takes place in Iraq, then a British mandate. Hercule Poirot (David Suchet) has traveled to Baghdad to help an old friend, who turns out to have flown the coop. So he and Capt. Hastings (Hugh Fraser) visit Hastings' nephew Bill Coleman (Jeremy Turner-Welch) on an archeological dig. Dr. Eric Leidner (Ron Berglas) is in charge of the dig, aided by his assistant Anne Johnson (Dinah Stabb) and epigrapher Pre Levigny (Christopher Hunter). But someone is trying to frighten his wife Louise Leidner (Barbara Barnes). Then Louise is found dead in her room, which no one else apparently entered or left. And artifacts keep disappearing.",1315008000,,4250,5.16255442670537
1726035,5,B000068QOE,"Agatha Christie has done it again!  A&E's spectacular version of the Belgian detective, Poirot, is amazing.  They depict him exactly as he should be.  They do not sport with your intelligence, either.  Visual clues are present, but the viewer is not knocked over the head with them.  And the actors are genuine, if maybe having a bit too much actor's make up.  ; )  I love them all!",1261958400,,382,4.529411764705882
1726036,5,B000068QOE,"I absolutely love David Suchet as Poirot and this set completes my collection of his work as the witty and urbane detective.  If you appreciate great acting, wonderful dialogue, and period details, you would find this series to be very entertaining.  A ""must-have.""",1239926400,,265,5.1395348837209305
1726037,5,B000068QOE,"David Suchet is the perfect Poirot.  Love the longer viewing time of these, even though they can be choppy, as noted by other reviewers.  Still, it's Poirot and well done:  costumes, locations, acting, etc.  I admit I prefer the Poirot 'episodes/movies' with Japp, Miss Lemon, and Captain Hastings.  However, anything Poirot is good fun, especially watching to see how he thinks through and then resolves his various situations:  the words he chooses, the timing, the delivery.  Enjoy!",1237939200,2,485,5.220779220779221
1726038,5,B000068QOE,"I give this five stars because of the excellence of the original production. The phrase ""lovingly crafted"" certainly applies to the Suchet version of Poirot. The supporting cast is outstanding. The only negatives regarding the DVD version are the lack of extras and the sometimes muddled captioning, obviously written by someone not familiar with British terminology from the thirties. For example, the actor may say ""five shillings, thrupence,"" while the captioning will read ""five shillings, crumpance,"" a crude guess indicating not much effort in getting it right.",1224028800,3,567,5.528735632183908
1726039,4,B000068QOE,"Most people seem to agree that David Suchet
is fabulous as Hercule Poirot. He is indeed.
Including the humorous side to this detective.
You will see some of the humor as well as the more
serious side of Poirot. I only wish that some of the
producers had decided to expand on Christie. Namely,
Cat Among the Pigeons and The Third Girl. Christie wrote a lot
of books and there are many fine actors to choose from.
I enjoyed all of these mysteries.",1221436800,2,445,4.373493975903615

In fact Wonderful the fact that here saved the humor and given to the special English atmosphere. Most of all I liked two series of this collection. This ""Lord Edgeware Dies"" and ""Evil Under the Sun"". But of course unconditional admiration causes is the performer of the role of Poirot, British actor David Suchet. He is a true professional who was able to show a unique Belgian detective. Poirot turned out the way it was conceived by Dame Agatha Christie. At first, it seems to us that Poirot is a pompous dandy who brags about his ""grey cells"". But this is an illusion, because really, Poirot is always important to restore justice and punish the offender. Thank you very much!",1433116800,,768,4.7388059701492535
