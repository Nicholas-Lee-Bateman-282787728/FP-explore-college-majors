Matched all the way by Laurence Harvey, alternately  cruel and callous and then warm and tender.  Their scenes together ring  true and are timeless depictions of deep emotional and sexual intimacy.  The other themes of the film, class distinctions etc. are still valid...but  it will be Simone, touching the heart of this callow young man and making  him better for it, feeling their age difference yet unable to stop herself  from loving and hoping for happiness against her own experience, that will  haunt you.

1256426,5,B00002VW6M,"English director Jack Clayton is well known for his 1961 adaptation of Henry James 's The Turn of the Screw, baptized THE INNOCENTS, with Deborah Kerr. Two years before, he had directed A ROOM AT THE TOP, a movie which received numerous international awards. Forty years later, this movie hits  the DVD market hoping for a second career. Does it worth it ? Without  doubt, YES !
Shot in black & white, partly in studio, partly in an  industrial town of England, A ROOM AT THE TOP is a drama involving a  middle-class employee played by Laurence Harvey trying to obtain "" a  place in the sun "" by seducing the only daughter of the richest man  around. Unfortunately, he also falls in love with Simone Signoret, the 40  years old wife of a member of the local bourgeoisie.
Apart of the study  of the subtle mechanisms that ruled (rules ?) english social classes, A  ROOM AT THE TOP gives us the opportunity to admire Simone Signoret, in her  glory, an actress who, with the italian performer Anna Magnani and Bette  Davis, is one of the best actresses ever.
Too bad that the DVD is not at  the level of the movie.

1256427,5,B00002VW6M,"An extraordinary film, one that retains its full impact to this day.  The story is fairly simple ---- man loves a woman, but loves and covets even more the money and power that another woman can provide.  This British film  is atmospheric and very vivid, aided greatly by the black and white  filming, which adds a starkness and a reality that is almost painful.  Laurence Harvey was a very skilled actor whose tragic early death in the  early 1970's choked off a brilliant career.  Simone Signoret, one of the  greatest actresses since the end of World War II, won a much-deserved  Academy Award as best actress of 1959 for her work in this film (she also  died at an age where more great work would have been forthcoming).  This is  not a film to make you feel good, but one that has still has a lot of truth  and empathy to it.  Highly recommended.",944265600,12,851,4.441558441558442

1256436,4,B00002VW6M,"Jack Clayton's remarkable 1958 film changed British cinema, and brought a new understanding of the role of sex in postwar society. Set in the years after the war, the film is primarily about the changes in the class system wrought by the Second World War and the new Atlee government: the working-class hero of the film, Joe Lampton, released from a POW camp at the war's end, works in an accounting firm and dreams of making good by marrying the pretty daughter (Heather Sears) of the richest manufacturer in town. His sounding board for his ambitions, a married older Frenchwoman Simone Signoret) living in his Yorkshire town, progresses from being the erotic outlet for his frustrations to being the genuine object of his true love once he realizes the insipidity of the millionaire's daughter, but he is unable to make good on his promises to his sentimental educator and opts instead for the easy life when he gets the younger woman pregnant.

The story of this ambitious handsome boy making good, as Pauline Kael has pointed out, is an old one, common to novelists as diverse as Stendhal and Theodore Dreiser. What makes it special here is the splendid acting of Harvey and Signoret, the tactful direction of Clayton, and the genuinely stunning cinematography of Clayton's frequent partner Freddie Francis. The film treats its story maturely and freshly, and the lovemaking and squabbling scenes between Harvey (here much more virile and less pinched than usual) and Signoret (as dreamy and carnal as ever) seem as sophisticated as anything else from the period. The film suffers only at the end when nemesis comes to dog Harvey's Joe for his selfishness and the realistic tone of the first three-quarters of the film becomes compromised by the overapplication of dramatic irony. But it's still one of the best films dealing with that tremendously sociologically rich period in Britain after the Second World War.",1185408000,,1919,4.996875
1256437,5,B00002VW6M,"Based on John Braine's cynical novel, one of the first ""angry young man"" tales, Clayton's brilliant social drama is distinguished by sharp, biting dialogue and sexually explicit language unusual for its time. It's also a lacerating critique of the British class system that's lost none of its punch. Laurence Harvey's Joe makes a credible central character, but it's Signoret who holds your attention, and breaks your heart, as Alice.

Simone Signoret is tremendous as the elderly desperate woman who asks in the key scene of the play, ""What do I have but your love?""

1256439,5,B00002VW6M,"Laurence Harvey plays an ex-POW from a working-class background in northern England who lands a low-paying job in a government accounting firm, but who has big eyes for the top (financially and socially) - especially if he can marry into it. He begins wooing the daughter of the city's biggest tycoon; she's a vacuous snow queen (played so-so by Heather Sears), and he has little success with her at first. At the same time he falls in love with an older, experienced woman, played superbly by Simone Signoret (she deservedly won an Oscar for her portrayal). But money blinds him to his real feelings, and when Sears agrees to marry him (after she becomes pregnant), he throws over Signoret and ties the knot with Sears. Signoret commits suicide, and Harvey is left with Sears and her money, but little else (certainly not the love he felt with Signoret).

1256443,5,B00002VW6M,"Throughout the 1950s, a group of young British writers were referred to as ""angry young men"" because, in their novels and plays, they excoriated what they perceived to be the dominant materialistic values of their society following World War Two. They included playwrights John Osborne and Kingsley Amis and novelists John Braine, John Wain, and Alan Silitoe. This film is based on Braine's novel Room at the Top; Neil Patterson received an Academy Away for best adapted screenplay. Joe Lampton (Laurence Harvey) is the focal point. Driven by smoldering ambition to overcome his modest circumstances and deeply resentful of the wealthiest man in a North Country village (Brown, played by Donald Wolfit), he finally obtains a position in Brown's company and begins his difficult journey to ""the top"" while including marriage to Brown's daughter Susan (Heather Sears) among his ultimate objectives. Along the way, he meets an older but still attractive Frenchwoman, Alice Aisgill (Simone Signoret) with whom he has an affair. For Joe, it is a mere dalliance along his career path; she, however, falls in love with him. Beyond the passionate sex which she enjoys as much as he does, Alice also helps Joe to refine his social graces and increase his understanding and appreciation of the cultural arts. (Signoret received an Academy Award as best actress for her performance in this film.) Joe seems grateful for her contributions to his self-improvement but really has no long-term interest in her. He remains obsessed with reaching ""the top"" with wife Susan at his side, possessing great wealth, power, and prestige.
And then he learns from Susan that....
Alice is the most sympathetic character in the film, largely because Joe exploits her so callously. As for Brown, ""what you see is what you get"": a class-conscious, hard-driving, no-nonsense capitalist. Unlike Joe, no need for dissembling. Brown is at ""the top"" and (by God) he intends to remain there. Susan is of great importance to Joe (and to her father, of course) but is of little importance to the film's story line except as one of the ambitious goals which motivate Joe. He really cares little for her as a person, one way or the other. Were she in his own social class, Joe would probably have little to do with her...except, perhaps, for occasional sexual gratification (for himself). At least Alice offered more than sex...she offered unconditional love. Only at the end of the film does Joe begin to realize what he has gained by reaching ""the top"" and at what a cost. Both in the novel and in this film, Joe symbolizes just about everything which enraged Braine and other British writers.
Years later, in a brief excerpt from ""The Paradox of Our Time,"" George Carlin observes that ""We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often. We've learned how to make a living, but not a life; we've added years to life, not life to years."" He could well be describing Joe Lampton and countless others who seem to know the cost of everything but the value of nothing, who (in Socrates' words) live unexamined lives, in Thoreau's words ""lives of quiet desperation.""
Those who share my admiration of this film are urged to check out A Place in the Sun (1951), Look Back in Anger (1958), Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1961), and A Taste of Honey (also 1951).",1064534400,45,3383,4.9057591623036645
1256444,5,B00002VW6M,"This was the era of John Osborne and Britain's ""Angry Young Man"" whose influence was becoming so widespread in the post-Suez period.  Laurence Harvey gives a masterful performance as an opportunistic young man who, on the surface, has apparently succeeded, but yet, if this is so, why does he have a funereal look on his face as he is being transported from the church sitting next to beautiful Heather Sears, his new bride and daughter of the wealthiest man in town?
The answer to that question lies in the woman who took her life, and was Harvey's true love, Simone Signoret, who delivered one of the most captivating performances of the post-World War Two period in achieving a notably deserved ""Best Actress"" Oscar.  When Harvey arrives in the small English factory town he resents the lowly position he has, seeking to graduate to the world of wealth.  The restrictive surroundings mandate that the only way for him to do so in that town is to successfully romance Sears, the daughter of a wealthy factory owner, which he does.  Eventually he impregnates her and the two marry after her father, who earlier sought to get rid of Harvey by arranging a possible position for him in another town at an excellent salary, rescinds his opposition.
The heart and soul of the movie is Signoret, whom Harvey meets at a local drama club, where they appear in a play together and immediately establish a torrid romance.  Harvey knows that, from the standpoint of a deep, abiding, romantic love, he vibrates with the older French woman in a way he never can with Sears.  It all comes down to ultimate opportunity, and so Harvey leaves the woman he deeply loves.  When the heartbroken Signoret takes her life Harvey is left with the trappings of success while enduring a painful inward death.
As a form of expiating what he has done, Harvey seeks out physical punishment by behaving in an unruly manner at a local pub.  His actions invite reprisal from a group of young toughs, who resent him as an interloper from the upper class who has come to sneer at them.  He is savagely beaten on a bridge near the bar a few minutes after his departure from the pub.  He makes no attempt to defend himself and encourages the beating, his eyes containing a dead look as he thinks about the recently deceased Signoret.  The scene contains such a realistic ring that, when director Jack Clayton and crew were shooting it late one evening, townspeople confused it for the real thing and contacted the police.
Clayton directed with a sure hand, insuring that the emotions appeared genuine, always asserted with tangible meaning at the proper level with none of the overacting of soap opera.  Harvey is seen as a young man torn emotionally between his genuine feelings for Signoret and his quest to escape a humdrum life in a small town, the prospect of which clearly terrifies him.",1013040000,46,2858,4.7283702213279675
1256445,5,B00002VW6M,"Strong feelings of hate, anger and saddness could not have been evoked without the tremendous performances of Simone Signoret and Laurence Harvey.  Simone Signoret was ideal for the part of Alice, the very intelligent, worldly but totally feminine character, and Laurence Harvey lived that part as the boy from the working class, not trying to deny it, but utterly ruthless in his pursuit to reach the top in the factory in Northern England.
The sex scenes were only incidental in comparison with the deep issues beneath the surface.  Oh, yes, Joe was a cad with a capital C.  He cared for Alice to a point, but he was looking to further his own nest, namely with the daughter of the factory owner.  So, he had a full relationship with Alice while seducing Susan in order to gain his own ends, to marry to the boss's daughter.  You feel compassion for Alice with the cruel creton she is married to, and let's face it, the way she is being used by Joe.  Anger and hatred are stong feelings only too good for Joe.
This movie is over 40 years old, but comparisons can be drawn to issues of the present day of abrasive, coarse young people along with their own arrogance employing all kinds or any kind of measures to get places in the corporate world with no concern of stepping on or hurting anyone along the way.  And at the other end of the spectrum, comparisons could also be drawn to an era before WWII, when at the turn of the century, Clive (?) seduced the young woman, and at the same time, he was trying to inveigle his way in the factory with the boss's daughter in ""An American Tragedy.""
Laurence Harvey had a true to life 'industrial north' accent.  The black and white clearly depicted the bleakness of an industrial Yorkshire town during the post war period in England.
Although this film was produced in 1959, and might be thought of as dated, the issues of ruthless ambition, marital abuse, and class distinction as very well played by the factory owner's wife still exist and might even loom larger than life today.",1007337600,8,2029,4.554945054945055

Joe Lampton is a young war veteran searching for employment in Yorkshire, England. He has no family to go home to because his parents were killed in an air raid so he works at a bank and library. In his leisurely hours, he attends an amateur theater where he meets two very different women: Alice Aisgail, a French actress and Susan Brown, the daughter of a wealthy insurance agent.

He tries to court Susan but her mother suspects he has a lecherous streak and sends her to boarding school. He asks for the address but she refuses. Oh well. he tells his roommate. I still have compensations. This compensation turns out to be Alice. Joe is aggressive and given to fits of rage but Alice tolerates him because she has low self esteem and just wants to be loved by him. When Susan comes home and invites him to dinner, he redirects his attentions to her since she has become more of a possibility.

When he tells his aunt, she says First you say you're in love with her and then all you talk about is the brass.

Whats wrong with wanting both? he asks. Im entitled to be in love with whoever I want.

You may or you may not. I don't know about that. she replies. But your not entitled to be in love with her money, lad.

Her warning proves prophetic. Susans father confronts Joe saying he has put her in the family way. If he marries her, he will give him a high ranking position in his insurance company. If not, he will run him out of town. Joe agrees. Now he must break the news to Alice.

Youve done very well for yourself, haven't you? she says. Finally, youve gotten everything you wanted. There is something you have never understood Joe. These people who live at the top--they are the same as anybody else. But you had it inside of you to be so much bigger than any one of them. You just had to be yourself. That was all. With me you were yourself. Only with me.

That night, she goes to the bar to drink her grief away and dies in a car accident. The last scene is Joe riding off with his new bride Susan. She is puzzled as to why there are tears in his eyes and assumes it is because he is so happy but we as the audience know the real reason. For the rest of his life, Joe will ask himself why he didn't stay with Alice, the only person he truly had an equal in.

Laurence Harvey has never been on the list of the greats like Fonda, Peck, Brando, Stewart, Burton or OToole but Ive always liked him in spite his detractors. There was a tension about him, an obvious neurosis that made him unique from other actors of his time. He gives a terrific portrayal of the arrogant, hedonistic social climber Joe who looks on women as objects of pleasure and attainment rather than people and believes the grass is greener on the other side only to find out too late, it isn't all its cracked up to be. The look on his face at the end says it all. He will never forgive himself for trading in the love of meaningful relationships for the love of cold, heartless money.

Simone Signoret won a well deserved Oscar for Best Leading Actress as Alice, the blond stage actress, who acknowledges Joes shortcomings but accepts him nonetheless because she wants so badly to belong to somebody. She has several great moments such as the love scene in the car, the farewell on the trainher face looks so desperate as she says goodbye to him, especially with the hair blowing in the windand her final drink in the bar after shes been ditched for good. Sometimes she doesnt even have to say anything, a simple, gesture here and there enough. Personally I would have voted for Audrey Hepburn in The Nuns Story since I feel like she had a more difficult task (to make a saintly woman look interesting and complex while fallen women roles like Alice usually attract audiences and the Academy like flies to honey) but Signoret is still miles away from a unworthy choice.

Hermione Baddeley as Alices friend Elspeth is well known as one of the tiniest roles ever to be nominated in the supporting category but she still makes the most of her two minutes and fifteen lines and shows more of this woman than Heather Sears does in her 80% screen time of merely mouthing Susans lines.

This is not a film to make you feel good but it has a lot to say about the age old phrase For what doth it profit a man to gain the world yet lose his soul?

It's a taut 115 minute black and white dramatic romance that is sometimes described as a kitchen sink drama; other times as an angry young man drama.  It stars Laurence Harvey as Joe Lampton, an ambitious young accountant of working class origins, scheming to marry the daughter, Susan Brown, of the wealthiest, most influential local factory owner.  Unfortunately, Lampton falls in love with the wife of another influential local man, Alice Aisgill, played by Simone Signoret in a deservedly Oscar-winning performance, only the second given to a Frenchwoman since one was given to Claudette Colbert in 1934. The film was based on the novel of the same name by author/screenwriter John Braine,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Room-at-the-Top/dp/0848809211/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Room at the Top</a>.

Many people consider this the best performance of the normally dour Harvey (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Manchurian-Candidate-Special-Edition/dp/B00020X88Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Manchurian Candidate (Special Edition)</a>), although he lost out Oscar-wise to Charlton Heston in BEN HUR.  (And it was a year in which every male actor nominated was a heavyweight.)  But there's never been any question that Signoret (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casque-d-Or-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B0006HC0GY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casque d'Or (The Criterion Collection)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diabolique-The-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B004NWPY1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diabolique (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>]), whose face and eyes speak volumes, is the heart of the movie, playing a part not written for a Frenchwoman, first offered to Vivian Leigh.  In fact, in an article entitled ""In Praise of Older Women,"" ""Time Magazine"" once remarked that Simone Signoret was ""everywoman's Bogart, in a trench coat, dangling a cigarette, in `Room at the Top.'""  Stalwart British supporting players Donald Wolfit, Allan Cuthbertson and Raymond Huntley provide strong performances as well. As does Hermione Baddeley, (also up for an Oscar, for the shortest performance ever nominated, at two minutes, 32 seconds, as Alice's friend Elspeth). Ian Hendry makes his film debut here.

The film was made in 1958, and its women are in the styles of 1958, confusingly enough to current viewers.  But ROOM is actually set in 1947, as, knew audiences upon its release, was the novel it is based upon, and as we are told in a briefly-glimpsed letter.  Therefore, Lampton is a 25 year old World War II veteran, who got his accountancy certificate during a three-year imprisonment as a prisoner of war.  On the strength of that certificate, he's left his downtrodden, down market hometown of Dufton, for Warnley, apparently a much pleasanter, better-off town.  (The movie was filmed in Bradford, West Yorkshire.)  Lampton quickly sets his sights on nave young Susan, and joins the local theatrical club to meet her, but inadvertently meets, has an affair with, and falls in love with sexy married, older woman Alice.  This film features the first open reference to the sex act in a British picture, and was therefore given an X certificate by the British Board of Film Classification.  So no British cinema chain would touch it.  Eventually the ABC chain took a chance and got a huge critical and commercial hit for its pains.  Sex always sells, we know.

Aside from its commanding performances, I find the movie somewhat dated.  Women have made loveless marriages to acquire wealth, power and status since time immemorial.  Men have, less frequently, done the same.  Extra-marital relationships are not unknown.  It all hardly seems a tragedy to me.",1331251200,,3961,6.0447227191413235
