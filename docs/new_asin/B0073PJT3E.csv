5053517,1,B0073PJT3E,"This movie is pretty bad. The story is pretty predicable, the effects are horrible and they were very sloppy. For example, you can see light switches in the house even though it takes place in the1800's. There is a weird flashback/dream scene which is never really explained. The movie starts out with literally about 7 minutes of just watching Billy the Kid walk. 7 minutes of him walking and nothing else. The only reason to watch this is to see Brandon Thornton shirtless throughout most of the movie. That was the only saving grace in this movie.",1415664000,,550,4.680412371134021
5053518,1,B0073PJT3E,"let me first say,I ordered two of the 1313 series.

Billy the kid was 68 minutes of pure torture! The only bright side that came from seeing this ""episode of 1313"" was that fortunately for me I still had time to cancel the second episode before it shipped.

I am at least thankful for that.",1342051200,5,290,4.254545454545455
5053519,1,B0073PJT3E,I don't get these 1313 movies. I saw the Bermuda triangle one but it was really unwatchable. This one wasn't as bad but nothing gay in this movie but the eye candy. The beginning was painful though. He walked around the desert for what seemed like 15 minutes holding his arm. If you wanna see some sexy men doing nothing for a hour and a half this is for you.,1341360000,9,359,4.142857142857143
8509375,2,B0073PJT3E,"Just another 1313 or Rapid Heart movie that is nothing more than an excuse to have a bunch of shirtless young men walking around. Cute guys, but the story was, as usual for this company, terrible.",1528502400,,196,4.472222222222222
8509376,1,B0073PJT3E,I didn't make it past the preview.  Is that adequate for writing a review?,1519776000,,74,4.285714285714286
8509377,1,B0073PJT3E,This is a gay porno movie with no porno! How did this movie get on Amazon?,1517788800,,74,3.6875
8509378,1,B0073PJT3E,I think this was aimed toward the gay community.  All are shirtless and wondering around in a yellowish world.  Really bad scripted plot and storyline.,1516233600,,151,5.0
8509379,2,B0073PJT3E,"Wounded, BILLY THE KID staggers into the remote and mostly deserted Western town of Hell's Heart to recuperate -- but soon realizes that he's pinned down in a trap. Even though I knew what I was getting into with this dreck, it was still bad, the acting....bad, the story....bad, the very idea....bad. The guys are hot enough but it is laughable to me that they have to throw in a woman to make it less......well, you know. You may really pass on this.",1513382400,,452,4.457831325301205
8509380,3,B0073PJT3E,All the movies in this series appear to have the same slow moving sequences and plot. Only good for seeing well-built guys in a movie.,1469145600,,134,4.4

8509382,2,B0073PJT3E,"It is 1881, and a wounded Billy the Kid (Brandon Thornton) is on the run from the law in New Mexico Territory.  Billy walks into the unknown town of Hell's Heart, population 128.  The local drunk, Buck (Lance Leonhardt) refers Billy to Lottie (Chelsea Rae Bernier), who runs a boarding house and general store.  After getting patched up, Billy notices that the town's population is a lot lower than 128.  What's up?  Acting Sheriff Earl Whitecastle (Jason Zahodnik) first wants the as-yet-unrecognized Billy gone but then, shortly later, along with blacksmith/stablemaster/Acting Deputy Lloyd (Ryan Curry), wants Billy to stay in town.  On the heights above Hell's Heart, two figures, Rabanne (Michael Hudson) and Uriel (Kodi Baker) keep a watchful eye and make plans.

As the film drifts from Western suspense into horror, there are mentions of Manitous, shape-shifters, a symbol the Apaches used to ward off evil, Roanoke Island, CROATOAN, and promised immortality.  There is plenty of treachery and of people not being as they seem.  Not all characters make it to the finish.  The film ends on a twist involving Doc Holliday (Ryan McIntyre).

 The filming was done through a filter, giving a yellowed-sepia look.  The music is Old Western movie style.

The negative things said in the reviews to date are essentially true and need not be repeated.  These are inevitable with a microbudget, negligible principal photography time, and little rehearsal.  Let me hunt for good stuff instead.

First, a little bit of research was done on Billy the Kid.  The movie does recognize his true name (Henry McCarty) and the aliases he usually used (Henry Antrim and William H. Bonney).  The movie does fit Billy into correct time and place slots.  The mentions of Manitou and Roanoke Island are evocative, even though their details and plausibility may be off.

The excesses of the Rapid Heart 1313 movie series are subdued.  Instead of endless shower scenes and guys rubbing themselves, there are plot and dialogue.  Billy does wander around some, especially in the first scene, but this pales to the scene-after-scene of one guy after another wandering through a mansion shouting ""Hello?"", which happens in a lot in many of the other 1313 movies.  None of the males in ""1313: Billy the Kid"" is shown wearing a shirt.  (Vests, aprons, or overalls do get worn a lot.)  There is no loud heartbeat dominating the soundtrack.  The film lasts a brief 72 minutes.

The sole extra is a commentary track by director David DeCoteau.

While one can't recommend this film in the abstract, it does have more ambition and thus needs more acting skill than do most of the other 1313 films.  Fans of 1313 films can watch it without qualm and even with pleasure.",1448496000,,2738,4.940789473684211
8509383,2,B0073PJT3E,What else can be said about all of the 1313 movies. They all look alike and they all suck. Some good eye candy is all the movies have to offer.,1420070400,,143,3.8
8509384,1,B0073PJT3E,"Are we serious, more 1313. The filmmaker i know uses this as a way to look or even play with hollywood wannabes. After watching this and several other 1313 films that is all i can come up with as to why these exist. There not interesting stories, there not well made, there not well acted or written as a matter of fact if they have a script i would be surprised . I would like to just see the pool party they have at the ""WRAP"" party i am sure its nude and there is all kinds of things going on. At least that would make sense to me as to why these films gat made. They have to be a way of meeting boys and if thats the case and they have the money cool go for it, but if anyone involved except the soulless shirt and often pant less boys of 1313  think there making a film, one that people will want to watch, please.",1419120000,,819,3.904191616766467
