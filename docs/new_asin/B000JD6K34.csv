8150071,4,B000JD6K34,"This 1965 film was directed by Andre Delvaux, one of Belgium's key directors. It is his first feature length fiction film, shot in black and white, on location in Flanders. This is one of the rare films available in the US by Delvaux. The director, son of Surrealist painter Paul Delvaux, is definitely influenced by painting and also music. He trained at the Conservatoire national de musique in Brussels. He helped created the National film school and taught there for years. Some of his pupils include Chantal Akerman, and Jaco Van Dormael. The film, entirely in Flemish, follows a forty-something year old man who teaches at an all-girl-school. He is apparently madly in love with one of his students, a young woman called Fran. The film mixes the surreal and the fantastic in the most formal and sober structure. The spectator does not quite know what is real or imagined throughout the film. One of the key moments is when Govert Miereveld is 'forced' to attend the excavation of a corpse by the coroner, and forced to witness an autopsy.  There are two ellipsis, and several inserts of the woman's face at various odd moments. The narrative is otherwise fairly linear, with jumps in time.
The French title for the novel was ""L'Homme au crane rase."" One of the most uncanny sequences takes place at the beginning when the man has a hair cut-- by the end of the film, his head will be almost shaved. There is a progression to his unbalanced state, and it is quite suspenseful. Some of the concepts at the core of Delvaux's work are beauty, death, the betrayal of images (of beauty), and life.  Delvaux used Belgian cinematographer Ghislain Cloquet who had worked with major French directors such as Alain Resnais and Chris Marker. It received a lot of attention by other European countries before being fully reappraised and appreciated by Belgian audiences.",1222992000,2,1863,4.836990595611285
