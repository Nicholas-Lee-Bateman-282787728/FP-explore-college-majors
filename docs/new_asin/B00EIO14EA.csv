8605767,5,B00EIO14EA,"A deeply moving, tragic, upsetting, and yet somehow still hopeful documentary on Irans brief Green Revolution, which for a moment seemed to portend real change, only to be crushed by a shockingly ruthless and violent response from the government.

By combining animation (recalling Waltz With Bashir) accompanying dramatic reading of blogs by those who lived through those days, combined with video footage grabbed on cell phones, twitter messages and more traditional talking head interviews, this documentary feels original and fast moving, combining the storytelling power of fiction, with the urgency and social import of truth.

While we all read the headlines here in America, somehow I didn't really understand how powerful the movement for change really was in those brief summer days of 2009, nor just how bloody and brutal the repression that followed.  As one interviewee points out, the West has largely forgotten about these human rights atrocities in dealing with Iran, focusing instead almost exclusively on the nuclear issue.  An excellent film and an important historic document.",1431388800,,1096,5.4674556213017755
8605768,5,B00EIO14EA,"Most Americans (myself included I suppose) understand little about Iran (and other Moslem countries too).  And most Iranians I think understand little about the US or at least about average Americans.  This film documents an important turning-point in recent Iran history: the election PRIOR to the latest one in which Ahmadinejad timed-out and Rouhani, the most reformist of the candidates, was elected.  Several years ago several candidates were running including Ahmadinejad, another self-identified reformist named Kharrabi, Moussavii and a few others.

Something unexpected happened: many people both young and old became excited about the election (even though the President has little power; the ""supreme leader"", currently Khameini, makes the major decisions.  Moussavi (and his wife, also a significant political figure) talked about things the Iranian people really cared about: unbridled corruption; lack of genuine democracy, lack of freedom of the press, of free speech or even free thought, the gradually worsening economic situation of average people, and a promise to work for real change.  People became so energized it appeared a non-violent revolution was taking place.  It was called the ""Green Wave"" or ""Green Revolution"".  When the polls closed, the speaker of parliament, Larijani, even congratulated Moussavi on his victory.
By the following day the whole story had changed.  Ahmadinejad was declared victor.  There was obvious vote fraud.  Rural areas had in some cases cast more votes than they had people.  Dead people cast votes.  Votes from the cities were under-counted.  People took to the streets in protest.  And the government cracked down with extreme brutality.  Beatings, stabbings, shootings, arrests without charge, people disappearing never to be seen again.  The commentators in this documentary (basically all of them Iranians in exile) say that the reality of Iran's government was exposed, both to everyone inside Iran and to the rest of the world for what it truly is: a totalitarian dictatorship.
Some of the stories sound much the same as in so many other places around the world: communist Russia, Mao's China, Pinochet's Chile, the military regime in Argentina, Myanmar, Pol Pot's Cambodia, and on and on.  The same, seemingly random violence, with the overarching goal of intimidating everyone with the fear that they'll be the next person suddenly grabbed and never seen again.

The film is simultaneously depressing and inspiring.  The underlying message is that much of the populace of Iran, even though they may not agree with many actions of the US, truly are sick of their government, want an end to their current system of government, and want to be part of the international community again.  I recommend it as excellent.",1388966400,,2779,5.371824480369515
