8009919,5,B0001CL2JU,"This tape came out in the mid-80's, right around the time wrestling (or at least the WWF) really got big.  This tape features Roddy Piper in several wrestling bouts.  Piper is seen teaming with Doctor D David Schultz against Jimmy Superfly Snuka and Andre the Giant.  This is a great match for Andre fans as well.  Piper is also seen teaming with frequent partner Cowboy Bob Orton against Jimmy Snuka and the Tonga Kid.

Perhaps one of the real highlights is Piper declaring himself as the person most capable of interviewing himself.  What follows is a split screen of Piper interviewing Piper.  It is classic Roddy Piper.

This tape is vintage Roddy Piper.  It is when Roddy was at his rowdiest.  It is before the (first) retirement match against Adrian Adonis, when Piper became a fan-favorite.

This is a must have for any Piper fan.  It also serves as a great tape for any wrestling fan who wants to see some great 'old school' wrestling bits.",1139961600,2,948,4.644578313253012
8009920,5,B0001CL2JU,"This tape highlights all of Piper's low lights and its one of my favorites.

You get to see Piper piss off everyone from the fans to the hosts of the old TNT show Tuesday Night Titans program. Check out the old Piper's Pit segment!  See piper and partners like Dr D David Shultz ( The guy that put that jackass John Stossel in his place...Great Stuff if you ever get to watch it) Ace Cowboy Bob Orton and Mr Wonderful Paul Orndorff take on Hogan,Snuka Andre and a host of others.

If you love the old school not the wrestling garbage of today you will love this tape.",1109548800,3,567,4.231481481481482
