8048156,4,B0007LFQ9C,"Nice Movie Package. The movies with Basil Rathbone portraying Sherlock Holmes are my preference. The others playing the Role are not nearly as good, although the movies were okay.",1295740800,,179,5.206896551724138
8048157,1,B0007LFQ9C,"When I received this video the quality was so poor my classroom students and I could not watch it.  The movie screen kept moving as
if it was a pirated copy??????  I am please that I did receive my money back and I appreciate that.  I did buy a newer copy from Amazon and that copy was a good copy.  I was disappointed because the story we read as a class was on the 10 movie DVD's but was too
poor to watch.  Thank you again for my refund.

8048158,1,B0007LFQ9C,"Don't buy this one, especially if you are a Basil fan as I am. Only one of the disks contains Rathbone and Bruce, and these episodes are very poor quality. I am a Holmes fan and have several duplicate DVD from other sources. I have examined the video quality of this set against other sets I have and these were substantially much poorer quality. I placed this DVD box set in my ""give away"" pile!",1250812800,5,396,4.293333333333333
8048159,5,B0007LFQ9C,This is a collection of the best Sherlock Holmes movies from the TV series.  It prompted us to return to Amazon.com for the whole series!,1235779200,,137,4.48
8048160,1,B0007LFQ9C,"I honestly thought that Basil Rathbone would play the lead character and was disappointed to find out that he is only in a couple of the 10 movies.  The pre-Basil Rathbone stories were true to Arthur Conan Doyle, but the quality of the film used was inferior.",1219968000,,259,4.51063829787234
8048161,4,B0007LFQ9C,"Thoroughly enjoyed classic Black and white editions of Sherlock Holmes.
Somehow that increased the level of suspense.  Excellent acting by Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. Intriguing plot lines and very innocent dialog, especially refreshing from today's vulgar use of expletives.

Great bargain, great entertainment for a rainy afternoon..thank you",1211760000,,348,6.081632653061225
8048162,3,B0007LFQ9C,"As has been mentioned, only three of these films star Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, so beware the impression that you get from the cover! The three Rathbone films that you DO get are the ones which have fallen into public domain and anyone may copy them.

I own all these films/episodes on various discs and if you're a HUGE Holmes fan, then this is probably an okay deal; however, the local Family Dollar stores and Big Lots offer most of these films on DVD at an even better price and in far superior assemblages. For example, I got the entire Ron Howard series on multiple discs in a single package at Big Lots for $6 bucks.

Also, all the Basil Rathbone films featured here are widely available for $1 per copy, each. Save-a-Lot stores offer all three in flat cardboard packaging.

Buyers should also beware that these are not the best prints available of the Rathbone films. For top clarity, get the UCLA film lab ones which were generated from pretty pristine 35mm prints of the original films. They are VERY good quality.

Finally, when you're out in search of these films, watch out that you don't buy ""colorized"" Rathbone films -- the pastel coloration is garish and renders these treasures into something quite fuzzy-looking and otherwise inferior.",1204156800,94,1260,4.739726027397261
8048163,2,B0007LFQ9C,"Cover shows Basil Rathbone but only one of the three disks are Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce movies.  The others are older, sometimes poor quality, and greatly altered ""versions"" of Conan Doyle's stories.",1195948800,29,201,5.483870967741935
