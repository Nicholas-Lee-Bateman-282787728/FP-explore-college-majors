4993471,2,B006JN87RA,"I must say that I was disappointed in this documentary, which I saw on British television.  The storyline was inaccurate (for an accurate version of the hunt for Hitler's V-weapons see the book, 'The Wizard War' ('Most Secret War') by Dr R V Jones, who played a major role in the actual events, and the photorecce part of the search actually backed up a picture that was already emerging from electronic warfare data and agents' reports.  No discussion of the unnecessary involvement of Duncan Sandys' committee, either, which (in common with most committees!) appeared to have searched for evidence that had already been gathered by Jones's team, thus slowing down the effort!  Concentrating practically entirely on the Spitfire as the main photorecce aeroplane is also inaccurate.  As excellent as the Spitfire was in this role,  much of the work was performed by de Havilland Mosquitos  -by far the best photorecce platform of the war.  All in all, a very simplistic account of the actual events for which there is no real excuse.",1329782400,,1033,4.97093023255814
4993472,5,B006JN87RA,"This DVD shows and explains a little known aspect of WWII operations. It is about 60 minutes long and has a set up for video descriptions and also English subtitles.
It uses black and white newsreels of the time, some reenactments and some of the actual people involved in the operations; showing what they did and how these 3D photo reconnaissance missions were made. The Spitfire became in these instances a spy plane to photograph, observe and determine what targets were like in enemy territory and to discern what actions were taking place. We are shown the discovery of rocket sites and how analyses were made.

The importance and difficulty of these missions are well revealed. This is a little known part of the war that is fascinating and amazing for the detail and the significance of what it accomplished. The photo analysis experts give their thoughts and recollections as well as some historians. The irritating aspect is that a male narrator will explain what is happening in the footage and then a female voice will come in with a comment which makes a verbal confusion/ annoyance.
The addition of Hollywood's help after America's entrance into the war is described, but the emphasis is on the British effort. Footage is also shown of what is left of the German rocket sites today.
This is indeed a well done and worthwhile record of the 3D spies of WWII.",1329436800,5,1370,4.780590717299578

8499457,5,B006JN87RA,"Sometimes you find out about key factors in WW2 that are really surprising. Very well done documentary, with as advanced as the German's were in technology, the Brits really saved the world by figuring out 3D technology. This is worth knowing. And remembering.",1441152000,,260,5.069767441860465

8499459,5,B006JN87RA,Excellent!!!!!!! Highly recommended!!!!!!,1413849600,,41,13.0
8499460,1,B006JN87RA,The binaural sounds are completely off.  Like they say in their description they did not research the subject at all. Very good as a screensaver for my TV.,1402444800,,155,4.535714285714286
8499461,5,B006JN87RA,Bought for my father who dad was a photographer in a reconnaissance plane during WWII. Not in the film though. I watched it before and knew he would love it. I'm not a big war buff or anything. I like history and mysteries though and this had enough of both to keep a gal interested. Good enough to watch again.,1399680000,,311,4.2
8499462,5,B006JN87RA,I this video is so interesting. It definitely is worth viewing. What a crazy world we live in. This dvd just goes to show it has been for years.,1389657600,,144,4.0
8499463,5,B006JN87RA,Great learning tool on how  many techniques were developed in early WW2 that have been adapted to computer tecnology and give us great insight to looking at high altitude aerial photography with great realism. The recon version of the Spitfire was a perfect plane to mount the cameras due to its speed and high altitide capability to avoid detection and shoot down. Was personally involved with some aspects of what the film revealed and was able to write my story and tell my grandchildren of a part Iplayed in the Cold War. My father actually flew the recon spitfire in 46-48 as part of his job with the US government . His apartment building was a victim of a V2 rocket attack during the german V2 blitz of London. These are things which made the film very real to me  and my family.  The story of the Manhattan Project was equally interesting as it portrayed the scientific achievment of the scientests who developed the first atom bomb and then the moral dilemma they found themselves in when they realized the destructive power and were reluctant to complete the project.,1376956800,,1077,4.6878306878306875
8499464,5,B006JN87RA,You will be glad you got this DVD  -- I got three copies!  This DVD talks about how 3D Stereoscopic viewing saved the day in WWII.,1372723200,2,130,3.9615384615384617
8499465,4,B006JN87RA,"I am an avid reader and documentary watcher of WWII history but this is the first I had ever heard of this interesting history of aerial spying and its role in taking out Germany's rocket program.

I must admit that another reviewer's questioning of the accuracy of the history gave me pause but regardless of the accuracy of the politics, the ability to see the footage of the old photos, the ruins of the rocket sites and the original model created from stereoscopes made it a very worthwhile DVD.

BTW, I assume any WWII buff will already be familiar with the Foyle's War DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Foyle-s-War-Set-1-The-German-Woman-The-White-Feather-A-Lesson-In-Murder-Eagle-Day/dp/B00007KLE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Foyle's War: Set 1 (The German Woman / The White Feather / A Lesson In Murder / Eagle Day)</a>&nbsp;series, but just in case you aren't, do check it out.  Like this DVD, it takes lesser known aspects of the war and shares it in a compelling fashion.",1354320000,2,1026,5.69281045751634
