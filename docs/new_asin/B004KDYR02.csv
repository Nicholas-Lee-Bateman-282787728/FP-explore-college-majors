4396855,5,B004KDYR02,A cult classic in the making... I wouldn't want to spoil any surprises so you'll have to discover the plot yourself... I'll just say it's an unusual ride through a some twisted minds with a bit of psychedelia thrown in for good measure... The soundtrack is amazing!... Don't miss this little gem of a film... it's quite a trip!,1307404800,4,327,4.559322033898305
4396856,5,B004KDYR02,I saw this movie at a film festival in Connecticut and it was definitely the best of the fest!  These two idiots build a giant machine which I won't give you any details about because it will spoil the story.  Not a normal movie.  Don't watch it with your parents.  It's like a cult film you get stoned and watch with your friends on Tesla's birthday.,1306886400,2,351,4.2727272727272725
8432878,1,B004KDYR02,I am obviously of the wrong generation for this film.  I found it one of the worst ones I have ever seen.,1313625600,,105,3.772727272727273
8432879,5,B004KDYR02,"Sveener & The Shmiel features a pair of brothers who spend much of their time wandering around in their underwear. That's a little strange, but what isn't strange about Sveener & The Shmiel? At various points of the movie I would describe it as touching, disturbing, intriguing, bizarre and (most frequently) hilarious.

I'm procuring a copy for my personal library. It'll be something...very different...to whip out when we have house-guests.

P.S. The sound-track is marvelous.",1313452800,,479,5.373333333333333
8432880,5,B004KDYR02,"I had to watch this film twice to be sure of what I saw.  This is not your regular boy meets girl type deal, but in the end that's exactly what it is.  Sveener and the Shmiel are brothers, wounded by a life that we can only guess at, who are both combative and loving toward each other, almost a George and Lenny Of Mice and Men derivative.  The film itself is a reflection of their lives in that it has its own rough edge, but comes through for the audience in the end.  I could go on with specific spoilers, but this is the kind of film that needs to be seen without any hint of what goes on.",1313452800,,594,3.925
8432881,5,B004KDYR02,"Disturbing, dark, inspiring and uplifting.  This movie has a little bit of everything.  Sort of a guilty pleasure.  Fun!",1313452800,,120,5.2105263157894735
8432882,5,B004KDYR02,"I had heard about this movie at different film festivals.  I guess the director and his wife saved money and financed it out of their own pockets and filmed with mostly their friends and family.  I had heard good things but didn't take the time to give it a chance.  A friend of mine bought the DVD hearing the same things as me and we watched it one night and LOVED IT!  I thought it was going to be a background movie but there is something unexplainable about how cool, and bizarre and how much emotion is contained in this movie.  It may not be perfect, but its human, theres heart in every frame, its raw, its worth watching if you can enjoy something real beyond the mainstream blockbusters that have been disappointing more and more recently.

I always like to support those that are taking money out of their own pocket to create something they believe in so I bought this bad boy too.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",1313452800,,936,4.375722543352601
8432883,5,B004KDYR02,"I bought this DVD after seeing SATS at a festival. It's in my twisted comedy section, but it offers so much more emotion as the story and adventure plays out! A HUGE feature of this gem is the music! I have already researched and bought it. Hope to see a Hi Def release some day!",1312675200,,279,4.090909090909091
8432884,5,B004KDYR02,"""Sveener and the Shmiel"" combines bizarre visuals and a pulsating
soundtrack to lure you into an endearing character story.  Two brothers struggle
to navigate down twisted paths that lead to accepting responsibilities and
letting go of the demons that haunt their psyches.  The mood careens from
extreme frustration to absurd humor to transcendent flashes of wisdom.  My
favorite quote of the film, from the family lawyer played pitch perfectly by
Dave Pressler, is ""In the end, everybody finds out what matters.  But, it's much
better not to wait till the end."".
As unexpected bonds form in the midst of surreal circumstances, the story
transforms despair into hope.  ""Sveener and the Shmiel"" has a wonderful
cast, an almost abstract, unique visual style and a captivating human story.
Unforgettable!",1310342400,4,801,5.275590551181103
8432885,5,B004KDYR02,"What a ride this movie is! Dark - funny - oddball little movie with a definite ""rock and roll"" sensibility. It's a love story wrapped in a ""twenties-angst"" dramedy -- classic ""sibling rivalry"" tale meets a sort of ""reverse Rain Man"" meets ""Eraserhead"" (in a good way) -- great acting - beautifully shot and directed. One to watch - and a writer/director to keep your eye out for.",1309651200,2,379,4.588235294117647
8432886,5,B004KDYR02,"One of the most unique films I've seen in a while, Sveener and the Shmiel wraps a excellent story in very uncommon packaging.

I personally love all of the quirky little dynamics of the movie. It's funny, weird, dark, beautiful, and personal all at the same time. This is a film that requires multiple viewings to appreciate all of its detail: the way some of the goofy dialogue is delivered ""If you want to poop in color, you gotta eat a few crayons."", the great characters (the Shmiel and Tracy!), the messy and outlandish production design (the machine, the Shmiel's obsession with chewing on a doll leg), the awesome quirky musical soundtrack (with my favorite recording of the Saint Motel track Pity Party), and the feeling that this film came together with the right mix of hand crafted filmmaking, luck, and happenstance to give us something really special.",1308700800,2,864,4.837837837837838
8432887,5,B004KDYR02,"A very funny, yet heartfelt, romantic comedy about two brothers who discover the unthinkable - Girls! This edgy, avant garde production features four outstanding performances by its lead cast highlighted by hot newcomer Christine Woods.  A solid movie with excellent effects and topped off with an exceptional music score. A really weird one for the ages!!",1307664000,2,356,5.357142857142857
