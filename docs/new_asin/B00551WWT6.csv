If you want to see a blatant rip-off of one of the best movies of all time with horrible acting and worse SFX, this is the movie for you. Words can not accurately convey the depth of this cinematic train-wreck. You have to see it to believe it!",1336003200,,388,3.9871794871794872
4571125,3,B00551WWT6,this movie is ok i seen better i seen worst only spent 1.99 to watch it and thats what it is worth to me...i do agree with the other's this movie is a rip off from jaws but on the other hand can u really compare the two?,1330560000,,220,3.6041666666666665
4571126,2,B00551WWT6,"I love shark movies, but this one is not one of the best. I did not like it at all. I wasted my money on it. Not worth buying in my oppinion. Two headed Shark attack is better.",1328572800,,176,3.6578947368421053
4571127,5,B00551WWT6,If you love drive-in/cult classics you'll love this movie! A direct rip-off of Jaws you have a big shark attacking a resort during the annual regata. It pairs well as a double feature with movies such as Tentacles.,1325548800,6,214,4.657894736842105
4571128,1,B00551WWT6,"What a terrible film with bad dubbing to boot, I can see why this was shelved for years.
Why do people on here write good reviews for awful movies?
Take my word for it folks, I believed the hype of this film and let me honestly say after buying and viewing it, What A Let Down.
I can't understand why Universal took objection against this film as it was never any serious threat to Jaws.
Buy Jaws if you don't already have it, don't waste your money with this mess.
The Last Shark aka Great White if anyone cares.",1320105600,,513,4.191919191919192
4571129,5,B00551WWT6,"So, in 1982, Film Ventures International released the mother of all Italian Sharksploitation flick's, Great White, or The Last Shark if you have seen the DVD. The film is about a 35 foot Great White shark invading the town of South Bay (Set in Savannah, Georgia). From there on, it's pretty much like Jaws, Mayor doesn't want to close the beaches, swimmers go in the water and the shark gets them.

The Film itself is very good! The shark is my favorite part of 'The Last Shark', it looks MUCH better than the CGI Sharks we see in todays movies. The shark doesn't have much screen time but when it does, it's never boring! Plus, the shark roars everytime it surfaces.

The music is another great part of this film. In the US, the score was composed by Morton Stevens, his score is not features on the DVD, only in the US theatrical version. The score on the DVD, is by the De Angelis brothers who never fail to make a great score. The opening song, Hollywood Big Time, is also very well done as well.

Overall, I'd give the film a 9/10. I don't see why people hate this film. Sure it has some similarities to Jaws and Jaws 2, but it is much more original than anything we have seen today. Plus, the film has a better looking shark than Jaws 2, 3-D, and The Revenge. If you like Jaws, you gotta see this film, it really is amazing!",1319673600,19,1330,4.290836653386454
4571130,3,B00551WWT6,"As noted above, this is a burned-on-demand DVD-R, not a mastered DVD.

The image quality is actually amazing. Sharp, clean, excellent color, letterboxed. The audio is another story. A lot of the dialogue is at low volume and is hard to understand, and drowned out further by the much louder music and sound effects. A disappointment, especially considering the surprising video quality, but the film is still watchable (listenable?)

There are 9 chapter stops, but no menu (the movie just starts playing when you pop in the disc), no subtitles (a shame, considering the audio issue), no extras.",1313971200,5,594,5.051020408163265
4571131,3,B00551WWT6,"What can I say?  It's Jaws.  Exact same concept, same plot structure, essentially the same characters.  They sort of combined Brody and Hooper into one character, but there's a Quint character who even looks like Robert Shaw, a Larry Vaughn character, and an Ellen Brody character.  The specifics of the various shark attacks are different, but it doesn't matter.  If you've seen Jaws, there are no surprises here.  That said... I have to admit I actually enjoyed it.  It can't compare to Spielberg's version, but it's a solid telling of the Jaws story.  Not outstanding, mind you, but competent.  The director kept the pace moving, so it never got dull.  No lengthy talking scenes to fill out the running time here, as you'll often find in B-movies.  This film is always moving forward, advancing the plot and providing an adequate amount of action -- though admittedly, they didn't have to work very hard to accomplish this, since they were just following the plotline of Jaws to the letter.  The mechanical shark looks pretty good, and to the film's credit, they kept footage of it to a minimum, relying mostly on footage of real sharks, which integrates well with the footage of the mechanical shark.  James Franciscus and Vic Morrow turn in acceptable performances, and there are actually some pretty cool death scenes.  All things considered, a fairly entertaining film -- if you can get past the fact that it's essentially an illegitimate remake of Jaws.  If you're a total Jaws fanatic, it's probably worth checking out.",1308614400,11,1528,4.9140625
4571132,4,B00551WWT6,"I've been assembling a collection of shark-movies, and this was one of the remaining trophies I was lacking.  I love cheesy 70's and early 80's monster movies.....anything prior to CGI goofiness....and this film satisfies my ""rubber monster head"" desire.  I actually wish there was more of the monsterous shark's head and upper body, that rises out of the water.  I could have done without all the stock footage of sharks, that are supposed to be the creature of the title, but are clearly different species and sizes of other sharks.  Despite this, it was just what I wanted to see, so my four star review should be used as a guide only if you like bad monster movies.  If you like quality monster movies, such as the excellent Jaws, then this is a one star movie.  If you know what I'm talking about, then you'll know whether to buy this or not.....",1373241600,2,851,4.565789473684211
4571133,1,B00551WWT6,the movie was stupid the shark was a cheap version of jaws and so was the whole plot to the story to begin with,1369353600,,111,3.6666666666666665
4571134,3,B00551WWT6,"The quaint coastal community of Port Harbor is terrorized by a ferocious 35-foot great white shark in 1981's THE LAST SHARK! The finest of all JAWS imitations saw a mere two weeks in theaters before being pulled for its 'slight' similarities to the Universal classic, but unlike so many of the pathetic rip-offs that have surfaced over the years, THE LAST SHARK merits viewing by killer shark fans more than any other. James Franciscus and Vic Morrow headline in two noteworthy performances, even if they do closely shadow the characters played by Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw. While the plot points and major action sequences also mirror many of the events that occurred in both JAWS and JAWS 2, they are carried out with all of the same care and affection. Director Enzo G. Castellari employs a variety of techniques to bring his man-eating menace to life, including the clever use of a rubber buoy to subtly imply the shark's presence during one of its attacks. No one will accuse the film of being ultra-realistic between the cheap rubber puppets and frequent intercutting of stock footage and live-action, but Georgio Ferrari deserves a considerable amount of credit for his impressive mechanical shark that, some may say, looks better than the shark in JAWS. US copyright laws have kept THE LAST SHARK off of the market for years, but this entertaining little gem has invaded new waters through various media outlets online.

4571135,2,B00551WWT6,"Anyone, I mean ANYONE who could actually claim (Great White or Last Shark)to be a good film has ingested an unusually high amount of drugs.

Simply put, this is a pitiful ripoff of lousy quality. The acting is terrible and the ""effects"" bottom of the barrel. Some of the reviews on here are delusional. Some guy said it was better than the CGI-loaded films of today. Well, while CGI can be annoying, how could you say stock footage of a shark swimming around maybe half the size of the mechanized piece of crap they use looked good? I think the water changes colors about 5 times during the film.

Damn, even the women are hideous and flat-chested! Can't have that in a shark movie!

Man, the shame of anyone involved with this film must've been huge. The deaths are comical, and the opening of some muscle-bound douche wind surfing for what seems like an eternity is among the worst in cinematic history.

This is terrible people! Hard to believe Universal sued the makers of this crapfest because it would've died an appropriately quick death from word of mouth.

That being said, it was hilariously awful at times and well worth watching for that reason and that reason alone. The transfer to DVD was more than acceptable as well shockingly. The audio sucks, but that's the way it was shot. I have to admit, I always wondered how bad this film was and now I know-it's worse than Bea Arthur in the nude!",1357430400,2,1405,4.559523809523809

4571137,3,B00551WWT6,"Hahahahahaha......well it IS a shark movie....I was disappointed with some of the acting.  And the music was very, very bad....it didn't set the mood for the danger a shark truly brings forth.",1355529600,,192,5.0
4571138,1,B00551WWT6,"I recently saw this movie and watched JAWS again as well and I can confirm that this movie is definitely not JAWS. I can't believe normal moviegoers can even make a statement like that.
Yes, the basic story is a straight rip-off of JAWS, but everything else is different and much much worse. The shark looks terrible and fake. It closely resembles the inflatable shark my dad bought me when I was 12 yrs old and has just as much movement. The script is terrible and you end up not caring for any of the characters because they're all paper thin.
Where JAWS had the emotional depth of the ocean, this movie is more akin to a kiddie pool.

Please DO NOT WATCH this and waste your money. You will not make it to the end! Its doesn't even land in the ""So-bad-it's-good"" category like the Mega-shark v/s Dino-Croc  type movies.!  I wish I could give it lower ratings! UGHHHHH! Nowhere close to JAWS!",1350259200,2,894,4.439024390243903
4571139,3,B00551WWT6,"In 1982, a group of italian filmmakers brought their own brand of shark-related horror to the United States, in the form of a movie called ""Great White.""  Shortly after release, someone at Universal smelled something fishy with the movie (pardon my pun) and brought the filmmakers to court.  Universal was able to successfully sue the filmmakers, and demanded Great White be pulled from North American theaters.  Courts obliged, the distributor yanked the film from screens, and the fil hadn't been seen in the United States since...

...well, up until now actually.  One night while reading stuff about Jaws I stumbled upon the Wikipedia page for this movie and had to look it up.  Amazon had a 7-day rental available (unusual, but why not?) so I went ahead and rented the film.

With a story like that, you know what to expect out of what is now called ""The Last Shark.""  People laughing, people at a beach, shark, screaming, more shark, terror, shrieks, shark battle, end movie.  You would be almost precisely correct--except it feels like you're holding a wet towel because we've seen this movie before.  It was written and directed better in 1975 and it was called JAWS.  Not much in the form of star-power with this film.  The only recognizable cast member is the late and great Vic Morrow, who would pass away during the filming of Twilight Zone: The Movie a year after this was produced.

So other than to see one of Morrow's last film roles or to see just how cheesy shameless rip-offs from the 80s could be, I have little reason to recommend that anybody watch this.  The story of its production is an interesting one, but it doesn't make it an interesting film.",1350259200,2,1672,4.720689655172414

4571141,4,B00551WWT6,"Yes, this is the movie Universal Pictures blocked from being shown in North America back in 1981.  They claimed plagiarism, specifically Jaws, as their excuse for having it banned.  The absurdity of this claim is immediately apparent the moment you watch The Last Shark (original title: Great White).  Yes, both movies are about a shark.  Beyond that, there is no comparison.  One movie is a classic; the other is a sad little wannabe.

The Last Shark is about a windsurfing race to be held with full knowledge of a shark in the area.  Precautions are taken to ensure the race can take place.  They put up shark-proof netting and ring the area with armed men on boats; for good measure, they include spotters.  ""Absolutely nothing is going to happen.""  Famous last words, they hadn't counted on a sneaky shark that has the ingenuity to trap a couple of divers in a cave.........by shoving rocks in front of the opening!  This shark also does its own version of fishing.  It's hysterical, I don't know what Universal had to be afraid of, no one is ever going to confuse this movie with Jaws.
As for the quality of this movie, the transfer is fine; it's a nice looking subpar movie.  Luckily, as I was in the mood for a comedy, it fit the bill perfectly.  It is unintentionally funny in all the right ways: dopey dialog, a daffy plot, and dubious acting (Vic Morrow gave it all he had while James Franciscus looked painfully uncomfortable throughout with a performance that barely registered above that of a mannequin).  As for the shark, sometimes it was a fake and sometimes they used actual footage of sharks.  The quality was inconsistent throughout, as though several filmmakers got together and each took a hand in one scene or another (without bothering to check to see what the others had done).  It had a pasted together feel to it; complete with choppy editing and abrupt scenes.
As with other films of this type, the usual happens, people lose life and limb, everyone runs in panic.  The local yokels and one cowboy try to bag the killer shark (some by trolling with a side of beef!).  It was beyond dumb.  I actually liked it.  I haven't seen anything this loony since............................?

Of course, it's a keeper!  Anything that makes me laugh that hard is worth keeping around.

8457284,3,B00551WWT6,"I am one of the few here in the States who actually saw this in the theater.

Even at 9 years old, I recognized it as a ripoff retelling of Jaws. The girl I saw it with was even trying to convince me it was Jaws 3, but under a different name. I didn't fall for that.

Seeing it now, it looks ridiculous, but at the time, this movie kept a wide-eyed 9-year-old boy transfixed. It's never dull, and some of the attacks are a little disturbing to sensitive viewers.

Make no mistake, though. This movie is horrible, and time has not been good to it. It really is better suited to people who can appreciate the unintentional camp associated with films like ""The Room"" and ""Troll 2"".

In summary, it's the shark movie Ed Wood would have made.",1414627200,,737,4.280575539568345
