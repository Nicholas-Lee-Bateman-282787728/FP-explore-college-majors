8301210,3,B001F7Q4G6,"The Wonderland Carolers are excellent carolers worth listening to, but the visuals are primarily the group caroling as various backrounds appear behind them. That's fun to watch for 4 minutes, then the fun is gone.
I'd say whoever produced the video figured that most people would put on the video
as background atmosphere for a Christmas party.
With that knowlege, I say buy the CD version instead, unless you and friends want to have a karaoke session during your party, since the lyrics can be displayed.",1271980800,3,507,4.906976744186046
8301211,5,B001F7Q4G6,"We thought the video was very well produced using different backgrounds & attractive singers. The costumes were tastefully selected for the occasion. The singers had wonderful voices. Great personalities came across to our audience as they were singing.
I would recommend this video to all my friends.",1266364800,,301,5.425531914893617
