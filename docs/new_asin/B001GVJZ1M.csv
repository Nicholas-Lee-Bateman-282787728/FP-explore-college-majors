8307250,4,B001GVJZ1M,"Okay this is a different type of film. Really. Let me say right now that I enjoyed and liked this film. It has a few very funny scenes. However, it is an experimental film and thus as with these surreal types of films you don't get the normal story or plot. In this case you don't get a plot at all, it's more of a concept. Yet and still I think this film is very good. The colors just pop and make the scenes come alive. The girls are pretty and yet very silly and alive. Which only works do to the overall theme and context of the film. When thinking about this film I am and was reminded of two other films, ""Daisies"" and ""Zazie Dans Le Metro"". Which have a similar structure and wild or craziness to and within them. As you can tell, Zazie Dans Le Metro is French and the other is Czech and both where made in the 1960's. However, Beautiful Daydreams is out now, 2009 and yes it's in this mold of new wave cinema, from it's editing style and soundtrack to it's surreal, psychedelic and stylistic look. Yes, like it's for runners and yet it is new and fresh. What makes it new, is it's somewhat spiritual undertone. Which to me makes it fresher. I mean it has a Buddhist sort of underlaying theme which I feel makes it far more interesting than many of the so called normal films of the day. So I say watch it or at least some of it. It's different, but in a good way. I have to say to the director, thank you for taking a chance and making something that is different, so few do.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beautiful-Daydreams/dp/B001GVJZ1M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beautiful Daydreams</a>",1248912000,,1637,4.571428571428571
8307251,5,B001GVJZ1M,"""Food is real.  Life is not.  Let's eat.""  This film is a delightful whimsy about two friends, Sunday and Deja, who search for meaning when they realize that they're missing something elusive and important in their lives.  Sunday wants to be a writer, but she lacks inspiration.  Deja loves letters more than anything, but she has never received one.  And so begins their quest, leading them along a meandering path full of questions and answers, bizarre and joyful experiences, and meetings with wise folk which lead to more questions and perhaps more answers.  ""Life is all about randomness,"" says one guru.  ""Everybody's related to everybody.  It's like we're roommates and the universe is one big dormitory.""

Full of comedic moments and interesting insights, ""Beautiful Daydreams"" is beautifully shot and directed by Christopher Snow.  Stars Cindy Ho and Christine Du wonderfully portray the two best friends who search together to find their own ways in the world.  The girls are cute, funny and work well together with many moments worth remembering.  And they have one of the funniest, silliest eating-of-sandwiches scenes ever.

In all, it's a great little movie that's a lot of fun to watch.  You might even find for yourself a little joy and meaning...or something.",1235865600,,1276,5.096618357487923
8307252,2,B001GVJZ1M,"I like goofy indepenant films, but this effort just goes nowhere.
There are a few moments that make me smile, but I wouldn't recommend this unless you feel like looking a a couple pretty girls for an hour+.
I'm not a fan of the poor ""acting""; it would have been better to have them just be themselves, natural and informal.
Pass this one by!",1233705600,,341,4.34375
