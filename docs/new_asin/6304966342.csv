7880132,5,6304966342,"Barry Goldwater was an accomplished photographer, adventurer, and businessman long before he entered politics.  His love of Arizona, and its peoples and topography, is nicely illustrated by the selection of photographs and interviews in this program.  It was originally produced by Arizona State University for broadcast and it apparently was issued on VHS.  I ordered a VHS but received a DVD.  The DVD appears to be a conversion of the VHS tape with VHS-quality video and audio.  It was still worthwhile for me and for anyone interested in Barry Goldwater and/or Arizona history.
