3763918,4,B001QD09Q0,"I was actually looking for a workout with this DVD, but while it's not anything close to some of the other dance workouts available, it provided a lot of useful information and hints for someone who's curious about burlesque and might want to play with it. The routines are fun - from the pure sensuality of the Honey routine, to the more risque Spice routine, and will kick up the inner diva - especially Jo's emphasis on sensuality and how to pose. The Spice routine used moves that I had learned from the belly dance workouts I've been using. Jo is ridiculously cute and has some feistiness, which made it even more enjoyable. The costuming and tassel twirling hints were fun - and I look forward to using her suggestions to make life more entertaining.",1252800000,5,756,4.607407407407408
3763919,4,B001QD09Q0,"I'm the founder of a burlesque group in the UK, and I used this DVD to help demonstrate some of the basic elements of burlesque dance. It's very helpful, and easy to follow. The instructor is also entertaining!

  However, it does come across as rather low budget, and the overall look of the DVD, including the packaging, is very unpolished. Despite that, I'd still recommend this for anyone who just wants to have a bit of fun learning some new dances, or a new performer who wants to learn some burlesque basics.",1245369600,15,515,4.576086956521739
3763920,4,B001QD09Q0,"I enjoyed this DVD.  It gave simple routines and taught being able to represent yourself with confidence.  What a way to be a ""Goddess"".",1244160000,2,136,4.625
3763921,4,B001QD09Q0,"This Dvd is a BLAST!  Its super easy to follow and super fun to do! All of her instruction honestly makes a woman feel like a kitten =)
As a dancer, I feel as though I can incorporate ideas from these two separate choreography's  and fuse them together with my other styles of dance!

There is even a portion of the DVD dedicated to costuming, Pasties AND Tassel Twirling!!!

This DVD builds self confidence and has a super fun feel all the way through.  She is enthusiastic about everything and is an amazing teacher!

Cant wait for the Fan DVD!!!",1240876800,3,548,4.43
3763922,5,B001QD09Q0,"This video is simply fantastic!  Jo is the perfect teacher- wise, gentle, and patient.  These combinations are a blast to do and really make you feel sexy and sassy.  I highly recommend this video for anyone interested in the world of burlesque, stripping and sexual confidence.  A definite A+!",1237680000,14,294,4.938775510204081
3763923,5,B001QD09Q0,"Does he have a special birthday coming up?  Or your anniversary?  Or you want to spice things up a bit?  Get this DVD!  Don't worry about it being difficult!  Jo breaks it down so that it is very easy!  You will be bumping and grinding in no time!  She will tell you how to use your clothing as props to perform a sensuous or a baudy dance.  She also shares the surprisingly simple secret to tassel twirling!  Have fun, and hide the DVD so that you keep your secrets secret!",1237507200,3,474,4.177777777777778
3763924,5,B001QD09Q0,"Jo Weldon aptly describes burlesque as a ""sophisticated and theatrical art with a long history,"" and it's a history that will go well into the future, in many forms. Anyone planning on a Broadway musical career should learn what Jo has to teach in this DVD, because sooner or later, they'll need to know. One has only to see the late great Bob Fosse's choreography (""Cabaret,"" etc.) to know what many of his ideas were based on...burlesque!

Jo covers many subjects in this DVD, and teaches 2 routines. The first is ""Honey,"" which is smooth and sensual with a feather boa, the 2nd is ""Spice,"" which is faster and raunchier because it includes the classic ""bump and grind"" moves. Both are demonstrated and broken down step by step for easy absorption, and are simple to learn. It's the style that takes practice, in this ""art of concealing and revealing.""

Jo among her many credits is founder of the New York School of Burlesque. The music used is terrific and very authentic, and is drummer and bandleader Ronnie Magri's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shim-Sham-Revue-Music-of-New-Orleans-Burlesque-Shows-of-the-30-s-40-s-50-s/dp/B000079455/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shim Sham Revue- Music of New Orleans Burlesque Shows of the 30's, 40's & 50's</a>

There is a Warm-Up section, and the ""Extras"" are excellent, and are on costuming. Stockings (runs are O.K., but the seams better be straight!), corsets, and those special little tassels. You'll learn how to glue `em and move `em. They are demonstrated on a bra, but of course are supposed to be applied to your skin. These days we are used to seeing actresses on the screen ""in the buff"" and it is so boring. Jo does much more just taking off a single glove.",1237420800,22,1755,5.260714285714286
3763925,5,B001QD09Q0,"This fun, instructional burlesque program is presented by Jo Weldon, School of Burlesque instructor also award winning performer,from NYC.
 Burlesque is a beautiful, sexy art, a journey into self discovery. This program unveils basic elements. Two routines with five combinations each will introduce a sensual flow, bump and grind and more to fascinate you with.
 To enter the program, the captivating Jo Weldon welcomes you with a brief history on the art.  A simple chat on how to put together a costume, types of boas to get you started.
Next get ready for a flow, body posture and positions to prepare for the warm-up done to authentic, classical burlesque music. The warm up is slow, sensual and so much fun, bringing you in touch with total femininity; the curves of the hip, a sensual rotation in the hip area known as the grind. Tips on beautiful leg and feet positioning.
 Yet that's not all! Absolute sensuality follows in the segment of the burlesque flow. Sexy arm patterns  such as shoulder rolls, snakey arms, tracing the silhouette, of the body with the hands, outline the hips, changing level of the body using plies to add more drama to the dance. A very enjoyable segment.
The ""honey and spice"" routine is next. This sensual routine has 5 step by step combinations that will take you from handling the boa in a fun sexy manner, twirling and dropping, glove technique, shoulder strap tease and finally dropping the bra, but before then, skillfully picking up the boa to cover up. Simple and fun!
The  ""spice"" routine is next with technique on bump and grind, and get ready! After the basics, another sizzling 5 combinations! Learn hip bumps and pulses, pelvic and arm circles, traveling steps, shimmies. This was my favorite since the hip accents really add drama to the dance. The costuming is gorgeous fringe which plays on every move.
To finalize the program, bonus tips on stockings, corsets, how to purchase and how to remove them while on stage. Includes a brief chat on tassel twirling, types of pasties,and how to properly adhere them.

This is a fun entry level program, simple to follow and very well presented. The segments are carefully placed to guide with ease into the slow sensual or the playful and mischievous mood you may want to portray. Slightly over one hour of instruction set to beautiful New Orleans style jazz. The program lends itself well to incorporate some of my favorite dance moves and create fun dance combinations.",1236124800,13,2465,4.854761904761904
3763926,4,B001QD09Q0,"I really liked this DVD. First the menu interface lets you mix the order of the sections fairly effortlessly. But after a few watches, I had pretty much completed everything. But it really feels like a burlesque dance routine, not silly aerobics based on generic ""stripper"" moves like some of the other dvds out there. Overall I like it and I look forward to doing it, I just wish there was more of it.",1236124800,15,402,4.445945945945946

3763930,1,B001QD09Q0,I personally did not care for this lady. The instructions were boring and I'd rather get into the thick of it. At least it was inexpensive so I didn't lose allot of money. It was a bummer though.,1406851200,,195,4.157894736842105
3763931,3,B001QD09Q0,Not a very rivertting view. While it provided information it was basic and not as well presented as it could have been.,1400544000,,119,4.454545454545454
3763932,5,B001QD09Q0,This is a very sexy workout...truly enjoyed it. I love her pride in her sexuality and feel that it spills over into my own. This is a lot of fun!!!,1397865600,,147,3.933333333333333
3763933,2,B001QD09Q0,"I bought the whole Jo Weldon Burlesque series and I think liked this one the least. Although she is awesome with history, tips, info. and gorgeous costumes! ....the costumes are just beautiful. Unfortunately for me, the actual dance moves taught didn't seem very polished looking and when put together- it seemed kind of ametuerish. Also too, her persona, didn't carry over well for me, very monotone & flat-almost hard. Overall this one just didn't work for me. But I will say, I still think it's a good production and there is alot of valuable info. here that others might enjoy. I wish I could have given it a better review.",1388016000,3,627,4.709090909090909
3763934,4,B001QD09Q0,It was super easy to follow and fun but I was just a little surprised at how short choreography was in duration and how extra PG rated it was.,1386547200,,142,3.9310344827586206

3763937,4,B001QD09Q0,I love this DVD. As having no dance training and having an interest in burlesque this was perfect. She takes you step-by-step through the basics of the bump and grind. It was easy to follow and a great starting point.,1363046400,,217,4.45
3763938,5,B001QD09Q0,this cd is way too much fun.  i have learned wonderful moves and it is easy to follow.  great for self esteem,1355961600,,109,3.909090909090909

This dvd is exatly what i was looking for to have some basic informations on burlesque moves.
I like it!",1331596800,,137,4.3076923076923075
3763940,4,B001QD09Q0,"I have to say that I did love this DVD. Its fun change from my usual dance practice. Jo explains everything very well, from simple things like position and posture to more complicated things like tassel twirling. She even goes into detail about things like costuming, both buying and making your own.

My only reservation actually applies to a lot of World Dance New York videos - the combination walk-through is AFTER the combination demonstration. In order for me to see how smoothly I can put the combination together and see if I can keep up, I have to rewind the DVD. But its not an insurmountable issue.",1292803200,,609,4.638888888888889
3763941,1,B001QD09Q0,This dvd had some of the worse instruction. I found this one to be useless if you are trying to learn this type of dance. The info for the dvd is very misleading.,1288137600,3,162,3.9393939393939394
3763942,5,B001QD09Q0,"This is a wonderful ""foundation course"" for anyone wanting to learn about burlesque. She makes sure to include a lot of the basic burlesque moves that can be used to choreograph your own routine. She includes glove peels, bumps, grinds, different styles of walks, and really explains not only how to pull your bra strap down in a certain way, but WHY! If you're interested in performing burlesque, or just want to learn some things to spice up your relationship, this is a fabulous DVD!! I can't give it enough stars or a high enough review! :)

I've already bought her DVD ""Striptease"" and the Fan Dance DVD is next on my list! She's a wonderful teacher.",1287014400,,655,4.598290598290598
3763943,2,B001QD09Q0,"I think I was expecting something different with this.  Apparently, I did not really understand what burlesque is.  I love the Lady M exotic dance DVDs and thought I would like this as well, but I was very wrong. For me, Burlesque is a little too raunchy.  Having said that, if Burlesque is your thing, then this DVD is well made, her instructions are clear and she breaks it down so it is easy to learn.",1268697600,4,404,4.2894736842105265
3763944,5,B001QD09Q0,"Some dance videos aren't ideal for all body types. Jo Weldon's ""Honey and Spice"" is not one of these. This is a delightful and easy to follow overview of two distinctly different burlesque dances. Jo's instructional style is sassy without being brash or disrespectful. She encourages dancers to love their curves. The warmup is especially beautiful and easy to pick up, even for beginners to burlesque. The performances, demonstrations, step-by-step breakdowns accompany several costuming tips. The music is heavenly and not some of the overused, cheesy ""burlesque"" tunes you'd expect to hear in a cheap club. Jo gives a true touch of class to this beautiful, yet often misjudged dance style. Highly recommended for beginners and advanced dancers of all shapes and sizes! A true winner.",1263254400,2,786,5.246031746031746
3763945,5,B001QD09Q0,"When I became interested in Burlesque dance, it did not take me long to discover that the vast majority of the instructional DVDs on the subject use the term ""burlesque"" as code for ""modern strip tease.""  And while I certainly acknowledge that burlesque is often associated with feminine sexuality, I was not interested in cheesy stripper moves.

Fortunately, Jo provides us with exactly the style I was hoping for.  She is classy and subtle.  I appreciate her emphasis on the smallest details of preforming---how to interact with your audience using your eyes, or the flip of your hands.  At first glance, the DVD appears too easy for more experienced dancers, but my advice is to focus on the most subtle movements.  A little goes a long way, and you will be amazed at how much you can add to any dance style using techniques provided in this DVD.

The Honey routine requires the use of a boa and gloves as props.  I found that a common winter scarf will do in a pinch for learning purposes.

I recommend this DVD to anyone who is interested in preforming on stage, regardless of the style of dance you specialize in.  It will add flare and character, and you will ooze sexiness but still understated.  Enjoy!",1257465600,13,1211,4.63849765258216
3763946,5,B001QD09Q0,"There is no doubt at all that this must be one of the best Burlesque teach yourself dvd I have ever purchased. It has all the information you need in respect of burlesque dancing, said slowly so as to be completely assimilated. There is everything there including the clothes to wear, the music to choose. In fact everything, therefore if you are looking to start or continue learning Burlesque, please do not hesitate and go for this DVD.",1255824000,,439,4.641025641025641

I am older and hate to exercise.  I have a hard time following fast exercise routines that require strenuous movement.  Jo makes it easy to follow and fun.
