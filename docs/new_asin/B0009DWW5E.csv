8059196,5,B0009DWW5E,Connie is the best.  She's funny and an excellent teacher.  I think she has been living secretly in my house.,1419292800,,109,4.4
8059197,5,B0009DWW5E,"I bought this used on here and got the video with the black cover, so I'm not sure if there is a difference. Regardless, Connie Podesta is so very insightful it would be worth it to purchase this full price. She is also FUNNY- I laughed so hard, throughout. She has a real talent for helping viewers to understand *why* their own beliefs and actions contribute to their misery or happiness. She helps you to see how you can control the ways other people treat you. She talks about romantic relationships, parent-child and job relationships. Highly recommended.",1334016000,2,560,4.783505154639175
8059198,5,B0009DWW5E,"This book is all about how to basically have a better relationship with yourself and the other people around you. I've found it very helpful after reading it within a couple of days. It's funny, but serious when needed. Connie Podesta has a lovely voice in her writing. I absolutely love it. I've loved everybook I've read by her. Another one of my favorites is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Texting-Harry/dp/B005G843JU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Texting Harry</a>. It's a great book. I highly suggest everyone checks them out.",1313712000,,572,6.1625
8059199,3,B0009DWW5E,"Connie Podesta would probably be a great friend to have at one's local Toastmasters. She's funny. She's sharp.
She can speak. And she's entertaining. But here's my problem: I purchased this item in hopes of gaining some wisdom, insight and skills in the area of people skills. After all, the title suggests that her topic is something about difficulties with other people, doesn't it? Instead, her talk and message, as I hear it, is unfocused and filled with warmed-over cliches that have been floating around the self-help circuits for decades. Sure, I know that I have to get used to difficult people and laugh away my troubles, but how about something else besides 'just deal with it!'",1280880000,,688,4.888888888888889
