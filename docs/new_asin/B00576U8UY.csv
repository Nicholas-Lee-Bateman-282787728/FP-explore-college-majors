4593763,3,B00576U8UY,"For the record, I really enjoyed this anime but there is one major problem that need to be mentioned: There is no ending!  SPOILER ALERT!  The next to last episode ends with the main character fighting the main bad guy. Then in the middle of the fight the episode ends. The last episode follows 2 completely different characters who appeared earlier in the show. Then the episode ends and the end appears on screen. No resolution whatsoever. So while I enjoyed this anime I have to say if a complete and utter lack of an ending bothers you then proceed with caution.",1331078400,19,566,4.53921568627451

this to finish seeing it: UNFORTUNATELY like many videos and books THERE IS AN
OPEN ENDING...THAT IS: ""to be continued"" is the last line right before an OVA type
revealing of an old character's past; would have preferred 2 more disks and the END
of this series...THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE SET: THEY STILL NEED TO FINISH IT!!!

worth buying BUT expect no end in sight.",1443484800,2,540,4.56701030927835

The set was a great deal since in 2008 had first seen the series when FUNimation posted it up on Youtube and always thought it had a great unique story, superb animation (By Studio Gainax), and the soundtrack was amazing too considering its performed by angela. When you buy this the video quality is high too. Crisp and clear which included two extras of voice actor's commentary.

This a must-get dvd set.",1387756800,,488,4.879518072289157

Isn't that the standard that should be?  Did you enjoy it?  Not, if it is Oscar worthy or not.  Life is too short to be too narrow-minded.",1385510400,2,313,4.065573770491803

4593869,4,B00576U8UY,"This show has almost everything that is required, for what should be considered a good anime.  The show provides a generalized understanding as to the idea behind the main story as it begins.  The dead walk, but they only want one thing.  Human flesh!!!  Only one thing can stop these beings.  Shikibane Hime.  These women are looked down upon by their superiors, those from the Kogan Sect.  Monks are provided one per partner, better known as a ""contracted monk"".  Each monk becomes intuned spiritually with their Shikibane Hime and provides ""rune"" or life essence whenever they are injured.  The Shikibane Hime are indestructible,  unless there monk is killed.

 Only recently dead young women can become the saviors of mankind.  The story transgresses as the plot unfolds, new characters are introduced,  new enemies appear as well.

The main problem with this entire series is that there is no ending,  the audience or viewers are left hanging, with no idea how it ends.

I strongly recommend this if you enjoy good graphics,  bad ass fight scenes, semi-strong plot and the new concept about death and how it is used in this particular show.
Just don,t expect an ending",1383350400,19,1173,4.8979591836734695
4593870,1,B00576U8UY,"I am giving it 1 star for the box and the savings - but in terms of the movie itself....

I am halfway through disc 3 out of 4.

Story line:
- No character development. Well, the main character is in the process of hopefully maturing, but as i said, i am already halfway through disc 3 out of 4. If we are lucky he'll mature right in disc 4.
- Worse...every single character are 1 dimensional. They have 1 opinion as a character, and it stays so the whole movie. There are nothing interesting in any of the characters - they are all incapable of forming any other thoughts or opinions.

Logic:
None. There is no underlying logic to this story. These corpses are the way they are because they won't stay dead, unfinished business as such. Well, gee.
- You'd think there'd be more walking corpses out there. (Given that almost no one dies having finished their business on earth)
- No explanation for the abundance of female only heroines.
- No reason why there'd be multiple chances where the current major enemy could have been killed - but they wasted the chance by talking with the enemy instead. Or why this one super sniper manages to miss every single one of their target so far. OMG, frustrating. Its like every shot they shot is a warning shot.
- Also, apparently no one can kill these corpses but the corpse princesses. Ok, sure. Because they are immortal - unless you destroy their brain. Uh...what? Really? That simple? And you say only the corpse princess with her twin uzi can kill one of these? Not, i don't know, a normal guy with, say, twin uzis? or..rocket launcher? Seriously? And whats with the whole shooting monsters everywhere but their brain for a whole fight first? You'd think you'd learn its useless by now. Just shoot their brain from the get go, get it done already.

I can't recommend this to anyone who wants a little bit of logic to their stories.

If you want a good story line, go for deathnote or basilisk.",1382832000,4,1939,4.481586402266289

4593872,4,B00576U8UY,"Corpse Princess has an open ending, meaning you can be satisfied, but there is room for more. This is not a bad thing. The characters are interesting, thier stories are unique, and there are a few surprises that I didn't predict. I won't get in to the details, but some relationships I felt should have developed a bit more, or differently. Other than that, this series had it's moments where you find yourself whishing on behalf of the characters. This is a good example of drawing the viewer into the story. All in all, some wholsem entertainment and good family fun.",1377388800,,569,4.643564356435643
4593903,3,B00576U8UY,"It's been awhile since I've watched this anime so I decided to order. The show is great, but I'd advise you all not to purchase any kind of

""S.A.V.E"" Anime.

Why? Well, the video quality is lacking. I know the show is available in a higher quality, so I'm guessing the reason why this anime box set is cheaper is because of the lower video quality, hence the emphasized ""S.A.V.E"".

This is the first time I've ordered a ""S.A.V.E"" DVD, but I'm assuming they lower the quality in all the other anime DVDs.

Just something you should look out for if you decide on ordering a ""S.A.V.E"" anime DVD.

  I loved this series! The anime was good as I remember the first season. The thing I would advise is not to ship a twenty-five pound bag of rabbit food with this though the disks weren't harmed so the case did a great job of protecting them. The thing can say is that I wished this series had another season, or a movie,

4593912,3,B00576U8UY,I just finished the show and have mixed feelings.  Usually an anime will make me want more after its over but in the Corpse Princess I neither wanted more nor fast forwarded to to make the pain stop.  The artwork was good but not the best.  The story was interesting.  The series had more gore than I am used to and little fan service or humor.  The Corpse Princess was worth watching for the story but I don't think I would buy it to watch over and over.,1333497600,2,455,4.125

The part that really sticks in my craw is they had another episode to work with, and they totally went into an older side story with it. What a let down that was. I had a feeling things would turn out this way, The story kept putting the main two characters into deeper and deeper trouble. I guess I should have read some of the reviews first, but its alright.

I enjoy some anime but it must have well developed characters ( that don't do that open mouthed yell thing much) and some semblance of a plot.  This show had both.  I found myself interested in the characters and trying to figure out connections and motivations.  There was no sex and very little cursing, ( if you need that to make your show, then you lack a plot). At the end of the show, I found myself wondering if there wasn't more out there that was not in this set.  The only real drawbacks I found were at least two or three shows were dedicated to nothing but flashbacks of previous episodes.  Other then that I would recommend it for anyone over 12, ( yes there are gratuitousness boob shots, it is anime after all)",1468886400,,772,4.289655172413793
