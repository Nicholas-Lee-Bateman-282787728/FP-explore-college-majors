5886702,5,B00E21QTBC,The Gormonds are among my favorites among Ben's enemy which is why this is one of my favorite Ben 10 DVDs. With most of the episodes focus of the frog like aliens we have Ben doing everything  from protecting Vilgex from attack to having a crush on the frog princess when they invade the planet earth in all out war.,1387152000,2,316,4.266666666666667

8600365,5,B00E21QTBC,This was a really entertaining set for my son. This would be enjoyable for a young audience and bearable for the adults who care to watch too. Lots of laughs and exciting alien scenes.,1389398400,2,184,4.4411764705882355
8600366,5,B00E21QTBC,"My kids, especially my boys, are big Ben 10 fans, so this is perfect for us.  We can't find these DVDs at our local stores, so being able to purchase them at Amazon is awesome!  Plus, there is the added benefit of the children watching just the show and not commercials.

This revived series of Ben 10 is clever and has added several colorful characters to the original cast; Rook is one of the kids' favorite new characters.  When my children want me to watch this with them, I find it entertaining, too, whereas this is not the case with a good number of other children's shows.",1389052800,2,580,4.392523364485982
