2634153,4,B000HC2PLS,Acting and Historical facts are combined to create an enjoyable WWII movie.  Actors are unknown but pull the viewer into the movie with great acting skills.  The movie follows the book which is very well written.,1243641600,7,212,4.861111111111111
2634154,5,B000HC2PLS,Colditz is an actual Prisnor of War camp that existed during WWII. This story centers on a group of men who are determined to escape at all costs. Some are successful and this is the story of these men. Their loves are documented and the terrible betrayal of one to another outside the walls of the prison is unimaginable. I was almost sorry to see the 2 part mini series end as the acting and plot keet us in suspense for the entire time.,1238716800,78,439,4.238095238095238
2634155,5,B000HC2PLS,"I found this movie to be quite fascinating. There is a great cast of actors, mostly consisting of British actors considering the film is a British production.

The movie has a pretty good portrayal of what Colditz was like during the war, while having an interesting storyline.

This movie is a good mix of History and Drama. You learn about what Colditz was like, as well as an interesting storyline back on the homefront in England.

This movie is like, ""The Great Escape"" but with a British flare to it. So if you are a fan of escape and evade movies, then you will definitely enjoy this film.

Even though the movie didn't have the budget of some other WWII movies that come out of Hollywood, they sure made it look excellent. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.",1222300800,112,777,4.5285714285714285
2634156,3,B000HC2PLS,"First of all, any movie that includes Lawrence Fox is worth watching (I haven't seen him in anything I haven't liked, so far.); next, I found this well-acted two-part series absorbing from beginning to end. Damian Lewis is also excellent in the role of the charming rogue who almost gets away with his villainy.

The problem with the story, it seems to me, is that it couldn't quite make up its mind as to genre: Escape yarn? Love story? Murder mystery? Espionage thriller?  It is all of these, but, given the name of the film, I can see how anyone expecting the first might be disappointed, since the narrative passes so quickly over many of the riveting details of the great escape stories that emerged during the 1950s, which concentrated both on life in the camp and on the ingenuity of the prisoners in their plots to escape. The story of Colditz Castle, the impregnable prison camp where incorrigibly persistent officer-escapees of the allied forces were sent, is thrilling in its own right, and any film bearing the name, ""Colditz,"" deserves a treatment as thorough as the one it got, for instance, in the old film with John Mills and Eric Portman.

Perhaps, if the film had been given another name--and try as I might, I cannot think of one--it would be accepted as on its own merits, which given the high quality of the cast, which includes Timothy West, are considerable.",1217030400,8,1381,4.698347107438017
2634157,5,B000HC2PLS,My husband and I love history and he in particular has an interest in WW2 history.  Neither one of us knew of this prison camp.  The movie was entertaining and informative.  I would reccommend this movie to anyone who has similar interest.,1193443200,6,239,4.642857142857143
2634158,1,B000HC2PLS,"Other than the fact that it has many familiar and seriously up and coming British actors in it, there really isn't anything remarkable about this mini-series.  I remember hearing how British veterans were grumbling about this film and now I can see why: they were hoping that it would treat Colditz prisoners as earnestly as Band of Brothers treated the 101st Airbourne.  Heck, they even had two guys who in BoB playing major roles, but they were disappointed and for good reason.  This is a chick flick in the guise of a war flick, the same sort of stuff I remember them making in the 80's and 70's and before - Hanover Street, remember that?  This film goes right up that same alley, except one of the characters is so flawed that he stoops to villainy just to keep a girl.  Yep, those British veterans who spent time in Colditz had every reason to grumble.  Colditz was turned into a backdrop for a romance instead of truly going into what happened to the real veterans.  This is a mediocre script/film with a lot of talented people in it.",1190678400,48,1042,4.51063829787234
2634159,4,B000HC2PLS,"Colditz is a castle near Leipzig where during WW II the Nazis held Allied troops who were particularly at risk as escape artists.  Many of the men had escaped POW camps prior to their incarceration in the huge castle, and the man in charge of the prison warns every new inmate that the castle is impenetrable: there is no possibility of escaping and those who attempt will be killed.

The film begins in London 1939 as men are preparing to leave for the front.  Among them is a slightly naive but warmly human lad, Jack Rose (Tom Hardy) who has fallen in love with Lizzie (Sophia Myles), in a sweet, innocent union that represents the concept of 'the love we leave behind'. Jack leaves for duty with fellow soldiers Nicholas McGrade (Damian Lewis) and Tom Willis (Lawrence Fox) and soon they are captured by the Nazis and placed in a POW camp.  Of course, being cunning lads, they soon escape only to be captured again and sent to the ominous Colditz - all except Nick.  There they bond with men from home such as artist Sawyer (Guy Henry) and from other countries including France and Canada - among them Rhett Barker (Jason Priestly) who is a manipulator able to buy goods from Nazi guards including drugs to which he is addicted.

Nick is sent back to London where he meets Lizzie to tell her of Jack's safety. In time the two feel an attraction that proves to have fatal consequences because of Nick's obsession to have Lizzie to himself. Meanwhile the men in Colditz attempt multiple escapes only to be caught each time and put into solitary confinement.  The drive to escape is aided by all of the inmates and yet their efforts are thwarted by colleagues turned informers  for their own selfish needs.  Artist Sawyer does escape and is assigned in London with the Intelligence outfit with Nick: he learns that supposedly Jack has been reported as killed in action (a letter forged by Nick to gain access to Lizzie's emotions) and the remainder of the story concerns the end of the war, the release of the prisoners from Colditz, and the fatal schism between the returning Jack and his rival Nick over the love of Lizzie.

Director Stuart Orme manages to keep the pace of this over three hour long film, allowing the viewer to meet and understand and care about a very large cast of characters (writers Richard Cottan and Peter Morgan have created deft personalities).  Filmed in London and the Czech Republic the atmosphere is correctly captured and the large cast of characters includes many very fine cameos.  If there is a single message to summarize a complex story, it is the old adage 'brothers in arms, rivals in love'. This made for television miniseries is well acted and is another opportunity to see the background stories of World War II.  Recommended viewing.

2634194,5,B000HC2PLS,"I gave this 5 starts, realizing it is a fictionalized version of this POW camp.  However, history confirms that the camp was a specialized camp (with only two ways in or out) specifically used for POWs with a history of escape.  Yet despite that, the Germans had poor success in containing the prisoners.  And I expect, although fictionalized there is some basis in truth to the escape attempts, just as I have no doubt that a few prisoners cooperated with the Germans for their own reasons..  Having said that, the acting is superb.  Damien Lewis plays the Irish rogue who did not want to be in the army, and is both charmingly sympathetic (at first) yet ultimately pathological.  Another strong performance is Laurence Fox (whose father is also in the film) who is one of the most determined in escaping, whille trying to keep his sanity.  Another surprise performance was given by Jason Priestly as the Canadian POW.

 If you are looking for total historical accuracy, you may feel disappointed, but for that you can always research Colditz by the interest hopefully piqued by this film.  But for a fictionalized drama of what the camp was about (with a secondary and diabolical love triangle story nicely played out and does not ruin the tragedy of war), you won't be disappointed by compelling performances.  I expect that whatever was written as to characterizations for this film, may be a composite of truth with the added fictionalized drama.  Unfortunately, film always has time constraints that cannot portray the complete story (as a book can), but it can spark interest and for that reason it is an important film.  So, for strong performances with a historical background (some of which probably was accurate (but collapsed), noting as to how the Germans treated ""safe"" houses and the occupants), this would be a good choice and I recommend it.

Incidentally, though the Germans considered this the most secure POW prison because of its limited access, it had the highest rate of successful escapes.",1472774400,2,2013,4.9171597633136095

2634201,2,B000HC2PLS,"The Colditz story has continued to exert a fascination over film and television audiences ever since the end of World War II. Guy Hamilton's 1955 film THE COLDITZ STORY had John Mills as Captain P. R. Reid planning an escape from the fortified jail and successfully doing so despite the attentions of over zealous German prison guards. In 1972 I remember the BBC series COLDITZ with a stellar cast including Robert Wagner, Edward Hardwicke, Jack Hedley and the late Anthony Valentine turning in a memorable performance as the sadistic Major Mohn, one of the German prison officers.

Sadly Stuart Orme's 2005 miniseries does not even come close to the standards set by the previous adaptations of the tale. The tale oscillates from Colditz to London, and involves a tangled romance between Nicholas McBride (Damian Lewis with an incomprehensible Scottish accent) and Lizzie Carter (Sophia Myles). There are the usual regimental stereotypes (Tom Hardy, Laurence Fox), plus a benevolent senior officer based in London (James Fox). There is also a boffin improbably portrayed as an homosexual by Timothy West.

Peter Morgan and Richard Cottan's screenplay plods on to an inevitable conclusion, with most sequences taking place in darkened rooms either in the prison or in the offices of a branch of the Secret Service in London. The German officers are predictably sadistic ('ALLO 'ALLO has a lot to answer for in this context) while the United Nations of prisoners in the camp find it difficult to co- exist. The drama is engaging enough, but one wonders why anyone actually bothered to remake the story in the first place.",1451347200,,1620,5.063670411985019

2634207,2,B000HC2PLS,"As long as you understand ahead of time that this 2 part mini-series has NOTHING TO DO with actual historical events, then go ahead & purchase. The acting isn't bad, especially the small parts. The Brits have a wonderful way of taking a minor part and making it shine. (""There are no small parts, only small actors."") The story, however, is pathetic. Just another '2 guys in love with the same girl' cliche that goes back to the 1920s. I remember in particular a Clark Gable-Wallace Beery thing about 2 sailors in a rivalry over a waitress. One of them dies, but I can't remember which one... But I digress.
My problem with a show like this is that it exhibits enormous disrespect for the actual historical characters by ignoring their stories in favor of a  bunch of lifeless cliches. ""Escape from Colditz"" was one of the first 'war books' I ever bought (it cost 35 cents, which tells you how long ago) & I read it several times, along with its follow-up ""Men of Colditz"". The author, P.R. Reid, was one of the few men to actually escape from Colditz castle and make it all the way back to Britain. There was a movie made of those books, ""The Colditz Story"" -- if I remember correctly -- starring John Mills. It was a good one. British, I'm sure. Try and track it down: your local library, inter-library loan, etc. Read the book; also Eric Williams's, ""The Wooden Horse"" book & movie. And, of course, ""The Great Escape"" -- movie still worth watching, book even better. ""TGE"" is more authentic, tho the characters, except for a couple, are composites. The author, Paul Brickhill, was a POW himself. The script was by James Clavell, who wrote ""Shogun"", but also ""King Rat"" about HIS prison camp experiences with the Japanese. That's another movie worth tracking down and watching again. If you are really into prison camp pictures, try to find ""One day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich"" -- novella by Solzhenitsyn. For an authentic Gulag experience.

Forget this drivel.",1439942400,2,1967,4.649425287356322
2634208,4,B000HC2PLS,"Colditz is one of the most legenedary prisoner-of-war camps in all of history, let alone the Second World War. Several movies and TV miniseries have been done about it, and this 2005 entry is the latest.

The planners behind this rendition of the subject decided to split the focus between the actual PoW camp and the overlooked but critical efforts of MI9, the British secret agency that provided support, training, and equipment to would-be escapers. MI9 shipped concealed escape supplies to POWs, operated ""rat-lines"" to help them get out of occupied Europe, debriefed returning PoWs, and trained and equipped Allied airmen on what to do if captured, or better yet, how to avoid capture in the first place.

With this as one source of drama, the other is the camp itself, the legendary castle in Saxony, where the Germans concentrated their most annoying PoWs in a theoretically ""escape-proof"" prison, and they went out and made numerous and occasionally highly successful escapes anyway.

PoW escape stories always entertain readers and movie viewers -- they make for high drama and tension, along with a good deal of personal struggle -- escaper versus camp commandant -- and a fair amount of comedy. They're more human than arrows on a map, and more direct. The nature of the adventures are often highly compelling.

This movie has a good dose of G.A. Henty-type escape adventure, but the writers decided that the MI9 guys and the Colditz guys needed a greater dramatic connection than London boffins supplying public schoolboy escapers with concealed compasses and maps. So they tacked on a strange love triangle, with Damien Lewis at the center of it, as a man who escapes Colditz, returns to England, gains a commission, and works for MI9. Thus promoted and empowered, he proceeds to romance and steal the girlfriend of his pal still trapped back in Colditz. Doing so naturally requires him to murder another Colditz escapee and dump the body in the Thames, try to desert the British Army, and take the girl with him. I found that whole portion of the movie somewhat irritating (and one of two reasons why I dropped the rating from five to four). That was not one of the historic features of Colditz.

When dealing with the PoWs and MI9 operations, the film is on safer and more familiar ground -- PoWs using all kinds of wiles and skullduggery to figure out escape routes and how to capitalize on them, while also trying to survive in a prison with an endless and indefinite sentence. It's enough t make a man go mad, and one PoW does just that, and dies as a result. Less impressive is Jason Priestley as a Royal Canadian Air Force officer who rats out his buddies to support his drug addiction. Such a situation did not actually exist in Colditz, either.

The Germans did insert a traitor into Colditz, a merchant seaman and adherent of Sir Oswald Mosley named Walter Purdy, who promptly aroused the suspicions of the Senior British Officer. Purdy was interrogated by another PoW, Canadian Col. Cecil Merritt, who had earned a Victoria Cross at Dieppe, and therefore had no tolerance for traitors, and Purdy broke down. The British told the Germans they could not answer for his safety, and Purdy was sent back to Berlin two weeks after arriving at Colditz, to resume his day job of doing broadcasts for Lord Haw-Haw. Purdy did prison time after the war.

Other characters are fictionalized versions of real people. The British officer who dies is based on Lt. Mike Sinclair, a determined escaper, who finally simply climbed over a fence one day, and was shot dead. Another escape is based on real attempt to do so, where the escaper disguised himself as the camp electrician. The real attempt didn't do well.

Folks who are uninitiated to the World War II-PoW escape genre will find this an interesting introduction to the field, and may go on to do further study on both MI9 and Colditz, and learn the fascinating facts and history behind the movie, and they should. The facts were better than this fiction. For example, the French PoWs, despite being conquered and shamed, were determined to resist, taunting the Germans at every opportunity, and building a very clever tunnel in the chapel. The Dutch relied on disguised escapers and wax dummies at later roll calls to fool the Germans. The Poles offered language skills and sheer hatred of the Germans. The British Commonwealth PoWs, making up the bulk of the prisoners, came up with all kinds of clever ideas to irritate the Germans -- politely.

Missing are the final desperate days at Colditz, when the camp, its PoWs (which included some pretty prominent people being used as possible bargaining chips), and its guards, were surrounded by SS units and violent battles, and all inside needed to find ways to survive. One of them was creation of a glider to fly out of the castle and to advancing American lines, to let the 69th Infantry Division know the castle was full of PoWs. The glider never flew. But the idea that did fly was the PoWs taking over the camp, so that they could be liberated.

Interestingly, a team of aeronauts recently built a replica of the glider from period materials, launched it into English airspace, and it successfully flew!

There are a number of holes in this PoW drama, but it's a good but mostly fictional introduction to the story of Colditz.",1439856000,,5348,4.802173913043478

Some time is given to the soldiers in prison and their escape attempts, but not much story time revolves around the prison , the conditions soldiers faced, or character development. The plot development is awful, and most scenes seem added on, as in, ""oh, we have to make a scene work so let's do this so it sort of makes sense"".  Everything scene seems added on, and is a major disappointment because the plot line is so ridiculous. Oh, I didn't mention the ending of the film. Impossible doesn't  do justice to the absurd story line and incredible ""plot development"" that never really occurs.

2634294,4,B000HC2PLS,"The 2005 Grenada Television mini-series ""Colditz"" revisits the World War II escape genre with an outstanding cast and a hard-eyed look at the realities of the war.  Damian Lewis, Sophia Myles, Tom Hardy, Laurence Fox, and Jason Priestly put on a terrific show as very human people caught up in the crushing pressures of the war.

As the story opens, three British soldiers escape from a German POW camp and make their way to the Swiss border.  The attempt to cross goes badly; only one man makes it out.  The escapee, a reluctant and cynical soldier, is sent to London to join MI-9, the secret POW escape organization.  To his surprise, he finds a purpose in his work, and a reason to live and love with the young lady left behind by one of his fellow escapees.  When developments in the war threaten his new-found status, he will be tested...

His two fellow escapees, consigned to the high security prison at Colditz Castle, will stubbornly continue to plot escape attempts with their multi-national inmates.  The desperate grind of POW life, many failed attempts, and German brutality, will wear down their spirit.  More than one man will be crushed by the burden; another will carry it half-way across Europe to save his dream.

""Colditz"" doesn't market happy endings.  The suspense of the second half is overladen with a sense that things aren't going to work out for everyone.  The ending is as melodramatic as a coffin lid coming down.  However, the acting and production values are quite good and ""Colditz"" is highly recommended as compelling drama.",1334016000,,1557,4.830188679245283
2634295,2,B000HC2PLS,"Not that good. The acting was good with a host of stars in the early part of their career, but the storyline of repeated escape attempts was kind of silly. Basically, the prisoners were given ample room to walk around the castle, do what they want, and attempt to escape. The only punishment to scare them from trying was a month in the hole. Was this a real story? I find it hard to believe a prison designed specifically for the ""best escape artists"" would give their prisoners so much freedom.

2634301,5,B000HC2PLS,"From earlier reviewers I KNEW this to be fiction based on a real place, a real time, with some factors of truth driving the drama. Thus, I was able to watch for pure entertainment value, realizing this is not historical documentation. As entertainment for a war story it's great. Not the typical soldier story since this is a WWII prison camp (Colditz did exist). Also a bit of romance since most soldiers had a girl back home (or wanted one.)

Truth is the real Colditz was used as a high security prison for soldiers considered a high risk of escape or had already tried at least once prior. That provided an interesting mix of nationalities mingling. And a ready supply of soldiers unwilling to wait out the war's end, always seeking a way out. The situation in reality and in drama creates a delightful field of conflict between those inside and those holding the prisoners. That is the story here, the characters, different types of men, which kind would fight from the inside, and who would be willing to wait. It that way this miniseries was hugely successful.

Characters drive the show. Who can keep from hating Cpl/Lt McGrade (Damian Lewis) by the time he does his dastardly work on the home front? Who can't help but cheer the continual attempts and determination of Tom (Laurence Fox)? Rhett (Jason Priestly) is happy waiting and getting all he can for himself. Jack (Tom Hardy) dreams of his love, Lizzie (Sophia Myles) a hot babe doing her part back on the home front.

The escape attempts are continuous, and suspenseful as you really don't know who will make it out. Some do, some don't. With all the ways the real prisoners tried to escape, I am surprised this miniseries was only a 2-parter. So sit back and know these are fictional characters, but guys doing what the real soldiers did behind the Colditz walls.

Not used on the TV drama, but reality, was a glider built in the attic. The soldiers were rescued before the glider escape attempt was given a test.
An entertaining WWII POW drama.
The only negative I found was the lack of subtitles.
Some photo documentation for the real Colditz would also have been nice.
But this is a value, lots of war drama for a small price.",1304726400,6,2196,4.623076923076923
2634302,3,B000HC2PLS,"""Colditz"" held my attention. My biggest complaint: no English language subtitles. Most of the characters speak in a very thick British or Irish accent that was at times very difficult for my American ear to comprehend. I'm not complaining about the actors' accent; the fault lies with the person who decided not to include English language subtitles. (There are Spanish subtitles.)

Compounding this problem is the musical score, which is so loud it often overwhelms the dialog.

These two factors combined caused me to miss probably 20% to 30% of the dialog.",1303257600,18,559,5.065217391304348
2634303,3,B000HC2PLS,"This review will focus on the quality of the Blu ray disc, since the plot and performances were reviewed by everyone else. The image quality is equal (perhaps slightly above) to an upscaled DVD. Do not expect the crisp image of a recent big screen movie, you will be disappointed. The colors may be a bit more intense than a DVD, but the sharpness leaves a lot to be desired. Obviously this is a made-for-tv miniseries, but still. There are no extras whatsoever, no chapters, not even a trailer or subtitles (which makes Damian Lewis' character a bit hard to understand at times, since he speaks with a heavy Irish accent). In conclusion, this is a decent movie on a poor Blu ray disc. For under $10 though, it's worth a buy if you like WWII/prison dramas.",1294099200,10,756,4.525547445255475
2634304,5,B000HC2PLS,"I'm a huge Damian Lewis fan since the TV series, ""Life,"" and he delivered in this movie.  What I wasn't expecting were the excellent performances of Laurence Fox, Sophia Myles, and Jason Priestly (the occasional comic relief in an otherwise tense situation) and the rest of the cast.  The story line had you pulling for both Lt. McGrade and 2nd Lt. Rose even though they were on a collision course.  The plot also had you holding your breath during each escape attempt.  Sophia Myles did a wonderful job of relaying what was going on in the home front.  Laurence Fox is, as usual, wonderful in his role.  I would definitely recommend this film.  It has a faint flavor of ""The Great Escape"" mixed in with a tiny bit of  ""Pearl Harbor"" romance.  The action scenes of the London bombings were tremendous, giving you a feeling of the terror it's inhabitants must have felt during the war.",1279843200,7,884,4.615384615384615

 I find it sacriligious to base a romantic drama on what was one of the most notorious German POW camps, as to why they did this, begggars belief,when the actual true life adventures of life in Colditz,  are far more interesting.
  As to the portrayal of the Germans brutal treatment of the prisoners is a total fabrication, it was quite the contrary.

2634308,2,B000HC2PLS,"During World War II, Colditz, an elevated castle near Leipzig, Germany, was converted to a high security prison for Allied prisoners with a propensity for escaping.  With specialists in evasion and escape gathered together, Colditz was usually abuzz with those planning and preparing to escape.  Colditz (2005), is a World War II miniseries for Granada British TV, centered around the activities of Allied officers held captive in the formidable castle.  Based in part on the book Colditz: The Untold Story of World War II's Great Escapes (2001), by Henry Chancellor, this production uses some elements from history, to construct a background, and then interjects a rather sordid tale of betrayal, deceit, murder, and treason.

Captain Tom Willis (Laurence Fox), Lieutenant Jack Rose (Tom Hardy), and Corporal Nicholas McGrade (Damian Lewis), British escapees from a German POW camp, are trying to reach safety in neutral Switzerland.  Willis and Rose are caught attempting to cross the border, but McGrade escapes to Switzerland.  Before separating, Jack asks Nick to deliver a message to his girl, Lizzie Carter (Sophia Myles).  Willis and Rose are sent to Colditz, while McGrade earns the distinction of being the first British POW to successfully escape from Germany.  Promoted to lieutenant, he is assigned to `M.I.9' a (fictitious) division of Britain's secret service, working in London in a section specializing in POW affairs.

Aided by Canadian flying officer Rhett Barker (Jason Priestly), Willis and Rose immediately attempt to escape from Colditz, crawling into the drainage system.  It is a tight claustrophobic journey, where you can almost feel the cold wet walls, pressing in.  Their failure, earns them their first of many stays in solitary confinement.  When released, Jack gets Captain Edward Sawyer (Guy Henry), an artist, to draw a small portrait of Lizzie.

Keeping his promise, McGrade meets with Lizzie, but things get complicated, when he begins to take an interest in Lizzie, who remains loyal to Jack.  Matters take a very dark turn, when McGrade falsifies a report stating that Rose has been killed while trying to escape.  Taking advantage of a heartbroken Lizzie, Nick begins to cultivate a romance.

Captain Sawyer becomes the second to escape from Colditz and reach England.  He too is assigned to M.I.9, and becomes suspicious, upon discovering that Rose's girl, has taken up with Lt. McGrade.  Sawyer soon puts the pieces together, and sends a letter to Rose, explaining the situation.  Upon learning the truth, Rose makes an unauthorized escape (screwing his friend Willis), looking to settle up with naughty Nicky McGrade.

Colditz, does a decent job of capturing some of the favor of the war, including the blitz( bombing) of London, conditions in Colditz, and the unique spirit of those dedicated to proposition of escape.  While doubtless dramatized, there is some accuracy in the methods and means employed to escape.  Even the most successful film in the genre, The Great Escape (1963), embellished the truth for entertainment purposes.  While you can't fault the writers for adding some drama, making McGrade an opportunist, who transforms into the worst kind of scheming lowlife, is very questionable.  McGrade completely dishonors the tradition of the British Army, soiling the memory of those who sacrificed much for their country.  Adding further dishonor, the story also features drug abuse, betrayal, treason, and number of questionable deaths.

During the Battle of Britain, England stood alone against the forces of Germany, with the Luftwaffe attacking by day, and bombers striking at night, in an attempt to bring the country to its knees.  Winston Churchill spoke of the country's resolve to persevere in these very grim times, when he said, "". . . we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.  We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields, and in the streets.  We shall fight in the hills.  We shall never surrender.""  This indomitable spirit, is what the British are renown for.  Former British POW's like Paul Brickhill (The Great Escape), Patrick Reid (The Colditz Story), and Eric Williams (The Wooden Horse), all wrote books (that later became movies) expressing this same quiet determination.  That a British company produced this miniseries, is a quite remarkable statement of how much times have changed.

Because few today are familiar with the actual events at Colditz, the screenplay by Richard Cottan and Peter Morgan, is not generally regarded as being in questionable taste.  Suppose that someone wrote a screenplay about the 9/11 tragedy, where a first responder entered the World Trade Center towers, and instead of trying to rescue people, became a looter and a killer.  That story might be viewed as insensitive, and inflammatory by many Americans.  However thirty years from now, people may not feel the same way.  Something similar, seems to have happened regarding Colditz.

Although the story is rather controversial, the pieces do fit together pretty well.  The 184 minute miniseries devotes almost no time to the German captors, or the 'underground' that aided prisoners, but there are few slow moments.  Damian Lewis (Band of Brothers) gives a strong performance, going from hero, to an utter cad.  Sophia Myles (Outlander), who looks like a Kate Winslett clone, is very sympathetic.  Tom Hardy (Layer Cake), manages to get through it all, but doesn't come across as obvious hero material.  Those primarily interested in a wartime romance may appreciate this drama, but those concerned with showing some regard for past sacrifices, may find that the story takes too many liberties to be very palatable.  There was talent and potential here, but some very unfortunate choices were made.",1268611200,13,5828,5.219354838709678

The only one I remember who was in it was David Mc Callium from the Man from Uncle.  Charles Bronsan may have, I do know they were together in The Great escape.  I would love to find this orignal.  I hope this version is near as good.",1262649600,2,531,3.8333333333333335
2634311,2,B000HC2PLS,"Having read the story of Colditz many times, I can attest to the loose adherence to the truth in this film, but that is okay. The acting is excellent, cinematography good to excellent, props and costume excellent, plus more.

However the storyline as regards Damian Lewis's character (which is dominant)- Nicholas McGrade - is pathetic. McGrade is a tongue-in-cheek rebel who stabs a friend in the back through his selection of a lover. If you detest stories, as I do, that will provide you with a morally coherent ending but drag you through the sewer for hours before you reach that point, than avoid this flick.

To give the reader just some idea of what I am referring to, at one point in this story, McGrade exposes the beautiful and innocent character played by Sophia Myles - Lizzie Carter - to a Nazi air-raid, rather than seek nearby shelter, and leads her to a burning building in which women and children are perishing, in order to illuminate her mind to the alleged reality that she (Carter) and he (McGrade) are uniquely blessed to be living life at such an intense level. Only an immature person could conceive of screenplay in which it is supposed that Londoners - any of them worth writing about - were rejoicing about the so called excitement of witnessing friends and neighbors perishing in The Blitz.

Do yourself a favor, reject this movie and read the book instead.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ESCAPE-FROM-COLDITZ/dp/B0026O53PA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ESCAPE FROM COLDITZ</a>",1260057600,33,1540,5.22672064777328

(UK - 2004)

Aspect ratio: 1.78:1
TV soundtrack: Dolby Digital

A desperate POW (Tom Hardy) plots escape from Colditz after learning that a former inmate (Damian Lewis) has returned to London and stolen Hardy's fiance (Sophia Myles).

Lively addition to the 'heroes of WWII' subgenre, filmed on location in London and the Czech Republic, and directed with cinematic flair by Stuart Orme (THE PUPPET MASTERS). Richard Cottan's screenplay (co-written with Peter Morgan, based on the book by Henry Chancellor and the 2000 TV series ""Escape from Colditz"") cross-cuts between events at Colditz castle - where Hardy and fellow inmate Laurence Fox (DEATHWATCH) hatch multiple escape plans, only to be thwarted by a combination of bad luck and reckless bravado - and the less-interesting relationship which develops between Lewis and Myles, though the two plot threads merge neatly for a melodramatic finale.

Lewis gives the showiest performance, playing a selfish character whose charming demeanor masks a propensity for greed and violence, though Hardy and Fox are suitably intense in crucial supporting roles. James Fox (father of Laurence) and Timothy West make extended cameo appearances as senior members of MI9, while former teen heartthrob Jason Priestley plays a Canadian POW whose burgeoning drug habit pays lethal dividends. Fine cinematography and production values.

Originally produced for British TV and screened in two parts.",1255132800,,1443,5.506787330316742

2634315,5,B000HC2PLS,"For those of you who own The Great Escape, starring Steve McQueen and a cast of international stars, Colditz will seem to be covering the same ground. Au contraire!
In the former, the story is character-driven (who can forget McQueen and his baseball?) while in the latter the story is plot-driven. The two main characters, Damian Lewis and Tom Hardy -- and a wonderful supporting performace by Laurence Fox -- are wonderful in their roles.  The main plot lies in the relationship among the two men and a woman. When the Lewis character escapes successfully and looks up Hardy's girlfriend to report he is safe. Lewis falls in love with her and schemes to win her for himself. How he does this is cunning and obsessive and brutal -- and I am not going to spoil this part for you. He is a communist, as his dialogue shows, and he hates the war, the class he is in, and his hope that the war will cause England and its class system to fail. He is working class tough and has a temper that kills. Hardy is in the Queen's Guard and his love is in the same class as he is. He, too, obsesses over her and the picture he carries with him everywhere. Lewis is made a lieutenant after he escapes and he preens before mirrors. But Hardy is already a commissioned officer and this grates on Lewis from the start.
For a war film, there is virtually no blood and gore, and the tension of the failed escapes is a bit overshadowed by the tension of the three lovers. I thought the escape attempts were exciting and Jason Priestly  very good as the rat in the camp.

Some have said this film is historically inaccurate and my response is that if that sort of thing bothers you, watch a documentary. I wish the mini-series had been longer so as to expand on some of the brilliant ideas for the ""tools"" of the British secret service. But again, this is not a war movie but  a suspenseful love story set against the war and is wonderfully entertaining. Both sexes will find something to excite them in this film.",1252454400,6,1993,4.392953929539296
