619207,5,6303269869,"When I first saw the title of this movie, I was thinking that this was  going to be a romantic comedy.  But, to my surprise, it was so much more.
Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia are good as Alice and Michael Green.  I liked  the fact that the movie dealt with Alice's alcoholism.  She realizes that  she has a major problem with alcohol.  Eventually, she goes into  rehabilitation.
I'm glad that they didn't stop the movie with her coming  out of rehab and life will be all wonderful and fuzzy.  What happens is  that with Alice sober, Michael doesn't have anyone to rescue anymore.  It  is good to watch how their relationship changes with Alice's new found  sobriety.  Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia do a great job in showing how  alcoholism can effectively mess up a relationship and family.
It's been  a while since I have seen this movie, but there are some wonderful  supporting performances to mention.  Tina Majorino as the oldest daughter,  Jess, is astonishing.  She shows a lot of emotion for the daughter of an  alcoholic.  I think that she could have easily been nominated for a Best  Supporting Actress Oscar.
Also, Lauren Tom as Amy, the Green's  nanny/housekeeper, is incredible.  Her character does not really like  Michael Green very much.  The scene where Michael begs her to come back and  help the family is great.  Amy definitely does not make it easy for  him.
This movie is definitely not light-hearted fair.  In fact, I would  really not recommend this for children.  But, for adults, I recommend this  movie because it tackles alcoholism head on, especially with some not so  pleasant views of Alice's alcoholism.",965779200,81,1626,4.723021582733813
619208,2,6303269869,"Even though Meg Ryan does an excellent and credible job, I thought Andy Garcia was a dud.  First let me say that if you cannot relate to a rehab situation, this film is uncomfortable to watch.  Most dissapointing was  that I did not believe that the speech Andy Garcia's character gave at the  end (that made Meg Ryan's character as his wife apparently return to him)  had any substance to convince Meg that he really ""got it"" in  terms of her struggle.  The scene at the marriage counselor had some  promise but then it ended too soon and was not revisited.  Again that scene  was great for Meg's character but did not do much for sphinx-face Andy.  Also, supporting characters, aside from a few short moments at the rehab  center were weak and uninteresting.  Bottom line, if you come from a sober  family, don't bother watching this flick.",956016000,,842,4.601351351351352
619209,5,6303269869,THIS MOVIE SHOWS HOW AN ALCOHOLIC WILL NOT ONLY HURT HIMSELF (OR HERSELF) BUT HOW HIS OR HER ALL ENTOURAGE WILL BE HURT. WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THE FACT THAT BEING ALCOHOLIC WAS SHOWN AS BEING A SICKNESS.  IT IS  SIMPLY THE STORY OF A SICK WOMAN (A SICK HUMAN BEING) TRYING TO GET BETTER  WITH THE HELP OF HER LOVELY HUSBAND WHO DOES NOT KNOW EVERYTHING ECEPT THAT  HE LOVES HIS WIFE.,955929600,,393,4.131578947368421
619210,4,6303269869,Andy Garcia&Meg Ryan have Real Chemistry in this film about an Abusive Problem.which is Alcohol.it is done very well by Meg Ryan who I'm that Big a Fan of but she is very convincing here. Andy Garcia is a Very Underrated  Actor. He does a Good job here as well. Alcolism is a very Serious  Problem&Condition that effects alot of People and it's Important too  see it being dealt with and The Impact it can have on the Lives around it.,955152000,,434,4.333333333333333
619211,5,6303269869,I love this movie! Every time I watch it I feel so many more emotions than the time before. Watching it with someone you care about makes the movie even more realistic and heartbreaking. I watched it again recently and by  the end both my boyfriend and I were crying. Their relationship was so real  it made us open up to each other more than ever before.,920851200,,355,4.2835820895522385

619563,5,6303269869,"Great movie....I actually have been using this movie for years as a counselor, assigning people to watch it so that they can understand how alcoholism affects the entire family. It shows the perspective of the alcoholic, who feels shame and guilt, and yet is in denial as to the seriousness of their illness. It shows the difficulties presented when they try to stop drinking and a fair representation of AA. It shows how significant others unwittingly ""enable"" or punish their loves ones, and how their lives can become as unmanageable as the alcoholic's in all their varied attempts to try to ""get them to quit"", and finally how Al anon can help them, as they are ALSO in need of help. IT shows how children are so seriously affected when a parent is impaired, and the dangers of drinking too much. A heart breaking story, but with a wonderful ending that shows the capacity of families to heal.  A great tool to use in alcohol or drug counseling for both the alcoholics to watch,a s well as their loved ones.",1482710400,,1011,4.616666666666666

619983,5,6303269869,"This is the best movie that Luis Mandoki ever made so far!!!
He made great movies like <WHITE PALACE> about an upper class young man falling in love with an older woman who works for a restaurant, and <Message in a bottle> a news writer falling in love with a man who sent a message in a bottle and faire passer into the sea  to the dead wife. Also his great work about kids suffering from war <INNOCENT VOICES> is great too. This movie is dedicated to his motherland.
I didn't even know this movie exist so far and was lucky that I found out from amazon in such a cheap price.
I was so surprised watching this film last night how well made this is and so happy after finish watching it!
I had a high doubt about Meg Ryan acting as an alcoholic since she is only good at romantic comedy.
But I was wrong. The director is a legendary melodrama director Louis Mandoki. He really controlled well with Meg and he did succeeded wonderfully!
It was a little (very little) bit cheesy watching the ending but was beautiful and I don't know I can ever forget it.
Also the kids are so beautiful and so cute. He is master of controlling the kids as well.
They are so adorable. They made the movie more shine especially the first daughter.
Andy Carcia was really amazing.  I had no doubt about him from the beginning. I first noticed him from the movie <Untouchables>. He was a great actor from the beginning.
I hope Louis will make more movie like this in the future and I will looking forward to seeing it soon.

PS: I shouldn't  forget to mention the original music score. The music was composed by the legendary musician Zbigniew Preisner who worked a lot with the director Krzysztof Kieslowski such as <Double life of Veronuque><Blue><Red><White><Dekalogue>
The music boosted the movie and truely made the film even more greater. IT embrased and upheaved the already well made film.",1452470400,,1875,4.5058823529411764

620102,3,6303269869,"This was an amazing movie, but some things bothered me about the story.

I really love Meg Ryan, but she was totally the wrong actress for this movie.
She is so much better at comedy than drama.
She was totally unbelievable as an alcoholic hitting rock bottom. She looked too good and too healthy.

I had no idea what this movie was about until I played it.
By the title, I expected a romantic comedy, and especially because Meg Ryan was in it.
I expected this movie to be about a man who meets and woman and they fall in love, etc.etc. or something like that.

Contains some spoilers...

Alice obviously had a drinking problem for a very long time. Her daughters were ages 4 (Casey) and 8 (Jess). She said that she left her ""baby girl"" in a store because she was so drunk that she just forgot her there. So, if her youngest is 4, she had to have a problem for at least 4 years to be talking about her baby. Unless she was talking about her 8 year old as a baby, which of course, would make her problem go back even further. It is never said why her first marriage ended. It was mentioned that the first husband calls Jess (their daughter) only about once a year.  Did Alice's first marriage end because of her drinking?

Besides not discussing anything about Alice's first marriage, everything else about her past is not discussed. It is briefly mentioned that her father was an alcoholic. Her mother was obviously, at the least, verbally abusive, by saying that her husband needed to feel useful, and by saying that she will get Alice's house clean for a change, and by Jess saying that she did not like the way that her grandmother treated her mother, and by the way that Jess so strongly did not want to stay with her grandmother. But there was no backstory on exactly how long Alice had a drinking problem or how it started. Were her parents even informed that she went into rehab?

Alice hits rock bottom by ending up in the hospital and then going directly into rehab. She is released and continues with AA.  I was waiting for some kind of relapse, or an almost relapse, maybe her calling her sponsor at least.  But Alice goes into rehab, gets sober, and stays sober. She definitely struggled (by becoming a chain smoker, and by turning to another man, as it was clear that she was getting way too close to the blonde guy from rehab) but just how hard it was to stay sober was not detailed enough in the movie.

Did Alice lose her job because of her drinking?
She was working full-time, then she goes into rehab, and we never hear about her working after that.
Did she keep her job without any consequences?
Michael definitely had problems with his job, and almost got fired, because of Alice's drinking.

I didn't like anything about the way that Michael handled Alice's problem. Mostly, I thought that he didn't take it all seriously enough. He didn't take the couples therapy seriously.  Michael claimed that he had no idea that Alice was an alcoholic, and he just thought that she had ""pressures,"" and he even asked her how he did not see it.  But he absolutely did see it, with little comments like all that Alice could handle with her hangover was ""her coffee and her little spoon"",  by catching her locking herself out of the house in the middle of the night, by saving her from almost drowning in their rowboat in Mexico, by her staying out so late in a bar that he had to miss going to work, and from the very beginning when she threw eggs on someone's car in the middle of the night. When Alice called Michael from rehab, he was really insensitive by joking about sex instead of simply asking how she was doing and what he could do to help. Alice asked Michael if he ever wondered what she talked about in her AA meetings because she could feel that he just didn't care enough.  It bothered me that Michael left Alice after she got sober instead of while she was drinking. And even more strange was that he moved far away and left the children with a recovering alcoholic. He presented himself as a good husband and father, but then he just moves away and leaves them all, so how much could he really care.  Michael obviously had problems of his own, mainly that he needed to be Alice's savior, and when she started to become strong, he left her.  Alice summed him all up when she said, ""I am not your problem to solve.""

One scene really touched me. In rehab, Alice told a counselor that she was afraid that getting sober would mean that she will not be any fun anymore. The counselor just nodded and said that she understood, because she was a ""two time loser"" in rehab, and after she got sober, she ended up getting divorced.

When the children visited Alice in rehab, it was heartbreaking the way that the 4 year old ran to Alice as soon as she saw her, screaming for her mommy and running into her arms in joy to see her again.

A few lines stayed with me because those moments from the movie touched me so much.
(1) A guy in rehab said, angrily, ""Do you mean to tell me that this guy does not drink?  How do you watch the game without a beer?  It is a cunning, baffling disease, and denial ain't just a river in Egypt."" and another rehab guy shouted at him, ""Save it for group, man, save it for group!""
(2) Visiting Alice in rehab, Michael looked at the patients in disgust, and Alice said, ""Whatever you are thinking about these people, think that about me, too.""
(3) Alice screamed at Jess to do her homework and slapped her, and Jess cried, ""I already did my homework! That was all that I wanted to tell you!""  and then, she whispered to her doll, ""Good girl, good girl.""
(4) Then Jess called Michael on the phone, crying, ""Mommy died."" and Michael screamed, ""I need an outside line!"" to get an ambulance.
This is the kind of experience that stays with a child for the rest of her life.

I hated the neat happy ending because it was not believable.
Alice is sober, with no relapses, and she is doing fine raising two children without Michael.
Michael comes back and it is assumed that they will get back together, just like that.
But it was never said how long they were separated or how much contact they had during the separation.
It would have been more realistic for the movie to just end after Alice spoke at the meeting.",1442534400,,6252,4.379101899827289

A young Meg Ryan took a serious role in the middle of a slew of romantic comedies with Tom Hanks to make this movie and she succeeded she is great.  Andy Garcia is worth just looking at he is that gorgeous.  But his role as a overly supportive husband makes you want to love him even more.

I am a social worker and one of the many, many social workers who had to write a paper about the family dynamics in this movie.  I do feel like it shows important lessons.  For example, parents make mistakes, sometimes pretty bad ones, but they can work on themselves to the point they can apologize to their children and work very hard to make up for the mistakes.  Another lesson is that marriages are hard, especially when one partner is an alcoholic and the other is an enabler.  With hard work, marriages can work and come out from the battle even stronger.  Finding oneself and realizing that you are worthy is one of the most important lessons I feel this movie depicts.  Watch it and see what you think.",1421193600,4,779,4.4822695035460995

I know it's impossible to depict completely what people go through when embarking on the road to recovery - whether it be from the perspective of the addict/alcoholic or their significant other - but any light shed is indeed that. Light.  I would highly recommend this movie for all to watch though...

All the performances were excellent and the roles were a perfect example of how addiction, whether alcohol or substance abuse affects a family.

Meg Ryan, as always, acts her part to perfection with just the right amount of humor she normally injects into her roles, making her character tolerable and lovable, despite the problems she creates.  Andy Garcia, handsome and sexy as ever, played the husband with just a perfect balance of caring, compassion and enough-is-enough.  The ending was as it should have been - true to most relationships and showed that love can endure.

Meg and Andy have the right chemistry to make their coupling believable and the romantic ending, where they smile directly into each others eyes, very real and tender.

This movie does an excellent (although somewhat idealistic) example of what a family must go through in order for all members of the family to be healed of their role in the alcoholic family.

If your family is dealing with the effects of alcoholism or any other form of substance abuse, get as many family members together as possible and watch this movie. Then get alcoholic family counseling for yourself and for the children, or at the very least, look for an Al-anon, Ala-teen, and ala-tot meetings in your area.

621593,5,6303269869,"Gut wrenching, heart breaking and even jarring... but still a perfect movie.

Unlike so many other movies (A BEAUTIFUL MIND, I AM SAM) that presents the audience a false notion of happy endings, this movie depicts the issue of alcoholism flawlessly (perfectly, if the word could be appropriate within such a subject). From being the proverbial perfect couple, to the subtle hints, the dangerous behavior, the acknowledgement, the self-loathing, the denial and the even more tragic recovery process, this movie covers the subject flawlessly.

As a university professor, I often used segments of this incredible movie as a presentation of the struggles of recovery.

What saddens me, was my realization of how few people know about this incredible movie. I can only surmise that it was not a ""hit"" movie due to its realistic depiction of alcoholism and its tragic consequences in modern society. After all, most Americans would rather watch movies of disturbing violence, sexual deviance and other dysfunctional subjects rather than deal with the realities of their own struggles. Ultimately that is what this movie accomplishes... it causes us to look inside of ourselves (and at our loved ones) with a healthier and stronger perspective.

Kudos to Al Franken, Meg Ryan, Andy Garcia and all who helps create this incredible work of art. If only there could be other movies being made that are equally great.",1391299200,,1406,5.1535087719298245

It is ridiculously over the top and cheesy. Ironically, a great drinking game to play while watching this film would be to take a drink everytime you find yourself thinking: ""What? That makes no sense"" or simply rolling your eyes or groaning at the cheesyness. A lot of people say Meg Ryan is too pretty to play the part but it's actually that she's horribly directed and puts in a really unsubtle performance as does everyone else in this film. The eldest daughter who is apparently 10 is also badly written in that she often speaks like a woman in her 30s which I guess we're supposed to find cute but I find distracting. It is so blatantly hokey and tries so hard to pull your heart strings that you end up resenting it for insulting your intelligence.

621972,4,6303269869,"Someone said they showed parts of ""When a Man Loves a Woman"" to them in an alcohol program they were in after a DUI arrest. Interesting. From the title it sounds like it is going to be a romance, even a romantic comedy, but it is a serious drama about a man who is married to an alcoholic. Michael Green (Andy Garcia) is a pilot who meets Alice (Meg Ryan) in the Buena Vista Caf in Fisherman's Wharf. Actually, it is in what we San Franciscans used to call The Marina. It is the bar where Irish Coffee was invented. If you are ever in San Francisco, try one. Even if it is something for tourists, it is an experience not to be missed. Unless you are an alcoholic and shouldn't drink.

Alice Green, for instance, should not have another Irish Coffee at the Buena Vista Caf, or Dolce, Hemlock Tavern, Zeitgeist, Holy Cow, Harry Denton's Starlight Room, Martuni's, Endup, The Stud, Specs', Savoy Tivoli, Vesuvio, Kimo's, Bondage a Go-Go, Arrow Bar, Boom Boom Room, Ten 15 Folsom, 330 Ritch, El Rio, Ginger's Trois, Midnight Sun, Bix, Motherlode, The Lexington Club, ELBO Room, and Shotwell's, ever, under any circumstances.

Alice Green: I drink a quart a day. It's vodka so you couldn't smell it.
===============================

This was a good, serious drama. If you are drinking a quart a day, though, you could smell it, vodka or not. In spite of a few relapses, it was a very realistic depiction of alcoholism. It didn't just have a fake Hollywood ending either, where Alice stopped drinking, took it one day at a time, and lived happily ever after. It also dealt with the enabling behavior of her husband, Michael, and the fact that just because you stop drinking doesn't mean there aren't other issues that you'll have to deal with. It showed the devastating effect that alcoholism can have on the children. The performance of Tina Majorino was incredible as the oldest child, Jessica Green. She really conveys the confusion that children of alcoholics feel. She loves her mother, but when she gets drunk, she hits her. She doesn't stop loving her, but she isn't unscathed. Tina Majorino did a great job, for such a young thespian.

Al Franken, now Senator Franken, formerly Stuart Smallie on SNL, who was good enough, smart enough, and dog gone it, people liked him, wrote the script along with Ronald Bass. Franken and Bass did a really good job with the script. It was based on a ten page synopsis by Orson Welles. I thought that Senator Franken was just a clown, but I guess he has a serious side. Who knew? He also has a cameo as the co-pilot, but he never says much.

Maybe you are saying that you don't want to see a movie about alcoholism because you don't have a drinking problem. Hey, you drink, you fall down. You get back up. No problem. Work is the curse of the drinking class. Though denial is not just a river in Egypt, the talent of Meg Ryan, Tina Majorino, Andy Garcia, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Al Franken, and Mae Whitcomb cannot be denied. Alice Green may have called her daughter's outfit a 'sad little ensemble' but the actors of ""When a Man Loves a Woman"" are a great ensemble.

Alice Green: That is a sad little ensemble!
=======================================",1255910400,2,5327,6.7101449275362315
622011,4,6303269869,"A thoughtful, insightful movie. Don't coming looking for a romantic comedy or you will be disappointed. I was curious about it because Al Franken had co-written the screenplay. I was familiar with his career as a Saturday Night Live performer and writer and his political satire. As the child of a non-recovered alcoholic parent, I was interested, especially after he launched his Senate campaign, to see how he would handle a difficult, serious, topic of an intimate, personal nature. Al and the rest of the filmmakers did a fine job with a subject that is usually handled in a trite, happy-ever-after ending way.

The movie asks the interesting question: what's harder, the alcoholism or the recovery?

Meg Ryan's character, Alice, drank a lot even before she and her husband, played by Andy Garcia, got married. Alice is a charming, fun drunk. Andy, a caretaker personality, seems to enjoy peeling her off whatever surface she's landed on and carrying her to bed--at least when he's home, which is not all the time since he's an airline pilot. Unfortunately, Alice progresses from being the life of the party to drinking vodka for breakfast. She's not so much fun any more, in fact, she's a wreck, and you won't like her. Her drinking threatens the physical safety and emotional health of her children as drives them around and strikes out at them irrationally when she's drunk. Alice finally is so scared at the danger she's put her children into that she realizes she's out of control and goes into rehab.

The drinking part of the movie is more heart-wrenching than usual because the danger to the children is more graphic than is usually shown. However, the rehab portion of the movie is where it really departs from cliche and challenges the audience. While Alice goes through the process, she cannot see her family, nor does she particularly want to. When she comes home, she's a transformed person. She's got an edge to her, a fierceness, she did not have before, and she has to cling to that difference to avoid falling back into her old patterns. Her husband, who has been comfortable in the caretaker role, does not know what to do. He wants to take care of her and help her as he has always done, but she now must take care of herself. Their old marital paradigm is dead, and whether they can find a new paradigm is not at all clear. You might see a happy ending; I saw an ending where things might get better, but there are no guarantees.

My husband did not find Meg Ryan's performance persuasive. I thought she did quite a good job outside her usual bubbly-cute persona, though she never looks as bad as someone who drinks as much as her character drinks would be expected to look. At least she's not afraid to create a character the audience won't like. Andy Garcia and the supporting actors are excellent. The real star, though, is the thought-provoking, challenging script.",1254700800,4,2893,4.734126984126984
622012,4,6303269869,I love Meg Ryan in this movie.  Her acting is so sincere.  It really draws you in.  You really feel what she feels.,1250726400,,115,3.9130434782608696
622013,5,6303269869,"I bought this movie off of this site because I have been searching for it all over and finally came here and found it. The movie, as I am sure everyone has seen, is about an alcoholic mother who seems to disreguard everything and everyone in her life. She finally is sent away for some help and her family/children come and visit her. Its an adorable movie and Andy Garcia is so adorable in it.  It was cheap, easy and sent to me within the next day. I'm not really a movie person, but when I go to search for those that I like, I will definitely be back on this site to find it.",1229212800,,579,4.034782608695652
622014,5,6303269869,"Alice Green (Meg Ryan) and her husband, Michael (Andy Garcia) are a happily married young couple, until Alice's secret drinking problem is exposed.  Alice goes to rehab and when she comes home, she and Michael don't know how to act with one another without the help of alcohol.

This is a really good romantic drama dealing with the terrible ways alcoholism affects a couple and their young children.  Oh, my goodness - that Andy Garcia can act and he's quite the dreamboat, too.  He's so utterly convincing as the tortured husband that it makes me wonder why I haven't seen him in more leading roles.  Meg Ryan, on the other hand, never convinced me she was suffering with guilt or shame or anything; her sunny smile and angelic face were always the same...perky, perky, PERKY!  Alcoholism never looked so good!

It's interesting that most of the conflict in the story is after Alice comes home from rehab.  It's only then that they both realize what a big part drinking had in their lives and that they have to start all over in their relationship.  Although the happy ending is never in doubt, this is an emotionally draining film that is very well done.",1220918400,2,1157,4.6600985221674875
622015,5,6303269869,"This subdued but tender and gut-wrenching look at two people who desperately love each other but find their marriage unravelling because of the bottle has two genuinely moving performances from Andy Garcia and Meg Ryan. At first quietly touching, and as it progresses, ultimately heartbreaking, it is like watching a terrible car crash in slow motion. You can't take your eyes away from the screen because you must know the fate of the family inside.

Written by Ronald Bass and Al Franken, the beautiful photography of Lajos Koltai is in contrast to the sad music score of Zbigniew Preisner, highlighting the difference between appearances and the real picture just beneath the surface. Director Luis Mandoki begins the film in romantic fashion but soon peels back the layers to expose a marriage in deep trouble.

Andy Garcia is amazingly good in an understated performance as a husband very much in love with a wife who has become a liitle too drunk a little too often. A pilot for a major airline, he has all the trappings of happiness. Two adorable little girls and a nice home, however, can offer no magic answers when he sees the woman he loves sliding and is at a loss what to do to stop it. Like any husband, Michael Green wants to fix things but can't admit he doesn't know how.

Meg Ryan is flawlessly genuine as his wife, Alice Green. A trip to Mexico to ease the supposed pressure prompting her to drink too much only puts a spotlight on how far she has fallen when a tragedy nearly occurs. But it is a moment alone with her oldest daughter which will finally force her into a treatment center. Rather than cliches, this film shows there are no easy answers. Michael is disquieted then shocked at just how much the children saw and knew about their mother's problem. Things of which he himself was unaware.

The underlying problems still remain when she returns and tries to readjust and you can truly feel the frustration of the coulple. Finally separating, Garcia is truly magnificent in scenes with the two young girls from Ryan's previous marriage he considers his own. Meg's finest moment in the film comes near the end and should have put her into Oscar contention. Tina Majorino as their older daughter and Lauren Tom as their babysitter deserve mention as well. Quietly played performances with the thoughtful intelligence you see more often in foreign films seemed to work against the picture's stars in this regard.

This film is ultimately about love and is quite romantic. It is a mature romance, however, devoid of pretense and not seen through rose colored glasses. A beautifully conceived drama which leaves a lasting impression on the heart and a film everyone should see.",1219536000,6,2701,4.78755364806867
622016,5,6303269869,"I use this movie as a homework project for my college Abnormal Psychology students to help them learn how to diagnose alcholism (by documenting the symptoms protrayed) and see its devastating effects on people which it demonstrates with remarkable clarity and sobering impact. It also gives a decent glimpse into where the disorder comes from (eiology) and its treatment, but not near as clearly.

Of course, I love Meg Ryan in any movie, but here she plays her part well, as does Andy Garcia who shows both the healthy side of love and its unhealthy side when it rears its head as codependent enabling. Yes, such spouses are to be commended for ""hanging in there"" no matter what, but love alone is simply not enough.  For you also have to deal with conflict to have a successful marriage.  So the only area that I would have changed would be to show how Alice's (Meg's) new assertiveness can come together with their love to resolve their issues, and for Michael (Andy) to be able to love her while accepting her new strength without needing to always rescue and do things for her.

But in contrast to so many other movies who show everything magically coming together within one therapy session or ""aha"" insight, ""When A Man"" avoids the usual Hollywood fantasy to show a more realistic picture. For real change does take time and working through so very much.  So all in all, this is an excellent, superb movie even if you don't have to write a case report on a mental disorder.",1217203200,3,1480,4.633587786259542

Very enjoyable, but also will pull on your heartstrings.",1207353600,,326,4.666666666666667
622019,2,6303269869,"I thought this was going to be a romantic comedy, but was disappointed to find this a dark and depressing drama.  It is a story about how being an alcoholic can affect a family and the journey they have to take to stay together.  Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia play a married couple, and Meg is the one with the alcohol addiction.  The saying about hitting rock bottom would definitely apply to this film.  The audience sees Meg slowly spiral completely out of control, and how low she has to go until she finally is ready to reach out for help.  Her family has to come to terms with the fact that she will not be the same person she was as a drunk.  When Meg emerges from rehab, everyone is on edge with her - not only her family, but friends and acquaintances too.  Everyone has adjustments to make.",1206489600,26,795,4.26
622020,2,6303269869,"Not a totally off-the-mark depiction of the effects of alcoholism on families, but over-the-top acting and embarrassingly bad dialogue here and there, especially at the end. And it's a little unbelievable to see Meg Ryan having turned from sweet-and-perky-but-screwed-up, pre-rehab, to ""Don't 'f' with me"" street-tuff, post-rehab.  Best thing about this semi-soap, from my female perspective, is gazing at the always easy-on-the-eye Andy Garcia. MUCH better movies about addiction and recovery: Drunks (Richard Lewis), Jesus' Son (Billy Crudup), Clean and Sober (Michael Keaton) and the excellent, early-60's ""Days of Wine and Roses"" (Jack Lemmon), if you can wince through Mancini's syrupy-yucky title track.  (But it won the Oscar for best song, so what do I know.  Different times, I guess.)",1201305600,,794,5.6
622038,4,6303269869,"It's a little heavy-handed and comes off a bit syrupy at the end, but `When a Man Loves a Woman' is an effective tear-jerker of a drama that accurately handles the tragedy that is alcoholism.  It manages to take no sides in the matter and portray both spectrums of the disease, looking objectively at the alcoholic themselves as well as the sober mate as he tries to pick up the pieces.  It refuses to really place any blame, even when it tells you that it is and I think that was a wise step since there really is no blame to be placed in situations like this.  You get better, you move forward.  When you stop to point the finger you regress.

The film takes a look at a middle class suburban family torn to pieces because of the wife's battle with alcohol.  Alice Green seems to be the perfect mother and spouse from the outside but she harbors a dirty secret.  She hides her problem from her family; her husband included, but when things really hit their bottom there is no denying what needs to be done.  Alice enters rehab in order to clean up, to get sober and stay there to protect her family.  This leaves a strain on her husband Michael to take care of their two daughters Jessica and Casey, as well as work and take care of the home.  The stress of having his wife away from him, not knowing how she is doing at all times, eats away at him and causes divisions between him and others that he comes in contact with, like the Green's housekeeper Amy.

What I love so much about this film is that it exposes the fact that the disease is not the only problem causing agent.  Most people feel that when one suffers from a substance problem they can fix it and move on and everything will be better but the fact remains that that is not the case.  When Alice returns home, sober and clean, her fights with Michael intensify to the point where they start to loathe one another.  It casts a light on the fact that the rehabilitation process is just as painful sometimes as the disease itself.  People change when they are sober, and that is brought to the forefront too.  It's clear that, while he doesn't want to admit it, Michael misses the woman his wife was when she was drunk.  He misses her wild side as well as his ability to put her back together when she fell to pieces.  It's a time of adjustment, not just for the `sick' mate but for the entire family.

Meg Ryan is astonishing here.  It sickens me to know she was snubbed of the Oscar nomination (she's my personal winner this year) for her performance is so accurate and effortless.  She manages to display every confused emotion you'd expect to see from an alcoholic going through rehab.  She manages to capture her character brilliantly.  Andy Garcia works here, but his performance doesn't carry the same weight as Ryan's.  He manages to capture the confusion and pain of the worried spouse well but he's almost too subtle at times, so subtle that his outbursts seem a bit theatrical.  Tina Majorino is amazing as the eldest daughter Jessica.  She was quite the star in 94 with `When a Man Loves a Woman' and `Corrina, Corrina' coming out back to back and showcasing this young girls talent.

In the end `When a Man Loves a Woman' delivers.  It really works as a dramatic film to capture the harsh realities of alcoholism and even teaches the viewer of the consequences that come from all sides of the equation.  Like I mentioned in the beginning, the film is a bit heavy handed.  It tries really hard to make this as tragic as can be.  It also comes off syrupy at the end, as in `let's make this as devastating as possible that way when everything gets fixed the whole audience will burst into tears'.  Sadly, I hated the ending.  It was too corny for my taste and took away from the film's feeling of reality, at least in my opinion.  But, the entire film leading up to the last thirty seconds is phenomenal and deserves major attention.  Even if `When a Man Loves a Woman' is not you cup of tea you must admit that Meg Ryan chews up the scenery like it were candy and delivers an orgasmic performance worthy of much praise and admiration.",1195430400,,4110,4.391534391534392
622039,2,6303269869,"Let's see...Meg Ryan's character is a boozer who physically abuses one of her daughters, drives drunk with both daughters in the car & forgets one at a shopping center. She goes to rehab, quits drinking, but is now chain-smoking. She's rarely home as she goes to AA meetings constantly. Her husband, who is trying to help her the best he can, is the villain-what?

The two then separate. Andy Garcia's character starts going to Al-anon, works HIS program, & the two reunite-one happy AA family. Jeez, this movie could have driven Billy Sunday to drink.",1187913600,4,552,4.810526315789474

That being said here are my thoughts...

This Movie captures you from the very beginning, Meg Ryan plays an Alcoholic with a stunning and dead on performance. The scene where Alice ( Meg Ryan) and Michael (Andy Garcia) fight when she suggests she should leave for awhile is so raw and brutal it left me gasping. This Movie is NOT theatrical hype, or movie of the week material, what it is, is a very honest portrayal of a family in crisis and how Alcoholism affects the entire family. Andy Garcia as Michael does an outstanding Job playing the ""enabler"" he takes care of Alice (Meg Ryan)whenever she is drunk, handling everything which in turn contributes to her feelings of self doubt and insecurity. The Movie gives you insight into each character their strength and flaws, allowing you to understand the role they each play in the family, from Alice the Alcoholic, to Michael the enabler, Jessie the Mini Adult, behaving as a Mother at times to the baby sister Carrie.

It focuses on finding the solutions, not just poking at the problems alcoholics cause in families and relationships. It presents to spouses the concept of ""letting go"" and ""caring about"" versus ""caring for.""",1094688000,2,373,5.131147540983607

The alcoholic in this movie is played by the awesomely talented Meg Ryan, who should've been nominated for her role as the depressed alcoholic mom, Alice.  Andy Garcia is also a good choice to play the troubled husband.  The movie is very depressing but has a silver lining.

The title I must admit doesnt draw you to the movie because you figure *Oh just another romance with no point or purpose* but in reality there are both.

622158,2,6303269869,"The scenario of a family dealing with a wife being the abuser rather than the husband is not commonly explored, yet this particular plot was ill-conceived, which almost makes it a crime. If a story as important as this can't be told well, it's better not to tell it at all, or the effect is that the viewers are numbed to a reality people should care more about. And when I finished watching this film, I yawned and put in something more gripping, while I should have at the very least been lulled into a few moments of reflection or contemplation.
For the most part, though the screenplay wasn't great, I feel poor casting is responsible for the film's failure. Try as she might, it just doesn't seem Meg Ryan can be taken seriously doing much else than romantic comedy. No, she isn't a bad actress, but the quirky, cute persona is what carries her, and when she attempts to be serious, she comes off as a little witchy and intolerant, not at all sympathetic or likable. In this particular role as the substance-abusing wife and mother, she doesn't  inspire sympathy, never expresses any depth of confliction, and never convincingly emerges with dignity, though I suspect it was meant to be an empowering story.
Andy Garcia is ""blah"" as her husband. Yes, he's suitable as a nice guy who is confused as he both supports her and tries to hold her accountable, but he often comes across less confused and reticent and more wary and aloof as if he's actually secretly distracted by his dealings as a mob flunky or something.
The best performance is by Tina Majorino, who doesn't for a moment look like the spawn of Ryan and Garcia, but who's authentic reactions of fear and confusion when victimized by her mother are heart-rending. Thus to the film's credit, I guess the reality of a child being the most vulnerable victim in situations of substance abuse is demonstrated, but is not a strong enough impression to make this an even moderately impressive film.",1078099200,4,1957,4.672463768115942
622159,5,6303269869,"This is one of the best loves stories of all time. Meg Ryan, for the first time shows how she has been do acting school. Until this film I can honestly say that Meg Ryan has not shown any diversity in her acting skills. However, this is a beautiful film and she plays the role convincingly. I was very impressed.
The chemistry between Meg and Andy Garcia is great. You can believe that these are two people that love eachother more than anything else in the world. I never cry in films but the pain that these two characters suffer is unbearable and these actors have to be given a pat on the back for their skill.
Andy Garcia is a beautiful actor and makes you believe every word he says. He makes the audience want to kiss it all better and conveys the pain in an amazing way. Like every man, he finds it hard to cry but knows what it is to cry.
The family on the whole work as a lovely team. Lets face it, the kids are extremely cute, and the older daughter is an amazing actress for her age, so thumbs up to her. Th film moved me and made me believe in a love that you don't find in many other films. Beautiful work from everyone...",1075075200,4,1136,4.121621621621622
622160,5,6303269869,"I believe that addiction can only be overcome by love.  The demons of addiction thrive and perpetuate in a black vacuum of mental and emotional despair; only the steadfast love and support of others can exorcise them.
And indeed it is love that ultimately breaks through the shackles of alcoholism in director Luis Mandoki's gripping film, WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN.  Michael and Alice Green (Andy Garcia and Meg Ryan) are a young couple deeply in love--so much so that Michael tends to downplay his wife's growing dependence on alcohol.  Only when Alice's addiction plunges her down a desperate, dysfunctional vortex--from rummaging through trash looking for vodka bottles to passing out in the shower--does Michael come to the jarring conclusion that he is on the verge of losing his wife to an insidious disease.  Alice is placed in rehab, and Michael's devotion is put to the test:  from his discomfort with support groups to Alice's subsequent aloof and detached demeanor.  Life after addiction will not be easy, for Alice, Michael, or their two daughters.
But again, love never is easy.
Garcia and Ryan give compelling, realistic performances.  I also was moved by the performance of young Tina Majorino, who plays Garcia's stepdaughter Jessica.  Over the course of the movie, father and stepdaughter form an emotional bond as they attempt to keep their fragile family together, and the strain on young Jessica shows.
I was shocked to learn comedic satirist Al Franken cowrote the screenply; what a departure from his usual material, but Franken obviously knows his subject matter here.  WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN is anything but a ""feel good"" film, but there is little good to be gleaned from a story about addiction.  But this movie succeeds through its powerful depiction of devotion and love--a power that will keep the viewer riveted and engrossed from beginning to end.

622161,3,6303269869,"This film received no more than average response from Critics and audiences in 1994 and it is interesting to watch it a decade later to see how it holds up. There is no doubt in my mind that Meg Ryan wanted this role to contrast her ""America's Sweetheart"" image. Fresh off her perky roles in hits like ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""When Harry met Sally,"" the part of Alice Green is a super acting part for Ryan and she is up to the challenge. Andy Garcia, then on the cusp of mega-stardom (it never panned out, oddly enough) had to settle for the part of victimized, shut-out husband,but he makes the makes the most of it. So why do I only give this film 3 stars ? The problem is in the script. The story is full of holes and under-developed plot lines. Why did the writers not delve into Alice's failed first marriage, her relationship with her parents (we only discover that her father is an alcoholic in the film's final 5 minutes), or show the professional consequences of Alice's behavior. I suspect the Producers felt that Ryan and Garcia' s Star Power would carry this film but I was left with more questions than answers.",1046476800,5,1127,4.449275362318841
622162,4,6303269869,"This is actually a very good movie, in spite of the fact that I personally hate Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia.  I was about to stop watching after seeing the first 15 minutes, but after sticking with it I thought the movie was excellent not just because it addresses issues with alcoholism, but issues about conflicts in family life and barriers to communication, which happen to be quite common in general.
Even if you remove the topic of alcoholism completely, you can see how the movie deals with issues like what happens when the person you are married to is no longer the person you married?  What do you do when someone you love is hiding things not just from others but from themselves?  What issues come up when a couple starts to see a licensed practitioner?  What is it like to enter a support group, especially when you have judgments about the types of people that make up the support group?
I would have given this movie five stars if not for my personal distaste for Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia.  But this movie really opened my eyes, and perhaps more importantly, my heart, and I would recommend it to anyone who has experienced a troubled relationship, due to alcohol or not.",1045785600,8,1183,4.535211267605634

Though it did a decent job of representing the behavior of an alcoholic, the personification was WAY OFF!  Meg Ryan's healthy skin and hair just weren't realistic.
I did like the movie, and I'd venture to say that if the movie was made over someone would catch that and hire a new make-up artist.",1041033600,,414,4.376623376623376

 Meg Ryan is a truly beautiful woman. Far,far too beautiful to make a good alcoholic. As her husband,Andy Garcia comes across as a whiny little killjoy.
Alcohol ravages the body and ruins skin tone. We are suppose to believe that Ms. ryan is so addicted to alcohol that she digs through trash cans to finish the dregs of a bottle of booze (as is seen in the film). It simply is not convincing. The pain and ugliness of  alcoholism never are realized. Since the agony and horrible consequenses of being an active and then recovering alcoholic are the basis of the entire dramatic ""impact"" of the film, I kept waiting for the problem to get bad enough for me to care.

Meg, as Alice, insecure and able to hide her drinking from everyone but her children, Jess and Casey.

622229,4,6303269869,"This movie may not be in the 'Days of Wine and Roses' league, in which the great, departed Jack Lemmon deservedly won a Best Actor Oscar. It is, however, a very significant film for me personally. Dealing very sensitively with alcoholism, the performances given by its two main stars, Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia, are, in my view, underestimated. I have watched this movie several times. I am a huge Meg Ryan fan, and, whilst this is not my personal favourite of hers, I feel that it proves that she is too good an actress to be typecast in romantic comedies. She looks the part as the alcoholic, and I intend to be merely complimentary in this assessment; Andy Garcia, equally, is fine as the 'al-anon' husband, with whom so many spouses can associate. I suppose I am somewhat biased in my opinion, as, not only am I a massive Meg addict, I have also (like Meg's character) pulled through alcohol addiction. For me, the scene towards the end of the video, where she, at the alcohol treatment centre, makes a speech, to declare that she has been sober for 184 days, is very poignant. I saw this movie when I was at my lowest ebb, traumatised by alcohol addiction. This scene was to save me, as I thought, if Meg can do it, so can I! Therefore, I white-knuckled it through 184 days, just like Meg, and I am now nearly at my fourth 184 days, after nearly two years of sobriety. I'll never know whether this film would have had such a profound effect on me if someone else had played that part. But, in my view, no-one else would have been able to play that part to such good effect. The carefree girl from 'When Harry Met Sally', reduced to alcoholism. That's why it was effective, and, for me, a life saver. So a big thank you to Meg Ryan, and not to forget Andy Garcia. Seeing an alcoholic deteriorate through the eyes of a loved one is always inspiring to those who wish to combat the illness. Not a great movie, as I said earlier, but a very underrated one. It saved this reviewer's life.",996019200,28,1987,4.387533875338754
622230,5,6303269869,"Coming from an alcoholic family I was able to relate to the children in the movie.  I think Meg Ryan played the part perfectly and Andy Garcia did a wonderful job as well. It was a different look at a serious disease, the fact that the mother was an alcoholic.
Meg Ryan (Alice Green) plays a wife and mother of two, who has an out of control drinking problem, that takes her almost dying in the shower to make her realize that she has a problem.  Andy Garcia (Michael Green) plays her husband who knows that she has a problem, but just is not ready to face the fact that she needs help or she is going to hurt herself or one of the children.
When Alice finally does get the help she needs, Michael doesn't cope well with the fact that she now has other people to turn to when things get rough.  Michael does try to go to a support meeting for family memebers, but just sees it as a bunch of people sitting around feeling sorry for each other.  He thinks that things will just 'go back to normal' now that she has gotten help and just isn't that simple.
Although the effects that her drinking had on the kids was not addressed, I felt that it touched most of the bases that a family goes through after recovery.
