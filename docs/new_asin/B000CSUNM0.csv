2474157,5,B000CSUNM0,My son loves teletubbies and we have eight other videos. But this one absolutely my son's favorite.  He is 10.5 months old and he sings blue sky song with Po.  :)  It is worth the money we spend on this video because first time he sings a song :)  Teletubbies - Blue Sky: Fantastic Friends and Springtime Surprises is number one in our house.,1152748800,7,342,4.296875
2474217,5,B000CSUNM0,I don't get why my three year old loves Teletubbies but he does and that's all that matters.  I got this over a year ago and he still watches it.  It calms him down when he just needs to relax.,1225411200,,193,3.8
2474218,5,B000CSUNM0,"My 19 month old son LOVES this video...it seems so slow to me, bu he is into it big time! For me it is very relaxing, soft...it make sme sleepy!- it doesn't get him all worked up...it is very simple and sweet...but my son requests it daily at some point. It is long, about an hour so we will watch it for 15 minutes or so then turn it off then come back to it where we left off later the same day or the next day. He never seems to tire of it.",1223251200,,443,3.723404255319149
2474219,2,B000CSUNM0,"My 17-month-old daughter loves Teletubbies. Her favorite DVD is ""Here Come the Teletubbies"" which features many interesting scenes with children. Notably, a beach scene with a little white dog and a beach ball. She stands riveted during this scene. She also loves the segment where chicldren in school put on their raincoats and go outside to play in the rain.

Bluesky has proven to be a disappointment. The scenes are almost psychedelic-- with bright, graphically designed balls repeatedly bouncing across the screen. She loses interest quickly. I find it a bit disturbing, personally. I know this is all subjective, and I'm sure there are babies out there that like this DVD-- but perhaps they are much younger.",1219276800,,714,5.102564102564102
2474220,5,B000CSUNM0,"The Teletubbies were created years ago by the BBC (British Broadcasting Company) as an educational resource for infants through pre-schoolers. They are a fabulous series. I have read a lot of drivel from reviewers of this series (claiming that it is dross with no educational value because it entertains babies and pre schoolers) and I just want to have my say. Yes - parents can just leave their kids in front of the show - as many seem to do -  but they are great shows to watch with your little ones and interact with. My seven year old was brought up on teletubbies - he loved them. He is now a avid book worm with advanced reading skills. He recently read the Percy Jackson and the Olympian series and has read 14 Warriors novels. I am not saying this is just down to the Teletubbies - I have taught my son to read at home - but Teletubbies was one of the places I started along with early picture books. I have just introduced my 8 month old to the delights of Teletubbies. She becomes really engaged, laughing and shouting at the television. She look at me with amazement! My eldest son is 23 years old and he is studing medicine in the UK. We are from the UK hence my knowledge of the program. I am also a fully qualified teacher in the UK. The BBC produces educational resources for the UK government run schools.",1213315200,,1322,4.352226720647773
2474221,5,B000CSUNM0,My baby loves Teletubbies so this is fine. I personally don't care for them but as long as my baby love them then that's fine. Have fun!,1210809600,,136,4.074074074074074
2474222,5,B000CSUNM0,My daughter loves the sounds that they make. She also likes the ball that LaLa plays with. The squishy sound that Po makes is funny to her. I think they are weird. They no longer televise this show. My daughter loves it. Hopefully everyone can buy this DVD to protest the cancellation of Teletubbies on PBS.,1203465600,2,307,4.5
2474223,3,B000CSUNM0,"I love all Teletubbies, but apparently, as with all products, improvements are made over time.  This DVD is from one of the older shows.  It's still a good dvd, but I prefer the newer versions.",1192147200,4,193,4.485714285714286
2474224,5,B000CSUNM0,"What can I say, standard teletubbies fair. If your child has seen a Teletubbies video anywhere before you probably know the reaction: they either love it or show no interest.

This one our Son (1 year old) went bananas over and we had to buy it. He loves the sunny face, the Teletubbies sequences. He loses a bit of interest in the live action sequences and tends to play with other toys, but when the Tubbies come back on he is captivated.

The DVD represents good value as it runs for a long time (I think it is multiple TV shows all run together) without breaks. It's good to put on for a 10 minute distraction or for an hour plus of absolute silence from the little one. High production values, good music, high quality all round.",1180656000,3,734,4.350364963503649
2474225,5,B000CSUNM0,"What is it that makes Teletubbies so compelling for children? Our son is now 14 months old and has been captivated by Teletubbies (or Tetetare as he calls them) since the very first time we played this DVD several months ago. I expect they will still work for him for years to come. This particular selection of Teletubbies adventures and vignettes of children having fun seems to be the most compelling of the Teletubbies DVDs, and it can delight him, distract him or calm him down like nothing else - and I mean NOTHING else. Apart from the baby language used by the Teletubbies, the accents are mostly British, but in some places a US/Canadian voiceover has been added, presumably where the British accent or language would be unfamiliar to a US audience - no French or Spanish language options sadly.

Teletubbies are broadcast on PBS if you want to check out an episode. The beauty of the DVD is you can play it whenever need arises.",1179964800,5,938,4.616766467065868

8102184,5,B000CSUNM0,I rated Teletubbies Blue Sky. My daughter was born with down syndrome. Every since she was born she love the teletubbies. She had this vhs Blue Sky for years.
