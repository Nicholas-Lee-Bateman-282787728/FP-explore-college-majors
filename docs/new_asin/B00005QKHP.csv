1651463,4,B00005QKHP,"Okay, I've read some not so good reviews of this nice little movie. Why should us non-filmmakers have negative words about what seems to be a good attempt at making a purely entertaining, heartfelt film without all the usual graphic sex and profanity often associated with films. This guy seems to be saying he he did the best with the budget he had, and hey, the film festivals seemed to like it. How about we general public stop pretending we know all about filmmaking and what it takes to create one. We should be supporting indie and gay filmmakers with a solid interest in storytelling. This guy got his film made, and I say he did a fine job and told a good story...isn't that what filmmaking is about?",1018137600,2,708,4.496124031007752
1651464,1,B00005QKHP,"It was terrible...it was a low budget ""B"" movie...with poor (to say the least) acting.....need I say more?  I got suckered into buying the flick with all the pre-relaese hype. Don't bother buying it, come get it out of my trash can.",1017792000,4,232,4.523809523809524
1651465,1,B00005QKHP,"May be one of the most listless films ever made. Deadly dull dialogue, wooden acting, stilted camera work and an unimaginative story.  The plot meanders without pace, direction or meaningful character development. The writer has something to say about tolerance toward gays and lesbians, but his film is so bland that it's hard to care.  This film is stuck on the notion that small town life and values are superior the city's, so that I half expected a religious theme to develop, and sure enough as the credits rolled by, a quavering voice sang a peculiar song about ""there's room for everyone at Jesus' table.""  The message is fine - just awkwardly introduced.  That's a good word for the whole film, awkward.",1016496000,2,712,4.811475409836065
1651466,5,B00005QKHP,"I thought it was a good movie. There were a few scenes that weren't necessary but I think the story and acting was very well done. It mainly deals with coming out to parents. One of the characters in this movie was sent away to an institution when he told his parents he was gay. It's very disturbing to hear what he went through but what is more disturbing is that parents actually do this to their children. These places need to be shut down and any parent who sends their child to one should be put in jail. But anyway, buy this movie. It may open your mind to a few things. It's a shame movies like this aren't more widely seen by the public.",1015459200,2,646,4.134920634920635
1651467,4,B00005QKHP,"A feel-good movie. It has some slow moments, but that all changes and the story kicks into gear. You want to see what happens next. I'd say one of the better, more realistic films I've seen this year...and without ""four letter"" words.",999907200,,234,4.595238095238095
1651508,1,B00005QKHP,"An Eternity Till Fall is my new title recommendation for this film, because it took an eternity until it ended - Good Grief - Low Budget Does NOT Have To Equal = Bad Film! Delete  of the less interesting characters in this movie (that will be a daunting task determining which ones get the axe; I would suggest the annoying ladies in the kitchen), add more sexual tension ""with the coming of age ordeal"" (awakening sexuality is a terrifying experience and is worth a better portrayal) and get some better actors!

I'm Sorry, but this DVD is being added to my coaster collection!",1153008000,2,578,4.601941747572815
1651509,3,B00005QKHP,"And there are more than a few, along with several completely unnecessary and uninteresting scenes of random characters talking about nothing.  This is symptomatic of editing and screenplay weaknesses that bring into question the caliber of movie this is.

Stay in your chair, and be patient, and appreciate the effort that went into the making of this movie.  The payoff near the end is significant, and goes a long way to make up for some earlier problems.

Very few movies choke me up, but this one sure hit me hard.  It's worth seeing, and is probably even more powerful for folks that are a little younger than me, just really starting to come to terms with being different and what that means to them and their future.

There is also very little in this film that would be inappropriate for young people, except for alcohol use, which is foreign to probably very few.

Recommended for coming-out and family issues and gentle handling of friends and relationships, despite significant editing and screenplay imperfections.  Certainly an independent movie, in any case, and one worth seeing.",1139529600,32,1094,4.939890710382514
1651510,1,B00005QKHP,"This has to be the worst film I have ever seen.  I bought this movie because of some of the comments posted here.  Do not waste your time or money on this dismal movie.  I made myself finish watching it because I paid for it. That and the fact that I didn't think it could get any worse.  It does.

  If I ever see a bad film now, I rate it compared to this.  No film comes even close.  This saying in my house now is...""Well at least it wasn't as bad as 'And Then Came Summer'.",1131840000,5,478,3.845360824742268
1651511,3,B00005QKHP,"A sweet movie with some serious heartfelt writing, worthy of at least me writing this review. I find a lot of junk on the market. This is something that I can add to my library. No violence or harsh language? I wonder how they got it made.",1121904000,,239,4.1063829787234045
1651512,5,B00005QKHP,"I disagree with most of the people reviewing this movie. The

thing that redeems this movie is the fact that the producers making it have their heart in it.

 Even A person who is not gay would obviously feel for the two kids that are. In a way it's a real tear jerker. The fact that it

has a great ending also speaks well of it.

  The movie does have it's weaknesses-true. Some of the script could be better. I didn't appreciate the alcohol part of it. For some reason people have the ideas all gays, even the teens drink or get drunk. Not so!! Even so through the alcoholic fog , We see Tommy coming out to Seth by kissing him and then it seems the relationship gets closer and closers but without just sex.(In fact -there are no real sex scenes in the whole movie- just twice you see them hugging and kissing- one of which was an imagined scene in Tommy's thoughts) The 2 kids are very much in love with each other and it shows.

  This is not a movie about sex - It's a movie about love and

it shows it. The kids are playful, caring, talking all the time and form a relationship that is admirable.

  If I were a young gay teen I'd love to meet the character of Seth. He is the real star of the movie and the actor did a terrific job portraying him. A loyal, sincere kid with a desire to be the best he could but mingled with the pain of being tortured at the hospital, who could not be moved by such a kid??

  So I rate this film high on being a great movie based on sincerety, a rare film showing a loving relationship that is rarely seen and certainly a terrific ending make this to be a wonderful first film for a gay teen to see-hoping he's not however swayed by the alcoholic scenes.

  Maybe there's a few things that should have been improved but for a low budget film, it is something I enjoy watching.

  By the way I give it a 5 star rating for the wonderful music in the movie. Great soundtrack!!",1120608000,10,1916,4.118918918918919
1651513,1,B00005QKHP,"I cannot begin to explain so that others will realize how BAD this movie is. On a recommendation I rented this (unfortunately my list of movies to watch doesn't tell me who told me to see them, or I'd never speak to them again). It was AWFUL. The acting was very amateur (that's an insult to amateurs actually, I've seen some home movies that are better than this); The directing is almost nonexistent: two characters are often scrunched together (on a couch or standing) so closely so they fit in the frame-- looks very unnatural. The story... hah! I think most of it was adlibbed... and quite poorly. Most of the dialogue is so forced and fake that it's sickening... and to top it off, most of the dialogue doesn't relate to the story AT ALL. Definitely one of the worst I have ever seen. 1/10 only because we can't give zeros.",1078185600,5,829,4.4605263157894735
1651514,5,B00005QKHP,The guys are really attractive and I was surprised with how emotional the storyline was.  It's important to not forget how easy it would be for people to go back to this way of thinking.  Especially with the ignorant and discriminatory comments made by our President lately...,1060128000,2,276,4.851063829787234
1651515,2,B00005QKHP,"This is another film that has its heart in the right place... the filmmakers, cast and crew wanted to make a pretty film about the tribulations of coming out and being gay. But, sadly, they don't back it up with anything to put some meat on the film's bones. The script just wanders, the acting is terribly amateurish, and the camerawork just clunks. Worst of all, the film's treatment of women is unintentionally hysterical and borderline offensive. The funniest moment on the DVD? Watch the interview with the lead actor... he thinks he's Tom Cruise.",1032393600,4,552,4.821052631578947
1651516,2,B00005QKHP,"And Then Came Summer is a padded out film which was, at times, humorous, when it had no intention of being so. I do not hold a prejudice against low budget films but this one's script let it down. The scene where old aunty is pie-making with the two giggling hetero-women (neither of whom are seen again) hopefully implied that they were added to the pies for yet further filling to a puffed-up plot. The two older males stunted the flow with their cliched dialogue and stiff acting while the crux of the film - the institutionalising of Seth - is kept for the final 10 minutes. However, of all the performances, I think Seth's stands out. He is the only one with a clue about subtlety. The cameo from the nosy neighbour typified the cliched context.
The DVD contains interminable & repetitive interviews where even the actors seem to be asking 'is that enough?'And the ultimate question - why the long shot in the father-son climax scene where the two become mere spots on the horizon?
For a film about electro-shock therapy - it needs a dose of high voltage to bring it to life!",1023494400,10,1080,4.51530612244898
1651517,1,B00005QKHP,"Wow.  I thought we'd gotten beyond this point:  flocking to movies with gay themes only BECAUSE they have gay themes (or going to gay restaurants with bad food and bad service, or... well, you get the idea).
I don't wish to be cruel, because I know dozens of people put their hearts and souls into the project, but this quite frankly never should have been made.  There is nothing new: no insights, no twists, no heart.  It feels like a 20 minute short that was padded into a feature film by adding dialogue that not only has nothing to do with the story, but doesn't tell us anything about the character either.  As my partner said every time the aunt came on the screen:  ""Oh, good, let's hear some more gossip about the neighbors that doesn't mean a thing.""  To be honest we eventually started fast-forwarding through scenes that had this ""small talk"" dialogue (a LOT of scenes).  We could always tell they weren't saying anything important because the only time anyone said anything related to the story they become serious and angst-ridden.
There are many ""if onlys"" for this movie.  If only there had been a script to match the absolutely INCREDIBLE look (whoever the cinematographer was, he/she has a brilliant career ahead).  If only even ONE of the actors wasn't stiff and totally unbelievable (though to be fair, the dialogue was still and unbelievable, so they didn't have much to work with).  If only there had been SOME twist (like Dad or dad's friend being gay?).  If only I had read some of the reviews before I bought this film.
I guess I'm a masochist.  I keep buying and renting bad gay films and going to bad gay plays.  But when you find a gem, it makes it all worth it.  This, unfortunately, isn't even made of paste.",1022803200,11,1738,4.561290322580645
7951141,4,B00005QKHP,"After viewing the interviews. with the cast and the director. I really don't want to say anything bad about this film. I know why it was made and the reasons for making it. It was done on a low budget out of necessity. and they donate 10% of profits to gay causes. It was done out of shear will power.

7951144,1,B00005QKHP,"I am trying to find at least one positive thing I could write about this film...
Hmmm, the actor who potrayed Tommy is handsome. And that's it.
Everything is horrible here. Acting (a piece of wood would have played some characters better...), script (tedious), music - HORRIBLE.
It's one of the movies I will always regret spending time on watching it.",1306281600,,352,4.786885245901639
7951145,5,B00005QKHP,"I just can't understand some of the very negative reviews. Yes, there might be a few scenes that were slow and maybe even some bad acting here and there but I can't imagine anyone growing up gay that can't relate to what these two boys were going thru with family and friends and dealing with their own emotions coming to terms with who they were and understanding their feelings for one another. Sometimes you don't need a ""perfect"" movie to make a point.",1289088000,2,456,4.506024096385542
7951146,3,B00005QKHP,"A few days ago I wrote my first-ever positive review of a bad movie, because it was very well-intentioned and had a couple of other redeeming qualities. I'm going to do that again for ...And Then Came Summer.

I was only about three minutes into it when I paused it and came running to read the reviews. It was _SO_ bad that I didn't think I could keep watching it, but I wanted to see what other people said before I gave up completely. I'm very glad I did that.

A few previous reviewers have given more or less the same advice, and it turns out to be excellent: skip over every scene that doesn't have either Seth or David alone, or the two of them alone together with nobody else in the scene. (Conveniently, they're the two blond boys, so you don't even have to watch the bad parts long enough to find out who they are.) Then watch the last few scenes of the movie.

I didn't follow that advice exactly--I watched a good bit more than that just to make sure, but I needn't have. If you follow that advice, you won't have missed anything worth watching, you'll save yourself a whole lot of frustration, minor holes in the story (if any) will be filled in by what happens at the end, and you'll end up feeling like you watched a much better movie than you really watched.

I found that it became watchable just about where Chapter 7 on the DVD starts, a little before the one-hour mark. That leaves a total of less than 20 minutes to watch, including the end credits, which indicates that with some smart editing this might have been a fairly good short film instead of a terrible feature.

Even the end is not what I'd call good filmmaking. The things that make most of the movie unwatchable--very sloppy writing, directing, editing, and weak acting--don't suddenly get dramatically better. But what happens is that the irrelevant story lines fall away, leaving the focus on Seth and David, where it should have been all along. Seth's brother and David's father (who were childhood best friends), Aunt Lillian (who has no function at all in this movie but takes up huge chunks of screen time), the obnoxious redneck friend, and David's incongruously Hispanic younger brother all drop into the background where they belong, and something magic happens.

I'm using the word ""magic"" reluctantly, but I can't think of a better word to use when parts that are mediocre at best come together to make something lovely and touching, which the end of this movie is. I don't understand it. So I'm giving three stars for the magic at the end, but only if the movie is edited on the fly with the remote as described above. If you insist on watching Aunt Lillian, take away two of those stars.",1243382400,,2684,4.512345679012346
7951147,3,B00005QKHP,"O.k.  I'll start with the bad:

1.  Too much attention focused on unnecessary characters who add nothing to the plot.  What was the point of this?????

2.  The poor casting of the younger brother....a hispanic kid (this would have been credible if they said he was adopted or something or that the mother was hispanic).  Plus, the fact that this kid cannot act.

3.  The script needs editing badly.  The movie, even more so.

4.  SHould have focused more on the relationship between the two young men instead of shifting back and forth between them and the ""fluff characters and scenes"".

5.  The acting by most of the cast.....(with the exception of the four leads) is wooden and stilted.

6.  Better direction to the actors would have helped.

NOW THE GOOD:

1.  A beautiful SOUNDTRACK!!

2.  A great final three scenes.....with Seth coming out full force at the dinner table, following the church scene with his brother and the scene with Billy and his brother.  The movie is worth sitting through for these three scenes.

3.  Nice cinematography.

4.  The acting and chemistry between the two leads is very good.

5.  Brilliantly written and acted scene with the character of Seth describing what we went through trying to get de-programmed.  (I am waiting for someone to tackle this subject as the basis for a full length film).

In the final analysis, this film merits 2.5 stars.  Again, what was the point of the scene with the three women in the kitchen with the pies?????  Bad, Bad, Bad!!

But as others have reviewed here...fast forward through the scenes between the two fathers and the women and see only the scenes with Billy and Seth and you have an o.k. but not great movie until the final three scenes.",1240963200,3,1718,4.6767676767676765
7951148,1,B00005QKHP,I SNORED THREOUGH THIS ONE. THE TWO MALE LEADS HAD NO ACTING ABILITY AND WERE NOT AT ALL ATTRACTIVE. DON'T WASTE YOUT TIME OR MONEY ON THIS ONE OR YOU'LL BR SAYIN THE I WAS ROBBED.,1183939200,3,180,4.027777777777778
7951149,3,B00005QKHP,"Jeff London wrote, directed, and produced this little Indie film, and had he assumed only one of the duties, the result would probably have been a much better movie.  The running time is 115 minutes and could have easily been edited down to about 85 minutes by excluding the corniest 'homey scenes' with Aunt Lillian sharing pie recipes and girl talk that add nothing to the plot and only tire the viewer.

David (Jesse Petrick) and his little brother Ricky (Anthony J. Domingues) have traveled with their divorced father Brian (Jeff Davis) from their big city home to Brian's beach hometown to visit Aunt Lillian (Phyllis Rodenberger) for the summer. As this seemingly happy family (though broken by divorce) settles in, and Brian reunites with his old buddy Tommy (Jeremy Douglas) who has taken in his younger brother Seth (Mathieu Smith) as a favor to his family, the reason for the change of home will be revealed later.  As Brian and Tommy re-bond, both having losses in their lives since their boyhood, David and Seth get to know each other and gradually  discover an attraction that goes beyond friendship.  After a tender and quiet kiss at night on the beach, they acknowledge their attraction, only to be betrayed by the threat young Ricky poses as he declares he will inform David's father of his brother's perversion! The boys confront their feelings with the David's father and  Seth's brother and find acceptance and unconditional love from families mature enough to accept them.  Seth reveals his several month's history of  'rehabilitation clinic for gays' experience which led to his moving in with his brother Tommy and the bigotry and tragedy of that event solidly bonds all of the families during the summer referenced in the title.

Much has been said about the amateur acting in this film, but for this viewer the acting on the part of the four main characters is not at all weak: the direction is flaccid and begs for focus and tightening of scenes that would have made the edited down version of this film a very moving story.  An additional annoyance is the insipid music score (piano only) that breaks into 'Simple Gifts' at the most inappropriate time.  But the message of acceptance of gay boys coming out is handled well and has enough original thought and subtlety to merit watching.  Grady Harp, June 07",1181260800,4,2333,4.834170854271357
