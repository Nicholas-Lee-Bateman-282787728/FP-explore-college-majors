Alternate tunings are taught in this video, making it much easier for me to sing
in the key of C ---- thus greatly increasing my available repertoire.  Cathy Fink
is to personable, professional, and accomplished!  Great teacher.  Very helpful to me,
a novice-beginner on banjo.",1475712000,,354,5.175438596491228
8104075,5,B000E1OICG,"I'm very happy with this purchase. Cathy Fink does a very good job of teaching a novice player, such as myself, how to play vocal backup clawhammer banjo style. If you are wanting to sing while you play this DVD will help you do just that.",1450224000,,239,4.217391304347826

8104077,5,B000E1OICG,"This is a great DVD for learning clawhammer banjo.  Cathy is a great teacher and has even inspired me to sing along - something I'd never thought that I would do.  But even if you don't sing, these are great lessons.  And the DVD has a song menu if you just want to hear her sing and play - and that is worth the price of the DVD right there.  Go ahead and buy it.  You won't regret it.  Highly recommended.",1237161600,4,407,3.962962962962963
