8659489,5,B00KIZYCUQ,"I always have a hard time choosing favorite songs, or favorite books or my favorite movies. But this movie is easily in my top ten, if not my very favorite movie ever.

We have a long-haired Keri Russell, which is always fun, and a charming William Ash, who have fantastic chemistry together. It's a ""learn to dance"" type story, which I've always loved. Danny wants to be a professional footballer (soccer player for us Yanks) and one of his idols says that knowing how to samba is what's made him so amazing. Lucy has recently lost her partner due to injury, and William steps in to take his place. They make a deal - she'll help him learn if he'll be her partner for the upcoming competition.

She's rich, he's not, she loves dance, he's fumbling through the steps. They've got nothing in common, but they fall in love the more time they spend together (although neither one wants to admit it).

It has so much humor and fantastic one-liners, it has tons of adorable Irish accents (love!), lots of Latin dancing, a sexy dip in a pool, and just the right amount of romance with a fantastic big gesture at the end of the movie.

I was so excited when they finally made this into a DVD that I bought two. I just can't recommend this one enough!",1463184000,2,1243,4.414847161572053

8659491,4,B00KIZYCUQ,Enjoyed watching Keri dance.  She's good.  The movie was a bit predictable but it had good energy and was definitely worth watching.,1446249600,,132,4.954545454545454
8659492,5,B00KIZYCUQ,Really cute movie.,1441584000,,18,5.333333333333333
8659493,3,B00KIZYCUQ,The plot was slower than I remember and there was less dancing. I guess it's pretty old!,1437955200,,88,4.235294117647059
8659494,5,B00KIZYCUQ,LOVE THIS MOVIE!! I've had this movie for some time now but in the region 2 category. I saw MAD ABOUT MAMBO on a movie channel however at the time it was only offered in region 2. I purchased a code free d v d player  pacifacly for playing this movie. I've since bought a few other movies not offered in region 1 as well. Mad about mambo has only recently been offered in region 1. Maybe someday the other ones will be also.,1437609600,,424,4.0476190476190474
8659495,5,B00KIZYCUQ,"Some of the charm of this movie is learning about the ingrained prejudices between the religious and geographical areas portrayed.  The Brits vs. the Irish, Protestants vs. Catholic, etc.  One line from Lucy's father is priceless... he owns several DIY stores and is prosperous while the soccer team appears to be struggling and he is appointed the chairman for a ""Protestant team"" to find ""halftime entertainment"" and states the reason he was selected, ""I'm their worst nightmare, a Catholic with CASH!""

It is the ""boy wins the unbelievable girl"" with lots of plot twists and great music.  Totally charming, with a warm 'feel good' ending.",1435708800,,641,5.076190476190476
8659496,5,B00KIZYCUQ,"Great Mambo dancing, along with an excellent match of two characters from different sides of the fence during the troubles in Belfast in the 1970s.",1433808000,,147,4.92
8659497,4,B00KIZYCUQ,"I enjoyed the movie, but I like soccer, ballroom dancing, and Keri Russell",1424217600,,74,4.769230769230769
