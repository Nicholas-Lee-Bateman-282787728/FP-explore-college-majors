It's grungy, and ugly, and packed to the gills with stomach-souring misogyny (as opposed to the good kind) - so much so that you will immediately want to take a long, hot shower after viewing this stinky piece of cinematic poo to try and wash the stain from your soul. (It won't work.)

Basically, a sort-of-attractive housewife (okay, maybe 'sort of' is overselling her charms) gets raped in her shower/bathroom in a prolonged opening sequence (which you may or may not find arousing, depending upon your predilections). She reports the crime to the cops, and pretty soon the investigating detective is hitting on her! I mean, totally, egregiously coming onto her right there in his office, touching her hand, her shoulder...ugh. It's only one of numerous 'ick' moments throughout the film.

This woman's husband, a blonde bodybuilder-type with thinning hair and a bad bowl cut, he's cheating on his wife, as well as engaging in some pretty rough, borderline sadomasochistic sex - with his recently violated wife! (He binds her hands behind her back with his necktie and basically forces her to have sex with him, in case you were wondering.) Nice guy.

Anyway, it all ends up with the woman imprisoned at an asylum where the husband's moronic (literally) brother ties her naked to an operating table, frontside up, and beats her with a belt. (A uniformed nurse helps.) There's some business about an inheritance, an absurdly contrived will and death by electrified gate, blah, blah, blah. It all ends with a limp joke about a bullet-less gun (which seems weirdly appropriate in a way).

Now I have to go scrub down again. Thanks, movie.",1299283200,,1683,4.894736842105263
