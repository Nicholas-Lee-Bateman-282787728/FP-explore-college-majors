8123121,4,B000FII2UW,"Kultur brings us a brief introduction to one of the true Masters of whom, beyond his identity and a very few other facts, we are completely ignorant. His work, however, remains among the most popular and respected of the 16th century painters, no, of all painters still known to us. Located in what now is Belgium, he was very much a product of the religion and other social patterns of his day. In the 50 minutes of this film, its creators wisely focus intensively on a handful of his most characteristic works. These pictures, religious and social commentaries, come alive on the screen and beckon us to see more, directly in museums, where possible, in picture-filled monographs, where not. As is customary in these introductions, a narrator carries the burden of informing us, experts are heard speaking briefly on a number of points. Much of the symbolism in the  paintings, we are told, will be lost on most of us, either because we are not versed in the cultural symbolism of his time or because such symbols are veiled even from experts. While not for those with a good knowledge of art history, this introduction should serve the novice quite well.",1292976000,2,1157,4.756218905472637
