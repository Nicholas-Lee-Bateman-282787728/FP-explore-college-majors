8289605,5,B001CU7WXU,"This is a fun series to watch especially around Halloween. Interesting ghost stories and filled with fun haunted facts! It's not HD quality and is from the early 2000's. Some (not all) have been burned on wrightable disks so they have generic sleeves as pictured (left) . Some have The original sleeve as pictured (right).All my disks have worked fine.
I wish History Channel still had documentaries like this. I have the entire collection and would recommend it!",1504137600,,463,4.948717948717949

8289607,5,B001CU7WXU,"I absolutely love this series! I am trying to get all of them, so far I have quite a few. This one is pretty good as well. When one thinks of Atlanta, you know you should think of the Civil War and what took place there, but that's only one piece of history of this Southern City in Georgia.
