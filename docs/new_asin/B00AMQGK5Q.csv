5451465,5,B00AMQGK5Q,"First, full disclosure:I learned my kettlebell technique by reading Tracy Reifkind's book ""Swing"". I followed up with a private lesson and the instructor said I learned perfectly. So I am a Tracy fan.
This video is like going to a class with Tracy.  Although the workout seems simple, it works up a significant sweat and you can make it as challenging as you need.  It allows for growth and progression as your strength and endurance improves.  And it really works for both beginner and intermediate kettlebellers (is that a word?), but it is NOT an instructional video.  Don't buy it expecting to learn the kb swing.
Now this is not a slick, highly produced video --the sound is a little tinny, the set is bare bones, there's no music and basically no camera work.  And people in the video get really sweaty. But Tracy is funny and down to earth and doesn't take herself too seriously.  The exercisers look like real people. And its a great workout which has helped me to get stronger, slimmer and improve my form. Overall, I am really glad I made this purchase and look forward to purchasing other videos by Tracy.",1358985600,39,1116,4.6395939086294415

8553963,5,B00AMQGK5Q,"TR is bare bones, crappy sound quality, and great workouts.  I've been doing the 'swing' 5 x weekly since August after reading Pavel's S&S and Tracy's Swing Workout book....while I lost weight and definitely toned my  body and was doing 500 swings per day, I wasn't noticing any new changes (and not quite bored yet), so I backed off my own method and decided to try videos.  This is my new favorite...you just swing along and her progressions and changeups really, really make you sweat and you know you're working hard, and all you do is swing.",1454371200,8,546,4.608247422680412
8553964,5,B00AMQGK5Q,I never was consistent with exercise until I found Tracy!! Her techniques are easy to follow. Her style is enjoyable.,1450828800,3,117,4.9
8553965,5,B00AMQGK5Q,"I love Tracy's book. So informative and instructional. She makes working out with the kettlebell contagious, fun, rewarding and life changing.. The only workout I look forward to doing. It has changed my life. Unbelievably, I think of myself as an athlete. How cool is that?",1444780800,3,274,4.978260869565218

8553967,5,B00AMQGK5Q,"I started kettlebell training four months ago with Pavel's ""Simple and Sinister"" as my daily workout and a trip to the local SFG lead kettlebell gym every now and then for continued coaching.  Three months ago I picked up Tracy's ""Top 40"" DVD and couldn't finish!  I popped it in again last week, fully expecting to do better since I'd worked up to single handed swings with the 53 lb. bell and get-ups with the 70 in Simple and Sinister.  Work of the devil!  I still couldn't finish!  Then and there I decided I need to work some longer swing workouts into my routine twice a week.

This workout is perfect for me.  I followed suggestion Rif made in the introduction and used my 35 lb. bell.  A good call.  Doing the front half of each minute, I finally made it through one of Tracy's workouts.  Thanks to the sets on the back half of the minute, there's still plenty of room to grow.  I wore my heart rate monitor just to see.  My heart was in the upper echelon 80% of the time, but never spiked or peaked.

I get a bit obsessive when choosing DVD's.  I only want the heroes in my collection, but it's hard picking things I've never seen.  A number of reviews mention that the sound-quality is lacking, tinny, etc.  I didn't have that experience.  In my opinion, indeed, it was good.  Tracy is mic'd up the entire time and sounds just like she would if we were there in person.  Don't let concerns over sound quality deter you.

The free prize is being able to watch Mark, Tracy's husband and a Master RKC/SFG instructor, swing right beside her.  I always enjoy watching how experts move, and here we have two side by side.

Enjoy your progress.  I know I'll be enjoying mine.  Thanks, Tracy!",1396396800,28,1694,4.390322580645162
8553968,2,B00AMQGK5Q,"The sound is awful on the DVD and it sounds like she is in a well. Also, there are only a few movements and although I'm a beginner, I'm already bored with the DVD. Guess I expected more.",1378598400,4,187,3.9473684210526314
8553969,4,B00AMQGK5Q,"Tracy Reifkind's approach to health and fitness are something that I have really taken to heart.  This video is a nice presentation of a workout that anyone can do using her kettlebell swing method.  Production values are fair, and things don't always go to script, but the core training information is included in the video and Tracy and her team are likeable.  For a video production alone, I would rate this a ""3"", but combined with the training method and delivery, I give it a ""5"".  Hence, my 4 star rating.  Kettlebell on!",1375574400,9,528,4.634408602150538
8553970,5,B00AMQGK5Q,"I love this DVD because it's a total swinging workout.  There are no mtn. climbers, push ups or squat thrusts.  Some mornings I just want to swing the kettlebell and this does exactly that.  I do think that a better warm up should be included and I'm not sure why the ""movie"" part is needed but other than that I'm sure you will really like this one.  FYI I'm 51 and 50 lbs overweight.  I'm definitely losing weight and will update this when there's a significant loss!",1362009600,29,469,4.344827586206897
8553971,5,B00AMQGK5Q,"This is about a 40 min. workout with a warm-up; it is a great workout.  There is a front & back side that  allows for growth and progression as your strength and endurance improves.  The front side increases on swings while the backside decreases; so you can start off just doing the front side first or do both.  If you have never touched a kettlebell before you might want to visit Tracys FB page for tips on form.  If you are familiar with kettlebell form, you will love this & get a great workout.",1361491200,15,501,4.287234042553192
