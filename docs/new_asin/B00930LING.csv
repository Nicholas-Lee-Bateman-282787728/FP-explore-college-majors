5250795,5,B00930LING,"This movie brings to life the Miracle of the Catholic Mass through a simple story of three ordinary people facing difficult challenges in their life. Mixed with powerful Music and creative effects, it's a unique piece of cinema that allows Catholics to enrich their relationship with God and realize the enduring gifts of the new translation of the Mass.

""The Greatest Miracle"" was originally shown in theaters in 3D animation from the Visual Writer of Pohocantas and Hercules and the Orchestrator of Spiderman and Ice Age.

""The Greatest Miracle"" is for all Catholics who want to enhance their liturgical and spiritual experiences.

This movie re-enforces the power of the Mass and a deeper living of the liturgy.

The Mass is truly ""The Greatest Miracle""",1354579200,35,757,5.080645161290323
5250796,5,B00930LING,"It is geared toward children but everyone can enjoy it. They explain the Mass in a beautiful way! The kids will truly understand the meaning of the mass in a very simple way! Just beautiful, you won't be dissapointed!!!",1354492800,4,219,4.641025641025641
5250797,5,B00930LING,"I was apprehensive, I don't normally like animated movies.  But I heard it was well worth buying, so I did.  I really enjoyed it and even cried at one point.  The animation and graphics take nothing at all away from this movie.  It helps us to truly understand what God is all about and why we need him and what Mass is all about.  It's really a very special movie and YOU need to see it.
I would say that children from about 6 or 7 can watch this without a problem.  A good movie for the whole family really. I'm anxious to watch it a second time, I'm sure that I'll see things I missed the first time around.",1354233600,14,610,4.041666666666667
5250798,5,B00930LING,"My family and I don't go to see many movies at the theater... but we made an exception for this movie and we're SO glad that we did!  This movie is very unique in that the focus is on the Mass and Confession and their significance in the lives of different people.  The movie teaches while it entertains.  Although a CGI movie, the topics and characters are 100% realistic and are relevant for every member of the family.  It completely held my children's attention (ages 5 and 3 at the time) and had sentimental/touchy moments for my wife and I as well.

It was a great movie for the whole family and we've been anxiously waiting for the DVD release ever since we saw it on the big screen.  Looks like it'll be available in time for the holidays this year.  I know this will be one item the children will be receiving this Christmas and your children would love to receive it too!",1352764800,73,881,4.335365853658536

5250823,5,B00930LING,"If you have questions about the Catholic Mass, this is a great way to learn about what really happens.  Its great for young and old alike.

5250896,4,B00930LING,"Even though it is animated, I really enjoyed it.  It will be useful for my CCD class, this DVD follows the book ""The Holy Mass (Testimony of Catalina) perfectly, especially good for Catholics that don't know what the Mass is all about.",1440374400,,235,4.595238095238095

5250898,5,B00930LING,This is an awesome movie for adults and kids.  My priest loaned me his copy to watch and we loved it so I bought our own copy!  It really explains the elements and significance of our Catholic faith in way that is easy for kids to understand.  My older children (5th & 7th grade) were in awe of how the priest transforms to Jesus in the confessional and my pre-school-aged child liked the presences of the angels.  It is a GREAT movie that I highly recommend for all Catholic families.  Make for a wonderful family movie night.,1439683200,,527,4.391752577319588

5250924,4,B00930LING,"A wonderful way to envision the heavenly ""behind the scene"" happenings during Mass. Because of the cartoon characters, it seem to be geared more toward children. But the message was powerful! I find myself envisioning the invisible and wish I it were visible. People would pay more attention to the Mass, if only we could see that!",1434326400,,331,4.824561403508772

5250927,5,B00930LING,"A must-see for all Catholics! An animated movie that explains the Mass and how it relates to 2 people in the story.
I think this is extremely well done and will show it to my grandchildren and my girls' group. (ages 8 - 17). Any adults who have seen it in my church have raved about it and it would be good to show RCIA candidates.",1431043200,,331,4.03030303030303
5250928,5,B00930LING,"I bought this for my friend who is a fallen-away Catholic. For about 15 years I had been reminding her to go back to Church, confession, and to teach her kids the Catholic Faith. After she had watched this movie, she called me up crying. She said this was the most inspiring movie she had ever watched! She said her son. who is turning age seven loved it too! He kept asking her so many questions about the movie, the Angels, the creatures, Mary, and the Eucharist etc....  They liked it so much, after it ended, they watched it again. She told me that she is a visual learner. She said the movie let her SEE  what was really happening in the Mass( the real presence of (Christ in the Eucharist), and confession( God giving absolution from sins), and how prayer is very important in every day living.  She told me that she wanted to go back to Church, and a week later she went back to Church, and told me she is signing her son up for Catechism classes and to receive the Sacraments. I am so glad I bought her this movie. It is such a heart warming movie. I commend the writer, artists, musicians, and all who created it! It is truly inspired by God. I too, being a regular Mass attender, after this movie,  have more appreciation for the Mass and our Faith. I can almost visualize  the beautiful animated white angels from the movie on the alter. The sweet selection of music in the movie touched my soul as well..  I highly recommend this movie to everyone.",1430265600,,1460,4.349264705882353

I can not even described how much difference has made at Mass.  I had the Catechism children and parents watch it.  They sure were affected by it... it is a great teaching tool and perhaps a reminder.
there are a couple or more not accurate parts... but the benefits are so great, I would truly recommend it , specially if you can sit with them and explain the parts, that are a bet off",1426118400,,562,4.090909090909091

5251053,5,B00930LING,"I watched this movie with my children who at the time were 9, 7, and 4.  I loved this movie so much, I bought many copies for Christmas gifts in 2012.  With that said, this is obviously a low budget movie which was produced in Mexico, the animation is not very good to be frank.  However, after about 10 minutes, you get used to it.

I read some of the reviews who were concerned about the daemons who were shown in the movie.  However, I found the representation to be very helpful, now when my children are goofing off in Mass, I ask if the daemons are trying to distract them.  None of my children were ""scared"" of the daemons.  And they cheered when ""St. Michael""  showed up.

What I liked about this movie, it gives a realistic picture of the Mass.  Not everything is feel good, with flowers and sunshine, showing my children that there are forces that actively try to distract people from fully participating in the Mass.",1405900800,,927,4.4

Oh! We are happy... but we were already sharing it with adults so they could understand the Mass better... I guess the second graders at Holy Spirit school in Sacramento were the luckiest of all!",1402531200,,435,4.166666666666667

5251058,2,B00930LING,"I must agree with other reviewers who noted the inappropriate depiction of satanic figures in Church. This would certainly create unnecessary confusion for children, and even for some adults. Although the various story lines were good, I found myself distracted by the second rate animation.

5251060,3,B00930LING,"Bought this movie based on wonderful reviews and being a 2nd grade Catechist for First Confession/First Communion thought it might be something I could use for the classroom.  After viewing, I had some apprehension, so also had my DRE view it, and we decided it wasn't appropriate to use in the 2nd/3rd grade class setting.  Although the overall message was decent, the visual use of demons in the church, the fact that 'people' in the church morph into demons, and the fact that 'people' also morph into angels (guardians) would need explanation to children.  The communion of the saints was good, but the fact that the woman in the movie is able to actually see and hug her dead husband during the mass was unrealistic and confusing.  Those who have lost family members do not get to have that 'final' conversation with them as portrayed in the film. The locked door in the home of the elderly woman was strange, and the fact that the elderly woman was both at the church and in her room at the end was really confusing and I wouldn't be able to explain it as I didn't understand it.  As an adult, I liked most of the movie, but think it could have left some things out and been more effective. I'll probably view it with my kids (after all I bought it), but commentate it as we watch it.",1398643200,13,1290,4.4491525423728815

There is a SPECIFIC format one must follow to tap into either of those spiritual elements, call it quantum physics call it whatever you want, when you ""get it"" it works. This animation makes it ""click"".  I kids will like it because it's animated, adults will like it because it will give them insight to why their life isn't working.

5251075,5,B00930LING,As a Catholic this movie for me was very moving. Our movie was shown at our church before the Mass.  The audience had many children and you could hear a pin drop during the presentation. I also loved the animation.  It reminded me of the movie Polar Express a wonderful Christmas Movie.  I am going to show this movie to my family.  Thank you.,1394064000,,343,4.3125

5251078,5,B00930LING,"I am probably one of the biggest movie critics out there. I'm all about the picture, the story, the details, the music. Almost to a fault! I didn't watch this for about one month, it sat there until family was like, ""You have GOT to see the movie!"" I kept saying it looked like too much bad CGI, (I was waaaaay too judgemental) but OH MY WORD y'all do Do NOT judge this movie by it's graphics!!!! They did the job!! This is based on the mystics of the Church, and I LOVE LOVE LOVE reading about saints, mystics, etc. Sooooo this was a complete and total surprise on the accuracy and the explanation of the miracle we have in the Mass! EVERYTHING about this movie I completely fell in love with!!! The way they told the story! The music!!! (It was BEAUTIFUL, I want a soundtrack!) but most of all, it will help you come to love and learn about your Catholic Faith.

I've bought this film 10x over to give away. It is THAT good!!!! You won't regret it. It's for allllll ages, NOT just kids! So even young adults and over will enjoy this film if they want to learn more about the faith! Get it! Don't hesitate!",1393113600,3,1107,4.246445497630332

I can not say enough about this lovely movie.  It covers everything about the Holy Mass as well as Confession, Communion, Our Blessed Mother, God the Father, the Holy Spirit, souls in heaven and those in need of our prayers in purgatory and of course our guardian angels.  I have watched it numerous times and always get more from it each time.  It makes me more aware of the love that is always ours.  It also reminds us how to worship and pray and especially not to rush after Communion but to thank Our Lord for His great gift of Himself at that very moment.  I could go on and on but I highly recommend this movie for all Catholics no matter where they are in their journey towards heaven.",1393027200,2,869,4.3602484472049685

5251098,4,B00930LING,"The content of this video was really awesome. At first, the animation annoyed me as it seemed very antiquated. The production I found out was in Mexico, so maybe they are not as up-to-date as we are? That aside, my children were enjoying watching, so I continued to watch also. The message and the way it unfolded turned out to be awesome. In fact there were a couple of things from the movie that have stuck with me for weeks now. I can't say that for too many other ""cartoon/message"" videos of this genre (i,e, Veggie Tales, etc.).  I only dropped the one star for the animation. Definitely worth getting past that for the content!",1390176000,,633,4.504347826086956

5251128,5,B00930LING,I teach Sunday school at my parish and I wanted to provide my students with a different perspective on faith and this film delivered. I bought the disc based on the description that was provided and simply ordered the disc and proceeded to show it to my students. We haven't had a chance to discuss the content of the film but I believe that it was eye-opening for them as they watched the story being told.,1387152000,,407,4.368421052631579
5251129,1,B00930LING,"This movie had so many favorable reviews and only two who had something negative to say. So I was quite surprised after watching it that anyone found it suitable for a CCD class of 2nd graders let alone younger children. The figures are drawn with a lot of shadowing to give them 3 dimensions, but in actuality make the characters look sad, dirty and unappealing. The story begins with three very sad circumstances (a mother who mourns the loss of her dead husband, a son whose mom is too busy to give him any attention, a bus driver who is so distraught over news of someone who has been unfavorably diagnosed by the doctor, and a lonely old lady). They are all drawn to the Mass, which one hopes will give this movie a bit of happiness, but not too fast. No sooner are we to begin learning about the importance of the Mass when there are these sinister drawn demons that are climbing the walls by the Confessionals. These are cartoon drawn but every bit as creepy as things that you would see in more adult films. The ""angel"" type character explains that these creatures are always trying to prevent to true repentance and people trying to come to God. These things were unnecessarily menacing and grow larger. They are not as fake looking as the bad spirits in The Lion, Witch and Wardrobe, during the killing of Aslan (if you saw that).
In the end...it really doesn''t matter how great this movie may be for bringing a wayward adult to respect or view Mass with more interest, it is completely inappropriate for children. If I had chosen to use it for my CCD class, I am confident the parent volunteer in my class would have thrown a flag. For my part, I threw it in the trash.",1386720000,8,1681,4.44336569579288

By that I mean the people, and the way they looked in their clothes.

The emotions and facial expressions were very good and got the point across well.",1385510400,,265,4.617021276595745

5251143,4,B00930LING,This was an interesting video showing the power of what takes place during each of the masses and how we can be distracted and what we are missing out on when we do not try to participate.  Would make a good video for kids to learn about their faith and about the roles of angels all around us willing to help us.,1384819200,,313,4.048387096774194

This DVD depicts three characters who are in the middle of major life-changing events.  The Greatest Miracle is by far the best DVD that is in my library.  Every time I view it, I find more to think about.  My Catholic Faith has escalated since the viewing of this DVD.  I'm learning so much about the Mass, Forgiveness, Love, Understanding, Evangelizing and most of all about ""God"" my savior.  Those of you who have purchased it know what I'm talking about.  Those of you who are thinking of purchasing it, don't hesitate as you will not regret it as you will certainly find that you will learn so much more about your faith than you ever believed you would.  Even non-Catholics would enjoy viewing this marvelous DVD. What a beautiful and unique Christmas gift it would make for loved ones and even yourselves.

To be honest, at first I was almost making fun of the low-budget cartoons and fake animations, but once I really understood and watched the movie it brought tears to my eyes. This movie just made me love the mass more and more. It truly makes you understand what the mass is really about. A great find!",1383782400,,429,4.180722891566265

5251169,5,B00930LING,"I loved this movie.  The message is wonderful.  The problem with the movie is the (slightly) awful animation of the characters, they move like blocks most of the time and the ""amatuerish-ness"" of the display of characters is a little distracting.  If you can get past that and listen to the dialogue, it's really thought-provoking.  I think if you are open to conversion, you will find this movie amazing.  The angels might not be what you think of them -- too much like birds? in the movie -- but if you listen to what they say, and what they do, it's very very comforting and hopeful.  The demons in the movie are a little scary, but it explains how they do try to distract you from Loving God.  The movie shows you the importance of loving our Merciful God deeper and being sincere in prayer.  I highly recommend this movie and do not mean to be too harsh on the delivery of the product.  The message is amazing and reminds us once again the Awesomeness and Sacredness that we should practice when attending Mass.",1374710400,,1016,4.478260869565218

It's definitely a video to watch more than once to get everything that is going on, but I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about the Catholic faith.",1373241600,,378,4.236111111111111

5251185,5,B00930LING,"This is an amazing animated movie about the Mass as well as Catholic teachings associated with it.  If someone, Catholic or not, wants to understand what Confession, Communion, Mass, Purgatory, the Blessed Virgin Mary, Angels and Intercessory Prayer are, this is the movie that will explain it to you. It is done within the context of three stories, that of a young widow with a teenage son, a man whose son is dying of cancer, and an elderly woman at the end of her life, which makes the movie more profound and will appeal to everyone.  My children (6 and 4) can never get enough of this animated movie, yet as an adult I find it to be one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen.  I gave it to someone to use it for RCIA (preparing adults to join the Catholic Church) and the people who saw this loved it, as there are few better resources in explaining the Catholic faith clearly and with such strength to adults and children.  In addition, the music is simply heavenly.  The score is all original by Mark McKenzie (who has written the score for several Hollywood movies) and is simply so beautiful you could close your eyes throughout the entire movie and simply enjoy that by itself, though obviously it is better while watching the movie.  There is a Spanish and English language version on this DVD, but there is a separate DVD with the Spanish title ""El Gran Milagro"" which is Spanish only.  The only difference is that in this version the priest in the movie is without glasses (looks younger) and the coins shown are American, while in the ""El Gran Milagro"" version the priest wears glasses (looks older) and the coins are Mexican.  And the texts in the movie are in Spanish vs. English in this movie.  So it really doesn't matter which version you will purchase if you want a Spanish version.  The experience of watching this movie will move you profoundly and may even rekindle your faith life.",1371945600,24,1911,4.545189504373178

Maybe for older children it would be ok.  I really was disappointed and did not like this movie at all.",1370908800,5,363,4.484848484848484

I found myself guilty of popping into Mass at the last minute and now I realize the benefits of arriving early and really focusing on reducing distractions while praying.

I believe the quality of the the movie is wonderful and after viewing it, I bought two copies and had them sent as gifts.  I have not heard their opinions yet :) but I bet they are pleased.  We are all Catholic and are familiar with Mass.",1368748800,,575,4.238532110091743

Although it's a low-budget animation movie, my parents, who are 60-70 really enjoyed it. They are very pragmatic about their faith, so it was surprising how open they were to this animation. This is a great portrayal of what happens during mass that is not revealed to mortal, human beings on Earth. Saint Faustina was granted this vision by God, so this story gives us an 'inside' look. This film is good for the family, even little children, as the concepts in this movie is not hard to understand. Overall, I give this movie an A+++",1368316800,5,626,4.548672566371682

5251274,5,B00930LING,"The animation in this film is visually breathtaking.  A 12/1/11 posting on Catholic Answers explains it to be the work of ""the talented Bruce Morris (The Little Mermaid, Pocahontas, Hercules, Finding Nemo, The Princess and the Frog).""

A 12/7/11 review by the Catholic League is filled with enthusiasm: ""this 3D animated film makes an important religious statement that appeals to people of all ages....The plot is inspiring and well crafted.  One ordinary morning in an unnamed contemporary city, three people, all strangers to each other, go about their own lives. The story alternates among them, shows each encountering hardship of one kind or another....Thanks to the intervention of their guardian angels, they find themselves on their way to the same Mass at a beautiful local parish [The exterior of the church building seems strikingly like Florence's Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore.].  At Mass, the angels encourage the three characters, instructing them on such things as preparing oneself for Mass, the existence of Purgatory, and how to pray....The portrayal of Jesus, in particular, is refreshingly reverential. This movie deserves a wide audience.""

While I share the Catholic League's enthusiams, I also agree with 12/9/11 cautions offered by in a review on Catholic Lane: ""the concept of using film to explore what is going on spiritually in Mass is a wonderful idea. There are some truly memorable scenes in this artful movie....But there are some real problems with the story, if you are hoping for something that is entirely true to the faith....this is one animated film about the Catholic faith that I would not recommend for young children.  Even for older children and teens, or anyone not already very well grounded in Catholic teaching, I would not recommend viewing this movie apart from a knowledgeable companion, parent, or friend, who could point out and explain problematic scenes"" (Note: In a 5/26/12 review of For Greater Glory, Steven D.

It is true that this movie does not have the animation of a high big budget Hollywood studio film but the graphics are not ""terrible"" either, they are decent.  For some wise reason, God does His big 'things' and miracles with and in humble and meek instruments that seem insignificant, He was born in a stable that looked more like a cave, was a carpenter, spoke in parables, went to Jerusalem on a donkey, among other things - just to see if you get the point. The $10.00 to about $15.00 bucks that you are going to spend on this movie is not a loss at all, it is more like an investment, you and anyone who watches it is going to gain a lot of fruits and blessings so don't get concerned or distracted for 'external' things such as the graphics or animation, but on the message of this movie itself it is what is important.

5251316,2,B00930LING,"I happened to see this movie as one of Amazon's recommended items, and after seeing the great reviews and ratings, I decided to buy a copy.

I'm pretty disappointed, as I was really looking forward to liking it.

The stories were okay and I get the meaning of what they are trying to portray, which was part of why I bought the movie in the first place, but I just wasn't as moved by the ""acting"" the way some of the other reviewers were.  The movie is pretty depressing for the most part, and although the creators try to lead up to an inspirational ending, it's kind of too late because you just sat through a depressing movie that tries to guilt you into seeing how God fits into your life. My family (which includes teens and a young child) found it more like a required religious school education movie, rather than one that uplifted you and made you want to see it over and over again.  My DH and I tried to have a discussion about it with the kids, and as I said, the meaning was understood, but when the kids left the room, we looked at each other and said: ""that was depressing"".

And the graphics were HORRIBLE, so that added to the depressed view. Like, early 1980's bad graphics. I mean, when the Veggie Tales series first started, the graphics weren't that good either but the creators included humor and whimsy while still being inspirational.

If you're looking for an uplifting, inspirational movie, this isn't it.  Don't waste you're time.

Just my humble opinion.",1356998400,3,1481,4.5

5251346,5,B00930LING,"This movie is a short, animated feature; just a little over an hour long, with 3d computer graphics to represent characters and such, and it's entirely faithful to the teachings of the Catholic Church.  Just wanted to say that right up front, since this alone accounts for 2 and a half of the stars I give to a film like this one.

The premise is that a few people; a struggling single mother, a busdriver worried about his sick son, and an elderly, faithful Catholic woman are all drawn to a church by the same young man.  Once there, they begin to have visions; seeing what really goes on in that church.  They see demons, angels, saints, suffering souls and what part Jesus and the Blessed Mother play in it all.

Some scenes (particularly the ones with the Blessed Mother and Jesus) are genuinely touching, and I almost wept at a few of them, which should give you some idea of just how well this film does its job.

Nevertheless, if I could, I would give this film four and a half stars, and there are a few reasons why.

The first is the animation.  While the character models are beautiful and extremely well-designed, the actual animation is rather lackluster when compared to the sort of thing produced by real movie studies.  I mention this first, because I found it just a bit distracting throughout the entire movie.

Secondly, the movie is -immensely- stilted, and its aesthetic leaves much to be desired.  I know that may be an odd thing to say, right after remarking on how it made me almost weep, but it's always a problem whenever angels are made to look overtly-feminine, Jesus and Mary -act- like plaster statues, and the relationship with Jesus is painted as largely a matter of reflection, contemplation and emoting.  The film does attempt to establish that more is involved than mere feelings, but it also seems to imply that those who have ""the wrong motives"" for doing good are second-class citizens in God's eyes; an old notion, which I've attempted to refute in previous reviews.  It doesn't say this overtly, however, or I'd put more effort into refuting it here.

The reason the church has lost members in recent years is that it has lost men, and like it or not; whether it makes us happy or not, most of the men who might be drawn to religion are not like the father in this film; they're not at the brink of despair over some personal tragedy and willing to listen to anybody who might give them hope.

The way you draw men into a proper understanding of the faith is by -avoiding- the feminine elements.  Explain that angels are mighty warriors (they're called the heavenly hosts for a reason, you know,) that the Catholic life is a spiritual war, that the sacraments are a form of power, and that our relationship with Jesus need not be some touchy-feely-hippie garbage; that it can be like the relationship between a soldier and the general who commands him.  You draw men in by not trying to calm them down.  They just get bored by that.

I still enjoyed this film, of course.  It's got a few other hiccups, apart from these two, but nothing significant.  As far as whether it's something to show to kids, there's no real cursing, bloodshed, sex or anything.  Characters shout at each other early on, and death is dealt with.  Also, the demons might be a little scary for young viewers, but my main worry with younger viewers would be the same as my worry with grown men; they might just get bored with all the angelic monologues and the slow pace of the movie, and decide not to watch anymore.

I would recommend this movie, mainly, to those who are already serious about their faith and want to see it illustrated in a film.  It's short enough that you can watch it some afternoon after work, and you might get something out of it.  I know I did.  I just wouldn't use it as a convert wedge.  Strengthen your faith with this gem, and make the converts yourself instead.",1355875200,8,3905,4.532097004279601
5251347,5,B00930LING,"This is a great movie. It truely illustrates what a Mass is all about. I have never heard any priest ever explain the Mass as well as this movie does.

5251349,5,B00930LING,"The animation obviously low-budget, but don't let that fool you.  Everything else about this movie makes it perhaps the best movie out there about the Catholic Mass.

Taking real world examples, it accurately explains Mass and what it means to take part in it.  It teaches us that there is so much more occurring each time it is celebrated than perhaps meets the eye.  The fact that it can also capture the attention of children is just icing on the cake.

I'm a man going through the Catholic RCIA initiation process at my local parish.  The first time I watched this movie at it's last showing at a local theater, I was exceedingly surprised and it brought tears to my eyes in 1-2 scenes.  Second time watching it over a year later when it was released on DVD, I cried through almost half the movie!
