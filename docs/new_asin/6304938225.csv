This is really a film that opens  up one's eyes to the horrors that occurred there.  The main actor was  especially good, and Marisa Tomei was quite impressive in her role.  It is  a film that is affecting and haunting, and it made me want to do further  research into the lives of the characters and the greater conflict itself.

940487,3,6304938225,"Having read the book by Michael Nicholson first, I looked forward to seeing how it would translate to film.  As with many other efforts, this one comes up short.  Stephen Dillane does well as Nicholson.  However,  Woody Harrelson's character does not really appear in the book except as a  compilation of mis-steps by various Western reporters.  Marisa Tomei is a  wonderful actress; however her character is not a major one in the book.  The movie would have been better if she had played the role of the  orphanage director, Vera Zoric'.  What I did like about this movie is that  it was filmed on location.  The location footage brings to the forefront  man's inhumanity to man.  The scenes that show the destruction to Sarajevo  are worth the price of purchase alone.  Overall this is an above avarage  movie but I would recommend the viewer read Nicholson's book first.",913507200,3,874,4.797297297297297

You are put right where the action is and the lives of these journalists are on the line. The acting was superb by Stephen Dillane and his character seemed real. Woody Harrelson, on the other hand, was shallow and appeared to be a slam on Americans. If he was a composite/representative of American journalists covering this war, then I understand somewhat why others hate us. His flippant attitude belied what was happening around him. His crack about Muslims killing Christians was gratuitous at best. Muslims have been killing for centuries and when it comes to killing Christians, no one condemns it, except other Christians. I can't speak to the politics of the Bosnian war but at this late date it may be an portent for all of Europe. All war is hell.

He returns to Sarajevo to find the childs mother, in a bold and dangerous expedition. This is the story of true heroes who should inspire every soul to do what ever they can to help human beings faced with horrible death and destruction. As an activist for some time myself having been involved in the cause of the people of Darfur and the genocide they have been subjected to, it has been what seems to be a long difficult road where nothing people like me do seems to offer hope. his film gives me a feeling of hope and of the idea of justice that must be attained at what ever the cost. Though fragmented in it's presentation, this movie is a touching story about justice and the brave human beings who were there trying to make a postive difference what ever the cost.

940593,5,6304938225,"I first saw ""Welcome to Sarajevo"" shortly after it was released. That's when I went on to find out everything I could about this conflict & why nobody stepped in to help (Clinton?? At the same time Rwanda was experiencing the same). Later, I wrote several articles for FrontlineWorldDispatch on Serbian war criminals. This film gave an excellent portrayal of what life is like in a war zone without overwhelming the viewer. It's hard for anyone to really appreciate living (& dying) in a country at the hands of people you've never done anything to (unless you can consider being Muslim a ""crime"") & do not know why. It truly came home to me one night when we ordered a pizza & our delivery man was Bosnian. I asked him if he was Bosnian or BosnianSerb. He told me that the Serbs had killed his brother. He was very surprized to find out that I knew all the towns & what happened in them. Here he was just a guy in a foreign country & a customer actually knew & cared. He had tears in his eyes when he gave me a hug & said ""thank you"". I will never forget him & the look in his eyes. Thank you to Michael Winterbottom for making this film. Interestingly enough, the rest of the world was taken up with Monica Lewinsky/Bill Clinton instead of innocent people dying. What happened to after WWII & the Nazi death camps (the Serbs' camps were eerily similar to these) & everybody said ""never again""? So much for that. Even though it's been 20 years since this the time frame this film was taken, the people there are still trying to assert their independance & recover from one of the worst mass ""ethinic cleansings"" the world has seen since the Nazis Jewish extermination. This is still going on in places around the world today with little or no press converage (or as in the case of Bosnia: ""the 14th worst place on Earth""). People should be able to live without fear of who they are, but as long as we have power-mad people, it will continue.

940598,5,6304938225,"""Welcome To Sarajevo"" is a powerful drama directed by Michael Winterbottom, starring Stephen Dillane, Woody Harrelson, Goran Visnjic, Emira Nusevic and Marisa Tomei.  Harrelson and Dillane are journalists (U.S. and British, respectively), who were covering the war in Bosnia, specifically in its capital city Sarajevo (with sprinkling of events in other parts of the country).

Though the movie does not cover the origins of the conflict, and the differences between Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs, it does provide the insight into the events as experienced by the foreign journalists.  Sprinkled with actual documentary footage, the film is engrossing and educational.

Henderson (Dillane) is trying to stay detached from the war, and to restrict his involvement to objective reporting.  This becomes increasingly difficult when he sees a local orphanage being filled with children who witnessed tragedies that would put many brave adults on Prozac and Xanax.  At the same time, Winterbottom interjects his own opinion of the war by inserting actual clips of world leaders expressing displeasure at the conflict, some even denying that there are any atrocities actually going on.

I highly recommend this movie to everyone who wants to become acquainted with what the people in the middle of Europe had to live with in the late 20th century, while their neighbors turned a blind eye.  I also recommend reading a short history of Bosnia prior to viewing this film, simply for a better understanding of events, and of who is doing what to whom and why.  Let's hope this never happens again.",1175904000,2,1585,5.233201581027668
940599,4,6304938225,"*Possible Spoilers*

I will review the movie first, then the DVD. I first watched ""Welcome to Sarajevo"" the week after Easter in 2003. Even though it got a relatively lukewarm reception by critics and moviegoers, I found it powerful. The basic plot of the film is about a British journalist, Michael Henderson (played by Stephen Dillane), who sees a 9 year-old girl named Emira in an orphanage that is bombed. Henderson forms a bond with young Emira, and decides that he must get her out of the country. Now at the time, the UN policy was that no children were to be evacuated from Bosnia, unless they had living relatives in another country. Aware of this policy, Henderson risks jeopardizing his career, getting into legal trouble, and possibly losing his life to find a way to adopt Emira. He eventually succeeds, and Emira happily lives in Henderson's posh London home.

""Welcome to Sarajevo"" is a difficult film to watch at times. For example, we see scenes of civilians massacred interspersed with archival news footage of Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic confidently saying that his forces act ""in accordance with the Geneva Convention."" There's one scene that many viewers are bound to find traumatic: several children, including Emira, are on a bus bound for an airport to take them out of the country and to safety. Unfortunately, they are stopped by members of the Chetniks, a Bosnian Serb paramilitary group. One of them boards the bus looks at the list of passengers, and forcefully removes several of the children. Emira would have been among them, but Henderson covers her and cries, ""No! She's English!"" Unfortunately, a baby that Emira had been caring for, Roadrunner, is removed. Nina (Marisa Tomei), an idealistic humanitarian who arranged for the childrens' departure, tries desparately, but in vain, to stop the Chetniks from taking the children.

Ultimately, ""Welcome to Sarajevo"" succeeds in giving a sense of what daily life was like in Sarajevo during the war. One word describes it: hopeless. The citizens hoped that someone could protect them sniping and shelling, that someone would get them out of there, but these hopes were unfulfilled. Since Americans were bombarded with news of the Bosnian war on a daily basisy, in a relatively sanitized form, they eventually grew apathetic to the whole thing. Myself included. If nothing else, I think ""Welcome to Sarajevo"" succeeds in portraying the Bosnian war as a true tragedy. For many, it was half a world away, but for those who were there, it was real, and it affected them day in and day out for 4 years.

Now for the DVD review. Why are there no extras on the DVD? If ""Black Hawk Down"" can get a 3-disc deluxe edition treatment, why can't ""Welcome to Sarajevo"" get something similar? There's plenty of stuff out there that could be put onto a special edition. For example, on YouTube I found interviews with the cast at the time of filming. In addition, I believe there was a PBS Frontline special about snipers in Sarajevo. If the Black Hawk Down DVD could include a PBS Frontline special among its special features, there's no reason it couldn't be done with this movie. In addition, there's plenty of archival news footage about the Bosnian war that could be put in to the special features. Of course, we could have commentary from the director, cast, and maybe the author of the book ""Natasha's Story."" Since the 10th anniversary of the movie's release is coming in November, I really think that they should at least consider these ideas.",1170288000,4,3529,4.886477462437395
940640,5,6304938225,"This is one of my favorite movies and I have watched it many times. In the face of unrelenting hatred, there are people who make a difference in the lives of others and this movie tells the story of these people. After seeing the movie, I researched the story of Emira (real name Natasha) and the British journalist who, with the combined efforts of others, rescued her. Even though he caught a lot of negativity for his actions, he still believed in doing the right thing when he could. The actual war footage in this movie shows just what the Bosnian people lived through. I have followed this war for many years (among other acts of genocide in other countries) and it never ceases to amaze me what some people do to other people they perceive to be diferent. This movie shows that there are still good people out there that are willing to risk it all if only to save one life. The soundtrack is equally as great.",1162857600,2,916,4.42603550295858
940641,5,6304938225,"This movie makes me want to be a journalist. The movie follows the lives of foreign correspondants who become intwined with the Bosnian war occuring in Sarajevo- a war they don't understand. While dealing with the silent tragedies erupting around them . The journalists covering the story of the century feel- frustrated, angry and depressed at times at the world's lack of care to tragedy unfolding in the country. A war in which children playing outside an apartment were considered fair game and a war that civilians were constantly targeted on both sides. A war that to this day is still misunderstood by the world and a genocide of a people that went on unnoticed.

To this day people in the United States debate wether or not saving Bosnia was worth committing troops and peacekeeping troops after seeing this movie you'll be horrorified that the US and the rest of the civilized world did not do more. I'm a little biased in my feelings of the conflict my preacher was in Bosnia for a year and I know an immigrant who escaped from the terror that unfolded there. The war was a civil war fought among the states of Yugoslavia-at the fall of communism. States in Yugoslavia began declaring independance based on their ethnic nationality- Serb, Croat, and Muslim... Creating a great amount of ethnic tension that OFFICIALY erupted in 92. The Serbs began trying to reclaim land- as they claimed their land they forced evacuated Muslims and Croats from their home, as well as executed many males and sent others to forced labor camps.  The state of Bosnia the stronghold of Yugoslavia's Muslim population became the center of Serb attack and it's capital Sarajevo became a city under siege.

What makes the movie powerful is many of the images/comments used in the movie is from ACTUAL footage-making haunting moments when you realize your looking at ACTUAL footage taken from a reporter who was there.

Based on the true story- the movie centers around a British reporter who ends up adopting a Bosian Muslim child- hoping to save her from the conflict and a love between them that blurs his work from his love for his daughter. For he is NOW speaking for his daughter.

The movie is a little one-sided in the fact it is clearly ANTI-SERB and the truth is no ethnic group was truly innocent in this conflict.

Welcome To Sarajevo shows the blurs between empathy, human nature, and being a witness to untolerable events. All in all ""Welcome To Sarajevo"" is definately a wonderful film to watch and is one with surprising emotional impact.",1153612800,5,2540,4.787671232876712
940642,1,6304938225,"In short, the film does a fairly good job of getting the message across, as it should do, in making people aware of the evils of war and the fact that the international community is often slow to act. At the same time, however, it does not provide a balanced examination of the situation on the ground, which only weakens the very effect it is trying to create.

What the film ends up doing is the one thing it must avoid at all cost in order to be effective: NOT to choose sides.  The Catholic Croats and the Muslims are the ""victims,"" while the Orthodox Serbs are wholly to blame...  That is neither witty nor wise when trying to carry out a ""noble cause.""  There is a term used in such situations and it's called... propaganda!

A more balanced and objective approach (i.e. there are no good guys and bad guys in such conflicts) with less bias and closed mindedness would have made the film more effective and therefore, more successful. The ultimate goal is good, but the method used is not necessarily the correct one.

Another setback is in relation to the acting (or lack of it); that is to say that the cast are badly in need of acting lessons (with the exception of Woody Harrelson)!  The acting-oh my- the acting is beyond words...  School plays (and pre-school for that matter) have better actors!  It is truly sad...

940644,5,6304938225,"""Welcome to Sarajevo"" will touch the viewer in many different aspects. The story follows the British journalist on his way from being an independent ""observer"" (which is imposible in Bosnia) to getting involved in a heart warming rescue and adoption of the Bosnian orphan girl.

In 102 minutes you will experience fragment of the massive collective and personal nightmare that hit Sarajevo on the verge of the 21-st century.

Why I gave 5 stars?

It is a personal movie. It is not a movie about the war. It is story about the people caught in the war who found their hearts in the middle of the most tragic and the most horrible event in Europe since the World War II.

It is authentic. It is based on the book that describes actual events. Its portrayal of the war is real, and most of the masterfully incorporated footages of the war are authentic.

Authenticity of depiction of all characters, events and localities is excellent.

Finally, this movie should appeal to those who are not accustomed to watching ""foreign"" movies as well. You will see familar hollywood names Marisa Tomei and Woody Harrelson doing the great job.

For Goran Visnjic's fans - this was the movie that launched his career abroad.

I would also recommend ""No Mans Land"" (inner story of the Bosnian war and its absurdity), ""Harrison's Flowers"" (to learn more about the degree of destruction and attrocities in former Yugoslavia) and ""Saving Private Ryan"" (universally good depiction of what does it mean to be a real soldier in a real war).",1123632000,6,1517,4.78544061302682
940645,4,6304938225,"As someone who followed the carnage in the former Yugoslavia with great morbid fascination during most of the 1990s, I found much of this film quite accurate.

There is a long and bloody history between the ethnic groups of Yugoslavia of which none are guiltless, but what happened in the early 90s was almost ENTIRELY the doing of the Serb leadership, namely Karazdic and Milosevic who both deserve a special seat in hell.  It was also the fault of the West, namely the West Europeans, that nothing was done until hundreds of thousands had been displaced, killed, and wounded---in particular, the British government was openly sympathetic to the Serbian side, and much of the Western Europeans also were afraid of having another Muslim state at their doorstep (the reason they keep refusing Turkey entry to the EU).  It was also partially Clinton's fault for refusing to go it alone when the Europeans balked, until much too late in the game.  But at least US military power was used for some cause other than oil or imperialism, for a change.

""Welcome to Sarajevo"" touches on all these points but very subtly; this is not a Spike Lee soapbox-and-a-megaphone type of movie, nor is it the kind of schmaltzy and posturing Hollywood misery-exploitation movie that I feared when I saw that Woody Harrelson had one of the starring roles.

As filmmaking it is competent but hardly stellar---pacing is a bit slow, some dialogue and acting was jarringly subpar (Marisa Tomei was NOT well directed at all), and the plot is fairly predictable and ordinary.  However as history and journalism it is worth watching, this film takes us behind the usual nightly 30 seconds of carnage film footage and humanizes the conflict by showing us not only the physical but also mental and emotional environment that these people endured for so many years.

The last scene, of a classical concert outdoors in Sarajevo near the end of hostilities, is simple, direct and beautiful.

PS. It is also true however that had what happened in the ex-Yugoslavia happened in some Third-World non-white country (and much worse things DO happen in those countries all the time, e.g. Sudan and Rwanda) it never would've garnered anywhere as much media attention.  And it is also sadly true that had the victims been Christians instead of Muslims, more would've been done much much sooner.",1118880000,4,2353,4.91919191919192

I'm still confused about the difference between the Bosnians and the Serbs and why they were fighting. But I did get a feel of the place which I never quite got before.  And as films go, the story is a patchwork of pieces and not put together well.  Woody Harrelson and Marisa Tomai are in it but their parts are quite small. This is far from a perfect film.  However,I'm glad I tracked it down and saw it.",1091577600,3,720,4.416666666666667
940649,5,6304938225,"In the spring of 1992, news correspondents from around the world descended upon Bosnia to document the most horrific conflict Europe had seen since World War II.  WELCOME TO SARAJEVO is the story of those correspondents and the surreal world they entered when they checked into their rooms at the Holiday Inn (which, as fate would have it, was located right on the infamous boulevard known as Sniper Alley; they couldn't have found a better place to view the action if they tried).
One of those correspondents, Michael Henderson (Stephen Dillane), has very little patience with colleagues like Jordan Flynn (Woody Harrelson) who always find ways of involving themselves in the stories they're covering.  ""We're not here to help - we're here to report,"" he says.  But Henderson finds it increasingly difficult to remain detached from the carnage around him, especially when Serb artillery and Serb snipers start targeting Sarajevo's children.  Frustrated by networks (who would rather lead with stories about the Duchess of York's marital problems) and world leaders (who condemn the killing while allowing it to continue), Henderson finally decides to act; if he can't stop the war, then he can at least save the life of a child.
WELCOME TO SARAJEVO is based on ""Natasha's Story,"" the 1993 memoir of ITN correspondent Michael Nicholson.  Director Michael Winterbottom has fashioned a remarkable film by taking the events in Nicholson's book and interweaving them with actual footage of the siege of Sarajevo.  And he's couldn't have assembled a better cast; Stephen Dillaine and Woody Harrelson give the performances of their careers (thus far) as Henderson and Flynn, and they're ably supported by Kerry Fox, Marisa Tomei, Emira Nusevic, and a charismatic, pre-ER Goran Visnjic (who comes close to walking away with the movie).
When WELCOME TO SARAJEVO was released on VHS, one of the Amazon.com reviewers took former President Clinton to task for his ""lies"" about Bosnia, but he neglected to mention that most of the events depicted in this film (Bosnia's descent into war, the breadline massacre, the establishment of Serb-operated concentration camps in Omarska and Trnopolje) took place when George H.W. Bush was in the White House.  Clearly there's blame enough to go around.  Bosnia wasn't just failed by the U.S., Britain, France, and the U.N.; Bosnia was failed by the world.  And the world should be ashamed.
As for WELCOME TO SARAJEVO, it's a vivid and unforgettable portrait of one of the most lunatic periods in recent history.  Don't miss it.",1076112000,46,2556,5.137349397590361

A British war reporter comes across a war orphanage and then one
Bosnian child steals his attention and he gets too emotionally involved with her as much as he is with the absurds of the war serb started and still controlled it. He does the best he can to transfer her to England to his own home - even if it means that he has to adopt her.

940704,5,6304938225,"I served in the US Army with SFOR.  I think this is an excellent and well done film.  It is perhaps the most accurate film that I have seen concerning the war in Bosnia.  It not only accurately reflects and shows the genocide that was carried out by Slobodan Milosevic, Ratko Mladic and Rodavan Kradzic but it also gives hints but does not quite come out to expose the whole truth.  As a soldier who served in Bosnia I will tell you the whole truth that this film seeks to poke at.  It shows how the United States acted as accomplices to Slobodan Milosevic's genocide that was carried out against the Bosnian muslim population.  It plainly shows American officials lying to the American people.  I would also like to add the Former President Clinton has seen this movie himself with actor Woody Harrelson and Mr. Clinton knows full well that he lied to the American people about what was really going on in Bosnia.  To be honest with you.... it is a truth that must be told.  I am aching to tell it to everybody I can find.  I was shocked to see the dead bodies when I was in Bosnia and further shocked to discover the lies the US government told the American people.  I think it is very important for every american to watch this film.  In order to fully understand the film I highly recommend Peter Maass's book ""Love They Neighbor.""  He reported on the war in Bosnia.",1047859200,13,1370,4.410358565737051

As the opening scene unfolded i could see that this wasn't a film for the faint hearted, that on the way to a wedding the mother of the bride is shot dead. With the film progressing and the character of Risto(Visnjic)becoming more important I felt myself being drawn into what was happening, and could not help but be moved by the scenes of the orphanage. To see how these children had been mixed up in a war that led them to losing their parents had me in tears. Whilst not an entertaining film, I thought that it was well worth watching as it gave an insight(no matter how small)into what people had to go through. The acting was great and only enhanced what was a brilliant film..but one that left me shocked and upset.",987120000,6,822,4.450331125827814
940706,4,6304938225,"Woody Harrelson plays a character, a witty and pointed American journalist, that makes it clear why the rest of the world feels a little jaded about Americans. He is perfect in his role. Stephen Dillane is a British journalist who, along with Harrelson and others, is in Sarajevo covering the war in Bosnia. It is interesting to see how headlines are made, how stories compete with one another for the headline. What is the most horrible or gripping thing to happen and who gets the scoop? It is almost disheartening really... when complete trash or gossip grabs the headlines over atrocities committed in some place in the world that the British, American, or Western European audiences want to ignore or forget. Dillane chases stories, but eventually he becomes stuck on one story only-an orphanage in Bosnia and the children who are suffering there. Eventually he adopts one of the girls from the orphanage and takes her back to England with her. Naturally there are complications and a fascinating story that makes up all the details that lead to the adoption. An unforgiving and gritty depiction (a true story) which will be unforgettable.",985564800,4,1144,4.963541666666667
940707,1,6304938225,"This film tried to do too many things at the same time. It was an attempt to portray life in Sarajevo under siege, the plight of its citizens, the efforts made by foreign aid workers, the misadventures of foreign journalists, etc. In the end, it failed in all of these aspects. Except for the actual documentary footage of the notorious bread-line massacre, nowhere did this film adequately convey the horror of the war. Even though based loosely a true story, ""Welcome to Sarajevo"" was largely unconvincing; the direction and production were poor, and the actors generally seemed to be going through the motions. Thus, in most scenes in wartime Sarajevo, the various characters seem to act as though they're stuck in some provincial bus station rather than huddled in shelters to keep from getting hit by artillery shells or sniper bullets. In some ways it almost seems to romanticize life in the city during the siege - although you'll have a hard time finding any Sarajevan today who looks back on those years with anything resembling fondness. Another troubling aspect of this film is that it tends to take a very condescending and self-serving attitude: it's basically up to Western reporters and aid workers to save the children of Sarajevo, rather than the efforts of the locals. Although the intentions of the producers may have been noble, ""Welcome to Sarajevo"" is a misleading and condescending film.",977529600,12,1410,4.978813559322034
940708,5,6304938225,"As a journalist familiar with Yugoslavia and the tragedies of its breakway states, I was prepared to dislike this movie about foreign journalists working during the siege of Sarajevo. I thought, here goes Hollywood exploiting an abomination of the 20th Century. What I saw, in fact, humbled me and moved me to many tears. Director Michael Winterbottom takes an unflinching, docudrama approach, integrating real news footage of atrocities with his no frills production. There is no exploitation of suffering here. Winterbottom has an unabashed agenda: to shock, inform, educate and enlighten. It is hardly entertainment. The result, devoid of sentimentality, glamour and a neatly-packaged denoument, is refreshingly un-Hollywood. The characters played by Woody Harrelson, Marisa Tomei in a small role, Kerry Fox, Stephen Dillane and the fine Croatian actor Goran Visnjic, examine dilemmas journalists habitually face in war zones or not: how to remain objective, whether compassion is appropriate and whether or not to become involved with a story. The journalists, part of a profession where bravado, gallow humour and stamina for drink and adrenalin go with the territory, bring these characteristics to the fore in their perilous bunker, Sarajevo's infamous Holiday Inn. The film is based partly on the true story of Michael Henderson's (played by Dillane) experience in war-torn Bosnia. Henderson, then others, cross the line of objectivity in their promise to help some of the traumatised children of the bombarded city. There are no easy answers in war. I read ... how the film moved a physician to serve in Bosnia and has been used to educate students in modern history. Who needs an Oscar with real life affirmations such as these?",974332800,56,1738,5.323636363636363

These viewers may be  simultaneously disturbed, and reinforced in their beliefs by this film.  On  the other hand, those who believe that the rival wartime Bosnian  government, led by Radovan Karadzic, was defending the interests of  Bosnia's Serbs, may dismiss this film for its inaccuracies and selective  renditions.  For the general viewer, some familiarity with the wars in  Bosnia-Hercegovina and Croatia is necessary for an  understanding of the  plot.  Lastly, the fine modern and classical music and the filming on  location in Sarajevo, other areas of Bosnia-Hercegovina, and Croatia are a  definite plus.",954720000,8,802,5.467213114754099
