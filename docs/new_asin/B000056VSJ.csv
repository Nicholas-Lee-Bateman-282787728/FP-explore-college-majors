1400561,1,B000056VSJ,I'll keep this short because there's not much to say. This is a stupid movie. In my opinion the only good thing is Brighton Hertford as Jill the sarcastic kid sister of the lead character Mike Pillsbury.,1081728000,2,203,4.513513513513513
1400562,5,B000056VSJ,"I Love Disney Channel Original Movies! They are fun for the whole family! This one is about Mike. He feels like he dosen't belong on earth. So he accidentialy sends a message to outer space telling someone to come and take him away from earth! By doing this, he has opened up a can of worms. Now a talking dog from another planet has come to help him get rid of evil aliens. It's up to Mike to save his family, friends, crush, and the world! Teaches kids to be brave. Rent it today!",982108800,2,482,4.138297872340425
1400563,5,B000056VSJ,"I don't usually like made for t.v. movies, but Disney makes alot of good ones! This one is about Mike. He dosen't fit in. He is also very smart. One day, he wishis someone would come and take him away from earth because he feels like he dosen't belong there. Well, somehow, he sends a message to space and a talking dog comes to help him because by sending his message, he accidentiall opened up a can of worms, causeing evil aliens to come to earth. Now he has to save the day. I liked this movie alot, but others didn't. I think that if you like Disney's Zenon, Smart House, Miricale in Lane 2, The Thirteenth year, or Johnny Tsunami, You'll love this movie...",982108800,,662,4.304

1400566,1,B000056VSJ,It sucked. The slug looked like what's on my bed after a night of passion,1456876800,,73,3.933333333333333
1400567,5,B000056VSJ,"This movie is so charming and fun... perfect for the kid in you.  If you are looking for modern special effects with a deep story line, this is not your movie.  The special effects are 1999 quality so there is a mix of cool practical stuff and primitive computer FX much like the kind you might find in a  Saturday morning special.
Personally, I love this movie because I remember seeing this on the Disney Channel when it came out in 1999 and some later viewings.  The nostalgia brought me to seek out this movie recently.  I really took a liking to the wacky aliens and heavily identified with the main character Mike Pillsbury being the weird kid when I was in school.  I enjoyed the ending which wraps up rather happily, but brings Mike to the understanding that he is ultimately going to be okay.",1451001600,,801,4.4520547945205475
1400568,3,B000056VSJ,the first time i put it in the VCR it almost ate the tape and i had to roll the film back in. After that it played fine!,1379894400,,120,3.3214285714285716
1400569,5,B000056VSJ,It was perfect! There were no problems with it at all. It was in really good condition. Everything I expected.,1365724800,,110,4.55
1400570,5,B000056VSJ,"I first saw this film the night it premiered on Disney channel back in October of 1999. I remember the night like it was yesterday, and over the years this film has garnered some sentimental value, and holds its place among other Disney Channel Halloween classics such as `Don't Look Under the Bed' and `Halloweentown'.

My only issue is with Disney. Why, Disney, do you refuse to release this movie on DVD? The VHS tapes are becoming harder and harder to find, meanwhile the prices for them are going up while quality deteriorates.

It seems as if more than a few people tune in to this movie every October when it is aired; in return this should show Disney that there is at least minimal interest in the movie, at least enough to keep in on October rotation.

Hopefully at some point `Can of Worms' (and `Don't Look Under the Bed' at that) will receive a proper DVD releases.",1360022400,5,878,4.509433962264151
1400571,4,B000056VSJ,Viewers are allowed to suspend their sense of reality and just relax to enjoy the funny looking characters and brightly colored scenes. See if they remind you of Jabba the Hut from Star Wars. Do you know a kid like Mike? He becomes his own hero. Maybe there is some connection to real life in this movie. We love the happy ending and resolution.,1294704000,,345,4.40625
1400572,5,B000056VSJ,"I love this movie! This is one of my all-time favorite DCOM's EVER! I wish they still made films like these. This one is hilarious! At times, it's gross with all the Alien slime and stuff. Very funny family movie. Used to watch all the time with my sister as a kid! 5 stars! Bring on the DVD already!",1294444800,3,300,4.101694915254237

7932660,5,B000056VSJ,"Honestly the most underappreciated Disney Channel Original Movie. The cast features Erika Christensen, the voices of Tara Strong and Malcolm McDowell, and 90s favorites Michael Shulman and Adam Wylie. It's a hokey sci-fi family movie thats oddly fun at times.",1509667200,,259,5.5

7932663,5,B000056VSJ,"Can of Worms is a unique treat. The story of a boy who did not want to live on Earth and sends a message into Outer Space. The puppets where very well designed, and very well preformed. The Loafer Alien is hilarious. When he offered him a job, with his funny salesman voice I was amazed.",1482969600,,287,4.142857142857143
