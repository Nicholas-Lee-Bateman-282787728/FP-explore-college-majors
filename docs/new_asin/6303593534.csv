7850810,5,6303593534,"Reminiscent of ""One Flew Over.."" but with a Garcia Marquez twist, this is one of the classics of Mexican cinema. The horror that grips you in this film builds gradually, with the inevitability of Hellenic tragedy. If you were moved by the Nicholson flick, or dig the films of Luis Buuel, this could be a rewarding experience for you.",1091577600,,333,4.661016949152542
7850811,1,6303593534,"We watched this film in Spanish class when I was in high school.  I have seen quite a number of films since then, yet this one is ingrained in my memory because it FREAKED ME OUT.  It is obviously by Garcia-Marquez, since it is such a twisted story.
Maria is a runaway bride.  She was supposed to marry Hector a while ago, but left him at the altar.  Months later, she shows up in a wedding dress after leaving yet another man at the altar and she and Hector start their romance back up again.  Hector is a magician and she helps him with his act.  Then one day, they split up in their two vans and he takes the tollway and she the freeway.  Her van (with all the animals in it from the act) breaks down and she can't figure out what to do.  A bus drives up and she asks if they can take her to a place that has a phone.  She talks about all the animals in her van and how she needs to call Hector and tell him.  The bus takes her to an institution where she walks around muttering, ""I just needed to use the phone"" and Hector thinks she has just left him again, since it's part of her nature.
I won't tell you how it ends, but let me just say that it is one of the reasons I'm glad to have a cell phone.  Seriously, though - it is a BIZARRE film and is a bit on the campy side.  If you are a huge Gabriel Garcia-Marquez fan, then you might like this film.  Otherwise, I can't recommend it.",1069113600,3,1390,3.939068100358423
