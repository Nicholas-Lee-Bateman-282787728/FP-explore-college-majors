3517621,5,B001CSM9QW,"I love this DVD - even though it is on the easy side, I use it almost every night.  Aches and pains in all areas, especially legs and feet have subsided!  I would recommend to anyone.",1282003200,8,183,4.055555555555555
3517622,4,B001CSM9QW,This is a nice video for days when you need to do somthing good for your body but don't want a heavy workout.  The stretches are gentle and slow.  I feel good after following this DVD.,1269648000,3,184,4.083333333333333
3517623,5,B001CSM9QW,"I own Mirabai Holland's Fabulous Forever Easy Stretch, which I absolutely love, so I thought I'd try this one as well.  I am sooo glad I did!  This 30-minute workout begins with a two-minute gentle standing warm-up, moves to the floor for roughly 18 minutes of stretching legs, hips, and back, then concludes with about 10 minutes of seated stretching including gentle side and forward bends.  Mirabai does all of the exercises on the beach, and it's calming to watch the surf rolling serenely onto the shore behind her.  Her directions are calm and clear, designed to relax you as you stretch.  I am glad I added this to my collection of flexibility workouts!",1237766400,20,660,4.754385964912281
3517624,5,B001CSM9QW,"Mirabai really moves you in slowly and comfortably. She makes it interesting with gentle moves and calming music. Mirabai is very pleasant & earthy and makes you feel like she's really in there with you. Before you know it, you've done the whole dvd and you feel so much better.
I follow several of her dvds. I recommend this dvd because it is a very  different & effective approach. I have tried many other exercise dvds but,  I can't keep up and I feel so discouraged. Mirabai's dvds are the best for me.
Mirabai motivates me and has gotten me up and moving again.",1220313600,15,566,4.4326923076923075
3517625,5,B001CSM9QW,"This video is excellent for the older person who has not been stretching and may think it might be too difficult.  Mirabai makes it very easy to follow.  Her explanations of what you're doing and how to do it, are clear and informative.  She offers variations, if necessary.  It is both soothing and relaxing as you learn to stretch.",1219190400,19,333,4.593220338983051
3517626,5,B001CSM9QW,"This stretch regimine really helped me during my recovery after a long illness and surgery.  On days when I was not up to doing the standing warm up, I was easily able to skip that section and only do the lying down or sitting moves.  I am doing much better now, but I still turn to this video for my foundation almost daily.  I really like Mirabai's straight forward and genuine delivery.",1392595200,,389,4.375
3517627,2,B001CSM9QW,"Although I am in the ""over sixty"" crowd, I expected more.  I go to the gym three times/week and guess this is just not as strenuous as I had hoped.",1383091200,,147,3.9
3517628,5,B001CSM9QW,"I couple this one with her cardio and it is working for me.  I've been using it for a couple years.  Her ballet training shows, but is not intimidating.  The seated stretches are a little hard for me with my bad hips, but I love the rest and skip what I can't do.",1382832000,2,263,3.9245283018867925
3517629,4,B001CSM9QW,"I brought this dvd to my family reunion and 14 of us mature folks practiced the stretching routine at least 3 mornings.  Sure, our bones made a few creaks and pops, but it was easy to follow and we all felt good afterwards. I intend to keep up the routine until I'm ready for Level 2.",1377043200,4,284,4.071428571428571
3517630,5,B001CSM9QW,"I loved this DVD because I have been lazy for the past 5 years.  I am over 70, was able to do these movements w/o worrying about hurting myself and I feel much better.  Recommend this DVD for Seniors like me who have not been active but want to start.",1368748800,,251,4.0
3517631,5,B001CSM9QW,I love Mirabai Holland's Yoga DVD.  It's perfect for seniors and I feel wonderful after doing her exercises!  I would highly recommend her DVD.,1368057600,,143,4.916666666666667
3517632,5,B001CSM9QW,"All of the exercise routines by Mirabai Holland are easy to follow yet very effective!!  Her melodic voice is soothing and she guides you through each movement, so it's easy to keep up and concentrate on your form while exercising.  Swimming and tennis were a big part of my young life, and I continued exercising fairly consistently until my 40's (Jazzercise was a favorite, along with jogging and workouts at the gym).  I'm now 66 and healthy, but decided to get back to some form of exercise about two years ago to hopefully maintain that health.  Over the years, I've learned how my body reacts to different exercises - both positively and negatively.  I found Mirabai's videos on Amazon back then, and was so pleased with her presentations that I just kept buying more.  Mirabai is in GREAT shape and unbelievably flexible, so she incorporates a few moves in her routines that I choose to skip over because my body just won't go there!  BUT ... she makes exercising really FUN (her personality and comments make you smile).  She challenges you, but I promise you won't be discouraged.",1365811200,,1089,4.75531914893617
3517633,4,B001CSM9QW,Very nice DVD.  Just the right stretches for a 50+ age viewer.  Mirabai is easy to follow and it gives you a nice workout.,1359936000,,122,4.041666666666667
3517634,5,B001CSM9QW,"I got this because I had just had major surgery several years earlier, compounded by the need for foot surgery placing me in a non weight bearing cast for 10 weeks.  I was very out of shape and wanted something easy to get back in shape.  This is very good for flexibility and is quite easy.",1359590400,,291,4.178571428571429
3517635,5,B001CSM9QW,"I bought recently four of Mirabai Holland exercise DVDs. The oldest one I have is Skeletal Fitness, a Workout For Your Bones.(I have osteopenia)
Each and every one is execllent in it's own way, because it presents different kind of exercises. I just cancelled my membership in nearby health club, because I can do better with each and every one of these DVDs at home, when ever, and I do exercise each morning, no less then 40-60 minutes.
Mirabai Holland is wonderful, inspire you to exercise, even if your body would rather not.",1337040000,2,529,4.698924731182796
8289046,5,B001CSM9QW,"I own a lot, and I mean really a lot, of different kinds of exercise DVDs. My overall favorite is Mirabai Holland's Moving Free Longevity Solution: Flexibility Level 1 DVD. So much so, that I purchased another one just in case something unforeseen happens to my other DVD someday. It offers a great stretching routine, plus, I end the session feeling very calm and relaxed.",1525132800,,373,4.753846153846154
8289047,5,B001CSM9QW,"I really love this DVD.  I could actually do it, and I felt SO GOOD after doing it!  I'm pretty out of shape, even though I'm in my 50's, so this is a gentle way to get back into shape a little, and build some flexibility.  I recommend for those trying to just feel better!",1487808000,,273,3.9272727272727272

8289050,5,B001CSM9QW,"I especially like Holland's warmups for her exercise videos. They are always carefully demonstrated and paced. I now have at least 4 of her DVD's, just for the variety.",1424304000,,168,4.827586206896552
8289051,5,B001CSM9QW,"Nice, easy stretches for the beginner or someone who needs a light stretch.",1407283200,,75,4.846153846153846
8289052,4,B001CSM9QW,"This is a good exercise to help with my range of motion in my right shoulder.  I did feel better after doing it.  I set up a tv on a dresser in my bedroom and work from my bed, instead of the floor.  When I was on the floor I had to keep looking up to see what she was doing.  I also got dizzy for some reason.  I can do these, then just go to sleep.  I see that these are some of the same exercises my husband's therapist had him doing.  I have added these.  I have also found that playing wii baseball and tennis has helped my shoulder.  On the baseball I just ""pitch"" with both arms in motion.  This is a good, easy movement exercise for those who need to stretch, but are not limber enough for yoga.

I also got me a balance disc.  You stand on it and practice your balance.  I do it in front of a chair, in case I fall.  Even though I am active, walk the dogs everyday, these are different movements that I hope will keep me strong.  I am a recent retiree, 64, and don't want to keep moving.",1407110400,,996,3.8855721393034828

8289054,4,B001CSM9QW,"I exercise daily and generally consider myself to be at an intermediate level.  Being in my mid-40s, I also experience quite a few aches and pains, so I consider stretching to be an essential part of my fitness regimen.

Prior to trying this DVD, I was not familiar with the instructor, Mirabai Holland, so I did not know what to expect.  The video features Holland alone, teaching live on a beach.  She uses a mat, and the only prop required is a towel or strap for some of the floor moves.  In her brief Information segment, Holland provides and overview of stretching, including how muscles versus tendons are impacted and the differences between dynamic and static stretching.

The Main Menu offers the following options:  Play Entire DVD - Information - Floor Stretch & Core - Seated Stretches.  I have described each workout segment (along with approximate times in parentheses) in greater detail below.

WARM-UP (3m)
Holland begins standing.  She moves through a series of flowing arms movements, thoroughly opening up the shoulders.  This segment ends with an exercise similar to Tai Chi ""cloud hands,"" adding in a spinal twist.  I really liked that this warm-up was quite active and that it got the body moving right away.

FLOOR STRETCH & CORE (described as ""Stretches Lying Down"" on screen; 16m)
Holland starts this segment lying on hte back with the knees bent.  She brings in a a knee to chest, adding in a leg sliding out with a static knee hold.  She then uses a towel for a single leg stretch, bringing the leg up and to the outside.  Next, Holland lies with the legs in a wide butterfly position for a flowing series that includes a twist, bent leg raises, low bridge, and shoulder circles.  Moving to lying face-down, she performs knee circles, a quad stretch, and back extension.

SEATED STRETCHES (described as ""Seated on Floor"" on screen; 11m)
Holland first provides several different options for a seated position.  She then moves into hip circles, first small, then going deeper, adding the torso and head.  A seated torso twist follows.  Extending one leg to the side, Holland performs a twist, a slight forward bend to stretch the hamstring, and a side stretch; she repeats on the other side.  She moves through another twist with the legs in a bent wide-leg position and then a cross-leg forward bend.  This is followed by static neck stretches and neck circles.  Holland concludes the workout with an ""accordion"" exercise to focus the mind and the energy.

In general, I liked this DVD.  However, I was a bit disappointed that the entire DVD wasn't quite as active as how Holland began in the Warm-Up.  Personally, I tend to enjoy intense stretching that I can really feel, and although this practice felt good, I definitely did not feel it as intensely as I'd like.  Still, this is a nice video for someone looking for a basic stretching DVD.",1397433600,5,2870,4.778455284552845
8289055,3,B001CSM9QW,"I was hoping this could add a few stretches and poses to my easy yoga routine. I have physical limitations and had to limit some of my regular work outs. Sadly, this didn't have one new thing I don't already do. Passed it on to Goodwill.",1395619200,,237,4.173913043478261
