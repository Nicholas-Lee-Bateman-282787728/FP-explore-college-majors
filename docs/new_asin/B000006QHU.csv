7904844,4,B000006QHU,"When I was a kid my mom had one great pair of roller skates that she kept in a shiny metal box in the closet. Her idol had been Sonja Henie. I grew up hearing the name but didn't know much about her. This video makes clear  her skating ability, business acumen and unique charisma.
Although  Henie's technical skating accomplishments have been surpassed, no one has  yet been able to match her competetive record: 3 Olympic and 10 world  championships. She was responsible for many innovations that have led to  modern figure skating: shorter skating dresses which allowed greater  freedom and athleticism by women skaters, the technology used for indoor  ice which is still currently used, and the very notion of figure skating as  spectacle with her hugely successful traveling ice shows and film  career.
This video is also the tale of an independent woman who was  determined to do things her own way. Sonja had chutzpuh that allowed her to  make outrageous demands and the talent to be met on her terms. Her life is  an amazing story of ambition, success and search for happiness. Told  through film clips, stills and interviews with friends, this video presents  a well-rounded look at the woman who inspired America to skate.",961286400,10,1232,4.832535885167464
