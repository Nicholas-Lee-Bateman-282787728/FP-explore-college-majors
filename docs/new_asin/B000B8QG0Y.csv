2408971,5,B000B8QG0Y,Disney's Timeless Tales are just that - timeless tales. These old cartoons dating back to the 30-ties are beautifully renovated and made to look like new. I truly recommend them.,1273795200,,178,4.966666666666667
2408972,5,B000B8QG0Y,"I bought this to replace a 16mm movie that I shown for years.  It is a classic like the others on this DVD, but Hiawatha is a great teaching movie with compassion lacking in other cartoons.  Love it!",1247270400,,199,4.2105263157894735
2408973,3,B000B8QG0Y,I ordered this volume of the timeless classics because I wanted to share them with my grandchild.  This one was OK but disappointing.

2408975,4,B000B8QG0Y,"These short videos are fun. They do not have the ""in your face"" humor or action characteristic of today's entertainment. They are made for kids and do not have  violent, often bullying or hurtful, themes. They can be good starters for adult-kid  conversations about feelings, friends, etc. They encourage kids to be kids.",1169078400,,321,5.037735849056604
2408976,5,B000B8QG0Y,Disney's short subjects are the best. No CGI here; just pure and simple animation with great story telling. This is one not to miss.,1140480000,2,132,4.541666666666667

TIMELESS TALES Volume Three

CASEY AT THE BAT ( originaly a segment in Make Mine Music which is on DVD )

Here is a wonderful animated version of the famous baseball story, about a player who thinks too highly of himself. The Mudville Nine are behind in the game, but Casey, the mightiest player on the field, is due to bat in the ninth inning. Everybody thinks that Casey will win the game for his team, especially Casey. However, Casey is not only the biggest player, he's also the most vain and over-confident one.

LITTLE HIAWATHA (1937 also on the Pocahontas II DVD)

This story tells of the positive consequences of a good deed. A little Indian boy wants to be a mighty hunter and goes out in the forest to prove it. But he cannot kill a bunny that crosses his path, an act which endears him to the woodland creatures who later rescue him from a grizzly bear.

THE WISE LITTLE HEN (1934 repeat from the Donald Duck Vol #1 DVD Tin)

This historic animated short features the very first appearance of Donald Duck! When a mother hen needs help planting corn and harvesting it, Donald and his friend Peter Pig decide they don't want to work hard. The mother hen is forced to do the work herself, with the help of her chicks. When the corn is harvested and the mother hen makes delicious meals, Donald and Peter Pig find they're not invited to dinner.

THE GOLDEN TOUCH (1935 repeat from the Silly Symphonies DVD Tin)

Directed by Walt Disney himself, this story tells about the consequences of greed. King Midas wants to amass more treasure, and a magical dwarf grants him the power to turn anything he touches into gold. But Midas finds out that he can longer eat, because when he touches his food, it turns to gold. His lesson learned, Midas gives up his golden touch and all his treasures, in exchange for a hamburger.

MORRIS THE MIDGET MOOSE (1950 repeat from the Disney Rarities DVD Tin)

This story tells of overcoming adversity through teamwork. Morris is the laughingstock of the whole moose herd because he is very small with full-size antlers. Morris meets another outcast moose, Balsam, who is huge but has tiny antlers, and the two moose team up. With Morris on Balsam's back, Morris uses his antlers and Balsam uses his height to beat the leader of the herd.

BEN AND ME (1953 repeat from the Disney Rarities DVD Tin)

This is a tale of achieving great things, no matter how you start out. Amos, a poor little church mouse, comes to live with Benjamin Franklin. Through Amos's suggestions, the Franklin stove and bifocals are invented, and the opening words of the Declaration of Independence are provided.",1136419200,20,2752,4.601226993865031

8083640,5,B000B8QG0Y,"Volume 1 had 5 shorts, volume 2 had only 4, but the 3rd and last volume contains 6 shorts in all, making it the longest volume in the whole collection. The 6 shorts are; Casey at the Bat (from Make Mine Music, Disney's 8th animated feature), The Wise Little Hen (Donald Duck's debut short), Little Hiawatha, The Golden Touch, Morris the Midget Moose, and the Oscar-nominated Patriotic classic, Ben and Me. The storybook in this volume is Casey at the Bat, not quite as told like Jerry Colonna did in the short itself. After this volume was released, there was supposed to be a volume 4, but it ended up cancelled by Spring 2007, when these hour-long Disneytoon shorts collections came to a screeching halt, for a while. All 3 volumes of this collection are now in Disney Vault, need I say more? No matter if you're 2, 52, or 102, you'll enjoy all the shorts in this collection!",1438128000,,877,4.522012578616352

8083646,5,B000B8QG0Y,"Was going through and replacing all the old VHS, upgrading to DVD or better, and I couldn't believe I actually found this one. The VHS I had was The Reluctant Dragon paired with Morris the Moose, so it was nice to get Casey at the Bat and Little Hiawatha as bonuses to that which I was expecting. A new generation of kiddos will now get to enjoy the same movies I did!",1393200000,2,368,4.125
