7020370,3,B00TQGGICI,"As long as the camera stays in the 'Blue Room' the visuals -- cinematography and actors -- provide a superb sense of sex, passion, ambivalence with menacing overtones.  Once the action ventures outside things fall apart.  The script's attempts at manufacturing intrigue and mystery are all too transparent, leaving the viewer of this murder mystery bored and frustrated.  Who's guilty?  The screenplay.",1433721600,,402,5.435483870967742
7020371,1,B00TQGGICI,"I expected more from this film, judging by the star/director and the novel from which it was taken.  I'm a huge fan of French cinema and will sit through a lot of bad films just to see the country and hear the language.  So I did sit through all of this and I'm sorry I wasted my time.  I found it ridiculously pretentious.  Almaric lost sight of the project, perhaps he was too close to it. He is in nearly every frame, looking very somber and scared..or something..  Actually the expression on his face is the same if he's in bed with the mistress, in bed with his wife, in jail or selling tractors.  It's a certain bug-eyed pale look that is supposed to express something, we don't know  exactly what, but from the soundtrack we get that's supposed to be really intense.

The story may have been good as a novel  but it didn't translate well to film, at least to this one.  The themes of illicit love, marriage for money, and murder may intrigue some people.  And there's a generous amount of nudity.  But there are many other French films using the same themes that do it with style and intelligence.  This isn't one of them.  Don't waste your time.",1432166400,5,1153,4.377358490566038
7020372,4,B00TQGGICI,"The Blue Room"" (2014 release from France; 76 min.; original title ""La Chambre Bleue"") brings the story of a man and a woman. As the movie opens, we hear the moans and whispers of a couple making love. Turns out to be Julie and Delphine. Pretty soon we come to understand that they are married, but not to each other. Delphine whispers to Julien: ""Imagine what our days could be like, if we ran away"". Little does she know what is to come... Just a few minutes into the movie, we then jump to the present day, where Julien is being interrogated at the police station, but we don't know why. To tell you more of the movie's plot would surely spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this movie is based on the book of the same name by famed Belgian crime writer Georges Simeon (he died some 25 years ago). This prolific author has written dozens and dozens of crime novels, and many have been made into a movie. (I grew up in Belgium in the 70s, and he had the reputation of a giant.) Second, this movie is very much a labor of love for French actor Mathieu Amalric, who not only plays the lead role of Julien, but also directed the movie. Third, as the movie started out, I thought that this might be a ""Fatal Attraction""-type movie, but as it turns out this is very much a police and court drama. A huge chunk of the movie plays out in the interrogations at the police station, even though it is interwoven with plenty of flashbacks as to what exactly happened. For those of you not familiar with the continental European criminal justice system, you will be in for a few extra surprises, as the differences with the American criminal justice system are profound. Also noteworthy is the very unusual screen ratio (almost but not quite 1:1). Last but not least, there is an outstanding orchestral score to the movie, composed by Gregoire Hetzel, and I only wish it was used more extensively in the movie (there are long sections where no score is used).

""The Blue Room"" opened without any pre-release hype or fanfare at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati in late October/early November (it only played a week). The early evening screening where I saw this at was not well attended (less than 10 people) but frankly I was surprised there were even that many people for this. Bottom line: I thought that ""The Blue Room"" was a nice change of pace from the crime dramas that we are used to in the US. If you like French movies with lots of talking and not much 'action' per se, I'd readily recommend you check this out. be it on Amazon Instant Video or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1428019200,16,2652,4.454732510288066
8702812,4,B00TQGGICI,"I watched this movie with my wife.  It held our attention.  It's rated R for sexual content including graphic nudity. So I was hoping it would get us warmed up for the bedroom, but not so much... It's a French movie with English subtitles.",1517875200,2,239,4.409090909090909

8702816,5,B00TQGGICI,"From my Inquirer print review:

We enter actor-director Mathieu Amalric's startling, challenging, and spectacular postmodern murder mystery The Blue Room in the most intimate place imaginable: in a hotel room, in bed, in the space between two naked bodies.

A montage of extreme close-ups - her thighs, his hands, her belly, his shoulders - discloses, piecemeal, the couple whose names we learn much later are Esther Despierre (Stphanie Clau) and Julien Gahyde (Amalric).

Old friends from high school who haven't seen each other in 20 years, the lovers are married - she to a wealthy pharmacist, he to a pliant housewife eager to please him - when they reconnect for an explosive, passionate affair.

Their lovemaking is interrupted when Esther bites Julien's lip, drawing blood.

""Could you spend the rest of your life with me?"" she asks as he checks out the wound at the wall mirror. Julien says yes without thinking.

And so begins the end for this doomed couple.

Suddenly, we hear the voice of an unseen man ask, ""Did she bite you often?""

The man is an investigator in charge of a murder case. We realize the flashback is Julien's account of the affair now long over. And we notice Julien is in handcuffs.

Adapted from the devilishly clever 1955 novel by master crime author Georges Simenon, The Blue Room is a dazzling deconstruction of the mystery genre that turns its conventions on their heads.

Unlike most procedurals, it identifies the killer - Julien - within the first five minutes. But it withholds until its second half the nature of his crime or the identity of his victim (or victims).

We don't even know if the story we're getting is true, since the whole thing is presented from Julien's point of view. And he's a killer. Isn't he?

Amalric's brilliant conceit is to give us the story as recounted by Julien to a series of interrogators - the police, the examining magistrate, the prison psychiatrist, the judge, and so on. In turn, they size him up, judge him, determine if he is guilty or innocent, good or bad, man or beast.

In the process, The Blue Room stages a beautiful inquest into how the various bureaucracies that control our world define who we are and ought to be.

And it forces us not only to puzzle over the facts of the crime but also to rethink our assumptions about human identity. The question ""Who am I?"" isn't a settled affair, a matter of how I think about myself, but changes and morphs as I tell my life story to other people.

Amalric handles everything with such great control and economy, we're happy to let go of our gnawing questions and doubts and let him take us for a ride.",1447891200,3,2631,4.6645021645021645
8702817,4,B00TQGGICI,"Beautifully poetic unfolding of a mystery.  The theme may not be new, but that's not the point.  Most interesting or original art is based on an eternal theme told in a new way, and this rare gem accomplishes that and more.",1444780800,,223,4.414634146341464

8702819,2,B00TQGGICI,"One must be terribly naive to be either entertained or surprised by the film.  In all fairness, it is an old story and audiences are more sophisticated today.  Still, why make this now?  Production values are fine, but . . .",1442016000,,224,4.414634146341464
8702820,4,B00TQGGICI,Very good.,1437004800,,10,4.5
8702821,4,B00TQGGICI,"Slow moving (although only 76 minutes long), starting in the middle of confusion and sexual passion, only gradually revealing exactly what the mystery at its heart even is.  All we know is that middle class Julien (expertly played by director Amalric) and sexy, cold and intense Esther (the excellent Stephanie Cleau) have tremendous sexual chemistry, if not much emotion, between them, they are both married to other people, and we soon learn something awful has happened that has caused Julien to be under intense questioning by the police.  All the other details are only revealed bit by bit as the story jumps around through a fractured time-scape.

Amalric uses the camera to underline and echo elements of the tricky construction, using odd, disquieting close ups that give us only a bit of the big picture, or pulling back to beautifully framed but distant wider shots that give us the geography, but don't let us inside.  The performances too  both by the leads and all the supporting characters  also serve the style.  Theyre all dense and meticulously detailed, but its up to us to figure out what those subtle details of behavior mean.  Is that glance a look of love?  Desire?  Contempt?  Does Juliens lawyer believe him?  Does Juliens wife suspect or not?  If ultimately this adaptation of a Georges Simenon piece isn't quite as powerful as its opening leads one to hope, its still a smart, chilling and impressive directorial effort for Amalric.",1436745600,,1458,4.950617283950617
