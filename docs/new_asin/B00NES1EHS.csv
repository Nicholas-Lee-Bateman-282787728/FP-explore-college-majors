6647734,3,B00NES1EHS,"Beware of SPOILERS!

This movie could have been something masterful and massively epic, like The Lord of the Rings of anime. The art and voice acting is terrific, but there's just so much going on in the movie that if the developers and writers would have paced themselves, the adventure journeyed throughout the plot could have easily been a trilogy. As a fan of Space Pirate: Captain Harlock, I really wanted to like this movie but there were just so many things that were blatantly changed or omitted from the original source, such as Miimi having a mouth, Harlock destroying Earth, Harlock acting like an emo (though given the revelation that he destroyed Earth with a dark matter cannon, I can completely understand why he would act emo despite that sheer Gurren Lagann amount of disbelief I have to suspend to accept him actually attacking the planet he fought of an entire advanced alien society to save), the origin story of both the Arcadia and the general backstory of Humanity's history into space were fundamentally changed, and a crammed plot filled with characters both new and familiar who didn't get fleshed out.

It simply tears my heart apart to give something about Harlock less than 5-stars but as a fan of the original, I won't accept this betrayal.",1468368000,,1270,4.821100917431193
6647735,4,B00NES1EHS,"I loved this movie to pieces, but It does have a certain issue that I need to point out.
Mainly the release.
>I bought this on DVD solely due in part to me not being able to justify the Blu-Ray price, I've bought pricey Blu-Ray's before but they are usually combo packs and are usually no more than 20ish dollars, the Blu-Ray version of this is freaking $35.95! and in limited print!, and for that price you get the English dub on 1 Blu-Ray Disk and the original Japanese version with 4 mins of extra footage on the other plus a standard clear case and some 24 page art booklet which barely warrants the price in my opinion, why not put both versions on the same Disk and package the DVD version as well?, oh right because the Japanese version has 4 mins of footage not in the ""International version"" which should have just been put in the English dubbed version in the first place, I mean...from what I've heard they are backstory scenes involving Ezra (Isola), Logan (Yama) and Nami that are supposedly important to the plot, scenes like this are scattered all throughout the film anyway so why cut them from the ""International ver.?""
I was also not too fond of the at some times ""Weird"" english dub, with strange dialogue and dumb name/plot changes.
I would have preferred Funimation or Sentai Filmworks to release this, because I was quite pleased with the Sentai release of appleseed, which included both the old and new dubs and was a Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack for only $11.95 and sentai is usually expensive!
I hope another company aquires the right to this in the future to give it the justice it deserves.",1466553600,,1611,4.558620689655172

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Captain Harlock and his skull-faced space train steam around the galaxy getting into spectacular space battles in an adventure that impresses with its dazzling CGI manga reboot visuals more than with its original story.

Unleash the dark matter! Activate the Jovian accelerator! Prepare to enter the IN-skip! You have of course two versions of the anime manga film, the Blu-ray disc you can view with the dialogue dubbed in English and of course with the DVD you can watch the original Japanese film subtitled in English with the animated epic HARLOCK: SPACE PILOT is an absolute riot for the geeky imperatives fans, very fitting for a film thats all about urgency, pseudo-science and speed. Helmed by Shinji Aramaki, this is a glorious marshalling of state-of-the-art technical expertise that boasts top-notch 3D stereoscopy, but the portentous script is too nerdy to cross over to the mainstream. Fans of the original 1970s manga-turned-cartoon Harlock and younger anime buffs, however, will wolf this down at home and in a number of key offshore markets.

While the anime film revives the situation and main characters from the manga by Leiji Matsumoto, which inspired Toei Animations TV series known as Albator in Francophone territories, where it was a huge cult hit, the emphasis of this update is much more on post-millennial gloom and environmental anxieties, rather than the originals mix of sci-fi swashbuckling and anti-Fascist subtext. Taking a leaf out of the STAR TREK sci-fi film franchise and is not dissimilar in setup, especially with the help of Helmer Aramaki and screenwriters Harutoshi Fukui and Kiyoto Takeuchi have cannily rebooted the basic concept to suit the 2013 zeitgeist. Still, the anime film will likely not to break out beyond the franchises core audience of fanboys, especially getting turned on by the attenuated-yet-busty femme characters and videogame aesthetics, the latter referenced directly at several points by shoot-em-up-style shots that herald the inevitable tie-in games.

Having it both ways for reasons made clear towards the end, the opening action far, far in the future or perhaps in the distant past, sometime after humans from a resource-exhausted Earth have scattered 500 billion members of their species across the universe in search of new homelands. The whole colonization project didn't work out so well, and when humans tried to return to Earth, a huge conflict called the Homecoming War broke out some hundred years before the plot proper starts. In the end, no one was allowed back and Earth became a kind of planetary wildlife preserve, worshipped as a symbol by its scattered, doomed descendants throughout the galaxy, while a repressive state called the Gaia Coalition governs all.

And as to the backstory, here you have the main premise is that Captain Harlock [Shun Oguri], the eponymous immortal space pirate of the title, is in perpetual rebellion against the Coalition, and flies about the universe in his super-cool-looking if suspiciously phallic intergalactic man-of-war, the Arcadia, both ship and man running on dark matter.

The plots main engine of conflict is that high-ranking Coalition leader Ezra [Toshiyuki Morikawa], who looks like a futuristic wheelchair-bound Sgt. Pepper, has sent his kid brother Logan [Haruma Miura] to infiltrate and spy on Harlock and his crew. Naturally, the kid, who looks uncannily similar to Harlock or at least goes to the same barber, starts to sympathise with pirates, especially when he learns of bitter secrets kept by the Coalition.

Either way, the dark matter ends up getting unleashed, the Jovian accelerator is activated, and then all hell breaks loose when they enter IN-Skip, all good fun as the very fate of the universe hangs in the balance. The important thing is that it should all look awesome, and with the huge amount of coin clearly spent on rendering, motion capture and incredibly detailed background work, it duly does.

The odd thing is that, especially for Western audiences used to more expressiveness in animated character design, the faces here seem to have all been injected with cartoon Botox, given how static they are in relation to the rest of teeming visual world Aramaki and Co. have created. One can only presume this is a cultural or aesthetic decision, so that everyone should appear congruent with the limited-movement look of the original series. Indeed, a lot of Japanese animation, especially more laddish fare like this, shows the same disconnect between statue-like characters and hyper-detailed surroundings. Sometimes the pace feels really dragged out by the time animation crawls to its apocalyptic end, but its hard to see how anything could have been cut without making the story even more incomprehensible.

3D Blu-ray Video Quality  Manga Entertainment presents us with a spectacular 1080p encoded image that really enhances the 3D image is so fantastic and has an incredible depth of field that is mind blowing and I do not hesitate to give it a five star rating. We also get an equally impressive 2.39:1 aspect ratio. Everything was sharp, clean, and again with outstanding detail, both in the 3D and 2D versions. But again the 3D image wins hand down and makes you get involved with the action that bombards you with every twist of the plot. But again the 3D image wins hands down for me as the people at Manga Entertainment certainly have done a most professional job. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

3D Blu-ray Audio Quality  Manga Entertainment presents us with a spectacular, with of course two alternate audio presentations of either the English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and Japanese: 5.1 Dolby Digital [subtitles]. Both are equally impressive, but the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio wins hand down, as it has a much more dynamic presentation and gives all of the speakers a brilliant surround sound experience with the big battle scenes, especially those taking place on the Arcadia are expertly achieved, with various ""bells and whistles"" dotting the surrounds and crafting a believable ambience of what life on the spaceship is like. Dialogue is presented very cleanly and clearly and is well prioritised. Also again the fidelity is top notch and with also a very dynamic range extremely wide on both of the surround tracks.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

The DVD disc contains the original Japanese film with English subtitles.

Special Feature: The Making of Harlock: Space Pirate [2013] [576i] [1.78:1] [22:48] With the start of this special documentary, that is narrated by an unknown Japanese person, but luckily it is subtitled throughout in English. We are informed that Harlocks early conception was with an early anime Japanese TV childrens series, which has had a massive fan base around the world, especially with the legendary characters. Harlocks legend began thirty years ago from the original anime series. The TV series began airing in japan in 1978 and it began airing on French TV the following year, and was a massive success and the viewing figures reached 70%, exceeding all expectations. Then suddenly it was reborn after thirty years of this legendary Japanese anime animation, because the Harlock character was so appealing to the entire fans world-wide. We see about the appearance of Leiji Matsumoto (manga) at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival in France in 2011 and which brought all the news media from around the world because of the appearance of Leiji Matsumoto. The anime film was finally completed for a big screen world premiere at the Tokyo International Anime Fair and while viewing this special we get a long sneak preview of what people were going to see when it was released in 2013. But we are informed that it was just not a simple remake, but was more of a reboot, especially with the stunning new animation visuals, while still maintaining the original story line premise. The production was led by the director Shinji Aramaki, who startled the world with is film APPLESEED, where a civilisation was controlled by computers, and the moral dilemmas faced by who monitor computers, but similarly featuring a modern message with fantastic visuals. The anime film was written by the best-selling novelist Harutoshi Fukui, whose works have been adapted to the big screen numerous times. But with the Captain Harlock in the anime film, he returns as a darker version, where Captain Harlock is depicted with his laden past revealed. But also where is also an antihero to dissipate his role in the anime film. What we also see is personal views from Leiji Matsumoto himself, where he informs us that he wanted the Harlock character to live freely by his own flag and to have his desire to live out his life by ones own creed, and to also live out ones dreams in the universe, and he also wrote the story so that people could treasure that wish. We also get to view the faces of the voice cast, like Shun Oguri, Haruma Miura, Y Aoi, Arata Furuta and Ayano Fukuda, and we also get to see an image of the One Ok Rock group who sing the theme song Be The Light. We also get to view behind-the-scene of the FX action with the extras, and how the effects were turned into the anime film, it also digitally analyses the actors facial expressions, which is then converts the data into the characters animation. The anime film used the latest up-to-date CGI technology throughout all aspects of the film, in making HARLOCK: SPACE PILOT a never-before-seen visual experience. A lot of the efforts was put into making something of this visual calibre that is inconceivable, and not just the effort and time put into the anime film, but also physical and emotionally as well, especially for something on this scale. They feel this anime film proves how imaginative and creative people can be. But with the extracts from the film, the subtitle says, What is the secret? But we get the final prophetic words from Leiji Matsumoto, where he says, Everyone around the world who watches this film, are all part of the same human race. Let us all help one another to live on this planet together. Thats the future I dream of. But what of the anime film itself, well the Japanese narrator wants you discover the answers by watching the anime film. This was a TOEI Company, Ltd production.

BONUS: You get four stunning full colour rare postcards with images from the anime film, sealed in a cellophane envelope. I have not taken them out to view them, as I do not want to spoil the unique quality cellophane envelope, as in time they will be a very rare commodity.

PLUS: The Limited Edition SteelBook has a stunning design, with nice colourful images on the inside of the SteelBook.

Finally, HARLOCK: SPACE PILOT [2013] visuals are absolutely stunning, epically in the equally awesome 3D images, that have totally awesome depth of field, but as to watching the 2D disc, I found it totally flat and totally uninspiring. Again the breadth and depth of the space vistas in 3D are simply breath-taking, in both definition and execution. For the military sci-fi fans among us, the space battles are also truly awe inspiring, and I should imagine seeing the film in 3D IMAX would blow you away. If you're a fan of manga anime animation, then HARLOCK: SPACE PILOT will appear as the culmination of decades of technological advancements in animation technology and art. It will most certainly become the standard against which all other animated anime films will be compared with for quite some time. On visuals and technology alone, HARLOCK: SPACE PILOT stands as the true progeny of trend-setting anime films. Sci-fi movies are rarely known for their astronomical accuracy, and Anime is no exception. Dark matter is thrown in for good and used liberally in HARLOCK: SPACE PILOT, but it appears more as a supernatural force than a force of nature. Technical merits are first class, but with is Region B/2 Blu-ray the supplementary material is totally lacking in something decent, but despite this, it is still a good purchase in my opinion, still that up to your personal decision on whether it is well worth purchasing, but to me it ticks all the boxes. Highly Recommended!

6647763,1,B00NES1EHS,"There is a quote from James Cameron, quite visible on the cover jacket and the Amazon promo image, that it is ""Mythic, epic, and visually unprecedented, ""Harlock"" will take you to a whole new universe of ideas"". If that quote is legitimate, it must come from a very different movie than what I saw, or there were epic quantities of hookers and blow involved. This movie is a giant steaming pile of manure.

The dialog is written poorly, and the english language actors were enthusiastic about the film insofar as it provided a paycheck. I tried the dubbed and subtitled versions, and neither makes a lot of sense. (Maybe the Japanese language iteration is better but I wouldn't know, given that I do not speak it.) Character motivations are barely comprehensible, and their actions do not make sense outside the imaginary universe in the mind of a 6-year-old on a screaming high following the entire jumbo box of Frosted Crunchy Sugar Bombs. The story itself is not presented well, despite clumsy info dumps before and during the movie, in tiresome voice-overs and flashbacks. The Arcadia itself is a very different vessel from previous incarnations, with an appearance and abilities that would make it more at home in the Warhammer 40,000 milieu as a Chaos-infected vessel; suggesting I didn't like this new look is something of an understatement.

The only nice thing I can say about this movie is that the animation was nicely executed. Otherwise, this is a trainwreck of decaying animal parts in a nuclear waste storage facility during an outbreak of Space Herpes. I have since sent this along to the local library for their regular fundraiser where it might find a more appreciative home.  Or wind up as a coffee coaster.",1433635200,7,1726,4.863945578231292

WOWZERS!  What a visual treat!  This is a photo-realistic anime that is simply stunning and breathtaking to watch.
Set thousands of years in the future when Humanity has come to terms with it's impending extinction due to a failure to thrive in the Universe at large and in the aftermath of the Homecoming War where Earth has been declared an off-limits sanctuary by the Gaia Corporation headed up by the all powerful All-Father - Harlock - Space Pirate follows the footsteps of one would-be pirate recruit who just happens to be a spy for the Gaia Corporation - or is he something more perhaps  because he does bare a remarkable resemblece to the heavily scarred Captain Harlock - who was once the most decorated officer in the Gaia Space Navy.
Harlock is on what he considers to be a sacred mission - to reset the Genesis Clock and cause creation to start anew in the Universe - let's leave aside the fact that he would be wiping out Humanity in the process.
Or is Harlock's real mission to reset himself and give himself a new life and new beginning since the dark matter that powers his deathship Space Battle Cruiser has made him immortal?
Without giving away too many SPOILERS, Jeff H. and I thought the answer was a resounding YES to both of these questions.
You don't need to be acquainted with the original anime to love this movie.

The movie starts off with some back story and why things are happening. Then we see one of the main charactors of the movie trying to get aboard the aracadia to get rid of harlock. I don't what to give to much away but you can expect to see good story telling great action, we also get space battles between the aracadia and the enemy fleet. The aracadia itself has a lot of guns and plenty of fire power its cool to see the guns of the ship moving side to side while its firing at their targets.

Way off in the future, mankind has set up colonies on other worlds, but has left the Earth behind mostly because of it being ravaged by centuries of abuse. But now, overpopulation throughout the galaxy has lead humans to want to return to their planet of origin. This lead to a new government called the Gaia Sanction being formed allowing only the elite to be allowed access to Earth. Harlock, a former space fleet captain broke away from the government and has spent the last century leading a crew of rebels on raids against the Gaia Sanction. Harlock himself has become seemingly immortal due to being exposed by the dark matter that powers his ship, the Arcadia, that and alliance he's formed with Miime, the last of a race of space elves who wish to see peace return to the galaxy. A government spy named Yama joins the Aracdia and plans to sabotage Harlock's efforts to use a special weapon to set back the clock. Whether this means to go back in time or to completely rewrite the timeline completely(like in Star Trek 11), is unknown, as its revealed that the Earth itself has been a wasteland for centuries, but Yama has proof that life is returning to it. So the Arcadia's crew plans to fight the Gaia Sanction to preserve the Earth and expose their conspiracy to the rest of the galaxy.

Shinji Aramaki's work on other popular titles like Starship Troopers and Halo shows in this for adapting an existing canon, although they rewrite it enough to make this film its own story, so its not necessary to have seen any of the previous Matsumoto anime like Harlock Saga or Arcada Of My Youth. Harlock: Space Pirates stands good enough on its own as an epic space opera, and worthy of the brand of ""space opera"", more so than most sci-fi anime production from the last decade outside of Gundam. Its slightly disappointing that their isn't an English version of this currently available on Blu Ray, only on DVD at this time. Certainly worth a viewing if the last few Star Wars incarnations have left you unfulfilled.",1528243200,,2243,4.719387755102041

There are many combo sets that have the original Japanese as the only language on the bluray and english on the DVD.

8677600,1,B00NES1EHS,This movie fails on so many levels. Save your time and money the older Harlock series. Cause this movie is trash.,1515974400,,113,4.428571428571429

8677603,4,B00NES1EHS,"Many years into the future, battle has been raging across the galaxies as 500 billion humans, whose forebears were exiled from Earth, plan to return to what is still called home but the Gaia Collective (a bunch of self-righteous old guys) has forbidden returning. The pirates need one more guy, they find Logan and bring him aboard. I really don't and can't say too much because there are twists and turns. That is the don't and as for the can't there were some things that I just didn't get. A lot of anime goes right over my head but as is the case here, it is visually beautiful and I did have my own ideas of what was happening and why. The characters were terrific and the action is non-stop. I don't really watch many anime movies but this is one I'm glad that I did.",1486252800,,773,4.301369863013699
