8209953,1,B000TKCAM2,"Both technical quality and content are terrible. Content is 20+ years old, video is washed out, and DVD has skips / dropouts in several locations (probably from the one-off duplication). Host is a powerboat person who apparently knows very little about sailboats, and video spends several minutes at the beginning explaining very basic boating terms (bow, stern, port, starboard, etc.) that anyone who's been on a boat more than once would already know.

Returned mine with a vow not to buy anything else from Bennett Marine until they update their library to something from this century.",1410566400,,588,5.125
8209954,2,B000TKCAM2,"This video provides only very basic information about boat buying.  The first ten minutes are spent learning terms like ""bow"" and ""stern.""  I was expecting more specific information on buying a sailboat like common trouble spots, things to look for on older boats, information on blistering problems, etc.  This video provides none of that.  If you have been on a boat, and you have purchased a used car, you already have the knowledge that this video would teach you. It also appears to be about 15yrs old.  If you have no prior boating knowledge, or have never bought/insured a vehicle or boat, this video may be of some interest to you.",991094400,7,639,4.7207207207207205
