It's good for a beginner, but someone who has played for a long time and is looking to fine tune the swing should probably look elsewhere.  Also, don't buy ""The Championship Softball Hitting System"" if you buy ""The Art of Hitting Slow Pitch Softball"", they are the EXACT same video, but ""Art"" has 15 extra minutes, so this is the one to get between the two.  Don't waste your money on both, like I did.",1094601600,4,466,4.458823529411765
7830446,5,630275853X,"Consice, to the point, very well layed out in easy to follow steps. If you don't learn to hit better with this video....take up another sport.",1091059200,3,142,4.5

7830448,4,630275853X,"Bob Campbell's video has a lot of tips and nuggets to remember when hitting slow pitch.  He stresses a good clean and fluid motion.  This video will be helpful for people who have hit a little bit but want to get better.  I think this is especially true for people who have played baseball but not softball.
The purpose of his video is really in keeping solid mechanics throughout the swing.  His points are easy to remeber,easy to follow, and make complete sense.  After watching his video, I could easily see holes in my own swing!",992736000,5,533,4.510416666666667
7830449,1,630275853X,This guy has no swing to emulate.  He doesn't break down the hitting system to something that one can work with.  The information sometimes conflicts with what he shows you on the video.  He lunges at the ball and  I'm sure he has no power.,949881600,9,240,4.266666666666667
