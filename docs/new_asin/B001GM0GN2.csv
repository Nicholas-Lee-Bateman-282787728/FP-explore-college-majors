3615347,5,B001GM0GN2,Elton John in his element with his band in a greatest hits performance. Excellent visuals and stage props make this DVD unique. Behind the scenes DVD and 2-cd's of the performance complete the box set.,1381622400,4,201,4.771428571428571
3615348,5,B001GM0GN2,"This single disc of Elton John's Las Vegas performance is well recorded and produced.  If you liked this disc, you'll love the 4-Disc version -
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JGRBCE/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Don't be fooled by the listing of the box only having 3-disc.  There are four.  This four disc box set is one of Elton John's most expansive. The first DVD is the actual concert at Caesar's Palace with fourteen songs played to perfection in front of a 4,100 seat crowd. Its Elton's famous band members combined with a theatrical show combining visual delights like neon sculptures, pop art inflatable's, pole-dancing Pamela Anderson, giant love hearts, balloons and more. Filmmaker David LaChapelle has included original videos for the backdrop for each individual song. There is constant music and constant motion awash in color. The show is much more intimate than the Madison Square Garden 60th Birthday party concert. Elton does a lot more personal talking in this great video as well. The show is available in Dolby stereo or DTS surround.

The first DVD includes the songs:
""Bennie And The Jets""
""Philadelphia Freedom""
""Believe""
""Rocket Man""
""Answer In The Sky""
""Tiny Dancer""
""Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me""
""Candle In The Wind""
""The Bitch Is Back""
""I'm Still Standing""
""Saturday Night's All Right For Fighting""
""Your Song""

The second DVD includes an in depth look at the behind the scenes setup of the theater with plenty of individual band member interviews and a great deal of personal perspective and insight from Elton John. It is a remarkable story about what brought about ""The Red Piano"" show as well as a good briefing on the Elton John band.  It's just as good as the concert.  An excellent addition.

Not to leave out this great music from a non-DVD player, there are two additional CD's that contain all the songs from the show, plus an additional one, ""I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues"". The entire set is contained in a nice 5"" X 7"" X 1"" cardboard box enclosure.  I don't know why they made that 3-disc error, when there are 4-discs.",1370649600,7,2095,4.96
3615349,3,B001GM0GN2,"I just watched Elton John's THE RED PIANO concert. Musically it's fantastic. He has just his touring band: bass, guitar, drums, percussion and keyboards: no string section or horns or backup singers other than the guys in the band. But my dog, what an over-inflated show! There's a huge screen behind the band, stretching from one side of the stage to the other, with constant videos and slides and such, and inflated pop-art sculptures (including a pair of oh-so-tasteful boobs with extended nipples) and phallic bananas (with two strategically placed apples at the base) and a phallic hotdog in a bun and legs with garters and hose. It wouldn't be so bad, if one could focus one's attention on Elton and the band...but like almost all concert videos, there are dozens of cameras, some on cranes, some on wires, some hand held, roaming all over the place, focusing on the band, on the audience, on the inflatable sculptures, on the screen, and like all concert videos since MTV made its mark, nothing stays on screen for more than two seconds. You can't focus on anything. Just when Elton is launching into an amazing bit of pianistic wizardry and maybe it would be nice to see his hands at work, we're forced to look at someone in the audience wiping a tear from her eye or something on the video screen that probably bears no relationship to the music. Fortunately, the deluxe concert package has two CDs so one can listen to the music without the constant headache-inducing visuals. (Am I getting old?)",1339632000,18,1506,4.751908396946565
3615350,4,B001GM0GN2,I was looking for a few extra's for my husbands Christmas present. He is a EJ fan from the 70's so I thought I would try. I wasn't sure since the price was so cheap. This was perfect. This is the same as the set that is selling for 25 dollars elsewhere. Is a great addition to his collection.,1328745600,4,292,3.9661016949152543

3615352,4,B001GM0GN2,"If Reg could have just done his music, then we could have had the children watch the show.  There is no question of the quality of the production.  This is a R rated production, and Children should not watch.",1323907200,5,208,4.3076923076923075

3615356,2,B001GM0GN2,I liked the video. I watched the concert about 3-4 times then the DVD started skipping around. Unable to watch video. Poor quality DVD. Like the concert but will not buy another DVD.,1406505600,,182,4.545454545454546
3615357,5,B001GM0GN2,"THE REASON I BOUGHT THIS RED PIANO TOUR VIDEO IS I WAS THERE THAT NIGHT WHEN THEY FILMED THIS VIDEO OF THE RED PIANO CONCERT. IF YOU LIKE ELTON JOHN ""NO EXPLANATION IS NECESSARY"" iT WAS A GREAT NIGHT AT CESAR'S PLALACE IN VEGAS.

  GREAT MUSIC, VOCALS AND THE BAND WAS GREAT.

  IT WAS GREAT TO SEE ELTON LIVE AND IT WAS EVERYTHING MY WIFE AND I EXPECTED, GREAT MUSIC, SONG AND THE BAND WITH ELTON WAS GREAT. I ALWASY TELL MY WIFE DURING THE NUMBER WHEN PEOPLE WERE ALLOWED TO GO UP ON THE STAGE AND DACNE AROUN ELTON FOR ONE SONG I TOLD MY WIFE ""YEAH THERE IS THE LADY IN THE RED DRESS""  I REMEMBER SEEING  HER AND OTHERS GOING UP ON STAGE DANCING AROUNG ELTON.

  SO NOT TO RAMBLE ON I RECOMMEND THIS VIDEO TO ANYONE AND EVEN THOUGH MY WIFE AND I WERE IN THE UPPER PART OF THE SHOWROOM  DURING THIS VIDEO SHOOT THIS VIDEO GIVES US A CLOSER LOOK AT THE CONCERT A GREAT VIDEO.",1402099200,2,876,4.02906976744186

3615360,5,B001GM0GN2,Sir Elton John and the entire band is so talented.  I could buy the songs on this CD over and over again.  It will never be out of time with me.  I am not saying any of their work after this time is not GREAT.  It is just what I became a FAN with  first!!,1398211200,,255,3.5636363636363635

3615362,5,B001GM0GN2,I can't afford to go to his concerts but watching the DVD gives me the opportunity to enjoy his music,1391904000,,101,4.1
3615363,2,B001GM0GN2,"I've enjoyed some of Elton's work in the past, but this live concert didn't do much for me.  Performing live for an excited audience of mostly 40+ year old Vegas tourists, the songs are ok but the quality of his voice just sounds diminished with too much time and too many smokes.  Additionally I wasn't too jazzed about him complaining (and dropping the f-bomb) about another Vegas performer, and to start playing one song and then suddenly stop, and start another one, got old quick (I realize he's being cheeky, and I understand they are still his songs, but it did strike me as annoying.)  Additionally, it's not really for kids, as, in addition to the laungage he has one song with background video imagery of a pole dancer that, frankly, made little sense to include.",1391817600,,773,4.669117647058823

 My twin  boys are not only loving the music of the '70' and 80's but telling their friends  about it and instead of playing games they do like we used to listen to the music and the vocals and then the instrumentals.
  On his one video we learned about the 2 cellos and have become huge fans of theirs also.  Watch them on you tube they play rock using cellos ... no wonder elton brought them along with ... they are from crotia awesome.. check them out",1496793600,,661,4.32520325203252

I was in my teens when Elton started entertaining and he is just as good now as he was then.(although he has toned down the outfits)but that is part of what made Elton..Watching this dvd brought back memories of my younger years and I am so glad I bought this.
