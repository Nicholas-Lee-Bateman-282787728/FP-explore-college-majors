7669714,2,B01BV7PGPO,"Rollercoaster would not play. I tried it on 3 DVD players. When you hit ""play"" it would jump back to the Hindenburg instead. Problem with the disc, not the players as I also tried to play it on my neighbor's player!",1481500800,,215,4.2682926829268295

7669718,5,B01BV7PGPO,"Very Nice Budget Collection of disaster movies.  These are some the main movies that made up the disaster genre that was so popular the later 1960's and 70's.  4 movies in a nice 2 disc set for a $10 list price that is just $2.50 per movie I would call that a great deal. If you just want to sit down and watch the movies this is a great set,. If you are looking for a lot of bonus and special features you will not find that here. You may be better of spending a lot more money and buying the individual releases. I was very pleased with this set of movies. very nice basic package with 4 of the best disaster movies made. Great collection for the money.",1469059200,2,655,4.069767441860465
7669719,3,B01BV7PGPO,"The set up of films is good, as it puts together most of Universal ' s disaster films in one place.  The quality and presentation is not on par.  Earthquake is already on DVD and Bluray with 5.1 sound.  In this set, 2.0, with a horrible print, no Universal credit at the start and 10 minute chapters like Warner Archive DVD issues.  Added with Airport on the same disc, Airport is 5.1 and same 19 chapters like other issues.  Picture is OK compared to the other issues.  Disc 2 with The Hindenburg and Rollercoaster are better, though both 2.0 sound.  After their long ago DVD issues, they have been updated to 16:9 dimensions and have a decent print used.  This could have been so much better with individual discs for each film, special features if any and more attention to quality.  Granted, Hindenburg and Rollercoaster had chapters on the older issues, they are both 10 minute chapters here.  Makes you wonder whoever put this together recorded on Home DVD Recorder and made this collection.  Universal should know better.",1465603200,7,1028,4.719101123595506

8751623,5,B01BV7PGPO,I remembered these movies from when I was a kid. Saw airport  and Hindenburg at the theater when I was about 14. I remember Rollercoaster from TV. I enjoyed them back then and still get a kick out of watching them now. Good value for all 4 movies in one set.,1529625600,,258,4.0588235294117645

8751625,4,B01BV7PGPO,"Classic disaster films. Ironically, none of these were one of Irwin Allen's.  All are good, and two are absolute classics with all-star casts and the third a great film. Roller coaster however,",1524355200,,193,5.03125
