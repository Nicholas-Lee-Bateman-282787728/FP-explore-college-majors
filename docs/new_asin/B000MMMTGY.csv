8170277,5,B000MMMTGY,What enjoyment reliving the Flash Gordon - Buster Crabbe films that I watched as youth at the local theater and that initiated/influenced the creation of the Star Wars epic films.,1227484800,2,179,5.0

FLASH GORDON CONQUERS THE UNIVERSE is the last of three Flash Gordon serials. In this one, a plague that leaves its victims with a purple spot on their foreheads spreads over the Earth. Ming the Merciless is believed responsible, so Flash and crew are sent to planet Mongo in search of a cure.
CAPTAIN GALLANT OF THE FOREIGN LEGION (bonus feature on Disc #1) was a 1950s half-hour TV show that starred Crabbe and his young son.

Disc #2 has an African theme--
In JUNGLE FEVER, Charles Middleton, who is Flash's nemesis ""Ming,"" plays his ally, Rev. Graham. Plot: the African expedition led by Buster searches for the fabled ""City of the Dead.""
NABONGA features a ferocious gorilla (named ""N'bonga"")-- the man in the monkey suit is none other than Ray 'Crash' Corrigan.
SWAMP FIRE showcases TWO screen Tarzans: Crabbe and Johnny Weissmuller (who stars in this film). Their climactic underwater fight scene caused a rift between the two actors that never healed. (Look for a very young David Janssen here in a small role.)
PLANET OUTLAWS (Disc #2 bonus) is an edited version of the 1939 serial ""Buck Rogers.""

Disc #3 consists of four hour-length westerns, including two from the ""Billy Carson"" series and one ""Billy the Kid.""
