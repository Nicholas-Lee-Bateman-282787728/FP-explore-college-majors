8218350,1,B00006AUIS,"I actually bought this thing a long time ago and learned a valuable lesson. Never buy any of the Playboy ""Exposed"" titles!

This thing was the most brain dead, lamest, low budget, piece of garbage that I've ever seen. Some guys (or probably just one guy) with a camera takes some women out to some location (a pasture, a beach, etc). The girls get out of their clothes and then he just films them doing stuff naked. No, it isn't that kind of stuff! It's stuff like cartwheels, and jumping, and clapping, and spinning around in a circle. It's like a warped version of Teletubbies or something. And the whole time, there's this horrible rock music playing in the background that would be more appropriate for a video of drag racing highlights. And this stuff goes on forever!

I can't believe Playboy let their name be associated with this.",1113350400,5,838,4.617449664429531
