705957,3,630383258X,"I saw this at a Landmark Theatre in L.A., famous for their quality independent films. Kiss of the Spider Woman was originally released in 1985 and gained Academy Award winning recognition. It was re-released after 16 years, over the summer. It's very powerful, and should make you think. The acting is dazzling by the two leads, William Hurt and the sadly deceased, Raul Julia. But to tell you the truth, I didn't like the movie very much. The plot focuses on two prison inmates in Argentina, incarcerated and tortured by their own government. William Hurt is a sensitive drag queen, who is not as innocent or sensitive as he first appears. Raul Julia is an austere man filled with politically charged passion and anger, but also reveals a different side to him. The movie exhibits the contrast of the two eccentric, two very tragic characters, and sucks the audience into their story, but for some reason, I wasn't really absorbed into its story. Despite my lack of enthusiasm, the movie is considered an all-time great by most film-lovers, and so if you, too, love films, I would take their recommendation on this one, over mine",1004745600,11,1130,4.8
705958,5,630383258X,"The movie made me wanted to read the novel in original language. Atmosphere is Latino IMO. It talkes a little while for Asian to get accustomed to all cultural background. Gradually, human's perplexed nature, complicated conceptions and assimilation of mutual recognition appeared to proof its universality. Must be older and have social life experience to understand this cross-identity story.
The DVD version for collection must sell well in the market of the 'baby boom generation'.",1001462400,6,485,5.48
705959,5,630383258X,"This is a wonderful film about life and death, and what your frame of mind is once you pass on.  I wasn't old enough to understand it when it first came out, but after I hunted down a copy of it from a going out of business sale I cherish it.  I don't want to explain it for fear of getting it wrong.  Most synopsis I've read don't do it ANY JUSTICE.

706109,5,630383258X,"Really really enjoyed this movie.  I saw it as a kid, pretty young and remembered just thinking it was confusing.  Finally saw it again and the performances were great.  You have to believe William Hurt is a Brazilian, but he does very well as a confident gay character from that time period, and Raul Julia does a good job embodying the revolutionary socialist, and the pain that comes from being someone who fights against centralized oppression.  95% of the movie is them talking in their cell, so be sure you are not showing to a hard core conservative.

I do think the film would be better without the last 10 minutes or so.  But I won't spoil anything for you.  If you enjoy thinking and emotional films and have the mental maturity to step out of your personal comfort zone, there is a lot to enjoy here and the movie will absolutely fly by.",1473984000,,848,4.467532467532467

The story was so cleverly constructed involving a story within a story and Raul Julia, my favorite Hispanic actor and the Brazilian Sonia Braga were outstanding.

It really grows with repeated viewings while you start seeing more of how the movies (being described by Hurt's character) really parallel the plot and characters as they progress.  However, to more casual movie goers the film is undoubtedly a bore.  The plot seems to progress (especially at the beginning) at a snail's pace.  This is not helped by the fact that the majority of the movie takes place within the same locale. In fact, Kiss of the Spider Woman can be so tedious and un-engaging as to make the viewer feel trapped in their own prison watching the film.

A dreary prison cell is shared by two men who, in terms of lifestyle, could not be further apart. Luis Molina [William Hurt] is a homosexual convicted for obscene behaviour, the other, Valentin Arregui [Ral Juli], is a revolutionary who has been continually tortured by the same totalitarian authorities.

As the minutes slowly pass, Luis Molina invents a story based on the glamorous cinema of yesteryear involving a Nazi propaganda film involving an unlikely love affair. At first, this extravagant display of personality doesnt bode well for the cellmates relationship, but as time and the story progresses a new kind of friendship begins to blossom.

Featuring an extraordinary Oscar winning performance from William Hurt, 'KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN has proven to be a truly timeless cinematic masterpiece.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN [1985] [Portuguese: O Beijo da Mulher-Aranha] is a 1985 Brazilian-American drama film directed by Argentine-born Brazilian director Hctor Babenco, and adapted by Leonard Schrader from the Manuel Puig novel of the same name. William Hurt, Ral Juli, Snia Braga, Jos Lewgoy, and Milton Gonalves star in the leading roles. Beyond the intrigue of the complex story; aside from the political and moral messages that adorn the script, are two performances that elevates KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN above the standard thriller it could so easily have become.

In a prison in Brazil, two cellmate, one is a cross-dressing homosexual Luis Molina [William Hurt] and aggressive political prisoner Valentin Arregui [Ral Juli] forms an unlikely friendship as Luis recounts one of his favourite films to pass the time. At first, Valentin is repelled yet hypnotised by Molina and his tale. Their relationship is a constant sparring match between two radically different but equally desperate human beings to maintain their identities. But gradually, a remarkably touching bond of friendship, fraternal love and self-sacrifice is formed.

Much of the film takes place within the restricted confines of the cell, developing the relationship between these two men but, just as I began to tire of the limitations, plot developments drop in to add some much-welcomed momentum to the story. It's almost a film of two halves, building up the bond to begin with, then showing the effect it has had on these two men as the outside world imposes upon their inside lives, and it's extremely well handled. Similarly the depiction of the film William Hurt's Luis Molina is describing is very well done too. In comparison to the ""real"" world in the cell, the film is shown with broader acting and characters, and deliberate plotting and staging. This is partly due to the type of film, which is a German wartime propaganda piece and also because it's Luis Molina's recollection being told to Valentin Arregui, so much will get lost in the re-telling. The beauty of William Hurt's performance really comes through as he narrated these segments, often making the film-within-a-film sound more enticing than it is depicted visually on screen.

The real pleasure comes from just watching these two great actors working together in the harsh prison environment. There's a definite bond between them, shown no greater than the single-take scene of Luis stripping and cleaning Valentin Arregui for reasons I won't disclose. It's a touching act of compassion that proves to be the inciting incident between the two.

KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN has lost none of its power over the years. The simplicity of its setting, in opposition to the complexity of the relationships, takes it outside time. While it's true that some of the late scenes transpire outside of the prison, one doesn't recall them with the clarity or the force of the interaction between Luis Molina and Valentin Arregui. For a film in which one of the characters has a strong political backstory, KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN is surprisingly apolitical. Although Valentin Arregui is being tortured and brutalized by a corrupt, totalitarian regime for Marxist ideals, the film is careful to keep things generic: no specific country or government is identified and no details are provided. KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN is about relationships and how one views life, not about the oppression of people in South American dictatorships.

The late Ral Juli is William Hurt's perfect foil: the rugged, macho Marxist revolutionary who must admit to being less of an idealist than his persona might indicate, and who has difficulty coping with his affection for his cellmate. In KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN, William Hurt's is the showy role while Julia's is the more grounded. Sonia Braga, who did not know English at the time, was forced to pronounce words phonetically. This approach is oddly effective since she is seen primarily in fantasy sequences and film re-creations. It emphasises the unreality of the circumstances and the cheesiness of the productions with which Luis Molina is infatuated.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The Curzon / Artificial Eye KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN film is presented in the original 1.85:1 widescreen aspect ratio and is also presented in a superb 1080p encoded image and it has a decent sharp print during the prison scenes, but the film William Hurt is describing is very soft focus, but maybe thats the intention, but its not readily apparent. Colour reproduction looks good and black levels are fairly strong throughout but some fine detail is lost in the shadows and in the darker scenes. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The Curzon / Artificial Eye KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN film is presented with only two audio tracks and they are 5.1 DTS HD Master Audio and a 2.0 LPCM Stereo Audio track as an option, but while it has a wonderful score from Nando Carneiro and John Neschling, but the film was originally shot in mono and theres nothing spectacular in the audio department in terms of stereo separation, but the film score gets prominence in certain parts of the film with the 5.1 mix, and your rear speakers get some good workout. Purists may opt for the 2.0 LPCM Stereo Audio track mix and there's nothing wrong with that at all, it sounds pretty good here. The 5.1 track opens things up a bit, however, and while the film remains primarily a 'front of the mix' production, and it spreads the score around quite nicely and effectively. The levels are well balanced and the film sounds just fine regardless what audio option you choose.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Tangled Web: Making of Kiss of the Spider Woman [2008] [480i] [1.37:1] [108:34] This is a wonderful and fascinating documentary, is brought to you by ICRA [Independent Cinema Restoration Archive], which runs almost as long as the film itself. This special feature starts off with Peter Dekom [Attorney] who is also the Founding Chairman of American Cinemateque, who informs us that the world in 1983 was not really geared up to a high quality, high profile actors and Art Film, that did not fit into any kind of genre way back in the 1980s., especially making a film Kiss of the Spider Woman which was a marketing nightmare confess that it was a daunting challenges and profound satisfactions of creating this watershed film which almost never made it to the big screen. Tangled Web: Making Kiss of the Spider Woman is a strange odyssey from novel to film is chronicled in this brilliant documentary, at one point Burt Lancaster had a real mysterious obsession and was desperate to play the part of the gay Molina, and we get to hear that  Burt Lancaster was originally considered for the role of Luis Molina, on the back of him having a comeback after his appearance in the 1980s film Atlantic City, directed by Louis Malle. But because of his frustration in taken over 12 months to get the film off the ground, Burt Lancaster decided to pull out and finally let William Hurt get the go ahead to appear in the film, especially when he read the script, he longed to appear in the film and of course his wish was granted. To get the project off the ground, they wanted Ral Juli [Actor], who was very excited and was eager to sign up, especially with everyone involved with the film had seen some of his films, but what was also interesting is that Gene Parseghian was the same agent for William Hurt and that is why the two actors got to work together. Director Hector Babenco's had an epic struggle and frustration with the author Manuel Puig, and the film was the birth of today's independent cinema and these are all chapters in the startling saga behind this timeless gem and filmmaker David Weisman's Tangled Web: Making Kiss of the Spider Woman captures many of the unique and emotionally charged moments that serendipitously turned this courageous film into a total masterpiece. We move to 1984, where they start to edit the film, which was a total nightmare, because the director had lost interest and had gone off on another project, so Mauro Alice [Film Editor] had to take charge and sort it all out himself, but informs us that it was like solving a mind-boggling puzzle, especially with the problematic in figuring out how to integrate the film-within-a-film scenario, because you never knew exactly which of the two part of the film was more important, especially the real life story taking place within the cell of the prison or the film fantasy being told as an escape. But on the first screening they found the film was well over three hours long. When it was shown at the New York Film Festival it was a total disaster, so while in New York they did a total new edit in the hope of rescuing the film. Then in 1985 it was to be given a premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, but the committee were not happy and they had to do another massive new edit to tighten up the ending, as well as having a brand new sound track done. So when the film was finally given a premiere the word went round like wild fire, with a total massive interest and you now had people flying in from The Hollywood Reporter, CBS Television network and the film distributors Island Alive who wanted to know more about the film, which in turn became a hot topic at the Cannes Film Festival. But at the end of the film being previewed by the Cannes audience it got the longest ovation ever at the Cannes Film Festival. The finally in 1985 it opened at one cinema in New York and in one week it had made $108,778, which was a total record for an Independent film of this genre and in the end because people were clamouring to see it they had to do a 24 hour screening. Because the film was so hot Island Alive were bombarded for more prints and in the end had to leave the receiver off the phone. By 1986 it was winning massive amounts of Awards and of course eventually it was entered into the Oscars and it finally got the recognition it deserved. But what was so special about this film, it was the first Independent film to win at the Academy Awards and set the ball rolling for future Independent films at the Academy Awards and of course the film changed the lives forever involved with the film and all were very proud and honoured to be involved with such a classic Independent film, that as you will see nearly did not make it to the silver screen, but of course with the enthusiasm and endeavour in making this film, it has endured the test of time. Contributors to this special feature includes David Weisman [Producer], Hector Babenco [Director], Sonia Brago [Actress], William Hurt [Actor], Manuel Puig [Author], Dr. Sam L Grogg [Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences], Patricio Bisso [Costume Designer/Actor], Ral Juli [Actor], Gene Parseghian [Agent], Michael Maiello [Associate Producer], Jane Holzer [Associate Producer], Altamiro Boscoli [Attorney/Associated Producer], Leonard Schrader [Screenwriter] and Mauro Alice [Film Editor]. This was a film by David Weisman. Producer: David Weisman. Screenplay: Leonard Shrader. Composer: Michael Hay. Cinematography: Rodolfo Sanchez.

Theatrical Trailer [1985] [1080p] [1.85:1] [2:38] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN. This is a new trailer from again the ICRA [Independent Cinema Restoration Archive]. This is a totally brilliant terrific presentation. We also get to see all the fantastic glowing quotes from all the critics who were bowled over by the film, praising this brilliant Independent film.

Special Feature: Manuel Puig Mini-Documentary: The Submissive Woman's Role [2008] [1080p] [1.33:1] [9:06] Once again ICRA [Independent Cinema Restoration Archive] brings us another interesting special that features the Author Manuel Puig [1932  1990], who gives us an audio commentary about his life story, especially telling us that he was born in Argentina and life was very poor and very rural, but the one ray of hope in his life was visiting the local cinema regular to get away from the dull existence he had to endure and would rather spend all his time at the cinema, especially watching all the Hollywood films and seeing all the glamourous Hollywood actresses appear on the screen. But in real life he felt betrayed from the Military Junta running his country, which we get to see in newsreels. But because the Military Junta knew about Manuel Puig political views against the Junta, he was ordered and threatened to leave Argentina, otherwise he would be arrested. So eventually he met loads of political prisoners that were released from jail and asked about their experiences and wrote all this information down that eventually went towards his novel Kiss of the Spider Woman. But when Manuel Puig became very successful outside his native country Argentina, people in Argentina finally got to read his novels, especially Kiss of the Spider Woman, he finally became an overnight success. But what was really nice is hearing the voice of Manuel Puig, who must have been recorded at a certain venue that was recorded in front of a live audience and sounded like the whole session was a total delight. Narrated by Beverly DAngelo. Composer: Gabriel Rotello.

Special Feature: Slide Show Commentary: Transitions from Novel to Film [2008] [1080] [1.33:1] [36:06] Once again ICRA [Independent Cinema Restoration Archive] brings us another interesting special that features an archival feature that focuses on the novel that inspired the film as well as the structure of the narrative and its key themes. Here you get the narrator talk through some of the changes from the novel to the film. You also get loads of images from the film that the narrator relates to sections in the book that are relevant to parts of the beautiful Manuel Puig novel. This is a very nice bonus and explains in great detail why the novel was so ideal storyline that was so successfully transferred to the silver screen. All in all it is a brilliant presentation and a really nice bonus. Commentary Written and Narrated by Norman Lavers. Producers: David Weisman and Sarah Weise.

Special Feature: Photo Gallery [1080p] [1.85:1] This special feature is spilt up into three separate categories, and they are Costume Gallery [00:51]; Production Gallery [7:05] and Film and Promotional Stills Gallery [7:10]. This is a really beautiful professional presentation, and you get to see some absolutely stunning images from the Film and Promotional Stills Gallery.

Finally, KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN film is a subtle insight into the value of imagination, love, and heroism carried home by the bold and touching performances of William Hurt and Ral Juli. Curzon/Artificial Eye release of Hector Babenco's KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN is very similar to the one Carlotta Films released back in 2011, which seems been sourced from the same master the French label worked with, which is quite good, but it has a bigger selection of supplemental features. William Hurt and Ral Juli are fantastic together and Rodolfo Snchez's cinematography is very beautiful. A true essential in seeing the true best picture of 1985 in all its Blu-ray glory and a wonderful tribute to the power of the  human spirit, in bringing one of the greatest and most daringly uncommercial films of the 1980s era. Highly Recommended!

This is a truly wonderful edition of the film.  Hector Babenco's work has become a classic and, by the way,  I'd like to note that his PIXOTE (1980) deserves just as careful an edition in DVD format.  For those who have read Manuel Puig's excellent novel, who have seen the Kander/Ebb/McNally Tony-Award winning Broadway musical (1993), and who saw Babenco's film years ago, this is a treasure trove.  The DVD with the extras is probably the best I know regarding precious available documentation on any film.  It's clearly a labor of love by those who produced it.  The film itself has only one fault: Sonia Braga in the leading female role.  Besides Hurt and Julia, Braga shows very little density as a performer.  The role was wonderfully played on Broadway by the legendary Chita Rivera and needed an actress of Maria Felix's charisma to do it justice.  Perhaps Penelope Huston could have been a better choice for the part.  Or Brazilian stage and TV actress Cassia Kiss, who was just becoming  nationally famous in Brazil in 1984.  Braga is a lovely woman, but she lacks acting technique and screen presence as the character who is the repository of Molina's images regarding screen divas of the 30's and 40's.",1404777600,,1389,4.781512605042017

706382,5,630383258X,"""Kiss of the Spider Woman"" is not your typical film. Similar to the novel of the same name which was banned in Buenos Aires for many years, ""Spider Woman"" is a non-linear story which begins as a character study of two polar opposites who are reluctant prison-mates in a Brazilian prison. William Hurt offers a stellar performance for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor as Molina, a troubled homosexual who also exhibits transsexual tendencies. His prison-mate is Valentin, a journalist who entered into an underground political movement and was incarcerated as a political prison. By contrast, Molina's crime was engaging in a sexual relationship with a boy.

The film begins with Hurt's voice-over as Molina while the camera pans above the hideous accommodations of the prison cell. The voice describes a character and a scene from an old romantic European movie probably made in the 1930's. For emphasis, Molina donning a decorated sheet drapes a towel over his head, re-enacting the scene of the heroine putting on her towel after a bath like a turban. The film then cuts to the actual film being described showing a dark-haired actress who appears like a cross between Gloria Swanson and Marlene Dietrich. We are now in the middle of a bygone era of glamorous film. The film in the present-moment is in color while the movie being described is in black and white, often using soft focuses and soft lighting for romantic effect. On several occasions, the present-moment story is halted and the older film is shown on-screen. One of the interesting contrasts is how the older movie exhibits plush settings, beautiful costumes, and attractive leads. The real setting of the prison is damp, dirty and just about as unromantic as a slimy villain.

During different moments, Valentin snaps at Molina, occasionally puzzled and sometimes infuriated with Molina's simplistic view of reality which seems caught up in these old movies. At one point during one of Molina's movie descriptions, Valentin realizes the movie is some kind of Nazi propaganda film. There are resisters to the Nazi regime who are portrayed as less-than-human conniving degenerates. However, Molina is oblivious to this aspect, simply caught up with the heroine and her lover, Werner, a member of the Nazi high command. Molina cares nothing about the film's rhetoric but only the romantic interests and identifies strongly with the female lead. Several times he admonishes Valentin for ""ruining the moment"" with his political talk. One of the elements which makes the story interesting is the parallel between Valentin's predicament as a political prisoner and the film described by Molina which has fascist overtones.

Much of the film is about the relationship between the prison-mates as much as a character study. Occasionally their relationship is strained and escalates into near-violent confrontation as Valentin finds superficiality with his prison-mate who is constantly moving and gesturing like the opposite sex. At one point, Valentin rages at him ""You sound just like a...!"" to which Molina responds ""Say it, just like a woman."" But over time, a strange friendship of mutual trust and respect evolves between the two men, and Valentin finds there is more to Molina than at first meets the eye.

A very different and interesting film with absolute first-rate performances by the two leads but not for all tastes and certainly not for those uninterested in material which explores homosexuality. Part of the film's rhetoric is about showing aspects of homosexual sensibility. Valentin begins to learn and at one point appreciate his prison-mate's sexual dilemma. Part of Molina's ultimate quandary is that he is more than a homosexual: he feels much like a member of the female sex and longs for a ""real man"", not just a homosexual male. But ""real men"", by Molina's definition, want real women, and he can never satisfy this desire. So he escapes into romantic films and pretends he is the star.",1394064000,,3984,5.096477794793262

If I was rating the Blu Ray transfer, however, my rating would probably be a 3 or so.  I regret to say I haven't seen the movie pre-Blu Ray, so maybe it's actually better than I think, but I know a flicker when I see one, and there are quite a few.  That's not to say it looks terrible, the colors were all good and the flickers, though present, were minimal.  Certainly I've seen worse Blu Rays, but if you're looking for a really really great crystal clear perfect digital restoration of this fantastic movie, this is unfortunately not it.

All and all this is a good release though.  With a small budget and no doubt lack of huge fan base, I'm extremely happy to have this released at all.  You can tell they put an effort to give this a justifiable release and are not just trying to milk fans.  For a non-mainstream movie, we can't expect to see the same kind of restoration of this movie as Gone with the Wind or Wizard of Oz, because I'm sure that was very expensive.

If you're debating on whether or not to get the DVD or Blu Ray, there shouldn't be much of one.  For the first part, they're the same price, and for the second, Blu Ray is the future.  Even if this release isn't true 1080p brilliance, you might as well start going in that direction.  Blu Ray gives you the opportunity to not just see the movie, but live it.

706564,5,630383258X,"There are few films that are able to hold your interest with a simple conversation.  Most movies pack on the action and suspense and travel from scenic route to scenic route in an attempt to strap you to your seat in excitement.  It is truly a rare gem, a special treat, when one is able to just sit back and watch life unfold in the simplest yet most heartfelt of manners.

That is just what happens in `Kiss of the Spider Woman'.

The film opens with imprisoned homosexual Luis Molina telling a vivid story to his cellmate, Valentin Arregui.  Molina acts out each scene in detail, and he croons over each and every word; his eyes lighting up as he reenacts the heroine's gown.  Valentin is less than impressed, at least it would seem.  Luis has been imprisoned for seducing a minor; Valentin is a political prisoner.  The two couldn't be more different, yet the two of them form a bond behind these prison walls that is unlike any you or I have experienced on screen before.

The film rarely leaves the confines of the cell, departing from time to time to tell us a story (Luis likes to explain his favorite movie in great detail to help pass the time) but the film never comes off as boring.  The relationship building between Molina and Arregui is enough to hold our interest for far longer than the films running time even, so don't be afraid that its small space will lead to early retirement.

William Hurt and Raul Julia are flawlessly compatible and brilliantly convey the true emotional connection between these two men.  Originally they were to play opposite roles, but when chemistry wasn't right they decided to swap parts, and it worked so much better.  That worked out wonderfully for Hurt (who acts down to his very tip toes), who wound up winning the Oscar for his tortured portrayal of Luis Molina.

The film is really a story within a story, as it broaches the effects of political tyranny as well as conditioned discrimination.  And then there is the beautifully woven tale of Leni Lamaison, as told by Luis Molina.  While Lamaison's tale is of political espionage it has a much deeper meaning, as can be seen when Molina tells his tale of the mystical Spider Woman or when Valentin confides in Molina of his love, Marta.  The fact that all three of these characters are played by the same actress, Sonia Braga, help blur the boundaries of reality and fiction and help portray an aspect of these men's lives that is absent behind those cold cell walls; freedom.  She represents there need to be free and she provides them escape while they are physically in bondage.  You might even be urged to conclude that they represent one another; representing Valentin for Luis and Luis for Valentin, for it is within one another that they find true happiness.

The film is expertly constructed and marvelously directed by Hector Babenco who worked wonders with Leonard Schrader's adaptation of Manuel Puig's novel.  The contrasts between the secluded confines of the prison cell to the gallant freedom felt on the Spider Woman's island are marvelous depictions of pure human emotion and help connect us to this beautiful tale.  With brilliant performances by Hurt, Julia and Braga, accompanied by a tightly woven script and a delicate hand, `Kiss of the Spider Woman' is by far one of the best movies of all time.",1225843200,5,3324,4.694827586206896
706565,3,630383258X,"To each his own form of escape. For political prisoner Valentin it is a dream of freedom with the woman he loves; for cellmate Luis it is to gain a sense of higher purpose by becoming involved with a selfless cause for a love he can never have. In Kiss of the Spider Woman film is an escape on two levels - a momentary reverie from inhuman conditions in a nondescript bastille and as pure cinematic escapism for the viewer who can become lost in a movie of thought-provoking fantasy and film-within-a-film parallels.

Luis Molina (William Hurt) is a [....] window dresser, now a convict in an undefined Latin American prison (marked simply with the name Pavilhao IV), locked away for corrupting a minor. His cellmate is Valentin Arregui (Raul Julia), a journalist revolutionary detained and tortured for his political ties. At first Valentin is annoyed by Molina's fanciful attitude as the two men clearly have opposite life views, but eventually grows to depend on his kindness - a complex relationship that becomes even more intricate when Luis begins to fall in love.

Molina passes the time by telling the story of one of his favorite films, a German propaganda feature that finds distracted singer Leni (Sonia Braga) falling for an enemy Nazi soldier, confused about whether to continue aiding the French Resistance with a plot to steal a secret map to a German arsenal, or trusting in the man she loves. As her story progresses, Molina's real life begins to imitate the embroidered fiction of the movie - for his involvement with Valentin evolves into something shockingly deliberate.

The performances by William Hurt and Raul Julia are quite masterful, with Hurt embodying a quirky and unexpected character resoundingly unique amongst major roles of the time (they were purportedly cast in each other's roles, switching when the chemistry wasn't natural). Although the story is daringly bizarre and oddly beautiful, it is the performances by the leading roles that outshine the morals of the tale. Hurt in drag with his lingering monologues and frequent one-sided conversations is a courageous role that won him the Best Actor Oscar of 1985.

Kiss of the Spider Woman's claim to fame was it's groundbreaking achievement of being the first independent film ever to receive the top four Oscar nominations, including Best Picture for producer David Weisman, Best Director for Hector Babenco, and Best Adapted Screenplay for Leonard Schrader from Manuel Puig's novel. A melancholy romantic theme presides over the muted browns of Molina's fantasy narrative and the darkly tinted blues of their bleak existence as pawns for the oppressive right-wing regime. The escapism and fantasy of Kiss of the Spider Woman is just as relevant as today, and this disturbingly singular film is a one-of-a-kind, unforgettable retreat.

706688,5,630383258X,"Based on the classic play this film tells the story of friendship, fantasy, love, loss, and betrayl. Set in a foreign prison. Two individuals--a gay man (William Hurt) and str8 man (Raul Julia)form a bond that opens the world of the mind and fantasy to escape the physical realm of their prison walls. Sadly this bond is just a facade to illicit government espionage and secrets.

This film was surely a head of it's time. Some might compare this to a ""Brokeback Mountain"" style of film. If you are squemish about a film dealing with homosexual aspects this film is perhaps not for you. Even though the film and the story is more mulit-layerd with drama and subtext to be labeled a ""gay"" film.

The acting performances are incredibly powerful and heart wrenching. Sadly, Raul Julia is no longer alive, but this is a fantastic example of his dramatic ability, when so many are familiar on a larger scale of viewer with his  performance as Mr. Addams in ADDAMS FAMILY and ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES. William Hurt does not portray a ""typical"" gay man for laughs or mocking purposes or explotation. His performances goes much deeper than that.

This film explores how we all can be manipulated by kindness and love when are at our most low and vulnerable place in our life. We all have a choice to merciful and kind, or deceptive to reach our own means. Which eventually backfire on us in eventual time.

I highly suggest reading the play before seeing this film. It might help in understanding.

This is an Oscar winning film and very much so.

Buy it and await the visit and fatal KISS OF THE SPIDERWOMAN. Will be one to enter this web of complex dimensions. Devout film lovers take note, this should be on your list.",1214438400,17,1709,4.6019736842105265

706692,5,630383258X,"THIS IS AN UPDATE-I JUST BOUGHT THE DVD TWO-DISC COLLECTOR'S EDITION). THIS IS WELL WORTH IT!! I have the VHS, and I can tell you the DVD is much better. You can see incredible detail-Luis Molina's dress colors is more brilliant, and you can see the scars and dirt on their feet because they are in prison on the DVD which is missed on the VHS.  You really miss all of that detail with the VHS. I love the DVD - if you have the VHS and love this movie you will BETTER appreciate the DVD. GET IT!!!

Luis Molina (William Hurt) is a lonely sensitive drag queen locked up in an Argintina prison with political prisoner Valentin Arregui (Raul Julia). To pass the time, Luis tells a story about a movie he seen to Valentin, who fantasizes about his girlfriend in each scene. (He's a straight dude.) Luis was actually put in with Valentin to extract information about his political movement to get parolled. Well, everybody knows what men do in prisons so they eventually do it. (No you can't see them doing sex, as it is a very tasteful movie, but they do kiss each other for a short time.) Luis eventually falls in love with Valentin activating events leading to his tragic demise; love kills.  It's a very powerful, underrated, performance. They sure don't make them like this anymore.",1129161600,8,1282,4.517241379310345

706694,5,630383258X,"'Kiss of the Spider Woman' is one of my personal favorite movies.  It is a great character study of two prisoners, an intellectual and homosexual, who pass their time by telling stories of their lives and recalling favorite films.  William Hurt and Raul Julia give awesome performances, and by the end of the movie, I was feeling for both of them as though they were real people.  An AWESOME AWESOME movie.",1083110400,4,406,4.690140845070423
706695,5,630383258X,"I remember liking  this movie when it came out in 1985 but I had forgotten just how good this movie really is. William Hurt certainly deserved the Oscar he won for his portrayal of Molina, an effeminate sex offender-- he is always in character-- on the other hand, Raul Julia is wonderful as a political prisoner too. This film makes a thoughtful statement about both friendship and what being a man is really all about as well.
I can't remember when I have seen such a realistic film. You can almost smell and taste the awful prison food that these two men eat, for instance. The sex between the two men is handled with great delicacy. This is a really fine movie that troubled me long after I saw it again.",1037318400,38,708,4.404580152671755

7853051,5,630383258X,"There's no doubt that Bill Hurt gave a well-deserved best actor academy award performance in this film; but in my mind, it was Raul Julia that had the tougher role. Hurt's character was, for the most part, a kind of silly, effeminate, theatrical, stereotypical-to-the-hilt gay man. Julia played the role of a revolutionary jailed for his subversive activities, and he was required to show all sides of a complex personality: tough, abusive, indifferent, humorous, caring, vulnerable, and so on. And Julia wasn't even nominated for his performance.

But getting back to Hurt for a minute, kudos to the genius that cast him in this role. Essentially, he was cast against type. Up until the time of Kiss of the Spider Man, we had been used to seeing him in macho, tough-guy roles (Body Heat, Arkady Renko). This great big tough guy, who sort of looks and moves like a basset hound, cast in this role?  Man, that took some imagination. Between that and his character's over-the-top theatricality, I was getting major belly laughs from Hurt's character, Molina, throughout most of the film.

7853053,5,630383258X,"What hurts this movie is Arreghi's incomprehensible credulity. As a political prisoner he would immediately suspect that his homosexual cellmate is a spy, chosen precisely for his homosexuality. But Arrreghi alternates between spouting political slogans and berating his cellmate for failing to face reality. The pot is calling the kettle black.

What saves the movie is that they both die. Arreghi is tortured to death while Molina, in a fine irony, is  killed by insurgents because of his love for Arreghi. He is not politicized, he is a man in love with another man.",1513814400,,569,5.042553191489362
