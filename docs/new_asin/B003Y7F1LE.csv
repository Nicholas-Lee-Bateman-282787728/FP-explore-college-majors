8408900,4,B003Y7F1LE,"I liked the movie.  it was interesting enough with a good plot and good acting. not a happy ever after ending, but a lot like real life.",1426723200,,136,4.037037037037037
8408901,5,B003Y7F1LE,"I watched this by chance when it was on a pay channel when I thought it was a different movie.  It's not often that I'm so glad I made a mistake but this is one of those times.

I cannot even tell you how hard this movie made me cry - and I am NOT the crying type people.  It is absolutely heart wrenching and tragic and beautiful all at the same time.  I don't need to tell you what it's about, you can read the description.  What I will tell you is that this movie is one of the best I've seen.  Out of the blue, unexpected, raw emotion.  It makes you understand how sometimes letting yourself just feel without analyzing everything is the true gift and the way we should live.  If you fall in love in a day - embrace it rather than question and doubt it.  JUST LIVE!  Don't miss this emotional rollercoaster ride - and grab the Kleenex!",1363996800,2,839,4.0920245398773005
8408902,2,B003Y7F1LE,"None of the characters in this story were likable, which is fine by me, but I can't forgive that the story made no sense and had no heart. This is especially true of Melonie Diaz' character Veronica. Maybe Veronica has committment issues, maybe she's too young to want to settle down, maybe she's fiercly independent, maybe she doesn't confuse sex with love, who knows? And she seems to have some anger management issues. Strangely, about a quarter of the movie seems to be all about focusing in on Diaz' luscious lips. Any guy watching will feel a strong desire to kiss her. Her lips are certainly better than Angelina Jolie's, and they're probably natural, but it takes more than great lips to make a movie. :-)

In order to adequately explain why the story doesn't make sense, there'd have to be spoilers. I won't do that, but I will say that the first part of the story is normal enough, when Veronica, a waitress in Austin Texas, has a fling with a Danish tourist. She's game for lots of sex but it doesn't take much to cross her. It doesn't take much for Veronica to get mad at her female friends, either. That's why I thought she might have anger issues. But that part of her personality is never explored or explained. The story starts to lose all sense when Veronica decides to visit Denmark.

I think that Melonie Diaz is a good actor. I'd like to see her in a better role with a better script. I would not recommend this film to anyone.",1359244800,,1447,4.456603773584906
8408903,5,B003Y7F1LE,"This is a wonderful film! Refreshing, bold, and lean. I fell in love with every character. Ms. Diaz gives a solid, heartfelt performance. So glad I ""happened upon"" this movie!",1300579200,3,175,4.866666666666666
8408904,4,B003Y7F1LE,"I really enjoyed this movie. I took a chance on it when IFC offered a viewing of it on Cable On Demand whilst it was still in theaters. I wasn't disappointed. It definitely was different than what I expected, but the acting is great and genuine and this really is a shining role for Melanie Diaz ( whose other really break out role in my opinion was Itty Bitty Titty Committee). Definitely take a chance on this movie. It's worth the watch!",1292198400,2,440,4.378048780487805
