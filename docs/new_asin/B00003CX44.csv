1263537,3,B00003CX44,"The year is 2025, because humans have continuously poisoned the Earth, Mars was picked as a suitable place for colonization.  For the past 20 years probes have been sent to Mars in an effort to grow algaes and by greenhouse effect to create breathable oxygen on the planet, now a team has bee sent to Mars to check how everything is going, their mission can mean the life and death for the people of Earth.
Sounds interesting?  I thought so, although the whole colonization thing is nothing new, but from what I've seen of the trailer peaked my interest.  Basically when the Mars crew reaches its destination, everything went haywired, and AMEE the robot sent along to help navigate the terrain, became a killing machine after a crash landing.  A good premise, but a poor execution.
Carrie-Anne Moss plays Commander Kate Bowman, a strong and capable individual from the Navy assigned to lead the Mars team, I (and along with many others) really liked her performance in the Matrix, and she did a good job here in the Red Planet.  The problem though is that she's not in the picture a lot, but nonetheless I enjoyed watching Moss tackling a different role than her previous movies.  Val Kilmer is Robbie Gallagher, the Mechanical Engineer on the ship, and as always Val seemed charming and often witty.  Overall there isn't enough character development in the movie, and it might be hard to identify with them throughout the film.
As expected there are a lot of cool effects, AMEE is especially spectacular, it moves like a feline and fights like a martial artist, definitely a formiddable opponent.  The score fits the eerie environment on Mars but nothing too memorable.  Red Planet was a fun and enjoyable experience, but ultimately a forgettable one.",973814400,3,1753,4.816666666666666

1263651,3,B00003CX44,"If you are looking for some exotic space creature like Sigourney Weaver, or even Jane Fonda. Then this is not the movie for you. The closest it comes to this is the obligatory shower scene. If you are looking for big ugly killer creatures or space pirates, again this movie is not for you.

What this movie does contain are the popular actors of this time. One popular actor included but overlooked in a lot of reviews is Benjamin Bratt ...Ted Santen, who shows up again in ""Miss Congeniality"" (2000) where he seems to have gotten a much higher rating.

The movie is formula with the standard mix of personalities. The Mission is like all the others. There is a compelling need to go to Mars. Naturally disaster strikes. Some sacrifice some good guys, maybe some bad guys, a few anticipated suppress, and AMEE knows the way to a man's hart.

The DVD has some outtakes that you may find enhances the film and then again the scenes may have been taken out for good reason. There is no running commentary. I am not going to transliterate the story. If you watch it for fun then you should not be disappointed.",1501459200,,1106,4.492537313432836

1264036,3,B00003CX44,"I think the biggest thing this movie had going against it from my view point was that I'd already watched - and read - The Martian. So all of the science, even what was most accurate, came across as over simplified and kind of campy to me.

It wasn't a bad movie by any stretch, but there was quite a bit of eye-rolling dialog and more than a few face palms. And of /course/ the super expensive, sophisticated, and rather creepy robot was damaged just perfectly enough to be fully operational AND murderous. I would've preferred that the robot either not be in there at all, OR that the malfunction never happened, and AMEE ended up being what took all the important science stuff back to the ship at the end (effectively removing the 5-minute romance between the Captain and Engineer, which wasn't terrible but felt more like a sticker slapped on after packaging than anything else.)

TL;DR - Not bad, worth the price of a rental, and maybe a little MST3K if you and yours are science nerds.",1459987200,3,992,4.5363128491620115
1264037,5,B00003CX44,"There is a very intelligent aspect this film has, that due to it's lack of popularity, went by unnoticed and undiscussed. Mission to Mars came out around that time, I guess they were just on a Mars streak. Both have the element of people being abandon on Mars, thought dead. This one threw a twist on it and was why I was renting it for a research article I was writing at the time. SPOILER - They sent bacteria to Mars after melting the Icecap, which contained mostly CO2, which helped create an atmosphere as the bacteria grew and created oxygen.

1264104,4,B00003CX44,"Red Planet starts off as a ""typical"" journey to Mars. Along the way you are introduced to the characters. A philosopher-Bud Chantillas who wonders if God can be found, only to realize he was near him all the time. An Agnostic-Quinn Burchenal who antagonises most all of the crew, but knows his genetics. The lone woman/commander-Kate Bowman who has to try to keep order. Pilot-Ted Santeen. Terraforming scientist-Chip Pettengill who knows more about making things grow than I do.
Can't forget systems engineer-Robbie Gallagher who also gets to control AIMEE-Autonomous Mapping Exploration and Evasion robot. I will say here that these last two are my favorite characters. The relationship between Gallagher and AIMEE is sweet, at first. The special effects of her movements and what she sees is done very well.  It heightens the intensity of how will these people survive on a planet that may or may not be liveable. Plus the cinematography how they keep the filter on the lenses so you feel like you are really with them on Mars.
It puts you in a dilemma what would you do if you had too many people for the supplies on hand? What moral upbringing will help you make your decision? Would you make the same judgment calls they did?

1264282,3,B00003CX44,"Trust me, a person should place no significance in the fact that Hollywood often produces two or more films almost exactly alike in the same year.  Certainly, Hollywood would never stoop to imitation.  Accordingly, I'm sure it was mere coincidence that WB released 2000's ""Red Planet"" just a few months after Touchstone's ""Mission to Mars.""  Life is like that.  One thing the two films do share in common, however, is that they're both unintentional disasters.  Spectacular graphics and sound cannot save a bad film.

The real question is why any Hollywood studio would invest $70,000,000 in a project, hire name actors like Val Kilmer, Terence Stamp, Tom Sizemore, Simon Baker, Benjamin Bratt, and Carrie-Ann Moss, and then entrust it to a first-time big-screen director, Antony Hoffman, whose only previous credits were for television commercials and who hasn't made a movie since.  Worse, with such an investment, wouldn't a studio have at least read the script before signing on?  OK, I exaggerate.  ""Red Planet"" is not that bad; it's just mediocre.

""Red Planet"" tells us that by the year 2025 the Earth has become so overpopulated we have to look elsewhere in the solar system for living space.  In an effort to make Mars, our closest and most viable neighbor, more habitable we send rockets filled with algae to nurture the barren planet back to life.  The idea is that the algae will need little water to pull through and will eventually produce enough oxygen for humans to take up residence there.  But after twenty years things go wrong.  The algae start mysteriously dying, and Earth decides to take a firsthand look at why.  By the mid twenty-first century we send our first manned spaceship to the surface of the red-dust world.

In a prologue that mimics ""The Right Stuff,"" the film introduces us to the crew of this estimable expedition.  First and foremost, there's the star of the show, Val Kilmer, as Gallagher, the systems engineer.  He's full of boyish charm as he embarks on the adventure of a lifetime.  The actor seems more at ease in this picture than he had been in a long while; maybe he knew what a fiasco it was going to be and didn't give a hoot.  Next in importance is Carrie-Ann Moss as Mission Commander Bowman.  You'll remember her from ""The Matrix"" films.  Her character's name is only the first of many references to Kubrick's ""Space Odyssey,"" allusions that later include a voice computer named ""Lucille.""  The highlight of Moss's exposure in the film is her exposure in a shower scene.  Then there's Terrence Stamp as Chantilas, the ""soul of the crew.""  Apparently, Chantilas gave up science for philosophy and is now searching for God and faith, a rather odd pursuit for the ship's Chief Science Officer.  He's supposed to lend the story some earnest sobriety, but he comes across as simply stuffy and glum.  Then there's Benjamin Bratt as Santen, a hotheaded copilot; Simon Baker as Pettengill, a terra-farming expert; and, last but not least, Tom Sizemore as Burchenal, one of the world's leading bioengineers and ""his own greatest hero.""  The best part of the film is trying to guess ahead of time in which order the crew members are going to die.

Each of these characters is a self-propelled clich, and together they make an oddball assembly.  I mean, what are the odds that NASA or the U.S. space agency would send such a motley gang of ragtag misfits on a billion-dollar expedition to transform Mars?  Only in the movies.

Oh, yes, and there's one other member of the team that isn't human and, therefore, gets the bulk of our sympathy--a robotic dog named AMEE, reminiscent of Ray Bradbury's mechanical hound in ""Fahrenheit 451.""  This machine is at least as interesting as the volleyball in ""Cast Away.""  And wouldn't you know it, the government not only programmed the dog to conduct scientific inquiry but to search and destroy as well.  As with HAL in ""2001,"" a bump on the head sends it bonkers early on and it spends the rest of the picture trying to search and destroy the crew!  It turns into a kind of a maniacal Robocop and provides the only thing of interest in this tedious affair.

Anyway, after a needlessly long introduction to the crew and a series of needlessly long attempts at personality development through inane and boring dialogue, the ship finally reaches the red planet and, wouldn't you know it, has trouble landing.  The filmmakers have obviously seen every Fifties' sci-fi flick in the universe, and they never shy away from any opportunity to recycle a worn clich.  That includes having the crew listen to raucous, late twentieth-century rock music.  By the time we get through the landing ordeal, the plot, what little there is of it, kicks in.  Namely, the impossible starts happening, and besides the robot dog flipping out, the crew discover they're not alone.  There are bugs everywhere.  Here we have folks traveling fifty million miles to reach a new world, and they get rock music and cockroaches?

It's clear the producers of ""Red Planet"" wanted their motion picture to be as scientifically accurate and credible as possible, judging by the care they took in rocket design, the concept of agro-farming and agrobiology, etc.  Unfortunately, in the process they forgot about a believable narrative.  There are so many melodramatic cliff-hangers, daring rescues, and hairbreadth escapes in this film, it has more in common with the old Flash Gordon serials of the Thirties than anything the last quarter century has had to offer.  Even ""Angry Red Planet"" from 1959 seemed more logically conceived than most of this movie.  And what are we to make of those pesky little insects they find on the planet?  Are they supposed to be indigenous to Mars, which would make no sense because before the algae arrived they would have had no chance for survival?  Or were they brought accidentally by a previous, unmanned Earth probe, which would make even less sense because there's no way for common Earth insects to evolve in only fifty years into carnivorous monsters capable of eating right through a man's space suit.
""Red Planet"" does not have the right stuff.  Indeed, it's pretty silly stuff.

Video:
The ""look"" of the film is generally good, and the audiovisual aspects of the MPEG-4/AVC transfer are mostly up to the task.  Something more than a single-layer BD25 might have been nice, though.  The image quality in this 2.40:1 ratio presentation always seems a tad dark and veiled, even when the crew are out in the open, and facial tones are often duskier than normal, maybe in commiseration for the fate of the poor planet.  Fortunately, we get a fairly clean screen, with little trace of age or artifacts.  Still, definition looks ordinary at best, the soft textures perhaps a result of not enough bits for the subject at hand.  The high definition serves only to make some of the CGI special effects look less than convincing.

Audio:
The lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 sound is, frankly, the star of the show.  Bass is very deep and very taut, and along with a strong dynamic impact conveys the thunderous sounds of rocket engines with authority.  Channel separation is good, the front-channels offering a wide stereo spread, and the surrounds providing a pleasant ambient bloom on the music as well as nicely calculated noises of all kinds in every corner of the room, especially during wind and ice storms that come up unexpectedly on the planet's surface.

Extras:
There's little beyond the film to speak of, no more than Warners included on their previous DVD edition.  The main bonus is a series of deleted scenes in non-anamorphic widescreen, about fourteen minutes in all.  They are no more interesting than the rest of the film.  Then, there are a healthy thirty scene selections; English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish spoken languages; French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, and Swedish subtitles; English captions for the hearing impaired; and a widescreen, anamorphic trailer.  The disc comes packaged in a flimsy Eco-case.

Parting Shots:
The inconsistencies, recurrent coincidences, corny characters and clichs, and unexplained phenomena in ""Red Planet"" cloud our ability to suspend disbelief.  The film wants desperately for us to take it seriously, in the manner of a ""2001"" or ""Contact,"" but it sabotages itself at every turn.  In the end we get merely another sci-fi wannabe, as far away from being a classic as Earth is from the center of the galaxy.  A lot of whiz-bang hardware and pyrotechnic special effects go for naught.",1434672000,,8586,4.923504867872045

1264458,4,B00003CX44,"This is an often overlooked sci-fi film that makes Mars a real place.  No, it's not shown as truly cold and bleak as it is, but it does take it from an uninhabitable world and show how it might be a tenable base.
The plot has a mission of astronauts, including Val Kilmer(Top Gun) and Carrie-Ann Moss(The Matrix), along with Ted Sizemore(Saving Private Ryan), who are supposed to either reinstate the Martian base or discover what was the fate of previous science missions.  Unlike the Ray Bradbury Martian tales, this is not fantasy but science, if a bit tenuous on the details.  In this film, a phenomenon occurs that makes a local thin atmosphere that's just good enough for men to survive.  Some Martian creatures emerge, or re-emerge, and astronauts fall to the [new] hazards of Mars.  They have a schedule, since Mars' orbit can take it very far away from Earth, so they must launch for home in that 'window' or never return.  But how can they save an astronaut stranded on the surface?  Carrie-Ann Moss(in the mother ship) has to decide to wait or safely head home, alone...There is some interplay of Russia vs. the US which seemed dated when the 'Cold War' ended but is about right now.

Again, this is not fantasy, nor is it science as we know it today.  It's conjecture(i.e. sci-fi) with a light touch of Hollywood 'poetic license'.  That's okay and it's worthwhile to tell the story.  The film generates enough chemistry in re Carrie-Ann Moss to make you care about what happens.  Together with the (just) believable Sfx and Mars as they present it and you have a good, but not stellar, film about 'a' Mars, if not 'the actual' Mars...",1418428800,,1646,4.637931034482759

I don't want to ruin anything for someone but if any one has seen Europa Report (also a sci-fi space mission which I do recommend watching) then you know what happens some of them.

There were some good parts though. I must the female captain is a badass. Yes she is was only woman and insert cheesy space romance Of course something bad happens (insert dramatic music) and the survivors are put to the test (insert more dramatic music).The concept of the movie was good. Overpopulated Earth and search for a home on another planet.

But in my opinion I believe the movie was very dramatic with a lot of ""woe is me"" scene, awkward romance scenes. Again not terrible but certainly not in my top ten faves.",1391212800,,863,4.421383647798742

Not to say it did not have an almost totally predictable plot with scenes that pretty much gave away what was going to happen later in the movie (Take Amee for instance).  But the story was nice, some of the science was plausible, and the acting was top notch.

Also-- a robot built for exploration, that just happens to have a 'soldier' mode... and locks into it thanks to the gratuitous crash landing... gee, who saw THAT coming???  On the plus side, I'm ok with the actors and their performances... if only they had a worthwhile script to perform in :-(  If you are planning your own 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' adlib party, you might want to consider this gem.

1264755,3,B00003CX44,"Red Planet was the year 2000s answer to the other major space film of that year: Mission to Mars.  While this movie seems average at times, I still liked it better than Mission to Mars and would recommend it for anyone into sci-fi or whoever likes seeing Val Kilmer or Tom Sizemore in space.  I'm pretty sure this was Tom Sizemore's only space film.

The year is 2056 and the earth has become some sort of uninhabitable place.  Due to starvation, disease or something in that category, the crew of Mars-1 must go to Mars to investigate the planet and explore possibilities of making the planet livable for humans.  Of course the crew runs into some issues, but before that happens there's a few scenes aboard the ship where we are introduced to Kilmer, Sizemore, Carrie Ann Moss, the bad guy from Superman 2, Benjammin Bratt, the guy from the Mentalist and a robot.  The robot was probably the most bad-ass character; more on that later.

The ship runs into some asteroids or some bad space weather and needs repair.  While one of them stays aboard to repair the ship, the rest of the crew leave on a pod to explore Mars where most of the movie takes place.  From there, its many shots of the landscape of Mars, which looks like a big red desert filled when huge canyons; its like going to the Grand Canyon, same thing.

The crew must find out what happened to the garden(or something like that) the previous crew had left, as an experiment to see if anything else would grow there.  I won't say much else, other than the movie plays like an episode of the twilight zone.  It's entertaining and there's a some philosophical questions raised due to the danger of the mission.  However, there's also a couple of slow parts, where we see characters just standing around or lying due to them pondering/discussing there's options for survival.  Those are needed scenes in the movie, but if felt like watching a bunch of guys on a smoke break from work.

Overall, I would say this movie is worth watching if you're even slightly interested or if you like the trailer.  Also, we get to see some early heroin-ed out Tom Sizemore before he took some long breaks in his acting career.  Also we get to see Val Kilmer who always seems to have a 10-line maximum in his movies.",1389571200,,2263,4.520884520884521
1264756,4,B00003CX44,"This movie has aged well and will be one worth watching 50 years from now. Character development is good for the most part. Not too many awkward acting scenes. I know a lot of people write bad reviews for this movie, but it's because they were expecting a different storyline, more action and special effects. This movie is more about survival and enduring horrible conditions and learning how to survive through them given what is left to do so. This movie deserves 4 stars and something in between five stars, because it brings up topics like philosophy and faith and how science will never answer certain questions we all desire to be answered.",1389571200,,647,4.734513274336283
1264814,1,B00003CX44,So some movies ask you to ride along while they use artist license to stretch the truth.  This movie goes well beyond Mars in that license.  One minute we have someone with a broken rib barely walking and shortly after he is running.  That is just example that makes this a hard movie to like.,1389484800,,293,4.290909090909091
1264815,3,B00003CX44,"Pros:
1990-2000 Val Kilmer, quality work, not his best but solid. He definitely wasn't the direct to Netflix/Video quality that he has become. (So sad).
Quality story - the life on Mars are not some giant mutant things, just bugs as it should be (well as it was only like a few decades maybe only multicellular creatures) for the movie it worked. Quality performances from Sizemore and Moss as well, they all seemed to have good professional chemistry that made me care about the characters and their own ""evolution"" throughout the film. I would say this is definitely worth watching once.

Cons:
The low Oxygen levels was not explained, it bothered me quite a bit. I know it was the story's attempt to provide the ""devine intervention"" notion, but that was even a weak point of the story. There were some definite flops with scientific concepts that made me cringe - like the unexplained Oxygen, like Sizemore's line about DNA code A's T's G's and ""P's""... What are ""P's"" a new genetic discovered in the future? The CGI for a 2000 flick was solid, there wasn't a whole lot, but what was there was comparable to some low or moderate budget films of today. Other than some of the characters shoed in for weak plot tension, the film didn't have many other cons than already discussed.

1264817,3,B00003CX44,"First: Prime's cloud copy of this film is superb H.D. home viewing! Now for the film itself: There are some good moments in ""Red Planet"", but overall it's more fantasy than science fiction with dreadful dialog and a fun, exciting, but extremely unlikely scenario. First, the timeline suggested, that is that by the 2050s humans have accomplished as much terraforming on Mars as pictured, is to stretch even an amateur space buff's credulity. Also, the Mars One ship is so massively over-designed for its small crew that it seems impossible to ever imagine how its construction could be justified. My problem with the script writers is with their wanna-be oh-so-cool rock-and-roll dialog, such as Gallagher's ""F this planet!"" nonsense uttered at the end of the film. The underlying faith vs. science theme isn't explored as well as it could have been.

Idea of using Mars as a relief for growing population.  Today, we add ~ 219000 people to the earth every day.  It costs several thousand $ per pound to launch people in space, and if the whole world decided to get all the people it could to orbit, I'd imagine we could get a few 10s of people up per year.  Then we'd have to get them to Mars.

The characters are carved from Martian sandstone, the science is wonky (at BEST) to the point of serving only to advance the plot without regard to actual laws of chemistry or physics, and the story itself feels cobbled together and predictable.

The only saving grace is the visual effects work, which was solid for the time. However, the amount of acting horsepower they packed for the mission couldn't save a story bordering on farce and, like The Core did for Hillary Swank, serves as a reminder that just because you pulled off a Million Dollar Baby doesn't mean they all will be.

1265143,5,B00003CX44,"I rarely review movies but upon seeing the greatest combat scene of cinematic history, it is time to acclaim greatness. Sound the trumpet!

Little needs to be said of this hum-drum, low-adrenaline movie. Above all, it lacks a climax. There's no point broadcasting its absurdities - say, walking 100 miles to an abandoned Russian probe without water: the film warrants no thought. Terence Stamp must be mortified at the mere mention of this film: how he ever managed to utter his God-gooey lines is a mystery; if nothing else, it's a herculean feat. Carrie-Anne Moss looks sensational and earns her pay-cheque: what a star! Tom Sizemore has nothing to do. Simon Baker looks more hittable than usual. The bug-hunt on the Red Planet itself is just that: trust me - oxygen-exhuming cockroaches are not the last word in intergalactic monstrosities. To be fair to the producers, the landscape does indeed look like Mars in all its desolation.

Which brings us to the raison d'tre of the movie: Val Kilmer's titanic battle with his facial muscles.

Who knows if the synapses that connect Val's brain to his facial muscles were gratuitously damaged in the making of Top Gun (an equally highbrow affair). Or perhaps they have atrophied away over time as Val dined out incessantly on his fame as the Iceman (surely wider forces are in play here)?

Whatever the reason be, one can sense the struggle within Val's voluminous interior as he seeks to personify this splendiferous 2-D character. His eyes are purposeful. His perfect teeth radiate menace. His ears wiggle when he is agitated. But across the wide expanse of Val's face, no signs of life are detectible. It's as dead as the dust-seas of Mars. Not from any want of trying, I imagine. The battle is lost and lost irreparably. To the loser goes another B-grade movie.

Ever so impishly, could one suggest that Val should feature in any attempt to oxygenate the Red Planet? Is he not the human lumber-yard? There could be a green shoot in all that wood . . . . .

Val Kilmer's facial muscles will not grow old as we grow old. Age shall not weary them nor the critics condemn.  At the going down of the sun and in the morning, we will remember them.",1373673600,,2193,4.6953125

1265146,4,B00003CX44,"Modest in its aspirations, the picture kept me interested throughout. While one could point to precedents in many films (starting with the two by Georges Mlis), originality in plot-line is rarely the basis, in itself, of a successful film. As  Sy Oliver and Trummy"" Young wrote:  T ain't what you do but the way that you do it"". They did it well in this one. Its a simple story, earth is dying for lack of energy, Mars is seeded by spaceships with algae which built up the oxygen  content of the atmosphere. All was working well until oxygen content began to decline. The crew  in the film was sent up to find out why.  Due to a chance atmospheric event their space ship was crippled,  most of the crew landed safely, but their necessary supplies did not. From then on, it was a fight to get the spaceship back into shape for a return to Earth and a fight for the crew to find a means to return to the spaceship. The Commander. still on the ship, has all sorts of problems as she tries to get the ship back in shape to receive the crew and to return to earth. The crew has difficult problems in staying alive and finding  a way to return to the vessel.  The usual stories of bravery, cowardice, accident, hazard, play themselves out.
Carrie-Ann Moss, the only woman, does well, as does Val Kilmer. The others, to varying degrees, make their roles count. The Director keeps the show moving along and makes almost every moment count. The technical stuff, while not whiz-bang, suit the needs of the drama and create the necessary  concern for the survival of the crew and success of the mission.
Suitable for all ages, this is an excellent buy at current Amazon prices.",1370736000,,1666,4.471947194719472

1265148,2,B00003CX44,"As far as the movies are concerned, Mars is cursed. Almost every movie set on the red planet has been a complete flop.

Unsurprisingly, ""Red Planet"" belongs to that pack of awful Mars movies. However, it is somewhat better than the typical bad Mars movie, since it basically follows the typical monster-movie formula with no pretensions of being anything new or special. The only problem is a single, massive plot hole that sucks out the center of the movie... which is oxygen-pooping bugs that literally come from nowhere.

Since Earth is hopelessly overpopulated and polluted, humanity has begun terraforming Mars. For the past twenty years, they have been sending bioengineered algae to Mars -- but then the oxygen levels start dropping, and nobody knows why. So the first manned mission sets off for Mars, led by Commander Kate Bowman (Carrie-Ann Moss) and populated by the usual baffling mix of weirdos, hotheads and a space janitor (Val Kilmer).

But when things predictably go horribly wrong on the ship, most of the crew ends up stranded on the surface of Mars, with dwindling oxygen supplies. Also, their exploratory robot has gone into ""battle mode,"" meaning that it's going to kill then in a few hours. But the greatest threat comes what has been targeting the algae: omnivorous space cockroaches!

You can tell that ""Red Planet"" is a clunker right from the opening scenes, where Moss' voiceover awkwardly tries to cram all the movie's backstory, setup and characterization into a five-minute monologue. It's as if the opening text crawl of ""Star Wars"" also included summaries of the important characters (""Han Solo is a rogue with a heart of gold"") so it wouldn't be necessary to actually develop them.

And sadly, the rest of the movie is not much better -- it feels less like a finished Hollywood movie than a first draft of the script that somehow got rushed into production. Admittedly, this is better than other bad Mars movies like ""Ghosts of Mars"" or ""Mission to Mars,"" mainly because it has no illusions about what it is about. This is basically a monster movie set on Mars, and can be brainless fun at times.

But that doesn't mean it doesn't suffer from major problems -- massive continuity errors (so the bugs poop oxygen... and yet oxygen levels are DROPPING?), dropped plot threads and head-slappingly stupid ideas. Seriously, why does an EXPLORATORY ROBOT need a battle simulation mode? And some parts of the story -- like the tortured theological musings or the romance that literally comes out of nowhere -- feel like they were stuck in just to fill up space.

But the biggest flaw in the movie is the Martian insects, which seemed to have simply popped into existence because the plot says so. Nobody ever questions WHERE they came from or WHAT they ate before the algae arrived -- they're just THERE.

All of the characters have just enough depth to blow away in the wind, and the actors are either not trying or misused. Carrie-Ann Moss does little except yell at wall panels and get naked occasionally, and Val Kilmer seems only vaguely interested in what's going on. Most of the other characters are more or less interchangeable, and it's easy to forget which one is which.

The tragedy of ""Red Planet"" is that, had it been polished, it could have been a decent popcorn flick. But the hideously contrived opening, the massive plot holes and the basic continuity errors make it painful. At least the robot is cool-looking.",1369353600,2,3454,4.850594227504245

Val Kilmer is one of those actors you either love or hate...I happen to have loved him since Real Genius, but others can find him a bit much. Carrie-Anne Moss is much underrated as an actress.

- An inept/perverted crew as the choice of Earth's finest to save mankind? (they all looked American to me which is confusing)
- Constant compromising the chain of command? (Really? Again with Earth's finest choice)
- A space ship that is so poorly designed that you can't seal individual spheres/compartments then blow the air out one by one to put out the fire?
- A fight breaks out in the last hour of life with a crew that already spent over 100 days with each other, really?
- A robot that will turn on its own crew, without a diabolical business takeover behind the scenes, really?
- A choice habitat parked near cliffs for a fabulous potential emergency landing zone?
- Seats that were meant to keep astronauts securely in place, that don't really do what they were designed to do?
- Air sealed helmets that have visible holes where the mouth is?

The Red Planet is certainly no epic, but it is far better than the average Sci-Fi. It has the right mix of action and romance. It is suspenseful and keeps a good pace. And the cast is superior to most Sci-Fi casts.

1265816,2,B00003CX44,"Set in the year 2057, Red Planet (2000) follows the crew of a spaceship sent to investigate a problem on the planet Mars.  It's a mission where almost nothing goes as planned, and the crew is soon fighting for survival on the surface of the Red Planet.  The special effects are decent, but the situations seem all too familiar, and the characters bland and uninteresting, as the film generally fails to make a solid emotional connection.  At its conclusion, the movie may leave you feeling a little flat, and wondering why you bothered to watch it.

Having polluted the planet, the people of Earth are attempting to create a breathable atmosphere on Mars, as a prelude to eventually colonizing the red planet.  Mars has been seeded with algae, which had been producing oxygen, but when oxygen levels dip, the spaceship Mars 1 under the command of Kate Bowman (Carrie Anne Moss) is sent to investigate the cause.  The first manned team to Mars includes scientists Bud Chantillas (Terance Stamp), Quinn Burchenal (Tom Sizemore) and Chip Penttengill (Simon Baker), engineer Robby Gallagher (Val Kilmer), and pilot Ted Stanten (Benjamin Bratt).

We are introduced to the characters, as they make the approximately six month journey from the Earth to Mars, but there's just not very much to hold your interest.  When the Mars 1 gets to the Red Planet, an unexpected solar flare creates a major disturbance in space that threatens to destroy the ship.  Everyone except the captain boards an escape vehicle, which is then launched and crash lands on the planet.  Bowman manages to stabilize the ship, put out some fires, and keep the ship from being destroyed, but it won't be long before the planet's gravity pulls Mars 1 down out of orbit.  Things are worse down on the planet, as the survivors will soon run out of air.

Red Planet is a great movie for masochists, as the crew experience misfortune after misfortune after misfortune, as they bumble their way along.  It's not like you form a deep attachment to anyone, but after a while it does seem like piling on.  Even a robot that is supposed to help the team, gets messed up and attacks them instead.  No matter how dire the situation appears, there's no real fear generated, as you completely expect some ""miraculous"" solution to eventually surface.  This is turns out to be true, beginning with the surprising revelation that Mars has a breathable atmosphere, and ending with a dopey rendezvous in space, and romantic journey back home.

Red Planet is jam packed with ridiculous story elements, like a four person crew manning a huge ship, and an escape vehicle than isn't designed for a soft landing.  Combine that with the multitude of screw-ups, pretentious dialog, junk science, and a ton of sci-fi clichs, like a renegade robot, and all manner of talking computers, and you have one big steaming disaster.

Unless you're a big fan of someone in the cast, there's probably not too much to recommend about Red Planet.  A major box office failure, the story makes little sense, and the repeated attempts to crank up the drama fall flat.",1327536000,5,3091,4.829222011385199

What a mistake.

Now before I go too much into why it was a mistake, let me point out some good stuff: the movie is fairly hard sci-fi (except in one or two places where script-writers obviously wanted to take the easy way out), and the plot itself isn't half bad.

For the most part the score is decent enough to stay out of the way of the movie, and the atmosphere and effects stand up to most movies being released today.

Unfortunately, the acting is tepid at best, the characters aren't well enough developed to make the audience care about them, the dialogue is forced and unnatural, and there's this weird god-vs.-science subplot that distracts from the main story-line and never resolves itself.

What could have been a movie to rival 2001: A Space Odyssey for atmosphere and tension falls flat under these flaws, and suddenly I'm watching a movie that just... doesn't hold my interest.
Sad, really. It could have been a great film.",1323388800,,1103,4.495
1265970,5,B00003CX44,"The movie ""Red Planet"" truly does stand the test of time, and quite well. The picture quality, sound quality, filming techniques, and special effects all certainly look spectacular, even by current ""decade"" later standards. All actors involved turn in an excellent performance quality, with Val Kilmer, Carrie Anne Moss, and Tom Sizemore being near their height of stardom at the point in which this film was created. Terence Stamp delivers a very ""classy"" performance, and Benjamin Bratt was never better than in this particular film. This movie also displays Simon Baker handily portraying a somewhat emotionally conflicted character, in one of his earlier U.S. based film roles. This film, ""Red Planet"", has an excellent, even if somewhat predictable story which progresses in a very solid and firm fashion, and leaves the viewer with a very conclusive ending. You will not find yourself ""wondering"" as to what the movie was truly about when the final credits roll. This is truly one of the most underrated, high quality production Science Fiction films of the past 20 years, and genuinely deserves a second look, or perhaps a first look if you have yet to push the ""play"" button on this one. The basic story description offered by Amazon, as well as the other reviews, seems to be ""spot-on"", and so I will politely refrain from simply rehashing what has already been clearly explained.

I have yet to view the Blu-Ray release, but given the spectacular picture and sound quality of the original widescreen DVD release (2001), as well as the secondary DVD release (2010), I would have to imagine that the typical Blu-Ray quality of excellence would apply. Please note, that there are two different aspect ratios available in standard ""DVD"" format release. The 2001 dated DVD offers a spectacular 2.35 to 1 format widescreen transfer, with excellent sound as well. The 2010 DVD release offers a 1.77 to 1 format transfer, also listed as ""widescreen"" in the data details. The 2001 dated DVD looks and sounds flawless when played with a nice upscaling player, and when viewed on a decent quality HDTV. EXCELLENT!!!

If you have yet to view this movie, buy a ""nice"" and ""inexpensive"" copy of the DVD (I prefer the 2001 DVD release, 2.35 to 1), and enjoy. If it turns out to be one of your Sci-Fi favorites, you can always upgrade to an additional Blu-Ray copy, later.

I am always a little dubious when a Blu-ray is released on a BD-25 disc since it usually implies cost cutting by the studio. In spite of this it is difficult to nit-pit the picture and sound quality of this Blu-ray, it appeared as good (or better) as what I remember seeing in the theater. There are several well written reviews on Amazon and elsewhere on the internet about this movie so I won't bother with the synopsis of the plot except to say it's an under-rated film. As science fiction it seems reasonably realistic although the rescue at the end seems to be a little over-the-top but satisfying in its conclusion. However I had to wonder why the crew was not given advance warning of the solar flare before it struck the ship since we already have a space agency that monitors the sun's activity 24/7. Or why do we need to take along a Mars Rover with built-in killing skills? However it is those very variables that bring excitement to the story so there you are. The reason for the mission is to find a new world to colonize because we've polluted our own planet beyond recovery - so my favorite quote is from Tom Sizemore's character: ""Man's a party animal. If he is doing okay nothing else matters. That's not going to change."" Some technical aspects gathered from the Cinema Squid website: the movie track was a total bitrate of 27.46 Mbps, the video bitrate is 17.97 Mbps and the DTS-HD Master 5.1 Surround 48 kHz / 3807 kbps / 24-bit.

A very smooth journey to Mars is interrupted by a nasty surprise that puts the whole thing at risk; the movie focuses on the efforts of the crew to correct the problem and get back home. There are problems on the ground and problems with the ship in orbit that challenges the crew and gives the viewer an exciting ride.

1266188,4,B00003CX44,"In 2000 there were two competing films about a trip to Mars ""Red Planet"" and ""Mission to Mars"".

Of the two films only ""Red Planet"" was a good movie and,unfortunately, it was released in the wake of the disasterous ""Mission to Mars"" which tainted ""Red Planet"". If you add in the lukewarm critical reviews at the time ""Red Planet"" found itself playing in theaters as empty and lifeless as the planet itself. That's a pity because the characters while they aren't the deepest have enough depth to make us want to root for them AND the visual effects, plot twists are interesting enough to keep us interested.

Although some of the CGI has dated a bit that doesn't stop ""Red Planet"" from being an entertaining variation on ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"". Although some of the plot twists aren't always quite believable the film manages to throw a couple of interesting twists our way that keep it entertaining.

The Blu-ray release from Warner (part of a slew of recent catalog titles)looks extremely good with nice detail, depth and texture to the image. Over all this is an extremely nice looking transfer with bold, solid colors and fine detail.

The lossless audio sounds terrific with interesting surround activity particularly during the action sequences in the film.

The extras are a bit underwhelming--we get eight deleted scenes and the original theatrical trailer provided in standard definition ported over from the previous edition. I don't know what happened to director Antony Hoffman (he doesn't have any other credits listed at IMDB and I'm assuming he returned to directing commericals)but it would have been nice to have him along for the ride to the Red Planet for some color commentary about the making of the movie.

This was post-""The Matrix"" for Moss and post ""Batman Forever"" for Kilmer so I'm sure the director might have had some interesting stories to tell about the two actors as their stars briefly soared in the wake of these popular films. After this Kilmer's star would falter until his marvelous supporting role in ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" brought him to the public's attention again.

While ""Red Planet"" has some structural problems it remains entertaining and involving. The transfer looks extremely nice and while the extras are a bit on the slim side, it's the movie itself that ultimately matters.

Summary of Plot:

A team of astronauts are sent to Mars to find out why the automated terraforming has failed on the Red Planet. Mars has become humanity's last hope as we've done a pretty darn good job of runing OUR planet. Along the way Gallagher (Val Kilmer)the ""janitor"", Burchenal (Tom Sizemore) the mission biologist, Santen (Benjamin Bratt), Chantilas (Terrence Stamp) and Pettengil (Simon Baker) the mission terraformer uncover the mystery when everyone but the commander are stranded on the surface. Their commander Bowman (a tip of the hat to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"") played by Carrie Anne-Moss must figure out a way to get her crew back up to the ship to return to Earth. To complicate matters their robotic device adapted from a Marine hunter drone has somehow become damaged and is hunting them.

1266189,5,B00003CX44,"I've loved Science Fiction since I was a child, both in print and film.  If I had to pick my two or three top films, ""Red Planet"" would be one of them.  I guess there are several reasons why I love this film.  First, the film presents a science and prediction of the future that is believable.  When a sci-fi film does this and has credibility it's like having a vision into the future.  This is what might happen, what things will look like.  Some reviewers have quibbled about this minor innacuracy or that.  But compared to what?  Star Wars?  Star Trek?  This film is a serious effort to depict a future that is becoming closer and closer to reality.

The second reason is because of the great human story and character presentation.  The core of the movie is really about human courage, determination and perserverance in the face of daunting circumstances.  Also, the actors do a great job and some (Kilmer, Bratt) play roles that are atypical from those they usually portray.  The visual effects, music are great.  And finally, there is Carrie-Ann Moss.  Wow!  Intelligent, strong, beautiful, tall.  What a babe!

1266323,4,B00003CX44,"This is a review for the DVD of the film RED PLANET, a 2000 film
release put out on DVD by WB in 2001.

RED PLANET is a pretty exciting sci-fi film, the kind of space adventure
that used to be called ""space opera,"" a term which I guess was a put
down of sorts. In any event, as someone who has not followed the science
fiction genre much since the late sixties I had no idea what to expect
from RED PLANET.

I was delighted to find that RED PLANET was an exciting, plausible--at
least to me-- adventure film that happens to take place in the future,
a future when earth needs better air and Mars may have the solution.
But for these first time explorers, there is a limited time to stay on
Mars and there seems to be a sort of native life form that may not be all
that welcoming.

RED PLANET is extremely well done and not a cheaply made production.
In fact, I think it's a real find, the kind of movie that could be
described as a sleeper.  In any event after one viewing I am pretty
enthusiastic about RED PLANET and give it Four Stars.",1285632000,,1038,4.098522167487685
1266324,5,B00003CX44,"I love sci fi movies.  My video library consists of even one-season televison wonders.  So, imagine my delight when I had a choice at the theatre between RED PLANET and MISSION TO MARS.  I chose to see RED PLANET, and I never regretted it.  I bought it the first day it was available on DVD.  Here's why:

This movie is as scientifically accurate as Hollywood will allow.  I'm one of those people who enjoys sci fi immensely but still cringes a little when there is sound in space, understanding that a destruction scene just isn't the same without the bang.  So, I can let that slide.  There are other things, though, that just irk me.  For example, like the fact that not every planet has the same gravity.  This movie makes a very good attempt to get the science right, including the lesser gravity on Mars (you'll know the scene).

Not only is it good for the science, but it has these very deep characters that are given time to develop on screen.  They all get to tell their stories, and there is some conflict here and there that gives it dimension.  It's a good adventure story that doesn't get campy.  The special effects and scenery are believable.  By the time you get done watching, you want to join NASA and give it a go.

At least rent this film and give it a try.  It's not flashy. It tells a good story and weaves realism in with the fiction.  It's worth the watch, guaranteed.",1274745600,,1393,4.392156862745098
1266325,3,B00003CX44,"SPOILER WARNING!!!

""They didn't find life on Mars. It found them"". That's the dramatic advertising slogan for ""Red Planet"", featuring Val Kilmer and Carrie Anne Moss (a.k.a. Trinity from The Matrix).

The slogan is, of course, bluff.

""Red Planet"" isn't excellent, super-exciting or dramatic. But then, it's not that bad either. It's definitely a movie you could watch on a Friday night, especially if you have nothing better to do. (I just did.) However, I don't think it will leave any deeper impressions. Except maybe one: you will suddenly realize just *how* bad ""Mission to Mars"" actually is! The two movies were released the same year, and ""Red Planet"" is definitely the better one. Weirdly, ""Mission to Mars"" seems to be more well known. But then, that movie adapted to the sensationalist speculations about the face on Mars and aliens. ""Red Planet"" contains no aliens and no face.

The plot revolves around a group of astronauts stuck on Mars after an accident. They have to locate a Russian-built space probe on the Martian surface in order to get back to their mothership. The usual race against time ensues, since Houston wants the mothership to return ASAP. Unfortunately for the stranded astronauts, their semi-intelligent robot Amee has ""gone mustang"" and launches a series of potentially lethal attacks on the survivors. The team eventually discover life on Mars. The good news: it can produce oxygen and save Earth from ecological disaster. The bad news: the Martian bugs eat people. After escaping from the bugs, the lone survivor realizes that the Russian probe doesn't have enough battery power left to reach the mothership. Unless, of course, he can defeat Amee and steal her batteries. And the killer robot is indeed getting closer...

""Red Planet"" also contains some covert propaganda for Christianity, always necessary in an American movie. (Unless, of course, you have New Age propaganda instead!) Have faith, guys. Et cetera.

The worst part of the movie is, ironically, the one introducing the Martian life forms. The scientist crew member calls them ""nematodes"" (i.e. roundworms), but they look more like the killer cockroaches typical of second rate horror movies. Naturally, they consume the poor scientist alive. Well, if you can't tell a roundworm from a roach, maybe you don't deserve tenure at the University of Mars?

That being said, ""Red Planet"" is nevertheless a tolerable production. Just don't expect too many magical moments from it.

1266326,3,B00003CX44,"But likable. The first time I watched this movie, I thought it was kinda boring, but now that I look back on it, it's really not half-bad. Apparently it was panned by critics and, well, a lot of people on here. But I think they're missing the point- I feel like this movie was supposed to be a brief, simple, good movie, not ground-breaking or anything. And everyone's had a jab at it, like they expected it to be amazing, which it really isn't. But trust me, it's not as bad as they'd have you believe.

Set years into the future when Earth is struggling, a group of different, good-hearted people take off into the stars towards Mars, looking for a place to relocate and recover, so they can start life from scratch and save Earth. There is the expected malfunction that renders the captain, Kate Bowman, left behind to repair the ship while the boys of the team go out onto Mars to explore and look for signs that they can live there.

So a clever, simple story plays out, with a good cast and interesting plot twists. It's got its share of dry spots, and it feel more focused on its ""gadgets"" than its plot, but I still fairly enjoy it. Everyone put their best towards the movie, and though we all knew only one person would return from the Mars mission and it had to be Bowman's love interest, Robby Gallagher, it's definitely still worth a watch.

The computer graphics are well done, and the AMEE robot looks pretty real for ten year-old CG. I like the way they made her gait; kind of like a dog. And this sounds weird, but I thought it was funny cute how the one guy playfully referred to AMEE as his girlfriend haha.

Anyways, it's a good, brief, simple movie that's just a movie, just something to keep you entertained for an hour and forty minutes. It was made because somebody had a simple, fun idea. They didn't do it to impress you, so give it a rent with just medium expectations.",1270425600,,1895,4.375
1266327,2,B00003CX44,"The problem I have with this movie is that there really isn't anything there.  I mean, it has some cool scenes, but all that said, it just falls apart from lack of any real development.

I wasn't interested.

Apparently, neither was Val Kilmer, who basically phones in a vacant performance as Robby Gallagher, a maintenance operator aboard a space craft sent to determine whether or not mankind could survive on Mars.

The film has an interesting premise, but it doesn't really do anything with it.  Some have noted that the film moves along steadily, but I found it rather slow moving and kind of dull.  I wanted to feel engaged (because even stupid movies can entertain) but this didn't do that.  It's an interesting bore, if that makes any sense.  There is basically no character development, and only a small handful of the actors (Sizemore and Moss) actually deliver noteworthy performances (if you can call them noteworthy).

I totally loved the idea of the robot turning all killer-crazy, but that was the most interesting aspect of the film, and it fails to really carry the rest of the film with it.

I also find this film to be rather uneven in all areas, not just in the script and acting.  The set pieces are rather hokey, even if the desert plains of Mars are at times mesmerizing.  The cinematography is a mixed bag, from obvious to breathtaking, and the special effects range from stunning to near wretched.

It's obvious that this was a first time directorial effort from a guy who makes his living shooting commercials.

Some have compared this to `Mission to Mars', DePalma's sci-fi film from the same year.  Personally, neither film is great, but at least DePalma's was entertaining.  It was far less inconsistent than Hoffman's sci-fi mess.  I agree with those who state that this particular film has the better set up and possibly the better premise, but it doesn't do anything noteworthy with it.  `Mission to Mars' may be a little `stupider' (yes, that is a word), but it is far more exciting, engaging and memorable.

(USA/Australia - 2000)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)
Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS

2050: Sent to investigate the failure of a science project on Mars, a group of astronauts become stranded on the 'red planet', at the mercy of a dangerous, malfunctioning robot.

Antony Hoffman's good-looking space opera is a bland but watchable enterprise, toplined by Val Kilmer, Carrie-Anne Moss, Benjamin Bratt and Terence Stamp, in which a group of disparate characters are cast adrift on an alien world and forced to endure a series of life-threatening crises. Hoffman and his scriptwriters (Chuck Pfarrer and Jonathan Lemkin) pull few surprises out of the hat, and some of the computer-generated visual effects are too fake-looking to make much of an impact, though performances and production values are uniformly fine.

I mean we had the Matrix girl and Batman on this mission!

What happened?

The plot was not too bad at the start.  Earth was depleted and an ecological disaster by 2025.  In the 2050s they found that their terraforming of Mars was not working, oxygen levels dropping, so they put together a crew of four guys and a babe (that's Commander babe to you, soldier) and took off to Mars.

The ships and hardware are quite well done.  The talking computer with no emotion is a standard sci-fi standby.  The robot warrior Amee was supposed to be some kind of exploring machine -- this was never made clear in the script.

After getting bombarded by gamma rays and shorting out everything (almost like what happened in Mission to Mars, but I digress) the boys escape in their pod while the Commander (Carrie Ann-Moss, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B00000K19E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>&nbsp;) as Commander Bowman, a clear nod to 2001: A Space Odyssey's Commander Dave Bowman&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2001-A-Space-Odyssey-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000UJ48SG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>), stays behind.

The landing is pretty frightful with big balloon things coming out as they bounce around in the valley.  They also drop off the robot, who gets his computer brains scrambled, goes into Military Mode and starts hunting them down.

The boys are into your standard characters: Coward, Religious, Jock, Security and Pilot.  None of these really played well.  Character development was quite poor in all of them (except Val Kilmer, the only guy with more lines than the other boys).  Their chemistry was just not there.  The pilot is pushed off a cliff.  The coward (who pushed him off the cliff) gets killed by Amee.  The jock (Val Kilmer,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Returns/dp/B000P0J06U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman Returns</a>&nbsp;a.k.a. the janitor) is the sole survivor.  The scientist gets eaten alive by the native bugs.

The fireworks scene where the bugs, like fireflies, burst out of a body with blood and all kinds of stuff.  The fun pretty much stops there, though.

The discovery of the Russian probe that could potentially fire Val back into orbit took some suspension of disbelief.  Even if he was able to get the batteries recharged, it's been lying dormant on the surface for nearly a century.  That its fuel and computer would still work is a bit unreal.  At least it spoke clear Russian.

A valiant attempt at a story, a good try at philosophy but a bit too long for my taste.  The unrequited love angle was poorly done as well.

The bad robot's optic blue squinting like a human to somehow focus in on its prey is not how a machine would act.

I could go on and on with the plotholes.  Somewhat entertaining, on par with Mission to Mars, but as the narration at the end says: ""Nothing when the way it was supposed to""!

Rental.

So, in an effort to save the Earth's population, a major global project has been launched to make the planet Mars a second home for us humans by making it's atmosphere able to support life. But something has gone wrong with the project, and a five man, one woman crew from the U.S. (with the woman as Commander) have been sent to the red planet to investigate, and tagging along with them is a powerful, four-legged, all-terrain robot named AMEE (i.e. ""Amy"") that can swiftly run around like a leopard & use guerrilla tactics to defend itself. On finally reaching Mars, the crew's entry into the planet's orbit goes very awry thanks to a dangerous solar flare. With Commander Bowman forced to remain behind on the crippled ship, the five men crash-land on the Mars surface. With no radio contact available & no immediate way to return to Bowman (who has her own problems to deal with up in the spacecraft), AND with the robot AMEE having been damaged in the Mars landing and is now running amok, the crew must fight for survival, solve the mystery of the Mars project, AND find a way to get back to Bowman and the spacecraft.... 2000's ""Red Planet,"" although not a perfect movie---somebody forgot to tell the FX crew to wipe out those white clouds from the Martian sky---is still a great sci-fi flick, with very good acting & direction, a very good story, great visual effects (apart from the goof with the clouds), and is quite exciting. I really like the cast of this film, too. While it's a bit unrealistic to have a lone woman leading a crew of five men in space (especially one who's a total babe), who better a woman to lead the men then the woman from ""The Matrix""? Carrie-Anne Moss is perfectly cast as Commander Bowman. Yes, she firmly leads the men, but just firmly enough without being militaristic or macho, and without ever losing touch with her gentle, feminine side. You appreciate her very-obvious beauty, but you also appreciate her. Val Kilmer has never been more appealing in a film before. As the kind-hearted flight engineer Gallagher, he's actually a *really nice* guy here, and he plays the role very well, indeed. You like him, and you root for his survival. Rounding out the cast, the always-reliable Tom Sizemore does an excellent job as the cocky scientist, Benjamin Bratt is suitably oily as the hard-ass co-pilot, Simon Baker is good as the immature & ultimately paranoid agriculturalist, and Terence Stamp lends fine support as Dr. Chantillas, the spiritual, eldest astronaut of the crew. And then, there's the out-of-control killer robot, AMEE. She may be a visual effect of the CGI kind (for the most part), but with her four-legged animal design, menacing presence & physical strength, she's still a pretty scary bucket of bolts that poses a definite threat to the crew & their survival. The look of the film, with it's panoramic shots of the Mars surface and it's canyons, the interiors of the crews' spacecraft, as well as it's top-notch visual effects, is terrific. Antony Hoffman does a fine job with the direction, and the story is engaging & enjoyable. And the film's soundtrack is fabulous, too: Graeme Revell supplies an excellent, haunting score, and there are also first-rate contributions from Peter Gabriel, Sting & The Police, and Italian songstress Emma Shapplin. Although a box-office flop back in 2000, ""Red Planet"" definitely deserved a much better reception. Also, this movie is now more relevant than it ever was before. Despite being science-fiction, it addresses the global warming issue, as well as the real possibility of transforming---aka ""terraforming""---Mars into a second planet for us humans to live on, which could very well happen someday. ""Red Planet"" is a solid, intelligent, entertaining sci-fi film that deserves another look.",1192147200,4,3961,4.887072808320951

Not only is there an interesting plot - discovering what has happened to the attempt to terraform Mars - but there is both action and thoroughly plausible scientific speculation.  The story moves quickly, there are plenty of surprises, and the acting is quite good.  There is even a spiritual dimension to it that is subtle rather than in your face.

At the center of the story, which opens as a character study that is disrupted by unforeseen (and potentially deadly) complications, is a scientific mystery.  Thus, there is the unknown, a puzzle that must be solved by some of the best minds from earth as well as the disciplined military.  As details are revealed, there are sudden unexpected developments, revealing more and more about the characters and their mission.

Then there is the vision of the future that is part of all great scifi.  I found all the details believable, from the somewhat clueless interactive computer with voice capabilities and the unpredictable AMEE, the multi-capacity military robot, to the environmental catastrophie on Earth that necessitated the terraforming of Mars, the last chance for human survival.

Together, this makes for a rivetting and believable story that throws some great characters into the mix.  I have watched it several times with complete enjoyment.  Warmly recommended.",1156809600,2,1407,5.100436681222708

Although I have seen way too many movies that try to compensate for poor writing with great special effects (and fail miserably in the attempt), RED PLANET's script isn't that bad and the special effects DO make up for it, especially if you love robotics.  I also love the whole feel of this movie; if you badly want to see humanity go to Mars, this movie will just get you revved up more!

But the most intriguing facet of the story (IMHO) is how the mission commander, so proud of her intellect and capabilities, is tasked with picking her crew for the mission: she naturally chooses other scientists/specialists who are considered tops in their respective fields, and bring their equally swollen egos along for the ride. The only crew member she has less than the highest respect for is the engineering officer, charged with keeping the ship and all things mechanical, operating. He is relegated to the position of Space Janitor by the crew and hence is regarded no higher than a waiter or gofer by the rest. ""Never bet your life on a bunch of batteries"" is the credo his grandfather taught him regarding reliance on technology, and that little aside changed my entire view on society's willingness to prostrate itself before the newest bells and whistles. Of course, the low-tech character saves what's left of the mission. As an overall entertainment vehicle, it doesn't come close to Close Encounters. But as a comment on our society's preoccupation with status and blind acceptance of technology we don't understand, it is very relevant and worth paying attention to.

I think this is a better film than MISSION TO MARS, but that isn't saying much. I think RED PLANET had the greater potential of the two films because it presented an insightful premise about colonizing Mars. It also explained what went wrong or what was perceived as wrong with that scientific premise. It was still good science fiction. However, the premise of RED PLANET is not in the same class as 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY was thought provoking in an almost spiritual sense. RED PLANET unfortunately needed more than its minimalist plot to carry it. Even though RED PLANET obviously contained a genuine supposition on manned exploration of Mars the script could not support the continuum that the plot needed to maintain the viewers' interest. We get bits of story in snippets, which are interesting, but ultimately the film becomes protracted and fails in an abyss of boredom. This is a sad testament to filmmaking.

(Robots sent ahead build Hab-1, a condo for the crew on Mars; they also sprinkle lakes of algae meant to convert Mars's CO2 atmosphere into breathable oxygen). Led by the ultra-competent Commander Bowman (Carrie Moss), and including a philospoher (Terrence Stamp), the hot-shot (Ben Bratt), the existentialist geneticist (Tom Sizemore) and a terra-former named Pettengill (Simon Baker) whose selfishness borders on paranoia, the team nears Mars full of anticipation. The only crewman not quite awed by the prospect if Gallagher (Kilmer) the wisecracking janitor. When a gamma-energy burst cripples the ship before it can make a planned landing, the crew (sans Moss) escape and make landfall (Mars-fall, I guess) before they've had time to scout the planet from orbit. Big mistake - something has wrecked their habitat, stranding the team on Mars. With the mothership barely able to do more than either fall-out of orbit or head for home, Kilmer and crew are forced to rely on each other, with little more to do than watch the oxygen levels of their spacesuits drop. Surprise - they find the Martian atmosphere now loaded with oxygen - condemning them to death by starvation instead of asphyxiation. Also, they must now guard against AMEE, their survey robot run amok. A CGI wonder, AMEE morphs between different predatory poses - human and panther. AMEE was actually designed for the military - and a hard landing on the planet only brings up her darker side. On the team's own side (barely evening out the odds) are a few surprises - mostly involving salvaging barely usable technology from the few probes that mankind successfully landed on Mars.

This is a pretty good film - Val Kilmer plays a surprisingly likeable guy, though the film is largely paint-by numbers. There aren't that many surprises here (like the order in which the team members die off). The film actually does less to surprise than simply suspend your belief (you'd think that with the money they'd spent on the mission and its importance for the survival of humanity, the planners would have screened out nut-jobs like Pettengill; with all their high-tech, none of the team detect oxygen until they crack their visors and find out they can breathe). It would have been cool to expand on the teams use of all that old earth-junk, but the script was obviously hobbled by the fact that so few missions actually made it to Mars (whether you're counting in metric or otherwise, the number is pretty small). Mars itself gets too little exposure in the script - with the planet approximating little more than a big desert with harsh weather - even though the red planet has much to offer. (Oxygen aside, what about the missing ozone layer that's supposed to shield our heroes from deadly UV rays? Even an oxygen-rich atmosphere means little when the atmospheric pressure at sea-level is thinner than what you'd get half a mile over Mt. Everest.) The flick works on its stars, mainly Kilmer, but also Carrie Moss and especially Tom Sizemore playing (again) the tough but tender no. 2 man (seen in ""Private Ryan"".)

Not one performance stands out, and that's a shame with such a great cast, although I've failed to see how Val Kilmer has even sustained a career.  Benjamin Bratt is annoying; Terence Stamp is like Peter Cushing on Valium, and the usually impressive Simon Baker (TV's Guardian) is saddled with a thankless role as a ""traitor"" without any underlying premise.

1.  Armageddon
2.  The Core
3.  Apollo 13
4.  Independence Day
5.  Any ""beat the clock & save the planet/city"" sci-fi flick made since 1990 that I didn't bother watching.
Out of all of these, ""Apollo 13"" is the best, simply because it's a true story that was made with emotional honesty and a compelling narrative.
Here's everything you need to know about ""Red Planet"":
-the best actor (Terrence Stamp) the dies first
-Val Kilmer and Carrie-Ann Moss are in it
-plot of ""Apollo 13"" + wonky environmental pop-science + visuals from ""2001"" + Mars + a funky robot who goes all ""HAL"" = ""Red Planet""
Plot synopsis:  In an attempt to terraform Mars because Earth is so polluted, the ""international community"" has been seeding Mars with large algae mats to make its atmosphere more human-friendly.  Something goes wrong, and a team is dispatched to Mars to investigate.  As they enter Mars' orbit, the ship is exposed to a large solar flare, which fries much of its circuitry.  Most of the crew go to the Mars surface, with the pilot staying on-board to try to save the ship.  The crew jettisons the landing gear and lands, fatally injuring the surgeon/philosopher.  The survivors march to a nearby base previously set up by un-manned missions.  The base is kaput.  One survivor kills another without the others knowing it.  They discover that they can breathe the air.  The pilot tells them that if they can get to an old unmanned rover several hours away, they can make it back to the ship.  Along the way, one survivor goes nuts and is killed by a damaged robot navigator (jettisoned with the landing gear) and some bugs.  The biogeneticist figures out why the air is breathable and kills himself before the bugs can eat him.  Meanwhile, the pilot has repaired the ship.  The lone survivor gets to the rover, fights the robot, steals its battery, and makes it back to the ship.  End of story.
There.  In 15 sentences (including ""end of story""), I have told you THE WHOLE STUPID MOVIE.  That's it.  There's nothing else to know about this movie.
The premise of the conflict is wholly absurd and serves as the engine of a barely-mediocre flick.  In order to make near-future sci-fi compelling. the science must be relatively sound.  So here are the two big science stinkers (leaving aside the whole atmosphere issue) that make this movie wholly implausible:
1.  There are things called circuit breakers and other safety devices to prevent power surges from frying stuff.  All satellites and space equipment using solar panels have these devices and have survived many many solar flares.  Why would they build a ship without these precautions?
2.  None of the Mars survivors consumed water once they reached the surface.  With demanding physical activity and little-to-no atmospheric moisture, they would have died of dehydration sometime during the second march, if not on the first day.
Don't waste your time with this movie.  Rent something good.  Heck, if you just have to see bad sci-fi, watch ""Jason X"" - the visuals are just as good, and you'll be much more entertained.
This movie gets 2 stars for graphical competence and having Terence Stamp utter a few lines.

The science IS bad, and inconsistant, but since this is a movie and not a documentary, so I suppose that's allowable.
I would have loved to see more Terrance Stamp.
The relationships between the crew are not well explained and take unexpected turns here and there.

Set on a partially ""terra-formed"" Mars, so that the stranded team doesn't have to wear EVA helmets for the length of this tedious film, five men - quickly pared down to three, then two, then . . . struggle to survive.  As if the lack of food, water and story line weren't enough, there's a rabid rover that strives to do them in.  In a sense, the rover is the only one with any acting ability.  Its quick-change mode of operation, baleful countenance and dedication to destruction at least provide it focus.  The humans, by contrast, fumble about the landscape, perform feats of derring-do, sink into sloughs of despair and surrender to base instincts.  All the while trying to convince us they are real people.
Is there one heroic figure?  Ah, yes!  Far above struggles [what else] the heroinic commander [i'm not making this up!] of the expedition, Carrie-Anne Moss.  Not reachable by AMMEE the Rampant Robot, C-AM must emulate Sigourney Weaver's role in her efforts to subdue a recalcitrant space ship.  C-AM has the help Sigourney lacked in the voice of the ship's computer.  Sultry, soothing, empowering, this computer voice REALLY communicates.  What its technical abilities are remain a mystery throughout the film.  Perhaps the best dialogue of the film is C-AM and the computer arguing.  Sigourney would be as embarrassed as those NASA astronauts.
There's little chance this review can give away much about the plot.  There's so little of one, and the elements are cadged from a multitude of sources any SF fan will recognise in moments.  To call the performances wooden is to insult whole forests.  Speculative Fiction has enough of a quest achieving mainstream acceptance without disasters like this setting back the genre further.

You know there are tons of movies, some of which aren't as popular as others but are still alright movies. Why watch these movies? Because they are entertaining. This movie is entertaining. I like movies that entertain me and don't try to be the number one flick of the year or all time for that matter.
Val Kilmer is a great actor, I love all his movies, and this movie is no exception. He plays a pretty cool mechanic. I dislike Carrie slightly in this movie because of her stupid journal entry thingies. You know, ""Gallagher was the mechanic, Jimbo was the weapons blah blah blah."" Get on with it. After the beggining, and the stupid journal entry at the end, I like the movie. I saw it in theatres when it came out, and it has a cool atmosphere. I was slightly bored because I had homework to do, but the movie was still enjoyable. The robot is awesome. It flips and ... does stuff with a hover thingy, and even employs some crazy tactics. The bugs are fine, and the plot is great. ""No it isn't. Mdizzio."" Yes it is man, it is great. There is oxygen on a planet, some guys were going down to like check the colonization or something, i forget. But still, they were there for a reason, they found out there was no algae, and soon the plot comes down on you. Killer robot, killer firefly-bees, a spaceship, and a little space-shiperooni. I like the special effects.
If I watched it a third time, I would still be slightly intrested because I wasn't paying too much attention to the movie, but I still like it. In the dark with nothing to do but watching Red Planet would be cool. The atmosphere, combined with great special effects really makes the movie worth-while.

1266833,5,B00003CX44,"I think Red Planet is a true victim of bad marketing. When making up the (very few) trailers and tv spots for this movie, Warner Bros. decided to make it seem like some sort of action packed thrill ride. Even the tagline (something like ""They didn't find life on Mars. It found them."" Oh no! Scary!) suggests a similar movie to Scott's Alien. Since there was very little advertisement for the film (at least where I come from), plus the fact that it had to contend with Charlie's Angels and The Grinch, very few people actually saw the theatrical release, and those who did were going in with the preconceived Alien notion. While there are aliens in the film, they aren't what you'd expect and they only have a minor role. Roger Ebert, however (who gave the film 3 out of 4 stars) said it was one of the most memorable alien encounters he'd seen in years. I think he's right. Yes, there are mistakes in the film, but that's why it's called science-FICTION. The acting is pretty good, Carrie-Anne Moss being the standout, with Tom Sizemore a close second. The movie is funny, has its fair share of action, and is never dull. The cinematography is stunning and the soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in any movie in any genre. No, the movie is not perfect and it could have done a few things better, but it is very, very, VERY far from being a bad film. Instead of expecting an Alien, Starship Troopers, Pitch Black type of movie, people should go in thinking more along the lines of a big-budget cheesy B-movie and just enjoy the ride. Because what a ride it is.
And as a little sidenote, since I've seen this written several times, there's no more nudity in this movie than there is in your typical TV shampoo commercial.",1045699200,2,1727,4.468354430379747

It could also have been a good movie if a little intelligence had been devoted to the script. Instead, the scientific illiteracy of the thing renders it an annoying joke. Take, for example, the ""nematodes"" (which are worms, by the way, not insects). The explanation for the rich Martian atmosphere is that the ""nematodes"" are eating algae and somehow ""making oxygen"". Well, guess what...it's plants and algae that ""make oxygen""...eating it in order to make O2 by some other process is absurd and meaningless. Also, the state of the Martian atmosphere comes as a surprise to the explorers, yet somehow the ships's sensors are able to measure the atmospheric pressure as ""865 millibars""...which is nearly the normal pressure on Earth...which should have been a clue that something odd was going on. Dramatically, the extraneous addition of the killer robot is merely synthetic ""excitement"" added to try to strenghten a lousy script.

1266918,2,B00003CX44,"In 2057, our planet is dying, choking on man made pollution (and you thought recycling your soda cans would help). A misfit ragtag crew is sent to Mars. We have been sending unmanned probes there in the past. These probes have been depositing algae on the planet, which expels oxygen and will allow man to breathe.
The crew consists of five actors and Carrie-Anne Moss. Moss opens the film with some narration introducing the crew and talking of their differences. Except for Terence Stamp, who is old and thereby gets the thankless role of sexless voice of reason, all the other guys are chauvinist jerks. Val Kilmer, Benjamin Bratt, Tom Sizemore, and Simon Baker all have long complicated titles, but really do not do anything in the film to differentiate themselves from each other. They do lust after Moss and can throw out a lame one liner with the best of them.
Things go wrong as soon as their ship gets to the red planet. A space storm renders the ship useless. The guys are sent down to the surface and find no algae. The crew begins to die one by one. Stamp is dispatched before he can convert everyone else's faith from science to something cosmically bigger in the universe. Baker makes an oopsy and pushes Bratt off a cliff. A malfunctioning robot is also along for the ride, deciding to take out the crew for wanting to use it for spare parts. The planet station they were to use when they got down to the surface is destroyed by unseen forces, possibly another life form. Finally, how come everyone can breathe when all the algae is missing?
You might be thinking: cool; a killer robot, a flipped out murdering scientist, alien life forms, and a cosmic being that may or may not be watching over the crew. Throw in Moss back on the ship trying to hold everything together and this is going to be one suspense filled, action packed ride...negative.
As the film progresses, and more of the crew is dispatched, I came to the conclusion that three or four plotlines were fighting for my attention. None were succeeding in holding it. You could make a film that stands alone on any of the robot/psycho/alien villains, yet when thrown together they did not yield exciting chaos but inattention to each individual plot thread.
The cast is very capable, pulling off lots of scientific jargon and rewiring of impossibly damaged equipment without a hitch, but so much more is left up in the air, and some characters acknowledge that! How do the life forms make oxygen? Don't know. How is an indestructible robot so easily dispatched? Don't know. How is Kilmer able to survive huge explosions that seem on the same scale as Nevada desert nuclear plumes of the 1950's? Don't know. Why is Terence Stamp in this picture? Don't know. Stamp's little quiet philosophical conversations amount to absolutely nothing, as God does not swoop in at any point here to save the boys (at least in an obvious way). Throw in the dull romance between Moss and Kilmer, and you have some definite script problems.
While the special effects are lovely and a wonder to look at, they are set to a Graeme Revell musical score that is equally schizophrenic. At some points, I heard the old theme to ""Star Trek,"" at other points, a tabernacle choir takes us through the action. The film makers could not make up their minds, and neither could Revell.
In the end, ""Red Planet,"" like its competitor ""Mission to Mars,"" is pretty to look at and shows technical triumph. The film makers seemed to get the future right, but they forgot to serve the base human emotions of excitement at the proceedings and caring for the characters. I do not recommend this angry ""Red Planet.""

When I say it could have been much more, for instance Val Kilmer and Carrie Anne Moss have great chemistry, but they don't have enough scenes together to really make something out of it. Plus, everyone seems too calm, considering they're being hunted by a badass robot; they seem more concerned about what their next conversation should be. There's too much talking and not enough action.
Still though, it is a lot better than Mission To Mars, which could be pretty painful to sit through at times. Val Kilmer's wit is a lot better than listening to Gary Sinise grieving over his dead wife throughout the whole movie. Plus it doesn't have the corny B-Movie ending that Mission To Mars has either.

  Science-fiction fans will NOT forgive Red Planet's flaws because the movie is not ""reasonably intelligent.""  There are so many painfully glaring errors of science and internal logic that explaining them would almost amount to writing the novelization, but here is a taste:
  The beginning voice-over explains that the terraforming had been proceeding well, then the oxygen levels dropped.  Later it is discovered that oxygen is present in breathable amounts.  Oops.
  In order to be breathable, Mars's atmospheric pressure at ground level would have to become almost one THOUSAND times denser (not common knowledge, I admit, but easily found).  This change would be visible to Earthbound astronomers, but apparently nobody actually looked at the planet.  Oops.

Amee - Cool, loving and frightening dog/robot. She deserves an acadamy award (or a least a golden globe- *grin*)

It was promoted as a SF/Horror flick similar to ALIEN, and it really isn't--it's more like Alfred Hitchcock directing THE RIGHT STUFF.
All the SF movie fans I know tend to like byzantine tales, historic in scope, filled with quirky characters roaming rich new landscapes, so this simple tale of a small group of men trying to escape a desolate red planet within a short span of hours might not be rich enough for them.

1267034,3,B00003CX44,"Red Planet is planet Mars, the one that has so fueled our imaginations over the last century. Was there ever life on it? Did it die out due to climactic changes? If so, could life be reintroduced there? Could we colonize it? Could our ancestors have come from there eons ago? Sci-fi has pondered all of these questions and more, while real science has pondered some of them. As sci-fi, this movie succeeds more often than not. As entertainment, it does not succeed often enough.
The time is fifty years into the future. Mankind has polluted Earth to the point that it will soon become uninhabitable. (Considering the head in the sand approach being taken by our current political leaders, this may not be so far fetched.) Unmanned space craft have been sent to the planet to introduce algae. This has successfully caused the production of oxygen, an absolute necessity if we are to colony Mars, but lately the algae has been inexplicably dying out. A team has been dispatched to find out why.
The movie opens during the ship's six month voyage. Aboard are six scientists and technicians who, for the most part, get along reasonably well. The greatest tension is due to the fact that the commander is a woman. Kate Bowman [Carrie-Ann Moss] is not only competent and intelligent, she is also attractive. I liked the way these men and Katie are portrayed as professional enough to deal with this setup. I also liked the way it gave a bit of edge to the situation. All goes well until, just as they prepare to land on Mars, a solar storm hits and causes some horrific problems with the ship. Bowman must stay behind with the crippled ship while the five men attempt a landing using a small shuttle. They crash land and lose radio contact with the ship. When they reach site of the shelter, which was sent from Earth beforehand, they find it has been destroyed. The oxygen in their suits is limited. They have no food and water and are marooned in a very hostile place. What, if anything, exists on Mars that can save them?
I did admire the way Red Planet tries to be reasonably accurate scientifically. I also admired its serious tone, although that may be part of its undoing. There are times when the crew's situation is so desolate that the movie becomes grim. Grim is never entertaining. I also didn't think the movie's answer as to why the algae disappeared was satisfactory. When this happens, it's like listening to a promising joke only to find the punch line is weak.
The small cast is uniformly good. I especially liked Val Kilmer as Gallagher, a man who has to go all the way to Mars to realize what a wondrous place the universe really is. I also enjoyed his character's relationship with Bowman. As Bowman, Carrie-Ann Moss has the most difficult part because Bowman spends much of the movie alone on the ship. This does not allow Moss to show the acting dazzle she normally does.
As a movie, Red Planet is not in the league of the great sci-fi epics such as 2001: A Space Odyssey or Close Encounters of the Third Kind, though it is certainly better than recent techo-trash entries like Sphere and Starship Troops.",1016236800,,3122,4.6068222621184916
1267035,3,B00003CX44,"Once upon a time, space missions used to be manned with reliable personnel, real professionals who knew the details of their task to the ""t"". But then Arthur Clarke teamed up with Gentry Lee and wrote a sequel to ""Rama"", which showed everyone that it was a lot more fun to populate spaceships with bickering incompetents who had no reason to be up in space in the first place.
Thus, essentially, the early scene where the crew are introduced in terms of their occupations and personality trait (singular - i.e., ""Burchenal - one of the world's greatest bioengineers and his own greatest hero"") is monumentally superfluous. We already know these people. We've read about them, seen them on TV. We know most of them are going to die. They really are that stupid. They raid the chemicals cabinet to make moonshine, prompting the line that will live on in infamy: ""A billion dollars of taxpayer money on this mission and you're using the lab equipment as a still?"" As if we didn't get it, there is a scene of the male crewmembers urinating on Mars (they are amused by the low gravity).
The best aspect of ""Red Planet"" is its surprising tenacity. It faithfully follows in the footsteps of its predecessors, and is almost old-fashioned. For all intents and purposes it is hard science fiction, and does not feel any compunction to resort to either action comedy (""Armageddon"") or over-the-top special effects (""Mission to Mars""), except for a silly, protracted scene of Bowman venting the ship of fire. The premise is not to save stranded comrades or anything that promises any inane action sequences. The mission's sole goal is to find out what happened to the terraforming algae. Moreover, ""Red Planet"" consistently generates momentum and wrings a measure of drama from this sparse and underwhelming plot. There is a touching scene where the crew almost run out of air and sit resignedly waiting to die, and a crash landing sequence that's as much movie as music video. Mars's surface is magnificent in its atmospheric reality, and the spaceship, Mars-1, seems to have come straight out of one of Clarke's novels, right down to Lucille, the computer voice that echoes the crew.
Sadly, while a lot of good can be said about ""Red Planet,"" it is by no means a masterpiece. It fits together so neatly it falls a bit flat. Toward the end the plot wears thin and the underlying cliches begin to show. In hindsight, the discovery that the entire plot depends on the berserk AMEE continually playing a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with the crew is rather disappointing. And while the initial question of ""where have the algal mats gone?"" is answered, the explanation is even more baffling than the question.
In the end, ""Red Planet"" is neither particularly memorable or exciting. Better human dramas and loftier science fiction have been filmed. ""Red Planet"" sets no benchmark, though it's still a solidly entertaining experience.",1013040000,,2918,4.88508064516129

The acting in the movie is excellent.  I do not think the director took advantage of all of the actor's abilities, though.  There is not as much interaction between the characters as I would like, and there is very litle character development.  My biggest complaint in the movie was the robot that the crew took with them on the mission:  AMEE.  I really hated that robot; it always seemed to be in the way, yet it served no real purpose other than provide another problem with the mission.

Now, all of a sudden we're getting Mission To Mars, Ghosts of Mars, and Red Planet.  Why Mars?  Total Recall was an original awesome plotted film about Mars... but now we are drifting away and just counting on the special effects to do the talking.  Why does Hollywood always picks MARS anyway?  Why not Neptune or Saturn?  It would at least be something original...
This film takes to the world in about forty-fifty years in the future.  A shuttle crew stumbles upon the fact that there is algae and oxygen on Mars- or in other words: They can breathe and live in bearable temperatures.  It's because of these bugs- you see.  They can take stuff in and spit out oxygen.
And so on, their robot AMEE goes out of control and starts hunting down the crew, and eventually the crew is being hacked off and VAL KILMER must destroy it, then get back to his spaceship.  TRASH????!!!!!
The effects aren't very realistic anyway!  There isn't anything really cool or fun about the film.  It is the year's competitor for Brain De Palma's MISSION TO MARS- which at least had plot to it.
The performances are acceptable, it is just the way the film moves- it's too strange.  It seems hard to follow- because you simply feel so bored, and when you reach the end you don't even care anymore.  It is very predictible anyway.  Most audiences can easily guess the ending.
Of course, this is Antony Hoffman (the Director)- the debut film that tries to get him some recognizability.  So, as you know, the film isn't to its full potential already.

1267122,1,B00003CX44,"Science so bad, you have to see it to believe it.  Plot holes big enough for Jupiter to fall through.  Concepts more ridiculous than anything Monty Python ever made.  And it's all unintentionally hilarious.

It's 2050, and Earth's biosphere is screwed.  So instead of fixing what's wrong, someone figures it's easier to terraform Mars so we can all move there.  To do so, Earth has been sending algea and lichens to Mars, so they can grow and flourish in the nutrient-void, frozen landscape, and produce enough oxygen for us to breath.  The movie's main point is that Mars just needs oxygen.  There's no mention of the ridiculously freezing temperatures, near-zero atmospheric pressure, decades-long, planet-wide dust storms, or the absolute lack of a biosphere of any type.

So, something is wrong with the miracle algea, and 5 astronauts (all American save on Brit) are dispatched to find out what's wrong.  Mind you, it's a half-year voyage, but the mission psychology planners saw fit to have the crew composed of one gorgeous woman and five men, all of whom live in close quarters.  (...)

Upon arrival at Mars, a solar flare occurs, and it nearly destroys the ship.  Mind you, solar flares happen all the time, and even spacecraft made in the 20th century had their electronics shielded against the accompanying EMP pulse and radiation.  But in the year 2050, no one thought a six-month journey that's key to the future of the human race would encounter a solar flare.  Maybe that's why they filled the circuit breakers with fireworks.  In any case, everyone had to jump ship except the captain, (the woman) who had to stick around and purge the ship's atmosphere to extinguish the fire.  I guess halon system's didn't make it into the 21st century.

Once on the ground, the five men have to make a long hike to their habitat shelter.  The only problem is, one of the crew calmly admits to being incapable of walking due to injuries sustained in their crash landing.  Carrying the injured crew member would slow them down too much to reach habitat, so they leave him to die.

Let's review space math here.  On Mars, you weigh .38 what you did on Earth.  If the injured man weighed 200 pounds, he now weighs 78.  78 pounds between four men is not a lot.  And that's not even counting the fact that those four men have more muscle than is needed to speedily traverse the low-gravity terrain.  But no, they leave him to die slowly and painfully.  OK...  This whole interlude becomes particularly funny when the surviving astronauts realize that they can breath the Martian atmosphere, meaning that they never had to leave their comrade at all.

Anyway, the movie continues on in this fashion.  I haven't even discussed the killer robot that toys with them sadistically, or the evil exploding bugs that eat algea and human flesh with equal zeal.  I can't wait until this movie comes out on Mystery Science Theater 3000.

Just so you can get a gauge of what I like: I switched off Space Cowboys after fifteen minutes because it was junk and looked like it was a 'formula movie', Mission to Mars was equally iffy, but the Red Planet really captured my attention. If was an excellent sci-fi with the right blend of ingredients mixed together in the right order. If you want kick-boxing action from start to finish don't get this, if you want a good blend of action, suspense, impressive and well thought out special effects  and even some philosophy then go for the Red Planet.

There are no official quality reviews about this DVD yet (this website) but I will give the picture a 5.0. Yes, it is an incredible clean and beautiful picture transfer and you don't necessarily have to watch it at night in a completely dark room.  There are some unusual color tones.
The sound has some good moments, but I don't remember anything outstanding about it.
If you like one or all of the following: science fiction, an EXCELLENT picture, watching Carrie-Ann Moss, unusual effects done well, and a few surprises you'll enjoy this movie. You can get it cheap at any Wal-Mart. In fact, I'm anxious to watch it again a mere two days after my first viewing.

Knowing absolutely nothing about the story, I relied on the reputation of three key actors in the film to make my choice; Terence Stamp, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Val Kilmer. There is not much to say about Red Planet except that there are special effects. There is no story. On the journey from Earth to Mars, the conversations among the crew sound like a rehash of the crew dialogue from Aliens, when they have been wakened for their mission and are dining together. (Stamp), Chantilas in the movie, is the only exception and therefore an interesting character; a brilliant scientist on a spiritual quest. He explains to Gallagher (Kilmer), that to him, science could never answer any of the really ""Interesting"" questions in life. By this point I was hoping that this theme might be explored once the crew had landed on Mars, but unfortunately Chantilas is killed off minutes after the landing. The film starts with a voice over dialogue and ends the same way, with absolutely nothing worth watching between.

1267232,3,B00003CX44,"While there were a lot of things that I didn't like about this movie, I enjoyed it much more that I first expected.
Unfortunately, the movies biggest flaw is that the story seemed as if it was written in  two parts by two completely different people working without any collaboration.
Fortunately the weaker part is at the start of the movie. In the first ""pre landing"" section the plot build up was shallow and frankly did nothing for any of the actors - the dialogue was adolescent at best and seemed very gung ho ""20 something"" TV sitcom fare. It also lacked credibility in parts - for example: I seriously doubt that people trained for the first manned mission to Mars would lack of discipline, ( or be given the resources)  to build a moonshine still on the ship and have an all hands party including the captain - come on guys --this belongs on a ""friends"" plot.
However, if you can get through to the second part you will be rewarded. This main section of the movie was much better. The characters actually developed a little and the story, while somewhat predictable, was executed capably by the dwindling cast. They were supported by some great effects that were very subtle ( I loved the foil mapping device). Aimee the ""Feline Terminator"" was also excellently done: I wish we had seen a litle more of her.
So while this is not the best SciFi I've ever seen, I have to say it was worth the price of admission - you just have to stick with it through the first half hour while the script and actors mature. -",996451200,,1517,4.453237410071942

MY REVIEW: ""I don't know about you, but I'm getting tired of 'Mars' movies.  We've got TOTAL RECALL and MISSION TO MARS, and now the most pathetic of them all- RED PLANET.  This film is very dull, and doesn't have much plot.  Moss's performance is the only acceptable one.  It saddens me to see how SIZEMORE's character thourougly through the film, continues to put down Christian religion.  The special effects are nothing like THE MATRIX, and I just couldn't wait till the film was over.  I was being very generous when I gave this movie 2 stars, only for it's somewhat interesting Mars set and Moss's performance.  It is said, ""Red is dead!""  No more Mars movies!  If you wanna see a great Mars film- check out an original: The SCHWARZENEGGER thriller; TOTAL RECALL.  Skip this movie, Definetely!""- MJV & the Movies",992044800,,1431,4.668
1267236,3,B00003CX44,"""Red Planet"" is Easily the Better of the 2 big screen Mars flicks released recently, but it is Still a Sub-Par Sci-fi film. One day someone will make a Mars film that has Great Characters, Good Dialogue, Lots of Action, Suspense and Wonder, Spectacular Effects and, if it's not too much to ask... Some Realistic-Looking Aliens. Wouldn't you think that they would be the first thing on the ""To Do"" list, not in ""Red Planet"". (and Definitely not in ""Mission to Mars"")
The film is a Bare Bones ""Beat the Clock"" story, like ""Pitch Black"" but not as good. Both are Great to Look at (as they were filmed in my native Australia) but ""Pitch Black"" actually had Believable, Likeable and Well-Developed Characters and a little more Substance. ""Red Planet"" has Good Actors, but mostly it wastes them. It seems to be in a Huge rush to Kill everyone off, so why bother Developing them.
Val Kilmer gives a Strangely Likeable performance, a Toned Down version of his ""Island of Dr Moreau"" performance. He saved that film and he saves ""Red Planet"". Carrie Anne Moss and Tom Sizemore lend Good Support to the film, but it's Simon-Baker Denny who gets the all round Best Performance. His facial say a lot about his Character Personality and we Never know weather to Trust him or not, he never sinks into True Blue Goodie or Clichd Bad gut, he cleverly stays in the middle, an Enigma. He makes the film Far more interesting. Terence Stamp's performance looks Superimposed from any one of his other films and Benjamin Bratt is annoying. Both Actors were Unnecessary and only there for their Names and their Paychecks.
Like virtually All of this films target audience, I saw it for it's Special Effects, which looked Great in the Theatrical Trailer. In the Film, they range from State-of-the-Art (the AMEE Robot) to Sad State of Affairs-Effects (the Zero-Gravity Fire, which was done Way better in ""Event Horizon""). As for Alien Life on Mars, I don't want to give away too much but for Me the result was Quite a Let down. ""Too Little Too Late"" sums it up fairly well.
The film does have Quite a Few things that make it Well worth a look. AMEE the Robot was the Real Star of the film; she should get her Own film, which I'd like to see. A Military creation with the Looks of a Cheetah's Skeleton, the Mind of a Green Beret, the fists of Bruce Lee and the Mentality of the Blair Witch (they both love to Toy with their Victims). The way the boys Land on Mars is also a Highlight. NASA's Equipment gets Quite a lot Better in 50 some odd years. We Finally have Space suits that are Mobile and Strong, and Ships that take 6 months to get to Mars, but Prey that a Solar Flare does hit the ship or it Falls apart like a Go Cart under a Semi.
Sure some of it is Nonsensical, but lots of it Works. ""Red Planet"" is Ultimately a Good Way to pass an Hour and Forty minutes. Once you get over the fact that Hollywood has Yet to make the Definitive Mars Flick (Tim Burtons ""Mars Attacks"" is the best so far, and that is a Worrying Thing) you can sit back and Enjoy what they Have made, a Fun, Old Fashioned ""Beat-the-Clock"" Sci-fi Flick.",991872000,,3102,4.443859649122807

The film drags and desperatly searches for ideas to keep us interested. It doens't know who the bad guy is or what's going on half the time.

Even Patrick Swayze or Billy Campbell would have been better choices. Including George Clooney. Nevertheless, despite borrowing a subplot from Saturn 3, the film has some very interesting moments. The special effects were superb, the acting good, the special effects explosive, and the plot a very solid one. Even Carrie Anne Moss shines as the mission commander, without playing the role like a Ripley-clone or a throwback to her role in The Matrix. Overall, it's not a bad film. It could have been better.

1267344,3,B00003CX44,"In 2000 there were two movie released dealing with Earth's first human landing on Mars. The first one out of the starting gates was MISSION TO MARS. That movie was full of pretty pictures, but lacked any substance; contained an all-star cast, but no talent was displayed; and gave tribute to a classic film by one great director (Kubrick's 2001), but failed to display the talent of it's own director (DePalma). The other Mars movie of 2000 is RED PLANET. It is a much better film than MISSION TO MARS.
The movie takes place in the not too distant future of mid-century 2000. The Earth is polluted and overpopulated and not only are fossil fuels running out, but so is oxygen. Algae has been deposited and growing on Mars so that if all else fails, life on Earth can be transported to the Red Planet. However, after years of depositing and growing the plants, oxygen levels on Mars drop off significantly and all traces of plant growth disappear. A team is assembled to travel to Mars to discover what has happened and bring back answers (and perhaps some hope) to Earth.
Unlike MISSION TO MARS, RED PLANET doesn't take itself too seriously. It's a by-the-book Hollywood formula movie. The movie boasts a talented cast of supporting actors who must have enjoyed themselves while making the picture because their characters are believable (unlike those in MISSION). Also, the effects and scenery are just as beautiful as in MISSION (well the ship here isn't as detailed as in that movie, but that's a minor point).
The only major flaw of the picture is that it fails to really engage the audience. Since this is a formula film and it takes place on Mars there isn't nothing new to see (well AMEE is pretty cool, but killer robot dogs aren't new either). The film has more substance than MISSION TO MARS, but it lacks the excitement of another 2000 space film, PITCH BLACK. Of course, that film contained some blood and guts, but it was much more exciting. RED PLANET doesn't have the rush of PITCH BLACK, but nevertheless is a nice piece of mind-candy movie to keep your mouth wet.",989884800,,2080,4.654891304347826
1267345,1,B00003CX44,"After having to endure one hundred and seven minutes of terrible acting, horrendous dialogue and a story so flat it'd make the Great Plains look rocky I can only hold my head in shame as I admit that I purchased this DVD without previewing it first.  My faith in Val Kilmer, which he's established with dramatic turns in Thunderheart and Heat, led me to believe that this Mars movie would be better than it's predecessor - Mission to Mars.  It's not; in fact it's far worse.  Whereas Mission had some intriguing characters, actors who actually took the material seriously and a plot, this outing can boast none of the above.
Carrie-Anne Moss of The Matrix (another movie I throroughly disliked) stars as the captain of the first flight to the mysterious Red Planet.  She's leading a group of ragtag elitists whose mission is to begin colonizing the planet for an expected move from Earth.  You see, in the future we've depleted our resources to dangerously low levels (the only element of the film that rings true) so we're forced into undertaking the task of taraforming Mars, thus making it inhabitable for human life.  I'm sure that I'm in the minority here but I don't exactly understand how the writing team of Chuck Pfarrer and Jonathan Lemkin expects us to be rooting for mankind when we've already stripmined one planet and are only bound to do it again.
And Kilmer plays, get this, the janitor.  He and the others fall to Mars in what amounts to the only halfway interesting scene in the entire film while Moss stays behind to reboot the ship, fighting a wildfire at zero gravity in the process.  If you think that sounds interesting it is, but I suggest you skip ahead a few chapters to get there because everything the preceeds it is snore-worthy and what follows is so laughable you won't even be allowed the previlage of catching some Z's while it's still on.  That's what makes this film so intolerable, not only is it mindless (trying telling that to the filmmakers who actually think they have something to say here) but it's ridiculously slow moving.  I can't imagine this picture engaging anyone on any level.  I wouldn't recommend it to people in search of a dumb fun summer popcorn flick, and I certainly would advise arthouse crowds to stay as far away as they possibly can.
It's hard to figure how so many fine actors could be attracted to a script this awful.  Maybe it was that whole unerlying, ""god theme,"" which since I'm an atheist I must admit I have a bit of a prejudice towards.  But having said that, I'm not entirely close-minded to the idea of a ""higher power;"" at least not in films.  I actually quite enjoyed Steve Martin's Leap of Faith and thought very highly of last year's box office smash Cast Away.  But this movies seems more intent on patronizing religion (unintentionally, of course) mostly due to the fact that the material is handled so poorly.
Usually about this time in one of my reviews I like to point out a few redeeming characteristics in the film but aside from the two before mentioned scenes there aren't any.  The characters, the acting, the writing, the directing; they're all shallow.  I suppose, and I'm really reaching here, I could point out the fact that Carrie-Anne Moss did go on to follow this up with a role in Memento, which is far and away my favorite film of this year so far, and in which she gives a very solid performance.
Now since this is the first single star review I've written I should probably point out the criteria for earning such jeers.  First thing is that I have to never, and I mean never, want to see the movie in question again.  Second, it's usually a sign that the picture is really bad when I catch myself checking my watch and not even a minute has passed since I'd last checked it.  Thirdly, if I have the urge to get up and leave the theatre or stop the disc before the film is even over, then I know it must be pretty uninvolving for me to feel that way.  Red Planet meets all three and it isn't even a first for it's two leads, Val (Batman Forever) or Carrie-Anne (The Matrix).  So if your still asking, yes it's that bad.",989539200,,4118,4.529014844804318
1267346,3,B00003CX44,"I really wish Hollywood would have the rocks to provide us with a science fiction movie that didn't end up being 'Die Hard in Space'. Brian DePalma's 'Mission to Mars' had all the verve of a Pinter play and characters modeled after William Hurt's style of woodeness. 'Red Planet' on the other hand provides a slightly less serious film about a much more interesting prospect than simply going to Mars. The year is 2057 and mankind has once again despoiled Mother Earth and must find a new place to despoil, so they select Mars. Then after nuking the polar ice caps to release CO2 which causes a greenhouse effect and thereby raising the temperature of the planet, they then launch probes containing algae to the surface. The algae live off of CO2 and release oxygen as a by-product. Not a bad idea and scientists have believed this would be a good way to actually do it. Forgetting of course that Mars' gravitation is much too low to sustain a viable atmosphere.
When oxygen levels suddenly stop rising and begin to decrease, it's decided that they must send a ship out to investigate, enter the intrepid crew. Carrie-Anne Moss plays Captain Kate Bowman, no doubt in homage to 2001, and for some reason people still find her interesting. Val Kilmer plays the sensitive engineer Gallagher, Benjamin Bratt (Law & Order), appears as the arrogant and self-aggrandizing co-pilot, Ted Santen. Tom Sizemore (Saving Private Ryan) is the biologist, Dr. Quinn Burchenal, and Terrance Stamp as the philosophical, God-searching Dr. Bud Chantillas, who of course is doomed to die. The last member of this so-called crew is AMEE, a robot hunter-killer that resembles a cheetah on lone from the Marines as a ground navigator. This movie offers up more cliches than a Glenn A. Larson episode of Battlestar Galactica. Cliches aside, the crew was at least more likeable than the characters in Mission to Mars.
The Mars-1 spacecraft looks as though it were designed by committee who didn't talk to each other. The final result being a long shaft with counter-rotating rings near each end with what look like cargo containers strung between them. Why these rotating sections are there are anyone's guess, because none of the sets seems to have curved floors or walls. However, the ship has 'artificial gravity' which is either provided by the rotating rings or gravity generators built into the decking - whatever it is they never say. The interior sets are spacious to say the least, Nasa should be lucky to have so much unused space. Duty stations and consoles look like afterthoughts. The crew of six spends the next six months en route to mars, awake and interacting with each other. I don't know about you, but if I was stuck in a confined space with only six people, there would only be one person at the end when we got to Mars.
Things go bad for the ship when it gets whacked by a gamma ray burst from the Sun and shorts out everything but the AI computer, Lucile. While Bowmen spends the rest of the movie being told what to do by the computer, the boys launch down to the planet's surface and promptly crash in one of the funniest unintentional moments in the film. The little landing craft bounces down cliff side after cliff side only to come to rest at the bottom of a canyon. AMEE, who was in the landing craft is lost after the thruster array is jettisoned, is of course damaged and doomed to go on a killing rampage after the survivor. Meanwhile, Chantillas dies from injuries sustained in the crash, the rest are left to walk the several kilometers distance to the habitat module that was set up automatically months before their arrival. Somehow these spacesuits that do not have back packs of any sort have 7 hours of oxygen in them - just enough time to make it to the habitat site to find out that it has been trashed. Defeated and forlorn, the men decide to sit down and die of asphyxiation when one of them gets the bright idea to take off his helmet, whereupon they learn that there is a breathable atmosphere on Mars.
The more I think about this film the more I realize that both it and Mission to Mars weren't that good. Both had their moments, but could have benefited from another script treatment. That and perhaps letting other directors actually make the film. Red Planet's special effects are really quite good, especially the liquid fire and lander crash sequences. Overall, however the end result is a mediocre attempt to do a Mars movie. It's cliche and largely unoriginal, but still delivers some really nice bits. Val Kilmer is wasted and has been in every movie since Tombstone and his brilliant performance as Doc Holiday. I have a genetic dislike for Carrie-Anne Moss and have since the Matrix (perhaps the worst film of 1999). Red Planet delivers a slight twist on the 'life on Mars' bit, but that really isn't enough to make this a memorable film.",989193600,4,4869,4.6892523364485985

Kilmer does a great job with what seems to have been a shallow character at inception and Moss plays a hard-core commander pretty convincingly. There's a lot of action once you get past the beginning, and the prop and technology concept designers really went all-out with some creative futuristic stuff. The narration at the beginning and end, I'll agree, is kind of annoying; they probably should have used textural intro screens to provide the background.

It's the middle of the 21st century and a dying earth reaches out to colonize Mars as a last hope.  Val Kilmer, Carrie-Anne Moss (The Matrix), Benjamin Bratt, Tom Sizemore and Terrence Stamp represent all humankind in the first landing on the mysterious red planet.  Also on board is the extraordinary, multifunctional robo-assistant AMEE.
But, wouldn't you know it, a malfunction has forced her into a relentless killing-machine mode hell-bent on destroying the crew.  And that's not all the crew must deal with; barren Mars has breathable oxygen and -- other inhabitants.  Like the poster says: ""They didn't find life on mars.  It found them.""
This somewhat by-the-numbers adventure is saved because it's looks great (the sets, locations and props are always credible) and the action never lets up.

Anyway, Carrie-Anne Moss did one of her pbest performances since The Matrix.  The supporting characters also added a bit more flavor to the scenes.

1267430,4,B00003CX44,"Out of the three space-related films of the year 2000, ""Red Planet"" is definitely the best. The movie towers over the slow-moving ""Mission to Mars"" with a nicely-paced sequence of events, and takes a front seat to ""Pitch Black"" by not going too much into violence and gore. The characters are intelligent and likeable, and the plot develops itself to cover all of its bases once the final moments settle in. I had to remain skeptical in watching this, due to the flack it received from numerous other critics, yet I found myself enjoying the movie immensely.
The movie begins with the narration of Commander Kate Bowman, as she describes how, after fifty years, the earth is running out of resources, and becoming increasingly uninhabitable. This is the reason for their mission: the first manned space mission to Mars in order to determine whether or not human life could exist on such a planet. This is a nice setup, far more intellectual and interesting that the setup for ""Mission to Mars."" Unlike that film, there is an actual stated reason for this mission, and the astronauts actually have a purpose in going instead of just going there to observe.
The characters are introduced to us at this time, giving us a chance to warm up to them before throwing them into the expected mayhem to come. Commander Bowman is highly intellectual and fervent in giving orders, and expects nothing but the best from her ship and her crew. The crew consists of Robby Gallagher, a maintenance operator, Dr. Quinn Berchenal, Ted Santen, Chip Pettengill, and Dr. Bud Chantilles. The crew and commander get along well for the most part, with some minor tension between certain characters as well as developing love interests among Gallagher and Bowman.
In the first attempt to attain an orbit around the planet, a solar flare disables the spacecraft, and everyone is able to land on the Red Planet but Bowman, who must stay behind and revive the spacecraft. Their landing on Mars proves to be quite eventful, and as the group begins to make their way across the landscape, they make some interesting discoveries: there is oxygen within the atmosphere, which allows them to breathe without their helmets. A machine which was designed to move about in places they cannot goes berserk, threatening their lives. And there is the constant feeling that they are not alone on the planet, that something else is inhabiting the very terrains they are searching.
The only real reason that this material works is that there is an explanation for each and every one of the above-mentioned events that never gets too out-of-hand or confusing. The available oxygen is there because of algae-carrying pods sent to the planet many years ago from Earth in order to create life-giving plants and organisms, which would also provide an explanation for the presence of life forms on the planet as well. There is an actual reason for their mission, as stated above. The malfunctions of the spacecraft that are caused by the solar flare also have a purpose in the film, and are explained by the conversations between Bowman and her computer, which seems to have a mind of its own.
The movie is a techie's paradise: all sorts of little gadgets and machines bring a futuristic sense to the story. The robot Amee is one such example: it can be controlled by humans, but once it develops a mind of its own, it is virtually unstoppable. This is a nice testament to machine-building getting out of hand, as we are creating machines smarter than the human race everyday. I especially liked the tie-back to our present day with the modem/radio that is used to establish contact between the Mars survivors and the spacecraft, providing me with a hearty chuckle while keeping the story moving.
Story movement goes at a steady pace, never getting too slow and agonizing or too fast and incomprehendable. The story may be viewed as simplistic by some, but it ccertainly never reaches the juvenile likings of ""Mission to Mars."" This story is much more intelligent, and through its dialogue and plot execution, it shows us that it's aware of this factor. It never dives into too much violence or gore, either. The life forms that inhabit Mars are dangerous, but it never gets to the point where we must turn away. The special effects are spectacular, vividly creating an almost dream-like place where fantasy and reality are undiscernable. Mars, yes, is a red planet, but it is during the night that this planet reveals its breathtaking vistas and algae-covered landscapes. Scenes in space are convincing and well rendered. Sound design is extremely bass-heavy, adding to the presence of the spacecraft while also creating a sense of unease with its chords of music.
Casting is uniquely done as well, with a group of actors that seem out of place with one another. Carrie-Anne Moss is Commander Bowman, with Val Kilmer as Robby Gallagher. Their chemistry never really has a chance to get off the ground, but while it's in take-off stage, it's believable and well-acted. Moss is especially convincing in seriousness as a captain of a ship. Benjamin Bratt, playing Ted Santen, is arrogant and forceful, while Simon Baker as Chip Pettengill, and Terence Stamp as Dr. Bud Chantilles are humorous and mysterious. Tom Sizemore does not attain enough screen time for us to get a feel for his character, who indulges in philosophy, but his early death keeps us from needing to know any more than that about him.
""Red Planet"" may seem like another addition to the failing sci-fi genre, but it's not without its good points. It has a nicely crafted story that is told lucidly and effectively, with moments of intensity and suspense that fit into the plot. The performances are convincing and well-acted, while the special effects are dazzling and meticulous. I didn't expect much out of this movie, and I guess that helped me to like it as much as I did.",987552000,43,5894,4.842418235877106
1267431,1,B00003CX44,"As a fan of great science fiction (come on, who isn't), I feel it is my duty to notify the public of this terrible... of everything science fiction is meant to be, both from a story and character point of view.  First, the story of Red Planet.  I only watched the movie once (so maybe I'm not exactly the expert here), but from what I could tell, the mission that the characters were involved in was neither terribly important, nor worth the cost of human life.  Yet, as the Hollywood tradition says, one must spend much and make with the death in order to succeed.  For Val Kilmer movies, the formula seems to work.  Now for the characters.  I do have one question, why in the world would you pay for Terrence Stamp simply to sell him off like he was a used car.  Here's an idea, don't allow us to sympathize with anyone who will only been in the movie for 15 minutes.  Tom Sizemore has also seen better days...roles...directors...movies.  When you look at his past career (I know not everyone liked The Relic the same way I did), he could have had a much more likable part.  Val Kilmer plays a half-wit in a half-wit movie, so I won't torture him.  As for Carie Ann-Moss (of the triple name armada), she could be more monotonous, but only if this movie had a higher budget.  AMEE is a HAL-9000 type, so at least she has more character than everyone else in the film.
Aside from the acting, the special effects were atrocious.  Am I the only one that thought the effects were terrible?  That matting on all the dark sky scenes is horrible.  It's like they gave a three year old the scissors and said ""cut away.""  I hope that Warner Bros. can recover from this gigantic flop of a movie.

It stars Val Kilmer, Carrie Anne-Moss, Tom Sizemore, and Terrance Stamp.  It follows a somewhat over-used story about how Earth is about to die and we are searching for a new home.  We choose Mars, which wouldn't be my first choice.  A small team gets there, a robot goes a little nuts, and we find out that we are not alone.  The effects are good and catch your eye.

1267524,3,B00003CX44,"I recently rented this DVD to wile away a stormy Saturday night, and was pleasantly surprised to find what I had anticipated to be just another pot-boiler to be a moderately intelligent (ins't it interesting that one now grabs at any signs of intellect or mentioning of issues as surprising) treatment of a depressingly possible set of future circumstances; having so polluted the Earth's environment, mankind sets about the task of finding virgin territory to infect with the virulent and dangerously corruptive habits of man; Mars. Ah, the reality of the situation makes what would otherwise be a silly premise into a much more releveant and interesting exercise in what is likely an unintended social commentary on man's nature.
The visual effects are stunning, as are some of the action sequences. And while I was not surprised at most of the plot turns, I did find the script to be moderately intelligent, the actors more than merely competent, with Val Kilmer, Benjamin Bratt (lately of ""Law and Order"" fame), Tom Sizemore, and Terrance Stamp all adding star power and credibility to the action. And who can deny the comely charms and sex appeal of Carrie Anne Moss, whose nipple-evident tee-shirt presence certainly quickened my interest in her scenes. She also adds to the credibility of what is obviously a doomed enterprise, the fledgling human habitation of the red planet. When the smoke clears and the survivors limp away from the hostile reception they receive, one finds a bit of a moral to all this; better to fix Earth than to try to escape the consequences of what man has wreaked on the planet. Maybe the Martians are superior beings after all! Enjoy!",986688000,22,1670,4.925531914893617

1267527,3,B00003CX44,"""Red Planet"" is a sci-fi movie that meanders about in search of an identity.  Is it an action flick, a monster movie, a suspense thriller, a love story or a philosophical treatise on the meaning of life?  It tries to be all of these at one point or another and doesn't do any of them exceptionally well.  There is plenty of meat for the hard-core sci-fi lover.  The premise is intriguing.  A desperate human race that has ruined its own environment tries to seed the surface of Mars with algae to create an oxygen atmosphere.  Our heroes travel to Mars to see how the experiment is working and of course, they get hit with every calamity possible once they arrive.  The experiment succeeded but spawned unanticipated consequences and naturally, on top of all their other troubles, the robot guardian designed to protect the crew decides it would be more fun to hunt them down and kill them.
The problem with the film is the presentation.  First time feature director Antony Hoffman's pacing is ponderous, making the film seem much longer than it is.  I was surprised to see that it only ran an hour and 46 minutes.  I was sure it was over two hours.  The philosophical angle is superfluous as is the rivalry between some of the crewmembers.  The visual effects are good, but not up to the standard set by ""Mission to Mars"", though the story here is better and more believable than M2M.
The acting is good, particularly Carrie-Anne Moss.  Moss gives her character resourcefulness and toughness without losing the vulnerable side.  Val Kilmer seems unsure how to play his character.  He alternates between bold action hero, and philosophical weenie.  His performance is decent, but I have seen him much better (""Ghost and the Darkness"", ""The Doors"").  I put much of the responsibility for this on the director, since Kilmer has proven he has the talent to handle a strong dramatic lead.  Tom Sizemore is excellent as the geneticist who is desperately trying to figure out the mechanism for what is happening on Mars before their time runs out.
I enjoyed this film in parts and yawned through others.  I rated it a 6/10.  In the hands of a stronger director, it could have been a powerful film.",986256000,,2191,4.700787401574803

chasing the weak and lame crew for some time, then disappears to
reappear in the end of the movie? It could have chopped their heads
off in the very beginning. Hm, something else to entertain the
audience: the flesh-eating bugs appear and mistake one of the
astronauts for algae, apparently. Plus lame dialogue, plus the picture
of the crew pissing with audible pleasure (what was it for? To show
how they enjoy life on Mars?), plus wooden and always blue-faced C-A
Moss hanging around the ship and square-jawed emotionless V
Kilmer. Yes, the music was good, and some visuals as well, but aren't
we used to them?
And hey, have some respect: will finally somebody
out there in Holywood find a Russian who can teach you to write
""entry"" and ""alarm"" correctly, not that ridiculous
abracadabra you're substituting for the Russian language. Don't forget
it's not the first movie Russians are saving Americans in!
In the
end of the movie V Kilmer says ""To hell with Mars""(well, he
used a different word, but if I reproduce it here, Amazon won't
publish this review). I'd say ""To hell with this parody!"".",982022400,5,1573,4.761904761904762
1267794,5,B00003CX44,"I would just like to point out that Red Planet is a better film than say- Mission to Mars, for a number of reasons. The main criteria in evaluating a film and if it stands the test of time is---is it believable? Frankly I found Mission to Mars a really enjoyable movie right up until the end... then it became unbelievable and the end did not match the rest of the movie. It was an almost jolting experience which then broke the spell that the movie was casting. This was a disappointment.  Red planet however is more realistic, anyone who follows the space program knows that. I would also like to point out that I am a fan of Sci-fi- Star Trek, Star wars, Space 1999 and on and on. Each of these series had its spectacular but it was always grounded in reality. I do not mean to say that Red Planet is a perfect film, because that is always open to debate, but on a whole it was a great film. Sure Mission had elements of the spectacular, but they have to be grounded in fact or the movie does not come off. Red Planet is this and more and I found that the actors did a great job.  You don't have to agree with me, but please don't condem the film just because It didn't have weird space aliens running around killing everyone.",981590400,,1229,4.203389830508475
1267795,5,B00003CX44,"As I read the other viewers reviews of this film, one word keeps popping up.  Cliches.  I'm afraid I have to disagree.  Considering the number of Mars films out there, it would be hard to do a thing without someone being able to link it to another film.  I suppose some would accuse them of copying other plots by having a human being walk on the surface.  Well, so be it.
I see things differently.  I'm not after calculus.  For me, it's about entertainment.  Not mindless entertainment, to be sure, but I certainly follow the ""suspend your disbelief for a few hours"" school of thought.
I thought this was a blast.  Carrie Anne Moss, who, although cool in the Matrix, didn't do anything for me physically, I find absolutely gorgeous in this.  Val Kilmer did a great job as well. AMEE was a very novel addition as well.  All in all, an excellent space romp.",980899200,6,856,4.458064516129032
1267915,4,B00003CX44,"I am amazed at these reviews written here.  People compare this movie way too much.  Yes, Mission to Mars may have been a ""smarter"" film directed by an experienced well established director.  But let's face it, with the exception of some great commercials, Red Planet is a first movie for this new director and quite frankly-it really isn't half bad.  If I have to compare, I would say this movie has comparable quality to any major sci-fi movie out there.  It definately surpasses any made-for-tv movie and it has a believable story and a believable ending (two points seriously lacking in Mission to Mars).  Don't get me wrong, this movie has some serious script problems but this movie has a strong cast that delivers their characters without a hitch.  I am a huge fan of Terence Stamp and Val Kilmer and quite frankly Carrie Anne Moss is the one of the hottest actresses to come along since Sandra Bullock and Natasha Henstridge.  I do have to agree with a comment made by an earlier reviewer, I was glad they kill off Benjamin Bratt early in the film because he was just plain annoying in this movie.  Tom Sizemore is way cool though and has a good strong character in this film.  Don't listen to the useless reviews placed here, this movie is total eye candy and will make a great addition to any sci-fi collection.",980294400,21,1321,4.582978723404255

1267918,2,B00003CX44,"Carrie-Ann Moss almost carries this one off alone. With more than one reference to other (and better) sci-fi flicks, Red Planet beats Mission to Mars but doesn't have the plot in the right place or at the right time. Far too much exposition takes the place of character development, the thrills are contrived and hardly present at all and the plot is shot through with holes. Moss manages to stay above it and that, combined with some good science and decent photography make for a watchable 'coulda been.'",976492800,,506,4.761363636363637
1267919,3,B00003CX44,"Even though this movie doesn't break any new ground, it still is an entertaining sci-fi movie. Special effects are excellent, solid casts, & execution of the plots isn't as clumsy as M2M.  The storyline is simple enough, just like any other sci-fi movies: a team of intelligent people are sent somewhere to investigate something, but halfway thru, something goes awfully wrong.  Some people got killed along the way, some emerge as hero(es) &/or getting their girls along the way, new discovery , best of friends become the worst of foes, mission accomplished & everybody live happily ever after.

1267921,2,B00003CX44,"The second of the 'Mars' movies of 2000 (preceded by 'Mission to Mars', and to be followed by 'Ghosts of Mars'), 'Red Planet' has a top-notch cast in a cliched rehash of elements better utilized in other films. This is a shame, as SF literature about Mars is so rich and varied, you wish someone would adapt a classic novel, instead of 'creating' such derivative nonsense!
Earth of 2025 is on the brink of ecological suicide; in an effort to provide a new home for humans, unmanned spaceships have begun terraforming Mars, sending oxygen-producing algae, as well as creating a habitat for a manned mission. Finally, a massive space-constructed craft is dispatched to complete the work. The crew consists of efficient and beautiful commander Carrie-Anne Moss; hunky but arrogant pilot Benjamin Bratt; sensitive, philosophizing doctor Terence Stamp; opportunistic, wise-cracking bio-engineer Tom Sizemore; over-sensitive dweeb technician Simon Baker, and sweet nonconformist 'mechanic' Val Kilmer. Rounding out the crew is a robot loaned by the Marines, nicknamed AMEE, which looks like a rejected 'attack-bot' design from 'Robocop', to perform surface experiments. If these characters all sound like stereotypes...they are!
When a solar flare seriously damages the spacecraft, in low-Mars orbit, Moss is forced to send the crew down to the surface, while she attempts to save the mothership. Then the problems REALLY begin!
Without giving away any of the spoilers, let me just say that you'll see plot elements lifted from 'Event Horizon', '2001', 'Outland', 'Terminator', 'Pitch Black', and many other SF films. The sad thing is, 'Red Planet' doesn't improve on these elements, it simply rehashs them! Even the planet's surface recreates the 'Death Valley with a red filter' look of 'Robinson Crusoe on Mars', (it was the one element in 'Mission to Mars' that impressed me; Mars LOOKED unearthly!).
I hate knocking this film; I'm a big Val Kilmer fan, and really had high hopes that this would be a big hit for him. But I have to be honest; 'Red Planet' should have been much better! Sorry, Val!",974592000,,2095,5.182890855457227
1267922,5,B00003CX44,"Red Planet is a movie that is not just mindless nothing.  It is a smart, stylish, and well made movie. it dragged a little and needed a little more character development but no movie is perfect. it was better that Mission to Mars(which i thought was good).  it had more suspense and action.  the acting was very good. Val Kilmer and Carrie Ann Moss were especially great and they had chemistry.  Tom Sizmore(saving private ryan) also catches your attention.  one of the best acpects of the film was how they showed the connection between Kilmer's and Moss's characters.  it had a very interesting storyline Why can they breath on Mars?  it had a great suplot with AMEE a robot turned against them-who is trying to kill them.  overall red planet was very entertaining. I think it is one of the better sci-fi movies to come around in resent years.  because it didn't try to be all action adn no plot. it wanted to make you think as well as entertain you.  Any sci-fi fan will appreciate this and want to see the movie again because of it. i recommend this movie to anyone who loves sci-fi and anyone who wants to see a good movie.  Red Planet is a rare treat and should not be missed.",974505600,15,1182,4.425925925925926

One inparticular is when the ships crew tries to land on Mars. This part of the movie was great. Amazing special effects throughout this movie, especially of the robot AMEE. The movie started off slow, and I was a little worried that it would turn out to be much worse that its earlier mars conterpart, Mission to Mars, which I really didn't think was all that bad. This movie is quite a bit better than M2M. It has more action, suspense and a better story. Red Planet could of used some character building scenes earlier in the movie, rather than a commentary by one of the actors, but it turned out to be not that bad. The ending could of used some work as well. I would recommend anyone to check this out. Its a fun ride.",973900800,13,879,4.333333333333333

The film would've had a bit more impact if it had explored certain plotlines more fully.  Bizarrely, tantalizing subplots are introduced briefly only to die with the character with whom they're associated.  The movie could've been a three hour epic, easily.
