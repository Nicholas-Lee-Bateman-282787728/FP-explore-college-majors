We have  a boom and bust economy, where the super rich keep consolidating money and power (FED lowers interest rates, People move from the bank to socks; the stock market crashes; people sell low and the super rich buy up all the stock-Do you Notice the tarp money is not going to buy the bad debt but to help big banks buy up small ones?). So I agree with Jones about the FED, and I keep an open mind to the rest of the theory's. I thought the part at the Buildenburger's hotel was kind of a waste, but otherwise I think the participates in the documentary make a strong argument for there beliefs. I think every American should see this DVD, and make up there own mind!",1240531200,65,835,4.318471337579618

172063,1,093085280X,"There is no dispute that this country has experienced more discord under this current administration with class wars and race baiting.  However, to blame this president (of whom I have no love for) for all of this drama is like blaming the great Chicago fire on Mrs. O'Leary's cow.  The mentality of today is different from that of our forefathers.  We no longer embrace the work ethic that made us a great nation, but embrace a ""what can the government do for me and give me that I don't have to work for"" mentality.  We have become slaves to the government in the fact that we have now sold our souls to those who provide for us.

There are some good aspects of this ""documentary"", but I can only hope that people will do their research on the maker of this film.  Yes, there are ""other powers"" that want to take over, and those powers play on our greed as a people.  It's never enough to have just enough!  If one reads thru the Bible, they will see that these powers have been around since the beginning of time.

Mr. Jones wants us to believe that this is a conspiracy, and in fact it is, but not of man's making, if you get my drift.  This film bashes both the Democratic and Republican efforts....of course, because he is a Libertarian.  Less government is a good goal, but a better goal is to have a God fearing government like the original founding fathers.  There has to be laws put in place to avoid chaos.  There has always been laws in every government setting.  Having no government involvement in personal life may render more chaos than can be imagined.  It leaves each person to their own interpretation of what they feel is the right thing to do.  One may feel that retribution rather than going thru the court system is the best way to go about living.

Again, this film has some interesting and valid arguments that should have us questioning a lot of things that are happening around us.  But when I hear from this film maker, that 9-11 was an ""inside job"" and that the moon landing was faked......the credibility flies right out the window.

Do your own research, listen, keep your eyes open and exercise your privilege to vote your choice.  Take this conspiracy theory film with a grain of salt, and do not believe everything you see or hear.....on anything!!!",1432339200,24,2283,4.495145631067961

It starts by saying that the producers of this video also bashed President Bush.  I personally can't think of anything good to say about President Bush so really I don't think stating that is really of any significance.  It goes on to say that some of Obama's promises happened later than he thought they would, he has some rich friends and that he is charming.  This is silly because most presidents are charming and have rich friends.  Some presidents never do what they say they will.  Basically I found this video more pro Obama than anti Obama because all the facts stated where pro and only made up conspiracy theories were negative.  Jessy ""The Body"" Ventura said that all republicans and Democrats are friends and that the whole arguing thing is bull like in Professional Wrestling.  Personally I have a hard time believing that two political parties made up of thousands of people get along as well and 20+ stunt men/women.

While there are some aspects of this film that I agree with, I find its critiques to be narrowly focused, its style to be manipulative (the spooky music is a bit overdone), and its endless promotion of Alex Jones and Prison Planet to be self-serving.  It begins to feel like an Alex Jones infomercial.  He postures as being the ""alternative media;"" yet, more trustworthy alternative media and analysis is being produced by people that Jones tends to attack - for example, Noam Chomsky and Amy Goodman - who Jones smears as ""gatekeepers.""

There were a lot of interviews with individuals that didn't really impress me as being all that knowledgeable as they did a lot of hem-hawwing throughout.  Nothing was really clear-cut or specific, and a lot of rhetoric came into the picture.  It primarily focuses upon the 'New World Order' and how the president is a puppet, but nothing points to anything factual beyond the 'possibility' that the president is meeting with an elite group of billionaires running the world in private meetings.  Again, nothing concrete came up in the movie, and the reviewer himself was highly over-emotional as if he had something clearly substantial to point out to the American viewer, but it just never came into the picture throughout the entire film.

172133,5,093085280X,"This well made film MIGHT have been shown in history classes in 1950, but NOT TODAY!! The only place we are getting even SOME truth is FOX NEWS, and as fast as their ratings ARE growing, there needs to be more, and also, they do have to soft peddle sometimes, as they don't want to get shut down.

I am 74 and my first memory is Pearl Harbor Sunday. It was many years before I realized that was what it was. The whole family gradually gathering in the old farm house, around the radio. Even the men were crying. Sitting on my Grandfather's lap, wiping his tears with the skirt of my ""best dress"", telling him everything would be OK. Before it was over, every young man in that room would be in uniform, including my father. Older men, women and chidren, worked the farms, increasing the acres tilled and the animals needed for food. (Funny part! Meat was rationed, but apparently rabbit did not get on the list. Grandpa bread like crazy, and sold not only dressed meat, but ""breeding pairs"", to get people in other neighborhoods to add to the ""available meat list""!!)

I relate this short family story because it would never happen today, in this country.  History has not been taught in this country for many years. Communitys, neighborhoods, are no longer ""Fanilies"". For the most part they do not know the last name and phone number of those living near them. In 1950, 75% of our families attended church as a family, 25% did not.  Today, those numbers are reversed!!

In those 9+ lines, I have  given you the road map of what we HAVE to do as a nation if we EVER hope to put a stop to the take-over of our beautiful, wonderful land.  Abraham Lincoln said that this country would NEVER be taken over by people from OFF our shores, but by those within.  This film shows just how right he was.  Since Lincoln, we have raised several generations, allowing them, ENCOURAGING THEM, to get softer and each decade more pampered and coddled. Except for RARE occasion, we have NOT expected our young people to be responsible, get good grades, treat others with respect....all those things that those of us over 70 were EXPECTED to show!!  At all times and to everyone!!

My peers, and those older and younger need to come together and TRY our best to turn this around.  We need to teach where we have allowed the schools to neglect.  History, and trade skills.  Homemaking and early childhood education....NOT IN THE SCHOOLS, BUT IN THE HOMES!!  We need to teach farming, canning, cooking, jamming and ALL the home making skills. At the same time we have to teach our history....WHY the founding fathers wrote what they did and what their expectations for the country were.

To reflect Lincoln, these tasks are NOT going to come from outside our country, but from within our country...from our parents and grandparents.  From all the ""How To"" books ever written.

Once our young people KNOW what ""VALUE"" is, they will pass it on to those coming behind them.  Without our input, they will never be able to do this.  It will be more of the same.  If you take a real good look at what all the countries of the world and what it has been that they so admired about the United States of America, this is what it has been, for generations.  Our ability to instill in our young people admiration for who they are, who their forefathers were and what they were going to have to do to pass it on.

When ""on the street"" reporters ask REALLY easy questions of people, young and no so old, they do NOT know the answer.  What was the ""Mayflower?""  What was the Magna Carta?""  ""Who was Thomas Paine""?

Get the film, watch it several times, take notes, pass it around to friends, have ""film parties"".  Then get to work.  Jean Turner",1354579200,7,3711,4.505231689088191

172140,4,093085280X,"Despite the appearance, the film ""The Obama Deception: The Mask Comes Off"" is not a partisan documentary produced to slam the current POTUS. Instead it slams past United States Presidents, Cabinet Appointees and politicians of both major political parties, including Jimmy Carter, George Bush Sr, Bill Clinton, George Bush Jr, Barack Obama, Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, Henry Kissinger, Hillary Clinton and many others. This film discusses in great detail the Bilderberg Group, a secretive society of big money elites who are bent on constructing the global ""New World Order"". The film gives background on the history of the Federal Reserve Bank, which in reality is a private bank that uses the appearance of being federally chartered.

In just a few short years all nations across the globe will be indebted to ""The World Bank"", which will control all global currency and ultimately own private property, while it enslaves the non-elite with a multitude of strategically manipulated interest rates and many new forms of taxation, some of which are listed in this film. It speaks of the manufactured financial crises that has enriched Wall Street, the hoax of Global Warming that has enriched Al Gore and other elitists, and the covert goal of creating the North American Union, North Americas version of the European Union, that will consolidate Canada, the Americas and Mexico and create a common currency. This elaborate scheme will federalize the 50 states, strip away First Amendement Freedoms of Speech by ratifying the Fairness Doctrine, strip away gun owner rights by repealing the Second Amendment and forcing American citizens into servitude to their government.

The film compares the Washington DC power brokers to professional wrestling performers. In front of the camera they're actors working to destroy each others character and belittle each others policies, but when the camera stops, they're socializing with one another and scheming to destroy America as we know it, all in the name of ""fairness"" or ""evening the playing field"". Barack Obama is simply the latest charismatic mouthpiece put into position to fool the people long enough to assist in bringing closure to a plan that will establish the New World Order with no interruption from the governed.

This documentary claims to be based on unbiased fact. I'm no conspiracy theorist but the film definately gives the thinking individual something to ponder. Todays world is not the place to sit idly by and trust our elected officials from either party, to do what is best for ""We The People"". Don't naiively trust any of the mass media news outlets to tell the unbiased truth, because each has an agenda (hidden or not) and each are ultimately controlled by big money operatives. Don't trust news publications, revisionist history or even this film, but do take an interest in what happens in our nation, in our world and behind the scenes politically. Do your own independent research, educate yourself to what the politicians are saying and how they actually follow through on their empty promises.

Politicians generally lie to get elected, and whoever can cleverly craft the biggest lie or make the most promises usually gets the nod. Shame on ""us"" for buying this garbage. I truly believe the United States of America is destined for some dark days ahead. If only a small percentage of this documentary is based on unbiased fact, we may already be past a point of no return.

It's well made and boy, it doesn't play favorites with anybody. It's totally non-partisan.

If you think this is a pro-Republican film, guess again. It slams both parties and takes aim at the current administration as well as all previous administrations. The only real hero mentioned was President Kennedy, who was shot for not playing pool with the power elite and we know what happened to him. Nothing was mentioned concerning Ronald Reagan...but Carter, Bush Sr., Bush Jr., Clinton, and Obama were all slammed.

I left this viewing with a terrible feeling of utter distrust of our government and sore disapppointment in all the presidents and legislatures, (Congress and Senate) realizing that these people are just sitting back and laughing at us.

We can no longer pretend we're a free nation. We're not! They can so easily rig polling results. I recently read where in various states they no longer require a person to show ID to prove who they are. Swell...now Mickey Mouse can register and vote without need to prove identity. What power do we really have?

The power elite are billionaires who control who ascends the ladder of power while the puppet-masters control those in elected positions.

The most incredible insult to the American people are the media....news agencies which kiss up to their handlers and print or report whatever they're told and withhold information people need. We're kept in the dark while they play games with our lives and our future.

My heart is heavy. When I think of the blood and treasure sacrificed for the sake of this country to provide us a safe haven to enjoy freedoms previously unknown to man....freedom of speech, freedom of religion and the dream of achieving a legacy for their decendents to praise and honor. But there will be no legacy to treasure in our history books.

We will see a sad repeat of history as we go the same road as the Third Reich and Adolph Hitler, Pol Pot in Cambodia, or Stalin in Russia. It's Communism all over again...that's exactly where we appar to be headed...right in front of our faces...it's happening.

It is the conspiracy approach, whether real or imagined, that I found informative rather than the demonization of one man that, as the film admits, is just one key player in a vast secret international organization.

On one hand, the film depicts Obama as a mere puppet unaware that he contributes to the tyranny or dictatorial government we all know and love, or hate, yet hold him responsible by targeting him as initiating Americas fall to facism.

Whats contradicting and ironic about this documentary (and the filmmakers as well, other than using Obama as the escape goat) is the decades/centuries of silence and complacency the American people were all the way past a two-term Bush presidency and all of a sudden, for some reason, Americans have opened their eyes to an all too intrusive government, learning civics and becoming politically active when this tragic comedy began long ago. Paying taxes and banks are/were fine when it came/comes to fighting communism or the destruction and near genocide of millions of indigenous peoples before Columbus.

Socialist programs and spending were/are ""okay"" when it came to displacing aboriginal peoples removals, civil rights, outlawing their religions, languages and forcibly removing native children into abusive and regimented boarding school systems.  Socialism with regard to billions for war and defense, a continued fueling and sponsoring of corrupt dictators and CIA trained terrorist, both of which we end up ""taking out"" around the globe, and yet this film paints American people as blind, sheepish victims of ""after the fact"" ignorance.

The only part of this film that I find worth noting is the fleecing of taxpayers banks and corporations have been doing over time. It reflects the ongoing handling of tribal accounts today the Bureau of Indian Affairs still holds on American Indians, but on a national scale against American citizens and global stage in third world countries. Evidently, its still okay to steal from native peoples, but you'll never convince most non-natives that the theft of life, lands, freedoms and cultural authenticity of the American Indian is worthy of concern since 99% of seating presidents legislated genocide over a span of two centuries. Is this karma?

There are just too many philosophical similiarities to the tea party and occupy Wallstreet movements here that right or wrong, the concerned citizens voicing dissent have corrupted both well intended revolts with racism, violence and just plain ridiculous uninformed people and no matter what your cause or concerns might be about Obama, liberals or Lady Gaga, nobody will take you serious when your followers do idiotic things.",1332547200,4,2770,5.241534988713318

5. This isn't fun to watch. I don't like watching this movie.
4. Obama is a cool guy that was born in America whether you like it or not.
3. I asked my mom if she likes Obama and she said yes.
2. Obama tries to help us, because he is the president.
1. Even if he was a Muslim, how would that be any different than Christian?

How is Obama any different from other presidents? He is no better and no worse. I would recommend watching NBC's ""Community"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" instead of this snooze fest.",1331510400,8,719,4.233576642335766

""Crazy"" people give us something about which to complain.

He interviews a lot of interesting, mostly not very famous or terribly erudite, people.  They express their common sense views in a very common sense fashion.

What one infers from watching this video is that Obama, and the Democrats, are the party of Big Government.  That's Big Brother Big Government.

While I don't care for the Republicans and their incessant warmongering, racial intolerance and attempts to take away what little reproductive rights women in America still have from them, it becomes clear from watching this video that Obama does NOT represent the people,  he is not ""on our side,"" unless, of course, you are a rich Wall Street banker,  and, as the video shows, he has reneged on almost all of his campaign pledges.

More banker bailouts, more war, more police state actions in the name of the ""War on Terror"", more destruction of the middle class economy as the money is peddled off to the International Bankers and Wall Street.

The two artists the other reviewer was asking about are KRS-One and Professor Grif of Public Enemy.  They saw through Obama's Cult of Personality.  Sharp guys.",1303344000,87,648,4.845454545454546

This controversial film will open your eyes to what is going on in the shadow government and puts things into perspective of who Obama works for. Theres no denying the fact that Obama has lied to America ever since he promised to clean up America. He has done the oposite. Decide for your own when the facts hit you in the face.

His promise for change turned out to be a big and blatant lie as his post election actions and appointments reflected business as usual and even worse than usual: he maintained Bush's defense secretary for a couple of years and instead of ending the Iraq and Afghan wars, he supported staying indefinitely in the first and expanding the US presence in the second. Prodded by his neocon friends/puppeteers he orchestrated (aided by the UK and France) new wars for ""democracy"" in Lybia, Egypt, Tunisia and particularly Syria a civilized and multicultural society unlike his feudal Arab Gulf allies, now torn apart!

Instead of pushing for the criminal prosecution of the Wall Street fraudsters and banksters who caused the financial devastation of millions of American families whilst enriching themselves beyond belief , he brought many of those responsible directly or indirectly for the financial catastrophe to be part of his White House team. Israel's multiple lobbies have never been as powerful and domineering as they are today in Congress and within the Obama administration.

In Cairo he spoke of justice and peace in the Middle East but instead has maintained Washington's unconditional support for Israeli crimes and abuses against Palestinians under occupation including relentless jewish only settlement building or expansion on stolen palestinian land. Obama 's actions have demonstrated to the world and to  an increasing number of Americans that all his campaign promises of change were fake and only intended to get him elected to the presidency of the most powerful oligarchic pseudo democracy in the world! America's noble and patriotic founding fathers must be turning in their graves for how corrupt their beloved country has become!

172159,4,093085280X,"This documentary rightly deserves to be called Alex Jones' masterpiece.  It's far more focused than any of Jones' other works  - which is to say it's far less rambling.  It's as if Jones and his editors decided to filter out as much of the irrelevant data that usually clutters his documentaries as possible. The result is a much clearer and a much more effective presentation of his central theme: the almost complete takeover of the world's economy by the international banking establishment. So far so good: there's very little one can say to debunk that idea since it's so transparently obvious that the bankers are calling most of the shots.  However - and that's a very big ""however"" - there is a monstrously glaring omission from Jones' scenario:  Big Oil.  He barely mentions Big Oil, and when he does it's only in passing - as if the international oil cartel were merely a pawn of international banking interests. Given that the various oil companies consistently post the highest earnings in the history of business, it's a quite a stretch to accept them as little more than handmaidens of the banks. That aside, it's almost impossible to seriously question, let alone debunk, the main thrust of his presentation of the banks' enormous power: the creation of President Obama as a tool of international banking.  He insists that every president since Kennedy has also been merely a tool of big banking - and that President Kennedy was, in fact, assassinated because he was not following the bankers agenda.  Again, it's not that difficult to accept this view of the American presidency, since every modern president seems to have done everything possible to promote a corporate agenda, even at the expense of the greater social good; and, more than any other president, Obama has consistently done a 180 degree shift away from everything he pledged to do during his campaign - not just some things, which you expect, but everything.
So, except for downplaying big oil's role in shaping American politics to its own interests, Jones seems to have presented an almost air-tight case for the virtual corporate takeover of the world's economy.  He should have stopped there; but, of course, being Alex Jones, he kept on until he managed to undercut his own thesis.  Two pieces of speculation almost - not quite, but almost - turned his studied and well documented presentation into a comic farce. The first involves, of all things, Social Security, which, according to Jones, was created by FDR entirely for the benefit of the bankers.  Here's how his reasoning goes: by 1933 the USA was totally bankrupt and was desperately in need of being re-financed by the international banking community.  What FDR did - wait for it! - was to put up the American people as collateral on the money he had asked the banks to loan the US government, the Social Security trust fund he set up being the mechanism for providing this bizarre ""collateral.""  A bit far-fetched, even for a man of Alex Jones' imagination; but, even so, not without a certain rationale, because it seems very clear that the banks are attempting to take over the Social Security trust fund - which, by the way is far from bankrupt and which the banks are acting as if it's rightfully theirs.  But in the final analysis, this notion of the American people being ""collateral"" must be accepted on faith.
The second piece of speculation involves climate change.  Jones considers global warming to be the biggest scam in history - which would put almost all of the world's leading scientists squarely in the banks' pockets. The reason for the climate change paradigm, in his view, is to enable the enactment of a ""carbon tax"" on a worldwide level.  Once again, no compelling evidence is offered for this bombshell; we must accept it on faith - just as he insists we have been accepting the worldview promulgated by the world's bankers on nothing but faith.
In the end, though as usual Alex Jones makes a very good case, he fails to make a convincing case.  As Carl Sagan had noted in his ""Cosmos"" series: if you make extraordinary claims, you must present extraordinary evidence.  And Alex Jones has not.",1281830400,6,4164,4.832630098452883

It is watchable for free on Youtube as well, but if you want to support the the producer and the truth movement, and like to make copies to share, go a head an buy a copy.

They interview some intelligent honest guys (Gerald Celente and Webster Tarpley for example) in this film who aren't afraid to speak the truth about what is going on.

Keep in mind you will almost never hear strait truth from main stream media, because the big shots own all of the media through just a handful of corporations. Some of the commentators on Fox are the exception in that at least they bring up some of what is going on, but not usually the whole picture.

The so called debunkers of this movie most likely don't even have their facts strait or they twist the meaning.

Of course because of the result of the battle he became a multimillionaire. Thus the Fiscal controlling interests must have been in charge at that time.

I am not convinced Kennedy was killed due to his failure with the Bilderberg and other groups although I admit they would hire the Mafia who I'm sure killed him.

It is essential that Obama and his group be totally destroyed if we are to prevent a fascist state arising in the USA. There is not actually a great deal of difference between a Communist and fascist State because both subjugate liberty although the communists pretend to hold elections.

Personally I feel that obama is too good to be true, he looks walks and talks like a live actor. It doesn't seem 'real' to me. I feel that we have lost our once golden creative american culture and it could be a sign that the media and television programs have been screwing with out heads thus dumbing our nation down. If you watch the film there's a scene where it shows all the television stations and mainstream companies that are owned by supposed ""wall street"" bandits and its almost enough to make you vomit.

Another thing, I have been scanning other reviews and noticed christians feel the need to shed this religious opinions. This film is far from religious so there's no need to post ""your!"" religious views on the future- lets stay on topic. The DVD Obama's Deception.
I gave it 5 stars because I thought the film was legit and by that mean it could be painstakingly real. It doesn't seem like a scam because the filmmaker encourages you to spread the word by making copies and giving them out for free. That speaks to me that he is behind his findings and I admire that.

After viewing The Obama Deception it was apparent that this film was made not more than one or two months after Obama's inauguration.  This is a problem because for much of the movie, Alex Jones and his commentators criticize Obama as if he has been in office for years.

Alex Jones also wrongly characterizes the Federal Reserve and the Breton Woods institutions such as the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund.

The Federal Reserve is not just some run of the mill private corporation, but the Federal Reserve is a chartered semi-autonomous public bank designed be a lender to smaller banks as well as be the source of financial stability by either increasing or decreasing financial liquidity as needed.  The Federal Reserve Bank is comparable the Bank of the United States which was originally created by Alexander Hamilton, but was dissolved by Andrew Jackson.  People who know their history, know that the United States suffered from many different economic crises during the 19th century as a result of not having a central bank.  Early in the 20th century these problems were addressed by creating the FED in 1913.

The Breton Woods institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF along with the United Nations have been labeled the New World Order since their creation soon after WWII.  Why were they labeled the New World Order?  Simple. To fill the vacuum left by the Old World Order, better known as the Concert of Europe.  These international organization were critical for a world that had suddenly emerged from colonialism after WWII.  There were suddenly many more nations in the world, such as India.  The old European colonial system was defunct and for the post WWII world, ""A New World Order"" was needed to facilitate economic and political interactions in a way that could help deter violent confrontations, such as the one that had just broken out in WWII.

The Obama Deception is an irresponsible movie which portrays these institutions, as well with the newly inaugurated President Obama, as puzzle pieces to some faceless international conspiracy hell bent on complete world wide domination over everyone's lives and the way they live.

The strangest thing I found about this film was the inscription on the front of the DVD. It says ""Please Copy And Share"". You don't have to believe what Alex Jones is saying, but as an American you really need to hear and see the facts.",1242950400,19,371,4.552238805970149

I ask anybody this question, after all these years we've voted these clowns in office has anything changed? If you said yes, your lying it has only gotten worst.

7793416,5,093085280X,"In my humble opinion alex jones did a fantastic job on this documentary.  It takes you through all of the ins and outs of how almost all of our corrupt politicians are bought, paid and sold by the un elected special foreign interests or who we call the globalists.  It gives you the history of all the families of the old robber barrons and how they have put a stranglehold on the influence of our country, and other countries.  Seems to me like the detractors who wrote some reviews obviously just do not want to accept the truth, as simple and plain as it may be. This documentary was as unbiased as it could be, attacking all sides of the isle. Obama was bought and paid for by George Soros for both terms and everyone else who was outlined to have backed him in this film. All fact based, and fact checked, without exception. People always use the same old tired point ""well he was the first african american president that was great for the country you bigot"" and now its just like give me a break already.  Sure, it would have been great for the country if he actually had the american peoples best interests in mind. That was all part of the Obama Deception though, it made him perfect for pushing the globalist/socialist agenda. He used his race as a fulcrum for leverage to intimidate and silence anyone who disagreed with his policies. Whether they were democrats, republicans, libertarians or independants they were immedietely called a racist, a bigot or they were discriminating and pushed into the halls of obscurity.  I think the first African American president should have been Herman Cain, a successful business man who worked hard for everything he has who appreciates what this country has to offer.  Obama went from being a community dis-organizer, to the president.  He never flipped a burger, ran a cash register, managed a kinkos or swung a sledge hammer.  The skids were greased for him the day he was born. If you still think obama is a good president, let me list some things down below.

1. 95 million americans atleast are without a job
2. 8-10 million more people are on food stamps
3. our debt went from 10 trillion to 20 trillion, obama incurred more debt than all other presidents combined
4. isis has almost completely taken over the middle east
5. we have had more terrorist attacks under his presidency then previous administrations
6. the crime rate has sky rocketed nationwide
7. he has de-balled the police and supports the domestic terrorist group BLM, invited them to the white house also
8. obama care was a total scam premiums are going up 25-45 % this year and people are getting fines for not having it up to 1500 dollars or more
9. more people are homeless now than before, i cannot even get out of philly when i have to go there for work without atleast 10 bums asking me for money to buy drugs
10. he passed the worst surveilance state bill since the freedom of information act which tracks the where abouts and conversations of up to 5 billion cell phones a day not limited to over seas like the liberals like to tell you shown in the snowden files
11. he has set back race relations in this country over 50 years
12. the economy is imploding, but like stalin he keeps printing and pumping money into it, like a bodybuilder pumping himself full of steroids.
13. his birth certificate was proven almost 3 weeks ago to be a fraud beyond a shadow of a doubt, he wasn't even a legitimate president
14. he has dissolved our borders and flooded the country with over 30 million illegal immigrints, just so the democrats could have a loyal voter baseline.
15.he keeps spreading false red scare propaganda, his aggression towards russia is going to push us into world war 3 if he keeps it up

I can keep going, and now this fruit cake withdrew our support from israel which cements the fact to me that he is a muslim supremacist. He just passed a bill where he is trying to federalize all news media through a Ministry Of Truth so the liberals can further manipulate the truth. America owes Alex Jones gratitude. If it wasn't for the likes of Alex and others we would still be force fed all the lies by the MSM. I highly reccomend it to anyone who likes unfiltered truth and who does not mind being taken out of their comfort zone for a spell.  Alex deserves even more credit because he put this on the internet for free just to enlighten the American people, and people of the world. Sweizer did the same with Clinton Cash. Alex and all the other modern day Paul Reveres, you are to be saluted, keep up the good work.",1483228800,,4559,4.50726392251816
