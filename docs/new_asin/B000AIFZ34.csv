However, I still wanted to see the documentary.... so, I had an idea, I requested that my local public library purchase the video - and to my surprise, the purchase was approved.

Being free (as a library check out) it was worth the watch...... but, if I had decided to purchase it for myself, and at the prices that it is normally listed for ($20-$30-$40)... I would have been extremely ticked off.

Don't purchase this item, unless the price is at least below $10 (the lower the better) - or, check with your local library to see if they can purchase it..... then just check it out - FREE!

I gave it a 3 star rating simply because I paid nothing to watch it.",1461283200,,791,4.404109589041096

8078567,3,B000AIFZ34,"I bought this since it is one of few or no movies about this topic and I spend quite a bit of time traveling and camped with other rubbertramps. Thought it would be informative.
I liked the topic, I liked the way it was done but I know for a fact that with a little looking the film-makers could have chosen their subjects better. It made me sad that they focused so much on stoners and derelicts...and less on the large numbers of regular folks living like that. My experience has been that there are relatively few people in the lifestyle who drink much or use drugs...amongst the folks I often camp with I have found a wise and energetic group of folks who have taken the reins of their lives in hand and made choices to live a low stress and inexpensive lifestyle out of the loop of debt and the down spiraling economy. In my opinion this movie really gives the wrong idea of what is a quickly growing population as the good jobs leave the country and the economy tanks....
This opinion is shared by everyone I have shown the movie too and those that I have talked to who own the movie. In short they are very disappointed that these filmmakers lost a wonderful opportunity to show a sustainable lifestyle and the many wonderful folks who live it.",1311379200,6,1251,4.396551724137931
8078568,2,B000AIFZ34,The video was more a biopic of the extremely impoverished individuals who live in their often run down rv/bus/vans.  Many used drugs and have mental illness.  Not a biopic about Ken Kessey or the 60's generation rubber tramps as the title would suggest.,1237248000,2,253,4.8604651162790695
8078569,5,B000AIFZ34,"The historical interest here is that it's probably the last media appearance by Ken Kesey before his death, and he talks about a lot of stuff.

The emotional interest is the people who are profiled - they live on the road and get along as best they can, hassled from all sides by the authorities, the stupid laws, and the uncomprehending housed people who just don't get it.

This is the best documentary I've seen in ages.",1149724800,20,423,4.48051948051948
