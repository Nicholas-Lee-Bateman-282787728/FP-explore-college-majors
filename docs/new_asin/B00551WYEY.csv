4571006,5,B00551WYEY,This is a great movie with wonderful acting and the all too familiar story of love gone wrong.  The acting was superb.  Granger really played the bad boy role well.  Loved it,1379548800,5,174,4.375
4571007,5,B00551WYEY,"This movie is an excellent bit of gothic British cinema - a gothic romance in the truest sense, greater doom than Cathy & Heathcliff. Some really well turned out performances by an excellent cast, gorgeous costuming and excellent settings. Snow! Real snow, even - meaning that part of the filming happened during an actual winter (I'm really impressed). A bit melodramatic but quite worth watching.",1316563200,4,398,5.138461538461539
4571008,4,B00551WYEY,"I first saw this movie about 25 years ago and never forgot it.  Valerie Hobson and Stewart Granger are terrific; the whole production is beautifully done.

The DVD-R version from Retro Flix doesn't have any frills (no menus, no extras), just the movie.  The picture and sound quality are very good.  Thanks to Retro Flix for making this movie available on DVD!",1288396800,8,360,4.758064516129032
