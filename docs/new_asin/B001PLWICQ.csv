3769399,5,B001PLWICQ,Just like herpes this video keeps on giving.  I look forward to the release of this dvd series every year.  This is the best documentary on rally races and the street scene.  I have watched many other car series but nothing compares to this.,1232928000,2,241,4.431818181818182

8336156,5,B001PLWICQ,"Mischief: Joyride is one of the best of all the Mischief series.  It hearkens back to the days of Mischief: 3000.  It is a shame that the Joyride rally fell apart, but that was not the fault of the Mischief crew - and you can tell they made the best of it!  If anything, I think the movie is funnier as a result of the breakdown of the rally.  The cars are fantastic, the characters are entertaining, and the editing is absolutely top notch!  If you want to see the REAL world of cars, this is it!",1240704000,,497,4.082474226804123
8336157,5,B001PLWICQ,Great new installment to the mischief series. The rally seems to fall through but there wasn't anything the crew documenting it could do to fix that.  Documented the rally well and broke up the story of that with lots of other action packed scenes and car show footage.,1240531200,,269,4.604166666666667
8336158,2,B001PLWICQ,"I own all the Mischief DVDs and was looking forward to this one.  What a disappointment after waiting for it to arrive.  Like the other reviewer said, it is the worst in the series.  JoyRide was said to be a charity rally, but this movie documents the true ""charity"" of almost all the people who dropped out after only the first stage.  I expected better from this movie, don't waste $20 on this.",1239148800,,396,4.383561643835616
8336159,3,B001PLWICQ,"I've been a big fan of the whole Mischief series. As a stand alone, compared to other gonzo-journalism style automotive documentaries this was good. Mischief will always have one of the best products on the market. However compared to the other videos in the Mischief franchise, Joyride was weak. All of it centered around an anticlimactic rally. It was like watching a caged wild animal die. Just sad. I'll support Mischief because I'm loyal like that and they have a track record for delivering great content. Do yourself a favor, get the original Mischief through Mischief Assault and wait for 8 to come out.",1236643200,,611,4.884615384615385
8336160,5,B001PLWICQ,"This is a pure back to basics/roots, of Mischief!
Remember Mischief 3000, it's now back!

Fast rallying (this is not a race damn it), across the USA. Speed, high end cars, reckless parts and fun as we seen in the others! But this one show the maturity of the series!
2 hours + of viewing! Too long? No, it's so nice that you don't even remark it, get bored or anything! You enjoy it all the way!

If you like the Mischief series, if you are a movie car addicted!
YOU MUST HAVE IT IN YOUR COLLECTION",1233878400,3,498,4.123711340206185
