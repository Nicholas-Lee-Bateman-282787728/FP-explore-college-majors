This live performance by Mr. Pezzone of  works of Mozart, Elgar and his  improvised variations on

8525464,5,B0085AXT00,"Beauty is often thought of as the synthesis of form, balance of elements, clarity of emotions, and technique that is so sophisticated in its simplicity that all the parts that make up the whole disappear in the service of creating a space for the pure integrity of emotion. Few artists accomplish this as it involves being open in such a truthful way that the artist is both wholly and ruthlessly present while simultaneously being a background object who opens as a vehicle for direct emotional connection to the listener/viewer.
Bryan Pezzone's artistry, technique and emotional depth co-operate at this level as he seamlessly moves from interpretations of pieces that are well-known, into his own compositions and improvisations. Similarly, the technical production by Mark Waldrep is so expert and sensitive that one is allowed to become totally immersed in the musical experience.
As music is considered to be the art of time and a representation of the emotional quality of the subjective, one could say that music is lived time made audible. Kairos means time as flux; a confluence and coexistence of past memory, present perception and future desire simultaneously. Kairos also means ""right timing"" and ""right place"" - a way of talking about an intuitive synchronous coincidence. This extraordinary visual/audio Blu-ray allows us to enjoy the coming together of artist and music, facilitated by the musical sensitivity of the director and the exceptional quality of the technology.
 Proust describes music as having the power to see with other eyes and says that it enables us to have something approaching ""the communication of souls"". Mr. Pezzone's beautiful music fulfills this through his artistry in this mysterious, complex, and ambiguous creation through which time and space are made clearly perceptible to the heart.",1347840000,,1833,5.298969072164948
8525465,5,B0085AXT00,"I'd never heard of Bryan Pezzone before purchasing this Blu-ray. That being said, the performance here is wonderful. He takes classical masterpieces and puts a new spin on them, breathing new life into already wonderful pieces. His playing is refined and not at all showy. His own compositions might be classified somewhere between jazz and new age.

While one reviewer bellow called it ""backround music"", I beg to differ. Not often do you see a musician with a background in jazz and classical, fusing the two in a unique way.

Relaxing, yes. Background music, no.

As far as the technical side of things is concerned, the producers have done an incredible job recording this performance. Listening to both surround mixes was quite an experience. It was hard to choose between the stage mix and the audience mix. Both sounded very life-like. While I don't have a 3D television, the video looked fairly good, even though I noticed a bit of pixelation.

I hope this paves the way for more blu-ray releases of solo piano music. Well done, AIX!",1347753600,2,1041,4.831460674157303
8525466,5,B0085AXT00,"Bryan Pezzone is showcased in this latest release from AIX Records.  Bryan's playing on this is amazing.  It is definitely and aural pleasure to sit down and listen to this great player.  AIX has captured the piano so precisely in this Blu-ray, it makes you feel like you are there with Bryan as he is playing.  The 3D video is absolutely stunning as well.  AIX has nailed it on this release.  With products that are this good, i will definitely be a returning customer and this album is HIGHLY recommended.",1346976000,,507,4.5777777777777775
8525467,5,B0085AXT00,"I'm the producer of the Bryan Pezzone project and couldn't feel better about the expressive nature of Bryan's playing. In fact, it was a track from this recording (the incredibly beautiful Berceuse) that Dolby Labs selected for inclusion on their most recent sampler, which also includes tracks from the San Francisco Symphony and others. His sensitivity and range of expression is impressive in a wide span of musical genres...including traditional classical repertoire. But it is his unique ability to improvise that elevates Bryan beyond most other pianists including those with much more celebrity! His variations on ""We Shall Overcome"" is a expression of true genius. The rest of the disc expands on his ability to craft unique music from familiar compositions.

I first met Bryan at Cal Arts when he was hired as one of the piano faculty. I was a recent graduate of the program having studied with Mel Powell and Morton Subotnick. Cal Arts, especially in the 1980's, was one of the foremost centers for contemporary music. Annually, we would put on a festival that drew Babbitt, Reich, Adams, Xenakis, Stockhausen and many others...and Bryan would perform as part of it...to great acclaim and fabulous reviews. As a junior member of the composition faculty, I was thrilled when Bryan agreed to perform a work of mine (""Piano Maps"" for MIDI piano and spatializer) at the 1989 New Music America Concert in New York City. His playing was superb and the resulting review is a cherished part of my past.

The opportunity to include Bryan in our 3D music sessions in June of 2010 was also a great thrill. He brought along another project because he is a member of Free Flight, James Walker's classical/jazz fusion ensemble. His performances on both this project and the Free Flight disc are nothing short of astounding, which is why he is in such demand on both coasts (a recent concert series in Martha's Vineyard with another AIX Records performer Delores Stevens is proof enough of his caliber of playing.

This is not a typical classical piano production. This project is not a technology experiment. This project captures a truly rare artist that transcends the normal stereotypes long associated with classical piano playing. But in the end, Bryan is an extraordinary talent...and he has been since I first met him way back in 1987. It is unusual for me to spend much time listening to my own work after I have completed them. But I can tell you that I use this particular disc quite often to unwind and drift off...soncially. The Berceuse is particularly suited to this task.

I'm particularly proud of the sound of the piano in this recording. For Bryan to come to my studio and tell me that he's never heard his playing reproduced with such accuracy and involvement is a great compliment. I strive to bring my experience with music, sound and technology to each project. As many audio engineers will tell you, it is very difficult to capture the majesty of a grand piano with its 88 notes, hundreds of strings and infinite variety of tonal variations. As with all AIX Records projects, we DO NOT master them. The timbral palette that comes from this particular Steinway Model D 9-foot instrument is left completely in tact. I do not advocate the use of dynamics or EQ on any of my projects. The true to life nature of the sound on this project is the result of a great player, a great instrument and a great chain of audio equipment. If and when you hear it, you'll know.

Finally, the disc does include video. In this particular case video in 3D. The stage is dressed with carpet, a backdrop and a lovely glass vase with gorgeous red flowers. The serenity that flows from the layout of the stage and the combination of wood and metal are completely consistent with the over concept of the project. Of course, the video is the bonus feature on all of our projects regardless of whether they are 2D or 3D or HD or SD. If you like to watch a wonderful player then great...enjoy the video. If not, then there's a button on your remote called ""Pure Audio"" that turns off the video and plays just the 5.1 surround music.

I love to hear from customers and if you experience this disc (you can check out a video on YouTube), please feel free to contact me. I work very hard to make products that no other company does or can. It's seems to be working because a recent review summed up by saying, ""what can I say about an AIX Records project that hasn't already been said...this is audio perfection!""",1345075200,7,4502,4.706852791878172
8525468,5,B0085AXT00,"Every once in a while Art speaks for itself, something that transcends into experience. This is one I highly recommend. The warmth in the performance by Bryan Pezzone, who is widely recognized as one of the single most gifted musicians of the times, breathes from the first note to the last. Of the many remarkable things about this performance, I particularly admire how genuine it is, passionate, gentle, selective (yet spontaneous), lyrical, profound (can go on), is a nicely balanced mix of classical works with improvisations and Pezzone's compositions, and with this technology, feels like he is sitting right next to you... it embodies traditions that rarely occur anymore... there are no edits in the performance, it was done in a single, inspirational take - think back to early 20th century recordings, where you had one shot in a concert hall - go back further to the performances of some of the most significant composers of all time (Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Liszt....) who believed improvisation was elemental, and improvised regularly in serious concert environments. Bryan does this here (and as a rule in his career), and creates a tapestry of musical wealth. Too often these days, this ability is lost in the rigidity of technicians, where the goal is note-perfection at the expense of depth and soulful communication. But any musician who has had the pleasure of working with Pezzone can attest to his extraordinary skill with literally any style of music, his ability to imbue compositions with an enormously wide spectrum of colors (which Waldrep captures amazingly well!). Where most recordings feel like a photograph of a performance, THIS feels like you are right there, in the moment, experiencing the concert live.

The quality of the video is spectacular, brilliant clarity of both sound and image. The technology is VERY impressive, breathtaking results. The stage is beautifully set. The extras on the disc are not to be missed, including a one-hour interview with Pezzone, which is brimming with life and insight.

Elegant in every sense. Bravo!!",1345075200,4,2076,5.15727002967359
8525469,2,B0085AXT00,"Let me start by saying that AIX records is my favorite label. I am a serious surround sound enthusiast, and I am over and over again amazed by the beautiful job of surround sound mixing which Mark Waldrep and his team consistently delivers in each of his DVD-Audio and BR disks (which are sold directly directly through their web site and at several boutique internet record stores). I am very happy to see that his work finally has reached a wider audience through mainstream distribution channels.

AIX records is a small label which specializes in recording small-scale local artists who live and perform in the Los Angeles area. Not all of them are equally good. Many of the performances recorded by AIX were a disappointment performance-wise, saved only by a phenomenal recording and surround mix, while others were great in all respects.

The disk has ample information about Bryan Pezzone background. He obtain his Bachelor of Music from the Eastman School of music - a college in Rochester, NY, specializing in classical and jazz music - in 1984. Bryan is a cross-over pianist who performs in classical, contemporary, jazz, and experimental genres. He performs with symphony orchestra associations, tours widely with the jazz group Free Flight, and is known in the Los Angeles area as a freelance pianist for film and TV soundtrack recordings, contemporary music premieres, and chamber music. He recorded several CDs, primarily with contemporary music and jazz.

Now about my impressions from this BR disk. First of all - performance. My judgement is based on our family traditions: my wife is a professional (classical) pianist, and during our married life I've heard more classical piano music - both at home and in concert halls - than most people in their lifetime. With this background, I can say that this album could compete for an award for the worst performance of professionally recorded and distributed through major retailer classical music. Mr. Pezzone lacks both the technique which is required for concert performance of the classical repertoire and the expression required by music of some of the composers which he plays. The only good thing which I can say about his performance is that he brings that jazzy, easy listening style to his performance that makes this music a good background which is perfectly suited to play softly during a dinner or at a doctor's office waiting room (the only thing is that in this case you do not need the video...). My wife could not stand Mr. Pezzone's performance for longer than a few minutes, while I, owing to my interest in jazz and in the AIX recording work, watched most of it. I think my expectations were too high. This is more of a promotion of a local artist than anything else - which is good in its own way...

3D is very well done, one of the best I've seen, amazingly good for such kind of video. It is one of rare 3D blu-rays with so strong 3D presence that it is best watched from a distance. One could use this video in a TV retail store to impress people with how live-like a 3D video may look like. If AIX was trying to make a great 3D impression, they achieved their goal and had beaten many professional movie studios in making great 3D. I can't help noting, though, that many of these 3D effects were achieved by placing huge bowls of flowers in front of the piano, or taking shots with microphones right in front of the viewerer. While there is nothing wrong about it, they completely distract from watching the pianist. You can't keep yourself from focusing on the objects placed in the space in front of you instead of watching the performance. Also, zooming in on Mr. Pezzone's shoes while he was pressing on the pedals was - although impressive in 3D - a somewhat tasteless idea, which in my opinion is not very appropriate for this kind of video.

Sound - as always - is something that you likely have never heard before, if you are new to AIX. This company is very daring and innovative when it comes to mixing in surround. Before I heard AIX, I never thought that the piano can be recorded like this. Whether it is the right thing to do - is arguable. There are two types of surround mixes on the disk, in addition to high resolution flac, headphones-specific, and mp3 tracks accessible on a computer with a BR drive. The ""stage"" mix puts you right in the middle of the grand piano, with sound coming from behind, from inside of your head, and from the front, depending on which key the pianist presses. Some people may not like it because it is too untraditional (but for this case, there is also an ""audience"" mix which can be chosen from the menu), while others will be impressed. In any case, it is fact that noone - besides AIX - records the piano like that. You need a decent surround sound system to hear and appreciate (or dislike) this. The sound is very clean and transparent, although there is something in it which makes it sound a little different from how most Steinways are voiced. Not sure if it is the piano, the recording, or the mastering in which the sound got some EQ applied.

Overall, AIX picked a poor performer but did - as usual - innovative and impressive job recording the video and mixing surround sound. While - to my taste -it is not the best AIX record, it is not the worst either, and it certainly has all that AIX is about - innovative surround sound. I think this recording would've come out much better if Mr. Pezzone had chosen to perform jazz pieces (possibly with his jazz band), which I am sure he can do much better than classics.

The bottom line - before you watch the video, set your expectations on an ""easy listening"" classsic-like background music recorded in neat surround and combined with an impressive 3D. Do not read the title promising Mozart and Schubert, and do not expect it to be a good classical music performace. If you have never heard about AIX, you should give this disk a try, despite all my critique. Remember - AIX is a surround sound recording company ahead of anything else! If you do not have a reasonably good surround sound system - you will lose half of the experience, but you will still have the great 3D...",1343952000,8,6173,4.631963470319635
