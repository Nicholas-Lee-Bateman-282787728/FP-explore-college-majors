2258242,5,B0008ENID4,"I agree that Warner should not have included the 2 repeats in the Crawford box set. But it could be worse...think of all those poor Bette Davis fans out there! Not only do they have to deal with that puffy face and those constantly twitching hand movements of hers, but they have THREE repeats in the Davis box set!!! lol.",1112227200,12,322,4.383333333333334
2258243,5,B0008ENID4,"A Joan Crawford DVD box set, complete with three films available on DVD for the first time--Possessed (1947), Humoresque (1946), and The Damned Don't Cry (1950). The Damned Don't Cry has never been released in any format--VHS or DVD--so snatch it up while you can (it is and excellent Joan Crawford star vehicle, concerning gangsters and a fine collection of 1950 Mercurys!).  The full set includes also the DVD releases of Mildred Pierce and The Women (both great films as well).

I've heard that ""Possessed"" has received a complete restoration, and I'm sure the other titles have been cleaned up as well, so this is an excellent opportunity to own some of Joan Crawford's rarer films, and at a bargain price!

Looking at the release date, it seems ""The Joan Crawford Collection"" is going head-to-head with ""The Bette Davis Collection,"" released on the same day!  So if you are an admirer or fan of Crawford's, I urge you to buy this wonderful set right away (and give Davis fans a run for their money!).

Let the competition begin!  It's Crawford VS. Davis in DVD sales!  Who will win?",1111968000,17,1087,4.75
2258254,4,B0008ENID4,"Mildred Pierce and Humoresque are my favorite movies from this collection.  Humoresque because John Garfield is so real and he worked hard to get his role perfect, the music is spectacular with Issac Stern making his fame as a concert violinist. Crawford is grandiose and self focused as usual.  In Mildred Pierce, Joan Crawford plays a more realistic character.",1494633600,,362,5.11864406779661

2258256,5,B0008ENID4,"These are mostly excellent movies.  ""Mildred Pierce"" qualifies as a masterpiece, with a psychologically complex portrayal.  In fact, each characterization in the set hits a high mark.  The only one I can't rave about is ""The Women,"" but even here it's decent work on her part, and the piece is a part of our film and theatre history, so yuh gotta see it at some point.  But all the transfers are good, and I'm sure I'll watch each one a few times over the years.
Safe bet.",1489017600,,472,4.390804597701149

2258377,5,B0008ENID4,"For a description of the plot, etc. on each movie, read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this set...

This mini set of Joan Crawford movies is a winner all around.  Here is a breakdown of what you get and what I think of each movie:

Mildred Pierce (1945) - A classic that won Crawford the Academy Award for Best Actress, 1945.  Crawford gives a career performance in this roller coaster of a ride.  Twists and turns and the unpredictable.  It's also a great movie that falls into the category of ""film noir"" - movies made between circa 1940-1965 that are dark, shadowy, suspenseful, glamorous, and a lot of times scary.  I see them as one step below true horror movie level.  This DVD comes with an awesome hour and a half long documentary on Joan Crawford.  A must see.  5 STARS

Humoresque (1946) - Another classic film noir movie with great music and a great story.  Crawford is in top form and plays one of her classic characters, the alcoholic socialite Helen Wright.  Also stars John Garfield, Joan Chandler, and Oscar Levant.  Every actor was perfectly cast and each did a great job.  This movie has many powerful and enduring classic images.  A powerful movie that will stay with you long after you see it.  5 STARS

Possessed (1947) - Another film noir classic that has Crawford being un-Crawford-like in a lot of ways, everything from her appearance to her acting, which is top notch.  Many people feel this was Crawford's finest acting performance of her career.  It might actually be.  Crawford was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress.  Dark and moody, this movie is a winner all around.  I also enjoy Drew Casper's in-depth audio commentary.  5 STARS

The Damned Don't Cry (1950) - Yet another great movie.  A film noir classic.  Crawford seems to wear many hats in this movie.  Vintage Joan Crawford is the best way to sum up this movie.  4 1/2 STARS

All four movies in this set are great.  My top three are Mildred Pierce, Humoresque, and Possessed.

If you're a Joan Crawford fan and a fan of the film noir genre in general, this is a great mini set to get and it's inexpensive.  The only negative about this set is the packaging.  The DVDs are stacked on top of one another like pancakes, which is a no-no if you want scratch-free and skip-free DVDs.

Watch these movies and get lost in them.  I highly recommend this set.",1372204800,2,2358,4.555023923444976
2258378,5,B0008ENID4,"If one of your favorites is only available once in a while on Classic Movie channels, grab this collection to have it at your fingertips. Price was terrific for four movies in one package. Video and sound quality is what you would expect from a 60 year old movie.",1370217600,,263,4.387755102040816
2258379,5,B0008ENID4,"These are beautifully rendered copies and catches JC at the pinacle of her forties/fifties fame. Good stories and her pairing with John Garfield for me is especially enjoyable. This set shows how with the driven determination of Miss Crawford kept her a money maker for the studios for many, many years. There wasn't a tougher star but also talented. The Women is a bitchy classic and the cast is outstanding in a cleverly directed film. The color fashion sequence is boring in content, but women of the thirties probably enjoyed it. Never-the-less, these films are a must for Crawford fans and I'd say 2 or 3 out of the five are classic and the balance is a bonus.",1369785600,,665,4.6440677966101696

2258382,4,B0008ENID4,"Love all but one of the movies.  Humoresque was very boring for me, although I love violin music I found myself fast forwarding through the numerous musical scenes.

2258393,5,B0008ENID4,"Though I must say I'm a bigger fan of Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield, Mamie Van Doren, Elizabeth Taylor, Doris Day, Rita Hayworth, etc., I must also admit that Joan Crawford (1905-1977) was a excellent actress. Up until I purchased this item (at my local Wal-Mart for $15--not this store!), I had only two films that featured Miss Crawford. I have her film ""Grand Hotel"" (MGM; 1932), in which she played a stenographer alongside Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Wallace Beery, and Lionel Barrymore, and ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"" (Warner Bros.; 1962), in which she played a former A-list (now elderly crippled) movie star who is neglected and totured by her sister, played by Bette Davis. Crawford was on a B+ to a A scale in these films and I wanted more of her. I convinced my mother to buy this for me at are local Wal-Mart for $15, not like $20 here! I was surprised that four of Miss Crawford's most acclaimed films were released in a B-B+ set and for a low price.

The films included in the set are:
*""Mildred Pierce"" (1945) released by Warner Brothers. Crawford plays the title role of a somewhat overlooked and mistreated mother of two who divorces her husband, eventually opens a restaurant (called ""Mildred's""), has her youngest child die, and tries to cover up her oldest daughter's homicide case. Co-stars: Jack Carson, Zachary Scott, Ann Blyth, Eve Arden, and Butterly McQueen. Miss Crawford was nominated/won an Academy Award for her stunning performance.

*""Humoresque"" (1946) released by Warner Brothers. This melodrama of older woman/younger man love is second to ""Mildred Pierce"". Joan is still impressive and co-stars include John Garfield, Oscar Levant, J. Carrol Naish, and Joan Chandler.

*The last two films, ""Possessed"" (1947) and ""The Damned Don't Cry!"" (1950) both released by Warner Brothers, are less impressing of the releases. However, Crawford was nominated for an Oscar for ""Possessed"" and garnered rave reviews for ""Damned Don't Cry!"" But, to me, these films don't showcase Crawford to her greatest abilities as the two previous films mentioned.

All and all this collection of Joan Crawford films recieves and B-B+ rating from me. The five-star ratings is for ""Mildred Pierece""! Look for other releases of TCM Classical Releases for stars included Bette Davis, Doris Day, Katharine Hepburn, and many more!",1342742400,3,2344,5.064766839378239

Four of the five films come from Joan's Warner years (including her Oscar-winning material from Mildred Pierce and Oscar-nom for Possessed). Humoresque -- a film mixed with romance, music and tragdey is a masterpiece. The Women -- an all-woman cast blended with cattiness and gossip and one of the first movies Joan plays a b**** in.  The Damned Don't Cry -- based on a true story a woman who leaves her sad, dissatified homelife that lands her in the crime world.  On the Mildred Pierce disc there is a filmdoc on the legendary actress (BEWARE: Christina is in it trying to discredit).

2258397,4,B0008ENID4,"This is a good collection.  These are all good examples of Crawford's work.  The trouble is trying to collect a group of her films.  She had so many ""periods"" and styles throughout a long career.  With the exception of MGM's The Women - and that not a typical vehicle, since it's a large ensemble cast - all of these films are from her Warner's phase.  More than that, three of the five were made right in a row.  Mildred Pierce, Humoresque, and Possessed are three of her best films, but including them all here doesn't help toward giving an overview of her film career.  Purchasing Volume Two helps the situation; there are more from her earlier MGM days.  (Though those three are still not her more important roles from that part of her career.)

Aside from this issue, this is a collection to have, if you're an admirer of her work.  Well-mounted, with all the extras.",1291852800,,872,4.532051282051282

2258400,5,B0008ENID4,"Not a bad one in the bunch!  This is a wonderful collection of Joan Crawford movies, mainly from the 40s.  It begins with The Women where Joan Crawford struggling with her career took on the role of husband stealer Crystal Allen.  She wasn't able to save her MGM contract but went out with style.  After not working for 3 years, she was told by her agent to work in anything no matter how bad, she ended up with a great script in Mildred Pierce.  After that, the movies in the collection are Humoresque, which is my favorite Crawford movie, Possessed and The Damned Don't Cry.  Humoresque is about a young man with a gift for the violin who is helped by an older patroness in Joan Crawford.  The two fall in love but the woman's past haunts her and prevents her from being able to create a stable relationship with him.  Possessed is about Joan as a mentally unstable woman who keeps running after a man who rejects her but marries a man who loves her.  I like this movie but felt the characters weren't likable.  The last was a film I had never heard of, The Damned Don't Cry.  Joan plays a woman who grew up on the oil fields and tries to make a better life for herself, eventually ending up with gangsters.  It is a very fast paced film and very enjoyable.  I'm glad I discovered it and it was in this collection.  The documentaries on Joan and the commentary from the director of The Damned Don't Cry are stand outs.",1281225600,5,1420,4.329545454545454

The jewel here, of course, is Joan's Oscar winning perfromance in ""Mildred Pierce""; this DVD also comes with a wonderful documentary on the Crawford phenomenon, which is the most informative piece of work on her life ever produced.

2258407,5,B0008ENID4,"I'd put off getting this boxed set because it never went on sale. That is true of both this set and the Judy Garland Signature Collection. I finally did get this one, and for the past few days I've gone through the set and I can see why it's never on sale. Although I frequently see ""The Women"" and ""Mildred Pierce"" televised, it had been awhile for two of the others, and I had never seen ""Humoresque"" before. What a treat, what five outstanding films. You could honestly say that ""The Women"" and ""Humoresque"" are not really Joan's films. The leads are actually Norma Shearer and John Garfield, respectively. However, even in these films Joan plays a critical role I can't see going to any other actress, and that's an odd thing to say since they are both two very different films.

""The Women"" is really the only film even bordering on comedy, with the other four being rather dark, and reflecting the domination of film noir during the post-WWII period. Other people have mentioned the plot details, so let me just say a few words about the extra features. WHV has consistently put out the best classic film boxed sets on the market, and this is one of them. They always pack these things with extra features, and they seem to know what kind of extra features suit each set. For example, the Warner Gangsters franchise always gets the Warner Night at the Movies treatment (a short subject, a cartoon, and a newsreel), and it fits. Likewise WHV seemed to know that humorous old MGM shorts and Bugs Bunny would just be an odd fit for Joan's films, although the humorous ""The Women"" does have some old 30's short subjects on its disc. Instead, we get some topnotch commentary and featurettes that focus on different aspects of the films. Well done WHV, this is a great salute to Joan.",1215129600,,1784,4.575

The Damed Dont Cry and Mildred Pierce were my favorite out of the set. I am now watching vol. 2 , Joan Crawford. She is a star with class.",1214179200,,475,3.9583333333333335
2258409,5,B0008ENID4,"Having been brought up one block from 42nd St. and two blocks from Broadway, what can I tell you?  At six years old, I was totally in love with Rita Hayworth, and wanted her to wait for me, but she went off and married some older, more wealthy men. (Go figure.) I also believed that all truly beautiful women were like Joan Crawford, e.g., ""handle with care"" and ""proceed with caution"".  (Ha, ha)

I can tell you that ""The Joan Crawford Collection, Vol. 1"" is a keeper.  It features her films:  ""The Women"" with Rosalind Russell (1939), ""Humoresque"" with John Garfield, ""Mildred Pierce"" (1945) with Zachary Scott for which she won the Academy Award in 1946, ""Possessed"" (1947) with Van Heflin for which she was nominated for an Academy Award in 1948, and ""The Damned Don't Cry"" (1950) with Kent Smith.  She was a wonderful actress, a Hollywood icon, a trailblazer for American women, and yet, very much, a woman of her time and culture.

My suggestion is to watch these films in chronological order to really get more of a feel for Joan's evolution at Warner Bros.  My personal favorites are ""Humoresque"" (great score) with John Garfield and ""Mildred Pierce"" with Zachary Scott (an excellent, but underrated actor, except to those in the business).  Nevertheless, all the films are worthwhile examples of film noir, romance, suspense, and melodrama.

I'm not especially thrilled with the film commentaries and support material, except on ""Possessed"", which is more informative.  Also, Director Vincent Sherman's film commentary on ""The Damned Don't Cry"" was disappointingly redundant.  Understandably, he was along in years when he did this commentary, and, in fact, died in 2006, a year after this DVD set was released.  It's a shame because he could have provided so much more about the technical aspects of his direction of the film.  Regrettably, Vincent Sherman, like John Garfield, had been caught up in the ""Red Scare"" and House on Un-American Activities in the late Forties, which resulted in the end of his career in Hollywood.  Subsequently, he went on to work as a director in television.

While not a perfect set, Joan Crawford still makes it all worthwhile and five stars.",1202256000,2,2185,4.9289617486338795
2258410,5,B0008ENID4,"Joan Crawford Collection Vol. 2 (R1) in February - Artwork added
Warner Home Video have announced the Region 1 DVD release of the Joan Crawford Collection Volume 2 on 12th February 2008. Following the success of its best-selling Joan Crawford Collection in 2005, Warner brings you a new set of Crawford classics featuring some of the Oscar-winning actress' finest films - A Woman's Face, Flamingo Road, Sadie McKee, Strange Cargo and Torch Song. Drawn from her years at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Warner Bros., each film has been restored and remastered for its DVD debut, with bonus material including new featurettes, radio shows, vintage short subjects, trailers, and much more. Packaged as a collectible gift set, the five-disc Joan Crawford Collection Vol. 2 will sell for $49.92 SRP.

Sadie McKee (1934)
Sadie McKee was made during the period when Crawford was queen of the box-office, and every film she made was sure to be a hit. Many of them followed a similar formula, where Crawford rises from poverty to wealth, with conflict between two suitors vying for her affections. What sets this film apart from most of her other work of the era, is the direction of the legendary Clarence Brown, whose fine talents brought out the best in Metro's stars, most notably Garbo and Crawford. Co-starring with Franchot Tone (whom she would marry the following year), Gene Raymond, and Edward Arnold, the film is also well-known for being the Crawford film her Blanche Hudson character watches on television years later in the unforgettable Whatever Happened to Baby Jane (1962). In addition, Sadie McKee is famous for introducing the classic Arthur Freed/Nacio Herb Brown song ""All I Do is Dream of You.""

Strange Cargo (1940)
Joan Crawford first shared the screen in 1931 with an up-and-coming young actor whose charm and machismo would soon make him a superstar. The film was called Laughing Sinners and the leading man was none other than Clark Gable. Their on-screen chemistry was undeniable, and Metro ended up teaming them in a total of eight films over the next 9 years (including Dancing Lady, also available on DVD from WHV). Strange Cargo was their 8th and final collaboration, a rugged adventure story that eschewed the usual M-G-M elegance that had been present in so many of their other films together. Under the superb direction of Frank Borzage (Seventh Heaven, The Mortal Storm), this film is the rare action-packed adventure that carries an underlying spiritual theme which further enhances the Crawford/Gable chemistry. The film co-stars a bevy of famous Hollywood character actors, including Paul Lukas and the legendary Peter Lorre.

A Woman's Face (1941)
It was director George Cukor who helped Crawford break free of her usual screen persona in 1939's The Women, and in this dark thriller the masterful director brought out one of the leading lady's best performances. Based on the play ""Il Etat Une Fois"" (It was one time"") by Francis de Croisset, A Woman's Face casts Crawford as a horribly disfigured woman whose inner pain motivates her to live a life of evil. A kind doctor gives her a chance to remove her outer ugliness, and shows her a path to love and happiness, but can she adjust to this after years of such darkness? This conflict allowed Crawford to show her broad range as a talented actress, a task she felt essential at that point in her career. Despite excellent reviews for the film, and especially for Crawford, Cukor, and the leading man Melvyn Douglas, the film did not succeed initially at the box-office. It was only after re-release in later years that it finally earned its place as a true classic within the incomparable pantheon of M-G-M's finest dramas.

Flamingo Road (1949)
Joan Crawford's move from M-G-M to Warner Bros. in the mid-`40s, revitalized her screen career under the direction of Michael Curtiz in the smash hit that earned her the Best Actress Oscar, Mildred Pierce (1945). Crawford's Warner years continued to strengthen her stature as one of Hollywood's biggest stars, and Flamingo Road provided a reunion between Crawford and Curtiz for the first time since Mildred Pierce. Crawford plays Lane Bellamy, a dancer touring with a low-rent carnival, who finds more than she bargained for when she ends up on Flamingo Road. The impressive list of supporting players includes Sydney Greenstreet, Zachary Scott and David Brian. The film was later the basis for a 1980s television series.

Torch Song (1953)
Joan Crawford made her highly-publicized return to M-G-M after a decade away to star in Torch Song, her first feature film entirely in Technicolor. This sudsy melodrama, directed by Charles Walters (High Society) has become a cult classic. Crawford portrays Broadway musical star Jenny Stewart, who seems to have everything in life - except someone to love. While most people `cow-tow' to her diva-like behavior, only Ty Graham (played by Elizabeth Taylor's then-husband Michael Wilding), a pianist blinded during WWII, will stand up to her. Graham's secret passion for Jenny eventually awakens her vulnerability. But will they get together for a happy ending?

This is the film that inspired Carol Burnett's famous parody Torchy Song, and an audience favorite that has been unavailable on home video for nearly 15 years. By popular demand, audiences can now watch Crawford's famous dances, and her musical emoting (with vocals dubbed by singer India Adams). Actress Marjorie Rambeau gives a memorable star turn as Crawford's beer-chugging Mom, a role that earned the venerable character actress an Oscar nomination.

Original Trailer

Why was Miss Crawford such a fascinating and unconventional star...?

Miss Crawford was a first-rate star, who worked her a-s-s off to get to where she was! And, do you know what she did once she got there? She worked 10 times harder...! Joan had the longest and most impressive film career of any star during Tinseltown's famed Golden Age of Cinema! Joan's career lasted 5 decades! And her career proved to be more loyal to her than any lover or husband! Miss Crawford was always known for her fashion-sense, classical beauty and the ability to constantly re-invent herself (half a century before the Material Girl was a household name!)

Joan Crawford started her career in 1925 as a flapper, playing in bit parts as a contract-player for the most glorious studio in town, MGM. She was nothing more than a glorified prop, unbilled in her first film, ""Lady of the Night."" Soon, Joan was promoted to leading-lady, appearing in such critically-acclaimed pictures as, Harry Langdon's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tramp-Tramp-Tramp/dp/B00004Z4W3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tramp Tramp Tramp</a>, and Lon Chaney's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Unknown/dp/B0000B1O9L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Unknown</a>. But it wasn't until Joan accepted the role of Diana Medford, in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Our-Dancing-Daughters/dp/6302048982/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Our Dancing Daughters</a>&nbsp;that she became a bona fide star! By the end of the decade Joan had more than 20 pictures under her belt!

In the 30's when many silent stars were bowing out gracefully, Joan was back with a vengeance! This time Joan was the little shop girl that Depression-Era American ladies (and maybe even some boys, too) could really identify with. Miss Crawford could be seen acting in such famed movies as, ""Letty Lynton,""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rain/dp/B00011D1MC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rain</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grand-Hotel/dp/B0009S4IKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grand Hotel </a>, and one of my personal favorites,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forsaking-All-Others/dp/630241346X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forsaking All Others </a>. Some of the 25 classics that Joan also made during the 30's include:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dancing-Lady/dp/B000F7CMPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dancing Lady</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Laughing-Sinners/dp/630278705X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Laughing Sinners</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dance-Fools-Dance/dp/6302041120/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dance, Fools, Dance</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chained/dp/6302241170/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chained</a>, ""No More Ladies,"" The Gorgeous Hussy, Love on the Run (1936), The Bride Wore Red, Mannequin (1938) and of course one of her most popular ever, The Women !

""No more g*ddamn shop girls,"" Joan was once quoted as saying to MGM chief-honcho, Louis B. Mayer. In the 40's Joan yet again came back in another one of her many incarnations, this time as the society matron in such movies as, When Ladies Meet (1941), Reunion in France and Above Suspicion. Miss Crawford donated her entire salary from They All Kissed the Bride to charity and then she turned around and fired her agent when he didn't do the same! After 18 years of being a member of the MGM family, Miss Crawford took a huge gamble and decided to branch out, this time working for the actor's studio, Warners. Joan's first film for Warners, was her most famous movie, and it garnered her the Oscar for Best Actress; playing the title role in her defining-film, Mildred Pierce . Joan also made a slew other first-rate pictures during this period, such as: Humoresque and ""Daisy Kenyon."" Moving to Warners really paid off for Miss Crawford, because she also received her second Academy Award nomination for Possessed, playing the harried Louise Howell! Of course, Miss Crawford had all the time in the world to donate to the war-effort. Joan was often seen at the Hollywood Canteen entertaining our boys; ...how many of today's movie stars get off their pedestals to do this?

The 50's marked a very pivotal time in Joan's illustrious career. Because in the next chapter of her picture resume, she played the strong female leading-lady in many wonderful dramatic pictures. Such as, Harriet Craig, Queen Bee, ""Female on the Beach,"" The Damned Don't Cry, ""Goodbye My Fancy,"" The Story of Esther Costello and Autumn Leaves. Miss Crawford also received her third Academy Award nomination playing Myra Hudson in RKO's Sudden Fear. And never one to be typecast, Joan made a big splash in Johnny Guitar, playing a tough saloon owner in the wild-west! Also beginning in the 50's, Joan took up the campaign as official spokeswoman for Pepsi-Cola; a coveted role that she enjoyed for more than 18 years!

In the 60's Miss Crawford didn't slow down for a second! Nope! She came out swinging. Joan made the whole country ask in droves, What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?  in one of her most well-known pictures ever. Joan played Blanche Hudson, opposite another very talented actress, Ms. Bette Davis, in this gorgeous Warners film! It was also around this time, that Miss Crawford penned her autobiography, A Portrait of Joan Crawford. Throughout all the 60's Miss Crawford was known as the ""Scream Queen."" She stared in such famous thrillers as, Strait-Jacket, Della, I Saw What You Did and Berserk!

Even in semi-retirement, Miss Crawford still always kept busy during the 1970's. This time she was the Hollywood Legend, and everyone knew it! When the movie studios weren't knocking on her door, she switched to television. In one of her last television appearances, Miss Crawford played the part of Joan Fairchild in ABC's ""The Sixth Sense: Dear Joan: We're Going to Scare You to Death."" She also wrote her second book, the best-selling My Way of Life. And, Joan always found the time for some of her favorite charities; donating her talent and time to The Muscular Dystrophy Association and The American Cancer Society. Of course, Joan also made time to speak to her good friend and journalist Roy Newquist. Mr. Newquist was actually the only journalist that Miss Crawford chose to speak to during the late 70's, and his thoughtful (and unprecedented) interviews with Joan were published in the 1980 book, Conversations with Joan Crawford.

Miss Crawford died a second time when the vast majority of the public threw her away and forgot about all of her classic pictures. Over the 30 years since Miss Crawford's untimely death there has been so much garbage and lies printed about her; she has been vilified as a violent kook. The real Joan was a self-made lady who worked for everything she got. Joan just wanted to keep her head above water in a man's world where women didn't have a voice or a choice. Miss Crawford never for a second forgot where she came from or who she was, and she never for a moment let her beloved fans down. All Joan wanted was for someone to give her a chance and believe in her; and once they showed her a little bit of courtesy they had a friend for life in Miss Crawford. I am so happy that this set is coming out because maybe now the public can see the real Joan Crawford and remember her as she truly was!",1189900800,53,10637,5.663111668757842

THE DAMNED DON'T CRY - Joan Crawford plays a gangster's moll who climbs up from the gutter only to discover that life at the top can be twice as dangerous.  Extra features include the new featurette ""The Crawford Formula: Real and Reel"", audio commentary with director Vincent Sherman, and the trailer.

POSSESSED - Love takes a deadly turn in this noir drama.  Crawford plays Louise Howell, a woman driven to desperate measures--and madness--when ex-boyfriend Van Heflin wants to marry her stepdaughter.  Extra features include audio commentary by Dr. Drew Casper, featurette ""The Quintessential Film Noir"", and the trailer.

HUMORESQUE - Crawford gives one of her most nuanced performances as jaded socialite Helen Wright, whose love affair with an up-and-coming violin virtuoso sends her to the brink of madness.  Extra features include featurette ""The Music of Humoresque"", and the trailer.

MILDRED PIERCE - From James M. Cain's novel comes the legendary potboiler about a devoted mother (Crawford) and her ungrateful, hellion of a  daughter (Ann Blyth).  Extra features include the movie-length TCM documentary ""The Ultimate Movie Star"", and a trailer gallery.

THE WOMEN - In director George Cukor's screen version of the Claire Booth Luce comedy, Joan Crawford plays a hard-boiled mantrap who moves in on Norma Shearer's husband.  Fabulous comic turns from Rosalind Russell, Mary Boland, and Paulette Goddard.  Extra features include alternate B&W fashion show sequence, and trailers.

The director used the pounding piano and searing violin to propel the film but employed Oscar Levant as the comic foil so the film doesn't collapse under its own weight.

I'd love to see Johnny Guitar, Flamingo Road, Torch Song and A Woman's Face in a set. And another with Female on the Beach, Autumn Leaves, Susuan and God and When Ladies Meet.

This set has The Women, which is the campiest and most quoted film. The ""clever"" plot involves a story devoid of men, but it is ALL the women talk about. Norma Sheaer, who deserves her OWN box set, is WONDEFUL in this film. Joan has a supporting role and she chews every inch of scenery she is in! Humoresque is my least favorite role. Joan falls for John Garfield and throws her life away for him. So NOT our Joanie! Possessed is OK. The role was written for Bette Davis and it is interesting to see Joan do the role while imaginging how Bette would OVERPLAY it while Joan does it more subtley. Now, The Damned Don't Cry is PURE CRAWFORD!! Woman claws her way to the top and uses every trick in the book to stay there.

2258422,4,B0008ENID4,"That is right, if you are in for camp, general bitchery, and overplayed melodrama, the Joan Crawford Collection is a must have!

This collection put together five of Mommie Dearest's most unforgettable performances; capturing La Joan in all of her steely determination and yet the woman still can project soft vulnerability.

The best of the lot is ""Mildred Pierce"" in which Joan gave an Oscar-winning performance as the title character who would do anything for her spoiled rotten self-center daughter even if it meant murder.

Then it is followed by ""The Damned Don't Cry"" in which Joan plays a woman who would do anything to leave her humble beginnings for the big life, even if it meant being the mistress to a crime boss.

The third best movie is ""Possessed"", in which Joan plays a slightly screwy private nurse who would do anything for the love of a man who doesn't return her affections, even if it meant marrying another man she doesn't love so she can be near him.

Coming in fourth is ""Humoresque"", in which Joan plays a socialite who would do anything for the love of a violin player whom she had taken under her wing even if it meant her reputation. This movie is different from the rest (and a little disappointing) in which Joan didn't have to fight, claw, or sleep her way to the top.

Finally, ""The Women"", a catty bitchfest in which Joan plays a perfume counter girl who would do anything to climb the social and financial ladder of high society even if it meant breaking up a man's family (with all due respect, she really should have considering the man had an obnoxious oh golly gee wiz daugher).

However, the last film ""The Women"" seems out of place in the collection because Crawford is barely in it; it belongs more in  a Norma Shearer collection.  I would much rather prefer ""Flamingo Road"" or ""Johnny Guitar"", both of which featured Crawford in her fabulous neurotic glory.",1142121600,7,1900,4.664670658682635
2258423,5,B0008ENID4,"This collection is not only some of Joan Crawford's best work, these are some of the best women's films from the period where women were really appreciated in film.  It was not just the strong stars, it was the stories and casting.  Yes, the style was style heavy-handed by today's standards, but Joan Crawford took acting risks all the way.  These movies were so revolutionary they seem trite today, but any film buff recognizes techniques that are still underused, and appreciate them.

  But you don't have to be a technician to appreciate these fims.

THE WOMEN was a classic stage script lifted almost verbatim on to the screen, and it works in every respect.  It is the comedy of this set. The flawless casting - Joan as the gorgeous and man-eating shop girl who can take in on the chin - was still an early exercise in trying ""star-studded"" casting.  It is a tongue-in-cheek take on a woman's world... and the stereotypes of a woman's world.  The ebb and flow between these two is what is timelessly witty.  When Mary (Norma Shearer)'s mother compares a woman alone in bed to a swastica, it tells us exactly where we are politically and socially.  This was/is a star turn by Joan, and her brass and humor are in full swing.

MILDRED PIERCE is Joan's classic rags-to-riches gone noir-ish.  Susie Homemaker becomes Betty Crocker.  It has the timeless story line, and Ann Blythe (ironically later a spokeswoman for Hostess cupcakes in her later life) as the daughter you really want to smack silly.  It also has some really early addressing of the issues of working women and divorce that were so timely in the post-war years.  The business friendship portrayed with Eve Arden, and the ambivalent attraction to Jack Carson give this script some really interesting levels.

My favorite of the set has become THE DAMNED DON'T CRY.  It has some basic similarities to Mildred Pierce, rags to riches, but that's about it.  Very dark, somewhat referential to the real life Bugsy Seigel story, it is a woman's gang-land tale.  It may also have been influenced by Hitchcock, or vice  versa, in the obsessive re-creation of a woman, not once, but twice.  Once by herself, once in the hands of someone awful.  The blonde mobster was very unusual casting for his day, and he does a superb job.  He is somehow attractive while being repulsive.

HUMORESQUE is a lovely film about music in which Joan Crawford does what her character in the film does not want to do... she plays ""second fiddle"" to a fiddle.  The  musical score is breathtaking, and you will want to watch the commentary and additional information on the making of the film, and the primacy of music.  Joan was the only really traditional casting choice, others being cast against type (and the always atrocious acting of brilliant pianist Oscar Levant).  Older woman, younger man, and a very interesting study of a depressive personality.  I think role this would have been intellectually challenging for a woman known to be so self directed, deft, and sure of herself.

Which leads neatly into POSSESSED.  Like Olivia DeHaviland's THE SNAKE PIT, this is a study of mental illness, but not nearly so clinical.  The cinematography strongly influenced by German impressionist filmmakers, and all aspects used to delineate psychological state of mind, we see why she was willing to break all the diva rules, appear with no makeup, and completely break down the image she had.  Of course, with what we know about her personal life, she had her own demons, and that could have added to her interest in this kind of role.  This film is art.

In spite of the glamour, the beauty, she was not only an actress, she was an artist, and this box set shows that off.  It is worth noting that ALL of her roles contained a tremendous amount of vulnerability.  We forget that, because in most of her films she triumphs... but we only care because we could identify with that softness that she allowed us into early on.  I got this set with the Bette Davis set of Warner Bros. films from the same era.  If these are any indication, the Bros. were much better to Joan.  The really interesting comparison is in the commentaries.  Many directors and technicians worked with both of these greats, and there are wonderful comparison/contrasting stories of them as professionals and women.  There are also shared musical scoring between some films, and even one director has the same dialogue and direction copied between these stars in different films.

This is a great set worthy of a great star.... oh, and a Joan recommendation.  RAIN. One of her early films, a great Somerset Maugham script.  It set the archetype for her as an actress.",1138147200,26,4675,4.764632627646327

This is a balanced and fair analysis of Joan Crawford the person, the actress, the mother, and ultimately, the image.  It is indisputable that Ms. Crawford's daughter's tell-all book, ""Mommie Dearest"" has irretrievably damaged Joan Crawford's reputation, possibly deservedly so.  Child abusers are not generally to be looked up to or admired in any way.  And yet, despite her obvious and significant parenting deficits, she played a major role in the evolution of Hollywood movies, and her movies remain by and large, highly entertaining.  This boxed set provides high quality entertainment created by a woman who truly personified the ""movie star"", and who should at the very least be remembered for her drive and talent.  She had a most enviable career, in possibly the most competitive field imaginable.

2258428,5,B0008ENID4,"This box-set really is the Must-Have of the Joan Season!! So two of them are already on DVD - so what? Give your old copies to friends!! The others - Humoresque, The Damned Don't Cry, and ESPECIALLY Possessed - are absolute gems, and in very different ways, showcase Joan Crawford's often-underestimated abilities as a bona fide actress.

The Damned Don't Cry is the 'fun' movie of the previously-unreleased trio - campy, OTT and extremely funny, in places. It's also a rather well-made film noir, if you can overlook the preposterousness of the premise. Some lovely vintage Vincent Sherman direction compliments the pseudo Jimmy Cagney setting beautifully, and Joan (in an array of ever-more-exquisite gowns, hats and shoes) chews up all scenery and extras in a glorious Star Vehicle.

Humoresque is a wonderful picture, and one, surprisingly, that doesn't feature La Crawford in 98.7 of all the shots. Nicely understated, it's an ultimately chilling tale of the difference between love and devotion, and, while it may be a vintage Crawford performance full of those vintage Crawfordisms that you either love or hate, it's still well-worth owning.

The real gem here is 'Possessed'. Far, far superior in terms of performance and direction to 'Mildred Pierce' (even if that particular picture is more vicariously enjoyable - no Veda here to get a comeuppance!!), this is, in my opinion, Crawford's fnest hour in motion pictures. The strength of restraint in her portrayal of Louise The Mad Nurse is admirable, and makes for a wonderfully subtle, nuanced rendition of a woman (literally) on the verge of a nervous breakdown.

The DVD quality, as with the sister box-set of Ms. Bette Davis, is absolutely remarkable. These remastered movies are sharp, smooth and absolutely gorgeous to look at. Dark black areas are truly black, contrast balance is never an issue, and the crystal-clear sharpness of the images remains intact, overall. Sound is mono, but a decent sort of mono, and with decent TV speakers it's not such a big deal.

Each DVD has its own mini-extras, all come with some interesting comments from Historians, Biographers and Directors, and this makes for a great accompaniment of factoids to already-worthwhile movies. Particularly interesting are Vincent Sherman's comments on 'The Damned...'. As one of Joan's former boyfriends, it's a touching tribute to see the warmth and professional respect with which she is remembered.

A wonderful collection of some of the best (and most outrageous!! - The Women!) of Joan Crawford's movies, you should really only pass this set up if you're not a fan of beautifully-shot, finely-crafted, absorbing movies. Wholeheartedly recommended.",1122249600,13,2691,5.232018561484919

Bravo to WB for finally getting rid of those lousy cardboard snap cases and using the industry standard plastic keep cases! Beautifully packaged, each film is clear, crisp and looking as good if not better than their original theatrical presentation! An earlier reviewer commented on the flaws in ""Possessed"" I believe this is a problem of the source material the studio had available to them. Warner Bros. was always ahead of it's time in properly storing their film collection however, I'm sure some films were not preserved and suffered as a result. Considering the elements available this is an overall fine presentation of this title. The featurettes included on the new to DVD titles ""Humoresque"", ""Possessed"", and ""The Damned Don't Cry"" (Damned, actually never previously released on home video) are brief yet, still entertaining and informative. Considering WB didn't have to produce any new supplemental features for these titles, brief is better than nothing! The true bounty of this collection is the 90 minute documentary ""Joan Crawford: The Ultimate Movie Star"" (included with ""Mildred Pierce"") a comprehensive look into the life and career of Miss Crawford warts and all! Contains new interviews with former co-stars, filmmakers, historians, and even a rare appearance by Christina Crawford who up to now, has never participated in retrospectives of her mother's work. Another earlier reviewer rated this item low based on the horrible abuse Joan Crawford inflicted upon her children. While Crawford's mental state and parenting skills were questionable her acting ability was not. Truly, Joan Crawford is arguably the greatest movie star in the history of motion pictures! Before the Publication of the book ""Mommie Dearest"" the issue of child abuse, either emotional or physical was never discussed in public. Christina truly blazed a trail and even stated that her intention was to tell her own story that happened to include an iconic movie star. Perhaps if the self help resources exsisted a generation ago that exsists today, Joan Crawford could have sought out a mental health professional she so desprately needed and the lives of her adopted children could have been different. Sadly, such help did not exsist then. It's only fair to judge Crawford the person and Crawford the star differently. This DVD collection is a shining example of the fierce talent of Miss Joan Crawford! Here's hoping for future collections with the rest of the WB Joan Crawford titles as well as the complete works from MGM! I'd also like to see WB re-issue ""Whatever Happen To Baby Jane"" with new packaging and some interesting special features such as outtakes, wardrobe tests, any behind the scenes footage that may still exist.

Dont get me wrong- The Women is a great flick!

As for the DVDs- The Women and Mildred Pierce are the same- the boxes are different- gone are those horrible cardboard snap cases.  They are now housed in the plastic sturdy cases.

Humoresque looks great on DVD!!! Fans of this movie will be very very pleased...It looks really great.  Possessed on the other hand ... I was not overly happy with.  Yes its on DVD!! Yes it looks good!! But the source material they used was not that great.  This film looks grainy at times and then it is SUPER SHARP! The scene with Joan and Van in her home.. for the die- hard fans of this movie.. will note that those horrible annoying water spots that ran through parts of the scene ARE STILL IN THIS DVD!!!- and its a key meeting between the two stars- and it is very distracting when it looks like it is snowing in her house!  Overall I am just happy this is on DVD- preserved forever and looking better then the prior VHS and Laserdisc.  It is still a nice transfer- that could to me, look as phenomenal as the Mildred Pierce DVD- since it was made 2 years later- but it doesnt.  The Damned Dont Cry on the other hand looks amazing to me- the transfer is solid, great great great- I always liked this movie (it is very Joan and very campy)- and I am SOOOO glad this is finally on DVD- (it was never even released on VHS).  I didn't rate the extra features since they are all little 10min or so reviews of the films- but they are an added plus.  Since WB has the rights to all the prior MGM library- and there are only 3 other Joan Crawford WB titles- Goodbye My Fancy and This Woman is Dangerous and of course FLAMINGO ROAD- I am hoping a follow up set is in the works!!

I guess we wait. And wait for Harriet Craig (Columbia) and Daisy Kenyon (20th Century Fox) as well.",1112400000,57,662,4.571428571428571
8055849,5,B0008ENID4,"How wonderful to be able to own 5 of the best Joan Crawford movies in one set. Oscar winner for Mildred Pierce. The hauntingly beautiful Humoresque. Possessed, for which a second Oscar should have been won by Joan. I definitely recommend this box set for any fan of Joan Crawford.",1518220800,,280,4.62

8055853,4,B0008ENID4,"Some of Ms Crawfords best movies, not all by any means, but still a nice selection.  The issue I have with this set is that the content of the dvd's are on both sides.  I really do not care for this, as I tend to have trouble handling them.  Other than that, it is a good set.",1503792000,2,276,3.807017543859649
8055854,5,B0008ENID4,"These DVDs arrived in a reasonable amount of time, as expected!  I was very impressed that the Seller took the time to write me a personal  ""handwritten"" note thanking me for my purchase, hoping I enjoy the DVDs, and expressing appreciation of my feedback in a beautiful 'blank card' (with the likeness of the oil painting on canvas called, ""Titian"" by Tiziano Vecellio).  I was taken aback by the thoughtfulness and time it took for the Seller to attempt to ""connect with their customers""...ESPECIALLY  especially in this day in age where people only talk to two or at you on their cell phones and social media!  I'm 62 yrs old and can remember actually writing letters and notes to friends and loved ones (even to strangers - I can recall writing letters to my freshman college roommate during the summer of '72 BEFORE our FIRST college experience ever began!  This type of behavior would today be considered VERY ODD...but a ""personal touch"" such as this is in a class by itself and is of a Dying Breed!  Rah!  Rah!  Way to go Gene's  Franklin Library Books!.  Not only do you have class and style...But to me, you've also shown humility where as many others in our world today behave as if someone owes them something!!!. Most times, people behave as though YOU OWE THEM...FOR NOTHING!!!  KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!  Not only do I seriously plan to place orders with Gene's Books  again, and again, and AGAIN, I am also planning  to tell others about you, as well!",1502496000,,1464,4.62015503875969
8055855,5,B0008ENID4,This has got to be the best selection of Joan Crawford movies I have seen in one collection! My favorite is Mildred Pierce but the others are just as good.,1501200000,,155,4.2

8055858,5,B0008ENID4,Love Joan Crawford but was mislead.  The movies were NOT colorized like it was advertised to be and which I thought I purchased so I was very disappointed with that.  The DVD cover was in color but the movies were NOT.  Need to make that clarification.  Felt dupped!,1496620800,,266,4.479166666666667
