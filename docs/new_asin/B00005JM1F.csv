1494720,5,B00005JM1F,"This movie is hilarious!  Not a minute went by during this movie that I did not laugh at least once, and I was still laughing when I left the theater.  The cast is perfect.  They managed to get all my favorite men into one movie.  Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Will Ferrell fit their roles well.  Luke Wilson plays the straight-arrow as usual.  Vince Vaughn plays an unhappy-but-dedicated family man.  Will Ferrell plays the newlywed who tries to commit to his wife, but let's his partying get the better of him.  There's even a small role for Craig Kilborn of CBS' The Late Late Show.  (He plays the philandering boyfriend of the woman with whom Luke Wilson's character is in love.)  A word of advice: Don't go to this movie expecting a realistic plot or a sappy Cinderella love story.  Go to this movie expecting to laugh.",1045699200,,825,4.54421768707483
1494721,4,B00005JM1F,I saw the movie at a special screening and it was really funny. Luke Wilson was really funny and Will Farrel was great too. There were a couple of really funny scenes and you will laugh a lot because the script is pretty good. The only thing I didn't like was that everyone was a loser in love and that made the movie a little less funny. The daughter from 24 and Leah Remini from the King Of Queens are in it too.,1045699200,,414,4.0
1494722,3,B00005JM1F,"It seems that every few years we see the release of a fraternity farce with plenty of ridiculous moments, lame jokes and inevitable scenes of nudity. We've seen Animal House and Porky's and Old School continues the tradition. There is a slight variance to the theme here because the group of kooky guys running things aren't actually college students but older men who relive their youth.
The fun's kicked off when Mitch (Luke Wilson) comes home to find his wife (Juliette Lewis) in a rather unique compromising position. He leaves and restarts life in a house near the local college. Pretty soon he has regular guests in friends Beanie (Vince Vaughn) and Frank ""the Tank"" (Will Ferrell). The obvious way to celebrate Mitch's freedom and their proximity to the college is to establish a fraternity. And so the clichd hilarity begins.
It's really a modern day Animal House, right down to it's own ex-SNL actor in Will Ferrell who, incidentally is the stand-out performer and who you get to see a real lot of...
You know what to expect when going in to see Old School and, if you've seen the earlier iterations mentioned above (and you were rolling on the floor helplessly, then) then you will probably love this one too. Endless one-liners, some great physical humour and a cameo or two is what you'll be in for.",1045699200,,1311,4.729257641921397

1494986,5,B00005JM1F,"This film Old School (unrated version) stars Luke Wilson as an ambitious and down to earth lawyer named Mitch Martin, Will Ferrell as Frank Ricard a well-meaning yet wild person who is still in the process of finding his place in life, and Vince Vaughan as Bernard Campbell the blunt yet well-meaning man who deep down has a heart of gold and is actually one of the leaders and planners of what goes on in the film. Some of the females that feature in Old School are Ellen Pompeo, Juliette Lewis, Leah Remini, and more. There are also celebrity appearances such as from Snoop Dogg, James Carville, and a celebrity with the name of Andy D. who teaches some certain kinds of lessons to some of the female characters of the film and there is even a scene that plays Hungry Like the Wolf by Duran Duran. Jeremy Priven plays the role of a college dean named Gordon Pritchard who unintentionally helps Mitch Martin, Frank Ricard, and Bernard Campbell to band together to legally come up with a type of college campus house that welcomes both students and adults outside of college after he forces them up against the wall.",1506816000,,1116,4.585

1496307,4,B00005JM1F,"This one holds up pretty well, really cementing Will Ferrell as a big, awkward, lovable golden retriever who combines a heart of gold (or, at least, bronze) with highly questionable judgment. The spirit is willing but the overly exposed flesh is weak. Great chemistry among the three leads, as well as a lot of inspired supporting parts. There is little socially redeeming about the film, but it's full of hilarious one-liners and set pieces, and it actually speaks somewhat deeply to the real developmental conflict that aging, middle-class guys can feel as they are increasingly forced to choose between the rewards and stabilizing qualities of family life and responsible adulthood on the one hand and the persistent low rumblings of decadent, Freudian, adolescent energy on the other.",1437264000,,788,5.21259842519685

1497522,5,B00005JM1F,"I admit I was initially skeptical about this film.  I didn't know much about Luke Wilson and Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn, while funny, have never turned out a comedy so hilarious I couldn't describe my feelings.  Well, while this film didn't do that either, it did surprise me.  It was a solid, quite funny story.  For all three men, it's to be listed among their finest works (I've seen Luke Wilson in other movies and TV shows since first seeing this movie.)  The premise of three guys long out of college starting a fraternity may be a stretch, but this cast makes it work and work well.  Even the really old guy who's pledging fits in and Patrick Cranshaw doesn't waste an ounce of talent on frivolous humor.  I did find the subplot with Wilson's love interest a bit distracting at times, but Ellen Pompeo did well and her story ark did actually tie into the main plot at times, so I'll let that go...the scene with the supportive waiter was pretty funny.  In the end, this is a very good, funny movie and, though Will Ferrell was my favorite, all the cast contributed to the plot and its hilarity.  Go ahead and pledge for this movie...that sounded better in my head.  Enjoy.",1404259200,5,1182,4.481308411214953

1497710,4,B00005JM1F,"When you unite three hilarious leading actors, a fraternity, and Snoop Dogg, you have a guaranteed winning combination. When you put these elements together on the big screen, the result you get is the 2003 comedy film Old School.

 Director Todd Phillips, who also directed the Hangover trilogy and produced Project X, seems to have a specialty in creating carefree, feel-good movies. While this film may not be the funniest and in no way would ever be in the running for an Academy Award, I would definitely recommend this movie for people who are just looking for a good laugh.

 The film revolves around three grown men named Frank, Bernard, and Mitch (played by funnymen Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn, & Luke Wilson respectively) who have a feeling of nostalgia for their college years as they start their own fraternity. A subplot of the film is how the guys deal with managing their lives in and out of Greek life. Over the course of the film, Dean of Students Gordon Pritchard (played by Golden Globe winner Jeremy Piven) tries to shut down the fraternity in its entirety with the help of one of the students at the university. In response, the three guys and their untraditional members of the fraternity have to complete a series of different tasks to keep their frat active.

 One of the key elements that really makes this film thrive is the chemistry between Ferrell, Vaughn, and Wilson. With the extreme level of comfort between the three on-screen, one can assume that they are good friends in real life. Their line delivery comes off well because they are able to flow off of each others wit. These three actors have been featured together in quite a few movies (Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Starsky and Hutch, Blades of Glory). They are a part of a group of Hollywood comedy actors that star in movies together dubbed the Frat Pack. Will Ferrell is without a doubt the highlight of this film. The scenes in the movie where he goes streaking across the town and shoots a tranquilizer dart into his neck confirms why he has been considered one of the best comedic actors of the last decade. Ferrell picks up the movie when it starts to become boring or seems like it is being dragged out. He has a natural ability to make even the slightest little things humorous with his strong physicality and tone of voice.

 Overall, this movie is fairly decent. There are moments in Old School where the scenes are very flat and there are other scenes where viewers will laugh hysterically. Some people may be a little grossed out by the amount of nudity in the film so Id say college-aged kids are the ideal audience. This film has just enough laugh out loud moments, one-liners (which youll probably be reciting to your buddies for days), and an impromptu concert by rap legend Snoop Dogg to please a majority of the viewing audience.",1392595200,,2847,4.68
1497711,2,B00005JM1F,"If I had seen this back in 2003 instead of now, it might have left a better impression.  In retrospect, all of these terrific actors are capable of much bigger laughs when they are given better material.  It's obvious when a scene of wrestling in vaseline is followed by a 400 pound guy jumping over a sawhorse, the script writers have exhausted all of their funny ideas and simply start throwing bologna slices of jokes at the wall to see if any stick.  Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn would reject something this boring today or at least send it to a script doctor to make it funnier.",1392163200,,584,4.4392523364485985

1497943,4,B00005JM1F,"I saw ""Old School"" when it first came out in the movie theaters. In the intervening years my opinion of it has remained pretty much the same. One of several movies that have been engendered by the truly classic ""Animal House,"" ""Old School"" is about on par with ""Road Trip"" when it comes to plausibility, humor, and grossness.

Like ""Animal House,"" ""Old School"" involves men living together in a fraternity. Unlike ""Animal House,"" the fellows in the fraternity aren't in their late teens and early twenties, but are mostly married men, several years beyond college age, whose marriages are on the rocks, and who have decided to move into a house near a college campus and form a fraternity of sorts (one where enrollment in the college is not necessary).

There is little in this movie that is the least bit profound, and the storyline is rather thin. However, there are a number of really funny scenes, and Vince Vaughn and Will Ferrell in particular do their usual outstanding job of making their characters come alive. Although there are a few scenes that amply warrant the ""R"" rating the movie received, for the most part the movie consists of funny, though sometimes sophomoric hijinks. It's a decent enough movie for a few good laughs when vegging on a Friday evening.",1381881600,,1273,4.781818181818182

1497946,5,B00005JM1F,"This movie has been out long enough now (a little over ten years) where I feel comfortable calling it a classic of modern comedy. What really makes this movie sing is the perfect chemistry that is achieved among the actors. Ferrell, Vaughn, and Wilson are the stars, of course, but everybody in this movie is perfectly cast, contributing in all the right ways, and never detracting from the sum. This is a true TEAM effort- just like the team effort that is required for Old School's unconventional fraternity to succeed! This is ""low brow"" comedy, of course, oftentimes bordering on slapstick, so it is intended for those who laugh freely at such juvenile antics. For me, there's something timeless and hilarious about watching these characters stumble about so ineptly, particularly Ferrell's, who is the height of absurdity.

1498423,4,B00005JM1F,"The thing about movies like this is that they could very easily be forgettable and almost unforgivable in their ridiculousness.  I mean, how many movies about reckless middle aged men acting like twelve year olds can you stomach before you swear off the genre altogether?  Still, there is something almost endearing about Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn that make their shtick worth watching and completely enjoyable.  Sure, even they have had missteps and they can and do get old after a while, but overall their names draw me to them and their films and so that brings me to `Old School', one of their more successful ventures.

The film is really dumb, when you look at it from a plot perspective.  I mean, you have Mitch, a straight laced man with a philandering wife who is best friends with two very immature men who are experiencing issues with their wives as well.  After catching his wife in the act (with two blind folded individuals), Mitch leaves home and rents a house near the campus of a nearby collage.  His two buddies are thrilled, for to them this means parties and college girls and drunken mistakes.  Mitch isn't really into all of that (why are they friends again?) but he's pulled into the debauchery and soon finds himself starting his own fraternity in an attempt to save his home (since the school wants to claim it for academic purposes).  His fraternity obviously seeks out the `losers' and becomes a joke until the very end when they prove themselves in ridiculous fashion and all is right in the world (including a happy ending for Mitch).

Like I said, it's really dumb and yet it all works together thanks to some really funny jokes and the charisma that Ferrell and Vaughn bring to their scenes.  Ferrell is especially hilarious here, really nailing his take on, well, Will Ferrell (he does play himself or a variation of himself almost always).  The stupidity is balanced out by the humor, which is surprisingly well placed.  Even Wilson, who is a bore most of the time, comes out unscathed thanks to his charming persona and the chemistry he has with his co-stars.  Pompeo (the `other' Renee Zellweger) is beautiful as ever and adds a clichd touch to the film (love interest with scuzzy boyfriend).

It's not for everyone, and it's not for every mood, but if you like mindless humor with real bite, this one will work.",1354579200,,2351,4.7

1498760,3,B00005JM1F,"THE MOVIE

""We're going streaking!"" Will Ferrell's frantic yelling, Luke Wilson's quiet acceptance of his life, and Vince Vaughn's adamant holding-on to being a partying bachelor made Old School a comedy classic when it came out just a few short years a go. In the vein of Animal House and Revenge of the Nerds, the story focused on an unlikely group of guys on a college campus: grown up men who aren't even going to the school.

The story begins when Mitch (Wilson) loses his cheating girlfriend. His friends, Frank (Ferrell) and Beanie (Vaughn) hatch a plan to get career-oriented Mitch back into the social world; they rent him a house on-campus, and turn it into the most high-profile fraternity (complete with Snoop Dogg concert) around.

Compared to every other college-oriented comedy since the 80s, Old School was a breath of fresh air. The film finally seemed to realize that there's more to humor than gross-out jokes and physical humor, combining drama, likable characters, and memorable scenes all with the type of humor people have come to expect from a movie starring Will Ferrell. Putting the emphasis on a man in his 30s who's not even in college also is a fresh move, as it allows for exploring more than just getting good grades, or fitting in with peers. Thanks to Mitch's age and current status, Old School is not only a movie about the college frat life, but also about mid-life in general. What would a real 30-year-old man do if he found himself in Mitch's shoes, homeless with a new frat house, girl-less with dozens of sorority sisters throwing themselves at him, and friends trying their hardest to live like they were still young and not married? Most likely, they'd do exactly what Mitch does.

Old School may not be as funny as other films by its stars, but it's still a fantastic movie full of humor, memorable moments, quotable lines, and lovable characters. The trio of Vaughn, Ferrell, and Wilson offer some of their best performances here, and it's a treat to watch again and again.

Score: 4/5

THE DISC

Old School is one of those movies filmed for high-def transfer before it became a standard, so while the transfer is high-def, it's not quite at a level as other films since then. The 1080p/AVC MPEG-4 encode looks, to my eye, almost identical to the HD DVD release Old School originally saw. Compared to the DVD, there's a better clarity to textures and more noticeable details, but nothing that will blow you away going, ""Wow, this is the power of Blu-ray!""

For a comedy movie like Old School that has no huge catalog of action scenes or graphically impressive feats, the transfer is a solid one. It's much better looking than the DVD, but once again, nothing you'd want to show off your home theater set-up with.

Unlike the video, the audio in the Blu-ray release is an improvement over the HD DVD version as it offers TrueHD 5.1 surround. Unfortunately, the surround is very rarely noticed given it's a dialog-heavy movie that is, once again, light on the effects. Only during a few scenes (the first party; the competition at the end; the classic fight between Mitch, Frank and the Dean) is the surround actually noticeable without looking for it.

One area where the disc suffers is in the features department. With all of the DVD releases of Old School over the years, it looks like DreamWorks just didn't have anything new to bring to the plate. (And, to make matters worse, all features are in standard definition.) If you've already cleared the features on your DVD release(s) of the film, you'll find nothing new to take your time here. What is here is still entertaining, but it looks like they're officially dried up.

For those who don't own one of the DVD releases, Old School on Blu-ray contains an audio commentary featuring Vaughn, Ferrell, and Wilson (along with director Todd Phillips). The commentary isn't something for film students, as most of the stars' time is spent riffing on one another than discussing the film, but if you're a fan of MST3K or any of the three actors involved, chances are you'll like it.

The other features are a little more entertaining for all audiences. First, there's the obvious deleted and extended scenes collection. With 8 scenes and 13 minutes of runtime, there are a few gems hidden on here. To go along with those, there's a 5 minute outtakes and blooper real. Oddly enough, compared to many it's rather lackluster. Perhaps the best (actually, it IS the best) feature on the disc is the Inside the Actor's Studio spoof with Will Ferrell reprising his SNL role of James Lipton. In it, ""Lipton"" interviews Vaughn, Ferrell, and Wilson about Old School. If you've ever seen Will's SNL skits with the overanalytic windbag that is Lipton, you'll love this.

Score: 2.5/5

VERDICT

In the end, whether or not you buy Old School on Blu-ray depends on several questions. Do you already own the movie on DVD? If you do, is it worth the price to upgrade to Blu-ray for HD picture? And if you don't, is HD picture and audio important enough to you that you'll spend $20 instead of picking up a used/new copy of the DVD for under $10? If you don't mind spending the extra cash, Old School is a great movie and the Blu-ray transfer is a very serviceable one. For most people, though, a film of this type with no new Blu-ray extras to speak of will likely be good enough on DVD with upscaled presentation.

Overall Score: 3/5",1249689600,4,5412,4.699049630411827
1498761,4,B00005JM1F,"In the vein of the Revenge of the Nerds, but with the mid-lufe crisis twist, Old School is a good watch.  I have the DVD with the additional ""Bonus Features"", and would strongly recommend that you watch the deleted scenes as well.  They really add to the movie, and it was unfortunate they were removed in many cases/

The movie itself is good for a few laughs, and Will Ferrell is his typical self, and generally carries the movie with a combination of slapstick and satire.  Luke Wilson does an admirable job of playing the straight guy, and his ascerbic wit comes through in this movie.  It may be my favorite Luke Wilson flick - though the list isn't that long.

It's not a classic like Animal House, but is good for quite a few laughs, especially if you are, like me, a middle aged married guy who every once in awhile looks at your college years as the ""best years of my life"".  It may help you question that, as well as hit home on occasion.",1246579200,,948,4.322033898305085

Once again a movie with one of my favorite people, Will Ferrell. He has a way of stealing every scene that he is in, and this movie is no different. Together with mr ""i talk all the time"" Vince Vaughn and ""i look insecure no matter what"" Luke Wilson they are a very good comedic gang. I watched the unrated edition on dvd and of course they have tried to put as many pairs of breasts they can get away with :) But this is a simple and funny movie. Will Ferrel goes streaking through the city, Sean William Scott does a small role as an abusive animal trainer and Snoop does a cameo. All in all i think people will enjoy this movie.

1498766,5,B00005JM1F,"This looked like the last movie I would ever get, not being particularly into farces and screwball comedy. But
if Vince Vaughn (""Swingers"", ""Made"") is in it, then I probably will give it a look. ""Old School"" fulfilled Vaughn's comic promise, but it is ensemble and great.
It starts out with just the right touch when Luke Wilson returns home and finds sexy girlfriend Juliette Lewis expecting not him but her ""Internet friends,"" who are coming over ""for the gangbang."" Makes you want to do a Google search for ""single girls looking for group sex.""
This is an up-dated ""Animal House"", maybe better. Luke's post-Juliette recovery includes moving into a house next to the college, and when it looks like he cannot stay due to school regulations, they form a fraternity. Luke is a lawyer and his legal skills keep them above the dean's attempts to disband them as part of a childhood revenge.
Vince gives us great lines like, ""What do you think, instead of spending time with my wife I'd rather hang out with 19-year old girls?""
USC grad Will Ferrell, who once tried out for the Trojans as a punter, may carry this film through sheer craziness. There is little message, just laughs. It has some mature themes, but despite Juliette's sexual wanderings is basically tame.
In the end, Juliette is still into swinging, when she invites Will to her next sexfest.",1233964800,,1353,4.761702127659574

This is the movie that helped launch the careers of such celebrated comedians like Will Ferrell, Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn! And man do they earn their honors with this movie!

There are so much LOL moments in this that you'll barely have time to catch a breath. This is a worthy DVD buy because this movie has LOTS of rewatchability (is that even a real word????). You and your friends will get lots of mileage out of this one. And the nudity doesn't hurt either!

1498854,5,B00005JM1F,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. First of all, it's very well thought out in regards to the relationships between the characters (Mitch and Nicole, Mitch and Darcie, Bernard and Lara). The most overlooked, but important detail is the connection between Mitch (Luke Wilson), Bernard (Vince Vaughn) and Frank (Will Ferrell) and Dean Pritchard (Jeremy Piven). If the four hadn't had a history going back to their school days, Dean Pritchard's relentless fight to end the fraternity would've been lost in the mix.

Basically, the story revolves around three men who appear to be lost in their post-college years and decide to form a fraternity in the midst of Mitch's failed marriage and Frank's inability to grow into married life. Living in a campus house and overcoming glitches within the system, the fraternity becomes the most popular group on campus to hang out with despite their unusual and questionable personalities. As the film unravels, the fraternity is forced to face real life challenges that test their friendship, loyalty, teamwork, and heart.
The chemistry between Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson is fantastic and demonstrates the true bonds of friendship. The casting in this movie was brilliant and made it that much more hilarious. It includes some of the best one-liners you'll hear come out of Hollywood. It ranks alongside, if not above the American Pie trilogy and is a modern day 'Animal House', an absolute must for any college student.
The only problem I have with this movie is its length.  Some of the deleted scenes were not only hilarious, but essential to the plot and should've been used in the final cut. However, that's a minor detail in the final outcome.

In addition, if you're a fan of Whitesnake or Kansas, this movie is a living homage to your music.

All the immature fools that hit 30 and pine for those carefree college days, even Old Blue, the 80 year-old pledge, oh, to go back to those nubile young drunken girls and the total lack of any reality based responsibility or meaningful relationship, those were the days my friend.  We thought they'd never end, etc.

Look, the jokes are college prat, but there's some laugh-out-loud.

1498986,3,B00005JM1F,"OLD SCHOOL is a comedy that stars Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Will Ferrell. Wilson portrays Mitch Martin, a real estate lawyer who arrives home early from a business training seminar to find his wife about to participate in an orgy. This break off their relationship and Mitch finds himself alone again and moving into a house on the campus of the local university. Meanwhile Frank Richard (Will Ferrell), one of Mitch's best friends, is getting married. The other part of the trio, Bernard ""Beanie"" Campbell (Vince Vaughn) tries convincing Frank not to get married right up until Frank's bride arrives at the altar. Beanie has a successful business and is married to a very attractive women and has a couple of kids, but he's feeling trapped. The Dean of the University, Dean Gordon Pritchard (Jeremy Piven) threatens to seize Mitch's house, but Beanie discovers a loophole in the seizure clause and Beanie, Frank, and Mitch turn the house into a new fraternity that is open to men of all ages in the community, including those who have no association with the university whatsoever. A battle between the new fraternity and the dean ensues, while in the meantime the three founding fathers of the fraternity face relationship struggles of their own with the women they love.

OLD SCHOOL includes allusions to many movies, but seems to have been most heavily influenced by ANIMAL HOUSE and FIGHT CLUB and seems to be a homage to both of those films. The ANIMAL HOUSE allusions are obvious, e.g. popular fraternity that the dean tries to close down. The FIGHT CLUB references aren't quite as obvious, but they are there and there are many. For example, the wrestling matches take place in the basement, club propaganda is photocopied at work, the men appear disheveled at work, in many of the fraternity scenes Vince Vaughn dresses in outfits similar to those of Tyler Durden, etc. In fact director Todd Phillips has said that he thought of OLD SCHOOL as being a comedy version of FIGHT CLUB.

With such a talented cast and a witty script full of film references, one would think that OLD SCHOOL would be a memorable and hilarious movie. Unfortunately, it's not. There were some parts of OLD SCHOOL that I found incredibly funny. For instance, watching Will Ferrell streak through a party and run naked down a public street was hilarious. In fact, Ferrell is the funniest thing about the movie. Just about every time he is on screen I found myself laughing at the antics of his character. I also enjoyed Luke Wilson's performance. Wilson portrays Mitch as a very likeable, down-to-earth, and realistic person. However, Ferrell and Wilson are about the only two characters who work well in the movie. Vince Vaughn can speak almost as fast as an auctioneer, but his character just doesn't fit with the rest of the characters in the film. Jeremy Piven is a very talented actor, but in OLD SCHOOL I don't believe that his character used to be the guy that Mitch, Beanie, and Frank used to beat up and neither do I believe that was able to rise through the ranks of academia to become the university dean. Most of the women in the movie are only background characters that are used as fodder for comic material. There are a variety of scenes in the movie that seem funny at first, but are juvenile at best and then quickly become boring and dull. There are many sexual references in the movie that have very little to do with the plot and seem basically to have been thrown in simply to have thirteen-year-old males buy movie tickets or the DVD. The movie had a lot of potential, but it doesn't come together in a coherent manner.

However, with the movie on DVD, one can get a better understanding of what the movie could have been. Some of the extras on the DVD include the usual director's commentary, a spoof of ""Inside the Actor's Studio"", deleted and extended scenes, bloopers and outtakes, and a making of featurette. Most of the deleted and extended scenes that are included on the DVD probably should have been kept in the movie because they add a great deal to the characterization and plot development. For instance, there is a scene where a college girl wants to sleep with Beanie, but he refuses. The scene in the movie makes Beanie seem like a complete jerk while the extended scene allows the audience to relate to Beanie and actually see him as a human being. I really enjoyed watching most of these scenes and they allowed me to appreciate the movie a bit more. The other special feature that I really liked was the ""Inside the Actor's Studio spoof"". I found it hilarious; seeing Will Ferrell have a conversation with himself as two different characters is hilarious.

Overall, OLD SCHOOL is a movie that will probably appeal most to teenage males and some college students as well as fans of Ferrell, Wilson, or Vaughn. Other than that, I'd skip this comedy and watch ANIMAL HOUSE instead.",1172361600,,4904,4.718786464410735

I am also a huge Vince Vaughn fan, so when you get them together with a script allowing them to take over and expose their comedic genius then I am all for it.  Sure, Luke Wilson is the star but put him on the screen with either of the aformentioned and he fades into the backdrop.  The film revolves around three friends, each of which are having women troubles.  You have Frank (Ferrell) who has just got hitched but his marriage is already having trouble.  Then theres Mitch (Wilson) who just caught his girlfriend (Julitte Lewis) having some S&M fun with a few people in their house.  And finally we have Beanie (Vaughn) who is successful and married to a beautiful woman (Leah Remini) and has two children but is missing the fun he once had with booze and young women.  So, in an effort to bring themselves up from the slump they are in they decide to throw a large party at Mitch's new house near the local college campus.  The party is a success and they are the new kings of the town.  (The whole 'Frank the Tank' scene is the greatest scene in the film)  There's one problem, and his name is 'Dean' Gordon Pritchard (Jeremy Pivon in a hilarious role).  Gordon has history with the three party animals and is determined to have them evicted.  So, in an effort to save their home they start a fraturnity which turns into the base for one hilarious film.  Cameos from the likes of Snoop Dogg and Sean Williams Scott as well as the always funny Andy Dick give this film even more cred.  Throw in the spark of a new love for Mitch with the beautiful Nicole (Ellen Pompeo) and her jealous and perverted boyfriend Mark (Craig Kilborn) and throw in Elisha Cuthburt for good messure and you have a non-stop laugh fest that will never get old.",1151107200,,1773,4.382262996941896
1499105,5,B00005JM1F,"Okay, let me start off by saying, why I loved this movie so much.  I love this movie because I feel like I can relate to the characters so well.  I imagined them being in their late 30's (I'm in my early 40's now, but was in my late 30's when it came out) and I often times fantasize about doing college over again, and how much better it would be.

That in a nutshell, is what is so appealing to me about this movie.  It is ensued halarity that I could imagine doing myself, or at least in a ""movie fantasy"" sense.  And that draws you in to the story.  Other details which draw you in are:

1)Luke's character is at an offsite meeting

2)Luke's office workplace scenes

3)Vince's family problems

4)Will's marriage failure (that's the world's shortest marriage I've ever seen)

etc.

Throwing in Snoop Dog appearing live at one of their parties, and Will running down the street naked is just icing on the cake.

This movie should be seen by every college student, male and female, and every 30 something wanna be college graduate!

Two thumbs up!  MC White said check it out!",1151020800,3,1077,4.395939086294416
1499106,5,B00005JM1F,"Old School, One of the Most Hilarious Comedies You'll Ever Witness

If you have not seen the comedy ""Old School"" then you are missing a great laugh. With Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn, and Luke Wilson as the stars of the movie, you will not be disappointed with this two-hour long stretch of pure fun. This movie, while some parts are quite fictional, relates well to college students, especially those in a fraternity or sorority. Will Ferrell (Frank) and Vince Vaughn (Beanie) long to relive their college years at their friend's expense. Luke Wilson (Mitch) buys a house on a college campus, because he wants to get away from his broken relationship with his wife. Mitch comes home at the beginning of the movie to find her sleeping with another man. Frank and Beanie create the brilliant idea that they will start a college fraternity on this campus, but they run into a terrible problem because the dean remembers how ruthless these men were to him in college, and he is trying to get rid the campus of them. As three older men, who once lived the college life, try to start a fraternity, they meet many challenges with the college's administration. The challenges that these men endure are what make the movie so funny. In one scene of the movie, Frank loses his wife because of the time he spends at the fraternity house. ""Old School"" is a great movie based purely on the non-stop laughter you will have. Between the challenges of the commencement of the fraternity and the everyday lives of Frank, Mitch, and Beanie ""Old School"" gives every audience a sense of humor about their own lives. Not only is the movie hysterical in and of itself, it illustrates to everyone that life should not be taken so seriously. In the end, Mitch gets the girl that truly loves him, and Frank is finally happy once he becomes the president of the fraternity. Beanie goes back to his normal life of selling audio equipment, but he still lingers around the fraternity that he helped build. The final moral to the movie is how the founders of the fraternity take care of the students they pledged into the fraternity. Yes, the pledgeship that these students endure is quite comical, but when they are faced with being expelled from school, the three founders and all the students in the fraternity are what push them through the tough times. This is a movie that you must see if you enjoyed your college years and if you just need a good laugh.",1140134400,2,2429,4.635730858468677

It's great, great fun with a hilarious Andy Dick teaching the ladies a private class (absolutely hilarious, and although I'm quite sure most people have already seen this movie, I'd hate to spoil it for the one lone freak out there who has yet to see it), the initiation of the pledges, the pledges themselves (You're my boy, Blue!), and my all-time favorite moment is Will Farrell and the dart.

The comedy is funny, but not that funny. The most intriguing character is Vince Vaughn's: the party boy and instigator of all the craziness who is carrying around his son the whole time being a dad. Other than that, a lot of the movie is a let down. What's the point of that one fat guy doing the vault with the scrawny guy spotting him? He does the vault successfully with no squashing the little guy. Big whoop. That pretty much summarizes the movie. Lots of build up with no payoff.",1130889600,3,655,4.466666666666667

And Beanie (Vince Vaughn), their cynical friend who is securely married with children, sees it all as an opportunity to party like they did when they were young. To start anew, Mitch leases a house that happens to be right next to a college campus. At Beanie's urging, the house becomes party central for the nearby college students. In an effort to shut the parties down, the Dean of the university succeeds in having the house zoned for university use only. So the revelers declare themselves a fraternity -an equal opportunity fraternity that will admit any man of any age who wants to pledge. When the conniving Dean comes up with a new plan to shut them down, the guys will have to prove that they are a real fraternity or close their doors permanently.

To say that ""Old School""'s humor is sophomoric would be an understatement. ""Old School""'s humor is infantile. The audience is hit over the head with gross-out physical comedy, beer bongs, K-Y jelly wrestling, nudity, and four-letter words. And the film does not apologize for it. ""Old School"" spoofs and celebrates fraternity life. And some of it is funny. But the gags get tiresome, and boredom sets in only a third of the way through the film. It may be the lack of credibility, and therefore sympathy, in the characters. At no point in this film does it make any sense that Mitch is even involved with the fraternity. Or it may be that gross-out jokes fall flat after the first ""oh, gross"". But I found ""Old School"" to be a snooze.

I wasn't impressed by any of the main characters, but there are a few supporting roles that may be worth mentioning. I like Juliette Lewis' swinging girlfriend character a lot. Ex-Late Late Show host Craig Kilborn does a very convincing obnoxious womanizer. And Ellen Pompeo jumps off the screen as Mitch's potential love interest, Nicole. The camera loves her, so I think we'll be seeing more of Pompeo in the future. If frat-boy humor is your thing, you might enjoy ""Old School"". Otherwise, I don't think that you will find the few good jokes and supporting performances worth your time.",1123545600,,2252,4.713197969543147

So after his break up from his girl friend Heidi (Juliette Lewis) Mitch finds a new place not far from Harrison University.

Beanie throws a ""small get together"" which means a majority of the campus shows up and there is a cameo by Snoop Dogg playing himself.  During this time Frank reverts back to Frank the Tank drinking from multiple beer bongs (""It tastes so good when it hits your lips"").

There's lots of sexual innuendo, and lots of drinking, etc etc.  If you enjoyed animal house you're probably going to like this.  Also a cameo by Andy Dick (as Garry) and Leah Remini (King of Queens) as Beanie's wife.

1499342,5,B00005JM1F,"In 1978, a film was released called ""National Lampoon's Animal House"". The film was a hysterical look at a group of fraternity buddies at college out looking for a good time. The film made a legend out of then ""Saturday Night Live"" castmember John Belushi and became a comedy classic.

25 years after the release of ""Animal House"" came ""Old School"". Well, ladies and gentleman, you finally have the 21st century version of ""Animal House"". I mean seriously, consider the facts: both films have to do with old college buddies out to for a good time, and both feature showstopping performances by ""Saturday Night Live"" cast members (Will Ferrell is so funny in this film).

Mitch Mitchell (Luke Wilson) is a successful bsinessman with a beautiful home and an equally beautiful girlfriend (Juliette Lewis). But things soon come crashing down when he realizes that his girlfriend is cheating on him. Distraught, he moves out and seeks sollace from his friends Beanie (Vince Vaughn) and the newly married, ex - party boy Frank ""The Tank"" Ricard (Will Ferrell, playing the Bluto of this film). Their plan: to turn Mitch's new home into a college fraternity, where kids can enjoy loud music, alcohol and hot women galore. The plan becomes a huge success - until dean Prichard (Jeremy Piven, who is hysterical) intervenes, saying that Mitch's house is college property and he must move out. What ensues is an all out war to keep their beloved frat and the good times rolling.

""Old School"" is chock full of hilarious and unforgetttable moments, including the opening scene where Mitch realizes his girlfriend is cheating on him, a KY jelly show that goes horribly wrong, and Frank getting shot in the neck with a dart. But none are more funnier when Will Ferrell takes of his clothes and begins streaking. The best part is when his wife catches him, forces him to get in the car and go home, when Will all of a sudden spits out, ""Do you think KFC is still open?""

In addition to its strong main cast, it also features some great supporting roles and cameos by Elisha Cuthbert (Jack Bauer's daughter on the first three seasons of ""24""), Snoop Dogg, Seann William Scott (Stifler from ""American Pie""), and most hilariously, Andy Dick (I can't really go into detail about the latter's part).

I haven't watched all the extras, but I can tell you that the ""Inside The Actors Studio"" spoof is definitely worth the price of this dvd. ""Old School"" is a great film for everyone who enjoys fine Americsn comedy (and especially ""Animal House"" fans).",1118534400,3,2529,4.778032036613272

1499344,5,B00005JM1F,"One of the funniest movies of 2003, Old School is silver screen gold for anyone who lived the life of a college party animal or once inhabited the halls of a beloved fraternity house. In the spirit of Animal House and PCU, Old School brings together a strange amalgam of immature males who wreck havoc on their college campus through wild parties, outrageous pranks, and outright criminal activities. Starring Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Will Farrell (of Saturday Night Live fame), Old School reads like a great SNL skit. You'll laugh yourself silly over this one.

When Mitch Martin (Luke Wilson) returns home early from a business seminar at his extraordinarily boring job, he finds his girlfriend cheating on him. They break up, and he's forced to move out. Moving into an off-campus dwelling at his old school, Mitch's friends Frank Ricard (Will Farrell) and Bernard ""Beanie"" Campbell (Vince Vaughn) reminisce about the glory of their fraternity days. The days of all fun and no work... Frank gets married, despite Beanie's attempts to talk him out of it at the altar (during the ceremony), but he quickly grows despondent and longs to enjoy the freedom of his youth once again. Meanwhile, Beanie is a bona fide family man with a successful business, but he too would like to relive the fun of their fraternity days.

Together, the three men decide to turn Mitch's house into a fraternity. They recruit a series of misfit students from around campus - nerds, social rejects, homeless men, and ninety-year-old womanizers. The hazing rituals are beyond description, and the parties are ridiculously outlandish and hilarious. All is going well (for everyone but Frank whose wife catches him running down main street naked) until Dean of Student Affairs Gordon Pritchard (Jeremy Piven), a former estranged classmate of the three men, decides to crack down on the fraternity. When he does, the fraternity must pass a series of tests and obstacles in order to retain their charter (and this, the climatic high-point of the film, is also the funniest of all).

Fun from beginning to end, Old School will not win any awards for dramatic scenes or cinematography. But it will win a lot of points as an outright hilarious comedy. If you haven't seen this film, then you really don't know what you're missing. Old School is a classic cult comedy fulfilling the dreams of countless former college fraternity members who ache to relive the greatest party days of their lives. Because it's so funny, Old School is a definite must-see film. Miss it at your own risk...

The movie starts off humorous and ends humorous. Old School is one of those comedies that makes you laugh until you cant laugh anymore while sticking to an interesting plot line.

Old School will keep your eyes glued to the screen through all the parties, nudity, streakings, and outrageous behavior. For a little taste of the humor, imagine Will Ferrel being shot with a tranquilizar gun in the jugular and watching him trip out. Who would of thought that a man with a tranquilizar dart in his neck would be able to survive after knocking over numerous tables, pushing a few kids out of the way, and finally falling into a pool, only to be rescued by the donkey trainer.

1499462,5,B00005JM1F,"Definitely an outstanding comedy, Old School, brings to the screen the story of three buddies, played superbly by Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Will Ferrell, as they go through some rough times in their lives.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.  Old School is simple enough, but it is frightening at how close it comes to describing people's every day lives.  To a certain extent it does bring to mind Friends with its presentation of both Comedy and Drama, but always in such a way that is both realistic and enjoyable without becoming corny or overly melodramatic.

It just goes to show you that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.  In short, Old School is a must-see film!",1105056000,,929,4.745341614906832
1499463,4,B00005JM1F,"I didn't see this movie when it came out in the theaters as I thought the movie looked pretty stupid.  Then I saw Dodgeball and that was my first introduction to Vince Vaughn.  I liked his ""Bill Murryesque"" portrayal in that movie so I decided to see what else he was in.  A friend recommended Old School and with low expectations for the movie, I rented it.  I watched it first by myself and giggled most of the way through.  Then later, my husband and I watched it and this time I liked it even better.  I liked the fact that even though these guys on the surface seemed to be jerks, underneath they were actually pretty nice guys.  A great example of that in the movie is when Beanie is alone with a coed in his room at the ""frat"" house and she comes on to him.  You can tell he is torn, but ultimately, tells her ""I can't, I'm married."" I just love that scene and Vaughn is brilliant with it.  YOu can see that even as he is turning her down that he wishes he could be that kind of guy who would cheat on his wife.  FOr all his blustering about how miserable wife and kids are, he is actually a sweet dad, and a loyal husband.  It is this type of little nuance that saves this movie from being just another stupid bad boy comedy.

The big laughs are there as well.  OF course the famous streaking scene is hilarious, but I had seen most of that in trailers so it wasn't a surprise.  The scene in the van when they pick up their recruits is another hilarious part. But there are many more funny little lines here and there that to me make up the best parts of the movie.  For example, when Will Ferrell is describing his weekend plans of going to home depot etc, to the college kids, I just crack up.  The gentle way Vaughn is with his son and baby and then ""ear muffs"" them and swears etc, is great.  And the birthday party scene with Beanie yelling at a pledge who took the headpiece off of his costume because it would upset the kids while he is dressed up as clown and is chainsmoking and drinking.  I could go on but I will stop now and just go watch it again!

ALot of people have complained about the ending and I disagree.  I liked the way they took the tests etc and beat the dean.  The dance scene in the gym makes the whole last third of them movie worth it.

The performances are all very good although I don't really think that this sort of comedy is Luke Wilson's forte.  He was ok as a straight guy, but I don't really think he could play a funny part.  Will Ferrell was very good, but his ending bothered me.  I kept hoping he would pull out of his alcoholic ways at the end.  If I really think about that, it is sort of depressing.  Vaughn was the fantastic,especially compared to the laid back performance he gave in Dodgeball.  I hope his upcoming films will not disappoint.  As for this movie, buy it, kick back and don't be embarassed to laugh at the non-pc, sexist, silly, sometimes vulgar, but essentially sweet nature of the movie",1104883200,,2957,4.184070796460177
1499464,2,B00005JM1F,"This movie is what happens when the guys from ""Animal House"" decide that the real world is too real for them. To sum it up, Vince Vaughn, Will Farrell, and Luke Wilson start a fraternity in the midst of female problems in order to save Wilson's character from losing his house. From there, hilarity is supposed to ensue when they degenerate into a college lifestyle of partying it up and getting crazy.

I wanted to like this movie because I like the stars of this movie. I wanted to laugh out loud, and I wanted to come away from this movie raving like everyone else did when they saw it, but I couldn't. Other than a great 80s music soundtrack and a cameo from Snoop Doggy Dog, there is nothing original about this movie that sets it apart. If you want classic National Lampoon, get ""Animal House"".

The humor is simply stale. It's all been done before in just about every movie of this general genre since the early 80s.  And while stupid-funny is good, this only manages to be stupid. It isn't even charming in its stupidity.

What saved it from one star is personal bias. I love the three stars of this movie and generally enjoy watching them in action. Were it not for them, I would have turned this turkey off about halfway through.",1103846400,5,1239,4.4449339207048455

I felt like any movie starring Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn is at least worth watching.  Within the first 5 minutes of the movie I had cracked my first laugh, a subtle laugh that seems to be ongoing through out the entire film.

The basic storyline of the movie is about one of three middle aged men who moves directly onto a college campus into a house that would soon become one of the biggest party houses the college had ever seen.  The house is later threatened to be rezoned by the university because it is not providing for the school in any way.  The three men then decide to form a fraternity, which leads to a series of outrageous and hilarious events that all the members of the fraternity experience.  The movie never loses interest; there is funny part after funny part, and even a couple of guest star appearances.

""Old School"" is hands down one of the funniest comedies I have ever seen.  The star studded lineup adds a lot to this movie and makes it that much more entertaining for me personally because I recognize each of the characters from different movies or shows.  There are non-stop hilarious scenes from the movie, the laughs just never stop.  I would recommend this outrageous comedy above any other, I guarantee you won't find a dull moment.

It's ridiculously funny, and Will Ferrell is epic.

The set-up and plot are well described elsewhere.

What you need to know is that the film is a simply-but-well told story, and the performances are just swell. Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn are in fine form, and Jeremy Piven is positively evil incarnate as the Dean. Makes the guy from the aforementioned older movie look as threatening as Barney.

However, it is Will Ferrell who you will remember when the movie is over, and it is Will Ferrell who will remember for some time afterwards.

In fact, the sight of him streaking has scarred me for life. But I giggled uncontrollably while I watched, unable to avert my eyes.

He is uninhibited, but somehow always remaining truthful to his role. He's immersed. He IS ""Frank the Tank.""

He's out there. On a limb. And in every scene, he totally ""goes"" for it. He's a a manic joy to watch.

THe unrated version adds naughty bits, which is perfectly fine for this material, and the ""bells & whistles"" are notable for a hysterical parody of ""Inside The Actor's Studio"", with Ferrell lampooning host James Lipton...

 I've just read an article about how today's comedy is reaching the high standards of the 70's/80's (BLAZING SADDLES, SNL, SCTV, Monty Python, ANIMAL HOUSE, CADDYSHACK)--but the only problem is that this current crop of comic filmmakers have yet to produce a bonafide classic.

Mitch Martin(Wilson) is in his early thirties and works in the real estate business. He goes home one night to find his girlfriend with some other people and the relationship is off. In his depression he goes and buys a house up near the local Harrison University.

Frank(Ferrel) is getting married. He is a little unsure of marrigae but does it anyways. He however can't pass up the chance to party with Mitch at his new place.

Beanie(Vaughn) is a millionaire. He owns six electornic stores and he looks at Mitch's new place as a huge opportunity. The place is right by the school that means one stop long party every night and everyday.

The first party is a blast and Mitch becomes a hero to these local university students. However, there fun is stopped short by Dean Pritchard(Piven) who says they can't live in student housing. They have until the end of the week to leave. The guys don't like that idea and they decide to start a fraternity.

They get there pledges and the fraternity is on. Pritchard won't stop though and he will do anything to shut them down. Now the guys  must keep the party rolling and stop Pritchard before he stops them.

This movie is hilarious. There isn't anything not to like about it. The three major stars make the movie. Will Ferrel is one of the funniest guys alive. Old School is his funniest movie to date. Vince Vaughn is the man. He's his normal funny self and Luke Wilson is great. It's the funniest movie of his carear. You have to love these three guys in the movie.

I love Old School. This reminded me a lot of Animal House and a lot have labeled it as this generations Animal House and I agree. This is a great frat humor movie and if you love that kind of stuff you will love Old School. If you prefer a cleaner comedy than this is not your ideal movie.

1499720,1,B00005JM1F,"People complain that this is a rip-off of Animal House.  It isn't.  It is even worse.  It is a rip-off of Revenge of the Nerds.  Only it doesn't have the wit, charm or likeable characters.
My teenage kids watched this movie on the airplane during a family vacation.  They saw I was renting the DVD and told me it was a crappy movie.  I didn't believe them.  I thought that because they were young, maybe they just didn't get it.  Maybe they couldn't relate to some middle aged men trying to recapture some of their youth. Or maybe the jokes were just too mature or referenced too much of the seventies. But, they were right.  It has nothing to do with character study at all.  It is just a bunch of dumb, juvenile jokes that even teenagers don't think is funny.
This movie starts off promising, and there are some funny moments in the first half.  But, after that, it just gets tiresome and boring.  The last half is pulled right out of Revenge of the Nerds, where the frat house has to go through a number of trials to keep their house.  The trials are so contrived and uninteresting that it is just excrutiating to watch.
I didn't think that the DVD extras were worth getting.  How good can deleted scenes of a bad movie be?
I saw the ""unrated"" version, expecting some racy material.  I don't know what was added, but it must have been a very tame movie in the theaters.  This ""unrated"" version is just barely R.  Will Ferrell's butt, a few quick glimpses of breasts and a suggested head job that really didn't happen.  Airplane! was racier than this.",1088380800,9,1553,4.408450704225352
1499721,5,B00005JM1F,"This looked like the last movie I would ever get, not being particularly into farces and screwball comedy. But
if Vince Vaughn (""Swingers"", ""Made"") is in it, then I probably will give it a look. ""Old School"" fulfilled Vaughn's comic promise, but it is ensemble and great.
It starts out with just the right touch when Luke Wilson returns home and finds sexy girlfriend Juliette Lewis expecting not him but her ""Internet friends,"" who are coming over ""for the gangbang."" Makes you want to do a Google search for ""single girls looking for group sex.""
This is an up-dated ""Animal House"", maybe better. Luke's post-Juliette recovery includes moving into a house next to the college, and when it looks like he cannot stay due to school regulations, they form a fraternity. Luke is a lawyer and his legal skills keep them above the dean's attempts to disband them as part of a childhood revenge.
Vince gives us great lines like, ""What do you think, instead of spending time with my wife I'd rather hang out with 19-year old girls?""
USC grad Will Ferrell, who once tried out for the Trojans as a punter, may carry this film through sheer craziness. There is little message, just laughs. It has some mature themes, but despite Juliette's sexual wanderings is basically tame.
In the end, Juliette is still into swinging, when she invites Will to her next sexfest.

1499722,4,B00005JM1F,"The boys that brought us ""Road Trip"" are back again with ""Old School"" and it's pretty much what you'd think it would be.
THE STORY:
Mitch (Luke Wilson), Frank (Will Ferrell) and Beanie (Vince Vaughn) are a bunch of 30-something guys who decide to open up a frat house near their old college campus and pretty much get into all the clich frat things to some pretty hilarious results.  Among other things they let in just about EVERYBODY (including an old homeless Vet) into the frat and they take on the crooked college Dean who holds a grudge against them from their old college days.
THE COOL THINGS:
Overall, the film is what you'd expect.  It's a ""dumb"" comedy and the boys get themselves into some pretty hilarious fixes.  Nothing sophisticated here which is good.  We've got streaking, we've got the sophomoric humor and that's about it.
THE NOT-SO-COOL THINGS:
Well, given that it's a ""dumb"" comedy as you'd expect, some things are pretty funny and then again, some things aren't all that funny.
BEST SCENES:
1. The BJ School
2. The Tranquilizer Dart
3. The ""Exam"" Scene
4. The KY Wrestling scene
THE DVD EXTRAS:
As standard for these new DVDs, you've got a truckload of extras.  Like the film itself, some of them are hilarious and some of them aren't.
1. ""From the Cutting Room Floor"" - 8 deleted scenes
2. ""Old School Orientation"" - 13 minute film synopsis featurette
3. ""Inside the Actors Studio Spoof"" - 21 minute spoof of a ""serious"" talk show segment with the main cast and directors, complete with overly dramatic host and canned audience reactions.  It got old after like 4 minutes...
4. ""Outtakes & Bloopers"" - 5 minute montage
5. Commentary Track
6. 3 TV Spots & 1 Trailer from the films promotion
7. Sneak Peaks:  Trailers for ""Biker Boyz,"" ""The Fast and the Furious Tricked Out Edition,"" and ""Head of State""
8. Photo Gallery
9. Cast Bios
10. Filmmaker Bios
11. Production Notes
THE VERDICT:
Well, for a ""dumb"" comedy this is definitely one of the better ones.  It was waaay better than ""Road Trip"" but as with stuff in this genre it's just okay.  You'll get a good laugh and you'll also shake your head a few times too.  Overall, not bad for a weekend rental and if you loved the movie the extras justify this as a pretty good addition to your collection if you're so inclined.
GRADES:
The Movie:  3  stars
The Extras:  5 stars
Overall:  4  stars

In the beginning of the movie, Mitch comes home and finds that his girlfriend Heidi is into ganbanging.  Frank gets married but finds that he can't stay married because he feels that he is losing himself and goes out of control at the Mitchapalooza party.  Beanie is married with children and is doing what he can to help his friend Mitch get out of his funk.  They form a fraternity with some of the guys that are considered not popular enough.  Then in comes the dean who can't stand the sight of them.  He was picked on by them and plots revenge against them.  He uses the SGA president and pre-law student to deny the fraternity their charter.
This movie is hilarious.  Big boy dropped his attached concrete in the manhole and fell.  That has got to hurt! Seeing Will Ferrell naked was even hilarious.  He was the lone streaker until he was busted by his wife while she was driving her friends.

1499866,4,B00005JM1F,"I know, I know, the plot for this film has been rehashed from ""Animal House"" and countless other college debauchery flicks, but so what?  OLD SCHOOL is a hilarious romp of scintillating and titillating proportions, a 90-minute mad dash of sight gags, crude one-liners, and tongue-in-cheek zaniness.  If college fraternities were really like this I never would have left academia (well, I did have my own ""eight-year-plan,"" but that's another story).
Three thirtysomething buddies (Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Will Ferrell) decide to revitalize their lives by cranking up a college fraternity whose members are not required to be students at the local university.  Of course, such a blasphemous act draws the ire of the college's administrators (insert ""Animal House"" plot here), and accordingly, the fledgling frat must do battle with the corrupt, unscrupulous establishment.  Sure, this ground's been covered before in countless other movies, but OLD SCHOOL adds its own loony spin of mayhem--from concrete blocks tied to fragile appendages, to eye-opening mud wrestling.
While OLD SCHOOL's cast, from top to bottom, is excellent, Will Ferrell dominates this film (much like Dangerfield in ""Caddyshack,"" or Belushi in ""Animal House"").  As Frank ""the Tank"" Ricard, a newlywed with a party animal mentality, Ferrell's over-the-top antics are bust-a-gut, roll-on-the-floor funny.  Ferrell, whether he's streaking or performing a gymnastics floor exercise, carries this film like a fullback with a football.
If in fact we equate entertainment with escapism (which I do), OLD SCHOOL delightfully fits the bill.  You'll forget the problems of the day with this puppy, and you'll have fun in the process.

1499867,3,B00005JM1F,"From what I've read in reviews and stuff, and from the press, I was so thinking that I was going to be offended by this film, or some such other utter nonsense. That's why I thought it would be good to review - so I could give a really bitchy long review, and go on about how it's a total guy films, cos all the chicks get their kit off, and none of the guys do.
After being warned by the person watching it with me, that I was going to be offended, I couldn't see how I was supposed to be. I was expecting right from the start to be a sort of American Pie etc film - lots of nudity, crude jokes etc. It wasn't. There are a few funny bits, but they're few & far between - I think there's something wrong me, I don't laugh at films/TV anymore, unless it's the little bird in Looney Tunes: Back In Action! The nudity is also hardly there - a guy running through the streets naked, and two girls, who take off their tops, and 'surprise' an old guy. (You can see that bit coming!)
Otherwise, I was quite disappointed with this movie. I was wanting to write a really long review and really complain about this film, but unfortunately, I can't. I will say one thing, it's not that much of a guy movie it's made out to be.",1079827200,3,1215,4.045643153526971

Cauos ensues, and they get in trouble with the dean, who is planning to stop the raging party everyone is talking about. Of course audiences made this silly comedy a hit, and has fast become a popular party movie.

1499869,4,B00005JM1F,"I can honestly say I left the theater unhappy after watching this movie.  And I don't know exactly why, but I think it's because this was somewhat of a formulaic comedy similar to just about every other comedy out there.
But the more I look back on the theater, I think I went into it looking for a ""classic"" comedy, something new and mind blowing, and this isn't that. This is along the lines of Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and even as far down the food chain as say Duece Bigalow or The Ladies Man.  (yes, I have targeted SNL Flicks there, but this movie DOES star Will Ferrell).  That being said, I think of this movie as having some great lines and or scenes (Shawnn William Scott's small part is one of my favorite parts of the entire movie).
If you're looking for some goodhearted, crude, humor, then this is the flick, it's not a ""classic"" (it's not Animal House, as much as it wants to be), but it's well worth a watch or two.  If even for just the funniest 10 moments or so.",1077235200,2,985,4.279569892473118

1499969,4,B00005JM1F,"""Old School"" is quite simply a blast.  The cast for this film is phenomenal, but Will Ferrell steals the entire show.  He takes every scene that he appears in, hands down.  The idea for this film is quite original. I agree with the reviewer who remarked that the comedy in this film is quite fresh until it becomes a classic ""beat-all-odds"" competition at the end.  There is never a dull moment.  As with any modern comedy, there are many inconsistencies and storylines that are not completed or followed out: Wilson sleeps with an underage girl without consequence & Ferrell's divorce that passes without a problem or second mention.  But following these storylines would have detracted from the central pivot of the film: the second coming of the fraternity.  Before watching this film, I thought much of the comedy would focus upon this fraternity.  But the comedy that exists in the tangential storylines is enough to carry the entire film.
""Old School"" is an exciting and fresh comedy.  Don't come looking for intellectual dialogue or witty humor.  Come to watch Will Ferrell create, once again, a remarkable and memorable character.

Through parties, and subversive behavior the frat finds it's way to stay on campus and more importantly make us the audience laugh. The frat brothers are as diverse as it gets, from an enormously overweight kid to an incredibly old sailor named Blue. I wasn't really a huge Will Ferrel fan going into this film, but after seeing this hilarious film with some seriouss spray milk through the nose moments I came out ranking his performance up their with the likes of Bill Murray, Chevy Chase, John Belushi, and Dan Akroyd. His scene in the pool will go down in history as one of the all time great comedy classics. The only weak parts in this film to me were some of the romantic sub-plots between Luke Wilson and his old high school sweet heart. The moments between the two are too warm and touching for this film. These continually reoccuring scenes felt out of place in this outrageous laugh fest of a film. But this complaint is minor.

The movie is also loaded with little moments and bits that help make it shine too, and you quite often don't see the jokes coming.

1499975,5,B00005JM1F,"""Old School"" is the clear and obvious best comedy of 2003, hands down. I actually saw it in the theater four times - yes, that's four - mostly because I kept going out with people that hadn't seen it yet. Every experience was the same - the theater was locked in hysterics for the duration of the movie, from the opening scene.
But as I watched the movie again and again, I began to really feel cheated by the ending. Up until this point it's a quasi-reality based film, with somewhat believable characters. Then at the end it turns into a 1980s Donner film, where a 400-pound kid is suddenly endowed with the ability to flip through the air like an Olympic gymnast, and Will Ferrell's character begins speaking expertly about a political topic he knows nothing about, actually stumping James Carville. I understand it's just a silly comedy, but up until this point everything was just funny and true - it felt very ""hand of God""-ish.
However it only weakens the movie slightly, and even within these unconvincing moments it's still very funny. Buy it. You will watch it again and again. The bonus features are great, including a spoof of the Actor's Studio with Will Ferrell as James Lipton interviewing the entire cast.

While it's in no way an outstanding movie, it gets the job done in the Funny Department.  I'm not really picky when it comes to comedies.  As long as I laugh, I'm pretty happy.  This movie made me laugh numerous times, no matter how goofy or lame the gag.
Mitch thought he had the perfect life, until he came home early one day and found out some of his girlfriend's ""erotic"" pastimes.  Needless to say, the two break up and go their separate ways.  Now, Mitch has to move out and start a new life, while still being broken up about the whole ordeal.  His friends, Beanie and Frank, are determined to get their friend to be happy again---so they decide the best course of action is starting their own fraternity!  The guys may be in their thirties, but they still know how to have a good time and live it up as if they were still in college.  However, the dean is none too happy with the new ""frat house"" and is determined to get it shut down, no matter what it takes.  All of this leads up to a very hilarious movie.
Directed by Todd Philips (""Road Trip""), ""Old School"" is highly entertaining and comical.  It's raunchy, of course, but it still knows how to be funny without going over-the-top in every scene or gag.  While it's in no way a masterpiece, I was very entertained for the entire 1 hour and 32 minutes.  Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn are very funny in their roles and really make the script work.  The person who really steals the show, however, is none other than Will Ferrell as ""Frank 'The Tank.'""  I don't know if the movie would have been half as good without him.  He really knows how to take his comical antics to the limit and is never afraid to try anything new (even if it means ""streaking"" in a neighborhood, only to be caught by his new wife moments later).  All in all, the movie has many elements of hilarity that works most of the time.
The DVD has some neat features to offer.  One of the main highlights is that this is ""uncensored"" and shows footage that could have never been shown in the theatres.  I've never seen the theatrical version, so I have no idea what was added.  I do know that it is an extremely outrageous movie and can tell why exactly it is ""uncensored.""  Surprisingly, this movie is offered in DTS.  I don't really see this as a movie needing it, but hey, I'm not about to complain about it.  Extras included are bloopers and outtakes, deleted scenes, featurettes, commentary, and more.  Plenty of cool features to play around with.
I ended up really enjoying ""Old School"" for what it was.  There will be many people who will not enjoy the raunchiness of the movie, but there will be many others who will.  If you're looking for just a plain ol' good time, then this might be the movie to check out.  The movie did its job and made me laugh.

  When Mitch catches the early flight home from Denver only to catch his girlfriend cheating on him inspires his good friends Frank and Beanie to through him a ""kick off"" party in Mitch's new campus house as a way of ""releasing him out into the wild"".
  Due to regulations set forth by the Dean, Mitch is forced to turn his home into a faternity house, while recruiting fourteen new pledges.  The Dean does everything in his will to get rid of this new fraternity.
  The new fraternity is the new ""hit"" around school, so the boys decide to do everything possible to keep the fraternity.  With scene after scene of hilarious footage, ""Old School"" will have you on the edge of your seat with non stop laughter.
  Overall, I give ""Old School"" 2 thumbs up!  It is the ultimate comedy for more then just a few laughs, and gets funnier each time you watch it.",1069286400,4,1090,4.673684210526316
1500233,2,B00005JM1F,"**1/2 ""Old School"" is a raucous, raunchy comedy in the ""Animal House/Bachelor Party"" tradition.  Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn - all of whom are very good in their roles - play a trio of thirtysomething losers who have never really grown up, despite the fact that one of them is married with children, another has just gotten married and the third wants desperately to have a meaningful relationship.  The three come up with a scheme to create an ""unofficial"" fraternity at the local college, giving men of all ages a chance to get away from the rules and restrictions of everyday adult life.
Although there are a few undeniably funny moments in the film, ""Old School"" is basically a numbskull comedy filled with junior high-level jokes and pratfalls, some of which work but most of which don't.  Like far too many comedies that advertise themselves as freewheeling, daring and iconoclastic, ""Old School"" ends up literally ""old school"" in the end, coming out foursquare in favor of responsibility, seriousness and conformity.  In other words, it wants us to identify with these juvenile grownups, then turns right around and makes them just like the people they've been going after all along.  Unfortunately for the viewer, ""Old School"" loses the courage of its convictions early on.
There's not much point in over thinking this.  Suffice it to say that ""Old School"" sprinkles a few good laughs over a parched desert of a comedy.",1068940800,3,1442,4.93801652892562

I had very low expectations for this movie because I'm not a big fan of Will Ferrel - he's never really made me laugh that much before... But this movie shocked me at how funny it really is.

This movie wasn't as childishly raunchy as I was led to believe it was.  Rather, it is sweet in the appropriate spots, a tad rude without being vulgar, and boisterously funny without ever being mean-spirited.

Three adults, played by the capable cast of Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughan and Luke Wilson, have all hit a crossroads in life and circumstances force Luke Wilson's character to move into a house on a college campus.  There is the obligatory wild party and crazy college antics, but Old School seems like a movie without a clue of what it wants to be about.  Is this going to be a movie just about crazy adults who start a college fraternity, or is it going to be about some crazy adults who are trying to find their way in life, and along the way start a fraternity.  Scenes seem spliced together, going from a frat party to a birthday party for Vince Vaughan's kids.  Then the conclusion is incredibly ridiculous.

I have read some of the reviews and I have to agree that the the unrated and out of control part may be misleading to some people.

We did purchase the unrated edition, but I don't think there was really too much material that was added...
I loved the cameos in the movie, from Snoop Dogg to Andy Dick... they really added to the overall humor.
The special deleted scenes on the DVD are also great--don't miss them!  Also, if you are a Will Ferrell (SNL) fan, check out the Inside the Actors Studio clip.  It runs a little long, but has some hilarious moments.",1060992000,,793,4.479166666666667

It is entertaining and light-hearted in its own right while managing not to sink to the hellish pit that movies such as Freddie Got Fingered inhabit. It might not be the most original of comedies, but then again, what comedy in recent memory has been? I alternated from chuckling at embarassing situations to balling on the floor laughing at some points in the two hours I spent watching this film. The basics of the plot can be summed up as follows; three buddies finding marriage and adult responsibilities to be overly burdensome, decide to spice up their life by starting an eclectic ""fraternity"" at a local college. Something about seeing older guys trying to start a fraternity is highly amusing to me. With the motif of fraternal bonding at its core, I feel that Old School appeals mainly to guys. This is the type of movie where after finishing the movie, you can lay back, scratch yourself and reaffirm your manhood. That being said, this is not to say that only men can watch this; anyone can appreciate this movie's downright hilarity. An easy 5 stars.",1060646400,,1145,4.758793969849246
1500359,3,B00005JM1F,"Ok, so maybe it's not ""Animal House"", but in a time of silly teen comedies, ""Old School"" delivers exactly what you can imply from the title. Also, it's just another excuse to watch Will Ferrell (one of the funniest guys alive in my opinion) doing what he does best: make us laugh until we fall from our seats. Also, this Unrated version is the one you want to have, where they make sure not to hold back any punches. And did I mention that, for a change, the special features [aren't bad]?
The plot is the least important thing. Actually, it's very formulaic: Luke Wilson's character buys a house on campus territory and lets his crazy friends (played by Vince Vaughn and Will Ferrell) to make a giant monster of a party. It's so wild, that the next day he is kicked off the University grounds by the Dean (played by Jeremy Piven, who does the complete opposite of his character in ""PCU""). So the three friends have only one solution: start a fraternity. From then on, you know the drill. They have to overcome all obstacles and beat the system that's trying to bring them down.
The movie is also a wonderful parody of ""Fight Club"", not only because of key scenes involving the recruiting of new frat members, but also because it carries the same load of self-destruction, especially regarding the character of Will Ferrell: Frank the Tank, a guy who realizes he doesn't want to live the life of a married man and returns to the life he used to have in college, mainly becoming a sloppy drunk. You can see also lots of cameo appearances, like 24's Elisha Cuthbert, Juliette Lewis, Sean William Scott and Snoop Dog. The humor in this film is very 80's, but it doesn't come close to the stupidity of teen films like ""American Pie"", ""Not Another Teen movie"" or ""Just Married"". This one is made by proffesionals, and you can see that.
Now, for the edition, I think the best thing is the Inside the Actors Studio spoof. I would buy the DVD for this feature alone! You know from SNL that Will Ferrell does a great impersonation of James Lipton, and here he does a 20-minute piece in which Lipton interviews him and the rest of the cast. The fact that no one is laughing and the interview has a ""serious"" tone makes it even funnier! Just watch it and you'll pass out laughing. I know I did. The other features are ok, but this is the one to check out.
So, in conclusion, ""Old School"" may not be the best comedy around, but it makes a sincere effort in avoiding the cliches of today's comedies and return to hard-core stuff with great, experienced comedians. For all fans of will Ferrell is a must see, but if you want the best college comedies, you're better off getting ""Animal House"". This one I'd recommend to rent and then you'll see for yourself.",1060646400,,2744,4.479041916167665

The whole concept of the movie is unbelievably humorous, and the cast is excellent.  Will Farrel steals the movie with his SNL-like personality and willingness to do anything for a good laugh.  As this movie centers around 30-somethings, it has plenty of classic 80's references and tunes thrown in.  One of the best comedies of the past year.",1060300800,,512,4.633333333333334
1500480,4,B00005JM1F,"Old School is a very funny movie that is a throwback to Animal House starring John Belushi.  The movie is about three friends in their thirties all struggling to realize that they're getting older so they start a fraternity on a college campus.  Seeing that they cause so much trouble and that many members don't even go to the school, the evil dean steps in and tries to revoke the charter.  Some scenes will have you rolling around on the ground in tears they are so funny.  The iniation with the cinder blocks, picking up the pledges, and the school spirit routine with Will Ferrell in the mascot suit are all hysterical.
  The cast for Old School is surprisingly good.  Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell, and Vince Vaughan are very good together throughout.  Wilson plays the straight man although he has several funny scenes.  Ferrell is great through the whole movie as Frank the Tank.  His streaking scene and his inspirational speech, a la John Belushi, are two of the funniest scenes in the movie.  Vaughan's speech at Frank's wedding is also very good as he tries to convince him not to get married.  Juliet Lewis, Craig Kilborn, Andy Dick, and Sean William Scott all make basically cameos, but are all very good.  William Scott as a white trash animal holder is very good as Ferrell shoots himself in the neck with a heavy duty tranquilizer.  The Unrated DVD Special Edition doesn't offer much that is different from the movie that was shown in theaters.  Included on the DVD are the widescreen presentation, trailers, an outtakes reel, several deleted scenes and a feature length commentary.

It's basically about how Luke Wilson(Mitch) had his girlfriend doing nasty stuff when he wasn't around. He basically leaves and gets a new house. Here, he Vince, and Will all start a ferternity. Mitch isn't really into it, and Dean Pritcher trys to shut it down. The comedy is fresh though, and not moronic. The whole weddinggift/present thing I saw coming a mile away, still all 3 of the guys did an awesome job acting it out.
Will Farrel(Frank the Tank) does an awesome job. He portrays the crazy guy perfectly. He isn't too crazy, has his composure, but does crazy stuff. Anyways, he basically does mostly all of the comedy, and really makes the dvd a hilarious movie. Go buy it, there is some minor nudity, nothing too big though.",1059868800,,1009,4.489130434782608

The basic storyline is simple enough: three thirtyish guys start a fraternity in a college town, to prevent a foreclosure on one of the guys' house. Pretty thin premise, but Wilson, Ferrell and Vaughn provide a fair number of laughs as the plot unfolds.
The trailers make this movie out to be grosser than it actually is. Except for one tasteless (but funny) sequence featuring comedian Andy Dick as a red-wigged ""b-job"" coach, there's not much that's really very raunchy. You get a minute or so of Will Ferrell's butt, and a few seconds of bare female breasts, and that's about it.
Overall, Old School is a good-hearted movie about male early-midlife crisis, that happens to feature a lot of drinking and frat-house shenanigans. This is a high three-star entry, not quite worth four stars, but a ""thumbs up"" nonetheless.",1059264000,,931,4.782608695652174

With that said, if you complained about the directing or cinematography (or anything like that) of this movie, you sound like the kind of person who probably shouldnt have watched this in the first place.  Now, personally, this is the funniest movie I have ever seen.  Due to the comedic attempt to comedic success ratio being almost 100% (there are two ""meant to be funny parts"" that I feel are weak), it already beats out every other comedy I can think of (again, this is very subjective so relax all you Emerson film students).

Pulling from movies like Animal House, Revenge of the Nerds, or any movie about college boozefests, this movie gives a hour and some change of nothing but zanyness. Let me say that I love Will Ferrell and he steals the show on every movie he plays in (i.e.- Austin Powers, Ladies Man, etc). Will plays a recovering alcoholic by the name of Frank ""The Tank"". He decides that Frank ""The Tank"" needs to be put behind him, so he changes his life and gets married. However, he has a friend name Beanie (Vince Vaughn) that has other ideas. Beanie is a married man who hates marriage......figure that one out. Beanie is hell bent on going back to the days of his youth and he needed a way to do it. Thus, enters Mitch (Luke Wilson) who after finding out his girlfriend is a freak moved to a house that was near the college campus. Frank and Beanie decide to cheer him up by throwing this wild, binge drinking party (Mitchapalooza). That's when the madness begins. Frank The Tank relapsed back to his old ways and soon becomes the life of the party when he joins in on the binge drinking. Add some willing co-eds, banging music, more drunk college students, and Snoop Dogg (better known as Snoop-a-Loop) and you have yourself a legendary party. The three men become instant legends on campus and decide to form a Fraternity that is like none other. They do it to spite the dean who hates their guts because they picked on him when they were teens. That's where it really gets crazy. Mitch becomes known as the Godfather. Frank begins to have marital problems. From streaking to K-Y Jelly wrestling to tranquilizer darts, this movie delivers nothing but good times. Will Ferrell is one of my favorite comedians. His physical comedy is probably one of the best in the business. He doesn't take it as far as Jim Carrey does, which is a good thing. He gives you just enough to keep you in stitches. Vince Vaughn plays the part of a sleazy salesman to the max. Once again, I will say that comedies are supposed to be more funny than real. If you want real life, watch real life stories or a drama based on a true story. Comedies are founded on the premises of making people laugh and this comedy is no exception. If you want to laugh, rent this movie. It's hilarious. If you enjoyed Animal House, Revenge of the Nerds, and any other college boozefest, then you will love this movie. The ending is a bit cliche and the plot is a bit too farcical, but what it is is good slapstick comedy. Oh yeah, there is even a love story thrown into the madness. I give it an A.

Anyway, Frank's best buddy, Mitch is just coming out of a relationship and his friend Bernard (Vaughn) rents him out a house almost directly on campus at Harriman University. Right off the bat the boys throw Mitch-a-palooza, a huge party with Snoop Dogg as the entertainment. Frank starts doing funnels and quickly assumes his old Frank the Tank persona again by streaking through the quad. There are so many funny parts in Old School but they are all directly linked to Ferrell. Luke Wilson plays the voice of reason but it isn't heard too much during Old School. Vince Vaughan is really funny as Bernard who is worth about 3 Million (that the Government knows about) by owning a chain of Speaker City stores. I'm not really sure why this was ""Unrated"" because there are only one or two nude scenes and one really raunchy scene with Andy Dick.

1500588,1,B00005JM1F,"I know I am in the minority on this one, but that can't change the fact that I had laughed exactly two times by the time it was over.  I certainly expected an evening of ""gut-busting"" laughter when I sat down to watch it, considering every single person I talked to said it was one of the funniest movies they had ever seen.  However, as I continued to watch, I began to wonder if I was seeing the same movie everyone else saw.
Now, I do tend to favor a different type of comedy, namely the Christopher Guest movies ""A Mighty Wind"", ""Best in Show"" and ""Waiting for Guffman"", but there have been a decent amount of what one would call low brow comedies that I have enjoyed.  I liked the Austin Powers movies and ""There's Something About Mary"", I even liked ""Half Baked"" with all its stupidity, but ""Old School"" was just a dud.  The jokes and gags all had a oddly familiar feel to them, like I had seen them already many times over, and they had lost their appeal a long time ago.  Even the turn of events in the movie, with the cliched ""mean dean of the college"" and the against all odds ending didn't come off as funny but rather as tired and overused.
There really isn't much more to say about ""Old School"", I mean, it's not like it warrants an in depth analysis of its ""plot"". To me, it's just a movie that failed to do what it was supposed to do, namely making me laugh.",1058140800,8,1373,4.20532319391635
1500589,5,B00005JM1F,"Yes, the comparison to Animal House is fair in some ways.  The cast of both movies had substantial support from Saturday Night Live (SNL) crew, and of course the Fraternity vs. Dean plot line was good, but that's where the similarity ended. While Animal House was know for it's college-mentality plot, and what later became the definite standard of college humor movies to come (spoofed/carried by the Nerds series, as well as other comedies like Big Man on Campus, etc...), it never did have the ""clean, production look"" of a movie of it's caliber.
Old School has a more grown-up view of fraternity life, and in all honesty is closer to reality than Animal House EVER was.  What Animal House (and Dartmouth College) did to discredit Greek organizations, Old School seems to have portrayed  in a positive light.  Granted, Old School gets a bit off color in subject matter at times, but nothing that would seem out of character or included for shock value as so many B movies seem to do.  This focus on gut-splitting humor (verses random, gratuitous nudity) is typified by the difference between the R rated and Unrated versions.  As other reviewers mentioned, the R version (which I saw in theaters...twice) is not much different from the unrated DVD... the focus here was humor, nothing more.
The physical humor, decent plot, great character development, and cameos by Snoop Dog, Warren G, a host of SNL staff, as well as other comedy-focused actors leaves this movie chalk-full of talent and obviously had some serious financial support... and it shows.
Will Ferrell shows again why he is one of the funniest actors in Hollywood, while no one in the movie missed a beat whether it be a soft delivery, missed facial gesture, or even milking the plot for everything it had.  It was a bit long (spasm-laden stomach muscles will do that though), and I tried to think if a few scenes could have been ""possible cuts"", but the character development and humor involved in EVERY single scene was just too good to miss.
Seeing this movie in theaters left me feeling I paid a fair price, which is unusual considering the vast majority of so-so movies that we've been force-fed by Holly Wood the past few years.  Borrowing this DVD from a friend (and seeing it 3 times in 2 weeks :)) has left me convinced I'll be adding this to my DVD collection shortly.  As a truely underrated comedy (which is unusual considering the ... comdies that are industry-standard), this is a definite must-have.",1058140800,,2481,4.77803738317757
1500590,2,B00005JM1F,"If you are thinking about buying this DVD, you've probably already seen the movie.  And if you haven't seen it, you're not missing much... just check out any college based comedy from the last 20 years, pick out any random events, and update it to 2003, and you're pretty much up to speed with things.  A lackluster and overly predictable story, far too many clichs, and acting that would be better left on a bad Saturday Night Live rerun, make this flick about as memorable as...whatever that other hideous collection of celluloid was.
Normally, a movie of this genre would at least give me some chuckles here and there, but the best I could do with this one is to sit back and admire the realism of Craig Kilborne's bit part portrayal of a typical oversexed, under committed, narcissistic...Shows how much of an impact the rest of the movie had.
But, while the movie itself drew extremely heavy vacuum, a couple of the special features nearly helped me to salvage my 2-hour investment.  Most notably, the parody of ""Inside The Actor's Studio"" where Will Ferrell's dead-on impersonation of sycophantic rambling James Lipton goes completely ""Twilight Zone"" while interviewing the Old School cast members...including Will Ferrell.  It also turns out that a couple of the features ""deleted scenes"" were actually more interesting than the edits in the film itself.

Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn also are really great.  They portray the more serious aspect of Old School.  I can not see any two other actors playing their parts expect for Owen Wilson.  I have been a huge fan of the trio Wilson brothers and Wes Anderson ever since Bottle Rocket. Old School is a highly recommend film.  No awards or Oscars for actors just a hilarious movie.

Beanie suggests that they form their own fraternity in Mitch's new house on a college campus to re-live their glory days by bringing together a variety of misfit college students, losers, middle-aged and elderly retirees as their new friends and later try to avoid being evicted by the new Dean of Students, Pritchard, whom still holds a personal grudge against all three of them.
I heard about this film from a friend, so I tried it, and laughed myself senseless. Will Ferrell is hilarious as a newly-wed numb-skull. Luke Wilson is quite funny himself. But the funniest was Vince Vaughn. I thought his role in this was about as funny as Swingers (in which he was hilarious). As good as the film was, I still couldn't give it the full five stars.

1500673,1,B00005JM1F,"I strongly recommend this DVD, but not for any reason the average slacker nitwit might understand or appreciate.
""Old School"" is execrable. (And that's being nice.) The director, who's also the co-writer, has absolutely no idea how to create interesting characters, get them to interact in an amusing manner appropriate the the plot, or ""build"" the story to a comic catharsis. It's like listening to an early Dvorak symphony -- good ideas, poor development. Todd Phillips is a ""talent"" on the level of John Hughes.
If you were hoping the unrated version included NC-17 material, forget it. There's nothing that goes beyond the R rating of the theatrical release. And the end credits include a gratuitous scene in which two of the ""bad"" characters die in a gruesome freak accident.
If you want a genuinely funny movie about college life, try ""Animal House,"" ""Back to School,"" or ""Real Genius."" Heck, ""Amadeus"" is a _lot_ funnier, and it isn't even _billed_ as a comedy.
So, why is this DVD is a ""must-buy""? Have you seen ""Inside the Actor's Studio"" on Bravo? The host, James Lipton, is one of the most pompous, nauseatingly fawning intellectual jerks ever to walk the planet -- even worse than Dick Cavett. One of the DVD extras is a devastatingly nasty send-up of the show, with ""Old School""'s director and the three principal actors a Lipton look-alike's guests. This alone justifies the price.

Like another reviewer said, L.Wilson does act the same way as he does in all of his movies. I really think he'd make a better dramatic actor. As for Will, I really expected Ferrell to make us laugh, but considering the ""serious"" personalities of the actors he had to work with, I think it affected his comedic ability.

1500675,4,B00005JM1F,"What I particularly liked about this movie and thought it did so well was appeal to a more expansive demographic than its recent new-age-real-comedy cousins like American Pie and Road Trip.  It offers a vicarious escape from a mundane, suburban reality for those individuals looking to recapture the days of their elder-adolescence.  It encourages the recently thirty-somethings to embrace their residual immaturity and not abandon their proclivity to party.  It also has obvious value with those still living their elder and younger adolescence.  Story line goes a little something like this:  Dude breaks up with girlfriend and realizes his life has become a cesspool of barbeques and picnics, completely devoid of the reckless abandon he used to thrive off of.  His friends begin marrying off and as a way of reclaiming his more carefree days he moves to a college campus and becomes the founding father of a faux fraternity which doesn't discriminate on age, academic standing, class status, or even being a student.  As their popularity swells they battle for recognition from the university which they find themselves loosely affiliated, while the sinister dean plots to ka bash their senseless shenanigans.  Through out their plight there's a continual stream of comedic antics that carry an otherwise sluggish plot.  Its success and popularity are a direct result of combining and expanding upon the recent comedic successes of movies like American Pie, Van Wilder, and Office Space.

Good casting, some very funny lines and situations, and the crudity is more restrained than usual, but without telling, it's simultaneously nave and covers no new ground as the ANIMAL HOUSE school.

1500680,4,B00005JM1F,"First of all, a banana is not a vegetable.  A vegetable is a usually herbaceous plant (such as the cabbage, bean, or potato), which is grown for an edible part that can be eaten as part of a meal.  In contrast, a banana is an elongated usually tapering tropical fruit with soft pulpy flesh enclosed in a soft and usually yellow rind.
Second of all, the myth of Romulus and Remus is a Roman legend and not a Greek story.  Seduced by the god Mars (not Ares), the Vestal Virgin Rhea Silvia bore twin sons, Romulus and Remus.  Left to die in a basket on the river Tiber by her wicked uncle Amulius, the babes washed up on shore and were nursed by a she-wolf and fed bits of food by a bird until they were found and raised by a shepherd.  Growing to manhood they discovered their true identities and eventually founded the city of Rome, over the dead body of Remus.
When a film like ""Old School,"" which takes place across the street from a college campus, gets the facts wrong it certainly takes away from your enjoyment of the comedy.  Maybe when Will Ferrell's Frank is streaking down the street he is doing that wrong as well.  Maybe Vince Vaughn's Beanie does not give you the keys to Speaker City if he cannot beat a competitor's deal.  Maybe Luke Wilson's Mitch does remember what happened when he woke up in bed with an under aged coed.
""Old School"" is about the aforementioned trio of friends who are disenchanted with becoming adults in the real world and who end up turning the house Mitch is renting into a college fraternity so that he can stay there.  That particular situation is contrived, to say the least, but then it ends up being pretty clear that the point of this film is to put three thirtysomething guys in situations that borrow from ""Animal House"" and pretty much every other party animal college film you have seen.
Ironically, given that this is the ""unrated edition,"" which means they throw everything back into the movie except a handful of deleted scenes, the storyline of ""Old School"" ends up seeming like scenes have been cut.  The relationship between Mitch and Nicole (Ellen Pompeo) hits a couple of stereotypical snags and they end up getting resolved off screen.  However, the biggest offense of this film is that when it comes time for the frat boys to take on the evil, wicked, bad, mean, and nasty Dean Pritchard (Jeremy Piven), the film fails to come up with anything that is either particulary memorable or especially funny.  Instead of having a climax, this film just sort of peters out at the end.
Yes, there are some big laughs, such as when we learn a new use for asphalt bricks, but the film is mostly Vaughn and Ferrell stealing scenes from Wilson, who really does not have a whole lot to do here.  The extras include the previously mentioned deleted scenes, some outtakes and bloopers, and a less than steller parody of ""Inside the Actor's Studio"" (Ferrell does double-duty but the other two stars and writer-director Todd Phillips (""Frat House,"" ""Road Trip"") look lost during the proceedings.

Not that I'm a prude or anything like that, but it might be a good idea to send younger children out of the room BEFORE you put it in the DVD player.
Having said that, I feel it is necessary to address the comments of one customer reviewer who asked how anyone could dare to compare Old School to the classic Animal House and complained that the plot had been ""done before"".  As to the first complaint, it should be noted that Old School was produced by Ivan Reitman, who has been associated with a number of great comedies in the last few years, including Animal House.  As to the second, I must respectfully disagree.  The notion of some thirty somethings starting their own fraternity has not to my knowledge been done before, although this movie is somewhat derivative of college comedies such as National Lampoons Van Wilder and PCU.
The basic plot of Old School is simple enough-three 30somethings played by Vince Vaughn, Will Farrell, and Luke Wilson decide to relive their college days by starting their own fraternity.  All three actors are in top form here, even Wilson, who is cast against type as a straight man.  But it's Vaughn's performance as the group's leader that really makes Old School funny.  Jeremy Piven, also cast against type, is the uptight dean of the college who carries a grudge because he was picked on by Wilson's Farrell's and Vaughn's characters when they were younger.  Much like Animal House's Dean Wormer, he tries to get the frat tossed off campus but is unsuccessful.
While Old School isn't quite as funny as Animal House, it is certainly worth watching as it carries on the comedy tradition set by that film, although the formula is slightly different.",1055635200,5,1824,4.73186119873817
1500829,5,B00005JM1F,"Ok, granted this is not a thinker, but it's one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.  The comparisons to Animal House etc are a little bit off, I think. The humor is really more of a modern variant, sort of dry with clever timing. Picture Wes Anderson (Rushmore, The Royal Tennenbaums) and the Coen brothers (the Big Lebowski, Fargo) getting falling-down drunk.
The three main chacters are all excellent. Luke Wilson plays the likable straight-man, with some of the more subtle humor of the movie (I use 'subtle' in a relative sense) as he responds to all the absurdity.  Vince Vaughn is beautifully ridiculous as the mover and shaker of the frat. To make a fight club analogy, he is the proactive Brad Pitt to Wilson's reactive Edward Norton.  Will Ferrell is also at his best - a wonderful loser, making us simultaneously cringe and laugh as he blunders through his life.
There is perhaps a little too much emphasis on the plot, which is pretty much the standard for a college movie (the evil dean is trying to get rid of the fun people).  But I suppose a little plot is necessary, even in a film like this.",1055635200,,1121,4.5073891625615765

1500943,3,B00005JM1F,"A movie like ""Old School"" should know better than to mess around with a serious plot.  Most college gross-out comedies like this one don't.  Even ""Animal House"", the Gold Standard of college comedies knew enough just to have a plot that led to various gags, concluding with the incredibly funny final act.  All that was just so the guys could mess around.  For the first 2/3rds of ""Old School"", the movie knows enough than to take it's plot too seriously.  And for those 60 minutes, it's low comedy at it's best.
The basic plot outline is that Mitch(Luke Wilson) has just broken up with his long time girlfriend when he discovers that well, she's been cheating on him.  Big time.  Anyway, he gets a new house on the outskirts of a college campus, and his friend Beanie(Vince Vaugn, laying on the smarm), who feels trapped in his marriage and REALLY misses college, convinces him to form a frat to allow Mitch to keep his house, which the vengeful college dean(Jeremy Piven, painfully unfunny for the first time ever) wants taken over by the school.  Mitch relents in the face of the needs of his friends, especially Frank""The Tank""(played by Will Ferell in a star-making performance), who just got married but has quickly gotten seperated because he a booze hav a special relationship that some might call addictive, but which Frank considers necessary.
Anyway, the start the Frat, with a rogues gallery of pledges, some of whom are not students, such as ""Blue"", played by Patrick Crenshaw, who is just barely outshone by Farell for comic brilliance.  The movie moves from one set of gags to another, mostly howlers that will have you in stitches.  Then, the movie simply stops being that funny.  The plot takes over, and instead of simply being a vessel for more jokes, it takes over completely, with the gags becoming fewer, and the ending being really, really unsatisfying.
This was the same problem Writer/Director Todd Phillips had with his first mostly funny film, ""Road Trip"".  There, just towards the end, too much plot takes over, and the ending feels rushed, just like it does in ""Old School"".  While the last frames are funny, the big 20 minute hole in which the plot takes precedence over the jokes hurts the overall ranking for the film.  Also, Phillips can't write women well, and it shows in the opening scene and in Luke Wilson's sort of romance with Ellen Pompano's character.  It's just very weak.
The DVD itself, however, does have some great stuff.  The unrated edition has more risque, nasty stuff if you're into that sort of thing(heh), and the disc also has a hilarious bit in which Will Ferell reprises his interpretation of ""Inside the Actor's Studio"" host James Lipton in which he showers the film and actors with praise better suited for a Royal Shakespere Company production of Hamlet.  There are also deleted scenes that are pretty clever.  There is one thing Phillips has been consistantly good at: picking music for the soudtrack.  ""Old School"", just as ""Road Trip"", has the perfect song selection for it's best scenec(I've never seen Metallica's ""Master of Puppets"" used more effectively).  Anyway, Phillips is developing as a comedy writer and director, and is prepping a sequel to ""Old School"" with the original cast.  Hopefully, he'll throw most of the plot out the window and let the cast work it's magic.",1055203200,,3341,4.826315789473684

1501028,4,B00005JM1F,"""Old School"" brings back the fun and irreverence of the days of ""Animal House"" that so few movies seem willing to revisit.  Comedy these days seems built around 'paint-by-numbers' formulas or 'let's see how much we can gross people out' shock characteristics.  Current releases like ""Boat Trip"" and ""Bringing Down the House"" fall in the former category while any movie involving Tom Green or the Farrelly Brothers falls into the latter category.  In ""Old School"", it's refreshing to see a movie that takes a 'devil may care' attitude with its plot and characters while also have the common sense to push the envelope where appropriate without ever crossing the line (following ""Animal House's"" lead).

  In ""Old School"", Mitch (played by Luke Wilson) is depressed after a breakup with his longtime girlfriend.  He moves into a new house near the local college campus and his two best friends, Beanie (Vince Vaughn) and Frank 'the Tank' (Will Ferrell) decide to cheer him up by using his new house to throw a wild 'freedom' party.  In a party complete with nubile co-eds, binge drinking, and a performance by Snoop Dogg, the party becomes legendary and draws the ire of the college dean, who just happens to be some nerd that Mitch, Beanie, and Frank tormented in high school.  He attempts to take the house from Mitch by claiming it can only be used for campus-related events.  This sparks Beanie's imagination to create the most unorthodox fraternity in existence to circumvent the dean's ruling.  From there, ""Old School"" engages in the type of 'us against the administration' hi-jinx that made ""Animal House"" such a riot.

  Will Ferrell gives a performance worthy of John Belushi with his Bluto-esque take as Frank the Tank, whose relapse back into his college days fractures his brand new marriage.  Yet, it doesn't seem to affect Frank too too much.  Ferrell, as witnessed by his years on Saturday Night Live, is one of the more gifted physical comedians performing today.  He has the lunacy of a Jim Carrey without any of the pretentiousness or self-importance that seems to plague Carrey.  Vince Vaughn gives another winning performance as a typical, sleazy salesman type who remains just enough on the side of respectability that you still like the guy.  It's classic Vaughn.  Luke Wilson's performance isn't quite as memorable, but his lovable-loser demeanor fits the role of Mitch perfectly.  There are a number of other supporting characters that, while barely more than one-dimensional, make this film a winner (Blue, the 80-year fraternity pledge is a personal favorite).

  With world events becoming more somber and depressing and with movies becoming increasingly disappointing, it's quite a relief a no-frills good time can be had at a theater.  ""Old School"" lets the audience feel that kind of relief.",1048550400,47,2820,5.038876889848812

Old School is a very funny comedy about three thirty something guys who are trying to settle down with their lives but when that fails they try to recapture their college days. Mitch Martin (Luke Wilson) moves into a college house and is talked into starting a fraternity by his friends.
The movie was great. The comedy was brilliantly unpredictable. It is really hard now a days to come up with a comedy that hasn't been done before. Old School accomplishes just that. Of course being a fan of Ferrell I am going to go out on a limb and say he made this movie what it is.
I give this movie a 5 out of 5. Take my advise don't listen to the critics review on this movie. Critics don't care for comedies and have judged all comedies I have seen totally wrong.

Not only were the jokes and situations funny but it was also acted well. Luke Wilson did a good job in a role that doesn't call for much, which is fine. It was easy for me to assume, even though I have aspirations for him, that Will Ferrell would recreate some whacky SNL character he has played before.  However, he was not only hysterical but he played his character with sincerity and proved he can do much more than a random SNL character. Fast talking Vince Vaughn was terrific as usual, his lines delivered with sharp and accurate timing and all deadpan.  His character, as well, was humanized and not a caricature or redundant character that a film of this kind could too easily churn out. Jeremy Piven gleefully waltzed through all his scenes as the antagonist dean with ease while making the audience hate him but be able to laugh at the same time as opposed to way too many comedic ""villians."" Ellen Pompeo adds just the right femininity to an otherwise mostly male oriented film to not oversaturate it and make her love interest into an obligation by the end of the film.

The starring cast is unbelievable, as Luke Wilson (from 'The Royal Tenenbaums' and 'Legally Blonde'), Will Ferrell (SNL funnyman/'A Night At The Roxbury' star), and Vince Vaughn (from both 'Made' and 'Swingers') star as three married buddies who begin a fraternity; or something like it.  And along with the three stars, there's a great list of supporting roles and cameos.  Including Sean William Scott (Stifler of 'American Pie'), Andy Dick, CBS Late Late Show's Craig Kilborn, and Jeremy Piven.  And once you get past the long cast list, you have a very funny movie.  As the movie starts, you get a glimpse of each of the three stars and their lives; as far as their marriages go.  Then as it turns out, none of them are really happy.
And as Mitch (Luke Wilson) gets divorced and moves into a frathouse near a college, they decide to start a fraternity.  But it's not like any old club on campus--for this one you don't even have to go to the college.  Anyway, as the film roles on, you can imagine what (and if you saw the previews, you get the gist of it) they do.  They drink, party, and slowly drift away from the lives they have with their wives.  And I have to say, out of the three star performances, Vince Vaughn's was the best.  Will Ferrell's certainly is the funniest, but Vince was great.  He sort of carries in the same swagger-style he had in the riotous movie 'Made'; something that works very well for him.  I don't want to give too much away, but I will say that the previews don't even begin to prepare you.  It's definitely not one of those movies that is only funny in the previews.  The laughs portrayed there are multiplied by 100, at least.
For those of you who saw 'Road Trip' you'll not be let down with 'Old School'.  And being that it's from the same director (Todd Phillips), that makes sense.  But this one is better.  Much better.  This time around the director takes it to a whole new level.  And the characters are more well-rounded here than they were in 'Road Trip'.  The slogan of the movie says it all: ""All the fun of college.  None of the education.""  I think that speaks for itself.
So I could leave you here saying that if you liked 'Road Trip' you will like 'Old School'; and that's it.  But that's not true.  This is not just a ""teen cult"" movie--or whatever they're calling it these days--it's much much more than that.  It's a hilarious movie with an astonishing/almost too hilarious cast that will keep you laughing even through the closing credits (courtesy of Ferrell and Vince).  And it's not every day I put an exclamation point on my review titles, much less two.  I gave the movie 5 stars because that's what it deserves.  It's a 5 star movie, there's not getting around it.  And again, if you saw the previews and you laughed (or even thought about laughing) then you need to see this movie.  There's so many great lines and so many awesome scenes that I couldn't even begin to list them; I wouldn't know where to start.  Go see this movie.",1045872000,42,3127,4.422066549912435
1501143,5,B00005JM1F,"I am a big fan of Will Ferrel. He is a very talented actor and is also very funny. Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson are also very talented actors. So you know the movie has talent, but does it have depth, well, not really. Does this movie have laughs, Oh yes! This is an enjoyable movie with very many laughs, an enjoyable cast, and a FUN story. Also, Juliette Lewis is a very good actress, and we are graced with a brief moment of Sean William Scott. I laughed the whole time Scott was on the screen.
Will Ferrel displays his best talent by just letting us watch him and laugh, no holding back. Wilson is the main character, and most responsible. Vaughn gives a whole different way to make us laugh, he's definately an original. The only thing that lacks in this movie is a sense of together-ness(is that a word?). Its basically fun for the sake of fun, and stupidity for the sake of stupidity, but none-the-less, it is absolutely hilarious and eye watering funny. So I would definately say, if you are in the mood for a comedy, and have a few extra bucks to spare, make an investment in Old School, you are sure to get your moneys worth.
