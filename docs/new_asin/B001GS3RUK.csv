8306839,5,B001GS3RUK,Very good book for motorcycle adventure fans.,1439856000,,45,5.571428571428571
8306840,4,B001GS3RUK,"But it was good.  It was interesting that GlobeRiders also rode BMW bikes, just like Ewan and Charley did.",1420329600,,106,4.578947368421052
8306841,5,B001GS3RUK,"In this documentary, Helge just rides with his friend Chris Poland. I own all of these videos, and quite frankly, I just like the ones where there aren't groups. It feels like you're riding along with a good friend or two in this video. You don't get any of the motorcycle snobbery/elitism that you see in some of the other videos.",1407801600,,331,4.442622950819672
8306842,4,B001GS3RUK,Absolutely stunning photography of Vietnam and other countries in southeast asia. The film was very captivating but even though it was quite exciting I guess my only complaint was that it finished kind of abruptly and seemed to rush through the final countries of the journey and I would like to have seen more on Thailand and Malaysia but in all fairness it was primarily about Indochina specifically but I think an extra 10 or 15 minutes covering the end of the adventure would have felt more complete but all in all this was a very worthwhile film.,1237334400,2,551,4.63265306122449
8306843,5,B001GS3RUK,"GlobeRiders IndoChina is a fantastic film!  It offers fun motorcycle action, beautiful landscapes and cinematography, and insightful cultural experiences.  And Helge Pederson and Chris Poland are a great adventure duo.  I don't even own a motorcycle, but after seeing this film I'd love to take some lessons and travel the world!",1230595200,2,329,5.411764705882353
