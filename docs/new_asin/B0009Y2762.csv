2336677,4,B0009Y2762,"Happy Tree Friends is perhaps the most useless thing ever created, depicting the deaths of our wild-life friends and numerous of unbelievable... and hilarious ways. There are no morals (except for those bogus ones that end each episode), no plots, no nothing really, except colorful characters and even more colorful deaths.

Needless to say, this DVD set isn't for kids. It's barely for adults, and I'd definitely keep it away from anyone with an ""unstable"" mind. This is a series aimed at those of us who grew up desensitized to violence and death, and is merely entertainment. Nothing in these short, commercial-length cartoons should ever be taken seriously.

Overkill is a collection of the first three volumes in the Happy Tree Friends series, which can be seen on G4 or online at their website. Each volume contains basically the same thing, which is numerous episodes depicting unbelievable animated death. The episodes are random, as are the characters, which makes the series a little more unpredictable. The gems in each DVD comes in the form of the extra features. The Smoochies interactive games are fun and quick. There are plenty of bonus episodes on each disc, plus a few commentaries and some funny documentaries on the Happy Tree Friends and how they were created.

I'd recommend this series first to South Park fans, as it will have some similarities. The constant unpredictability of the deaths is a lot like what happens to Kenny each episode. Beyond that, I'd recommend it to older video game players, or to those of you who know that this is ""JUST A CARTOON."" It's fun and quick entertainment never meant (repeating myself here) to be taken seriously.",1134950400,6,1674,4.950177935943061

2336680,1,B0009Y2762,"Damn them for this. After releasing 3 seperate volumes for nearly 20 bucks each, disapoint fans by having harldy anything on the 3 discs, and ignoring the fact that just about everything on all 3 discs would fit onto 1 disc.

Now that they have ripped everyone off, they are cashing in again with all 3 discs for a couple of dollars more then it was to buy one disc individualy.

This really p*ss*s me off. Rip the fans off first, then release it the way it should have been in the first place.

Damn this chasing in, it shoudl be agsint the law... do it properly the first time and disalow them from cashing in again with a diffrent release, then speciel editions, then collectors editions, then it will come with the winter dvd, then more..... damn it, put them all out on as little amoutn of discs as possible and stop cashing in on these things.

However, if you have not already bought 4 volumes at 20 bucks each, then this 3 disc box set for less then the price of 2 is going to be a bargain and a great buy... as for those of us who have been jibbed and conned already...[...]",1123977600,14,1083,4.242718446601942

2336738,5,B0009Y2762,"This should be taken seriously and as a warning:

DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO.

Happy Tree Friends is a purposely violent show, aimed at mocking the stereotype that because the characters look cute, the show must be too.
It has a label on the front and website stating ""Warning: Not for small children or big babies."" Don't buy it if you can't handle a little red colouring!

Try to watch a few of their videso on YouTube before buying.",1230768000,,470,4.441860465116279

2336741,4,B0009Y2762,"HAPPY TREE FRIENDS - Overkill

-

Where there are cute and cuddly creatures being beaten, stabbed, decapitated, and maimed their will always be laughter...

Happy Tree Friends is best described as an `Itchy and Scratchy' concept, with many more characters, In each episode (Which last only a few minutes at best) all the cartoons are brutally killed in a hilarious fashion, over and over and over and over again.  The only real downfall is the ""giggles and lauging' at the end of each episode is a test of ones nerves.  Other than that taking 20 minutes and laughing non-stop in disgust is recommended at least once a day!

Definitely recommended to watch not sure if can justify the $31.99 price tag.  (Or be like me and wait until your roommates buys it used.)

Favorite Characters: Lumpy the Moose and Veteran Bear (Whose Vietnam flashbacks are the highlight of the entire disk.)

-4 Stars

2336742,5,B0009Y2762,"In what starts out as a regular cute little fuzzy animal cartoon, soon turns in to bloodstained but utterly hilarious slapstick in this gutrenching mix of Disney and Tarentino. Happy Tree Friends is a hit webtoon about a bunch of cavity-makingly adorable forest dwellers, who through various little snipets get slaughtered episode by episode.

Creators Kenn Navarro and Rhode Montijo brought this twisted spectacle to the web a few years ago, and has since become a hit. The normal pace of each mini-sode is that one or more of the several characters, which range from a cute bunny, chipmunk, beaver, skunk, to some of the more havoc-wreaking ones like the clumsy moose, the blind mole, and the veteran bear with flashbacks which send him into a psychotic rages, and somehow an unavoidable catastrophe occurs where most if not all the characters get hacked into more pieces than a jigsaw puzzle.

Althought not intended for younger viewers, it might be worth showing just to tick off some ultra-conservative parents!",1141603200,,1016,5.041666666666667

2336744,4,B0009Y2762,"Happy Tree Friends may look cute and cuddly at first glance, but beware: if you don't want to see these cute and cudly critters meet their ends in insanely violent, vile, sick, and insanely hilarious ways, than stay far, far away from this DVD set containing episodes originally broadcast on the G4 network.  All the cute and friendly forest animals you'd expect to see in a children's movie are here: from bears to porcupines, to even a moose and a shell-shocked Vietnam vet animal all take part in loads of misadventures that end with their grisly deaths.  It's hard to say what's tougher to swallow; the way these critters meet their demises, or how amazingly funny it ends up being.  As you can tell by now, Happy Tree Friends is definitely not for everyone (anyone who doesn't have a dark sense of humor or a high tolerance for animated violence should avoid this at all costs), but if you're a fan of such animated lunacy like South Park, Drawn Together, or even Family Guy; you should give this a look.",1136419200,4,1009,4.594444444444444
