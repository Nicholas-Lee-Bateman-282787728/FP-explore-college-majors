8082224,5,B000B64TNC,"I have been using this set of videos for about six years in the classroom.  The segment on the LAPD is a great review of the violence in LA, and doesn't choose a side.  He rides along with the Police (one of which will later appear on ""Extreme Makeover"").  He keeps a objective distance, asks tough questions, and truly tries to understand the situation.  He interviews experts and everyday people.  He takes viewers to a place that few will see otherwise, and he does it without drama or bombast.  He lets the viewer make the judgments.  Interesting to juxtapose Bratton's methods with the surge in Iraq.  The series is growing a little more dated (Ecstasy and Guatanamo Bay are no longer as important), but still raises valid questions.  The segment on High Fructose Corn Syrup is dated but still does a great job of shedding light on the product in a very non-biased way.  His documentary ""Jerusalem Stories"" is also an excellent work, looking at Jerusalem through the eyes of the three main religions.  His ""The Century: America's Time"" is available on youtube.  Jennings was a true newsman, who hit the story hard, and got to the heart of it.  He is missed.",1364860800,,1162,4.665024630541872

8082226,5,B000B64TNC,I bought this DVD for the segment called Ecstasy Rising and it's certainly worth owning just for that. The other five are also worth watching and sharing with your children and friends. It's hard to beat Peter Jennings at presenting useful information in an easy to grasp manner. He is sorely missed and this collection is a fine tribute to his work.,1273622400,4,350,4.661290322580645
8082227,1,B000B64TNC,Peter Jennings was the liberal evening news guy for ABC before he passed.  Expect liberal overtones throughout on this dvd set.  Not very good for an audience looking for fair and balanced.,1240358400,,189,4.875
8082228,3,B000B64TNC,"Six well-chosen 20/20 spots are on this DVD. It just seems that the video company is a little ghoulish, capitalizing on Jenning's death as a method to sell DVDs. Besides, who is really going to spend money on this (I got an advance copy for my blog) when in all probability, you'll only watch it once?",1129334400,4,301,4.392857142857143
