8361336,5,B002BFY17K,"We all have those late-night television moments when we are accidentally snared by a film we'd never heard of which turns out to be totally captivating. So it was with ""The Fruit Machine,"" a jewel-at-midnight film from 1988. Entitled ""Wonderland"" in the United States, it is a superb British thriller directed by BAFTA-winner Philip Saville that avoids the gratuitous and has one of the most beautiful of soundtracks(composed by the renowned Hans Zimmer, who, as they say, went on to ""bigger things"").

An explanation of what makes this such a fine piece of work and has given it a well-deserved cult following, is the focus on the two gay tearaways who are portaryed as straight-forward British youth, albeit with a simmering sexual tension between them.

It is very difficult to obtain a copy but the search is worth it. The film has had two DVD releases. In the UK on 16 July 2007 and on 9 April 2009, the German-based Pro-Fun Media released a Region 5 digitally-remastered edition in Anamorphic widescreen (1.66:1). We'll have to wait for a North American Region 1 DVD version, for it has still not materialised.

All up, it's a film that has ""Another Country""'s elegance, ""Zero Patience""'s playfulness, and ""To Die For""'s poignancy.",1291420800,7,1237,4.9375
