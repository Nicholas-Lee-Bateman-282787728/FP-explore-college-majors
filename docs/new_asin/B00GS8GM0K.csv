I think we were devoted fans after his first song!!  He is incredibly talented and absolutely hilarious.  We cannot believe he is self-taught on the guitar, because he plays like you would not believe and he can imitate ANYONE perfectly.  If you love 70s music, you will be particularly impressed.  He is also clean and family-friendly and we can feel comfortable watching these DVDs with anyone.  He makes fun of everyone, but not in a mean-spirited way and no one is off-limits.  We would love to see him in person some day, as I'm sure that has to be a real treat.  You would have to be made of stone not to laugh your way through both of these DVDs",1420675200,,786,4.228187919463087

My 20 year old brought it to college and everyone really enjoyed it.  If you don't have a lot of Tim's material already on DVD this is a great place to start since it has some of his best songs and jokes on it.",1400889600,,364,3.8783783783783785
6106407,5,B00GS8GM0K,"This is a two-disc DVD; one has comedy routines and the other is a collection of songs. Of course, you can't fit all your favorites on two discs, but this is a good selection of Tim Hawkins's best. Anyway, as long as you have ""Yoga Pants,"" what more do you need?!?",1400112000,,264,4.196078431372549

6106411,5,B00GS8GM0K,"IF you have liked Tim Hawkins in the past, you'll probably love this set.  It's a compilation of a bunch of his performances, and well worth the money.  We had a problem with the second DVD--we aren't able to use the individual menu, but we *are* able to watch the whole thing and I suspect that it's with all the DVDs (since a replacement did the same thing).  It isn't worth downgrading the DVD for that issue, however.  The material on the both DVDs is just plain fun to watch.  Tim pushes the envelope, and that's okay, but it's a warning for some viewers who might not like that type of humor.

It's something that we've watched several times, so I think it's a great DVD to have on hand.",1398556800,2,693,4.292307692307692

6106413,4,B00GS8GM0K,Tim Hawkins is funny.  Most of the stuff can be found on-line.  We watched this with friends because then we can play off each other's laughter.  Not as much fun by your-self so it was great on new-year's eve.,1398211200,,209,4.3076923076923075
6106414,5,B00GS8GM0K,My wife and I stumbled across some of his clips on YouTube and it was clear we needed to own this DVD. We have never laughed so hard! We even brought the DVD to share with a class at church and hopefully created some new fans.,1397174400,,226,3.9347826086956523

6106422,4,B00GS8GM0K,"These were well-chosen, but some of his internet thingies would have went well with this collection. The added bonus of the early footage at the beginning of his career were a nice touch. Good purchase.",1394236800,,202,4.8

The only reason that I could not give this 5 stars is because I think that there is some of his work which is actually funnier than some of the clips on this particular DVD.  Don't get me wrong, it's good, but hoping for maybe for a Greatest Hits 2 with some of his really great moments on it.",1393804800,,425,3.8068181818181817

Have lent it to various friends and they can't rave enough about him. Will be getting some of his other DVDs for sure. I'm so happy I discovered this guy. You can actually sit down and watch it with anyone, man, woman or child without worrying about what he might say or do. Nice change of pace to have funny and clean comedy. Jerry Seinfeld once said, I paraphrase  ""If you have to use an abundance of profanity to get laughs, you're not funny"". Tim is breath of fresh air in a stale world.",1393632000,,626,4.443478260869565

Tim's standup comedy is original, refreshing, and breathtakingly funny.  Anyone who has the opportunity to see him in person, should go see his show.  In addition, Tim is a great guitarist, good enough to play in any band.  His DVD's are a must to see; good enough for the entire family.

It just kept getting better.  It's the most we have laughed in ages.  He parodies anyone and anything, and picks on everyone equally.  To get a feel for his humor, you should go to YouTube and look at it.  I think there is a sample of this album on his website or YouTube.

8626689,5,B00GS8GM0K,"Tim Hawkins is brilliant. One DVD is his music videos (reminds me of a Christian Weird Al Yankovic, with his crazy parodies); the other DVD is excerpts from his various albums. I laughed until I cried on quite a few of them.

I've never watched a Tim Hawkins performance, but this is even better as it takes the best hits and bits and puts them all together--nonstop hilarity!

While great for us, though, it must have put a damper on his own sales of other albums. I saw an ad promoting a new album, and they made a big point of letting everyone know that this material was not on the Hits 'n Bits album! Great performance, and especially given the length of the two DVDs, a great price.",1484697600,,688,4.325581395348837
