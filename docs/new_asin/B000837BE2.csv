8055426,5,B000837BE2,"I remember being upset, pissed that Texas was chosen over California to play Michigan in this bowl game. The traditional BIG TEN vs. PAC TEN seemed to be in order here. Besides, Michigan and California had a good feel to it. Okay, I was wrong. And then some. This is the first football meeting ever between these two storied programs and they both delivered, providing an epic game that will always be considered one of the all time greats.
This is ABC's complete telecast of the 2005 ROSE BOWL without commercial interruption. An abbreviated pregame(national anthem and coin toss) is provided while there is no halftime nor postgame presented. An occasional edited huddle is part of the production but not done in overkill like some others in this series. The picture quality is awesome. No, this isn't a Blu-ray offering so don't go into it expecting HD. However, the picture quality is still second to none.
Exciting, entertaining game. Excellent quality. Definitely worth buying.",1488240000,,983,5.0

8055432,5,B000837BE2,"Texas vs Michigan in the Rose bowl was the best Rose Bowl of them all - even the USC vs Texas Rose Bowl.  Michigan several times had the game in the bag, but Vince Young turned in a performance that only few individuals can do and he was a one man wrecking team.  Michigan did not have answers for him and he schooled the Michigan defense at will.  On the flip side, Michigan hammered the UT defense at will as well - which only raised Youngs play.  Great game !",1154304000,5,462,4.1
