7813441,5,6301640934,"I've loved this Wonderful World of Disney movie since it aired on television years ago.  But don't buy it thinking that you're getting a story about the life of cougars.  The story is about Cougar Canyon (near the Four Corners and Canyon de Chelly area) and loosely follows a cougar as he goes about his life, searching for food.  There's a complimenting storyline about a young indian boy and his white friend and their adventures.  Yes, some of the animals scenes are set up, but I think they are well-done.",1508284800,,509,4.622222222222222

as I have been over most of the places in the movie",1340755200,2,119,3.8
7813444,1,6301640934,"The first half is inthe style of a nature documentary. It is enjoyable until you realize that most if not all the predator/prey scenes are staged and therefore unnatural. The cougar seems very tame but still manages to kill many planted prey animals. The Arizona landscape and Anasazi ruins are amazing, though the footage is grainy. The second half features an Indian boy and his white friend. Very charming despite the narrator talking over them at every moment. There is a faked nighttime scene filmed in broad daylight with a blue lens, then the stunt cougar is back chasing the boy's sheep and goats.  The Indian boy and his friend try to rescue a goat all the while tearing around ancient Anasazi ruins disturbing a
national archeological site and sacred treasure. The cougar even has a fake tussle with the white boy.  If this were a movie with dialog it would be bad but charming (ignoring the sacrificed animals). But since it is a fake  documentary it ultimately made me angry.",1337126400,,987,4.760233918128655
7813445,1,6301640934,This movie had more in it about how Indians worship nature and creation than about the life of a cougar.  Not worth the money.,1301961600,,126,4.25
7813446,1,6301640934,"This movie is a good example of baiting animals for the purpose of a ""good photo shot"". Within the first 7 minutes you will witness an eagle snared to a bush supposedly having attacked a rabbit. A cougar is meanwhile stalking the eagle. As the cougar pounces the eagle struggles to fly away but is either tied to or won't let go of the obviously snared rabbit. The eagle is then killed by the cougar. Was an eagle (supposedly a young bald eagle?) sacrificed for this supposed family film?

Obviously, wildlife filming has seen many advances since 1976. I would only recommend this film as a lesson in now outlawed animal cruelty.",1163116800,,629,4.616071428571429
7813447,5,6301640934,"I would recommend this film for adults and children alike.  It has something of interest for all age groups.  There is beautiful and awe inspiring Southwestern scenery, as the story takes place in the southwestern Arizona desert, on Navajo lands. There is a story as well, of two young boys who have lost their goat, and they think it has wandered into a canyon known as ""Cougar Canyon"" a place that is supposed to be haunted, according to Navajo legend.  They must go in to find the goat, of course, and are beset by many dangerous mishaps before they successfully fulfill their mission.  The real stars of this film, though, besides the beautiful scenery, is the superb photography of the desert wildlife in it's natural habitat.  There is a battle between a badger and a cougar, or wildcat, as it is more commonly known, with a suprise ending.  The close-ups of a diamondback rattle snake is awesome, and the narration is superb, also.  This movie is reminiscent of the old Disney Nature Documentary series that used to come on television years ago, back in the 70's. I enjoyed it immensely, and I am a senior citizen, but I can see where it would appeal to children as well, as they are usually fascinated with wild creatures like rattle snakes, wild cats, black bears, etc. in their natural surroundings.  It is actually very educational, especially to us city dwellers. I can't say enough good things about this film, you will just have to see it for yourself.",995846400,8,1466,4.69921875
