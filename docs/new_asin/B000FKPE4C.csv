8124417,4,B000FKPE4C,"DVD Review: This set is out of print but if you come across it you'll get 3 Martial Arts action movies. 7 Grand Masters has good picture quality and fits on widescreen TV. Red Wolf is the same and you get some extras like an audio commentary Bey Logan and Christy Cheung and other s***. The New Big Boss has very S****Y picture quality. It's full screen and it sucks butt.

Movie Review: 7 Grand Masters: One of the better Taiwanese Kung Fu movies made. It has an abundance of well choreographed Kung Fu action with a descent story. Not many people die but eh!

Red Wolf: Christy Cheung's butt. The End. I liked this movie for it's grisly and cold-blooded violence and martial arts action. The concept is a rip-off of Under Siege but what do I care. Everything rips off everything so shaddup!

The New Big Boss: Until I see a copy of this movie in good picture and in widescreen, this movie sucks!

Conclusion: 5 stars for the set, 4 stars for both Red Wolf and 7 Grand Masters and 2 stars for New Big Boss.",1428537600,,1007,4.3121693121693125
