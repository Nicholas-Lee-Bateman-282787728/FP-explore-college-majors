6406871,5,B00K87YGI2,"Its seemed like this whole movie was going to revolve around Ricky trying to stop the legalization of marijuana in Canada, but that is only a small part of it. There are several plots throughout the movie. All in all I thought this movie was great. Just about every character made at least a small appearance. I'm sure that most fans of TPB will love it! Cant wait for season 8!!!",1409097600,12,380,4.366197183098592
6406872,2,B00K87YGI2,"I am a die hard fan of the trailer park boys, been watching the show since it first aired, I have watched every episode of every season over and over and over, I have also seen all the movies extras , basically everything and anything they released, with that said.....
This movie flat out sucked, so many reasons:
1) filmed during the snow; none of the previous episodes or movies or filmed in Canada's dull depressing snowy weather
2) didn't seem like it was even filmed in a trailer park, the neighborhood looked really nice, the show is trailer park boys remember?
3) what happened to Mr. Lahey? The show starts of with him claiming disability, he's not his usual delusional drunk crazy self, even Randy looks different.
4) Ricky sadly is also not his usual self, don't expect too many Rickyisms here
5) Corey and Trevor? Nope they're not here, I really miss Corey and Trevor
6) J-Rock?  his role is barely noticeable, he might as well not have even been in this movie

I was really disappointed watching this, it's clear the boys where trying something completely different instead of sticking with the original format us fans loved so much.

After seeing this I hope to god season 8 is nothing like this movie :-(",1408147200,5,1219,4.608294930875576

6406874,5,B00K87YGI2,"TPB is pure genius in the finest sense of the words...a bunch of awkward, incredible characters in a dump of a trailer park (the world) who are a shining metaphor...victims of constant chaos, with few real planned successes...crash test dummies in an ongoing test of survival, who show the true value of love and acceptance for each other in every imaginable way, and never quitting. I hope this group continues to produce these examples of the finest comedy out there...HOLD ON for the ride...love these guys!

6406889,4,B00K87YGI2,"This sprightly Trailer Park Boys movie from 2014 sends the boys east for various reasons -- Julian has a big sell to make in Montreal, Bubbles finds he has inherited some land near Kingston (Ontario), and Ricky wants to attend a federal conference in the national capital of Ottawa to protest possible legalization of marijuana, which he feels might wreck his thriving hydroponics and ""honey oil"" business.  Prompted in part by Jim Lahey's chronic if unadmitted homophilic feelings for Julian, he and shirtless Randy follow the boys, just out of sight.  This is an entertaining enough feature-length film with lively performances but not enough has been made of two of the movie's three plot streams.  The best story is Ricky's, who ramps his dissent up to the federal level and gets away with it -- sort of.  Any TPB fans will enjoy this one.",1463961600,,843,4.833333333333333

He wants to go to Ottawa to make a presentation on Parliament Hill, but there are other matters that also have to be dealt with, including Julian being involved in another get-rich quick scheme and Bubbles facing a dilemma of his own when he is left an 'inheritance' from his parents.

I believe this movie was well-written and is a complete 180 from the disappointing Countdown to Liquor Day feature a few years earlier.  There is some Randy/Lahey in this too, so you won't be disappointed.",1451692800,,670,4.758620689655173

The premise was clever enough (put an end to legalization of marijuana, so it wouldn't impact Ricky's mainstay biz), and that was a great idea. From there, not much was really gleaned. I think the movie would have also been somewhat confusing for those who did not see the former series/films. The dog part was so badly done - and there was not much reference to Bubbles' kitties, which would have set up the dog scenes better. Julian, who was usually low-key, but present, was just pretty much missing from this film. Ricky was pretty consistent, but just didn't have enough to actually say that was anything fresh. Bubbles was about the same as usual, but without the energy and support formerly shown in the Julian/Ricky characters, he had a hard time not appearing to be ""over the top.""  I have the feeling that half the cast wanted to do the film and the others didn't. Love you guys, but this film was not that much fun.",1415145600,2,1004,4.4863387978142075

6406982,5,B00K87YGI2,"this movie was awesome!!! def one of the best trailer park boys movie's ever!!!
spoiler alert

it was kinda weird seeing Julian in that coat out of nowhere, ricky got his point across and was awesome as always and even bubbles has his own adventure in this...mr lahey starts coke calling it his ""white liquor"", randy's long hair was kinda stupid, and was kinda weird seeing this be the start to season 8 or whatever...

sam and cyrus team up together out of nowhere, no idea how that ever happened, Jacob out of nowhere was in the military then got fired for stealing piss..

seeing this movie after watching season 8 is f0cked!!!!
end of movie ricky sells weed legally...season 8 randy is supervisor trying to get ricky arrested for growing and selling dope in the park...big contradiction right there , proly cause there always baked out of their minds...kinda stupid for doing it like that but was still pretty cool",1412208000,2,918,4.6894409937888195

6406991,3,B00K87YGI2,"Not their best effort.  More of a dark commentary on drugs and alcohol than a comedy.  Still, it has a few classic TPB moments and does set things up nicely so that season 8 makes more sense.  It's worth renting just for the background.",1411084800,,236,4.318181818181818

6406997,5,B00K87YGI2,"This movie was well worth the wait.  Im a big T.P.B. fan and own all the season episodes and movies to date.  I was not disappointed with this addition.  I appreciated this movie from the very first scene where we got to see all our old friends assembled in one spot.  Time has changed a few (Julian, get back in the gym!) but most look the same as I remembered them.  Ive watched the movie twice in two days and will watch it again this weekend.  Lots of twist and turns and Bubbles get closure with his parents, and Ricky get legit.  What a great flick.  Best T.P.B. movie yet.  You can tell a lot of thought went into the storyline.  This was not just something thrown together to make a few bucks before we forgot about them.",1410825600,2,729,4.217391304347826

I think any Trailer Park Boys fan would thoroughly enjoy this movie.  There are some good, laugh-out-loud moments in this movie that do not feel scripted at all.  I ""highly"" recommend Trailer Park Boys: Don't Legalize It.",1410480000,10,404,4.742857142857143
