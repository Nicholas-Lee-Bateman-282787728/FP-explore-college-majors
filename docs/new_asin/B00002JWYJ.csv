Back then, I thought it was an all-time great, but I sure remembered having my thoughts  scrambled. It's a  nature-of-life questioning, clue-dropping,  self-referential piece. The images and plot relationships to the images --  all bizarre -- are a constant puzzler. It was the kind of movie I liked,  we'll see what happens when I see it again on video after the years have  passed.",939945600,8,517,4.389473684210526

1254565,2,B00002JWYJ,"I didn't like it. And I usually like movies that are psychological. It was just disturbing seeing animals decapitate. SPOILER And why would someone want their leg taken off to be symmetrical? Just a weird movie. I thought some of it was okay, but overall I didn't like it. I am a film student so I had to watch this movie for film class, besides that I would have probably never watched it.",1321920000,,390,4.3561643835616435
1254566,5,B00002JWYJ,"The scope of this movie is overwhelming. It is a treatise on polar opposites and mirror images. Life and death, black and white, light and dark. And above all, it is told through a metaphysical obsession with organic decay. It is a fascinating tale of loss and interconnectivity. You will be taken to a haunting place where you learn that there is nothing random about existence, and yet all can change on the turn of a swan. I can not recommend this movie with more passion. It is not for the small in thought. If you want to be challenged, if you want to experience beautiful cinematography, scoring and storytelling, if you want a ride like no other, watch this movie.",1311465600,2,671,4.553719008264463
1254567,5,B00002JWYJ,"Peter Greenaway's A Zed & Two Noughts is a fascinating take (both visually and plot-wise) on the archetypal theme of coping with death.  Greenaway's technical abilities shine through -- especially his haunting time-lapse photography of decaying animals interspersed with Michael Nyman's repetitive minimalist score -- and many of the standard Greenaway traits prevalent in his later films are present -- his obsession with Dutch painters, placing his characters in visually arresting still life-like tableaus, etc.

A Zed & Two Noughts marked a substantial departure from his previous film, The Draughtsman's Contract (1982).  Gone is the historical local.  Gone are the lush costumes.  Instead, the local of this vaguely contemporary tale is strangely transformed by Greenaway's camera.  Everything is symmetrical.  Everything craws with animals.  Occasionally, a location is represented by a single still that moves in the breezes ever so slightly.  Color/texture is everything.

The plot (some spoilers):  two naturalist brothers (played by Brian and Eric Deacon) grieve over the death of both of their wives caused by an escaped swan from the zoo.  The car's driver, Alba Bewick (played by the well-known And&eacute;a Ferr&eacute;ol) mirraculously survives but loses her leg.  Both brothers, in an effort to get over the deaths, decide to construct elaborate time lapse photography of decaying animals (moving up the food chain).  Also, both fall in love with Alba.  Other plot elements entwine with the central story: the dead animals used in the time-lapse photography are supplied by shady figures at the Zoo (filmed at the Amsterdam Zoo).  At the same time, Alba's doctor, convinces her that she needs her other leg amputated in a nefarious scheme to get her to fit in his recreation of various Johannes Vermeer paintings.

To enjoy Greenaway one must accept heavy-handed (but spectacular) visuals, explicit male and female nudity (rarely sensual or erotic), relatively poor acting, repetitive Nyman scores, and uneven writing (done by Greenaway himself).  However, A Zed & Two Noughts maintains a strange/disturbing appeal.  Despite the audience figuring out the rest of the plot about half-way through, the film is actually quite streamlined and concise which is astounding considering Greenaway's normal tendencies.  I found this was his best written film and I rarely cringed at the acting.  Ultimately, the film rings on the hollow side.  We don't really empathize with the characters.  We don't understand their motivations (especially during the film's last act).  Actions are often contrived.

Too often we see Greenaway the provocateur instead of consummate artist (for example the listless second half of his latest film Nightwatching) -- A Zed & Two Noughts rarely falls into that trap.  All in all, this is his best constructing film plot-wise and visually that I've seen yet (if only I could track down Prospero's Books).  A truly unsettling and hallucinatory experience....",1280534400,,2995,5.440347071583514
1254568,1,B00002JWYJ,"Greenaway is one of the most intellectually tedious filmmakers I've ever encountered and one of the most pretentious. But I think he's outdone himself with this insular muddle of a film. A Zed And Two Noughts is perhaps his most self-reflexive, self-contained and self-absorbed work with nary a character (or anything else for that matter) capable of eliciting a response from me, emotional or otherwise despite the constant visual references to the paintings of Vermeer. The air of emotional detachment is palpable in large part because this movie hermetically exists in its own bubble, in love with its own artifice, and relative to little else but itself. Its also one of the most bloodless (ironically enough considering its concern with death and decay), and least engaging films I've ever seen. I can only compare watching it to the joy of eating dry white toast while studying integrated circuit diagrams.",1278547200,2,912,5.12751677852349
1254569,5,B00002JWYJ,"Perhaps the title of this review adequately describes the film's content and emotional import. This brilliant and disturbing piece of cinematographic work by Peter Greenaway ranks among the very best attempts to open the human psyche to its own unfathomable depths.

1254570,5,B00002JWYJ,"Amazon's listing is totally incorrect! This is the AMERICAN REGION 1 edition!!!

1254571,5,B00002JWYJ,"I am very excited that Zeitgeist is putting out this new dvd transfer of this exceptional film.  This is Peter Greenaway at his finest, his obsession with ordering lives and things and with the discovery of symmetries between the obsessions that drive both science and sexuality is perfectly meshed by the story of two twin zoologists who grieve the passing of their wives in a bizarre car accident by simultaneously embarking upon a quixotic research project into the nature of decomposition and an affair with the amputee who had been driving the car. Thrown into the mix are a storytelling prostitute and aspiring writer named Venus de Milo, a murderer of black and white animals, a man who lost his legs for loving horses a little too much, a surgeon who is overly fond of amputation and obsessed by Vermeer. The best cinematic comparison is probably Alain Resnais' My American Uncle -- both films raise questions about the pretense that we are above the animals, that we are rational creatures and are not driven by instinct and drive. This film argues, I think, that we are unique and interesting animals and at our most unique and distinctive when we show our obsession with and drive to establish our distinction from the other animals. The music throughout is perfect and matches the style and tone of the film superbly; the story, while utterly unique is nevertheless comprehensible and never less than fascinating. It is the kind of film that rewards repeated viewings, and is a must-see film for those who delight in the possibilities of cinema, and are willing to suspend their expectations and be caught up by the delightful imagination and insight of one of the most distinctive and compelling filmmakers.",1201737600,12,1720,4.9106529209622
1254572,4,B00002JWYJ,"I knew how strange and unusual Greenaway could be but Zed, I believe could take the cake :). I am not sure what it is all about but I still enjoy the triumvirate Greenaway - Sasha Verny- Michael Nyman. Some ideas and images Greenaway will use in the later ""8 1/2 women"" and ""The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover"" - especially, the soundtrack. ""Dead Ringers"" and ""Mon oncle d'Amrique"" (two beautiful weirdnesses themselves) also come to mind while watching Greenaway's elegant tale of decomposing which is also his meditations about life, death and grief. As in earlier ""The Draughtsman's Contract"" (1982), Greenaway explores the relationship between the close relatives - the twin brothers are in the center of ""A Zed & two Noughts"". The movie is also a modern retelling of an ancient myth about Leda and Zeus who took the form of a swan and slept with Leda on the same night as her husband, King Tyndareus. Leda bore Helen and Polydeuces, children of Zeus while at the same time bearing Castor and Clytemnestra, children of her husband Tyndareus, the King of Sparta.

Greenaway considers that 90% of his films one way or another refers to paintings. ""A Zed & two Noughts"" refers openly and with great admiration to the paintings of Johannes Vermeer van Delft.

""A Zed & two Noughts"" is not easy film to watch, its characters are not sympathetic, it lacks warmth and sentimentality but as always in Greenaway's films, it is a feast for eyes, ears, and for brain.",1176249600,,1470,4.715953307392996
1254583,4,B00002JWYJ,"Stripes, bars, tigers, and police tape break up scenes that look like Dutch masterpieces in motion. EVERYTHING in this film is deliberate and meaningful, in contrast to life, or the view thereof it offers, anyway. Everything shown or heard in this film can be interpreted in any number of ways and all of them are intriguing. The characters are way out there and yet the seem to be actualizations of things we've all contemplated, only abstracted and made ridiculously absurd. The composition and lighting all seems bizarre and unworldly, throwing frequent visual homages to Vermeer, whose work plays a role in the film.
The narrative revolves around zookeeper twins who become obsessed with the significance, or lack there of, of death after the deaths of their wives in a car wreck involving a woman who looses a leg. The twins fall in love with the now-unhinged amputee as they become increasingly unhinged, created time lapse videos of rotting animals and munching glass from the car wreck. Plots abound around them: the intrigues of mad zookeepers, a doctor who seeks to make life like art, and a woman who employs her wiles to make the zoo her playground. All this as the narrative reels towards its inevitable (inevitable in a Greenaway film, anyway) conclusion.
The film's one weakness, if it can be called one, is that it is rather inaccessible. After multiple viewings, the whole picture eventually comes together and I have appreciated it more every time. If you're looking to just kick back for a bit and shut your brain down, though, this film will be an awful drudgery and seem rather pointless. Maybe that's what greenaway is getting at, though.",1170288000,2,1660,4.911032028469751
1254584,4,B00002JWYJ,"This movie is very twisted and very humorous in a odd sort of way. I did like it to a point, but at times it was very hard to follow. It was a movie of depth and philosophical meanings. When you are about to watch this movie, be prepared to see decaying animals. If you like a movie with alot of meanings, then see this one. You won't be disappointed.",1168992000,,351,4.0285714285714285
1254585,5,B00002JWYJ,"A Zed and Two Noughts (or Zoo) is Greenaway's best film. Made during the transition between his early experimental short films and his later more narrative (and more celebrated) ones, his free flowing structure is at its best here, fresh, witty and cerebral. In later films, one has the feeling that Greenaway tried to go back to the style set by Zoo, but with uneven results (like in the almost unwatchable 8 1/2 women). The plot (for lack of a better term): two biologists twins working in a zoo, specialized in studying the putrefaction of animals, lose their wives in a car accident. They hook up with a strange woman who lost her leg in that accident. Meanwhile, there are references to Vermeer throughout (what does this has to do with zoology, only Greenaway knows), speeded up shots of real rotting animals, Michael Nyman's hypnotic score, and also a girl who learns the alphabet through giant letters that are linked with the live animals at the zoo (for example, z is for zebra, as in a children's book). Deliberately non naturalistic, Greenaway makes from this strange melange a very compelling movie, though undoubtedly very hard to take for some.",1166313600,,1159,4.8291457286432165
1254586,5,B00002JWYJ,To fully appreciate the films of Peter Greenaway it helps to be obsessively philosophical and deeply romantic or perhaps obsessively romantic and deeply philisophical. Greenaway often explores the epic nature of tragedy. His characters are mytho-poetic heros who descend into the valley of death and ruin.,1149638400,2,305,5.6521739130434785
1254587,1,B00002JWYJ,"I am normally a very open-minded film connoisseur as I see film as potentially the greatest art form since the 'invention' of music. Films like Russian Ark, Au hasard Balthazar, anything by Bergman, Irreversible, Fitzcarrldo, Izo, The Mirror, Naked, Hana-Bi, Fallen Angels, What Time is it There?, Weekend, Tokyo Drifter, The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, etc to name a few, are all films that can express & transcend the very medium of film to convey emotions, thoughts, moods, & ideas that cannot be expressed by any other means in art. Most importantly the works breathe in essence because behind every one of them is a director/artist that is creating the film. A real creator using the creative process to form something that is at heart, only a reel of film.

Now, with all that said, I must say that cinematic projection (I will not grace the words film with it) was by & large the absolute WORST thing i've ever had the misfortune to see in my life thus far. Nothing about this in any way is constructive/deconstructive to any end since it's so busying wanking off in order to make itself as worthless as possible. In all serious regards, i've never seen anything in my life that was as absolutely pretentious & just plain worthless as this. Nothing. This was so far abstracted that anything it bothered to try & 'say' is completely laughable. Nothing i've ever seen comes close to perfectly surmising the word pretentious as this.

Nothing in element of shot composition (haha), dialog, music, etc can rise this above being the most vacant excuse for pretentious ejaculation on screen. To compare, I for one enjoy Matthew Barney's Crewmaster works which many find completely pretentious/inaccessible. As inaccessible as Barney seems, one can see an artist creating something. Even with all his Vaseline melting, hardcore band dueling, naked women swimming, at heart is a creator who while oblique, creates something that can in the very least creating with regard. Here all we have is pure wankery that attempts simultaneously to pretend to say something, while meaning absolutely nothing at the same time. Anything, any 'scene' from this garbage is just completely utterly worthless; watching paint dry would be a more worthy use of 110 minutes since paint doesn't babble at you and at least lends itself to altering the reason why you are watching it in the first place.

In all seriously, use your 110 minutes elsewhere & thus benefit/impact your life in some way other than by simply wasting minutes and minutes of your life by watching this.

Absolute pretentious excrement.",1148860800,7,2593,4.954022988505747
1254588,5,B00002JWYJ,"This may become my favorite Greenaway film.  It's just as good as The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover, and just as challenging.  It concerns itself with twin zoologists who lose their wives and become obsessed with decay.  It is so quinessentially Greenaway, dealing with birth, death, decay, food, sex, and everything pertaining to those things.  Vermmer like shots abound in the film, making it almost like an exhibition of moving paintings (Greenaway was a painter before he became a filmmaker).  On a side note, this is a great transfer from Fox Lorber.  Most of Fox Lorber early DVD's were shabbily transferred at best, perhaps because DVD was just starting out and no one was sure how it would go over, so they probably didn't want to spend the cash on great transfers.  But this one is an exception, and it's a grand exception, because the cinematography is absolutely stunning.  It's done by the late Sacha Vierny, who shot many Greenaway films (Cook, Belly of an Architect, and Prospero's Books), and who shot Resnais's Last Year at Marienbad.  I adore everything Greenaway's done (even 8 1/2 Women is interesting), and love watching scenes from this over and over again.  One of his best (and that's saying something)...",1145923200,3,1239,4.885167464114833
1254589,5,B00002JWYJ,"Between every question in this film being answered with a witty retort, the constant character jockeying for manipulative high ground and the canned music (Teddy Bears Picnic & An Elephant Never Forgets) one is humorously (but not permanently) distracted from what is at the heart of 'ZOO.' Life and death. Each character is intent with meeting life and death on their terms, whether in a quest to dish out death, explore grief through science, or obtain position through sex and money. Though there are many obsessions in this film, every one is to a single end; exhibiting some small amount of control over life and death. From the incessant flashing of lights (on/off : life/death : red/blue) to the persistant comments on zebras (black/white) and themes of death, birth and symmetry; one is completely immersed in the subject from the most primitive to the most high brow levels. The depth of what you see in yourself is only limited to how far your willing to stare into the mirror A Zed and Two Noughts provides for you.  A captivating, over-stimulating, and thought provoking ride. Bravo! The joke is on us.",1145404800,2,1114,4.863157894736842
1254590,4,B00002JWYJ,"If you have a European or multi-region DVD player, get the BFI edition of this movie, which includes a director's commentary and introduction, trailers for this and The Draughtsman's Contract and extracts from a ""making of"" documentary.

1254591,5,B00002JWYJ,"This film is an intelligent puzzle. You must be building the story , the clues are given ironically, tragicaly and above all subrepticiously.
Two twins married with two sisters , a swan , murder, guilty the same lover, the one and the couple are engaged, come together , and become unending laberynth of borgian proportions. A man dreams that another guy dreams. This story is just fascinatong
The archetipes are precisely defined. Oparin makes his own web.
The feelings involved around a common tragedy, just having the zoo as a huge frame where the life begins and ends, without any pain, with natural precision. The speling music of Nyman, Sacha Vierny and his amazing photography, the dark poetry supports the dialogues, the desperation seems even not forced but she assumes slowly its place in the play.
Greenaway is a brilliant director with a unpleasant life's view. What it realy is amazing is the total absence of feelings in every one of the depicted characters. ou won't see  a teardrop, even in the worst of one situation.
The homagge to Vermeer makes the film still more interesting, arrestong and provocative, in a style who reminds us to Luis Bu&ntilde;uel but without the religious ethics underlayed of the spanish director.
Certainly the multiple readings that Zoo and two noughts offer us walk around the biology, the huge affection of Greenaway by the insects, worms and all that little universe who survives under our indiferent behavior.
This trilogy of films together with the bely of an architect and drowning by numbers, allows us to traduce the universe of this excentric and irreverent film maker.

1254592,5,B00002JWYJ,"Everytime I see A Zed and Two Noughts I catch a phrase that I missed the double meaning on the previous time I watched it. Perhaps the fascination of watching bodies decay clouds my perceptions. Perhaps the beauty of the photographic images by Sacha Vierny, The arresting music by Michael Nyman, or the insistent guiding hand of Director Peter Greenaway (who is creating his own cinematic alphabet here, later to be explored in his subsequent films, and drawing upon his wonderful short films and early opus The Falls) is too much for one viewing to contain! Or perhaps it is getting wrapped up in the same mystery that consumes the twin zoologists.  Why death, and why a car accident involving a pregnant Swan on Swann's way, no less??!! Speaking of doubles, you have the twin brothers, their two dead wives, the two legless lovers, the doctor who is a descendant of the master forger (a great faker must be praised I guess!) Van Meegeren, himself a double (dubious) of the painter Vermeer,or the fact that there are Vermeers in the film, and they are doubled on camera in certain shots, and more and more...
Is this a waste of film?  DEFINITELY NOT.  You go into a film with the knowledge you have up to that point, and sometimes a film challenges you to rise to the occasion as opposed to talking down to an audience.  This is not for people who think watching a movie means some quiet time and maybe a laugh or two.  This is a film where you are constantly challenged to make observations and opinions based on what you are shown.  There is a thesis here, and I am not sure whether it is an artistic thesis, a scientific thesis, a moral and ethical thesis, or all or none of the above, but what I do know is that this is one of the most challenging pieces of moving image I have ever seen (I have only seen about 1,600 films in my life, so I admit I have not seen that much), and it is easier to walk away from it then to stay and appreciate the rich complexities of knowledge this film draws from.  The choice is yours but I highly recommend it for knowledge seekers.
The DVD is of great quality, and except for the lack of extras (I would have LOVED to have seen the trailer for this film), it is a worthy purchase.",1070150400,14,2221,4.37621359223301
1254603,4,B00002JWYJ,"If you are not a Peter Greenaway disciple, this film will leave you cold or confused or both. If you are familiar with his films, then this one is a must. As usual, his subject matter is decadent to say the least---death and decay (the latter being the most significant) and his approach is purely cinematic. His characters are by and large afflicted in one way or another with idiosyncrasies that range from the pathetic to the outlandish. But it is his visual approach to storytelling that really challenges. In this film, twin brothers are obsessed with watching things decay. A local zoo provides plenty of opportunity to explore their voyeuristic quests. They film (using time-lapse photography) fruit then dead animals as they slowly rot and turn to dust. A bizarre sub-plot features a woman who ends up having both legs amputated and finally wants to become one of their ""experiments"". The brothers eventually decide to become one of their own film subjects. To grasp a viewing experience like this, one has to be ready for often disorienting symbolism in colors, objects, decorating motifs and photographic images (as well as generous nudity) to grasp it in full. I cannot completely describe this film---it has to be seen to be appreciated as most of his other work does. Maybe see it a couple of times ...his films justify the time spent. But usually they are not for the easily turned-off as this one certainly isn't. Greenaway qualifies as an ""art"" director and there is really no one quite like him. His special touches are evident here that distinguish him from other off-beat directors. His films also carry an oddly sardonic sense of humor that sometimes helps to offset the often mind-boggling action and imagery. He is a modern day artist and his films are in a league of their own. Maybe it should be called the ""Greenaway genre"".",1031961600,4,1849,4.83596214511041
1254604,5,B00002JWYJ,"With ""A Zed and Two Noughts"", Greenaway has cultivated a very surreal film. I won't go into examples (many are to be found in other reviews), but suffice to say that the situations are highly unlike those you will encounter in any other film, however the sheer bizarre nature of most of the images don't strike the viewer as such at first glance because the way the movie is presented is so alien to the idea of a surreal film. Let me explain that a bit.
Make no mistake- this is a very dark, fairly graphic, and strange film. The thing is, it's presented with such elegant grandeur that the weird factor of the scenes is often somewhat muted by the feeling of watching a sophisticated living painting. I've only seen one other of Greenaway's films (The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, & Her Lover), but I've noticed this quality in that movie as well. It's not that Greenaway shies away from the money shot... quite the contrary. But the outlandish usually has a very striking effect the first time in most films, and these scenes are almost overwhelmed by a lush, full set. In most other surreal or fringe movies, things are presented in a more realistic(?) or tangible way, where here they are happening in a world that seems like a dream.
The dream-like quality also comes from the score, which repeats often and plays over much of the film. The music has a certain refined urgency, a drive that makes every scene where it appears seem like a climax of some sort.
Overall, this is a film that takes some getting used to.. even if you love it the first time you see it. Some may be thrown off by the arty self-importance that this movie is doused with, but the effect just isn't the same without it. Pretensiousness is a very good thing when it's necessary for the feel and atmosphere of the total product. Highly recommended to those who enjoy surreal films that follow no rules... even the unwritten rules of surreal films. ;)",1019088000,,1926,4.521489971346705
1254605,1,B00002JWYJ,"Greenaway pretends to be postmodern in this film and he falls in bad taste. ""A Zed and Two Noughts"" is a vain visual exercise. Director resorts a takes from silent movie age. No zooms or travelings. He splits Marco Ferreri for using the monstruosity and grotesque like topics of discourse, not counting the depth for Ferreri. This film is a parade of decay and horror that will disgust viewers. Which is the objective? I don't know. Greenaway suffers of several defects in contemporary cinema. First, we fail to recognize values and thoughts of characters and can't know what happen in the screem. It dispairs. Greenaway stays in one place and either can relate different being aspects. This movie lacks of utopy (fault in postmodern art). I couldn't understand ""A Zed and Two Noughts"". Only it repugnanted me. Is a abstract work? Any work for Buuel or Godard is upper. Visual exercise? Movies like ""In the White City"" for Alain Tanner or ""Under the Scorpio Sign"" for Tavianni Brothers are better experimental pieces.""A Zed a two Noughts"" is movie that goes to nowhere.",1009756800,7,1069,4.8791208791208796
1254606,4,B00002JWYJ,"Filmed at the Rotterdam zoo, this is a classic Greenaway film and, yes, it's visually stunning (as many have observed). It seems obsessively concerned with symmetry as a means of both annoying and captivating the audience (which in a Greenaway film is ALWAYS a voyeuristic audience). A typical film by Peter Greenaway makes many people squirm in their seats. The zoo of the title (Z-O-O) is literally a place inhabited by both animals and humans notably and insanely deprived and damaged, the latter also exquisitely depraved and caught up in a web of deceit and slow-moving carnage. One is reminded of Dostoevsky's concept of hyper-consciousness (a sickly consciousness) as the characters slowly descend into the type of soup Greenaway excells at preparing; a delicious, malicious and toxic stew, one part debauchery to two parts neurosis.
Typical Greenaway fare? Not quite. In this film alone he has mastered the intricate webwork of plot, score and set while illustrating various abnormal conditions induced ostensibly by the close commingling of humans and caged wildlife. His macabre sense of humor is evident in the visual and monstrous passages where decay and amputation unsettle the strict and unrelenting symmetry of the sumptuous signature sets. The repetitive score - a minimalist thing by Michael Nyman - is as annoying as is it enchanting. The increasingly disturbing quest of the various misfits that inhabit the zoo - the film - slowly builds to a surreal tableau where a surgeon tries to recreate the pleasant quietism of Vermeer's paintings, twin zoologists collect and photograph decaying animals (harvested from the zoological collection), a crazed administrator(?) sets up a pregnant paramour (hitherto pornographic priestess) with a zebra, and a legless woman (victim of the opening car crash) plots her own end after giving birth to twins fathered by the twin zoologist brothers who are, in turn, obsessed with becoming siamese twins (with the help of the mad surgeon). It is all too much to absorb and Greenaway has spun such a fantastic tale not to dazzle the mind so much as the eye as he works his way through an abecedaria of zoological mischief - a treatise of sorts on the evolution of obsession and the onset of dementia.",1007164800,5,2252,5.105691056910569
1254607,5,B00002JWYJ,"This is a facinating, unique and beautiful looking film from Peter Greenaway.

Also, they  become fascinated with the amputee lady who survived the car crash. It's a  film to watch many times to discover its many layers, and is perfect for  DVD. The DVD is Ok. The picture is in widescreen 1.66:1 and is very clear.  Watching some of the many rich colours really is wonderful. The sound in  mono is alright, but could have done with a surround mix. The extras are  just filmographies and awards of the actors and director, and production  credits. It would have been better to see more. Still, the film is  sumptuous, and fascinating to watch for many viewings.",967075200,5,856,4.722972972972973
1254608,5,B00002JWYJ,This film is one of the best films in term of a perfect visual image. All the symetry in most scenes are excellent compositions up to the best detail. Of course the topic and the way is manage lets the watcher to be  surprised and at the same time to enjoy them with black humor. Visually is  one of the best film ever and is highly recommended. The only problem of  the DVD is the lack of close caption and subtitles in any language which  makes  it diffcult to understand for those who do not have english as a  native born language or for people with hearing problems as well. It is a  shame that such excelent movies made in the latest technology (DVD) does  not come with technology features as close caption.,964396800,,714,4.315789473684211
1254609,5,B00002JWYJ,"The very first time I watched this film was not in a theatre but on a small black and white TV (at the time I was about 17 and still living with my parents, so what do you expect :-). It made a tremendous impression on  me then and it's still my favorite film ever. The plot is rich and weird,  the music addictive and the dialogues are both odd and witty. As you might  expect of one of the early films by Greenaway, the alphabet plays a big  part in this film. A film about the beginnings of life, birth, life itself,  death and decay. Excellent usage of clips of natural history films with the  distinctive voice of David Attenborough. There are many storylines in this  film and there's a kind of character development you don't see to often in  these modern times.  Greenaway created an atmosphere I had never seen  before in films and very few films are even coming close to it.
All in  all, as you might have noticed, I'm a sucker for this film. I can recommend  it to anyone. And hey, if you don't like the pictures, you can still play  the DVD and not watch it, but enjoy the soundtrack.",951868800,15,1096,4.236714975845411
1254610,5,B00002JWYJ,"If you're looking for a movie to leave you with a warm, fuzzy feeling at the end...then this is not for you! It is a visual essay as much as it is an anthology of scientific and philosophical musings. The film is about two  brothers - Oliver & Oswald Deuce (played by Eric & Brian Deacon),  zoologists by profession, whose wives die in a car accident. The driver,  Alba Bewick (played by Andrea Ferreol) ends up with an amputated leg.  Oliver & Oswald in their quest for details about the accident end up in  a three-way love affair with Alba. The brothers become obsessed with decay,  while Alba becomes obsessed with her one leg and eventually has her doctor  amputate it as well. After the accident, the brothers engage in  philosophical and scientific conversations about the beginnings of life on  earth, evolution and the mechanics of decomposition. Soon after the  accident Oswald says ""I can't bear the thought of her (his wife) just  rotting away."" Then the Deuce brothers begin a conversation about how  the decomposition of a body begins, the intestinal bacteria that set off  the process and how in one lick of the human tongue the are 100,000 of  these bacteria. And how Adam might have passed 200,000 of them onto Eve in  a French Kiss. Then one of them says ""What if Eve kissed Adam?"" -  ""Unlikely! She would have used the first 100,000 (bacteria) on the  apple"" This is absolutely hilarious... they are having a hypothetical  conversation about Genesis as if Adam & Eve were the true origin of  mankind, when in reality, as scientists they cannot take such religious  concepts seriously. At one point Oliver is watching a film on the evolution  of species and the narrator says ""If evolution had happened in a span  of 365 days, then, man made his first appearance on the evening of December  31 just as daylight is fading."" We hear the narrator of these  documentaries on evolution a number of times in the background, later we  hear him saying ""...it is difficult for people to comprehend the  evolutionary leap between the most sophisticated of apes to MAN, and more  difficult still how LIFE could emerge out of NOTHING."" College-level  biology students and philosophy students would enjoy this film. The  contrast between the moral and the perverse becomes increasingly  intensified in the film with the use of philosophical quotes and excerpts.  For example, when we are introduced to a woman named Venus DeMilo, she's  dressed in black going into the zoo (where the Deuce brothers work) and a  man with whom she obviously had sexual encounters asks her ""How are  the zebras?"" In a very indifferent tone she answers, ""Black and  White."" That is a wordplay on the aristotelian, objectivist, Ayn Rand  idea of the black and white, good and evil. Venus DeMilo makes it very  clear she finds obejctivism tedious, and the question of whether the zebra  is a ""black animal with white stripes or a white animal with black  stripes"" is irrelevant. There is a scene in the film which I found  particularly intriguing, Venus DeMilo and Oliver are naked on the bed  (presumably after a sexual encounter) and he has a tray full of live  snails. He plays with the snails while she rants on and on with superficial  small talk. Then she asks, ""Why do you like snails so much?""  Oliver says, ""They're a primitive form of life... they help the world  DECAY! They're also hermaphrodite... they can satisfy their own sexual  needs!"" Which in the context of things could be taken to be an  indicator of the degree of contempt he feels toward having to resort to her  for sexual satisfaction.  Later when he's visiting a recovering Alba,  Oliver blames her for the death of his wife. At this time we learn that  Alba was ten weeks pregnant. Olivers says ""It's your fault my wife is  dead. Pregnant women are notoriously unreliable...especially when they're  trying to procure an abortion!"" Later in the film, Alba announces to  the brothers that she's pregnant. Oliver and Oswald want to know who the  father is. Alba says, ""As far as I'm concerned you are both the  fathers...what's a few SPERMATOZOA among brothers?"" Then while the three  of them are in bed Alba announces to them that she can tell they are twins.  Oliver and Oswald admit to it, saying that even their wives never knew they  were twins, and furthermore they were siamese twins.  A Zed and Two Noughts  is deeply intellectual at times, very irreverent, silly, and hystecally  funny. Goes over the top in just about every scene. Writer and Director  Peter Greenaway is brilliant. I have seen two other films by him: Drowning  by Numbers and Prospero's Books. Both were beautifully photographed as is A  Zed and Two Noughts. Art students should enjoy Peter Greenaway's use of  chiaroscuro in his sets, the atmospheres created in his films through the  use of light and shadow are magnificent. The characters in the film are  like caricatures, much like people in real life. The film blurs the line  between humans as the superior creatures certain philosophies claim them to  be and the primitive, hairless apes they remain at their very core...their  self-awareness notwithstanding. This film is a must see for the Liberal  Arts Student.",948067200,33,5207,4.803389830508475
1254611,5,B00002JWYJ,This movie is one of those that stays in your mind for quite a while after you have seen it.  It has a fairly bizarre plot and there is some gore but what you mainly take from it is the depth of the emotions.  There is a lot  of emotional pain and a lot of love but it is not expressed in the  traditional movie ways.  This is a movie you will want to see over and over  again.  I first saw it more than 10 years ago and have been seeking a copy  since.,947116800,5,453,3.694736842105263
