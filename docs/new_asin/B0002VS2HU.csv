8033470,3,B0002VS2HU,"The Mummy's Hand is one hour and six minutes long and released on September 20, 1940. There was almost and eight year gap between the original Mummy movie and the Mummy's Hand, so it is assumed that the studio would have hoped the movie goers forgot the original film and the plot. This film is neither a follow up nor a sequel to The Mummy. In the original movie the mummy is called Imhotep, in the next four movie the mummy is named Kharis. Second, Princess Ankh-es-en-amon is now the Princess Ananka. Finally instead of reviving the Princess Ankh-es-en-amon with the Scroll of Thoth, it is tana leaves to keep Kharis heart beating so he can guard his beloved Princess Ananka. Also the mummy Kharis stays a mummy and does not take human form. Gone is Boris Karloff as the mummy, in is Tom Tyler as the mummy. Just like Karloff, this would be Tom Tyler only time as the mummy; mainly due to his arthritis. The movie starts out okay, buts starts to loose it half way in the story. Even the ending on how they defeat mummy in battle. The Mummy's Hand only gets a C out of me.

The Mummy's Tomb is one hour and one minute long and was released in theaters on October 23, 1942. This time around Lon Chaney, Jr. takes over the role of the mummy. It is thirty years into the future from where the Mummy's Hand left off. The High Priest Andoheb has survived being shot at and Kharis has seemed to have found some new bandages, because he was set afire last time around. The High Priest Andoheb has sent his protge, Mehemet Bey to Mapleton, Massachusetts to kill off the remaining members of the original expedition and the Banning family. Kharis kills three of the four people he is assign to. Mehemet Bey falls in love with Isobel Evans; who is to marry Dr. John Banning, Stephen Banning's son. Kharis kidnaps Isobel and is taken to the cemetery where he is being kept. John rescues Isobel, Mehemt Bey is shot, and Kharis gets caught in a house fire, the end. Throughout the movie, Kharis is unable to use his right leg and arm. At the climatic end, he suddenly regains recovery to do battle. One footnote about this movie, in the Mummy's Hand Wallace Ford character is Babe Jenson and in this movie his last name is now Hanson. This movie seems to go nowhere and the story is almost predictable. This gets a C- from me.

The Mummy's Ghost is one hour and one minute long and was released in theaters on July 7, 1944. This was the fourth installment of the Mummy series. Kharis is now living in Mapleton, Massachusetts. How he got there or how he survived another burning the movie does not explain why. Yousef Bey (John Carradine) is sent to retrieve Kharis and the Princess Ananka and bring them back to the Hills of Arkan. This time the spirit of Princess Ananka rests in Amina Mansouri. Her hair keeps turning white as the picture moves along. Basically it is the same plot that you saw in The Mummy's Hand and The Mummy's Tomb. The only different is Kharis and Amina Mansouri are drowned in a swamp. The beautiful woman does not survive in this picture nor does Kharis dies another fiery death. This is one of the rare Universal horror\monster movie were the leading lady and the monster dies together. Footnote about this movie, Acquanetta of Jungle Woman fame was cast as the leading actress but hurt her self on the first day of shooting and was replaced with Ramsay Ames. The Mummy's Ghost only gets a C+ and that is only for a different ending.

The Mummy's Curse is one hour and was released on December 22, 1944. This is the final movie in the Universal Mummy series. This takes place in Louisiana Cajun marshes. So how we went from Massachusetts to Louisiana is anybody guesses. The movie does not explain how. Virginia Christine takes over the roll of the girl carried into the swamp; Ramsay Ames was the person in The Mummy's Ghost. During the clearing of the swamp, Kharis and the Princess Ananka are unearthed, but not together and not at the same time. So as usual, Kharis has to go on one of his killing sprees to find his true love. It ends with the Princess Ananka turning back into a mummy and Kharis kills Ragheb for killing Zandaab. While trying to kill Ragheb part of the monastery wall falls on the both of them. This time around Kharis is not showed that often as he was in The Mummy's Ghost. During a flashback to explain why Kharis is still alive we are shown footage of Tom Tyler from The Mummy's Hand and if you look closely you will see Boris Karloff in that same stock footage. Footnote about this movie; in the last three movies it is three tana leaves to keep Kharis heart beating and nine tana leaves on the cycle of the full moon to give him movement. In the Mummy's Curse it is reversed or the actor saying this unknowingly said it backwards and no one caught the mistake. Everything in this movie is C+ quality.",1327363200,,4845,4.441573033707865

This set contains four horror movies from the 1940s that feature ""The Mummy"", a creature that rises from the dead past to threaten the current living. They are a sequel to the 1932 movie, the origin for these stories. A 3,700 year old preserved mummy can be brought back to life by the use of a magic potion brewed from ""tanna leaves"". This story echoes the vampire films of ""Dracula"". These films tell about life and its assumptions in 1940s America, as viewed by Hollywood. The 1942 Office of Price Administration (OPA) was a super-agency that controlled wages and prices for the war effort. It restricted Hollywood spending and consumption. Movies were made with lower lighting (""film noir"") to save coal and oil. Background sets were reused whenever possible. Film footage from earlier movies was recycled for lower costs. Note that recurring TV shows avoid the problem of new sets. [Do tanna leaves have a symbolic meaning?]

""The Mummy's Hand"" tells about two adventurers in Egypt who find and excavate Princess Ananka's tomb and bring her mummy back to America for fame and fortune. But there is a complication from the guardian mummy Klaris who is brought back to life to safeguard Ananka.

""The Mummy's Tomb"" takes place twenty years later. Andoheb returns with Klaris to seek revenge on Steve Banning and his descendants in Mapleton. Will his son John Banning be saved so he can return to duty? Will the villagers use there burning brands to torch the monster?

""The Mummy's Ghost"" begins with a new high priest; he will travel to Mapleton to reanimate Klaris with tanna leaves so Princess Ananka can be returned for proper burial in Egypt. What will happen when the Princess arrives in the swamp? Will the plans go awry?

""The Mummy's Curse"" takes place in the swamps of Louisiana. [What happened to Mapleton, that pleasant New England town?] Klaris is once again sent to rescue Princess Ananka. Will she resist this rescue? [How were they buried in the swamp?] Will swamp water create a miraculous do-over on a muddy mummy? This was the last of the 1940s mummy movies. Wonder why?",1313107200,,2144,4.8469945355191255
