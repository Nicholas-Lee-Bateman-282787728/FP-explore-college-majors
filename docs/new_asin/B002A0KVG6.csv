8358895,1,B002A0KVG6,"This movie is so bottomlessly bad, it's beyond cringe-worthy. A convoluted and barely intelligible plot, acting way below highschool drama class level, a ""western town"" location that screams ""cheap fake"" with everything it has... I could go on.  Compared to this,  Uwe Boll is a veritable Pasolini.",1486684800,,298,5.319148936170213
8358896,3,B002A0KVG6,"Cinematography : good. Musical score : good. Props and costumes : good. Violence : good. Bad guys : good.  Acting : Let me tell you about the acting. Think daytime TV soap opera, where there are no rehearsals and the acting is suppressed by the actors struggling to remember their lines, to the point of losing the thread of the intended emotional flow of the scene, and maybe ad libbing now and then, and in so doing, in this case, losing the vernacular of cowboys and using phrases like ""Do you REALLY think"", etc. It's as if someone injected botox into the movie and it lost details of expressiveness because of paralyzed face muscles. For long stretches, you really need that cinematography and musical score to remind you this is supposed to be a rough tough Western. The evil Sheriff and his evil deputy, the wily and unscrupulous creditor Our Hero is on a mission to pay back a debt to, and maybe the bartender all did passable jobs, but it makes you wonder how much good actors inspire less good actors, or not. Method Acting seems to be employed in a couple cases, but the rest feels like a school play. The reach doesn't exceed the grasp quite enough to make this a campy hoot, either, IMHO. I'm not sure watching this one while enjoying cocktails is enough. You'll need something stronger. A single $2 episode (Amazon video) of, say, 'Almost Human' has more drama than this effort, yet I forked over the $6 because I personally know the actor who played the sheriff's deputy, and I wanted to see him in action. He did fine, and I'm not just sucking up. It's everyone else's fault (well, most of em').Three stars for all the ""goods"" above.",1409702400,,1649,4.552188552188552
8358897,4,B002A0KVG6,"This is one of several new ""b"" movies in the western tradition. All very well made but without great studio back up on production. I throughly enjoyed watching this movie and bought another from the same studio. I love old traditionally made westerns.

The acting is great. The screne play is a little weak in places but over-lookable under the circumstances. If you're a western fan buy it. I guarantee you'll love it.",1299974400,7,419,4.739726027397261
