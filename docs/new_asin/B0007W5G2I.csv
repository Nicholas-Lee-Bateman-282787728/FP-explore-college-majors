2246097,5,B0007W5G2I,"Ann Baxter gets to do her hallmark emoting, as a mentally disturbed houseguest. All of the players are very good: Ralph Bellamy as the unstable artist, Margaret Hamilton and Percy Kilbride are very good in their roles as characters. She is a houskeeper with high morals and he is the father of the young doctor who is betrothed to the houseguest. The houseguest cannot seem to figure out what man in the story she is in love with, and plays a 78 rpm over and over again while plotting to throw over her fiance and zoom in on the artist.  The music grates on the nerves of the other house members.  She tires often, has cardiac complaints and generates sympathy.  She uses the artist's young daughter, and draws her in, until the girl is as much of a hypochondriac and nut job as the houseguest.  Ms. Baxter plays the part well as she weaves her webs of deceit. We get to see a young and beautiful Ruth Warrick (All My Children) outsmart the vermin in her household, and regain the love, attention and affection of her artist husband, and save her young daughter--IN THE NICK OF TIME.",1353196800,,1083,4.482233502538071
2246098,3,B0007W5G2I,"For all its shortcomings (amply pointed out by reviewers here), I enjoy this modest little psychodrama and put it in the category of 'guilty pleasure' alongside similarly themed films of the period such as John Stahl's 'Leave Her to Heaven' and Edgar Ulmer's 'Strange Woman.'  All three deal with treacherous, mentally disturbed (perhaps) women and the chaos they inflict (slyly using victimology as a primary weapon) upon those who try to care for them; all are nicely photographed and well-acted; and all are forgivably obtuse in their application of 'modern' psychology.  But who cares?  Fun is fun, political incorrectness and all, and watching the bad seed get his due rewards is just as satisfying when it's a woman as when it's a man (now that's sex equality!).  The unfortunate news is that, contrary to Amazon's claim and the information on the packaging, Synergy's print is the 100-minute, abbreviated version of the movie transferred from the same heavily damaged source as all the other public-domain copies I've seen.  'Guest in the House' in its short form earns 3-plus stars, presentation a lowly 2-minus.",1346198400,7,1120,5.131868131868132
2246099,1,B0007W5G2I,"Anne Baxter has always been one of my favorite actresses, but I'm so disappointed in the plot of this story. One of my favorite's of hers' is ""One Desire"" with Rock Hudson and Natalie Wood. I haven't been able to locate a VHS or DVD of that movie. That one is really a good story!

2246100,2,B0007W5G2I,"The big problem with this film is the big problem with people - most see only in terms of black and white.  Baxter is presented as evil personified and all the other characters as pure, innocent beings who fall victim to her coniving, when in fact, they are all more than ready to believe the worst about Bellamy and McDonald, who, in fact, are not innocent - come on, a live-in model with the body of McDonald and our Vargas-like ""artist"" beyond suspicion behind closed doors?  The psychology here would have made for a movie with some depth (which it likely had in the original play), but Hollywood dumbed it down for the simple minded evil vrs bad audience.",1215907200,2,660,4.53781512605042
2246101,4,B0007W5G2I,"What a great and very creepy melodrama! I had thought that Brahm was mainly a movie director but he seems to have gone into TV in the 50s and never looked back. Ralph Bellamy (I can't watch him without thinking of his role as Dr Saperstein in Rosemary's Baby) is just great, as is Anne Baxter, of course.

The quality on that disc is terrible but watchable, so I'd be disappointed if the quality of this individual release wasn't better. If it is, it'll be well worth it. (Two other directors are credited. I just wonder who was responsible for some of the more unusual wide-angle and above-head shots at the end. In any case, the lighting is just great.)",1204934400,2,903,5.550724637681159
2246102,2,B0007W5G2I,"""Guest in the House"" belongs to that period in which Hollywood discovered Freud and produced such films as ""Spellbound"" and ""Shadow of a Doubt.""  But unlike those films, here the Freud is watered down to grade-school level, beginning with another unprofessional shrink who falls in love with the patient.

""Guest in the House"" also belongs to the evil-woman sub-genre of Film Noir.  The men are generally clueless, easily duped, even stupid, while the women are the real forces in the narrative. As the titular heroine, Anne Baxter's Evelyn is cousin to Merle Oberon in ""Temptation,"" Joan Fontaine in ""Ivy,"" Ann Todd in ""Madeleine,"" and Susan Peters in ""The Sign of the Ram.""  There's one major difference: while the others gave restrained performances, Baxter wildly overacted.  One hesitates to blame Baxter since she  more than demonstrated her abilities in such films as ""The Magnificent Ambersons,"" ""The Razor's Edge,"" and ""All About Eve,"" but here she is way over the top.  The fault must lie with the director or directors who seem to have given her no help at all, but then, the film had a troubled production history, with at least three directors and as many screenwriters having a hand in it.

Also in the cast are Ralph Bellamy, Ruth Warrick, Margaret Hamilton, Percy Kilbride, and Marie ""The Body"" McDonald. The latter would have done better to spend her money on acting lessons rather than self-promotion

Perhaps the real problem is that the film is studio or stage bound.  Since ""Guest in the House"" is based on a play, you might expect it to have been opened out when it made the transition to film, but except for a few very brief outdoor scenes, the film is all interiors. Evelyn's comeuppance, for instance, is revealed only in a reaction shot by Aunt Martha (Aline MacMahon).  Still, if you remember the film from childhood or the airing a decade or so ago on the Nostalgia Channel, you'll probably stick with it to the end despite the full plate of ham.

The new Alpha Home Entertainment DVD of ""Guest in the House"" is a DVD which one settles for as the only available version, rather than one which is welcomed with joy. It is a mangled 96+ minute version rather then the full 121 minute original.  The clarity of the images is acceptable, but there are so many cuts and splices that the film jumps and lurches from shot to shot and scene to scene as if the editor had gone mad while working.  As a result the whole film, including the often brilliant black-and-white photography of Lee Garmes, suffers

And someone should have told Alpha Video that it's Anne Baxter and not Ann Baxter.",1137888000,22,2609,4.741150442477876

2246122,3,B0007W5G2I,"This is an interesting film, though a bit stretched in the plausibility category.  Anne Baxter plays a mentally ill woman who is also a very manipulative person-----and this is where the ""stretch"" comes in.  A basically happy family is torn apart because Anne Baxter has arrived, and with her beau no less who is a member of this New England family.  Nonetheless, and without giving away too much, it is still a film worth viewing because Baxter was a great actress with a great voice and she does her ""bit"" here.  So do others, especially Marie MacDonald (""the body"") who gives a very credible performance as well.  Overall, it's a dark, somber theme that permeates the film, but then this is part of its charm.  In other words, even though deficiencies exist (if you view it you will certainly see them, including Ralph Bellamy's character being too simplistic), it's still a film worth watching.",1438819200,,898,4.798701298701299

A young psychiatric doctor falls in love with a patient and brings her home to meet his family, believing that living with a stable family unit will complete her treatment. FIRST OFF, bringing a mental patient among stable people and laying the burden on them to bring her around is the height of foolishness, to put it lightly. SECOND, AND MOST IMPORTANT, I don't know how things were in the 40's, but nowadays if a doctor gets romantically involved with a patient he would richly deserve to be stripped of his license. Aside from all that this movie isn't bad. The young woman lays the seeds for disharmony and mistrust, then sits back innocently and watches her rotten harvest start to take off and grow. The film is two hours long but it doesn't bore. I ordered the RetroFlix DVD-R from Movies Unlimited. The quality is not perfect. I don't know how the quality of the Alpha DVD release is.

He goes out with this blonde bombshell and gets drunk with her, comes home late, and wonders why his wife is annoyed with his behavior!

Great performances by key actors! As other reviewers noted, I would also like to have had a more visual ending.

I have purchased DVDs from this company that have fine video and audio quality, but ""Guest in the House"" is not good in either category. The video must have come from a VHS tape because of the lines, blurriness and bleeding. The black-and-white contrast is awful---nothing can be discerned in the blacks on the screen; they are solid black. It's difficult to tell what's going on in several scenes because they are just black. The movie itself (no fault of Nostalgia Family, of course!) is not so great. The premise for a great psychological thriller is there, but the director and cast just can't bring it off (no help from the script, either). Anne Baxter is ""Evelyn"" here, and is not nearly as believable as she will be six years later as ""Eve"" in the eponymous ""All About Eve"" that is definitely a classic.

Anne Baxter limbering up for her future name-making evil-woman performance in 'All About Eve'.

Interesting supporting cast including Margaret 'Wicked Witch' Hamilton, Ruth 'Phoebe Tyler/All My Children' Warrick, the much underappreciated Ralph Bellamy and Jerome Cowan, academy-award nominee Aline McMahon, and the tragic Marilyn-Monroesque Marie 'The Body' McDonald.
