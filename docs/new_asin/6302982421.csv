7833224,4,6302982421,"This plays like an Eric Rohmer film - a wordy romance about complicated young love.  It also replays Truffaut's 'Jules et Jim' menage-a-trois scenario, with the heroes called Jack and Joseph.  The difference being the film's implicit feminist  bite, which centres its heroine's sense of fragmentation and imprisonment, rather than her lovers' reaction to it; and in its creation of a nocturnal dream space.  The division of the characters between night and day (each lover, a taxi driver, works at these times) is marked in the divisions of space and architecture, as well as the characters.  Paris, empty, suspended, eerie, is like something from a Surrealist reverie.",982713600,5,669,5.214953271028038
