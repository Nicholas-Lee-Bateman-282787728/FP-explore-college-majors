2604771,5,B000GD85JE,"My grandfather used to tell me about Wee Willie Keeler who was a remarkable hitter, whose advice to hitters was, ""Keep your eye clear, and hit 'em where they ain't"" -- ""they"" being the opposing fielders. If Keeler had seen HITTING DRILLS & TECHNIQUES, he might have felt like he was swinging a tennis racquet. Well, Keeler is gone but if you have sons in Little League or daughters in softball, this video will not only raise their batting average but their love of the game will increase. I've never seen hitting explained in such a simple and common sense way. Tell your kids, it's not the bat, and view this program. If you practice the techniques in this program and do the drills, a .400 average will not be too far off.
EXCELLENT BASEBALL HITTING TIPS!",1246579200,4,758,4.54014598540146
2604772,5,B000GD85JE,"Finally a hitting resource my 40 year old brain can actually
understand and convey the info to my 10 year old. Just about everything in this DVD makes sense. Hitting has been described as the most difficult skill to do in sports. Unlike a surgeon, a success rate of 3 out of 10 is real good. I'd give this video by Marty Schupak with the help of Bobby Woods a 9.5 out of 10. I'll check back in two years when my son is 12 and we had two full years to reinforce the hitting concepts shown in this program.
THIS DVD DELIVERS!",1246492800,2,523,4.087378640776699
2604773,5,B000GD85JE,"You may not bat 1000 with HITTING DRILLS & TECHNIQUES but your Little League team (and son or daughter) will definitely improve with the tips given in this wonderful easy to understand instructional video. Marty Schupak brings in Bobby Woods a long time but little known hitting instructor who has a cult like following. Woods'techniques such as limit the length of your front step to avoid excess movement of the head makes all the sense in the world. We tried most of the stuff in this program and have seen great improvement. Combined techniques with great drills by Marty Schupak make this a ""buy"". Woods & Schupak will never get the acclaim that Charlie Lau or Ted Williams have, but their simple approach works. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!",1243382400,,746,4.881889763779528
2604774,5,B000GD85JE,"In the past 2 years I have gotten every video and read EVERYTHING there is to read on the subject of hitting preparing to teach my son and while I tell you that in virtually each and every resource there exists some gem that you can apply to help increase chances of success, THIS VIDEO is the definitive work on hitting. Becoming a good hitter does not mean picking up a bat and taking a few swings. It starts before you ever get to the ballpark. Nationally known sports video producer Marty Schupak brings in Bobby Woods to share his techniques about hitting. The simplicity of Wood's explanations are incredible! For instance, if a hitter steps too far with his front foot, the head can move a good 4-8 inches decreasing the chances of making contact. His theory that a ""relaxed hitter is a dangerous hitter"" is a perfect philosophy for youth players. And he gives great tips on how to relax. Combining Wood's theories with Schupak's creative drills keeps you interested in the video.  In hitting, being successful 3 out of 10 times might actually get you into the Hall of Fame.  The video emphasizes that practice and quality repetitions will give you the best chance to succeed. This video is a bargain. IT IS BY FAR THE BEST RESOURCE I HAVE GOTTEN ON BASEBALL OR SOFTBALL HITTING!
