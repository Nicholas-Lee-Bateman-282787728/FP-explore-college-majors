8289227,2,B001CU5NZ4,"I found this video to be painfully slow.  There was no sound (except on the long musical openings) and the quality was as if someone downloaded it onto a DVD from a VHS.  Since the quality of the DVD was so poor you could barely make out the woman's hands while she was signing. I couldn't watch all of it, but what I did watch was useless. The woman doing the signs was standing in front of a wall singing; that's it (remember bad quality).  No closeup of the hands, no repetition, no shots of the hands from different angles...  Don't waste your money like I did.",1257552000,2,565,4.252336448598131
8289228,4,B001CU5NZ4,"I don't know what I expected, but it's okay.  These are just some signs you could pick up in the dictionary, from instructors, or other Deaf people you chat with.  That is if you are an ASL student or interpreter you would be exposed to this. But, it does give you a visual when you are not around other Deaf people or taking a class, and is better than a book I suppose.",1249430400,2,371,4.068493150684931
