7491217,5,B0177ZM3I2,"this is the boxset we all have been waiting for.
it has every film on their own discs
the only film thats not unrated is the bad grandpa.
so hopefully if this set gets a blu-ray release it will include the unrated cut
only 12 bucks is not bad for all 7 movies.",1478131200,3,260,3.9245283018867925
7491218,5,B0177ZM3I2,Great if you like men doing crazy stupid stunts to themselves. My son loves this kind of humor. I do not.  Makes me hurt.,1516838400,,121,4.041666666666667
7491219,3,B0177ZM3I2,"I love the movies, but the case was broken when it arrived.",1516579200,,59,4.0
7491220,4,B0177ZM3I2,"This is a great way to purchase all of the Jackass movies unrated plus the Bad Grandpa films unrated.

The movies contain all of the extra features that the standard releases had.  The unrated versions of the films are typically about 3-5 minutes longer.  They mostly contain extra graphic nudity, or situations involving graphic body fluids.  If you like Jackass, these are enjoyable.  If you don't like it, these will be torture.  The nice thing about the movies is that the language is in tact without constant censoring.  Be prepared for tons of profanity, some intense or violent situations, and male full frontal nudity.",1513641600,,626,4.961538461538462
7491221,5,B0177ZM3I2,Wow all the movies at a great price really good deal,1512432000,,52,3.8181818181818183
7491222,5,B0177ZM3I2,Picked this collection up for $11.99.  Darn good deal for all the flicks (I'm not a fan of the Grandpa stuff but it's a bonus) and you get all the .5 versions of the films too.  These also ripped from the disc to a thumb drive for Roku player use just fine without any ridiculous DRM garbage attached that I can tell.,1506988800,,317,4.096774193548387
7491223,5,B0177ZM3I2,"What's not to love?

This set gave me everything I wanted and more.

It's too bad my impulse finger bought almost everything that's in these versions before it came out. But I love Jackass and love all the extras that you might not see anywhere, on any other versions, that were released before. I have no problem dropping $20 bucks to watch these guys. I dunno, the series is so screwed up thanks to MTV dildos and the guys that run Jackass are so ass-hatted they don't know what's going on either (they would most likely admit to this as well).

I like that it's all in 1 big set and I can keep it all together. My Jackass album is now absurd.

I would buy this just to play it at a party as a background video for fun. 100% worth it.",1506211200,4,736,4.125874125874126
