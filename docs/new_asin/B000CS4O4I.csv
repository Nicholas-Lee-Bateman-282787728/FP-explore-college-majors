I love that they each have their own style and feel ambitious each time I watch it !
In California !",1355788800,,162,4.258064516129032
8101513,4,B000CS4O4I,"Not quite what I was expecting but still a good flick!  Maybe I don't know what I expected but this seemed a little more spartan and sanitary than other women's surf vidz I'd seen before.  Made up of various interviews entwined with random footage - all of which were well shot and thought out.  I was kinda bummed to see so much of the film with ladies poured into their wetsuits.  Don't get me wrong - not a 'perv' or anything like that but most will admit that wetsuits aren't that glamorous and if I remember correctly the purpose of such videos is to promote the glamorous and exotic sport of the ""Ali'i""...other than that, I enjoyed the production.  I really liked the fact that the interviews were peer oriented with the gals sharing how they felt about the various other ladies in the video.",1302825600,,799,4.482758620689655
8101514,4,B000CS4O4I,"I bought this for my daughter who's 12 and loves to surf. She is on her surf team at school and they always watch surfing DVD's. For Christmas she wanted one with girls, especially long boarding since that's what she does. Well this DVD is awesome. Local waves all along the So Cal Coast. Great interviews with all the girls. Shows lots of styles and is very entertaining. Finally another great DVD that features girls. It rips!!",1232150400,5,429,4.584415584415584
8101515,5,B000CS4O4I,"This is a great video, and I have watched it quite a few times.  The surfing styles are so different - from the hard charging Kim Hamrock to the effortless grace of Ashley Lloyd.  I've surfed with and met a couple of the ladies featured in this video, and they're just as cool and laid back in real life.

I'm someone who enjoys the hard rocking soundtrack in other surf vids, but I really like the mellow soundtrack here - my favorite track is ""I think I'll go down to the ocean"".  Sometimes I leave the DVD on just for the music.

If there's anything I'd change it would be to make it longer and add a few more shortboarders!  :)  But it is definitely a good video as is.",1226880000,2,673,4.130769230769231
8101516,4,B000CS4O4I,"good surf, good waves, beautiful surfers on the nose but....turn off the volume and watch this video whith another soundtrack 'cause the dvd's soundtrack is terrible. R. Lehrer & P.Katz use the same music in every movie  they made. try with jazz. However this is an amazing surf movie.",1168300800,2,285,4.816326530612245
8101517,5,B000CS4O4I,"I would highly reccomend this DvD to both men and women alike. It is able to capture the growing wave of enthusiasm, spirit, and energy in women's longboarding and surfing in general. It brings together some of the most talented women in the sport, with interviews in which each one shows their support and interest for their fellow surfer. One comes to understand that beyond the competition and drive to be the best, these women are friends before anything, and this is evident both in the water and to those who feel drawn to be a part of this ""new era."" The footage is of extremely high quality, with a beautiful section of waves captured on film from particular popular breaks. The music has been carefully selected, and compliments each scene perfectly. Unlike some other surf videos, you won't want to skip through sections and chapters, rather, you will want to sit and watch Girls Rip from start to finish.",1155600000,,915,4.725
8101518,5,B000CS4O4I,"I would highly recomment Girls Rip. Great photography plus interviews that help you get to know these talented women a little better. The music complements the whole feel of the movie which is very positive and for lack of a better expression, user friendly. It's also got me repumped about noseriding. These girls are smooothe...definitely worth the

price of admission",1153958400,,370,5.166666666666667
8101519,5,B000CS4O4I,"Girls Rip is definitely one of my new favorite longboard movies. It's filmed and narrated in a whole new way thats super fun to watch. It has some of the most talented women longboarders to date and some pretty good wipe outs. Not only does it let you watch the girls style and surfing, but you hear from other girls about the certian surfer, so you get to know them a little more. I love this movie and i highly recommend it to anyone and everyone in and out if the surfing community!!",1141948800,5,486,4.236559139784946
8101520,5,B000CS4O4I,"Girls Rip is a great movie for not only the growing women longboard population, but for anyone who enjoys watching pure talent and grace coming from some of the best women longboarders in the world. With footage from all over California and some of the most famous surf spots around the world, Girls Rip shows the growing sport of women's surfing in a new way with progressive and classic longboarding. With clips of more famous surfers showed along with up and coming girls, the movie shows current surfing and the future of the sport. I would definitely recommend it to not only surfers, but anyone who likes a great movie with great music and great stars.",1140048000,4,658,4.681034482758621
8101521,5,B000CS4O4I,"In an era of DVDs focused on either radical aerial maneuvers or Monster Waves it is refreshing to see someone take a risk and put something out that breaks the mold.

With ""Girls Rip"" the camera (and microphone) is focused on women longboarders who truly rip and for once get to hear their opinions (admittedly unrehearsed) of their peers and themselves. This is not an artsy, soft focus video like you might expect with the main subject being women. The guys from Burnt Toast Productions have always delivered the goods for longboarders and this is no exception.

The footage is shot from Swami's north to Santa Cruz and covers nearly all of the up-and-coming women as well as the Pros you would expect. The soundtrack is upbeat surf music (another break from the death metal soundtracks on most surf vids) with a couple of Burnt Toast standards like ""Ocean"".

It seems to be all new footage with exceptional clips of Rincon, Swami's, Secos and Malibu. The style and grace displayed by Carla Rowland, Julie Cox, Schuyler McFerran and Kassia Meador is something that all will appreciate.

This video is a must-have for anyone who appreciates great longboarding, but especially women who surf and those who want to give a great gift to the female longboarders in their lives.",1139529600,9,1274,4.830275229357798
