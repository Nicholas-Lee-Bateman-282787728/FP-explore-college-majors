3724841,4,B001NYIHSY,I really like working out to this DVD.  I think that it is a little challenging to learn the steps but once you do the workout is a lot of fun.  I especially like the 25 min express workouts and find them fun to do in the morning before work.  I really sweat and can feel results.  I love the firm workouts.,1268524800,,307,3.903225806451613
3724842,5,B001NYIHSY,"I'm a long time Firm fan. This is a really fun and thorough cardio work-out. The dance moves, once learned, are fun and energetic ~ you just have to remember these are dance steps and every step is counted out (in your head) mostly in 4-count. Once you have that, you're almost there.
This is a great workout on the days you've indulged in those potlucks at work. & you don't even have to be a graceful. I absolutely recommend this DVD,for fitness and for the fun!",1268438400,2,464,4.344827586206897
3724843,5,B001NYIHSY,"I understand why other reviewers were frustrated because the instructions and prompts in this video aren't very good.  It took me 2-3 times before I got the hang of the routine.  However, I think the dances are great fun and provide a fantanstic, challenging workout.  As a matter of fact, now that I know the steps, I appreciate that the video spends little time on instructions and goes right to work.",1265414400,3,403,4.647887323943662
3724844,1,B001NYIHSY,This video is best for those more interested in dancing than in getting an aerobic workout. The routines are overly complicated and it's difficult to get a good heart rate going. I've been doing aerobics longer than Alison has been alive and have amassed a huge library of aerobics videos; this is my least favorite.  I'm so disappointed in this particular installment of The Firm videos that I'm going to donate my copy to the local library.,1265241600,,442,4.740259740259741
3724845,2,B001NYIHSY,"I bought this video because I wanted to try something different from step aerobics.  I've been exercising for years and pick up steps fairly quickly.  With this DVD, however, the instructor did not give great cues and changed things up too fast.  I couldn't follow the routine.  I got very frustrated because I wasn't even breaking a sweat.  Consequently, I got my jump rope out and just started doing my own thing.  What a waste of money and time.",1256342400,3,448,4.6075949367088604
3724846,5,B001NYIHSY,"I love Alison Davis's workouts; especially this one.  She gives good instructions, though it may still take a few runs-through to catch all the steps.  But while you're concentrating on learning what comes next you forget about how hard you're working.  Before you know it you've had a great cardio workout!  The dance steps are a nice change from typical aerobic moves.  This DVD adds great variety to your routine.  Buy it!",1244505600,,425,4.833333333333333
3724847,1,B001NYIHSY,"This is the same DVD as ""cardio dance fusion"". It's a good video, but I already had it under the old title and just wasted the money on a second copy. Don't be fooled!",1242518400,28,167,3.9411764705882355
3724848,4,B001NYIHSY,"I did enjoy the dancing, but I had to stop at the modern section because it just got a little intense on the knees. It's sad, because I'm a former dancer. There are better, less joint-stressing moves in the same category of dance that would have worked out. Maybe later.",1411344000,,270,4.42
3724849,4,B001NYIHSY,This workout is not easy I will say that much! you definitely have to have some stamina to keep up with Alison because some of the dances are fast-passed and it can be difficult to keep up! still a fun one to do but get ready to sweat your buns off!,1398556800,,249,3.9019607843137254
3724850,2,B001NYIHSY,"For the most part this is a good cardio workout it does get your heart pumping.  But it is disappointing that the firm has released a workout like this.  I am a firm follower for years and have DVD's and classic VHS of all sorts from cardio, to step aerobics to resistance, so I can classify myself as one flexible person.  But this workout, what happen?? Sure after 3 to 4 workouts you will get it and you will be in sync with the workout, but here is my point, when you have a good master instructor cueing you prior to a move change, it allows the person the time to exert themselves harder and more vigorously to make those moves and while staying in sync with the workout and still having fun!! So yes cueing does count, it does matter, It does exemplify a ordinary to a knock out workout.  I will continue to use this DVD as a balance to my workout.",1393459200,,855,4.195121951219512
3724851,4,B001NYIHSY,"This DVD really gets you moving. I wanted to fall over after the first ten minutes. However, I thought I wouldn't be able to learn the moves since it is very fasted paced than the other Allison Davis DVDs, but that worry dissipated when I realized I already knew some of the moves from those other DVDs.",1379116800,,303,4.333333333333333
3724852,5,B001NYIHSY,This DVD arrived in excellent condition and pretty prompt.  It's a good cardio workout if you are looking for something different to spice things up.,1357084800,,149,4.96
3724853,5,B001NYIHSY,"This work out DVD is awsome. It does take a couple of times to get the steps, but once you do it's awesome. I heart rate is up, I am working up a big sweat, but I keep wanting more. It's fun!!! OH and I've only done this video 3x and I am already loosing weight and body fat. Fantastic.",1337904000,,286,3.783333333333333
3724854,2,B001NYIHSY,"I have done plenty of workouts from ""The Firm"" back in the day when they came on VHS so I was excited to pick up this one, specifically because I could do express workouts because some weeks there is just not enough time in the day.  I used to dance in HS and have done several other Cardio Dance routines with various DVDs so I know how to pick up routines and can do it quickly.  However this DVD is just frustrating because the editor decided to get cute and have all these close ups of the instructor and other people in the shot.  I don't need to see the instructor's face, I need to see her whole body, and would rather see it head on rather from the side.  The old VHS tapes had a much better editor, I could easily see the instructor and not have to guess at things.

It is interesting when doing the ""jive"" express work out, she calls it the Charleston but no dance or cardio class I have ever done does the Charleston the way she does it, what she does is easy enough to do but it is not the Charleston, this is why having a full view of the instructor is helpful. In the end because I paid good money for it I will keep doing the workouts, I should be able to do the routines on the first run through with out too many issues, but for this DVD that is not the case.  I don't expect to have them memorized after the first go around but I shouldn't need to do the routine 3-4 times before I ""get"" what is coming next.",1303257600,2,1426,4.021201413427562
3724855,5,B001NYIHSY,"This is one of my favorite dance workouts in my cardio rotation. It's definitely for someone familiar with dance workouts, not someone who is learning. That is what I want, it keeps up a good pace because there isn't so much emphasis on b reaking down the steps. These are familar  enough that you can pick them up easily if you regularly do dance workouts. It's highly energetic and fun, and the instructor is charming and a great dancer to emulate. PLus unlike other dance videos (Madonna Grimes) it's long enough to get the cardio benefits you seek on tyour cardio days. I'm also a big fan of Dance with Julianne- Cardio Ballroom, Dancing with the Stars- Dance off the Pounds; Core Rhythms also has some energetic longer dance workouts. Tracy Anderson's dance DVDs are fun but too high impact to keep doing. This DVD and the above named DVDS are good alternatives to TA if you're into dance workouts.",1298073600,,903,4.64375
3724856,1,B001NYIHSY,"I wish I had read the reviews before buying this!  One reviewer already pointed out that this is the exact same workout as Cardio Dance Fusion, just with a different cover and title.  I am disappointed that The Firm is so openly dishonest, greedy, and eager to fool their customers.",1296259200,,282,4.62
3724857,5,B001NYIHSY,Who knew that just moving without weights for 45 minutes can be such a good workout?  I sweat every time I use this video!  And the dance moves only took two tries to get them down.  This video is definitely worth the money!,1271116800,,224,4.162790697674419
8328345,3,B001NYIHSY,"A decent workout, but a little boring.",1506124800,,38,4.571428571428571
8328346,2,B001NYIHSY,"Same complaint as others - it's the same workout as one I already own, but this DVD simply has another name. Wish I would have read more of the other reviews before Buying. There's nothing in the description that would've helped know that this is the same workout",1486771200,,263,4.5
8328347,5,B001NYIHSY,Great as usual for The Firm.,1474934400,,28,3.8333333333333335
8328348,5,B001NYIHSY,Great dvd workout. Whether you want to do high or low impact and she gives great instructions on the dances,1467072000,,107,4.4
8328349,3,B001NYIHSY,Didn't love this workout. Kind of boring to be honest.,1441324800,,54,4.5
8328350,2,B001NYIHSY,"I've never disliked an aerobic DVD as much as this one. Don't get me wrong, I have other The Firm DVDs and I generally like them, but this one... I say skip it.

I don't know if it's the combination of the moves or the music or maybe both. Or the fact that it presents itself as a ""dance"" workout that can prepare you to show your moves on the dancefloor (hey! they did say it at the beginning of the video). It's reminiscent of an old VHS aerobic workout, imo. Like Jane Fonda workout before only this one is way less fun.

But two stars nonetheless because it does get your heart pumping. Good cardio, yes. Dance? Pick another DVD.",1435708800,,633,4.223140495867769
8328351,5,B001NYIHSY,"This video is so much fun and I was actually enjoying myself so much I was smiling while I was doing it! I found it a little fast in terms of following it, but Allison cues very well and by the second time doing it I didn't miss a step - highly recommend!",1433894400,,255,3.830188679245283
8328352,2,B001NYIHSY,"This is a 1980's style DVD. Not really a dance routine, but a decent aerobic workout.",1424476800,,85,4.375
8328353,5,B001NYIHSY,great!,1423958400,,6,6.0
8328354,5,B001NYIHSY,"Fun, fun, fun.  Love working out to this and it is easy to follow.",1423180800,,66,3.7142857142857144
