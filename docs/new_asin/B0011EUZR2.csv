8241560,5,B0011EUZR2,"This is a very good floor barre DVD, especially for those with a background in dance, floor barre, gymnastics, Pilates or yoga. However, someone who is new to those kinds of exercise techniques might find it odd or daunting. I am a semi-retired ballet teacher, and did floor barre for years--even a few classes from Zena Rommett herself. Therefore I can attest that this is an excellent example of her work. It is visually well-produced. There are eleven dancers in the ""class"", all from major ballet companies in the US. Zena leads the class. You really feel that you are right there in the class with Zena, as she occasionally stops to talk about the rationale behind a movement, corrects a dancer, or has a dancer demonstrate a concept. Her floor barre technique is very alignment based, in fact, it's about alignment primarily, rather than being about stretching, gaining strength, losing weight, or any of the things most exercise DVDs focus on. That said, if you do it correctly, and really listen to what she says, and watch the dancers, you will work very, very hard! Your body alignment and posture will improve gradually over time, and you will develop more flexibility and strength, but correctly, with long muscles and core strength that does not depend upon crunches or such. I bought this video because, in my sixties, I wanted something that I could do without aggravating past dance injuries, yet would help me work hard in depth. This really helps. I can't even get through the whole DVD yet, but I am slowly working up to it. Zena's tapes are probably not everyone's cup of tea, but for those who know their bodies, and want something effective, safe, and enjoyable, this is a fine out-of-the-mainstream approach.",1368057600,12,1731,4.831649831649831

8241562,1,B0011EUZR2,"I totally agree with the previous reviewer, this is a piece of self-promotional publicity of little practical use. If you want a floor barre DVD, the one by Maria Fay is much better.",1328140800,3,182,4.545454545454546
8241563,2,B0011EUZR2,"With all the hype, I was expecting an exceptional barre workout.  I injured my back and wanted to do barre work and thought it would be great - but it wasn't.  I found it slow and a waste of time.  The best part was Tommy Tune's interview, which was actually longer than the workout itself. I do not recommend this.",1277596800,9,315,4.216666666666667
