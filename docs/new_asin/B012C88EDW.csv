8725982,1,B012C88EDW,"This Blu-ray disc is useless to me , I bought it but it dosn't function in my country , It says on the blu-ray box that they are to function solely in America and Canada , There was NO notice about that in Amazon, so I have been tricked .

Picture is great.

8725991,5,B012C88EDW,"It's almost like the entire series in summary form.

If you've seen the original, it's Turtle King, followed by the Van Allen Belt arc, followed by Cross Caronemon.  Joe's history is tied together a bit better (so the puppy incident is excluded and the reason for what happens to him at the end ties into the bit with his parents).  I'm being intentionally vague so as not to spoil it for folk who haven't seen it.

I've you've seen the original, this is a nice quick run through it all.  If not, go see the original.  This will feel very rushed otherwise.  It's an amazing series that brought in the very first generation of American anime fans.",1464825600,4,646,4.47008547008547
