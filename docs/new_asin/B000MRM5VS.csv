8171562,5,B000MRM5VS,I am Scottish Christian and was unaware of our Nations history and the sacrifice of so many in Scotland. It is easy to be patriotic without seeing the bigger picture. Whoever rules governs. They who govern impose their will on the people. This DVD describes in colour and melody the price paid by those who loved their Saviour even more than their country. They chose the High King of Heaven and were not willing to bow down when made to choose between the King of England and the King of Heaven. I listen to the cd when I walk and often as I am in the highlands and lowlands of Scotland I weep tears for those who gave their everything for The Master. The songs are heavenly in composition and they tell a story of love poured out. The scenery is fantastic and the whole DVD is one to share with friends and loved ones.,1335744000,5,820,4.296774193548387

The DVD has some beautiful scenes of the Scotland, both the countryside (with running sheep!), and the city (I think it's Edinburgh). The music is very melodic, a combination of soft country with some Celtic drums, flutes, and strings. The songs were apparently inspired by the stories of the Covenanters, and are shot at some of the ruins associated with their persecution, including Bass rock. Remember that this is NOT a documentary. It doesn't tell the story of the Covenanters.
