The other two are (not surprisingly) are ""Oedipus the King"" and ""Oedipus at Colonus"". They are difficult to find, but worth the effort.",1481241600,,312,4.6909090909090905
8670815,5,B00M9012W4,"I saw this way back in the early, early 90's on A&E (I believe). Was shot on video and all on stage, but don't let that discourage you. The acting in this is top notch. I hope that this will become available in the near future. This is a must have if you love great acting.",1458691200,,273,3.892857142857143
