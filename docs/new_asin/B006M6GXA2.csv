8500615,5,B006M6GXA2,"John Miller is perhaps the finest of Stefan Grossman's hugely talented batch of instructors. As gifted a player as any among them, his teaching within the constraints of time - assembling a number of songs on a single DVD - is systematically presented, well organized, and well explained. The beauty of John Miller's presentation here as on other DVD's he's put together, is that he always honours the lyrics which go with the playing of the songs. If not always with the split screen version, he does so in the initial performances he plays. This is very helpful to see just how seamlessly he phrases the lyrics to go with the playing, as combining singing while playing is a separate skill and often very difficult (as Stefan has often pointed out.) As with all John Miller song selections, the singing is always very worthwhile to the fine tunes he takes the learner through. His tablature with accompanying regular musical notation is as clear and explanatory in presentation as any for indicating stroke direction and timing: not that Miller, expects the learner to religiously observe such matters as given measure lengths and stroke directions in all places of particular songs, as he mentions in places from time to time during his instruction. But the well presented tablature and regular notation is most useful for initial orientation.
Another very instructive Miller offering with fine tune selections.",1392768000,,1414,5.047008547008547
