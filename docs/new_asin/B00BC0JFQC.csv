8565588,3,B00BC0JFQC,"Not a terrible movie, but not great either. I watched this for Wu Chun, but the overall costumes and colors were very beautiful. I love romance movies, and Wu Chun did alright, He definitely feels like Quan in Hana Kimi. Charlene Choi was adorable albeit a bit exaggerated and slightly annoying, and Hu Ge played a handsome opposite to Wu Chun. The reason I gave this a three was that even though the plot was bearable, it was just really poorly paced. More screen time for longer meaningful interactions between Wu Chun and Charlene to grow their chemistry would've been great, instead, the romance felt rushed and stale. There were actions scenes, but most of them were sub par compared to the fight with Hu Ge and Louis Fan. I would dare to say that Louis' Fan's role in this although short was a great scene and held great weight. Harlem Yu was a joy and really fun to watch which makes me sad to give this movie such an avg rating. Overall not a bad movie, but it could have been more.",1457740800,2,990,4.415300546448087
