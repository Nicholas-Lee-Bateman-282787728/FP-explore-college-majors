8173211,5,B000MWTEQM,"If you are a history buff (like me) you will enjoy this movie.  It mixes historical events along with details about why the prision was built.  Hear about all the escape attempts & see interviews from former prisioners & guards.  My only regret is that it did not talk as much about the 1962 escape as I had hoped.  On the other hand, the historical info starts at the prision's 1934 begining.",1187308800,,393,4.416666666666667
