8399835,1,B003LUTEXU,I love the show but the poorly translated subtitles made the DVD unwatchable. It was like reading something that was put through google translate which made many of the subtitles gibberish.  We've watched the other seasons on DVD and they had issues here and there but this was almost constant and made the story impossible to follow.,1497916800,,334,4.859649122807017

8399837,3,B003LUTEXU,The drama was absolutely excellent but the English translation was abysmal.  I bought the DVDs because I loved the couple of episodes I watched on a internet streaming site.  I was so excited when I saw that Amazon carried English subtitled DVDs of the series because I do not understand Japanese.  But I was really severely disappointed; the English subtitles took up half the screen and the worst part was the translation was absolutely abysmal.  I felt Siri could have done a better job.  I am sorry for being so harsh but I was really severely disappointed.  My only consolation now is the thought that by buying the DVDs I am supporting the producers of the drama series.,1398816000,4,676,4.686440677966102
