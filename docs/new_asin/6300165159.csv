8362824,5,6300165159,"From the onset of this film, I knew there could be no other with as much ninjistic ultra [butt] whooping action.  Ninja Warriors possesses superb ninjistics on all fronts.  The inclusion of a meteorite along with numerous ghostly beings add a whole new dimension to the ninja field.  Never have the qualities of both the ninja and the supernatural as well as meteors been put together in such a masterful fashion.
Watch this amazingly ninjistic film now!",1026172800,3,454,4.87012987012987
