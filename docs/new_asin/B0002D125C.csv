This is not a challenging workout.  It might be ok for beginners, but not for anyone who is used to this type of exercise. The same money could be spent on a decent Tae Bo DVD.",1280188800,,331,3.984848484848485
8026470,5,B0002D125C,"OK, I will start by telling you what this DVD is not: it is not slick, it does not have that incredible buzzword, ""high production values,"" and it does not have a cast of hardbodies doing the workout.

What it IS is a good, instructive workout on kick boxing correctly and safely. I like Billy Blanks and Tae Bo, but Billy doesn't provide step by step, patient instruction as on this DVD.

Like I said, it's not a slick production, so if you must have that, this is definitely not for you.

But it's what I needed: a dvd with someone doing a lower impact workout along with instruction on doing the kicks/punches correctly.

Well done!!",1228176000,,636,4.456896551724138
8026471,5,B0002D125C,"Let me begin by saying this is the only workout video I have ever been able to both follow and stay interested in from begining to end.  It's cheezy as can be and keeps my friends and I entertained, working out and leaves us utterly exhausted.  Ditto the other comment on the how the video is layed out, the combinations, etc.  It's an exciting challenge and a great workout which is what I am looking for in a home video.",1224720000,,422,4.25
8026472,4,B0002D125C,"I have done each of the Cardio Athletic Kickbox workouts and also several others.  The No Holds Barred DVD challenges you with more advanced combinations, drills, and directions of strikes.  Just like in the other videos, each part of the combos which include kicks, punches, elbows and knees are broken down into simpler segments, then put together for the full advanced combination.  By the 2nd or 3rd time you do the workout you will be totally jammin.  For 30-40 minutes of Cardio, there is a lot of combinations and athletic drills packed into that time. If you are easily bored, the No Holds Barred DVD will keep your attention. The instructor did a segment where the group was circling around him while 2 others demonstrated high and low impact punching jacks in place. This was definitely the first time I have seen a segment like this on a home workout.  This workout is definitely for people looking for something fresh and also physically challenging.  As in the other Cardio Athletic Kickbox videos, the movements are modified for safety reasons, but are perfect for people like myself who workout at home. The DVD is also has chapters so you can go directly to the combo you want to do.  Plan on sweating and have fun with this DVD.",1092355200,7,1245,4.709677419354839
8026473,1,B0002D125C,"Being English I have seen my fair share of terrible exercise dvd's as Britain is the home of the bad exercise dvd.  However this is the worst piece of tat I have ever seen.  The instructor has no idea how to kick or punch and the routines are poorly constructed.  The other people in the DVD also have no technique whatsoever.  I bought this DVD as I have many of Billy Blanks taebo DVD's and also Kathy Smith's kickboxing workout, these are excellent workouts and I was hoping to build on my collection as the DVD promises to ""really get your adrenaline pumping"" and give you a ""dynamic workout"" I was sorely disappointed.  I can see no benefit whatsoever in using this DVD.",1092268800,19,675,4.455284552845528
