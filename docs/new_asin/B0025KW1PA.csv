Robert Andriani, known to his friends as Ziggy, sang like an angel and taught harmony from the chords of his guitar to his younger admirers.  His talent was eclipsed at an eary age by a mental illness that left him to live on the streets and eat out of garbage cans.  But those who were lucky enough to hear him in his prime were treated to something very special.  In todays modern world of technology where a machine can correct any error, he captivated his listeners with an effortless tenor devoid of falsetto and flawlessly clean and precise musicianship. His strength in recording was to work with sound, overdubbing every accompanying voice and basic instrumentation. He blended his playing of the melodica into his vocal backgrounds with a deftness that belied his lack of formal training.  He was self taught doing everything by ear with a gift of perfect pitch.  The film by Dennis Genovese is a touching tribute to his greatest mentor that we remember sadly,and fondly, as King Lonely the Blue.",1243209600,,1103,4.809523809523809
