8560586,5,B00B1CGFZA,"What an excellent movie!
I look for movies that can tell a story without resorting to over-the-top violence. This movie delivers!
Essentially, this movie tells the story of a murder from three different perspectives. This is done very well without explicit violence.
Additionally, while sexuality was part of the story I felt it was done tastefully without pandering to prurient interests.
The cultural sensibilities will probably keep this movie out of the standard American viewer's library, but I loved it.",1473465600,,509,5.375

8560589,4,B00B1CGFZA,"Excellent story, a lot like life as it depends on who's telling it. Multiple twist and turns, a life fable.",1405555200,,107,4.4
8560590,5,B00B1CGFZA,Very well crafted movies about buddhist thoughts. Good story line. Excellent acting especially the portrayal of the monk by the Asian superstar Mario Maurer at early stage of his career (after Love of Siam). Wonderful costumes and scenery.,1388448000,2,239,5.315789473684211
8560591,5,B00B1CGFZA,"Incredibly interesting and well made movie.  The premise of three different interpretations of the same event by three different people, all with something to gain is intriguing.  The young monk who is seeking the truth is very well played.  This is a quality movie that deserves a wide viewing.",1374624000,3,295,4.979591836734694
8560592,1,B00B1CGFZA,This movie was amateur hour at the box office. I can handle a technically poor low budget movie if the story line is solid. I would of suspected this movie coming from a entry level movie university class.,1374105600,,205,4.421052631578948

8560595,4,B00B1CGFZA,I expected this to be a grand martial arts movie with lots of action scenes. Instead I found a really well told story with lots to consider. Thoroughly enjoyable.,1366416000,13,162,4.620689655172414
