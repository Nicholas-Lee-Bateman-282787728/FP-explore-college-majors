8294559,5,B001DR5NBA,"Be prepared: This is not your typical belly dance video.  If you buy this DVD after watching mainstream videos giving instruction or workouts in Middle Eastern dance, and expect the same format/approach, you may find yourself disappointed or at a loss as to how to respond.  My suggestion: Buy this DVD with an open mind towards the true aesthetic of belly dace and not a watered-down, Americanized approach as applied in most mainstream videos of the same genre.  Once you have achieved this, you will experience the high art and beauty that is Belly Dance Stylistics!",1251763200,,569,4.90625
8294560,5,B001DR5NBA,"Belly Dance Stylistics brings to convergence those evocative, languid and distant elements of beauty found typically in far away lands. This instructional film employs a movement distillation process in the interest of crystal clarity for effective motion repetition by the student. The video instruction is televisually simplified by the use of studio blue-screen for motion isolation, as well as cinematic slow-motion for sustained movement comprehension. This technique alone makes this instructional video an exemplary educational tool.

The problem for advanced belly dancers is that this presentation might seem academic and slow-paced. It is designed for grasping the stylistic features of the belly dance as an art form. As a classically trained dancer I experienced the repetitions and the blue screen isolations as distilled fragments of the art form worthy of apprehension. In classical dance distilled movement is key.

For those ""bitching"" about this fine educational piece, zip and move on to other things to complain about. There are literally thousands of horrid products to keep you occupied. It is exactly the beauty of this video and the instructor, Hannah that fascinates and disturbs some critics among us. It is well documented that most critics LOVe the sound of their own voices in their own heads. Critique a work of art by pointing out its merits and then showing the faults only if you are clear about the constraints that govern the work. Otherwise, one sounds like a frustrated child.

Belly Dance Stylistics is perfect for students in whose gaze the stylistic isolates of the belly dance are of cardinal import.",1247529600,,1641,5.303846153846154
8294561,1,B001DR5NBA,"First 5 min is all pictures & about Hannah, the longest intro I'd ever seen.
Suddenly it goes into hand undulations, wrist circles, snake arms, head slides, vertical & horizontal figure 8, rib shifts to the side & then front & back to rib circles, hip circles & then straight to undulations up & then down, omnis (small hip circles), large hip circles & then putting a rib circle, roll down, hip circle, then roll up into one movement in 20 min.
Now, this is Hannah going slowly obviously one time, then the video is replayed over & over & again even in slow motion. A woman's voice over gives barely a sentence on how to do it, mostly saying ""like shown here."" What is said is helpful, but there is nowhere near enough. You only see Hannah's neck to top of the thighs except for even more close ups for head & arm movements, which doesn't help the beginner, because it's important to see what the knees & feet are doing. This makes it hard to practice & follow-along. The time spent on each movement is not long enough before moving on to the next one.
The last 20 min is taking the moves & putting them into a short choreography routine w/Hannah & two backup women on a stage. It is done by obviously again, the women did the routine once in front of a mirror, looking serious/dour & concentrating while watching their form. It plays bit of the routine a couple of times & in slow motion like the previous section, then plays the next bit. It's great they teach you a routine, but again, if they had a mirror, they should have shown it with them facing the mirror with the camera behind when introducing the routine so you can follow more easily like a real dance class.
As the other reviewer said, they have trays & they only mention to use a head scarf, nothing more.
They show Hannah & the two women dancing the routine again, this time smiling more & not staring at the mirror which they should have only used for the instructing of the routine.
They also show a cool walking sideways move so your body doesn't go up/down if you went sideways w/both heels up/both heels down. They do left one heel up/toes down, right heel down/toes up, right one heel up/toes down, left heel down/toes up, so you're pigeon toed, then toes facing out/heels touching, etc. They only show that w/a close up of her going one direction, then the other only, nothing more. This is not enough instruction since there was no verbal help and the feet were only shown from part of the recorded routine. It would have helped if she was facing away from the camera & because of this, I had trouble following.
Hannah is a wonderful dancer, very fluid, graceful & elegant, and what instruction she actually does say is helpful. She has great body awareness and knows body anatomy & terms. I would love for her to make another one, but with a different producer/director who put so much self-advertisement in the beginning and end, I thought it was more an advertisement for the company then a belly dance instruction. I feel sorry for Hannah.

Pros:
Hannah is a wonderful dancer, has great body awareness, anatomy, etc.
You can possibly learn a routine
Many basic bellydance moves are ""taught"" or shown

Cons:
Almost non-existent verbal instruction
Poor editing & use of slow-motion video repeatedly instead of real time instruction which feels cold/boring.
Even with the replays, there isn't enough time to practice before the next move is introduced, one should not have to keep REWing
Too close-up camera angle so you only see her chest and you cannot see rest of the body, so many will be lost.
Use of slow-motion does not replace longer recorded instruction, having the instructor go slower as they instruct is the proper way.

7/17/09 - I had added a clip to this review to show the great walking sideways w/o bringing both heels up, but I was emailed about copyright infringement though the clip was less 90 seconds. It showed good content I thought would help those on the fence about purchasing this product in a good way. I never claim that my opinion is same for everyone. Maybe the producer/director responsible for this program will show a trailer that customers can see to make their own choice. I wish they all did so which is slowly catching on. Trailers are not only for mainstream movies.

Also avoid her other dvd, ""Belly Dance for Teens Level 1"" because it uses the same director/studio. The studio or director has used obvious shrills to make it seem like this is a good production.",1247011200,,4479,4.567164179104478
8294562,1,B001DR5NBA,"What a waste of $25!  At only 45 min's, the dvd starts by showing a ton of pic's of Hannah in all sorts of poses. And then drags slowly through beginner moves and that's about it!  Then, they go over a following-the-bouncing-ball tray choreo without even going over balancing trays.  The title is somewhat misleading, as if I knew it was just another beginner dvd, and a bad one at that, I wouldn't have wasted my time and money.",1232409600,,429,4.405063291139241
