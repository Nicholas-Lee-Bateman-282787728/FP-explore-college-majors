7588169,4,B01A2J8758,This is a pretty fun set. There are quite a few fun trailers here with a few overly long dull ones. They are in rough shape as expected but they are presented well here. Good for putting on in the background during a party.,1454025600,4,223,4.090909090909091
7588170,4,B01A2J8758,"Pretty good trailer collection. For some reason, with the name and cover art I expected it to be more horror-centric, but It's all over the place as far as genres. Watching it over the course of a couple of nights, it seemed to be more exploitation focused than anything. Still cool overall though.",1453939200,6,298,4.6415094339622645

8746422,5,B01A2J8758,"The trailers found within ""Trailer Trauma"" are just terrific! Many of them I'd never seen before, and I own several trailer collections. It was surprisingly packed with movies way outside main stream. The Blu-Ray format does a great job of presenting the trailers clearly and crisply; but, does not sacrifice any of the grit and grain that makes grind house cinema recognizable. Add some wicked cool packaging and menu art as another feature. All in all it's a great value for somebody who loves movies despite the price. In fact, each selection in the ""Trailer Trauma"" collection (at the time there is 4 volumes) is well worth the money. GREAT BUY!",1514851200,2,649,4.8558558558558556
8746423,5,B01A2J8758,"The first installment of the Trailer Trauma series does not disappoint. While this is the shortest collection of the bunch, it is still well worth the price and has some of the rarest and most obscure trailers of the set. The great thing about this collection is that the 2nd half includes more genre trailers (kung fu, cars, westerns etc) and not just horror.

The absolute best thing about the collection is that the trailers are presented in their true quality and are not digitally tampered with. All the pops, tears, cigarette burns and audio tracks are perfectly imperfect. These Grindhouse trailers are meant to be seen in all their damaged glory, not like a Criterion release.",1512777600,3,684,4.846153846153846
8746424,5,B01A2J8758,Great service!!  Enjoyed the product!! The quality of this blue-ray Disk was great!!  And both the service and the speed of delivery was top notch.,1473206400,,147,4.84

8746426,4,B01A2J8758,"Very nice collection of trailers, the majority of which haven't been released on home video before. Around half the collection is made up of trailers for action and nudie exploitation flicks though, and I was really hoping for more horror, sci-fi and fantasy trailers instead. Still, the audio and video quality is excellent once you understand that the sources for most of these trailers aren't the cleanest or best kept prints even if they probably are the best available. If you collect trailer collections this one should be in your library.",1457913600,7,545,5.0
8746427,4,B01A2J8758,Nice collection. Ridiculously over-priced.,1456185600,4,42,9.75
8746428,5,B01A2J8758,"If you are obsessed with finding the unfindable, rare trailers of films unavailable on blu ray or even YouTube...this is the collection for you.

All these trailers seem to be restored, so I'm not sure what the other reviewer is talking about.",1455408000,7,243,4.785714285714286
8746429,5,B01A2J8758,As good as trailer compilations get. So much fun & excellent quality transfers / audio.,1454284800,3,87,4.866666666666666
