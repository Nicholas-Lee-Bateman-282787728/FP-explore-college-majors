530382,5,6302995930,"A great movie for USNA grads and Army/Navy football fans.  This movie gives a unique view of college football's greastest rivalry.  Plus, a young Jimmy Stewart is a bonus.
As for the ""praying to a statue"" scene mentioned by the other reviewer, it really happens.  Visit the Yard during Army Week and you might just see this for yourself.  As a 1995 graduate of USNA, I repeated ""that scene"" every year to do my part to ensure a Navy victory.
Maybe you have to be a former middie to get it, but this is a great movie.  Highly recommended and BEAT ARMY!",1034035200,12,551,4.362745098039215

530444,4,6302995930,"Of course I liked the movie. I am a graduate...not 1937...much later, but I enjoyed it most because of the authenticity of Naval terminology and uniforms and general accuracy of the depiction of Naval Academy life.",1432944000,,214,4.972222222222222

530446,5,6302995930,"What a wonderful film.  It's vintage, in the old style, but excellent performances all around. Really captures the feel and purpose of the Naval Academy.  Would not change a bit of it.  A film that should see more circulation today as it is a part of Americana.",1425427200,,261,4.51063829787234
530447,5,6302995930,Great story with classic actors,1425081600,,31,5.4
530448,5,6302995930,"This is one of the better military cadet type movies, very similar in some respects to the Duke of West Point. I like these types of movies mainly because I can relate to the traditional values when people had strong convictions for democracy and living a respectful and honorable life. If I had any control I would make this movie required viewing material for high school students.",1423958400,2,383,4.731343283582089
530449,4,6302995930,This is a good movie as well as torpedo run . Obviously in different context. James Stewart & Robert Young were excellent actors . All three guys from different walks of life befriend each other at the naval academy . They become teammates on the football team . I have watched four times already . Good flick.paulc.,1419984000,,316,4.56140350877193

530570,4,6302995930,This is an inspiring story about Naval Academy midshipmen facing crisis events early in life and successfully dealing with them. Read this book many years ago as a young teen and was greatly influenced by the positive characters of the protagonists.,1413417600,,249,5.097560975609756
530571,5,6302995930,Very good movie and another one with the great Jimmy Stewart who stole the show.  Lionel Barrymore great as always.,1411257600,,115,4.75

530578,5,6302995930,"Great movie with strong message still of significant value today.  Interesting to
see Naval Academy settings in the late Thirties.  Football shots are real ""throwbacks""
from the days before battering ram helmets with face cages.  Seeing the old single wing
football was fun.  As a USNA Alumni; I REALLY like this one !!",1390867200,,319,4.962264150943396
530579,4,6302995930,It is a fairly accurate (though dated) depiction of life at the Naval Academy.  Appears to have been filmed at least partially in Annapolis.,1385942400,,140,4.833333333333333

530669,4,6302995930,A look at Navy life from that of a midshipman.  Excellent acting provided by the characters in the story with a touch of a romantic side. Very uplifting.,1373673600,,153,4.464285714285714
530670,5,6302995930,"I used to watch this film every Christmas with my father and every year and every year we both say certain lines along with the movie. This is a delightful film, and I'm so glad I was able to find it.",1363305600,6,200,3.902439024390244
530671,5,6302995930,"We gave this to our families and got excellent reports back.  We love Jimmy Stewart movies and would put this as one of the best, well worth watching again.",1359504000,2,156,4.379310344827586
530672,5,6302995930,"I watched this movie with my great grandmother when I was probably around 10 years old and fell in love with it!  For years I have waited for it to be released on DVD, and I was not disappointed.  This is a wonderful film about friendship, loyalty and love.  I would recommend this film to just about anyone.",1357084800,5,308,4.275862068965517
530673,5,6302995930,"If you enjoy ""feel good"" movies with a military/Christmas/football theme this is a perfect fit for you! Filmed during a time of national innocence James Stewart and Robert Young deliver solid performances that offer a suggestion of their later greatness. Good views of the Naval Academy and its traditions add to the enjoyment of this film.",1355875200,5,340,5.089285714285714
530674,4,6302995930,"This film, along with ""A Yank at Oxford"" and ""A Yank at Eton,"" is an excellent example of the heart warming, patriotic films that became so popular in the Depression-WWII era. Centering on three buddies at a Naval academy, the film fosters the ideals of loyalty both to one's friends and one's country. The three main characters are all likable: Robert Young as the confident, amiable athlete, James Stewart in the type of role he made his own: the shy, working class everyman, and Samuel Hinds as a naive, unaffected young man of wealth. Though they seemingly have no similarties, they are bonded together by virtue of being freshmen and together, they ward off the practical jokes the upper classmen try to set up for them. Especially enjoyable are not only the scenes at the Naval academy but at the lovely society home of Samuel Hine's character. The scene between James Stewart and Samuel's sister in the film is particularly sweet. James Stewart gives his classic ""Ah, shucks"" type of performance, which makes him even more endearing to the girl who's sweet on him. James Stewart, all in all, is the scene stealer in this film. He's especially effective in a rousing scene when he defends his father, who was dishonorably discharged from the Navy. His speech is like a foreshadowing of the type of power he would later bring to the filibuster scene in ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."" The supporting cast is delightful in the film as well. Lionel Barrymore as a football coach and the lovely and always hilarious Billie Burke as Samuel Hind's flighty mother round out a satisfying, pleasant picture that takes viewers back to a proud and sincere America.",1295308800,7,1659,4.824561403508772
530675,5,6302995930,"I had lost hope of ever finding this video though I had taped a very poor version off the TV years ago.  I was so excitied to find a video available and it was in excellent condition and actually was delivered ahead of the promised time.  I had watched this movie as a little boy and dreamed about going to the Naval Academy.  Now, as a Naval Academy grad with two sons going there this movie was extra special to watch with them this Holiday season.  They thought it was corny -- but liked it just the same.  Highly recommend for any true Navy fan.  Liked it so much I bought two other copies.  A true classic.  Beat Army!",1265673600,11,623,4.176470588235294
530676,5,6302995930,"I caught the part where a young (no pun intended!)Robert Young
avenged his roomate's(Dick played by Tom Brown) tormenters, a few years ago. I bought the movie, watched the whole thing and I was not disappointed!! The three midshipmen meeting Skinny (played by Lionel Barrymore)and wins his admiration, is one event out of several, that I enjoyed. Truck (James Stewart)taking a risk to clear his father's name adds the family value to the movie. The scene at the Gates Christmas time is touching. Last but
definitly not least is Graves. At the Gate's estate and at the
football game. He is the true meaning of the term, gentleman's
gentleman!",1080691200,10,641,4.889908256880734

7833451,4,6302995930,"Great movie.  Sadly, not pressed, or burned on M-DISC

I completely understand that obscure movies like this may not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would have gladly paid a dollar or two more for a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.

This review is for the actual item I received from Amazon. If you are after a, ""pure movie review"", I suggest you look at the International Movie Database. There you will find many reviews without regard to the delivery mechanism.

This is a Great Movie.  The image quality is excellent. Humorous and well acted.",1519084800,,705,4.682926829268292

7833454,5,6302995930,"I've watched this picture for years and love the old school spirit type of movie that it is, which of course in today's movie offerings would be far too innocent to show.

7833456,5,6302995930,"Great movie, a little on the old fashioned melodramatic side, but certainly entertaining and inspirational, and emphasizes the history of uncompromising ethics at the Naval Academy ! It would be perfect with another prime movie ""The Duke of West Point"", both of which portray the history and culture of our service academies.",1465257600,,325,5.269230769230769
7833457,5,6302995930,We read the book out loud when I was in the 7th grade.  I looked for it often as I have never seen the film.  Didn't disappoint me and the cast was good except I think Barrymore was miscast.
