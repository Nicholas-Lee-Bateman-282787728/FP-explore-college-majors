2602686,5,B000G8NXXM,"I have both the live and pimp chronicles, which he tells some of the same jokes. however he tells alot that are different and its worth getting both of them. Everyone whom i invited over took turns roling around on my carpet. i loved especially the joke he told about the crazy baby mamma, and how not to let the kids stress you out. on that note we all reminised on our own childhoods which made it all personal. It was definitely different from other comedic approaches and I love this dvd.",1168300800,11,492,4.358695652173913

2602691,5,B000G8NXXM,"""In a triumphant return to his hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio, Williams brings the funny to a town that, at the time, was no laughing matter.

KWL starts out with a brief montage detailing the police-inflicted violence that plagued the city of Cincinnati when the concert was taped and a a radio interview with Williams that perfectly sets up the show.  Whether he's talking about spinner hubcaps that have to be spun manually, how the belief that eating your vegetables and drinking milk will help you grown tall is. . . ., or how he's molding his son to make pimp decisions at an early age, Katt takes the crowd's mind off of the city's tensions and has them rolling in the aisles. . .""Omar Mazariego XXL Magazine Sept 2006",1159574400,17,723,4.596899224806202
2602692,2,B000G8NXXM,"This is another Katt Williams DVD that I had the misfortune of sitting through.  Call me a hater if you want(which I'm sure you will), but dude is NOT funny.  His HBO special was worse than Mike Epps (who I happen to think is hilarious) and now all we need is for Chris Tucker (also hilarious) to lay an egg on HBO so the Friday Sidekick Circle can be complete. Not only is he corny, but Williams has been bleeding this ""pimp"" routine ever since his role on Friday After Next and it's getting -- no, scratch that -- it got old about 3 years ago. While his role in Friday After Next was somewhat funny, this DVD is totally unfunny. He may tell a joke here or there that might make you chuckle, but nothing here will make you laugh.

I have to ask though, was he doing these jokes BEFORE he did Friday After Next? Seriously, whether he was or wasn't, it's time for him to move on already, or at the very least, update his material.  Avoid this DVD if you can.",1159401600,5,957,4.1567567567567565

2602705,5,B000G8NXXM,"""Katt Williams Live"" is Katt Williams's FIRST Comedy Special.  You heard us!  His first!  It was filmed in downtown Cincinatti at the Taft right in the middle of Cincinatti's racial profiling boycott.  It's all on the video.  This is the original Katt Williams ala Richard Pryor.  You can also see KWL on Comedy Central.  Look at the ORIGINAL!  It's Katt Williams at his Best!",1315180800,,376,4.765625

I laugh at him just jumping around on stage like he does... especially when he gets laughing at himself, and he does!  This particular DVD was good, but not quite as good as The Pimp Ones.  I liked this and glad I got it for some of the material is different, but I LOVE the Pimp ones - I ordered those too.
If you want to laugh, and can laugh at everyone and everything, this is the guy!",1247616000,,511,3.980392156862745

2602709,3,B000G8NXXM,this is a must have for all Katt Williams fans although some of the dialog is repetative (pimp chronicles pt. 1) the delivery is pure comedy Katt is on point!!,1243123200,,159,4.333333333333333

This had about 98% the exact same material performed in front of a different audience and in full screen. So I found it to be a waste of money. It's one thing for comedians to repeat a joke or two as a filler an to repeat the same material for new audience, but to release it twice? What a way to screw us out our money!

The dvds were brand new and they got here so quickly.. quicker than the estimated date on regular delivery. So after that, I ordered more... american history x, King of queens seasons, and more...

2602717,4,B000G8NXXM,"First time I really paid attention to him was about 2 weeks ago when Comedy Central was airing this Live set. I came in on the middle and stayed since they keep showing encore information while watching. Man, I laughed soooooooooo hard I choked several times. I think my only disappointment was that his baseball cap was too low in his face and therefore you miss the very necessary facial expressions seen during his delivery. The camera operator did do just by trying to get some close-ups, but when this man is moving, he IS moving. He's all over the stage - literally. This is the second best of the DVD's containing added an Hometown racially charged moment that was taking place at the time of his arrival, his Proclamation from the city and his parents are featured too. With that bit of personal side added, you see he's not JUST a comedian but a force surely to be reckoned with. Not quite as funny as Pimp Chronicles Part 1 but not far from it either. I hope his (newer) material gets better and his hunger gets stronger. ""Where Funny Makes Money""!!",1196208000,2,1059,4.520833333333333
2602718,4,B000G8NXXM,"Katt Williams is one of the funniest cats in comedy right now. He has his own original presentations, he's just himself and that is a mess. He talks about everything you can think of and its real life stuff, stuff people experience or think of everyday and he make you laugh at the junk.  This comedy is hilarious, I had all my battle buddies laughing at this junk.",1192665600,2,365,4.367647058823529

I had to give it 3 stars because of KATT, but if u own the other DVD, pass on this one.",1184544000,2,258,3.709090909090909
2602721,4,B000G8NXXM,I had a ticket to see Katt Williams perform.  I had never heard any of his work so this dvd gave me an opportunity to get a flavor for his work.  The dvd was very good.,1181606400,,168,3.638888888888889
2602722,3,B000G8NXXM,"Unfortunately, I saw Katt's Pimp Chronicles on HBO first and fell in love with this comedian. The sharpest I've seen in a long time. So when I saw his Live, I was a bit disappointed because I was looking for it to be in the same vain. The comedy itself was unpolished as well as the style of the video. I am still a HUGE fan of his and will follow his career until the end. I'm giving this DVD a B- and Pimp Chronicles an A++.",1181260800,4,426,3.9080459770114944

Katt puts on a decent performance, older material. I'm still dying to watch the newer dvd. As far as the purchase, this dvd was in perfect condition and came to me in a very timely manner.",1170028800,2,437,4.2023809523809526
2602734,1,B000G8NXXM,"This DVD is almost the exact same routine that Katt did on his HBO special Pimp Chronicles, Part I.  The biggest difference is the overall production quality of this show.  The film is dark and is filmed at awkward distances that often make it difficult to even see him or get close-ups of his facial expressions, which are a big part of his comedy.  The jokes are almost identical to the ones he did on his HBO special.  I would recommend buying the HBO special for your collection and filing this one on your ""don't buy"" list.",1169510400,10,528,4.412371134020619
