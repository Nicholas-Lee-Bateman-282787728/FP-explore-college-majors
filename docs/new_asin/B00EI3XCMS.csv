5915130,5,B00EI3XCMS,Perfect !,1410134400,,9,4.0
5915131,4,B00EI3XCMS,"Great set but two minor issues.
One episode is missing so it's not the complete series. Also one episode has no dialogue just Background music.
Hopefully MGM notices this issue and fixes this release.",1406678400,6,200,4.911764705882353
5915132,5,B00EI3XCMS,This cartoon put the Bill & Ted movies into a cartoon series. In the series it still continue from the movie but now the two go traveling time to save other things in life.,1404345600,,172,4.088235294117647
5915133,5,B00EI3XCMS,"A blast from the past! Made a fantastic gift for someone who is very in to 90s memorabilia. It's missing a few episodes from the first season but I got this on sale for $5 so it was worth it,",1399593600,2,191,3.8
5915134,3,B00EI3XCMS,"The series itself is just all right, nothing spectacular, but it would have been nice to have the whole series on an extra disc.",1395532800,4,128,4.375
5915135,5,B00EI3XCMS,this is one of the best shows the 90's had to offer. Although disc 1 which has the first season that was aired on CBS is the most bodacious season. Disc 2 is okay  season 2 aired on FOX  and it doesn't really hold up compared to the first season. But still it is a most non non bogus tv show. I recommend this to any Wyld Stallyns fan (Air Guitar),1394668800,5,347,3.8732394366197185
5915136,5,B00EI3XCMS,"Classic memory, Awesome to see it again.  Will add this to the list of cool things I watched growing up.",1393286400,,104,4.2
5915137,4,B00EI3XCMS,Really good dvd I have always liked the bill and ted movies. If your a fan of the movies you will like this dvd.,1392249600,,112,3.7083333333333335
5915138,4,B00EI3XCMS,"Of course the episodes that are missing are from the totally excellent first season that had actors Keanu Reeves, Alex Winter and George Carlin voice their own characters, while the entire 8 episode ""bogus"" second season is complete on the second disc. I don't own this, this is just observation from the description. The five episodes that are missing from season one on the first disc are...

""Pocket Watch Full Of Miracles""
""This Babe Ruth ""Babe"" Is A Dude, Dude""
""Never The Twain Shall Meet""
""A Job, A Job - My Kingdom For A Job""
""A Grimm Story Of An Overdue Book""

I don't see why they couldn't add a third disc and slap on maybe $5 more for the set to make it complete. Oh well. Now if they would release the extremely bogus non non heinous live action series that'd be cool. Excellent! Party on dudes!",1376956800,24,808,4.452702702702703

5915144,3,B00EI3XCMS,"Well the reason I give it 3 stars is not because of the product or shipping or damage to the dvd or anything, it is just that I remember watching this when I was younger and I really liked the show but now as I am older it just isn't quite the same as I remembered lol It's not the series fault it's me haha I have kind of just out grew it I guess but still I'd recommend it to someone that has children because I am pretty sure any kid especially the boys would really like it.",1453680000,,478,3.8383838383838382

5915154,4,B00EI3XCMS,"Almost Excellent!
If the set was the complete series it would be five stars. But I believe it is missing four of the episodes. Either way this is just a fun cartoon.",1419897600,2,165,4.1875

8605485,3,B00EI3XCMS,Without reading the reviews it is not obvious that this is merely the second disc from the best of Bill and Ted's animated series I already owned. The show is good (if cheesy) but the title is misleading.,1477958400,,204,4.394736842105263
8605486,5,B00EI3XCMS,my 8yr loves them and it was a great introduction to the movies. Party on Dude,1475798400,,78,3.9375
8605487,2,B00EI3XCMS,"Bill & Ted, Beetlejuice, Ghostbusters, Back to the Future, Teen Wolf, somehow there is a generation of cartoons based on movies that weren't always aimed at children. Luckily, the movies were ran on television--sometimes edited. So children often knew the properties well enough to tune into these familiar movie-cartoons.

Bill & Ted was not the best of those movie to cartoon shows. Ghost Busters and Beetlejuice were both better. Bill & Ted fits in with Back to the Future and Teen Wolf.

If you want more from this world of characters, beyond the movies, then the comic books are a better place to explore.
This is an okay nostalgia buy but not as entertaining as you may remember.",1473897600,,685,4.796610169491525
