6137827,4,B00H7LRY5E,"The other reviewers pretty well said it all. This is an outstanding indie film that is better than a good many Hollywood productions in this genre that I've watched over the years. It's seriously intelligent, well acted and excellently directed. What more can I say, I really enjoyed it and highly recommend it.",1435968000,4,311,4.886792452830188
6137828,3,B00H7LRY5E,"Tentacle 8, which chronicles a CIA operative's experience as he is accused of treason and tortured, is an ambitious and complex undertaking for an indie film.  I admire the filmmaker's intelligence and his embrace of ambiguity.  The chronology of the story becomes tangled at one point, but the aim is high and admirable.",1402444800,3,321,5.037735849056604
6137829,4,B00H7LRY5E,"This is a movie which clearly takes its inspiration from John LeCarre.  Brett Rickaby is a compelling actor who leads this movie through its labryinth mysteries with a dignity and intelligence that brings much heart to a spy story.  I highly recommend watching it.  You will want to watch it with someone, because once it is over - you will want to pour yourself a glass of wine and spend the next two hours discussing it.",1401580800,3,422,4.526315789473684
6137830,4,B00H7LRY5E,"Brett Rickaby is one of the most believable actors of our time.  You will hang onto his every word and actions. This movie will have your mind racing to understand just what Agent Ray Berry is going through and what he knows. It is very complex, and thought provoking, and tho it is a work of fiction--does not mean it couldn't happen.  Joshua Morrow and Amy Motta, also give great performances, as does the entire cast. I must warn you that you must watch this film intently, and perhaps a second and/or third time--it is worth the time though.",1400803200,7,545,4.494949494949495
6137831,5,B00H7LRY5E,"It took a bit to understand this film, because the story is involved but what a great story it became. Loved the actors, no big stars but what a pleasure to see that.",1400198400,5,166,4.0606060606060606
6137832,5,B00H7LRY5E,Terrific film worth watching several times! Story loops in a highly intriguing way and it's all extremely entertaining. Great buy!,1398124800,5,130,5.55
6137833,5,B00H7LRY5E,"This is one of the best best Political Thrllers I have seen in many, many years.... way up with the likes of Z, John Frankenheimer's THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, DAY OF THE JACKAL, EXECUTIVE ACTION and THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR... it has the intllligence, the thrill and the feel of the later - but also the subtlety and nuanced of THE CONVERSATION, PARALLAX VIEW and TWILLIGHT'S LAST GLEAMING.
This movie is a must for anyone who loves the cinema!",1393200000,6,444,4.632911392405063
6137834,4,B00H7LRY5E,"I saw this film at a screening las summer and truly enjoyed it. There are few films that can keep me guessing throughout but this one did. Tentacle 8 is a terrific indie. It does require your full attention to follow the extremely complex plot. It is the kind of movie that leaves you thinking for weeks. As soon as I left the theater, I wanted to see it again, which is why I'll buy the DVD. Brett Rickaby, who is usually known for his work in the horror genre, gives a tremendous performance as the everyman/hero/protagonist. John Chi is a talented director, someone to watch for in the future. Tentacle 8 was made with a limited budget. With a larger budget, Chi could easily make an award-winning blockbuster.",1390867200,8,713,4.534883720930233

6137843,1,B00H7LRY5E,One actor could act...the director thought someone said let's watch paint dry. It is a total waste of time.,1448236800,,107,4.684210526315789
6137844,5,B00H7LRY5E,"4.5 stars but if I must round off, I will round up. Clearly a movie done on a tight budget, but I thought the characters were more believable because they seemed like regular people - not every Spy or FBI agent looks like Brad Pitt. No gunfights or car chases so if you demand Transformer-like action from your movies, this one is definitely not for you. This movie is mainly dialogue with several storylines weaving back and forth - I found the story to be interesting enough that I will watch a second time to hopefully answer a few more questions - that's more that I can say for the Terminator: Genisys movie.",1448150400,3,613,4.433628318584071
6137845,1,B00H7LRY5E,"Terrible waste of time.  I try to find any hacker and computer related movie that I can, which this one was on that list according to the discription.  Even though the description was wrong, the movie stunk.  I was extremely hard to follow, so much so that I really didn't know who was what, where and when.  I felt like the whole movie was so cryptic that the ""hacker"" portion of this movie was figuring out the story line, which I never really accomplished.  It took me days to watch it because I was bored with it not really getting to connect with any of the characters and not really following the story.

I feel like the movie wasted a couple hours of my time.",1448064000,,666,4.288

6137848,1,B00H7LRY5E,This movie was a tremendous waste of $4.00.  But an even bigger waste of two hours.  The only thing worse than the acting was the writing.  I could find more entertainment in watching my toilet flush.,1444521600,,200,4.5

6137852,3,B00H7LRY5E,Quite confusing as the time shifts forward and back throughout the movie. And to have the ending include a reference to the 50 year old Kennedy assassination as a decision factor is so ludicrous. Great potential but too confused in storytelling.,1442016000,2,245,5.0
6137853,1,B00H7LRY5E,I'm only giving it 1 star because I can't give it zero stars. What a disappointing mass of confusion. None of the dialogue or visuals connected to anything coherent or valuable.,1441756800,2,177,4.741935483870968

6137855,1,B00H7LRY5E,"I normally enjoy international intrigue but this movie was a bit slow and disjointed, dark, and not great acting. I stopped watching it about 45min in because, frankly, it was unable to keep my attention.",1441670400,2,204,4.857142857142857

6137860,3,B00H7LRY5E,"I was Ok with this movie, it kept my interest.  The ending just did not meet my expectations with the lack of drama and depth.

6137866,1,B00H7LRY5E,"I must be dense or something.  I really have no idea what this story was trying to tell.  Too many missing parts to draw any conclusion as to what it is supposed to be about.  The acting was great, but what? xxx",1440547200,2,211,3.9761904761904763
6137867,2,B00H7LRY5E,This was impossible to follow and concludes with a non-ending. This film never achieves believability. The story arc is not linear and nothing is explained to the viewer. intriguing concept but poor execution.,1440460800,2,209,5.363636363636363
6137868,3,B00H7LRY5E,"The movie's intention was awesome.  The lead character played by Brett Rickaby was very convincing.  That being said, the plot was somewhat difficult to follow because the film kept jumping from past to present events.  In addition, the volume was so low that I often had to rewind to listen to the dialogue.  Better lighting, and a a better production team would have gotten this movie four stars. Even with its flaws, I would recommend it.",1440374400,3,441,4.7631578947368425
6137869,4,B00H7LRY5E,"It was a good and entertaining movie, but I am not sure I understood what it was about.  They explained, yet they didn't explain.

6137887,5,B00H7LRY5E,Fascinating mixture of complexity and subtlety.

6137888,5,B00H7LRY5E,"This was a surprisingly more sophisticated of a plot than the description lets on.  I learned new details about the govt, NSA and CIA.

6137892,5,B00H7LRY5E,This is a very good movie on several levels. First is the way the movie looks.  Camera angles and lighting bring out a sense of mystery that you want to see just for the visual poetry.  The plot is very intriguing just as a suspense thriller.  I mean it keeps you watching just to see what happens.  As it nears the end your mouth will drop at the implications from our recent history.  You will walk away affected and you will think.,1437091200,4,434,4.2439024390243905

From the total misrepresentation of our military in the early torture scenes to the realization at the end that the subject was that 9/11 was a conspiracy by the US government, this movie just clearly demonstrates that there are elements in Hollywood that are committed to treason.
