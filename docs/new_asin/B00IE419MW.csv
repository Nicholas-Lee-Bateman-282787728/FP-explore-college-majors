6260294,5,B00IE419MW,"I watched this film in it's early version at a film festival and thought it was good then, but when I watched the final version I was blown away. It's nice to see a family film that seeks to be quality on every level.",1402358400,11,217,3.9545454545454546

6260327,5,B00IE419MW,Great family friendly movie with adventure and comedy. I have kids ages 7 - 14 and all liked the movie.  Mom and I liked the movie too.  We are all looking forward to another Ace Wonder movie.,1515196800,,192,4.162162162162162

6260329,5,B00IE419MW,"We, as adults, were really surprised how much we liked this movie! The plot is not elementary, my dear Watson. The meaning is not shallow. The discoveries are not simply circumstantial. Not just a kids' movie, even though the hero is, ""ten, actually"". Not tame, either. Contains some real action, plenty of suspense, and a whole bunch of sleuthing. Highly recommended for kids and adults 8+. Would make a great Father's Day film. I would guarantee that you'll be glad you watched this film if you like mysteries and/or meaningful movies.",1511827200,,537,4.912087912087912

6260333,5,B00IE419MW,"We just watched Ace Wonder, for the second time today.  It was AWESOME!!!  Great acting, funny, wholesome for the whole family.  I would feel comfortable showing this to any age.  There's nothing offensive, real family adventure.  Love little Ace Wonder - who plays himself in movie.  I hope they make more.",1506729600,,307,4.921568627450981
6260334,4,B00IE419MW,"First of all this is a remake of a video they made earlier called ""Heartstrings.""  The basic plot is the same: find clues to solve the mystery.  It's the same actors.  A Grandpa has died and left some clues to a mystery.  Some have complained about the acting.  You must remember it's not made on a Hollywood budget with Hollywood actors.  All that being said, the actors do fine and the cinematic quality is more than adequate.  Some people have complained about a man pointing a gun at a kid.  Whatever. If that bothers you, don't watch the film.  You've been warned.  Just know that the good guy wins and the bad guy doesn't.

It gets only 4 stars, because there were some things missing in this film that were included in the original.",1500940800,,739,4.440298507462686

6260336,5,B00IE419MW,"I'm always leary of low budget movies, but the reviews and trailer had me deciding to take a chance. I'm so glad I did. What a great family movie! Our audience consisted of grandparents, aunts and uncles, and 6 children ages 14 to 8. The acting isn't stellar, but Ace is so much fun and the librarian had us enthralled. The story is well done, the artwork (comic book style) is really neat, and it was very easy to get caught up in the mystery. We all ended the movie with smiles. I'm very happy with our purchase.",1486339200,,514,4.255102040816326

6260341,5,B00IE419MW,"Very pleasant surprise.  This one is a delightful story, and we really appreciate the families depicted here - no stupid fathers or out of touch mothers.

6260342,5,B00IE419MW,"This is a good, clean movie with interesting characters, a unique plot, and (surprisingly) very good acting.  My family has watched this movie multiple times since buying it, and each time is fun.

The main character, Gator, is an instantly likable wannabe detective/writer.  And the actor who portrays this ten year old does it marvelously, delivering lines like a seasoned pro.

The only downside to this movie was that there wasn't a sequel.",1466208000,,444,5.041095890410959

6260356,5,B00IE419MW,"The mystery is just right - the conclusion is not too obvious, but also does not just come out of nowhere.

We enjoyed Widows Mite by the same people and this was a huge improvement- can't wait to see what they do next. These young people are going to do fantastic making movies with no cussing and no love scenes. It's refreshing to watch a movie without having to fast forward as a family!!

They take time to carry out research on the internet, but never think to look up the grandfather until the end?  How could the Father not remember the old church? I though he grew up in that town?

But I say maybe it's good to slow down and see families interact in a positive way instead of the hyperactive pace of most modern entertainment.  I especially like the idea of strengthening the father-son relationship.  If you're looking for smart aleck kids and dumb adults found in typical kids' movies, or perfect Hollywood acting, you might not like this one. Personally, I can overlook some flaws because there are moments when this movie shines.",1430006400,,622,4.6880733944954125

WE ENJOYED THIS VERY MUCH. IT HAD A GOOD STORY LINE AND THE ACTING WAS VERY ACCEPTABLE. THE LITTLE BOY PLAYING ACE WAS VERY ENDEARING.",1425254400,,288,4.5576923076923075
6260386,2,B00IE419MW,"The writer/director, John Robert Moore, must hate himself. The property is an update of The Rover Boys via The Hardy Boys via The Three Investigators. A grandfather dies and leaves a puzzle for his grandson, Derek. Here is the first subplot: Derek wants solve the puzzle but is stymied in large part by the estrangement he has from his own father. The second subplot revolves around Ace Wonder, a ten year old would be detective and graphic novel writer. Now the basic idea isn't bad but the best actor in this mess is a tree which is some sort of energy transfer device created by the grandfather, an eccentric inventor who we learn felt estranged from Derek's father. If Moore had raised more money for the project, if Moore had hired actors who had more emotive abilities than the bark of a tree, if Moore had hired someone to edit his script, and if Moore had just stepped away from the project then a competent director might have given us a pretty good film. It is painful to watch this cast move about the screen destroying dialogue. I'm not sure how you would get a pre-teen to watch this mess. I suggest if your goal is a film for preteens then watch The Adventurer: The Curse of the Midas Box. If nothing else the contrast in acting is palpable.",1424736000,,1255,4.4847161572052405

6260388,4,B00IE419MW,"We loved this movie for it's clean, family friendly nature. It had mystery, humor, adventure, drama and heart. Very well done and entertaining movie produced by Christians.

6260393,5,B00IE419MW,"Very well done for a private effort; not much below a big-budget H-Wood effort.  Lost of twists, good humor and exciting action.  Love the spirutal heart and truth underpinning it as well.  Looking forward to watching it again and again!",1417219200,,237,4.875
6260394,5,B00IE419MW,"Ace Wonder is an entertaining movie that the entire family can enjoy. True it will not be an adults favorite movie, but it is a movie that parents can enjoy with their kids.

The movie itself is clean and well acted (most likely no one will win an Oscar for their performance, but they are believable). There are a few scenes in which the story is a little hard to follow, but overall, this is a great movie. I was thrilled to discover that there were other movies made by the same people (unfortunately, they are not on Netflix or streaming on Amazon. So, I will just have to wait.)

I would definitely watch this movie again. (In fact, Ive already seen it twice  once to check to see if it was appropriate for my siblings, and once with my siblings.) I would recommend this movie to anyone who wanted a clean, enjoyable family movie. Nothing for parents to worry about in this film.",1416614400,,884,4.378048780487805
6260395,5,B00IE419MW,"Family Review Center LOVES this movie.  It is entertaining, has a great story line and is a wonderful night of entertainment for the whole family.",1416441600,,146,4.84
6260396,1,B00IE419MW,"The rather stiff, sophomoric acting herein is explained by the casting. The two families central to the predictable story line apparently are composed of two families that supplied nearly every actor role. They must of thought, lets go to Tennessee and rent a house for a vacation, and later thought, we might as well make a film while we are here. The women mostly had sense to stay out of the way. Only gramps, who played the librarian, belongs in film. He was over the top bizzarro!",1416009600,2,485,4.586206896551724
6260397,5,B00IE419MW,"This flick reminded me of a young Indiana Jones movie.  I loved the treasure hunt aspect, and trying to decipher all the clues.  It was a little complex though...  with the five wooden objects, and then the five P's (pocket, poem, patriarch, pictures, pen), which finally led to the three kings.

It was very interesting to see how the deceased grandfather left clues that only his family would be able to figure out, thus helping to insure his legacy didn't fall into the clutches of evil.

Innocent, clean, fun for the whole family -- even though the theme was a tiny bit dark.  Highly recommended!",1414800000,2,600,4.666666666666667
6260398,5,B00IE419MW,"High production value. I'm not a great movie watcher by any means, but I thought it was mostly well-written and original. I still get a kick out of my favorite part: ""There was no parallel to his genius!"" The librarian was a great actor and played his part brilliantly. Good family film with lots of twists and some (I thought) original narrative methods (Ace Wonder's graphic novel parallel scenes). Clean, too.",1414195200,5,412,4.816901408450704

6260402,5,B00IE419MW,"I purchased this movie a couple of weeks ago, and finally got around to watching it last night.  I've got to say it -- Well done, guys!  This movie was simply great fun.  I think it would be unfair to compare it to a major Hollywood production, except to say that it is free from the stuff that takes the joy out of a good story.

Throughout the movie, we laughed, we said, ""that guy is great!"", and Gator just cracked us up.  Yes, some of the story is ridiculous, but I say that in the good, fun, charming and thoroughly enjoyable sense of the word.  Yes, there are a couple of holes in the story, but if I get serious about nit-picking those, I'd be missing the entire point of the movie.

You can view this movie just for the fun, or you can choose to notice the underlying message (from a dead man!) of what it means to be a man and a father.

I will be recommending this movie to a lot of people.",1411948800,4,901,4.0508474576271185
6260403,5,B00IE419MW,"Witty, suspenseful, creative and excellently produced! An independent film, Ace Wonder is a movie our family has looked forward to for a couple years now, knowing it was in production by a few homeschool families. May I just say it is better than any feature film I've seen lately? The adroitly constructed plot goes beyond the mystery to be solved by the bright, winsome sleuth and delves into the nooks and crannies of father-son relationships and generational iniquity. There were so many creative elements of excellence, I cannot list them all, so you really should just go out and get a copy, pop some popcorn and gather the family for a really edifying, wholesome and fun experience!",1410393600,,689,4.897435897435898
6260404,3,B00IE419MW,"Ace Wonder is a fun movie, reasonably well acted and written, and entertaining to watch.

Ace is a 10-year-old with the comic book drawing skills of a 40-year-old professional, a huge vocabulary in a big mouth, an inability to come up with his own comic book storyline, and delusions of being Sam Spade. As unrealistic as the character is, it makes him quite fun, and he becomes his own comedy relief. I found Ace very likeable, in an annoying-little-brother kind of way.

Derek Morton is a typical rebellious teen. His grandfather has just died, and it seems to him that his father (who was estranged from his own father) is eager to leave behind everything Derek cared for about his grandfather. In his grandfather's casket he finds a mysterious coded note that seems intended to draw him into a treasure hunt for his grandfather's legacy, but his father is determined to get back to his own life as quickly as possible.

Ace overhears Derek, and believing he has finally found the elusive storyline he wants for his detective comic, insists on helping. Convenient engine troubles in the Ace family camper lead them to spend the night with Derek;s family in Derek's deceased grandpa's fabulous house, which is conveniently the only local bed and breakfast.

As the boys investigate the clues, Dad Wonder (the Good Dad) offers wisdom on parenting to Dad Morton (the Struggling Dad.) Ace's brothers help investigate.  The wimminfolks stay in the background offering sympathetic expressions and occasional snacks.

Anyone concerned about the movie being touted as 'Christian' can relax, there is nothing to prevent you showing this in a secular school or institution. There is a brief visit to a couple of empty churches in search of clues in a hymnbook, and occasional mentions of prayer. You could safely watch this with even the most militant of atheists without having to hear more than a muted grumble.

The locations are beautiful, it's quite enjoyable to watch the mystery unfold and the sinister secrets behind it revealed, though it occasionally seems that the 'quest' is padded for the sake of creating dramatic opportunities. (They were supposed to recover four gifts the grandfather had given people to find four clues. If my memory serves me correctly, they only recovered one and solved the mystery from there, though one of the other unobtainable clues provided a chance for Derek to get himself in trouble and make interesting discoveries.)

The mysterious villain should be pretty obvious to anyone who's ever watched a kids' movie before.

All in all, though, if you have 8-14 year old kids in the house, especially if they are wanna-be detectives and/or cartoonists, this is a movie they will get a kick out of (younger kids might find it slow, and there are some violent scenes) and you will be able to watch it along with them painlessly. I would give it an extra half star if there were half stars.",1409702400,11,2919,4.892712550607287
6260405,5,B00IE419MW,"Unique, fun, mystery story line to keep the adults and older children guessing with some fun ""graphic novel"" and crazy character interludes that keep the younger ones interested as well! Family values are portrayed beautifully but not overly preachy. It's obvious to born-again believers that are also raising their families that Gator's (Ace Wonder) family is representing a Christian family - modest, well-behaved, respectful and unified but this is not proclaimed ""out-loud"" in the movie - not a lot of ""normal"" christian activities like praying, church going or sharing the gospel. There were a couple of places that some evangelical things could have happened but probably for the sake of ""not being preachy"" they went with a more subtle, wholesome family movie rather than evangelical.
A father's role is wonderfully esteemed - Gator's dad is shown as a gentle yet strong and intelligent man that is involved and active in his children's life, while the other father is dealing with the legacy of a ""present father but not engaged.""
Good acting and decent film production for non-Hollywood - the mystery/graphics are fun enough that you are not too distracted by some of the stiff/low budget spots.
My kids (ages 13, 6,5,4 & 2) loved the characters. The only negative I found was when Ace (a 10 year old boy) drove off in the Jeep - this wasn't addressed as something he should never do again! Knowing that I have a boy that as soon as he can reach the gas pedal will likely try something crazy like that this stood out to me but might not bother anyone else!",1409616000,3,1565,4.821561338289963

6260408,3,B00IE419MW,"We bought this movie recently after waiting several years for it to finally reach the DVD shelves. I had great anticipation building up for this as I had waited soooooo long to see it.  I can't seem to find ANY explanation on-line of why this took so long.  I enjoyed their previous movie ""The Widow's Might"".  This one had some humor, but most of it felt ""dark"" and ""mysterious.""  Nothing was too scary for my younger children, but this was not a ""funny"" movie.

The main reason for the 3 stars is that the DVD had NO EXTRAS!!  In fact, the DVD has the trailer on it with the original date of release that says coming 2011!  This thing didn't come out until 2014, why couldn't they put some extras or a commentary on here?!  Fortunately, if you want to see some behind the scenes you can just go look at them on youtube.

Another reason for the 3 stars, is that this did not include any solid message of our Savior Jesus Christ!  This movie was done by a very conservative group of Christians with no Gospel message???  I don't understand why someone would put so much time, money, and effort into a movie when the opportunity would be there for a strong Christian, Bible message and this opportunity was NOT taken!  This movie is STRICTLY for family entertainment and though that is not BAD, it was not what I expected.  The closest thing there is to speaking about God is a brief look at a hymn and a scene in a church.  However, to be fair, there is a strong, positive family friendly message of staying close (father & son).

A few minor issues I had with this one:  hard to follow story at times, weak special effects, and low volume in spots.

I hope this group does more movies, but somehow finds a way to get them out much quicker.

Bottom line:  it is a great mystery movie that was not totally predictable and all ages will enjoy.",1409184000,5,1841,4.346041055718475
6260409,5,B00IE419MW,"We streamed this video on a date night with our 12 year old daughter. We loved it so much I ran out to Walmart and bought the DVD so that the whole family can watch it together. I was so impressed with this movie. Impressed by what was in it and impressed with what wasn't in it. No swears, no flesh, no God's name in vain ... I mentioned this in line while purchasing the movie, and the woman at the register and the one standing behind me both looked up in surprise, then they quized me, and then they were eager to see the movie.
Ace Wonder was really well done. There was so much about it that gave glory to God. It was also very professional, the acting, cinematography, and special effects were on par with Hollywood. But the story line was better than most Holywood movies. I hope you see this movie and tell all your friends about it. I would really like to see many more films like this one.",1408752000,34,900,4.17816091954023

The filming, music, acting, editing and production standards are extremely high quality for an independent film....watch out Hollywood!  I'm really hoping to see more from these guys, maybe an Ace Wonder series? Kudos to the whole team!",1408579200,2,413,5.4375

The ending breaks loose with some additional action and great special effects scenes, too.

I've already ordered several DVDs for our family and for some of our friends!",1406073600,3,379,4.5588235294117645

They seem to have something that other Christian movie companies don't. The movie had a great message for parents to consider as they raise their children and I liked how the message wasn't spoon fed/overly evangelistic like most other Christian films.",1405641600,3,392,4.779411764705882
6260416,5,B00IE419MW,Excellent family movie!!  It is usually very difficult for our family to find movies that we deem as appropriate but this one is a keeper!  Such a great adventure for the whole family.  This is the same family who did 'The Widow's Might'.  They have much improved from even that great family film.,1405036800,13,297,4.547169811320755

This story is a good adventure for the entire family! The story is full of mystery and comedy. Lessons about family relationships, friendships and helping others are taught in this film.

This isn't a preachy offering with stiff characters, but remains fun throughout.  Great for a youth group or family gathering!",1404000000,2,320,4.907407407407407

6260421,5,B00IE419MW,"Two thumbs up on this movie. Super cute and fun. The main character is a 10 yr old kid who is producing a graphic novel about a detective... at the same time that he's living out being the detective and trying to solve his first case.

The visuals are very well done. The comic-style art panels used in some of the transitions was fantastic. Some of the acting is a bit stilted, but it has that sort of campy, corny humor that I like, which offsets the mild taste of ""super-clean family-friendly indie film"". I laughed a lot. Gotta love a story about a detective with an internal monologue that his client insists he can hear (probably because the detective is speaking out loud).

My kids liked it, too. In one of the scenes towards the end, there's a bit of a plot twist and my 11 yr old son bursts out, ""But--this was not a sci-fi movie! I refuse to believe this. Mysteries are not science fiction. It's either Star Wars or Sherlock Holmes -- NOT BOTH!""

A fun mystery that keeps you guessing. Quirky characters. Even a heart-warming message about the importance of family woven into the mix. I'm hoping that Ace Wonder becomes a series!",1402963200,3,1140,4.471153846153846
6260422,2,B00IE419MW,"Nice idea, but the pace was slow and ACE, the main character, was treated as an expendable character, definitely not the main character all the time. He appeared randomly in the movie, but many times the focus shifted to other characters. Therefore the movie had no suspense nor tension. And, if ACE was a young Sherlock Holmes, where was the bumbling Dr. Watson I ask you?",1402876800,,373,4.666666666666667

8641415,4,B00IE419MW,"Overall good movie. It acts and sounds like Adventures in Odyssey (AIO) on the big screen (I don't know if any writers/producers of AIO were involved or not). Very, very reminiscent of AIO's and old radio whodunit stories in structure and soundtrack. Was a little put off by the costume design, which was terrible! But apparently it was filmed at least around 2011? While it is family friendly, it is a little tense and mysterious, IMO 8+, but depends on the kids as well. Some parts were a bit campy, like riding on the back of the jeep?!? The acting was actually better than some other movies I've seen, no worse than a typical B movie. I think it could be serialized or at least have a sequel, Ace is likable and the mystery is interesting, nothing weird or dark. Will have to check out the production's other movie as well.",1521590400,,827,4.483443708609271
