Ahh to be young again and sitting in a theater on a Saturday to enjoy these classics.  Each features quality is great, and each feature has a Melody Ranch Theater program with Gene and Pat Buttram!",1386806400,,305,4.527272727272727

5734802,5,B00CQ8U61W,"Just what I wanted. Needed this to add to my collection, still seeking other titles.  And if any others are available please advise, very keen to complete my collection.",1381968000,,169,4.827586206896552
5734803,5,B00CQ8U61W,"Gene Autry doesn't look like a hero. He is little, pearshaped and rather slow in his movements. But he has this easy going authority, this non-acting acting that somehow makes him a great cowboy. All four films are super prints. Two of them are a bit family comedy like and a little boring and two of them are action-packed dust and guns. Anyway this Collection is super for Autry fans and a good suggestion for new fans!",1381536000,,421,4.48051948051948
5734804,5,B00CQ8U61W,"Good news, Timeless Media is releasing the entire TV series of Gene Autry. Until now I had to resort to the TV airings on the Westerns Channel with a logo in the corner. The picture quality on the DVD is magnificent and there is no logo. If I had a complaint, it would be too many episodes on one disc. Sometimes that makes discs get scratched sooner with more handling. But then again, the number of discs sometimes determines the retail price and this set is under priced. I bought all the seasons and have been enjoying the series again.",1376438400,4,540,4.41

8584957,3,B00CQ8U61W,"Not as good as other Autry collections.  My favorite in this set is RED RIVER VALLEY.  This is the familiar movie where Gene saves the dam from being dynamited.  It is funny to note that in the scene where the young black guy (Eugene Jackson) is doing a dance on stage, there is a painting of a nude woman on the wall behind him.  A few minutes later, the painting has been swapped out for another one.  Enjoyable movie.

SADDLE PALS - To me, the whole movie is ridiculous.  From the stupid story line to the obnoxious characters.  The songs are all that save this movie.  Even the ""Melody Ranch"" segment where Gene and Pat Buttram are talking to each other is below par.

APACHE COUNTRY - I thought this movie also was somewhat below par.  In the early scenes, Carolina Cotton is a little overbearing and corny.  Her part improves later on.

PACK TRAIN - Nothing special here. Lots of action but too many things in the story are just too illogical.  Of course, this is the ""Autry Fantasy"".  In the ""Melody Ranch"" segment, Gene tells about his horse trainer formerly working for Tom Mix.",1425945600,,1087,4.474489795918367

8584960,5,B00CQ8U61W,These old movies bring back many great memories,1408147200,,47,5.0
8584961,5,B00CQ8U61W,there are 4 movies in this set are all very good the picture is clear the sound is excellent i like gene autry movies if you like gene autry movies you will like this set.,1396051200,,171,3.914285714285714
8584962,5,B00CQ8U61W,Gene has always been one of my favourite cowboys and I can thoroughly recommend this set to any serious collector. John McHugh,1395705600,,126,4.7727272727272725
8584963,5,B00CQ8U61W,If you are a Gene Autry fan it is a good DVD to get as you get 4 movies on 2 DVDs at a good price.,1393459200,,98,2.8076923076923075
8584964,5,B00CQ8U61W,"This third collection has another four movies which are, ""The Cowboy and the Indians"" where Gene and Champion are on the warpath against pale-faced renegades, ""The Blazing Sun"" as Gene and Champion deal with bank robbers, ""Hills of Utah"" as Gene becomes a stand-in doctor, and lastly, ""On Top of Old Smoky"" in which Gene smokes out more badmen of the West.

Coming to you from 1949 to 1953, they are more of the old westerns that were just enjoyable then as they are now, and you should love all the songs as well.

Staring Gene Autry, Pat Buttram, Clayton Moore, Jay Silveerheels, Champion, Alan Hale Jr., Smiley Burnette, Gail Davis, Lynne Roberts, and more, is a good reason to own a copy for your western collection

There is another important reason to get a copy, the discs are region free, so there is no excuse not to own this five star set.",1391731200,,849,4.5359477124183005
