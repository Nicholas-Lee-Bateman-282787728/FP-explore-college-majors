Oh, I will buy them and enjoy them, it's just that there is some sort of cultural thing that I just can't get my brain around, I am missing something.  Nevertheless, this was quite entertaining.  I did see a few metaphors, or at least I hope they were metaphors, and if not, then I really missed something.",1360022400,,340,4.365079365079365
1169770,1,7885142876,I was not very disappointed with this DVD.  I had no notion that this was XXX-rated.  I did not finish watching this dvd because I found it offensive.  I would not have purchased it if I had known about the contents.  I contacted Amazon customer service and seller and the seller was relunctant to exchange to another dvd.  I will not purchase from the seller again.,1357084800,,366,4.484848484848484
1169771,4,7885142876,"abalard and heloise of the east. this is a very violent film ,it is also a film that will hold your attention.i did not think the present government approved of this kind of film ,sex and violence,well the maybe the violent part.it would add quite nicely with curse of the yellow flower.",1349827200,,287,4.538461538461538
1169772,3,7885142876,"As a remarke of SEX AND THE ZEN, the movie benefits with better image and improved special effects; but that is pretty much all.

Sex scenes are more like comedy; never really erotic. The original was better in that area.

In brief, it is interesting as a curiosity but how this movie outperform AVATAR in China is beyond belief.",1338422400,5,329,4.559322033898305
1169773,1,7885142876,This has to be one of the stupidest and idiotic movie ever made. The only reason I gave it one star instead of zero is because of the beautiful naked women in the movie.,1329350400,,169,4.0
1169774,4,7885142876,"[SEX AND ZEN: EXTREME ECSTACY - 2011 - Widescreen - In Cantonese with English subtitles - 128 minutes] It somehow figures in an odd way that China's very first foray into 3D cinema would be a sexploitation film rather than a 'Shrek' type family fest, yet one that would have (for better or worse) a much broader market appeal than the typical raincoat crowd associated with a grindhouse flick. A huge budget was bedecked on this movie, and it shows everywhere - costuming, sets, actors, cinematography, the 3d effects, etc. Even seen in 2D, it's apparent that the visuals lurch right out of the screen and onto our laps, so seeing it in 3D isn't a requirement (I saw it in both myself). And the blu ray high-definition audio and video is quite impressive.

Based on Chinese folklore regarding an ancient carnal prayer mat and some additional bizarre cultural myths, it centers on a young Ming-dynasty era scholar and his sexual encounters with the beautiful wealthy daughter he sets himself up to marry, and the concubines he beds in other attempts at sexual fulfillment. At some point he's made aware that his toolbox is a little light, and vows to do something dramatic about it, with the assistance of a depraved prince who presides over the ""Pavilion of Extreme Esctacy"" and his hermaphrodite court magician, as well as a few bungling handicapped surgeons who once studied with a great master now deceased. There's a healthy dose of comedic moments here, as there was in the original, but it's not quite as silly as the first.

The first hour of this film is impressive all around, from the gorgeous women, the colors, sets, women, costuming, effects and, oh yeah, the stunning women. Breathtaking babes whether draped or undraped, there's nudity heaped upon us tastefully and copiously every couple of minutes, and the scenes at the degenerate prince's mountain fortress display a carnal carnival environment I can only pray is part of my afterlife - I can dream, can't I? Shady deals are made, plots are hatched, schemes are in motion, and surgery is performed, endowing the dubious hero with the tool of a donkey, at which time he hoses down the countryside with great vigor, giving new meaning to the phrase 'Chinese Firedrill'. It's all done in dimwitted, lighthearted fun, but have I mentioned the women are beyond gorgeous? They make Salome look like Margaret Thatcher...

Unfortunately, the second hour (and yes, the film is too long because of this) becomes flaccid by miring itself down in too many cinematic clichs involving archetypal good guys vs. bad guys, minor martial arts (flying daggers and stars hurled right at the screen for the 3D effect) and ridiculous fight scenes, a race against time to save the principal characters from the evil lord and certain death, you know, the stuff associated with a typical, tepid Shaw Brothers flick from the 70's. In a foolish attempt to broaden its horizon and audience (though it did do phenomenal numbers at the box office - did parents bring their kids to this? You never know, as we're so uptight about nudity in the states, but torture or carve people up and it's ok), the film loses track of itself, so the second half has almost nothing to do with the first, and the nudity and exploitative elements are watered down considerably. Have I mentioned that the women are drop-dead gorgeous?

The ending is typical Hollywood - not so much awful, just that corny 'feel good' crap that makes me feel awful when all is said and done. Simply put, it's the wrong kind of 'happy ending' for an exploitation film, almost Speilberg-like (and that's no compliment). Is it worth seeing? Sure it is - have I mentioned the women are stunners and the nudity abundant??? 3  stars, but could have been a 5 if the effort to broaden its market appeal was abandoned. So get on your carnal prayer mat and pray the sequel stays truer to its core...",1327795200,23,3891,4.775631500742942

1169776,5,7885142876,"This is the longest version of this film on DVD. I don't know why they cut nearly 20 minutes out of some versions. Other versions are cut by about a minute or two. The scenes they cut are the same soft core scenes that encompass nearly the entire film, so it makes no sense. Oh well. Anyway, if you're a fan of this genre, this film is worth watching. The actresses they picked are gorgeous and know how to work it! This DVD is great. Nice widescreen enhanced picture and sound. If you want the true director's cut, this is the one to get. I think it is the only version available that has a foil cover, so look for that.",1318982400,32,621,4.140495867768595
