8393306,4,B001BXTPSS,"(This is a review of the 2008 National Archive and Record Administration DVD release of Theo Kamecke's 1970 documentary ""Moonwalk One"".)
I was a bit leary of the description of this DVD on this page, especially the remark that it is 44 minutes long; but, I went ahead and bought it. That notation is incorrect; it is, according to a rough timing with my wristwatch, about 1 hour 34 minutes long --a complete (or near-complete) copy of the documentary as I've seen on NASA TV. (I've seen this documentary several times on NASA TV. The only thing this DVD seems to be missing is a few of the vignettes of Earthly nature in the ""spaceship Earth"" portion of this film; otherwise, everything was in it that I remembered from the one shown on NASA TV.) The New York City Public Library apparently has a three-reel film copy of Kamecke's ""Moonwalk One"" which is an hour and 34 minutes long; and Yahoo Movies says this movie is an hour 36 minutes long. So, this video seems to be a pretty complete copy of it.
It is definitely a rough transfer. It appears someone transfered it directly from a film reel copy; and yet, perhaps, should have gone back to edit-polish the resulting digital copy. For instance, at one point you can see the reel running out (a second or two of film tail lead) and then it resumes. At at least two other points in the video the image freezes for a second or two before continuing (I guess at points where they had to stop recording to change the reels).
Over all, I would say that this is a good bargain. Many people who've seen this documentary (exhibited in theaters back in the '70s or, more recently, on NASA TV) have been frustrated by the fact that it has never been released on home video. (NASA TV never announces when they will show it or any other old archived film. And, now, they don't seem to be showing it at all --at least not for the past year or so.) And yet, here it is, finally, on DVD.",1231372800,6,1925,4.379888268156424
