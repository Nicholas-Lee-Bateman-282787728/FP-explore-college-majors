8374366,2,B002MZZU42,movie transfer was at 2 frames per second but the dialog was at speed and the two matched low budget dated no nudity disapointing,1511740800,,129,4.416666666666667
8374367,4,B002MZZU42,"A great B-movie, motorcycle grindhouse style. Enough of a plot to keep me interested, enough bikes to keep me, as a rider, satisfied. It was a good movie to watch on a winter afternoon when I couldn't ride my own bike.",1457395200,,218,4.341463414634147
8374368,1,B002MZZU42,"I collect Biker Movies and had this on my wish list for awhile. Read the other reviews and decided to search the web for additional info before I spent my money on the DVD. Found the complete movie on You Tube so watched it. If I liked it I would have purchased it. After watching it I have to say its the worst Biker movie I ever saw. Maybe the worst movie period. Poor acting, very little motorcycle action. Save your money.",1360108800,,426,4.2073170731707314
8374369,5,B002MZZU42,"If you like ""B"" biker movies,then you'll like this one.
It's got some great choppers in it and some class broads.

go buy it.",1301961600,3,125,4.208333333333333
8374370,1,B002MZZU42,"The tattered copy of the film makes it unwatchable.

Besides that its poorly acted, written and directed - looks like an 8mm home movie found in the attic - dull and unwatchable - especially in its shoddy state.

Big disappointment especially after Shanty Tramp by the same director.",1278201600,3,283,4.875
8374371,1,B002MZZU42,"This is a low-quality copy of a horrible film. While I did not expect the picture quality to be pristine by any means, it was terrible throughout the film (although I have to admit the sound was good). And if you were expecting nudity. look elsewhere--there is none here. Not even bad enough to be laughable; just awful.",1276128000,12,320,4.5344827586206895
