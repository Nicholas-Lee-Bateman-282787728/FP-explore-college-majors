7798045,5,1573301280,"A wonderfully realized film, bringing two brilliant artists together with a visionary filmaker's sure touch.  Ma is inspiring and inspired, and Tamasaburo Bando is incredible, in his (Onnagata) role.  In my opionion the  best of this series.  A great gift for any lover of Bach, Kabuki or high  art fully exposed and realized.  Full of spirit and discovery.  An  intriguing path-of-discovery from all those involved.  Highly recommended!",944006400,6,437,5.402985074626866
