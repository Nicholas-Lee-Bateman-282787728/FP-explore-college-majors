2174206,5,B00067BBZU,"There is not enough wonderful words to describe this documentary. I absolutely loved this dvd. It is about her personal journey of healing from sexual abuse as a child, she decides to find and interview all the Angela Shelton's in the US. I think they said 70% she found had been molested, raped or abused at sometime in their life. I don't want to give up the movie but she also pays a visit to her father who abused her. I think she is one amazing & inspiring person to be so vulnerable and honest. Every woman should see this regardless of what they've been through because you will relate on some level. I actually got this movie for work because I work with victims but it has also blessed my life.

If your thinking of getting it....than do, you won't be disappointed.",1204848000,,774,4.4125874125874125

2174208,5,B00067BBZU,"I watched this film as part of Victim's Advocate training and it is without a doubt the most powerful, compelling documentary on sexual assault survival I have seen to date.  Although there are some disturbing truths detailed in the film, there is also a strong message of survival and that when you least expect it, you can make a difference to a victim to help them on the road to recovery. I would dearly love to have my own copy but unfortunately, no one seems to have any copies available!",1132185600,8,494,4.488888888888889
2174209,5,B00067BBZU,I had to watch this documentary for a family violence class for college.  I found this to be overwhelmingly powerful and real.  I felt Angela's emotions as she was screaming and crying.  I don't know how anyone can abuse someone and moreless a child.  I also found it unreal that there are so many women with the same name and similar story!  What a great film to put things into perspective.,1122940800,5,392,4.464788732394366
2174210,5,B00067BBZU,"If after watching this you are not forever changed, you have no soul. Angela bears her heart for the world to see and by doing so encourages other women to do the same. I want to hug her neck and give her a standing ovation for her courage. As a survivor myself, she gives me strength to be a voice against sexual abuse. I have recommended this documentary to many people - both male and female.",1114387200,7,395,4.2105263157894735
2174211,5,B00067BBZU,"First, I cannot believe that there are not more reviews of this very moving documentary.  I am not an incest survivor of my immediate family, but a victim of a distant relative.  Thank God, my parents were so overprotective that he did not have access to me any more than he did!  Of course, I didn't tell.  I was twelve at the time, because I would not have been believed - because I was a CHILD and therefore probably imagined it(!)  And that SOB was innocent, right?  WRONG!

I was so very touched by Angela, her story, and the story of the other Angelas, particularly the ""Anonymous"" Angela.  I hope, hope she is okay.  I pray that the documentarian Angela, the anonymous Angela, and all of the other Angelas are doing at least better.  What a very moving and thoughtful documentary.

Angela is such a lovely, wonderful survivor.  The scene with her scumbag father made me so mad!  What a manipulative SOB!  I wish that I would have been with Angela then and would have held that poor excuse for a male and castrated him with a rusty tin can!  And the aftermath in the RV after the meeting with the SOB - I cried along with Angela and, with empathy, felt her frustration and rage.

But, I'm so glad that she triumphed over that scumbag ""sperm doner.""  (I refuse now to call him her ""father."")  She is living a fulfilling life and he is a low-life and always will be.  Someday, he will stand before God on Judgement Day and will finally have to admit his crimes, something that he would not do in this life.

Anyway, I would highly recommend this movie.  It shows that the American dream is not all light and that there is plenty of SECRET darkness.",1104710400,10,1652,4.403973509933775
2174212,5,B00067BBZU,"Searching for Angela Shelton is a documentary of the journey one Angela Shelton took around the country interviewing other women named Angela Shelton about their lives. This is a powerful film about violence against women that reaches past racial and class differences offering unity and hope. In searching for other Angela Sheltons, the filmmaker begins to find herself and encourages all viewers to do the same.

Though not for the faint of heart, I recommend this film wholeheartedly. (The DVD does have the option of viewing the film with or without strong language--a definite bonus.) This is for mature audiences who can deal with the mature subject matter of sexual abuse and assault. Somehow, Angela manages to turn a taboo subject into a source of inspiration and hope for all women whose lives have been touched by violence.",1099958400,10,834,5.043478260869565
2174213,5,B00067BBZU,"This is the story of an incest survivor, named Angela Shelton, who goes on a trip across America to meet with other women that share her name.  She sets out in an RV with a film crew.  Some of the Angela Sheltons are black and some are white.  Most are victims of abuse and all have their own stories.  This is a wonderful story, whether you have abuse in your past or not.  It ends on a positive note. This refers to the VHS version.",1099094400,9,434,4.0588235294117645

2174225,5,B00067BBZU,I think this is an amazingly well done documentary. I use this film to help people that want to work with abused children understand what they have suffered. It is not for people that can not look at the hard truth.,1345852800,,215,4.2682926829268295
2174226,5,B00067BBZU,"One out of three girls are sexually abused and this road trip story by Angela Shelton to meet 46 other Angela Sheltons proves that mathematical equation. In the 21st Century community has once more become important and the evolution in and through the electronic revolution is now enhancing community; and such creations as Amazon are part of the journey.

It's a lovely road trip journey and the connections between folks cannot be coincidental as you will see when the road trip ends in the town where her father lives, the father that made her one out of the three mathematical equation.

The truth will set you free and it help others along the way find courage and community; and that is what Angela Shelton has done as the wheels of her bus went round and round; and made tracks across this amazing land of ours, the United States of America.

Truth telling is always healing and I now share her DVD at my child abuse class that I teach.",1325721600,,943,4.568047337278107
2174227,4,B00067BBZU,"Angela Shelton and her step-siblings were sexually molested by her father.  The physical abuse is over and done but the psychological scars remain.  There are plenty of films, books, and websites that strive to disseminate information about this deplorable subject to a wider audience.  However, the concept behind Angela Shelton's documentary is unique and quite clever.  She surveys about forty women across America with exactly the same name: Angela Shelton.  The road trip, via a large motor home, is a voyage of discovery.  Angela covers a lot of ground throughout the United States and through the lives of the women she meets.  She finds violent relationships, thriving marriages, other cases of child abuse, rape victims, and drug addiction. Her nominal twins are white women, women of color, wealthy women, poor women, single moms, happy homemakers, successful entrepreneurs, and a variety of professionals.

Equally superb are the photos and video segments of Angela and her brother, Steve.  I hope that they hold on to each other and thereby divide the pain and multiply the joy.  The discussion (or confrontation) with her father out on his front porch may be rather typical of aging pedophiles.  Angela does a nice job of that difficult encounter.  She is calm and doesn't play for the camera, no hokey drama.  It's all rather mellow.  The meltdown comes later.  As they say, denial is not a river in Egypt, and her father does plenty of that.  For a similar experience with a soft spoken beast, watch Deliver Us from Evil.  It's a documentary about Oliver O'Grady, a pedophile priest and serial child rapist.  Neither O'Grady nor Angela's father ever spent a day in prison.

Now for some technical details and other observations.  First of all, Angela is easy on the eyes.  While in her late teens, she worked as a model in New York, Paris, and Italy.  She is very attractive, with a beautiful face and a pleasant voice.  Her maturity is tempered by a youthful innocence and a joyful disposition.  Secondly, the production quality of the documentary is generally pretty good, with interviews, black and white photos, and telephone conversations interspersed with various travel tidbits.  Sometimes it looks like a home movie, but that's part of its charm.  Finally, one small beef:  The audio for some of the phone conversations was too distorted or garbled to understand.  Subtitles for those segments would have been helpful and are probably available on the DVD.  (I watched the movie on Netflix through internet steaming.)",1313020800,3,2540,5.053012048192771
2174228,4,B00067BBZU,"I purchased and watched this documentary after hearing of it through a therapy group.  I must say that due to the subject matter and my own personal experiences, I was very apprehensive to watch this film.  However, just the idea of traveling across the country in search of people with the same name is both intriguing and rather unique.  While I was nervous to watch the film, I also wanted to see and hear about how so many women experience such horrific traumas, and how they have overcome their tragedies into obtaining fulfilled lives.  This film overflowed with the irony of such diverse women who are united by both abuse and violence, and the common bonds of sisterhood.  Angela Shelton displayed so much courage by making this film; addressing the prolific abuses and violent attacks that plague both children and adults in a country in which it's taboo to discuss, to mention, to even whisper about even when no one is listening.  Angela Shelton also showed incredible bravery when confronting her father.  I admire and greatly respect Angela Shelton for making this film, and also for putting it out there for the world to see what she has struggled with for so long, and then to compassionately share her struggles with the other women who shared her name.  This film showed me that I am not alone and share similar experiences with so many other women.  A final thought that came to my mind after watching the film:

We the survivors, always searching
Searching for the truth
Searching for the answers
Somewhere along the way,
We find each other
We find our strength, our courage
And then we find that only together
We not only survive
We learn to really know what it is to be alive.",1308096000,3,1697,4.683501683501683
2174229,5,B00067BBZU,"Very touchy story of Angela Shelton, who tried to bring out the common issue in the society that usually gets buried due to shame, by projecting her own story.
Few things I liked in this documentary:
1) The approach she took to gather the sample mass to inquire people of their bad experiences.
2) The support she received to make this documentary
3) Her travel across the US is a depiction of her freedom.

Overall, a very good educational documentary. I recommend this not just to women, but even to men as well, so that they are aware of some the abusive problems women face in their lives.",1307836800,,593,4.4907407407407405
2174230,5,B00067BBZU,Great documentary to help women deal with their childhood abuse.  You are not alone!  Fight for your right to move on and have a productive life.,1297814400,,145,4.538461538461538
2174231,5,B00067BBZU,"I first saw this documentary on lifetime and was deeply moved.  I have come to know Angela a little as she did an endorsement for my book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Keystone-Kid/dp/B004H4XC3M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Keystone Kid</a>&nbsp;and work with those who have gone through abuse.

For those who have gone through abuse, the reality is, sometimes just knowing you are not alone is a huge part of the story.  Angela attacks this subject with venom and avail.  She does so in a way that will make you laugh, and ultimately, make you cry.  She also addresses issues that others outside of abuse can better understand their loved ones who have gone through abuse.  There are no pat answers, no easy solutions, each individual Angela Shelton has to deal with the issue in their own way, thus finding their own solutions.

I have seen no documentary that is as powerful on the subject of abuse as good as this one.  It will provide comfort for those who have been abused, hope for those seeking it, understanding for those who don't understand, and a strong powerful voice to those who have been a part of abuse that choose to sweep it under the rug.

My hope and prayer is this story inspires the others who have suffered the impact of this action to stand up, speak up, and be free!

2174232,5,B00067BBZU,"Have you ever wondered what others who share your name might be like? Multi-talented artist Angela Shelton did and decided to travel across America to meet as many of her namesakes as she could. When she started to interview them over the phone, she came across a sad fact--over half of the women she spoke to were survivors of rape, sexual abuse and/or domestic violence. Angela herself is a survivor and this journey around the country became just as healing for her as it had been for the women she met.

Angela and her crew took an RV to make this trek. They met women from diverse ethnic and economic backgrounds who shared their stories and how they've overcome abuse. Throughout the film, Angela keeps in phone contact with one of the women who is an alcoholic. Angela continually tries to reassure her that she is worthy of a happy life. Eventually, she gets through to her, but her lack of self-esteem is something that will hit home with many survivors.

This film isn't rated and Angela speaks candidly throughout the film about her abuse. There is one scene after she confronts her abuser where she lets out her frustrations and doesn't refrain from swearing. I think this is safe for teen survivors, but if you're concerned, then watch the film yourself first to gauge how appropriate it is for them.

It may be triggering for survivors at any age depending on where they're at in their healing, especially the scene where she confronts her abuser. However, I believe this is one of the most important scenes in the movie. His reaction of denial and laying blame is so typical. Survivors who confront their own abusers need to see it to realize that they aren't crazy if they get the same reaction.

I highly recommend Searching for Angela Shelton. It will help you feel less alone. In fact, encouraging more women to speak out was one of the main objectives of the project. It's empowering and inspirational to see how the women in the film have not only survived horrific circumstances but are now thriving. Angela's positive attitude is infectious.

The film has received an incredible response including an appearance on the Oprah show and requests for speaking engagements around the country. Angela was so inspired by the response that she founded the Angela Shelton Foundation which runs the Survivor Manual with the mission of empowering more women to lead joyful lives.",1283644800,,2391,4.793689320388349

What it leads to is the unveiling of an epidemic regarding abuse and violence.

2174238,5,B00067BBZU,"I love this movie! It has by far been the most inspiring film I have seen, and has impacted my life in a huge way. Most movies don't do that. As a survivor of abuse as a child, and having been through my share of unhealthy relationships as an adult, this film has truly touched my heart and let me know that there is in fact a way to break the cycle and turn your life around. You do have the power to choose your path in life, to move past trauma and live true to your real self.

2174241,5,B00067BBZU,"Searching for Angela Shelton is a must-see film. Filmed during the writer's strike, Angela Shelton decided to do a documentary; a survey of all the Angela Sheltons in the country. What she didn't expect to uncover was that over half the Angela Sheltons she met had been raped, beaten or abused throughout their lives - including herself. She had uncovered an unspoken epidemic of violence and trauma; and yet she also encountered incredible stories of survival and fortitude. The journey forced her to face her own dark past, and she is doubly brave in sharing this with everyone in an honest manner and with a selfless purpose; to inspire others to heal from their own trauma. In her own words she says 'Like water, we all rise at the same level, so by healing ourselves we can encourage and help others others and so we can end the cycle of violence'.
This film was truly incredible for me to see; I honestly think Angela Shelton's film and her other work online for helping survivors, has probably helped save my life. Everyday she is a force for good, encouraging folk to heal the negative imprints left over from the horrific and terrifying moments of our lives, to change our inner dialogues from self-hating to self-cherishing, and so begin to live our lives with more joy.
Abuse is an epidemic and a silent one. The world has suffered so many traumatic events in the last century, lets hope we can all make a difference by finding our voices.

Combine it with the fact that Shelton now sells high priced healing courses to abuse victims and I'm left wondering if all this really happened or if I was just conned out of $1.99 by Angela Shelton and her gay brother.  This movie reminds me a lot of Capturing the Friedmans.  I'm sure something happened but the response is curious at the least and the players disturbing in their own right.

Many people cannot seem to understand how incest victims feel silenced and crazy when their abuser(s) deny their actions. This is poignantly shown. It is particularly important that this video shows women who have overcome the negative circumstances from their childhood and young years. It makes one want to cheer to see the resilience of the human spirit. I have used this film in graduate mental health training programs to give students experiential impact about these topics.
