8136809,5,B000H5U2PG,"This DVD has three 20-minute workouts: strength, stretch, and balance.  I purchased it for the stretch workout, but I enjoy the other two workouts as well!  Each workout is set on the golf course, so the scenery is beautiful.  Even though the workout is marketed toward golfers, the exercises are appropriate for non-golfers as well (I do not play golf!)  There is some occasional wind noise, but that is sort of highlighted/played off by the addition of graphics in the background (i.e., a family flying a kite.)  This is a terrific workout for a beginner or intermediate exerciser, but an advanced exerciser may not find it challenging enough.",1402272000,,645,4.935185185185185
8136810,5,B000H5U2PG,Great video!  I've been using the instructions for 3 weeks now and can already feel the difference.  I'm much more flexible and in time the strength should increase as well.  My wife also loves it because it's not too physically demanding but still feels like a good workout.  Great job Mindi.,1355961600,,293,4.686274509803922
