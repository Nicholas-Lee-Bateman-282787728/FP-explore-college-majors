8409694,3,B003YOMNEA,"The Stone Guest simply does not convince.  Well sung, but atrocious visuals and wooden stage presence.  However, Mozart and Salieri delivers. Grpping drama, great music.  Since both are not likely to be seen in the West, a must for lovers of Russian opera.",1429056000,,256,4.906976744186046
8409695,3,B003YOMNEA,"As noted by B. Cathey, this double-bill of operas rarely staged outside of Russia is very well sung. But the picture quality is so washed out that background sets are almost invisible.  The tenor singing the role of Mozart is a mite long-in-the-tooth for someone supposedly only 35 years old & the prompter in this production is so loud that he deserves billing along with the 2 principals.  Otherwise, a worthy addition to any serious collection of operas on DVD.",1290124800,8,464,4.7875
8409696,4,B003YOMNEA,"This double bill of rarely performed Russian operas by Dargomyzhsky and Rimski-Korsakov dates from the 1980s. Both Bolshoi productions are quite well sung, staging is fine (if a bit spare). Don't look for state-of-the-art digital video (were these presentations broadcast over Soviet TV?). But that shouldn't deter the devotee of Russian opera, and in particular, rarely-performed Russian opera, from purchasing this disc. Recommended.",1288656000,4,435,5.920634920634921
