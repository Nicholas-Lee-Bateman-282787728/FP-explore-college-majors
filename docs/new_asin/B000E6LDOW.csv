Little  bear  innocently  plays  with  friends,  family  or  his  grandparents.  &  manages  to  have  fun  while  helping  his  parents  around  the  house  inside  &  outside,  has  fun  while  doing  his  chores.
&  is  about  the  most  positive  show  you  can  find  anywhere.  You  take  for  example,  a  game  of  hiding  seek,  or  I  spy,  stuff  like  that.  The  show  represents  peace  &  understanding.  Most  importantly  it  reminds  us  all  that  anyone  can  enjoy  life.  There  are  no  bad  guys  in  the  show.  No  evil, no  enemies  of  any  kind.  It  usually  caught  my  attention  if  I  saw  it  on  Nick Jr  or  Nickelodeon  channels.  The  show  is  spectacular!  But  is  this  the  complete  series  on  DVD?  If  it  is  perhaps  I  will  buy  it.  His  mother  or  father  usually  play  along  instead  of  getting  irritated.  Nobody  in  this  show  is  rude  to  each  other.  Normally  friends  will  have  at  least  one  argument,  Not  in  this  show.  &  chances  are  it  tells  us  what  the  world  would  be  like  if  we  were  extremely  nice  to  each  other,  rather  than  having  different  personalities,  where  people  or  friends  would  get  tired  of  each  other  eventually.  A  show  like  this  is  a  heavenly  show,  &  I  think  its  one  even  God  himself  appreciates.
&  every  character  has  got  the  highest  amount  of  respect  for  him  &  each  other.
Truly  the  kind  of  show  you  can  learn  something  from.
One  last  thing  I  will  say,  if  you  take  a  look  at  shows  like  (Tom  &  Jerry)  (The Smurf  series  from  the  80's),  or  (Loony Toon's  with  Bugs Bunny)  &  however  many  others  you  want  to  name,  they  just  don't  compare,  if  we're  trying  to  teach  our  kids  at  an  early  age,  this  is  a  good  show  for  them,  for  any  kid  between  6  &  12.
Parents  should  be  perfectly  content  with  this  show.
The  only  disappointing  thing  here  is  the  price  is  way  too  expensive.
499.99  is  an  awful  lot  of  money.",1472428800,,2204,4.319088319088319
