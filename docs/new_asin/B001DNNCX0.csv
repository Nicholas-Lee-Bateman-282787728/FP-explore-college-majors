8294341,1,B001DNNCX0,"Don't waste your time with this , especially if you are a Beatles fan or McCartney fan.  No real performances performed played all the way through.  Basically a bunch of so called friends and Beatles experts telling you what you already know or don't need to know. Nothing of substance.  Yesterday and She loves You ar ethe two songs they focus on throught much of the DVD.",1254528000,16,373,4.537313432835821
8294342,2,B001DNNCX0,"If you are an obsessive compulsive fan, you will like this item.  But its more like a documentary with old film clips.  All of the clips are available in better quality thru other dvd's.  It's a overpriced for what you get. It should be in a 3.99 bin.  It was mediocre at best.  It's not really about Paul individually either... It quits after the breakup.",1234137600,32,356,4.415384615384616
