8602295,4,B00E81TPYE,Both my wife and I are quite pleased that we were able to get this DVD. It is a rare item especially the Alabaster's Song which is an extra clip on this DVD. Hopefully this kind of children's entertainment will make its way back into today's society as we are lacking good Christian values as the generations keep passing by.,1267747200,2,325,4.433333333333334
