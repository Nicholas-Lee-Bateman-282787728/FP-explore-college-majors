While I enjoy and am greatly impressed by Mr. Hunter's work, I was really hoping for a more behind the scenes video.",1362960000,,267,4.469387755102041
8157434,5,B000KJU100,"This is the story of William Hunter, one of the leading woodturner-sculptors of these times, and one of the original leaders of the modern woodturning movement. The story of his development as an artist is very interesting, and should inspire many that the key to becoming an artist, besides talent, is determination and perseverance. But the work itself is what most grabs and holds the attention. It is breathtaking! His expressions of spiraling energy carved into the bowl form are technically difficult and aesthetically spectacular. It is no wonder that, after years of struggle, Hunter has at last become widely recognized and highly successful doing exactly what he always wanted to do, without compromise. To anyone who is interested in the high ART of woodturning, this artist and this book are highly recommended.",1248393600,2,823,5.195488721804511

They the field as it evolved from its foundations in forms to its emergence as a vehicle for sculptural exploration. As historians, critics and fellow artists have observed, Hunter's early forms in wood investigated the medium's rich expressive potential and advanced a new direction for the entire field of contemporary wood sculpture.",1208736000,,975,7.872727272727273
