8488196,5,B005WY9JUG,"I showed this DVD to a group of Girl Scouts and they were very excited about it and wanted to see an actual fish farm. I also showed it to several classrooms so far and they are now starting an aquaponics farm in their AgriScience Department. This is a great tool for teachers, churches and others who want to teach others about this sustainable farming technology. It is only 15 minutes long and covers a lot of the basics without being overly detailed.",1322179200,6,454,4.481927710843373
