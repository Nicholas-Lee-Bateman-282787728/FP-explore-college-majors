3056008,1,B0010YVCAM,"I have been a fan ever since the first movie came out.  The franchise has definitely had its ups and downs over the years. This is not only a bad Highlander movie, it is one of the worst movies ever made.  I found it to be as close to unwatchable as a movie could possibly be.

The only reason I gave it one star is because Amazon does not allow zero star reviews.  This movie deserves the introduction of negative stars for reviews.",1197936000,8,433,4.180722891566265
3056009,1,B0010YVCAM,"This is a review based on the version broadcast on the SciFi channel.

I was so excited to see a new Highlander movie, though in reality I didn't expect much. Unfortunately, its every bit as bad and even far worse than Highlander 2. The story line is dreadful and (like the other movies) changes previous events. But in all, I think the main problem I have with the movie is the fight scenes. I mean, why did the creators all of a sudden decide to make everyone fight in super speed with ridiculous sound effects? This movie is absolutely horrid in pretty much every way possible.
If only someone would make a Highlander movie worthy of the original (or better for that matter). Unfortunately, if it ever happens, I doubt it will be anytime soon.",1197763200,9,746,4.525925925925926
3056010,3,B0010YVCAM,"I am a Highlander Series fan, got all the seasons, love the saga. I like the movies, 1 & 4 the most. In Europe the movie is already available for several months. I also heard a lot of bad things about this release so when I bought it, I did not have very high expectations and maybe that's why I feel Highlander 5, which was certainly not a great movie, was an enjoyable movie. Good to see Macleod, Methos & Joe again",1197590400,4,417,4.097560975609756
3056011,1,B0010YVCAM,"That's right - worse even than the disastrous Highlander II. The plot is laughable, the acting is either flat or cheesy, the directing is a mess, and the fight scenes are flat out goofy. People have been calling this the final nail in the franchise's coffin - and I think that's about right - unless someone comes along and decides to remake the original someday.

3056012,2,B0010YVCAM,"I will tell you right now this marks the end of the highlander movie series, This movie first came out via the internet as a torrent file as the russian cut leaked. Everyone saw this movie it was supposed to be originally released in theaters but the reviews were so bad that the producers were not going to take the risk of releasing it theaterically. So a couple months later the dutch cut of this movie premiered on the sci fi channel on september 15th. It was basically identical to the russian cut with very little editing. THe thing that hurt this film the most is its story line, Editing, quality, Dialogue, This film is missing so much. It makes the previous highlander movie Endgame look like a master piece. With that said i wouldnt recommend buying this unless your a die hard highlander fan like myself. If you are a new fan of the Highlander series i recommend only the first and third movie. Or the first and fourth movie and tv series/

Good Luck",1197244800,11,961,4.4602272727272725

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY I feel like Amazon should give me stars for even trying.

3056060,1,B0010YVCAM,"I love the first ""Highlander"" film. I don't hate the second one as much as I probably should. I like the third, although it is a bit derivative. I thought 'Endgame' (Highlander 4 for the uninitiated) was a strong transition from the original cinematic iteration of the franchise to the television universe. But this thing... Man, is this rough. The special effects are atrocious at best. The acting is on par with a Junior High School drama class who are reading the script for the first time. Speaking of the script, it is less sophisticated than a grocery list, and tells a less coherent story. It is so bad that if it randomly paused, I would believe my ps4 refused to stream it any longer, and I would understand. This movie is almost an endurance test. It has ruined both the show and the films for me, at least for awhile. Avoid this at all costs.",1479427200,,853,4.4743589743589745

All the other sequels had storyline issues and continuity problems but they were good as well. The source however was by far the worst film of the series. Cheaply made, poor special effects, and the destruction of a legendary sword were big flaws. It is dedicated to won of the late creators. You think it would be better because of that.",1458432000,,447,4.397590361445783

3056067,3,B0010YVCAM,"Okay so if you've read the other reviews like I have calm down, take a breath, count to ten.  Here goes...first, the movie isn't great as far as Highlander stories go.  It creates weird holes in the Highlander universe, and the fact that they decided to go post-apocalyptic with the series doesn't do anything to help the franchise.  Still, if you're a hard-core fan, this is where we find ourselves.  It was cheaply made and poorly executed, Joe Dawson's character delivers as always, which in some minor way helps to salvage the movie.  Is it disappointing? Yes. Is it worth watching?  Well, there can be only one (opinion on that)......yours.",1456012800,,645,4.818181818181818
3056068,1,B0010YVCAM,"This is beyond bad.  I originally saw this when it debuted on Sci-Fi (was originally supposed to have been a feature film) and have been trying to bleach it out of my mind since.  I feel genuinely bad for the actors and all involved with the series.  This even isn't ""bad"" in a MST3K sense, it is just horrible.

If you enjoy the series and (most) of the movies, please do yourself a favor and do not purchase this.  This will forever alter your perception of the franchise, and not in a good way.  Pass it by.  Move along, nothing to see here, just move along.",1453680000,,561,4.235849056603773
3056069,1,B0010YVCAM,"As a fan of Highlander the series, and movies one, three, and four, I had high hopes for this movie.  I wouldn't bother if you're a fan.  It doesnt live up to it's promise, and the ending goes so far astray of normal legend that it will only get real fans angry.  If you haven't ever watched any Highlander, this isn't the place to start.  This isn't only a terrible Highlander movie, it is probably the worst movie I have ever seen based on a TV show I liked, and given how bad Star Trek V was, that's saying something.",1449100800,,520,4.17
3056070,1,B0010YVCAM,"As a huge fan of Highlander both in movies and the series, THIS is the WORST thing in the entire Highlander collection. The Search for Vengeance anime was WAY better than this movie and a few of the sequels (the original movie is un-doubtably the best). What is even funnier about the Source is it was suppose to be part of a trilogy! Imagine two more movies worse than this one! But, they really couldn't make the other two movies because if Duncan was the last one and could have children, then there isn't any more immortals to make more movies.

Save your time and money and remember the classic moments in the first movie and the series. I pretend this never happened and ignore it when I see it anywhere.",1442793600,,710,4.419847328244275

3056077,1,B0010YVCAM,"The only continuity The Source has with the rest of the Highlander franchise is that the entire franchise is known for having no continuity within itself. Every movie has different rules for immortals. Even the TV series, as awesome as it was, constantly changed the plot. (First it was the time of The Gathering, then it was just any other time, etc etc) The Source has no connection with any of the previous movies or shows.

Adrian Paul's Duncan MacCloud doesn't even feel like the same character. Suddenly he is teaming up with enemy immortals to find the original immortal so they can kill it so they can....oh heck I don't remember. I don't even care. I watched this just because I'd seen every other Highlander story. I wanted to be thorough. But there is a good reason why there hasn't been another Highlander movie since. The Source took a katana to the head of the Highlander franchise and finally killed it.",1429488000,3,918,4.666666666666667
3056078,1,B0010YVCAM,"As awful as ""Endgame"" was, this is even worse on some levels.  As other reviewers have noted, perhaps the most frustrating thing are the liberties they've taken with the mythology they spent decades creating.  Just have some internal consistency please.  But then throw in a convoluted plot, bad writing, terrible direction and bored acting, and you get this pile of trash.  I'm happy to say I saw it years ago after it first came out and I've pretty much blocked it out of my memory entirely.  It was that traumatic.  Do yourself a favor and just pop an episode from the TV series into your DVD player, blue-ray or whatever.  But avoid this film at all costs.",1425168000,2,660,4.589743589743589
3056079,1,B0010YVCAM,"Don't get me wrong. I LOVE 'The Highlander' first movie w Christopher Lambert. I LOVE 'The Highlander' series with Adrian Paul. This movie? Didn't make sense. Didn't follow movie nor series. I only watched it because after watching all 6 seasons of Highlander on Pay per view channel, I wanted to see more Adrian Paul. Movie was a farce. Another waste of an hour and a half. It's sad they couldn't have had same writers, directors & producers they had in past. It was boring and uneventful.",1425081600,,490,4.64367816091954

3056082,2,B0010YVCAM,"A long time fan of the highlander theme. I say theme because I love the concept and the 1st movie really did set the tone (even if the acting wasn't anything special and the sword fights were just okay if you compare them to the later Highlander TV Series sword fights) and then you have the awesome unoffical soundtrack with all those great songs from Queen that were written perfectly for the movie and then also as the theme song for Highlander TV series. Having said that the 1st movie really was great as a mid 1980s cult classic type of movie. Then the tv series came upon us giving us Duncan Macleod in all his glory for 5.33 seasons. Sure they played loose with some of the rules and went a little overboard with the watchers death squad who ""only watch and never interfere"" LOL and yes I said 5.33 seasons bc about 1/3 of season 6 was at least average quality episodes and then 1/3 of season 6 was a great way defy the whole tone of over 100 episodes in those 5 past seasons and a way to piss off Highlander fans and a craptastic way to end a great TV series. Then the other 1/3 of season 6 was the female audition for the spin off Highlander The Raven which was a horrible idea and of course none of the leading ladies in those episodes connected with the audience like Amada did, who ended up taking the lead for the 1st and only season of Highlander The Raven. I think it partially failed bc fans were so pissed off at the why Highlander season 6 went that they just said forget it Im not gonna continue with this.

Now back to the Highlander movies. So you have a terrible couple of movies after the original Highlander but still if you're a fan once they put out the renegade version of the 2nd movie things started to look a little better and flow more with the true tone of Highlander's great ""theme."" Then comes The Source. While the acting is ok for this budget and type of movie the darkness/horror type theme to it, overboard un-relateable characters and the HORRIBLE storyline/ending really take it out of line with everything that the fans loved about the 1st movie and the TV series. The sword fighting/quickenings and so forth aren't too bad but nothing could save this movie from the crappy plot and a ending that just made me sick to my stomach as a Highlander fan. Its worth a 1 time watch for any Highlander fan just for the action/fights/quickenings but after that try to erase it from your memory just like you erased the planet Zeist from your memory.

I hope one day that some bigtime producer/writer/director revisits the original move and decides to reboot the whole thing and start from scratch. How I would do it would be to do a trilogy starting off with a movie about the Kurgan and his life starting out showing how he got to be the way he was taking some heads and having flash backs etc then part 2 and 3 is a remake of the classic cut into 2 movies where the final battle is the true ending of the trilogy where Connor defeats the Kurgan and takes the prize which is left at that no explanation needed as I think the prize is something that should never be fully explained and left at the way Ramirez described it.",1415145600,,3156,4.338409475465313

3056086,1,B0010YVCAM,"Normally I would say c'mon it cant end this way there needs to be one more to get the bad taste out of fans mouths but this movie was so bad they definitely should reboot the franchise.  If they were going to come out with such a bad product why didn't they just end it with Endgame!  Now that would have been a good time to end it.  2014 Update:  The problem with this film and this is coming from a fan that has seen every episode of the series and every film multiple times, yes including Highlander II, is honestly it feels like a really low budget version of Highlander, it just feels really cheap.  From the story line, the effects, the acting, but most importantly the last 3 minutes or so of the film, I still don't know what to say about the image of Anna's fetus right before the end credits. I think I understand what they were trying to do, they were trying to put Highlander in the context of modern day considering for the first time there are no flashbacks from historical times that most Highlander fans love instead the whole story takes place in this dystopian future, sort of like Highlander II only without the blaster guns.  In retrospect personally I thought Adrian Paul did a great job in this movie.  Paul, Wingfield, and Byrnes returning to their roles from the television series was pretty much the only reason why I put myself through this movie a second time.  The action isn't too bad if you enjoy Syfy channel action movies.",1408838400,2,1454,4.419475655430712

I love the franchise, especially the tv series.
This movie is nothing but plot holes, and terrible acting.
The guardian has been asleep for a long time- but makes corny one-liner references to the modern era- like singing the line ""who wants to live forever"" (a song in the tv show) after he kills Joe in the cemetery?
Maybe this movie could have been saved if the Guardian hadn't been such a joke...but probably not.
The common complaint about the prize, isn't actually all that far off from the original movie. That's what Conner's prize was too, ""mortality"". As I've always understood it, the winner of the prize gets what they desire most. For Duncan it's the ability to make babies. For an immortal like Jacob Kell, it's something else. So I can't complain about that part. Just everything else! hahaha

Now still trying to give it a chance, I watched it the next day, fully rested with nothing to do - WoW! was my first thought.  Were they trying to loose money?  Who was in charge?  This was not the actors fault or the crew of the movie.  This was all on the creative side.  Stupid!!  Bad writing, bad directing, bad producing.  Looks like it was made by first year students in film school in Lithuania with a budget of $40 and a computer.

-I thought this film filled in gaps that Highlander fans wanted to know. The highland characters we know and love did a good job in their roles.

Personal view:
- This is not the way I thought they would fill in questions on the ""Immortals"" but never the less it was a very good movie and I give it an ""A"" grade. This could have been an A+ but about 3 of characters that are writen into the movie have weak roles and thought they should have had stronger characters presence over all.

Cons:
- Unless you watch the other movies and the series (mainly the movies) you may miss out on key knowledge and history of the Highlander character.
- This is only a con because I watched it twice and unless you pay attenion to the darker character role you may miss on the real purpose of his role.",1378339200,,794,4.217105263157895

SPOILERS AHEAD!

I'm gonna start by saying that I've only ever seen the first Highlander film all the way through. The other movies I've seen major scenes of and can safely say they aren't all that good. I still need to check out the TV series, as I hear it' s fun cheesy 90's show. I can say that I am a big fan of the first Highlander movie. It's not a perfect film by any means, but it's still a fun fantasy action movie. It helps that the story keeps it pretty simple and doesn't go into where the immortals come from (we've seen what happens when they try to explain where they came from). And while it gives me a chuckle to see Sean Connery playing an Egyptian who's pretending to be Spanish, and then we got French actor Christopher Lambert trying to do a Scottish Accent the movie still has a lot of heart to it. Part of that not only comes from the writing, but also the wonderful direction by Russell Mulcahy, and overall good performances by the cast (and we can all agree that Clancy Brown as the Kurgen is one of the most entertaining movie villains).

And then there is The Source...

What in God's holy name where these people thinking!? Seriously! It's as if they watched the original movies, hated it, and wanted to do all they could to drag it through the grime of the earth! I know so many others have said something like this, but I just had to vent my frustrations of how awful this movie is. Nothing about it makes sense! The whole planets coming so close to the earth is laughable, and it would cause horrific things to happen with this many planets that close to us. The acting is...uhhhhhhhggggg! The two worst characters in this entire mess are of course the Guardian and the priest guy Giovanni. Both have their own stupid look (Giovanni with his weird slicked hair and the Guardian who looks like Krato's retarded brother) and then there's just their personalities. First you go the Guardian, who is the least intimidating villain I have ever seen! He just mugs at the camera and says stupid one liners. Seriously, Jacob Kell was a better villain if only for the fact of how unintentionally hilarious Bruce Payne is. Giovanni is just an idiot! He is this cliched man of the cloth, talking about the newly mortal immortals dying because their faith isn't pure! Nothing against faith, but these are guys who know that non Catholic immortals have roamed the earth for eons now. The character Methos was one of the four horseman of the apocalypse! This whole ""He didn't heal because his faith wasn't pure"" just doesn't make sense in context with this series. The whole post apocalyptic setting just adds nothing to the story and the cannibal sub plot sounds like it would've made for a better movie. And I don't need to go into the raping of the Queen songs.

And the ending is the most insulting of all! The prize is to have babies!? Sure, making life is all fine and dandy, but it is so empty and hallow in this situation. It's especially hallow when the character of Anna had no development and you never once cared if Duncan and her lived happily ever after. That they make it so all the fighting and sacrificing was totally pointless! That apparently it was all about just being pure of heart and some other Care Bears nonsense. There's also the fact that this Source was never mentioned in any of the movies or in the entire six year run of the TV show (I may have not seen the show yet, but I know that this whole finding the Source was made up for this pile of puke). And apparently this whole thing was meant to be a trilogy! But thank God it doesn't seem to be happening; I think the producers of this knew that the fans would riot if they tried to make it.

Do yourself a favor folks, stick with the first movie and the TV series (most say the third isn't so bad as it's more a remake). I also hear the anime movie isn't too bad.",1370044800,3,4025,4.338645418326693

Yes it's a low budget film but I thought they did well with what they had.. I was impressed with the makeup effects on The Guardian, kinda menacing look.

I give this four stars because I love the series so much. I didn't give it 5 because they killed off a character from the series that I also loved as well.

3056118,4,B0010YVCAM,"Many have complained about just about everything about this movie. My opinion is this, (by the way i have also seen every movie and tv episode as well), the budget is the only issue. Mabey Two over the top acting performances, and a general lack of set quality. However, The story was fine, they did do some history flashbacks (someone reviewed that they didn't, false) that were not up to par with previous titles, this is where i again fall back to budget. Some ok fights, (the main villains movements tacky, budget issue) and otherwise good movie.

Conclusion,

If you are a TRUE ""Fan"" of the ""Highlander Story"" and you can tolerate a low budget film, then you should enjoy this title.

Just give it a chance and understand from the start that IT IS A LOW BUDGET FILM.

Now I really thought about this - and I cannot think of another way the story line could have possibly come to fruition, other than Duncan, the Immortal who cared for people as well as his fellow Immortals, to play out. He always wanted a child, was devastated when his two other true loves died, and of all the characters, he deserved his heart's desire. He deserved to be with the woman he loved and have an end in the future to his living - this immortality business made me really think how horrible that option would actually be. I agree this could have been fleshed out more, but all in all? I loved it. Now keep your internet rock-throwing to a minimum, please. I just changed the curve as far as the rating measurement.

I am a Highlander fan.

Not only am I a Highlander fan I have a 10th Anniversary Highlander jacket, I thought Duncan was the better McLeod because I liked the series so much (not that I had a problem with Conner), and I have more forgiveness for Highlander 2 (especially the Renegade version) than most people do and I found Highlander 3 genuinely enjoyable.

On to this movie.

This is one of the worst pieces of tripe I've ever watched in my entire life.  This is Troll 2, Megashark, and creature feature of the week BAD without the redeeming value of being so bad it's hilarious.  This is before being insulted at the fact it crapped all over the Highlander franchise.  Even without being a fan of the franchise it wasn't even good as a stand alone.

If I looked up in the sky and I saw the other planets as big as they were in this movie, first of all I would assume some how or another we were orbiting Jupiter, then I would worry about how long we had left to live because obviously either the outer planets were falling into the sun or we were getting hurled away from it.  What the hell were those communications devices?  Never was it explained just what the source was.  NOTHING WAS EXPLAINED.

The performers did what they could with what they were given, & the story line, while appearing dedicated to killing the franchise rather than rejuvenating it, is easy to follow.  The direction and cinematography however...

Many people have written about the poor special effects, the poor soundtrack, canned acting and such so I will not redouble their efforts.  I will just say that this movie is a WASTE of your money.  Watch it on television.  If you have to, rent it.  But if you've got an extra $15 to spend, give it to the Salvation Army or Good Will.  This movie just is so wretched that you will kick yourself for wasting the money that could otherwise help someone out, especially during the Christmas season.

So in closing, there's nothing about this movie that is worth $15 (plus shipping unless you are an Amazon Prime member like me) so rent it or watch it on TV (if you absolutely have to see it for some sense of closure that you won't really get...Believe Me!  I know!) or better yet, don't watch it at all as you will be much happier for NOT having seen it.  It was a waste of all the characters we came to love and the actors who played them and we shouldn't have to remember them this way.

This movie successfully destroys and ignores the entire mythology set up during both the movies and the series, and what few elements the movie did use of the original mythology, this film abused, pillaged and regurgitated. And that was when you could get a plot line out of this CGI-Action-Special Effects sandbox. This thing made Highlander 2 believable. It's one giant toilet flush of everything built out of the original movies and series. Even more so than EndGame, which had a tendency to screw with the plot lines, this one just murders them.

In what can only be considered a need for money, Adrian Paul reprises the role of Duncan Macloud in what must have been written by people who never saw any of the tv series or movies...or maybe they did and they wanted to truly kill it.

To be blunt, this movie is so bad, it should only be viewed by anyone who is addicted to the Highlander series and wants to find a way to break that addiction. This movie is like a drug user having such a bad delusion, that he'll never touch the stuff again.

SPOILER:  In this movie, Duncan becomes the last immortal when he kills the stupidest bad guy in the history of movies and Methos (who up until this movie was the oldest immortal ever, until here where we find a bunch older than him) sacrifices his own life, a move that anyone who has ever seen him even in ONE episode of Highlander will realize that this is completely out of character for him.

But that's not the worst part of this movie.

Duncan becomes the final immortal and we find out what the prize is...it's not ultimate power to run the world as we all thought, oh no no no...Duncan can now have babies.

Keep that in mind and see if you can ever watch another Highlander video again. The Four Horsemen, Connor, Kurrigan, Xavier St Cloud, ALL of it, all of the battles, every episode...it was all about who can get fertile sperm.

It was nice to see that Duncan's character continued where he left off in the series and continues his search & finds out who he really is, a member of the Clan MacLeod, who has a conscious and lives by it.",1230422400,9,912,4.419161676646707
3056146,1,B0010YVCAM,"This film was a travesty.  Thankfully I saw it on television and didn't have to pay to see it or I would have been really ticked off. I enjoyed the original Highlander movie and was a fan of the series thanks in large part to Adrian Paul and the rest of the tv cast.  The stories were interesting and I always enjoyed the flashbacks to Duncan's past.  There were also great guest stars like Roger Daltry.  This film contains NONE of the charm of either the original movie or the tv series.  The so called ""plot"" is incomprehensible and the special effects are laughable at best.  The only reason I can think any of the cast made this film was extreme financial distress!  Peter Wingfield was trying his best to breathe some life into this cinematic horror, but it was too far gone. Whoever wrote this piece of trash must have been under the influence of some type of mind altering substance.  This is truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I was very disappointed that such a great series ended so badly.",1230336000,4,1013,4.408602150537634

Here they had a movie franchise of very loyal fans that would have watched almost anything with the name *Highlander* attached to it.  Somehow, they managed to destroy that.  This movie might very well be the guide to how to destroy a movie cash-cow.

Since most of the people who have watched the last quartet of Highlander sequels are hardcore fans, it's no surprise that that's mostly who sought out the latest sequel.  And they decided, after a half dozen movies, to apparently target this movie towards people who know nothing about the Highlander story.  I liked the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Highlander/dp/B00005RYL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Highlander</a>&nbsp;but I am more of a casual fan.  Regardless, I can see where hard-core fans are coming from with their low ratings.

Recounting the plot is almost a complete waste of time.  Like all Highlander movies, the various immortals are in factions battling it out to be *the one*.  There are also some added story elements that involve the universe shifting for the ultimate showdown.  The story attempts to weave all the sub-plots of the prior movies and tie them all into the conclusion of the movie.

Part of the intrigue with the original movie was the mystery and magic surrounding the premise.  After all it is a fantasy movie, albeit one with a deeper premise than others.  Explaining why and how there are immortals and why they battle each other for power is a hard sell.  Leaving some of those things unsaid allowed fans to *fill in the blanks*.

Still, here not only have they decided to repeat lots of the back-story, to the point of nausea, they also decided that it was necessary to explain ALL the mysteries of the series and tie them in a neat little bow.

Overall they alienate core fans with this technique in two ways.  First of all, many of the details of the series seem to be contradicted by some of what is done to conclude this movie. And second of all, all of the joy and mystery of the franchise has been eliminated by an oversimplified ending.  But even still, getting there is not enjoyable because the dialogue and plot development are sub-par.

Another thing that makes this movie difficult to swallow are special effects that can only be described as lacking.  In fact, some of the make-up and costumes make some of these characters look more comical than immortal.  One of the characters (if you watch it, see if you can guess which one) looks as if he is wearing some kind of cheap wig.

Like I said, I liked the first Highlander, but wasn't a religious follower of all the sequels.  The whole ""There can be only one"" theme seems to contradict the idea of six sequels to me.  Still, some of those follow-up movies weren't bad, even with new actors and other changes. But this one almost feels like a completely different group of people were involved at every step of the process.

Conclusion

If you know nothing about Highlander or the back story and just want something to kill two hours with, this movie might satisfy your needs for mindless entertainment.  Those who are looking for unintended humor might find something to like here too, though it's not universally bad start to finish.

If you are demanding and picky with sci-fi or fantasy movies and frequently notice when mistakes make it harder for you to accept the fantasy, you will probably want to avoid this.  And if you are a die-hard fan of the Highlander series, you definitely want to avoid this one.  Though it might be tempting to see it, it will only upset you.

Seriously....anyone who says that this is a decent film does not know movies at all.  This is an abomination of the whole franchise.  I've watched better episodes from the TV series than this crap.  The sets were so corny and fake looking.  The budget must of been 3 million because that's what it looked like.  This movie was cheaply done and it shows in every aspect.  They should be ashamed of themselves for sending this rubbish to fans. I don't get it...it's 2008.  The old story is so outdated.  Here is a idea, REBOOT the character/franchise.  Start over and do an epic movie with good writers and a good budget.  Please, please do the first one over and start from there. WITH CONNER MACLEOD.

I only spent $1 to rent it, which was too much, not to mention 80 minutes of my life were wasted. If I owned this DVD, I would probably burn it and try hard to forget I ever watched it.  I thought Highlander the series, was a great show, with great storylines and outstanding actors and fight sequences.  This movie, lacking any quality, dosen't even resemble any of the previous episodes, except for misplaced dialog between the original characters of the series. Putting Duncan McCloed, Methos, and Joe Dawson in this movie setting and storyline, is like putting Clint Eastwood in a Conan the Barbarian Movie. This movie was so terrible, it may have destroyed the acting careers of otherwise excellent actors of the original series. Peter Windfield and Adrian Paul, what were you thinking... The Director should be shot, before he produces more crappy movies that may destroy the careers of otherwise good actors. The fight scenes in this movie were also terrible enough to be humorous.  Fights were show in fast motion that could only be described as Benny Hill meets the Albino from outer space. The ""bad guy"" known as the ""Guardian"" was so stupid, that I almost laughed myself into a comma watching him.  His scary calling card was ""Hellloooo"", WOW, how original! He talked like he just stepped off the short bus, and looked like a S&M Albino.  The storyline was so stale and uninteresting, that I almost fell asleep before half the movie was over.  I don't think the Director or writers of this movie ever saw a Highlander the Series episode ever, because Duncan and Methos were portrayed more like enemies, than good friends, and the storyline was like a cheap rip off of a already crappy movie called ""Highlander 2"". After watching this piece of trash, it almost ruins my opinions of the characters of the original highlander series, and makes me wish I could erase all memory of seeing the talented Adrian Paul, Peter Winfield, and Jim Byrnes trying to act through this unbearable, ridiculous, twisted lame excuse of a movie written and directed my untalented dullards.",1212710400,4,2230,4.794270833333333

A. Highlander: The Source

These are just a few of the many questions left unanswered:
Why was Duncan's estranged wife having ""visions"" of the Source?
Why was a cannibalistic gang of bikers and horseback riders living deep in the forest?
Why did the monks let the"" Jabba the Hut"" elder-monk-guy live with them in the inexplicably weird, over-guarded monastery?
After the villain broke Duncan's katana in half, why didn't' Duncan just get a new sword from one of the crazy sword-wielding monks?
Why did they bury Joe above ground, just outside the monastery door when there was a perfectly good cemetery nearby? (In fact, Joe died IN the cemetery.)
Why did the villain start singing ""Princes of the Universe""? WTF. Maybe he's a Queen fan?
Why oh WHY did they play a cheesy cover version of that song later in the film?!
When the band of immortals somehow managed to get to the island that Anna had seen in her visions, why was a crazy group of dudes trying to burn some middle aged businessman alive?
And how did the immortals get an SUV full of gas to drive around the strange island?
Why was the Source hanging out on the cannibal's island?
And last but not least....how did Immortals come to be? This question, supposedly the premise of the film, was never answered. We never did find out how the immortals were created.

Actually, it is possible that some of these questions were answered, but the film was so bad I frequently became distracted by more interesting things, such as burying my face in my hands out of the sheer embarrassment that I was watching this film to begin with.

It gets one star for two reasons:
1. I cannot give it less than one star.
2. The terribleness of this movie gives it the redeeming value of being a conversation piece. Hours of fun can be had with your friends ripping apart this film while laughing hysterically.",1211846400,6,2124,4.6436170212765955

I was excited, if a little worried. But it has Duncan and Methos so I thought, why worry? I should have, that's for sure.

I want my 86 minutes back. As much as I wanted to like this movie, I just can't. It may have been the 10 minute unexplained travel montage, or maybe the inexplicable apocalyptic setting, the strangley well-fed and groomed cannibals (on horseback!), or the astronomically! Impossible realignment of the solar system. Or the whack-job priest with the excessively gelled hair.

And there are are the inexplicable scenes! Things that don't make any sense, but are there for some reason. And I swear to you each scene seems like it's been taken from some other movie.

And, you know, since I'm a chick, I think to myself, at least I have Duncan and Methos eye-candy to look at...but NOPE. Duncan only sheds his shirt at the end, and only with his ""wife""--which seems so wrong to me.

It was entertaining, but only because we spent the incredibly painful and interminable 86 minutes skewering the movie in revenge. I wouldn't buy it unless I was an obsessive completist. Rent it if you have to, but don't make a special trip to the store, and don't get your hopes up.

The plot is terrible, the story lacking, the characters comical.  One of the immortals looks like the love child of Mathew modine and Jessica simpson (not kidding).  The special effects were shotty and looked like they were edited by a 3rd grader.  The protagonist's acting , make up, and complete appearance is sickening.

I sat through it only because I was in such slack jawed shock at the absolute substandard garbage that was on the screen, I was unable to reach the remote.  I commend the actors for their professionalism in not walking off the set, but I honestly wish they had.

In Summary:
If you missed Highlander the Source it was probably because it never made it to the big screen, it was for very good reasons.

If you watched Highlander the Source keep telling yourself that this horrible Highlander blasphemy NEVER happened!  Eventually you can forget it, but then you see an ad like this one and the pain returns.  This never happened.  This never happened.  This never happened.",1210291200,6,883,4.675324675324675

Now I'm not an expert on the Highlander movies, but every Highlander movie I've seen had flashbacks to the Highlands of Scottland where Connor and Duncan lived hundreds of years ago. I always thought that helped ground the movies and give reason to call it 'Highlander' in the first place.

The use of colors and the way scenes were framed made the whole movie feel alot like it was a living comic book, and the concept of The Source is basically that the history of the immortals had gotten lost in myth and the original intent for ""There can be only one"" wasn't to be the last immortal standing, but to be the only immortal to pass the test by the Source.

3056172,1,B0010YVCAM,"This has got to be one of the worst films ever made. It pains me to say it because I am a huge Highlander fan. The original film was a classic, and the second film we don't really acknowledge. The third film was decent, and the fourth was just okay. But this one...I'm embarassed that 'Highlander' is in the title.

Adrian Paul reprises his role of the Highlander Duncan MacLeod, who gave five (okay four good ones) seasons of stories to the character on ""Highlander: The Series."" What makes this movie so bad is the story, the effects, the acting, the visuals, pretty much just about everything. First of all, Highlander is about the sword. Half way through the movie Duncan tosses his sword aside and starts using two big knives to fight with instead. There was no point to this and it really made character cheap. When Joe Dawson is killed (a beloved character from the series), nobody really seems to care. There's no introduction to Joe, so if you haven't seen the series, you have no idea who this guy is and why it's important that he was killed.

The story takes place in this strange post apocalyptic future where a band of international immortals try to discover why they are immortal. When you can look up into the sky and actually see the solar system aligning, you know there's issues with the story. It seemed like the only point to this story was to find a loophole to allow Duncan MacLeod to have children. That's the only point to the entire story.

I could go on for days about how bad this film is, but why bother. Don't buy it, don't rent it, just get your fill of Highlander from all the other films (just watch #1 and #4) and hours of television and don't waste your time on this one.

Everyone who follows a television series wants an ending which explains what happens to all the characters. This does. It's wonderful to see Duncan McCloud of the clan McCloud win in the end.

The best part of of the series was, of course, the swordfights.  Rather than choreograph a fight here, they've elected to take a picture of the characters and jiggle it at high speed around the set.  Like seriously, I could make a better fight scene with my great-grandmother and a tortoise.

I swear, he looks just as good now as he did during the series. Gorgeous, amazing, I never get tired of looking at him AND he's a good actor - love it! And if you think Peter Wingfield in leather is something to look at, you haven't lived until you've seen him strapped to a table in his tighty whities on the late night erotica TV show ""Bliss"" - you can even buy the DVD's here on [...]. Check it out, you won't be disappointed.....

But I digress....

 First I have to say something about the music. I'm sorry to be cruel but it was awful! Who in their right mind would replace Queen with some bad (and I do mean B A D!) cover of ""Princes of the Universe?"" It's QUEEN for frak sake! I was screaming ""NO! NO! NO!"" at the screen. It was the beginning of the end unfortunately. I actually watched it to the end and despite a few glimmers of possibility, it did not get any better.

I think this film could have had some potential but it just didn't work for me at all. Maybe the editing is partially to blame but it seems to me they should have stuck closer to the mythology of the story they were trying to tell - namely, the hero's journey back to the ""source"" of the immortal's immortality. I feel like one of the problems centered around  the fact that several events/scenes in the movie seemed staged primarily for the fx opportunity but had absolutely nothing to do with the mythology. So, while the fx were cool, from a story perspective such scenes were empty and felt contrived. Add some bad music and you have a recipe for disaster on your hands.

I guess the bottom line is this: If you feel you must see this film, rent it. If you think you might watch it again, then go ahead and buy it. I will say there is a very nice tribute to William Panzer (one of the original producers of the movies and the series who died in 2007) in the bonus features that I found very heartfelt and moving. If you are a fan of the show you may enjoy watching that. As others have said however, the original Highlander movie and the TV series were truly first rate. The TV series especially was always extremely well done. If you want ""the goodness"" of the Highlander mythology, that's where you will find it.

I am giving this DVD 2 stars because the bonus features were worth watching....and while you have it rented you may decide to watch the film as well but don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed.",1207612800,2,2583,4.269938650306749
3056177,1,B0010YVCAM,"In late 2007, I was initially excited to find this direct-to-cable sequel on the Sci-Fi Channel to ""Highlander: The Series,"" with Adrian Paul (as MacLeod), Jim Byrnes (as Dawson), and Peter Wingfield (as Methos) all returning in their respective roles.  After both the box office failure of 2000's ""Highlander 4: Endgame,"" and Elizabeth Gracen's short-lived ""Highlander: The Raven"" tv series a decade ago, my curiosity was piqued to see how the ""Highlander"" franchise could be resurrected once more.

Suffice to say, I was very disappointed (but not surprised) by the wretched outcome.  While consistent with ""Highlander""'s big screen history of choppy rock video-style editing and at times poor storyline coherency, this fifth installment, unfortunately, hits a new all-time low for the 22-year old franchise in both categories.  I won't go into this abysmal film's failures to any great extent (as other reviewers already have done so well), but let me say that ""Highlander: The Source"" completely wasted the opportunity of renewing hope that Adrian Paul's character would still lead the franchise into the future.

Unfortunately, according to this movie, what the future really means is a cheap, dismal ""Road Warrior"" knock-off that abandons all of the previous swashbuckling grandeur, inventive time-traveling flashbacks, and exuberant romantic charm that creator Gregory Widen originally envisioned and which later made Adrian Paul's tv series endure for six years.  So why did the producers, including Mr. Paul, choose to pursue this radically different, albeit dubious, premise (i.e. ""Highlander"" meets ""Def-Con 4"")?

My guess is at least part of the answer can be found in the virtually constant darkness depicted in the film.  The darkness wasn't just for ambiance's sake; rather, it was supposed to help disguise the low budget and deficient production values (such as the grade-Z screenwriting).  The movie, as a result, comes off like a mindless, goth-violent video game that appeals only to hard-core fans of sci-fi/fantasy schlock.  Sadly, it also pretty much chokes the remaining life out of ""Highlander""'s rapidly dwindling fanbase.

Now, let me provide my take on the film's central theme: what really is the enigmatic source of immortality?  The film's final sequence is hardly a shocker, but presenting the idea of human reproduction as the ultimate answer reminded me of the mediocre 1989 ""Star Trek V""'s all too simplistic attempt to explain where God truly is.  In other words, it is beyond insulting to suggest to intelligent viewers that they don't already know the obvious ""source,"" but perhaps even more so, that the answer must still be spelled out for them.

In summation, I would have much preferred a direct continuation of ""Highlander 4: Endgame,"" or even an improved reworking of ""Highlander 2: The Quickening""'s futuristic world.  The poorly-produced fifth ""Highlander"" film instead, much like the gloomy future Earth it depicts, makes Duncan MacLeod's prospects for a sixth installment seem far more grim (whether he is played by Adrian Paul or a successor).  If this indeed the end for Duncan MacLeod, at least the producers finally allow him to embark on real life's greatest adventure (parenthood).

Movie Grade: F + (it seems fitting for what little spark this movie has).",1207440000,8,3310,5.322456813819578
3056178,1,B0010YVCAM,"This mess of a movie is a faux-cyberpunk version of the Highlander by way of a goth-metal adrenaline rush (throwing in some cannibals and Bugs Bunny routines for good measure). It comes to us from Lionsgate Films who have acquired the rights to the Highlander property and plan to use this movie as a starting point to relaunch the franchise. Based on what I've seen, though, it looks like they are more likely to sink it.

This movie was actually completed in 2006 and a rough copy circulated in Europe early in 2007 to harsh reviews. Lionsgate spent some time retooling the movie then decided to forgo a theatrical release and instead premiere it on the Sci Fi Channel as a ""Sci Fi Original Movie"" (in place of the usual Saturday night critters-on-the-rampage fare). I never saw the rough cut, but I can't imagine how it could have been much worse than what made it to the final version.

The movie takes place in the near future after civilization has collapsed. There is actually little elaboration on what brought about the collapse, this just provides the backdrop for several immortals' quest for the nebulous Source; supposedly the key to their power. Adrian Paul returns from the Highlander TV Series as Duncan MacLeod (and sleepwalks through the role) along with Peter Wingfield as Methos and Jim Byrnes as the Watcher Joe Dawson. They are joined by two immortals Zai Jie and Cardinal Giovanni as well as Duncan's latest girlfriend, Anna Teshemka. This group must do battle with another immortal, the Guardian, who I think is supposed to be guarding the Source and who looks like the cover of a bad heavy metal album come to life. The narrative of the movie is so disjointed and incoherent that I definitely lost track of the motivations driving each person to this Source thing. And by the end of the movie I didn't care and actually regretted my decision to stick it through to the ending credits.

The Highlander movies have actually been a mixed bag at best. Even the first movie which launched the franchise was only good not great. It was the television series, which ran in syndication for six years starring Adrian Paul, which best represented the franchise. Now, this new attempt to relaunch the Highlander series is equally as misguided as the sequel to the first movie, 1991's dreadful Highlander: The Quickening.

If you are jonesing for the adventures of the Duncan or Connor Macleod, go back and revisit the series or the first movie on DVD. But definitely don't waste your time with this poor excuse to milk a few more dollars out of the Highlander name.

All that I could think was that I was embarrassed for the people in the movie who had been a part of the previous shows/movies. I could not believe that none of the three of these people had the dignity to refuse to do such a horrible injustice to an otherwise great franchise. (excluding Highlander 2). Imagine my disappointment to note at the end of the movie that David Abramowitz was the writer and Adrian Paul one of the Executive Producers... I guess it just goes to show what people will do for money.

On a parallel note... I watched the commentary by Adrian Paul on the Highlander Episode - Prophecy, in which he said that he wished that they had not done the show because Highlander, while fiction, had always been based as much as possible in reality, and that episode delved into the realm of Fantasy. And yet he not only starred in, but produced this movie... Amazing.

3056193,1,B0010YVCAM,"There have been two really great parts to the whole Highlander franchise: the original movie, and the TV series (especially from its second season on, when they introduced the concept of the Watcher organization, and wrote stories about a subgroup of Watcher who developed a religious fanatic-type fear and hatred of immortals, and started hunting them).  Both these version of the Highlander franchise featured great characters, marvellous flashbacks, interesting villains, and dealt with both the positive and negative aspects of immortality, such as unending youth and strength, and the experience of being able to see whole different ages, such as most people can only dream about, balanced off against the loneliness of watching everyone around you age and die, with only a handful of people with whom you can form lasting bonds -- and many of them are out to take your head.  It was thrilling stuff, and as the first movie and series proved, this concept was a rich source from which really great stories could be mined again and again.

How sad then that with the exception of that first film, the makers of Highlander movies have failed so dismally.  This movie actually rivals ""Highlander II: the Quickening"" in sheer awfulness, and I hadn't believed that possible.  I had a terrible sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach when I found that this movie was set in a near future where society had broken down into chaos and anarchy.  Why on earth did the producers of this film choose to borrow an element from the worst movie in the entire franchise?  The villain was so ridiculous he wasn't even remotely menacing or scary.  What could EVER make anyone think a villain who yells ""Helloo Joe!"" as he sails through the air hit by a car (in a stupendously unrealistic stunt/special effect) would play well?  This was just one moment among many involving the villain that elicits unintentional laughter.  The guardian was so horrendously, cringe-inducingly bad that if the Kurgan were in this film he would have killed him for bringing villains into disrepute.

And of course, on top of a poor story, a laughable villain, and the complete absence of any of the elements that made either the first film or the series a success, this movie suffers from a fault common to all Highlander films but the first: lack of continuity.  Why, if they are going to make these things, do they insist on disregarding everything that came before?  This is really frustrating to those fans who have delved into the world of the Highlander franchise and would like it to make at least some sense, and have some internal consistency.  It's hard to stay interesting in something when they keep changing the ground rules on you.

But the above listed flaws barely scratch the surface of what it wrong with this movie.  I read that this was intended to be the first of a trilogy.  All I can say to that is that I hope not.  As much as I am irritated at the lack of consistency and continuity in the Highlander movies, if they're going to do any more, they need to retcon this abortion out of existence.  Having inexplicably copied concepts from the single worse installment of the whole franchise, they should also copy the follow up taken to that movie by the producers of the next one and write a new story that ignores this steaming pile of dog excrement and starts with a blank slate.",1204416000,58,3373,4.74486301369863

3056195,4,B0010YVCAM,"""Highlander: The Source"" is the latest installment in what has been a hit-and-miss film franchise. This film finds immortal Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul of the ""Highlander"" TV series) and a band of Immortal warriors on a quest to find the Holy Grail of Immortality. It was originally intended as the first of a trilogy of films detailing the origins of the Immortals.
The film as presented on this DVD is a decent effort. The plot and story are interesting, the acting is fine, and the visual effects are great. What messes the film up is the editing. This 86-minute version takes  a number of scenes out of the 94-minute Russian version, and those scenes are sorely missed. However, the interesting story elements and performances make up for a lot.
As a ""Highlander"" fan, I enjoyed ""The Source,"" even though it is far from a perfect film. Hopefully, this will not be the final nail in the coffin for this franchise. While most fans will find it disappointing, it is definitely a unique and fascinating entry into the series.

3056200,1,B0010YVCAM,"The Highlander movies have always been something of a crapshoot. The first one was a classic. The second one was universally panned. The third you either loved it or hated it.

The fourth (Endgame) was probably the only sequel that many would agree as being worthy of the original. At the very least it was better than the other sequels and seemed to get the movie's back on track to being something that's worthwhile.

Unfortunately, The Source is a drastic step back. I would dare to say that it's even worse than Highlander 2 (a movie that I myself gave one star to in my review only because Amazon doesn't allow for less).

What made this movie so bad that I would rate it as being worse than even the most panned Highlander film ever created?

The photography has the color washed out much in the style of Crow II City of Angels. It's very hard to look at and gave me a headache just looking at it.

The action just didn't work well. Most of the scenes with the Guardian were cat and mouse (pounce you're dead) scenes that had very little actual fighting. The few scenes that had actual sword fighting were mostly obscured in odd special effects that made the actors look like they were zipping around all over the place when in reality they were standing static with only the minimum of arm movement.

This is a movie franchise that is based in sword fighting. The sword fighting should be well-choreographed fights that thrill the audience, not static shots with shadow trails that give the illusion of movement.

The plot was also thin. It amounted to `follow her, she knows where to go.' `Let's go here.' Fight sequence. `Let's go here.' Fight sequence. Rinse, lather, repeat. You needn't worry about too many spoilers, because that's the whole movie right there.

I was really hoping I'd enjoy this. After Highlander Endgame, I honestly thought that the franchise was finally going somewhere I could appreciate. But then they follow it up with this.

Let's put it this way: VFX Magazine named Highlander 2 (both version) as the ""worst sequel ever made""-and it was by a landslide too, folks.  That is how bad that movie was.  This movie makes that one look like an Oscar caliber masterpiece.

Apparently, someone watched the Underworld movies and thought using blue lenses to add ""effect"" was a great idea.  No, it wasn't.  Someone else thought it was a brilliant idea to completely screw up the whole myth of the Immortals and make the story look more idiotic and contrived.  No, it wasn't.

This movie was so horrid I couldn't believe I sat through the last half hour and then I couldn't believe that I actually turned it back on and watched the rest of it off and on through increments and didn't threaten to sue SciFi for stealing two hours of my life.  Not even Methos could save this movie-and he made Endgame (or at least his part in Endgame) watchable.  Methos could make just about anything Highlander related watchable (you can tell I liked him from the show).  That is how much this movie sucked.  It was so bad that I could write better-someone who has no real training in creative writing and never worked in any sort of entertainment industry who could put out better material than the two writers who actually got paid to do so instead of being fired out of a cannon and into the sun like they should have been.

If anyone can ask how the hell this even got developed and not laugh, I would actually care to know.  I doubt anyone can actually answer, that's how bad it is.  If they do bring back the series, at least stay away from the MacLeods next time.  Their story became dead and buried with Connor.

The protagonist is himself immortal and gets to live indefinitely provided his head is not lopped by a fellow Immortal as these are destined to battle until there is a sole survivor among them as the catch phrase reminds the viewer ""In the end there can be only one.""

This convoluted story delivers none of that as the Source does not necessarily refer to origins.

Though Highlander: The Source ultimately falls short in terms of the story, these shortcomings are compounded by the atrocious cinematography.  Though broadcast in the early to mid 90's, the old Highlander TV series had better quality effects than the latest film in the series.

For example, central to the milieu  of the Highlander saga is the transfer of the quickening from the Immortal that has lost his head to the Immortal that has taken it.  In the TV series, this was depicted by an impressive display of lightening bolts and electric shocks.

However, in The Source, these scenes are not nearly as impressive.  The electric charges are now less distinctive artistically with the emphasis now on the head rolling away, something that was only alluded to and seldom seen in the older episodes.

Relatedly, in the TV series, the sword fights leading up to this dramatic exchange of life force were often depicted as elegant, almost dance-like encounters.  However, in Highlander: The Source, these are now filmed with the same herky-jerky camera action used in many productions today such as the new Battlestar Galactica where viewers almost come away nauseated because the directors think they are too good to shoot images with a steady, smooth hand.

Highlander: The Source is such a disappointment that, if one did happen to be an Immortal, one might just very well be tempted to slit one's own throat than rather spend an eternity watching this movie for an eternity.

3056211,1,B0010YVCAM,I love Highlander.  Loved the TV shows and all the movies....until this one.  It was so painful watching this movie (on Sci Fi network) that I almost cried.  It felt as if I had undergone a trauma that I wished I could somehow forget but knew it would leave a lasting scar.,1203465600,3,273,4.211538461538462
3056212,1,B0010YVCAM,"What can I say. When you are correct, you are correct. This was one of Sci-fi' network's Sat Nite 'doom & disaster' movies, and I also want the 2 hours of my life I wasted on watching this film, hoping it would 'get better' back.

(BTW_ I liked Highlander 2- You will never get a better villain than Michael Ironside)

 This movie, no, do not waste your money. It was ... we have to invent new adjectives to describe how awful this movie is; worse than 'ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES'.

Most fans of the Highlander and ADrian Paul were appalled at how much of the legend got 'trashed' for this dreck. And, the worst part, ((Spoiler ALert)

THEY KILL OFF JOE!!  Badly

(Hey, all 'mortal'characters 'die', only 'immortals' have a shot at 'forever'; that is the premise of Highlander. But to 'kill' a beloved character without at least giving him/her a 'good death scene'... intolerable)

Stay away from this one",1203033600,3,909,4.60248447204969
3056213,1,B0010YVCAM,"I've got to be honest with you, i'm still on the fence as to whether this movie sucked or was actually decent.  I know one thing for sure though, there are many episodes from the series that were better than this film.  BUT with that being said, I get what the producers were trying to do by taking the HIGHLANDER mythology into a different direction.  I mean with all the stories that take place in the highlander mythos, it seems to me that with the exception of HIGHLANDER VENGEANCE, the highlander stories that take place in the future do not really do so well...Example?  Highlander 2! Highlander The Source, even the idea for shooting the sixth season taking place in the future was scrapped.  Although it looks good on paper, people don't seem to be interested on the life of an immortal living in the future.  We only care about their lives in the present or their place during history.  Anyway, I'm probably not gonna buy this dvd, cause I'm sure theres going to be a new cut coming out within the year or near FUTURE.  The story was mildly interesting, but if they continue with the two sequels after this, I might appreciate this film more.  But they need to hire some better writers...I mean, honestly im sure any real FAN could have done a better job.  The action was blah compared to ENDGAME.  There was too much with too little significance going on.  and... yea let's not talk about the ending cause i don't want to spoil it for anyone.  I did enjoy seeing Methos and Duncan on screen again.  People talk about how there shouldnt be any more cause it gets worse everytime.  But! I feel that we have to have another one...a REAL GOOD ONE to make up for the last....4 movies and Highlander the Raven....and dare i say it? the Animated series as well hahaha.  ""Live, Grow Stronger, Fight Another day"" this is the highlander way!  So PRODUCERS IF YOU READ THIS...PLEASE do something right for once!!!",1202947200,,1912,4.543859649122807

As a fan of the entire Highlander series (movie and tv), this ""movie (if one can really call it that)"" is easily the worst thing that could have happened.  I could not erase it from my DVR fast enough.  As others before me have said, this movie makes the original cut of Highlander 2 look like the greatest thing on Earth.  I certainly hope that if they plan on making another film and follow the story the set in the Source, the strongly reconcider and let the franchise die in peace.  That would be the most humane thing that the producers could do for the loyal fans of the series and for the fine actors that that brought the characters we followed to life.

I had to force myself to watch this and I did not feel like I was watching Highlander. Princes of the Universe was a remake, there were no flashbacks and the Guardian was just plain bad.  We learned that the girl from Highlander The End died and Duncan is depressed because he is tired of loosing everyone he loves. There is not one thing I could find about this movie to redem the movie which is really sad considering how much of a Highlander fan I am.

I don't know what people expected from it, and let me tell you I was pleasantly surprised, but this movie was pretty good for being a made for TV movie.  By far it was not as good as the series, and maybe not as good as Highlander I or III, but it definitely beats out II and IV, and the explanation of where Immortals come from is marginally more plausible then it was in II (which isn't hard).  Additionally, with the way the 6th season of Highlander was, the journey's of Duncan MacLeod are going alot better.
This movie is just getting a bad rap cause any movie that tries to change the course of a franchise this much always does.  Take Star Trek for example, the first movie was radically different from the series and ok, so they took what worked for that movie and brought back some of the old stuff that worked from the TV show getting rid of what didn't work in both.  Maybe they will do that here, take what works and move on discarding what doesnt.",1200787200,5,1055,4.2288557213930345

3056240,1,B0010YVCAM,"If you thought the original cut of Highlander II was bad, just wait until you see Highlander: The Source, the fifth (and hopefully final) installment in the beloved series.  The Source begins sometime in the distant future (*yawn*) as Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul), Methos (Peter Wingfield), Duncan's ex-wife Anna (Thekla Reuten), Joe Dawson (Jim Byrnes), and a small band of immortals seek out ""the source"", which is said to be the origin place of the immortals.  Standing in their way is the demonic Guardian (Cristian Solimeno), who is supposedly an all-powerful immortal that picks off our heroes one by one, leading to the inevitable showdown between him and Duncan.  What ends up being the most infuriating about The Source for Highlander fans is how much the film ends up going against the mythology of the series, as well as Duncan and other character's motivations for seeking out ""the source"".  The Jabba the Hutt lookalike in the film doesn't exactly help things out either, and the film as a whole is just one big jumbled mess, thanks to the lackluster, sloppily edited direction from Brett Leonard (Lawnmower Man, Man-Thing), and a cover-themed edition of the original Highlander soundtrack to boot (the version of ""Who Wants to Live Forever?"" is more annoying than anything else) just all amount to the worst sequel the series has ever seen.  Adrian Paul seems to sleep through the film, and the ending is, well, see it for yourself if you're a Highlander fan, and decide which part of the film is the worst.  All in all, Highlander: The Source is beyond bad, and no matter how much of a Highlander fan you may be, this should be avoided.  If you are a fan though, you'll more than likely want to check this out anyway, but don't say I you hadn't been warned.",1200700800,96,1772,4.771241830065359

That being said, it really hurts me to give this film one star but I have to because that's all it deserves! I saw this on Sci-Fi and it nearly put me to sleep. When I went back and looked at it later, I could find nothing redeeming about it! I have underwear that's made of better material than this movie!

Let me put it another way. Highlander 2, the original cut with the planet Zeist, was better than this! That's how much The Source sucked! At least H2 had better action, a better villian and had the great Sean Connery as Ramirez to off-set an otherwise terrible film! In the words of David Chappelle, it sucked a**!

You are hearing this from someone who was an intense fan of the original movie, the television series, the third film and even gave Endgame (the fourth film) a chance. I hated that as well, but -NOTHING- and I mean NOTHING compares to how bad this is. This awful, wretched, steaming pile of waste makes even Endgame look like a viable film.

I cannot believe, for a second, that the actors agreed to this and let themselves be humiliated in this farce of a film. The director and producers should be strung up for this, if not worse. I cannot believe they are thinking of doing this as a trilogy and I hope, sincerely hope, that it doesn't ever go further. Highlander needs to be allowed to die off, because it seems the movies are getting worse and worse.

Please, please please do not buy this. Do not encourage them to produce more of this garbage and destroy the Highlander mythology and characters even further. What else can I say? If you like Highlander, do NOT buy this movie, because it will ruin it for you. It is beyond bad, it is beyond awful, it is something altogether wretched and vile. You will cry at how bad this movie is, so spare yourself the misery.

The main villain was a bit cheesy and slightly confusing but I didn't watch it for him since it's a well known fact that the villain will always die in the end. There were some good scenes and I think the end allows for a continuation since the movie's website said this was the 1st of a trilogy. We'll see.,1198627200,6,556,4.205607476635514

I still have trouble believing this was made...oh wait I forgot (see my first comment in this review).

The character of ""Joe Dawson"" (played by Jim Brynes) was the luckiest person in this movie. He died. All of the other actors probably wish they had, especially as the sheer inanity of this blatant exploitation tasked the endurance of even the most faithful of Highlanders legions of fans. Of which I still count myself. I can't even see this movie enjoying ""campy movie"" status of Highlander III. I guess I can survive this.

I was so excited to see a new Highlander movie, though in reality I didn't expect much. Unfortunately, its every bit as bad and even far worse than Highlander 2. The story line is dreadful and (like the other movies) changes previous events. But in all, I think the main problem I have with the movie is the fight scenes. I mean, why did the creators all of a sudden decide to make everyone fight in super speed with ridiculous sound effects? This movie is absolutely horrid in pretty much every way possible.

So a couple months later the dutch cut of this movie premiered on the sci fi channel on september 15th. It was basically identical to the russian cut with very little editing. THe thing that hurt this film the most is its story line, Editing, quality, Dialogue, This film is missing so much. It makes the previous highlander movie Endgame look like a master piece.

I'm happy to say I saw it years ago after it first came out and I've pretty much blocked it out of my memory entirely.  It was that traumatic.  Do yourself a favor and just pop an episode from the TV series into your DVD player, blue-ray or whatever.  But avoid this film at all costs.",1425168000,2,660,4.589743589743589

3290579,2,B0010YVCAM,"A long time fan of the highlander theme. I say theme because I love the concept and the 1st movie really did set the tone (even if the acting wasn't anything special and the sword fights were just okay if you compare them to the later Highlander TV Series sword fights) and then you have the awesome unoffical soundtrack with all those great songs from Queen that were written perfectly for the movie and then also as the theme song for Highlander TV series. Having said that the 1st movie really was great as a mid 1980s cult classic type of movie. Then the tv series came upon us giving us Duncan Macleod in all his glory for 5.33 seasons. Sure they played loose with some of the rules and went a little overboard with the watchers death squad who ""only watch and never interfere"" LOL and yes I said 5.33 seasons bc about 1/3 of season 6 was at least average quality episodes and then 1/3 of season 6 was a great way defy the whole tone of over 100 episodes in those 5 past seasons and a way to piss off Highlander fans and a craptastic way to end a great TV series. Then the other 1/3 of season 6 was the female audition for the spin off Highlander The Raven which was a horrible idea and of course none of the leading ladies in those episodes connected with the audience like Amada did, who ended up taking the lead for the 1st and only season of Highlander The Raven. I think it partially failed bc fans were so pissed off at the why Highlander season 6 went that they just said forget it Im not gonna continue with this.

Now back to the Highlander movies. So you have a terrible couple of movies after the original Highlander but still if you're a fan once they put out the renegade version of the 2nd movie things started to look a little better and flow more with the true tone of Highlander's great ""theme."" Then comes The Source. While the acting is ok for this budget and type of movie the darkness/horror type theme to it, overboard un-relateable characters and the HORRIBLE storyline/ending really take it out of line with everything that the fans loved about the 1st movie and the TV series. The sword fighting/quickenings and so forth aren't too bad but nothing could save this movie from the crappy plot and a ending that just made me sick to my stomach as a Highlander fan. Its worth a 1 time watch for any Highlander fan just for the action/fights/quickenings but after that try to erase it from your memory just like you erased the planet Zeist from your memory.

I hope one day that some bigtime producer/writer/director revisits the original move and decides to reboot the whole thing and start from scratch. How I would do it would be to do a trilogy starting off with a movie about the Kurgan and his life starting out showing how he got to be the way he was taking some heads and having flash backs etc then part 2 and 3 is a remake of the classic cut into 2 movies where the final battle is the true ending of the trilogy where Connor defeats the Kurgan and takes the prize which is left at that no explanation needed as I think the prize is something that should never be fully explained and left at the way Ramirez described it.",1415145600,,3156,4.338409475465313

If they were going to come out with such a bad product why didn't they just end it with Endgame!  Now that would have been a good time to end it.  2014 Update:  The problem with this film and this is coming from a fan that has seen every episode of the series and every film multiple times, yes including Highlander II, is honestly it feels like a really low budget version of Highlander, it just feels really cheap.  From the story line, the effects, the acting, but most importantly the last 3 minutes or so of the film, I still don't know what to say about the image of Anna's fetus right before the end credits. I think I understand what they were trying to do, they were trying to put Highlander in the context of modern day considering for the first time there are no flashbacks from historical times that most Highlander fans love instead the whole story takes place in this dystopian future, sort of like Highlander II only without the blaster guns.  In retrospect personally I thought Adrian Paul did a great job in this movie.  Paul, Wingfield, and Byrnes returning to their roles from the television series was pretty much the only reason why I put myself through this movie a second time.

This movie is nothing but plot holes, and terrible acting.
The guardian has been asleep for a long time- but makes corny one-liner references to the modern era- like singing the line ""who wants to live forever"" (a song in the tv show) after he kills Joe in the cemetery?
Maybe this movie could have been saved if the Guardian hadn't been such a joke...but probably not.
The common complaint about the prize, isn't actually all that far off from the original movie. That's what Conner's prize was too, ""mortality"". As I've always understood it, the winner of the prize gets what they desire most. For Duncan it's the ability to make babies. For an immortal like Jacob Kell, it's something else.

-I thought this film filled in gaps that Highlander fans wanted to know. The highland characters we know and love did a good job in their roles.

Personal view:
- This is not the way I thought they would fill in questions on the ""Immortals"" but never the less it was a very good movie and I give it an ""A"" grade. This could have been an A+ but about 3 of characters that are writen into the movie have weak roles and thought they should have had stronger characters presence over all.

Cons:
- Unless you watch the other movies and the series (mainly the movies) you may miss out on key knowledge and history of the Highlander character.
- This is only a con because I watched it twice and unless you pay attenion to the darker character role you may miss on the real purpose of his role.",1378339200,,794,4.217105263157895

SPOILERS AHEAD!

I'm gonna start by saying that I've only ever seen the first Highlander film all the way through. The other movies I've seen major scenes of and can safely say they aren't all that good. I still need to check out the TV series, as I hear it' s fun cheesy 90's show. I can say that I am a big fan of the first Highlander movie. It's not a perfect film by any means, but it's still a fun fantasy action movie. It helps that the story keeps it pretty simple and doesn't go into where the immortals come from (we've seen what happens when they try to explain where they came from). And while it gives me a chuckle to see Sean Connery playing an Egyptian who's pretending to be Spanish, and then we got French actor Christopher Lambert trying to do a Scottish Accent the movie still has a lot of heart to it. Part of that not only comes from the writing, but also the wonderful direction by Russell Mulcahy, and overall good performances by the cast (and we can all agree that Clancy Brown as the Kurgen is one of the most entertaining movie villains).

And then there is The Source...

What in God's holy name where these people thinking!? Seriously! It's as if they watched the original movies, hated it, and wanted to do all they could to drag it through the grime of the earth! I know so many others have said something like this, but I just had to vent my frustrations of how awful this movie is. Nothing about it makes sense! The whole planets coming so close to the earth is laughable, and it would cause horrific things to happen with this many planets that close to us. The acting is...uhhhhhhhggggg! The two worst characters in this entire mess are of course the Guardian and the priest guy Giovanni. Both have their own stupid look (Giovanni with his weird slicked hair and the Guardian who looks like Krato's retarded brother) and then there's just their personalities. First you go the Guardian, who is the least intimidating villain I have ever seen! He just mugs at the camera and says stupid one liners. Seriously, Jacob Kell was a better villain if only for the fact of how unintentionally hilarious Bruce Payne is. Giovanni is just an idiot! He is this cliched man of the cloth, talking about the newly mortal immortals dying because their faith isn't pure! Nothing against faith, but these are guys who know that non Catholic immortals have roamed the earth for eons now. The character Methos was one of the four horseman of the apocalypse! This whole ""He didn't heal because his faith wasn't pure"" just doesn't make sense in context with this series. The whole post apocalyptic setting just adds nothing to the story and the cannibal sub plot sounds like it would've made for a better movie. And I don't need to go into the raping of the Queen songs.

And the ending is the most insulting of all! The prize is to have babies!? Sure, making life is all fine and dandy, but it is so empty and hallow in this situation. It's especially hallow when the character of Anna had no development and you never once cared if Duncan and her lived happily ever after. That they make it so all the fighting and sacrificing was totally pointless! That apparently it was all about just being pure of heart and some other Care Bears nonsense. There's also the fact that this Source was never mentioned in any of the movies or in the entire six year run of the TV show (I may have not seen the show yet, but I know that this whole finding the Source was made up for this pile of puke). And apparently this whole thing was meant to be a trilogy! But thank God it doesn't seem to be happening; I think the producers of this knew that the fans would riot if they tried to make it.

Do yourself a favor folks, stick with the first movie and the TV series (most say the third isn't so bad as it's more a remake). I also hear the anime movie isn't too bad.",1370044800,3,4025,4.338645418326693

Now I really thought about this - and I cannot think of another way the story line could have possibly come to fruition, other than Duncan, the Immortal who cared for people as well as his fellow Immortals, to play out. He always wanted a child, was devastated when his two other true loves died, and of all the characters, he deserved his heart's desire. He deserved to be with the woman he loved and have an end in the future to his living - this immortality business made me really think how horrible that option would actually be.

Many people have written about the poor special effects, the poor soundtrack, canned acting and such so I will not redouble their efforts.  I will just say that this movie is a WASTE of your money.  Watch it on television.  If you have to, rent it.  But if you've got an extra $15 to spend, give it to the Salvation Army or Good Will.  This movie just is so wretched that you will kick yourself for wasting the money that could otherwise help someone out, especially during the Christmas season.

So in closing, there's nothing about this movie that is worth $15 (plus shipping unless you are an Amazon Prime member like me) so rent it or watch it on TV (if you absolutely have to see it for some sense of closure that you won't really get...Believe Me!  I know!) or better yet, don't watch it at all as you will be much happier for NOT having seen it.  It was a waste of all the characters we came to love and the actors who played them and we shouldn't have to remember them this way.

This movie successfully destroys and ignores the entire mythology set up during both the movies and the series, and what few elements the movie did use of the original mythology, this film abused, pillaged and regurgitated. And that was when you could get a plot line out of this CGI-Action-Special Effects sandbox. This thing made Highlander 2 believable. It's one giant toilet flush of everything built out of the original movies and series. Even more so than EndGame, which had a tendency to screw with the plot lines, this one just murders them.

In what can only be considered a need for money, Adrian Paul reprises the role of Duncan Macloud in what must have been written by people who never saw any of the tv series or movies...or maybe they did and they wanted to truly kill it.

To be blunt, this movie is so bad, it should only be viewed by anyone who is addicted to the Highlander series and wants to find a way to break that addiction. This movie is like a drug user having such a bad delusion, that he'll never touch the stuff again.

SPOILER:  In this movie, Duncan becomes the last immortal when he kills the stupidest bad guy in the history of movies and Methos (who up until this movie was the oldest immortal ever, until here where we find a bunch older than him) sacrifices his own life, a move that anyone who has ever seen him even in ONE episode of Highlander will realize that this is completely out of character for him.

But that's not the worst part of this movie.

Duncan becomes the final immortal and we find out what the prize is...it's not ultimate power to run the world as we all thought, oh no no no...Duncan can now have babies.

Keep that in mind and see if you can ever watch another Highlander video again. The Four Horsemen, Connor, Kurrigan, Xavier St Cloud, ALL of it, all of the battles, every episode...it was all about who can get fertile sperm.

Here they had a movie franchise of very loyal fans that would have watched almost anything with the name *Highlander* attached to it.  Somehow, they managed to destroy that.  This movie might very well be the guide to how to destroy a movie cash-cow.

Since most of the people who have watched the last quartet of Highlander sequels are hardcore fans, it's no surprise that that's mostly who sought out the latest sequel.  And they decided, after a half dozen movies, to apparently target this movie towards people who know nothing about the Highlander story.  I liked the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Highlander/dp/B00005RYL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Highlander</a>&nbsp;but I am more of a casual fan.  Regardless, I can see where hard-core fans are coming from with their low ratings.

Recounting the plot is almost a complete waste of time.  Like all Highlander movies, the various immortals are in factions battling it out to be *the one*.  There are also some added story elements that involve the universe shifting for the ultimate showdown.  The story attempts to weave all the sub-plots of the prior movies and tie them all into the conclusion of the movie.

Part of the intrigue with the original movie was the mystery and magic surrounding the premise.  After all it is a fantasy movie, albeit one with a deeper premise than others.  Explaining why and how there are immortals and why they battle each other for power is a hard sell.  Leaving some of those things unsaid allowed fans to *fill in the blanks*.

Still, here not only have they decided to repeat lots of the back-story, to the point of nausea, they also decided that it was necessary to explain ALL the mysteries of the series and tie them in a neat little bow.

Overall they alienate core fans with this technique in two ways.  First of all, many of the details of the series seem to be contradicted by some of what is done to conclude this movie. And second of all, all of the joy and mystery of the franchise has been eliminated by an oversimplified ending.  But even still, getting there is not enjoyable because the dialogue and plot development are sub-par.

Another thing that makes this movie difficult to swallow are special effects that can only be described as lacking.  In fact, some of the make-up and costumes make some of these characters look more comical than immortal.  One of the characters (if you watch it, see if you can guess which one) looks as if he is wearing some kind of cheap wig.

Like I said, I liked the first Highlander, but wasn't a religious follower of all the sequels.  The whole ""There can be only one"" theme seems to contradict the idea of six sequels to me.  Still, some of those follow-up movies weren't bad, even with new actors and other changes. But this one almost feels like a completely different group of people were involved at every step of the process.

Conclusion

If you know nothing about Highlander or the back story and just want something to kill two hours with, this movie might satisfy your needs for mindless entertainment.  Those who are looking for unintended humor might find something to like here too, though it's not universally bad start to finish.

If you are demanding and picky with sci-fi or fantasy movies and frequently notice when mistakes make it harder for you to accept the fantasy, you will probably want to avoid this.  And if you are a die-hard fan of the Highlander series, you definitely want to avoid this one.  Though it might be tempting to see it, it will only upset you.

After the villain broke Duncan's katana in half, why didn't' Duncan just get a new sword from one of the crazy sword-wielding monks?
Why did they bury Joe above ground, just outside the monastery door when there was a perfectly good cemetery nearby? (In fact, Joe died IN the cemetery.)
Why did the villain start singing ""Princes of the Universe""? WTF. Maybe he's a Queen fan?
Why oh WHY did they play a cheesy cover version of that song later in the film?!
When the band of immortals somehow managed to get to the island that Anna had seen in her visions, why was a crazy group of dudes trying to burn some middle aged businessman alive?
And how did the immortals get an SUV full of gas to drive around the strange island?
Why was the Source hanging out on the cannibal's island?
And last but not least....how did Immortals come to be? This question, supposedly the premise of the film, was never answered. We never did find out how the immortals were created.

Actually, it is possible that some of these questions were answered, but the film was so bad I frequently became distracted by more interesting things, such as burying my face in my hands out of the sheer embarrassment that I was watching this film to begin with.

It gets one star for two reasons:
1. I cannot give it less than one star.
2. The terribleness of this movie gives it the redeeming value of being a conversation piece. Hours of fun can be had with your friends ripping apart this film while laughing hysterically.",1211846400,6,2124,4.6436170212765955

I was excited, if a little worried. But it has Duncan and Methos so I thought, why worry? I should have, that's for sure.

I want my 86 minutes back. As much as I wanted to like this movie, I just can't. It may have been the 10 minute unexplained travel montage, or maybe the inexplicable apocalyptic setting, the strangley well-fed and groomed cannibals (on horseback!), or the astronomically! Impossible realignment of the solar system. Or the whack-job priest with the excessively gelled hair.

And there are are the inexplicable scenes! Things that don't make any sense, but are there for some reason. And I swear to you each scene seems like it's been taken from some other movie.

And, you know, since I'm a chick, I think to myself, at least I have Duncan and Methos eye-candy to look at...but NOPE. Duncan only sheds his shirt at the end, and only with his ""wife""--which seems so wrong to me.

It was entertaining, but only because we spent the incredibly painful and interminable 86 minutes skewering the movie in revenge. I wouldn't buy it unless I was an obsessive completist. Rent it if you have to, but don't make a special trip to the store, and don't get your hopes up.

And to think I gave up 86 minutes of my life for that. Instead of this drivel, I should have just bought the first few seasons of the series.",1211673600,3,1547,4.448763250883392

The plot is terrible, the story lacking, the characters comical.  One of the immortals looks like the love child of Mathew modine and Jessica simpson (not kidding).  The special effects were shotty and looked like they were edited by a 3rd grader.  The protagonist's acting , make up, and complete appearance is sickening.  No wonder Bill Panzer died before this movie was aired.

I sat through it only because I was in such slack jawed shock at the absolute substandard garbage that was on the screen, I was unable to reach the remote.  I commend the actors for their professionalism in not walking off the set, but I honestly wish they had.

In Summary:
If you missed Highlander the Source it was probably because it never made it to the big screen, it was for very good reasons.

Now I'm not an expert on the Highlander movies, but every Highlander movie I've seen had flashbacks to the Highlands of Scottland where Connor and Duncan lived hundreds of years ago. I always thought that helped ground the movies and give reason to call it 'Highlander' in the first place.

The use of colors and the way scenes were framed made the whole movie feel alot like it was a living comic book, and the concept of The Source is basically that the history of the immortals had gotten lost in myth and the original intent for ""There can be only one"" wasn't to be the last immortal standing, but to be the only immortal to pass the test by the Source. But even withsuch a seemingly good concept and visual style the producers used poor execution.",1210291200,,968,4.494318181818182

3290669,1,B0010YVCAM,"This has got to be one of the worst films ever made. It pains me to say it because I am a huge Highlander fan. The original film was a classic, and the second film we don't really acknowledge. The third film was decent, and the fourth was just okay. But this one...I'm embarassed that 'Highlander' is in the title.

Adrian Paul reprises his role of the Highlander Duncan MacLeod, who gave five (okay four good ones) seasons of stories to the character on ""Highlander: The Series."" What makes this movie so bad is the story, the effects, the acting, the visuals, pretty much just about everything. First of all, Highlander is about the sword. Half way through the movie Duncan tosses his sword aside and starts using two big knives to fight with instead. There was no point to this and it really made character cheap. When Joe Dawson is killed (a beloved character from the series), nobody really seems to care. There's no introduction to Joe, so if you haven't seen the series, you have no idea who this guy is and why it's important that he was killed.

The story takes place in this strange post apocalyptic future where a band of international immortals try to discover why they are immortal. When you can look up into the sky and actually see the solar system aligning, you know there's issues with the story. It seemed like the only point to this story was to find a loophole to allow Duncan MacLeod to have children. That's the only point to the entire story.

I could go on for days about how bad this film is, but why bother. Don't buy it, don't rent it, just get your fill of Highlander from all the other films (just watch #1 and #4) and hours of television and don't waste your time on this one. Adrian Paul should be ashamed of himself.",1208217600,4,1748,4.4392523364485985

Everyone who follows a television series wants an ending which explains what happens to all the characters. This does. It's wonderful to see Duncan McCloud of the clan McCloud win in the end.

Just a question: Was Christopher Lambert ever killed off in his movies?",1207958400,3,538,4.326732673267327

The audio/sound-fx are horrific.  The acting is uninspired.  There is no story and what they've attempted doesn't fit in with any part of the Highlander-universe.

The best part of of the series was, of course, the swordfights.  Rather than choreograph a fight here, they've elected to take a picture of the characters and jiggle it at high speed around the set.  Like seriously, I could make a better fight scene with my great-grandmother and a tortoise.

Do not under any circumstances consider buying this horrific piece of nonsense.",1207699200,2,688,4.921739130434783

3290673,2,B0010YVCAM,"I wanted so badly to like this film....but alas, I did not. I adore Adrian Paul, I really, truly do. I'm beginning to think he is actually immortal because the man doesn't age! I swear, he looks just as good now as he did during the series. Gorgeous, amazing, I never get tired of looking at him AND he's a good actor - love it! And if you think Peter Wingfield in leather is something to look at, you haven't lived until you've seen him strapped to a table in his tighty whities on the late night erotica TV show ""Bliss"" - you can even buy the DVD's here on [...]. Check it out, you won't be disappointed.....

But I digress....

 First I have to say something about the music. I'm sorry to be cruel but it was awful! Who in their right mind would replace Queen with some bad (and I do mean B A D!) cover of ""Princes of the Universe?"" It's QUEEN for frak sake! I was screaming ""NO! NO! NO!"" at the screen. It was the beginning of the end unfortunately. I actually watched it to the end and despite a few glimmers of possibility, it did not get any better.

I think this film could have had some potential but it just didn't work for me at all. Maybe the editing is partially to blame but it seems to me they should have stuck closer to the mythology of the story they were trying to tell - namely, the hero's journey back to the ""source"" of the immortal's immortality. I feel like one of the problems centered around  the fact that several events/scenes in the movie seemed staged primarily for the fx opportunity but had absolutely nothing to do with the mythology. So, while the fx were cool, from a story perspective such scenes were empty and felt contrived. Add some bad music and you have a recipe for disaster on your hands.

I guess the bottom line is this: If you feel you must see this film, rent it. If you think you might watch it again, then go ahead and buy it. I will say there is a very nice tribute to William Panzer (one of the original producers of the movies and the series who died in 2007) in the bonus features that I found very heartfelt and moving. If you are a fan of the show you may enjoy watching that. As others have said however, the original Highlander movie and the TV series were truly first rate. The TV series especially was always extremely well done. If you want ""the goodness"" of the Highlander mythology, that's where you will find it.

I am giving this DVD 2 stars because the bonus features were worth watching....and while you have it rented you may decide to watch the film as well but don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed.",1207612800,2,2583,4.269938650306749
3290674,1,B0010YVCAM,"In late 2007, I was initially excited to find this direct-to-cable sequel on the Sci-Fi Channel to ""Highlander: The Series,"" with Adrian Paul (as MacLeod), Jim Byrnes (as Dawson), and Peter Wingfield (as Methos) all returning in their respective roles.  After both the box office failure of 2000's ""Highlander 4: Endgame,"" and Elizabeth Gracen's short-lived ""Highlander: The Raven"" tv series a decade ago, my curiosity was piqued to see how the ""Highlander"" franchise could be resurrected once more.

Suffice to say, I was very disappointed (but not surprised) by the wretched outcome.  While consistent with ""Highlander""'s big screen history of choppy rock video-style editing and at times poor storyline coherency, this fifth installment, unfortunately, hits a new all-time low for the 22-year old franchise in both categories.  I won't go into this abysmal film's failures to any great extent (as other reviewers already have done so well), but let me say that ""Highlander: The Source"" completely wasted the opportunity of renewing hope that Adrian Paul's character would still lead the franchise into the future.

Unfortunately, according to this movie, what the future really means is a cheap, dismal ""Road Warrior"" knock-off that abandons all of the previous swashbuckling grandeur, inventive time-traveling flashbacks, and exuberant romantic charm that creator Gregory Widen originally envisioned and which later made Adrian Paul's tv series endure for six years.  So why did the producers, including Mr. Paul, choose to pursue this radically different, albeit dubious, premise (i.e. ""Highlander"" meets ""Def-Con 4"")?

My guess is at least part of the answer can be found in the virtually constant darkness depicted in the film.  The darkness wasn't just for ambiance's sake; rather, it was supposed to help disguise the low budget and deficient production values (such as the grade-Z screenwriting).  The movie, as a result, comes off like a mindless, goth-violent video game that appeals only to hard-core fans of sci-fi/fantasy schlock.  Sadly, it also pretty much chokes the remaining life out of ""Highlander""'s rapidly dwindling fanbase.

Now, let me provide my take on the film's central theme: what really is the enigmatic source of immortality?  The film's final sequence is hardly a shocker, but presenting the idea of human reproduction as the ultimate answer reminded me of the mediocre 1989 ""Star Trek V""'s all too simplistic attempt to explain where God truly is.  In other words, it is beyond insulting to suggest to intelligent viewers that they don't already know the obvious ""source,"" but perhaps even more so, that the answer must still be spelled out for them.

In summation, I would have much preferred a direct continuation of ""Highlander 4: Endgame,"" or even an improved reworking of ""Highlander 2: The Quickening""'s futuristic world.  The poorly-produced fifth ""Highlander"" film instead, much like the gloomy future Earth it depicts, makes Duncan MacLeod's prospects for a sixth installment seem far more grim (whether he is played by Adrian Paul or a successor).  If this indeed the end for Duncan MacLeod, at least the producers finally allow him to embark on real life's greatest adventure (parenthood).

Movie Grade: F + (it seems fitting for what little spark this movie has).",1207440000,8,3310,5.322456813819578
3290675,1,B0010YVCAM,"This mess of a movie is a faux-cyberpunk version of the Highlander by way of a goth-metal adrenaline rush (throwing in some cannibals and Bugs Bunny routines for good measure). It comes to us from Lionsgate Films who have acquired the rights to the Highlander property and plan to use this movie as a starting point to relaunch the franchise. Based on what I've seen, though, it looks like they are more likely to sink it.

This movie was actually completed in 2006 and a rough copy circulated in Europe early in 2007 to harsh reviews. Lionsgate spent some time retooling the movie then decided to forgo a theatrical release and instead premiere it on the Sci Fi Channel as a ""Sci Fi Original Movie"" (in place of the usual Saturday night critters-on-the-rampage fare). I never saw the rough cut, but I can't imagine how it could have been much worse than what made it to the final version.

The movie takes place in the near future after civilization has collapsed. There is actually little elaboration on what brought about the collapse, this just provides the backdrop for several immortals' quest for the nebulous Source; supposedly the key to their power. Adrian Paul returns from the Highlander TV Series as Duncan MacLeod (and sleepwalks through the role) along with Peter Wingfield as Methos and Jim Byrnes as the Watcher Joe Dawson. They are joined by two immortals Zai Jie and Cardinal Giovanni as well as Duncan's latest girlfriend, Anna Teshemka. This group must do battle with another immortal, the Guardian, who I think is supposed to be guarding the Source and who looks like the cover of a bad heavy metal album come to life. The narrative of the movie is so disjointed and incoherent that I definitely lost track of the motivations driving each person to this Source thing. And by the end of the movie I didn't care and actually regretted my decision to stick it through to the ending credits.

The Highlander movies have actually been a mixed bag at best. Even the first movie which launched the franchise was only good not great. It was the television series, which ran in syndication for six years starring Adrian Paul, which best represented the franchise. Now, this new attempt to relaunch the Highlander series is equally as misguided as the sequel to the first movie, 1991's dreadful Highlander: The Quickening.

If you are jonesing for the adventures of the Duncan or Connor Macleod, go back and revisit the series or the first movie on DVD. But definitely don't waste your time with this poor excuse to milk a few more dollars out of the Highlander name.

I guess it just goes to show what people will do for money.

On a parallel note... I watched the commentary by Adrian Paul on the Highlander Episode - Prophecy, in which he said that he wished that they had not done the show because Highlander, while fiction, had always been based as much as possible in reality, and that episode delved into the realm of Fantasy.

Both these version of the Highlander franchise featured great characters, marvellous flashbacks, interesting villains, and dealt with both the positive and negative aspects of immortality, such as unending youth and strength, and the experience of being able to see whole different ages, such as most people can only dream about, balanced off against the loneliness of watching everyone around you age and die, with only a handful of people with whom you can form lasting bonds -- and many of them are out to take your head.  It was thrilling stuff, and as the first movie and series proved, this concept was a rich source from which really great stories could be mined again and again.

How sad then that with the exception of that first film, the makers of Highlander movies have failed so dismally.  This movie actually rivals ""Highlander II: the Quickening"" in sheer awfulness, and I hadn't believed that possible.  I had a terrible sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach when I found that this movie was set in a near future where society had broken down into chaos and anarchy.  Why on earth did the producers of this film choose to borrow an element from the worst movie in the entire franchise?  The villain was so ridiculous he wasn't even remotely menacing or scary.  What could EVER make anyone think a villain who yells ""Helloo Joe!"" as he sails through the air hit by a car (in a stupendously unrealistic stunt/special effect) would play well?  This was just one moment among many involving the villain that elicits unintentional laughter.  The guardian was so horrendously, cringe-inducingly bad that if the Kurgan were in this film he would have killed him for bringing villains into disrepute.

And of course, on top of a poor story, a laughable villain, and the complete absence of any of the elements that made either the first film or the series a success, this movie suffers from a fault common to all Highlander films but the first: lack of continuity.  Why, if they are going to make these things, do they insist on disregarding everything that came before?  This is really frustrating to those fans who have delved into the world of the Highlander franchise and would like it to make at least some sense, and have some internal consistency.  It's hard to stay interesting in something when they keep changing the ground rules on you.

But the above listed flaws barely scratch the surface of what it wrong with this movie.  I read that this was intended to be the first of a trilogy.  All I can say to that is that I hope not.  As much as I am irritated at the lack of consistency and continuity in the Highlander movies, if they're going to do any more, they need to retcon this abortion out of existence.  Having inexplicably copied concepts from the single worse installment of the whole franchise, they should also copy the follow up taken to that movie by the producers of the next one and write a new story that ignores this steaming pile of dog excrement and starts with a blank slate.",1204416000,58,3373,4.74486301369863
3290691,1,B0010YVCAM,"For those who loved Highlander II, this movie is for you. This is supported by the fact that they even advertise Highlander II's newly enhanced DVD in the opening previews!

For the rest of us Highlander fans who loved the original movie and the t.v. series, this one is at best a rental. Aside from the cast (Joe, Duncan, and Mythos), it lacks any resemblance to the t.v. series.

This film takes place in the near future in which all government and law has broken down (aka Road Warrior). A few immortals remain and go on a quest to track down ""the source"". So scrap ""there can be only one"", forget about historical flash-backs involving Duncan or Mythos that develop their characters, and instead insert an immortal ""mutant"", loads of bad acting and generic scenes and *poof* welcome to Highlander V.

This film is a great disappointment to this Highlander fan.",1204416000,,864,4.708609271523179
3290692,4,B0010YVCAM,"""Highlander: The Source"" is the latest installment in what has been a hit-and-miss film franchise. This film finds immortal Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul of the ""Highlander"" TV series) and a band of Immortal warriors on a quest to find the Holy Grail of Immortality. It was originally intended as the first of a trilogy of films detailing the origins of the Immortals.
The film as presented on this DVD is a decent effort. The plot and story are interesting, the acting is fine, and the visual effects are great. What messes the film up is the editing. This 86-minute version takes  a number of scenes out of the 94-minute Russian version, and those scenes are sorely missed. However, the interesting story elements and performances make up for a lot.
As a ""Highlander"" fan, I enjoyed ""The Source,"" even though it is far from a perfect film. Hopefully, this will not be the final nail in the coffin for this franchise. While most fans will find it disappointing, it is definitely a unique and fascinating entry into the series.

I would really like to know what people problem is.  seriously it wasn't that bad a movie, joe's death was handled right, giving him the didgnity he showed in the series constanlty defing the"" we watch not infer"" policy, Methos showed a strength he probably has never showed eexcept for the very begining of his existence.  okay the gaurdian was a little teasing, you could say, but look at kurgen from the movies he teased Conner near the end which made him very funny almost like sabretooth from the x-men.

  is everyone disappointed there wasn't for the thousandth time a big quicking fight scene at the end?  aw[...] bad!  Not every thing about highlander is about voilence!  if you have the time and look at prophecy, ""there can be only one"" ended up not meaning what every one thought it meant.  the accumlated knowledge of the immortals lead to one thing.....what do you stand for after hundreds or thousands of years, what have you learned?  only one person ended up understanding that.  that what the movie was about.  if you are a real fan and enjoy highlander for what it was, is , and will hopefully will continue to be you could very well enjoy this.  If you are and action junkie, with a everything got to be big special effects ...don't bother even renting it you won't enjoy it.  but for people who like a good story, like the highlander charcter<s>, and are just glad to see it on the screen one more time  go ahead ...i think it'll suprise you.",1203984000,10,1738,4.540192926045016
3290697,1,B0010YVCAM,"The Highlander movies have always been something of a crapshoot. The first one was a classic. The second one was universally panned. The third you either loved it or hated it.

The fourth (Endgame) was probably the only sequel that many would agree as being worthy of the original. At the very least it was better than the other sequels and seemed to get the movie's back on track to being something that's worthwhile.

Unfortunately, The Source is a drastic step back. I would dare to say that it's even worse than Highlander 2 (a movie that I myself gave one star to in my review only because Amazon doesn't allow for less).

What made this movie so bad that I would rate it as being worse than even the most panned Highlander film ever created?

The photography has the color washed out much in the style of Crow II City of Angels. It's very hard to look at and gave me a headache just looking at it.

The action just didn't work well. Most of the scenes with the Guardian were cat and mouse (pounce you're dead) scenes that had very little actual fighting. The few scenes that had actual sword fighting were mostly obscured in odd special effects that made the actors look like they were zipping around all over the place when in reality they were standing static with only the minimum of arm movement.

This is a movie franchise that is based in sword fighting. The sword fighting should be well-choreographed fights that thrill the audience, not static shots with shadow trails that give the illusion of movement.

The plot was also thin. It amounted to `follow her, she knows where to go.' `Let's go here.' Fight sequence. `Let's go here.' Fight sequence. Rinse, lather, repeat. You needn't worry about too many spoilers, because that's the whole movie right there.

I was really hoping I'd enjoy this. After Highlander Endgame, I honestly thought that the franchise was finally going somewhere I could appreciate. But then they follow it up with this. I never thought I'd say this, but if this is all Hollywood is willing to give us from now on with the Highlander series, I'd just as soon they drop it.",1203984000,2,2111,4.595744680851064

The idiot writers had the nerve to kill off Joe Dawson (Jim Byrnes)in this poor effort. They relegated Methos (Peter Wingfield) to a cameo appearance that is, thankfully, dignified and compelling. Effects wise, the main battle with the villain (wearing ridiculous make-up) is a Keystone Cops fast motion fight. Trust me, I have seen every episode of the Highlander TV series and ALL the films. There can be only one and this isn't it. And, yes, the other reviewers are telling you the truth: Jabba the Hutt makes a cameo appearance. This film is such a sad addition to the Highlander canon.

None of the things that made the original Highlander movie or the TV series so good are here. They turn the entire mythology previously established on it's ear. I think this movie was filmed for theatrical release but then they could not get a distributer so went to TV instead. After watching it you can see why only Sci Fi channel would show this garbage.

3290706,1,B0010YVCAM,"Being the generous soul that I am, I'm going to save you an hour and a half of your life.  Do you wish to know how bad this movie is?  Let's put it this way: VFX Magazine named Highlander 2 (both version) as the ""worst sequel ever made""-and it was by a landslide too, folks.  That is how bad that movie was.  This movie makes that one look like an Oscar caliber masterpiece.

Apparently, someone watched the Underworld movies and thought using blue lenses to add ""effect"" was a great idea.  No, it wasn't.  Someone else thought it was a brilliant idea to completely screw up the whole myth of the Immortals and make the story look more idiotic and contrived.  No, it wasn't.  And someone else thought it was a super idea to kill off a character that could have actually contributed something like it was an afterthought.  No, it wasn't.

This movie was so horrid I couldn't believe I sat through the last half hour and then I couldn't believe that I actually turned it back on and watched the rest of it off and on through increments and didn't threaten to sue SciFi for stealing two hours of my life.  Not even Methos could save this movie-and he made Endgame (or at least his part in Endgame) watchable.  Methos could make just about anything Highlander related watchable (you can tell I liked him from the show).  That is how much this movie sucked.  It was so bad that I could write better-someone who has no real training in creative writing and never worked in any sort of entertainment industry who could put out better material than the two writers who actually got paid to do so instead of being fired out of a cannon and into the sun like they should have been.

If anyone can ask how the hell this even got developed and not laugh, I would actually care to know.  I doubt anyone can actually answer, that's how bad it is.  If they do bring back the series, at least stay away from the MacLeods next time.  Their story became dead and buried with Connor.

Worst. Movie. Ever. (And I saw Troy and Leprechaun 4 as well...and I thought it couldn't get any worse.  Clearly, I was wrong.)",1203724800,2,2093,4.3984375
3290707,1,B0010YVCAM,"One of mankind's fondest dreams is no doubt to live upon this earth in vitality and youth beyond the paltry 75 to 90-odd years the healthiest among us get to enjoy.  As such, one of contemporary fantasy's most compelling franchises has had to have been Highlander.  The protagonist is himself immortal and gets to live indefinitely provided his head is not lopped by a fellow Immortal as these are destined to battle until there is a sole survivor among them as the catch phrase reminds the viewer ""In the end there can be only one.""

It has been several years since an adventure of the legendary Scotsman, but if ""Highlander: The Source"" is any indication, it appears he is feeling his 400 plus years.

For several years as this film plodded its way through production and distribution, fans were given hints that they would finally at last be provided with an explanation as to how the Immortals came to be in the first place.  This convoluted story delivers none of that as the Source does not necessarily refer to origins.

Though Highlander: The Source ultimately falls short in terms of the story, these shortcomings are compounded by the atrocious cinematography.  Though broadcast in the early to mid 90's, the old Highlander TV series had better quality effects than the latest film in the series.

For example, central to the milieu  of the Highlander saga is the transfer of the quickening from the Immortal that has lost his head to the Immortal that has taken it.  In the TV series, this was depicted by an impressive display of lightening bolts and electric shocks.

However, in The Source, these scenes are not nearly as impressive.  The electric charges are now less distinctive artistically with the emphasis now on the head rolling away, something that was only alluded to and seldom seen in the older episodes.

Relatedly, in the TV series, the sword fights leading up to this dramatic exchange of life force were often depicted as elegant, almost dance-like encounters.  However, in Highlander: The Source, these are now filmed with the same herky-jerky camera action used in many productions today such as the new Battlestar Galactica where viewers almost come away nauseated because the directors think they are too good to shoot images with a steady, smooth hand.

Highlander: The Source is such a disappointment that, if one did happen to be an Immortal, one might just very well be tempted to slit one's own throat than rather spend an eternity watching this movie for an eternity.

I know one thing for sure though, there are many episodes from the series that were better than this film.  BUT with that being said, I get what the producers were trying to do by taking the HIGHLANDER mythology into a different direction.  I mean with all the stories that take place in the highlander mythos, it seems to me that with the exception of HIGHLANDER VENGEANCE, the highlander stories that take place in the future do not really do so well...Example?  Highlander 2! Highlander The Source, even the idea for shooting the sixth season taking place in the future was scrapped.  Although it looks good on paper, people don't seem to be interested on the life of an immortal living in the future.  We only care about their lives in the present or their place during history.  Anyway, I'm probably not gonna buy this dvd, cause I'm sure theres going to be a new cut coming out within the year or near FUTURE.  The story was mildly interesting, but if they continue with the two sequels after this, I might appreciate this film more.  But they need to hire some better writers...I mean, honestly im sure any real FAN could have done a better job.  The action was blah compared to ENDGAME.  There was too much with too little significance going on.  and... yea let's not talk about the ending cause i don't want to spoil it for anyone.  I did enjoy seeing Methos and Duncan on screen again.  People talk about how there shouldnt be any more cause it gets worse everytime.  But!

By far it was not as good as the series, and maybe not as good as Highlander I or III, but it definitely beats out II and IV, and the explanation of where Immortals come from is marginally more plausible then it was in II (which isn't hard).  Additionally, with the way the 6th season of Highlander was, the journey's of Duncan MacLeod are going alot better.
This movie is just getting a bad rap cause any movie that tries to change the course of a franchise this much always does.

The Source begins sometime in the distant future (*yawn*) as Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul), Methos (Peter Wingfield), Duncan's ex-wife Anna (Thekla Reuten), Joe Dawson (Jim Byrnes), and a small band of immortals seek out ""the source"", which is said to be the origin place of the immortals.  Standing in their way is the demonic Guardian (Cristian Solimeno), who is supposedly an all-powerful immortal that picks off our heroes one by one, leading to the inevitable showdown between him and Duncan.  What ends up being the most infuriating about The Source for Highlander fans is how much the film ends up going against the mythology of the series, as well as Duncan and other character's motivations for seeking out ""the source"".  The Jabba the Hutt lookalike in the film doesn't exactly help things out either, and the film as a whole is just one big jumbled mess, thanks to the lackluster, sloppily edited direction from Brett Leonard (Lawnmower Man, Man-Thing), and a cover-themed edition of the original Highlander soundtrack to boot (the version of ""Who Wants to Live Forever?"" is more annoying than anything else) just all amount to the worst sequel the series has ever seen.

Avoid it if you have any positive feelings or memories left from earlier Highander incarnations.",1198972800,12,509,4.704545454545454
3290741,4,B0010YVCAM,Compared to the original release of the 2nd Highlander movie this last one was pretty good. It wasn't as good as the first but if you're a fan of the TV series and can handle some new characters that maybe weren't really needed then it was alright. The main villain was a bit cheesy and slightly confusing but I didn't watch it for him since it's a well known fact that the villain will always die in the end. There were some good scenes and I think the end allows for a continuation since the movie's website said this was the 1st of a trilogy. We'll see.,1198627200,6,556,4.205607476635514

This made for TV movie obliterated what made HIGHLANDER: The Series so absorbing. Wooden performances, a cheese filled storyline...This was the death knell and the most pathetic attempt to cash in on what was an incredible series.

When I sat trying to watch this I just kept going ""What?"" and ""Oh no they didn't!"" and ""this sucks (fill in your own expletive here)""  I tortured myself by watching it all the way through and believe me it was torture. I still have trouble believing this was made...oh wait I forgot (see my first comment in this review).

The character of ""Joe Dawson"" (played by Jim Brynes) was the luckiest person in this movie. He died. All of the other actors probably wish they had, especially as the sheer inanity of this blatant exploitation tasked the endurance of even the most faithful of Highlanders legions of fans. Of which I still count myself. I can't even see this movie enjoying ""campy movie"" status of Highlander III. I guess I can survive this.

PS: The only good thing I can think of concerning this movie was the camera work.  It was excellent.",1198540800,6,1270,5.393939393939394
