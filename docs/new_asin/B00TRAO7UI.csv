7020723,5,B00TRAO7UI,"I had not seen this movie until it was released by Criterion, but seeing as I love Chaplin's other work, I went all in and bought it. It is a fantastic film. Great comedy like his other movies, yet deep emotion and genuine sadness as well. I don't think you could be disappointed with this one. It is a fantastic glimpse into the lives of two individuals at different points in their lives; one young, one old, and both going through great despair. It really is a beautiful and moving film. I highly recommend it.",1435536000,16,513,4.410526315789474
7020724,5,B00TRAO7UI,"There are maudlin and pontificating elements that makes this movie seem less masterful than the rest of Chaplin's oeuvre .  It's pretty much his only truly nostalgic feature film and that's okay to do when you have so many masterpieces under your belt!  By the way, the restoration of A Night in the Show has my hopes up for an Essanay Blu-ray box (probably on Flicker Alley)!  Let's hope Criterion puts the Circus out next!!!",1433808000,7,426,4.653333333333333

7020726,5,B00TRAO7UI,"Limelight (1952) is Charles Chaplins drama about the twilight of a former vaudeville star. Chaplin plays Calvero, a once beloved musical-comedy performer, now a washed-up alcoholic has-been who lives in a small London flat. When he meets the much-younger Thereza (Claire Bloom), a ballerina who lives downstairs, he is smitten by her youth, beauty and talent, and falls in love with her.

Perhaps one of Chaplins most personal films, Limelight contains parallels to Chaplins life and career. The film is set in 1914, the first year he appeared in a movie after tremendous success on the stage. A superstar in the silent period, Chaplin made only four sound pictures before Limelight and, like Calvero, never again realized the same career success. In the sound era, he was overshadowed by newer, younger entertainers.

A highlight of the film is Calveros climactic comeback at the Empire Theatre. Hes joined onstage in a musical duet routine by his old partner, played by the other great comedy star of the silent period, Buster Keaton. This scene marks the only time the two comedians worked together on screen.

The Blu-ray Criterion Collection release contains a new restoration of the film. Bonus extras include the video essay Chaplins Limelight Its Evolution and Intimacy; new interviews with actors Claire Bloom and Norman Lloyd; a 2002 documentary on the film; audio recording of Chaplin reading two short excerpts from his novella, Footlights; two short films by Chaplin: A Night in the Show (1915) and the uncompleted The Professor (1919); one outtake; and a critical essay.",1431907200,13,1584,5.155642023346304

8702889,5,B00TRAO7UI,"It is a masterpiece with some funny scenes, especially at the end, but mostly because of the tremendous empathy this film carries, conveys and communicates about life, about death, about doing something with the life we have been entrusted with, something positive, something that may serve the community, other people, something that provides love to those who need it, who deserve it.

It is impossible to tell the story of this film without in many ways destroying it. We are in London just before the First World War and we are in show business with Charlie Chaplin as an old comedian, Calvero; a young dancer, Thereza who has some stage fright problems that paralyze her legs, and is impersonated by Claire Bloom; and a young composer, Neville enacted by Sydney Chaplin. In Calveros comeback, he will perform with an old partner of his played by Buster Keaton.

The interest of the film is its comic dimension intertwined with the dramatic content, with this dancer who has to be supported and even reconstructed in order to be able to use her legs to perfection. Everyone will remember the slap from Calvero in the wings just seconds before she enters the stage when she is having a sudden paralysis fit caused by stage fright. And the slap works because she is so shocked she cannot even think of her legs anymore.

Charlie Chaplin after the Second World War seems to be a lot more humane, empathetic with people, individual people, just as if the war had battered him down tremendously and let him sore in his heart and sad in his mind. The big political and social subjects are more or less kept in the past and now he looks at the mental state of human beings in this world that has to be reconstructed after the five years of absolute folly. Maybe McCarthy and his campaign in Hollywood that forced Charlie Chaplin to move back to Great Britain is softening his critical tone.

This final period in Charlie Chaplins creative life is, just the same as with Picasso, different but yet the same as for imagination, creativity, intensity, human sympathy and compassion. I must say that the scene of flea taming is really funny, though I may prefer the final act with Buster Keaton, the grand piano, and the violin. The satire of classical concerts is so strong and to the point: formality and appearances that have to be saved, kept and protected so much that then the music or the performance becomes stiff and even forbidding.

To be seen urgently if you haven't already done so. You will all like Calveros death on stage, or nearly and you will all think of Molire himself, the greatest comedian of all times and one of the best playwrights, who actually died on stage performing a hypochondriac would-be sick man.
