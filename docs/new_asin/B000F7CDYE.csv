From Bernard Marchois, curator of the Piaf museum in Paris (Les amis d'Edith Piaf)

I saw the film and it filled my heart with joy. What a magnificent interpretation of ""T'es beau tu sais."" I have goose pimples!

2553993,5,B000F7CDYE,"Raquel Bitton is a French-American jazz singer who specializes in the French repertoire and has built a reputation as one of the foremost interpreters of the music of Edith Piaf. In 2000, she held a series of concerts across North America in tribute to France's most famous songbird. This DVD is a memento of one such concert, recorded in the Elgin theatre in Toronto, and interspersed with interviews with Piaf's contemporaries, collaborators, friends and relatives, filmed in various bistros and restaurants across France and ending with a memorial visit to Piaf's final resting place at Pere-Lachaise cemetery.

The concert itself includes some of Piaf's most famous songs as well as lesser known ones, preceeded with anecdotes from Piaf's life, from her childhood amidst grinding poverty, to the heights of her success, to her untimely death at age 47, loved and mourned by millions the world over.

Many of Piaf's best songs and especially her delivery of them have always had the unfailing ability to bring tears to the eye and Bitton succeeds in no lesser measure. It is not just her voice which bears a certain similarity to Piaf but her ability to project her very soul through the music that makes her interpretations such a success. It is a moving concert and a moving film as a whole.

The songs featured in the concert are:

1. La goualante du pauvre Jean

2. J'em fous pas mal (I shouldn't care) (Second verse in English)

3. T'es beau tu sais

4. La Noel de la rue

5. Mon Legionaire

6. Enfin le Printemps

7. L'accordeoniste

8. Le vieux piano

9. Bravo pour le clown

10. Milord

11. La foule (Que nadie sepa mi sufrire) (First verse in Spanish)

12. Sous le ciel de Paris

13. Autumn leaves (English version)

14. Mon Dieu

15. Hymne a l'amour (A hymn to love) (First verse in English)

16. Elle a dit

17. Non, je ne regrette rien

18. La vie en rose (English version only)

19. Les Avions sont des Oiseaux (Closing credits) (New song by Francis Lai & Michel Rivegauche)

The film does not include footage of Piaf herself except for one intriguing interview taken from French newsreels after she was suspected of murdering her manager and friend Louis Leplee. Instead it concentrates on what matters most, Piaf's music. Piaf's songs have the rare ability to capture the flavour of an era long gone while somehow remaining absolutely timeless. The songs are just as able to reduce an audience to tears today as they were more than half a century ago.

The film is presented in its original 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen (enhanced for widescreen TV). Picture quality is good with sharp images, well rendered colors and deep blacks. Audio is in 2.0 Dolby Surround and Dolby Digital 5.1. The sound is lovely and flatters both voice and orchestral accompaniment. Optional English and Spanish subtitles are provided, including translations of the song lyrics. Strangely the original French lyrics are not included. There are no extras.",1152748800,55,2948,4.838323353293413
2553994,5,B000F7CDYE,"I saw ""Piaf: her story, her songs"" at the Castro Theater in San Francisco with more than a thousand people attending the film, and there were a few hundred more people outside the theater trying to get in to the sold out theater.

It was a superb film, I adored it. Its brilliance comes from the fact that this film about Piaf celebrates her the way her fans long to see her celebrated, through her songs.

Piaf's writers, composers, lovers and friends gathering at a bistro over food and wine and telling intimate stories about their personal relationship with Piaf was quite revealing.

Bitton's performance simply blew me away! I have never felt the emotional power of a singer like that before. Myself along with the entire audience was deeply moved.

It's all in the title ""Piaf: her story, her songs"", her story told through songs and how brilliantly interpreted!

Raquel Bitton's tribute to Piaf is magical. Her interpretation not imitation stands on its own with Bitton's magnificent renditions that leave you breathless. The emotional grip delivered by Bitton is the essence of the film itself. I could easily imagine that it was the same emotional effect that Piaf had on her audiences which earned her legendary status.

The audience at the Castro theater cried and laughed (and so did I). I am now the proud owner of the DVD which will be a classic forever.

The editorial reviewer mentions that Piaf's son is in the film. Piaf never had a son, he probably meant to say that the son of Marcel Cerdan who was the greatest love of Piaf's life is in the film where he talks about the relationship between his father and Edith Piaf.",1152489600,40,1640,4.693379790940766

8118547,5,B000F7CDYE,This dvd is just so good. Edith lived a life that was extremely challenging and made the most beautiful music at her most desparate hour at times.  This tells her story very well.  I fell in love with Edith's music years ago.  The quality of the sound blew me away totally.  Her 'story' was so unexpected from such perfection.

8118552,2,B000F7CDYE,"Good. But not amazing. Piaf songs by an other singer called Raquel Bitton. Its not a documental. It is an honoring to the singer across the interpretation of her most notable songs. The intention is good, but it does not impress.",1215907200,3,229,4.609756097560975
