2267035,5,B00094AS5O,"this movie is a masterpiece. no, not really; but I thought I should write a review anyway since it's good karma, especially in the Amazon world.",1377561600,,144,4.576923076923077
2267036,4,B00094AS5O,If this is what would be called a sleeper then don't wake me up. Saw this movie when it first came out and has been a favorite of mine ever since. Kelly Lynch is excellent and for a dark drama has lots of humorous under tones and a amazing ending. This is diffinately one for collectors. A must see to believe,1371686400,3,309,4.081967213114754

2267038,4,B00094AS5O,"This is one of my favorite films for many reasons.  First, the format is done in short clips that each tell a story and all go together to form the whole.  Interesting film technique and it works for this movie.

Kelly Lynch is amazing.  She has moment after moment, but her finest was the long monologue in the kitchen when she talks about what it's like changing from a girl into a woman...and when did that little girl who wanted to be a ballerina become a waitress?  It's such a true scene that it's hard to wrap yourself around the fact that a man actually wrote it.  Brilliant.

There are some scenes that stick in your mind forever and there are others that are really hard to watch...a little crazy...and I'm not sure they fit.  However, there is so much about this movie that deserves recognition that it's well worth the view.",1261440000,5,836,4.453947368421052
2267039,1,B00094AS5O,Boring movie that would only be worth purchasing if it were in the bargain bin and the cable was out.,1212364800,,101,4.1
2267040,2,B00094AS5O,"The only thing that kept me watching this movie was to see if there was going to be a Twilight Zone-type ending that tied it all together.

Remember the Zone where five wildly-different people (a clown, a cowboy, a ballerina, etc.) are trapped in a round room and, when they finally escape, you find out that they're just dolls in a trash can?  It was a lame Zone, but I thought of that watching this movie as Kelly Lynch wanted to stay inside that abandoned desert house--and wondered if that house was going to be a place between Life and Death.  That Kelly might have been hovering between the two in that room and that her new ""husband"" was Satan.  Or an angel.  Something really off-the-wall.

But it didn't happen.  It's pretty much a straight-forward story of dysfunctional low-lifes trying to figure out their messy lives--without telling us very much about themselves.  The acting is very good and Kelly Lynch looks great naked (even with bandages on her wrists and wearing a dirty hosptial gown for the whole movie), but the story gets lost in the desert.

And what the heck happened to that baby that shows up for a couple of scenes and then disappears?

That's what I was wondering about for the rest of the movie but nothing more is said.",1136505600,12,1251,4.569506726457399
2267041,4,B00094AS5O,"Although given short shrift by the few critics who watched it, this is a worthy effort, marked by good acting, direction, technicals, and an intelligent script. Although in a state of undress through much of the film, Kelly Lynch is given an opportunity to display the full panoply of her acting range as there are essentially only two actors. And, as so often with independent films, all involved have an opportunity to be truly creative. The desert setting enhanced the starkness of the extreme emotions to which the viewer is exposed.",1135123200,17,537,4.912087912087912
2267042,4,B00094AS5O,"Kelly Lynch gives a captivating performance.  Even the professional reviewers are unable to agree what exactly the story line in this movie is.  There is a considerable amount of nudity, which perhaps distracts some people.  Other people do not want to watch self-destructive people.  I enjoy the movie and consider it one of my ""Guilty Pleasures"".",1120348800,28,348,5.160714285714286
8057337,1,B00094AS5O,"The two principal actors seem to be in two different movies.  Their motivations are indecipherable and their chemistry, in spite of much naked rolling around, is nonexistent.  The acting is not quirky; it is simply unrelated to what is happening around the actors -- I kept asking myself if there was anybody directing them.  The script is listless and forced and wandering.  The sets are tacky and unbelievable.

I remember thinking that the actors might do well in another movie with another script and another director.  But...not in this one.

Pass on it.",1507161600,,559,4.946236559139785

8057341,5,B00094AS5O,"Many years ago, I used the timer on my VHS to record a movie on HBO.  When I viewed the tape, it had also recorded the first 20 minutes of a movie called ""Warm Summer Rain"" which was so intriguing I'd always wanted to see the entire movie.  So I finally looked it up on Amazon to see if this decidedly off-beat independent movie was available on a DVD.  It was, I ordered it, and am so glad I did.  The DVD was beautifully packaged, and the movie, I thought, was terrific--basically a two-character study of two young strangers who meet, click, and move into a deserted but fully furnished cottage where they fall in lust (one of the rare movies where the graphic nude sex scenes are not only necessary but genuinely erotic) and then eventually in love.  The ending is quite a surprise: tragic for one of the lovers, happy (sort of) for the other.  None of this would work at all were it not for the mesmerizing (and quite bold) performances by Kelly Lynch and Barry Tubb, who should have become major stars but, alas, didn't.  I'd also like to praise the seller of this unique, one-of-a-kind movie, which arrived in the mail only a few days after I purchased it in perfect condition.  Highly recommended, both the seller and the movie.",1475107200,2,1236,4.4622222222222225

8057346,3,B00094AS5O,"I saw this movie before purchasing, and it haunted me afterward.  I decided I needed to own it, so that I could linger upon its meaning and refer to it in further contemplation.  I still haven't quite figured it out.  Perhaps, I may have to see it several times more.",1382054400,,267,4.3
