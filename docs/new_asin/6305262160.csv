1004848,5,6305262160,"This is one of my Favorite comedies of all time! It has the best cast ever for the lead characters, Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin.  As for the plot I am going to copy from what I have on a poster in my room of the movie:
""When rich, eccentric Edwina Cutwater died, a crazy guru tried to transport her soul into the body of a beautiful young woman.  But the guru goofed, and Edwina's soul is accidentally taken over the entire right side of her lawyer, Rodger Cobb [Steve Martin].  He still controls what's left.  Now, Edwina and Roger are living together in the same body.  He's losing his job;  He's losing his girlfriend. And he just can't seem to get her out of his system.  No matter how hard he tries.""
Well, there you have the plot...and now for the good part: The acting!  Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin are two of my favorite actors of all time...and when I heard they were in a Comedy together I was suprised and amazed! So when I popped in the video I knew it was gonna be good.  I'm not going to go into descriptions in detail of the movie because you'll just have to see it to believe me...and I know you won't be dissapointed!  This is truly one of the best comedy's ever and with great performances by great actors, ""All of Me"" certainly can't be missed!!",1016928000,,1266,4.2594142259414225

1005515,4,6305262160,"Watching these two comic superstars work together is a rare treat. Both Tomlin and Martin deliver their wry zingers with panache. Both of them also use physical comedy to great effect. Martin's slapstick ""possession"" moves are unforgettable. Yet both actors also tap into some complex, authentic emotional layers as well, which makes the movie not only funny but also charming and at times unexpectedly poignant. I hope the movie will get a new transfer sometime soon, because the quality via streaming was mediocre at best. Dialogue was not always intelligible, and the soundtrack was generally flat and uninvolving. Worse yet, the video was not widescreen but 4:3, with what appeared to be an open-matte transfer. Colors were washed out, and the image was soft. At times it looked more like VHS than like DVD.",1399766400,5,811,5.059701492537314
1005516,1,6305262160,"The movie was recommended to me, but it was definitely not worth the money spent renting it.  We didn't even finish the movie.",1399334400,,126,4.478260869565218
1005517,4,6305262160,"I have to admit, modern comedies just don't do it for me.  Too often they rely on crass humor, quickly-dated pop culture gags, and actors whose comedic talents mostly consist of mugging endlessly to the camera and abusing their fellow actors.  It makes me miss the comedies of the past, which relied more on clever dialogue and talented actors with a great sense of comic timing.  Sure, those movies had their share of sexual humor, but they knew to balance it out with genuine slapstick and observational humor, and much of the humor came from characterization as well as plain goofiness.  Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin were both wonderful comedy actors, and knew how to work a comedic script to its greatest extent.

""All Of Me"" is a great showcase of both actors' talents, balancing slapstick comedy with hilarious dialogue and characters.  It's a memorable romp that deserves more attention than it gets.

Steve Martin plays Roger Cobb, a beleaguered lawyer who feels like little more than an errand boy to his senior partner and moonlights as a jazz musician after work.  When he's sent to finalize the will of dying heiress Edwina Cutwater, he immediately takes a dislike to her arrogance and is more than a little weirded out by her plans for her death -- to have a Hindu swami transfer her soul into the younger, healthy body of her stableman's daughter, cheat death, and get a second lease on life.  Things take a turn for the hilariously worse when, upon her death, the ceremony is botched and she ends up inhabiting one side of Roger's body.  As the two struggle to share a body and track down the swami to set things right again, Edwina will end up getting Roger into all sorts of hijinks involving his boss's divorce trial, his blind musician buddy, his fianc (the boss's daughter), and the stableman's beautiful daughter... but it might also lead to an unusual friendship as well.

They don't make comedies like this anymore.  The plot is zany but fun, the dialogue is wickedly funny, and there's real character development as the film progresses.  Both Roger and Edwina grow over the course of the film, and end up better, happier people despite (or maybe because of) the strange circumstances they find themselves in.  There's a diabolical plot woven into the film as well, of course, but it simply adds to the hijinks and even serves to provide some surprisingly tender moments.

Martin and Tomlin shine as the stars of this show, their comedic talents matching up well as the two characters butt heads.  Martin has a gift for both clever, acerbic one-liners and physical comedy, and Tomlin's snarkiness compliments his talents.  The other actors provide some great moments as well, but for the most part play ""straight man"" to the comedic duo (though the swami gets some hilarious moments as the fish-out-of-water mystic).

The DVD transfer is passable, but not great, making the film look like it was taken straight from the VHS tape rather than remastered at all.  For this, it gets one star docked.  Hopefully they release a remastered edition someday, maybe with a few extra features.

A great '80s comedy that doesn't get the attention it deserves.  If you're a Steve Martin or Lily Tomlin fan, give this one a shot.  You won't be disappointed.",1396396800,,3266,4.803220035778176
1005518,4,6305262160,"This was one of my favorite comedies growing up during the 80's. This picture is sometimes forgotten by those that talk about Steve Martins really good movies , or really good romatic comedies in general.
 Steve Martin is hilarious and Lily Tomlin plays her part to the max, very good chemistry ! A Modern day  comedy with a with a real strong feel & texture to the classic comedies of the 30's, 40', & 50's .
