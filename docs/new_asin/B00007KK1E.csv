1818020,5,B00007KK1E,"if you haven't watched it in theatres, this is the best chance for you to experience the awesomeness of the 4th installment of the movie series.
like all pokemon movies, the graphics in this one is stunning, you can even compare it with the Miyazaki movies (which have amazingly detailed backgrounds), the well rendered 3D CGs blend perfectly with the detailed 2D drawings, unlike some other animations where 3D looks bizzare in a 2D environment...
the storyline uses ""time"" as the central idea in this movie and with the creator's imagination, it creates twists and surprises for the audience... although I want to see more actions and more combats between the heroes and villains, since this is a movie for young views, I guess I can't complain too much...
the only downside of this movie is the music... there are just not enough musics in this movie, even if there are enough, the musics are not memorable... the ending theme is horrible, talking about a music without melody... but I suppose musics don't affect the feeling the story gives you that much, so with awesome graphics and creative storyline, it balances out to be a very good movie...
I give it a 5",1056067200,4,1165,4.74384236453202
1818021,5,B00007KK1E,"(This is a review of the DVD edition of Pokmon 4Ever. It contains no spoilers other than those that could be found on the back of the DVD cover.)
Pokmon 4Ever is a great and fun film of the quality we've come to expect from not only pokmon films, but anime in general. If you are a pokmon fan of any age, this is a must own film.
Graphics (5/5):
Overall, the graphics are of the same high quality we can expect of any Pokmon episode, or movie. They even do a mild increase of the graphics quality of the standard pokmon, by giving it a mild 3D feel in certain areas.
Music (4/5):
While the movie does not hold the awe inspiring music that the previous two held, the music is flawless, and does not detract from the movie in any way. While it could have been better, it is fine as it is.
Story (5/5):
The movie's story holds together well. A boy named Sammy protects Celebi, the legendary pokmon, from a pokmon hunter. Celebi, to protect them from this threat, travels forward in time, to the time of our heroes Ash, Pikachu, and the rest. Together, they must protect Celebi, and the rest of the forest, from their new threat--a hunter more powerful than the one left behind!
The story is mildly simplistic, but as it is a children's story foremost, it cannot be faulted for that. All plot threads that are started are finished by the end of the movie, and you get a full sense of fulfillment. They did extraordinary in this area.
Fun (5/5):
The story is not only fun for children, but for more mature pokmon fans. There are several fun references for pokmon fans to catch, and they did an excellent job of making you feel for the characters--there are several truly touching moments, regardless of your age.
Special Features (3/5):
The disk holds an audio commentary, animation walkthrough, trivia game, trailers for this movie, a sneak peek at the next, and DVD-Rom features (Trading Card Game, Desktop items, and 'Hidden Content' at Pokemon.com.)
The audio commentary is unarguably the best feature of the special features. Sadly, they didn't go the full way. While most movies with audio commentaries go till the end, this one goes about 40-50 minutes, before falling off completetly to the normal movie audio. With a little work, they could have made the audio commentary longer, and given it a more satisfying feeling.
The animation progression, trailers, and trivia game are nothing to be too excited about. While the trivia game is fun, it loses its novelty after about 2 goes-through it.
The sneak peek at the next movie, almost should have been excluded. It was in Japanese, and no work to translate it was given. It overall gave a mild feel of the graphics, but gave no idea whatsoever of what the next movie will be about.
The DVD-ROM feature of the trading card game was unimpressive at best. It gives a feel of what it is about, but the game boy game can give a much better feel. The 'hidden content' is through their website, and links to it were able to be found on the internet from about the moment the DVD was unloosed on the public.
Overall (4.75/5):
The movie is a fine addition to the list of pokmon movies. It will not win over any new fans to the series, but will only strengthen the love of any old ones. I strongly suggest it as a buy to any pokmon fan, and at least a rent to any anime fan.",1052697600,4,3316,4.464579901153212
1818022,4,B00007KK1E,"this film was a excellent, i can reccommend that you watch this.
there are some sad parts later in the film, which younger children may not like, but on the whole most pokemon fans will enjoy the film.
my compliments to the producers of this and every pokemon films and tv series.",1050537600,,280,4.403846153846154
1818023,3,B00007KK1E,"Yes, it's definitely the most stylish of the four so far released in the US. The entire movie takes place in a forest, so they decided to do some creative computer animation and special visuals. The forest-themed threat of walking tree branches in the form of Wargreymon called forth by a possessed Celebi was a neat touch.
This movie, very much like the third one, was more about art direction and visuals than a good story. This is most apparent in the far-too-long scene in which Celebi takes Ash and his new friend Sammy flying with him. This scene does absolutely nothing other than show off the forest. It doesn't move the plot in any way, shape, or form. Also, Jesse, James, and Meowth are put way way in the back seat for this movie, since a new Team Rocket member has come to steal the show.
Strong points? Excellent animation, the best of all the movies. Also, of all the Legendary Pokemon, Celebi is the most loveable. Even more loveable than Mew. Also, the Pikachu short is pretty entertaining. I'm sure a lot of people out there would love to see Pokemon get attacked by a raging lawnmower. Come on admit, you can't wait to see Pokemon get attacked by a raging lawnmower. Well, that's on this DVD.
And, of course, the best part of any Pokemon DVD: the commentary. I remember listening to it on the first one and I really liked those two guys, Norman Grossfeld and Michael Haigney. This time, they brought in some guests, including a writer and the cast. WARNING: About the guy who does the voice of Meowth, MEOWTH'S VOICE IS HIS REAL VOICE. Don't get freaked when you hear it because I warned you. Sadly, the commentary ends way before the movie does. I've never seen that before, weird.
Anyway, if you want to see Pokemon get attacked by a raging lawnmower, then get this DVD. If not, well the commentary is entertaining, even if it is short. Otherwise, it's not that great.",1050364800,4,1888,4.53958944281525
1818024,3,B00007KK1E,"I didn't originally see this in theaters, mostly because I didn't really have the desire to.  However, I recently picked it up on DVD and decided to give it a watch.  I actually really liked this movie.
I've noticed how much better the scripts have improved since the monstrous re-writing of ""Revelation Lugia"", and much to my delight, they've kept the original musical score in tact.  I have to say that it was a very good move; it was excellent.
The ending in my opinion could have been written better.  It seemed just a bit too obvious about what was going to happen (I'd rather not say here, because people are stingy about spoilers), however the interesting twist in the end was a rather pleasant surprise.
Animation was very good, storyline was good, music was excellent.  I'd say that you should give this a watch.",1050192000,,821,4.63448275862069
1818025,5,B00007KK1E,"Having the chance to view this film in theatres, I was very impressed with how Miramax did a straight translation.  Unlike the WB predessors, Miramax also left the original Japanese soundtrack in place, which made the viewing experience at least for me, MUCH more enjoyable.
Very highly recommended.",1048550400,3,299,5.229166666666667
1818026,1,B00007KK1E,"...I did not even know that they were still churning out these long toy advertisements until I happened to get a glimpse of this at my local video store. It must be the bad voice dubbing or the overly-computerized special animation effects that the little tykes like because there is no story or interesting animation in the entire film.
  The fact that I was not forced to see commercials of this nonsense on TV and that shows like Rouruni Kenshin and Cowboy Beebop are gaining in popularity means that, finally, the Poke[mon] cures is lifting.",1048118400,,545,4.726315789473684
1818027,3,B00007KK1E,"After a short, limited release in theaters last year, Pokemon 4Ever is finally coming to video courtesy of Miramax. And while it's not the vast improvement to the previous Warner Bros DVD releases we were hoping for, it is still a decent offering.
The story, basically, is that Ash and company come across a boy named Sam and a Celebi, who have traveled 40 years from the past. But before Celebi can bring Sam back to his own time, it is captured by the Iron Mask Marauder, who captures Celebi using a Dark Ball, and transforms it into a destructive monster. While the Marauder and Celebi destroy the forest, Ash and Sam must try and save Celebi. There are some surprisingly emotional scenes in the movie, especially towards the end as we find out the fate of Celebi and Sam's relationship with Ash.
The DVD offers trailers for this movie and the Japanese trailer for the fifth movie, as well as previews for other Miramax titles. Fans will be pleased to know that the Pikachu short has been restored for the DVD, and as usually, it's pretty funny and features plenty of cute Pokemon. It also a multi-angle animation progression feature, but the footage shown is very brief; each of the four segments clock in at barely under a few seconds, if that. One major complaint about this DVD is that despite the fact that this is the fourth Pokemon feature, it is still only presented on DVD in FULLSCREEN. There are many instances in the movie where a character is speaking, but you can't see him or her, since they are cropped off the screen. I'd hoped this unfortunate tradition was left behind with Warner Bros, but the curse follows the series to Miramax. Listen up, Miramax, we don't mind the black bars on the screen, we really don't. This problem is even worse when compared with the Warner releases, because the picture seems to be zoomed in a bit more and after repeated viewings, you actually begin to notice that the screen is constantly wobbling. A very poor transfer.
Another complaint, though not as major, is the commentary featuring the producers and the cast. While it's fun to finally hear what the actors really sound like, they don't really react to anything on-screen; it's more like a Q&A session. While it does answer some interesting questions, it would have been better off to leave it as a separate feature and keep a regular commentary with just the producers. The commentary track also only runs under an hour, so it cuts off with about 20 minutes of the movie left to go. Hopefully they won't do this with movie 5, since the commentaries are my favorites part of the Pokemon movies.
Otherwise, it's a solid film, and fans will be pleased that the movie sticks very close to the original Japanese script. It won't convert any Pokemon haters, but then again, nothing probably would.
Just please, Miramax, when you release movie 5 on DVD, please do so in widescreen.",1047945600,15,2886,4.6607843137254905
1818047,4,B00007KK1E,"This one is very cool and has amazing graphics. Celebi and Suicune appear. This is one of my top favs and has amazing scenes. Worth the money when it comes to the film, but I was disapointed on something.

The reason I give it 4 stars instead of five is because I paid an extra 4 dollers to buy a brand new copy so I would get the Suicune card. I got a brand new copy, opened it...no card. I regretted paying an extra 4 dollers, other than that it's a great movie.",1298246400,,464,3.989247311827957
1818048,2,B00007KK1E,"An evil villain uses Pokemon to try to conquer the world. Ash & friends stop him...

In my opinion, this is where the Pokemon movies started going downhill. It wasn't bad enough that the brains behind the franchise keep making more Pokemon, most of them ridiculously stupid. Then they tried to force ""light"" and ""dark"" Pokemon on us, which is very superfluous. But they keep making these super powerful legendary Pokemon, and then putting them in these movies in situations where they seem so weak. Why? I don't get it.

They should make these movies where the focus Pokemon kicks butt. Like the first few movies. Mewtwo, Lugia, they were beasts. Even Entei represented well. That's what they need to get back to.

Maybe I'm being a little overly analytical. After all, it IS a kid's movie. But still, you can make it kid-friendly and still make it entertaining for the adults as well.",1291680000,,885,4.733766233766234
1818049,5,B00007KK1E,"This is a good move, nice story line like most Pokemon Movies. Fun for all ages to watch. Nice graphics with some parts of the movie, like most of the newer Pokemon movies have, makes them more exciting to watch.",1279756800,,212,4.325
1818050,5,B00007KK1E,"Perfect, Original DvD. Comes with an official pkmn forever suicune card.(In case)Also this item is mint and ships fast. A very good product. Recommend for kids and adults.",1270684800,,171,5.142857142857143
1818051,5,B00007KK1E,I like the Pokemon 4ever ending song a lot.  It is one of my favorite Pokemon songs.,1262304000,,84,3.9411764705882355
1818052,5,B00007KK1E,This was a replacement DVD for my twin boys.  It came in pristine condition with the Suicune Card intact.  Thank you for this excellent DVD!,1233100800,,140,4.56
1818053,4,B00007KK1E,"Pokemon 4Ever clocks in at 79 minutes.  It's just the right length for the story that's being told; it's doesn't feel like it's going too fast, but it also doesn't feel like it's dragging the story out unnecessarily.

On this disc, the short that ran before the film at the theater is only included on the disc as a special feature, unlike the first three movies, where you were forced to watch the short before starting into the movie.  The short included on this release is ""Pikachu's PikaBoo.""

The next extra on the DVD is an audio commentary version of the film.  This is followed by the ""Pokemon 4Ever Trivia Game.""  For this extra, you use the remote to select the best answer to each of seven questions.  The game appears to cycle through sets of questions, and the cycle goes in the same order each time you put the DVD into the player.  If you get a question right, you see a clip of the film that is connected to the question.  If you get a question wrong, you see Pikachu appear on the screen, with the wrong ""WRONG"" written underneath it.

Next is an extra labeled, ""Animation Progression,"" and there are four shots included: Forest Fly Through, Dust Storm, Battling a 3D Foe, and Climbing Ivy.  You use the angle button on your remote to switch from stage to stage in each sequence.  This particular feature was actually rather cumbersome.

This DVD also included both the domestic trailer and the Japanese trailer for Pokemon 4Ever; however, there are no subtitles provided for the Japanese version.  ""A Sneak Peek at the Next Pokemon Movie"" is the Japanese trailer for the fifth Pokemon film; again, there were no subtitles, so you couldn't understand anything that was being said.  The lack of subtitles for the Japanese trailers makes it frustrating for the children watching this DVD, because they can't understand anything.  There are also DVD-ROM features included.

Overall, Pokemon 4Ever is a good film, and this DVD is actually one of the better DVD releases for the Pokemon films.  There were actually some worthwhile special features included.  If you're a Pokemon fan, you should really have this Pokemon film in your DVD collection.",1227571200,,2160,4.758064516129032
1818054,5,B00007KK1E,This was a great movie for the whole family.  We all enjoyed it very much.  The kids watch it over and over and still love it. I would definitly recommend to any family who is intrested in Pokemon.,1206662400,,197,4.157894736842105
1818055,3,B00007KK1E,This is my official Pokemon movie review part 5 of 10.  Pokemon 4ever was not the movie that it's predecessors had been.  While I watched this I was thinking about it being a real long television episode.  This is partially biased due to my dislike of cute legendary Pokemon.  I think their plots really dwindle.  Although Suicune is one of my favorites I think a little more air time with him would have been more exciting.  I was thinking delving deeper into a connection between Suicune and Celebi.,1200960000,,501,4.636363636363637
1818056,5,B00007KK1E,"I love Pokemon. The good guys always win and the bad guys always learn a lesson and often times help the good guys out, sometimes without even knowing it.  Plus, anything that keeps my daughter entertained is wonderful.  My daughter fell in love with Pokemon at 4 years old and is now 12 and still loves it.  This movie has gotten alot of use in our household.",1166832000,,360,4.343283582089552

The pokeshort was funny. A goodmovie next to the first 3.",1130716800,,377,4.25
1818058,5,B00007KK1E,The movie is the next segment in the Pokemon movies which supplies everything on hopes and dreams of a pokemon warrior named Ash Ketchim and his friends.

This adventure takes on with a new pokemon called Celebi a time pokemon. Go join Brock and Misty to find all sorts of new things!,1124928000,2,411,4.493333333333333
1818059,5,B00007KK1E,"I think this is the very best Pokemon movie so far I have seen.  I like the music the best especially in ""Pikachus Pikabu"".",1122768000,3,123,4.125
1818060,4,B00007KK1E,"Pokemon 4Ever: Celebi: The Heart of the Forest is a great movie for Pokemon lovers of all ages.  The story is about a boy named Sam who is on a Pokemon sketching trip in the forest, when a mysterious little green alien-like Pokemon named Celebi appears.  Celebi is frantically escaping from a Pokemon hunter. Celebi's power is time travel.  (What a unique concept for a Pokemon! Just when you thought they ran out of ideas for powers and abilities). Sam and Celebi are transported forty years in the future, to Ash and Pikachu's time.

The future has a bigger, badder, hunter.  The Masked Marauder of Team Rocket has a horrible Dark Pokeball.  Any Pokemon trapped in a Dark ball will turn evil, and have his powers multiply.  This concept is horrible.  Who would come up with such an evil thing in the Pokemon world where Pokemon are loved and respected?  The Marauder wants Celebi.  He trashes the forest with his evil arachnoid droid robot machine.  4Ever also features another legendary Pokemon, the beautiful and noble Suicune.  (He looks better than his name, folks).

Although Pokemon is a part of American entertainment now, it is important to remember that this was originally a Japanese cartoon.  This is evident in the gentle themes of the film: protecting the forest and the spirits of the forest.  In Japan, the main religion is Shinto, which believes the natural world is full of benevolent spirits which we must honor and care for.

This DVD is loaded with special features.  There is a short called ""Pikachu's Pikabu"" that is fun for kids, mind-numbing for adults.  There is a trivia game that features clips of the film with every question answered.  Both American and Japanese trailers for the film are included.  The Japanese one is fun to watch - they show the voice actors recording.  It is obvious they are having a lot of fun.  There is audio commentary, and the Japanese trailer for Pokemon 5, which is the ""sneak peek"" mentioned.  But it is not in English.",1113264000,,1980,4.741935483870968

This is the only Pokemon movie (or episode) I've ever seen where a Pokemon died, you may want to get a box of tissues before the tears start flowing.
The movie was a bout a young professor Oak trying to save Celebi, then being transported into the future by it's special time traveling power. And of course, Ash and friends meet him and they team up to stop a powerful member of Team Rocket from taking over the world. This bad guy captures Pokemon with Dark Balls and turns Pokemon, even the nicest ones like Celebi, into evil Pokemon that want to destroy everything in site.
