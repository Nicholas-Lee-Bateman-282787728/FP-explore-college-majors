1923910,1,B0000DCYQT,I was fooled by the release date. The content of this DVD is probably from 1930's or 40's. I would not recommend to any parents unless they are looking for old Superman shows.,1125014400,7,175,4.333333333333333

1923915,5,B0000DCYQT,"Among the best cartoons made during the 1940's. The resolution and graphics still rival those made today. They were probably based off of live action models. If you are a new/old fan of Superman, you need to see these, if you haven't yet.",1469232000,,238,4.558139534883721

1923918,5,B0000DCYQT,Well done remastering!,1464652800,,22,6.666666666666667
1923919,4,B0000DCYQT,"This video contains the first 6 of the 9 Superman cartoons that were actually produced by Fleischer Studio for Paramount, omitting the last 3 that they produced as well as the 8 cartoons by Famous Studios that continued the series for Paramount in the Fleischers' style. So this review only applies to the first 6.

The first of the series is simply entitled, ""Superman"". This one is probably the best of the bunch; it had the biggest budget, and it does look fantastic. This video also contains ""The Mechanical Monsters,"" ""Billion Dollar Limited,"" ""The Arctic Giant,"" ""The Bulleteers,"" and ""The Magnetic Telescope."" They are all generally on a par with each other: Excellent animation, limited storytelling and extremely limited character development (which is what I would expect from a 10 minute short), and lots of action from start to finish.

Superman doesn't seem to be completely invulnerable yet (even seeming to be knocked unconscious on one occasion), and he seems to fly in some episodes, but merely leaps in other episodes. His limited power here actually makes his character more interesting than he would later become in the comics, when he became so powerful that they had to introduce Kryptonite... it was becoming tedious that Superman just couldn't be beaten.

These cartoons are must-see for superhero fans and animation fans. Perhaps the stories themselves don't hold up to repeated viewings, but they are beautifully animated and entertaining.",1462752000,6,1465,5.172995780590718
1923920,5,B0000DCYQT,Revolutionary in their time and still somehow timeless. So many other great animators were inspired by these shorts. Also it's nice to see a superman who's powers aren't limitless. None of this spin the earth backwards to reverse time nonsense.,1462492800,,244,5.125

1923926,5,B0000DCYQT,"My kids are 5 and 3 and absolutely love this cartoon!

Mild-mannered yes, but not an awkward fool. The villains are also masterfully crafted lunatics hellbent on bringing destruction down onto the city.

To say that the animation is terrific, especially for the time (late 1930's, early 40's) would be horrible understatement.  It is amazingly sophisticated.
The ONLY thing that might get a small warning is that - because of the pre-World War II timing - some of the cartoons portray villains that are stereotypes of our WWII enemies.  The cartoons are products of and reflections of their time.  So there is an exaggerated emphasis on saboteurs and spies and such.",1399248000,6,728,5.1440677966101696

1924016,1,B0000DCYQT,"My 8 yr old son loves super-heroes and I thought this would be a good one for him to watch. Especially since most of the movies are PG-13 and episodes are expensive. Well, this one must have been made in the 1950' s. It is not the quality that children now days are use to. We watched for about 5 minutes laughing, mainly at how the narrator spoke, then he wanted to turn it off. Total waste of time. Wish there were no stars to give. I would maybe get this for a much younger child that is not use to movies.",1382659200,,509,4.0

1924019,1,B0000DCYQT,"Buy the Bosko version. It is complete, and has all the cartoons. This one is not. This version also removes all the original opening title sequences that introduce audiences to the Man of Steel. For some this might be a good thing since a lot of them can get repetitive but there are variations and I prefer to have the complete original presentations.",1207699200,2,352,4.603174603174603
1924020,1,B0000DCYQT,"The cover art is taken from work done by the late (At least I think he is dead.) and arguably the best of all the Superman artists, Curt Swan.  Unless you count Murphy Anderson whom I understand inked Swan's work. The two were often refered to as, ""Swanderson"".

At first blush. the cover art is almost enough to get you to buy it but then you think, ""Wait a minute, I have seen all the classic Superman cartoons"". Apparently this is just another attempt to package these classic cartoons with the up dated cover art.

Don't get me wrong. The original Superman cartoons were absolutely great ! I watched them as a child on tv and loved them, I was beside myself when I was able to purchase them on VHS about ten tears ago.

By all means get the original Superman cartoons. (All sixteen of them.) Just don't expect this particular offfering to be anything new or different.

Course the cover art IS by Curt Swan,,,",1153612800,5,913,4.4431137724550895
