This is one of those times that I was badly misled by my sense of nostalgia. Unlike some of my other cartoons favorites from this era (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and the Disney Afternoon stuff, for instance) Stone Protectors does not hold up well at all. I tried watching it with my son (who loves all the other shows I mentioned) and he could only make it through about five minutes of each episode before he lost interest. I'll not bother you with the show's mythos (you can Wiki that for yourself). I'm here to tell you to save your money buy not buying this garbage series. If you're curious about it, watch a few minutes of it on YouTube before buying it. If you've any sense at all of what good animation is, you'll let Stone Protectors recede into the dimmest part of your memory, where all unhappy childhood memories go to die.",1405555200,,940,4.377142857142857
