8347489,4,B001WB6N0M,"This film is going to be hit or miss for most of its core audience; on one hand, it`s much too 'artsy' for those seeking simplistic exploitation or sleaze, though it`s chock-full of nudity, decadence and perversion. Of course it is, it`s loosely based on the writings of the Grand Marquis de Sade, and the Asian interpretation is unique unto itself. On the other hand, it also displays way too much nudity and depravity for the snobby Arthouse audience, who will too quickly and undeservedly dismiss it as trash. For those who can enjoy both, remembering that a pendulum swings in both directions always, there is quite a bit to enjoy. Director Akiko Jissoji is skillful at startling imagery, scene composition and carefully detailed lighting, never showing too much offensive material at once, having the camera continually drift to other objects again and again in subtle symbolism. The storyline is dramatic, but doesn`t require reexamination here - it`s all right there in Amazon`s product details, which were lifted word for word off the dvd cover. The decadent Count who presides over his lewd dinner guests are all a sight to behold, enjoying gluttonous banquets off the backs of naked, kneeling servants, groping and fondling the food servers while telling tales of cruelty and lasciviousness with glee. But these perversions and overindulgences have a cost, as always, but I won`t spoil it here. Mondo Macabro always goes out on a limb w/ extras and previews, that`s why we love them, so decide for yourself it it`s Art, Trash, or Trashy Art - I enjoyed it.",1267574400,12,1566,4.9356060606060606
