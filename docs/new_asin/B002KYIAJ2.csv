3945208,5,B002KYIAJ2,"I just wanted to say one thing: this re-up of Evangelion will absolutely, positively not change anyone's mind. If you hated the original series, there's still nothing here for you. However, if you loved or even just liked the original (like myself), then 1.0 is like a dream come true. The animation is superb, and while there aren't any huge changes to the story (it's still pretty much the same, scene by scene), they did adjust, add, and subtract just enough to make it all alot tighter and more compelling. This is the definitive version that all newbies should check out. Everything else has been said quite well by other reviewers. Enjoy.",1259539200,,644,4.758928571428571
3945209,5,B002KYIAJ2,"I had heard that Hediaki had summed up 1.0 as a ""faithful remake"". So I expected no real surprises, But I was totally surprised. My dear Misato is perfect. Shinji still needs a better ass woopin than Toji can give him. Gendo Ikari sounds awesome. Speaking of sound, the whole movie sounds spectacular. I think it's a better achievement than the visuals. The last angel featured in the movie has a way scarier presence and menacing sound effects. I like the material lifted from the various mangas included in the movie. And like I said. There are actually two or three BIG surprises. Funny how dropping a subtle bomb during a conversation makes just as big a splash as a huge reveal. And in the spirit of the original Anime, we get a peak at 2.0 at the end along with the promise of fan service. :)

From what spoilers I've read I am prepared to fall for Asuka again, but not to see her suffer. And this time I hear Shinji's gonna feel a whole new kinda hurt, in connection to Asuka's pain. I still don't know if I can watch all that go down. TT_TT",1259107200,2,1048,4.319796954314721
3945210,4,B002KYIAJ2,"Absolutely emo with action and destruction galore combined with beautiful, vibrant visuals, solid tweaking of the original storyline and the first rebuild film that ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" fans will truly adore.  Evangelion: 1.01 - You Are (NOT) Alone is highly recommended!

In 2006, Japnese fans and anime fans of ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" received exciting news that in the Summer of 2007, the first of four Evangelion films based on the anime television series would be released in theaters.  According to news reports, Evangelion creator Hideaki Anno watched the series from beginning to end and wanted to fix up a lot of questions and debates that fans had over the television series and most importantly, incorporate today's new CG technology for the film versions.  Even furthering the excitement is that the original crew and cast have signed on to work on the new film.

So, with mass promotion in Japan, ""Evangelion 1.01 - You Are (Not) Alone"" became the #1 film in Japan making over $14.6 million (US), surpassing ""The End of Evangelion"" which brought in $14.5 million (US).  A limited edition DVD was released in Japan in 2008 which came with a script, music videos and an ""Explanation of Evangelion"" feature and needless to say, fans paid dearly for this limited edition DVD release (only 300,000 were made).

A Blu-ray and DVD release titled ""Evangelion 1.11' which included a re-transfer of the film plus three additional minutes was released in May 2009 and is currently the best selling Blu-ray release in Japan.  Followed by the theatrical release of the second film ""Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance"" released in theaters in July 2009.

With many Americans waiting for a DVD release, an announcement was made in 2008 by FUNimation Entertainment that would be releasing the ""Evangelion 1.01' DVD release first, followed by the ""Evangelion 1.11' Blu-ray release set for 2010.  Suffice to say, the film was released with a very short run at limited theaters and made over $100,000 and was screened at the anime convention Anime Expo in 2009 with great fanfare.

""Evangelion: 1.01 - You Are (Not) Alone"" is a film that takes the first six episodes of the TV series and features new animation and CG and a few different storyline details of certain characters but for the most part, creator Hideaki Anno made sure the film was faithful to the anime series.

In the first film, Shinji Ikari's father, the Supreme Commander of NERV, sends Lt. Colonel Misato Katsuragi to pick up Shinji, while the city is being attacked by another Angel (aliens destroying Earth).  When he is brought to Tokyo-3 at NERV HQ, immediately his father expects him to pilot the Evangelion Unit-01.

Shinji, who thought he could spend some time with his father or somehow have some father and son bond is shocked that he is brought all that way to pilot the Evangelion and immediately breaks down.  When Shinji refuses, his father asks for the injured Rei Ayanami to pilot her Evangelion unit.  But Shinji sees her, hurt and bloody from her last battle that he ends up accepting the mission and taking on the Angel.

Shinji pilots the Evangelion Unit-01 and defeats the angel but in the process, a large part of the city is destroyed.

Shinji is brought to Misato's home and will temporarily live at her place but meanwhile, Shinji who wants his father's love and attention, can't understand why he is being used and why he is the one being selected to fight the Angels.  Weak and feeling alone, even his classmates bully and beat him up because of the destruction he caused while fighting the Angel.

This leads to Shinji questioning his life, his father and his purpose.  But when he meets Rei Ayanami, he starts to become curious towards her.  Meanwhile, more angels show up but with Shinji in such a negative and depressed mood, can he handle the burden of being the hero that must protect humankind?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Evangelion 1.01' is featured in 16:9 and for the most part, the animation looks fantastic on DVD.  The CG animation is top notch and overall, Gainax definitely went all out in creating a fantastic anime full of detail, vibrant colors and staying faithful to the anime series but making sure everything is updated and looks amazing.  Of course, I look forward to the High Defintion Blu-ray release of this film but for those who only purchase DVD's, you can't go wrong with this release.  It looks absolute fantastic.

As for audio, audio is presented in English and Japanese 5.1.  Personally, I never listened to the original ADV Films English dubs, so I can't comment on how the newer voice dubs are with the original but from what I hear from friends and have read, fans were more than grateful for the voice dubbing for ""Evangelion 1.01'.  As for the Japanese voice acting, I was so happy to see everyone return and most importantly, knowing that the film can definitely take advantage of lossless audio for the Blu-ray releaese because the DVD release is no audio slouch.  Great use of sound from various channels, great use of LFE during the action sequences and booms and destruction can be heard all around you.  Overall, a solid 5.1 soundtrack and fans should be happy with the release as both PQ and AQ are fantastic.

Subtitles are in English only.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Evangelion: 1.01 - You Are (Not) Alone"" comes with no special features.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When I first heard that the rebuild of ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" would take place and that these new films would be based on the television series, I wasn't so surprised because the series is so popular that it would definitely generate an extreme amount of money for GAINAX.  But one thing that I was not looking forward and what drove me crazy about the TV series was the character of Shinji Ikari.  Back in the mid-90's, I can easily remember how his whining really tested my patience and looking back, he was such an anti-hero, mainly because he was ""emo"" most of the time.  Always negative, always in a bit of depression and funk as he always felt people didn't care about him (and yes, I know that Hideaki Anno was clinically depressed when he was creating this film and parts of show was based on his depression) but it did get on my nerves at the time.

But here we are nearly 15 years later and watching ""Evangelion 1.01 - You Are (Not) Alone"" and after it was all done, I was excited and hoping the second film would come out stateside very soon.  Yes, Shinji still whines and is still depressed but the fact is the film is structured a bit differently from the anime TV series and somehow, the pacing is much easier to take for the viewer with the film version and felt that the screenplay for the first film, the quality of the animation and artistic backgrounds and the music all worked together fantastically.

In a way, some part of me wants to rewatch first six episodes of the television series to find out the key differences (it's been 14 years and I can't recall too much from the television series except certain key scenes and the final episodes) were but personally, I found myself happy and content with this film that I look forward to seeing how Anno and the GAINAX crew tweak the next three films (and I can't wait until the final film).  But for the most part, I felt that the film, the voice acting, the animation, the art and everything else about the film was well done and fantastic.

As for the DVD release, as much as I enjoyed the film, I wish that there were some special features included but there aren't.  So, that was the only negative that I found with this DVD release thus far.  I know that there will be a lot of fans who may feel that a 90-minute film telling the story of a six-episode series is going to omit quite a bit of backstory and I agree to a point.  Unlike ""Gunbuster vs. Diebuster"", I seriously feel that fans should watch the OVA's of both anime series before buying the films.  But since there are continuing films, I kind of feel its in the same boat as the classic ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" trilogy and its long TV series in which there are people who have no interest in watching a full series but watching the films are good enough. Granted they may be missing some pertinent storylines shown in the TV series that showcase more character development but in a way, I think that viewers not familiar with the ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" TV series can understand what is going on and what is happening by watching the film.

As for the PG-13 rating, yes, ""Evangelion 1.01' has its share of violence and nudity, so this is not a series that you want to have your little kids around watching at all.

But overall, in the end, it was great to see Evangelion again but this time with the much improved reboot.  Nearly 15-years-later, it was definitely great to see Evangelion again but this time in a film sporting newer animation, CG, artwork and a solid screenplay and soundtrack.  But most importantly,  done in the way that the director Hideaki Anno had wanted but also what the fans have wanted as well.  And after I watched the film,  I can tell you that I loved it! The action, the drama is still intact.  Things may be a little different but still, fans of the original series will definitely enjoy this film release.

""Evangelion: 1.01 - You Are (Not) Alone"" is highly recommended!",1259020800,5,9328,4.673806609547124
3945211,4,B002KYIAJ2,"Fans of the fantastic anime series NEON GENESIS EVANGELION will no doubt embrace ""EVANGELION 1.0: You Are Not Alone"". The film is the first series of four films titled the ""Rebuild of Evangelion"" which will be a compressed retelling of the anime series and the two big screen films with better animation, a much more tighter and compressed storyline, and the promise of a newer, better ending (fans thought that the climax in the series was unsatisfactory). Creator HideakI Anno and company know that their bread and butter lies in the majesty of Evangelion; it is an excellent blend of huge robots, shonen action, existentialism, pure human angst and apprehensive self-determination. This first film, Evangelion 1.0 is a retelling of the first six episodes.

After the events of the second impact that nearly annihilated mankind, Tokyo-3's hopes for survival lie with a 14-year old Shinji Ikari (voiced by Megumi Ogata) and his ability to pilot the EVANGALION Unit 01; a massive sentient robot designed by his father, Gendo Ikari (Fumihiko Tachiki) to fight against an alien invasion mounted upon humanity called the Angels. Shinji's hopes for a simple reunion with his father are dashed as Gendo proves to be one cold-hearted parent. Taken under the wing of commander Misato Katsuragi (Kotono Mitsuishi), the young man reluctantly fights against the invaders' awesome firepower. But for reasons only he can decipher, Shinji finds himself drawn to another EVA-unit 00 pilot, Rei Ayanami (Megumi Hayashibara)...

There is much that is left unexplained in the film since this is the first of four films planned by writer HideakI Anno and directors Masayuki and Kazuya Tsuumaki. The motivations behind the attack is hinted on and as to why and how youngsters Shinji and Rei were chosen to pilot the giant robots aren't fully explained; all the details will come later in this new series. ""Evangelion"" fans will no doubt be more able to fill in the gaps and may offer little in the way of surprises. Much of the film's main draw would come from the improved animation that blends traditional cell animation and CGI. It also introduces little changes to the characters' introduction but this may also prove to be the film's best assets as it strengthens the feeling of familiarity in its set designs and atmosphere that just gives a lot of depressing plot elements. For those unfamiliar with ""Evangelion"", this film is great way to start since the storyline is much tighter, easier to connect with and arguably more taut than the anime series.

However, there's also less to get into in a mere less than 2-hour film. The more compact storyline does work in some ways but the more verbal approach in the film's exposition makes the underlying themes and notions become a little more obvious. The methodical approach in the anime series gets a little lost which may prove to be either the film's weakness or strength depending on the viewer's perception. In this approach, Shinji's self-loathing and depression gets a little redundant quickly because he isn't given enough space to breathe and for viewers to form an attachment to him. The beauty of the ""Evangelion"" series if the unnerving fact that two people who are barely in their teens are fighting a war to defend mankind. I guess in this more compact approach, Shinji becomes a mere child full of self-pity rather than a sympathetic figure who has become the anime poster child for depression. Shinji appears to be depressed most of the time, and newcomers to ""Evangelion"" will more likely feel a little disconnected and maybe even annoyed. Japanese non-fans will still form a connection since existentialism and angst are deeply embedded in most Japanese sci-fi movies, I have some uncertainties whether it would `click' with newer American audiences.

The robot battles are awesome to behold. I really enjoyed the manner with which the Angels varied in its approaches in its attacks, each one becoming deadlier than the next. The way that the NERV team approaches its battles aren't more on brute force but more on strategy that rests on Shinji's resolve to pilot the EVA. Things don't usually work out as planned, but Shinji and Commander Katsuragi do get by. I loved the way the direction remembers to instill emotion in the pilot's cockpit; Shinji is a young, inexperienced pilot after all, it is only his resolve to stay that keeps him alive. Ayanami has more determination to see things through.

For a film supposedly marked to attract new fans, I think ""Evangelion 1.0"" feels more aimed to its solid fan base. The copious expositions and the familiar back story would be easily understood by fans of the series. The film is a little opaque with its storytelling at times, the complexities of the 6 episodes in the series cannot be captured in a two hour movie. This is an anime film NOT for children as it contains some nudity and suggestive themes (Katsuragi is often in suggestive positions). It is a bit early to judge whether this new ""Rebuild the Evangelion"" would prove as compelling as the anime series, as this is only the first of a new 4-parter. It looks almost the same and I can't say as of now if this new series would do anything different; only time will tell. However, I am enough of an EVA fan to stick around to find out.

Highly Recommended to `EVA' fans and a recommended rating to those unfamiliar with the anime series [4- Stars]

Note: Watching the film in its original Japanese language is highly advisable.",1258675200,6,5492,4.892588614393126
3945212,5,B002KYIAJ2,"I remember watching the entire neon genesis evangelion series as a kid. I remember everything from the insanely catchy intro to the completely authentic scream that Megumi Ogata delivers as Shinji.  What I remember best though is the overlying tug of emotions between Shinji, Rei, Shinji's father, and Misato. If you have been a fan of Evangelion, there is no need for me to convince you that neon genesis evangelion was a masterpiece. But what of the film release, you are (not) alone?
Let me start by explaining that this is not a new film with new animation on the characters - it's a remake. To be honest it really isn't anything you haven't seen in your old vhs collection. But that's where everything matters - add in a fresh palette of colors, put in smoother framerates and more vivid animation - and suddenly you see something different. That's the case for me. For one, I enjoyed the visuals and the beautiful settings that are presented in v. 101. There is one scene that was added that I feel made my purchase worthwhile - the fight scene between the 6th angel (blue cube angel). It is completely remastered and redone to be the epic fight hideaki anno always wanted to present. Other parts really make this remake worth your viewing and purchase - but you have to see it for yourself to understand the scope and grand epic that this title undertakes.

The summary:
Overall you'll feel like you are watching a remastered and redone Neon Genesis Evangelion. You WILL be disappointed if you were expecting a new film with cgi fight scenes. However, a fan that goes for this sort of remakes (like me) will be all over this film and craving to watch it multiple times. Do yourself a favor and try for yourself to see if this film matches your expectations. As for me, I'm all ready for you can (not) advance, v. 2.01 already.",1258502400,3,1833,4.585365853658536
3945213,4,B002KYIAJ2,"Love or hate the Giant Robot genre of anime, there is no denying the resounding influence the Evangelion franchise has had on the industry since its introduction back in 1997.  I'm a self-admitted mecha-head and to have an opportunity to go back and witness the beginning of it all was quite an experience.  Thanks to FUNimation, the masses will now have that same opportunity with their North American release of Evangelion: 1.01, the full length motion picture.

Hard facts first: The release is comprised of a single disc, housed in a standard sized dvd case with a cardboard outer slip cover with art that directly mimics the case within.  The program's runtime comes in at 98 minutes and wears an appropriate PG-13 rating due to animated action, violence and some ambiguous nudity.

Language options are standard sub & dub fair, which means the viewer is given the option of running the original Japanese dialog track or an English dub, either of which is presented in Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound.  The option to turn on English subtitles exists for either language choice as well.

Extras are essentially nonexistent save for an included booklet that explains precisely what this rebuilt DVD means and a note from the original screenplay writer and Chief Director of the project, Hideaki Anno.

The story, while straightforward enough in presentation, has been the source of case studies, web-site devotion, even college thesis throughout the years and hence could never be summarized accurately (with dignity) here.  However, to reduce it all down to its most basic levels, a young boy by the name of Shinji is thrust into a world beyond comprehension once an attacking ""Angel"" comes to town.  It turns out that Shinji is one of few individuals in the world who possesses the rare ability to pilot the massive synthetic beings/ weapons known as Evangelions.

Reluctantly he allows himself to submit to the whirlwind of life-changing experiences associated with becoming an Evangelion pilot and makes some new friends and discovers more about his own past in the process.  Working for a top-secret, underground (literally) organization known as NERV, Shingi's life as an average 14-year-old is forever lost to the reality that his destiny is to be the one to save all of mankind from imminent doom.

So here it is precisely twelve years since this very material graced Japanese movie screens, you may rightfully be wondering what it is that FUNimation is releasing here.  The answer is a bit complex, but I'll do my best to set it straight.

Way back in October of 1995, the animated television series Neon Genesis Evangelion made its television debut in Japan.  Two years later the work was ""rebuilt"" into a theatrical release that essentially spliced together the key moments of the tale into a larger, single effort.  The mission was a success but kind of like what George Lucas has done with his Star Wars franchise, the creators behind the property always felt as though the technology available at the time wasn't quite where they would have liked it to be to accurately present the tale visually.  Hence in 2007, the material was revisited once more, this time not simply remastering from the original film stock, but rather breaking the material down into its raw form so as to correct and readjust even the smallest imperfections such as animation density and errant particles as a result of using film.  It was not so much an exercise of splicing new CGI effects and eye-candy into the original material as it was about using modern animation methods to perfect the look and feel of the original material.  As an added bonus the CG elements allow for visual flair that was, at the time, quite impossible to achieve.

Hence that brings us back to this, the 1.01 release, which is the first official North American release of this rebuilt movie series (it is scheduled to be presented in 4 parts total, with the third and fourth parts being released together).  Obviously, part 1.01 being reviewed here is the introduction to the story.

If the timeline appears confusing, rest assured that sorting it all out is by no means a prerequisite to enjoying the film.  It starts quickly with very little time spent establishing back-story and sweeps the viewer into a truly unique world where the precision and color pallet of modern computer generated animation melds seamlessly with the unique look of hand-drawn cells of yesteryear.

Plot wise, the tale is brisk and wonderfully entertaining with battle sequence on the absolute grandest scale broken up by moments of genuine character-development and emotional attachment.  Perhaps the greatest of these being the sexual tension that exists between the lead characters or the appearances of the enigmatic father of young Shinji.

Fans, detractors, and scholars alike have gone to great lengths in drawing parallels and comparisons to Evangelion's symbolism throughout the years and yet agreement to or even knowledge of these theories is by no means necessary to come away from the film with satisfaction.

In fact, it has actually surprised me in revisiting this film (which is actually made up of the first six episodes of the original television series) at how much of an influence Evangelion has had over subsequent Giant Robot anime franchises like RahXephon and Aquarion.  The show is rife with familiar archetypes such as the young boy being thrust into the role of humanity's savior, the biomechanical weaponry/ interfaces, the enigmatic villains that refuse to reveal their intentions, the impassive corporation behind it all, and the dysfunctional family structure that makes the antagonist question his very purpose of existence.  Evnagelion is essentially the framework from which all others have followed.

The direction is simply wonderful with the structure of the film being more an endless succession of perfectly framed scenes than a random display of visuals.  The voice acting is also quite notable whether you choose to enjoy the original Japanese dialog track (which is spectacular by the way) or the freshly dubbed English track featuring the talents of some of FUNimation's finest performers.  Either option represents the perfect accompaniment to the impeccable visual work.

In all this release marks the beginning of a franchise that has been deserving of revalidation for quite some time.  The approach taken with rebuilding the film from the basic elements must surely have been quite an undertaking for all involved but I can attest that the finished product simply oozes with hints of the level of perfectionism sought out in the process.  Amazing things are truly possible when such a revered and definitive property receives the loving caress of modern technology's capabilities.  This is highly recommended anime.",1258156800,44,6806,5.088129496402877
3945214,5,B002KYIAJ2,"This show is very good, but I would wait for v. 1.11 which is on blu-ray and has been extended by approximately 2 minutes. If you're a hard core fan like me, the wait is worth it.",1256428800,9,179,3.864864864864865
3945215,4,B002KYIAJ2,"This review is on the movie; I haven't bought the DVD yet. Evangelion: 1.01 You Are (Not) Alone is a complete remake of the original animation, utilizing the latest animation technique to recreate the images. A good majority of the original vantage points are preserved in the presentation of the new version. Lavish use of computer graphics gives the world of Evangelion a more realistic and tantalizing look. Mechanisms of Tokyo 3 take on a new level of complexity and details, and action sequences look smoother and much better executed; these alone are worth the ticket price.

Two Angels are depicted in this re-animation of Evangelion, and both are given new look and deeper character development. The climax is on the battle with the 2nd Angel, which was Angel #5 in the original OVA. The animators have obviously dispensed with considerable efforts in the re-conceptualization of this Angel and its capabilities. It is not only eye-opening to see the new ideas conjured up by the animators, but also the new preparation sequence of Tokyo 3 in combating the Angel. I am simply glad that the animators worked on the re-animation so seriously. Of course, the only regret I have for this movie is the ""panties"" scene that the animators also decided to preserve from the OVA, because I thought that the animators have finally decided to respect the intelligence of the more mature audience with all the enhancements and hard work. In the end, the ""panties"" scene relegated Evangelion once again to pleasing the hormone-raging teenage audience, thereby offending the adults.",1255046400,7,1576,5.038314176245211

Ive seen the series of Eva minus the two orignal films and this i thought was a great representation for the series as they are rebuilding it as said in its orignal title line of Rebuild of Evangelion. Things are the same as far as some stuff and others are different which makes it fun. Being how the glipses i saw of 2.0 are ill most likely get the series as well as these movies cause the movies will differ a bit more from the series than being a redoing exactly, but i say if you like Evangelion definatly at least rent this if possible. This anime isn't for everyone but i say give it a try for being a very interesting anime and well done, unfourtnately though on these rebuild movies it may take a bit to finish being as there are 4 movies total and 2 as of now are still not released in japan, but still this is fun to watch expecally if you know the series.

Not only is that one color corrected, but it has 2 minutes more footage explaining the complex narrative, and is offered in Blu-Ray.  Skip the 1.01 release and just get 1.11.  Otherwise, it's a great edit/retelling of the original series, with new characters and different events playing out.

3945224,4,B002KYIAJ2,"Since the original TV series and movie(s) left most of the average otaku with a serious ""WTF"" taste in their mouth, director Hideaki Anno decided to do a Star Wars: Special Edition take on the Neon Genesis: Evangelion saga, except this time its a whole remake of the story. This was the first a four-part movie series which will retell the story, but add several new elements to it. Although it might not seem like it in this first film, as its mostly a newly scripted adaptation of Eps. 1-6 of the TV series.

It begins during the 20-teens, some years after what was called the Second Impact which  destroyed Antarctica by a monster classified as an Angel. This caused a large portion of the world's population to be killed, so in order to prevent a possible Third Impact a special originization called NERV is put together to protect the Second Angel called Lillith underneath an underground base in a geo-front. When a new Angel appears, NERV is sprung into action to prevent an Angel from coming in contact with Lillith which could cause Third Impact and end the world. Gendo Ikari, the head of NERV, gets his unwilling son Shinji to pilot their ultimate weapon, Evangelion Unit 01. The Evas are giant mechanical humanoids that can be operated only by a select group of fourteen year olds. Shinji manages to take out the one Angel, and starts to settle into his new life in the city of Tokyo-3 where NERV headquarters is. He moves in with the sexy captain Misato and her pet penquin, although his school life is a little harsh. The arrival of another Angel breaks Shinji in with some new friends though. As he starts to learn more about the pilot of the protoype Unit 00, the enigmatic Rei Ayanami, the next Angel attacks which proves to be more of a problem. With the combined efforts of the Japanese government and Rei's near sacrificing herself, Shinji manages to snipe the Angel's ass away. The film ends with the character of Karou(who doesn't show up in the TV series until near the end)awakening on the moon and talking to the head of SEELE, the secret cabal that actual commands NERV.

Now, this first movie seems like the other three flicks will be also just rewrites of the original story. However, the recently released second movie actually takes a very different turn with the introduction of new Eva Units and new pilots. Plus major changes in the characters, like Asuka is now a captain, and a slightly different take on Rei's origins. The story folds out a little better in this movie than it did in the first few TV episodes, aside from no explaniation given as to why Shinji got beaten up by Toji at school. However, alot of positive factors were added to it, like Gendo's planning in advance for Rei and Shinji to develop a relationship, and the revelation of Lillith in NERV very early on which is something that unknown even to Misato until much later in the TV series. The animation is of course seriously upgraded, and makes a real difference in the theatrical quality. I have the feeling that despite this film seems like a retread of the old show, that when its compared to the other three movies after they're released it will look like a more fitting beginning to this quadrilogy. But only time will tell that.",1260835200,3,3241,4.613518197573657
3945225,4,B002KYIAJ2,"In a nutshell this is an hour and a half long rehash of the original series, they have revamped what the angel's look like a little, and there is obviously a few scenes of computer CG thrown in, but you won't miss much if you skip from this first volume to the second volume due out soon I imagine in the U.S.  I won't state exactly what happens at the end of this volume to avoid spoilers, but the end of this volume IS completely different from the original series.  I gave it only 4 stars because...it really wasn't spectacular, so that's my opinion!",1260576000,,553,4.3076923076923075
3945226,2,B002KYIAJ2,"I REALLY wanted to look forward to this movie.  Neon Genesis Evangelion was one of the most groundbreaking anime series of the 90's, mixing giant mech action with an intense psychological profile of the main characters as they were broken apart bit by bit each episode, and when word got out that there was going to be a new 4-film adaptation of the entire series, it seemed too good to be true.  This feature, You Are (Not) Alone, retells the first six episodes of the original TV show.  Unfortunately, it's not that much a retelling as it as a retread.  Aside from literally the last 20 seconds or so of the movie, there is absolutely nothing that differs from the TV series.  The animation, while good, is even drawn exactly as the original episodes were.  If anything, it moreso cuts out scenes from the series, and feels more like a cheap abridged version of the complete storyline; you'd get more enjoyment out of watching the original six episodes back to back.  The total lack of extras does not help either.  You'd think with a high-profile license like Evangelion, FUNimation would give this the same treatment they did to say, Fullmetal Alchemist, and load it up with a boatload of special features and extras.  Nope.  Despite this little fact it gets absolutely nothing but a barebones menu and some trailers, which destroys any redeeming value for the DVD release of an already lackluster film.  If you're a fan of the Evangelion series, I highly suggest that you skip this one and wait for the sequel.  That's where the real action begins.",1259798400,9,1553,4.711111111111111

For me, this looks amazing, in comparison to the platinum box collection released in 2007 - not by much, but there is a noticeable difference. However, for me, all that gave the series episodes depth and interest has gone. To use a mate-desirability analogy, this release is a bit like a supermodel that looks stunning but is superficial in character and acts like someone you have no desire to spend any time with, to put it politely.

Yes, this release looks great, but all the interaction between characters has been cut out and we don't really get to know the characters or gain any understanding of their personalities - possibly because there is not time for them to shine. What we get is one ""bot attack"" after another. I think this was done just to squeeze as many episodes as possible in to a single film. These fights look great, but what we have is fight after fight with very little discernible story. I couldn't empathise with any of the characters, consequently, I didn't care much for what little story there was. At the end, I really wasn't bothered about seeing the subsequent films.

What lets this film down even more is the time between subsequent films. This is one of three, but the time between each release is >1yr.

I was not impressed with this release. Let's hope that the long awaited ""live action"" version, if it ever actually happens, is more true to the original episodes of the series. In summary, I'd say avoid this and go for the aforementioned 2007 platinum box set.",1421452800,,1546,4.631386861313868

EVA 1.11 is a better version of this, but if you want this for the sake of owning it, then by all means, make the purchase. The is as displayed. The case for me was a little dented looking in some places, but there is no damage. There aren't any major booklets or artwork inside though, which was somewhat of a bummer. EVA 1.01 is more of a have-it-just-to-have-it item. I suggest EVA 1.11 if you're looking to actually watch the DVDs.",1401840000,,502,4.239583333333333
