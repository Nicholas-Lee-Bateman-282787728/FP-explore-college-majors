6068239,1,B00GA3R5N6,"RICHARD THE LIONHEART (USA/Italy-2013) features Malcolm McDowell and a no-name cast.
Alas, its stink 3.0 IMDb rating is well-earned, for ""Richard"" is every bit as rancid as reviewers suggest.
Like indigestion, speed traps or mummers parades, this film is to be avoided at all costs.

Cartoonishly harsh visuals don't help to convey the story, which isn't worth trying to fathom anyway.
It plays like a dank video game with levels to be achieved. (Accomplish these three tasks and get out of jail free.)

After all the bad photography and special effects, crap music and out of place dialog like ""I want to keep my options open,""
the big har-de-har comes at the fadeout when McDowell sneers into the camera and announces ""We're going to war!""
A sequel? No way!
Yes way, it seems.
As of this posting, writer/producer/director Stefano Milla is hard at work on RICHARD THE LIONHEART: REBELLION
and guess who ISN'T in the cast?..............That's right, Malcolm McDowell.
But fear not Lionheart fans, for Gregory Chandler (aka Chandler Maness) returns as Richard,
plus 'B' horror movie superstar Debbie Rochon will play Eleanore of Acquitaine. Oh bliss.",1390521600,13,1149,5.13903743315508
6068240,1,B00GA3R5N6,"I don't know what is worse about this movie: the plot, the cinema photography, the music, or the special effects.  The closest analogy I can think of is ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" without the jokes. Although I'm disappointed I wasted an hour watching it (I started fast forwarding to get to the good parts and couldn't find any), at least I only wasted $1.50 by renting it on RedBox and didn't actually buy it.",1390348800,12,417,4.4868421052631575

6068249,1,B00GA3R5N6,If I could give it 0 stars I would. I'm sure I get more money for my birthday then these people got for funding. Everything about this movie except the costumes was terrible. The swords were fake and there was never any blood. Every guy seemed to be stabbed on the side right in between his arm and his side. I can't believe I just wasted time to watch this movie. Don't recommend it at all.,1442102400,,391,4.157894736842105

After the guy hucks a gladius at an archer who's up on a hilltop... which strikes him square in the chest leaving him dead and then oh yeah.. catches the guys arrow I thought I had seen enough. But once Caesar finds the magical sword. ""really just the next scene someone just walks up and hands it to him"" He then proceeds to kill everyone even though the chick just walked up and handed it to him without a fuss. Just about everything is wrong with this movie. I haven't even started to talk about how the entire background just looks like crappy CGI too...

6068261,3,B00GA3R5N6,"This is definitely not the worst movie I have seen recently.  The acting was OK.  The line delivery was amateur.  It is pretty violent. There is some near nudity and a couple of naked rear ends in it.  The screenplay was pretty weak.  The music was pretty good.  The special effects were OK.  The story was interesting and held my interest most of the time.  Some parts moved slowly.  I wouldn't recommend it as a family movie because the violence is pretty graphic.  Till the end, you didn't really know who was good and bad except for Richard.  I enjoyed watching it once.",1439164800,,574,4.475728155339806

6068264,1,B00GA3R5N6,"Quite possibly the worst movie ever made. Right from the get go it's bad. There's a rape scene in the first 10 minutes and the acting is as uncomfortable as the rape itself. I don't just mean supporting actors are bad. The lead in the movie, the guy playing Richard the Lionheart, is the worst actor in the movie. And speaking of Richard the Lionheart that is where any historically accurate plot stops. By which I mean there was a guy named Richard the Lionheart. If your in a laughing mood rent it. This movie can not have been meant to be taken seriously. There are some production values which is mind boggling cause you wonder who the hell bankrolled this thing. Someone was blackmailed because theres no way they read the script and said to themselves this story has to be told. it's just bad",1424390400,3,798,4.472602739726027

6068270,1,B00GA3R5N6,"Knowing that I am a fan of the Plantagenets, my husband thoughtfully rented this movie for us. As soon as we started it, he said, ""Why does this look like it was made in the 80's?!""

Many others have noted the failures in special effects, acting, and implausibility, and they are 100% correct. This is like watching a film student's school project. You would only smile and applaud if it were made by your kid.

That's not the worst of it though, at least for me. The only portion of this film that is historically accurate is that Henry II had sons named Henry, John, and Richard. Geoffrey does not get a mention. Though we are told that the setting is 1172, each of the characters is portrayed as far older than they were at that time, especially Henry II who was only 39 in reality but made to appear a doddering grandpa.

Don't even get me started on the 1,000 year old curse involving Julius Caesar and some mostly naked woman who is killed and then haunts Richard a millennia later.

Amazingly bad. I will never get that 1 hour 44 minutes of my life back. Don't waste yours!",1399161600,,1080,4.385

6068274,1,B00GA3R5N6,It looks like someone filmed this with an old video camera from the 1980's. Poor storyline. Acting stinks. Malcolm MacDowell should be embarrassed.,1391817600,,147,5.434782608695652
6068275,1,B00GA3R5N6,"I tried my upmost to not only like this movie, but to finish it. Unfortunately for me, I could only endure about 15 minutes of it, if that.  First of all, instead of the guaranteed lowest pre order price, I paid more, by pre ordering  via Amazon.com. This is my first experience, having to pay more by ordering ahead of time. So, now I do not completely trust amazon. This video cost me just over $30.00. Second, the acting in my opinion is horrible, yes, it appears to be a low budget film, but there are plenty of great low budget films to watch, so the budget should not be the issue here. And third, I doubt seriously that king Henry II would have put one son against the other, knowing that he could loose a potential heir to his throne.  That is as far as I got in to the storyline. For anyone who has the patience to watch the entire video, my hat is off to you. For me, even 1 star has this video over- rated, especially when I consider the cost to me.",1391385600,12,960,4.122994652406417

6068278,1,B00GA3R5N6,"I took a chance on this movie at red box. Don't know why it sounded good. I suppose I was just in the mood for a mindless, medieval guy flick. So needless to say i went in with fairly low/reasonable expectations...maybe some nice sword play, blood and action. However, the special effects and cinematography were so bad that they made it impossible for me to suspend any sort of disbelief. Worse then most made for television movies out today. I have watched/enjoyed plenty of ""bad"" movies, but was unable to get any enjoyment from this. I fast forwarded and could find nothing remotely enjoyable.
