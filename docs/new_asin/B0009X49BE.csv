2331999,1,B0009X49BE,"I chose that rating because I was expecting the whole ""Animal HiJinks"" and not just a volume 1.  I didn't realize there was a Vol. 1 and more on another disk (somewhere).  I previously owned a disk with all of it on one disk and lost it.  I was glad to be able to order another but was disappointed when it was only part of it.  I cannot find the disk with the whole thing on it anywhere.  If I could, I would purchase it instead of the ""volume 1.""  Some of the best episodes are missing on this volume 1.",1388016000,3,505,3.9504950495049505

2332003,2,B0009X49BE,This was certainly not what I thought it would be!  Only 35 minutes long and LOT'S of the animal clips missing.  Feels like a rip off.,1247184000,7,134,4.115384615384615
2332004,5,B0009X49BE,What is on this short DVD is super funny but feel cheated it wasn't longer! A few years back I had purchased a Johnny Carson with animals on VHS and was much longer than this 35 minutes! So many of Johnny & the animals were missing out of here. Can remember at least 3 skits from VHS that was not included on this DVD. If there is a volume 2 I certainly will not be purchasing because of this rip-off.,1167696000,21,401,4.025

8068862,5,B0009X49BE,"Every time I watch this DVD, I laugh all over again. There was no one like Johnny Carson. No one could have done his reaction to the animals so great as Johnny. I love the one where he holds a baby gorilla. It is so tender. He actually treats it like a baby, but with Johnny's humor, makes fun out of it also. Great DVD. You won't be sorry.
