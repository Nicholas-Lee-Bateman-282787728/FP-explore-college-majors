8591501,4,B00020LWGY,"Another documentary from the DreamQuest Films documentary collection. This film explores the realm of ballroom dancing, but it is doing it in a way that I've never seen before. It follows several debutants who are about to experience ballroom dancing for the first time. The movie follows their path from their training to the actual gala events. I enjoyed this documentary a lot, though I wished it was a bit longer, and they should have showed more of the actual dances like they've done in 'Who says folklore can't be fun!'. Still great entertainment.",1088812800,,554,4.904255319148936
8591502,5,B00020LWGY,It's nice to know that certain ethnic communities can still preserve their cultures even though they are located many thousands of miles from their mother country. As a Hungarian I feel very proud that those two Hungarian communities can successfully carry on with such important cultural events as debutant balls. After watching this film I was filled with pride and hope that these and many other similar traditions are still passed down to the new generations Canadians and Americans who are all willing participants in these wonderful events. This film explains why it is so important to hang onto one's culture and how it can be applied positively for the younger generations. Definitely recommended for parents and grandparents who want to show their reluctant kids and grandkids how much fun it can be to participate in such great events.,1081814400,,845,5.086330935251799
