3008668,5,B000XUOIQY,"Afraid that I have so many movies that I don't remember who borrowed this.  But I don't regret getting this to go with my other Tinker Bell DVDs.

I couldn't find this in any book store, so I'm glad to say that I could once again find anything I'm looking for from Amazon.com.",1484092800,,352,4.303030303030303

3008670,5,B000XUOIQY,"Nearly every full length Disney movie has terrified my very empathic and easily scared 4 yr old.  Not this one.  She loved it!  She was a little concerned when Tink was sad, but with some encouragement she stuck it out to see that it all turned out to be ok.  Great message too, about loving and valuing your own talents!",1483315200,,321,4.3
3008671,5,B000XUOIQY,"I love all of the Tinker Bells movies. Its great for the real little ones just starting on movies - theres no scary monster like Ursula or Maleficent. And, if you're a Disney fan, this one has all the Magic of Tink herself. Good plot and nice graphics.",1482796800,,252,4.270833333333333
3008672,3,B000XUOIQY,"Good movie, but if you're kid is sensitive or a animal and nature lover it might upset them. My daughter fell in love with the beauty of this movie the first 45 minutes or so. She shreiked with delight over the ladybugs, sunflowers, and landscapes in general then toward the end all of it gets destroyed by a rather ambiguous and scary stampede of what I think is an army of angry weeds. Seems silly, but she's sensitive and that part gives her nightmares and makes her cry when watching it. It really is a great movie with an awesome message, but avoid if you're young ones are sensitive. I really didn't know how to explain to her why all the beloved fairy gardens and creatures got obliterated.",1482105600,,697,4.453125

3008689,5,B000XUOIQY,"My 3-year-old son loves watching this movie. We watch the firefly scene and ""mouse"" scenes over and over again. I like it because it never really gets too dark or scary so I feel it's better for my kids to watch than so many kids movies out there.",1477440000,,247,4.166666666666667

3008691,3,B000XUOIQY,"Born to a repressive totalitarian state, the all-powerful queen assigns Tinkerbell to the Tinker Caste at birth and tells her in no uncertain terms that will be her lot till the end of her days.  Shunned my higher-caste fairies, she tried to break out of her assigned role in life, but her efforts only bring disaster.  Ultimately she gives in, accepting her role but then using her skills to bring automation to the fairy world thereby undermining the power of the higher castes whose magical powers will no longer be needed.

Yeah, I'm being a bit snarky but that more or less is the plot.  Tinkerbell is assigned a role in life, tries to break out of it, fails, and ultimately becomes a cog in the system.  A perfect message for young children.

Despite the not-so-hidden corporate message it's a perfectly OK children's film.  Our daughters love it and want to be fairies for Halloween.

For adults there's not much to distinguish it.

There's no songs or musical numbers and the animation is OK at best.  Tinker and her friends all have that generic 'spunky girl' voice you hear in every cartoon and the sort of skin-deep diversity common in kid vids.  Skin tones vary but all the heroines have the same, bubbly personality, skinny body and heart-shaped face.

It spawned a franchise other other Tinkerbell films, which I'll probably end up getting for my girls.  But I can see them outgrowing this pretty quickly.",1477008000,,1419,4.742857142857143

3008754,5,B000XUOIQY,"The 2008 Tinkerbell movie centers around the character of Tinkerbell, a fairy reconciling both what her dreams are with what is part of her destiny. Fortunately, the people around her are extremely supportive of her and include among the other fairies; Rosetta, a garden fairy, iridessa a lightfairy, Silvermist, a water fairy, Fawn the animal fairy,  Fairy Mary, Terence the Pixie Dust Keeper, a Large Tinker Fairy, Bobble a tinker fairy with large glasses etc.  There are also the characters of Queen Clarion and Vidia. From an aspiring writer/scriptwriter  aspect, I enjoyed how the world itself that Tinkerbell lives in is detailed with so much bright color and the various nature themed concepts that encompass her world; the flowers, the bright sky, the homes that the fairies live in etc.",1451952000,,795,5.1

3008767,4,B000XUOIQY,"This is an absolutely delightful fairy tale, with beautiful scenics, beautiful people, well, fairies, and an endearing story. Too often big production animation films kind of forget they're supposed to have a story, so fascinated by the graphics and technological brilliance of the animation are they. This first Tinker Bell film explains her existence, and that of all the other fairies, along with Pixie Hollow, their magical home, and Neverland. Tinker Bell gets her name from the Queen right after she is ""born"" (of a baby's laugh). Tink has to pick implements that tell her what her talent is, but the Queen surely already has an idea of what that is. Tink walks by the hammer, and it simply radiates light brightly, indicating the level of her talent, which is substantial. Tinker Bell doesn't realize how much talent she has, and at first doesn't think being a tinker is such a big deal, but, as it turns out, she, and all of us, find out that her talent is perhaps the greatest of all the fairies, and that she is not just a ""tinker,"" but an inventor and engineer, creating magnificent, useful devices out of random washed-ashore junk from the mainland. Thereby hangs the tale, that she, and all the fairies at Pixie Hollow, come to know the value of precious Tink, and why she is the preeminent protagonist in all of her movies, starting with this one.  The whole series is a must see for anyone that loves fantasy, has a sense of humor, and enjoys visually stunning images, coupled with decent music.  They're not ""Frozen"", or ""Tangled,"" but they're not far off either.",1450051200,,1579,4.738181818181818

The DisneyToon Studios responsible for its creation and headed no less than by John Lasseter of Pixar fame, took great care to ensure the first to the last of the Tinker Bell movies not only have great stories, great characters (it's Tinker Bell c'mon now), but really great artistic and production value to boot.  They really set the bar high with each film only setting it higher.  As both a father and someone who loves animation, the series is simply wonderful, charming and something you will genuinely treasure for all time.  Well done Disney, well done!",1436832000,2,737,4.817460317460317
3008816,5,B000XUOIQY,"My 3 year old daughter has fallen for all of the Tinkerbell movies.  She really loves this one.  She especially loves the part where Tinkerbell rides her mouse friend ""Cheese"" in a rodeo-style roundup scene.  It's quite comical.  In this movie, there are many types of fairies...garden fairies, fast-flying fairies, light faires, etc.  Tinkerbell learns that not everyone respects the art of being a tinker fairy, so she decides she doesn't want to be a tinker anymore.  She tries to be something she's not and it ends up in disaster.  At the end of the movie, Tinkerbell learns that embracing who you are is important and she ends up saving the day with her tinker skills.  It's a movie about loving and believing in yourself, no matter what anyone else thinks.
On a different note, I looked all over the place trying to find a toy of ""Cheese"" the mouse.  Disney doesn't make toys of him, even though he's in all of the movies.  I ended up buying this one :  http://www.amazon.com/Douglas-Cuddle-Toys-247-Kernel/dp/B000HHM7UM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1436225472&sr=8-1&keywords=stuffed+mouse+kernel

3008850,5,B000XUOIQY,"This film is beautifully animated. I hate CG but they did a good job with this one.

People might complain Tink is too nice on this film or that she is a big ol baby throwing tantrums. I believe they found a good mix of both where we still have a bit attitude from the original Peter Pan to this new innocence Bell. Which makes complete sense to me because she was JUST born from laughter.",1432166400,,389,4.118421052631579

3008889,5,B000XUOIQY,"Finally! A Disney series I feel happy letting my daughter watch. No more Ariel giving up her passions for a guy she just met, or Belle playing Captain Fix a Jerk ""If I stay long enough, eventually he will be nice."" Now we have TinkerBell's story! This focuses around Tink and her good group of girl friends as they all discover their talents and follow their instincts and never give up. We have all of these movies, including The Pixie Hollow Games and The Search for the NeverBeast ( I think that's the title) and THESE movies I am thrilled to have on constant repeat. Instead of waiting for their princes-or in their cases, Sparrowmen- to save the day, these fairy women are hard working and making their world their own as they shine on messages like the meaning of friendship, getting back up when you're knocked down, and never giving up hope. They are empowering the females in these stories - the Tinker Guild isn't run by a man, it's run by Fairy Mary! And The Dust Keeper leader is Fairy Gary, who is proud to wear his kilt wherever he goes! I LOVE IT.  All of the actors,writers, animators, etc. should be proud for being apart of this. I hope they do some short movies featuring the Sparrowmen, too. Keep this coming, Disney. You're giving us what we want and we appreciate it.",1427673600,,1289,4.485106382978723

What's difficult to reconcile is the Tinkerbell character from this film and the same one in the original Peter Pan film who wanted to basically kill Wendy with a pirate canon and who obsesses over her hip size(!)  Basically toss continuity out the window and it's a fine kids story with colorful animation",1413158400,,423,4.716216216216216

3009079,5,B000XUOIQY,"The CGI-animated Disney Fairies property film Tinker Bell, on the surface, seems to be the kind of film that would be obviously be terrible. However, it is a surprisingly well-done and enjoyable film. Even as a property that exists solely to promote toys to children, the filmmakers still put significant effort into the character design, world design, music, and animation.

First off, the animation is fluid and well-done. Its not quite up to Pixar standard, but it comes close for DisneyToon Studios. The next noticeable good thing about this movie is its music. It does a great job of setting the wondrous tone of the world and the narrative. To the Fairies They Draw Near by Loreena McKennitt has that sound that invokes child-like awe and a beautiful melody of fantasy.

Another thing this film does quite well is world-building. The source material, both the Disney film and the original J.M. Barrie tale, provide little background on the world of fairies, but this film expands the fairy lore with a complete world. Although, the downside is that although its established that Pixie Hollow is connected with Never Land, it never clarified where it is exactly. But the fairies have distinct jobs connected with nature (many of which funnily resemble the Bending arts of Avatar lore), and worlds within their own environ.

The characters are enjoyable. However, this Tinker Bell is NOT the Tinker Bell of Peter Pan, at least, not yet. Her character works for this franchise quite well, but it is not in harmony with the source material. This Tinker Bell is kind, if not impatient, helpful, understanding, sweet, and friendly. Her negative traits, like her vanity and jealously, oddly enough, seem to have passed onto another character named Vidia, voiced by Pamela Adlon. Speaking of which, the voice acting in this film is well-cast and well-performed. Mae Whitman gives a kindness but still strong voice to Tink. Kristin Chenoweth, Raven-Symon, Lucy Liu, and America Ferrera all do well as Tinks fairy friends Rosetta, Iridessa, Silvermist, and Fawn, who each represent the different job classes of the fairies. Even Jesse McCartney shows he has acting range as Terrance. Anjelica Huston has regal presence as Clarion, the Fairy Queen, and voice acting veterans Rob Paulsen and Jeff Bennett are tolerable if not grating as fellow Tinker fairies Clank and Bobble.

The plot is a tad on the predictable side, but it works for children. As usual with Disney DVDs, the DVD extras are great, expanding the world and are colorful and interactive. Selena Gomezs music video is visually uninspiring, but thats a DVD music video for you.

Overall, this was a good start to open this franchise with. It established the tone, world, and characters well, and left open the possibility to expand the world further with more characters and seasons. For an opening effort, a strong start. B+",1402790400,,2884,5.012526096033403

Disney put out an absolute ton of terrible sequels during the 2000's that I do my very best to avoid - with four kids that love Disney it is not entirely possible, but we try.  I am very pleased to say that I was happily surprised with Tinker Bell.  All of the Tinker Bell/Pixie Hollow movies are great.  They each have a quality story that aims to be fun and to teach a lesson.  But most importantly they seem to be an answer to the proliferation of pointless princess movies that tell girls to be pretty above all else.",1399507200,,597,4.294642857142857

3009133,5,B000XUOIQY,"I'm 23 years old, and saw an ad for this movie on television. With an avid interest in art, I was impressed with the animation and wanted to watch, even if it was a kid's movie. It took me a long time, but I finally caved and rented this through Amazon Prime.

Can I just start by pointing out that ""Family Movies"" are rarely actually family movies anymore? Okay, older Disney movies have enough adult jokes in them that sometimes it's uncomfortable to watch with a little kid, especially the highly observant, very smart ones that catch on despite the subtlety! ""Family Movies"" these days are often so ""dumbed down"" that as much as a kid might like it, the adults watching the movie WITH them can be put to sleep (or feel really embarrassed that they're watching at all...). As ""dumbed down"" kid's movies are these days, the adult stuff has also gotten a whole lot more violent and graphic in every way. I used to be able to watch it, distance myself from it, but not anymore. I guess I've just been over saturated with it, especially since the exact same stuff is in the news. I watch movies to escape reality, not be forced to empathize with characters who suffer for an hour and a half.

That said, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and was hugely impressed with the complexity of what I thought would be a simple tale with fancy graphics. The animation quality is top notch. The music is as moving as the score you might hear in the theater. And the story itself, while somewhat predictable, is nonetheless interesting. Character progression is great, and I love all the detail that's gone into these movies (yes, I watched more than one!). Not just literally, either, like the texture of the leaves that make Tink's dress, or the delicate pattern of each fairy's wings, but in the expressions and body language of each character, the care with which even background characters are rendered. You can look anywhere on the screen and fairies are doing their own thing. Many family movies these days lose the immersion effect because they cater TOO much to children. They go for a cheap laugh and a cliche moral tale. Well, this is just a friendly, light hearted story. It's not for KIDS, though that might be their intent, it's for ANYone interested in a good, clean, no stress, cheerful story.

ONE thing I didn't like: A couple times, throughout the series of Tinkerbell movies, some cliche jokes fell short. Particularly the scenes that were supposed to highlight Bobble and Clank's antics. These two guys are cute, I like them, but going for the time tested ""Oh, haha, he's doing something dumb!"" jokes isn't very enjoyable. That said, it was only a couple times, and the rest of the 90% of it was material presented in a fresh way. The writing is quick and snappy, and several times I was caught off guard with the humor and the delivery. The conversation between characters is realistic, and that's hugely appreciated.

Major Kudos to this feature: The female cast. It's not thrust into your face that this is a ""movie for girls."" I expect boys can like it too. It doesn't matter that a character is female, their personalities are relateable and interesting. There isn't any ""female power!!!!"" spirit (I enjoy those movies too, but sometimes they go over the top a little bit...). The writers and animators of Tinker Bell just let the characters BE. The characters lead by example and women are shown as heroines, background support, artists, daring doers, gardeners, leaders, all of that. The main female character is an engineer, for goodness sake, and valued not for her ability to 'fantastic' things, but for doing very real creative and mechanical work. We don't have men eyeing them up, or catcalling, or any of that. Speaking of which, the male characters are treated with equal respect, though they aren't the mains, and portrayed with a variety of personalities. These personalities might be called cliche by some, but they're the cliche personalities that don't get as much love as the Arnold Schwarzenegger types. (Woah, Schwarzenegger is programmed into spellcheck!) The real life friction between genders is non-existent, in other words, and I really like that. I think it sets a great example for a younger generation. I suppose the other side of this sword is that most of the female characters are practically cut and paste in body type and weight, the exception being Miss Fairy Mary. As a woman on the heavier end of the scale, though, I can say I wasn't bothered. Then again, I'm 23 and don't have issues with my bodily image because of a cartoon!

Someday I'll have kids, and believe me, Disney can expect a little pocket change from my purchases of these movies. I think Disney's ""new classics"" can really learn a lot from the crew, writers, and directors behind these Tinkerbell movies. I really hope there are many more to come!",1377561600,,4860,4.733175914994097

3009146,4,B000XUOIQY,"Perhaps I'm a bit picky, but the sarcasm and teenaged behavior of the new fairies is a bit beyond the social scope of a toddler or early preschooler.  They generally don't get sarcasm.  And the snippy quality is something they are learning from the video rather than a genuine behavior of a toddler.  Only because my daughter is 3 and will face children who have seen these kinds of movies and model the behaviors (also possible from modeling actual teenagers), I figured it was okay.

Aside from the slightly odd teenager qualities of the fairies, it's a Tinker Bell movie filled with fairies!  It's fun. And I like that Tinker Bell is so feminine and an engineer too.  And my daughter likes it a lot.  Not obsessed.  But she likes it.  And she'd want to see more Tinker Bell movies, I think.",1373673600,,793,4.528169014084507

3009182,4,B000XUOIQY,"There's a point in which Bell encourages the mouse she's straddled on to set-off on capturing the feared sprinting thistles, though he's afraid. It doesn't take long. All she has to do is breathe a few whispery words of encouragement into his ear and he can't resist. I bet that's because she's so pretty, as are most of her lady peers.

They're co-workers from Never Land's Pixie Hollow, divided only by their job titles and the perks those jobs provide. Bell is a tinker fairy, hence the Tinker Bell name, and it is her job to make and fix things. It's when she finds out, much to her dismay, that tinkers don't get to go to The Mainland that the story's plot starts to unfold.

Some of the music is too contemporary for such a mythical concept. The beginning and ending song vocals are particularly questionable. But it's a cute movie and the 3D animation is absoultely adorable. It's Tinker Bell though, specifially her Disney-perfect face and the life-like emotional expressions it conjures, that's most magical.

I'm a major 3D animation fan and have high standards and did not expect much with this direct to DVD show. I was pleasantly surprised. I believe some of the Pixar team has been involved in each of these movies. The animation is movie quality and the story even kept me (dad) engaged. Along with the rich animation I enjoyed the innocence story and clean character development.

A fantastic awesome  purple huge grand tree with perfect shiny goldish powder on the flat ground where you could be pretty and smell good. When you turn the TV on you'll see wonderful fairys lined up perfectly just waiting for you to watch their show! It's hilarious and it's full of humor you'll think it's stupendous and you won't be sad any more. You won't be bored you will be happy you will be joyful after you've done watching. If it was me I would give it five stars now how about you? I believe that this is the best movie you could ever watch. If you liked fairys you'll love Tinker bell because most kids who liked fairys also loved Tinker Bell. So rais up your money and be ready to see the best movie ever.

3009233,5,B000XUOIQY,"I wouldn't call this film a feminist classic, and it is certainly one more racist movie in the great Disney tradition, but it does attempt in its own endearing way to teach little girls about solidarity and sisterhood. The filmmaker tries so hard to be politically correct that his film practically passes out from the effort, but he also emphasizes the fact that, in spite of all her troubles, Tinker Bell is still a hottie. One word of advice: as soon as your daughter sees this movie, she will probably want to be Tinker Bell for Halloween. In fact, your little boy might, too.",1348185600,,580,4.586538461538462

It was shipped quickly, even without prime and I'm quite happy because she is happy. Would I recommend this? As a Christian... no.

3009253,5,B000XUOIQY,Tinker Bell is a 2010 Disney animated movie that deals with the lives and the magic of small fairies. TinkerBell being the main star of the movie is out on an adventure and ends up being captured by a human girl. After this the adventure truly begins. The CGI animation is amazing and the music is very good also. A movie that small girls and people that like animated Disney movies will love. I really enjoyed it. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.,1325462400,,446,4.518518518518518
3009254,5,B000XUOIQY,"I caught this movie on my Tivo in Nov. 2011 and my 2yr old daughter loves watching it so much that I got her the Bluray/DVD combo for Xmas.  Compared to all the other movies that she likes to watch the Tinker Bell movies are much more enjoyable for parents to watch along with her.  It doesn't have any hidden jokes for adults like some other movies but it's also not so overly cutesy and annoying as other kid movies either.  Also if you're paying attention the later installments of the Disney Fairy series you'll see things carried forward from previous movies.

As a dad with a science and engineering background I appreciate the fact that Tinker Bell is a Tinker Fairy which means she builds and fixes stuff.  She's not a Disney Princess that is simply looking for a rich prince to marry.  That makes her a pretty good role model for a little girl (other than the fact that she's a fairy and not a human).  Also Tink isn't a perfect character.  By that I mean she makes mistakes and learns from them rather than doing everything perfectly all the time.  Her tinkering doesn't always go as planned and she tends to get mad when things go awry which only make things worse.  Eventually she learns to control her temper and fix her mistakes which is a good lesson for kids.  She also has to learn to ask for help from time to time which is another valuable lesson.

The Bluray and DVD are great as expected and the animation is top notch as you'd expect from Disney CG.  I use the Bluray in my PS3 on my big screen TV and the DVD in our portable player in the car when needed.

p.s. I'll be posting this on all of the Tinker Bell movies we've purchased since we like them all equally.",1325376000,,1686,4.311111111111111
3009255,5,B000XUOIQY,My daughter loves this movie so we bought a copy for her best friend! Now these 3 year olds can watch it either one of their homes.,1325030400,,131,3.888888888888889
3009256,5,B000XUOIQY,"My husband purchased this for me and I love it. I know I'm almost 30 and still watching these movies (with no kids mind you) but they just make me happy so who cares! lol.  This movie is so cute and heart-warming. It's about the beginning of Tinker bell, which is a cool concept. The animation is pretty good, although I did notice it is no where near as slick as regular disney movies. That being said, it is still a wonderful movie, and looks and sounds great too. The kids will love it. I'm sure if your kids had it on in the background, you wouldn't be getting much work done because it's so fun to watch you just can't help it. On the other hand, my husband watched it with me and was a little squirmy and antsy and kept getting up and walking around, so it's probably just for us girls. However, I did ask him if he liked it, and he said, ""It's okay. It's not really my thing, but I can see why you like it."" (In a non-condescending way). Which I took to mean that it was WAY too girly for him. :) So, if you love disney movies, enjoy tinker bell at any age, and don't mind fairies singing, I would definitely recommend this movie! Also, if you are like me and watch kids movies or disney flicks when you're feeling low, it's a sure fire way to cheer you up! :)",1322784000,3,1267,4.088353413654619

3009262,4,B000XUOIQY,"My six-year-old daughter loves Tinker Bell and all things to do with fairies. This first story in Disney's Tinker Bell series of movies is simple yet delightful - Tinker Bell's origins are shown [and yes, she speaks here], and she finds that her talent is to be a tinker fairy. But, Tinker Bell[Mae Whitman] doesn't take to her talent with much enthusiasm - she feels her other fairy friends such as the water talent fairy Silver Mist [Lucy Liu], animal talent fairy Fawn [America Ferra], garden/flower talent fairy Rosetta [Kristin Chenoweth], and light talent Fairy Iridessa [Raven Symone] have 'real' talents and she is also upset that the tinker fairies aren't allowed to accompany the other fairies when they take Spring to the Mainland, i.e. London. Thus begins Tink's adventures in trying to adopt the other fairies' talents, until she eventually comes to the realization that being a tinker is what Tinker Bell does best.

The story itself has a good lesson underlying it, but what's truly wonderful about this production is the beautiful animation. Though it's CGI, the fairies don't exactly come across as wooden characters and the fairies seem truly 'alive'. Their facial expressions and voices make this one of the more appealing straight-to-DVD Disney releases. It also holds up to repeated viewings. My daughter first watched this when she was 3.5 and she still requests it!",1312156800,,1388,5.06113537117904
3009263,5,B000XUOIQY,"As a princess-fearing mom of a 3 year old girl, I was a bit hesitant to jump on the TinkerBell bandwagon. But, after seeing TinkerBell with my daughter, I have to say, I enjoy TinkerBell.
- The score is amazing, lovely little Celtic-inspired melodies
- The color saturation and artistry of the fairies and plants is amazing. I was very impressed.

Now for the actual plot:
TinkerBell is plopped into Pixie Hollow and discovers she is a tinker fairy. She's not exactly thrilled by this, since she won't be able to go to the mainland to deliver spring to the world. She attempts to be a nature fairy by trying other talents (failing miserably, but she's persistent). In the end, she embraces who she is as a tinker fairy, repairs the damage she has done, and lives happily ever after.

Character traits I've discussed with my daughter:
Interdependence (helping each other out), being yourself (Tink is much happier when she embraces her true talent), fixing your mistakes (Tink wants to run away after she causes a huge mess, but comes back to fix everything and holds herself accountable).

I like that TinkerBell is a character I can embrace. Yes, she does occasionally act like she's 4, but look at the target audience. Children can relate to Tink and since she does come back to fix things, parents can use TinkerBell as a springboard to discussing behavior. Unlike the princesses, where the overall theme is to be pretty to get a boy (Little Mermaid even gives up her voice for a man!) TinkerBell is a creator and a rebuilder and isn't focused on getting a boy. That is something I want my daughter to see, rather than the princesses.",1308182400,,1637,4.677083333333333
3009264,5,B000XUOIQY,My 5 year old loves this movie - no scary parts and just a good story.  We also bought it for my 3 year old niece who loved it as well!,1305072000,,135,3.3548387096774195
3009265,5,B000XUOIQY,"I love Disney films, their always put together so well but I love the new addition of the Disney Fairies. Tinkerbell deserved her own films, she is such a popular and loveable character so it only made sense to create a film with a storyline that surrounded tinkerbell. I am a 23 yr old woman and I love animation films and disney films. I came across this movie one night when I was bored and I wasn't aware Disney created a few movies that were about tinkerbell and her friends, so i popped the movie in and It kept my attention the whole time, the animation was wonderful, and the storyline was very cute, also all the characters were well thought out and tinkerbell looked better than ever. I loved everthing about this movie. It is now one of my favorites in my movie collection. I think this is a fun film for all ages, my husband even enjoyed the film and I have watched this quite a few times since I purchased it. Any child would enjoy this film, this is a feel-good film and you will find your self laughing & loving the beautiful animation and who couldn't enjoy such a cute story. Dont past this film up, its a must watch on my list and im sure a favorite of many others.",1304294400,,1183,4.262222222222222
3009266,1,B000XUOIQY,Two thumbs down.  This movie is too simplistic and dumbed down.  The animation is cold.  They could have done a lot better.,1297555200,,123,4.5
3009267,1,B000XUOIQY,"I'm surprised that no other parents picked up on the bad message this movie has! The Tinkerbell in this movie is whiny, throws temper tantrums whenever she does not get her way, and is horribly insulting to her fellow ""Tinker"" fairies. The trailers claim this is a movie about being proud of who you are, and I guess that in the end, Tink learns that lesson, but not before she acts like a spoiled brat, insists on getting her way, and in doing so, ruins months of work and even puts other fairs in danger during the stampede of the run-away thistles that SHE caused.

What's worse is that after ruining months of hard work and preparation and endangering everyone else, she is let off the hook completely when she fixes her mess. While fixing her mess is a good thing, another fairy gets punished for her part in the stampede, and Tink is NEVER held accountable for her actions!

The message? If you are whiny enough, throw enough temper tantrums, and insult others, not only will you get your way in the end, you will not be held accountable for any bad behavior on your part. I'm just not sure that Walt would have EVER approved of this spoiled, whiny version of Tinkerbell, or the messages in the movie. Granted at the end, Tink finally learns to be herself, but it's all her other bad behavior that goes unpunished that ruined this movie - at least for this parent. I can guarantee that if my daughter ever behaved that way, she certainly would not be rewarded for it, and she would serve some serious time grounded in her room! If you do watch this movie,I think it will warrant some discussion with your kiddos.",1297296000,15,1618,4.48135593220339
3009268,3,B000XUOIQY,"Well before you snicker at the mental image of a grown man sitting down for an evening of Tinker Bell, consider this: With a budget of 48-mil, distribution by Disney and Executive Producer credit going to none other than Pixar's big cheese John Lasseter, it's only natural that my tour of the computer generated feature film make a stop at Pixie Hollow.  And in this case that stop includes a trilogy of entries no less (two more reviews of said property to follow).

That said, Tinker Bell is a 2008 direct-to-dvd (in the USA) CGI feature film based on the famous Peter Pan supporting character/ company icon that earns a G-rating and 78-minute runtime.  For better or worse, the film takes multiple liberties with the source material that seem to have fallen on the side of criticism by many long-time Peter Pan aficionados.  Not the least of these is the fact that Tinker Bell is able to speak in this iteration, which completely replaces the sound of a jingling bell that accompanied her onscreen presence in the 2D films.  Sorry fans, Peter Pan, Captain Hook, and the Lost Boys are nowhere to be found in this piece as well.  Viewers are, however, treated to such pixie-lore elements as the birth of a fairy and how Tink ends up in her trademark jagged-green threads, er leaf fibers as the case may be.

Aside from representing Tink's back story, Tinker Bell is based on the simple premise that the title character ready, willing, able and eager to help in the important fairy tasks such as changing of the seasons, and sets her sites on traveling to the mainland (where we lowly humans dwell). However, she soon learns that her lot in life is that of a tinker fairy meaning that her job is to assemble and repair the various items in Pixie Hollow that the ""important"" fairies require to do their magical jobs.

Tinker Bell, naturally, wants no part of being a glorified mechanic and tries (with some humorous results) to attempt the jobs of some of the other fairies before discovering it best to be yourself.  There's a moral here that will likely resonate with the kids even if the pretty visuals or bubbly personalities of the characters don't immediately win them over.

Speaking of, the CGI animation is of decidedly high caliber as it should be, given the assimilation of Pixar into the Disney fold.  Rich textures, crisp colors and well animated character models all add up to a solid visual presentation.  A Celtic-inspired score by Joel McNeely and a pretty solid voice cast complete the grade-A feel.

Now it's only fair to nitpick a bit as well as there are a few rough spots that deserve examination.  For example, Tinker Bell's very name is derived from the fact that her birthing ceremony identifies her as a tinker fairy and hence her name is actually Bell.  So then is it safe to assume all of the fairies are given names based on their occupation? Actually, no.  For whatever reason Bell's fellow tinkers do not seem to have the word anywhere in their names.

Then there is the matter of the second half of her name.  The little fairy in Pan jingled like; you guessed it, a bell! Unfortunately that element is completely removed here as well.

Additionally, the fairy of the classic tale (and not just in Disney's incarnations) has received a major personality retooling.  Forget the jealous, spiteful, mischievous but unwaveringly loyal sidekick you likely know and sort of love, here Tink is a modern lady with fashionable sensibilities and charm to match.

The pacing is a bit deliberate and drawn out, not unlike the classic animated pieces of Disney lore.  In other words, it feels a bit more like a modernly styled classic 2D animation film than it does a scaled down Pixar blockbuster.

In all, younger viewers, whom surely Disney intends this work, will likely enjoy this tale.  Adults will find a few moments to enjoy while appreciating the solid moral efforts interlaced with the tight visuals.  This series is certainly in a league above computer generated animated primarily-girl series like Barbie or Strawberry Shortcake but falls a tad bit short compared to the excellence that's been given in the past by the Pixar/Disney juggernaut.",1297296000,,4172,4.777158774373259

I just loved the end part where they made the trees bloom with flowers and just loved all the beauty of it all. ('u~) Spring is my favorite season cuz the beautiful trees regrow their foliage, many flowers begin their blooms, and the many animals of nature awaken from their winter slumber and begin frolicking out and about.

3009280,5,B000XUOIQY,"At last, TinkerBell, the little pixie fairy created by J.M. Barrie and re-introduced to the world as a sexy beauty and corporate icon in the 1950's by Walt Disney in his animated classic, ""Peter Pan"", has been given her own film series, kicked off in 2008 by the aptly titled ""TinkerBell"". This first film was actually just the next step in an already successful ""Disney Fairies"" franchise that began with the hit book, ""Fairy Dust and the Quest for the Egg"", and was followed by 2 more hardcovers (the third book was just released, though it`s the 4th if you count ""In the Realm of the Never Fairies: The Secret World of Pixie Hollow"", which is like the big guidebook) and several paperbacks, along with other merchandise and a new series of graphic novels I've been keeping up with myself (as I particularly like graphic novels, though I also own the Quest for the Egg and Realm of the Never Fairies, and intend to get the other two hardcovers in time). And, something worth noting before even discussing the film is that there is a big change fans of the books must be prepared for. Though there are many similarities, including some consistent characters, Tink's core group of friends in the film are different characters from those in all the books. I can't expand too much on this factor, as I haven't had time to read any of the books yet, aside from the first graphic novel I have also written a review for.

Now, ""TinkerBell"" the film tells the tale of, well, TinkerBell, of course. It's basically an origin story that begins with her birth from the laugh of a baby, as all fairies are born, fully grown and with a complete grasp of the English language. Yes, we finally get to hear Tink speak, and while I may have had an issue with this when I first heard about it, I got over it long before the film came out and she sounds fine voiced by Mae Whitman, so no problems there. Upon coming into the world (and here we get to see her in a white ""dress"" with her hair down, looking like a goddess if I do say so myself, but I have a serious thing for Tink), a ceremony is immediately held for Tink to discover her fairy talent. This is done magically, and cannot be chosen by the individual. It is discovered that Tink is a Tinker (hence the name), a maker and fixer of things for the other fairies to use. Tink is okay with this at first, though a little disappointed, as it is clearly not as glamorous as being a type of nature fairy. However, when Tink discovers that being a Tinker means you don't get to make the big trip to the mainland to help usher in Springtime, she is very upset and sets out to learn a different talent. Tink has a great curiosity of the mainland, as she has found objects that came from there and is the only fairy with the talent to figure them out. The film focuses both on Tink's struggle to fit in and find herself and also on her attempts to work herself into the mainland excursion. Of course, in classic Disney fashion, a happy ending is had by all.

""TinkerBell"" turns out to be one of the best things ever to come directly to Disney home video, if not THE best. In fact, I could easily imagine this having a big screen release, so it's really too bad they didn't go that route. It was definitely more deserving than ""Jungle Book 2"" (and that's coming from a huge Jungle Book fan who would have loved a properly done sequel), and even more deserving than the fairly good but still very flawed ""Return to Neverland"". It's just a great little movie with surprisingly good visuals for direct to video. Heck, for direct to video, they're SHOCKINGLY good visuals, and TinkerBell herself is thankfully very true to her original design for the most part, though personality-wise, she seems far more even tempered here than she is in Disney's ""Peter Pan"", through most of which she was furiously jealous and even murderous at times. It IS a bit hard to imagine this newest incarnation of Tink, sassy as she sometimes is, trying to get Wendy killed repeatedly in a few year's time, but maybe in the coming films we'll see her character evolve in that direction. Ha, but it's very unlikely. Regardless, I really enjoyed this film and seeing a sweeter, more innocent and vulnerable, and yet believably Tink-ish Tink throughout it, and I greatly appreciated the character designs (I'm mainly a face guy, but what legs these fairies have!), even though Tink's star-voiced core group of friends could have used more character development. I also really appreciate the time, interest, and attention to detail in making this a quality film; it definitely shows. It really did turn out well and I can't wait to finally get the time to view my copy of its first sequel, ""TinkerBell and the Lost Treasure"". Incidentally, I even picked up a tree topper from the Disney Store of Tink in her birthday suit from the film (that sparkly white dress with her hair down and bare feet). It was too gorgeous to resist and will sit atop my Christmas tree every year from now on.

As for the Blu-Ray edition of ""TinkerBell"", of course it looks and sounds fantastic, but it has some nice extras as well. Sadly, no commentary, and annoyingly, none of the little promo shorts that ran on the Disney Channel of Tink and her friends performing daily chores, but it does include deleted scenes with optional filmmaker intros, a pretty fun Tinker Trainer game that can even be a bit tricky for younger players I'd think, a short live action film with the CGI fairies mixed in called ""Ever Wonder"", a TinkerBell and Queen Clarion hosted Guide to Pixie Hollow, a ""Creating Pixie Hollow"" behind the scenes feature on designing the fairies' world (that, yes, is located on Neverland, in case you were wondering), and of course, your standard Disney Channel Star music video. This time, the video features Selena Gomez singing a song from the film called ""Fly to Your Heart"".  Now, I generally adore Selena Gomez, so the music video is a happy inclusion this time, but I confess I don't love it. I normally like her singing, but there's something about the way Selena sings a line or two in this song I just don't like, and she sounds a bit too much like Demi Lovato here, whom I really don't care for. The way they have her floating about (painfully obvious wire work) here is something else I don't love about the video. Oh well, I still appreciate all the extras; a much better and better quality collection than many Disney releases get. So, overall, I gotta say, GET THIS MOVIE! Especially if you love Tink... or are IN LOVE with Tink, like me. But don't think that swayed me all THAT much. It really is very good!",1279065600,,6619,4.522537562604341

Since then, it's hard to believe it took THIS LONG for Disney to develop a strong, admirable female lead for their animation franchise.

3009297,4,B000XUOIQY,"Where as most Disney's direct-to-video followups to their feature films are rarely treated with any real care, this prequal to the original Peter Pan animated movie was actually pretty good. Tinker Bell was first put together mainly as a vehicle for the Disney Fairies product line which includes Tink and several other original fairy characters. This was mostly a response to several other shows that were out at the time like Winx Club and W.I.T.C.H. which featured teenage girls who transformed into fairies(which on their own were semi-ripoffs of Sailor Moon). It's a step up from the other Disney movie prequals/midquals/sequals to as it was the first one to be done in digital 3D.

This is essentially Tink's origin story. She is ""born"" from the laugh of a baby and first appears in the fairy home of Pixie Hollow which is part of Neverland. She is greeted by the other fairies, and learns that every one of them has a specific talent that is categorized into different types(water, animal, light, etc.). Tinker Bell is classified as a tinker fairy whose job it is to create and fix tools for the other fairies. At first she doesn't seem to mind it, but after meeting the spiteful garden fairy Vidia, she is told that tinkers aren't allowed to go to the mainland as only the nature fairies are sent to prepare the rest of the world for each season. Determined to prove that she's more than just a tinker, she tries to learn the nature magic skills from some of the other fairies. She fortunately has gained many quick friends, each one with their own type of power, but unfortunately its a power each one is born with and can't be learned. While begging Vidia for trying to learn her skill, she cons Tink into collecting runaway thistles, which end up wrecking most of Pixie Hollow and the fairies' plans for the changing of winter to spring. Mulling over the mistakes she's made, Tink uses her tinker skills to quickly craft some tools that will help repair all the damage she caused, which also increases the production of the fairies' season changing. Tink is then allowed to go to London with the rest of the fairies acting as a finder of lost treasures for humans, where she delivers a music box she fixed to a certain young girl(that she tries to have killed at least twice later on!).

I have to say I was pleasantly suprised by this when I caught on in TV. The story was good, and even though it was intended for younger girls, it wasn't done with a bunch of fairies singing ridiculous songs every five minutes, and going on about chocolate and boys. It also isn't some sappy romance where Tink is trying to find her token ""Prince Charming"" like other Disney heroines, although she does develop a small friendship with one of the boy fairies that's covered more in the sequal, Tinker Bell And The Lost Treasure. The only problem I felt was I don't see where Tink goes from being only slightly agitated from time-to-time, to being the full blown vidictively jealous boy-stalker that we see in Peter Pan. No mention of Pan or Capt. Hook is mentioned in this, but there are at least three more sequals being planned, all of which supposedly take place before Peter Pan. The computer animation in this is also exceptional, considering its not done by Pixar. The vocal cast is pretty impessive too with Anjelica Houston, Raven-Simone, America Ferrera, and Lucy Liu doing most of the fairy regulars, and Mae Whitman is suprisingly good as Tink considering this is the first time she ever talks in a movie. Your daughters or nieces should enjoy this as a nice gift, and worth watching on your own if you're a regular Disneyphile.",1262476800,,3636,4.661993769470405
3009298,5,B000XUOIQY,"This movie was a great hit in our family. My 5-year-old daughter was especially absorbed by it. Even my 12-year-old daughter liked it. It was on while I was fixing dinner, etc. but I couldn't keep my eyes off it myself. The graphics were so outstanding. Sure, the story line is more fit for kids but the movie was appealing for adults as well. It has some great lessons imbedded in it: like who you are, find your own talents, be a group player, and so on. I highly recommend it.",1262044800,,479,4.274725274725275
3009299,5,B000XUOIQY,"My 2 year old girl loves Tinkerbell.  After being scared to death by ""Peter Pan"" at first, she really took a liking to Tinkerbell later on.  So, we thought she would enjoy this movie.  She really did, and to my surprise, my wife and I did as well.  The story and execution are on a level that will keep adults engaged, as in all the best Disney outings.  Technically, ""Tinkerbell"" is a very well done movie, with smooth animation and creative artwork, and top-notch voice talent.  Kristin Chenoweth is always good, and ""Tinkerbell"" is no exception.  The story is also a great one for little girls, with the theme that you should follow your special talent and do what you like and are good at, no matter what other people might think.  And, as an engineer myself, I like the fact that ""Tinkerbell"" informs us that Tinkerbell is an engineer, and she's good at it.  Not every girl will grow up to be an engineer or scientist, but it's good to make sure they know that it's OK to do that if they want.  Tinkerbell is a good sci/tech role model for little girls, as she singlehandedly uses her advanced engineering skills to save the day.  And that is a sentence I never thought I would ever write!

They love to organize:)  This teapot has an adorable sparkly lid and each piece has great detail that differentiate this tea set from the other disney tea sets I've seen.

I love the research and fairy lore as well as the fact that Tinkerbell is smart, stubborn, sweet and sassy. It's also very cool that her friends are of different ethnicities as well as ""talents."" The message of the film is beautiful and very modern, encouraging young girls to follow their heart and showing them that they can be pretty, smart and useful. The world they live in is a matriarchy with Queen Clarion as their ruler. I love that Disney has made a very moving and empowering feature for young girls that is so feminine yet encourages them to be more than just princesses to be saved by dashing princes. Excellent film. I wish there were a thousand more of these. It is also nice that the film has drama without being dark like many of the other Disney movies so young kids can enjoy this without getting scared. It's by far my favorite Disney film as well. I'd give it 10 stars if that were possible.",1248998400,,1029,4.421052631578948
3009341,5,B000XUOIQY,"Yes, in this movie Tinkerbell is little like her original 1950s personality.  But, the modification was kind of necessary in order to make a movie with her being the central character rather than a spunky sidekick.  Of course they are going to update Tink to a kinder version, as parents typically prefer their kids look up to characters with positive attributes, rather than brats who are jealous, spiteful, and act viciously.  (In Peter Pan, Tink tries to kill Wendy).

So, if you can get passed the changes to Tink's character, you can see this is really an excellent movie.  Here's why.  The fairies at Pixie Hollow are all about being who they are, embracing their special talents and helping others.  The female characters don't aspire to be beautiful and ultra-cool, they aspire to work together to create spring and be the best they can be at their talents (even the ""villain"" fairy).  My 4-year-old has gotten this message!  This movie introduced her to the concept of finding your talent and has decided that art is hers.  After watching this movie, she goes into an artwork frenzy, expressing her talent through drawing, coloring, and/or painting.  Hey, that's awesome!  Loreena McKennitt's songs are wonderful too.  We end up singing along.  My two-year-old can belt out the ""Fly to Who You Are"" song.  Maybe that's her talent? ; )",1248480000,,1343,4.880530973451328

It's not scary (it's amazing how many movies for her age group are), it's nice to look at, the sound levels are normal, and she enjoys watching it over and over.  Although I've found that it holds the attention of kids of all ages, (and I like it myself) I would recommend it highly for anyone looking for a dvd for young preschoolers that may be frightened by some of the 'scarier' scenes in other animated movies.",1247184000,,592,4.212389380530974

If you were merely disappointed at the lack of artistry in today's ""physics-based"" 3d animation, it would be another. If stripping out the best of western lit's essential messages is somewhat troublesome, it would be another. But pitching the classics as teenage mall characters with sexy clothes that would never be permitted in a high school is a part of the sorry ruination of culture and morality that truly illustrates the central mission of this greedy corporation.

The only sad thing is how this film really does stray from...well, from Neverland.  From the place and boy (Peter Pan) that we all loved.  Or even dare I say, from the fairy we all loved.  The Tink in this film isn't really what Tink is like in Peter Pan.  She's much kinder here and less sassy.  So don't start this movie thinking that it is just a more in-depth look at Tinkerbell's life.  Be prepared to watch a film that has pretty much nothing to do with the original Tinkerbell or Neverland or Peter Pan.",1237248000,,1216,4.271929824561403
3009386,5,B000XUOIQY,Tinkerbell is a great movie. My daughter loves it. And it looks great on Bly-ray.,1236038400,,81,4.466666666666667
3009387,5,B000XUOIQY,"I will not get into the plot of ""Tinker Bell"" as other reviewers have touched on it. I just want to say that I am a nearly 58-year-old married man with no kids but I really, really enjoyed this DVD! I am a serious DVD collector with 2,000 DVDs. I have an animated section in my collection and ""Tinker Bell"" will now be one of the top picks in that section.
The color, the graphics are simply dazzling! I cannot even watch the old Disney classics anymore because they look so stone age compared to the animated DVDs that are being put out now. In fact I have traded all the old Disney DVD classics like ""Snow White"", ""Bambi"" because they look so ancient.
We watched ""Tinker Bell"" on our Sony 55-inch LCD TV last night and the colors are so rich and vibrant! I must mention that I also have a Sony upconvert DVD player as well that I use. It has made all the difference in the world. I do not have a Blu-Ray player yet because they are over-priced and they have their problems still.
But treat yourself by getting this DVD and be sure that you have an upconvert DVD player (they sell for about $75 or so at Wal-Mart). They play the regular DVDs at a higher quality level (not quite Blu-Ray) but it still looks nice! This is sure to be a true Disney Classic!",1235952000,,1255,4.211618257261411
3009388,5,B000XUOIQY,"I've seen this movie about... 25 times since we bought it. We still like to watch it, it helped lead my older daughter into the Fairies books, which helps to make sense of some of the stuff happening in the movie. Overall, I gladly give the movie 5 stars. Some purists may dislike it for not being Peter Pan Tink, but I think they were as faithful as they could be in preparing Tinkerbell for the 21st century. I look forward to the next 3 movies too, I'll be sure to watch them a lot too.",1235865600,,489,4.104166666666667

The rep said Tinkerbell as he pointed to the Blu-ray player under the set. I and everyone around me had their jaws on the floor with the ""oohs and aahs"".The colors and the detail is so amazing. A story for kids?. I'm a full grown man and i enjoyed it (yes i still watch cartoons, it keeps the mind young).You won't go wrong with this Blu-ray disk,just stunning. This disk will show you how good your set is. Can't wait for for the sequel.",1235692800,,584,4.043103448275862
3009390,5,B000XUOIQY,"I'm the mother of a four year old who is constantly looking for games to play on the DS.  This game is well designed, has great graphics, and a fun concept.  Part of the game is ""tinkering"" with objects to fix them - blowing dust off of things, repairing cracks, etc.  My daughter loves these activities.

The downside, however, is that the game involves a LOT of reading so for my younger child I have to sit and play with her.  (Not that I mind the togetherness!)  If, however, you are looking for a game for a non-reader to play by themselves, this isn't the one.",1235520000,,566,4.2924528301886795
3009391,5,B000XUOIQY,Little girls love princesses.  Stroll through any toy section of your local Target and you'll see I'm right.  This movie was made for this particular audience.  And it's cute with a nice message.  I really enjoyed the fact that Tinkerbelle's special talent had less to do with her appearance and more to do with her brain.  Now there's a message you don't see enough of today!  I'm happy we've got this one in our DVD collection.,1234915200,,429,4.578947368421052

Then i got it for my sister, the film has a very nice origin story, with some morals on the way. The animation somehow is much better than your regular straight to video Disney feature and you can feel the ""Lassetter"" touch here and there. I'm looking forward for the next chapters, and see how they will develop the story and the characters.",1234396800,,463,4.043478260869565

3009408,4,B000XUOIQY,"Tinker Bell is a great preschool age DVD!  The movie delivers the whole ""be proud of yourself"" message very nicely.  Visuals are excellent, music is appropriate.  The humor is gentle and fun.  The worst thing that happens is hurt feelings and some vandalism - nothing gross or scary.

Overall the plot is very light and fluffy, but that's great for my 2 year old.  Most Disney movies are far too complex for her.  Tinker Bell is right up her alley!",1233792000,,448,4.525
3009409,4,B000XUOIQY,"This animation is about how Tinkerbell gets her name and comes to terms with her life in a less than glamerous occupation. The magic of Tinkerbell, the charming fairy as we know her from Peter Pan, some how doesn't emerge in this sequal. This is a sweet animation and it pulls at your heart strings, but something is missing in making this a great Disney film. It's nice to have for the kiddies and worth seeing once. Looks awesome on Blue Ray. Younger audiences will enjoy the visuals.",1233705600,,486,4.534090909090909

The story kind of wanders a bit, but the moral is good - so I had no problem letting my kid watch it. But as far as anything for the adults to enjoy, you have to go into it knowing it's going to be a long hour and a half.

I think this is the beginning of a series - so I hope the rest are a little better in the story department.",1233360000,,476,3.6116504854368934

3009412,5,B000XUOIQY,"I thought this was a great movie for a younger child or even a slightly older child and especially for girls.  All the older type disney movies seem to play on the helpless pricnesses being dependent on a prince or some other male figure, or someone's parent has to die, or there needs to be some wicked scary evil individual.  There is no love story to this, no one has to die and no scary monster.  This a fun light hearted movie with a free thinking fairy who finds herself.  I assure both parents and kids will enjoy this incredible animation.  Buy it!",1233014400,2,556,4.359223300970874

I was chronically late for scout meetings because I had to see the opening scene from Disney's Wonderful World of Color which featured the Tinkster making magical fireworks.

In this movie, I was once again charmed by the character.

I finally sat down & watched it with her, and I have to say that 2nd to Cinderella this has to be the best Disney movie I've ever  seen for little girls.  Even for an adult, it was fun to watch and the message is wonderful -- be who you are.  There are no scary parts or inapproprite things like so many other movies supposedly for little kids (we have yet to make it through any other Disney kids movie besides Cinderella  because of a major scary element, such as the sea witch in LIttle Mermaid, Malificent in Sleeping Beauty, the witch in Snow White, the Beast in Beauty & the Beast).  I hope Disney makes other movies to follow up on this, drawing on the great Disney Fairy books (also big faves in our house, including the audio books which are fantastic).

3009443,4,B000XUOIQY,"I was lucky that I could see ""Tinker Bell"" in Japan, where it was theatrically releases in December, 2008. As many reviewers have rightly pointed out, the crisp images of the CGI-created animation is simply gorgeous and they are very beautiful even on the big screen. Executive-produced by John Lasseter, ""Tinker Bell"" is not a so-called ""cheapquel"" or a cheaply made sequel (with 2 or 3 in the title) Disney was once notorious for.

The story is mostly set in Pixie Hollow, where newly-born Tinker Bell (voice by Mae Whitman) learns a lesson through works, friendship and adventures. Not content with her role in the community as a ""tinker,"" she tries to prove that she can do what other fairies do. Most of the fairies are helpful--except one. But in spite of their kindly helps and Tinker Bell's best intentions, things always end up badly until she finally realizes her talent.

I admit the story is slim and predictable. You have delightful supporting characters and the film's stunning visuals greatly help enrich them, but you might feel that the story is too short for them to fully develop. Fortunately it is reported that ""Tinker Bell"" is the first installment of the series of four films. Hope that we will meet them again in the next project soon.",1231372800,,1259,4.797235023041475

They are fond of repetition in most things. They are comfortable and feel safe with things they come to know, such as foods, routines and watching familiar tv shows and movies.
This film works as a teaching tool as well and helps her learn social skills and correct behaviors in given situations. She's loved the Peter Pan movies since she was very small. This is like a continuation of those films to her.",1231286400,,566,4.504854368932039

The only thing I can think of, is that they felt it was too gender skewed to girls to put in the theater.  However, to me, it's easily good enough.  This isn't a direct to DVD knockoff prequel or sequel that tries to borrow on the charm of the original movie but doesn't deliver in terms of story quality, music, animation quality.  Instead, it's very cute and very well done both in terms of story & animation & soundtrack.  The message is about embracing the talents that you have... and that you may not have all the same talents as everyone else.  This is a message I think is great for kids -- a lot of times I think kids feel pressure that they have to be good at everything.

I know they are making more than one movie-but why? unless they plan on showing how she finds Peter as a baby and takes him to Neverland.

I was pleasantly surprised that this movie not only told the wonderful story about the origin of Tinker Bell, but it also taught a valuable lesson in being proud of who you are (because we sometimes wish we were like someone else).  The meaning of this would go over the heads of younger children, but it's perfect timing for my 4 year old who is more aware of the differences between herself and her friends.  This helps me reinforce that it's GOOD to be different!

So I get myself a `God child' -Baby L-who happens to be of the age where she'd enjoy this kind of movie and what the hell? Someone took the `bad girl' out of Tinkerbell! Who is this perfect little angel type thing because she sure ain't the nasty little Stinkerbell that collaborated against Wendy and caused a whole ton of trouble for Peter Pan in the original story. I used to love Tink, even considered having her in Ink but not this version, no way. What happened to the naughty, devious, mischievous, conniving sprite I knew and loved as a child. Glad we got this on PPV because I would NEVER (see all caps?) buy this for Baby L, no way. Don't mess with the classics, Disney, you don't have to sanitize everything and make it PC- there's room for the imperfect. I say God bless the flawed, no one is perfect.

It's too 21'st century teenage crap, should have stayed true to fairydom and not put the human teen twist into it. The illustration is nice and well done, but not to the true likeness of Tinker Bell.

There are some famous voice talents from people such as Anjelica Huston, Raven Simone, and Lucy Lu. I really enjoyed watching this with my daughter and ended buying copies for my nieces as well.
A note: Tinkerbell's attitude has been altered from her Peter Pan debut.  If I remember correctly she was kind of b**chy in that movie but in her own feature film she's much more lovable.

3009544,1,B000XUOIQY,"Physically, Tinkerbell looks like the fairy you knew and loved from Disney's Peter Pan.  Other than that, she does not resemble Tinkerbell one bit.  Tinkerbell was a sassy free spirit with attitude and was a loyal friend to her beloved Peter Pan.  A bit vain, selfish, but also mixed with a lot of good.  Though a Disney fairy, those characteristics made her almost human.

This movie takes her image and creates a whole new character for the sake of marketing.  They created new fairies for this movie, why not just make one of them the main character.  Why did they have to destroy the Tinkerbell we grew up with.

Yes, little girls, and even some little boys will love this movie because of the images.  Yet they would of loved it just the same if Disney had made a new fairy.  They have plenty of them, what's one more?  The smarter kids will ask, why is Tink nicer in this movie?  Why can she talk?  Why didn't she tinker in Peter Pan?  Maybe these answers will be answered in one of the future releases of this new series of DVDs.

and was not dissapointed at all with the rendering (tho as some have noted...sorta 'robotic'...but then the human form is the most difficult to animate believably....)

but most surprising of all is...i looooved this movie!

the voice work was spot-on. the story was very full in the neverland universe...tink is still a lovely creature to behold (better in '3d')

and most of all this movie MOVED me...i actually laughed out loud at some of the goings on...and was moved to tears towards the end...

if the next 'tink' movies in this series are as good as this i will be very happy!

not only more chances to see my lil tink rendered lovingly in glorious CG...but more chances to be moved by a lil film that i never saw comin....

Having a child makes you really rediscover and appreciate the wonder and magic of Disney and this movie is no exception. We watch it several times a week and I have yet to tire of it.  It is a wonderful message for little girls, as opposed to the shameless incessant marketing of the Disney Princesses (when did they take ownership of all fairytales?).  Tinkerbell is a working woman with big aspirations that are only realized when she is true to herself.  The movie has very few scary scenes - nothing near as frightening as Ursula from Little Mermaid, or Cruella De Ville, or the death of Mufasa in the Lion King, so okay for even the youngest preschoolers.

3009555,1,B000XUOIQY,"first off, this movie had the potential to be interesting and magical and exciting. the elements for what could have made this movie great were there somewhere, they just weren't touched upon. this turned out to be a movie about 'everyone's an individual, just like you' and near the end when i discovered that this was the only moral i felt really disappointed. it's just one of those movies that will leave no mark on you, washboard quality. if you've ever seen the sequel to snow white, the cartoon version, i forget what it's called because yes it was just that bad, it is reminiscent of that.

now this would all have been fine and dandy if it was just another movie to sucker people out of 30 bucks or however much it costs... but it is a story about tinkerbell... from peter pan. it almost seriously offended me that anyone would stray so far from a wonderful, classic story like that and steal one of it's signature characters and turn it into this. such a bastardization of arguably one of the most memorable characters in children's classical literature... some one should be slapped, really hard. it offended me enough to go out and write this review, which probably isn't even that articulate because my mind is still boggled by the fact that these greedy, money sucking... people at disney wouldn't just create some other nameless character, not drag a classic one through the dirt. .. of course i doubt anyone would buy that nameless character because of late their story writing ability is far from decent... as this little jem proves.",1228176000,8,1550,4.698529411764706

There are memorable moments as well:  Tink gently convincing a mouse that together they can accomplish a monumental task; the coming of Spring to London, courtesy of the fairies (some clever stuff here, and beautiful music as well); and my favorite, Tinker Bell trying to teach a baby bird to fly.

3009571,4,B000XUOIQY,"Wow! You won't recognize Tink's personality in this movie. She is selfless and tenacious; it is hard picturing her jealousy of Wendy in Peter Pan. However, on its own its a good movie - INCREDIBLY reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Bug-s-Life-Disney-Gold-Classic-Collection/dp/B00004R999/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Bug's Life (Disney Gold Classic Collection)</a>. In this story, Tinkerbell is an inventor dissatisfied with her current position in Pixie Hollow with a penchants for going to the mainland, and unfortunately for making a mess of things (in a Bug's Life it was food for the Grasshoppers, in TinkerBell it is preparations for Spring).

The computer-generated animation is really very well done. I was impressed at the originality of the well-known voice actors for the nature fairies who befriend Tinker Bell. Yes, fairies talk (I guess it is so quiet we just can't hear). The movie flowed nicely with some very clever moments. Most importantly, my 4 year old adored it.

The tie-in to Peter Pan comes at the end of the movie, as an afterthought. Tinker Bell makes it to the mainland to return a toy, which coincidentally belongs to Wendy. It could be explained as to how Peter later comes to Wendy's window (with Tink?), but I personally felt like it fell flat in terms of being consistent with Peter Pan.

My little one loved this movie and has enjoyed going onto Disney's new Pixie Hollow website and being a fairy herself. It is surprisingly good for a direct-to-DVD movie (consistency issues aside).",1227571200,,1575,5.420408163265306

Once she accepts what her real talent is and that it is important, she is joyful again and helps to save Spring.

I bought this movie for my two parrots (very spoiled birds) because it was about fairies with wings and the trailers looked cute. I also bought it because I never got over my love of well done animated movies. I can always tell when the birds are interested because they find perches closest to the TV and spend time sitting and watching without wandering off. The cute voices of Anjelica Huston (Queen Clarion), Lucy Liu (Silvermist), America Ferrera (Fawn), Kristin Chenoweth (Rosetta), Kathy Najimy (Minister of Summer)and Jane Horrocks helped hold their interest and the music sound track was very good. They spent a lot of time watching this one and I enjoyed watching it with them the first time. I'm sure it would also be attractive to children.",1227312000,,1138,4.747474747474747

Let me tell you the movie TOTALLY gets my approval.  It is a great fun movie that shows conflict resolution as well as quite a few other very important ""life lessons"".  I.E. Identity.  The makers of this movie crafted it so well that the ""scary"" parts are not scary and trust me when i say my daughter can get scared easily sometimes.  Not only was this movie great for my daughter, I really think children of ALL ages will gain different learning perspectives based on their learning curve.

3009590,5,B000XUOIQY,"I just watched the new TINKER BELL movie with my family, and I must say that we are all enormously enchanted.  Do you know how fairies are born?  (Do you remember from Peter Pan?) Do you know how and why our special friend is named Tinker Bell?  Do you know where Tinker Bell got her signature green dress?  All of these questions, and more, are very satisfyingly and entertainingly answered in Disney's new animated film, which, IMHO, is destined to become a classic.  This is by far one of the best films, animated or not, to come out of the Disney Studios in a long time.

In TINKER BELL, a new fairy is born and has to find her way in Neverland (although it is never called Neverland, it MUST be...the movie makes it clear that the fairies live ""second star to the right and straight on `til morning..."").  Along the way she makes new friends, many mistakes, and discovers who she is.  TINKER BELL has a clear and important message for all children, and adults, everywhere:  be happy with who you are; each one of us is special and unique, and that is a very wonderful thing.  TINKER BELL ignites the imagination, and leaves you full joy and happiness.

The animation is breathtakingly lovely. The colors are rich and brilliant, the action smooth and pure, and the characterizations are charming.  You can easily fall in love with every one of the characters.  The voice talent was cherry-picked from some of the best.  Mae Whitman, who voices Katara in the AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER series, is a perfect choice for Tink.  Sweet and ingenuous, she is conveys Tinker Bell exactly as you imagine.  The talents of Kristin Chenoweth, America Ferrera, Lucy Liu, Anjelica Huston, Kathy Najimy, Raven-Symone, and a host of others add to the delight of this film.  As an added bonus, there was nothing scary in TINKER BELL; nothing to frighten or upset children.  No one dies; no one is particularly evil.  A little self-centered, yes, but that is the worst of it.  This is quite simply a sweet, charming, enchanting tale that will please children of all ages for many years to come.

The ending made both my husband and me ""laugh-cry"" with delight.  (You know what I mean, the tears were flowing, but we were laughing with glee at the same time.)  At the end of the movie, Tinker Bell returns a very special object (that you just might recognize) that plays a very special song to a very special child.  It made me very happy, gooey, and sentimental, and that is a wondrous thing.  I am going to have this smile on my face for many days to come.  And my family and I will be watching this again, very soon - a sign of a truly excellent film.",1226793600,3,2639,4.514767932489452

I had no trouble getting my daughter to agree.  The animation is excellent and the ""be happy with who you are"" message is worth repeating over and over again.",1226707200,,325,4.278688524590164
3009595,5,B000XUOIQY,"My daughter received the new Tinkerbell DVD from her Grammy for her third birthday this weekend.  She was already a Tinkerbell fan, and I her rather grudging dealer of Tinkerbell paraphanalia.  I knew she'd love this movie, but I had my doubts; after all, the Tinkerbell I knew from Peter Pan was pretty headstrong, shallow, selfish, and even impulsively murderous.  (Not exactly my favorite role model for my little girl.)

However, this re-created Tinkerbell is much more appropriate-- to my delight!  It's definitely a movie for children (ie girls), not for the adults-- but there's nothing violently scary, and plenty to love about what they might absorb by watching:

You don't have to be the ""star"" to be vital and important.
Value does not lie in glamourous appearance or work.
There is happiness in being who you really are and not trying to imitate others.
There can be forgiveness from your authorities if you make a big mistake.
Helping others succeed is joyful and meaningful work.
Recycling and reusing is a virtue.
Always try to fix what you've screwed up.

...and probably more, but those are my favorites.  All in all, I'm delighted.  Hooray for the new Tinkerbell, who has a job other than flitting around trying to off Wendy and keep Peter all to herself.",1226448000,4,1273,4.856481481481482

I bought this movie for my friend's daughter and watched it and was just thrilled at the animation, the story (great lesson) and how sweet but not overly sweet it was.

3009597,4,B000XUOIQY,"This 78-minute production featuring the little pixie from Peter Pan tells the story of how TinkerBell came to be. See, in the land of Pixie Hollow, the community of fairies are divided up by their specialty. There are tinkerer fairies, water fairies, garden fairies and light-talent fairies. Some even control each of the seasons. When Tink arrives, she is thrust into a job she doesn't want. So, when she tries her hand at other jobs, the result is quite disastrous. In true Disney fashion, she has to embrace that destiny. She does but not without learning a lesson first. This Disney Fairies Franchise film stars: Mae Whitman, Raven Symone, America Ferrara, Lucy Liu, Kristin Chenowith, Anjelica Huston, Pamela Adlon, Kathy Najimy, Jesse McCartney, Jeff Bennett, and Loreena McKennitt. The film lays the groundwork for the next film in the series, ""Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure"" which is planned to come out in Fall of 2009 and two more features, ""Tinker Bell: A Midsummer Storm"" & ""Tinker Bell: A Winter Story""(Both coming out in the summers of 2010/2011).

I hate to admit it but I, too,  was dreading watching this movie. Until recently, Disney hasn't had much of a track record with direct-to-DVD releases. Some have been downright awful.  The only reason I bought this movie to begin with was the fact that John Lasseter was involved with the project. If any of you out there are into CGI films as much as I am, you'll know that John Lasseter was involved in the making of such films as ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"", ""Toy Story"", ""A Bug's Life"", ""Toy Story 2"", ""Monster's Inc."", ""The Incredibles"", ""Cars"" & ""Wall-E"". He's also involved with ""Toy Story 3"", and ""Cars 2"" which are coming in 2010 and 2012. I'm glad to say that, due to his involvement, ""TinkerBell"" is right up there with the aforementioned movies that are out. ""TinkerBell"" is a movie the whole family will love.

I didn't think I'd like it. I thought it'd be directed too much towards kids but it isn't. I loved it as much as my Grandson did.",1226275200,3,2019,4.743589743589744
3009598,5,B000XUOIQY,"I'm not particularly a fan of cartoon movies, but when Tinkerbell was released, I decided to sit down and watch it with my daughter and son. I'm so glad I did!

Tinkerbell is by far one of the best movies by Disney. Finally, Disney made a movie with a really important theme and message: Everyone is special and unique; there is nobody who can do what you do, like you do it. I walked away after watching Tinkerbell, feeling better about myself (and I'm 32 years old!). If I felt that way, then I know both my kids did as well.

This movie has a great message that every child can benefit from. I especially recommend every mother watch this with your daughter(s). Even my 5-year old son enjoyed it and watched it 3 more times the first day after we watched it together!

BRIEF SYNOPSIS OF MOVIE: Tinkerbell wants to be just like all the other dust fairies. She watches them bringing beautiful things to life and she wants to be just like them. But Tinkerbell is a tinker fairy, so when she attempts to bring spring things to life like all the others, she ends up creating mass chaos instead. Because of her wanting so badly to be like all the other fairies, she destroys all the hard work everyone else has been doing to bring spring to the Mainland.

Tinkerbell finally has an ""AHA!"" moment, when she understands that even though she isn't like all the others, her unique talent (fixer-upper) is exactly what is needed if the fairies can save spring. She quickly puts a plan into action, gathering all sorts of ""stuff"" and tinkers her way into creating tools all the fairies can use to save spring.",1226275200,8,1600,4.469178082191781
3009599,5,B000XUOIQY,"I was dreading watching this with my[...]... some of the Disney straight to video DVDs are downright awful. This was a pleasant surprise.  I loved the animation, the colors and, for all you princesses - all the sparkle.  This straight to DVD is nearly worthy of Cars and the Incredibles - my two favorite Pixar movies - high praise indeed.

The message was great, too - be proud of who you are.  Each fairy has a special talent.  Tinker Bell's is, well, to tinker, build and fix things, which she finds boring compared to the nature fairies who paint flowers, capture rainbows and make dew drops on spiderwebs. She tries to become a nature fairy and fails only to almost ruins Spring.  Using her given talent, she is able to save Spring with the help of friends.

I would recommend this for children up to age 5, girls of all ages and adults that love the Disney/Pixar magic.  This in now one of my favorites!",1226188800,3,909,4.466666666666667
3009600,3,B000XUOIQY,"This movie is enjoyable, truly every child can watch this without feeling fear or exposed to something too grown up. Suprising what they put in some ""kid"" movies. However, my family has been a huge fan of the Pixie Hollow books. We especially love the ones written by Gail Carson Levine (Quest for the Egg). I don't have those in front of me to double-check spelling. With a huge production of books on Tinkerbell.. I thought were a lead to the movie, I was disappointed. Disney produced (ie handstamped) the series as they did the movie. So I was suprised by the number of times it strayed in many key points with the book. For examples, Disney faries never say goodbye, they say ""fly with you"". The books made a big point about this.. so it jolted me out of my fantasy within the movie to hear the difference. I see they are re-inventing her and kudos for that, I believe Tink has much to offer. They created a strong, realistic female charactor..  I would have liked to seen her co-workers not so annoying as goofballs.

I enjoyed the music, Raven's voice is always a delight. The reading by Mae Whitman was done very well.

Overall there was a bit of a flat feeling with the movie, I look forward to what they do with the next ones they release. I bought it, I liked it but I advise my friends to borrow it from me and not waste their money. This isn't one you will watch 3 months from now, the ""new magic"" fades fast.",1226188800,5,1422,4.338345864661654

The first of 4 Tinker Bell stories to be released for the next 3 years. (Trailer for the 2009's adventure included in this DVD;""TINKER BELL and the LOST TREASURE"")

This Tinker Bell movie is only the beginning of the ""DISNEY FAIRIES"" phenomenon to include the virtual world of TINKER BELL (PIXIEHOLLOW.COM) including Toy Clickables (having a USB linkable feature to this virtual chat room and creating your own fairy in the world of PIXIE HOLLOW) Friendship bracelets, charms, dolls, books about the individual fairies  and lots more.

PIXAR's John Lasseter is this projects Executive Producer and it is obvious from the opening scenes that PIXAR QUALITY anination is present.  Even though this TINKER BELL movie is DVD released exclusively it has the FULL BIG SCREEN HD PRESENTATION.  PIXAR & WALT DISNEY ANIMATION STUDIOS spared no expense.  This is first quality CLASSIC Disney signature production.  Disney has even started a ""DISNEY TOON STUDIOS"" to showcase these grand movies plus the ""DISNEY FAIRIES and PIXIE HOLLOW"" web sites !!!!  So you see this phenomenon is here to stay!!!

Back to TINKER BELL the movie.  This is total eye candy and a fantastic story from Tinker Bell's beginning in Neverland at Pixie Hollow to her encounter with Wendy Darling in the MainLand. (Many of the questions about Tinker Bell, Pixie Dust, Fairies and Neverland are answered) The voice (a Tinker Bell first) is perfectly matched to her personally and the supporting character voice overs are first rate, to include Angelica Huston and Lucy Lui.  The Sound Track is absolutely perfect to the storyline.  (Disney has a Tinker Bell Sound Track CD also)

I have a Blu-ray HD Home Theater with a 108"" wall Screen and believe me this movie is a 5 STAR must have for your family Disney DVD Library.  You'll watch this movie many times.

Note: this story is primarily aimed at little girls from 5 to 12 but the story has family appeal and a great time in NEVERLAND.  Also there are male fairies called SPARROW MEN. Tinker Bell has 3 who help her, Bobble, Clank and Terence.

THE DVD FEATURES are alot of fun too!!!!  From TINKER TRAINING honing your tinker skills, a magical guide around Pixie Hollow, Ever Wonder?, this answers those questions, lots of background information about CREATING PIXIE HOLLOW and a music video performed by Selena Gomez, plus deleted scenes.

3009608,5,B000XUOIQY,"DVD Review: TINKER BELL
It would be very easy for traditional Disney fans to dismiss a direct-to-video, CG-animated feature in which the iconic Disney character talks. As a matter of fact, it's been dismissed months before the film came out in some circles. Come to think of it, there were probably many traditional champions of the original James Barrie Peter Pan play that had a problem with Walt Disney's vision of the fairy (I recall one snarky critic referring to her as being ""too long at the sugar bowls."" Reee-err!

Put that all aside, watch this Tinker Bell feature, and you may be pleasantly surprised. First of all, the art direction is so strong the entire feature really should have been released in theaters. This was not a hastily-made, get the money and run movie slapped together by hacks, it was clearly inspired by people who loved the source material. (And according to some reports, it was a long and bumpy road getting the little sprite to the direct to DVD screen, with scripts and careers scattered along the way.)

The story is simple. We see how fairies are born -- when a baby first giggles -- and how Tink finds herself in the fairy pecking order. We meet her cohorts and of course, she learns a lesson. The sweetest moment comes at the end, when she brings the music box... no I won't spoil it, but it was nicely handled. The Peter Pan story lingers in the background with subtlety rather than it being reduced to the sitcom levels we might have seen in decades past.

Mae Whitman is a marvelous choice for Tinker Bell's voice, your garden variety Disney lady, and the cast is also well suited to their roles. It's especially nice to have Angelica Huston bring stately grace to the Fairy Queen. My wife was especially delighted to hear Loreena McKennit as the narrator and singer at the opening. The score, by the way, has a light Irish folk lilt that won't quickly date in the years to come.

I can appreciate the challenge of bringing such a beloved character into a new ""franchise"" and admire how satisfying it turned out -- and the next one looks promising too -- my kids can't wait.

The DVD release is not brimming with extras, making me wonder if a ""special edition"" looms ahead, but there is one short feature well worth mentioning. I don't know if it was made for the DVD or perhaps created as a ""sizzle piece"" to create the mood for the Disney Fairies marketing initiative. No matter why it was made, it was a gem in which children and adults find magic and wonder in little things like a rainbow in a lawn sprinkler or grass growing between sidewalks, as the fairies linger in the periphery.

To me that little film captures what I remember about being a kid. You can live in the suburbs, the city, the country, wherever, but kids can find wondrous things anywhere if their imaginations are cultivated. It's why, when kids are surrounded by their newly-opened presents, they often play with the big cardboard box they came in. I was happy to be reminded of that fact.",1225843200,7,3007,4.5799256505576205
3009609,5,B000XUOIQY,"Disney never often let's us down when they produce movies and they hold true to form with this release that is dedicated to Peter Pan's friend Tinker Bell even though it is a straight to DVD movie.

The animation is done very well and the picture quality is gorgeous.  The more I see animated movies the more impressed I become with how well things look.

The voices and music are extremely well done.

Overall a wonderful and cheery movie that both young and old can enjoy - my 3-1/2 year old has watched it 3 times since we got this and I am still enjoying it also.",1225756800,2,567,4.271028037383178
3009610,5,B000XUOIQY,"Much as I dislike the phrase ""feel good movie"" this is probably the way I would describe Tinker Bell.

I had my reservations simply because kids films these days seem to center around body humor(ie fart ""comedy""), kids that are smart mouthed knowit alls, falling down comedy, or smarmy awww situations.

Tinker Bell has none of that.

Born of the first laugh of a baby; we see a dandelion seed make it's way to Neverland.  Guided by a pixie; it lands in the great tree of Pixie Hollow and Tinker Bell appears.  One thing I thought was clever was the fact her dress still looked like a dandelion feather.  She is greeted by the other fairies and soon the queen appears to set her wings and see what skill she has to offer.  I liked the fact she picked things such as a little girl would choose.  Flower, dew drop, light and she ignores the hammer which in turn goes to her.  She is a tinker.  At first she thinks it's interesting but instead of the great beauty of the garden fairies, the light fairies or the water fairies, she finds it to be rather ""nurdy"" and can't accept it.  Why can't she be one of the other fairies?  Add to the fact Tinkers do not go to the mainland which she want's to see simply because of the lost stuff she finds.  Tink decides she doesn't want to be Tinker and wants to learn one of the other skills.  Everything just doesn't work.  In the end, she learns she is a tinker.

Many comments have said the plot is weak.  Some times you simply have to sit back and take in the story and be entertained versus look for some meaning in every shot.  This film is aimed at children and should be viewed as such; which if you are young at heart, it will be fun.

I found the characters to be engaging and fun in their own way.  The animators did a good job in giving Tink that childlike fascination with the unknown which most adults seem to loose.

The animators also stayed true to Pan especially when you see Neverland and when they eventually make it to London.  My daughter was excited to see a cameo by the young Wendy Darling.

The scenery was brilliant.  They really did a good job of creating a new world with the linking of nature to the magic of the fairy.  Each character is influenced by nature as you will see in the personalities, clothing, etc.

One scene I just can't help laughing is when Tink shoots a squirrel in the head with a nut.  He just looks, makes a sad face and walks away trying hard not to cry.  My daughter keeps getting mad every time I laugh.

This type of film can fall to ""smarmyness"" and such areas were adeptly handled as when Tink talks to the dust handler and he tricks her into realizing her job is important and she should be proud of it.

The music of the film has a Celtic style which just goes with the imagery.

I found the extras interesting.  Especially the making of piece and the tour of Pixie Hollow.  At first I thought they cut corners and you don't get a tour of all the areas of pixie hollow; then I remembered we didn't get heavily into the other areas so a discussion of the winter fairies would have been wasteful.

There are the usual deleted scenes.  Some were good to be cut, one was a nice looking scene but it really didn't have a place, another that should have been in the movie was Tink trying to be a Garden fairy.

Do watch the making of piece as it explains their process and I found it reminded me of what Disney did to make Bambi.  They made a real effort to be faithful to Pan and to interject nature and the artists wandered through nature looking for inspiration for ideas.  If you didn't pick up on it in the movie, it will be made clear.

Again, this was a fun film and it's the first of a series.  I was not interested at first but I am glad I did watch and am looking forward to the next installment.  I will add this movie interested my girl into wanting the books for the Disney Fairy series.

3009612,3,B000XUOIQY,"Tinkerbell finally speaks!!! This should have been a big deal, but no. Does anyone but me remember that Tinkerbell never spoke before?

The visuals were pretty, but this film was a little too commercial for me. It reminded me of the $4 Hello Kitty video I found in a bargain bin at WalMart. Sole purpose -- sell fairy dolls, clothing, other licensed items. All these new characters that they can now sell to little girls. I know it's Disney's next big thing since they seem to think the Princesses are starting to run out of steam.

It was a little too sanitized for me. I guess I was hoping Captain Hook or Peter Pan would jump out of somewhere and capture Tink.

Continuity should count -- giving a young Wendy the music box messes up the time line for Peter Pan. Wendy's grandma -- maybe. But when do Peter Pan and the Lost Boys get lost?

There's a reason it didn't come out in theatres. Great for the four and younger group who get scared watching Beauty and the Beast.",1225670400,2,974,4.394444444444445

3009614,5,B000XUOIQY,"""Tinkerbell: The Movie"" (Disney, 2008)

With this film, Disney is trying to bridge the gap between younger girls, who love the princess stories (""Cinderella,"" ""The Little Mermaid"", etc.) and older, 'tweener types who are now into edgier material, such as the Bratz and Hannah Montana franchises.  The group this movie is aimed at, five-to-eight year olds, have been tilting towards the teen-oriented material, and this is an effort to bring them back into a younger mindset.

It's a welcome effort, certainly for many parents who may feel their kids are ""growing up too quickly,"" exposed to sophisticated or violent material that isn't really appropriate to their age groups. ""Tinkerbell"" is a good option, one that both parents and kids will welcome: it's wholesome, formulaic, cloying at times, but generally enchanting and refreshingly nonviolent.

The story is simple... Tinkerbell the fairy is born out of a dandelion seed, and learns about her life in the bustling fairyland of Pixie Hollow (based on the extensive Pixie Hollow book series).  There are plenty of magic sparkles and dazzling magical lights, a full contingent of friends -- both a set of supportive gal pals and a couple of nice, nerdy guys that she works with in the tinker shop -- and a few benign but slightly intimidating authority figures (the tinker shop boss, the fairy queen and the duke in charge of the annual spring celebration).  There's only one ""bad guy,"" a mean girl who is jealous of Tinkerbell and tries to undercut her successes, but no real violence or menace -- no one gets hit, or shot or physically menaced, and the mean girl gets her comeuppance in the end.

The story revolves around Tinkerbell's efforts to fit in. She is klutzy and insecure, yet also rebellious because she doesn't accept her role as a tinker (mechanically-inclined fairies who fix things around Pixie Hollow) and she also doesn't accept the limited role that other fairies see for the tinker group. With her natural talents and undying optimism, Tinkerbell eventually wins over her critics -- and even her own self-doubt -- and manages to win the day.  Her problem-solving skills and positivity make her a welcome role model for little girls (and boys, too, if they're into fairy stories...) and bode well for a continuation of this new Disney franchise.

The 3D-ish CGI animation is reminiscent of the ""Shrek"" films, with a few extra sparkles and sequins thrown in for good luck... It's not quite as dazzling or satisfying as the hand-painted masterpieces of the Disney classics of the 1940s and '50s, but it's still pretty captivating.  And while the music is a bit more contemporary and pop than I'd like, it's okay.  Much of the score has a Celtic twist to it, in the pop crossover-y Mary Black/Capercaillie/Clannad style, and that may be of interest to families with folk music/Ren Fair leanings... Overall, it's a pretty nice film.  I'm glad we got it for our little girly-girl to enjoy.  (Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain children's media reviews)",1225670400,2,3013,4.97808764940239

3009616,5,B000XUOIQY,"This is a very cute movie all about the origins of Peter Pan's sidekick Tinkerbell, and the trials and tribulations she goes through in her quest for self-discovery. I showed this movie to the students in my classroom during our Halloween party, and they all loved it, even the boys! I loved it, too!

It's a very easy movie to fall in love with, really. Tinkerbell is such a sweet, kindhearted and determined character, it's hard to believe she's the same jealous, spiteful little witch who tried to kill Wendy in Peter Pan. Her gaggle of pixie girlfriends are all very cute and likable, and her nerdy guy friends are really funny. The storyline is typically Disney, all about loving and accepting yourself as you are. And just like a typical Disney flick, it brought a tear to my eye!

This is an adorable, enjoyable film, and extremely well-made considering it is a straight-to-dvd movie. (let's be honest folks, As good as Disney movies are, their straight-to-dvd selection is sorely lacking in the quality department.) And from what I understand, this film suffered a number of setbacks and the original script had to be scrapped as it was practically unwatchable. Well, they certainly came a long way! I'll definitely be picking up subsequent Tinkerbell films, much to the delight of my students.",1225497600,5,1302,4.86036036036036
3009617,5,B000XUOIQY,I was pleasantly surprised with this movie as it never went through the theatre and I tend to not favor Disney's movies that don't hit the theatre first as they seem to be much too corney and tasteless to me.

3009619,4,B000XUOIQY,"The Good:
I rather enjoyed the movie.  It was an interesting take on the character.  Seeing that the already have a sequel down the pipes makes me think this version of Tink is going to be around awhile.  I wouldn't doubt if they had plans for a regular tv series at one point.  The animation is crisp and clean.

The Bad:
I was kinda disappointed that they didn't include the shorts of the characters that they've been showing as filler on the Disney channel.  They made it seem like it was going to be.  The extras in general, aren't that great.  I would have liked to seen more behind the scenes things.

The Ugly:
The first DVD I bought, didn't work.  Put it in the player, and nothing it just seemed to stop competly.  Returned it, got another copy.  Got home, put this one in the player..had the same problem.  Started trying to figure out why...turned then player on and off, poped the disc in and out..finnaly got it to work.  The problem lies in some software at the front of the disc.  The first thing it does is ask you what language you want the disc in....combined with their Fast Play option, causes the thing to do nothing.  It gets confused.  I do hope Disney fixes this problem.",1225411200,2,1195,4.383561643835616

3009621,3,B000XUOIQY,"First thing first the trailer is 80% false advertisement, meaning 80% of the trailer you see is no where in the actual Tinker Bell movie. The movie so fooled me according to the trailer.

Don't get me wrong the movie was good, my three year old watched it twice and leaves a good happy feeling.

But why the false advertising!!!??

3009622,5,B000XUOIQY,"Reasons the movie, Tinkerbell is enchanting, magical and sparkling:

1. The computer graphics are unlike anything I've ever seen before. They are clear, crisp, and the colors are so magical and vivid you feel as though you are there.

2. It is obvious that the creators of this movie had a tremendous respect for faerie-lore because it is NOT hokey or ""cheesy"" in any way. The realm of fairies is sacred to me and I was not insulted in the least.

3. Never a dull moment. There was always something magical happening on screen.

4. The imagination was ASTOUNDING. The creators of the show blew me away with their imaginative creations.

5. A lot of emotion and feeling behind the film, deep messages and meaning.

6. Many people might view this next point as a negative, but I do not: there were NO musical moments--no singing and no over-the-top cheesy, kiddie songs.

7. Speaking of music, the orchestral music played throughout the film was touching, soft and sparkly. It had a very Celtic vibe which fits into the genre of fairies. Hence, why I agree with #6. Musicals would not have suited the film. I believe that the creators made the correct musical decisions.

8. Children and adults are mesmerized by the film. This is not just a children's movie. My husband actually liked it as much as I did!

9. Character development was strong. All characters are likable. There are male characters who bring much humor to the film.

10. Very unique, atypical fairy story, very enchanting.",1225324800,6,1487,4.728682170542636
3009623,5,B000XUOIQY,"You see a lot of reviews saying how little kids will love this movie, well, I'm 43 and I don't have any kids, and I thought this was one of the best Disney videos I've seen in years.

Full of color and light and fun, an uplifting message, gorgeous animation, and a wonderfully imaginative take on the fairies' world, I enjoyed this movie so much I went to work the next day and told everyone about it.

If you want to recapture that feeling of innocence, joy, and imagination that you used to have as a kid watching the Wonderful World of Disney or seeing the Disney cartoon movies for the first time, this is the way to go. A sweet, charming, cheerful movie, with great characters that I'll be happy to see again. And I'll get to, since there are apparently a couple of sequels coming out. I sincerely hope they hold up to this standard.

By the way, I watched my copy in 3D with a pair of TV Eyes 3-D glasses I found online. This movie looks fantastic in 3D, almost like it was made for it! That may be responsible for part of my enthusiasm. I definitely suggest watching it in 3D if you have the chance. It's amazing.

I've noticed Disney has finally started to go back to it's roots, making more imaginative, wonderful, and heartwarming stories again (instead of just refilming old movies) if this video is an example of the way they're headed, then I'm back on the train for the ride. This may be about an old character, but it's a fresh new movie in it's own right. If I'd never heard of Tinker Bell I'd still think it was excellent entertainment.",1225324800,11,1553,4.344827586206897
3009624,5,B000XUOIQY,"J.M. Barrie first created the character Tinker Bell to appear in a play (Peter Pan) and then in a novel (Peter and Wendy) but her worldwide popularity is no doubt largely the result of her appearance in the Disney film that first appeared in 1953, Peter Pan. Tinker Bell later became the official Disney ""mascot"" in versions of the television series variously known as Walt Disney Presents, Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color, The Wonderful World of Disney, and The Magical World of Disney. The point is, she has been a major entertainment figure for more than 50 years and, at one point, was so popular that she received more fan mail than all others, including Marilyn Monroe.

Of course, children could not care less about her history but they continue to be delighted by her charm and energy. Tinker Bell is by nature a creature whose greatest talent is to ""tinker"" with whatever needs to be repaired; rather than pots and pans, she uses fairy dust that enables children to fly. Children love to explore secret places as when following Alice down a rabbit hole, or Peter Pan and the Darling children through an open bedroom window and then high above London at night, sailing with Geppetto, Figaro, and Cleo into Monstro's stomach, or visiting Pixie Hollow where Tinker Bell and the other fairies live. As in countless other Disney features, the production values in this film are outstanding, the music is seamlessly integrated with the plot developments, and the humor is appropriately playful. Also, I think the running time (78 minutes) is just right for younger children.

No need to list the special features.  Others have listed them and they do add substantial value, although the younger grandchildren with whom I see them seem interested only in the games whereas I much prefer the background material. Some animated features (including the Disney classics as well as several produced by DreamWorks and Pixar) have an almost unlimited shelf-life, retaining great appeal throughout and among various age groups. I doubt if that will be true of Tinker Bell or, for that matter, Peter Pan. However, that said, I think that those who have seen it, as they grow older, will still enjoy seeing it again and again with younger companions if only to observe their delight. For me, the fairy dust has lost none of its potency after all these years...and never will. How wonderful!",1225324800,2,2389,4.893827160493827

It's a great movie and even though this animation is computer generated and different from other Disney movies, it's so enjoyable and fun.
Voicing different characters are Kristin Chenoweth, America Ferrera, Angelica Houston, Jesse McCartney and Kathy Namjimy to name a few.  It's a sweet and charming movie and yet adults and even boys will find something in here for them as well.  For your little ones and tweens too, as part of the DVD extras, there is a music video by Selena Gomez.  The movie draws you in from start to end and it was thoroughly enjoyable.

We started reading all of the Disney Fairy books out there to get a preview of what may be coming. As usual, the books are rich with imagery and details while the video skimps or avoids on many of the rich details. Some elements are completely avoided or messed up.

My suggestion, if you read the books, you will be disappointed with some of the changes Disney made. The early books focus on characters you don't ever see in the movies. There are differences that can create confusion in your younger viewers (that have read the books), like ""Where's Mother Dove?""",1225324800,,649,4.692982456140351

I love the fact that it explained how Tinkerbell came to life and it showed girls that it's ok to figure out things in life and to do what you love to do in life. This movie went from the very begining of Tinkerbell's life to where she meets Wendy so my daughter put the connection together. It has the same houses, buildings, Big Ben, the second star, Neverland etc. that you see in the ""Peter Pan"" movie. The color and animation was beautiful!
It didn't drag on; it was enjoyable to watch & my 5 yrs. old daughter loves it.

3009630,3,B000XUOIQY,"Tinker Bell has come a long way and deserved to.

She started as small beam of light and tinkling bell in J.M. Barrie's legendary 1904 play ""Peter Pan,"" and reprised her role in his 1911 book, ""Peter and Wendy."" Since 1953 she's gained form as impulsive, voluptuous pixie, first in Disney's essential ""Peter Pan"" film, then sprinkling Disney magic (often beside Walt himself) as Disney's weekly TV hostess. As much as Winnie the Pooh or even Mickey Mouse himself, Tinker Bell is part of what makes Disney's empire what it is.

So even in a straight-to-DVD release, her first starring role had to be good and, for the most part, is. Director Bradley Raymond assembled a first-rate voice cast including Raven-Symone, Lucy Liu, America Ferrara, teen heartthrob Jessie McCartney and even the suitably wise and regal Anjelica Huston as Queen Clarion, queen of the fairies.  Thankfully, he made the film a companion piece rather than sequel to ""Peter Pan"": Neverland's steep, green mountains frame the action and Tink's own film ends where Pan begins, with the pixie meeting and gifting young Wendy.

The art work is naturally beautiful in both senses of the word. The story builds around how fairies transition and maintain nature and the seasons, and the film's scale and depth vividly paint autumn and winter (especially in the film's opening, which narly equals Disney's best mythmaking in its theatrical films). The DVD's recommended extras suggest Pixie Hollow carries the influence of 19th century German artist Albert Bierstadt, whose visions of the US Sierra Nevada and other Western images suggest a power in nature Disney happily pixie dusted.

The plot, meanwhile, is thin as Tink's new wings and just as well. Born from a baby's laugh and granted talent to work with pots and kettles, she yearns to visit the mainland (think of Ariel's wanting to be ""part of that world"") and is willing to trade new talents for her chance. Without spoiling the ending, she stays true to her own calling encouraged by fairies and other friends (including the requisite comic relief, two sprites named Clank and Bobble who do little but bumble and annoy.)

Besides the recommended ""making of"" extras, you also get a clever live-action film on how fairies interact with nature, the requisite Disney radio-friendly video from Selena Gomez (What? They couldn't have her sing with McCartney?) and a pleasant DVD interactive game. Overall, ""Tinker Bell"" as film is sweet, sassy and sprightly as the pixie pouting ar tiy from a minivan sticker, or greeting you Sunday nights for near three generations. Nice debut, long overdue and recommended.",1225152000,5,2627,5.04147465437788
3009631,5,B000XUOIQY,"My 3.5 year-old daughter loves Tinker Bell and all things to do with fairies. When I heard Disney was releasing a Tinker Bell movie, I was very excited and after viewing it today, we are both delighted and happy with the movie.

The story's premise is quite simple - Tinker Bell's origins are shown [and yes, she speaks here], and she finds that her talent is to be a tinker fairy. But, Tinker Bell[Mae Whitman] doesn't take to her talent with much enthusiasm - she feels her other fairy friends such as the water fairy Silver Mist [Lucy Liu], animal fairy Fawn [America Ferra], garden/flower fairy Rosetta [Kristin Chenoweth], and light Fairy Iridessa [Raven Symone] have 'real' talents and she is also upset that the tinker fairies aren't allowed to accompany the other fairies when they take Spring to the Mainland, i.e. London. Thus begins Tink's adventures in trying to adopt the other fairies' talents, until she eventually comes to the realization that being a tinker is what Tinker Bell does best.

The story itself has a good lesson underlying it, but what's truly wonderful about this production is the beautiful animation. Though it's CGI - the fairies don't exactly come across as wooden characters - the main fairies seem truly 'alive' and their facial expressions and voices make this one of the more appealing straight-to-DVD Disney releases. It definitely makes repeated viewings a likelihood.

I also loved the extra features on the DVD:

There's a Tinker Trainer - a DVD-ROM activity
Magical Guide to Pixie Hollow - where viewers get to see different parts of the fairy world with Tinker Bell and Queen Clarion acting as guides.
Ever Wonder - discover how fairies put the 'wonder' in natural wonders, a visual delight indeed.
An all-new music video performed by Selena Gomez
Creating Pixie Hollow - see how the filmmakers created the magical fairy world
Deleted scenes

The approximate running time is 78 minutes, just long enough that little ones don't start getting squirmy:)

All in all, both my daughter and I were delighted with this latest Disney production and look forward to a future installment with Tinker Bell and her friends from Pixie Hollow!",1225152000,2,2174,4.942465753424657
3009632,5,B000XUOIQY,"The other reviews hit the story and generic specs, but there are definitely some other things to consider in maybe wanting to own this BD.

The quality of the picture is phenomenal. All weekend I was playing it in the store and it managed to appeal to a broad audience (age and gender). The story, music and visuals had kids from 2 to 10 very involved. The adults actually sat for minutes at a time just because of the clarity and color palettes. Several cinephiles were going to get it just to demonstrate animation clarity for their home theaters. I have to disagree with the reviews of this film that say only kids under a certain age will enjoy this. A large volume of teens commented on how cool it looks and yes, especially the teen girls seemed interested that a quality film had been made.

The main selling point I saw was an outline of each feature (a peeve of mine was finally addressed regarding special features on a BD). One of the main facets of BD that most customers have been overlooking are the sometimes ""overwhelming"" or ""misunderstood/confusing"" extras. But in this case, Disney gives a brief description and time stamp for each special feature as you scroll by it. That made it more approachable for my kids as they were surfing through the extras deciding what they wanted to see.

Overall a fun film, an outstanding picture, thorough AND explained extras, and a good crowd pleaser.",1225065600,,1406,4.63855421686747
3009633,5,B000XUOIQY,"Watched TinkerBell this weekend and absolutely loved it!  I am a casual movie fan, so I don't analyze the graphics, the music, etc. I just know my 6yo daughter and I both enjoyed it. It was sweet, funny, and had a great message.  What more can we ask for in movies for our kids?",1225065600,4,278,4.12962962962963
3009634,4,B000XUOIQY,"I just watched TINKER BELL on Blu-ray and I was quite impressed.  Time was that direct-to-DVD meant, well, bad.  Low production values, second tier talent, and a disposable story.  Lately, however, a number of studios have begun struggling with ways to develop a business model that allowed them to make profits on projects that bypassed theater releases.  For instance, MGM has had some success with the Stargate movies, which have a solid but niche market, enough fans to buy DVDs with enthusiasm, but not enough general public support to justify a general release into theaters.  Universal has reputedly been thinking of the possibility of doing the same with a SERENITY sequel, a film that merely broke even (after international sales) in the theaters, but has been a huge success on disc.  My point is that it is no longer possible to dismiss anything that makes its debut on disc.

TINKER BELL is a great example of the greatly increased quality of direct-to-DVD productions.  Visually, this is just a stunning movie.  Story apart, there is never a moment when the film isn't utterly riveting.  As an adult I found it great to look at from beginning to end.  I think small children, especially young girls, will find it entrancing.  The story isn't very complex or nuanced, but there are some nice messages of empowerment.  If classic Disney frequently was mired in notions that the primary hope of women was for someday their prince to come, this one's theme is of a young fairy striving to be all that she can be.  The emphasis is on what she can make of herself, not only the need for a romantic Other to make her life complete.

I mentioned the relative lack of talent in traditional direct-to-DVD releases.  That is not the case here.  Tinker Bell is voiced by Mae Whitman, who many will know as the delightfully forgetable Ann on ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT (viewers of the show will know what I meant by that).  Some of the main fairies are voiced by such excellent performers as Kristin Chenoweth, America Ferrera, Angelica Huston, Lucy Liu, and Jane Horrocks.

Honestly, the movie is not going to blow most adults away.  This is very definitely a kids film.  As someone who raised a daughter as a single dad, however, I am confident that small children, especially young girls, are going to love this movie.  And it is something that adults will be able to enjoy watching a first time and not find too unpleasant on the unaccountable repeated viewings that very young children love to engage in (there are still many animated movies that my daughter watched a few dozen times that I have nearly every scene memorized).

If you have a small child, this is a very good movie to consider picking up, especially if the child in question is a girl.  It features very high production standards, is unbelievably beautiful to look at, and has a much better than average moral.  And it is clearly intended to be the first of at least two films, since an insert inside the case advertises a new Tinker Bell film to be released in the fall of 2009.",1224979200,5,3045,4.7
3009635,4,B000XUOIQY,"I just finished watching a preview copy of TINKER BELL and I was quite impressed.  Time was that direct-to-DVD meant, well, bad.  Low production values, second tier talent, and a disposable story.  Lately, however, a number of studios have begun struggling with ways to develop a business model that allowed them to make profits on projects that bypassed theater releases.  For instance, MGM has had some success with the Stargate movies, which have a solid but niche market, enough fans to buy DVDs with enthusiasm, but not enough general public support to justify a general release into theaters.  Universal has reputedly been thinking of the possibility of doing the same with a SERENITY sequel, a film that merely broke even (after international sales) in the theaters, but has been a huge success on disc.  My point is that it is no longer possible to dismiss anything that makes its debut on disc.

TINKER BELL is a great example of the greatly increased quality of direct-to-DVD productions.  Visually, this is just a stunning movie.  Story apart, there is never a moment when the film isn't utterly riveting.  As an adult I found it great to look at from beginning to end.  I think small children, especially young girls, will find it entrancing.  The story isn't very complex or nuanced, but there are some nice messages of empowerment.  If classic Disney frequently was mired in notions that the primary hope of women was for someday their prince to come, this one's theme is of a young fairy striving to be all that she can be.  The emphasis is on what she can make of herself, not only the need for a romantic Other to make her life complete.

I mentioned the relative lack of talent in traditional direct-to-DVD releases.  That is not the case here.  Tinker Bell is voiced by Mae Whitman, who many will know as the delightfully forgetable Ann on ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT (viewers of the show will know what I meant by that).  Some of the main fairies are voiced by such excellent performers as Kristin Chenoweth, America Ferrera, Angelica Huston, Lucy Liu, and Jane Horrocks.

Honestly, the movie is not going to blow most adults away.  This is very definitely a kids film.  As someone who raised a daughter as a single dad, however, I am confident that small children, especially young girls, are going to love this movie.  And it is something that adults will be able to enjoy watching a first time and not find too unpleasant on the unaccountable repeated viewings that very young children love to engage in (there are still many animated movies that my daughter watched a few dozen times that I have nearly every scene memorized).

If you have a small child, this is a very good movie to consider picking up, especially if the child in question is a girl.  It features very high production standards, is unbelievably beautiful to look at, and has a much better than average moral.  And it is clearly intended to be the first of at least two films, since an insert inside the case advertises a new Tinker Bell film to be released in the fall of 2009.",1224979200,2,3062,4.699812382739212
3009636,5,B000XUOIQY,"I was gladly surprised with this new flick from the Disney Studios. The animation was amazing: not a surprise, considering Pixar's boss John Lasseter was the Exec. Producer. But the visuals were not the only element that made Tinker Bell a great movie overall:

* The music very appropriately complements the whole fairy theme, courtesy of Sarah McLachlan, one of the world's greatest Celtic singers.
* The storyline takes this character born in the Peter Pan story and gives it a very detailed life, creating a whole mythology around her.

The result is a fun story that occasionally brought to mind Bee Movie (specially in terms of some of the elements of the story) but delivered in great Disney fashion.

I highly recommend the movie to anyone seeking a good family DVD to get for the holidays.",1224892800,2,798,4.810218978102189
3009637,3,B000XUOIQY,"TINKER BELL is a computer animated film that explains the origins of the famous fairy and sidekick to Peter Pan.  It is the first in a series of new Direct-to-DVD films being planned, promoting the newest Disney produced franchise, the Disney Fairies.  The movie begins with a baby laughing that sends a part of a plant from our world through the sky and into Neverland where at Pixie Hollow it rests beneath the fairy dust stream and is turned into a new fairy.  Taking a cue from Harry Potter, the fairy goes around from object to object looking for the object that will cue her of her talent and give her clan.  It is the Tinker's hammer that chooses the new fairy and the Queen bestows her name, Tinker Bell.  Tinker Bell is very excited about being a tinker.  Tinkering doesn't seem as interesting or as important as helping baby birds to fly or pollinating plants.  However, Tink does like to Tinker and is eager to use her talent until she discovers that Tinker Fairies aren't allowed to go to the Mainland to bring Spring.  This distresses Tinker Bell, but she is determined to visit the Mainland.  Along the way she undergoes some misadventures that eventually leads to a major accident that forces Tink to accept who she is.

The animation in TINKER BELL is stunning. The colors are brilliant and the movement of some of the characters is lifelike.  At the same time, things are too realistic.  Vibrant and vivid as Pixie Hollow is no one will mistake anything in this video for being anything other than animation.

The film is voiced by a very talented cast that includes America Ferrera, Kristin Chenoweth, Anjelica Huston, Lucy Liu, Raven-Symone, and Mae Whitman.  The score was written by Joel McNeely and many of the songs are performed Mairead Nesbitt of Celtic Woman.

The movie is entertaining enough to watch and the target audience of this film, young girls, will probably enjoy TINKER BELL the most.  I found the film to be relatively entertaining with just the right mix of humor and drama, though I found the central message of the movie (accept yourself for who you are) too syrupy to be of any substance.  Still, TINKER BELL is better than much children's direct to DVD dreck that is produced, including some previous Disney releases, e.g. CINDERELLA II.

The DVD includes a few extras including a DVD-ROM activity entitled Tinker Trainer; Magical Guide to Pixie Hollow, an exploration into the realms of the fairies with Tinker Bell; a short entitled ""Ever Wonder"" that uses live action and a little animation to illustrate all the things fairies do in our world; the music video ""Fly To Your Heart"" sung by Selena Gomez (from THE WIZARDS OF WAVERLY PLACE on the Disney Channel); a few deleted scenes; and previews for upcoming DVD releases.",1224633600,32,2768,4.74321503131524
3009638,3,B000XUOIQY,"The fairies aren't quite up to the Japanese standards for animations.
The skin and wings and shape are not up to the quality of the soundtrack?
At one time Disney set the standard, but even a child can see that
these drawing aren't as well done?
The story, dialog and plot-line are better than the actual animation.
If you are taking about ""magic"" and the land of Faerie, then you have to have the shine and glamor that is fantasy in the telling, in the imagination.
For me the drawing fell short of what they should be:
that is the fault of the art director.
No one would notice if there weren't better work that these can be compared to!",1224547200,,639,4.333333333333333
3009639,4,B000XUOIQY,"""Tinker Bell"" has gotten a lot of online commentary, most of it negative, so I wasn't really excited to watch my preview copy of this movie. I was VERY pleasantly surprised by what I saw. ""Tinker Bell"" is an enjoyable movie, perfect for children and even entertaining for adults. Based upon what I'd read previously, I would not have gone to a theater to see this; however, after watching it, I believe this movie is worthy of both big screen AND home entertainment viewing. Unfortunately, most of the banter has focused on the fact that Tinker Bell speaks. Personally, this is a minor point, as the animators have done a tremendous job of having Tinker Bell retain her spunky nature and movements that we all know from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peter-Pan-2-Disc-Platinum-Edition/dp/B000JBWWRY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peter Pan (2-Disc Platinum Edition)</a>.""

The story is fairly simple; Tinker Bell arrives in Pixie Hollow, where all the Fairies have talents. It is discovered that (no surprise) Tinker Bell's talent is ""tinkering"" or fixing things. However, in Tink's opinion, this is not very exciting. She'd rather be one of the Fairies who gets to take Spring to ""the mainland"" (aka London). As you can imagine, Tink's early time at Pixie Hollow is filled with figuring out who she really is and that she is just as important as the other fairies who have more glamorous talents. There is plenty of humor, emotion, and visual beauty that helps elevate what seems like an oft-told tale.

The animation is fantastic; although it is obviously computer generated, it is apparent that the level of the animators doing it is such that they focus on camera movements, lighting, color, and emotional nuances rather than just the basics. Still, the characters do still have somewhat of a doll-like/mechanical quality. The movement and facial emoting is a vast improvement over some of the early computer animation, but it does still have a little way to go.

There is also a first-rate cast behind the scenes, giving the voices to these animated characters: Anjelica Huston (Queen Clarion), Lucy Liu (Silvermist), America Ferrera (Fawn), Kristin Chenoweth (Rosetta), Kathy Najimy (Minister of Summer), and my favorite, Jane Horrocks as the sassy Fairy Mary. The Celtic-inspired score by Joel McNeely is also enjoyable and the perfect accompaniment to the film.

The extras include:

* Tinker Trainer: Hone your skills as a Tinker Fairy in this activity

* Magical guide to Pixie Hollow: Discover the Ancient Realm of Fairies with Tinker Bell

* Ever Wonder: Discover how Fairies put the ""wonder"" in natural wonders. Combining special effects with live action, you are ""shown"" how grass grows between the cracks in the sidewalk, etc. A cute little featurette.

* Creating Pixie Hollow: See how the filmmakers created this magical realm.

* All-new music video, ""Fly To Your Heart,"" by Disney Channel's Selena Gomez.

* Deleted scenes include optional introductions by Bradley Raymond (director) and Jeannine Roussel (producer): ""Queen Clarion's Pixie Dust,"" ""Fairies Venture to the Mainland,"" ""Becoming a Garden Fairy,"" ""Tinker Bell's Tinkering Talents,"" ""Vidia Tricks Tinker Bell,"" ""Fairies Express Tinker Bell's Importance""
While enjoyable, they are not really missed from the film.

* Sneak previews, most notably the Blu-ray version of 1940's ""Pinocchio."" It looks fantastic! Being released March 2009.

3009641,5,B000XUOIQY,"I was lucky enough to see a this early, and it is a truly wonderful film, especially for a straight to video feature. I prefer 2D animation to 3D, but the animation here is beautiful, particularly with the illustration of the different seasons.  The story is captivating, charming, and full of magic, and the explanation of each fairy's talent is tons of fun. Tinker Bell sure has come a long way from the jealous little pixie in ""Peter Pan"". As some have mentioned, Mae Whitman does a wonderful job giving Tink her first voice. And the soundtrack is lovely and quite refreshing. It has a distinctive Celtic flavor, and the very talented Loreena McKennitt lends her voice to the piece.

I can't wait to buy this and watch it again with my 10-year-old sister!",1224201600,9,758,4.649253731343284

Mairead is the fiddler/violinist for Celtic Woman.  She did many solos and did the reel for the song ""Sprinting Thistles.""

3009644,4,B000XUOIQY,"Saw this a week ago in Los Angeles at the El Capitan Theater.  If you're expecting a Pixar caliber story - look elsewhere.  If you're looking for Pixar artistry, this doesn't quite reach those dizzying heights.  But if you're after quality Disney entertainment for the little ones in your family (especially the female ones)  you can't really do much better.  I have a four year old girl, and this was the first movie (of three that we've seen together on the big screen) that she absolutely loved.  She enjoyed Wall-E, but much of it went over her head.  Horton Hears a Who, was also enjoyable and slightly too manic - but again, a lot of the wry humor and topical stuff she missed completely.

This movie had her enthralled from beginning to end - and I have to say was far less than painful for me to watch as well.  Now this isn't a ringing endorsement that could be afforded a Toy Story 1 or 2 or Cars (which are great films for BOTH parent and child to enjoy) but I have to say this film completely outclasses the Disney straight to DVD sequels that I've seen (dreck like Cinderella 3 and Alladin 2 - YUCK) and simply blows away the Barbie movies (which though excruciating to watch at times, do captivate my little girl and are surprisingly  pro-female).

Tinkerbelle, ultimately, is not a film for the young and young at heart - as the great Disney movies are; but it is leaps and bounds above the usual straight to DVD product that they have been shilling for the past decade.

The visuals are also light years beyond anything previously released in a straight to video format, and hold up to and even exceed the previous Disney CG features such as Chicken Little or Meet the Robinsons.

If you've got a 3 to 8 year old little girl - this is a must get.  Young boys will enjoy it too, there's more than enough to sustain interest.",1223164800,87,1839,4.4183976261127595

Both myself and my almost 4 year old daughter were mesmerized by the graphics, the color and the story.  It is very well done and I hope everyone has the opportunity to see it on the big screen like we did today because it is just beautiful.  FYI, there are 3 more movies to follow this one, hopefully on the big screen.  The message of the movie is also great for kids, that we can't all be good at everything but that's ok!  Tink is such a cute character as are the other fairies, I sometimes forgot they weren't real!  LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!",1222473600,80,708,4.2781954887218046
3009646,5,B000XUOIQY,"I went to see the movie this afternoon, yes.. here in Mexico is playing in teathers. It is a great, fantastic, incredible, wonderfull and beautiful movie. The movie was in Spanish and it was great, the music and the colors. What I like the most was the story, because it has a deep message, I mean it has to do with your own acceptance to society. Think has to prove and acept by herself what she was meant to be. She is like a mechanich or something like that, but she wants to be different until the moment that she figures it out what she really is. All the fairies are so beautyful, the colors and the 3-D animation. I am wondering why Disney studios did not give this project to Pixar Animation, because I can tell that the animation is a little poor compared with Wall-e, resolution and color are very good, Dubbing was incredible and the story remains me something naive and sweet. I strongly recomend this movie to little childrend, my wife love it, and I am actually cry because it has a lot of love. Oh... and my favorite character is ""queso"" or ""cheese"", a little mouse that helps tinker bell trying to capture weeds, and my favorite fairy is Vidia, because she is kind of evil but no so much, and she is prettier than tink. Queen Clayron is so pixie and understanding person, and tink's friends are so funy, specially the fat guy. I can't reveal the end, but I can say that Wendy is in the movie (yes... the Pete's friend). Finally, it seems that think has a friend that likes her a lot. I can't wait to compare this movie with the blu-ray version. My expections about this movie were so high and I can say that well done.

3009649,4,B000XUOIQY,"This DVD isn't out until October, but based on the trailer and the webisodes called 'Pixie Previews', there is plenty to base an opinion on to help people in their decision to purchase this DVD.

First, the Movie trailer and `Pixie Previews' are available to watch on youtube and Disney.com and they give a good introduction as to what to expect from this DVD. While not Pixar quality, the CGI featured shows a quality not unlike what we've seen in Chicken Little.

Second, an internet search helped reveal some of the DVD bonus features. Separated into two categories they are:

PIXIE HOLLOW - explores the world of the Fairies:
-Magical Guide to Pixie Hollow
-Tinker Trainer DVD ROM
-Ever Wonder Featurette

THE MAINLAND - explores the making of the movie:
-Creating Pixie Hollow
-Deleted Scenes

Third, I'm assuming that the trailer and the series of 6 `Pixie Preview' webisodes will also be included. Each webisode is about 2 minutes long and are creatively done to help introduce people to TinkerBell and the other Pixies (Not to mention the CGI world they will inhabit). These are:

Tink and the Bell
Tink and the Pepper Shaker
Fawn and the Log
Fawn and the Butterfly
Silvermist and the Fish
Iridessa and the Light Bugs
Rosetta and the Flower (There are apparently two versions of this one making the actual total to 7 webisodes.)

This Direct-to-DVD feature is also the first of 4 releases and the DVD will no-doubt boast at lease one trailer for these next releases:

Tinker Bell: North of Neverland (2009)
Tinker Bell: A Midsummer Storm (summer 2010)
Tinker Bell: A Winter Story (summer 2011)

And last but not least, this Direct-to-DVD feature will be a first for Disney. TinkerBell will talk! Mae Whitman will give Tinker Bell her first true voice. That is definitely something to look forward to!

3243169,3,B000XUOIQY,"Good movie, but if you're kid is sensitive or a animal and nature lover it might upset them. My daughter fell in love with the beauty of this movie the first 45 minutes or so. She shreiked with delight over the ladybugs, sunflowers, and landscapes in general then toward the end all of it gets destroyed by a rather ambiguous and scary stampede of what I think is an army of angry weeds. Seems silly, but she's sensitive and that part gives her nightmares and makes her cry when watching it. It really is a great movie with an awesome message, but avoid if you're young ones are sensitive. I really didn't know how to explain to her why all the beloved fairy gardens and creatures got obliterated.",1482105600,,697,4.453125

3243188,3,B000XUOIQY,"Born to a repressive totalitarian state, the all-powerful queen assigns Tinkerbell to the Tinker Caste at birth and tells her in no uncertain terms that will be her lot till the end of her days.  Shunned my higher-caste fairies, she tried to break out of her assigned role in life, but her efforts only bring disaster.  Ultimately she gives in, accepting her role but then using her skills to bring automation to the fairy world thereby undermining the power of the higher castes whose magical powers will no longer be needed.

Yeah, I'm being a bit snarky but that more or less is the plot.  Tinkerbell is assigned a role in life, tries to break out of it, fails, and ultimately becomes a cog in the system.  A perfect message for young children.

Despite the not-so-hidden corporate message it's a perfectly OK children's film.  Our daughters love it and want to be fairies for Halloween.

For adults there's not much to distinguish it.

There's no songs or musical numbers and the animation is OK at best.  Tinker and her friends all have that generic 'spunky girl' voice you hear in every cartoon and the sort of skin-deep diversity common in kid vids.  Skin tones vary but all the heroines have the same, bubbly personality, skinny body and heart-shaped face.

It spawned a franchise other other Tinkerbell films, which I'll probably end up getting for my girls.  But I can see them outgrowing this pretty quickly.",1477008000,,1419,4.742857142857143

3243264,4,B000XUOIQY,"This is an absolutely delightful fairy tale, with beautiful scenics, beautiful people, well, fairies, and an endearing story. Too often big production animation films kind of forget they're supposed to have a story, so fascinated by the graphics and technological brilliance of the animation are they. This first Tinker Bell film explains her existence, and that of all the other fairies, along with Pixie Hollow, their magical home, and Neverland. Tinker Bell gets her name from the Queen right after she is ""born"" (of a baby's laugh). Tink has to pick implements that tell her what her talent is, but the Queen surely already has an idea of what that is. Tink walks by the hammer, and it simply radiates light brightly, indicating the level of her talent, which is substantial. Tinker Bell doesn't realize how much talent she has, and at first doesn't think being a tinker is such a big deal, but, as it turns out, she, and all of us, find out that her talent is perhaps the greatest of all the fairies, and that she is not just a ""tinker,"" but an inventor and engineer, creating magnificent, useful devices out of random washed-ashore junk from the mainland. Thereby hangs the tale, that she, and all the fairies at Pixie Hollow, come to know the value of precious Tink, and why she is the preeminent protagonist in all of her movies, starting with this one.  The whole series is a must see for anyone that loves fantasy, has a sense of humor, and enjoys visually stunning images, coupled with decent music.  They're not ""Frozen"", or ""Tangled,"" but they're not far off either.",1450051200,,1579,4.738181818181818

The DisneyToon Studios responsible for its creation and headed no less than by John Lasseter of Pixar fame, took great care to ensure the first to the last of the Tinker Bell movies not only have great stories, great characters (it's Tinker Bell c'mon now), but really great artistic and production value to boot.

3243313,5,B000XUOIQY,"My 3 year old daughter has fallen for all of the Tinkerbell movies.  She really loves this one.  She especially loves the part where Tinkerbell rides her mouse friend ""Cheese"" in a rodeo-style roundup scene.  It's quite comical.  In this movie, there are many types of fairies...garden fairies, fast-flying fairies, light faires, etc.  Tinkerbell learns that not everyone respects the art of being a tinker fairy, so she decides she doesn't want to be a tinker anymore.  She tries to be something she's not and it ends up in disaster.  At the end of the movie, Tinkerbell learns that embracing who you are is important and she ends up saving the day with her tinker skills.  It's a movie about loving and believing in yourself, no matter what anyone else thinks.
On a different note, I looked all over the place trying to find a toy of ""Cheese"" the mouse.  Disney doesn't make toys of him, even though he's in all of the movies.  I ended up buying this one :  http://www.amazon.com/Douglas-Cuddle-Toys-247-Kernel/dp/B000HHM7UM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1436225472&sr=8-1&keywords=stuffed+mouse+kernel

No more Ariel giving up her passions for a guy she just met, or Belle playing Captain Fix a Jerk ""If I stay long enough, eventually he will be nice."" Now we have TinkerBell's story! This focuses around Tink and her good group of girl friends as they all discover their talents and follow their instincts and never give up. We have all of these movies, including The Pixie Hollow Games and The Search for the NeverBeast ( I think that's the title) and THESE movies I am thrilled to have on constant repeat. Instead of waiting for their princes-or in their cases, Sparrowmen- to save the day, these fairy women are hard working and making their world their own as they shine on messages like the meaning of friendship, getting back up when you're knocked down, and never giving up hope. They are empowering the females in these stories - the Tinker Guild isn't run by a man, it's run by Fairy Mary! And The Dust Keeper leader is Fairy Gary, who is proud to wear his kilt wherever he goes! I LOVE IT.  All of the actors,writers, animators, etc. should be proud for being apart of this.

What's difficult to reconcile is the Tinkerbell character from this film and the same one in the original Peter Pan film who wanted to basically kill Wendy with a pirate canon and who obsesses over her hip size(!)  Basically toss continuity out the window and it's a fine kids story with colorful animation",1413158400,,423,4.716216216216216

3243576,5,B000XUOIQY,"The CGI-animated Disney Fairies property film Tinker Bell, on the surface, seems to be the kind of film that would be obviously be terrible. However, it is a surprisingly well-done and enjoyable film. Even as a property that exists solely to promote toys to children, the filmmakers still put significant effort into the character design, world design, music, and animation.

First off, the animation is fluid and well-done. Its not quite up to Pixar standard, but it comes close for DisneyToon Studios. The next noticeable good thing about this movie is its music. It does a great job of setting the wondrous tone of the world and the narrative. To the Fairies They Draw Near by Loreena McKennitt has that sound that invokes child-like awe and a beautiful melody of fantasy.

Another thing this film does quite well is world-building. The source material, both the Disney film and the original J.M. Barrie tale, provide little background on the world of fairies, but this film expands the fairy lore with a complete world. Although, the downside is that although its established that Pixie Hollow is connected with Never Land, it never clarified where it is exactly. But the fairies have distinct jobs connected with nature (many of which funnily resemble the Bending arts of Avatar lore), and worlds within their own environ.

The characters are enjoyable. However, this Tinker Bell is NOT the Tinker Bell of Peter Pan, at least, not yet. Her character works for this franchise quite well, but it is not in harmony with the source material. This Tinker Bell is kind, if not impatient, helpful, understanding, sweet, and friendly. Her negative traits, like her vanity and jealously, oddly enough, seem to have passed onto another character named Vidia, voiced by Pamela Adlon. Speaking of which, the voice acting in this film is well-cast and well-performed. Mae Whitman gives a kindness but still strong voice to Tink. Kristin Chenoweth, Raven-Symon, Lucy Liu, and America Ferrera all do well as Tinks fairy friends Rosetta, Iridessa, Silvermist, and Fawn, who each represent the different job classes of the fairies. Even Jesse McCartney shows he has acting range as Terrance. Anjelica Huston has regal presence as Clarion, the Fairy Queen, and voice acting veterans Rob Paulsen and Jeff Bennett are tolerable if not grating as fellow Tinker fairies Clank and Bobble.

The plot is a tad on the predictable side, but it works for children. As usual with Disney DVDs, the DVD extras are great, expanding the world and are colorful and interactive. Selena Gomezs music video is visually uninspiring, but thats a DVD music video for you.

Overall, this was a good start to open this franchise with. It established the tone, world, and characters well, and left open the possibility to expand the world further with more characters and seasons. For an opening effort, a strong start. B+",1402790400,,2884,5.012526096033403

3243594,5,B000XUOIQY,"Before watching this movie I honestly thought it was going to be horrible.  Disney put out an absolute ton of terrible sequels during the 2000's that I do my very best to avoid - with four kids that love Disney it is not entirely possible, but we try.  I am very pleased to say that I was happily surprised with Tinker Bell.  All of the Tinker Bell/Pixie Hollow movies are great.  They each have a quality story that aims to be fun and to teach a lesson.  But most importantly they seem to be an answer to the proliferation of pointless princess movies that tell girls to be pretty above all else.",1399507200,,597,4.294642857142857

3243630,5,B000XUOIQY,"I'm 23 years old, and saw an ad for this movie on television. With an avid interest in art, I was impressed with the animation and wanted to watch, even if it was a kid's movie. It took me a long time, but I finally caved and rented this through Amazon Prime.

Can I just start by pointing out that ""Family Movies"" are rarely actually family movies anymore? Okay, older Disney movies have enough adult jokes in them that sometimes it's uncomfortable to watch with a little kid, especially the highly observant, very smart ones that catch on despite the subtlety! ""Family Movies"" these days are often so ""dumbed down"" that as much as a kid might like it, the adults watching the movie WITH them can be put to sleep (or feel really embarrassed that they're watching at all...). As ""dumbed down"" kid's movies are these days, the adult stuff has also gotten a whole lot more violent and graphic in every way. I used to be able to watch it, distance myself from it, but not anymore. I guess I've just been over saturated with it, especially since the exact same stuff is in the news. I watch movies to escape reality, not be forced to empathize with characters who suffer for an hour and a half.

That said, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and was hugely impressed with the complexity of what I thought would be a simple tale with fancy graphics. The animation quality is top notch. The music is as moving as the score you might hear in the theater. And the story itself, while somewhat predictable, is nonetheless interesting. Character progression is great, and I love all the detail that's gone into these movies (yes, I watched more than one!). Not just literally, either, like the texture of the leaves that make Tink's dress, or the delicate pattern of each fairy's wings, but in the expressions and body language of each character, the care with which even background characters are rendered. You can look anywhere on the screen and fairies are doing their own thing. Many family movies these days lose the immersion effect because they cater TOO much to children. They go for a cheap laugh and a cliche moral tale. Well, this is just a friendly, light hearted story. It's not for KIDS, though that might be their intent, it's for ANYone interested in a good, clean, no stress, cheerful story.

ONE thing I didn't like: A couple times, throughout the series of Tinkerbell movies, some cliche jokes fell short. Particularly the scenes that were supposed to highlight Bobble and Clank's antics. These two guys are cute, I like them, but going for the time tested ""Oh, haha, he's doing something dumb!"" jokes isn't very enjoyable. That said, it was only a couple times, and the rest of the 90% of it was material presented in a fresh way. The writing is quick and snappy, and several times I was caught off guard with the humor and the delivery. The conversation between characters is realistic, and that's hugely appreciated.

Major Kudos to this feature: The female cast. It's not thrust into your face that this is a ""movie for girls."" I expect boys can like it too. It doesn't matter that a character is female, their personalities are relateable and interesting. There isn't any ""female power!!!!"" spirit (I enjoy those movies too, but sometimes they go over the top a little bit...). The writers and animators of Tinker Bell just let the characters BE. The characters lead by example and women are shown as heroines, background support, artists, daring doers, gardeners, leaders, all of that. The main female character is an engineer, for goodness sake, and valued not for her ability to 'fantastic' things, but for doing very real creative and mechanical work. We don't have men eyeing them up, or catcalling, or any of that. Speaking of which, the male characters are treated with equal respect, though they aren't the mains, and portrayed with a variety of personalities. These personalities might be called cliche by some, but they're the cliche personalities that don't get as much love as the Arnold Schwarzenegger types. (Woah, Schwarzenegger is programmed into spellcheck!) The real life friction between genders is non-existent, in other words, and I really like that. I think it sets a great example for a younger generation. I suppose the other side of this sword is that most of the female characters are practically cut and paste in body type and weight, the exception being Miss Fairy Mary. As a woman on the heavier end of the scale, though, I can say I wasn't bothered. Then again, I'm 23 and don't have issues with my bodily image because of a cartoon!

Someday I'll have kids, and believe me, Disney can expect a little pocket change from my purchases of these movies. I think Disney's ""new classics"" can really learn a lot from the crew, writers, and directors behind these Tinkerbell movies. I really hope there are many more to come!",1377561600,,4860,4.733175914994097

3243643,4,B000XUOIQY,"Perhaps I'm a bit picky, but the sarcasm and teenaged behavior of the new fairies is a bit beyond the social scope of a toddler or early preschooler.  They generally don't get sarcasm.  And the snippy quality is something they are learning from the video rather than a genuine behavior of a toddler.  Only because my daughter is 3 and will face children who have seen these kinds of movies and model the behaviors (also possible from modeling actual teenagers), I figured it was okay.

Aside from the slightly odd teenager qualities of the fairies, it's a Tinker Bell movie filled with fairies!  It's fun. And I like that Tinker Bell is so feminine and an engineer too.  And my daughter likes it a lot.  Not obsessed.  But she likes it.  And she'd want to see more Tinker Bell movies, I think.",1373673600,,793,4.528169014084507

3243679,4,B000XUOIQY,"There's a point in which Bell encourages the mouse she's straddled on to set-off on capturing the feared sprinting thistles, though he's afraid. It doesn't take long. All she has to do is breathe a few whispery words of encouragement into his ear and he can't resist. I bet that's because she's so pretty, as are most of her lady peers.

They're co-workers from Never Land's Pixie Hollow, divided only by their job titles and the perks those jobs provide. Bell is a tinker fairy, hence the Tinker Bell name, and it is her job to make and fix things. It's when she finds out, much to her dismay, that tinkers don't get to go to The Mainland that the story's plot starts to unfold.

Some of the music is too contemporary for such a mythical concept. The beginning and ending song vocals are particularly questionable. But it's a cute movie and the 3D animation is absoultely adorable. It's Tinker Bell though, specifially her Disney-perfect face and the life-like emotional expressions it conjures, that's most magical.

I'm a major 3D animation fan and have high standards and did not expect much with this direct to DVD show. I was pleasantly surprised. I believe some of the Pixar team has been involved in each of these movies. The animation is movie quality and the story even kept me (dad) engaged. Along with the rich animation I enjoyed the innocence story and clean character development. The entire series has been very enjoyable and I'm not sure who wants to see the next one more.. my daughter or me.,1355270400,2,564,4.380952380952381

You'll see amazing fairys flying around the beautiful garden with wonderful blooming flower. And there's beautiful rainbow colors on them. A fantastic awesome  purple huge grand tree with perfect shiny goldish powder on the flat ground where you could be pretty and smell good. When you turn the TV on you'll see wonderful fairys lined up perfectly just waiting for you to watch their show! It's hilarious and it's full of humor you'll think it's stupendous and you won't be sad any more. You won't be bored you will be happy you will be joyful after you've done watching. If it was me I would give it five stars now how about you? I believe that this is the best movie you could ever watch. If you liked fairys you'll love Tinker bell because most kids who liked fairys also loved Tinker Bell. So rais up your money and be ready to see the best movie ever.

3243730,5,B000XUOIQY,"I wouldn't call this film a feminist classic, and it is certainly one more racist movie in the great Disney tradition, but it does attempt in its own endearing way to teach little girls about solidarity and sisterhood. The filmmaker tries so hard to be politically correct that his film practically passes out from the effort, but he also emphasizes the fact that, in spite of all her troubles, Tinker Bell is still a hottie. One word of advice: as soon as your daughter sees this movie, she will probably want to be Tinker Bell for Halloween. In fact, your little boy might, too.",1348185600,,580,4.586538461538462

The blu-ray looks so much more in depth, colorful, detailed than the DVD version. The price for my daughter's happiness is nothing. It was shipped quickly, even without prime and I'm quite happy because she is happy. Would I recommend this? As a Christian... no.

3243750,5,B000XUOIQY,Tinker Bell is a 2010 Disney animated movie that deals with the lives and the magic of small fairies. TinkerBell being the main star of the movie is out on an adventure and ends up being captured by a human girl. After this the adventure truly begins. The CGI animation is amazing and the music is very good also. A movie that small girls and people that like animated Disney movies will love. I really enjoyed it. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.,1325462400,,446,4.518518518518518
3243751,5,B000XUOIQY,"I caught this movie on my Tivo in Nov. 2011 and my 2yr old daughter loves watching it so much that I got her the Bluray/DVD combo for Xmas.  Compared to all the other movies that she likes to watch the Tinker Bell movies are much more enjoyable for parents to watch along with her.  It doesn't have any hidden jokes for adults like some other movies but it's also not so overly cutesy and annoying as other kid movies either.  Also if you're paying attention the later installments of the Disney Fairy series you'll see things carried forward from previous movies.

As a dad with a science and engineering background I appreciate the fact that Tinker Bell is a Tinker Fairy which means she builds and fixes stuff.  She's not a Disney Princess that is simply looking for a rich prince to marry.  That makes her a pretty good role model for a little girl (other than the fact that she's a fairy and not a human).  Also Tink isn't a perfect character.  By that I mean she makes mistakes and learns from them rather than doing everything perfectly all the time.  Her tinkering doesn't always go as planned and she tends to get mad when things go awry which only make things worse.  Eventually she learns to control her temper and fix her mistakes which is a good lesson for kids.  She also has to learn to ask for help from time to time which is another valuable lesson.

The Bluray and DVD are great as expected and the animation is top notch as you'd expect from Disney CG.  I use the Bluray in my PS3 on my big screen TV and the DVD in our portable player in the car when needed.

p.s. I'll be posting this on all of the Tinker Bell movies we've purchased since we like them all equally.",1325376000,,1686,4.311111111111111

3243753,5,B000XUOIQY,"My husband purchased this for me and I love it. I know I'm almost 30 and still watching these movies (with no kids mind you) but they just make me happy so who cares! lol.  This movie is so cute and heart-warming. It's about the beginning of Tinker bell, which is a cool concept. The animation is pretty good, although I did notice it is no where near as slick as regular disney movies. That being said, it is still a wonderful movie, and looks and sounds great too. The kids will love it. I'm sure if your kids had it on in the background, you wouldn't be getting much work done because it's so fun to watch you just can't help it. On the other hand, my husband watched it with me and was a little squirmy and antsy and kept getting up and walking around, so it's probably just for us girls. However, I did ask him if he liked it, and he said, ""It's okay. It's not really my thing, but I can see why you like it."" (In a non-condescending way). Which I took to mean that it was WAY too girly for him. :) So, if you love disney movies, enjoy tinker bell at any age, and don't mind fairies singing, I would definitely recommend this movie! Also, if you are like me and watch kids movies or disney flicks when you're feeling low, it's a sure fire way to cheer you up! :)",1322784000,3,1267,4.088353413654619

3243759,4,B000XUOIQY,"My six-year-old daughter loves Tinker Bell and all things to do with fairies. This first story in Disney's Tinker Bell series of movies is simple yet delightful - Tinker Bell's origins are shown [and yes, she speaks here], and she finds that her talent is to be a tinker fairy. But, Tinker Bell[Mae Whitman] doesn't take to her talent with much enthusiasm - she feels her other fairy friends such as the water talent fairy Silver Mist [Lucy Liu], animal talent fairy Fawn [America Ferra], garden/flower talent fairy Rosetta [Kristin Chenoweth], and light talent Fairy Iridessa [Raven Symone] have 'real' talents and she is also upset that the tinker fairies aren't allowed to accompany the other fairies when they take Spring to the Mainland, i.e. London. Thus begins Tink's adventures in trying to adopt the other fairies' talents, until she eventually comes to the realization that being a tinker is what Tinker Bell does best.

The story itself has a good lesson underlying it, but what's truly wonderful about this production is the beautiful animation. Though it's CGI, the fairies don't exactly come across as wooden characters and the fairies seem truly 'alive'. Their facial expressions and voices make this one of the more appealing straight-to-DVD Disney releases. It also holds up to repeated viewings. My daughter first watched this when she was 3.5 and she still requests it!",1312156800,,1388,5.06113537117904
3243760,5,B000XUOIQY,"As a princess-fearing mom of a 3 year old girl, I was a bit hesitant to jump on the TinkerBell bandwagon. But, after seeing TinkerBell with my daughter, I have to say, I enjoy TinkerBell.
- The score is amazing, lovely little Celtic-inspired melodies
- The color saturation and artistry of the fairies and plants is amazing. I was very impressed.

Now for the actual plot:
TinkerBell is plopped into Pixie Hollow and discovers she is a tinker fairy. She's not exactly thrilled by this, since she won't be able to go to the mainland to deliver spring to the world. She attempts to be a nature fairy by trying other talents (failing miserably, but she's persistent). In the end, she embraces who she is as a tinker fairy, repairs the damage she has done, and lives happily ever after.

Character traits I've discussed with my daughter:
Interdependence (helping each other out), being yourself (Tink is much happier when she embraces her true talent), fixing your mistakes (Tink wants to run away after she causes a huge mess, but comes back to fix everything and holds herself accountable).

I like that TinkerBell is a character I can embrace. Yes, she does occasionally act like she's 4, but look at the target audience. Children can relate to Tink and since she does come back to fix things, parents can use TinkerBell as a springboard to discussing behavior. Unlike the princesses, where the overall theme is to be pretty to get a boy (Little Mermaid even gives up her voice for a man!) TinkerBell is a creator and a rebuilder and isn't focused on getting a boy. That is something I want my daughter to see, rather than the princesses.",1308182400,,1637,4.677083333333333
3243761,5,B000XUOIQY,My 5 year old loves this movie - no scary parts and just a good story.  We also bought it for my 3 year old niece who loved it as well!,1305072000,,135,3.3548387096774195
3243762,5,B000XUOIQY,"I love Disney films, their always put together so well but I love the new addition of the Disney Fairies. Tinkerbell deserved her own films, she is such a popular and loveable character so it only made sense to create a film with a storyline that surrounded tinkerbell. I am a 23 yr old woman and I love animation films and disney films. I came across this movie one night when I was bored and I wasn't aware Disney created a few movies that were about tinkerbell and her friends, so i popped the movie in and It kept my attention the whole time, the animation was wonderful, and the storyline was very cute, also all the characters were well thought out and tinkerbell looked better than ever. I loved everthing about this movie. It is now one of my favorites in my movie collection. I think this is a fun film for all ages, my husband even enjoyed the film and I have watched this quite a few times since I purchased it. Any child would enjoy this film, this is a feel-good film and you will find your self laughing & loving the beautiful animation and who couldn't enjoy such a cute story. Dont past this film up, its a must watch on my list and im sure a favorite of many others.",1304294400,,1183,4.262222222222222
3243763,1,B000XUOIQY,Two thumbs down.  This movie is too simplistic and dumbed down.  The animation is cold.  They could have done a lot better.,1297555200,,123,4.5
3243764,1,B000XUOIQY,"I'm surprised that no other parents picked up on the bad message this movie has! The Tinkerbell in this movie is whiny, throws temper tantrums whenever she does not get her way, and is horribly insulting to her fellow ""Tinker"" fairies. The trailers claim this is a movie about being proud of who you are, and I guess that in the end, Tink learns that lesson, but not before she acts like a spoiled brat, insists on getting her way, and in doing so, ruins months of work and even puts other fairs in danger during the stampede of the run-away thistles that SHE caused.

What's worse is that after ruining months of hard work and preparation and endangering everyone else, she is let off the hook completely when she fixes her mess. While fixing her mess is a good thing, another fairy gets punished for her part in the stampede, and Tink is NEVER held accountable for her actions!

The message? If you are whiny enough, throw enough temper tantrums, and insult others, not only will you get your way in the end, you will not be held accountable for any bad behavior on your part. I'm just not sure that Walt would have EVER approved of this spoiled, whiny version of Tinkerbell, or the messages in the movie. Granted at the end, Tink finally learns to be herself, but it's all her other bad behavior that goes unpunished that ruined this movie - at least for this parent. I can guarantee that if my daughter ever behaved that way, she certainly would not be rewarded for it, and she would serve some serious time grounded in her room! If you do watch this movie,I think it will warrant some discussion with your kiddos.",1297296000,15,1618,4.48135593220339
3243765,3,B000XUOIQY,"Well before you snicker at the mental image of a grown man sitting down for an evening of Tinker Bell, consider this: With a budget of 48-mil, distribution by Disney and Executive Producer credit going to none other than Pixar's big cheese John Lasseter, it's only natural that my tour of the computer generated feature film make a stop at Pixie Hollow.  And in this case that stop includes a trilogy of entries no less (two more reviews of said property to follow).

That said, Tinker Bell is a 2008 direct-to-dvd (in the USA) CGI feature film based on the famous Peter Pan supporting character/ company icon that earns a G-rating and 78-minute runtime.  For better or worse, the film takes multiple liberties with the source material that seem to have fallen on the side of criticism by many long-time Peter Pan aficionados.  Not the least of these is the fact that Tinker Bell is able to speak in this iteration, which completely replaces the sound of a jingling bell that accompanied her onscreen presence in the 2D films.  Sorry fans, Peter Pan, Captain Hook, and the Lost Boys are nowhere to be found in this piece as well.  Viewers are, however, treated to such pixie-lore elements as the birth of a fairy and how Tink ends up in her trademark jagged-green threads, er leaf fibers as the case may be.

Aside from representing Tink's back story, Tinker Bell is based on the simple premise that the title character ready, willing, able and eager to help in the important fairy tasks such as changing of the seasons, and sets her sites on traveling to the mainland (where we lowly humans dwell). However, she soon learns that her lot in life is that of a tinker fairy meaning that her job is to assemble and repair the various items in Pixie Hollow that the ""important"" fairies require to do their magical jobs.

Tinker Bell, naturally, wants no part of being a glorified mechanic and tries (with some humorous results) to attempt the jobs of some of the other fairies before discovering it best to be yourself.  There's a moral here that will likely resonate with the kids even if the pretty visuals or bubbly personalities of the characters don't immediately win them over.

Speaking of, the CGI animation is of decidedly high caliber as it should be, given the assimilation of Pixar into the Disney fold.  Rich textures, crisp colors and well animated character models all add up to a solid visual presentation.  A Celtic-inspired score by Joel McNeely and a pretty solid voice cast complete the grade-A feel.

Now it's only fair to nitpick a bit as well as there are a few rough spots that deserve examination.  For example, Tinker Bell's very name is derived from the fact that her birthing ceremony identifies her as a tinker fairy and hence her name is actually Bell.  So then is it safe to assume all of the fairies are given names based on their occupation? Actually, no.  For whatever reason Bell's fellow tinkers do not seem to have the word anywhere in their names.

Then there is the matter of the second half of her name.  The little fairy in Pan jingled like; you guessed it, a bell! Unfortunately that element is completely removed here as well.

Additionally, the fairy of the classic tale (and not just in Disney's incarnations) has received a major personality retooling.  Forget the jealous, spiteful, mischievous but unwaveringly loyal sidekick you likely know and sort of love, here Tink is a modern lady with fashionable sensibilities and charm to match.

The pacing is a bit deliberate and drawn out, not unlike the classic animated pieces of Disney lore.  In other words, it feels a bit more like a modernly styled classic 2D animation film than it does a scaled down Pixar blockbuster.

In all, younger viewers, whom surely Disney intends this work, will likely enjoy this tale.  Adults will find a few moments to enjoy while appreciating the solid moral efforts interlaced with the tight visuals.  This series is certainly in a league above computer generated animated primarily-girl series like Barbie or Strawberry Shortcake but falls a tad bit short compared to the excellence that's been given in the past by the Pixar/Disney juggernaut.",1297296000,,4172,4.777158774373259

('u~) Spring is my favorite season cuz the beautiful trees regrow their foliage, many flowers begin their blooms, and the many animals of nature awaken from their winter slumber and begin frolicking out and about.

3243777,5,B000XUOIQY,"At last, TinkerBell, the little pixie fairy created by J.M. Barrie and re-introduced to the world as a sexy beauty and corporate icon in the 1950's by Walt Disney in his animated classic, ""Peter Pan"", has been given her own film series, kicked off in 2008 by the aptly titled ""TinkerBell"". This first film was actually just the next step in an already successful ""Disney Fairies"" franchise that began with the hit book, ""Fairy Dust and the Quest for the Egg"", and was followed by 2 more hardcovers (the third book was just released, though it`s the 4th if you count ""In the Realm of the Never Fairies: The Secret World of Pixie Hollow"", which is like the big guidebook) and several paperbacks, along with other merchandise and a new series of graphic novels I've been keeping up with myself (as I particularly like graphic novels, though I also own the Quest for the Egg and Realm of the Never Fairies, and intend to get the other two hardcovers in time). And, something worth noting before even discussing the film is that there is a big change fans of the books must be prepared for. Though there are many similarities, including some consistent characters, Tink's core group of friends in the film are different characters from those in all the books. I can't expand too much on this factor, as I haven't had time to read any of the books yet, aside from the first graphic novel I have also written a review for.

Now, ""TinkerBell"" the film tells the tale of, well, TinkerBell, of course. It's basically an origin story that begins with her birth from the laugh of a baby, as all fairies are born, fully grown and with a complete grasp of the English language. Yes, we finally get to hear Tink speak, and while I may have had an issue with this when I first heard about it, I got over it long before the film came out and she sounds fine voiced by Mae Whitman, so no problems there. Upon coming into the world (and here we get to see her in a white ""dress"" with her hair down, looking like a goddess if I do say so myself, but I have a serious thing for Tink), a ceremony is immediately held for Tink to discover her fairy talent. This is done magically, and cannot be chosen by the individual. It is discovered that Tink is a Tinker (hence the name), a maker and fixer of things for the other fairies to use. Tink is okay with this at first, though a little disappointed, as it is clearly not as glamorous as being a type of nature fairy. However, when Tink discovers that being a Tinker means you don't get to make the big trip to the mainland to help usher in Springtime, she is very upset and sets out to learn a different talent. Tink has a great curiosity of the mainland, as she has found objects that came from there and is the only fairy with the talent to figure them out. The film focuses both on Tink's struggle to fit in and find herself and also on her attempts to work herself into the mainland excursion. Of course, in classic Disney fashion, a happy ending is had by all.

""TinkerBell"" turns out to be one of the best things ever to come directly to Disney home video, if not THE best. In fact, I could easily imagine this having a big screen release, so it's really too bad they didn't go that route. It was definitely more deserving than ""Jungle Book 2"" (and that's coming from a huge Jungle Book fan who would have loved a properly done sequel), and even more deserving than the fairly good but still very flawed ""Return to Neverland"". It's just a great little movie with surprisingly good visuals for direct to video. Heck, for direct to video, they're SHOCKINGLY good visuals, and TinkerBell herself is thankfully very true to her original design for the most part, though personality-wise, she seems far more even tempered here than she is in Disney's ""Peter Pan"", through most of which she was furiously jealous and even murderous at times. It IS a bit hard to imagine this newest incarnation of Tink, sassy as she sometimes is, trying to get Wendy killed repeatedly in a few year's time, but maybe in the coming films we'll see her character evolve in that direction. Ha, but it's very unlikely. Regardless, I really enjoyed this film and seeing a sweeter, more innocent and vulnerable, and yet believably Tink-ish Tink throughout it, and I greatly appreciated the character designs (I'm mainly a face guy, but what legs these fairies have!), even though Tink's star-voiced core group of friends could have used more character development. I also really appreciate the time, interest, and attention to detail in making this a quality film; it definitely shows. It really did turn out well and I can't wait to finally get the time to view my copy of its first sequel, ""TinkerBell and the Lost Treasure"". Incidentally, I even picked up a tree topper from the Disney Store of Tink in her birthday suit from the film (that sparkly white dress with her hair down and bare feet). It was too gorgeous to resist and will sit atop my Christmas tree every year from now on.

As for the Blu-Ray edition of ""TinkerBell"", of course it looks and sounds fantastic, but it has some nice extras as well. Sadly, no commentary, and annoyingly, none of the little promo shorts that ran on the Disney Channel of Tink and her friends performing daily chores, but it does include deleted scenes with optional filmmaker intros, a pretty fun Tinker Trainer game that can even be a bit tricky for younger players I'd think, a short live action film with the CGI fairies mixed in called ""Ever Wonder"", a TinkerBell and Queen Clarion hosted Guide to Pixie Hollow, a ""Creating Pixie Hollow"" behind the scenes feature on designing the fairies' world (that, yes, is located on Neverland, in case you were wondering), and of course, your standard Disney Channel Star music video. This time, the video features Selena Gomez singing a song from the film called ""Fly to Your Heart"".  Now, I generally adore Selena Gomez, so the music video is a happy inclusion this time, but I confess I don't love it. I normally like her singing, but there's something about the way Selena sings a line or two in this song I just don't like, and she sounds a bit too much like Demi Lovato here, whom I really don't care for. The way they have her floating about (painfully obvious wire work) here is something else I don't love about the video. Oh well, I still appreciate all the extras; a much better and better quality collection than many Disney releases get. So, overall, I gotta say, GET THIS MOVIE! Especially if you love Tink... or are IN LOVE with Tink, like me. But don't think that swayed me all THAT much. It really is very good!",1279065600,,6619,4.522537562604341

3243794,4,B000XUOIQY,"Where as most Disney's direct-to-video followups to their feature films are rarely treated with any real care, this prequal to the original Peter Pan animated movie was actually pretty good. Tinker Bell was first put together mainly as a vehicle for the Disney Fairies product line which includes Tink and several other original fairy characters. This was mostly a response to several other shows that were out at the time like Winx Club and W.I.T.C.H. which featured teenage girls who transformed into fairies(which on their own were semi-ripoffs of Sailor Moon). It's a step up from the other Disney movie prequals/midquals/sequals to as it was the first one to be done in digital 3D.

This is essentially Tink's origin story. She is ""born"" from the laugh of a baby and first appears in the fairy home of Pixie Hollow which is part of Neverland. She is greeted by the other fairies, and learns that every one of them has a specific talent that is categorized into different types(water, animal, light, etc.). Tinker Bell is classified as a tinker fairy whose job it is to create and fix tools for the other fairies. At first she doesn't seem to mind it, but after meeting the spiteful garden fairy Vidia, she is told that tinkers aren't allowed to go to the mainland as only the nature fairies are sent to prepare the rest of the world for each season. Determined to prove that she's more than just a tinker, she tries to learn the nature magic skills from some of the other fairies. She fortunately has gained many quick friends, each one with their own type of power, but unfortunately its a power each one is born with and can't be learned. While begging Vidia for trying to learn her skill, she cons Tink into collecting runaway thistles, which end up wrecking most of Pixie Hollow and the fairies' plans for the changing of winter to spring. Mulling over the mistakes she's made, Tink uses her tinker skills to quickly craft some tools that will help repair all the damage she caused, which also increases the production of the fairies' season changing. Tink is then allowed to go to London with the rest of the fairies acting as a finder of lost treasures for humans, where she delivers a music box she fixed to a certain young girl(that she tries to have killed at least twice later on!).

I have to say I was pleasantly suprised by this when I caught on in TV. The story was good, and even though it was intended for younger girls, it wasn't done with a bunch of fairies singing ridiculous songs every five minutes, and going on about chocolate and boys. It also isn't some sappy romance where Tink is trying to find her token ""Prince Charming"" like other Disney heroines, although she does develop a small friendship with one of the boy fairies that's covered more in the sequal, Tinker Bell And The Lost Treasure. The only problem I felt was I don't see where Tink goes from being only slightly agitated from time-to-time, to being the full blown vidictively jealous boy-stalker that we see in Peter Pan. No mention of Pan or Capt. Hook is mentioned in this, but there are at least three more sequals being planned, all of which supposedly take place before Peter Pan. The computer animation in this is also exceptional, considering its not done by Pixar. The vocal cast is pretty impessive too with Anjelica Houston, Raven-Simone, America Ferrera, and Lucy Liu doing most of the fairy regulars, and Mae Whitman is suprisingly good as Tink considering this is the first time she ever talks in a movie. Your daughters or nieces should enjoy this as a nice gift, and worth watching on your own if you're a regular Disneyphile.",1262476800,,3636,4.661993769470405
3243795,5,B000XUOIQY,"This movie was a great hit in our family. My 5-year-old daughter was especially absorbed by it. Even my 12-year-old daughter liked it. It was on while I was fixing dinner, etc. but I couldn't keep my eyes off it myself. The graphics were so outstanding. Sure, the story line is more fit for kids but the movie was appealing for adults as well. It has some great lessons imbedded in it: like who you are, find your own talents, be a group player, and so on. I highly recommend it.",1262044800,,479,4.274725274725275
3243796,5,B000XUOIQY,"My 2 year old girl loves Tinkerbell.  After being scared to death by ""Peter Pan"" at first, she really took a liking to Tinkerbell later on.  So, we thought she would enjoy this movie.  She really did, and to my surprise, my wife and I did as well.  The story and execution are on a level that will keep adults engaged, as in all the best Disney outings.  Technically, ""Tinkerbell"" is a very well done movie, with smooth animation and creative artwork, and top-notch voice talent.  Kristin Chenoweth is always good, and ""Tinkerbell"" is no exception.  The story is also a great one for little girls, with the theme that you should follow your special talent and do what you like and are good at, no matter what other people might think.  And, as an engineer myself, I like the fact that ""Tinkerbell"" informs us that Tinkerbell is an engineer, and she's good at it.  Not every girl will grow up to be an engineer or scientist, but it's good to make sure they know that it's OK to do that if they want.  Tinkerbell is a good sci/tech role model for little girls, as she singlehandedly uses her advanced engineering skills to save the day.  And that is a sentence I never thought I would ever write!

This is a slam-dunk no-brainer buy for any girls 2-8, and probably even a little older.",1261958400,,1283,4.435897435897436

She may seem a bit young for this, but my 2-year old son & nephew (much to their fathers' chagrin) both love this toy at Grandma's house. I think because of all of the colors, and the fact that they can empty and refill the large teapot with all of the pieces.  They love to organize:)  This teapot has an adorable sparkly lid and each piece has great detail that differentiate this tea set from the other disney tea sets I've seen.  Only complaint is that some of the stickers appeared to be peeling off of the pieces (but this is likely due to the cold weather conditions it was shipped in).

Since then, it's hard to believe it took THIS LONG for Disney to develop a strong, admirable female lead for their animation franchise. When our family first watched this film, I thought it was a little cheesy, but, by the second viewing, really loved the film. The writers don't dumb things down for their audience, which I appreciate (my girls know what ""elucidate"" means because of this movie!) and the overall theme is really wonderful for girls of any age, but especially preschoolers. Tinker Bell is hardworking, creative, strong-willed, and a true inventor. There's a brief lovey moment with a boy fairy, Terrance, but this is a girl-centric Disney movie with NO ROMANCE! It is fantastic! There's no prince to rescue her, no damsel-in-distress scenario here -- Tinker Bell can figure things out for herself, and, happily, does.",1257206400,2,935,5.038709677419355

What really set this apart from most of the DVD fare is the incredible score, with music from Loreena McKennit! I could really relate to Tink's desire to find who she is and why. I looked everywhere for MY Talent, and it's taken a long time for me to really be happy with myself just the way I am. That's one of the most important and easily forgotten things you can learn in your life, and I'm glad to see that in any movie...

My wife was a litte aprehensive because they have reinvented Tinkerbell into a new character but she ended up loving the movie.  I have watched it several times and while is certainly girly, it is quite enjoyable and I am even looking fwd to the conection to Peter Pan.

3243837,5,B000XUOIQY,"My daughter loves this movie. She can't enough! She's watched it probably 2 dozen times since we got it a month ago. I love the research and fairy lore as well as the fact that Tinkerbell is smart, stubborn, sweet and sassy. It's also very cool that her friends are of different ethnicities as well as ""talents."" The message of the film is beautiful and very modern, encouraging young girls to follow their heart and showing them that they can be pretty, smart and useful. The world they live in is a matriarchy with Queen Clarion as their ruler. I love that Disney has made a very moving and empowering feature for young girls that is so feminine yet encourages them to be more than just princesses to be saved by dashing princes. Excellent film. I wish there were a thousand more of these. It is also nice that the film has drama without being dark like many of the other Disney movies so young kids can enjoy this without getting scared. It's by far my favorite Disney film as well. I'd give it 10 stars if that were possible.",1248998400,,1029,4.421052631578948
3243838,5,B000XUOIQY,"Yes, in this movie Tinkerbell is little like her original 1950s personality.  But, the modification was kind of necessary in order to make a movie with her being the central character rather than a spunky sidekick.  Of course they are going to update Tink to a kinder version, as parents typically prefer their kids look up to characters with positive attributes, rather than brats who are jealous, spiteful, and act viciously.  (In Peter Pan, Tink tries to kill Wendy).

So, if you can get passed the changes to Tink's character, you can see this is really an excellent movie.  Here's why.  The fairies at Pixie Hollow are all about being who they are, embracing their special talents and helping others.  The female characters don't aspire to be beautiful and ultra-cool, they aspire to work together to create spring and be the best they can be at their talents (even the ""villain"" fairy).  My 4-year-old has gotten this message!  This movie introduced her to the concept of finding your talent and has decided that art is hers.  After watching this movie, she goes into an artwork frenzy, expressing her talent through drawing, coloring, and/or painting.  Hey, that's awesome!  Loreena McKennitt's songs are wonderful too.  We end up singing along.  My two-year-old can belt out the ""Fly to Who You Are"" song.  Maybe that's her talent? ; )",1248480000,,1343,4.880530973451328

It's not scary (it's amazing how many movies for her age group are), it's nice to look at, the sound levels are normal, and she enjoys watching it over and over.  Although I've found that it holds the attention of kids of all ages, (and I like it myself) I would recommend it highly for anyone looking for a dvd for young preschoolers that may be frightened by some of the 'scarier' scenes in other animated movies.",1247184000,,592,4.212389380530974

If you were merely disappointed at the lack of artistry in today's ""physics-based"" 3d animation, it would be another. If stripping out the best of western lit's essential messages is somewhat troublesome, it would be another. But pitching the classics as teenage mall characters with sexy clothes that would never be permitted in a high school is a part of the sorry ruination of culture and morality that truly illustrates the central mission of this greedy corporation.

In this film, Disney capitalizes on her popularity with a sharp and entertaining feature that is sure to delight young and old.  I admit that I was skeptical, but the brilliant CGI details of this movie and the likable characters held my interest.  One thing of note, Tinkerbell speaks in this movie, whereas her film appearances prior were signaled by trademark chiming bells.  So, it was a slight jump to accept that she talks.

It has a plot, equality in gender of roles for the most part, but focuses on the efforts of a girl child (Tinker Bell) to solve a problem she sees in life.  It is about accepting who you are, and finding a way to excell at that, not changing to become what is seen as 'glamorous'.  And, to my surprise, Tinker isn't the one who is in charge of the sparking sand stuff.  Even my 15 year old son enjoyed it enough to watch and say, hey, that was pretty good.

I'm 16, and yes, I do watch little-kid movies.  When I first heard of this film, I was like, ""What??""  But for some reason, I checked it out of the library and actually really enjoyed it.  I can definitely see kids (both boys and girls) loving it and enjoying it for years to come.  You parents might not mind popping it into the TV and watching it over and over. ;)  The story is moral and there is nothing objectionable in it for kids.  The basic theme deals with using your talents and being content with the talents you have, as well as putting them to good use.

The only sad thing is how this film really does stray from...well, from Neverland.  From the place and boy (Peter Pan) that we all loved.  Or even dare I say, from the fairy we all loved.  The Tink in this film isn't really what Tink is like in Peter Pan.  She's much kinder here and less sassy.  So don't start this movie thinking that it is just a more in-depth look at Tinkerbell's life.

I just want to say that I am a nearly 58-year-old married man with no kids but I really, really enjoyed this DVD! I am a serious DVD collector with 2,000 DVDs. I have an animated section in my collection and ""Tinker Bell"" will now be one of the top picks in that section.
The color, the graphics are simply dazzling! I cannot even watch the old Disney classics anymore because they look so stone age compared to the animated DVDs that are being put out now. In fact I have traded all the old Disney DVD classics like ""Snow White"", ""Bambi"" because they look so ancient.
We watched ""Tinker Bell"" on our Sony 55-inch LCD TV last night and the colors are so rich and vibrant! I must mention that I also have a Sony upconvert DVD player as well that I use. It has made all the difference in the world. I do not have a Blu-Ray player yet because they are over-priced and they have their problems still.
But treat yourself by getting this DVD and be sure that you have an upconvert DVD player (they sell for about $75 or so at Wal-Mart). They play the regular DVDs at a higher quality level (not quite Blu-Ray) but it still looks nice! This is sure to be a true Disney Classic!",1235952000,,1255,4.211618257261411

Then i got it for my sister, the film has a very nice origin story, with some morals on the way. The animation somehow is much better than your regular straight to video Disney feature and you can feel the ""Lassetter"" touch here and there. I'm looking forward for the next chapters, and see how they will develop the story and the characters.",1234396800,,463,4.043478260869565

3243905,4,B000XUOIQY,"Tinker Bell is a great preschool age DVD!  The movie delivers the whole ""be proud of yourself"" message very nicely.  Visuals are excellent, music is appropriate.  The humor is gentle and fun.  The worst thing that happens is hurt feelings and some vandalism - nothing gross or scary.

Overall the plot is very light and fluffy, but that's great for my 2 year old.  Most Disney movies are far too complex for her.  Tinker Bell is right up her alley!",1233792000,,448,4.525

The magic of Tinkerbell, the charming fairy as we know her from Peter Pan, some how doesn't emerge in this sequal. This is a sweet animation and it pulls at your heart strings, but something is missing in making this a great Disney film. It's nice to have for the kiddies and worth seeing once. Looks awesome on Blue Ray. Younger audiences will enjoy the visuals.",1233705600,,486,4.534090909090909

The story kind of wanders a bit, but the moral is good - so I had no problem letting my kid watch it. But as far as anything for the adults to enjoy, you have to go into it knowing it's going to be a long hour and a half.

I think this is the beginning of a series - so I hope the rest are a little better in the story department.",1233360000,,476,3.6116504854368934

3243909,5,B000XUOIQY,"I thought this was a great movie for a younger child or even a slightly older child and especially for girls.  All the older type disney movies seem to play on the helpless pricnesses being dependent on a prince or some other male figure, or someone's parent has to die, or there needs to be some wicked scary evil individual.  There is no love story to this, no one has to die and no scary monster.  This a fun light hearted movie with a free thinking fairy who finds herself.  I assure both parents and kids will enjoy this incredible animation.  Buy it!",1233014400,2,556,4.359223300970874

I was chronically late for scout meetings because I had to see the opening scene from Disney's Wonderful World of Color which featured the Tinkster making magical fireworks.

In this movie, I was once again charmed by the character.

I finally sat down & watched it with her, and I have to say that 2nd to Cinderella this has to be the best Disney movie I've ever  seen for little girls.  Even for an adult, it was fun to watch and the message is wonderful -- be who you are.  There are no scary parts or inapproprite things like so many other movies supposedly for little kids (we have yet to make it through any other Disney kids movie besides Cinderella  because of a major scary element, such as the sea witch in LIttle Mermaid, Malificent in Sleeping Beauty, the witch in Snow White, the Beast in Beauty & the Beast).  I hope Disney makes other movies to follow up on this, drawing on the great Disney Fairy books (also big faves in our house, including the audio books which are fantastic).  I would give this 10 stars if I could.  Get it!",1231459200,,896,4.229411764705882

3243940,4,B000XUOIQY,"I was lucky that I could see ""Tinker Bell"" in Japan, where it was theatrically releases in December, 2008. As many reviewers have rightly pointed out, the crisp images of the CGI-created animation is simply gorgeous and they are very beautiful even on the big screen. Executive-produced by John Lasseter, ""Tinker Bell"" is not a so-called ""cheapquel"" or a cheaply made sequel (with 2 or 3 in the title) Disney was once notorious for.

The story is mostly set in Pixie Hollow, where newly-born Tinker Bell (voice by Mae Whitman) learns a lesson through works, friendship and adventures. Not content with her role in the community as a ""tinker,"" she tries to prove that she can do what other fairies do. Most of the fairies are helpful--except one. But in spite of their kindly helps and Tinker Bell's best intentions, things always end up badly until she finally realizes her talent.

I admit the story is slim and predictable. You have delightful supporting characters and the film's stunning visuals greatly help enrich them, but you might feel that the story is too short for them to fully develop. Fortunately it is reported that ""Tinker Bell"" is the first installment of the series of four films. Hope that we will meet them again in the next project soon.",1231372800,,1259,4.797235023041475

They are fond of repetition in most things. They are comfortable and feel safe with things they come to know, such as foods, routines and watching familiar tv shows and movies.
This film works as a teaching tool as well and helps her learn social skills and correct behaviors in given situations. She's loved the Peter Pan movies since she was very small. This is like a continuation of those films to her.",1231286400,,566,4.504854368932039

3243980,5,B000XUOIQY,"The IinkerBell movie is of movie theater caliber and I think they easily could have released this to the theater.  The only thing I can think of, is that they felt it was too gender skewed to girls to put in the theater.  However, to me, it's easily good enough.  This isn't a direct to DVD knockoff prequel or sequel that tries to borrow on the charm of the original movie but doesn't deliver in terms of story quality, music, animation quality.  Instead, it's very cute and very well done both in terms of story & animation & soundtrack.  The message is about embracing the talents that you have... and that you may not have all the same talents as everyone else.  This is a message I think is great for kids -- a lot of times I think kids feel pressure that they have to be good at everything.  As a parent, I enjoyed the movie and my 5 year old daughter really is enjoying it and is watching it for the 3rd time already -- it was a Christmas gift to her just last week.",1230940800,,973,4.171122994652406

But, it really is about Tinkerbell's life beginning and the conflict she has with being a Tinker fairy.  The animation was great, story line was ok, and the score to the movie was horrible.

My Husband and I came up with scenarios (I use his account) 1. Tink loses her voice eventually when She meets Peter 2. A Fairies voice is so tiny that to humans it hears like bells. I know they are making more than one movie-but why? unless they plan on showing how she finds Peter as a baby and takes him to Neverland. Wendy was also in the movie at the end (thats who the music box belongs to) Tink doesn't like Wendy... I dunno, it just seems sorta off.

I was pleasantly surprised that this movie not only told the wonderful story about the origin of Tinker Bell, but it also taught a valuable lesson in being proud of who you are (because we sometimes wish we were like someone else).  The meaning of this would go over the heads of younger children, but it's perfect timing for my 4 year old who is more aware of the differences between herself and her friends.  This helps me reinforce that it's GOOD to be different!

So I get myself a `God child' -Baby L-who happens to be of the age where she'd enjoy this kind of movie and what the hell? Someone took the `bad girl' out of Tinkerbell! Who is this perfect little angel type thing because she sure ain't the nasty little Stinkerbell that collaborated against Wendy and caused a whole ton of trouble for Peter Pan in the original story. I used to love Tink, even considered having her in Ink but not this version, no way. What happened to the naughty, devious, mischievous, conniving sprite I knew and loved as a child. Glad we got this on PPV because I would NEVER (see all caps?) buy this for Baby L, no way. Don't mess with the classics, Disney, you don't have to sanitize everything and make it PC- there's room for the imperfect. I say God bless the flawed, no one is perfect.

We were disappointed by its message, which we'd translate to ""embrace your lot in life"", and don't think it's really what we'd want an assertive 21st Century woman to be trained in. That said, she loves it, of course, and it hasn't slowed the onslaught of Fairie gear in our house.

Having been a fan of Tink since I was a child in the 60's it does not do the forever young fairy justice.  It's too 21'st century teenage crap, should have stayed true to fairydom and not put the human teen twist into it. The illustration is nice and well done, but not to the true likeness of Tinker Bell.

The story line is really cute and the animation is great. I mean, it's not Pixar quality, but very good.  There are some famous voice talents from people such as Anjelica Huston, Raven Simone, and Lucy Lu. I really enjoyed watching this with my daughter and ended buying copies for my nieces as well.
A note: Tinkerbell's attitude has been altered from her Peter Pan debut.  If I remember correctly she was kind of b**chy in that movie but in her own feature film she's much more lovable.

3244041,1,B000XUOIQY,"Physically, Tinkerbell looks like the fairy you knew and loved from Disney's Peter Pan.  Other than that, she does not resemble Tinkerbell one bit.  Tinkerbell was a sassy free spirit with attitude and was a loyal friend to her beloved Peter Pan.  A bit vain, selfish, but also mixed with a lot of good.  Though a Disney fairy, those characteristics made her almost human.

This movie takes her image and creates a whole new character for the sake of marketing.  They created new fairies for this movie, why not just make one of them the main character.  Why did they have to destroy the Tinkerbell we grew up with.

Yes, little girls, and even some little boys will love this movie because of the images.  Yet they would of loved it just the same if Disney had made a new fairy.  They have plenty of them, what's one more?  The smarter kids will ask, why is Tink nicer in this movie?  Why can she talk?  Why didn't she tinker in Peter Pan?  Maybe these answers will be answered in one of the future releases of this new series of DVDs.

and was not dissapointed at all with the rendering (tho as some have noted...sorta 'robotic'...but then the human form is the most difficult to animate believably....)

but most surprising of all is...i looooved this movie!

the voice work was spot-on. the story was very full in the neverland universe...tink is still a lovely creature to behold (better in '3d')

and most of all this movie MOVED me...i actually laughed out loud at some of the goings on...and was moved to tears towards the end...

if the next 'tink' movies in this series are as good as this i will be very happy!

not only more chances to see my lil tink rendered lovingly in glorious CG...but more chances to be moved by a lil film that i never saw comin....

Having a child makes you really rediscover and appreciate the wonder and magic of Disney and this movie is no exception. We watch it several times a week and I have yet to tire of it.  It is a wonderful message for little girls, as opposed to the shameless incessant marketing of the Disney Princesses (when did they take ownership of all fairytales?).  Tinkerbell is a working woman with big aspirations that are only realized when she is true to herself.  The movie has very few scary scenes - nothing near as frightening as Ursula from Little Mermaid, or Cruella De Ville, or the death of Mufasa in the Lion King, so okay for even the youngest preschoolers.

3244052,1,B000XUOIQY,"first off, this movie had the potential to be interesting and magical and exciting. the elements for what could have made this movie great were there somewhere, they just weren't touched upon. this turned out to be a movie about 'everyone's an individual, just like you' and near the end when i discovered that this was the only moral i felt really disappointed. it's just one of those movies that will leave no mark on you, washboard quality. if you've ever seen the sequel to snow white, the cartoon version, i forget what it's called because yes it was just that bad, it is reminiscent of that.

now this would all have been fine and dandy if it was just another movie to sucker people out of 30 bucks or however much it costs... but it is a story about tinkerbell... from peter pan. it almost seriously offended me that anyone would stray so far from a wonderful, classic story like that and steal one of it's signature characters and turn it into this. such a bastardization of arguably one of the most memorable characters in children's classical literature... some one should be slapped, really hard. it offended me enough to go out and write this review, which probably isn't even that articulate because my mind is still boggled by the fact that these greedy, money sucking... people at disney wouldn't just create some other nameless character, not drag a classic one through the dirt. .. of course i doubt anyone would buy that nameless character because of late their story writing ability is far from decent... as this little jem proves.",1228176000,8,1550,4.698529411764706

There are memorable moments as well:  Tink gently convincing a mouse that together they can accomplish a monumental task; the coming of Spring to London, courtesy of the fairies (some clever stuff here, and beautiful music as well); and my favorite, Tinker Bell trying to teach a baby bird to fly.

In this story, Tinkerbell is an inventor dissatisfied with her current position in Pixie Hollow with a penchants for going to the mainland, and unfortunately for making a mess of things (in a Bug's Life it was food for the Grasshoppers, in TinkerBell it is preparations for Spring).

The computer-generated animation is really very well done. I was impressed at the originality of the well-known voice actors for the nature fairies who befriend Tinker Bell. Yes, fairies talk (I guess it is so quiet we just can't hear). The movie flowed nicely with some very clever moments. Most importantly, my 4 year old adored it.

The tie-in to Peter Pan comes at the end of the movie, as an afterthought. Tinker Bell makes it to the mainland to return a toy, which coincidentally belongs to Wendy. It could be explained as to how Peter later comes to Wendy's window (with Tink?), but I personally felt like it fell flat in terms of being consistent with Peter Pan.

My little one loved this movie and has enjoyed going onto Disney's new Pixie Hollow website and being a fairy herself. It is surprisingly good for a direct-to-DVD movie (consistency issues aside).",1227571200,,1575,5.420408163265306

I bought this movie for my two parrots (very spoiled birds) because it was about fairies with wings and the trailers looked cute. I also bought it because I never got over my love of well done animated movies. I can always tell when the birds are interested because they find perches closest to the TV and spend time sitting and watching without wandering off. The cute voices of Anjelica Huston (Queen Clarion), Lucy Liu (Silvermist), America Ferrera (Fawn), Kristin Chenoweth (Rosetta), Kathy Najimy (Minister of Summer)and Jane Horrocks helped hold their interest and the music sound track was very good. They spent a lot of time watching this one and I enjoyed watching it with them the first time. I'm sure it would also be attractive to children.",1227312000,,1138,4.747474747474747

Let me tell you the movie TOTALLY gets my approval.  It is a great fun movie that shows conflict resolution as well as quite a few other very important ""life lessons"".  I.E. Identity.  The makers of this movie crafted it so well that the ""scary"" parts are not scary and trust me when i say my daughter can get scared easily sometimes.  Not only was this movie great for my daughter, I really think children of ALL ages will gain different learning perspectives based on their learning curve.

3244087,5,B000XUOIQY,"I just watched the new TINKER BELL movie with my family, and I must say that we are all enormously enchanted.  Do you know how fairies are born?  (Do you remember from Peter Pan?) Do you know how and why our special friend is named Tinker Bell?  Do you know where Tinker Bell got her signature green dress?  All of these questions, and more, are very satisfyingly and entertainingly answered in Disney's new animated film, which, IMHO, is destined to become a classic.  This is by far one of the best films, animated or not, to come out of the Disney Studios in a long time.

In TINKER BELL, a new fairy is born and has to find her way in Neverland (although it is never called Neverland, it MUST be...the movie makes it clear that the fairies live ""second star to the right and straight on `til morning..."").  Along the way she makes new friends, many mistakes, and discovers who she is.  TINKER BELL has a clear and important message for all children, and adults, everywhere:  be happy with who you are; each one of us is special and unique, and that is a very wonderful thing.  TINKER BELL ignites the imagination, and leaves you full joy and happiness.

The animation is breathtakingly lovely. The colors are rich and brilliant, the action smooth and pure, and the characterizations are charming.  You can easily fall in love with every one of the characters.  The voice talent was cherry-picked from some of the best.  Mae Whitman, who voices Katara in the AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER series, is a perfect choice for Tink.  Sweet and ingenuous, she is conveys Tinker Bell exactly as you imagine.  The talents of Kristin Chenoweth, America Ferrera, Lucy Liu, Anjelica Huston, Kathy Najimy, Raven-Symone, and a host of others add to the delight of this film.  As an added bonus, there was nothing scary in TINKER BELL; nothing to frighten or upset children.  No one dies; no one is particularly evil.  A little self-centered, yes, but that is the worst of it.  This is quite simply a sweet, charming, enchanting tale that will please children of all ages for many years to come.

The ending made both my husband and me ""laugh-cry"" with delight.  (You know what I mean, the tears were flowing, but we were laughing with glee at the same time.)  At the end of the movie, Tinker Bell returns a very special object (that you just might recognize) that plays a very special song to a very special child.  It made me very happy, gooey, and sentimental, and that is a wondrous thing.  I am going to have this smile on my face for many days to come.

3244092,5,B000XUOIQY,"My daughter received the new Tinkerbell DVD from her Grammy for her third birthday this weekend.  She was already a Tinkerbell fan, and I her rather grudging dealer of Tinkerbell paraphanalia.  I knew she'd love this movie, but I had my doubts; after all, the Tinkerbell I knew from Peter Pan was pretty headstrong, shallow, selfish, and even impulsively murderous.  (Not exactly my favorite role model for my little girl.)

However, this re-created Tinkerbell is much more appropriate-- to my delight!  It's definitely a movie for children (ie girls), not for the adults-- but there's nothing violently scary, and plenty to love about what they might absorb by watching:

You don't have to be the ""star"" to be vital and important.
Value does not lie in glamourous appearance or work.
There is happiness in being who you really are and not trying to imitate others.
There can be forgiveness from your authorities if you make a big mistake.
Helping others succeed is joyful and meaningful work.
Recycling and reusing is a virtue.
Always try to fix what you've screwed up.

...and probably more, but those are my favorites.  All in all, I'm delighted.  Hooray for the new Tinkerbell, who has a job other than flitting around trying to off Wendy and keep Peter all to herself.",1226448000,4,1273,4.856481481481482

I bought this movie for my friend's daughter and watched it and was just thrilled at the animation, the story (great lesson) and how sweet but not overly sweet it was.

3244094,4,B000XUOIQY,"This 78-minute production featuring the little pixie from Peter Pan tells the story of how TinkerBell came to be. See, in the land of Pixie Hollow, the community of fairies are divided up by their specialty. There are tinkerer fairies, water fairies, garden fairies and light-talent fairies. Some even control each of the seasons. When Tink arrives, she is thrust into a job she doesn't want. So, when she tries her hand at other jobs, the result is quite disastrous. In true Disney fashion, she has to embrace that destiny. She does but not without learning a lesson first. This Disney Fairies Franchise film stars: Mae Whitman, Raven Symone, America Ferrara, Lucy Liu, Kristin Chenowith, Anjelica Huston, Pamela Adlon, Kathy Najimy, Jesse McCartney, Jeff Bennett, and Loreena McKennitt. The film lays the groundwork for the next film in the series, ""Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure"" which is planned to come out in Fall of 2009 and two more features, ""Tinker Bell: A Midsummer Storm"" & ""Tinker Bell: A Winter Story""(Both coming out in the summers of 2010/2011).

I hate to admit it but I, too,  was dreading watching this movie. Until recently, Disney hasn't had much of a track record with direct-to-DVD releases. Some have been downright awful.  The only reason I bought this movie to begin with was the fact that John Lasseter was involved with the project. If any of you out there are into CGI films as much as I am, you'll know that John Lasseter was involved in the making of such films as ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"", ""Toy Story"", ""A Bug's Life"", ""Toy Story 2"", ""Monster's Inc."", ""The Incredibles"", ""Cars"" & ""Wall-E"". He's also involved with ""Toy Story 3"", and ""Cars 2"" which are coming in 2010 and 2012. I'm glad to say that, due to his involvement, ""TinkerBell"" is right up there with the aforementioned movies that are out. ""TinkerBell"" is a movie the whole family will love.

I didn't think I'd like it. I thought it'd be directed too much towards kids but it isn't. I loved it as much as my Grandson did.",1226275200,3,2019,4.743589743589744
3244095,5,B000XUOIQY,"I'm not particularly a fan of cartoon movies, but when Tinkerbell was released, I decided to sit down and watch it with my daughter and son. I'm so glad I did!

Tinkerbell is by far one of the best movies by Disney. Finally, Disney made a movie with a really important theme and message: Everyone is special and unique; there is nobody who can do what you do, like you do it. I walked away after watching Tinkerbell, feeling better about myself (and I'm 32 years old!). If I felt that way, then I know both my kids did as well.

This movie has a great message that every child can benefit from. I especially recommend every mother watch this with your daughter(s). Even my 5-year old son enjoyed it and watched it 3 more times the first day after we watched it together!

BRIEF SYNOPSIS OF MOVIE: Tinkerbell wants to be just like all the other dust fairies. She watches them bringing beautiful things to life and she wants to be just like them. But Tinkerbell is a tinker fairy, so when she attempts to bring spring things to life like all the others, she ends up creating mass chaos instead. Because of her wanting so badly to be like all the other fairies, she destroys all the hard work everyone else has been doing to bring spring to the Mainland.

Tinkerbell finally has an ""AHA!"" moment, when she understands that even though she isn't like all the others, her unique talent (fixer-upper) is exactly what is needed if the fairies can save spring. She quickly puts a plan into action, gathering all sorts of ""stuff"" and tinkers her way into creating tools all the fairies can use to save spring.",1226275200,8,1600,4.469178082191781
3244096,5,B000XUOIQY,"I was dreading watching this with my[...]... some of the Disney straight to video DVDs are downright awful. This was a pleasant surprise.  I loved the animation, the colors and, for all you princesses - all the sparkle.  This straight to DVD is nearly worthy of Cars and the Incredibles - my two favorite Pixar movies - high praise indeed.

The message was great, too - be proud of who you are.  Each fairy has a special talent.  Tinker Bell's is, well, to tinker, build and fix things, which she finds boring compared to the nature fairies who paint flowers, capture rainbows and make dew drops on spiderwebs. She tries to become a nature fairy and fails only to almost ruins Spring.  Using her given talent, she is able to save Spring with the help of friends.

I would recommend this for children up to age 5, girls of all ages and adults that love the Disney/Pixar magic.  This in now one of my favorites!",1226188800,3,909,4.466666666666667
3244097,3,B000XUOIQY,"This movie is enjoyable, truly every child can watch this without feeling fear or exposed to something too grown up. Suprising what they put in some ""kid"" movies. However, my family has been a huge fan of the Pixie Hollow books. We especially love the ones written by Gail Carson Levine (Quest for the Egg). I don't have those in front of me to double-check spelling. With a huge production of books on Tinkerbell.. I thought were a lead to the movie, I was disappointed. Disney produced (ie handstamped) the series as they did the movie. So I was suprised by the number of times it strayed in many key points with the book. For examples, Disney faries never say goodbye, they say ""fly with you"". The books made a big point about this.. so it jolted me out of my fantasy within the movie to hear the difference. I see they are re-inventing her and kudos for that, I believe Tink has much to offer. They created a strong, realistic female charactor..  I would have liked to seen her co-workers not so annoying as goofballs.

I enjoyed the music, Raven's voice is always a delight. The reading by Mae Whitman was done very well.

Overall there was a bit of a flat feeling with the movie, I look forward to what they do with the next ones they release. I bought it, I liked it but I advise my friends to borrow it from me and not waste their money. This isn't one you will watch 3 months from now, the ""new magic"" fades fast.",1226188800,5,1422,4.338345864661654

The first of 4 Tinker Bell stories to be released for the next 3 years. (Trailer for the 2009's adventure included in this DVD;""TINKER BELL and the LOST TREASURE"")

This Tinker Bell movie is only the beginning of the ""DISNEY FAIRIES"" phenomenon to include the virtual world of TINKER BELL (PIXIEHOLLOW.COM) including Toy Clickables (having a USB linkable feature to this virtual chat room and creating your own fairy in the world of PIXIE HOLLOW) Friendship bracelets, charms, dolls, books about the individual fairies  and lots more.

PIXAR's John Lasseter is this projects Executive Producer and it is obvious from the opening scenes that PIXAR QUALITY anination is present.  Even though this TINKER BELL movie is DVD released exclusively it has the FULL BIG SCREEN HD PRESENTATION.  PIXAR & WALT DISNEY ANIMATION STUDIOS spared no expense.  This is first quality CLASSIC Disney signature production.  Disney has even started a ""DISNEY TOON STUDIOS"" to showcase these grand movies plus the ""DISNEY FAIRIES and PIXIE HOLLOW"" web sites !!!!  So you see this phenomenon is here to stay!!!

Back to TINKER BELL the movie.  This is total eye candy and a fantastic story from Tinker Bell's beginning in Neverland at Pixie Hollow to her encounter with Wendy Darling in the MainLand. (Many of the questions about Tinker Bell, Pixie Dust, Fairies and Neverland are answered) The voice (a Tinker Bell first) is perfectly matched to her personally and the supporting character voice overs are first rate, to include Angelica Huston and Lucy Lui.  The Sound Track is absolutely perfect to the storyline.  (Disney has a Tinker Bell Sound Track CD also)

I have a Blu-ray HD Home Theater with a 108"" wall Screen and believe me this movie is a 5 STAR must have for your family Disney DVD Library.  You'll watch this movie many times.

Note: this story is primarily aimed at little girls from 5 to 12 but the story has family appeal and a great time in NEVERLAND.  Also there are male fairies called SPARROW MEN. Tinker Bell has 3 who help her, Bobble, Clank and Terence.

THE DVD FEATURES are alot of fun too!!!!  From TINKER TRAINING honing your tinker skills, a magical guide around Pixie Hollow, Ever Wonder?, this answers those questions, lots of background information about CREATING PIXIE HOLLOW and a music video performed by Selena Gomez, plus deleted scenes.

3244105,5,B000XUOIQY,"DVD Review: TINKER BELL
It would be very easy for traditional Disney fans to dismiss a direct-to-video, CG-animated feature in which the iconic Disney character talks. As a matter of fact, it's been dismissed months before the film came out in some circles. Come to think of it, there were probably many traditional champions of the original James Barrie Peter Pan play that had a problem with Walt Disney's vision of the fairy (I recall one snarky critic referring to her as being ""too long at the sugar bowls."" Reee-err!

Put that all aside, watch this Tinker Bell feature, and you may be pleasantly surprised. First of all, the art direction is so strong the entire feature really should have been released in theaters. This was not a hastily-made, get the money and run movie slapped together by hacks, it was clearly inspired by people who loved the source material. (And according to some reports, it was a long and bumpy road getting the little sprite to the direct to DVD screen, with scripts and careers scattered along the way.)

The story is simple. We see how fairies are born -- when a baby first giggles -- and how Tink finds herself in the fairy pecking order. We meet her cohorts and of course, she learns a lesson. The sweetest moment comes at the end, when she brings the music box... no I won't spoil it, but it was nicely handled. The Peter Pan story lingers in the background with subtlety rather than it being reduced to the sitcom levels we might have seen in decades past.

Mae Whitman is a marvelous choice for Tinker Bell's voice, your garden variety Disney lady, and the cast is also well suited to their roles. It's especially nice to have Angelica Huston bring stately grace to the Fairy Queen. My wife was especially delighted to hear Loreena McKennit as the narrator and singer at the opening. The score, by the way, has a light Irish folk lilt that won't quickly date in the years to come.

I can appreciate the challenge of bringing such a beloved character into a new ""franchise"" and admire how satisfying it turned out -- and the next one looks promising too -- my kids can't wait.

The DVD release is not brimming with extras, making me wonder if a ""special edition"" looms ahead, but there is one short feature well worth mentioning. I don't know if it was made for the DVD or perhaps created as a ""sizzle piece"" to create the mood for the Disney Fairies marketing initiative. No matter why it was made, it was a gem in which children and adults find magic and wonder in little things like a rainbow in a lawn sprinkler or grass growing between sidewalks, as the fairies linger in the periphery.

To me that little film captures what I remember about being a kid. You can live in the suburbs, the city, the country, wherever, but kids can find wondrous things anywhere if their imaginations are cultivated. It's why, when kids are surrounded by their newly-opened presents, they often play with the big cardboard box they came in. I was happy to be reminded of that fact.",1225843200,7,3007,4.5799256505576205
3244106,5,B000XUOIQY,"Disney never often let's us down when they produce movies and they hold true to form with this release that is dedicated to Peter Pan's friend Tinker Bell even though it is a straight to DVD movie.

The animation is done very well and the picture quality is gorgeous.  The more I see animated movies the more impressed I become with how well things look.

The voices and music are extremely well done.

Overall a wonderful and cheery movie that both young and old can enjoy - my 3-1/2 year old has watched it 3 times since we got this and I am still enjoying it also.",1225756800,2,567,4.271028037383178
3244107,5,B000XUOIQY,"Much as I dislike the phrase ""feel good movie"" this is probably the way I would describe Tinker Bell.

I had my reservations simply because kids films these days seem to center around body humor(ie fart ""comedy""), kids that are smart mouthed knowit alls, falling down comedy, or smarmy awww situations.

Tinker Bell has none of that.

Born of the first laugh of a baby; we see a dandelion seed make it's way to Neverland.  Guided by a pixie; it lands in the great tree of Pixie Hollow and Tinker Bell appears.  One thing I thought was clever was the fact her dress still looked like a dandelion feather.  She is greeted by the other fairies and soon the queen appears to set her wings and see what skill she has to offer.  I liked the fact she picked things such as a little girl would choose.  Flower, dew drop, light and she ignores the hammer which in turn goes to her.  She is a tinker.  At first she thinks it's interesting but instead of the great beauty of the garden fairies, the light fairies or the water fairies, she finds it to be rather ""nurdy"" and can't accept it.  Why can't she be one of the other fairies?  Add to the fact Tinkers do not go to the mainland which she want's to see simply because of the lost stuff she finds.  Tink decides she doesn't want to be Tinker and wants to learn one of the other skills.  Everything just doesn't work.  In the end, she learns she is a tinker.

Many comments have said the plot is weak.  Some times you simply have to sit back and take in the story and be entertained versus look for some meaning in every shot.  This film is aimed at children and should be viewed as such; which if you are young at heart, it will be fun.

I found the characters to be engaging and fun in their own way.  The animators did a good job in giving Tink that childlike fascination with the unknown which most adults seem to loose.

The animators also stayed true to Pan especially when you see Neverland and when they eventually make it to London.  My daughter was excited to see a cameo by the young Wendy Darling.

The scenery was brilliant.  They really did a good job of creating a new world with the linking of nature to the magic of the fairy.  Each character is influenced by nature as you will see in the personalities, clothing, etc.

One scene I just can't help laughing is when Tink shoots a squirrel in the head with a nut.  He just looks, makes a sad face and walks away trying hard not to cry.  My daughter keeps getting mad every time I laugh.

This type of film can fall to ""smarmyness"" and such areas were adeptly handled as when Tink talks to the dust handler and he tricks her into realizing her job is important and she should be proud of it.

The music of the film has a Celtic style which just goes with the imagery.

I found the extras interesting.  Especially the making of piece and the tour of Pixie Hollow.  At first I thought they cut corners and you don't get a tour of all the areas of pixie hollow; then I remembered we didn't get heavily into the other areas so a discussion of the winter fairies would have been wasteful.

There are the usual deleted scenes.  Some were good to be cut, one was a nice looking scene but it really didn't have a place, another that should have been in the movie was Tink trying to be a Garden fairy.

Do watch the making of piece as it explains their process and I found it reminded me of what Disney did to make Bambi.  They made a real effort to be faithful to Pan and to interject nature and the artists wandered through nature looking for inspiration for ideas.  If you didn't pick up on it in the movie, it will be made clear.

Again, this was a fun film and it's the first of a series.  I was not interested at first but I am glad I did watch and am looking forward to the next installment.  I will add this movie interested my girl into wanting the books for the Disney Fairy series.  Anything that makes a child want to read is a mark of quality in itself.",1225670400,3,3965,4.218085106382978

3244109,3,B000XUOIQY,"Tinkerbell finally speaks!!! This should have been a big deal, but no. Does anyone but me remember that Tinkerbell never spoke before?

The visuals were pretty, but this film was a little too commercial for me. It reminded me of the $4 Hello Kitty video I found in a bargain bin at WalMart. Sole purpose -- sell fairy dolls, clothing, other licensed items. All these new characters that they can now sell to little girls. I know it's Disney's next big thing since they seem to think the Princesses are starting to run out of steam.

It was a little too sanitized for me. I guess I was hoping Captain Hook or Peter Pan would jump out of somewhere and capture Tink.

Continuity should count -- giving a young Wendy the music box messes up the time line for Peter Pan. Wendy's grandma -- maybe. But when do Peter Pan and the Lost Boys get lost?

There's a reason it didn't come out in theatres. Great for the four and younger group who get scared watching Beauty and the Beast.",1225670400,2,974,4.394444444444445

With this film, Disney is trying to bridge the gap between younger girls, who love the princess stories (""Cinderella,"" ""The Little Mermaid"", etc.) and older, 'tweener types who are now into edgier material, such as the Bratz and Hannah Montana franchises.  The group this movie is aimed at, five-to-eight year olds, have been tilting towards the teen-oriented material, and this is an effort to bring them back into a younger mindset.

It's a welcome effort, certainly for many parents who may feel their kids are ""growing up too quickly,"" exposed to sophisticated or violent material that isn't really appropriate to their age groups. ""Tinkerbell"" is a good option, one that both parents and kids will welcome: it's wholesome, formulaic, cloying at times, but generally enchanting and refreshingly nonviolent.

The story is simple... Tinkerbell the fairy is born out of a dandelion seed, and learns about her life in the bustling fairyland of Pixie Hollow (based on the extensive Pixie Hollow book series).  There are plenty of magic sparkles and dazzling magical lights, a full contingent of friends -- both a set of supportive gal pals and a couple of nice, nerdy guys that she works with in the tinker shop -- and a few benign but slightly intimidating authority figures (the tinker shop boss, the fairy queen and the duke in charge of the annual spring celebration).  There's only one ""bad guy,"" a mean girl who is jealous of Tinkerbell and tries to undercut her successes, but no real violence or menace -- no one gets hit, or shot or physically menaced, and the mean girl gets her comeuppance in the end.

The story revolves around Tinkerbell's efforts to fit in. She is klutzy and insecure, yet also rebellious because she doesn't accept her role as a tinker (mechanically-inclined fairies who fix things around Pixie Hollow) and she also doesn't accept the limited role that other fairies see for the tinker group. With her natural talents and undying optimism, Tinkerbell eventually wins over her critics -- and even her own self-doubt -- and manages to win the day.  Her problem-solving skills and positivity make her a welcome role model for little girls (and boys, too, if they're into fairy stories...) and bode well for a continuation of this new Disney franchise.

The 3D-ish CGI animation is reminiscent of the ""Shrek"" films, with a few extra sparkles and sequins thrown in for good luck... It's not quite as dazzling or satisfying as the hand-painted masterpieces of the Disney classics of the 1940s and '50s, but it's still pretty captivating.  And while the music is a bit more contemporary and pop than I'd like, it's okay.  Much of the score has a Celtic twist to it, in the pop crossover-y Mary Black/Capercaillie/Clannad style, and that may be of interest to families with folk music/Ren Fair leanings... Overall, it's a pretty nice film.  I'm glad we got it for our little girly-girl to enjoy.  (Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain children's media reviews)",1225670400,2,3013,4.97808764940239
3244112,5,B000XUOIQY,"I loved the animation,creativity, humor and voice work.  I have been worried that this would be a total flop, but I heard good things from my friend who bought it and sure enough.  . . it is great!  It's positive and fun to watch.  My 4 year old and 2 year old love it.  It's worth it, and I like the celtic music.",1225497600,,314,3.9206349206349205
3244113,5,B000XUOIQY,"This is a very cute movie all about the origins of Peter Pan's sidekick Tinkerbell, and the trials and tribulations she goes through in her quest for self-discovery. I showed this movie to the students in my classroom during our Halloween party, and they all loved it, even the boys! I loved it, too!

It's a very easy movie to fall in love with, really. Tinkerbell is such a sweet, kindhearted and determined character, it's hard to believe she's the same jealous, spiteful little witch who tried to kill Wendy in Peter Pan. Her gaggle of pixie girlfriends are all very cute and likable, and her nerdy guy friends are really funny. The storyline is typically Disney, all about loving and accepting yourself as you are. And just like a typical Disney flick, it brought a tear to my eye!

This is an adorable, enjoyable film, and extremely well-made considering it is a straight-to-dvd movie. (let's be honest folks, As good as Disney movies are, their straight-to-dvd selection is sorely lacking in the quality department.) And from what I understand, this film suffered a number of setbacks and the original script had to be scrapped as it was practically unwatchable. Well, they certainly came a long way! I'll definitely be picking up subsequent Tinkerbell films, much to the delight of my students.",1225497600,5,1302,4.86036036036036
3244114,5,B000XUOIQY,I was pleasantly surprised with this movie as it never went through the theatre and I tend to not favor Disney's movies that don't hit the theatre first as they seem to be much too corney and tasteless to me. But my daughter and I really thought this was a cute movie and I am really glad I bought it.,1225497600,,301,4.033333333333333

3244116,4,B000XUOIQY,"The Good:
I rather enjoyed the movie.  It was an interesting take on the character.  Seeing that the already have a sequel down the pipes makes me think this version of Tink is going to be around awhile.  I wouldn't doubt if they had plans for a regular tv series at one point.  The animation is crisp and clean.

The Bad:
I was kinda disappointed that they didn't include the shorts of the characters that they've been showing as filler on the Disney channel.  They made it seem like it was going to be.  The extras in general, aren't that great.  I would have liked to seen more behind the scenes things.

The Ugly:
The first DVD I bought, didn't work.  Put it in the player, and nothing it just seemed to stop competly.  Returned it, got another copy.  Got home, put this one in the player..had the same problem.  Started trying to figure out why...turned then player on and off, poped the disc in and out..finnaly got it to work.  The problem lies in some software at the front of the disc.  The first thing it does is ask you what language you want the disc in....combined with their Fast Play option, causes the thing to do nothing.  It gets confused.  I do hope Disney fixes this problem.",1225411200,2,1195,4.383561643835616
3244117,5,B000XUOIQY,My 4 yr old has been asking for this for months.  It gave her a constant fairie fix and she is thrilled with it.,1225411200,2,112,3.6666666666666665
3244118,3,B000XUOIQY,"First thing first the trailer is 80% false advertisement, meaning 80% of the trailer you see is no where in the actual Tinker Bell movie. The movie so fooled me according to the trailer.

Don't get me wrong the movie was good, my three year old watched it twice and leaves a good happy feeling.

But why the false advertising!!!??

Way to go Disney...setting the example of LYING!!!!",1225411200,2,383,4.602941176470588
3244119,5,B000XUOIQY,"Reasons the movie, Tinkerbell is enchanting, magical and sparkling:

1. The computer graphics are unlike anything I've ever seen before. They are clear, crisp, and the colors are so magical and vivid you feel as though you are there.

2. It is obvious that the creators of this movie had a tremendous respect for faerie-lore because it is NOT hokey or ""cheesy"" in any way. The realm of fairies is sacred to me and I was not insulted in the least.

3. Never a dull moment. There was always something magical happening on screen.

4. The imagination was ASTOUNDING. The creators of the show blew me away with their imaginative creations.

5. A lot of emotion and feeling behind the film, deep messages and meaning.

6. Many people might view this next point as a negative, but I do not: there were NO musical moments--no singing and no over-the-top cheesy, kiddie songs.

7. Speaking of music, the orchestral music played throughout the film was touching, soft and sparkly. It had a very Celtic vibe which fits into the genre of fairies. Hence, why I agree with #6. Musicals would not have suited the film. I believe that the creators made the correct musical decisions.

8. Children and adults are mesmerized by the film. This is not just a children's movie. My husband actually liked it as much as I did!

9. Character development was strong. All characters are likable. There are male characters who bring much humor to the film.

10. Very unique, atypical fairy story, very enchanting.",1225324800,6,1487,4.728682170542636
3244120,5,B000XUOIQY,"You see a lot of reviews saying how little kids will love this movie, well, I'm 43 and I don't have any kids, and I thought this was one of the best Disney videos I've seen in years.

Full of color and light and fun, an uplifting message, gorgeous animation, and a wonderfully imaginative take on the fairies' world, I enjoyed this movie so much I went to work the next day and told everyone about it.

If you want to recapture that feeling of innocence, joy, and imagination that you used to have as a kid watching the Wonderful World of Disney or seeing the Disney cartoon movies for the first time, this is the way to go. A sweet, charming, cheerful movie, with great characters that I'll be happy to see again. And I'll get to, since there are apparently a couple of sequels coming out. I sincerely hope they hold up to this standard.

By the way, I watched my copy in 3D with a pair of TV Eyes 3-D glasses I found online. This movie looks fantastic in 3D, almost like it was made for it! That may be responsible for part of my enthusiasm. I definitely suggest watching it in 3D if you have the chance. It's amazing.

I've noticed Disney has finally started to go back to it's roots, making more imaginative, wonderful, and heartwarming stories again (instead of just refilming old movies) if this video is an example of the way they're headed, then I'm back on the train for the ride. This may be about an old character, but it's a fresh new movie in it's own right. If I'd never heard of Tinker Bell I'd still think it was excellent entertainment.",1225324800,11,1553,4.344827586206897
3244121,5,B000XUOIQY,"J.M. Barrie first created the character Tinker Bell to appear in a play (Peter Pan) and then in a novel (Peter and Wendy) but her worldwide popularity is no doubt largely the result of her appearance in the Disney film that first appeared in 1953, Peter Pan. Tinker Bell later became the official Disney ""mascot"" in versions of the television series variously known as Walt Disney Presents, Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color, The Wonderful World of Disney, and The Magical World of Disney. The point is, she has been a major entertainment figure for more than 50 years and, at one point, was so popular that she received more fan mail than all others, including Marilyn Monroe.

Of course, children could not care less about her history but they continue to be delighted by her charm and energy. Tinker Bell is by nature a creature whose greatest talent is to ""tinker"" with whatever needs to be repaired; rather than pots and pans, she uses fairy dust that enables children to fly. Children love to explore secret places as when following Alice down a rabbit hole, or Peter Pan and the Darling children through an open bedroom window and then high above London at night, sailing with Geppetto, Figaro, and Cleo into Monstro's stomach, or visiting Pixie Hollow where Tinker Bell and the other fairies live. As in countless other Disney features, the production values in this film are outstanding, the music is seamlessly integrated with the plot developments, and the humor is appropriately playful. Also, I think the running time (78 minutes) is just right for younger children.

No need to list the special features.  Others have listed them and they do add substantial value, although the younger grandchildren with whom I see them seem interested only in the games whereas I much prefer the background material. Some animated features (including the Disney classics as well as several produced by DreamWorks and Pixar) have an almost unlimited shelf-life, retaining great appeal throughout and among various age groups. I doubt if that will be true of Tinker Bell or, for that matter, Peter Pan. However, that said, I think that those who have seen it, as they grow older, will still enjoy seeing it again and again with younger companions if only to observe their delight. For me, the fairy dust has lost none of its potency after all these years...and never will. How wonderful!",1225324800,2,2389,4.893827160493827
3244122,5,B000XUOIQY,"We love Disney, and their movies...but it is so nice to finally have a movie that I don't have to skip through the ""scary parts"" for my two young girls.  They absolutely loved every beautiful moment of this wonderful family movie.  I also thoroughly enjoyed it myself!",1225324800,6,268,4.680851063829787
3244123,4,B000XUOIQY,"While I bought this for my niece to watch, I was also really looking forward to seeing it and I think I may have enjoyed it more than her even.  It's a great movie and even though this animation is computer generated and different from other Disney movies, it's so enjoyable and fun.
Voicing different characters are Kristin Chenoweth, America Ferrera, Angelica Houston, Jesse McCartney and Kathy Namjimy to name a few.  It's a sweet and charming movie and yet adults and even boys will find something in here for them as well.  For your little ones and tweens too, as part of the DVD extras, there is a music video by Selena Gomez.  The movie draws you in from start to end and it was thoroughly enjoyable.  It's not like your usual Pixars, but it's so entertaining and I highly recommend it.",1225324800,2,793,4.5174825174825175
3244124,3,B000XUOIQY,"When Disney started advertising this movie early 2008, my 6yo daughter was excited. We started reading all of the Disney Fairy books out there to get a preview of what may be coming. As usual, the books are rich with imagery and details while the video skimps or avoids on many of the rich details. Some elements are completely avoided or messed up.

My suggestion, if you read the books, you will be disappointed with some of the changes Disney made. The early books focus on characters you don't ever see in the movies. There are differences that can create confusion in your younger viewers (that have read the books), like ""Where's Mother Dove?""",1225324800,,649,4.692982456140351

3244126,5,B000XUOIQY,"I really didn't think it would be as good as it was. I bought it because  my daughter is a big Tinkerbell fan and I wanted to add it to my Disney animation movie collection.
I love the fact that it explained how Tinkerbell came to life and it showed girls that it's ok to figure out things in life and to do what you love to do in life. This movie went from the very begining of Tinkerbell's life to where she meets Wendy so my daughter put the connection together. It has the same houses, buildings, Big Ben, the second star, Neverland etc. that you see in the ""Peter Pan"" movie. The color and animation was beautiful!
It didn't drag on; it was enjoyable to watch & my 5 yrs. old daughter loves it.
This is a great movie to watch with your
daughter(s).",1225238400,4,753,4.157534246575342
3244127,3,B000XUOIQY,"Tinker Bell has come a long way and deserved to.

She started as small beam of light and tinkling bell in J.M. Barrie's legendary 1904 play ""Peter Pan,"" and reprised her role in his 1911 book, ""Peter and Wendy."" Since 1953 she's gained form as impulsive, voluptuous pixie, first in Disney's essential ""Peter Pan"" film, then sprinkling Disney magic (often beside Walt himself) as Disney's weekly TV hostess. As much as Winnie the Pooh or even Mickey Mouse himself, Tinker Bell is part of what makes Disney's empire what it is.

So even in a straight-to-DVD release, her first starring role had to be good and, for the most part, is. Director Bradley Raymond assembled a first-rate voice cast including Raven-Symone, Lucy Liu, America Ferrara, teen heartthrob Jessie McCartney and even the suitably wise and regal Anjelica Huston as Queen Clarion, queen of the fairies.  Thankfully, he made the film a companion piece rather than sequel to ""Peter Pan"": Neverland's steep, green mountains frame the action and Tink's own film ends where Pan begins, with the pixie meeting and gifting young Wendy.

The art work is naturally beautiful in both senses of the word. The story builds around how fairies transition and maintain nature and the seasons, and the film's scale and depth vividly paint autumn and winter (especially in the film's opening, which narly equals Disney's best mythmaking in its theatrical films). The DVD's recommended extras suggest Pixie Hollow carries the influence of 19th century German artist Albert Bierstadt, whose visions of the US Sierra Nevada and other Western images suggest a power in nature Disney happily pixie dusted.

The plot, meanwhile, is thin as Tink's new wings and just as well. Born from a baby's laugh and granted talent to work with pots and kettles, she yearns to visit the mainland (think of Ariel's wanting to be ""part of that world"") and is willing to trade new talents for her chance. Without spoiling the ending, she stays true to her own calling encouraged by fairies and other friends (including the requisite comic relief, two sprites named Clank and Bobble who do little but bumble and annoy.)

Besides the recommended ""making of"" extras, you also get a clever live-action film on how fairies interact with nature, the requisite Disney radio-friendly video from Selena Gomez (What? They couldn't have her sing with McCartney?) and a pleasant DVD interactive game. Overall, ""Tinker Bell"" as film is sweet, sassy and sprightly as the pixie pouting ar tiy from a minivan sticker, or greeting you Sunday nights for near three generations. Nice debut, long overdue and recommended.",1225152000,5,2627,5.04147465437788
3244128,5,B000XUOIQY,"My 3.5 year-old daughter loves Tinker Bell and all things to do with fairies. When I heard Disney was releasing a Tinker Bell movie, I was very excited and after viewing it today, we are both delighted and happy with the movie.

The story's premise is quite simple - Tinker Bell's origins are shown [and yes, she speaks here], and she finds that her talent is to be a tinker fairy. But, Tinker Bell[Mae Whitman] doesn't take to her talent with much enthusiasm - she feels her other fairy friends such as the water fairy Silver Mist [Lucy Liu], animal fairy Fawn [America Ferra], garden/flower fairy Rosetta [Kristin Chenoweth], and light Fairy Iridessa [Raven Symone] have 'real' talents and she is also upset that the tinker fairies aren't allowed to accompany the other fairies when they take Spring to the Mainland, i.e. London. Thus begins Tink's adventures in trying to adopt the other fairies' talents, until she eventually comes to the realization that being a tinker is what Tinker Bell does best.

The story itself has a good lesson underlying it, but what's truly wonderful about this production is the beautiful animation. Though it's CGI - the fairies don't exactly come across as wooden characters - the main fairies seem truly 'alive' and their facial expressions and voices make this one of the more appealing straight-to-DVD Disney releases. It definitely makes repeated viewings a likelihood.

I also loved the extra features on the DVD:

There's a Tinker Trainer - a DVD-ROM activity
Magical Guide to Pixie Hollow - where viewers get to see different parts of the fairy world with Tinker Bell and Queen Clarion acting as guides.
Ever Wonder - discover how fairies put the 'wonder' in natural wonders, a visual delight indeed.
An all-new music video performed by Selena Gomez
Creating Pixie Hollow - see how the filmmakers created the magical fairy world
Deleted scenes

The approximate running time is 78 minutes, just long enough that little ones don't start getting squirmy:)

All in all, both my daughter and I were delighted with this latest Disney production and look forward to a future installment with Tinker Bell and her friends from Pixie Hollow!",1225152000,2,2174,4.942465753424657
3244129,5,B000XUOIQY,"The other reviews hit the story and generic specs, but there are definitely some other things to consider in maybe wanting to own this BD.

The quality of the picture is phenomenal. All weekend I was playing it in the store and it managed to appeal to a broad audience (age and gender). The story, music and visuals had kids from 2 to 10 very involved. The adults actually sat for minutes at a time just because of the clarity and color palettes. Several cinephiles were going to get it just to demonstrate animation clarity for their home theaters. I have to disagree with the reviews of this film that say only kids under a certain age will enjoy this. A large volume of teens commented on how cool it looks and yes, especially the teen girls seemed interested that a quality film had been made.

The main selling point I saw was an outline of each feature (a peeve of mine was finally addressed regarding special features on a BD). One of the main facets of BD that most customers have been overlooking are the sometimes ""overwhelming"" or ""misunderstood/confusing"" extras. But in this case, Disney gives a brief description and time stamp for each special feature as you scroll by it. That made it more approachable for my kids as they were surfing through the extras deciding what they wanted to see.

Overall a fun film, an outstanding picture, thorough AND explained extras, and a good crowd pleaser.",1225065600,,1406,4.63855421686747

3244131,4,B000XUOIQY,"I just watched TINKER BELL on Blu-ray and I was quite impressed.  Time was that direct-to-DVD meant, well, bad.  Low production values, second tier talent, and a disposable story.  Lately, however, a number of studios have begun struggling with ways to develop a business model that allowed them to make profits on projects that bypassed theater releases.  For instance, MGM has had some success with the Stargate movies, which have a solid but niche market, enough fans to buy DVDs with enthusiasm, but not enough general public support to justify a general release into theaters.  Universal has reputedly been thinking of the possibility of doing the same with a SERENITY sequel, a film that merely broke even (after international sales) in the theaters, but has been a huge success on disc.  My point is that it is no longer possible to dismiss anything that makes its debut on disc.

TINKER BELL is a great example of the greatly increased quality of direct-to-DVD productions.  Visually, this is just a stunning movie.  Story apart, there is never a moment when the film isn't utterly riveting.  As an adult I found it great to look at from beginning to end.  I think small children, especially young girls, will find it entrancing.  The story isn't very complex or nuanced, but there are some nice messages of empowerment.  If classic Disney frequently was mired in notions that the primary hope of women was for someday their prince to come, this one's theme is of a young fairy striving to be all that she can be.  The emphasis is on what she can make of herself, not only the need for a romantic Other to make her life complete.

I mentioned the relative lack of talent in traditional direct-to-DVD releases.  That is not the case here.  Tinker Bell is voiced by Mae Whitman, who many will know as the delightfully forgetable Ann on ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT (viewers of the show will know what I meant by that).  Some of the main fairies are voiced by such excellent performers as Kristin Chenoweth, America Ferrera, Angelica Huston, Lucy Liu, and Jane Horrocks.

Honestly, the movie is not going to blow most adults away.  This is very definitely a kids film.  As someone who raised a daughter as a single dad, however, I am confident that small children, especially young girls, are going to love this movie.  And it is something that adults will be able to enjoy watching a first time and not find too unpleasant on the unaccountable repeated viewings that very young children love to engage in (there are still many animated movies that my daughter watched a few dozen times that I have nearly every scene memorized).

If you have a small child, this is a very good movie to consider picking up, especially if the child in question is a girl.  It features very high production standards, is unbelievably beautiful to look at, and has a much better than average moral.  And it is clearly intended to be the first of at least two films, since an insert inside the case advertises a new Tinker Bell film to be released in the fall of 2009.",1224979200,5,3045,4.7

* The music very appropriately complements the whole fairy theme, courtesy of Sarah McLachlan, one of the world's greatest Celtic singers.
* The storyline takes this character born in the Peter Pan story and gives it a very detailed life, creating a whole mythology around her.

The result is a fun story that occasionally brought to mind Bee Movie (specially in terms of some of the elements of the story) but delivered in great Disney fashion.

3244134,3,B000XUOIQY,"TINKER BELL is a computer animated film that explains the origins of the famous fairy and sidekick to Peter Pan.  It is the first in a series of new Direct-to-DVD films being planned, promoting the newest Disney produced franchise, the Disney Fairies.  The movie begins with a baby laughing that sends a part of a plant from our world through the sky and into Neverland where at Pixie Hollow it rests beneath the fairy dust stream and is turned into a new fairy.  Taking a cue from Harry Potter, the fairy goes around from object to object looking for the object that will cue her of her talent and give her clan.  It is the Tinker's hammer that chooses the new fairy and the Queen bestows her name, Tinker Bell.  Tinker Bell is very excited about being a tinker.  Tinkering doesn't seem as interesting or as important as helping baby birds to fly or pollinating plants.  However, Tink does like to Tinker and is eager to use her talent until she discovers that Tinker Fairies aren't allowed to go to the Mainland to bring Spring.  This distresses Tinker Bell, but she is determined to visit the Mainland.  Along the way she undergoes some misadventures that eventually leads to a major accident that forces Tink to accept who she is.

The animation in TINKER BELL is stunning. The colors are brilliant and the movement of some of the characters is lifelike.  At the same time, things are too realistic.  Vibrant and vivid as Pixie Hollow is no one will mistake anything in this video for being anything other than animation.

The film is voiced by a very talented cast that includes America Ferrera, Kristin Chenoweth, Anjelica Huston, Lucy Liu, Raven-Symone, and Mae Whitman.  The score was written by Joel McNeely and many of the songs are performed Mairead Nesbitt of Celtic Woman.

The movie is entertaining enough to watch and the target audience of this film, young girls, will probably enjoy TINKER BELL the most.  I found the film to be relatively entertaining with just the right mix of humor and drama, though I found the central message of the movie (accept yourself for who you are) too syrupy to be of any substance.  Still, TINKER BELL is better than much children's direct to DVD dreck that is produced, including some previous Disney releases, e.g. CINDERELLA II.

The DVD includes a few extras including a DVD-ROM activity entitled Tinker Trainer; Magical Guide to Pixie Hollow, an exploration into the realms of the fairies with Tinker Bell; a short entitled ""Ever Wonder"" that uses live action and a little animation to illustrate all the things fairies do in our world; the music video ""Fly To Your Heart"" sung by Selena Gomez (from THE WIZARDS OF WAVERLY PLACE on the Disney Channel); a few deleted scenes; and previews for upcoming DVD releases.",1224633600,32,2768,4.74321503131524
3244135,3,B000XUOIQY,"The fairies aren't quite up to the Japanese standards for animations.
The skin and wings and shape are not up to the quality of the soundtrack?
At one time Disney set the standard, but even a child can see that
these drawing aren't as well done?
The story, dialog and plot-line are better than the actual animation.
If you are taking about ""magic"" and the land of Faerie, then you have to have the shine and glamor that is fantasy in the telling, in the imagination.
For me the drawing fell short of what they should be:
that is the fault of the art director.
No one would notice if there weren't better work that these can be compared to!",1224547200,,639,4.333333333333333
3244136,4,B000XUOIQY,"""Tinker Bell"" has gotten a lot of online commentary, most of it negative, so I wasn't really excited to watch my preview copy of this movie. I was VERY pleasantly surprised by what I saw. ""Tinker Bell"" is an enjoyable movie, perfect for children and even entertaining for adults. Based upon what I'd read previously, I would not have gone to a theater to see this; however, after watching it, I believe this movie is worthy of both big screen AND home entertainment viewing. Unfortunately, most of the banter has focused on the fact that Tinker Bell speaks. Personally, this is a minor point, as the animators have done a tremendous job of having Tinker Bell retain her spunky nature and movements that we all know from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peter-Pan-2-Disc-Platinum-Edition/dp/B000JBWWRY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peter Pan (2-Disc Platinum Edition)</a>.""

The story is fairly simple; Tinker Bell arrives in Pixie Hollow, where all the Fairies have talents. It is discovered that (no surprise) Tinker Bell's talent is ""tinkering"" or fixing things. However, in Tink's opinion, this is not very exciting. She'd rather be one of the Fairies who gets to take Spring to ""the mainland"" (aka London). As you can imagine, Tink's early time at Pixie Hollow is filled with figuring out who she really is and that she is just as important as the other fairies who have more glamorous talents. There is plenty of humor, emotion, and visual beauty that helps elevate what seems like an oft-told tale.

The animation is fantastic; although it is obviously computer generated, it is apparent that the level of the animators doing it is such that they focus on camera movements, lighting, color, and emotional nuances rather than just the basics. Still, the characters do still have somewhat of a doll-like/mechanical quality. The movement and facial emoting is a vast improvement over some of the early computer animation, but it does still have a little way to go.

There is also a first-rate cast behind the scenes, giving the voices to these animated characters: Anjelica Huston (Queen Clarion), Lucy Liu (Silvermist), America Ferrera (Fawn), Kristin Chenoweth (Rosetta), Kathy Najimy (Minister of Summer), and my favorite, Jane Horrocks as the sassy Fairy Mary. The Celtic-inspired score by Joel McNeely is also enjoyable and the perfect accompaniment to the film.

The extras include:

* Tinker Trainer: Hone your skills as a Tinker Fairy in this activity

* Magical guide to Pixie Hollow: Discover the Ancient Realm of Fairies with Tinker Bell

* Ever Wonder: Discover how Fairies put the ""wonder"" in natural wonders. Combining special effects with live action, you are ""shown"" how grass grows between the cracks in the sidewalk, etc. A cute little featurette.

* Creating Pixie Hollow: See how the filmmakers created this magical realm.

* All-new music video, ""Fly To Your Heart,"" by Disney Channel's Selena Gomez.

* Deleted scenes include optional introductions by Bradley Raymond (director) and Jeannine Roussel (producer): ""Queen Clarion's Pixie Dust,"" ""Fairies Venture to the Mainland,"" ""Becoming a Garden Fairy,"" ""Tinker Bell's Tinkering Talents,"" ""Vidia Tricks Tinker Bell,"" ""Fairies Express Tinker Bell's Importance""
While enjoyable, they are not really missed from the film.

* Sneak previews, most notably the Blu-ray version of 1940's ""Pinocchio."" It looks fantastic! Being released March 2009.

3244138,5,B000XUOIQY,"I was lucky enough to see a this early, and it is a truly wonderful film, especially for a straight to video feature. I prefer 2D animation to 3D, but the animation here is beautiful, particularly with the illustration of the different seasons.  The story is captivating, charming, and full of magic, and the explanation of each fairy's talent is tons of fun. Tinker Bell sure has come a long way from the jealous little pixie in ""Peter Pan"". As some have mentioned, Mae Whitman does a wonderful job giving Tink her first voice. And the soundtrack is lovely and quite refreshing. It has a distinctive Celtic flavor, and the very talented Loreena McKennitt lends her voice to the piece.

I can't wait to buy this and watch it again with my 10-year-old sister!",1224201600,9,758,4.649253731343284

3244140,5,B000XUOIQY,"Mairead Nesbitt, of Celtic Woman, plays in 22 of the 24 musical tracks on this DVD.  She worked with Joel McNeely, who composed all, on all the tracks.  Mairead is the fiddler/violinist for Celtic Woman.  She did many solos and did the reel for the song ""Sprinting Thistles.""  Mairead works perfection into all of her pieces and I am sure anyone who acquires this DVD will thoroughly enjoy not only the movie, but also and especially Mairead's playing.  She plays elegantly with a fantastic orchestra also.",1223251200,7,506,4.837209302325581
3244141,4,B000XUOIQY,"Saw this a week ago in Los Angeles at the El Capitan Theater.  If you're expecting a Pixar caliber story - look elsewhere.  If you're looking for Pixar artistry, this doesn't quite reach those dizzying heights.  But if you're after quality Disney entertainment for the little ones in your family (especially the female ones)  you can't really do much better.  I have a four year old girl, and this was the first movie (of three that we've seen together on the big screen) that she absolutely loved.  She enjoyed Wall-E, but much of it went over her head.  Horton Hears a Who, was also enjoyable and slightly too manic - but again, a lot of the wry humor and topical stuff she missed completely.

This movie had her enthralled from beginning to end - and I have to say was far less than painful for me to watch as well.  Now this isn't a ringing endorsement that could be afforded a Toy Story 1 or 2 or Cars (which are great films for BOTH parent and child to enjoy) but I have to say this film completely outclasses the Disney straight to DVD sequels that I've seen (dreck like Cinderella 3 and Alladin 2 - YUCK) and simply blows away the Barbie movies (which though excruciating to watch at times, do captivate my little girl and are surprisingly  pro-female).

Tinkerbelle, ultimately, is not a film for the young and young at heart - as the great Disney movies are; but it is leaps and bounds above the usual straight to DVD product that they have been shilling for the past decade.

The visuals are also light years beyond anything previously released in a straight to video format, and hold up to and even exceed the previous Disney CG features such as Chicken Little or Meet the Robinsons.

If you've got a 3 to 8 year old little girl - this is a must get.  Young boys will enjoy it too, there's more than enough to sustain interest.",1223164800,87,1839,4.4183976261127595
3244142,5,B000XUOIQY,"We are Disney passholders and were lucky enough to be invited to watch the movie this afternoon in it's entirety at Disney World!  Let me just say it was wonderful!!  Both myself and my almost 4 year old daughter were mesmerized by the graphics, the color and the story.  It is very well done and I hope everyone has the opportunity to see it on the big screen like we did today because it is just beautiful.  FYI, there are 3 more movies to follow this one, hopefully on the big screen.  The message of the movie is also great for kids, that we can't all be good at everything but that's ok!  Tink is such a cute character as are the other fairies, I sometimes forgot they weren't real!  LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!",1222473600,80,708,4.2781954887218046
3244143,5,B000XUOIQY,"I went to see the movie this afternoon, yes.. here in Mexico is playing in teathers. It is a great, fantastic, incredible, wonderfull and beautiful movie. The movie was in Spanish and it was great, the music and the colors. What I like the most was the story, because it has a deep message, I mean it has to do with your own acceptance to society. Think has to prove and acept by herself what she was meant to be. She is like a mechanich or something like that, but she wants to be different until the moment that she figures it out what she really is. All the fairies are so beautyful, the colors and the 3-D animation. I am wondering why Disney studios did not give this project to Pixar Animation, because I can tell that the animation is a little poor compared with Wall-e, resolution and color are very good, Dubbing was incredible and the story remains me something naive and sweet. I strongly recomend this movie to little childrend, my wife love it, and I am actually cry because it has a lot of love. Oh... and my favorite character is ""queso"" or ""cheese"", a little mouse that helps tinker bell trying to capture weeds, and my favorite fairy is Vidia, because she is kind of evil but no so much, and she is prettier than tink. Queen Clayron is so pixie and understanding person, and tink's friends are so funy, specially the fat guy. I can't reveal the end, but I can say that Wendy is in the movie (yes... the Pete's friend). Finally, it seems that think has a friend that likes her a lot. I can't wait to compare this movie with the blu-ray version. My expections about this movie were so high and I can say that well done. Thank's Disney. I am so happy to see an incredible and pixie Movie.",1222300800,8,1702,4.321875

3244146,4,B000XUOIQY,"This DVD isn't out until October, but based on the trailer and the webisodes called 'Pixie Previews', there is plenty to base an opinion on to help people in their decision to purchase this DVD.

First, the Movie trailer and `Pixie Previews' are available to watch on youtube and Disney.com and they give a good introduction as to what to expect from this DVD. While not Pixar quality, the CGI featured shows a quality not unlike what we've seen in Chicken Little.

Second, an internet search helped reveal some of the DVD bonus features. Separated into two categories they are:

PIXIE HOLLOW - explores the world of the Fairies:
-Magical Guide to Pixie Hollow
-Tinker Trainer DVD ROM
-Ever Wonder Featurette

THE MAINLAND - explores the making of the movie:
-Creating Pixie Hollow
-Deleted Scenes

Third, I'm assuming that the trailer and the series of 6 `Pixie Preview' webisodes will also be included. Each webisode is about 2 minutes long and are creatively done to help introduce people to TinkerBell and the other Pixies (Not to mention the CGI world they will inhabit). These are:

Tink and the Bell
Tink and the Pepper Shaker
Fawn and the Log
Fawn and the Butterfly
Silvermist and the Fish
Iridessa and the Light Bugs
Rosetta and the Flower (There are apparently two versions of this one making the actual total to 7 webisodes.)

This Direct-to-DVD feature is also the first of 4 releases and the DVD will no-doubt boast at lease one trailer for these next releases:

Tinker Bell: North of Neverland (2009)
Tinker Bell: A Midsummer Storm (summer 2010)
Tinker Bell: A Winter Story (summer 2011)

And last but not least, this Direct-to-DVD feature will be a first for Disney. TinkerBell will talk! Mae Whitman will give Tinker Bell her first true voice. That is definitely something to look forward to!

In closing I give this 4 stars with the 5th in reserve for the actual film.",1216252800,29,1885,4.772307692307693
