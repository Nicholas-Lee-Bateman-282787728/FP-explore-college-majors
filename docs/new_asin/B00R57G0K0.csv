Never before has anyone explained to me as clearly and minutely as Finis has, how to perform this earthy step as he calls it. And, how lucky for me that he has chosen a wonderful dancer as his demonstrator, Antonio Carmena, soloist with The New York City Ballet, who simply enchants you with his amazing precision. His execution is flawless, graceful and powerful. Moreover, I have not found any other DVD on the market that dissects the balanc as shown in this lessonshowing first how to make the step en face, then traveling in all directions, combining it with other steps and poses, and culminating with two charming danceable combinations across the floor which employ other concepts previously learned in the first two Basic Ballet Movement Skills videos. Once again, Finis insists on the essential concepts of his teachingusing opposition through the upper body and arms, maintaining correct posture (always being in Number 1), and pushing down to go up. He emphasizes that for an adult beginner, there should be nothing more rewarding than knowing how to display the correct form without forcing turn-out, or trying to lift the position leg higher than one should, which distorts the line resulting in awkward and clumsy movements. It is truly empowering for an adult student to hear they can still dance beautifully even without having an ideal professional body. As in all of Finis Jhung DVDs, the exercises progress both in tempo and complexity in a logical sequence of movement with mathematical precision.  In addition, the three modes of playing this videofull class, individual exercises or workout mode (without instruction) constitute a truly unique experience for the student. Before purchasing this DVD, all I knew about the balanc was that it was somehow similar to the waltz, yet different. How to do this tricky step was a complete mystery to me. But, not anymore, thanks to Finiss detailed instructions. This DVD is worth every penny and I urge you all to purchase it! Ileana Ray, Brooklyn, NY",1462924800,,2169,5.025
