5185285,5,B008VL047E,This reminds me of the children's stories from my childhood. The characters are memorable and fun. The language is ticklish and festive..,1367625600,,137,5.2727272727272725
5185286,5,B008VL047E,"I used to have this story as a Windows 95 computer game, but now that I'm using Windows 8, I can't go back and play it again for old times' sake like I want to. This movie is the perfect solution to my wish for a walk down memory lane. I adore the music the Ladysmith Black Mambazo performed for the game, the audiobook and the movie, and Danny Glover's narration makes this story every bit as lovable as it was meant to be when Rudyard Kipling first wrote it.

In summary, I am so glad I found this again. Thank you, Amazon!",1363392000,2,525,4.097087378640777
5185287,1,B008VL047E,I thought this was going to be an evolution documentary.  Boy was I wrong. Its a kids book on video.  Turned it off in 3 minutes .... Waste of money if your an adult.,1346716800,,166,3.8529411764705883

8531000,4,B008VL047E,"I bought this for my kids because I remember the music so fondly from when I was a child.  The video quality is just ok, and it was anything but easy to play it at all.  I have a new mac, but the video wouldn't play in chrome, safari, and wouldn't work on my new android phone, and there's no android video app on the nexus player for our tv... so you have to install amazon underground on an android phone and then allow untrusted apps, then install the actual amazon video amazon app via amazon underground... this is the reason people pirate.  All this for a sub-dvd quality viewing.

I love the music and narration from this content.  The DRM experience here... sucked.  Buy the DVD instead.",1463443200,,695,4.390625
