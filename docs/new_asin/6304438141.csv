7871383,4,6304438141,"I am a long time animal lover, and my avid fascination with large cats and dog probably started right here. I grew up loving National Geographic and I totally loved this particular segment of this show. Anyone with half a brain should know that National Geographic is not a funny kids show, it is meant to be informative for young minds and semi-realistic about natures wild creatures-something I think that this segment stays true to. It is geared towards kids, not toddlers. It taught me the link between predators and domesticated pets, and entertained me.

This is a great segment, and I wish I still had the copy I has when I was a kid so when I have children of my own I too can share my love of animals with them.

Also, this VHS is a pain in the butt to order if you're not a US citizen (hint:Canadian up in here)",1337472000,,821,4.324675324675325
7871384,1,6304438141,"I purchased National Geographic's Really Wild Animals: Hot Dogs and Cool Cats [VHS] for my daughter who adores this series of videos narrated by Dudley Moore.  When she opened it, it was NOT the correct video, instead it is a video narrated by Jack Hanna on Zoo Life.  VERY UPSET!  Wish to obtain full refund and correct video, but since it is an amazon seller instead of amazon, apparently there is no way for this to happen.  Do not buy from this seller!!!!!",1321833600,,460,4.506024096385542
7871385,1,6304438141,"A major disappointment.  Geared towards adolescent boys, with attention spans of moths. Unsuitable for younger children. Frames rush by so fast one can barely register what is on the sceen, boring, and violent (at least two scenes of wild dogs eating smaller animals.) No depictions of nature's gentle, funny side. My four year old daughter and I hated it. Don't waste your money.",1062892800,4,380,5.031746031746032
