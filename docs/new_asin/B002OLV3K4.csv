8376119,4,B002OLV3K4,"For an adult this is incredibly, mind-numbing boring.  But then it's not aimed at adults.  What I particularly like about this particular edition, is that it is easily  interchangable from Spanish to English.  In fact, it was originally made in the English language, as you can clearly see when it shows children speaking.  So if you want your toddler to begin to learn Spanish and/or English, this is a wonderful resource.  For the young, I think the repetition is good.  Reenforces everything.  Highly recommended.",1421020800,,516,5.059523809523809
8376120,5,B002OLV3K4,"Although it is quite monotonous for an adult to watch or listen to, my almost 3 year old seems to love it.  We speak only Spanish to him at home and this has been a great introduction to numbers for him.",1351987200,,203,3.951219512195122
