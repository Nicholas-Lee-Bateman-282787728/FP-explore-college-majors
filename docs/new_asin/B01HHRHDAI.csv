Legacy Volume 2 is, of course, the second half of the DVD and CD performances of the classic Celtic Thunder fan favorites.  There have been a lot of changes within the group members over the years and the faces and voices, in some cases, have changed, but the power and pleasure of these older tunes is still there.

I received this DVD a few days early, having pre-ordered it from the group's website, and I have to say up front that I am a bit disappointed that Volume 2 was not released in Blu-ray, like Volume 1.  Its unfortunate when a concert is broken into two parts and then released in inconsistent formats.  The visual quality, however, is pretty good on close-ups on my Blu-ray player, although Ive noticed some fuzzy edges in the group shots. Id be interested to know if others experience the same, or if it is my player or my particular DVD.  Aside from the less sharp and crisp visual quality, musically its a very, very enjoyable DVD, one I expect to watch over and over.

Keith Harkin starts off the DVD with Now we are Free, which I think is one of his best numbers.  Colm Keegan does a beautiful job on Katie.  Damian McGinty reprises Home, and before performing a fun version of Breaking Up is Hard to Do, he speaks to the audience about his early career with the group and his departure to be in Glee.  Neil Byrne, unfortunately, does not have a solo song, a conspicuous exclusion, but he joins Keith and Ryan for Hallelujah and is there for the group numbers.

The Dark Destroyer is back in fine form with Ryan Kelly performing the delightfully humorous Heartbreaker and Thats a Woman, but my favorite by far is Streets of New York.  This particular song just works so well with his vocal range and style, and I was pleased to see it included here, since it was so glaringly omitted form the Mythology DVD.

Emmett OHanlon, another classically trained operatic singer, took over songs we previously saw performed by the group's previous operatic singer, Paul Byrum, such as Remember Me, and he did an excellent job playing the good guy to Ryans bad guy in Thats a Woman.  While opera is not my thing, I must say that his voice is amazing.

I particularly enjoyed this version of Song for the Mira.  The six voices merge and blend so well in this song, as well as Take Me Home.  Seven Drunken Nights has been done on several previous DVDs, but I think this one may be the funniest yet.  Neil seems to get a little drunker with each version, and Ryan and Damian trying to hide Neils boots from Colm is hilarious.

George Donaldsons contributions to the success of the group is acknowledged by the five members who worked with him, and who speak fondly of him before performing Life with You.  As always, his presence is sorely missed, but it was nice that in this celebration of classic CT songs, he was remembered and celebrated as well.

The final track on the DVD is Mo Ghile Mear, originally performed in Storm.  Its long been one of my favorite songs, and was performed in Legacy 2 wearing their trademark kilts.  Im going to make a confession: Im probably the only woman in the western hemisphere who is not a fan of the kilts, but I suppose every DVD must have one song where they're wearing them.

The DVD has the look and feel of a concert, but much of the between-song applause has been edited out, and I found myself wondering several times if the songs were presented on the DVD out of the order in which they were originally performed.  There are, as always, cuts to the audience, but they do not seem as noticeable in this one.  A few interesting shots of the audience also includes the performer or performers from behind.

There are no frills, no fluff, and unfortunately, no bonus material.  It would have been nice to have had some interviews, backstage camaraderie, or words from Sharon Browne about upcoming projects with this group.  I'm giving this review 5 stars on the basis of the music, since I could really find no fault with the performers.  They were wonderful.

There have been many changes within this group, which has adapted to each one seamlessly, and Im assuming there will be other changes with the coming year.  My understanding is that Colm Keegan, who has recently been on hiatus to tour, teach, and get married, may be returning in 2017, but Keith Harkin and Emmett OHanlon are now gone.  Damian has been performing as a special guest, and I don't know what Emmet Cahills future plans are, so with Michael ODwyer coming into the group and only two original members left if you include Neil, who initially was in the band, there must surely be more changes to come.

I feel I must add one last comment directed at Sharon Browne and David Munro.  While its been wonderful hearing the group perform these iconic songs and the concerts are still packed to sell-out capacity, no group can last forever on its past laurels, and if the producer and music director do not provide some new material soon, I fear this wonderful group may pass into history. I would hate to see that happen.",1470787200,51,5065,4.522502744237102

They have beautiful music and singing. Both are great and are enjoyable to hear over and over again. The staging of the show, as well as the involvement of not only the singers but the musicians also in the acts, the amazingly perfect choreography, the humor both in the songs and otherwise, the words in the selected songs, and the relationship between the singers and the singers with the musicians are all terrific.",1508284800,,581,4.4392523364485985

7787504,2,B01HHRHDAI,This is a bad attempt to move out of the shadow of George and become their own band. The replacement of the signature song of Ireland calling was a desaster.

7787511,3,B01HHRHDAI,"This DVD is good with a couple of exceptions.  ""Seven Drunken Nights"" was funny, but the portion previously sung by George seemed like a band-aid approach to dealing with his absence.  I won't say how it was done for those who may want to purchase this DVD but I just didn't care for it. to me it would have been better to retire that particular number.  I will say that Colm got his comedic timing in this version down much better than in ""Mythology.""  In that one it was more like he was singing a ballad.  Damian does a very good job handling the parts previously sung by George on most songs and it was good to see such favorite as ""Raggle Taggle Gypsy and ""Caledonia.""  Emmett O'Hanlon is an excellent replacement for Paul Byrom.  He is a tenor as Paul is, but he seems to have a richer quality to his voice at least to me.  Unfortunately the only solo he got was ""Danny Boy"" which is really overdone.  It seems that Celtic Thunder may retire at some point since Colm and Keith have left the group.  They have been replaced so we'll have to see what happens.  All in all both this and Legacy Volume One are well worth the purchase.",1475020800,2,1136,4.286384976525822

7787541,4,B01HHRHDAI,"Legacy Volume Two does indeed have a lot of repeat songs; however, the songs have different singers singing different parts.  I like to see how the group has evolved and grown.  Seven Drunken Nights alone is worth the price of the dvd.  Their comic timing has greatly improved. Life with you was a touching tribute to George, with the group singing it like George would.  Ryan is in fine form and Damian has grown into a fine young man.  This may not be their best DVD but is well worth a look for the Thinder fan.",1471132800,16,514,4.3125
7787542,2,B01HHRHDAI,I'm a huge Celtics Thunder fan and on its own this portion of Legacy was just ok. If you've never seen any of the other dvds it may be better on its own but it contains the same songs previously done over and over again. There are only 2 new songs on this dvd. Celtics Thunder is an amazing group but this one wasn't their best dvd by far.,1471132800,7,339,3.927536231884058

8765499,5,B01HHRHDAI,Anything from Celtic Thunder will not disappoint.  Bought this for my 88 year old mother who has followed CT from the very first time she saw them on PBS in 2007. I love them as well and have this  CD. We have had no problems with any of their CD's or DVD's.  The music is fantastic and the Irish Lads deliver from the heart.  Definitely recommend this DVD and the CD.,1518307200,,368,4.140845070422535
