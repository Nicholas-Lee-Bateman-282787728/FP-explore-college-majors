4571039,5,B00551QQHK,"This is an excellent documentary. Not only does it tell a thorough story about ""Boys in the Band"", but it also gives a beief history of being gay in the U.S. for the past 50 years. I was saddened by the interviews with the young gay people today that showed they have no knowledge of ""Boys in the Band"", or any concept of the hard fought battles with authorities and with legislators, or the hurt,pain,suffering,anguish,and even death that was endured to get them the freedom that they all seem to take for granted today. Mart Crowley is a fascinating person. His stories about schmoozing with the Hollywood in-crowd of the day are priceless. To say that ""Boys in the Band"" is meaningless because it's so dated is not fair criticism. ""West Side Story"" and ""Bye Bye Birdie"" are dated too, but they are  still gems of entertainment. When the film of ""Boys"" finally came out (pun intended) on DVD, I watched it with a group of friends, after which we played a game. If the film was made today, who would be cast. Granted, most of the actors we chose are not gay (not openly anyway), but here's what we ended up with. Michael-Edward Norton, Donald-James Franco, Hank-Matt Damon, Larry-Justin Timberlake, Emory-Neil Patrick Harris, Bernard-Chiwetel Ejiofor, Harold-Adrian Brody, Alan-Ryan Gosling, Cowboy-Channing Tatum. Kinda silly, but it was fun.",1322524800,15,1344,4.894736842105263
4571040,4,B00551QQHK,"My first encounter with The Boys in the Band was at a theatre in Bloomfield, NJ in 1970.  I was 14 and wasn't allowed in, but a phrase on the poster caught my imagination.  It said ""The Boys in the Band is not a musical"".  So I marched myself to the public library, read the play, and adored it.  I bought the cast album on A&M records, which I still have.  Many years later, with the advent of video tape, I finally got to see the film and adored it also.  And some time after that I had the privilege of working on a Spanish language version of the play, which was a hit in Miami.  I thought The Boys in the Band was a masterpiece when I read it at 14, and I still do.  I don't find it demeaning, or retrograde, or any of the dozens of pejoratives that it has acquired over the years.  I think it's a slice of gay life, nothing more nothing less, and as such it is brilliant.  Brilliant, however, is not the word for this documentary, which is actually more about Mart Crowley than it is about The Boys in the Band.  As interesting as Crowley's story is, what is lacking here, at least for me, is the story of the cast itself.  Crowley's play would have been just another play had it not been for his cast.  Although the writing is excellent, what elevates The Boys in the Band to cult status, what makes it unforgettable viewing, is its cast of fantastically gifted actors.  Once you have seen these performances, you will never forget them.  They are the gay equivalent of Bette Davis in All About Eve, Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard or Giulietta Masina in La Strada.  You keep coming back for repeated viewings.  Yet the documentary sheds no light whatsoever on the lives of these actors.  We are given snippets of information here and there, so minute that it is practically nonexistent.  Kenneth Nelson, Cliff Gorman, Leonard Frey, Keith Prentice, and Frederick Combs are hardly mentioned, and the mysterious Reuben Greene remains a total mystery.  In a heartbreaking segment, we are told, very briefly, that Robert LaTourneaux ended up selling himself for $100 to whomever was willing to pay for his services, but this is not explored nor is it elaborated on any further.  The life changing effect that playing these characters had on these actors is hardly touched upon, neither are their tragic deaths from AIDS.  This is an unforgivable flaw of this documentary given that there is practically no information available anywhere on the lives and careers of these great actors, who achieved both immortality and infamy by playing these parts. Luckily, Lawrence Luckinbill and Peter White, two of the three cast members still alive, offer their own versions of events.  In Luckinbill's case, his recollection of the kissing scene between Larry and Hank varies slightly from director William Friedkin's, but this is no big deal, as in Hollywood, reality is in the eye of the beholder anyway, and actors tell their tales, and directors tell theirs, and the truth is somewhere in between.  The beginning of the film is a sad reminder that the blissful ignorance and the globalization of trash that has overcome the straight world is also prevalent in gay life.  Young gays are asked if they are familiar with The Boys in the Band, and they are all dumb and clueless, a pathetic reminder of the decline and fall of the American empire.  I'm sure they have no clue about Stonewall either, just like black children today have no clue that Lincoln freed the slaves.  This is a good documentary, but it is not what I would have preferred.  The fans of The Boys in the Band would have been better served if more time had been devoted to The Boys and less to Mr. Crowley.  A 50-50 ratio would have been perfect.  As it is, we get all about Mart and very little about the wonderful, unsung talents that brought his characters to life.  To anyone interested in reveling in the magnificent work of these nine actors, I strongly recommend purchasing or renting the original 1970 film of The Boys in the Band which is available on DVD. And to anyone interested in gay history I also recommend the marvelous documentary Brother Outsider, The Life of Bayard Rustin, a fascinating portrait of the black, gay man behind the civil rights movement.",1322438400,16,4239,4.619492656875835

He is a very interesting character who had many exciting experiences during the heyday of the 60s and 70s, but I believe most of us we're curious to hear much more information about the different actors that played in this historic film.

This was followed by the film which had a very limited release. So it was so good to finally be able to see how the play was put on and how game the producers were in the first place, the fight they had to put up to finally see it hit the stage world wide.

4571051,2,B00551QQHK,"when i first read about this dvd i was sooo excited as Boys in the Band is one of my all time favorite movies just as it is for so many older gay men. and i saw a trailer that showed a scene with the 'cowboy' actor with 'emory' that looked interesting (its not even in the final film sad to say so i have no idea what it was about) but the dvd is filled with so many others stories about Natalie Wood, hollywood parties, beach house parties with Roddy Mcdowell, etc but i was hoping for more actual behind the scenes of the movie. it does give us a little info that maybe some didn't already know but it felt like there was 15 mins of 'new info' filled with other stories to make a feature length here. i mean we hear Mr Crowley in his dragged out way of telling the same story heard over n over on the subject of the dvd release of the original movie to 'theater talk' program but nothing really new. i wanted to hear more about the actors and what happened to them after n during the making of the film and there is a few mins of that like an interview with the actor that played the 'cowboy' but thats like maybe 5 mins. then the 2 surviving actors chat a few mins here n there but  the way Crowley drags out the stories of him n Natalie Wood which for the first 5 mins was ok but its like they inserted these little stories to fill out the film for time and after viewing it i knew little more than what i knew before i watched the dvd. so if u find it for a few dollars i would get it but i wouldnt spend 20.00 to watch it. just fluff filled out with a handful of interesting stories dragged out for 90 mins that i could have told in 15.",1366502400,8,1642,3.9457831325301207

4571054,4,B00551QQHK,"I watched this documentary with a bit of nostalgia, ache, joy, and ultimately gratitude.  The younger men interviewed all pleaded ignorance of The Boys in the Band.  As a man who first saw it in my freshman year of college at the college union's movie night and had to listen to the snears and snickering of some of the people in the room, I was brought back to those mid to late 60's when I was only beginning to understand the sexual struggles that were emerging for me.  And I remember being both angered at and affirmed by the Boys in the Band.  The people interviewed expressed similar hate/love relationships to that movie, and Making the Boys captures the sitz im leben (life situation) of gay people in those times.  The fact that huge advancements have been made doesn't diminish the importance of films such as this which capture the times and many of the key figures of the gay liberation struggles.  Thanks again to Mart Crowley and all those brave enough to make the Boys. Boys of 2013 - take note and be grateful!",1360022400,2,1027,4.524324324324325

4571057,4,B00551QQHK,"The parts of this movie that tell about the gay world before and after the production of the play and then the movie The Boys in the Band - and the broad range of reactions to them within the gay world - are interesting and meaningful. Unfortunately, those parts make up something less than half of the movie.

Most of the movie is about Mart Crowley, who wrote the play, and he's whiny, self-centered, and not interesting at all. With the luck that guy had - a pampered Southern Belle who somehow became the toast of Hollywood and Natalie Wood's best friend and then wrote a groundbreaking play despite his total lack of interest in anything or anybody but himself - he should be thanking God instead of whining.

I can think of many things I'd rather do with an hour than spend it watching and listening to Mart Crowley. The other parts of this movie really are interesting though, and they make the Crowley parts just bearable. Celebrity queens may love the Crowley parts even though I didn't.",1344902400,,996,4.558659217877095

4571059,5,B00551QQHK,"In my Amazon review of the film, ""The Boys in the Band"" I noted that the work has always been highly controversial among gay men and that there are just as many people who praise it for its honesty, humor and status as a ground-breaking film, as there are people who condemn it for its stereotypes and self-hating negative images.  In that review, I attempted to explain the many reasons why I believe the play and the film were important developments in the history of gay culture.  As most people know by now, The Boys in the Band is about eight gay men at a birthday party who are joined by an unexpected straight guest.

Now there is a documentary, produced and directed by Crayton Robey, called  ""Making The Boys - The Story Behind The Boys in the Band"" which chronicles the complete history of the play and film and their impact on modern gay literature and the gay movement.

Mart Crowley, the playwright, began his career with no money, but many important connections.  Frequently a guest at Roddy McDowell's star-studded Malibu beach-house parties, Mr. Crowley rubbed elbows with everyone who was anyone in mid-1960's Hollywood circles.  Old color home-movies of these parties reveal the presence of such luminaries as Rock Hudson, Sal Mineo, Julie Andrews, Jane Fonda, Lauren Bacall, Tuesday Weld, Judy Garland and Natalie Wood.  As it happened, Crowley became very close friends with Natalie Wood and then wrote a play for her about identical twin sisters, one of which is a lesbian.  Natalie was game but no one would produce it.  Later, also through Natalie Wood, he managed to get a job as screenwriter for the pilot episode of a TV series starring Bette Davis, which was not picked up.  Crowley soon found himself washed up, broke and trying to break into the New York theatre.  Coming from a dysfunctional family, Crowley wanted to write about his life experiences, but felt that Tennessee Williams and Eugene O'Neil had already covered much of the dramatic possibilities concerning families with an alcoholic father and a drug-addicted mother.

At the time, many critics were complaining that reputed gay playwrights such as Tennessee Williams and Edward Albee were writing plays about homosexuals and disguising them as heterosexuals.  Mart Crowley read one comment, ""Why don't those people just write about themselves?"" and he thought, ""That's a good idea"".

Not too long later, he found himself with the finished manuscript of the play, The Boys in the Band.  Again, through Natalie Wood, he managed to get the play to the Playwright's Unit, a theatre workshop funded by writers and directors and headed by Edward Albee.  Although Albee hated the play and felt it ""did damage"" to the burgeoning gay movement, several other members of the Playwright's Unit, including Robert Moore who eventually directed the play, saw its commercial potential.

Opening on January 23, 1968, The Boys in the Band was a smash success, attracting not only gay audiences.  Many famous actors and other celebrities were soon clamoring for tickets.  Due to its unanticipated success, the play moved uptown to a larger theatre, and dared to charge the unheard-of top ticket price of $8.  Edward Albee says that The Boys in the Band transformed Mart Crowley into ""The Toast of Broadway"" and we learn that the play ran for five years.  The documentary includes many stories about the celebrities who came to see it.  At one point, Mart Crowley relates how Marlene Dietrich not only loved the show, she took the whole cast out to Sardi's Restaurant for dinner.

Making The Boys carefully paints a vivid picture of what straight people thought of gay men at that time.  Clips from a vintage CBS Reports episode with Mike Wallace make it clear that gay people in 1968 were on a social par with ""practitioners of necrophilia and bestiality"" and more than one contributor states that gays were ""virtually invisible"" when the play was written.  These opinions are contrasted by views of younger gay people, many who have never heard of the play or the movie, and take for granted the relatively open times and comparative freedom we enjoy today.  With commentaries by gay historians and authors Eric Marcus and Charles Kaiser, gay columnists Dan Savage and Michael Musto, actors Robert Wagner (Natalie Wood's widower) and original cast members Laurence Luckinbill and Peter White, Making The Boys captures a very thorough and extremely accurate reflection of the prevailing attitudes of the late 1960's.  One interviewee opines that the play was ""shocking"" and the film includes interviews with a dazzling array of gay playwrights, including Edward Albee, Paul Rudnick, Terrance McNally, Tony Kushner, and Larry Kramer.  These experts make it plain that Boys in the Band, for better or worse, was a groundbreaking piece that opened the door for other gay plays that followed.  In fact, playwright Terrance McNally muses at one point, ""Who knows if I ever would have ever written The Lisbon Traviata and Love! Valor! Compassion!..."" without The Boys in the Band?

The documentary includes extensive interviews with the director of the filmed version of Boys in the Band, William Friedkin, and before it concludes, it also provides details on the death by AIDS of the original director, Robert Moore, and four of the original cast members (Robert LaTorneaux, Leonard Frey, Kenneth Nelson and Frederick Combs).

In its day, The Boys in the Band was dismissed by many as outdated and criticized for reflecting negative stereotypes.  The play's overall message was that we must learn to love ourselves before we can ever be accepted by society in general.  This message was overlooked by many in the gay audience, until the careful scrutiny of hindsight and the perspective of time (the whole point of this documentary) allows us to see it for what it was - a reminder of who we were and how far we have come.

Highly recommended.",1339545600,13,5913,4.968527918781726

This documentary film is a treat for anyone who has been moved by the play or film version of ""The Boys in the Band"". That could be anyone in theory, I suppose, but in reality that will mean gay men of a certain age, who happened to see the piece at a time when there was a desperate shortage of gay representation on stage or screen. We all know the stories about how the piece has dated, and how it was out of sync with the ethos of the post-Stonewall era. Many of the younger generation who dismiss it as simply too bitchy and full of self-loathing need to ask themselves if they subject the same barometer to the likes of ""Will & Grace""; if so they may unearth the tip of a larger iceberg that has little to do with ""The Boys in the Band"" per se.

The treat with this wonderful documentary is that the subject material is being given the time and attention that it needs. You really get a sense (thanks to home movies, and other archival matierial) of what was going on in the 1960s. One of the great tragedies of gay history (even history as recent as the 1960s and 70s) is that it has so often been lost for ever. There's so little evidence that gay men and lesbians even existed during those times. This documentary, apart from other things, redresses this vaccuum.

I think it would be wonderful if more feature length documentaties were made about important pieces of popular culture, be that a play, a book, a writer, a film, a TV show... whatever! I can imagine Harpo Productions doing a great doco on ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"", as that has long been a personal favourite of Oprah's. I can't wait for what's next.",1331856000,3,1774,4.716129032258064
