I have TIVO and my 17-month old son loves Elmo so recorded episodes of Sesame Street is free and stored on DVR. Since this DVD was a 2008 release, I thought it was new but was disappointed to find out that I already have it recorded! I guess it's still good to have for grandma's or the babysitter's house but other than that, it's kind of boring and my son was not happy.",1219449600,,480,4.285714285714286

3136794,5,B00151QYAI,Elmo is very funny. Baby loves it and I have to say that Elmo character makes some comments and jokes that only an adult would understand. I find him very entertaining compared to Barney and Tellitubies. I would pick watching Elmo anyday over the other children DVDs.,1214006400,,267,4.702127659574468
3136795,4,B00151QYAI,"Personally, I can think of anyone else I'd less want to spend my summer vacation with than red, fuzzy, whiny Elmo, but I think there are a lot of 3 and 4 year-olds who would strongly disagree with me.

In keeping with the ""Elmo's World"" series, this hour-long show gives kids tips about new experiences, in this case, how to have a fun summer vacation.  Ernie and Bert tell kids how to protect their skin (and eyes) from UV rays; Elmo talks about going to the beach, learning how to spread a towel, and even how to use a camera and preserve happy memories of the long summer months. Many parents will be thankful for the pro-sunscreen messages, as they try to lather their kids up under the broiling sun this summer. (ReadThatAgain kid's reviews)",1211155200,5,746,4.518518518518518

3136798,5,B00151QYAI,"Elmo's World - Summer Vacation covers beaches, skin, and cameras. I don't get how cameras specifically relate to summer, since I personally use cameras no matter what the season, but that segment has to be by far one of my two year-old son's favorite Elmo's World segments. He frequently requests to see that segment and has become fascinated with my camera collection.

As a person who can burn easily, and my son inheriting my skin tone, I appreciate the attention given to skincare and proper sun protection. I've even found my son to be slightly more accommodating when I'm putting lotion on him. I hope his improved attitude continues because protection from the sun is important to me and I'm glad Elmo agrees!",1361145600,,716,4.821138211382114

Instructions say to use cold-warm water, dry on low heat and never use bleach or it will ruin the waterproofing layer.
