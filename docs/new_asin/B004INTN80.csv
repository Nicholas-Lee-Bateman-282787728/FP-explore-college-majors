8431041,4,B004INTN80,I loved Davey and Goliath as a kid and now my children can watch them as well.  Great life lessons and entertaining.  Check out a Christian book site for much better prices!,1330473600,,173,4.375
8431042,5,B004INTN80,"I have a high-functioning, autistic son, who somehow found a clip of Davey and Goliath on YouTube and kept demanding more.  When I found these on DVD, I couldn't resist.  He watches them regularly, and some he can recite the entire script of the show.  Great life lessons still apply.",1319500800,,284,4.64
8431043,5,B004INTN80,"The Episodes in this volume, information I got from Bridgestone Media Group are: ""Down on the Farm"", ""Man of the House"", ""The Waterfall"", ""Happy Landing"", ""Editor and Chief"", and ""Bully up a Tree"". For some reason the volumes at Bridgestone Media Group are different than the volumes we get here. They have different episodes in their volumes compared with ours(Amazon's).
They also sound like they don't have the specials either. I don't know if this vol. 5 is one of theirs or a different one. I don't know if we are getting a special or not. I would have liked to have gotten the Easter special.",1297900800,2,598,4.650943396226415
