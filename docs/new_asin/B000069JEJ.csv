7965917,5,B000069JEJ,"Lauris Elms as Azucena is worth the price of this DVD.  She is the best I have ever heard (and I have heard a lot of Azucena's in my day!).  Ms. Sutherland was a bit past her prime in this role.  She sounded so much better in her earlier recordings.  My five star rating is for Ms. Elms. The richness of her voice is so lovely, you will wish that she had recorded more operas.  But, be thankful that we have this.

While the production was not lavish, I found it interesting that they had Azucena sitting down while she sang her first aria.  That's another round of applause for her...........singing this demanding role is difficult enough while standing, but sitting down takes a Master.  And that she is.",1519948800,,707,4.426356589147287

7965921,2,B000069JEJ,"This review is from one who loves Il Trovatore and is also a great Sutherland fan.  This DVD does little for her legacy.  Of course, if she had never recorded her London audio set with Pavarotti, or had no other DVDs at all, then it might be of some value.  As it is, it's simply a tedious bore to sit thru, not because Sutherland is doing a terrible job, but just because the overall production is so clumsy, dimly lit, and poorly recorded.

Apart from Sutherland, I would like to pay tribute to the fine singing actress who played Azucena, but who she was, alas, I cannot say.  There is no cast list anywhere, either on the front cover, back cover, insert, or on the opening or closing credits.  There is a list of names, but who plays what part is not given.  (If I were one of these principals, I would not be happy.)  Anyway, whoever Azucena was, she played the part well, suitably unhinged without being too hammy.

The chorus also was surprisingly excellent, very well rehearsed, and with excellent diction.  The only problem is they just generally stood in place--there was not much stage direction.  The setting of the opera was also moved from the 1400s up to around the 1880s--the soldiers looked like a bunch of Prussians in their double breasted uniforms, gold braid and iron crosses.  Sorry but I like the composer and can only picture the story as medieval Spain.

The rest of the company was adequate regional theater material, not meant to be an insult, just that inserting Sutherland into such a group is like having fine wine with your hotdogs.  Visually, the Count di Luna (a Brad Pitt type) could have switched with Manrico (a non-Brad Pitt type).  Sutherland of course was excellent in her limited scenes.

I could sit thru only til Di Quella Pira, after which I had to give up for personal sanity reasons, so if there are any major revelations in Act IV, I am unaware.

So in summary:  (1) if you like Sutherland in Il Trovatore (and you should) ... better stick with audio only, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/London-set/dp/B000N4SJI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">London set</a>&nbsp;with Pavarotti (and if you get the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LPs/dp/B00Q50V6LG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LPs</a>, they include the ballet music!).  (2) If you want Sutherland in a decent video, try the Met&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lucia/dp/B000B8ISPK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lucia</a>, Australian Opera&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lakm/dp/B000FII2E8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lakm</a>, or the Canadian Opera&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norma/dp/B00005AAET/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norma</a>.  And (3) if you want a decent Trovatore video, with anyone--that is actually problematic at this point.  I could only recommend the Met&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pavarotti-Zajick/dp/B000050X30/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pavarotti / Zajick</a>.",1424131200,2,3138,6.217592592592593
7965922,5,B000069JEJ,"I can't imagine what some of the reviewers on this page are on!  Trovatore has never been my favourite Verdi opera, but this whole performance is brilliant! I agree that the stage is too dark - it's one thing to emphasise the doom and gloom with the lighting etc., but it would still be nice to be able to actually see!. You could really only see the action taking place with the one - or sometimes two people in the actual spotlight. Other than that, a great deal of peripheral action was just missed.

BUT - and it's a BIG but! The costume design was absolutely fantastic - for everyone, but especially for Sutherland. In my eyes, she can NEVER do any wrong - end of story - but quite often in her roles, she is dressed so badly that it is occasionally distracting. Here though, she looks really lovely - whoever designed the costumes found exactly the right way to dress her, to bring out the very best. That goes for all the characters as well.
Our Joanie could not ever be described as a conventional good looker, certainly not a beauty, but she exudes her own  individual brand of beauty, which comes from her lovely personality, and the genius that she was. I've never understood how people could be distracted from her singing,  by how she looked. To my eyes, she IS beautiful , and every time I watch her, I am struck by how such a wonderful and gifted person, found the courage to overcome the modern obsession with 'looks' and 'perfection', and just ignored it -and the cruel things that some people felt obliged to say about her. I am also struck by her grace - she is not a conventional beauty, nor is she a great actress (though she isn't as bad as some people complain), but she IS just the greatest singer ever, and she does move gracefully. She also has very pretty hands and eyes. But honestly, if you just listen to her, who cares what she looks like?

I first found this production on YouTube, and watched it through - had no idea in which year it was done, until the end - and I was trying throughout to guess how old she might have been. I ended up thinking that she must have been late forties, based on her voice, and her looks. I have a lots of recordings of Sutherland, and some of them come from her later days, and it is clear that she is getting close to the end of her career, but even then when her voice isn't what it was, it still outshines almost everyone else, and there are still those moments of breath-taking brilliance, which always make whatever she does, whatever stage she was at, a joy to listen to. But in this production, I found no trace at all of the signs that her voice was getting tired.  She herself would have retired earlier than she did, had wanted to stop singing before she actually did, but she was persuaded to go on for longer, and thank goodness she was - it has left us with an extension of her record, that we otherwise would not have had.

The other notable mention is Lorin Elms as Azucina - who was simply wonderful, a real stand-out - but I have to say that although the names  - apart from Sutherland - are not well known, the singing across the board was absolutely first rate.  Couldn't decide whether Manrico absolutely hit the high C that Pavarotti was so famous for - it might have been transposed down a semitone - but if it wasn't a high C it was darned close - enough for it  not to matter.
Those who didn't enjoy this production really are not likely to enjoy much opera at all unless it is dished up with plastic beauties and handsome tenors - and probably some awful, high-fallutin, rubbish-y background as is the case with the Jonas Kaufmann  Trovatore production - a bit like Rhinegold set in a power station, or Aida set in a lake with the chorus wearing High-viz jackets and carrying buckets and mops, and characters singing on separate gantries maybe a third of a mile apart, and a hundred feet up, and people being ferried by boat from one part of a scene to another!!  Incomprehensible!!",1397174400,,3972,4.374491180461329
7965923,2,B000069JEJ,"I had to force myself to get through this thing, and it took several days to do it.  Not even Sutherland could save this turkey.  If you like this opera (and I don't), then I highly recommend this production.  Everyone in it was outstanding.  I had this on CD with Callas many years ago and wound up chucking it.  I hated it.  The tenors and Sutherland each and together have a few good moments, but not enough to make a 2 hour and 20 minute opera out of.  The mezzo gypsy did her part well (the relief came during the final curtain call when she smiled and then she looked human and beautiful), but I greatly dislike Verdi's mezzo gypsies, and his operas are littered with them.  Blood, guts, burnings at the stake, death, torment, Verdi at his finest.  All the gypsy woman did was suffer.  I read that Sutherland was 60 when she filmed this, and she could still do it.  Only she does it better when she's got something to do it with.",1103932800,2,935,4.285714285714286
7965924,4,B000069JEJ,"Much produced by the Australian Opera Company leaves me dissatisfied. Whether a lack of regional talent or a generally mismanaged company, productions are often artistically and technically slight, considering this company's position in a rather large nation-state that provides support to the arts. This TROVATORE disappoints for similar reasons. Having said that, to hear Sutherland as Leonora, at this stage of her career, in a live performance, is another affirmation of her position as (arguably) the world's greatest singer and makes this DVD well worth owning. Only Ponselle and Milanov were able to bring the limpid dolcissima to the fragile passages that Sutherland delivers here brilliantly, and of course, her coloratura is unsurpassed. Price brought a special shimmer to the role, but for only ten years. In this performance, Dame Joan is on the edge of her 60th birthday, and manages not only master-class legato in ""D'amor sull'ali rosee"" but achieves thrilling high notes that were beyond the reach of all the role's earlier, notable interpreters. The orchestral reading could use a little more octane from Bonynge, but for those who insist upon blood and brimstone Verdi, they should remember that TROVATORE is not NABUCCO or I LOMBARDI. This is a dark tale of love unfulfilled shadowed with the implicit suffering induced at all levels from religious and ethnic intolerance.",1091923200,12,1391,5.327272727272727
7965925,4,B000069JEJ,"The singing in this dvd is very good, I love Sutherland's Leonora and the Baritone is superb, singing I think the best every music written for that voice.
The production is awful; it is dark and gloomy and must have been an absolute nightmare for the performers and I am surprised there are no shots of people falling over on the stage; best to buy; play and close your eyes; even at such a late stage; Sutherland's voice is incredible and this role in particular shows off her amazing vocal agility; beautiful voice and trill to perfection!",1050192000,12,541,4.587628865979381
