I was surprised to find it with English subtitiles, and I definitely recommend it for those fans who still do no have little soccer balls running through their bloodstream.",1173312000,,245,4.6976744186046515
8097017,4,B000CCD1WK,"Soccer is the common thread between these three distinctly different stories. They are filmed in the Central, Northern and Southern parts of Chile. They portray the lives of men, boys, youth and oldies. They express violence, innocence and sheer joy. I liked the movies in the reverse order in which they were shown. They are extremely well directed and well acted. I would have given it five stars had it been technically superior. The sub titles move too fast for comfort; but so does the Chilean tongue! :-)",1168300800,2,510,4.806818181818182
