I felt this may be a bit elementary for me, but spouse selected title. I am pleased to say there was plenty to hold my interest and yes, I learned more new and helpful information for dealing w parent w dementia. Appropriate for family education, home caregivers and professional caregivers at all levels. I have purchased several of these DVD's and was concerned about ""overlapping"" content issues. While there does seem to be some, it serves as reinforcement / review but not excessive duplication. I am pleased w all the Teepa training I have purchased. She has recently launched a way to have CEU credits for many of the DVD's. Go to her site to find out how (her name and dot com). I am using to train and enhance skills of my paid at home caregivers. Very accessible to all skill levels and care settings. And will keep you finding some humor in the tragedy of dementia; also a necessary skill for caregiver survival. Buy and share as many as you are able to afford. Highly recommend.",1364169600,5,1137,4.578431372549019

8474733,5,B005IGV7DK,You need to watch them several times you will pickup something helpful each time. I wish the public and even the medical professions would be more aware any caring about people with Azheimers. I believe if we change the name of this disease it might help it sounds like old timer disease and that's not true. Maybe we can increase funding for a cure if we call it neurological brain cancer after all what is cancer it is the body destroying its own organs. Is the brain an organ? For sure and what is the body doing to it  destroying it!,1410566400,,537,4.316831683168317
