4309756,3,B004AJDEBO,"""The Sacred Blacksmith"" anime series makes its way to the US courtesy of FUNimation Entertainment.

Based on the Japanese light novel series by Isao Miura, with original character designs by Luna, a total of nine volumes have been published by Media Factory under their MF Bunko J label (targeted towards young adult males, the J stands for juvenile).  Meanwhile a manga adaptation began its serialization in 2009 in the monthly manga magazine ""Monthly Comic Alive"" and in October 2009, a 12 episode anime series by Manglobe aired on AT-X through December.

The anime series is directed by Masamitsu Hidaka (""Linebarrls of Iron"", ""I Dream of Mimi"", ""Pokemon Advance""), a screenplay adaptation by Masashi Suzuki (""Hell Girl"", ""Shuffle!"", ""Akane Maniax"") and character design by Jun Nakai (""Tokyo Majin"").

""The Sacred Blacksmith"" takes place in a land that was once ravaged in the great Valbanill War.  During that time, humans sacrificed their bodies to become powerful demons in which they would turn into Demon Contracts (weapons).  These weapons have long been banned.

The story begins with a 3rd generation Knight named Cecily Campbell.  She has sworn herself to protect the city from harm and corruption but one day, she sees a former Knight that looks out of it and screaming for ""salvation"".  When she goes to apprehend him, he strikes with a huge sword which breaks apart her family sword (that has been part of the Campbell generation for ages).

The Knight nearly kills her but he is stopped by Luke Ainsworth, a mysterious blacksmith who easily beats the Knight with his sword and his sword easily cuts through the Knight's sword with ease.

Unfortunately, Cecily's first encounter with Luke is not good as Luke criticizes her inability to fight and protect because she is weak.  As Cecily tries to find Blacksmith's to fix her sword, she quickly learns that no blacksmith has the experience to fix a broken sword but they can upgrade it.  But Cecily wants the same sword, more powerful, not a new sword.

Grateful for saving her life, Cecily goes to find this Blacksmith and finds out that he and a girl named Lisa live together and that he is a blacksmith.  Seeing how powerful his sword was in battle, Cecily wants Luke to fix her sword.  But Luke is unwilling.

While she leaves his home, a man in black turns a man into a demon which attacks Cecily.  Fortunately, Luke is there and Cecily sees Luke and Lisa use some sort of magic to create a sword which can be used to fight these demons in battle.

This begins an interesting friendship with three and soon enough, an even more interesting friendship when she meets a Demon Sword of Wind named Aria.  Aria has been in the property of the wrong men and she sees the kind heart of Cecily.  Cecily vows to protect everyone including Aria and both agree to form a bond in which Aria will now become the sword of Cecily.

But unbeknown to Cecily, many people are coming after her to gain possession of Aria.

""The Sacred Blacksmith"" features the main characters:

Cecily Campbell - The main protagonist.  Cecily is a 3rd generation Knight of the Campbell family.  She swore to protect the city but at the same time, she's not a great fighter and she is not a killer.  She believes in justice and protecting people.  She is often at odds with Luke but part of her likes him.  She is often praised for having big breasts.

Luke Ainsworth - The mysterious and talented Blacksmith and swordsman.  Known for his blue eyes and also living with a girl named Lisa, he often comes to aid in saving Cecily's life.  During battle, he can forge a katana.  Despite he and Cecily being opposites, he accepts her.  He vows to protect Lisa for some reason.

Lisa - An assistant to Luke who has elven ears and somehow has the ability to help Luke forge weapons using magic.  She cares deeply for Luke.

Aria - The demon sword of the wind who can turn human.  She is a peaceful woman who seeks for a peaceful woman who cares.  Her past has been filled with murder and carnage and she dreams of having an owner like Cecily.  The two bond and become very good friends.  Whenever in battle, she turns to sword form.

Other Characters:

Siegfried - The unknown man of darkness who is constantly cloaked and has been attacking Cecily and Luke for some reason.

VIDEO:

""The Sacred Blacksmith"" is presented in widescreen.  The first thing you notice is Jun Nakai's character designs.  As he worked on ""Tokyo Majin"", you can see his influence in this anime series with how the characters are created.  For the most part, the anime series looks very good and there is more emphasis on the characters than the art backgrounds.  Also, an emphasis on colors and lighting.

As for the overall anime production, for a new company that was started back in 2007 and has focused primarily on key animation, so far this company has done a pretty good job thus far (the other anime they have worked on are ""Hayate The Combat Butler"", ""Ergo Proxy"" and ""House of Five Leaves"").  But part of the reason why I enjoy the animation for ""The Sacred Blacksmith"" was its emphasis on character expressions and although the backgrounds were not super-detailed, still, the lighting and focus on character closeups helped a lot in this series, especially during the action sequences.

Subtitles are in English.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The Sacred Blacksmith"" is an entertaining anime series that provides a good amount of action and humor.  If anything, adventure anime series fans, also those who love mystical type of storylines will enjoy this series.

The characters are fun and interesting and because it focuses on four primary characters, with only 12 episodes, the series dedicates enough story to develop the characters and their friendship.  Of course, it will seem a bit derivative of other anime series in which the main female and male character are constantly bickering at each other, yet they care for one another.  A common theme in anime series and no different with ""The Sacred Blacksmith"" but the main difference is that the series focuses on a mystical blacksmith and swordfighting and demon weapons that turn human.  Definitely an interesting storyline.

Although ""The Sacred Blacksmith"" looks like a safe anime adventure series, it's important to note that it does have a mature theme (thus the mature rating).

Part of the running gag of the series is Cecily's breasts.  It appears that many of the women are flat-chested and thus, look at Cecily's breasts as significant.  And so there will be times where her armor breaks off and it exposes her bare front chest.  Also, with the American dub, the dialogue tends to have a more mature theme as Cecily will be seen screaming some not so bad vulgarities but with the nudity and language, definitely not a series to watch with the younger viewers.

Overall, ""The Sacred Blacksmith"" is an entertaining and short anime series.  Once again, it's only 12-episodes long and doesn't require too much of your time.  For collectors, there is a special limited edition of this set being released which comes with a 32-page artbook and special box.

If you are looking for a fun, action-packed anime series that doesn't require too much of your time, definitely give ""The Sacred Blacksmith"" a try!",1296259200,29,7570,4.821289821289821

There is some light fan service attempts and the series seems to teeter on being either serious or light hearted, but in the end it leaves you hoping for a 2nd season.

4309770,4,B004AJDEBO,"Fun show.. It saddly has a few cliches that have been done several times before... Also seems to focus to much on the main characters breasts. Oh quick warning there is some nudity, all but one scene was pointless and were there just for nudities sake. Only 4 or so scenes like that so don't let it hurt your purchase. The one that worked though was funny so I let it slide even though it could be removed and nothing would really be left out. Also before I go on... I don't know how many of you noticed but the lead is the only female member of the knights guard with breast cups in her chest plate.

The show has a good plot with good characters. Its short comings come from the cliches. Like the jerk who the lead falls in love with, I think this is rectified a bit simply by how they explain his general behavior but he takes a while to become likeable.
Waaaay to much talking about the leads boob size... Seriously it is annoying at times but other times it can be funny... Oddly every time a male character refers to them it's actually funny or acceptable. It's probably because it is less common and doesn't feel forced.
Katana worship... Yeah... Lots of that. The funny thing is that the show writers seemed to put some research into the making of a katana but failed to do any on the other swords in the show. Katanas are neat swords but they are not as great as this show makes them out to be.
Bathhouse scene with 5 girls... Yeah goes about the same route any other would minus the pervert guys. Seriously there is only one perverted male in this show and he's only in the first episode the girls are the real perverts in this one.",1460160000,,1642,4.262820512820513

4309787,4,B004AJDEBO,"Overall I thought this was a well done anime. The animation, music, characters were well done and keep me watching through all twelve episodes. Why I didn't give it 5 stars is that halfway through the overall storyline/mystery it takes a left turn for a few episodes that makes the pace change.
Now I've noticed that you usually have a character ""game changer"" after 5 or 6 episodes and the next one would be a humorous ""take a breath"" episode. And this happened. No problem. But then the sudden side episodes occur and your suddenly left with few too episodes to get a proper rap-up.

4309790,4,B004AJDEBO,"Sacred Blacksmith: The Complete Series good adaptation of of a short story Manga.

 A manga adaptation by Ktar Yamada started serialization in the seinen manga magazine Monthly Comic Alive on March 27, 2009. The first tankbon was published June 23, 2009. A 12 episode anime adaptation by Manglobe studios aired from October 3, 2009 to December 19, 2009.[1][2]",1373328000,,359,5.172413793103448
4309791,5,B004AJDEBO,"This is a great dvd set. If your looking for something with a serious tone and bite to it while also being comical, this is definitely the series for you",1368057600,,153,4.133333333333334
4309792,2,B004AJDEBO,"There are many things I can forgive an anime for:  poor plotting, subpar animation, bad music.  Anime is a constantly evolving medium, just as any other, so of course styles change.  Something ""so cool"" in 1990 may not be as slick or stylish as something made in 2010, but there could be a redeeming value.

I'm finding it rather hard to find a redeeming value in The Sacred Blacksmith (Seiken no Katanakaji), which was made in 2009.  Based upon an ongoing light novel series by Isao Miura, The Sacred Blacksmith chronicles the adventures of Cecily Campbell, newly minted Knight Guard for the Independent Trade City of Housman.  As misfortune has it, Cecily falls into possession of the Demon Sword of Wind (Aria), and things go poorly for her thereafter.

As I understand things, the Cecily we see in the anime and the Cecily of the novel series are opposites.  Cecily of the anime is borderline criminally incompetent, unable to wield a sword or strategize, and spends a lot of time embarrassed.  I can forgive this, lord knows some of the...compromises I've had to make on shows.  And she does gradually improve, plus her determination and loyalty is faultless.

I cannot forgive, however, the poor pacing or the haphazard conjunction of slapstick comedy in the first half of the episode followed by deep dark secrets for the plot.  Or vice versa, depending on how the episode ends.  The show itself is set up in kind of arcs-Cecily meeting Aria, Cecily defending Aria from Princess Charlotte, and lastly The Truth.  I won't say much more than The Truth for the last arc, because it would be a bit of a spoiler.  When the show stays on track, it's thoroughly engaging and interesting.  When the show strays into five minutes of boob jokes or angst over whether he likes me or not, in the middle of somewhat important plot points, it gets aggravating.

It's rather telling that we don't learn what the series title refers to until episode 10.

This isn't to say there aren't good points to the anime.  It has been a while since I watched a truly fantasy oriented anime like The Sacred Blacksmith (dubbed, at least), and I was intrigued by the greater majority of the world's mythology.  But 12 episodes?  12 poorly paced episodes?  It frustrated me more often than it gave me answers.

As for the dubbing, it's hit or miss on the characters.  I thought Luke and Lisa were well cast, but Aria sounded a little too old for her appearance and mannerisms.  Realizing she's (much) older than she looks, the voice still felt...off.  Cecily's was alternately okay and unenjoyable (mostly when she'd screech at Luke).  Funimation's translation was fine, though I do wonder at some of the insistence to constantly repeat things (Cecily seems incapable of just saying ""My name is Cecily."" Instead it's almost always ""My name is Cecily Campbell, Knight Guard for Housman!"").",1360540800,,2865,4.793877551020408
4309793,4,B004AJDEBO,"I've never seen this show before and it never interested me until I started watching the episodes online in english dub. I was actually surprised by the series and knew I had to have it. I had a chance to get the limited edition which I would still like to have just for the art booklet that was issued within it. But I digress, The show was great and the animation was nicely done. I actually like the whole demon sword turning human and sword which I really enjoyed. I haven't finished this series because I haven't had time but I can't wait to see what happens next. Great product and nice artwork all around.",1351123200,,612,4.3304347826086955

She becomes friends with Luke and begs him to forge a magic katana for her. An mystery man is unleashing demons on the land. Cecily and Luke must fight to protect their country from the evil demons.

This series is well made. It has good animation, voice actors, and a good soundtrack. There are plenty of good characters, laughs, and action. The story is pretty solid as well. It doesn't finish though. It was released in 2009, so there may be a possibility for a 2nd season. I liked this series and I recommend it to any anime fan. I believe it's worth 4 stars b/c it leaves ya hanging. However, if they finish it it'll probably get 5 stars. I can't give 5 stars to an unfinished work. Even so it's still worth watching.",1350518400,2,878,4.386503067484663
4309795,3,B004AJDEBO,"As a huge anime and fantasy fan I preordered this limited edition dvd set when I first heard about it.  The story is basically that a young inexperienced knight named Cecily Cambell comes into contact with a blacksmith named Luke Ainsworth.  After she is rescued by Luke from a psychotic swordsman, she begins to pester him to make a katana for her.  They quickly become occupied by fighting mysterious monsters that begin appearing, and from here the story really picks up.  Unfortunately it's dropped off a cliff by the ending. Cecily begins as a somewhat annoying character, it doesn't help that most of the jokes in the series focus on her breasts, but ultimately you do start to care for her.  Ultimately though she doesn't accomplish anything.  The ending seems like they were hoping to get a second season to continue, but they really should've focused on making the first one something that fans would want to come back to.  However, if you don't mind the fact that the series is really open ended, or that most of the humor is really sexist/perverted, then I'd recommend it.  If you have the option I'd recommend the limited edition for all the neat extras (the art booklet and artbox).",1347840000,,1195,4.739130434782608

Also, this series does leave you with questions that are unanswered which is why a second season would be great to have.

4309801,5,B004AJDEBO,"Lets keep this simple, you have probably already read summaries of the plot so im skipping that.
Some things you need to know going in:
a general rule of thumb with any anime is think of it as ""game logic"". Lots of people have complained that luke cut through another persons sword with his katana. Is it unrealistic? sure. but so are the demons and the setting and the people. lets not be so closed-minded okay? The way the official review describes this youd think it was clunky and kinda stupid. It isn't. the plot doesn't have a whole lot of time to develop (i mean come on, the whole series so far is only 12 episodes) But what you do see, in my case, wants me to come back for more. And it's not because of the fanservice, (which really isn't excessive, or even very present actually...) it is because for the first time in a long time i actually gave a crap about what happened to these people, i cared. not to mention the action is great, the dialogue (at least in japanese) is fun and entertaining or informative when it needs to be. My one complaint is that the bad guy is rather obvious. you take one look and you think ""thats him."" which kinda ruins the revealing of said bad guy. It is also necessary to point out that the reason it is so short is that the manga it is based off of is ongoing. So, where this story ends is about halfway through the existing manga. Just FYI.
Overall i really like this anime. thats why i bought it. I recommend scoping out anything you are interested in on a website like [...], where you can watch the whole series free, before purchasing anything.",1311120000,13,1595,4.32
4309802,5,B004AJDEBO,"Some anime you watch you want more of and you get so little and some you get more of and you want less (ahem... Hell Girl). The scared black smith has all the right elements. Comedy,drama,pretty girls, yadda yadda. However it's not something you've seen done to death which is very nice. The story was interesting and it wasn't predictable. Feels as though just when things are really about to start the series just ENDS abruptly. I felt the same way with Birdy Season 2. I really wanted more of the show and it just got cut short. Although there was some cheesiness in the Sacred Black Smith it wasn't overshadowed by the fact that people could be killed and death was apparent in their world.

 Matter of fact the only one that seems in the dark about reality is the main character Cecily who hesitates to kill a man as she stands there covered in his blood ashamed of herself. I think that's when I started to enjoy the anime. The main character was more realistic in her actions. Even when she wielded a powerful sword she wasn't unbeatable. Only through the episodes do we watch her hard work and practice pay off. She also begins to learn from her experiences she sufferers and in the end it starts to make her a better fighter. Still not ""Samurai X"" over night but you see her start to fight better and try harder. I respect that the most about this anime. You really watch the main character grow. She doesn't always know what to do and often at times she is confused but she listens to her friends and takes their advice. For once the concept of character development really shows through. Although Cecily was strong willed and outspoken from the start, she still had her flaws that she needed others to help her improve.

Another good thing I liked about this anime is the idea of the swords. ""SPOILER HERE"" if you don't want to know a major detail of the anime. The Demon Swords that are able to turn into people are why I feel the show needs a second season the most. Aira herself seemed like an interesting character that had a lot to tell about her past and the people that wielded her (also I would like to know why she seems to know so much about seducing men and love? When she's a sword"". Each sword that can turn human seems to be unlike the other. They really don't seem to have anything to do with one another. Even though they are so rare it's as though they don't care for one another. I wanted to know more about the Black flame sword ""Evadne"" who obviously is hiding something. I thought more would come from her encounter since she is shown standing in the opening credits alongside the main villains but nothing ever becomes of that. ""END SPOILER""

There's just too much to be stuffed into 12 episodes and this really needs a second season. However short what I saw so far I did enjoy.",1306627200,,2812,4.401923076923077
4309803,3,B004AJDEBO,"The Sacred Blacksmith is a medieval fantasy anime with knights, demons, spells, and magic. The main character Cecily Campbell is the daughter of a noble knight who died and thus passed the knighthood to her having no male heirs. Her Oath as a knight and her familys duty is to protect a neutral trade city that stands in the middle of a huge and powerful empire and several other minor countries. She is often praised for having large breast (almost in every episode it happens at least once) but she doesnt have any fighting skills as a knight and even breaks her familys sword that had been passed down through the generations. She is often saved by an EMO, antisocial, Sasuke-like (Naruto Fans anyone) blacksmith called Luke Ainsworth and his assistant Lisa who has the mysterious ability to summon a forge on the battlefield allowing Luke to craft Katana swords on the spot.

The world is filled with magic such as items called Demon Swords that can take the form of humans, Demon contracts that turn humans into demons, and prayer contracts that cure impurity, illness, and disease. This anime had alot of great potential with a very interesting background, catchy music, characters that grow on the viewer, and the potential to expand the main characters skills and journeys to many different areas. Sadly the story is only 12 episodes long (even in Japan) and it leaves all the characters in the beginning stages of their journey, skill level, and leaves the story unfinished.

I would recommend watching this on Netflix if your really interested in watching the series, any serious anime collector would be upset if they purchased an anime with no ending out and nothing planned for the future to create an ending.

Pros
-----------
- Characters are pretty good, they grow on the viewer as you keep watching the series
- Magic, spells, knights, swords, demons
- Great music
- Decent storyline
- Alot of potential to be a great anime

Cons
-----------
- The Story is not finished
- None of the characters have mastered their skills by the end of the series
- None of the character relationships have really blossomed yet by the end of the series
- Many unanswered questions left and journeys that could be embarked on by the end of the series.

Recommendation
-----------
Watch it on Netflix until they make a season 2, if they ever do to leave the fans with some kind of closure at least before you buy an incomplete anime series.",1304812800,3,2438,4.727058823529412
4309804,1,B004AJDEBO,I tried really hard to get into this anime but the main female character was just absolutely asanine and annoying that it repulsed me.,1304640000,,134,4.625
4309805,4,B004AJDEBO,"This show is actually quite a bit of fun. It's got some adult elements in it (several of the characters seem obsessed with breasts) so I wouldn't recommend it for children, but for young adults, it's really great. It's got really smooth action sequences, very pretty settings, and the characters have decently well-developed backgrounds for such a short series. The biggest problem I had with the show was the ending - probably the worst ending I've seen in an anime. It was really abrupt and didn't really answer your questions! But still a good show overall. The settings reminded me a little bit of a combination of Queen's Blade and Spice & Wolf. I would say that it's definitely worth watching!",1304467200,2,699,4.785123966942149
4309806,1,B004AJDEBO,"This review is tagged as ""spoiler free"" for one reason, and one reason only. There's nothing to spoil.

I'm not sure what everyone here is talking about. We probably didn't watch the same series because anyone who made it to the ending realized that this show had a cute little girl, a blacksmith with a Katanah, and a girl trying to be the very best. When I first started watching, that was enough to keep me. I didn't expect much. Then the last episode rolled around.

You know that feeling you get when there's suppose to be another 10-12 episodes but they ran out of money and decided to use it for a teaser to the manga (Claymore anime)?

That's Sacred Blacksmith. So if you want to spend your money on half a series, this is a great buy. Honestly the show wasn't popular when it aired and the story itself was mediocre at best so the chances of a second season are really slim to none. Even if one was made, it would just be the conclusion to this one so I would wait or just ignore this one completely.

If you decide to watch and/or buy the series anyway, please comment afterward to show that I'm completely correct.",1302134400,8,1125,4.3428571428571425
4309807,3,B004AJDEBO,"I want to be very clear when I say this anime is ok. It's very beautiful at times with the animation, and the emotion is there. I felt like the english voice for the main female character was a bit too over the top at times unfortunatly. There also wasn't too much character development outside of the the 3 main characters Luke, Lisa, and Cecily and considering this was only 12 episodes long I can see why. Even the stones that use mana were talked about very briefly, but where they come from or otherwise isn't present. That's the next problem, only 12 episodes and you only get to know fragments of the world they live in. The story is very cliched as well, the standard female character wants to protect everyone but cant without alot of support from her friends, really? I could name female protagonists off the top of my head who were more compeling then this girl, Lafiel from ""Crest of the Stars"" and Anna from ""Godannar"". You might be saying but those animes have more episodes, ok how about Haruka from ""Fooly Cooly"" and Falis from ""Murder Princess"" only 6 episodes and still much more interesting then this one.  I've seen a ton of anime in my life time and this one's only real intereting points are the demon/human swords and the blacksmith incantation swords. That's a problem when the most interesting things are the weapons. So the veterans will feel how I feel and be very nit picky with the story and presentation. If your new to anime I'd also recommend to you not to buy but rent this anime, being that there are only 12 episodes there is no way a real story could come out of this, it's easily forgettable. It is quite unfortunate that I have to say all this. If there were 26 episodes like there should have been, even then I'd probably say the same thing, since I didn't feel attached to any of the characters. I was quite excited when I saw previews of this anime from funimation, and to end in such an average manner slightly made me a bit angry, because I know the story isn't going to continue. So anyone who has Netflix, a way to rent this, or get it dirt cheap please do. It will save you the hardship of wondering if you should keep it or not. I saw it on Netflix first and usually if I like it enough I'd buy it, but that isn't even a thought in my head.",1302048000,5,2287,4.331002331002331
4309808,5,B004AJDEBO,All I can say is when is the next season coming out? The last episode leaves you wanting more and there are so many elements of the story you know are missing and want to see. Hopefully the next series will be out soon.,1300752000,,219,4.0
4309809,4,B004AJDEBO,"So far what I have seen puts this Anime above the norm for what comes out these days.

It is actually..... gasp fun to watch.

The characters are not typical at least in the main category.

Luke is your silent tough guy. But they tossed in his lack of composure around girls. Not the usual combination I see.

Cecily has some sex appeal, and from what I can tell she is supposed to actually be an adult. At least she's not built like an 11 year old girl like I have seen shown around in a lot of shows these days.

Spoiler warning don't read past here if you do not want to have one part ruined.

I was impressed by the attention to detail with Luke's eyes.

You'll learn later one one of his eyes is made of glass to replace a missing one. I went back and watched the early episodes and they had infact kept that true in the model. Just something I was surprised about.",1296259200,2,870,4.112426035502959

Sorry, but you need structure and limits on the story, on the characters, on the way magic works or does not work, not just pour everything into a bucket and see if it works.  Far, far, far too little is resolved, nothing is defined, and while the ride was fun, it was not thrilling.

8420321,3,B004AJDEBO,"There is enough reviews of the story out there. I'm just going to share what I liked.

Pros: The characters in the show are amazing and you are going to miss them when the show is over. They have pretty appealing personalities. Each one of them is developed pretty well over a SHORT series.

Cons: It's a pretty short series that doesn't really have a conclusion. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate panty and breast shots as much as any other anime dude an, but I feel like its somewhat awkward and forced in this show. It's here a few times and it just doesn't feel like it fits. It's like the animators added a few comments/shots because it was an anime. Like I said, I don't have a problem with that in anime (I have titles in my collection like HighSchool DxD, Cat Planet Cuties, Samurai Girls, So I can't Play H, etc.), it just doesn't fit in this story.",1508284800,2,861,4.308641975308642
