At the time of my posting, only two of the 29 customer reviews posted here actually applied to this item, which is the Deutsche Oper Berlin 1983 production starring Karan Armstrong and James King, NOT the bizarre Opera National du Rhin 2001 production starring Angele Denoke and Torsten Kerl addressed in the other 27 reviews. Someone needs to be more careful about cross-referencing reviews of similarly titled items.",1353196800,16,435,5.228571428571429
5243157,5,B00925T8YI,"Well, finally a production of this exquisite but neglected opera that I will keep!  I saw Carol Neblett  at city Opera, and iher performance stands in my mind as the best, but in terms of DVD's the is way ahead of the Opera du Rhin production, which was unmitigated Eurotrash.  King and Amstrong are both superb singers, and I loved the open ending.  By the way, no one seems to mention the Commedia del Arte elements which resemble ""Ariadne auf Naxos"", the arrival by boat and the fight for the key, from the Giulietta episode of ""Tales of Hoffmann"", and the ubiquitous presence of ""Robert Le Diable"".  I now own all thre three Amstrong performances available on DVD.",1352505600,4,668,4.627118644067797
5243158,5,B00925T8YI,"I agree, it's a great production and a must-have. However, this is NOT a TV production. It was a production created at the Deutsche Oper, it became part of its (at the time) vast repertoire (in those days, the Deutsche Oper presented more than 50 different operas per season), it was performed many times in Berlin before it was rented to the Vienna Staatsoper. So what you see in this DVD is actually a filmed stage performance that was at the time broadcast on German TV. More importantly, the previous reviewer says Brian Large directed this production. Brian Large, however, is not a stage director, but a video director. Claiming he did this production is like saying he did the legendary Bayreuth Chereau-""Ring"" (for which he also directed and edited the camera work at the filming). This ""Tote Stadt"" was directed by Gtz Friedrich, Karan Armstrong's husband and at the time the General Manager of the Deutsche Oper. Friedrich was one of the major figures of the early Regietheater movement, with groundbreaking productions at Covent Garden (the ""Ring"" from 1973 until 1976), at Bayreuth (""Tannhuser"" in 1972, one of the Festival's biggest post-war scandals, even though by today's standards the production seems almost traditional and certainly not shocking, later ""Lohengrin"", and ""Parsifal"") and at basically every other important European house, including the Salzburg Festival, Munich, Vienna, and Paris.",1351296000,12,1415,5.2105263157894735
5243159,5,B00925T8YI,"Korngold's once phenomenally successful opera, first performed simultaneously in the German cities of Hamburg and Cologne in 1920 when the composer was only 23 years old, is vividly brought to life in this superior German TV production, which was produced in 1983 by the Deutsche Oper Berlin opera company and was partly responsible for the gradual rehabilitation of this three-act opera in the European repertoire in recent times.

Freely adapted from Georges Rodenbach's 1892 novel ""Bruges-la-Morte"" by Erich and his father Julius (under the pen name ""Paul Schott""), the story of DIE TOTE STADT is simple: Paul (played by the late tenor James King, who resembles 1940s Belgian-born actor Victor Francen with his thin mustache), mourning over the loss of his beautiful blonde wife Marie in the Belgian city of Bruges, is ecstatic to encounter her exact double one day, the flirtatious opera dancer Marietta (played by soprano Karan Armstrong, who resembles a curvaceous and strawberry blonde version of Myrna Loy). After he invites Marietta to his home to sing and dance for him, she is surprised to find a giant portrait of Marie upstairs. After Marietta leaves to attend her rehearsal, Paul, torn by his loyalty to the deceased Marie and his longing for the living Marietta, imagines his brief, doomed romance with Marietta that will bloom and wither in the weeks to come. Most of the opera takes place as a fantasy in Paul's troubled mind, from the ghost of Marie (also played by Armstrong) appearing to Paul to encourage him to go out into life to a demonic church procession invading Paul's home the morning after Marietta has seduced Paul.

Mr. King is exceptional as Paul, the romantic yet obsessive and delusional protagonist. Under the direction of Gtz Friedrich, the Kansas-born James King delivers all his singing and acting prowess to create a meticulous and memorable portrayal of a lost soul. There are several individual and subtle elements that make his performance so appealing: the horizontal movement of his hand while describing the shimmering canal waters of Bruges in one of his more romantic arias, his charming stroking and inhaling a bouquet of red roses before Marietta's arrival, his misty eyes and dazed movements while reacting to the gorgeous and haunting aria ""Gluck, das mir verblieb"", and his defeatist sobs while arguing with Marietta during a highly dramatic confrontation. He's wonderful.

The Montana-born Karan Armstrong as Marie/Marietta exudes otherworldliness as the ghostly Marie as well as sex appeal and playfulness as Marietta. It's a difficult dual role, but she pulls it off very well with her tremendous lung power and sensual, well-shaped figure. Special mention should go to baritone William Murray in the dual role of Frank/Fritz, Paul's friend in reality and a Pierrot clown in Paul's fantasy, and mezzo-soprano Margit Neubauer as Brigitta, Paul's faithful housekeeper.

The production values are impressive, featuring a spacious and somewhat Expressionist interior for Paul's home in the first and third acts and a slightly flooded square of Bruges in the second act. The 1920s costume design, which includes double-breasted suits and homburg hats for the males and simple dresses for the females, is unassuming in the reality scenes yet colorful and opulent in Paul's fantasy. Kudos to the camera and editing crew members for using traditional cinematic techniques like close-up shots, zooms, dissolves, multiple exposures, and quick cuts in order to prevent the production from descending into a dully and amateurishly presented ""filmed play"" style.

For all its virtues, the production has its few flaws. Firstly, some passages from the German libretto and the music score are excised in order to accommodate a two-hour running time. Secondly, the Deutsche Oper Berlin orchestra is pretty competent yet it drowns out the singing voices of King and Armstrong once or twice throughout the opera (a very common mistake in the performing arts, nevertheless). Thirdly and most importantly, Friedrich has modified Korngold's original optimistic ending in favor of a more pessimistic ending, perhaps in order to prove Paul's extreme, obsessive love for the deceased Marie and his strong mental and emotional torment after experiencing such a vivid fantasy. But whether this modified ending is a good or bad decision by the director is up to the viewer to decide, and the aforementioned flaws can easily be ignored.

Incidentally, the two-disc RCA Victor recording of DIE TOTE STADT is worth purchasing, featuring Rene Kollo as Paul and Carol Neblett as Marie/Marietta under the conduction of Erich Leinsdorf with the Munich Radio Orchestra. This CD version is widely considered to be the best available recording of this forgotten opera and is the ideal companion piece for this DVD.

By all means, this TV production of DIE TOTE STADT is a must-see for all Korngold and opera fans. Let us give thanks to Arthaus Musik for finally releasing this production onto DVD at last!

5243160,2,B00925T8YI,"A great disappointment. I hesitated buying any DVDs of this particular opera because most of the reviews were negative. I bought this because there were several positive comments. There are good elements here but the cuts are unforgivable.  This is a standard length opera (i.e. non.-Wagnerian) so there is no excuse for any cuts. Most disastrous is the cut of Paul's Act 1 monologue which explains his dire emotional and mental state. King, Armstrong and the rest of the cast are wonderful but cannot compare with the splendors of the full-length Leinsdorf recording, which is surely one of the most powerful studio recordings of any opera. Put that recording on and you can picture what this video is lacking. Given that the bulk of the opera consists of hallucinations, the producers of this video missed out on giving us the full vision. A missed opportunity.",1417219200,3,863,4.951724137931034
5243161,5,B00925T8YI,"As some works once popular fall out of favor, others must wait for their time to come, or come again. Korngold's youthful opera on death obsession, mourning and healing had a brief vogue in the postwar '20s, but has spent most of its 90-odd years on the fringes of the repertory, despite occasional productions, one deluxe studio recording (Leinsdorf/RCA), and an excerpt that has become a concert perennial in both soprano solo and duet forms. There is evidence that DIE TOTE STADT's fortunes are changing these days, perhaps not only because of its lush score echoing Lehar and Richard Strauss but because stage directors are compelled by its story. Narrative parallels with Hitchcock's VERTIGO (also long underappreciated, today considered a cinematic pinnacle) have not gone unremarked upon.

First things first: This 2010 DVD from Helsinski is indispensable for the bravura performance of Klaus Florian Vogt in the demanding role of Paul, the young widower. Vogt is a tenor in his own category for his ability to make what at first blush sounds like a Mozart voice project in large venues and hold up to the requirements of roles such as Lohengrin, Siegmund, Parsifal. In those parts, one either recovers from the initial disorienting effect and goes on to appreciate the special qualities he brings to them, or not. The voice heard live and also on recordings is ""light"" not as an adjective but as a noun -- it radiates, glows, shimmers. To hear such a singer making a successful career in the roles in which Vogt does so, one has to go back some ways in recorded history; there is nothing ""baritonal"" about him. His singing near the end of Korngold's opera, as the famous theme of Marietta's Lied comes around for its reprise of bittersweet acceptance, is spellbinding for its beauty joined to eloquence, understanding, the feeling of a long dark night having at last passed. I felt it was as great a performance of this role as I could ever hear.

Vogt's soprano foil, Camilla Nylund, is a bit puzzling -- an admired, successful, and versatile singer all over the world for 20 years, attractive both vocally and physically, whom one rarely sees mentioned as anyone's favorite. Every performance I have ever heard from her has been well judged and managed, with a sense that nothing can go wrong, but there is something impersonal about her, the technician more than the artist. Here, again, she sings well and looks good (beautifully costumed by Katrina Lindsay, and sporting a flattering period coif), but although she holds up her end and partners well with Vogt, she does not linger in the memory as he does.

The contralto Sari Nordqvist, as Paul's loyal housekeeper Brigitta, does everything she can to convince us this is more than a two-character opera -- her firm, authoritative, richly colored singing gives nothing but pleasure, and one wants to hear her immediately as Erda (which she has sung at the same theater). Markus Eiche sings and acts the baritone role of Paul's friend Frank pleasingly if less competitively.

Kasper Holten's production for Finnish National Opera is beautiful, imaginative, and free, not so literal as that by Pier Luigi Pizzi on the Venice DVD (which was ruled out for me by the vocal problems of both leads). Where Pizzi gave the principal set of Paul's home the aseptic good taste and rigid symmetry of a funeral parlor (a valid notion), Holten and his designer Es Devlin give it the abstract feel of a sort of memory-museum, with Paul and the others seeming to have entered a space in his mind cluttered with artifacts of a vanished life, through which the singers must navigate. (Carefully.) Very German. Holten's boldest move is to personalize the dead Marie on stage in the form of an excellent mute actress whom only Paul sees and acknowledges...until the dramatic climax in Act III, when Marietta suddenly challenges her, the whore taking on the Madonna.

There is fine work from the Orchestra of the Finnish National Opera under Mikko Franck, and video direction does justice to Wolfgang Goebbel's marvelous lighting. One might still wish for a soprano who can make the meal of Marietta that seems to be there, but no matter: the great video performance of DIE TOTE STADT has arrived.",1415404800,12,4240,4.899721448467966
5243162,5,B00925T8YI,"I was lucky to have seen this opera several years ago at the San Francisco Opera, a very good production.  I was a bit disturbed after buying this production when I realized the set is very modern, but once I watched it, it worked well.  Everything about the production is very good - camera, singing and the way the sets are used.  The story line is the tragic story of the loss of a loved one.  The better part of the opera takes place in a dream and must be understood to make sense of it.",1401148800,2,492,4.09375
5243163,4,B00925T8YI,"Die Tote Stadt was first performed in 1920, in Berlin, when Korngold was 23. Gustav Mahler called him a genius, and his works were conducted by Otto Klemperer and Bruno Walter. Then in the 1930's, his music was banned by the Nazis (Korngold was Jewish), and he fled to Hollywood, where he composed operatic film music. Errol Flynn, for example, performed to Korngold scores in The Adventures of Robin Hood and The Sea Hawk. When Korngold returned to Germany after the war, however, his romantic style of music was no longer in fashion.

Even though it has not returned to the opera house repertory (except in Germany), Die Tote Stadt is far more enjoyable and interesting than what passes for opera these days - the banalities of Glass, or the tedious noise of Adams. Korngold knew how to write for the voice, and the singers do justice to his arias. But all the arias advance the drama, which never loses focus. The staging is straightforward and effective. The only weakness in this recording is the orchestral sound, which comes through rather blurred and mushy - and I was listening to this DVD with Grado audiophile headphones plugged into a receiver.

One can only wonder what Korngold might have done had his operas remained in fashion, and had he lived as long as Verdi.",1399075200,4,1278,4.726457399103139
5243164,4,B00925T8YI,"Perhaps this will not be a fair review of this production.  It is comparatively simple to review a stand alone performance; but there are now 4 DVD's of Die Tote Stadt available.  I have seen them all and it is very difficult not to compare them.  In my opinion, the two best are this Finnish production by Holten and the Pizzi production from La Fenice.  I much prefer the Pizzi.

The outstanding thing that this production has going for it is the beautiful singing of Klaus Florian Vogt.  He can easily handle everything that Korngold has written, and seemingly effortlessly at that.  This is a very nuanced interpretation.  He comes across as a very sensitive gentle person who has been unable to come to terms with the death of his wife.  However, I do not think that this is what the libretto and the music call for.  He does not show enough passion.  Probably that is the fault of the director, Kaspar Holten (who did such a wonderful interpretation of the Copenhagen Ring).  But given the nature of his dream/hallucination/fantasy, there was a lot boiling under the surface of the character Paul; and I did not feel that came across sufficiently.

[I do not know how to describe the singing of Stefan Vinke in the Pizzi production.  On the positive side, he is filled with passion and energy.  However, his singing is mostly at full throttle (dare I use the term, ""bray""?), which I suppose is a blessing because his sotto voce is uneven.  Given the demands of the role, and what he puts into it, it is a wonder that he is still standing at the end.  But he is well into the interactions with Solveig Kringelborn and into an interpretation of the role as obsessed, barely suppressed, near psychotic.  So, much as I really liked the musicality of Vogt, I am more than prepared to overlook the vocal limitations of Vinke because of his acting which is so important in this opera.]

Another reason for Vogt's apparent lack of passion is the interpretation of Camilla Nylund as Marie/Marietta.  She too sings very well, but she has no fire -- and given what she is singing, it is essential.  Not only does she not dance, but she is relatively static.  She is just not sexy enough, if I can use that term.  Her physical groping of Paul near the end of Act III is so mechanical and cold that Paul does not react until the music calls for it.  And she is so well groomed the morning after, that one wonders what, if anything, happened during their stated torrid activities of the night.  She comes across throughout as almost as cold as Marie -- and Marie is dead (more about that later).

[Kringelborn is a wonder.  She gives a beautiful, passionate depiction of what comes out of Paul's mind.  She moves, she dances, she taunts and flirts and enrages. She sings almost as well as Nylund, but given all that she brings to the performance that Nylund does not, her performance is a hands-down winner.]

The set was far too busy and cluttered for my taste.  All of Act I and the end of Act III had to take place in this room, dominated by a huge bed and with many artifacts placed along the walls and scattered over the floor.  But it was marvellously effective when it opened up for the fantasies.  The off-kilter depiction of Bruges at the end of what came to seem like a long tunnel -- particularly when darkened was wonderful.

My criticisms of Holten's interpretation have to be seen in the light of my admiration for that of Pizzi which seems so right to me.  I do not know why Holten has Marie, played by a mute actress, onstage throughout the performance.  Sometimes it works, mostly it does not.  The Commedia dell'Arte scene is violent and suppressive, rather than liberating through art.  The procession does not process and is as static as much else.  There are many occasions where the action is at odds with the libretto.  And the two principals are emotionally flat.

Orchestrally, I would say that the productions are equal.  I can only wish that my sound system could give a reproduction equal to that experienced in a concert hall.  This is a very lush complex score with an augmented orchestra.  It is hard to recognise that Korngold was only 23 when the opera was premiered, after having worked on it for some years.  Up until the late 1930's it was the most performed opera, appearing on some 70 stages.  Unfortunately, his next opera, Das Wunder der Heliane, was severely panned by the critics; partially because it was out of the developing fashion of the time, and partially because panning the opera was a way settling scores with Korngold's father who, as a severe, dogmatic, conservative, influential music critic himself, had antagonised the musical establishment.  Also the plot was not realistic, to say the least -- and offended the Roman Catholic establishment.  This failure of what he had considered a great work had a strong negative emotional effect upon him.

But Die Tote Stadt is a wonderful opera.  It makes one wonder what he might have done in classical music were it not for his rejection of it following the failure of Heliane -- and of course due to the German Anschluss of Austria from which he was lucky to escape to Hollywood.  He did go on to be arguably the most influential composer of the Twentieth Century because of his defining the music of the movies.",1388188800,28,5305,4.609391675560299
5243165,5,B00925T8YI,"I am new to this opera, but admire the works of Puccini, Strauss and Berg (Of course Wagner is in a class of his own!). I cannot compare this to other DVD's of the opera as I have not seen them, however I suspect from reading their reviews this may be the pick. It most reminds me of Strauss's wonderful 'The woman without a shadow', a much under-performed masterpiece. The music is beautifully lyrical with many truly beautiful passages. I loved the off stage singing.
I can see why it could be difficult to stage effectively with the dream component however I think the sets and staging work brilliantly here. Both Vogt and Nyland are outstanding in difficult roles.
I have many opera DVD's but not many are on the top shelf...this one certainly is.

5243169,5,B00925T8YI,"In the mid-1990s I attended an art exhibition in Montreal dealing with the Symbolist Movement in Europe. The Symbolists were an odd bunch of mostly minor but intriguing artists who flourished from around the last quarter of the 19th century up until the First World War. Some of them, like Kandinsky and Klimt, were, or became, major figures, but most of them are relatively unknown. But what a bunch! Their work embodies a fascination with dreams, visions, and myths; they were haunted by religion, death and sexuality-- the latter especially in its weirder aspects-- and their quest for paradise and search for primal innocence took them down many fascinating byways. The Symbolist artist Ferdnand Khnopff (yeah, that's how it's spelled!) in particular was haunted by the city of Bruges, and produced more than one gloomy vision of that old Flemish Hanseatic town.

This leads us to the subject at hand, the opera Die Tote Stadt by Erich Wolfgang Korngold, which, in this wonderful 1983 production from Berlin, is like a Symbolist painting--one by Khnopff especially-- come to life. I have a distinct liking for offbeat operas, and have seen many, but I've never managed to get to a live production of this gem.

Korngold, of course, is probably best known for his splendid Hollywood movie scores, but he was a remarkable child prodigy who grew up to write quite excellent music, original, but somewhat in the vein of Mahler and Strauss. Die Tote Stadt is his best-known opera and it has a particularly striking number for the two leads-- ""Gluck, das mir verblieb."" It comes in the first act and we hear it again --for the tenor alone--right at the end when the dream or nightmare of the hero seems to be dissolving, or reaching a dire climax. As the director Gotz Friedrich reminds us in his brief introduction to this disc, this number is one of the few real ""hits"" in 20th century opera.

I love Die Tote Stadt, and I do own the out-of-print and much admired CD version, but I can't express my delight in getting this DVD of the wonderful Berlin production.  The CD features the impressive Carol Neblett, with Rene Kollo as Paul, the hero, and Hermann Prey in the role of Fritz the clown. Erich Leinsdorf is the conductor of the CD version--and that's a hard team to beat, but this DVD production is also marvelous. It is hugely well-served by the singers and the conductor Heinrich Hollresier, not to mention the stage director Gotz Friedrich and the designer Andreas Reinhardt. The production is tasteful and totally relevant to the opera and to the Symbolist vision of reality and unreality. (Don't even think of getting the Eurotrash take-offs!). The Deutsche Oper singers include James King as Paul, Karan Armstrong as Marietta, and William Murray as Fritz, and they are all terrific--King handles the scary high tessitura of Paul very well. In fact, the five main performers all act and sing very well, and the two main sets are simply perfect in their decadent gloom.
I won't attempt to run through the plot, although it might be summarized by a line from Edgar Allan Poe: ""Is all that we see or seem, but a dream within a dream?""  Its about a lonely man who is still mourning years later for his dead wife and who suddenly meets a woman who seems to be her double. The moral of the piece, never crudely stated, is that obsessions are not so easily gotten rid of, and that a fixation on death and the dead, even a dead love, can be hopelessly destructive. The gloomy city of Bruges encircles the action, and a clear counterpoint of sacred worship and profane love is conveyed throughout.

A few further comments. Yes, this opera is indeed an ingenious combination of reality and dream, and it has a good deal of genuine psychological profundity (which can't be said for some operas that are much better known). It plays on the conflict between religious ""purity"" and sexual license, and, yes, it all borders somewhat on camp, and can be played as camp--but, thank goodness, that's not what happens here. In this production you will see a strong suggestion, (and a quite valid one given the psychology) that the ending will be tragic, but you don't actually see the tragedy. (If you were disappointed by the imposed tragic ending in the fine Washington D.C. production of La Rondine--and I wasn't, because of its restraint--you will find this much more acceptable.) Korngold's score is rich and satisfying, and conveys the drama beautifully. You will be hypnotized by this piece and will want to visit it more than once, I'm sure.  Be advised that this is a TV production, so if you are partial only to the filming of works actually staged live before an audience, you may be a little disappointed. I saw some advantages and almost no disadvantages in the TV form of presentation. Although this production is some thirty years old now the picture is more than acceptable, and the sound is excellent.

If you have the slightest interest in late-Romantic music, or the gloomy art-themes and psychological quirks and moods I've described above, you will simply love Korngold's opera. And this production does it proud.",1361923200,14,5126,4.797281993204983
