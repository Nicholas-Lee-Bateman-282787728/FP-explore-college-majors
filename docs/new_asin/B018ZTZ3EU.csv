7560833,5,B018ZTZ3EU,"This is one of the best sets you can get for your money. I would have paid six bucks for King Kong Escapes alone, but getting King vs. Godzilla and Peter Jackson's new remake of King Kong ups the value even further!

King Kong-
A long movie, but is a pretty cool adventure that has some great action. The CGI was dated even when the movie first came out, but that's okay. The effects can still look cool. The only downside is that they drag scenes on for too long sometimes and some of the acting feels like they are trying too hard.

King Kong vs. Godzilla-
The best movie in this pack. It's absolutely hilarious. My favorite King Kong movie and one of my favorite Godzilla movies. It's goofy in all the best ways, and it never drags. The monster action is also full of fun. This movie's King Kong suit looks awful, but that just adds to the charm.

King Kong Escapes-
Same crappy Kong suit and the story is insane. In other words, this movie rocks. King Kong gets to fight both Gorosaurus and a mechanical King Kong. The movie's colors are very bright and vibrant. This is a good looking movie throughout. No drab looking scenes. It's fun, but not as good as King Kong vs. Godzilla. The downsides are the annoying girl that yells King Kong's name and the ending fight (Which drags on until it suddenly ends faster than you can blink).

Great set! No special features are included, but if all you care about is the movies, then this is the set for you!",1470873600,9,1453,4.350553505535055
