8510556,4,B0075D62KM,"I'm a World War 2 documentary buff, particularly where it concerns the Third Reich, because it chills me to the bone and makes my hairs stand on end in the same way slasher movies elicit similar reactions from horror movie aficionados, as well as emotionally connecting me with the persecuted victims of the Third Reich. I can say for a fact that at least 40-50% (if not more) of the footage is devoted to archival reels, some of which, to my surprise, I actually hadn't seen outside this particular documentary. The other half is split equally between interviews and reenacted scenes. World War 2 buffs should love this series, especially since the soldier of the Wehrmacht is not usually first in line for interviews, when it comes to World War 2 documentaries...the lion's share of testimonials are by veterans of the Allied armies. This is a perspective I appreciate getting from time to time, especially since the inclinations and motives of German soldiers are the most troubling and little understood.",1391040000,3,1008,4.935294117647059
8510557,2,B0075D62KM,"I purchased this dvd set being ignorant of what it really is. It was not what I had hoped for.  This video was made by the British about their interrogation center in Britain for captured German generals.  The British intelligence had cleverly hid microphones throughout the entire villa where the captured generals were waiting out the war in comfort.  It is a well done production, but 90% of the video is talk.  It is the talk of defeated generals lamenting their actions and those of other generals, and of course, Hitler.  The lamenting generals are played by actors.  If one wants to see actual film of the WWII period, this video is not for you.",1349568000,,652,4.626086956521739
