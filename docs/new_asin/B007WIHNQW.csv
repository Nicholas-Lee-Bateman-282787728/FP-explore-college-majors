8522615,5,B007WIHNQW,"This has got to be one of the most under-rated films and lost treasures in movie history. While Neil Simon's other film versions of his terrific plays steal the limelight, this little gem sizzles silently in the background. The dialogue is sharp, witty, constant. And the performances from Walter Matthau and the wonderful Dina Manoff have you glued from start to finish. The story of a young girl who wants to be an actress and travels to LA to find her long lost father only to find neither are what she expected is an original plot and the one-liners are delivered by the two leads like a face-paced tennis match, while keeping some beautiful pathos intact. The chemistry between Matthau and Manoff is spot on. I Ought To be In Pictures should have had much more exposure and awards for both acting, story and direction. An '80s classic.",1374883200,4,840,4.6824324324324325
