8123092,5,B000FII2ZW,"Anything Clifford in our house is a huge hit.  We have Clifford books, slippers, and toys and now even a few videos.  Sometimes my 2 yr old daughter wants big Clifford sometimes she wants puppy Clifford, either way they are great videos to have.  This one is great and keeps my daughter entertained throughout.  We don't watch much tv, but once and awhile she would rather watch this than anything else.  Just wish there were more out there to choose from.",1311638400,2,456,4.580246913580247
