8329620,4,B001O4KBM8,"This video provides a good history of the Phillies, and there is much coverage of the 2008 world championship.  However, there is a list of the 40 best Phillies players and managers, and Pete Rose's name was curiously absent from the list of the best first basemen.",1245628800,2,265,4.638297872340425
8329621,4,B001O4KBM8,"For a die hard Phillies fan this should be called Phillies nightmares as it brings back all the heartache of following this team. They dwell way too much on the 1993 team which lost in the world series while glossing over the 50 and 60's . I assume this is due to lack of film. It is nice to see some of the heroes you grew up with being  interviewed. All in all alot is stuff that you've seen hundred of times, but it is a nice 2 hours of memories.",1245024000,7,449,3.934065934065934
