8336231,5,B001QT86EQ,"Very nice. Not as nice as the older iworship dvds. The first 7 had more scenery in the song videos. These are more of swirls and colors. This has a mixture of older songs and a few newer songs. Our older ones got scratched so I ordered this to try it. My kids love them, but prefer the scenery. If you don'y own own the older ones you will really enjoy it. Could be great for small groups or Sunday school.",1431302400,2,406,4.0246913580246915
