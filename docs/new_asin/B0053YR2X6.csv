8456006,3,B0053YR2X6,"The chandelier was priced right and shipped to me very quickly, however, it was missing a crystal and it is a swag chandelier not hard wired. This means that you plug into the wall and then hang it on the ceiling with hooks. I wanted mine hard wired into the cieling so the light switch controlled it, so I had to cut the cord and buy a kit to convert it. I gave it a 3 because I didn't feel they made that clear in the description and it was missing the crystal.",1328745600,,463,3.989247311827957
