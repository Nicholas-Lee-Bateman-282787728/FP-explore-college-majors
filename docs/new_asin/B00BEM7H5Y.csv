The film is an extremely good effort especially considering Mr Lake did it for $800. (plus lots of volunteer hours from his cast, family and others).

A special call out to Aniello Zampella who did the special effects (light saber work) and has to be highly commended.  Someone should update iMDb database to include this work.

If I were a teacher of film or otherwise lecturing on the topic, this would be an excellent film for instructional review, writing, directing, and editing.  Although not perfect, it certainly sets an ""A"" standard for a first effort with a wide audience.

This film is in the public domain.  I believe it was made sometime 2004? range.  There are no additional items on the DVD-R.  It would have been insightful to hear perspectives from the cast and others involved.",1363824000,,923,4.7125
