I have to say as a parent I am always looking for value, and for me, having a DVD with multiple shows on it makes sense, especially if you are already a fan of the shows on the DVD which we were! I know that this is volume 2, but I am looking forward to volume 3 too! At the same time, I am also looking for shows with educational and overall value, which this DVD definitely has as well. So kudos for a great DVD, and I encourage all fans to look at this DVD as it becomes available on June 12!",1339027200,,589,3.9166666666666665

There are two episodes of each-- Thomas, Fireman Sam, and Bob the Builder.  The most annoying part is the kids' voices on Fireman Sam.  I love kids (I'm a teacher and I have my own children), but I want to punch these in the face.  It's the whiny way they talk that drives me crazy.  Overall, my boys request this movie daily.
