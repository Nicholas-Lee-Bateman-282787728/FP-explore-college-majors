8039218,2,B0000VLL6Q,Does not show a lot of action. Is not visual in how to have sex. Does not explain visually. All it pretty much shows is people talking. This DVD sucks.,1253145600,,151,4.066666666666666
8039219,2,B0000VLL6Q,"Grab yourself some online tips through a search engine.  Don't waste your money.  Since is it a Playboy series, they use it as a means to make more money.  It is good enough for virgins who know NOTHING, but I don't think you'll get much from it.

There were more annoying scenes between Dr. Roth's talks that did nothing to teach, only to remind you that you're watching a sex instruction video.  It was filler and fluff.  The talks that Dr. Ruth gave were in a setting with 3 couples ""candidly"" talking about their relationships.  Seemed scripted.

You might get a few things out of it, but there are better sources out there.  This will just make you sleepy, or sigh in frustration. I'm glad I didn't waste my money on it.",1232323200,,725,4.431818181818182
8039220,2,B0000VLL6Q,"There are three DVDs in this boxed set. At first, I was a little leery of the DVD #3: 10 Secrets For Greater Sensual Pleasure, because it had an old woman, Dr. Ruth Westheimer. I thought they'd have a curvacious cutie be our host. but, as it turns out, Dr. Ruth wasn't so bad.
It starts out in a living room-type setting with Dr. Ruth and three couples sitting on sofas. She goes down her list of 10 secrets, two at a time. There is a group discussion, and then we see a scene that illustrates what Dr. Ruth was just talking about. The male & female actors in the scenes are not the same couples in the living room discussion. The women in these demonstration scenes, particularly the woman in the first one, are some of the most beautiful, statuesque, and perfect women that mankind has ever seen. At the end of the DVD Dr. Ruth tells us to remember these 10 secrets, write them down, and practice them.
  DVD #2: Tantric Lovemaking is one of the most boring, monotonous DVDs I ever saw. This Tantric was invented 10,000 years ago by someone in China, but they didn't have the benefit of Dr. Ruth's 10 secrets.
One of the highlights of this Tantric DVD is our professor, Dr. Barbara Keesling, who apparently also rents herself out as a sex surrogate. Don't ask. Dr. Barbara is a beautiful babe and occasionally lies naked on her side as she gives instructions to a naked couple, who are laying down beside her. Too bad Dr. Barbara Keesling doesn't stand up sometime when she is naked so that the camera can check her out. All this may not seem like it would be very boring, but its too monotonous, and there aren't any ""sexy surprises"" or ""unexpected levels of passion"" (both of which are things that Dr. Ruth Westheimer says we need.)I fell asleep during this Tantric Lovemaking DVD.
One way to keep someone (like me) awake would be to have Dr. Keesling standing around naked and for the guy to pop up and start groping her and sucking on her, and she could softly say, ""No...no...please..."" And the guy's girfriend could say in a whiney voice, ""Honey....why?"" Another way to keep me awake would be for Dr. Barbara Keesling to arrive late in a pantsuit with the couple already naked and waiting for her. She could breathlessly say, ""Sorry, I'm late,"" and then stand there and calmly take off her clothes while the camera lovingly examines her. And then when she has everything off, she could exclaim, ""Ok, I'm ready,"" and then lay down naked on her side next to the naked couple.
At least incidents like that could do wonders to keep me awake. I would be sitting on the edge of my seat while waiting for the next ""sexy surprise"". Toward the end of the Tantric DVD a voiceover says about Tantric Lovemaking:
""...there are no rules, and no goals..."" To which I would add: there is no point.
  DVD #1 is of ""Arousal, Foreplay, and Orgasm"". We have Dr. Ruth & three couples again for this one. For a DVD on arousal, it is awfully unarousing. It's awfully talky. There are demonstration scenes, but they are few and far between.",1207785600,9,3025,4.4845735027223235
