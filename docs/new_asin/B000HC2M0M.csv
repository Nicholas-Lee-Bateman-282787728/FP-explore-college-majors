2633034,1,B000HC2M0M,"WARRIORS OF TERRA is pretty terrible.  Filmed in a lot of darkness with jerky camera work and annoying fadeouts, the movie tries hard for suspense but ultimately fails miserably.  An ecoterrorist group breaks into a facility to release test animals; they are aided by the security guard who is dating the big shot's daughter.  They find no animals but when their computer geek opens all the doors, they release a secret genetic experiment---a girl who injects her victims with a poisonous toxin that liquefies their innards and is contagious as well.  Seems like the father of the heroine has been trying to cure this girl for ten years---we never know what he's curing her of or who she is.  Needless to say, the girl gets out and eats up most of the cast.  Edward Furlong, whose career has pretty much gone down hill since his TERMINATOR days is the security guard and he is as bad as the rest of the unknowns cast.  Another nail in the coffin of horror movies.",1160697600,4,963,4.5964912280701755

8138149,1,B000HC2M0M,"Warriors of Terra (Robert Wilson, 2006)

In 2003, a bad little British slasher film called LD 50 made the rounds briefly before fading into well-deserved obscurity. Unfortunately, it seems that special effects guru Dave Bonneywell and TV-series script editor Jeremy Boxer got ahold of a copy before obscurity could hit, decided they could combine it with a far more popular film from a few years previous, Species, and come up with a North American pseudo-remake. That this was a bad idea should be evident to all, especially those (like me) who have actually seen LD 50, which was a deathless cinema classic compared to this waste of time and money.

Edward Furlong heads a cast of what can loosely be called actors (save the always-entertaining Rothaford Gray) in this tale of a radical animal-rights group who set their sights on breaking into a supposedly-unbreakable lab. (Furlong plays a security guard there; he's their inside man.) Once they get in, however, they find out that what they thought was in there to liberate and what really is are two entirely different things...

Everything about this movie is either shoddy or worse. The camerawork is often excruciating, and the lighting is phenomenally bad. Combine the two whenever the bad guy pops up on screen, and wow, is this silly. The acting is awful (save Gray), the script worse. The set is about as generic as it gets for these kinds of movies. Really, did anyone put an iota of thought into this? Attempts at making a quick buck at their worst. Fortunately for you, I watched it so that you don't have to.

8138150,1,B000HC2M0M,"This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. O.K., lets break it down:

1 - poor acting. You will never believe nor care about any of the characters in this film.

2 - stupid story line. High tech animal loving teenagers infiltrating a higher tech secret project facility which is guarded by 2 teenage security guards... Yeah...

3 - special effects? this consists of 1 or 2 people flipping light switches constantly, and some cheap walmart halloween makeup.

I only wish that I could erase this movie from my brain forever. Avoid this disaster of a movie at all costs! On a lighter note, the dvd does make a pretty good beer coaster, other than that, it is worthless.  : )",1231718400,4,685,4.491935483870968
8138151,3,B000HC2M0M,"and commenting on a reviewer who reviewed prior to street date makes a lot of assumptions - such as the person is not a reviewer outside of Amazon, the reviewer has not been to any place where the DVD might have been shown and knows no person who might have sent him/shown him the DVD, the reviewer never saw the film itself (which legitimizes certain potential complaints re the DVD - same basic cinematography, light level, most of film all the same) - that should be considered.

Just as one example, recently I noticed a person on another site I visit often commenting on details of the Nailin' Paylin DVD over a week before release.  I asked how he knew - turned out he has friends in the business and was sent a copy a couple of weeks before it came out/street dated.",1227398400,,773,4.398601398601398
