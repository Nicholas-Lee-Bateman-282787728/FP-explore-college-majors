Was it ""thrilling""?  Oh, for about 20 minutes.
In most cases, it seemed that most the actors had only done theater, especially the primary female character. The movie villain is the typical characterization of a southern, fat white, racist, sheriff.  Michael Phillip Thomas took the role seriously which is the only reason, you are willing to watch the film the entire way through.
Additionally, Miami Vice was a hit in the 80's, this was released in 1991. This film is very low budget and the writing was amateurish.  The sound quality is poor (no Dolby here) probably the equipment was from the 60's or 70's.
There is some female nudity which really wasn't necessary to the film however, it was used to keep at least 50% of the audience from hitting the stop button.
While it leaves you thinking, it isn't something you'll see more than once.",1212278400,8,1089,4.645833333333333
