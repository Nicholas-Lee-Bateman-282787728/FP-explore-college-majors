7990565,1,B00009ECCV,Save your money and time. There is no content at all in this collection of disjointed scenes and uninspired narration. One gets the feeling this was a class project that was created at the last minute to meet a deadline.,1132531200,13,220,4.525
7990566,1,B00009ECCV,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this is an amateur production - appears to be a husband and wife and their camcorder.  There is a long segment on Thailand tacked on the beginning for some reason and the narration is flat.  The dvd cuts abruptly from location to location.
The only reason we still have this DVD is that my 3-year old, who was adopted from Vietnam, requests it periodically.  The scenery is nice and gives some idea of what it's like to be there but this DVD definitely should not serve as your introduction to this beautiful country.",1079568000,26,557,4.55
7990567,1,B00009ECCV,"I am writing this review to tell you that this DVD, which is barely over 30 minutes long, is someone's vacation put on DVD.  The camera work is terrible and  I was extremely disappointed in this DVD.  The explanation of history and how the people live today is lacking in any real substance.  The only saving grace of this DVD is that there are many video sequences of the scenery in Vietnam.  Not recommended for anyone who wants to learn more about Vietnam",1076889600,29,458,4.469879518072289
