8174383,4,B000007NN2,"The wall is  based on a group of Kurdish teenage and children convicts in a maximum secuirity prison in Turkey prisoned for minor involvment in the Kurdish Freedom struggle. The film deals with the harsh reality of Turkish  prisons at the time and how the officials within the prison force the  prisoners into false statments about involvment in terrorism and carry out  a daily torture routine. The film is an  excellent reflection of the  problems faced by ordinary working class and Kurdish people at the hands of  the Turkish authorities at the time. The boys realise that they only have  two options - either to escape and risk death or wait for a chance to be  transferred to a so called better prison. Yilmaz Guney wrote the script and  directed the film while he was in Paris  seeking Political Asylum after he  had been denied of his Turkish citizenship for directing films which dealt  with similar issues, the most famous being the film YOL (Way) 1982 Cannes  film festival award winner. He died in Paris and was buried there (1987?  correct me if i am wrong)The film was upto the early 1990's banned in  Turkey. Since Turkish censors have allowed the film to be screened and I  definatly reccomend any person intrested in political and everyday hardship  of the working class, groups of different religon and ethnic minorities in  oppressing countries such as Turkey was, to see the film.",953596800,11,1400,4.7824267782426775
