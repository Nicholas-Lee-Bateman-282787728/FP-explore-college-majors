8735744,5,B0167EA9TY,"I've purchased these type of instructional videos before for the cameras i have owned. Most are filled with various technical jargon and what not, making it a bit more difficult to understand. This dvd is exactly what it says it is, a crash course in using the camera. It is designed to get you out there and taking pictures. It is meant for beginners, it provides the basics of photography and a decent overview of how to get started. Definitely would recommend it to anyone looking to get going in a day with their new camera.",1444780800,,528,4.510416666666667
