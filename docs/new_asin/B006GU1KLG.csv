4987663,5,B006GU1KLG,"The Shawn Trautman West Coast Swing 101 dance video really helped me to learn this dance from the very beginning.  I've been trying to learn this dance for a long time. These instructors have a great method of teaching the steps by introducing the counting in a clear and easy way so that there is a good understanding of how the rhythm sequences are used later in the dance.  I especially liked the transition from the basic walking steps to the step counting in more complex combinations.  Before I even realized it, I was actually dancing these steps confidently through each section of the video.  This is a great lesson and the best part is that it can be taken again and again just by playing the video for review and practice!",1335571200,2,733,4.53030303030303
8497779,5,B006GU1KLG,"So we went ahead and purchased all the Trautman's new west coast swing videos, 6 total, and absolutely love them all.  Starting with this 101 DVD was exactly what we needed to get the dance down from both my end (as the leader) and my wife's side of the dance.  Shawn and Joanna do a great job of making sure you are right path with easy step by step cues and follow up often with repeating those moves over a few times so you are sure to get them.  My wife has always had trouble staying on the beat and we really like that they have a whole section on just the rhythm of the dance.  This video was a great deal and by far exceeded our expectations. Highly recommend this video for beginners looking to get into our now favorite dance, west coast swing!",1398643200,,754,4.179310344827586
8497780,5,B006GU1KLG,"I live in California and we often see West Coast Swing on the dance floor. I started with the simple Nightclub Two Step, and just couldn't figure out what they were doing in this more complicated dance. There is no such thing as ""West Coast Swing for Dummies"", and the best use of this video could be that you will understand that you need to learn more basic dances first. I read a review by some angry dude who probably thought that he was going to be  a dancing star in three easy lessons, and I can only suggest that you be realistic in your expectations. Shawn does talk a lot in this particular video, because there is so very much to learn, like six count versus eight count footwork and when to use each. I am happy to have decided to save West Coast Swing lessons for later, thanks to this video. It will live on the shelf until my skill level is higher, and it did not cost me much time or money. If you are a more accomplished dancer, then go for it, and you will not be disappointed. My advice for new dancers, or those guys like me with two left feet, is to start with the more simple East Coast swing or Night club Two Step, and work your way up to this fine video in the future.",1388966400,,1193,4.120171673819742
8497781,2,B006GU1KLG,"I can sum it up in a couple of words:  ""Please, shut up Shawn.""  He talks far too much...shows too little.  A little disorganized, too.  He likes to go off on little tangents as he explains things.  One wants to tell him, ""Get to the point!""  Videography is so-so, often not showing the dancing instructors from head to feet...or from a variety of angles.  He's congenial, friendly, encouraging...but the dvd is disappointing.  I think there are other better options out there.",1388275200,,477,4.802469135802469
8497782,5,B006GU1KLG,"I just started formal dance lessons and have gone to ""classes"".  What I found was that despite my own flaws, the instructors themselves did not know how to teach the proper fundamentals in order to prepare you for the more advance moves so that your dancing coincides with the music and your partner.

I have purchased the Swing 101, and the three Volumes of Moves and Patterns from Shawn and JoAnna and by far they are superlative.  Thier style of teaching is outstanding.  Shawn and JoAnna's grasp or what students need and the fundamentals that you should obtain first, before moving on to subsequent moves is excellent.... just by watching you can pick up Shawn's footwork for the men, and by watching JoAnne the women can literally see what they have to execute.  And they stress over and over that you have to be confortable with the basics before movng on.

So my suggestion as a non ranked social dancer who would like to get better is to purchase their series of DVD's and watch, learn and listen to them and then have this supplement your dance lessons with a partner... you will not be disappointed.  And on top of it if you have problems they have a toll free number, which they answer, if you have questions.  And believe me they are as pleasant to speak with as they are on their DVD's..  They are the real deal.",1384473600,,1326,4.514644351464435
8497783,5,B006GU1KLG,We are enjoying the instruction on the video. With additional practice my wife might even dance with me in public!,1372896000,,114,4.75
8497784,5,B006GU1KLG,"The video is easy to learn from, breaks the dance steps down for easy viewing before going on to more complicated steps.",1364860800,2,120,4.5
8497785,5,B006GU1KLG,"I have been dancing West Coast Swing for a few years, but I still like to go back and review the basics before I go out dancing, or learn new moves. As a teacher I know the importance of having a good foundation, and this DVD provides that foundation. I feel more confident after reviewing the basics with Shawn and Joanna's DVD.

As with all of their DVD's (I own several), they clearly are having fun teaching, and their humor makes it more enjoyable to learn with them. This is an excellent DVD if you are starting out, or reviewing the basics. You can clearly see where your hand placement should be, and what your feet should be doing, and they review everything they taught.",1363996800,,680,4.44
8497786,2,B006GU1KLG,Hard to follow and not very much instruction for the price.  It was close to $40.00.  The DVD was dissapointing to me.,1361318400,,118,4.318181818181818
8497787,5,B006GU1KLG,I recently made a decision to learn West Coast Swing.  I have taken a few basic lessons but was still having some problems with the basic steps and moves.  This video solved that problem.  Shawn and Joanna's presentation of the basics is very understandable and easy to follow.  They very effectively demonstrate the steps and moves they are teaching and how it should look when you are on the dance floor.  The video can be used as the sole source of instruction or as a way to review and reinforce what is covered in any lessons you may be taking.  I recommend this video to anyone who either has made the decision to go for it and learn West Coast Swing or to anyone who may be thinking of giving it a try but wants to learn more about the dance before making the leap. This video will provide a great start.,1346371200,3,811,4.302631578947368
8497788,5,B006GU1KLG,"My husband and I picked up this video hoping to better learn West Coast Swing.  Despite my husband's background in swing and receiving professional instruction, we never were able to get our our proper timing together.  We would dance together and have fun but not without frustration!  The methods and techniques shown in this video have brought the correct rhythm and steps into view for the both of us!  The instruction starts at a very basic level so one can understand the fundamentals and true roots of West Coast and allows you to move on, step by step, at the pace you are comfortable with.  It's very similar to math...if you don't understand the very first beginning steps, you will soon become very overwhelmed and LOST!  Not here!  Both Shawn and Joanna show the woman's and man's steps while you are moving though the steps with them creating lots of confidence for the both us.  I definitely would recommend this video to anyone who is interested in learning how to West Coast or even brush up on the very basics of steps!  Thanks guys..very well done and looking forward to seeing you both in the next video!",1342656000,2,1123,4.659898477157361
