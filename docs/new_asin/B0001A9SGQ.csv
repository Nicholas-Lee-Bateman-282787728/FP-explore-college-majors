I gotta give my father credit, he let me see it after he asked me, ""son, are you sure u wanna see this?"" without a hesitation, I said, ""yes please"" Now, here it is 25 years later, I still watch wrestling.",1410048000,,295,3.774193548387097
8009090,3,B0001A9SGQ,"Another NWA card that I was able to find on the internet. Now for those that didn't know or remember, this Starrcade along with the previous Starrcade were held in two different locations (Greensboro, NC & Atlanta, GA) in one night with each area providing their own main event match. With that being said for anyone who has read my previous reviews (or even took a look at DP's review), you would know that these old WCW tapes were edited down to 2 hours & that was the copy that I was able to see.

Steel Cage Match: NWA Tag Team Champions The Rock & Roll Express vs Arn & Ole Anderson. During this point in time, the Andersons were so ruthless that you could just feel the pain that they were dishing out to their opponents as you saw this throughout with Arn & Ole cutting the ring in half & taking advantage of an injured knee that Robert Gibson had entering the match. The suspense of Gibson not being able to make it to his partner really got the crowd on the edge of their seat before Richard Morton was tagged into the match & was basically manhandled by the Andersons with wear down holds such as an armbar & even the sick kneedrop from the top rope onto the arm. Both teams bleed before the Express were able to pick the pace up & use their speed to their advantage in what was a great cage match that showcased proper physicalogy throughout with the Andersons taking advantage of the classic heel tag team rule.

Street Fight: Ron Garvin vs Big Bubba. The rules to this match was similar to how a Texas Death Match/Last Man Standing match would play out in that the man that loses would be the one that couldn't answer the ref's 10 count. This was a brawl throughout the ringside area with Jim Cornette constantly getting involved to give Bubba the upperhand along with playing a factor in the outcome of the match.

Hair Match: Jimmy Valant vs Paul Jones. Jones put his hair on the line with Valant's valet Big Momma's hair being on the line as well due to Valant's hair already being cut due to Jones & his crew. Before the match got underway, there was a big commotion at ringside as many wrestlers including Wahoo McDaniel struggled & eventually put Manny Fernandez in a cage to be suspended above the ring to not allow interference. Valant dominated Jones from the beginning before Jones used an object to get the advantage & bust Jimmy's head open. Valant was eventually able to get the object & use it for the victory before the aftermath of Jimmy getting beat up anyways by Fernandez & Rick Rude after Jones's hair was cut.

First Blood Match: NWA Television Champion Dusty Rhodes vs Tully Blanchard. The match got underway with some comedy as a series of events caused J.J. Dillon to get heavily busted open by one of Dusty's elbows. From there on, both men targeted the head area with even moments of both men being cautious knowing that a single strike would cause either man to be busted open. Tully even had the advantage as he was busted open at one point only for Dillon to cover it up with vasaline. A very unique but a really good match between these two men.

Scaffold Match: The Road Warriors vs The Midnight Express. The first scaffold match to happen at a major wrestling promotion. The Express showed their fear early in the match even to the point to where they had to use powder on the Warriors to get some offense going. This is going to excite new fans as this was the kind of match that was more exciting for that time since they were pulling off things from that height that you hadn't seen before but keeping watching after the match as you see Jim Cornette take a fall that actually ended up breaking his leg to the point that it still bothers him today & what was consider the highlight reel of this event.

NWA Champion Ric Flair vs Nikita Koloff. Before I begin, we learned that Magnum TA was originally supposed to face Flair for the title but due to his career ending injury, Koloff ended up turning face as a sign of respect to Magnum & getting his title shot. This was a good match as Koloff was aggressive from the early stages & even dominating Flair with his power to the point that even the offense that Flair was delivering wasn't having any effect on Koloff in the beginning. Flair was able to get some control whenever Nikita made a mistake & decided to work on the knees to take the power advantage away along with both men even brawling on the outside & using the scaffold as a weapon that resulted in both men being busted open. The ending was a huge jip as the match was thrown out due to both men constantly brawling with the action being out control with Koloff attacking everyone in sight to get more of Flair.

So overall, I enjoyed this event but there was really nothing worth going out of your way for since two of the three main events have been released onto DVD today along with main event having a disappointing finish that made you want more from it (not to mention the match being edited down on the VHS copy) so this is one event that I recommend finding online.",1301702400,,5036,4.396995708154506
8009091,3,B0001A9SGQ,"Thanks to watching old episodes of NWA's ""World Championship Wrestling"" shows from Jim Crockett Promotions on ""WWE Classics"" On-Demand channel, I decided to download a copy of the ""Starrcade 1986: Night Of The Skywalkers"" PPV.  This PPV was held under the same forumla that they did for the previous Starrcade that WWE later did for WrestleMania II in that they had this event held in multiple locations (Greensboro, NC & Atlanta, GA) in one night.  Now a few things need to be kept in mind that Turner Home Entertainment (distributors of WCW/NWA home video) would edit their tapes down to two hours so most of the undercard matches are completely removed from the tape with only the main event/high profile matches remaning & even some of those were clipped as well.

Indian Strap Match: Wahoo McDaniels vs. Rick Rude - This was held under traditional strap match rules in that the way to win the way was to drag your opposition & touch all four corners of the ring without being interrupted.  Eventhough I'm a big fan of Rick Rude, this was just a ""paint-by-numbers"" strap match as there wasn't any real suspense as Rude only attempted to drag Wahoo once while Wahoo tried it multiple times and we got the usual ending of one guy hitting another guy causing him to fall into the final corner of the ring to win match.  Past this being Wahoo's final match on such a big event, this was watchable but nothing special.

Steel Cage Match: NWA Tag Team Champions Rock N' Roll Express vs. Minnesota Wrecking Crew (Arn & Ole Anderson) - Throughout their careers, the Andersons had a reputation of being guys who were out to not just get a victory but to make sure you were hurt as well & this was a clear defination of why have the reputation.  Robert Gibson began the match and the Andersons focused on his knee with stomps & submission moves like a half crab.  Ricky Morton made the tag in & they completely manhandled his arm with armbars, a shoulderbreaker, stomps, and even the classic Anderson kneedrop from the top rope.  Whenever Rock N' Roll would begin to gain some momentum, the Andersons were able to break it quickly but it just took one move by the Express to gain the victory over Ole Anderson.  This was a match that saw the Express on the defense throughout as the Anderson's completely dominated this encounter but the bigger picture here was that we would later find out that this match would actually be the beginning of the end for one of the original Four Horsemen.

Street Fight Match: Ronnie Garvin vs. Big Bubba - This match was held under ""Last Man Standing/Death Match"" rules where the person who can't stand by the referee's count of 10 loses the match.  This began with both men just throwing each other to the floor before Garvin dominated the match with his ""Hands Of Stone"" punches before Bubba had to resort to a roll of quarters in order to recover.  From here, this was nothing more than just a brawl with Garvin at one point executing a piledriver with Bubba being dead weight & not helping one bit.  Jim Cornette got heavily involved in the finish but this was exactly what you expected, a slugfest.

Hair Match: Jimmy Valant vs. Paul Jones - This was the climax of the ""Bald Headed Geek"" feud between Valant & Paul Jones' army with Jones putting his hair on the line against Valant's valet Big Momma's hair since his was already cut months earlier thanks to Jones.  Valant's former partner & current member of Paul Jones' army, Manny Fernandez, was scheduled to be locked in a small cage so he wouldn't get involved & had to be forced in by various wrestlers.  Valant completely dominated Jones here before Jones resulted in using an object to not only get an advantage but also had Jimmy bleeding before Valant was able to get the object & use it for the win & his revenge with Jones' head getting shaved...however it was what happened afterwards with Rude & Fernandez that can be summerized with the phrase, ""you made have won the battle but you didn't win the war.""

First Blood Match: NWA Television Champion Dusty Rhodes vs. Tully Blanchard - This match had a very comedic beginning with the antics of both Tully & James J. Dillion resulting in Dillion bleeding worse than anyone else involved in the match. With the way this match was structured, this was a different encounter than usual as both men were wrestling more of a defensive style & heavily protecting shots to the head while also giving out more impactful blows to the other's head. This was a good match with great storytelling by both men.
(""Ric Flair & The Four Horsemen"")

Scaffold Match: Road Warriors vs. Midnight Express - The first major scaffold match in wrestling history. The match itself wasn't good by normal standards since they were very limited on what they could do but for the time, it was really a sight to see both teams being so high up, knowing how one team was going to fall all the way down, and the way they used the scaffold during the match. Watch out for the ending with Bobby Eaton & what happened to Jim Cornette afterwards.

NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Nikita Koloff - As it's known now that behind the scenes, this was suppost to be Magnum T.A.'s shot at the World Title but due to his career ending accident, Nikita turned babyface & got the title shot here.  Koloff was the dominate monster in the beginning as nothing Flair did had any effect on while Koloff dominated Flair with a set of one handed slams & bearhug to Flair.  Flair was only able to get an advantage by using Koloff's momentum against him when Koloff went over the top rope which hurt his knee.  Flair targed his leg with clips & the figure four.  The scaffold from the earlier match came into play here that busted both men open but Nikita wouldn't be denied to the point where two referees were knocked out & Nikita refused to stop beating on Flair to the point where the match got out of control & thrown out with Nikita beating up everyone in sight just to get to Flair.  This was a good match overall but for this being the biggest event of the year, it was a bad ending.

Look back on this event, I think it was a good event by the NWA but I definately didn't think it was a classic event or one worth going out of the way to get these days as the best matches on it are already available on various DVD sets.  If your a diehard NWA fan this is this worth taking a look at but if your not then you can pass or get the best matches on the DVD's I already listed.",1284249600,,6589,4.510495382031906
8009092,5,B0001A9SGQ,Another old school wrestling tape that WWE cannot create and that is a scaffold match likeon this one between the Road Warriors and the Midnight Express!,1258243200,,153,4.923076923076923
8009093,5,B0001A9SGQ,"One of the best Starrcades available! An excellent Crockett NWA supercard that featured a GREAT scaffold match between The Road Warriors & the Midnight Express with one of the best promos out there by the Warriors.

 This video is extremely scarce (to the tune of about $60, used), but is well worth the price. 3 hours of the best wrestling action you can find, and about 10 times (at least) better than anything produced by the WWF since WrestleMania X's ladder match or SummerSlam '94's Bret Hart v. Owen Hart in a cage.

 A lot of people only remember the bad things about WCW, but this tape proves that the company had some finer points, as well.

 Ric Flair, defending his NWA World Heavyweight Title against Nikita Koloff is also a spectacular match from two great talents: the man who could carry a corpse to a great match, one of the all-time best bumpers in the business and the man whose star really rose when he battled Magnum T.A. in the ""best of seven"" series for the NWA United States title.

 If you can pick it up, it is worth every penny.",1078617600,,1055,4.458333333333333
