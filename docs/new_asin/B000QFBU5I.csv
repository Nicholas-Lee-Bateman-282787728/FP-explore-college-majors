8196073,2,B000QFBU5I,"I found this movie quite deceptive when it came to marketing and description and I cannot say I was really thrilled by it. It may have been better had it been given a different way, I doubt it b8t it is always possible, but you pick everything up as a package, description especially and Tartan label. That is kind of hard to set to the side and forget midway through - and thinking that still does not do anything for me on a personal level. I'm just trying to understand some of the ratings for the film, considering what I watched.

You have a plot line I do not want to destroy so I really cannot explain any more than the summary already given for the product. What I can say is that there was some real issues that made this seem to drag on. The way it was pieced together, bringing in pieces of dialog, then chopped up scenes meant to come together later, plus the family and their move, really became taxing after a while. I wanted to fast forward but figured I might always wonder if I missed something - I didn't.

 There seemed to be three types of moments in the film: the part where people told you a story that sometimes fit together but sometime had you straining to understand why it was told this was,  the revelation portions where you had a flashback or some piece that fit in, and scenes that went with heavily creepy music but maybe a shadow or maybe a flash of someone standing around, looking out of place. The creepy portions and revelations maybe comprised ten percent of the film and the ending was fast and really easy to drive home - even if you call it something other than horror that should not have happened. Ten minutes, a few words, one deed that is glossed over in a way, and its done. Every grating.

8196074,5,B000QFBU5I,"A quietly chilling and ultimately devastating portrayal of a family's descent into horror.  Those looking for a fast-paced, gore-soaked thriller will not find those qualities in ""Bad Blood"" - instead you'll find a carefully mounted drama which draws its terror from delicately written characters and the questions we all ask about the otherworldly.",1237680000,,348,5.566037735849057
8196075,1,B000QFBU5I,"The previous review mentions much of what I would say, except that it becomes clear with about 40 mins ( and that is still a lot of time )left that this movie is totally lost. You hold on for a intelligent resolution that could have happened but is a mess. That leaves only that this is a misleading and quite bad movie on all counts. There's even mention of werewolves without any story reasoning. Worse a brother sister rape, and late needless swearing that only adds to the sadness of this broken story. Buy, no. Rent, you could do worse but you will be throwing away money.",1193011200,,577,4.401869158878505
8196076,3,B000QFBU5I,"The DVD cover for this movie is baffling -- there is no floating ghostly little girl to be found in the movie.  And the movie isn't much of a horror movie, either.  It's much more of a psychological drama about a troubled family (not including a little girl, by the way) whose move to a country estate triggers a bunch of previously pent-up animosities.  There's some discussion of the supernatural and a murder committed at the instigation of the husband's ancestor, but any payoff for that angle is definitely lacking.  Not a bad movie, some beautiful scenery, but you won't get your horror movie fix from this one.",1190160000,5,617,4.685185185185185
