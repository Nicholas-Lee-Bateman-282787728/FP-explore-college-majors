3720393,5,B001NPD9Q8,"Well, it's been a long wait, but Youth in Revolt is finally hitting the big screen in a wide release. And it's worth the wait. I laughed through just about the whole movie. And before I get deep into the review, I have read the book. So let's get into it.

BAD:
1. Quite short. A 90 minute romp through a 500-page novel. What?
2. CUTS! Many characters from the novel such as Apurva and Fuzzy hve been severed from the movie. Maybe Apurva was cut from them film to emphasize Nick's love for Sheeni. But Fuzzy's cut? He's the whole reason they can go to the French boarding school in Act II. What?
3. No Carlotta, really! If you have read the book you know what I mean with this.
That's it for the bad.
GOOD:
1. Hysterical! Does this really need an explanation? It's funny!
2. Animation sequences. These occur at certain points in the film to facilitate scenes. Very creative!
3. Good Acting/Cameos. The film has very good acting. Michael Cera and Portia Doubleday really steal the show. Also, they have an ensemble cast of cameos, such as Fred Willard and Steve Buscemi. Very well acted.
4. Quite faithful to the novel. Miguel Arteta did good with the novel. No new characters were introduced, only cuts.

Overall Score: 9.0 out of 10
A ten, but not really any Carlotta and no Apurva or Fuzzy. And, way too short.",1262995200,15,1312,4.439834024896266

3720436,5,B001NPD9Q8,"There aren't very many adaptations of books into film that manage to not to wreck themselves. I am very happy to say Youth in Revolt does not mangle the book, but in fact adds a layer of realism and earnest emotion that the book strays away from.

Youth in Revolt is a teenage fantasy coming-of-age story set in central and northern California, about one young man's quest for love. Beyond this basic setting, we have no other cues to tell us when the action is happening; the protagonist Nick uses a computer that looks like it's from 1992, the teenage characters all speak with Shakespearean wit, and everyone seems to regularly write letters and keep journals. (Like I said, it's a fantasy.)

This otherworldly element was fortunately imported in from the original book. Another spectacular motif that was thankfully maintained is showing the extreme lengths teenage guys will go for love; some of the more twisted elements of the novel (like Nick drugging his girlfriend so she is expelled from school and forced to go back to her hometown, also where he forced his father to move) ring true to the source material. Which I think is really commendable and brave on the filmmakers' part; not many studios would make a movie where the character we are supposed to sympathize with pulls that kind of stunt, even in the name of love.

What the film does even better is bringing this often-fantastical story back down to earth. Eventually Nick's crimes (yes, they are crimes) do catch up with him and he is forced to reconcile with his past, while in the book he is able to skirt it yet again. In literature though, disbelief is much more easily suspended than in film, so it is refreshing to see this problem actually brought to light for a medium in which that plot development is simply implausible.

The film also humanizes the actions taken by the characters. Both the young lovers, Nick and Sheeni, pull some pretty bad s*** throughout the course of the story. Exhausted with the situation, Sheeni eventually tells Nick that she can't put up with Nick's shenanigans any longer. ""I'm tired of being alone."" He thoughtfully replies, ""I've been alone all my life. That's why I'm doing this."" A real motive is fueling their love, not just the boredom of disaffected youth (which appears to be the case in the novel).

One minor (unrealistic) critique I have of the film is how comparatively minor in scope the movie is when looking at the novel. The original is an epic 500-page trilogy of books (bound together in one volume) and deservedly so; Nick goes through a lot to finally win over Sheeni. I had been expecting similar treatment for the film (clocking in at at least 2 1/2 hours?) but alas, my contemporary American epic can apparently be told in 90 minutes. Still, I'm amazed they pulled off the stellar project they did.

This movie seems perfect for our contemporary era of culture and sophistication re-entering the base requirements for courtship. The characters (convincingly) discuss arthouse film and dress fashionably (but affordably). Despite its more fantastical elements, this film still seems incredibly weighted and a more realistic depiction of teenage life (well, mine anyways!) than the typical teen sex comedy fare you get in the multiplexes. By far the best high school film in recent memory, and one of the best movies of 2009.",1369440000,,3356,4.827826086956522

The flow was terrible and too many things happened that made me wondering what the hell was really going on. Dont waste your time. I NEVER turn off a movie once I start, but there were 4-5 times I kept asking why I was wasting my time and maybe it would get better. it gets worse with every last minute, descending into an abysmal pit of terrible film-making, especially yin the last 20 minutes of the movie.",1340582400,,534,4.35
3720441,3,B001NPD9Q8,"A fun-story of hypocrisy and teen rebellion as a major character heads towards his male role encouraged by a sixteen-year-old suppressed by her religious parents, is on a landscape of a widely-present isolation, sexism and petty protectionism while younger generation of Americans looking forward to being different from ascendants merely finished in predecessors' footsteps.

Is it in the States only, however???",1340323200,,413,5.770491803278689
3720442,4,B001NPD9Q8,"Somehow I never got around to seeing this in the theaters so it finally arrived on Blu ray and I'm pleasantly surprised.  On the downside, we see Michael Cera playing the same character again.  That is, the high school geek who hasn't been laid.  He ""outruns his coverage"" - I love that line - while on a summer break by the lake.  Portia Doubleday plays the love interest and she's very good.  Throw in a supporting cast like Fred Willard, Steve Buscemi, Justin Long, Zach Galifianakis and others and you have an interesting and fun time.  There's nothing mind bending here, just a straight forward teen romcom that is better than most.

Also watch for Rooney Mara as the high school roommate of Portia's character.  She has a small role but is destined for stardom in the remake of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" playing Lisbeth Salander.  I can now envision her in the role.",1329264000,,880,4.589743589743589

I thought the film could have been more interesting -- I was secretly hoping that the girl ended up using him just to get to french school and that the main guy ended up with the crazy bernice chick.  Not sure if it would've made a better a movie but I was hoping for a different ending.  All in all, the movie is still one of the funniest I've seen!",1324080000,,530,4.147058823529412

3720445,5,B001NPD9Q8,"This is definitely not a film all teenagers will understand and/or get. There are a couple of a-ha moments, but the dialogue is full of wit and sophisticated rhetoric that not all young people will catch.

That being said, the film wasn't interesting at all with the trailer, but the film itself is a magical romp! It is so cool to follow the protagonist in this story and see if he gets the girl. It is a must-have if you a fan of adventurous, love stories.",1318550400,,458,4.325581395348837
3720446,4,B001NPD9Q8,"Michael Cera is usually a very funny young comedian, and my personal favorite moment of his career was his role on Arrested Developement.  Now it seems with the movies he's been starring in as of late, they always focus around girls, relationships and sex.  Youth In Revolt is no different.

However, I feel this movie isn't *quite* as humorous as some of Cera's other movies.  I feel it's time for Michael Cera to branch away from the relationship-type storylines and move into other areas of work.  That's not a criticism of Youth In Revolt- just an observation of Michael Cera's career.  I don't want him to fall into a predictable pattern, or he'll slowly lose his popularity and fame.

Anyway, the storyline is about Michael Cera's character forced to go on vacation with his moms scummy boyfriend.  What was promised by the boyfriend to be a log cabin turns out to be a trailer park instead, lol.

Michael Cera wants a girlfriend *bad*.  Well, as luck would have it, he meets a very attractive girl while on vacation.  The two immediately connect, however the girl is noticeably more mature, experienced and conducts herself in a more responsible way compared to Cera's character.  One memorable spot involves Michael Cera rubbing suntan lotion on her body while at the beach, lol.

I guess my biggest complaint with the film is that there's too much downtime concerning the romantic aspect of Michael Cera and the girl not only falling in love, but communicating with each other via letters and phone calls.  Too much focus around romance, which surprised me.  However, what made up for it is Michael's mom- she has a nasty habit of dating a different selection of men, and each one has a really unique and hilarious personality.

We soon discover that the girl has a boyfriend, so this prompts Michael to try and win over the girls love.  Now here's where the storyline will either win you over or completely turn you off:

Michael invents an alterego character.  Basically the way it works is like this- throughout the movie you will frequently see *two* Michael Cera's having conversations with each other.  Through the magic of film making it looks believable.  The alterego is more daring, willing to take chances, and give a cold hard reality check to the shy, reluctant and uncertain (normal) Michael Cera.  This of course prompts Michael Cera to try harder and make a better impression on the girl.

Overall, this movie contains a fair amount of laughs, but to be totally honest I was hoping for more in the laughter category because the first 10 minutes were really funny, but then the storyline immediately gets serious and the pace slows down dramatically just as soon as Michael meets the girl.  A little disappointing.

On the other hand, the laughs still make a few appearances, and one really funny scene in particular involves the parents tripping on mushrooms.

Not a bad film, but make sure you know what you're watching here- romance first, then drama, and finally comedy.",1313798400,,2998,4.818003913894325
3720447,5,B001NPD9Q8,"This little gem is part Napoleon Dynamite, part Zombieland, and part Twilight Zone.  The basic story, boy meets girl, is old as time, but the bizarre twists and turns it takes along the way to its resolution are hysterical.  The hero, a 16 year old named Nick,invents a bad boy alter-ego in an effort to impress the lady of his dreams.  She's a teenage francophile, who lives with her attorney father and fanatical mother in a two story mobile home located in a trailer park.

Yes, a trailer park is a strange place for a successful lawyer to reside, but it fits in well with the overall weirdness of the movie.

The persona Nick creates quickly takes on a life of its own. It inspires Nick to engage in increasingly destructive juvenile pranks, culminating in an ill-fated attempt to steal the family car.  Just as it appears he and his girl are about to get together, fate intervenes to move them further apart.  This only inspires him to adopt more inventive and increasingly illegal tactics to be with her.

Along the way he must cope with his mother's desperate insecurity, his dad's mid-life crisis inspired childishness, and his girl's charming but infuriating eccentricities.  He also encounters a bevy of unbalanced characters, such as his girls' older brother, who feeds his parents psychedelic mushrooms as a Thanksgiving Day appetizer.

Dry humor runs throughout the script.  For example, when his mother asks, ""What man would want a 48 year old woman with stretch marks?"" Nick replies, ""You're selling yourself short, mom.  There are a number of stretch mark fetishists out there, you know.""

Off the wall, intensely humorous, and ultimately touching, this is a film that shouldn't be missed.  Very highly recommended.",1310688000,,1731,4.924137931034482

Still, this was definitely his best role yet, putting his awkward humor to use, along with allowing him to stretch his chops, as they say, in playing the comically bada$$ Francois Dillinger. Confession: I've read the novel the film is based on. The film is quite tame in comparision, considering that the book opens with two 14 year-olds fellating each. Michael Cera did not fellate anyone in the film. Though he should. Would help his career.",1306454400,,561,4.854166666666667

After viewing this movie several times, I still cannot decide if it is good. I get a very hipster vibe from the movie, but it does have redeeming moments of comedy.

I apologize-- this review will not help many. I just needed to voice the fact that this movie is hard to place in a category.",1303862400,,429,4.047058823529412
3720452,3,B001NPD9Q8,"A little Michael Cera goes a long way -- his trademark diffident, distracted, high-voiced loser act having been losing interest practically since the moment he unrolled it -- so one might be worried about a movie that has Cera in what's essentially two parts. The good news is that he only plays ""Michael Cera"" for one of those parts, and the other's role is to shove that character as far away from Cera-ness as is possible in an hour and a half.

YOUTH IN REVOLT is funny, in a cartoony way, but never has any underlying seriousness to ground that comedy in anything. Cera's Nick Twisp is a sixteen-year-old boy living in Oakland, CA, whose divorced mother falls for a succession of lousy men and whose father is living with a very young woman whose gorgeousness is just another joke. Nick is our main character, center, and narrator; we never get out of his skull or away from his point of view. (So, if you can't stand Cera at all, stay far away from this movie.) And Nick, like all teenage boys, is obsessed with losing his virginity.

If YOUTH IN REVOLT had any balance, or viewpoint outside of Nick, it could have become the Apatow Era's answer to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Darlings/dp/630021396X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Darlings</a>, but it doesn't. On the other hand, it's more sexless than you might expect, since Nick quickly latches onto one girl (Portia Doubleday as Sheeni Saunders) as his True Love and channels all of his adolescent energy into winning her and getting back to her. (They meet at a trailer-park somewhere off to the north of Oakland, where she lives and he vacations with his mother and her then-boyfriend.) For reasons that are sufficient to the plot of the movie, but don't actually make a whole lot of sense, Nick spends most of the running time of YOUTH IN REVOLT trying to be ""bad,"" which will get him back to Sheeni but ever-more drive her very religious and controlling parents away from him.

So Nick manifests an alter ego -- the Nouvelle Vague-inspired French-accented ""Francois Dillinger"" -- who gives him advice on how to be bad at every turn, and rapidly finds himself both in more and more trouble and having more and more fun. If it wasn't so programmatic and constricted, YOUTH IN REVOLT could have been honestly, wickedly subversive, so it can be disappointing to see it settle into its solid groove, but there's a long list of good actors working in support of Cera's double act -- from Justin Long and Zach Galifianakis to Fred Willard and M. Emmett Walsh -- who keep the movie lively.

Cera is fine at the center, and his sunglasses-wearing, smoking Francois could show a way for him to find a different kind of character to play -- he makes a good piece of bored Eurotrash. But YOUTH IN REVOLT is, in the end, a movie about revolt that doesn't actually know what it's revolting against; it's funny enough, and a pleasant way to spend 90 minutes, but the fog of lost possibilities is so thick the actual movie can sometimes be difficult to see.",1303171200,,3062,4.815589353612167
3720453,4,B001NPD9Q8,"Based upon the novels by CD Payne, this film has a typical ""young man out to lose his virginity"" plot that so many teen comedies do. However, it's not a comedy for teens; it's for adults who like comedies, and it happens to be about teens. This film sets itself apart from typical teen-fare with its sharp dialogue and quirky characters. Michael Cera stars and brings his usual nerdy charm to the role yet this time his character has an underlying passionate, smooth talking badassness that shines through in a way that separates him from other similar roles. Some may be quick to pass this off as a ""hipster"" comedy, but they'd be missing the mark--there's no irony in Cera's protagonist. He's all heart and, much like this film, hilarious to watch.",1299974400,,750,4.6893939393939394
3720454,2,B001NPD9Q8,"Nick Twist is an awkward teenage boy who moves with his mother and her loser boyfriend into a trailer park. He meets a pretty girl in the neighborhood with whom he falls in love. He creates a fictitious alter ego in order to become someone that he is not so that he can be with the girl he loves. Michael Cera is effective here as the virginal teenager, and there are moments of levity, but the film just is not as funny as it should have been. A fun movie to watch at times, but will be a disappointment for those expecting another ""Superbad"".",1294185600,,544,4.240384615384615
3720455,2,B001NPD9Q8,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I really wanted to like 'Youth in Revolt' since it began with a likable protagonist, Nick Twisp (in another typical Michael Cera 'insecure with woman' role) and his love interest, Sheeni Saunders (played by attractive newcomer, Portia Doubleday). Also in the mix is a quirky supporting cast including such luminaries as Steve Buscemi, Zach Galifianakis, Ray Liotta and Justin Long.

One is immediately drawn to Nick and Sheeni with their intellectual discussions focusing particularly on film (Nick loves art house Japanese director Ozu and Sheeni is a committed Francophile, with a particular infatuation for the famed French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo). You would never guess that Nick and Sheeni were so cerebral and liberal minded. considering the background of their parents. Nick's mother Estelle has taken up with a low-life boyfriend, Jerry (Galifianakis) who has just sold a lemon of a car to three sailors who want their money back. Jerry and Estelle with Nick in tow, take off for Clearlake (California) where they spend the week in a beat up trailer. Later Jerry has a heart attack and dies and Estelle takes up with an obnoxious Oakland police officer. Meanwhile, Sheeni's parents, who are more middle class, also happen to be fanatical fundamentalist Christians and won't let Sheeni keep 'Albert', a mangy mutt that Nick has purchased for Sheeni.

All of the offbeat banter and characters proves pretty engaging for the first thirty minutes of the film until Nick invents an alter-ego character, Francois Dillinger to help him win Sheeni's heart (he also must contend with Sheeni's preppie boyfriend, Trent Preston, who seeks to undermine Nick at every turn). The alter-ego assisting an insecure male in an attempt to woo a seemingly unobtainable love interest calls to mind the Woody Allen classic,""Play It Again Sam"". You'll recall that the 70s comedy also features a lovable loser who must call upon an iconic film figure to help transform himself into a character who is decidedly confident with women. Play It Again Sam works because the alter-ego is Humphrey Bogart, who not only represents the apotheosis of male confidence with women but also the 'bad boy' who refuses to dispense with his ethical principles despite all the temptations (in Play It Again Sam, Bogart plays Rick, the good guy cafe owner from Casablanca, who saves the girl and defeats the Nazis).

Youth in Revolt, on the other hand, unfortunately gets it all wrong. Dillinger, with his pencil thin moustache, is also supposed to be a 'bad boy', attractive to women. But unlike Bogie, he's ethically challenged. He ends up advising Nick to ""blow up half of Berkeley"". Nick listens to his wilder, demented half and ends up crashing Jerry's Lincoln into a restaurant, causing a fire. Nick's now a wanted man (or rather a juvenile delinquent wanted by the police). Nick does more sorry things.

After going to the exclusive French private girl's boarding school where Sheeni has been exiled by her parents, Nick meets Bernice Lynch, Sheeni's next door neighbor at school, and tells her that Trent has been badmouthing her. In order to get back at Trent, he convinces Lynch to place sedatives in Sheeni's drinks. Sheeni ends up getting expelled after constantly falling asleep in class.

Since Dillinger is so unlikeable and Nick constantly takes his advice, we lose complete respect for the protagonist. Unlike Woody Allen, who through Bogart's advice becomes self-actualized, Nick becomes completely unhinged. At the end of the film, Nick attempts to stage his own death by pretending to be in a car that falls off a cliff. The bungled stunt is seen for what it is in front of a few local police officers who observe Nick fleeing in his underpants. What kind of moral are we supposed to take away from this film? That committing crimes are advisable, leading to success with women? In the end, even Sheeni has lost her sheen. She falls for the pathetic Nick and appears to acquiesce in his misbehavior. It's Sheeni who reassures him that he'll only do three months in the slammer.

Nick has more than one sidekick in 'Youth in Revolt' and they're all underdeveloped. His best friend Lefty has little screen time and by watching the DVD extras you can see that the rest of his scenes were left on the cutting room floor. Better is the second sidekick, Vijay, an Indian from South Africa played by the talented Adhir Kalyan who I predict we will see more of in the years to come. Vijay has a few amusing bits when he accompanies Nick in his foray to Sheeni's boarding school. He's also seen in an animated sequence while he drives with Nick in his grandmother's car. Finally there's Paul, Sheeni's brother, who Nick bonds with for a short time over a bunch of psychedelic mushrooms.

While the quirky characters which I alluded to before are initially engaging, they are all so underdeveloped that by the time the film concludes, we care little about them. Buscemi is particularly left high and dry in his one-note depiction of a constantly angry parent who finds himself unable to connect and bond with his alienated son.- Youth in Revolt does have some rather neat 'claymation' animated sequences, highlighted during the opening and closing credits. Coupled with an effective 'folky' soundtrack as well as clever editing, 'Youth' comes across better for its look rather than its content.

I don't know how the films' backers could have allowed the scenarists here to so easily undermine the solid character of the films' protagonists. This could have been a simple story about an insecure, geeky kid who gains confidence with women by inventing and then following the lead of his own 'bad boy' creation--a bad boy however, that still has some heart and soul. Unfortunately, the alter ego has no class and it makes little sense that the 'good kid' would choose to go down such a dark path.",1291161600,6,5914,4.935678391959799
3720456,5,B001NPD9Q8,"This is a film that seems strange at first watching, but after a second viewing the movie is absolutely hilarious.  Similar to films like ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and ""Observe in Report,"" ""Youth in Revolt"" is an indie-esque movie with amazing performances praising its great source material.  This is my favorite film with Michael Cera, and he definately displays all of his talent in this movie.  The ability to play two distinct personalities that do not seem as if they are the same person, is a quality that makes Cera a fine actor.  The supporting cast is perfectly formed with actors like Buscemi and Justin Long.  I disagree with the critical reviews saying that Cera and Doubleday have no chemistry.  Their chemistry is practically flowing out of my big screen and spilling onto the floor.  And then I'll have to call Stanley Steamer to clean the chemistry off my rug.  Anyway, what makes this a five star film follows:

*Hilarious script due to source material
*Every actor perfect for the role
*Amazing soundtrack that's worth buying
*The indie flavor to the film
*Crisp cinematography
*Animations and claymations(very creative way to move through a scene)

Is it worth getting on blu-ray you ask? Absolutely!  The picture looks astonishing.  The special features kind of lack, but there's enough to satisfy the casual Blu-rayer.  Youth in Revolt is not for everyone, but it's one of my favorite comedies. Now I'm definately drawn to the C.D. Payne books.  I'll be satisfied if they're half this entertaining.",1281312000,,1517,4.99203187250996

3720458,3,B001NPD9Q8,"This film is quite polarizing. Some people really like it, and some think it's the worst film ever. I myself am in the former category, with some reservations. The film was released in January this year and did poorly at the box office. I think this is due to two reasons: 1. The release date (nobody sees a film in January); 2. The film really has no target audience. Whereas a film like ""The Hangover"" was so successful because virtually anyone could enjoy it, this film is the opposite; it's a mainstream film designed for a very small niche.

Based on a 500 page novel by C. D. Payne, ""Youth in Revolt"" is a very strange movie. I have not read the novel, but I assume the film offers a very condensed, Cliffs-Notes like retelling of the story. Michael Cera (that awkward guy from ""Superbad"" and ""Juno"") stars as 16-year-old Nick Twisp, a Holden Caulfield-like character.

 Nick lives with his erratic mom, Estelle (Jean Smart), and her oafish boyfriend, Jerry (Zach Galifinakis of the aforementioned ""Hangover""), in Oakland, California. When Jerry owes a group of sailors money for a car, Jerry takes Estelle and Nick on vacation to Clearlake to a trailer park, where Nick meets Sheeni Saunders (Portia Doubleday), a beautiful girl with shard interests. Nick spends time with Sheeni, learning that she's just as neurotic as he is. She tells him she already has a boyfriend in the jock/poet Trent Preston (Jonathan Bradford Wright), and Nick makes up a girlfriend named Martha to impress Sheeni. Sheeni later reads his diary and is not upset that he lied to her. They buy a dog, whom Sheeni names Albert (pronounced Al-Bear), who becomes their ""lovechild."" When it comes time for Nick to leave, Sheeni encourages him to be ""very, very bad"" so he can move to Ukiah to live with his temperamental father, George (Steve Buscemi), and they can be together.

Back at home, Nick coaxes his best friend, Lefty (Erik Knudsen), to keep Albert for him since Estelle hates dogs. Nick creates an alter-ego to help him with his misdeeds, a French boy by the name of Franois Dillinger (Sheeni dreams of her French husband to be named Franois), who has a deeper voice, a mustache, blue eyes, and a player/bad boy attitude. With Franois' help, Nick begins to mouth off to his mom and her new boyfriend, police officer Lance Wescott (Ray Liotta) (Jerry has just died of a heart attack in a bar). Nick soon causes the most trouble when Franois takes the family car and trailer out onto the streets with gasoline in the back seat and ""accidentally"" lets the trailer go, sending it crashing into a local restaurant. Then Franois lets go of the car, spiraling it into the trailer, causing a huge explosion and traffic jam.

I will not go into any more detail, so as not to spoil anything. While it's not for everyone, I liked it.

This isn't much of a romantic comedy but more of a  lets see how screwed up this kid really is.  Especially when you find out he purposely creates an alter-ego to carry out his misdeeds or rebellious actions.

3720464,4,B001NPD9Q8,"I found this movie to be very funny, it had
it's own personality, and young Michael Cera
did as amazing job as the odd, alienated,
unsure-of-himself,teenager Nick Twisp,
filled with suppressed anger and pent-up
sexual frustration who has a mother, Estelle,
(played by a very skinny Jean Smart) who is
trailer trash, lives for whatever man is in
her life at the moment, and totally ignores
(for the most part) her young odd loner son,
as long as it doesn't effect her child support
payments or he doesn't do anything to embarass her
or come between her & her boyfriends!
His father, George, is played by the great quirky
actor Steve Buscemi. He has recently divorced the
Jean Smart character and has taken up with a
ridiculously younger woman who occupies all of
his time just trying to keep up with her.
He's a pretty cool father, (though temperamental)
just as long as the kid stays out of his way and
doesn't cause too much trouble. Cena's character
also later develops an alter-ego/evil twin/doppelganger
named Francois Dillinger who is a complete sociopath
and rebel who doesn't care about anything!
(He reminds me a little of Kourtney Kardashian's
arrogant, obnoxious and aloof boyfriend, Scott Disick!)
Social decorum, the property, thoughts or feelings of
others all mean nothing to him!
He scoffs at authority, isn't respectful of women,
just sees them as sex objects, and loves to shake
things up in a big way!---Michael Cena plays the
dual roles with great finesse!
His comic timing is amazing and he is able infuse
both characters with very believable emotions,
separate mindsets, and other personality quirks
which will have you totally buying it!
Without giving away the rest of the story,
I will just say that there are plenty of laughs,
mayhem, crazy situations, and memorable dialogue

lines from their favorite movies in everyday conversation!(-:
The supporting cast is a stellar ensemble of actors!

a pretty good sense of humor and fun. (-:

Those reviewers on here who are comparing it to
""Fight Club"" (?), James Dean (?), etc., I don't know
what movie they saw or what they expected this film to be,

3720467,1,B001NPD9Q8,"Movies about rebellious youth have been a staple for years. Perhaps the most well known was REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE which turned James Dean into the poster boy for troubled youth. Few films have stood the test of time like that one though and it appears the YOUTH IN REVOLT will be lucky to make the list on the bottom rung.

Nick Twisp (Michael Cera) is your typical teen, dreaming on having his first sexual encounter while doing what all teens apparently do in films these days, a little self stimulation. Nick lives with his divorced mother (Jean Smart) and her oaf of a boyfriend Jerry (Zack Galifiankis). His father (Steve Bushemi) lives with his 25 year old girlfriend. Yes, everyone seems to be having ""romance"" with the exception of Nick.

When a car sale goes bad, Jerry takes the extended family to a ""cabin"" a friend of his owns. Instead they come to a trailer park with a trailer that has seen better days. But it is here that Nick meets Sheeni (Portia Doubleday). Its love/lust at first sight and soon all of Nick's days are spent with Sheeni as she talks about wanting to travel the world, to see France, to have a French boyfriend. To say that this teen is pretentious would be an understatement.

All goes well until Nick learns that Sheeni has a boyfriend named Trent (who's never seen until the third act of the film), the stereotypical preppie that everyone loves. When Nick's family moves back home, Sheeni suggests that Nick find a way to have his mother kick him out so that he can move back. She even helps his father get a job in the town she lives in. All Nick needs to do is find that inner bad boy and be forced to move in with his father.

Thus Nick's alter ego, Francois Dillinger is born. Sporting a pencil thin moustache and chain smoking, Francois ""tells"" Nick what he needs to do to get kicked out. Nick's new boyfriend (Jerry died of a heart attack) is policeman Lance Westcott (Ray Liotta). Of course Francois encourages Nick to pop off to him at any given moment. When Nick steals his mother's car (and the trailer Jerry purchased) and accidentally blows them up in Berkley, his mother gives him his wish and sends him packing.

Unfortunately Sheeni's strictly religious folks learned of their plans and have sent Sheeni off to a boarding school. Which is also where Trent goes to school. Off Nick goes with his new best friend to try and win back the girl he loves.

If none of this sounds preposterous so far then continue viewing. Everything from psychedelic mushrooms to calling the police names is brought into the mix as Nick continues to try and win the affections of Sheeni.

Cera has made a career out of playing the likeable but dorky loser and this film does little to show another side of his acting ability. Sure, he doubles up here as Francois, but that character has little to do except talk nasty and offer Nick bad suggestions to follow through on. Cera may be a likeable guy in real life but after playing the same role over and over again I just find him little more than annoying. I also fear what will become of him once he finally hits the age where he no longer looks 16. At 22 that day is just around the corner.

I know they were trying to go for a teen comedy with a touch of romance here but I just couldn't help but think someone should just slap some sense into these two characters. I didn't feel anything for either of them except pity at how they had dreams of a life that doesn't exist, a dream of romance that exists only in Harlequin romance novels. Real life is much more interesting and romantic.

There are a few funny moments in the film, most of which were seen in the trailer for it. If you've watched that at all, you've enjoyed the best laughs it has to offer. But this is not a film that you'll want to hang on to and watch over and over again. I'd be hard pressed to want to watch it even a second time. For Cera fans you'll love it. For anyone else, find another movie to rent/purchase.

As I look at other reviews here for this same film I find myself wondering if they were written by people who watched the same film. While I had an occasional laugh, I never developed more than a chuckle. And then I began to notice that many of those reviews discussed the book and how faithful the film stayed to it. Perhaps had I read the book I would have enjoyed it more. But since I didn't, I found it rather tedious and (as someone else stated) felt that Cera does nothing more than the same character over and over again. If you enjoyed this film, I'm happy for you. If you plan on renting it, more forward at your own risk.",1276560000,4,4600,4.3695906432748535

In the show Arrested Development he was already building up this straight guy persona, with this kind of geek, nerd appeal. YOUTH IN REVOLT was the perfect vehicle for this actor. Cera really makes this movie his own and in my opinion could be a neo-cult classic along the same lines as Schwartzman in Rushmore. The evil alternate-character Cera switches back and forth from steals every scene.  Cera has become an actor in the same tradition as Jack Lemmon.

So there is a bunch of elements and plot points missing before he moved with his dad and more missing after. So overall I think the attempt was ok...but the story never had a chance to build correctly and the will certaintly be no chance for a sequel. Still funny moments though.... Read the book...

The film itself is a far cry from the hilarious prose of the witty novel that inspired it. However by itself, Youth in Revolt is surely a great romantic comedy, and Michael Cera's best performance to date. If you are looking for a short, well-directed, well-acted and hilarious romp then look no further. This is a movie I think all movie buffs should add to their collection and one that sadly went unnoticed in theaters.

3720473,3,B001NPD9Q8,"Your enjoyment of YOUTH IN REVOLT will mostly directly correlate to a) how much you like Michael Cera's ""signature"" film persona & b) how anxious you are to see him try something else.

Whether he's Nick in NICK & NORA'S INFINITE PLAYLIST, George Michael in ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT or the guy in SUPERBAD or the caveman guy in YEAR ONE...Cera mostly gives one performance, that is only modulated by as little as he can get away with.  (Let me be clear...when he's modulated his performance right on the money, he's both hilarious and touching...his role on ARRESTED was eye-opening, his performance in SUPERBAD was hilarious and his part in JUNO was nearly perfect.)  His characters are usually very intelligent and very nave.  Open & sincere, yet confused by life.  Sharp-tongued about life's obstacles, but also pretty much resigned to being able to do nothing about them.

That's Cera's character in YOUTH IN REVOLT, in which he plays a smart and smart-mouthed teen named Nick Twisp, who pretty much coasts through life on his own, rather than have to engage with his mother (Jean Smart, always welcome in ANY role) and her series of dubious boyfriends (from Zach Galifinakis to Ray Liotta).  He very much wants to meet a girl, but he's pretty much resigned to believing that isn't going to happen anytime soon.  Despite being able to toss off cultural reference jokes that most viewers won't get...Twisp is also so shy, stammering and soft-spoken that it's almost hard to believe the two traits can exist in one character.  But this is what Cera excels at...and again, if you like that you may love this film.

However, I've decided that my patience for this character has just about run its course.  I'll always like Michael Cera for the laughs he's given me...but it sure feels like his character is exhausted.  In YEAR ONE, I forgave him because the overall film was so flaccid and unimaginative.  But YOUTH IN REVOLT is the sort of film that plays to his strengths (a modern day kid), and he fails to evoke much sympathy or empathy. I want him to try something else!

When Nick Twisp meets Sheeni Saunders (Portia Doubleday) while on summer vacation at a trailer park by a lake, he falls madly in love and lust with her.  Amazingly, she seems to like him as well, but fate keeps them apart, and Twisp doesn't have the personality to use the aggression needed to track her down and declare his feelings.  So he ""invents"" a duel persona in Francois Dillinger (Sheeni likes all things French), who is a dare-devil who persuades Nick to engage in wildly unsafe activities.

The film has some really funny moments, including a hilarious scene in which Nick attempts to fake his own death.  There is plenty of verbal wit, and some low key charm (Doubleday is an unknown face, so her Sheeni feels very fresh and it's easy to see why Nick is charmed and frustrated by her.)  But often the film is tone-deaf.  It wants to be gentle teen romance...yet we also get to see Steve Buscemi dole out lots of his standard issue screaming.  (We also get to see Ray Liotta trot out his standard-issue ""creepiness."") Fred Willard plays that part HE always plays.  Justin Long looks deeply tired and uninterested (as he has in many movies recently).

In the end, much of the film just feels kind of limp and uninspired.  There are laughs and some pleasures to be had, but virtually everyone simply seems to be coasting on the ghosts of past success.  It's as though someone like Steve Buscemi is saying ""hey, remember how great I've been in other films?  Well, just assume my performance here is just as great, and I won't really make the effort.""  The script itself inspires little else, and the director (Miguel Arteta) hasn't forced the issue.  Much of the film takes place during a lazy, slow-paced summer a couple of decades ago.  The whole film feels lazy and slow paced too.",1263859200,2,3865,4.701337295690936
