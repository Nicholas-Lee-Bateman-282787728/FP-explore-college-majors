8631174,4,B00H9GIADW,"There are two seasons and so far I have only purchased and watched season one.
If you like space exploration and dream about future colonization, you will like this story.  However, the main characters are overly macho expressed with strength, drunkiness and sex with random women.  One is a construction worker that operates skyscraper cranes and frequents strip bars.  Another is a military pilot.  It should be rated 16+ due to the scenes with females.
The background art, is well done especially camera angles along the Z-axis.  Character drawings are average and character animation is average.  Dialogue is average as much of it is exposition that states the obvious or has the unlikely scenario of an experienced astronaut surprised or educated by a newbie.  If you haven't studied aerospace engineering, then you will appreciate it.
Space agencies drill astronauts to perform tasks until memorized to avoid mistakes but this story allows mistakes to happen and emphasizes solutions that would likely occur which effectively demonstrate risks astronauts face, physics mechanics and basic orbital mechanics.
Season one involves the ISS, NASA Space Shuttle and a state-of-the-art space plane.  The technology used and the politics are intriguing.  Everything is modern but not futuristic.  You can imagine it happening for real.",1422748800,,1333,5.396135265700483
