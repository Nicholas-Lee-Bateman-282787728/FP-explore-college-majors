5622320,2,B00BI5YEWG,"The DVD works, but something is kind of fishy....No extras. I think this may not be the offical version. But it works, If you want more extrra's , do not buy., wait to buy it from the stores.",1367366400,3,191,4.052631578947368
5622321,1,B00BI5YEWG,I am surprised by this... and I hate to say I will not be purchasing season 3 of the Cleveland show in this poor format. My main reason for purchasing the season sets is to get the deleted scenes and creator commentaries. I'll hold off until a release of what I have come to expect comes about. This better not become a new normal for releases of these shows. What happened FOX? You can do better than this...or is this all part of a plan to keep the Black Cartoon Character down? I'll buy it when a quality release is available. Cleveland Brown is not amused!,1366502400,26,560,4.2924528301886795
5622322,1,B00BI5YEWG,DVD-R.....come on Fox. No special features or subtitles. This was a waste of $23.00 especially if you have net-flix. Do not buy.,1366416000,19,128,4.863636363636363
5622323,1,B00BI5YEWG,"+1, what a shame for FOX and Amazon to sell DVDRs! moreover, $25... more expensive than retail DVDs lol

won't buy it too, I prefer to wait a retail DVD, even if it won't be release!
they spit on fans!

really hope the retail DVD will be release!!
after an announcement by the website ""tvbythjenumbers"" ([...]) that the show will be cancel, no DVDs for the 3rd and 4th season will be another bad news for this show :/

hope Cleveland will return to live in Quahog ^^",1366156800,13,466,4.2727272727272725
5622324,1,B00BI5YEWG,This is unacceptable! I have purchased every DVD set in Seth McFarlane's animated world and this is what is released? I feel ultimatly betrayed! No choices... No extras... No nothing... Other than only half the episodes being uncensored there is absolutely no point in purchasing this. DVD-R is an incredibly short-lived format compared to factory pressings. Why oh why does FOX feel the need to screw their fans with this giant middle finger?,1365984000,17,443,5.082191780821918
5622325,4,B00BI5YEWG,"So many episodes....most of them are very good and entertaining...keep them comming!!
AS good as season 1 and 2...... a keeper",1365120000,,126,5.0476190476190474
5622326,5,B00BI5YEWG,"I share my fellow reviewers' sentiment... This is better than nothing, but we fans don't get the extras we've come to love and appreciate. STILL... I guess we should be happy that we have this. However, for being a DVD-R product, the quality was pretty good.

Now, for me, this leads to other questions... Is ""Bob's Burgers"" - a rather recent and most outstanding show - going to follow suit? And why can't the same thing be done for the remaining ""King Of The Hill"" seasons that never made it to DVD? ""Malcolm In The Middle""? I can't see why not, but only time will tell...",1364947200,2,574,4.415094339622642
5622327,3,B00BI5YEWG,"As the previous reviewer noted, you get the episodes on recordable media and nothing else. I can't help but feel a bit cheated by FOX that they couldn't have tossed a little something extra into this like deleted scenes, especially when they post a link on the back to report defective DVDs back to them at Foxconnect rather than Amazon. Still, King of the Hill fans waited for years to get their final season on DVD so at least this didn't keep us waiting and eventually giving up on it ever coming out. I also want to add the the episodes don't look as sharp as those I have on my DVR in HD which is a bit distracting.",1362700800,6,620,4.218487394957983
5622328,4,B00BI5YEWG,"The good news: After being on amazon for over a year, The Cleveland Show Season 3 has finally begun shipping! The bad news: the discs are DVD-R MOD (Manufactured on Demand).

So what's the deal here? You get an official, more or less factory burned DVD-R, including a full color disc label, and a full color inlay. All with official art work made for this DVD release by 20th Century Fox. The package is factory sealed, exactly like on a regular DVD release. In other words: this is an official release, the only difference is the DVD-R media, which of course has a severely reduced lifespan to factory pressed DVD's.

This exclusive Amazon.com release includes all 22 episodes of Season Three, uncensored (there is no option to have censored audio). Audio is Dolby Digital 2.0, no subtitles, region 1, NTSC, Dual-Layer (no flipper discs, yay!) and there are no special features. Here are the episode list disc by disc.

Disc One:
BFFs
The Hurricane
Nightmare On Grace Street
Skip Day
Yemen Party
Sex And The Biddy
Die Semi-Hard
Y Tu Junior Tambien

Disc Two:
There Goes El Neighborhood
Dancing With The Stools
Brown Magic
'Til Deaf
Das Shrimp Boot
March Dadness
The Men In Me

Disc Three:
Frapp Attack
American Prankster
B.M.O.C.
Jesus Walks
Flush Of Genius
Mama Drama
All You Can Eat

Overall, if you're a fan of The Cleveland Show, and like your TV shows on DVD, this is a MUST HAVE! I'm happy Amazon has released this albeit only as a MOD DVD-R. Let's just hope Season 4 also gets released on DVD!",1362528000,15,1501,4.62406015037594

5622336,1,B00BI5YEWG,"I buy a lot of DVDs and Blu-Rays. I love movies, I love this show, as well as the other MacFarlane-Shows, and I have the all !

DVD-R is a massive slap in the face of fans like me ! Maybe this ist a good solution for niche products for a few hundred people, like an old movie almost nobody remembers.

But I can not accept a current, succesful series on inferior media like this. Charging the full price for this... it's just smelly icing on a disgusting cake.

I will not buy any DVD-R, if they do not publish a proper DVD-/BluRay-Set, so be it - I will wait.",1406764800,,560,4.072727272727272
5622337,5,B00BI5YEWG,"This series is great!  Cleveland is hilarious, and the story lines flow better than family guy.  A lot of reviewers left bad rankings because of the lack of deleted scenes and commentary.  Those things aren't that big of a deal to me.  It's a great show (except for the language) and should get good ratings.",1404864000,,308,4.545454545454546
5622338,5,B00BI5YEWG,"Great show. Very funny. One of those shows that I find myself laughing out loud to. I was sorry to hear that season 4 was their last season. Season 3 had more musical episodes than the other seasons I believe. This show was very funny and am happy to have it, even tho amazon video on demand.  5 stars !",1403481600,,303,4.05
5622339,1,B00BI5YEWG,"Seasons 3 and 4 of the Cleveland show get no stars. I bought and returned these seasons twice...cheap quality,no extras...and by the way...they don't play in any dvd players anywhere...ever......save your money, don't support seth mcsellout",1402531200,,240,5.694444444444445
5622340,1,B00BI5YEWG,"The character Cleveland is not strong enough to have his own show. I enjoyed his character in Family Guy and found him very funny but it's OVERKILL and it tries to hard for a laugh. I've seen every episode giving it chance after chance but you can't force bad down someone's throat. It tries to hard to be like Family Guy and the writing is awful, the jokes fall flat each episode and it's what I've come to expect. I have given up on this flat spin off series of non carbonated grape soda. Don't see this series lasting to much longer.",1399248000,,536,4.264705882352941
5622341,5,B00BI5YEWG,"Im a Fan, you either like it or you don't.. a little stereotypical as far as Race is concerned, but the show is so well written it can be overlooked and accepted far better then similar shows such as the Spin-off  from Family Guy or American Dad. I think both shows are tasteless obnoxious and mean spirited to say the least, its all about the delivery, and the supporting characters are hilarous the rifle toting  Red Neck, the Tie wearing Cable Customer service Rep Bear, his loud mouth smack talkng step son Rollo, Sad but the Collection is more Special now that their Canceled, can't wait to own the last Season, Season 4",1394755200,2,625,4.522123893805309
5622342,1,B00BI5YEWG,"Who cares? Having The Cleveland Show as a Family Guy spinoff at the time. Now it's just lame. It lacks originality. Basically Cleveland has become the black Peter Griffin. The only two good characters are Rollo and Cleveland Jr.

They are ALL the same. Family Guy, American Dad and The Cleveland Show. While I still like the first five seasons of Family Guy, it ""jumped the shark"" within the last two seasons. Plus it's gotten way too mean. At first Family Guy was mean but funny. Now it's just outright cruel. Forget MacFarlane. Now it's Bob's Burgers for me.",1393113600,,560,4.656565656565657
5622343,5,B00BI5YEWG,"i chose this 5 star rating, because i still like these series, ad i never had a problem right now.  i will let everyone know if i o have a problem.  i know everyone had a problem with these series.  i still recommend these series to everyone that loves the family guy.",1392249600,2,268,4.115384615384615
5622344,4,B00BI5YEWG,"I don't know why everyone is complaining.  The videos are of good quality and I haven't had any trouble with the discs.  Everything is there that I want.  There are no special features, but that's not a deal breaker for me.  Having these DVDs is better in my opinion than having to pirate the individual episodes or buying each episode.

If this is what they are going to do with the other animated FOX shows, then get on with it.  I'm building my library for my AppleTV.",1389052800,,471,4.35632183908046
5622345,5,B00BI5YEWG,Funny and Great Show.  It was a shame to see it get cancelled.  I wish it had lasted more seasons.,1388966400,2,98,3.85
5622346,1,B00BI5YEWG,"I ordered this as a gift without reading the reviews because I thought they were just reviews of the show itself. The note about it being produced when ordered is misleading. The DVDs are no better than cheap counterfeit copies. Amazon didn't even try to make them look authentic--the label is all white except for the Cleveland Show logo, and the reverse side looks like a ""burned"" disc. Worse than this, our DVD player just shut down when the disc was inserted. It had to be unplugged and plugged back in to get the disc out. If this were a seller other than Amazon, I'm sure they would be dumped for trying to pass this off as a good product. Sure, you can say it's new because you just produced it, but it doesn't live up the the qualifications of the other new products offered. I had to give it one star just to post this, but I don't think it deserves even a half.",1388016000,2,871,4.284848484848485
5622347,5,B00BI5YEWG,"I have to try and offset these negative reviews.
You fools do realize that by giving a negative review to these DVD-R releases all but guarantees that we won't get Season 4(final) on DVD at all!!! Thanks a pant load folks! Now I have yet another series from FOX that will go incomplete on my DVD shelf!
If you have audio/picture issues it's likely a bad burn and a replacement would be sent by Amazon no problem.
As for lack of extra features... Get over it! Just be glad the DVD was released at all!",1386633600,5,500,4.273684210526316

5622350,3,B00BI5YEWG,I swear I think American Dad and The Cleveland show is an excuse for Seth MacFarlane to get quick cash on suckers and idiots to watch this somewhat okay slop! I mean some of it is funny but Family Guy makes it funny from one random joke to another rather having a straight through plot point! I am not expert in criticizing  but I can take a wild armature's guess and get it right when I say this is okay but not close to being good as Family Guy! On the bright side this show has been cancelled but on the dark side American Dad is still kicking!,1383177600,,547,4.064814814814815

5622354,2,B00BI5YEWG,"I agree with all the complaints people have about this amazingly lazy release - lack of any extras at all (including subtitles), etc. I see that Fox Home Entertainment has still found the time to put very long unskippable openings on each disc and (also now unskippable) warnings after every SINGLE EPISODE!

While I suppose the sound was mixed in matrixed Dolby Surround and thus the lack of 5.1 isn't anything but a formatting problem, I find it incredibly annoying that the soundtracks weren't encoded properly and I had to turn on the Pro Logic myself. This is also not a good sign, if all but the highest profile shows get barer-than-bare-bones releases on volatile media... what is going to happen in the future? Why are they charging full price for this BS?

But the reason I am moved to write a review now is that for some reason the sound mixes - especially on the first half dozen or so episodes - are incredibly loud, as in everything sounds so range-compressed it is headache-inducing, even when I halve my sound system's volume from its usual level. How did THAT happen? Why does it sound worst at the beginning of the season? Who knows? At this point, with the exception of the occasional uncensored word and the credits, consumers might as well just make DVD-Rs from the Fox broadcasts, so if that's not what the home video division wants, it better step up its game.

The episodes themselves are fine. Season 3 is a little sillier but still enjoyable.",1372118400,10,1467,4.656370656370656
5622355,2,B00BI5YEWG,It works but it is almost like a ripped copy. I'm the weirdo that loves the extras and this is just a cheap piece of poo poo. If you like the extras don't get this version.,1370736000,8,172,3.8055555555555554

5622357,2,B00BI5YEWG,"For as good as the first two seasons are... this set is equally bad. It provides no menus for language, subtitles, captioning or censoring - hence even though I had ordered a supposedly uncensored set - three guess what I DIDN'T get. I'm getting really wary of purchasing items from here anymore.",1368921600,7,296,4.711538461538462
5622358,1,B00BI5YEWG,"Seriously. What the hell. I ordered an exchange and I hope it doesn't have the same problems. However I'm doubtful because all three discs skip and have sound that doesn't match the picture. It would be more understandable if it were only one disc that doesn't work properly, but it's all three. The discs are purple in colour and appear to be burned. They also have large scuffs that won't buff out. So disappointed. Great show, but horrible product.",1368230400,18,451,4.7215189873417724

These DVD-R's are ridiculous and shouldn't be sold for $30, they should be given for free. No extras, cut scenes, commentary- nothing. You think they'd still be considerate to fans who are hearing impaired by at least adding the subtitles option, but no they can't even do that.

Just watch seasons 3 & 4 on Netflix. That's what I'm going to do.",1433635200,,526,4.26
