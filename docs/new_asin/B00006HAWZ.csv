7968896,3,B00006HAWZ,"This movie had all the ingredients to be a 4-star movie. The only problem is that the director, producers and screenwriters never cooked all the ingredients. They had all the basics to make a good movie. I am a Michael Worth fan, but his fight scene was too predictable and fleeting. There should have been more violence and in a place with more lighting. It always helps in this genre if the hero gets his but kicked in the middle of the movie by the main villian, so that at the end , with the big climactic scene, he will return the favor. That never happened. The chemestry was there between Worth's character and the female lead, played very well by Sharisse Bernard, but no love making scenes, which always makes her peril at the end more worthwile. I never really got a bead on ""THE STORY"".  This movie ended way to abruptly, which took away from the movie in a big way. No hero, at the end just stabs the villian, who falls into a pool and then the words ""THE END"" . There was not final fight scene. I was waiting for the fight scene. Had I rented this movie, I would not have bought it, but it is worth  keeping in my collection. Three stars is a bit generous, since the movie was so fragmented, but I cannot post a 2.75. I was left with many questions , when I did not have to be. I wonder why?",1172793600,2,1304,4.191235059760956
7968897,3,B00006HAWZ,"ESSENCE OF ECHOES is filmed video-cam style digitally, and once you get used to that, the movie isn't as bad as it could have been.  This type of filming tends to limit such suspense gimmicks as car chases, ultra fighting scenes (although Michael Worth pulls off a nice karate fight with villain Yan Birch), and other things that ""pump"" up a movie.  Watching this movie is like watching a true crime video, and it suffers some from that.  The good old government is responsible for the madman in this one, having decided to splice the genes of several notorious serial killers to come up with the ultimate killing machine.  Needless to say, the experiment was ditched, but not the killer.  There are a couple of gruesome death scenes, and even a modicum of suspense in some of the spooky lighted scenes.  Michael Worth as the bad guy agent gone good does a sturdy, macho job.  His swagger and self containment help strengthen his character.  Sharisse Baker-Bernard as his partner Julia doesn't have the strength of conviction to make us care too much for her, even though she's had her own share of nightmares, evidenced in her recurring dreams. There's a kind of double climax, and it is effective, and ultimately saves the movie from being a total waste.  A rental, but not a buyer.",1083715200,,1284,4.696428571428571
