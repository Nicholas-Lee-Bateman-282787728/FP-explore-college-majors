2420897,4,B000BK670Q,"I've had this video for awhile, but just finally did it this morning. I really liked it. It starts off with basic stretches/warm-up. Then goes into 4 moves at 20 reps each (punches, squats kicks, swaying from side to side in semi squat/plie pose and pulling your arms in and out while in a plie pose). He then goes into a power yoga segment and finshes with a cooldown/stretch. I had a nice sweat going on when I was done. I don't think I would do this at nite (which they suggest you can) because it gave me too much energy to then have to go to bed. Though, it is perfect for a morning workout to start your day. I would definitely do this one again.",1172016000,19,652,4.141732283464567
2420898,2,B000BK670Q,I was looking for a shorter substitute for P90X Yoga which is a little long at 90 minutes and sometimes a little too advanced for me.  This video swings in the complete other direction.  It will be great for someone just beginning yoga?  Maybe someone working back from an injury?  Or maybe not....  It includes about 20 minutes of slow stretching and then some out of place punching moves and then some fast paced yoga for about 8 minutes.  it's really just an odd workout in my opinion.,1372032000,2,488,4.488636363636363
2420899,3,B000BK670Q,i bought this DVD to compare it with another one that i had ordered at the same time.  i decided that it wouldn't suit my needs and i sent it back for a refund.,1359936000,,160,3.7058823529411766
2420900,2,B000BK670Q,"I was expecting slow, fluid movements, also Hawaiian style movements. The video starts slow, then jumps to an extreme fast pace and doesn't give you enough time to hold the movements. After doing it once, I gave it away.",1348012800,3,220,4.666666666666667
2420901,5,B000BK670Q,I'm always looking for 30 minute workouts.  This video is my favorite!  I get a complete workout with beautiful scenery in less than 30 minutes.  Tony's easy going style allows me to workout at my own pace and comfort.,1327708800,2,218,4.538461538461538
2420902,5,B000BK670Q,"I really enjoy the two yoga DVDs from Tony Horton's One on One series, Patience Hummingbird and Fountain of Youth; both are excellent. I picked this one up for some more variety and to give it a try. It is a little dated - it came out in 2004, before P90X. It is a good workout, but not wholly yoga. There is a little kempo, and a little cardio. It is 35 minutes, and I am planning on working it in regularly as an extra workout. Tony mentions in the video that it can be good to start the day if you are really stiff, or to end the day. As I said, the video is a little dated, but working out with Tony on a beach in Hawaii, with the sounds of the waves and the surf, helps enhance the workout. I do personally prefer the One on One yoga workouts but as Tony often states: 'different is good', and this adds one more yoga workout to my catalog.",1323043200,,845,3.976470588235294
2420903,5,B000BK670Q,"I saw this DVD mentioned on a review of another yoga program that I liked. I picked up a a copy on Ebay cheap. I don't know why this wonderful little workout is out of print. It's terrific.

I have never seen a Tony Horton workout before and I am impressed enough to get more of his work. This workout will make you break a sweat but it's nothing like intensive cardio. I have been very out of shape because of a bad knee and sedentary lifestyle and being plain lazy, so even some beginner yoga programs are a bit much for me. After doing this (and starting to keep up!)I have enough confidence and more importantly enough strength and flexibility to move on to more strenuous programs without re-injuring my knee. Or my back, or shoulders or other bits I am fond of. Hey, I even did my first half a pushup! Since I've never been able to do more then a quarter pushup, that's a huge accomplishment.

Tony is a very motivating person and I really liked his no-pressure style. I wish that this DVD had more then one 27 minute workout on it. It's brilliant and if you can find it grab it!",1294704000,3,1085,4.262135922330097
2420904,5,B000BK670Q,"I agree with the other reviewers.  This is a great am ""rev-up"" or workout for an off day.  It gets fairly intense for about 5 minutes,really hitting the thighs and glutes, but mostly is stretching and breathing.

It also explains why Tony had his eye job! I'm not much on men's plastic surgery, but the boy sure needed it.  I don't even know how he could see out of his wrinkly baggy eyes!",1286755200,,389,4.287671232876712
2420905,5,B000BK670Q,"As a former college athlete (baseball) who had gotten out of shape through the years I decided to start working out again a couple of months ago. I got Power 90 to work my way back up to the level of fitness that I had lost. My main focus on fitness when I was in my baseball years was always weight lifting and light cardio. When I did yoga for the first time during power 90 I got hooked. Tony Horton claims that yoga is the fountain of youth and I believe this to be true. The benefits from doing yoga are just amazing for my overall workout results. After around the 20th day of P90 I felt like I plateaued and I had to do some research to find Ho' Ala ke Kino. I can't believe this great workout isn't as known in the fitness world. When I did research on this product I found very little on what this workout contains other than the three previous reviews on Amazon (which are great by the way) and thought I'd give my review to help out too.

First off, I'll pop in Ho' Ala ke Kino when I feel like I need more on my workout days and sometimes on my off days when I'm really feeling good. I recommend whoever does this to listen to your body. That said, on to the review.

The workout is just Tony on a beach in Kauai, Hawaii with soothing sounds and the sounds of the waves. This is like being there which makes the workout much more special especially since I love Hawaii.

Ho' Ala ke Kino starts out with simple stretching then goes into light yoga. If you have only done power 90 then you will learn of some new stretching like shoulder and back stretches. Tony will raise his hands to the sky as high as he can during this light yoga then do his chest stretches. He also does hamstring stretches from these sun salutation type moves. This is done with each leg in front of the other for more concentrated stretching. After this he goes to downward/upward dog and bends his knees as one by one to give extra stretching to the calves. He then gets into almost a runners stretch position but his back knee is on the ground-this is great for stretching the quads.

The workout then goes into almost a cardio workout when Tony starts his squat kicks. Imagine your legs are spread out wide and you are squatting. Then imagine you are kicking in the opposite direction of each leg. Tony has you do this 20 times for each leg. This can be tough. After squat kicks there are squat punches. It's the same concept with kicking here. Squat breathing comes next. Here he has you stay in a squat stance as you breathe in and out as your arms come in and out. It sounds simple but since you're in the squat position still this also can be tough.

After these moves the sweating comes and it comes in a big way. Tony has you do Power Yoga for nearly 9 of the last ten minutes, FAST!!! Every time I do this I sweat more than my most committed cardio workout days. This is great for me by the way. He does the regular downward/upward dog moves throughout this stage but brings more to the table compared to Power 90. Tony has you do actual pushups during each of these power yoga moves. The regular power 90 yoga is done within this and then he does four rounds of extra yoga moves that are new and different. He will take you to the warrior one and two moves then straighten your legs and have your arms (warrior two pose) in a vertical position rather than horizontal from power 90. This stretches the back. The last power yoga round skips the warrior two pose and goes right into the vertical arm position for each side.

Finally Tony has you stretch out your legs from the ground (touching your toes) which can also give a good stretch to the back. The workout ends with Tony in an Indian style pose with relaxed concentrated breathing with a straight back. This is also yoga and it can be very rewarding after the total workout.

I always feel energized after I complete this workout and it is an unbelievable feeling.
It will give you stamina, strength, flexibility, energy, and a peace of mind that you won't get from taking any pill. It's easy to see why this is my favorite workout by far. Sorry if this review got wordy but I just wanted to help people out if they are interested in this workout-a definite five star rating.",1280707200,36,4228,4.2775
2420906,5,B000BK670Q,"Due to an arm surgery there are some moves I cannot make (downward facing dog), but this video provides
an excellent stretch before you begin your day or to help you wind down. Tony Horton is always encouraging.
Would recommend to others.",1256342400,3,238,4.690476190476191
2420907,4,B000BK670Q,"I like this work out and do it when I am not up to doing a P90X routine that are extreme or when I want to effect my whole body but don't have a lot of time. It is set in Hawaii on beautiful beach the workout has everything you need to effect both legs and upper body for both flexibility and strength. It is leg concentrated with horse stances squat kicks but the power Yoga portion does effect upper back chest and arms especially if you do the push ups between plank and down dog.
  It is fast moving and sure to make you break a sweat and breath. Tony also stretches you out and cools you down. Its a nice solid work and you won't feel cheated if you do it. Hope this helps. JB",1223856000,14,681,3.9635036496350367

8087683,5,B000BK670Q,"I've done P90X, and P90X3 and enjoy this in addition/as a supplement to those for a couple of reasons. First, it's a way to mix things up after you've been doing Yoga X for over a month. It's going to be easier and MUCH shorter, but the speed routine at the end will confuse your muscles a bit. Mostly though I use this when I haven't worked out in a while as a way to start getting my muscles stretched and strengthened before diving into one of the full routines. I've been doing P90X since I was 27, but now at 35 my body can't just jump right in without taking a week or two to re-acclimate. My wife also really enjoys this workout. It's great for any time of the day, and honestly if I haven't exercised in a while and get low on the squats it's a decent workout. The speed Yoga will surprise you the first time. Other times when I've been in great shape after completely finishing P90X this is more of a nice warm up for days that I don't have time for a full hour workout, or a great supplement if I'm going to play ball.",1522713600,,1028,4.094059405940594

8087685,5,B000BK670Q,"I didn't know what to think when I ordered this. A friend lent me his P90X yoga DVD and I like it - a lot.  So why not try a Tony Horton yoga DVD that's not 90 minutes long.  WELL....... I did this and did I get a workout!  The first 12 minutes it's stretching, breathing and asanas to lead up to the last 14 minutes of a quick power yoga sequence.  I was winded, struggling to keep up and felt the effects of a fast paced yoga endurance workout.  I LOVE this DVD!  I don't do it all the time, but if you want a quick 26-27 minute workout that will leave you sweaty and feeling accomplished - this is it!",1456704000,3,604,3.9098360655737703

I put this in my work out rotation as ""whole body"" work out.  Tony Horton ALWAYS delivers and he certainly did not disappoint on this one.  It's only a half hour long.  If you care about yourself, add this one to your work out dvds.  Highly recommend.",1399766400,,401,4.324324324324325
8087690,4,B000BK670Q,This is an OK video. I was hoping for more yoga. I think this is a nice stretch dvd - good to start your day or finish your workout. Is it a workout on its own - no. Tony is a great instructor.,1384905600,,193,3.511627906976744
8087691,2,B000BK670Q,"I purchased this because I enjoyed the yoga sequence in the Power 90 DVDS and thought that it would be awesome to have an entire video of Tony Horton doing yoga.  However, it is pretty much the exact same sequence.  It is not challenging enough to be considered a work out on it's own...I believe a previous reviewer said that this was a good work out and I absolutely disagree...Keeping in mind that I am about 60 days into Power 90 :)  It would be a good purchase for someone who wants a way to greet the day with a warm up and is not currently doing Power 90 or something similar.  Honestly, I felt a little jipped.  Too bad because I love Tony Horton's style and motivating techniques.",1378684800,3,689,4.310077519379845
