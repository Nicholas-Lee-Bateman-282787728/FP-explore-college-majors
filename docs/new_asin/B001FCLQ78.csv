8301917,5,B001FCLQ78,"I think this documentary should be required viewing for all political science students. It takes the disguises off what is presumed to be democracy and reveals the seamy underside of politics.  Very little has changed in terms of our diligence to make sure our elections are fairly counted and recorded.  Obviously, if the vote is counted in secrecy and in 95% of the cases never audited or verified in any way, there's really no meaning to a democracy. The frustrating thing about it is that so few people are even aware of this documentary or of events described and the significance of this whole story.  This leads me to an even more chilling and frustrating realization: that the media in the US are so inept that they can't follow the trail revealed and make more people aware of it. I think probably, like me, many just think it's too unbelievable and that it couldn't be true, despite the real people involved and the facts given.  And yet the names, dates, events are clearly identified and it would take only a little diligence for a competent reporter and researcher to look under a few rocks and come up with a really meaningful story or series of stories about the loss of democracy in FL and in the country.",1421366400,,1221,4.612903225806452

8301919,5,B001FCLQ78,"Investigative Journalism done to perfection and kept 100% true - AND with all the power of any of Alfred Hitchcock's best works of fiction.  I kept saying to myself, why hasn't this EXPLODED all over the media, since its 2008 release?  Sheer brilliance, (and it DID win the New Jersey Film Festival Best Documentary award); this is truly, absurdly, great stuff.  Makes one want to take Florida Republican Representative to Congress Tom Feeney right up from his Congressional seat and throw him directly into a Florida (and subsequently Federal) JAIL cell - for the rest of his life!  George Bush is just covered with silly smiles - like a Hitlerian demon; but he is revealed as the WORST destroyer of democracy in the living, breathing, world!",1391644800,,743,4.873015873015873
8301920,5,B001FCLQ78,"After watching this excellent documentary, which cleverly unfolds like a  mystery novel, I wondered if Ms. Sharaf (director) had ever been challenged by the Bush administration to keep it hush-hush.  They don't like this kind of exposure.  I'm thrilled she had the guts to put it on film.  You can see how nervous Clint Curtis is during his interviews.  It's no wonder the truth about the murder has never come out of the closet.  Just as it's no wonder they had to rig the voting system to get Bush into office.  Our government has been so corrupt for too long!  Watch this movie!",1229385600,8,581,4.572815533980583
8301921,5,B001FCLQ78,"Clint Curtis , Brad Freidman and Patty Scharaf are national heros to whom we owe a debit of gratitude. Clint and Brad worked for the last 8 yrs to make the national media admit and bring attention to the fact that vote rigging software stole America and our democracy. Ms Sharaf's daring and courageous documentary reveals the truth of what happened to our country. Clint, Brad and Ms Sharaf's  determination and dedication to get the truth out worked. This election cycle, Lou Dobbs among many other radio and TV hosts, discussed the dangers of electronic voting machines and the possibility that the election could be stolen once again. With so many people paying attention, the 2008 Presidential election was the fairest election in over 8 years. Congratulations to all three heros who helped to return our democracy.

8301922,5,B001FCLQ78,"This highly recommended documentary is a riveting yet detailed account of how voting fraud hijacked democracy.  Watching it, we were slackjawed in disbelief, but the journalism carefully, transparently, and thoroughly built an unshirkable and undeniable case.  This documentary is so well crafted by its filmmakers, it is able to deliver on its promise to tell a story of Murder, Spies, and Voting Lies.  Bravo! A tour de force!
