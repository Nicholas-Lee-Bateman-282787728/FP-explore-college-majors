3540844,5,B001DWNUI8,"I saw the PBS broadcast and I do agree that it was an awkward performance in some parts of the set, but the band hadn't played in quiet some time so it seems that they're low on stamina. Still, a good performance especially from Roger and John (who is really OUTSTANDING). The extra Coliseum concert footage from December 1970 is what interests me. Hopefully, they sharpened it up a bit as some of the footage I've seen is pretty dark and grainy. The band is explosive and Keith Moon is playing with the power that made him legendary. His performance on Happy Jack is MINDBLOWING! Can't wait!",1224979200,2,592,4.542056074766355
3540845,5,B001DWNUI8,"Hey Zebba 9, what film were YOU watching??  The opener Can't Explain is kind of a warmup, after which Townshend is absolutely ferocious on guitar.  And as animated & glassy-eyedly immersed as at any time in his career--this is definitely the Pete that would've kicked Abbey Hoffman off the stage again had he showed up.  This performance demonstrates everything that makes the Who great~ these guys hadn't performed in a year, and they find spaces that hearken back to Leeds & Isle of Wight.  Moon may look a little bloated, but he's in tremendous form musically.  They all are, individually and as the collective organism that was the 'Orrible 'Oo.

Perhaps I'm making too much of it, but this performance is a revelation, in my opinion.  At a time when they're supposed to have been a spent force, they reclaim and amply display their power here; they turn in a vintage performance for the lucky audience.  There is a moment during Who Are You (which gave me chills when they went into it~ WHO KNEW?) where the communication breaks down (honestly, I think Pete aborts too early)....but they recover in spades with Won't Get Fooled Again (watch the roadies banging their heads) and the only reason for the breakdown in the first place was the willingness & confidence to take the chance and journey into open-ended territory.....just like they were doing in '70 during My Generation.  Great My Generation here, too, by the way.

I agree about the camera angles, but not to the point of it being relevant to the basic thrill of this film.  (Maybe they could release a you-control-the-angles version someday, like you can do for Baba O'Riley & Won't Get Fooled Again on the Kids Are Alright dvd).

I'd recommend this to any Who fan without another thought.  I only wonder how this stayed hidden for so long.",1221696000,54,1806,4.75
3540846,2,B001DWNUI8,I found the video jarring. The camera pans or zooms wildly and scenes cut rapidly. You don't get a chance to register the image before the angle changes.,1221436800,10,153,4.5
3540847,5,B001DWNUI8,"This show is extremely well filmed. The performance is rough and raw but OUTSTANDING!!!!I am glad The Who unleashed this GEM from the vaults!!

3540848,2,B001DWNUI8,"First off, this based entirely on the PBS broadcast and on issues/reissues of Live at Leeds and the Isle of Wight show. Unless this was a crippled version sent out to PBS, Pete's guitar sound drops out after four songs and this becomes The John Entwistle Band with Pete playing at about 10 watts to the band's 100.  The sound IS that bad, at least on Sept. 10, 2008. Visually the movie is stunning, though it looks like 16mm blown up to 35mm.

Also in this batch is a 1969 live show (but still not Woodstock) which I'll have to imagine at this point based on MCA/Townshend's past releases. The initial release will be just as I described with the dropped out guitar sound. The 1969 show is a BW silent movie with commentary. The rerelease will come in two years with restored guitar for Kilburn and a recently found color, but still silent 1969 show. The third release will come five years from now with Kilburn outtakes, complete sound to the 1969 show (which may or may not be in color at this point) but all the 'Tommy' era songs will be grouped together at the end impossibly after the band smashed up their gear earlier on the DVD. I may be wrong, but like I said this is based on prior releases and why bother changing the formula??",1221091200,12,1238,4.378260869565217
3540849,5,B001DWNUI8,"We Who fans finally get to see the infamous Kilburn 1977 gig here. I've seen the Kilburn footage (minus ""Dreaming from the Waist""), and it's really good. It's wonderful to see a pre-LP version of ""Who Are You"" at this show, that bumps and grinds much more than the studio version would almost a year later. Drummer Keith Moon is in fiery form here - much more than he was at Shepperton Studios (for ""The Kids Are Alright"" movie) some five months later. I think Pete Townshend and John Entwistle might have sounded a little better at Shepperton, but Moon is in better form here on the Kilburn disc. He hits the drums harder, faster and is more precise. Don't get me wrong - I will take any Who footage, especially with Moon and The Ox. Be sure and watch what happens, at the tail end of ""My Wife,"" when someone touches Townshend's guitar picks on Townshend's amp head. YIkes. Don't mess with the Godfather of punk rock, for sure. The camera stays on Townshend, who lets it be known to the guy - and the entire audience - that it's uncool to mess with The Who's stage equipment.
The ragged nature of the band here, most of the time, actually works for them during the Kilburn set. There's an edge to the quartet's efforts, and although there are flubs - Moon comes in too early during the intro of ""Won't Get Fooled Again,"" and Townshend doesn't get all of his mojo on guitar until about 10 minutes into the show. Townshend is wilder here, jumping across the stage, bouncing, hitting his head on his Les Paul and becoming a human cyclone, wrapping himself up in his own guitar cord, than he was at Shepperton. Like the Shepperton footage, the Kilburn set is a keeper.
Hopefully, the London Coliseum set will be equally as impressive ...",1221091200,58,1734,4.4905063291139244

3540952,2,B001DWNUI8,"I love the Who and own 3 other DVD's. This is the only one I DON""T LIKE and will likely never watch again. Here's why:

1) While the 1977 Concert is well filmed and has good quality sound, the band's performance is well below their prime.

2) While the 1969 performance is great, and the onstage banter between Pete and Keith is very funny as well, the lighting and sound quality are terrible.

Many Who fans have given this a better rating than I. The completist fan wants everything the Who puts out. The collector likes it because it has one of Keith's last concerts and also the first (almost) complete performance of Tommy. Admittedly, both concerts have great song lists. However, for me, the above mentioned issues will prevent me from wanting to see these again... I will watch the other Who DVD's I have.

Finally, I'd recommend this DVD to Who fans if it was much cheaper. I paid $20 at Wal-Mart and wish I never bought it. The Blu-ray is now cheaper than the DVD on Amazon, so if you do buy it I'd suggest going with that.",1457740800,2,1033,4.392670157068062

3540954,5,B001DWNUI8,"Great performance by The Who. On the main concert, sound quality is excellent while the video (shot on film most likely) is a little grainy due to light conditions. But it is from 1977 and Keith Moon is there so that's minor. No 4K cameras back then. The other performance from 1969 is very grainy with just OK sound.

3540962,5,B001DWNUI8,"I'm not really sure why the director of The Kids Are Alright didn't want to use the versions of ""Baba O'Riley"" and ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" in his documentary, but he was wrong about this show.  Many (including some of the band members) have been wrong about this show.  Although it had been a year or so since they played live together, they were on top form and definitely delivered the goods.  Okay, ""I'm Free"" got messed up a little bit, but hey, that's rock and roll, and every other performance rocks (especially ""Baba,"" ""WGFA,"" ""Substitute,"" ""My Generation/JT/Who Are You,"" ""Summertime Blues,"" ""Behind Blue Eyes,"" ""I Can't Explain,"" ""Shakin' All Over,"" ""My Wife,"" and ""Dreaming From The Waist."")  The cameras captured the four of them extremely well and the sound is fantastic.  Great concert and among their best in my opinion.  The London Coliseum show is even better in some respects since they were at their first peak live at that time.  Too many highlights to mention but I will say that it contains the best live versions of Pinball Wizard, My Generation, We're Not Gonna Take It, I'm Free, Happy Jack, etc.  Shots are a bit far away and Roger gets most of the close ups but you can still clearly see the band rocking out on their instruments and proving why they are the best live rock and roll band ever.  This is by far the best Who DVD out there in my opinion.  You get two brilliant shows with the classic Who lineup.  By far, my favorite Who DVD and one of my favorite DVDs altogether.",1447632000,,1505,4.557620817843866

3540964,5,B001DWNUI8,"First off, for Keith Moon to be dead shortly after this concert is unreal. He looks and plays like he's in pretty good shape here. And The Who are at one of their peeks here. With the new Punk Rockers coming in now in 1977 and calling bands like The Who ""old and washed up"", none of those bands could ever write and play as great and with as much energy as The Who, even here at Kilburn, at the END of their greatest era. And the 1969 London show is the band at their absolute peak. No band could touch The Who live...while Keith Moon was living.  Get this DVD and thank God this stuff was recorded.",1440979200,2,599,4.076271186440678

3540998,5,B001DWNUI8,"Get the blu-ray! It's 20 now and the dvds are 18, and the BD is of course crisper and with better sound , and you get everything on one disc. I've seen both the dvds and BD, and for only two bucks more the blu-ray is a no-brainer for a set of shows as splendid as this.

I really like a number of the Kilburn songs, but it's the Coliseum show that makes this a must. They were at their absolute peak that night, and even the mediocre sound (but not terrible at all, especially if you're used to bootlegs and hearing the music first and sound second) doesn't detract at all. I also like the minimal camera movement and shots; I just want to see all the band at once to see how they interact. I hate today's constant cutting every half second. This is how I like to watch a group: working as a group.

Kilburn might have annoyed Pete at the time, but it holds up well, especially Fooled and Baba, and I really like this version of My Wife. The jam into the unrecorded Who's Next is another highlight; Pete's got a major buzz on and is just having fun at that point. The footage looks very very crisp indeed in blu-ray, and the sound is good. Keith is starting to fade, we can see that, but he's still pumping out the rhythm and good humor, and his love-hate with Pete is on display for all to see. Clearly much more love than hate.

Daltrey is as much an Ox as the Ox, I think, dependable and solid. But it's Townshend who is the real highlight in all of this. He is without doubt the most entertaining guitarist to watch of them all, including Jimi, I think. Maybe Eddie during the classic VH days was this much fun to see (check the VH live vids on yootoob from '78-82 or so), but Pete had that raging bull aspect that really lent his performances an air of danger and edge. He seemed to be falling over much of the time but was very in control while out of control, and his groove is unmistakeable as he careens around the stage, windmilling and doing knee-slides and jumping three feet in the air as he crushed those power chords (or ""crash chords"" as Roger calls them).

And of course, to get the full experience, turn this up to 11. They were the loudest band ever, after all.
Volume is a big part of their visceral impact. This is their power fully unleashed, and designed to overwhelm.

The Coliseum show is just Who paradise, to me. I have many Oo bootlegs and this is as good as the best of them, with video added. So crisp, and Moon is in tip top shape here. He and Pete are so tight it's crazy, and you can see why John was called the Ox. A more reliably crushing bassist I have not yet heard. Plus the Tommy material was so fresh and clean at this point; they were riding a juggernaut in every way and they knew it. Pete's comments to the crowd also show why they were so special: no typical rock star buttkissery here, simply a serious rock fan whose goal was to be part of their celebration of music and exuberance, not a rock star.

This is THE video for serious Who fans, I think, even more so than The Kids, simply because of the Coliseum show. That's one of rock's best bands on one of their best nights (Pete himself has said so many times, and he might know), and it's a joy to finally have it in decent quality.

Can't say enough about how great this is. No Who fan, perhaps even no rock fan, should be without it.",1414713600,,3334,4.183800623052959

3541015,4,B001DWNUI8,"The live at Kilburn concert has lots of flaws,musical ""train wrecks"" and embrassing moments. The band was out of practice and Keith was no longer at the height of his powers. But.....it's the last concert he did with the band and if you're a Who fan as I am ,this alone makes it essential. (He did play 8 months later at Shepperton Studios for a couple of songs which were used in Jeff Stein's ""The Kids Are Alright"")--what makes it more essential is when you buy the Blu Ray version of this you get over 2 hours of  The Who at the London Coliseum from 1969 . Incredible performance only hampered by the video recording itself. The notes on the DVD are quite misleading but to our advantage. It states that the whole dvd is  about 138 minutes. It's actually closer to about 180 minutes or more. This is because there are two places from the menu that you can start the London Coliseum show. One starts with the song ""A Quick One"" then proceeds through Tommy. The other one starts with ""Heaven and Hell"" and continues for another hour or more. The two segments have 4 (or 5?) songs that are duplicates on each section but all the other songs are material that is not duplicated on both sections. I am not doing a good job explaining this but suffice it to say that there is over 3 hours of material here and not 138 minutes. As I write this review I am reading Pete Townsend's book ""Who I Am""--interesting read as well-----the only reason I don't give this 5 stars is the far from top notch performance at Kilburn but 4 for sure--If you are a Who fan you must buy this--",1395705600,8,1569,4.333333333333333

3541041,5,B001DWNUI8,"Kilburn is a very loose Who show. The band clearly knew the whole show, put on for an invited audience, would not be shown in its entirety in The Kids Are Alright. If you've seen The Kids Are Alright with audio commentary, you know that this performance was done against the wishes of the band and they don't come across as a happy bunch of guys during the show. They weren't a tight musical unit a year removed from touring. Stein insisted on new Who performances to go with the footage from their past. As it turns out, none of this concert footage was used in the movie (only footage from this show that appears in 'Kids' is during the end credits with the pissed band walking to their dressing room backstage and slamming the door in the cameraman's face after the show.

Thanks to DVDs and the demand, the release of this show makes sense today. Roger warns everyone at the outset that they may not be the tightest live act for this show because they hadn't rehearsed most of the songs in a full year. The band nearly falls apart completely on ""Dreaming From the Waist"" and during ""Pinball Wizard"". Daltrey tells the audience after ""Tommy's Holiday Camp"" and 'here it is again in the correct key!.

The music, despite some flaws is great and while you will hear all of these songs played live (and better) on other Who DVDs, you won't find any with picture quality as good as this Kilburn show. It was shot in 35 mm with six cameras. This more than makes up for the flaws which more or less puts The Who on par with your standard , then contemporary punk band only much more talented with the exception of maybe Wire, The Clash or The Jam.

The bonus disc is a bit of a shocker because it's so extensive . 70 minutes of an unreleased live show in London in 1969. This is included as a bonus! The picture quality isn't great on some songs but there's more than enough material here to make up for that. I'm guessing Townshend and Daltrey felt the Kilburn concert was too sloppy to stand up on its own for a DVD release. What you end up with is an extensive library of Who in concert in a single release.

3541044,4,B001DWNUI8,"This is a really interesting Who performance. Even though Pete Townshend makes it clear that he thought the performances were awful, I think he was being a little too hard on himself and the band. It was a rough show, but it's much better than Pete says. Roger even apologizes before it starts, saying they hadn't played the songs in about a year. The concert was filmed by director Jeff Stein for possible inclusion in the film ""The Kids Are Alright"". Stein wanted some new live footage in order to include ""Who's Next"" era performances in the film. The only song they used from Kilburn was ""My Wife"", which was included on the soundtrack album for ""The Kids Are Alright"". A second concert filmed by Jeff Stein, not included in this release, took place at Shepperton Film Studios with a small audience. Unfortunately they missed an opportunity to include that performance here. ""Baba O'Riley"" and ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" from Shepperton made the cut for ""The Kids Are Alright"".

Also included in this DVD is a show from the London Coliseum in 1969. The sound quality of the Kilburn show is quite good, but the London show is a bit worse. ""Young Man Blues"" from this appears in ""The Kids Are Alright"" as well. The London show is a good one, despite its' sound quality. It is a bonus, however. The main attraction here is the Kilburn show. And one interesting feature of Kilburn is a rough ad-libbed version of ""Who Are You"" (part of the ""My Generation"" Medley). This is the only official release of a live concert performance of ""Who Are You"" with Keith Moon on drums. For that reason alone you can justify getting this DVD.",1371254400,,1625,4.622837370242214

3541048,5,B001DWNUI8,"I received the DVD today and watched it right away. Here's what anyone needs to know. First, there's a reason that Townshend wasn't happy with the Kilburn show: it's messy, awkward, at times confused, and above all, Keith Moon is a sad sight for anyone who's watched and loved the 1970 Isle of Wight show or Tanglewood. That being said, this performance has tons of energy and moments of brilliance (Shakin' All Over, My Generation, Behind Blue Eyes), and it's simply great to see the boys rock out, messiness and all!

Now for the real reason to get this DVD: the 1969 show at the London Coliseum! Yes, the picture quality isn't the greatest, and the sound is only a little better. But damn! This is The Who! Moon pounding away at the skins, Townsend unbelievable on the guitar, Daltrey in peak mic-swinging form, and the Ox as stoic as ever on bass. This show is the real reason to make the purchase. I agree with the person who said this is Townshend's best performance, although I know many would differ. All I can say is watch the 15 minute My Generation that turns into an extended groove session and medley and you will believe! Power.... and volume...! Also, I like the front angle perspective of this show rather than the side angle of the 1970 Isle of Wight show, even though the picture quality of the 1970 show is far-and I mean far!-better. For anyone new to The Who, this DVD together with The Kids are Alright are the best intros to the greatest Rock band of all time!",1357257600,,1483,4.492592592592593
3541069,4,B001DWNUI8,"OK, The Who - or maybe just Monnie - is in decline by the time the Kilburn show (recorded for the TKAA film)is performed in '77. Townshend (is he coked up here?) and Moonie are mugging it up for the camera and Daltrey just butchers the lyrics on Dreaming from The Waist. At one point, Townshend suggests that the Fing cameras be turned off.  The OX is the OX and a virtuoso indeed.  This is not a bad show; it's still the Who after all. Their playlist is a nice cross-section of their best work. Clearly they hadn't played together for a while and Moon doesn't play very well.  Three stars.  I strongly recommend watching the '69 show at the Coloseum.  This is much superior to the Kilburn performance and shows the Who as they are entering their creative peek.  A much more subdued Townshend plays very well here and there is nothing contrived about his showmanship.  This is the Who ... Greatest rock-band ever.  Five stars",1354492800,,925,4.497005988023952

3541112,4,B001DWNUI8,"Roger Daltrey once described The Who's 1977 Kilburn show as, and I quote, ""...an abortion."" I recently used that term to describe a bad movie I did a review on, but I nicked the term from him in his comments about this show. It's too bad, fans waited decades on this, but sometimes when a performer refuses to release something, products like this are the reason. It was a swansong from the original line-up of the band, and here they just fizzled.

Though the band clearly wasn't ready for this show, this release does have its good side. The film stock itself is very good, with full, clear sound, dynamic color (or ""colour,"" as the Brits say), and for once, John Entwistle gets equal face time. So many photos and film clips of The Who don't feature him at all, and just like Keith Moon, the band is a lesser entity without him; it's good to SEE him as one of the featured players, as well as hearing him.

But the performance suffers from the four members not even saying ""hello"" to one another in many, many months, then trying to pull this off. Though John Entwistle's bass playing is always technically superb, even he made a few blunders in this show, mostly in a song's structure, jumping to a wrong part and whatnot, but his mistakes aren't as pervasive as the rest. Roger Daltry often forgets lyrics, singing the wrong ones, and on ""Dreaming From The Waist"" (Townshend's most hated Who song), just blanks out while the rest continue without him until he finds his place. Keith Moon, the poster child for hyperactivity and Attention Deficit, let his health dive-bomb right into the ground while living in California, but somehow manages to get through the show (but doesn't have as rough a time as he did in the Shepperton show from 1978); he is much worse for the wear, compared to earlier shows, and Pete Townshend was in an awful mood, and only wanted to finish and go home.

It's a bad show, especially in comparison with disc Two, their 1969 London Coliseum show. This is a technically bad film, terrible production values, but a good document of The Who at their best. There are many glitches here, but it's a FANTASTIC  show. Kilburn should have been the bonus disc.

This set would be of more interest to the die-hard fan (like myself), but regardless of who you are, the 1969 footage is well-worth watching.",1297814400,9,2326,4.581730769230769
3541113,5,B001DWNUI8,"The concert and recording is AMAZING.  Shot on film, it's Wide Screen which is PERFECT for Blu Ray.  The sound is great, and they've even got bass panned on the left and the guitar on the right... so if you have a preference, just pan over and single them out.  (70's style of mixing).  The WHO puts on one of their best performances ever, GREAT musicianship, but also the goofyness that we all know of The Who.  Townshend goes nuts, jumping all over the place, he's just wild.  Daltrey is wild, and of course Keith Moon who publicly announces that he's ""leaving for 3 1/2 minutes to go O.D., and then I'll be right back"" during ""Blue Eyes"".  I have about 35 Blu Ray Concerts and this one is easily in the top 10, probably top 3 for me, along with Zepllin ""SOng Remains"" and ACDC Live at Donnington.  If you like ROCK music you MUST get this one AND get it in Blu Ray if you can.  Steve",1297555200,2,886,4.195266272189349
3541114,5,B001DWNUI8,"In my opinion, there has never been and probably never will be a Rock and Roll band greater than The Who.  Kilburn is a DVD I'm glad I own because it shows how the band had matured in terms of musicianship and material by the 1977 concert date.  It's true that after a year off the road, the band was ragged and rough in spots, but Pete, Roger, John, and Keith on perhaps even their worst of days could still blow away any other band on its best.

Still, what saddens me a bit about The Who throughout its history is we never truly saw the band hitting solidly on all four cylinders.  At Kilburn, Pete, Roger, and John were in fine stage form.  It's just as evident that Keith's skills and health had diminished in ways I believe hurt the band.  Perhaps I'm greedy, but as great as this band was, it could have been even greater.  I'm reminded of The Who playing ""I Can't Explain"" in the documentary The Kids Are Alright.  Every time I watch that performance, I'm in awe of Keith's brilliance on the drum kit.  No Rock and Roll drummer was better than Keith up until about '74 or '75.  During the Kilburn show there are glimmers of the old Moonie, but in total his performance is a far cry from what he had been capable of just two or three years earlier.

A great companion DVD to Kilburn is The Who - Live at the Royal Albert Hall.  Zak Starkey is unquestionably the best possible replacement for Moon.  The band at the Royal Albert Hall show is much tighter than what viewers see on the Kilburn DVD.  If just for the sake of comparison, I would recommend both DVDs to anyone who even casually appreciates the amazing work of this, the greatest Rock and Roll band that has ever been.

The Royal Albert Hall DVD is also worth owning because I believe it's one of the final showcases of Pete, Roger, and John playing together before Entwistle's death.  I'm truly sorry to say that without John and with only Pete and Roger billing themselves as The Who, what they have become is merely the best Who tribute band working today.",1295136000,5,2026,4.348404255319149
3541115,5,B001DWNUI8,"The Who at Kilburn was never meant to be released as an entire concert. Jeff Stein had planned to use parts of it
for the documentary ""The Kids Are Alright"". The band comes out very rough at first. Townshend seems a bit disinterested.
He hits a ton of bum chords at the start. Moon is very rusty. Daltrey and Entwistle carry the load till the rest of the band catches up. At mid-point of the show everything seems to click. This is a must have if you are a big Who fan. Also a good way to start an appreciation of this band.

Disk 2 is a 1969 concert at the London Coliseum. The quality is sub-par. The lighting and film quality are dicey at best.
You will need a quality system to get anything out of the audio. But when you realize that this film was found in the trash, you can live with it. The complete ""Tommy"" and ""A Quick One While He's Away"" are the highlights on the extras.
A piece of history which should not be missed.",1288742400,,930,4.138121546961326
3541116,5,B001DWNUI8,"This DVD is really two concerts, despite one of them being dubbed an ""extra"" so we'll split this review in twain:

==KILBURN '77==

Ah, the infamous Kilburn show. I believe a lot of the inaccuracies and inconsistencies in this show can be attributed to the fact that The Who had been away from the stage for a whole year. Still, anyone who knows The Who will tell you that a ""perfect"" Who show will often include fits of Townshend rage, a flubbed line or two by Roger, and pervasive lunacy care of Keith Moon. If it weren't for John locking the whole thing down as the immobile musical anchor who knows where we'd be today. DO NOT touch Pete's amp. You'll probably lose an eye.

Being off the road for so long The Who are in raw form. It takes a song or two for them to find their stride. Oddly enough, Keith Moon is arguably more on the ball during this show than the rest of the band. It goes to show that he didn't just bash away with no rhyme or reason. He actually was paying close attention to what was happening on stage. Also, he is in considerably better form musically during this show than he was later on at Shepperton. The way he hammers away during ""Substitute"" and ""My Wife"" is classic Keith Moon. His monologue before ""Behind Blue Eyes"" is a bit tough to take considering how little time he actually had left. Just remember to keep Keith happy and let him do his Uncle Ernie bit.

It's the hard-rockers that really stand out during the Kilburn show, those songs that lend themselves to being jammed on with wild abandon. ""My Wife"" rocks hard and ""Summertime Blues"" sounds just as good as it ever did during the ""Live at Leeds"" days. The same goes ""Shakin' All Over"" and ""My Generation"" the latter in particular featuring John going absolutely ballistic on his bass solo as well as what appears to be a Roger-inspired romp through a verse of ""Join Together."" Pete is all over the stage the whole night and shreds quite nicely on just about every song. He does lose his enthusiasm a bit after ""I'm Free"" but seems to regain it quickly. Of special note is the oft-mentioned ""Who Are You"" which is extremely raw and definitely a different animal that what would show up on vinyl a few months later. Also, it's my opinion that the performance of ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" at the Kilburn concert beats the hell out of the Shepperton gig by several degrees.

Kilburn is one of those concerts that I watched through one eye the first time through. I knew what to expect; I knew there were a lot of issues, errors, and tension, but after several viewings I've found how to appreciate it. In terms of The Who as the original four-piece band this is definitely their last great concert. It's really The Who at their roughest which is what a lot of fans crave. The banter with the crowd is fantastic, the band despite the musical snafus seem to be getting on well and having a good time of it and there are some classic one-liners from Keith, my favorite being his revelation to the audience of why they're being recorded as well: ""Somebody says something libelous and we sue 'em!""

==LONDON COLISEUM '69==

For me personally this was the real attraction of the Kilburn DVD. I love this era of The Who so having any sort of visual record is something I'm going to jump on. The concert set list is virtually identical to the legendary ""Live at Leeds"" show minus ""Substitute"" and ""Magic Bus."" The audio quality dips every once in a while especially with respect to Pete's guitar which can sometimes sound like it's being played from a building or two away.

The video is something else entirely. It retains some artifacts and a lot of the shots, especially the wider angles on the whole band, tend to be grainy and poorly lit.  A lot of the time the video is locked in on one angle for minutes at a time. This is explained up-front and on-screen just before the show. The Coliseum was lit for the stage show, not the film crew, so they pretty much had to make do with what was available. Despite that fact, the concert is entirely watchable. I like to think of this show as almost like a professionally released bootleg recording. Keep the lights off and get a good set of headphones. After a drink or two you'll think you're THERE.

The entire performance is high-octane Who. This is due in no small part to getting to see Keith Moon in all his early splendor. He is a wild man. The camera is on him for a good chunk of ""Shakin' All Over"" so get your fill. You get to see him with a better picture on the ""Isle of Wight"" DVD, but only if you want to deal with a truncated version of ""Tommy."" Some of the banter exchanged with Pete during the introduction to ""A Quick One"" is positively Python-esque. Speaking of Pete, he's remarkably less talkative between songs (aside from the aforementioned banter with Keith) and he addresses this near the end of the show where he mentions feeling uncomfortable and awkward performing in the home of the English National Opera. He does make some amusing asides about if The Who took over 7 days a week how performances would be considerably less high-brow, but the seats would be more comfortable.

I find this whole performance fascinating and it would surely make a fine addition to any Who collection. However, given the audio hiccups and the overall picture quality I can see why it was included as part of a larger whole. In today's video market where people are used to bleeding-edge 1080p high definition 3D whatever-the-hell I'm sure a lot of uneducated consumers would get up in arms about the lower quality picture of the Coliseum show. For those of us that know better we can simply enjoy what we have and thank our creator-being of choice that there's anything to see at all.",1286496000,3,5727,4.4865642994241846
3541117,5,B001DWNUI8,"A year off!  As a musician who has participated in a few reunion gigs, there's no landscape filled with more landmines than trying to play a perfect set after you've been out of the saddle for a few months.  And yet here are the Who, an establishment band (much to Pete's horror) trying to maintain their self-respect in front of the cameras and posterity in spite of all the rust of a year's hiatus.  What you get on this video is the Who on a bad night, which is better than 99% of most other band's good nights.  Pete is trying extra hard, in spite of his barely contained rage at being stuck in an anachronism of a band, as punk, techno, and disco are washing away the last vestiges of the 60's. The mix is bass-heavy, which is ok considering how much John Entwistle battled Roger for low man on the totem pole in the Who universe.  However, Pete's guitar is perfectly audible, despite some complaints about the balance of the mix.  The rumors of Keith Moon's decline by this point are exaggerated, although he appears winded at times, as does Pete.  What part of more than a decade's hard living don't you understand?  Keith's playing is exquisite because it is so late in the game for him, and he plays magnificently throughout the concert.  He's not flawless, but I can't imagine any drummer who would dare try to step into his shoes.  The joy of this video is that it shows the glances, grins, and nods between the musicians, sometimes annoyed puzzlement at missed cues (mostly Pete), other times outright laughter that they can bash away for the cameras and not care if they screw up.  They are professional grade, but they're still a bunch of geezers from Shepard's Bush, having a good time.  Look for an early version of ""Who Are You"", the rare ""Dreaming from the Waist"", and spirited and sincere renditions of their earlier glory (a great ""My Generation"").  How this concert sat on the shelf for so long simply indicates Pete's streak of perfectionism and respect for the band and the fans.  If you have not seen this concert in its entirety you are the poorer for it.  Long live the ""orrible 'oo""!",1285891200,,2110,4.530343007915567
3541118,4,B001DWNUI8,"The first disc, a '77 Live at Kilburn show is
really good in my opinion.  Pete definitely
brings his A game, as do his band mates.
Filmed in 35mm, the quality is superb.
The 2nd disc starts with a decent show
whos' set list is listed by Amazon, so I
won't list it here.  Pete's famous jumpin'
jack antics are in full display here.  He held
nothing back, as was the case whenever I
saw him live.
The bonus show (also performed at the
Coliseum in '69) starts off with A Quick
One While He's Away and then they go
into a performance of Tommy (minus
Cousin Kevin and Underture) that is po-
werful.
The 1969 shows are poorly lighted, edited
and filmed, but they are still a powerful
statement, besides those facts, of the Who
as a live act.  Fortunately, the sound is not
too bad.
All in all, these are performances that are to
be treasured for what they are:  a testament
to the live phenomenon the Who were in '69
and '77.",1278374400,,919,4.228571428571429
3541119,4,B001DWNUI8,"As many reviewers have mentioned, the Who were in the process of making a documentary (The Kids are Alright) when this concert was filmed in 1977 to gather material for the film. The show was the Who's first in roughly a year, and it sadly shows; this performance is rehearsal-quality, all the way. While a lesser performance from the Who is still terrific, and there are obviously great cuts on here (""I Can't Explain,"" ""My Wife,"" ""Pinball Wizard""), I can understand director Jeff Stein's decision not to use any of the footage from this concert in The Kids are Alright, save for two small clips (Pete saying ""There's a guitar up here, if any big-mouthed little git wants to come up and f---ing take it off me"" and when all four members of the band meet in the center of the stage after the conclusion of the show).

While the performance has a lot of energy, Roger forgets many lyrics, Keith is often out of sync, Townshend is angry, and Entwistle, while incapable of a bad performance, certainly gives one of his least memorable. When I saw the set list for the DVD, I was immediately surprised that most of this footage was not included in The Kids are Alright, as the performances of ""Baba O'Reilly"" and ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" were, in my opinion, the best parts of that film. When I watched this DVD, I understood why they were omitted; the performances are entertaining enough, and there are a few songs here and there that should have been in the film (""I Can't Explain,"" ""My Wife,"" ""Pinball Wizard,"" ""Summertime Blues,"" and ""Shakin' All Over"" are all decent performances), but the problem is that the band, for the most part, was playing completely out of synch with each other. Whereas the performance from the London Coliseum on the second disc captures the band in peak form (it's similar to Live at Leeds, both in era and in setlist), the performance from Kilburn feels chaotic, out of control, and unrestrainedand not in a good way. This is worth seeing, of course, though mostly as a historical document (it was Keith Moons penultimate concert, after all).

Update (08/30/2017): I still agree with most of what I wrote above all those years ago, except this concert has somehow grown on me in time. I can live without ""Dreaming from the Waist"" and the reshot version of ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" that showed up in The Kids Are Alright, but most of the rest is lovable in spite (and perhaps because of) its imperfections. In many respects The Who were the first punk rock band, so there is an enjoyably anarchic quality to the messiness on display. It's a little too sloppy to be a masterpiece (like Stop Making Sense), but it's better than I initially gave it credit for and seems to grow on repeated viewings.",1274400000,,2726,4.630165289256198
3541130,3,B001DWNUI8,Though overall this is a pretty good show I just couldn't get past the fact that both the video and audio quality very clearly shows the limitations of the technology of the 70's. I believe they did as well as they could trying to remaster this but no need to bother with bluray on this.  A regular DVD (or even VHS) would more than suffice.  On the plus side you do get to see the band at a relatively young age and the energy they brought to their shows back then.  Also Keith Moon was still alive and present in this DVD.  I'm going to try to find a more current Who concert to compliment this one.,1268352000,2,601,4.111111111111111
3541131,4,B001DWNUI8,"I remember seeing the Who in San Diego 1971 when they were playing the ""Who's Next"" tour. Absolutely the most memorable concert I ever went to. They were so loud we actually moved back from the stage, (We were only 20-30 ft from the stage to start), back when they had unassigned seating (standing). Ears rang for days, now that's a concert! Their performance here was a little off for this one but is still a piece of Who history. Some of the band members had drug problems and it showed in their performances on occasions. Too bad Keith couldn't be saved but Pete wasn't as bad and later got things together. This was a very special band that played to the people and the times well. This brings back a lot of lost memories, some good and not so good times. The audio is remarkable for such an old recording as well as the video,(Blu-ray), it's no Jeff Beck Live at Ronnie Scott's but still very decent. Any Who or classic rock fan that doesn't have this isn't a Who or classic rock fan. Play it loud, play it proud!!

I wish Amazon had a 3 Criteria rating that would make for a quicker and more accurate and fair rating of Cd's, DVD's and Blu-ray's.

1. Performance
2. Quality of Audio
3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's)

1.***
2.****
3.****

Bands that wish to have there performances recorded and recognised should be held to a standard. Poor audio, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard audio quality recordings and rank that product highly are not doing the industry or the band justice. Demand better and we will get it, settle for less and that's what you'll get.",1265673600,3,1649,4.486666666666666

3541133,5,B001DWNUI8,"I am fortunate in that I saw The Who LIVE at The Electric Factory in Philly on a Sunday afternoon where we sat on the floor directly in front of Pete. We could hear him screaming orders at the sound man who was on the stage with them and not out in the crowd. I also saw them at the Fillmore East in NYC where they did Tommy. THE WHO AT KILBURN: 1977 is THE Who at THEIR best.

3541134,5,B001DWNUI8,"I have lots of Who videos that I enjoy, but this is the best. They could not have played better than they did in Kilburn. Everything was really right on. Daltrey's voice, Moon's antics and drumming, Townshend's guitar work and gymnastic, and the underrated late, great bassist, John Enwistle. The man played the bass like a lead!
Excellent!",1261872000,,340,4.879310344827586

Looks like, besides Moon, they all have the same outfits on as they wore for Shepperton shows that was on The Kids Are Alright film (Baba and Wont Get Fooled)  Roger forgot words on Dreamin From The Waist which was funny.  Definately Pete is the show.  Shame to see Keith so fat and slow.  Johnny E is definately at his prime here.  Masterful at his craft on bass.

The 69 show on disc 2 is okay.  I guess I have gotten bored with seeing the same songs.  I would rather they release the complete Woodstock performance.",1259798400,,623,4.301724137931035

3541137,3,B001DWNUI8,"I'd highly recommend watching the 2nd disc first. The '69 footage, while really visually bad, shows the band approaching their zenith as a live act. The whole band is having fun and breaking ground performance-wise.

The Kilburn (disc 1) show is interesting for historians/completists -- Pete seems put off about the show right from the start, attacking a roadie on the 2nd or 3rd song and glaring at his band-mates. It ends up good enough, but in my opinion, Pete was in full ""I'm carrying the band"" (real or imagined) mode and tired of doing the same damn songs for the last umpteen years, while the ""big-mouthed little gits"" (aka punk rockers) were challenging his/their throne.

For those who are complaining about the bass -- adjust your subwoofer -- this was not recorded (30-odd yrs ago) for your 5.1 action-hero-smash-car-movie mode system. Also remember that Pete and John actively conspired with their respective amp builders to out-do each other, culminating in the ""loudest concert ever"". In a band with lead guitar, lead bass, lead drums, and lead vocals, there's bound to be an impossible balance day to day, and perhaps the dominant bass was true to form for that show.",1251331200,3,1184,4.915
3541138,5,B001DWNUI8,"For me The Who is second only to Led Zeppelin. This DVD gives me a great dose of The Who from when I first heard them too many years ago. Roger and Pete are Roger and Pete in all the DVD's, but Keith is just so adorable and fascinating to watch and usually there isn't enough drummer footage in concert DVD's. This DVD gives great views and angles and a good amount of time to Keith. I was almost as excited as he was at the point where he re-performs his Uncle Ernie lines from Tommy. John Entwistle is my all time favorite bassist; he plays his bass like it's a guitar! This is a very special DVD. I'm just back to buy my son his own copy for his 19th birthday. The music of The Who just keeps going strong through the g-g-g-generations (sorry that just fell into my lap so couldn't resist!) Hubby and I have watched this many times over and now when I'm cooking instead of putting on a CD I put on the DVD so I can peek to watch at certain songs as well as listen to the music.",1250121600,4,980,4.030769230769231

3541150,4,B001DWNUI8,"The historic impact of this set is huge...on die-hard Who fans like me. Indeed you get the 1977 Kilburn set that was done in preparation for the Kids are Alright. While some argue that this is not the best Who period, the playing is fantastic. It also provides a showcase for their early 70's material that unfortunately has been little documented on film. The film quality is good but rough. Pete is in great form and his guitar playing is the best ever, John Entwistle's bass playing is unusually good. While some think that Keith Moon showed signs of slowing down due to years of abuse, this is not that apparent, except maybe for his horrible suit.
The second DVD which contains a set from 1969 and which is low-quality from a film point of view, is historically even more important. This is the era that most Who fans finds was their strongest, just post-Tommy. The set is the same as on the Who at Leeds album and is close to that of the Isle of Wright DVD. The Isle of Wright is much better filmed but since here you get it in addition to the Kilburn set you can't complain.
Overall the quality is lower from comparable sets but musically the set is incredible. The plying of the band is splendid even if these films weree never meant to be released as such.",1247875200,,1265,4.410256410256411

3541153,5,B001DWNUI8,"One cannot describe how great this band was. Keith Moon was arguably the greatest rock & roll drummer that ever lived. His frantic style and continuous energy has set a standard that few have ever lived up to.
 John Entwistle could easily be described as a ""lead"" bass guitarist. His performance from ""dreaming from the waist"" was awe-inspiring.
It's sad that these two performers have passed away. The sound that the who created with these two will always be influential to any british invasion classic rock enthusiast.
Pete Townsend is a genious.
Roger was and is one of the best frontmen.
Watch both dvd's. I've watched it atleast 20 times already and am always amazed. The live version of tommy in disc 2 extras is far better than the studio album or the movie.
The only downside to this dvd is the poor video quality and looped footage during ""a quick one"".

This DVD is as good as it gets as well. The performances are amazing and the sound and picture quality on the 1st DVD Kilburn 1977 is exceptional.
The 2nd DVD in the set is grainy but it's also a vital DVD to see and have for it's musical quality. The sound is a bit rough but it doesn't interfere with the enjoyment.

3541157,5,B001DWNUI8,"I think that Roger Daltrey (and all of the members of The Who) underestimate themselves in reference to their '77 Kilburn concert.  He starts off by saying that they don't know how the show will turn out because they ""haven't played these songs for about a year"".  Seconds later, Pete Townshend starts in on the first chords of ""I Can't Explain"", and let's just say that that was enough buyer assurance for me.  If this is The Who at thier worst, then I can't imagine them at their best!

  Also included in this 2-DVD set is The Who: Live at the London Coliseum 1969, a show proclaimed by The Who themselves as one of their best.  It really is.  Even though the video is supposedly sub-par,(converted from 16mm film roll, and shot in incorrect lighting) I think it's great, and the audio certainly is, given the fact that it was recorded in an actual opera house.  This concert is from The Who's ""Tommy"" era, so the set list features the entire rock opera, as well as the dynamic set-opener, ""Heaven and Hell"", the top-10 hit, ""I Can't Explain"", their ""mini-opera"", ""A Quick One, While He's Away"", and The Who's ""hymn""(""or her, if you like"", as Townshend jokes), ""My Generation"", just to name a few.
(The full set list can be found on Wikipedia:
<[...]%2B_Live_at_the_Coliseum>).

  An energetic '70s Rock 'N' Roll concert and rock opera in an actual opera house.  These just go to show you that The Who did it before anyone else, louder than anyone else, and better than anyone else. Buy this product.",1238976000,,1503,4.626415094339623
3541158,5,B001DWNUI8,"Awesome - I've wanted to see this performance for many years and finally...

Moon is not as far gone as I'd suspected from the various written reviews I've seen and is still the joint leader of the band along with Townshend.

A bit like watching them rehearse as they chat amongst themeselves at times and all the better for it - a band clearly relaxed with who and what they are/were at the time of the recording.",1238371200,,414,4.363636363636363
3541179,5,B001DWNUI8,"As a long-time Who fan, who's seen this band in performance at the top of their game ('72 San Francisco), I've been very nervous about a live toss-out of the lads. Even 70's bootlegs, showed this band to be under-appreciated in the U.S. This live view is top of the pops in my book as a capture of The Who excitement from the cheap seats. The Kilburn set of '77 represents the packaged deal,with the stage mainly led by Daltrey/Townsend re-created over and over after Moon's absence. The numbers are admirably performed, but, to me just a delicious build-up for the bonus disc,the '69 Coliseum show, which captures their raw and fuller force of the Who vocally and instrumentally unleashed that thrills considerably more. The shortcomings in the grainier 16 mm. footage passes quickly, allowing you to see the frenetic Moon energy in the shadows fueling the Who machine as Townsend thrashes on and Daltrey punctuates with vocal bravado. These two held-back live performances put them ahead of the Beatles and Stones in live performance in the same time-frame because, here, the lads were not forced into the later Daltrey/Townsend (Lennon-McCartney) stereotype to sway the American photogenic media, minimizing Entwistle and Moon. This Coliseum show captures entirely the excitment of a newer, raw force that I felt I experienced in San Francisco when they mesmerized the audience entire, wall to wall, leaving you tingling for days as if from stardust. That night everyone knew a comet shot past. You feel that here in these shows. Feast, ye hearty lads!",1237766400,2,1555,5.007722007722008
3541180,5,B001DWNUI8,"This might be called The Who Live at Kilburn but actually 2 concerts,the main attraction is the relativly short Kilbun(a little over an hour shot on 35 MM) show from 1977,Keith Moon would pass away not too long after that,There are real powerhouse preformances here they play a lot of songs from ""Who's Next"",Pete Townsend loses his temper during the end of John Entwistle's ""My Wife"" knocks an amp down,looks likes someone was messing with his equipment,actually he seems in a pretty bad mood for pretty much the whole show,Daltey and Entwistle are pretty calm an chipper,and Moon was is usual loony self,he is surely missed,there will never be another skinman like him again,all the drummers they used later just were not the same. I think that the late BJ Wilson from Procol Harum,or Soft Machine's Phil Howrard would have been great replacement drummers for Moon(their styles were very similar) instead of Kenny Jones,etc. There are some flubs in the performance but that just adds to the charm,the Kilburn show looks darn good on Blu Ray! Next is a 1969 show at the London Coliseum which is filmed on very grainy 16 MM film,so the visuals are not the greatest,it's the performances that shine here,not to mentiom Mr. Townsend was in a great mood for this show! A great show of late 60's Who! They do perform pretty much a complete A Quick One While He's Away and Tommy on a seperate extra on the Blu,it wasn't all included in the Colisuem video  due to lighting and sound problems,but some highlights are there!

I literally found myself watching and wondering when I'd feel a little adrenaline, but that moment never really came.

But, I have seen this band in concert and the Kilburn show is a disappointent musically.  The band appears off, Townsend is trying too hard, and appears that he is agitated like he is on cocaine.  Moon looks sick.  Townsend even says the performance is poor, comparing it to feces, and recommending they stop filming. I agree with Townsend.  No wonder it didn't get released sooner.  This is an example of a professional band ""going through the motions"" for the cameras on a not very inspiring night.

However, the REAL gem on this disk is the performance at the London Coliseum of Tommy in 1969.  Just compare how much more relaxed Townsend is here, and his guitar play reflects it.  Too bad the sound quality isn't better as it sounds like it is coming from a tin can, but the MUSIC...Wow.  What a gift to be present at that show.",1235260800,13,923,4.408284023668639

I watched this on my Sony 55""... up very close , Harmon Kardon 5.1 etc. blah blah....and I felt like I was there... watching the greatest live band of all time. It was brilliant!

No...its not perfect but its the last time they ever played with Moony and that alone... is worth the price of admission. However what you have here is The Who in all they're glory playing a Greatest Hits package of songs in full maniacle mode.

Daltry, the serious, businesslike frontman belting out the numbers, the last we would see of his full Tommy mane forever.

Townshend, windmilling, scissor kicking, duckwalking, goofballing and often being a complete jerk.

Entwhistle playing his thundering bass like no-one before or after. Looking somewhat bored as always, occasionally smiling , killer outfit, again as usual.

And Moon, in full loon mode, so full of energy and life despite the fact that he was slowly killing himself.

Even if your not a fan, I guarantee that you will know all the songs even if you thought not beforehand. The sound and video are top shelf and the performance is incredible.

3541215,5,B001DWNUI8,"Two years off the road, The Who scheduled this one concert to be chronicled for the film, The Kids Are Alright. The band members deemed the footage unusable and they ""reshot"" the concert in 1978 at the Shepperton Studios, which was the only gig for that year and the last performance by drummer Keith Moon.

At North London's Gaumont State Theatre in Kilburn, the 15-song set again demonstrated the power of the band, even if there was some fine-tuning that (understandably) occurred throughout by each member. At the end of I'm Free - the eighth number - Pete Townshend pointedly told director Jeff Stein that the concert was not worth filming. And there was particular focus on Moon, who did not appear to be in the greatest of health, but performed as well as could be expected after so much time away from the stage.

The event marked the debut of a new song, Who Are You, and the concert - no matter the harsh pronouncements from the foursome - was a kick-off to an incredible period of creativity and popularity, even in the face of professional turmoil that would have derailed many bands.

The bonus concert is from the 1969 Tommy tour - at London's Coliseum - and shot with 16mm film. It is a performance not found preserved in a record company vault, but essentially stumbled upon in the corner of the office of the band's former management company.

This is not the most polished set list that you'll see in a Who concert, but hey, when was rock and roll ever about perfection? The remastering of this gem on the other hand is as close as you can get to perfection, and let's not forget about the load of extras included on this disc.

Daltrey forgets the words to ""Dreaming from the waist"".  Townshend shouts at the audience that both the band suck and Jeff Stein should stop waisting film.  They did not have a set-list and had minimal practice before the concert. While it is nice to see additional footage of the original Who, this clearly is a poor performance.  Purchase the following Who DVD's 1st:  Live at the Isle of Wright (their best concert footage), The Kids are alright, Live at the Royal Albert Hall and Amazing Journey.

This is the Who that people are thinking of when they say the Who were the greatest rock 'n' roll band.  By the time of Kilburn in '77, you can already see them tiring.",1229904000,3,343,3.9420289855072466
3541232,5,B001DWNUI8,"The myth surrounding this performance is that Keith Moon spoiled it by being overweight and out of practice.  The truth is the entire band was rusty.  Roger flubed a few lyrics and Pete overplayed early on.  In short, Keith was no worse then his mates.

So is this a bad performance?  Not by any strech.  It is by turns powerful and dramatic and even a little fun.  It was everything you had ever heard about a Who concert and, as it turned out, it would be the second to last show by the original band.

Having been a fan from 1978 on, I can tell you the band was never the same as captured here and that is not just because of Keith's passing.  What truly underminded the band for the next 20 years was the fact that Pete's heart was no longer in it after 1978.

Compare this show to any Who concert of the late 1970's, 1980's and 1990's and you will see what I mean.  There is no comparison.  By the time Pete rediscovered his passion for his greatest material, John was in a couple of years of his passing and all of them were pushing 60.  Which is, by the way, another way of saying, check out the new Who.  Their current shows are energetic if not youthful.

So this was the last great show by a legendary band.  There is no reason to pass it up.  The 1969 footage is, of course, a fine bonus if you never experienced the Tommy era materials elsewhere.  The band is is top form but the lighting is a bad.  The Isle of Wright footage is bit a cleaner to watch but the band was a little worn out on that night.  Not so at Kilburn.

Even on the DVD case it talks about how Pete thought it was crap and all that, well I put it on and watched it, it was Fantastic, I mean absolutley great.
I have no idea why some critics thought the show was a bust, unless they were speaking of the set adn how it looked on film, thanks to modern technology, the use of zoom-ins and what have you don't make the stage look bare or too big (one complaint I heard).
The concert is only 62 mins long, so its not a long and boring thing for those with A.D.D.
The show was filmed with 6 camera's using 35 film, unheard of for filming a concert, the norm was 16 mm or later straight video.  The forst thing I noticed from that is the show has a theater look to it, just very high quality picture, superb lighting and the 5.1 remix is stunning.
This is the 2nd to last show with Keith Moon, and he still played excellent.  Dont let the critics fool you on this DVD, it is totally awesome.....the version of ""My Wife"" is probably the best you will ever see (or hear).
""Who are you"" is performed, just 2 weeks after they wrapped up recoding it in the studio.

3541237,4,B001DWNUI8,"This is an absolute treat.  Yeah sure the Kilburn gig is full of flubs - like watching the band rehearse - and Moon isn't the powerhouse you'll see on the 2nd discs Coliseum gig, but he isn't nearly as bad as people maintain, plus - watching The Who rehearse is still better than watching even a polished group of wannabes.
The Coliseum gig (from the bands 1969 Tommy tour of Opera Houses) is just great!  Yes, the film is rough in places, missing reels (fitted with stock footage - most notably during the second part of the mini-opera), lighting and sound issues occasionally - but these are small distractions.  Being able to view such a concert from the bands peak live period is a joy.  Moon's perfomance in particular is stunning.

Now I get it, with all the other reviews, it's the original Who so people have to revere them.  I am a die-hard Who fan myself but Entwistle plays sub-par in this concert.  He completely botches ""Tommy's Holiday Camp"" screws up the entire second half of ""i'm Free"" prompting Townsend to look at him and say ""We might as well send the Cameras home,"" and forgets to come in on the verse to ""My Wife,"" Keith Moon is at his most pathetic and un-rehearsed, Townsend looks like a miserable old man, and Daltrey even forgets words and such.  This performance even looks worse because of the 1969 concert on disc 2.  This concert shows the Who at there pinnacle.  Bottom line is, Great visuals/ Horrendous performance.",1228780800,15,867,4.477707006369426
3541249,4,B001DWNUI8,"The 65 minute 1977 Kilburn performance filmed for(but not used in) the movie ""The Kids are Alright"" is well filmed and recorded(35 mm film & 16-track recording), but despite fine performances from Roger Daltrey,John Entwistle & Keith Moon, finds Pete Townshend's guitar playing to be rusty & uninspired. It's no surprise that the guitar is mixed down much of the time.
Of greater interest is the 1969 London Coliseum performance on Disc Two. Despite the rough, imperfect quality of the filming(16mm film & direct to 2-track audio), the group performs a stunning set, comparable in quality to their legendary ""Live at Leeds"" show(and with a similar song line-up). Yes, the 2-camera filming is sometimes blurry & grainy, and their are occasional moments where, for a second, the screen goes white at the end of a film roll. Yes, there are occasional scratches in the film print & negative, but the essence of a great performance is here. You can view a 75 minute edited version(featuring the parts with the best picture quality) or you can view a bonus section with the entire rock opera ""Tommy""(or as much of it as they played that night). The film footage of the supplemental ""Tommy"" section is 99% complete, though there is a 2 minute section(during ""Christmas"" & ""The Acid Queen"") where the audio recording crew lost the sound feed, and so audience-recorded sound is substituted. I just wish that the transition between the full-fidelity audio & the audience-recorded audio could have been done more smoothly.
Still, this two-disc set is priced incredibly low, and it's packed with value. If The Who has more concert films in their archives, I say bring them on!",1228521600,4,1664,4.946428571428571

The Who were not that tight, and although this was what made them interesting sometimes, this show ain't that happening.  Okay in spots, but just average, as unfortunately, they had become for most of the '70's as a live unit.  Arguably though the DVD could have been titled The Coliseum Show and that would be a different matter altogether.  The boys are firing on all cylinders at this show.  Just masters of the stage at this point.  Oddly enough though, the main featured section of The Coliseum show has some songs from ""Tommy"", and then when you go to the extras section of the disc, the entire performance of ""Tommy"" (19 songs) is available???  One possible explanation may be that the relatively one hour performance on the disc may have been considered for a theatrical release at one point and was therefore not going to include all of the ""Tommy"" material??? Not clear.  Also the booklet does not list the songs, and the material on each disc.  You have to go to each disc and gather that information from there.  Poor lighting and all, The Coliseum show gets a 5, and Kilburn gets a 3.",1228348800,7,1177,4.669902912621359
3541252,4,B001DWNUI8,"Kilburn is a good show. But as previously noted it is a little sloppy, and Pete needs to be much further up in the mix. I don't mind sloppy, hey it's rock and roll. But the boys sound a little lethargic. (Especially when compared to the 69 show.) Pete is jumping around and dancing and windmilling like a madman, but the musical energy to back up the antics is just not there for good portions of the show.  Keith is fine, but he does a lot of mugging for the camera, and I think his playing at the 69 show is far superior to Kilburn. I'm sure a lot of fans will disagree, but I am just not as amped up about this show as other reviews.

The Coliseum show from 1969 is another matter. The sound mix is worse than Kilburn but the band sounds better! Pete does less dancing but much more *playing*; there is more technique and more leads -and just awesome jaw dropping moments (sparks, my generation especially fiery).  He is all over the fretboard and his use of feedback and distortion masterful.  Keith, for me, is far better than the Kilburn show. He does less pandering and just plays the hell out of every song. Roger is fine at both shows; but I guess I am just on old fogey - something about him in that fringed vest is Roger, and he seems looser at the Coliseum show. Ox is Ox, beyond great at both shows; was there ever a better bass player?

Tommy, as others mention, is included as bonus material (with A Quick One).  I would have liked it in sequence of the show, but at least it is here. They are both great, but I will always have a special love for Tommy and watching it here shows the power and energy of a live Who show. I mean they just kill it start to finish without a breath or break.

I believe a lot of it is the history. In the late 60's and even early 70's bands like the Who, Zeppelin, Floyd were very vital. By the late 70's they had lost a lot of that vitality. They could still crank out the great studio album at times, but by and large the magic was gone. They had become bloated money machines. Not bad bands by any means; just a shadow of their former selves. By 1977, The Ramones, NY Dolls, and countless others were taking up the charge to do something refreshing, edgy. The two Who shows here demonstrate the difference in 60's rock giants who 10 years later lost an edge or two. They were too aware of who/what they were instead of just being/living it.

Any Who fan is going to buy this and it seems I am in a minority in being lukewarm over the Kilburn show.  I would pay twice the price of this set for the Coliseum show alone, it is that good. Then throw in a good not great performance from 77 and you can't go wrong!  Also highly recommend the isle of wight dvd...",1228003200,9,2706,4.166666666666667
3541253,5,B001DWNUI8,"No long, drawn out reviews from me. If you're a Who fan, then you had better get this disc. Even if you're a peripheral Who fan, get the disc. Having both the 1977 Kilburn and 1969 London shows on one disc is great. I watched both shows start to finish without skipping to the next chapter, not even once! In both shows, they are in absolute top form. I also got a newfound appreciation for  the spectacular drumming of Kieth Moon. The only con is that, at leastduring the Killburn performance, the cameras spent too much time on Pete and Roger and not nearly enough time on The Ox - the greatest rock bassist of all time bar none.

I pity the poor, pale, contrived junk that continues to assault following generations.  As they discover DSOTM, Spirits 12 Dreams, etc. were mostly made by young men in their 20's, created to last forever, for others to use as guide posts.  This performance of the Opera Tommy in the extra area of disc 2 is the gold standard of what rock and roll is/was capable of.  Look past the warts and flubs of the technical presentation and be a witness.  I'm glad that I was alive during this period of time, it helped me, as a modern (young-now older) man living among so much madness, cope.  As near to spiritial/religion as I was ever to find, it kept and keeps me going.  Look, listen and rejoice as this old gem is capable of doing.

3541255,5,B001DWNUI8,"I watched the main section of this DVD last night.  There is still ""the extras"" section that I will view soon.

The concert is awesome!!  I am a huge The Who fan and this concert shows how great these guys were playing together.  There were mistakes such as when Roger Daltrey forgets most of a verse in the song Dreaming From the Waste, and a few songs into the show Pete Townshend comments that he didn't think the performance was worth filming but I think he was saying that to goad the other musicians.  This DVD is a must have for any The Who fan or anyone interested in power rock and roll.

My biggest gripe about the film is the same I have with all of The Who videos that I have seen:  the lack of time the director shows John Entwistle and John's amazing playing.  It seems music film directors that film The Who know nothing about rock music.  Here is arguably the greatest rock bass guitarist to ever walk the face of this Earth who had changed rock music as we know it forever, and you'll be lucky to see 8 minutes of concert footage devoted to John in a 2-hour film.  Sometimes I felt Keith Moon's kick drum got more film time than John did.  For example during the phenomenal bass soloing in Dreaming From the Waste, this idiot director elects to show Townshend standing playing rhythm guitar.

The sound is awesome.  The tone that we hear from all of the musicians is amazing, especially John Entwistle's bass.

Go buy this DVD.  The Who was an amazing band that changed music forever and this concert DVD emphasizes that fact.  Probably your only issue will be your disgust in the lack of time devoted to John Entwistle.  So maybe you won't see much of him in this film but you will certainly hear his amazing playing.  The Who were an awesome live band and here's your chance to see them prove it.",1227657600,4,1815,4.367164179104478
3541256,5,B001DWNUI8,"I've just watched the Kilburn '77 DVD and I haven't been this floored since viewing The Who Maximum Rock And Roll video when it was released about 15 years ago. This DVD is pure magic.

Granted, there are flaws in the Kilburn performance. Townshend's guitar could have been up in the mix a bit more, Moon's drumming definitely shows signs of fatigue, but it's still a fantastic document to the greatest live rock and roll band of all time. There are more than enough moments throughout that will surely send shivers down the spine of any REAL Who fan (for instance, Townshend towards the end of ""My Wife""). It is truly a testament to how a band SHOULD play when lucky enough to be on a stage. With complete and total abandon. Too bad there's not too much of that around these days.

The partial London Coliseum show is equally as brilliant and a wonderful added bonus. I just hope they keep dusting off the goods in the archive and keep the DVDs coming. I'm waiting with baited breath. This DVD was  infinitely better than I ever could have hoped for and I for one cannot wait for the next Who fix. Fantastic!",1227657600,,1109,4.45320197044335

Anyone who's a Who fan should get this, if only to erase the sad image of Moonie as ""past it"" that that Shepperton footage inscribed on our collective consciousness.

3541269,5,B001DWNUI8,"Dave Marsh, in his Who biography, ""Before I Get Old"", referred to this '77 Kilburn gig as ""a disaster"". Jeff Stein, who filmed the show, once called it ""an abortion"".  True, The Who haden't played together in 14 months, Keith Moon was in poor condition, Pete didn't really want to be there, Roger forgot some lyrics and John Entwistle admitted he was drunk before the gig. There are plenty of mistakes made during the course of the show but one thing is certain; The Who Live At Kilburn 1977 is a sloppy, glorious, frantic, energetic mess.  In effect, everything a great Who show should be, and a must-have for any Who fan.
  Moon may have been out of shape but he is positively explosive at times, especially during ""My Wife"" which he almost single-handedly drives to greatness. It's true he comes in too early (3 times!) at the opening of ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" but so what? If you want perfection, go see Rush.  If you want rock'n'roll the way God meant it to be, watch this show.
  Roger forgets the lyrics to ""Dreaming From The Waist"" but is in strong voice. And if John was drunk, well, how would anyone know?  He stands still and plays brilliant bass as always.
  As for Pete, he jumps, kicks, windmills, drops to his knees and generally pulls out every rock-star pose he has to energize the show or possibly himself. At one point he tells the audience, ""There's a guitar here if any of you big-mouth little gits wants to take it from me!"". He also tells Jeff Stein to stop filming and send the camera men home.
  At this point the show really takes flight with an awesome four-song finally of ""Summertime Blues"" (the best I've heard), ""Shakin' All Over"", an extended ""My Generation"" and finally ""Won't Get Fooled Again"". During the ""My Generation"" jam, Pete begins to play ""Who Are You"" which the band had just finished recording.  Keith seems reluctant to follow but goes for it and the whole thing nearly falls apart but remarkably does not.  In fact,the entire show seems on the verge of collapsing but some how these four guys pull it off.
  Apparently the band trashed their dressing-room in frustration afterwards but I think they were being too hard on themselves. From a fans perspective this show represents everything The Who are about. Inspired chaos.
  The bonus disc includes a 1969 London performance that includes most all of ""Tommy"".  The film-stock is poor but the performance is The Who at what I believe to be their peak. The set-list is similar to Live At Leeds.  If you want to see what Keith Moon was really capable of in his heyday, watch this disc.",1227484800,3,2582,4.596069868995633

3541271,5,B001DWNUI8,"A lot of fans will look at this and wonder why Jeff Stein and the band did not include any of these songs in ""The Kids Are Alright"".  My theory is they knew how much better the '75 and '76 shows had been and were disappointed that this performance fell short of their expectations.  The band is a bit rusty; it had been over a year since they'd played live.  After Pete Townshend forgets the break in ""I'm Free"" and ends the song too early, he comments that they're wasting film.  But even with the mistakes (or maybe because of the mistakes), you can't take your eyes off this film.

Highlights for me include ""My Wife"", ""Summertime Blues"", ""My Generation"" and ""Baba O'Riley"".  It's a joy to watch Keith, he looks like he's having the time of his life throughout.

I wish that the London Coliseum show on Disc 2 could be cleaned up better. But unfortunately, it is missing sections of film, and there are places where the audio is not great either.  It's a shame, the band were really tight, they'd been playing live for years at this point.

So how can I give this five stars with all the errors and problems?  I give it five stars because the band decided to release this ""as is"", and we get a front row seat seat watching a band that might just explode at any second.

This is the Who. THE REAL Who. At the beginning of DVD 2, there is a disclaimer about the filming of the original 1969 London Coliseum concert. You're told in advance that it's not going to be ""perfect.""

But it IS.

It's Towshend, windmills flying. It's Moon, arms flailing about in an impossible display of physical stamina and pure rock & roll. It's Entwistle, anchoring it all. It's Daltrey, swinging the mic and driving the band.

I'm sorry...I don't want to talk about anything other than the fact that this is the WHO, the REAL who, delivering classic sets on a 2-DVD set that is ESSENTIAL for even the most casual Who fan.

3541273,4,B001DWNUI8,"A very interesting release---the 1977 Kilburn show that supposedly wasn't good enough to be used in the Kids Are Alright---now gets released in full.  Was it good enough?  Well, it was filmed so Jeff Stein would have some performances of Who's Next era songs non-existant on film:  Baba O'Riley and Won't Get Foolded Again.  The Kids Are Alright versions---filmed at Shepperton--of those two songs are a little better, especially WGFA.  So Jeff made the right decision then to forget the Kilburn show.  30 years later, Who cares? Let's see everything that's still in the vault.

The fascination of this particular show is it's Keith's last proper concert appearance.  Sadly, Keith is a shadow of his former self.  He's only about 30 when this was filmed but looks 10 years older than he did on the 1975 tour--the last great Who performances.

The Kilburn show was the band's only performance of 1977 and it shows.  They are all rusty.  But a few times:  Shakin' All Over, My Wife, Pinball Wizard, the old magic resurfaces.  Townsend is clearly not happy, which results in a passionate performance.  Daltrey forgets some lyrics but is generally in good form.  The Ox is his normal, solid self. Always the best bass player on the planet.

The show is very well filmed.  The sound is not as good as the film quality:  Townsend is recorded well but Entwistle's bass is frustratingly low in the mix.  It's hard to tell how Moon is recorded:  he was not playing up to his normal standards and sometimes he's trying to hit all his drums at once, and not really hitting any of them at all. Other times he can still pull off a great fill or roll.

The London Coliseum show from 1969 is a quality addition and makes this package a great value.  It's only stage lit--not lit for filming proper--but it's the Who at their performance peak.  The sound is a bit muddy but still, any peak Who is a joy.

If you love the Who, you have to have this package.  All Moon era film is a treasure.  If you are a novice Who fan, this is not the first Who DVD to buy.  The Kids Are Alright is the place to start.",1227139200,7,2087,4.4787234042553195
3541274,5,B001DWNUI8,"If you are a Who fan, or want to make a Who fan cry for joy, get this DVD. It's a must-have for any Who freak, second only to ""The Kids Are Alright"" documentary.

Disc 1 is the complete Kilburn 1977 show and disc 2 is the complete London Coliseum 1969 show. I have a huge bootleg collection and would rate both shows as two of the top five Who shows ever (to say nothing of their historic importance).

The 1977 Kilburn show is ""take 1"" of the 1978 Shepperton show (see ""Baba O'Riley"" and ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" on ""The Kids Are Alright""). Both shows were private affairs filmed for the documentary, but except for Moon's shirt, they are almost indistinguishable. If you loved Townshend's and Moon's antics in those clips, this DVD is for you! FYI, this is the show that gave us ""My Wife"" on ""The Kids Are Alright"" soundtrack album.

Even better, guitar-wise, is the London 1969 concert.  This is the show that gave us ""Young Man Blues"" on ""The Kids Are Alright"". This may be Townshend's best performance ever, but I don't want to start that fight here. Finally, why did they break up the London show and move the Tommy section to the Extras menu?  Why not keep the entire show intact as the Lord intended it? It's all on the same disc anyway... I'll tell you why: because otherwise this DVD would be so perfect it would pull the rest of the universe into it and then we'd be totally screwed.",1227139200,170,1394,4.387596899224806
3541275,4,B001DWNUI8,"First up, salute to some of the other reviewers here at Amazon, a few of the featured (as I write this) reviews do a pretty good job of covering this artifact of rock concert history that has finally made it's way to Blu-ray disc.  As noted, the concert performace is coarse in spots since the band hadn't peformed together in a years time.  There are glitches during the performance that quite obviously irritate the band members and remind viewers that what they are seeing was filmed live and includes all of the warts.

What's also included is all of the energy of a Who concert.  Pete Townshend's windmill guitar strumming, Keith Moon's frenetic drum playing (including flinging the drum sticks around and losing them time and again...) -- side note: if someone wanted to put together a drinking game for play while watching this film they'd probably want to include Townshend's windmill strumming and Moon's losing the drumsticks as the requirements to take another swig.  It wouldn't take long at all to find the participants in such a drinking game pretty well inebriated ;-) -- and of course Roger Daltrey's strong lead vocals.  All of which make bassist John Entwistle's performance seem a bit, well, stiff.  No one could blame the guy really, as the rest of his band mate's certainly seemed to have the stage pretty well covered, especially with Townshend's jumping/hopping around the stage repeatedly.

The Who At Kilburn is a fascinating film largely because it even exists on film.  It was filmed on 35mm film which is rather unusual for concert footage.  Thankfully though that medium works well for providing a master for encoding to high def media, and thanks to that the product that viewers get on Blu-ray is, at least at this point technologically, as good as can be achieved on optical disc media.

Note that the Blu-ray disc is NOT RATED.  If it were rated, it would probably have been given an R rating for the utterances of the f-bomb at several points throughout the course of the show.

Most definitely worth viewing, and an item that serious Who fans should add to their collection.",1226966400,15,2109,4.808864265927978
3541276,3,B001DWNUI8,just got the blu-ray on opening day. expect quite a bit a guess but the video has a lot of judder like it running at 12fps not 24. anyone else experiencing this?,1226966400,,161,4.0625
3541277,5,B001DWNUI8,"Wow.

Just watched the Kilburn show at a Marcus Theater in Columbus, OH. The sound is just incredible. I doubt there is another better sounding Who concert in their entire catalog.

The show was originally filmed to be part of The Who documentary, The Kids Are Alright. Shot in December of 1977, this was the first show The Who were to perform in over a year, and turned out to be Keith Moon's 2nd to last performace before his death the following year. Apparently the director of TKAA, Jeff Stein, thought the footage was not up to par, and had the boys play another show in May 1978, that would see two songs (Baba O'Reilly & Won't Get Fooled Again) later appear in the film. Prior to the release of this Kilburn show, only a five second clip of Townshend throwing out a challenge to the crowd, and the audio performance of My Wife, on the TKAA soundtrack were released.

While some of the visuals are not as crisp as I would have liked, probably due to the lighting, most of them are incredible. The camera's were right up in their faces like I have never seen. It's really a ""one of a kind""  style of filming. There are a lot of great Keith Moon close up shots - and he pounded the drums on this night. Keith doesn't look tired, he looks excited to be playing again. Many in close shots of Townshend's guitar playing, and a few good one's of John Entwistle. Little things too, like Townshend's cut up fingers, the set list written on one of Keith's toms, great interaction with the audience.

The set list is standard for them at the time, but has some of the best performances of the staples that I have seen them ever do - Dreaming From the Waist, I Can't Explain, Won't Get Fooled Again, Shakin' All Over, My Generation, Join Together jam, etc.. I only wish they played a few more.

** Worth noting is that this must be the first and last(?) time Keith Moon performed Who Are You live with the band. Nice raw, inspired, early version of the song with Pete working out the chorus and guitar. **

Can't comment on the rest of the DVD release yet, but this performance is worth the money by itself. Can't wait to get blown away over and over again with my surround sound system and screen setup.

The DVD release also includes the London Coliseum show from 1969 - reputed to be one of the band's personal favorites.",1226880000,4,2319,4.376744186046512
3541278,5,B001DWNUI8,"There is nothing greater than being a life long Who fan.  Why?  It's because you know in your heart that you're right, they really were the best band to ever walk the planet.

So now we finally get legitimate DVD releases of the original band...some of which actually goes back to the 1969 glory days.  What do people do then?  Complain of course.  Why?  It's just what the collectors do best.

I would suggest WAITING until the thing is released before complaining about what they didn't get right?  After all, anything involving The Who will NEVER ever be 100% good enough......for the collectors.

Fans though will be overjoyed.  I know I will be.",1226620800,6,650,4.663716814159292
8295142,5,B001DWNUI8,"I loved the whole band in this review. They seemed to be in top shape and Pete and Keith really put on a show. It was a good concert for Keith Moon to end on, but I wish he had stayed alive to do some of his great drumming on other Who releases and concerts. ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" is the best version I've ever seen on a dvd by the Who. Oh they were superb in their day!",1525996800,,373,3.7341772151898733

8295149,4,B001DWNUI8,"All in all good show. Really interesting to see Mooney in his typical rare form.

Riding probably the pinnacle of their popularity, you can actually  SEE the ego in Townshend; the "" I don't give a **** if you like this or not"" swagger. And he's right, you will like it...

Would have liked version of Who Are You to be a bit closer to the studio rendition, but, see previous point.",1504224000,,381,4.263888888888889
