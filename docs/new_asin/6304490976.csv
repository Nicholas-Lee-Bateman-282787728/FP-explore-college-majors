If you are fragile or squeamish about ""proper""  protocol you probably won't like this,  but if you want the cold hard factual, unadulterated truth about how your conscious and subconscious mind communicates and if you want to control your thoughts and actions and reactions, then you could not spend your money more wisely then purchasing this set of vcr tapes.",1386979200,2,512,5.083333333333333
7873231,5,6304490976,"I was at this seminar when Mr. Miller gave it in San Francisco those many years ago...and it changed my whole life. The content is humor filled and speaks directly to you; no matter WHO you are! And Miller is a brilliant speaker who ""grabs you by the side of your head and shakes you up!"" He is truly gifted.
I bought the tapes and workbook the day I left the seminar, not wanting to be without them afterward. I have used them a number of times to ""remind my horse and driver who is boss!"" LOL
Having been recently married, I have introduced my new husband to the tapes. He loves them as much as I do.
6 years and going, I have owned these tapes and benefited from Mr. Miller's words...I would not give them away or get rid of them for anything!
This is a gift for yourself and your family, friends and workmates that is worth every cent and more! You will find yourself in a great place; and others will benefit as well from your new found knowledge. And you will find yourself sharing and growing as a person. UGH! I could go on and on and on.
Trust me; trust yourself and get this set!!!",1049760000,9,1091,4.1753554502369665
