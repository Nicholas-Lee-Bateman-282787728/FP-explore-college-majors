2439572,5,B000BSXYJA,I love this  DVD set and always recdomend it to left-wingers.  The music is also fantastic.  I purchased Live 8 when it first came out and had to buy another copy becaused I watched/showed it so often that it was getting worn.,1379462400,,226,4.333333333333333

2439574,5,B000BSXYJA,"I bought soley for the Pink Floyd set! Everthing else was a bonus! A great dvd set, packed with headlining stars.",1376956800,,113,4.428571428571429
2439575,5,B000BSXYJA,"This is a incredible album. Especially disk 3 with the Pink Floyd reunion!! Turn out the lights, crank up the sound!!!! Robbie Williams is also on this disk. He is very well known in the UK not so much here. Watch him, he is an awesome entertainer! Really connects with the audience. I had never heard of him but truly a fan now!. Some of the other disks are not as well recorded but this was such an accomplishment, all to raise awareness. Buy it, you won't be sorry! I have given so many as gifts plus any time someone sees the Pink Floyd reunion at my house they go out and buy it!!!! I should be on commission!",1376092800,,614,4.168067226890757
2439576,1,B000BSXYJA,"Was looking forward to watching this. But it doesnt work. This dvd displays a ""Region number error"" message on the screen.",1367712000,,122,4.857142857142857
2439577,4,B000BSXYJA,"Firstly, it is really a pretty modest statement to say that this is one of the greatest music DVD sets that you could buy, period. The scope is wide, the scale immense, and most importantly of course it relates to a a serious ethical cause, so it is not *just* great entertainment.

Anyway, the inherent nature of this sort of concert event is that, unless you are incredibly eclectic in taste, there will be some featured artists whom you don't like as much as others. But the variety, in context, is a good thing here. This is *a lot* of music, primarily from London and Philadelphia, but also with performances from Berlin, Paris, Canada, Tokyo, South Africa, and St. Petersburg.

The opening/closing slots are filled with the biggest superstar acts, and while U2, Sting, The Who and Paul McCartney all fit that bill, frankly I found the younger acts to be generally the more interesting. The Killers, Keane and Snow Patrol all really give great performances. I have to say that I enjoy the Black Eyed Peas set as well. Of course, the Pink Floyd reunion was a big deal for Live 8, and that is here, including some background footage/interviews. I find it interesting to contrast Mariah Carey with Madonna. The former seems kind of out of touch, while the latter really lives up to her reputation as a legendary act (thankfully without doing anything objectionable that I recall), with a great band, great arrangements, giving just a great performance period.

I do not give this item 5 stars because of, more than anything I guess, the Will Smith part of the concert. Do we really need 4 or 5 Will Smith songs, with him going off on just about the biggest eye-rolling ego trip that I have ever seen? Also, Coldplay come across as extremely boring. They are one of my favorite bands, but this iteration has some things in common with cardboard. Especially ""Bittersweet Symphony"" which Chris Martin introduces as ""the greatest song ever"" or some such, only to immediately use it to underwhelm. Oh well.

There are some decent segments of bonus footage, and the ""Final Push"" concert (which was recorded some days later in Edinburgh) might be my favorite part of it all. On the whole, if you appreciate a wide variety of music and can rationalize the purchase price, this is definitely worth getting.",1352937600,,2299,4.74
2439578,5,B000BSXYJA,It gives you a taste of all the bands that played at this event. Though as always you would like to see more of some than others,1333756800,,128,3.7777777777777777
2439579,3,B000BSXYJA,"First I want to say that that this product is a solid 3 stars.  The musical performances vary in quality and entertainment. But personally I didn't care for many of the so-called 'artists.'  I bought this solely for Pink Floyd's 5 song set.  The songs that Floyd performs are Speak to Me, Breathe, Money, Wish You Were Here and Comfortably Numb and they do them all flawlessly.  Seeing roger Waters into the music, smiling, singing along and engaging the audience is fantastic.  Seeing all four members smiling to one another and standing together at the end is truly priceless.  To say the least it was and will remain very emotional to any committed fan of Pink Floyd.  However if, like me, you are only getting this to see Floyd then I suggest you simply check out David Gilmour's Youtube channel where he provides the entire performance in HD and FREE OF CHARGE.  So if you only want the five songs from Pink Floyd just skip this DVD and watch it on Youtube.",1325980800,,962,4.5523255813953485
2439580,4,B000BSXYJA,"This is a great DVD.  It some of the best performances from the Live 8 performances.  My only complaint is that people expected great sound quality will not be satisfied.  There are better concert DVDs from each of these artists, but this is a great snapshot of dozens of acts that you may have not heard of.",1323820800,,308,4.368421052631579
2439581,5,B000BSXYJA,"Hey, This video is a great resource for every music collector, a historic moment!!! is a great album about a great day nin music life",1323216000,,133,4.36
2439582,5,B000BSXYJA,"Of of the best Live DVDs of any genre, the collection of artists and music captures a unique mix of superstars and up-and-coming artists.  Having McCartney and U2 play together was amazing.  My appreciation for Coldplay increased 10X after watching them on this DVD.  Some of the newer artists like Keane and Kaiser Chiefs really blew me away and I've since followed many of these bands live too.  There are a few duds as with any huge collection. Much of the Philadelphia show bored me, but almost all of the UK Hyde Park show was amazing.  A great DVD for a music fan or casual fan of these artists. Great DVD to throw in on a Sunday afternoon while doing email or whatnot. Disc 1 is so great, we often show it to guests when we have a dinner party. 4 DVDs. Very good.",1312329600,,770,4.319444444444445
2439583,5,B000BSXYJA,"Bought if for the Pink Floyd set; tremendous.

Great DVD set overall. Music quality is excellent.",1268265600,,97,5.0625
2439584,5,B000BSXYJA,"I finally managed to get my hands on this set yesterday on my birthday. Now I must admit the only parts I have watched so far is the Floyd set from Live 8 on Disc 3 and the Pink Floyd Rehearsal Extra Feture from Disc 4. That however is more than enough to make this dics a required purchase for any Floyd fan. I just got done watching the rehearsal extra and I am so glad that I did. They performed just the four of them ""Wish You Were Here"" and at the end of the song Gilmour/Waters/Mason discussed how the song should end and redid it a couple of times. It is very sad to think that we will never again see the classic lineup play together with the passing of Richard Wright in 2008. I know everyone always talks about David Gilmour and Roger Waters but Richard was also a very integral part of Floyd. Anyways, this show was spectacular and I wish I was there. I only hope that Gilmour and Waters can reconcile and perform again. I'm sure the rest of the DVD is also good. There are a lot of great acts. Looking forward to checking out Muse with ""Time is Running Out"" I have heard that there is an additional DVD that can be purchased that has additional songs from Muse so I moght look for that next. Pretty sure it was a Live 8 Paris DVD. Just looking over the cover and book it appears there is something for everyone and I highly recommend purchasing this set.",1263859200,,1366,4.178030303030303
2439585,4,B000BSXYJA,"With the plethora of acts on the DVD, it's hard to buy this and be disappointed. Almost all genres of modern music are present, with ""pop"" and metal acts conspicuously absent for whatever reason. So whether you like The Who, Dave Matthews Band or Jay-Z, there is something here for you.

My one complaint, as someone who was there, was that the song selection puzzled me. Not only was a significant portion of it presented out of order, but a lot of the bigger names, such as Linkin Park or Neil Youn, who did half-hour or 45-minute sets only have one song included while smaller acts get almost their entire set included, and several venues are woefully underrepresented - either shoved in the back as an ""extra"" or having one or two songs make the cut.

This is a great collection, don't get me wrong. But to really do this concert justice, it needed at least another disc of content.",1245369600,,886,4.53125
2439586,5,B000BSXYJA,"If for no other reason, buy this DVD set while you can. It contains the last time the original members of Pink Floyd played together since the early 80's.
Now with the passing of Richard Wright they will never be a concert with the Original Line up (I'm not counting Syd)
Floyd songs are:
Speak to Me / Breath
Money
Wish You Were Here
Comfortably Numb
Disc 4 has a mini documentary of Pink Floyd reheresing for the concert.
This is a must for all Pink Floyd fans",1227744000,,462,4.261363636363637
2439587,5,B000BSXYJA,"Great service from the seller! DVD and packaging in excellent shape. And, the content was much better than I expected. I bought this for the Pink Floyd reunion and got that and so much more. The quality of the DVD is amazing and the backstage footage is fun - it would be nice to have had more of that, though. It's a phenomonal collection and I'm really glad I purchased it. Thank you, Amazon!",1200268800,,394,4.337837837837838
2439588,4,B000BSXYJA,Loved most of it...some of the acts don't do anything for me but the ones that do are great.,1196380800,,92,3.8947368421052633
2439589,3,B000BSXYJA,"This is a 4-DVD set, which takes some of the performances from most of the Live 8 venues.  Performances by a number of the ""big names"" who performed at the nine Live 8 venues appear here (there's about 10 hours of material).  This is a good set for a starter, to get a good cross-section of the artists and venues.  However, DVDs have been issued for at least some of the individual venues; so if you're more interested in getting a whole DVD of one of the venues, it's worth checking to see if the venue you want has been issued individually.",1195603200,,543,4.303921568627451
2439590,5,B000BSXYJA,"20 years ago another act like this was made by Bob Geldof to bring new attitudes against one of the most biggest problem of mankind... Well, twenty years later we're seeing that the poverty is growing and now many countries have been ""shoted"" by this problem...

It's very hard to say if this act, to promove shows around the world against the poverty, using singers and famous groups it's the best thing to do... But I think we need to have a position about this subject using some kinds of ""guns"", and the music is good way to touch or even to send a message for the people and to the government...

Well, about the dvd what can I say? A great box with a lot of music... You'll have about 10 hours of music and shows.. I liked that they promoted this stuff including all the main languages on the subtitles, english, german, french, and portuguese (thanks god!)! Great sound and a great images from the shows around the world...

I can give an important value to this event to get the reunion of the Pink Floyd after so many fights and discussions through the years.. Well, if they could come back and play again, why we can't believe that the poverty can disappear?? : ))

Great show and package... Buy it.. You won't be disappointed...",1190160000,,1239,4.4449339207048455

2439592,5,B000BSXYJA,"Live 8 recopila lo mejor de lo que fue uno de los gestos ms importantes que aunque no logr captar la atencin de los 8 que tienen el poder del mundo, es un gesto noble de todos aquellos que estuvieron involucrados.

2439593,4,B000BSXYJA,I missed the concert when it actually happened.  It's nice to have it always in this package.,1182816000,,93,4.470588235294118
2439594,5,B000BSXYJA,I bought this DVD for one reason only.....Pink Floyd Reunion.  I wasn't dissapointed.  I was however dissapointed in MTV for cutting out most of David Gilmour's guitar solo on Comfortably Numb.  The only part of the Floyd performance I didn't like was Roger singing on Wish you Were Here.  Dave probably should have sang everything.  The highlight of the concert was Gilmour's guitar solo on Comfortably Numb.  I haven't seen Dave play with that much emotion for a very long time and it gave me chills.  That is why he is one of the greatest guitar players of our time.  A must own for any Floyd fan.....,1180656000,,604,4.579439252336448
2439595,5,B000BSXYJA,"I basically bought this video to see the reunion of the Pink Floyd band - all members.  Thought the concert was excellent in general, but particularly loved the Pink Floyd portion.  If you are a fan, I highly suggest this video.",1179792000,,228,4.536585365853658
2439596,5,B000BSXYJA,"The only problem with this box set, is that there needs to be even more! While 4 discs is a great deal of material... the quality of what is presented (the song selection and the overall mixing) is simply superb.  There is something for everyone one these DVD's.  These DVD's are great to watch or just listen to wile you work around the house.  At this price, you've got to be an idiot not to pick it up!",1179100800,,405,4.166666666666667
2439597,5,B000BSXYJA,"I bought this DVD , cos as almost evey single person in the western world I watched this concert in MTV, so I WANTED , this show is plenty of good performances, I love DVD movies, concerts and whatever, actually I have 2 home teather at home (Philips and Sony) but this one it is special, the DTS sound it just simply WOW, they did a really nice job with the mix, so if you have this concert you must listen the DTS audio, for me it is the better audio that I ever heard in a DVD, Put simply it is a worthy buying",1177891200,,513,3.895238095238095
2439598,5,B000BSXYJA,"This DVD set has wonderful songs that many of us have known for years, as well as great contemporary music that is upbeat and fun. I loved putting the DVDs on and just having it as background as I did other things. I'm very glad I purchased this set.",1171670400,,250,4.122448979591836
2439599,4,B000BSXYJA,"To be honest, I purchsed this set for two reasons. 1. I had already gotten the 1985 version, and why not have both? 2. (the most important) Pink Floyd is back together again, and as one poster said: ""Pink Floyd back together again? - and they said Pigs don't fly"". There are extras using them as well. The rest of the performers were an added bonus as far as I was concerned, and the cause is awesome. Both of these Live 8 sets are treasures and testamonies to the era in which we live. My children were born in the early 80's, so they also enjoy seeing the performers from both sets.",1171411200,,584,4.223214285714286
2439600,5,B000BSXYJA,"Several other reviewers have put their lists of what these 4 DVD's contained. I won't do the same. I will however share my thoughts of the concerts and why I purchased this concert in its entirity.

I watched the beginning of several of the European concerts (London, Paris, Rome) on AOL Broadband and realised the cause of these concerts. It was indeed a day when the world came together with one aim, to listen to good music and tell our world leaders with one loud voice that poverty has to be eradicated. It was a successful day. We were entertained by the best music artists as well as listened to stories from Africa and watched pictures of famine and its effects in Europe. Bob Geldof the producer of these concerts never lost the realisation of what we were here for.

July 2nd 2005 stands for all time as the day we spoke with one voice ""Let's get rid of Poverty"". I purchased this compilation because it was for a good cause and that it had some great music from a few of my favourite bands and solo artists.

I recommend this album for any LIVE music fan.",1163548800,,1066,4.401015228426396
2439601,5,B000BSXYJA,"If you want to hear good music and have a great meeting with friends, you have to own this one.

However, I was fortunate enough to find this copy at Amazon and it's been everything I had expected and more. I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan and their performance alone was worth the price of the box set not to mention all of the other fantastic performances.

2439609,5,B000BSXYJA,"I wasn't sure what to expect,with so many artists in one set. The result is one fine artistic achievement covering just about every style of music you could wish to hear, from reggae,to latin beats, hip hop,rock,punk,funk,folk, pop, you name it. Too many highlights to mention,also that will depend on individual musical tastes. However I'll mention a few of the best and the worst......U2 kicks things off into full gear with a great 3 song set. Coldplay slows things down a bit but picks it back up inviting british singer and former Verve vocalist and great songwriter Richard Ashcroft with a soaring version of ""Bitter Sweet Symphony"".Elton John starts off strong but unfortunately makes the mistake of choosing Pete Doherty as a singing partner,Doherty clearly proves that he can neither carry a note or remember the words to the song he is singing, forcing Elton to signal  to his guitarist to end the song prematuraly. The best performance of this set is probably Madonna who knows how to work a crowd and keep the momentum going. Robbie Williams comes pretty close to Madonna in working the crowd,he obviously loves to perform and seems to feel perfectly at home onstage. Linkin Park,Snoop Dog do great versions of their songs on this set,some of the biggest disapointments surprisingly are from some of the biggest names listed, Paul McCartney's set while not bad ,is predictable,Pink Floyd's Roger Waters and David Gilmour seem to loathe each other. The Who sound awesome except for one thing,it's not The Who.

Pink Floyds timeless Comfortably Numb is always revalatory and Paul McCartney's Long and Winding Road may bring tears to your eyes  the above are all 5 stars .Trill,Coldplay,Faithless,The Proclarimers and Scissor Sisters are also very good.

The highest compliment I can give this DVD is that, at age 37, I fell in love with several of the new bands that appeared at Live 8, artists an old guy like me would never have given a fair chance.

I was not disappointed, it had, if not every, than close to every song preformed and I was even able to see myself on the third disk, pretty cool. Sound and video are pretty good, def dvd worthy.

I have since shared it with my dad and siblings. It's addicting, trust me!

2439618,5,B000BSXYJA,"I caught a glimpse of the Pink Floyd reunion on a big screen at Costco, well when I saw Roger Waters on stage with Dave Gilmour etc... I figured it must be a clip from the Live 8 show last summer. I originally purchased it for the purpose of witnessing this special event, but there is so much more to this disc set than just the Floyd reunion.

Will Smith gives an example of how fast innocent people in Africa alone are dying from hunger. I could tell my 8 year old understood the gravity of the situation as she watched patiently. Bob Geldof replayed a clip of what he witnessed 20 years earlier in Africa that inspired him to take action. He also introduced a victim/survivor from that particular famine that accompanied Madonna on the first song of her set ""Like A Prayer"". But perhaps the most inspiring and touching set was Annie Lennox and her tribute to the victims of the AIDS epidemic in Africa. I was fully expecting to see adults during this sequence but when the majority of them were innocent children, I had to pull my kids close to me and thank god for their health. Believing in humanitarian causes does not make you a liberal.

I am only vaguely aware of several of the performers in this video. Several of them I'd never even heard of. However, they were all great. One of my favorite sets was The Pet Shop Boys in Moscow. I watched this show pretty much from beginning to end. The way they time it, you'd think you were watching one show when in actuality you are watching 6 to 7 shows over the course of nearly 10 hours. This is well worth the $30.00 Amazon is asking. You won't be disappointed!",1141257600,,1617,4.368770764119601

Velvet Revolver put on a great show and I never lost interest in their performance. And I FINALLY got to watch the magic of the Floyd live. It was the 1st time I've ever seen them live, and I loved every minute of it(and I now hve it on DVD to charish!). It was great watching The Killers, and seeing them play makes me want to go to one of their concerts. The finale with Sir Mccartney and other famous music stars is truly a great performance and one not to be ignored.

 The only thing that I don't like about the DVD is that only one song from Green Day's performance was included. American Idiot was great seeing live, but I also wanted to hear Minority and their cover of Queen's We Are The Champions like in the original Live 8.

If you have a good entertainment system, this is a must buy!  The remastering is incredible.  I've watched the whole thing many, many times.

I'm confused. Best Buy was showing Coldplay's set from Live 8 on their Big Screen, Hi-Def TVs the other day and the picture and sound were amazing. The picture, in particular, really jumped out at me. It was crystal-clear. Is Best Buy's in-store feed showing the Live 8 DVD? If so, the quality of the Live 8 DVD  is brilliant, but I continue to read reviews below that complain about the DVD's visual qualities.

As for the sets, Coldplay, U2, Pink Floyd, The Killers and The Who were awesome! But I still have questions/concerns about the DVD's quality. Somebody help. Thanks.",1137369600,,588,4.689320388349515
2439632,1,B000BSXYJA,"This review is not specifically of the Live 8 concert,  or of the idea behind it.  Both were great,  and I applaud them.  If I were reviewing the concert alone,  or even the idea to raise awareness,  my rating and review would be far less harsh.

However,  this DVD features a heavily chopped down setlist,  rmoving many great tracks fom some of my favorite acts.  The picture is roughly the same I would have ended up with had I made a VCR recording (SLP) and run it through my VCR a few dozen times.  The Audio,  while better than TV,  seems to leave a lot to be desired in tems of fidelity.

All these flaws come from an attempt to smash the concert sets onto 4 DVDs,  causing both quality and content to suffer.  To say this DVD set does not do the concert justice is an understatement on par with ""The Titanic sprung a leak.""

When purchasing this DVD set,  review the track listing.  Consider the quality in picture and sound you are being asked to settle for.  The remaining tracks may be all you want,  and the video and sound issues might be okay with you if the loss of cetain comment isn't enough to deter you.  but ddo think about your purchase,  as this is worlds away from the concert that we saw on TV.",1137196800,,1217,4.241228070175438

2439635,5,B000BSXYJA,"My lovely bride came through for me in a big way by giving me this DVD set for Xmas, and I had set my expectations relatively high, given the snippets I had seen of this concert on July 2nd looked great.  I decided to take a quick look at this my gift the day after Xmas, and spent the ENTIRE DAY mesmerized! The live concert video footage was tremendous, and the sound was simply astounding in Dolby Digital 5.1.

The best part for me was Disk 3: The Pink Floyd reunion after 20+ years since Roger Waters had left Pink Floyd.  According to a Billboard, the currently configured Pink Floyd had not performed live with Roger Waters since 1981, and had not performed live as currently configured since the release of their album ""The Division Bell"" in 1994.

David Gilmour and Roger Waters came together on the London stage as if they had never been apart, and their song set was clearly the highlight for me.  The set was performed at night, and the clarity and detail of the video was outstanding.  On Disk 4 is an extra of the reunited Pink Floyd rehearsing for Live8, where Roger Waters is interviewed and explains how they pulled off this one-time (as of now) reunion.

There were a few negatives, one being the camera shots when panning the audience on numerous occasions seemed blurred.  The other had to do with re-setting the audio to Dolby Digital 5.1 for each DVD before I listened to it.  The default was Dolby Stereo, which was still very good but not the same as 5.1.

Overall, this is an outstanding collection of musical talent delivered in high quality sound and video.  Your biggest issue will be explaining to your ""significant other"" the amount of time you'll need to go through this remarkable collection!",1135814400,,1724,4.583061889250814

- the high amount of video compression used.  Several scences show blocks due to the amt of material squeezed onto the discs.  Definitely not HD, and should only be watched on small screens.

- the chopping up of artists' sets.  Why leave out the Dido songs?  What happened to REM's 'Imitation of life'.  Green Day?  C'mon how about the full set?

- The extra Edinburgh show is great, but couldn't that one have gone as a seperate set, like Rome and Paris?  I wish the full 4-discs could have been the Hyde Park show.",1135555200,,626,4.4035087719298245

The lineup is also great. I heard some bands that I have never even heard of that I am now a fan of.

The best part is of course PINK FLOYD's awesome set. I could not believe what I was seeing when I first saw it live & now to see it with the great sound quality is just amazing. They are one of the few bands that had every one of their songs on the DVD. I have been telling people that it is 2 1/2 DVD's of great opening bands for PINK FLOYD.

My only complaint is that they did not have Green Days cover of Queens ""We are the champions"". I felt that they did a great job with that cover & it should of been on the DVD.

The audio is great in 2.0 stereo and in 5.1 and DTS it will blow you away. Instead of having chapter listings they have each DVD's list of performers for easy searching for your favorite and start at the beginning of that act. But the chapters are setup so you can skip individual songs. The Video is 16:9 and excellent and many things were cleaned up from the original broadcast feeds. As for the performances, if you saw it on TV, you already know how good it was and if you didn't you will not be disappointed.

I'm buying one for everyone on my holiday shopping list that I know will enjoy these concerts.

I was not disappointed.

I will not comment on the actual concerts or my ""favorite parts"" or anything like that.  If you have not seen any of these concerts, you DEFINITELY need to get this DVD set.

One note before I continue:  even though there are 4 DVDs in this package, it DOES NOT include the complete Philadelphia and London/Hyde Park concerts.  The vast majority of both concerts ARE included, but it definitely does not include everything.  You have been warned.

This compilation takes all of the concert footage from that memorable day and rolls it into one beautiful, 10 hour concert.  The journey begins at the top of the London/Hyde Park concert with U2 and Paul McCartney.  The coverage continues in order from Hyde Park, then begins to alternate among all of the concerts.  The concert ends on Disc 3 as the Hyde Park concert ended, with Paul McCartney leading all of the London artists in ""Hey Jude.""

Disc 4 includes footage from the Edinburgh concert on 6 July 2005 (the ""final push"" concert).  It also contains some extra footage from the 2 July 2005 concerts that were not included on the first three discs.

For those of you who, like me, watched the concerts live on AOL and then enjoyed their rebroadcasts of the event all summer, the three-disc concert feels similar to their main rebroadcast in which they, too, featured footage from all of the concerts.  It very well may be the same compilation with regard to content - I am not positive on that, though.

The footage is truly gorgeous.  The live producers did a fantastic (almost super-human) job at trying to capture all of the action and emotion in real time at each venue.  The producers for this DVD edition, however, added more polish to an already well-done production.  The audio was re-mixed and corrected mistakes that were found in the live feed.  The video, too, was remastered to provide better angles throughout the concerts.  The video itself is beautiful.  Crisp, clean, and fluid.

The footage is uncensored, which was nice to see.  With that, though, know that some of the footage is not for young ears.  Watch the concert first before showing it to your youngsters.

Full concert footage for the Berlin, Paris, Rome, and Toronto concerts is available separately.  I am hoping that they also release full-concert editions of the Hyde Park and Philadelphia concerts, too.

Some other things that would have been cool to include:

U2 singing Unchained Melody

Not censoring Bono during Vertigo

More Dido (Thank You and White Flag)

More Keane

More Killers (although, they only sang one song - general complaint.)

A better angle for the workup to Floyd taking the stage

Some really cool things they could have included:

The *entire* audience in Hyde Park singing along to Bon Jovi's simulcast from Philly

Pink Floyd's soundcheck from the night before - Floyd fans - oh my god, that was amazing to hear.  We watched through tiny holes in the huge metal wall (fitting...) surrounding the field and a host of other people climbed trees to get a better view.  It was a full rehearsal with the video screens, lights, smoke the works.  All the workers dropped what they were doing and were watching Floyd.  It was awesome to hear that music rolling across a basically empty Hyde Park and looking at the smiles on everyone's face.

They should have included some more video of the crowd before the show and maybe stuff from around London.

Interviews with the artists backstage would have broken up the jarring artist to artist transitions.

In terms of video and sound quality - it's better than I expected.  I don't have surround, so I can't comment on that mix.  If it was up to me, they would have had a 12 disc set capturing every second of that day - but I understand this isn't practical.

What cheeses me off is the selective nature of this one, and this time it's not due to loss of the footage.

That's not to say it's all bad.  Highlights?  Yeah, there were a few.  Along with the aforementioned Floyd taking The Who's advice and agreeing to get together before they get much older, were The Who, cut in half by the passage of time (and their bassist) but thankfully Roger and Pete's hopes have been dashed at hoping they die before they get old.  Geldof's ""Great Song of Indifference"" with Campino from Die Toten Hosen was great.  U2 almost made me feel like it was pre-1985 all over again, until ""One"" came on.  I almost respect Green Day again, though they're still responsible for the crop of Hot Topic punks I despise.  Elton John was fantastic.  He must keep Davey Johnstone in a cryofreezer between shows.  The guy looks the same as he did when Lady Reg was wearing the Donald Duck costume onstage.  Sarah MacLachlan is back to her wood nymph/earth mother phase that was missed when she chopped off her hair and headed up Vulvapalooza at the close of the 1990s.  Bryan Ferry still looks the same as he did last time, though one question in regard to their performance: Where's Phil?

The absolute top gear one for me though was Robbie Williams.  Only he would have bottle enough to attempt to come off like Freddie Mercury and succeed at it!  His performance of ""Let Me Entertain You"" is right up there with Queen's runthrough of ""Hammer to Fall"" from the first Live Aid.  Take that, indeed.

Look, unless you were there, you didn't see 98% of this.  Get it and the site specific DVDs later this month.  Feed the world.  Let them know it's Christmas time again.

2439654,5,B000BSXYJA,"Let's face it.  Nobody has the kind of acceptance of so many different styles or genres of music that they would sit and watch every song on every disc from this set.  We all have our favorites, but this is where the DVD format has the advantage over older video cassette tapes.  The ability to instantly access the things we like and to effortlessly skip the parts that offer nothing to us makes a diverse compilation like this work, and it could only work on DVD.  Towards that end, this is a great set.  The navigation is very intuitive.  You can search by artist, click on that chosen singer or group and watch all of the performances from them.  At less than 10 bucks per disc, even while skipping over the parts I don't wish to hear, this is a very good price.

The quality of the audio and video is first class for this set.  Unlike the 1985 concert where home video was still an infant technology, you can tell that this show was conceived from the beginning as something to be rendered as clear, bright and pristine in a package that really documents the day.  The 5.1 sound is as good as any from my large collection of concert DVDs.  The visual image is very sharp and contrasty, even on my old analog T.V.  These discs lack for nothing as far as the technical rendering is concerned.

Truth be told, I was planning on buying this DVD on the day of the concert just to have a video of that terrific Pink Floyd set, and yes, it sounds and looks better than I remember it from the actual live broadcast.  I feel I got my money's worth from just that group (the performance and the behind the scenes rehearsal footage and interviews), and there is so much more to see and hear.  I'm happy!",1131408000,,1697,4.325949367088608
2439655,5,B000BSXYJA,"These DVD's are amazing!  I mainly bought them cause I'm a HUGE Pink Floyd fan, and their set was amazing.  But to pay 30-40 bucks for this many artists, what could be better?!?  The cause is great, the dvd quality is great, the artists are great, the songs are great...  WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT!?!",1131408000,,296,4.327272727272727
2439656,5,B000BSXYJA,"Goosebumps moments:

- Paul McCartney with U2 in doing Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band live for the first time ever with some faux Beatles in Pepper outfits playing french horns

- U2's set including their version of Unchained Melody

- Coldplay bringing out Richard Ashcroft to sing Bittersweet Symphony

- Black Eyed Peas with Stephan and Rita Marley to sing Get up Stand Up

- Kanye West backed by a Sting section

- Dido joined by Youssou N'Dour during Thank You

- The opening to Dave Matthews Band's Dreamgirl

- Robbie Williams singing Angels they way it supposed to - without Jessica Simpson

- Green Day covering Queen's We Are the Champions

- Stevie Wonder and Adam Levane of Maroon 5 doing a duet on Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours

- Pink Floyd whole set, extra Goosebumps at the beginning of each song

- Maroon 5 covering Neil Young's Rockin in the Free World

- Alicia Keys' tribute to Luther Vandross

- Jay-Z backed by Linkin Park who did a faithful Public Service Announcement

Tear Jerkers:

- Bob Geldolf bring out an African Girl who, at the time of Live Aid, was only given ten seconds to live

- Annie Lennox playing Why over a montage of AIDS victims

- The finale in London with everyone singing Hey Jude with Paul McCartney

Other interesting tidbits:

- Snoop Dogg was able to get 5 F-bombs pass the MTV censors (and the N-word once). Granted he mumbles some and they weren't part of the song. The bigger slip was they Pink Floyd let the blatant word in Pink Floyd's Money or maybe they let it slip because it Floyd.

- Beyonc wore a skirt that was as short as it could have been without showing off her Kootchiepop.

- I was a little disappointed that no one pulled a Phil Collins this year.

- The only American acts in Rome - Tim McGraw & Faith Hill?

- UB40 were introduced saying they were going to perform a medley of their hits. Shouldn't it been a medley of other people's hits?

- Who invited Randy Jackson? I had to laugh when I spotted him playing a tiny keyboard when Mariah Carey already had two keyboarders on stage with two large keyboards themselves.

- What was up with Stevie Wonder's moustache/beard thing around his mouth? Who let him out of the house like that?

- There were a lot of lyric changes to reflect the festivities including U2, Sting but my favorite was Kanye West switch the line in Jesus Walks into, ""And George Bush gets paid off of all of that.""

- When I saw you could download Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club from the concert on iTunes, I thought the whole concert would be available, but alas the only other song available (for now hopefully) was The Long and Winding Road.

The best singers, songwriters and bands put on one hell of a show. This DVD set is highly recommended. I cant wait for it myself.

THE GREATEST SHOWS ON EARTH TO BE RELEASED ON DVD

EMI Are Proud To Announce The DVD Release Of Live 8 On Tuesday, November 8, 2005 In Canada

On November 8 the biggest live event DVD project of its kind will be released. The Live 8 DVD brings together performances from the amazing series of concerts which took place around the world on July 2, 2005.

Live 8 One Day One Concert One World

The 4-disc set contains three discs of live footage taken from the Live 8 shows staged in London and Philadelphia alongside key highlights from the seven other events staged across the world. Every artist who performed at Londons Hyde Park and Philadelphias Museum Of Art appear on the DVD, many of them with their full sets.

It was 20 years ago today The Live 8 DVD opens with U2 and Paul McCartneys crowd-rousing rendition of Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band and also features Pink Floyds historical reunion, Robbie Williamss show-stopping performance and Madonnas breathtakingly energetic set. Younger artists such as Snow Patrol, The Killers and Joss Stone comfortably intertwine with rock n roll legends such as The Who and Sting. One-off duets come from Paul McCartney and George Michael, Stevie Wonder and Adam Levine (Maroon 5), Elton John and Pete Doherty and Coldplay and Richard Ashcroft.

Disc 3 closes as the London concert closed on July 2 with the stars of Live 8 Hyde Park taking to the stage for the stunning Hey Jude finale.

Philadelphia also hosted incredible performances from amazing superstars such as Destinys Child, Bon Jovi, Black Eyed Peas, Sarah McLachlan with Josh Groban and soul legend Stevie Wonder.

Also threaded through the UK and US acts are performances from artists who appeared at the Live 8 concerts in the Toronto area, Rome, Paris, Berlin, Johannesburg and Moscow. Tracks from Green Day, Brian Wilson and Roxy Music in Berlin and Neil Young, Bryan Adams and Jet in Toronto are included along with the Pet Shop Boys in Moscow, Duran Duran in Rome, Vusi Mahlasela in Johannesburg and Placebo and Muse in Paris.

Disc 4 features exclusive extras including a never-before-seen backstage documentary filmed at Hyde Park, Pink Floyds Live 8 reunion rehearsal, more acts from Live 8s global concerts including McFly and Bjork in Tokyo, films by The Who and Travis and a contribution from Ricky Gervais.

The special features section will offer highlights from Edinburghs Final Push concert at Murrayfield on July 6 which will include performances from James Brown, Travis and The Proclaimers.

Single disc sets for the Canadian, French, German and Italian Live 8 concerts have also been produced. These will focus further on each countrys concert and will be available globally.

I hope this will be the biggest selling DVD of all time. It deserves to be. More importantly perhaps, it should be, for it will help us achieve our goal of changing the lives of the extreme poor for the better and making our generation the one that helped end the disgrace of poverty, says Live 8 organiser Sir Bob Geldof.

Money raised from sales of the Live 8 DVD will go to the Band Aid Trust for the relief of hunger and poverty in Africa.

Live 8 was held on 2 July 2005. Nine simultaneous, free concerts starring the cream of international rock and pop artists were staged in London, Paris, Toronto, Berlin, Rome, Tokyo, Moscow, Johannesburg and Philadelphia. The concerts acted as a starting point for The Long Walk To Justice in support of the Make Poverty History and Global Call To Action campaigns and was timed to focus attention on the critical decisions made by the G8 summit four days later.

Youre such a lovely audience, wed like to take you home with us sang Bono. Now the million-strong live audience and 5 billion viewers around the world can take Live 8 home with them",1128816000,,4062,4.753911806543385

2439661,5,B000BSXYJA,"Live 8 was perhaps the most monumental event of this year. Almost every huge artist appeared for this event. Rap, rock, reggae, pop, etc.

A large part of this DVD will go to proceeds as well, so you're giving to charity as well as getting a great reward. Fantastic for a Christmas gift.",1128124800,,287,4.415094339622642
2439662,5,B000BSXYJA,"Having watched the Live 8 concerts all day, I can say it isn't just a concert (although it's probably the best concert I have ever seen and I only wish I could have been in London to watch it live). This is a message of peace and ending poverty in Africa. Military force is not the answer. The reason Africa is having problems is because of debt reparations. It is forced to repay its debt to the US and other countries by buying weapons from the US and is not allowed to use any money that the US or other countries have given to Africa to establish schools, hospitals or any other critical, foundation infrastructure the country needs to bring it out of its depression.

As far as the concert itself, it was simply stunning. For me, it really didn't get any better than watching U2 and Keane perform. Bono and Tom Chaplin are absolutely stunning performers, feeding off the energy of the crowd to really put power and emotion into their performances. Hopefully, all of the concerts will be produced in their entirety to truly capture the energy and the message of the events.",1127520000,,1077,4.523076923076923

I don't know whether it was the relief of finally being there after all the anticipation, the fact that everyone wouod be jealous, the amazing acts or the size of the event but it was incredible. All of the acts (even velvet revolver who were not my favourite, by far) were amazing. The only downfall was that i had to leave before Pink Flyd and the Who to catch my late train. But, that's why the DVD is going to be good! I think i'd buy it for the pure novelty of spending 12 hours trying to find the dot of my head in the crowd but for everyone else the quality of the songs and speeches is enough to buy this dvd, so do it! And help charity while doing it x",1124928000,,732,3.9194630872483223

They hardly showed any full performances since the veejays kept cutting them off (they even managed to cut off Pink Floyd) and didn't show about half the acts (I wasted eight hours of my life waiting to see Duran Duran, Def Leppard and Motley Crue, none of whom were shown). Hopefully, they will release the full shows on dvd, and if they have to cut any performances out, make it Green Day's version of ""We Are The Champions"". Now that was awful.
