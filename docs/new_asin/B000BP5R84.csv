2434551,4,B000BP5R84,"I would have given the dvd a 5, but the film is a little grainy. Other than that the instructions are clear, concise, easy to follow. It moves along in a nice pace. I have bought numerous dance instruction dvd's and i have liked the Shawn Trautman series the best by far.",1366416000,,271,4.230769230769231
2434552,5,B000BP5R84,"If you cannot keep the beat, do not know basic holds for dancing with a partner and do not understand how to give a strong lead, Shawn Trautman has a more-simplistic treatment of the Cha Cha for you (see his ""101"" series). I bought a pile of Latin dance-instruction DVDs for my father to learn the dances being done in Florida.  This is the one that he studied. Since I had to help him decipher why a step did not work, I can report that this ""beginner"" product lightly covers the three aforementioned topics and demonstrates the steps for Cha Cha Basic, Progressive Basic, Cross-Body Leads, Crossover Breaks, Back Breaks, Sliding Doors, Solo Turns and the Chase -- plus typical closings (twirls, walkaround turns).  Shawn uses a few terms that are not adequately explained (e.g., Open Break, Lock Step, Military Turn) but the DVD is better than many others because it breaks out the Man's steps from the Lady's steps and then demonstrates how the pieces look when they are put together.",1358208000,,987,4.732558139534884
2434553,5,B000BP5R84,"My husband and I love this one! We started with Shawn Trautmans Two Step DVD's and learned them so easily that we decided to be more adventurous. My husband is a true Two Step fan, but the Cha Cha is one of our favorites now. I have many of his DVD's. I think this is one of the quickest to learn. My favorite songs for the Cha Cha are Neon Moon and an oldie called Tea For Two. The video shoots are perfect for learning. Take their advise and guys stand where Shawn is and gals stand where Joanne is. You will be surprise how easy this is to follow. Alicen Hardy.",1229299200,,564,4.044642857142857
2434554,5,B000BP5R84,"Like the other DVD's in Shawn Trautman's collection, this video was just like taking live personal Cha-Cha lessons, except real lessons cost $60 per hour. The level of repetition and pace of the teaching allows you to dance right along with the video without having to constantly stop, rewind and replay. If you didn't get a step right the first time it is OK, because Shawn and Joanna are going to show you again in just a minute. For each new step, you first see the couple together in dance frame. This is important, because many other videos start with the leader walking through the steps alone ""air-dancing"", and it is impossible to figure out what in the world he is trying to do. Shawn and Joanna show you the steps first together in dance frame so you can see how you and your partner are suppose to look. Then Shawn teaches the leader's part (with lots of helpful hints including do's and don'ts), then Joanna does the same for just the followers.  Finally they are back in dance frame showing the steps with music.  At the end of the video they put the 7 or so new steps together in combinations and dance at full speed to music which allows you to see how each new step would fit into combinations and ultimate coreography. There are lots of fine points on leading and following. One, in particular that hit home with us, is a subtle change in hand hold on a maneuver called the sliding door.  Until I saw this, I could never find my wife's hands when doing this step. Using Shawn's ""slip-knot"" hold, I now find her hands every time. Shawn and Joanne keep things cool and casual and they are certainly likeable and fun. I have purchased several of Shawn Trautman's DVD's.  They are all this good.  When you are done with them...you are not done with them...ours keep coming back off the shelf for a refresher and practice time.  For us, once the lesson is over, the DVD becomes a refernece tool and practice tool.  I highly recommend using this DVD to learn the Cha-Cha as a beginner and to hone your skills as an experienced dancer. Hey Shawn...that sliding door move gets us lots of good comments at the dance club! Thanks for sharing it with us.

My only complaint is that I'd love for Shawn to have a ""Cool and Classy Cha-Cha Volume 2"" DVD that I could buy.  I am ready for the next set of lessons.",1190332800,7,2314,4.425882352941176
2434555,5,B000BP5R84,"Shawn Trautman's instructions go much further than showing how to dance - he teaches how to get there confidently and without any stress. From the very first moment he makes it clear that one will make it 100%. The instruction pace is perfectly coordinated with one's growing level of apprehension: very detailed and ""patient"" at the beginning and with apparently growing confidence in student as it goes. Amazing is the sensation of, while student watches the instructions, Shawn also sees the student during the class, as his help arrives right at the time the questions come up. Learning with Shawn is a great fun, he has a great sense of humor. We practiced over two hours a day during a week, we just could not stop. By the end of the course we could confidently perform every move in any combination. And most importantly, Shawn teaches people relate to each other. His emphasis on the roles of leader and follower is very sharp. We could not imagine that in just one week we learn to clearly and unmistakably communicate. The only thing to worry about is that learning with Shawn is highly addictive. We already have bought a 3CD set of West Coast Swing and can't wait for the coming release of more Cha-Cha instructions.",1189900800,5,1228,4.716279069767442

2434557,5,B000BP5R84,This was my first DVD with Shawn Trautman and it was very helpful. I like to think about what I am learning and Shawn Trautman encourages that thinking process in his dance lessons. I have recommended this DVD to many of my friends.,1130889600,14,232,4.4186046511627906

8090382,5,B000BP5R84,"I bought these to teach my children about God and important Bible stories. I wanted to use them to show my children the stories we are reading, and have them come to life.  The videos are high quality and perfect for my 5, 4 and 2 year old. These videos are perfect for parents wanting something other than Veggie Tales Bible stories. We love Veggie Tales, but needed another perspective to watch. My 5 and 4 year old sons keep asking to watch David and Goliath and Noah again and again. I'm very happy I purchased these videos. It gives me a chance to share these beloved stories with my children that I learned about as a child.",1437004800,,630,4.338983050847458
8090383,4,B000BP5R84,"The programs will get you on the dance floor.  It shows the steps from different angles.  It is understood that where to step, who leads, etc. is as important as keeping the rhythm.  This video will let you feel comfortable on the dance floor and let you advance at your own pace.  As it is with learning anything, you cannot just watch the video.  You have to get up and try it and hopefully one of your two left feet will become a right one.",1419206400,,443,4.1647058823529415
8090384,5,B000BP5R84,"OMG! This was so much fun! My hubby and I are pretty much self taught with Shawn's video's. Our first love is the two-step then I think my hubby would say the Cha-Cha was next. I bought this as a gift for him and we love it. We knew zero about the cha-cha and now we can get do two cha-cha line dances and the partner line dance. Word of caution when you get on the dance floor. My hubby will ask the band for a ""cha-cha"" and many times the band has no idea. Give them the name of the song. ie My Maria, Brown Eyed Girl ect. LOL. There is a really old song called Tea for Two that is a blast with the couples cha cha. Don't let the price fool you. This is a great DVD!  We just ordered the new Cha Cha 101. Will give an update when we get going with it!",1405555200,,753,3.7658227848101267
