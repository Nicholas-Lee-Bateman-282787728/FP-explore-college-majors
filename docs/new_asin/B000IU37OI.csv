8573186,5,B000IU37OI,"Although this does not cover the earlier work of this great filmmaker, this is still a superb introduction to one of the world's great filmmakers. For anybody interested in visual cinema irrespective of the documentary fiction divide or even that between anthropology and the avant garde. This is essential and often simply astounding viewing.
