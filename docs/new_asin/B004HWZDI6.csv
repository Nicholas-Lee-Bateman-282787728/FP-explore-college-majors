8429731,4,B004HWZDI6,"Nifty little black and white Brit movies, made for entertainment. ""The 20 questions Murder Mystery"" is really good. ""Tread Softly"" not as good but at least has a lot of energy and Patricia Dainton is cute.",1504915200,,205,4.722222222222222
8429732,4,B004HWZDI6,"The ""20 Questions Murder Mystery ""- based on the radio programme ""20 Questions"" is very good, ""Tread Softly"" less so.",1494028800,,117,4.9
8429733,3,B004HWZDI6,"It would be an exaggeration to describe these two morsels as Brit noir or neglected masterpieces. However  you could do worse on a rainy night than these tidy little thrillers. Both have show biz backdrops and are quite well done for B productions. I rate the 20 Questions Murder Mystery as the superior item, principally because of the excessive musical numbers - however competently performed - in Tread Softly, which comes perilously close to being a musical with murder case subplot. Anyway great to see all those second-tier but very capable British actors. And fascinating the on-location scenes of early Fifties London.",1437350400,2,626,5.137254901960785
8429734,3,B004HWZDI6,It was only mildly entertaining.  I did enjoy the clothing and cars from the past and seeing some actors when they were young.,1357516800,2,126,4.478260869565218
