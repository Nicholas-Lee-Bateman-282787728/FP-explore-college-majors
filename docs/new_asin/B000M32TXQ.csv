8166126,5,B000M32TXQ,For all fans that enjoy hearing stories of historic Hollywood and the celebs that made it what it is today.  Scott Michaels is fun and very informative - has really done his research.  For those of us that want to know more than just the basic bio of the famous and legendary.  It was even better than I expected. I am looking forward to new editions as quick as he can release them! This is a must for your Hollywood collection!,1286928000,2,429,4.271604938271605

  Packed with fascinating insights into not only the deaths of the Stars but of their lives too, this is a delicious drive through the rich and famous from where they liked to hang out to where they died. Listening to the commentary, you can tell that not only does Mr Micheals loves what he does but that as he puts it.. ""Gets it""

  We see inside famous death scenes, hear what the autopsy report has to say and then see the death certificate. Be outraged as we hear about The Ambassador Hotel and see what became of this beautiful, historic building. Chuckle as you listen to Scott's opinions as we visit the Bat Cave and view the Hollywood sign (as you've never seen it)

 For me, the segment where you see Marilyn Monroe's house, just to glimpse that famous window to her bedroom is worth the price of this DVD alone.

 I could sit here and rave on and on about this DVD but instead I will say this: If you want a hugely entertaining, funny, clever and very well crafted afternoons viewing that you will never tire of watching then buy this DVD now. Hopefully Volume two will be released soon, in the mean time I will have to settle for this viewing. Don't delay....",1175212800,19,1443,4.390977443609023
8166131,5,B000M32TXQ,"I strongly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in Hollywood history. Scott Michaels is an excellent host and he reveals some of the darker stories that come from Hollywood. He does so with a sense of humor, but never out of disrespect. Some of the images can be disturbing, so I would not recommend this DVD for young children or those who get upset easily.

Scott takes you to the locations where some of the Hollywood famous died and gives accurate information. Michaels has done his research very well. This DVD is a great addition to anyone who has been able to go on the tour itself and would also be good for those who do not live close enough to Hollywood to do so.",1172361600,14,676,4.408
