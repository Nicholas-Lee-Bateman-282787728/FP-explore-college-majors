8761825,2,B01FYKBESW,"The Invoking 2 doesn't have anything to do with the equally boring The Invoking (2013). That was about a house with some dark family secrets. This one takes the anthology format, does nothing at all with it and adds some dull ""paranormal events"" and only in about an hour's time. It is the type of rubbish you'd find in a college film class without any art leanings. The acting is non-existent and so is the story-line. Cheap special effects don't help much either.

""U-Turn"" - A man picks up a silent hitchhiker and finds another accident on the road.

""Insane"" - A filmmaker with his guide in an abandoned asylum are haunted.

""Alone"" - A druggie woman at home is bothered by the image of her double.

""Do Not Disturb"" - A serial killer in a hotel room gets weird cards from a ghost.

""Natal"" - A crazy woman at a cabin is driven nuts by the sound of scratching.

 ""Melissa"" - A girl dials 911 to tell them about a masked man near her home.

You'd probably have more fun watching the old 1970's horror anthologies like The House That Dripped Blood (1971), Tales from the Crypt (1972), Asylum (1972), From Beyond the Grave (1974), The Vault of Horror (1973), and Trilogy of Terror (1975).",1469664000,,1189,4.472222222222222
