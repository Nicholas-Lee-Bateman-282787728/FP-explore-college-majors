8240162,2,B00113ALPY,I bought this dvd principally to watch Grand Pas Classique but was disappointed with the poor quality of the recording.  The background was so dark it was hard to see.  I am now in search of a better recording that shows the brilliance of Sylvie Guillem.,1414454400,,254,4.5
8240163,1,B00113ALPY,"This DVD was totally unwatchable.  I was excited when I saw that Escamelo was one of the ballets.  But when it came on all I could see was a red cape waving around and sometimes a hint of flesh tones.

V.I.E.W. DVD's have a tendancy to be dark, but one would think that they'd try harder to clean then up better.  I must admit that Paris Opera Ballet - Six Ballets is great, but it too is too dark.  But you can see what's going on.",1310083200,5,432,3.9767441860465116
8240164,1,B00113ALPY,"This DVD is a joke.  It's so dark that most of the time you can't really see the dancers.  In ""Le Petit Pan"", you see vague shapes moving around, nothing more, then at the end the face of a man eating.  In others some people in tights are stretching and walking around.  It picks up a little in the last ballet ""The White Swan"" of Swan Lake; unfortunately the cameraman who must be as bored as I am focuses on the gloomy and tormented faces of the dancers and stays there.
The only good part is the two minutes bonus of the Black Swan of Swan Lake.",1215993600,37,548,4.093457943925234
8240165,2,B00113ALPY,"I had never heard of Mr Norbert Schmucki before I watched this video. He signs 5 out of the 7 pieces here, making such a waste of one the best ballet ensemble in the world. It ranges from the ridiculous Escamillo, sort  of a parody of ""Don Quixote"", to an infamous pas-de-deux  ""Une Femme"".  The Paris Opera Ballet could have well spared our  time and patient with such a display of amateur coreography: Mr Schmucki  manages to use all the modern dance cliches, all the time, in every work!  Silvie Guillem and Manuel Legris in ""Grand Pas Classique"" are  fantastic, the only reason I'm giving this video 2 stars. Noella Pontois  presents a disappointing White Swan, the least one would expect from such a  star.",943920000,25,711,4.624
8240166,5,B00113ALPY,Sylvie Guillem had proven once again that she is the greatest balerina of our time. She was magnificant.,940982400,5,104,4.833333333333333
