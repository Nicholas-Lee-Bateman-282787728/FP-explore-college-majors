8725194,5,B011Z8LH8O,"My expectations were beyond surpassed by this film! As a connoisseur of acting and film, I was surprised. I wasn't sure what to expect with the unknown actors and 1940's setting but, it was all pulled off with excellence. I appreciated all the detail and work they put in to accomplish a noteworthy message. I am happy to give this 5 stars and pass it on to my family and friends.",1441324800,,380,4.366197183098592
8725195,5,B011Z8LH8O,Wonderful film about God's goodness! My family thoroughly enjoyed Wings of the Wind and will watch it many times again. This is a high quality film with great acting and a great storyline. It has a wonderful message that everyone needs to hear and is rarely addressed in Christian movies. I am happy to highly recommend this film for the entire family!,1441324800,,352,4.693548387096774
