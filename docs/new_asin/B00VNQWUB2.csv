7099831,4,B00VNQWUB2,"Now of course this isn't a review of the dvd product/set cuz it hasn't been released yet. Rather a review of the progam shown on US PBS in the past couple weeks. I liked it. Very much. All five episodes saved on my DVR's hard drive and binge viewed a few afternoons ago.

WHAT'S w/ the music track drowning out so much of the narration??!! The talking head segment audios were, for the most part, fine. It's the narration that had me hitting the vol button, to no avail btw. This is a VERY disturbing 'new' annoyance that I'm encountering more and more in recent months. New movies (dvd) and ota TV b'casts. Where's the sound editor, director, studio manager, etc, in all this? No one steering the ship? Have really dumb robots taken over those roles in 2015? The recent otherwise very enjoyable movie (dvd) ""Interstellar"" comes right to mind. I Googled and there it looks as if the director meant to do it, for dramatic effect. Really? I found it annoying Mr Director. Thank the film (dvd) gawds for the 'subtitle' button!

W/ ""First Peoples"", some very important facts were drowned out. And I don't mean kinda drowned out. Drowned out to the point that repeated rewinds didn't clear things up. I had to resort to inferring/context guessing! I'd say a good 5-10% of the narration was relegated to backgound white noise/buzzing! Had no idea what the narrator was trying to communicate.

I found that killing my right side speakers goosed up the narration level. Some.

I want the dvd set (mainly cuz Amz says 300 mins vs the approx 270 mins shown on my DVR's menu, so extra content?) but will not purchase until I read some buyer reviews. Hey, 20 bucks is 20 bucks!

I thought perhaps it was a tech asleep in the booth at my local PBS during the program's sat signal download. Based on 2-3 other comments here tho, seems like the sound problem wasn't just here in the SF Bay Area!

I'm hoping the dvd set won't inc the soundtrack issues.

Must also add, one of the 5 star reviews here, Denise(?), you didn't mention the BAD sound quality at all. The PBS b'cast in your area didn't have the sound, the music track is way way too loud, issue?",1435968000,23,2140,4.5

7099833,1,B00VNQWUB2,Completely sophomoric!  Felt like I was watching a 3rd grade documentary. Soundtrack is so annoying and drowns out narration.  Really PBS/BBC??,1435276800,9,143,5.761904761904762
7099834,1,B00VNQWUB2,"Completely agree with Jacks review.  The subject matter was interesting but that soundtrack killed it for me.  In several scenes there were these loud dramatic buildups in the soundtrack which is okay  but when they completely drown out the narration and you have no idea of what is being said, which I imagine is equally as dramatic,  whats the point?  It is a shame that nobody watched this before it aired to notice that there were some serious flaws in the final product.",1435190400,14,475,4.674698795180723

7099836,1,B00VNQWUB2,"Another PBS disappointment, right up there with anything narrated by David Pogue and Steven Johnson. The soundtrack is like something from an annoying TV commercial for cheap gaudy electronic consumer goods.

7099863,5,B00VNQWUB2,"As always, even when was was growing up in the 60s and 70s prior to internet and computers and all the devices we have today - there always was PBS. But now we have many different media outlets. CDs  and DVDs brings us many different programs.

Being in the military over 30 years and a public servant in civilian life, I keep up and read books yes turn actual pages and enjoy the latest educational subjects. This particular program made comparisons, gave eye opening insight into our past and shows clearly how we as a people evolved. I have never been to a few places mentioned in the program nor have I been to an archeological dig. This program allowed me to delve into our past in the comfort of my chair. The stories I heard as a kid are now corrected or additional information available. The best part is you not have to travel farther than your viewing device, and don't need a masters or doctorate degree to understand what's going on. Illustrations and animations provides much to helping understand what was happening.

And yes there is excitement when you view this program because now you are testing and improving knowledge you may or may not already learned.

These programs are worth every penny. And you never grow old from learning. Great gift for kids and family oriented. Thank you PBS and all PBS supporters. As a matter of fact the sales of items like this helps support funding needed to continue such educational programming.",1517961600,3,1450,4.65234375
7099864,2,B00VNQWUB2,I agree with the other critical reviews. I think the production should have focused on the discoveries and the science rather than veering off into storytelling and imagination.

7099905,5,B00VNQWUB2,"First Peoples is a 2015 five-part documentary series from PBS, which examines the origin of the present-day human species. It focuses on the specific scientific techniques and procedures from the fields of Anthropology, Archaeology, and Genetics that have been utilized in the enduring search for a greater understanding of the evolution of modern humans from their prehistoric predecessors. It provides an overview of the anatomical, cognitive, and adaptive changes which have facilitated this transition, during the remarkable development of the contemporary human being, that has transpired over many thousands of years. There is an emphasis on the intermingling of disparate prehistoric populations, and the resultant combination of genes and genetic traits, which has resulted in significantly increased resilience, and much greater ability to survive and flourish. First Peoples is an outstanding Anthropology Documentary, which is decidedly interesting, informative, and educational, and which merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1504310400,2,1070,6.0927152317880795

(Worst scene:  the archaelogist and the shaman in Yucatan smoking toad psychedelic - setting BAD example for kids who watch this show.  What's up with that?!

7099950,3,B00VNQWUB2,"At the top I want to disclose that I have been a TV producer, mostly sci-tech and news, but I have also worked on documentaries including multi-part series. So I probably look at this more demandingly than many others would.

I wish I could give it a higher rating. But I give it three stars ONLY because at least they tried to do something serious, even if the execution was terrible. If I were rating this in comparison to other serious documentaries, It would be one star.

The central problem is that there simply isn't enough material for a five-part documentary series. Not in terms of interviews, illustrative video recreations, overall content and even script (yes, in one episode after another snippets of narration with the same illustration is repeated from earlier episodes).

And this reflects a paucity of ideas. The basic idea of the series is that homo sapiens is a mongrel species, that even in Africa we have admixtures from earlier varieties of humans that date from before nature even came up with us.

Like, duh ... because that's where modern humans come from ... from pre-modern humans.

Anyways, the false dichotomy is set up between the genuine original modern humans and the mongrel version which just happens to be ... modern humans.

So then this scenario is posited again and again: ""modern"" humans coming out of Africa enter some new area, let's say the Duchy and Grand Fenwick, where old style humans called Fenwickians lived. You might think the new arrivals killed off the Fenwickians but DNA studies show we carry Fenwickian DNA inside us. The Fenwickians live on. In us.

Basically, we are the borg of hominid species. We assimilated whatever was of worth in previous humans' genetic distinctiveness, and discarded the rest. That's the story that is told repeatedly in one episode after another, and even more than once in some episodes with the episodes organized on a geographic principle that has nothing to do with this theme.

And this is wallpapered, as we say in the TV racket, by repeating the same few video clips over and over. And over. Two three or four times. Per episode.

So in episode one, a group of early homo sapiens are presented as being the settlers of the Yucatn peninsula, a little later we meet them in the Levant commingling with neanderthals fleeing the ice sheets and later again pushing into Asia and finally into Europe proper. Not similar clips. The same exact actors in the same exact video sequences.

More or less randomly little anthropological factoids, anecdotes, vignettes and mini-documentaries are thrown in to distract us from the point they are trying to make. And then they repeat those, too.

Finally, the whole mess is larded over with cheap dime-store moralizing about the nobility of diversity and the importance of being social. It's what makes us human, we're told.

As does, they could have added, being bipedal, warm-blooded and air-breathing. As for diversity being the quintessence of our biological distinctiveness, the truth is that if there is a biologically or genetically *less* diverse species on the planet it has yet to be described in the scientific literature.

And, yes, we're social, like the ants, but ants are less destructive and more efficient.

These people could have chosen two different projects. One focused on inter-species sex, the other a look at anthropological discoveries and annecdotes from different parts of the planet.

The parts on the Americas and Australia are genuinely interesting, but of course those are the ones that have nothing to do with the central theses of the series, because there were no archaic humans for modern humans to mate with in either place.",1477699200,17,3686,4.941747572815534
7099991,5,B00VNQWUB2,"This series is an excellent visual support for concepts high school students learn about anthropology, human history, genetics/DNA, etc. My particular group of students struggle with reading non-fiction (textbooks are boring) so this makes learning more interesting to them.  One of the drawbacks to this video series, though, is that so many of the featured scientists have rich foreign accents which make understanding what they are saying difficult for some students. Some of them also use terminology that students may not be familiar with so pre-viewing and pre-teaching may be necessary. Some students would benefit from an outline or note-taking sheet to keep them engaged. On balance, though, these are well-produced, interesting, visually appealing, and well worth viewing in the classroom.",1476662400,,799,5.603305785123967

7099993,3,B00VNQWUB2,"I feel this is a fairytale version of the human evolution. Archelogical and genetic evidences have been nicely laid out. I have learned some very interesting scientific facts.

But what are those scenes of different human species met and shared the cave or food together? Yes, interbreeding happens in prehistoric human, but not in such poetic way. Clashes and wars, losers species men were eaten,  women were captive and used to breed.

The kind of dramatization in this PBS show would be understandable only if the authors were considering young audience. But even if this is true, they can simply skip the details instead of giving a romanticized version.",1472342400,,658,5.018348623853211

The first episode is a solid hour about an ancient skeleton that was found in an underwater cave. Then there are theories thrown around about how it got there. None of the theories are crazy or unimaginable or anything. There is just no evidence to support them, essentially making them guesses. Then a lot of conclusions are drawn about the development and migration of humanity based on these guesses.

Yes, it's weird that a skeleton would be buried in the bottom of a flooded cave. Was the cave flooded when the body got there? Or did it flood later? (More guessing, this time of something that would seem pretty easy to check) Was the body buried there on purpose? Or did the person die there?

I don't even want to get into the 'scientist' who got high and felt the presence of the ancient person to help him understand how the bones got in the cave. That is where this series completely lost me.",1465776000,7,1016,4.451612903225806

Dr. Jack Cuozzo, an orthodontist who went to Europe and measured and X-rayed all the Neanderthal skulls he could get a hold of.  His findings, which were a great surprise to him, are that Neanderthals are humans who lived to be hundreds of years old.  The thirty-year olds (buried with, above and below the Neanderthals) still had their baby teeth!  You can also find his lectures on utube.  The museums have corrected the placement of the jaws on the Neanderthal skulls to match reality since his work was published.  Previously they had sawed off the chins and placed the jaws in such a way that the person would not be able to chew at all.  Another thing, my mother is 98 years old and in the last two years her brow has become noticeably thicker.  If you chew and press your finger against your brow you can see that muscles move which would make the bones grow, albeit very slowly.
Another very interesting subject was discovered and presented by Dr. John Sanford, also on utube, who wrote Genetic Entropy and the Mystery of the Genome. The human race has only about 3 generations left until we become extinct.  From mutations!  If you look up a list of diseases caused by mutations, it is shocking.

7100084,5,B00VNQWUB2,"I rarely write reviews. After reading a few of them, I realize how many are based on emotionally sensitive or financially motivated reactions to the material presented. Emotional responses are most often offered by those who have had their personal beliefs challenged. I am amazed by how many people will give a one or two star rating to controversial material usually religious or scientific in nature that may challenge their cherished personal beliefs; no matter how scientifically valid the evidence may be..
  I am a truth seeker. I have been mislead as a child and I need to know why! (by the way crickets don't make that noise with their legs) No one can stop me from learning what I need to learn from those who have the courage to teach the truth. My mind is open. Many teachers are thwarted for various reasons. Usually a lack of support. Funding is most often controlled by those who's financial interests may be limited by the factual information provided by those who would reveal the truth. The most obvious examples of this phenomenon come when we think of those who would financially benefit the most from the confused continuation and dispensation of the status quo.
  Lawyers and Doctors don't make money when people are agreeable and healthy! Right! Think about it... If you are looking for answers and you don't need your Doctor, Lawyer or Pastor... Who benefits?...YOU!
  This program is the most current and to-date info I have seen in my whole life. I have studied this (Adam and Eve) info since I was a child and read National Geographic every month for years on end. I have personally anticipated these recent DNA developments from my own personal and spiritual understanding of the previous facts to-date.
  This program is revolutionary in its scope and will challenge many peoples beliefs of who we are and were we come form. These people need to be challenged for their personal beliefs. Because their beliefs have been fed to them based on an exploitation of instinctive and ego motivated biases. Biases that are based on financial motivation and control.",1454716800,18,2085,4.870056497175141

There are some startling revelations that were incredibly interesting to learn about.
There is the usual silly liberal-feminist depiction of women doing the hunting 10,000 years ago. This of course ruins any film or documentary because of the political agenda that is relentless in all movies or entertainment or television these days.

Instead, they show a bit of reenactment of some bone-shaking drama out of the movies. The question was asked about why Eva's people interred her so far into a cave, about a quarter-mile from the opening. The answer? A modern self-appointed shaman inhales some smoke from toad venom and spouts nonsense about the ancient people believing the caves were an opening to the afterlife.

  I am very HAPPY to see scientists updating their speil for once !  Unlike Egyptologists who still insist the Pyramids are tombs....  I really believe all those massive structures worldwide were built to convey universal laws of math and even spiritual laws.  Even the Taj Mahal had writing on it that no one ever bothered to take into account that has a very deep spiritual context.  I can't remember the name of the  only 1 program that proved it, a PBS show (not You Tube !)  There was originally planned to build a second Taj Mahal in all black across from it.  It had also compared it with the Kaballa chakra (?) forms in the surrounding front garden.  Grand universal principals !  Same for the Mayan Pyramids, and their calendar.  All those archeological fields sorely need updating !
  In this program they still continue that man descended from ape as a fact although it has never been proven ! ?  Basically it's a likeable good program, but it is still only from the White mans view of the world ( I am white). They continue to negate other people's historical stories.

In this comparison, all of the attempts to be sensitive to indigenous cultures fractures. ""Modern humans"" are still decreed to be superior, better-- though this time, because of the development of culture and social networks, and not violence or intelligence, as previously thought. It's great seeing all the archeological adventures, but there's still a lot of work here that needs to undo the narrative of civilization as the narrative of progress, and to get past this idea of ""superiority"" as opposed to ""differently adapted."" There's a lot that modern humans have produced that has not been ""better"" for the planet. But this series does give you an idea of the awesome capabilities, drive and adaptability of our ancestors, who crossed vast terrains and invented incredible technologies.",1523145600,4,1130,5.462857142857143
