8171697,1,B000F6SS4E,"I love this series but not the fact that someone is selling this BOOTLEG edition for 95.00 when you can get the ORIGINAL release for 30 bucks here on Amazon. Don't support this bootleg edition and I know for a fact that the picture quality can not be good by putting all those episodes on 2 discs (can we say PIXELATED). Amazon shoppers, do not be fooled with this bootleg edition, get the ORIGINAL. Schroeder",1367280000,2,409,4.466666666666667
