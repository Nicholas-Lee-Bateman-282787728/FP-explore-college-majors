5644700,1,B00BLOYQI6,Too dark literally and figuratively  I kept hoping it would get better.  There seemed little hope for a better life.,1402790400,,116,4.75
5644701,5,B00BLOYQI6,"You have to be in the right mindset for this movie. It's strange. Somber. But I found it interesting. Dark and engrossing with a subtle buildup that turns deliberately anticlimactic, and it works perfectly for what I think the message of this film is. Unrequited feelings, insignificance, and a constant disappointment with the world sucks. And it's not easy to explain to others, and even harder to understand it yourself.

If I were being completely honest I would have rated this 4 stars, but the other reviews are too harsh. Watch this only if you're going into it with the mindset of observing everything that happens, not understanding perfectly. I think the story is partly supposed to be what our own imagination creates for what we don't see.",1402185600,5,751,4.8671875
5644702,2,B00BLOYQI6,"If you like the French's style of film-making watch this, but if not, run away.  This film has no plot line, but it's beautiful to look at and the dialogue is very poetic.",1400284800,7,171,4.181818181818182
5644703,1,B00BLOYQI6,Nothing about this movie IMHO related to the gay lifestyle and I was confused from the start on that issue alone.  If you like movies about drugs well this would be for you.  Just a sad thing to watch from start to finish.  I mean I thought it was finished.  I know I was finished wasting my time.  BTW why is s*** like this put on as a video on demand but yet other movies that are good and have been out of years not a part of this site?  What is the deal?  If you are worried about torrent sites well I don't have time for sites like that and I just want to see a nice gay movie where it has a happy ending.  Not a hard concept to grasp.,1398729600,10,640,3.7954545454545454
5644704,1,B00BLOYQI6,Sorry excuse for a film. It is filmed in darkness. Hard to see much of picture. I am not sure what the plot was.,1381104000,6,112,3.7083333333333335
8570508,1,B00BLOYQI6,There is nothing enjoyable about this film,1531008000,,42,5.142857142857143
8570509,2,B00BLOYQI6,It was basically Ok. St8 vs. Gay.  I personally would not spend money on this one,1523145600,,81,4.0625
8570510,3,B00BLOYQI6,"I am right in the middle on this one. I see a ton of reviewers that completely hated this film. I definitely get that. I see a few defending this film and I saw what they saw in it too. There aren't tidy explanations for the actions of the characters and if you need character motivation spelled out for you in a story, than this is not for you. I did however think they did a great job with character development and found a lot to like about the two main guys and I wouldn't have minded a longer running time, and maybe not a happy ending, but at least an ending with a glimmer of hope for these two that their lives would get better. Another thing - I did not think the lighting was too dark at all, Some scenes were darker than others, but some of the shots in the night scenes in the woods near the end of movie were breathtaking. But the score in those scenes was pure torture.",1516665600,,883,4.080459770114943
8570511,4,B00BLOYQI6,"Must have to experience a night out in The city of light. Especially, if you're a male and didn't come from lapse of money.",1516665600,,123,4.166666666666667
8570512,4,B00BLOYQI6,"Enjoyable French film that set out to be exactly what it is; a poetic examination of two boys finding out what the world offers them and what it does not. There are no car chases or gun fights, only the feel of what it is to be young, unsure and lonely in the cold universe with all you have is the friendship of a trusted comrade. It is the timeless manifesto of youth everywhere.",1479945600,2,381,4.162162162162162
8570513,1,B00BLOYQI6,What a dud. There is more action and character build up if you fast forward to the last 6 minutes to read the credits.,1457568000,,118,3.9583333333333335
8570514,1,B00BLOYQI6,Rather dull,1436659200,,11,5.0
8570515,1,B00BLOYQI6,couldn't figure out exactly what the film meant or represented. Quite boring actually.,1424822400,,86,5.6923076923076925
8570516,1,B00BLOYQI6,Made absolutely no sense to me.,1419552000,2,31,4.333333333333333
8570517,3,B00BLOYQI6,"Good acting and a poetic sensibility make this worthwhile. It is in French, with English subtitles. I don't think it is meant to be realistic, but this doesn't mean it is not emotionally true. It's atmosphere is closer to that of a 19th-century short story than to present-day film, but that shouldn't stop anyone who wants to watch something thoughtful.",1416441600,,354,4.916666666666667
