6129939,5,B00H3LLDA0,"An honest and thoughtful look at the multi-faceted life of Jeff Jones. I worked with Jeffrey during the production of this film, and at every point it was brought up, he was energetic and supportive of Maria Cabardo's efforts. I appreciate the sincerity behind the project, and while some might be taken aback, misled, turned around and bewildered at THEIR notion of what Jeff Jones was thought to be, no one will leave with less than they started with. It's a refreshing look behind the mind of the artist -- with a support cast who clearly loved Jeff's work and life. And as Jeff's pride and joy stated, ""It's a life worth supporting."" (Julianna Jones Arms)

Thanks, Maria, for pulling an impossible task together, with grace and dignity. We can't wait to see what you do next.",1394841600,,779,4.686131386861314
6129940,5,B00H3LLDA0,"Jeffrey Catherine Jones artwork is beautiful. In this film you see how he hurts while he creates. His family and fellow artists
speak about their time with him. His struggle with his father that did not want his son to be an artist, the struggle with himself wanting to be a woman. It is a very emotional film.",1394841600,4,310,4.362068965517241
6129941,5,B00H3LLDA0,"Jeffrey Catherine Jones left an amazing legacy, artistic creations that continue to enrich our world.  And now filmmaker Mara Paz Cabardo's sensitive documentary brings into focus the unique soul that lived too short a time.",1394668800,,224,5.4
6129942,5,B00H3LLDA0,"In 1976, four men changed comic books forever. For one of them, that change was not enough.

Winner of the World Fantasy Award for best artist 1986, Jones was a painter of fine art and an illustrator who played a major role in developing the comic book and graphic novel industries into what is now a $600 million industry* with a fan base that rabidly consumes the results.

Originally known as Jeff Jones, the artist began gender reassignment in 1997 and later changed her name to Jeffrey Catherine Jones, living as a woman until her death in 2011.

BETTER THINGS features fascinating interviews and commentaries by some of the most famous and influential artists of our time - all speaking about the profound impact and influence of Jeffrey Catherine Jones. It is beautifully shot and produced by Maria Cabardo, a creative designer in her own right. She has weaved an emotional story into an emotional film.

For fans of art, culture, change and of course comic books, this is a film that should be watched (multiple times). It will without doubt change your perspective and increase your inspiration.",1392854400,2,1104,4.8563829787234045
6129943,5,B00H3LLDA0,"As the subject line says, I've seen a screening of this film. It shows the art and life of an amazing artist. Whether you agree with the life choices of Jeffery Cathrine Jones, or not, after watching this documentary you'll find yourself amazed at the passion and talent of this artist. This is the story of someone who had a huge influence on the genre of fantasy art. I left the screening inspired to be more passionate about my own art. In my humble opinion, this is a must watch.",1389312000,5,483,4.377777777777778

6129946,5,B00H3LLDA0,"I have 2 of his collected works and with this documentary which I had been waiting for for some time it completes a more concise idea of the artist. A unique figure and wonderful artist. An influential artist who I think will never get the praise the artist deserves. A sad idea, but the end path of many artists.",1404000000,,313,4.322033898305085
6129947,4,B00H3LLDA0,"As a warts and all biography of an artist this fits the bill. The production values are decent and the editing was very well done. The problem is the film required a bigger budget and wider net. We get to see what the artist endured and created but it feels like there is a lot more to Jeffrey's story (I personally know more went on, at least from conversations with artists and friends close to him).
However, none of this lacking content will affect those who knew little or nothing about the artist and the insights raised here will hopefully appeal to anyone looking for this information in an effort to better understand the person (man or woman depending on how accepting the viewer may be of Jeffrey's embracing of his feminine side). For those who knew Jones this is should more than satisfy their understanding of artist's trials and passions.
All in all, this is a worthy tribute to the life of the artist, Jeffrey Catherine Jones.",1401667200,,942,4.613095238095238
6129948,5,B00H3LLDA0,"I have been a huge fan of Jeff Jones since I first discovered his work in 'The Studio', which I received for my 18th birthday in 1980. Its influence on me and my appreciation of art was profound.
One thing that always fascinated me about Jones was his fascination with and command of the female form and the anguish and sexual ambiguity expressed in his artwork. So it was no real surprise to me when I learnt about his sex change.

All these fascinating aspects of the life of Jeffrey Catherine Jones are delved into in this touching and wonderful portrait; the artwork and the struggle for sexual identity. It makes compelling viewing and I found Jones' candour courageous and moving.
The director/writer is to be highly commended for striking such a delicate balance between the documentary's two main themes; Jones' career and his quest to reconcile his sexuality and gender issues.

The movie is a visual feast; lovingly, lavishly spotlighting a selection of Jones' enormous body of work; clearly showing his mastery, versatility and sensitivity as an artist. The artwork is lush and vibrant, this in stark contrast to Jones' understated but unvarnished descriptions of his struggle with his inner demons, artistic vision, gender issues, death and alcoholism. Jones has experienced the highs and lows of life and this is all expressed in his words and pictures.

Jones complicated relationship with Vaughn Bode was particularly fascinating, and warrants a documentary of its own. I also love the anecdotes about the Studio and it was wonderful seeing two of my all-time artistic heroes; Berni Wrightson and Mike Kaluta getting so much screen time. Wrightson was more verbose and garrulous than I had expected and Kaluta more curmudgeonly with an infectious twinkle in his eyes. A pity Barry Smith (apparently) declined to comment. I was also very moved by Louise Simonson's honesty. It must've been very hard for her to discuss her complex relationship with Jones. Vaughn Bode's son, Mark, also added a certain emotional frisson to the film.  The music perfectly complimented the narrative, underscoring the sentiments at play, and enhancing the visuals.

My only quibble is the inclusion of some of the interviewees like Will Simpson, Paul Pope (as eloquent as he was), Mark Carbonaro, Roger Dean and other names that escape me. Some of them seemed gratuitous and superfluous and it wasn't immediately obvious what their connection to Jones was or in what capacity they were speaking. I would've much preferred to hear more from the aforementioned Wrightson and Kaluta, as well as the mellifluous Neil Gaiman,  Bill Sienkiewicz and Mike Mignola, whose credentials for talking about Jones are abundantly clear. It also might've been nice to hear from people like Jon Jay Muth, George Pratt and Kent Williams because of the clear influence Jones had on them as artists.

Playing time is a mere 82 minutes and it never drags for a second. Needless to say, it could've run at least another 38 minutes.
It would also have been nice if they could've included an extra feature focussed solely on the artwork with musical accompaniment.",1400544000,,3134,5.038610038610039
6129949,5,B00H3LLDA0,"For anyone who loved the artwork of Jeffrey Jones, this film is the perfect tribute to his work. I had the opportunity to exhibit art with him and work with him briefly on a book project although it was long distance so I never got the chance to meet him in person. Still, it was a great experience corresponding with him and getting an autographed book from him as a gift. A great talent whose life was cut way too short. Jeffrey has now joined the other greats who have passed such as Frank Frazetta, Vaughn Bode, Moebius, John Berkey, Joe Kubert, Frank Kelly Freas, Leo Dillon, Jack Kirby and more. He/she will be sorely missed here on earth, but somewhere on the other side, there's one helluva party going on.",1398384000,,714,4.458015267175573
6129950,5,B00H3LLDA0,"I loved hearing about Jeffery Jones' life told from the perspective of his family and friends, and how the stories wove together to tell a larger story. I think every artist struggles with some level of demons, and it's part of what can make their art so great. This was a very honest look at a man's struggle but told in a very sensitive way.",1396569600,,343,4.292307692307692
6129951,5,B00H3LLDA0,"To understand the history of illustrators and their art.
An amazing film with commentary from renowned artist and illustrators.
This is a historical find! Thank you for this treasure.",1395446400,,183,5.344827586206897
6129952,5,B00H3LLDA0,"I've already watched it twice, and plan on seeing it again as soon as possible.  Jones is talked about for a lot of reasons these days, and lots of people like myself certainly remember Frank Frazetta for years saying Jones was the best living artist.

Without the release valve of Fantasy, Horror and Science Fiction, life would be difficult-to-impossible for so many of us - Jeffery Catherine Jones' story shines a light on this darker side of Fantasy and treads ground that no other art doc I've seen treads.  In many ways the notion of accepting ourselves is present in BETTER THINGS, and the stories of Jones' talent and hardships paint a nearly impossible, extremely beautiful metaphor for us.

At the core of the movie is the story behind THE STUDIO artists ... ANY FAN OF 70s COMICS will really flip out here!  One of the greatest Comics stories I've never heard by far!",1395360000,,878,4.675324675324675

8629473,3,B00H3LLDA0,"I bought this film as she is my favorite artist of the genre and in that ... I left it with feeling flat. Even in the documentary about Waterson who is not actually in the documentary ... it feels full and rounded. As ones who come into the same with Jones ... and she being in the film ... It felt ... like rain. I will watch it again. I feel disappointment in it. Perhaps, it was in how it ended ... it felt separated and . ... a critique of her choices and that bringing about her death. Sometimes grief ... loss ... comes out sideways. She was and is ... a flawed and beautiful human. Like all of us.",1483142400,,604,4.0
8629474,5,B00H3LLDA0,"When I was around 24 or so, I asked Jefferey Jones, at a convention, if I could please visit him one day -as he had made such a profound statement on me and my art. He looked a bit sad, but agreed. I worried he might be inconvenienced so I followed up with a phone call, just to make sure, luckily he was up to it, and I was able to stay with him one weekend at his home in Woodstock. Once I was able to spend more time with him, I realized it was not a reflection on me /his sadness, but a cloak of personal melancholy that had him completely wrapped. I tried to stay upbeat and cheerful, but felt badly, that I could do little to help one of my greatest hero's escape it's tangles.
We spoke or art, and his love of the masters, We visited Berni Wrightson, and his newly built studio, I watched him ink an mage page , his current strip at heavy Metal at the time, with a beautifully fluid penmanship .He did a painting for me, from scratch, explaining his process throughout, an effortlessness that was remarkable, and a openness to share, even more so. And at night after lots of beer, I slept in a room, surrounded by a trove of his original oils, which naturally, I stayed up until each morning studying.
On the second night, I asked if he still had COLD CUTS, a black and white story done for warren, when he handed me that to look over/study for the night, it became one of the happiest moments in my young artistic life, matched only by sitting at John Buscema's kitchen table, eating a tuna salad sandwich and having him, show me how to really draw (but that's another story). This film, is, to me, heartbreaking, as It brought back to me the feeling of helplessness that filled our space those two days and nights. The film does clarify it,and I think sheds light on Jefferey/Catherine's person and his/her personal demons. I just wish, perhaps, it could have been done sooner, maybe at a time earlier in his life to help him/her.
But things take time,change and acceptance is not an easy lesson for mankind. Regardless, the artwork he created has enriched us all, and continues to inspire with a depth of sensitivity that tells us volumes about the human soul. Thank you, for this film, and sharing this remarkable human with us.",1470441600,,2239,4.384615384615385
8629475,5,B00H3LLDA0,"I bought this dvd with certain amount of pause-- See one of my favorite art books is The Studio(which I've owned for over 30 years and had the good luck to have autographed by all four artists--Jeffrey Catherine  Jones was somewhat of an enigma in that as great of artist she was there was not alot of personal information out there about her-I had just bought The Art Of Jeffrey Jones and saw this dvd (and the price was right) so I fihured why not-- I watched it and I can give it a very strong recomendation -It moves right along and features interviews with most of the people you'd want to hear from(Loise Jones Simonson, Juliana(their daughter),Michael Kaluta, Bernie Wrightson and a lot of other premier artists-Mignola,Sienkiewicz,Chiarello Guay,McKean, and Moebuis as well as others offer their insights.

8629476,5,B00H3LLDA0,A respectful and heartfelt documentary on a legendary artist who shaped the minds of a generation of fantasy artists.

Just because she did not choose to come out and live as a woman until a much later ager in life does not mean you can ignore that coming out. Completely disrespectful.",1428192000,,274,4.612244897959184

8629481,5,B00H3LLDA0,"What is there that hasn't already been said about this remarkable glimpse into the formerly very private life of Jeffrey Catherine Jones? A man, a visionary artist, a life wrought with many challenges, mostly personal but some professional as well. Director Maria Cabardo has managed to reveal the artist in a very honest portrait of the man behind the art, through Jeff's own words. This is not some hi-gloss hollywood re-imagining of an icon, but instead the true nuts and bolts life-story of a man who fought the odds to become one of fantasy arts greatest, all the while battling his personal demons.

The film is based around Maria's revelatory interviews with Jeffrey which all took place shortly before he passed, along with those of his closest friends and family, looking back over his life and achievements. Through Maria's lens, you get a clear picture of what his life must have been like, all the highs and lows that came with becoming one of the most sought-after painters of his day. The film also delves into his decision in his later days for gender reassignment, fulfilling the feeling that he was always meant to be a woman. All in all, a very touching and personal portrait of one of my, and many others, favorite artists.",1416873600,,1242,4.776744186046511
