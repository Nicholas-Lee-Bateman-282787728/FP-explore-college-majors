8083695,5,B000B8IAK8,"PRIDE Bushido was a sub-event of PRIDE FC. The first few events focused on a team concept, almost like the IFL. The later events became the outlet for the organization's lighter weight fighters (185 and 170). Here, we are treated to Team Japan vs. Team Chute Box/Wanderlei. There are a few slower matches, but there's only one that gets anywhere close to pure lay-and-pray. It's a good night of fights, however, there is a box set with the first three Bushidos available for under $20 on Amazon. Get it instead, as it's a better value.",1280620800,,535,4.6421052631578945

BUSHIDO VOL 2

Pride Fighting Championship is probably my favorite MMA Company of all time, sure the company is not around any more but the DVD's live on. The first Bushido was a huge success with the Team Gracie vs Team Japan concept so they came back with the second one featuring Team Japan vs Team Chute Box. For those who don't know Bushido means ""way of the warrior"", that is the translation from Japanese.

1. YUSUKE IMAMURA VS MU BAE CHOI-the first round starts out nice with Mu Bae executing a suplex and ends up in the half guard. The fight lasts a little longer but once he gets Imamura's back he sinks in a rear naked choke. 4/5

2. RYUTA SAKURAI VS YUSHIN OKAMI-the first round is outstanding as these two warriors go at it, full of action from the start to the literal end of the round. There is some great stand up and some excellent ground and pound, and to top it off there are some great submission attempts. The second round is pretty much controlled by Okami both on the feet and on the ground, this was a good round but Okami pulls out the victory. 4/5

3. YASUHITO NAMEKAWA VS EGIDIJUS VALAVICIUS-this fight does not last very long, in fact the feeling out process seemed longer than the action. After a take down Namekawa locks in a tight guillotine choke and takes the fight. 5/5

4. SEAN SHERK VS RYUKI UEYAMA-this was Sherk's Pride debut and it is always interesting to see what Sherk can do. The fight starts out with a great take down by Sherk followed a little later by a vicious slam were Sherk starts to control the ground game. Sherk dominates for most of the round but Ryuki does not give in and continues to reverse things. We get a second hard slam courtesy of Sherk, and both trade submissions. The second round looks just like the first with a lot of great action and passes from the guard and such. Sherk dominated this fight for the most part and took the victory. 5/5

 5. MARIO SPERRY VS MIKE BENCIC-this one is only something like 11 seconds of the first round, this is a very quick fight. They come out swinging and Sperry throws one that lands right on the button, man what a quick fight. 5/5

6. CHRIS BRENNAN VS DAIJU TAKASE-Brennan is returning after winning at the first Bushido, you may remember that controversial fight. Daiju comes out hard and takes down Chris and controls the entire round as these two play chess on the ground. Also Daiju puts Chris in one of the craziest triangle chokes I have seen. The second round looks much like the first with Daiju controlling the fight the entire time on the ground, at one point it looked as if Chris was going to tap. Daiju takes this one with a unanimous judge scoreing. 4/5

7. RODRIGO GRACIE VS HAYATO SAKURAI-after a very funny interview with Rodrigo, Ryan, and Renzo Gracie conducted by Bas Rutten we get to the only Gracie fight on the card. The first round is kinda a back and forth battle with neither man looking overly impressive, Rodrigo gets the slight advantage in my mind but both were very well matched up. The second round is much like the first with Gracie getting the slight advantage because he seemed a little more aggressive, Gracie gets the victory. 4/5

8. MIRKO ""CRO COP"" FILIPOVIC VS YOSHIHISA YAMAMOTO-Yoshihisa takes some hard leg kicks to his leg, he takes all of them with a smile. It turned out to be a bad idea because he takes some vicious soccer kicks to his head when he is one the ground, and as soon as he stands up Cro Cop lays him out with some heavy hands. 5/5

9. JADSON COSTA VS TAKANORI GOMI-the first fight in the Team Japan vs Team Shoot Box best of three series, Costa wants the win but he is up against Gomi a very tough fighter. The fight does not go out of the first round as Gomi completely dominates Costa getting the mount and pounding on Costa until the ref steps in to stop it. Impressive win for Gomi on this one, Team Japan takes the first fight. 5/5

10. MAURICIO ""SHOGUN"" RUA VS AKIHIRO GONO-Shogun for those who do not know is the guy that just recently defeated Chuck Liddell in the first round of their fight in the UFC. The first round is basically a kick boxing match with some great Mauy Thai clinches and knees added, that is of course aside from a few take downs. Then with one minute left in the round [after 9 minutes] Shogun takes him out with some punches and a great soccer kick, that ties the score 1 to 1.4.5/5

11. WANDERLEI SILVA VS IKUHISH MINOWA-the main event would be the one to settle the score and give victory to their team. This fight does not last long at all because once Minowa pulls guard Silva knocks him out from the guard. This gives the victory to Chute Box and for the second time Team Japan losses, also Renzo Gracie is the guest on the commentary. 5/5

This was a great event and just as good as the first and some could say it was a better event. To me I love them both so I think both are great, I recommend buying this one and in fact you can get the first three Bushido's in a box set.",1242691200,,4989,4.32762312633833

8083698,4,B000B8IAK8,"This was the second volume of a continuing series of great Pride: Bushido events. The theme of Bushido in the beginning was pitting one fight team against another with rules more geared towards excitement and constant progression to finish. While the latter hasn't changed, it has become a great show in which to give the greatest welterweight and especially lightweight fighters around the world a chance to show their skills.

This particular card's theme was that of Team Japan vs Team Chute Boxe. Chute Boxe is one of two top Brazilian fight teams that are arguably the best in the world. They are very good strikers primarily that are very multi-dimensional, and love stomping and ""soccer kicking"" downed opponents. They hardly ever stop fighting, have incredible stamina, and are some of the most exciting fighters in the world. Most Japanese fighters tend to prefer the ground game, using submission tactics and being very technical, etc. Most of them never give up and have great heart.

Overall, I found this event to be very decent and entertaining. I do however feel there were a few mismatches. Specifically Mirko ""Crocop"" Filipovic vs Yoshihisa Yamamoto, Wanderlei ""The Axe Murderer"" Silva vs Ikuhisa Minowa,Takanori ""Fireball Kid"" Gomi vs Jadson Costa, and Mario ""Zen Machine"" Sperry vs Mike ""Batman"" Bencic. Although it did also have it's share of very competitive matches as well. The card had some great debuts from some popular fighters in smaller organisations in Japan such as Yushin Okami, Ryuta Sakurai, Ryuki Ueyama, the very tough Akihiro Gono, and of course the top Lightweight fighter in the world currently, Takanori Gomi.

If you're not familiar with Gomi, he's currently undefeated in Pride, and has been on a roll since he got there. Racking up 9 consecutive wins so far. He comes from a judo background but wrestling and boxing are his specialty. He likes to mix it up with the best of them standing, but doesn't mind going to the ground and instituting his great ground and pound. His only two losses in his whole career come from Joachim Hansen and BJ Penn, two other great fighters.

If you're already a fan of Mixed Martial Arts and especially Chute Boxe, I'm sure there's no doubt this is already in your collection. But if you want a decent fighting event with some guys getting destroyed don't hesitate to pick this up. This dvd is worth it just for Gono vs Shogun alone in my opinion. A very exciting fight.",1128556800,6,2446,4.872596153846154
