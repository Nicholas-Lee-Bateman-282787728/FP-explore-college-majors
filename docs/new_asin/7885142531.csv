1123899,5,7885142531,"With recent heaters like The Ip Man Series, Kill Zone, Dragon Tiger Gate, Flashpoint, Seven Swords, and 14 Blades on his resume, Donnie Yen has finally made it. This sequel to Bruce Lee's classic Fist Of Fury (The Chinese Connection) or Donnie's Fist Of Fury films (depending on how you look at it) is brilliant. It's a classic Kung Fu movie, a super hero flick, a love story, and a war epic all rolled up in one with a great cast including Shu Qi, Shawn Yue, The Great Anthony Wong, and Yasuaki Kurata. Seven years after his alleged death, Chen Zhen returns to champion his fellow Chinese in 1920's Shanghai during The Japanese Oppression.  He conveniently finds a Kato uniform that fits him perfectly and becomes a one man wrecking crew....again. After seeing Donnie in the Kato suit and remembering Jet Li in Black Mask, I'm not all that excited about Jay Chou in the upcoming Green Hornet film. I'll see it and return with an honest review but I'm not expecting much. As long as Hong Kong continues to show him love, Donnie Yen may never have to headline a Hollywood vehicle. I take that back. I definitely want to see him team up with Michael Jai White (who doesn't make enough Martial Arts films) and Scott Adkins (who is severely underrated) in a huge, big cast, MMA movie. In the meantime, I'll just wait to see what the new king hits us with next.",1293840000,18,1356,4.512195121951219
1123900,5,7885142531,"Donnie Yen must be having the best year of his life. First the IP MAN series, then this gem of a martial arts flick. Thoroughly enjoyable for any fan of martial arts. This DVD is great. I am referring to this exact one on Amazon, exactly as it is pictured. There are a bunch of poor quality bootlegs floating around and I was victim to two of them before buying this DVD. This one is top notch with a super sharp anamorphic picture and even had english subtitled special features including a documentary on the making of the film.",1292544000,3,530,4.363636363636363
1123901,5,7885142531,"If you like Ip Man, like I did, you will like this movie. Period. I didn't realize it at the time, but this is a sort-of remake of Bruce Lee's FIST OF FURY which Jet Li already remade as ""FIST OF LEGEND"". No surprise, I liked all three of these movies, all done by true martial arts masters. This DVD is fantastic. Excellent picture quality, clear, accurate subtitles, and special features. You can't go wrong with this purchase. I hear this will be released in USA theaters in 2011, and that it might be cut. This DVD is apparently uncut as I compared the running time with the running time in IMDB.",1292544000,20,600,4.366071428571429
1124018,3,7885142531,"The writing kind of sucks and the choreography isn't amazing either.  As a Donnie Yen fan, I was let down a little.  In my opinion, it's not worthy of Donnie Yen or the other actors that played in it.  After watching Ip Man and other great Martial Arts films, it just doesn't compare.

My standards are high but that is my honest opinion.",1377820800,,338,4.317460317460317

1124020,5,7885142531,all of this guy's movies are great. he is a very good martial artist. I would definitely recommend this. great.,1370995200,,111,4.6
1124021,3,7885142531,If you are a fan of Donny Yen then this is a must see. The story starts out during World War I and transitions back to China. The Chinese are in the middle of the Japanese & British occupation. Nice period piece along with the costumes. Although the costume is sort of  a take off the Kato character (played by Bruce Lee) in the Green Hornet series; I thought it was still a little interesting. I don't know what the creators intention was using the suit. But in my opinion Donny could have pulled off the role without the Kato reference. All in all I thought the movie was entertaining.,1325030400,,587,4.336363636363636
1124022,5,7885142531,"The action sequences alone are worth watching this movie. Donnie Yen is superb as an action director, and Bruce Lee fans will enjoy the realism of the fighting.

There is very limited wire work here--Donnie's trademark style is speed and contact. The making of is extraordinary as you get to see how Donnie works. His abilities are amazing, though there is some use of camera speed to accentuate the impact. The flying kicks are trademark beautiful--what you've come to expect from Yen Sifu. For an epic film noir/comic book super hero type of movie, Chen Zhen is a whole lot of fun.

This is NOT the wire-fu of Hero, and not the Wing Chun of Ip Man, this is more like Mixed Martial Arts with Taekwondo, Jui Jitzu, and boxing thrown in. All of the essential Chen Zhen is there, thumbs down to the Japanese CO, nunchaku, Bruce Lee war cries, mandarin suit, plus you get to sample some of Donnie's real piano playing skills, and some kung fu humor as he chases down the bad guys.

MMA, Kung Fu, and Comic book movie lovers will enjoy this film!",1318118400,,1042,4.502645502645502
1124023,3,7885142531,"After having recently watched Ip Man and Ip Man 2, I was disappointed in the quality of the fight scenes in this.  Donnie is of course a great fighter, but I don't watch these movies to see him ""ground and pound"" or ""wall and pound"" people.  I watch them for good kung fu.  Not to say there aren't good fight scenes - there are - particularly in the library.  I also found the plotting pretty confusing, again not up to the caliber of his other recent movies.",1315267200,,459,4.241379310344827
1124024,1,7885142531,"Had to watch this several times because I fell asleep I was so bored. Sad to see a talent imitate another actor, it was sad, form sound effects to actions his final fight is a flat out Bruce Lee imitation. From angles to moves it is a recreation of Bruce's fight as Chen Zhen, Jet Li made it his own in Fist of Legend, if I wanted to watch bruce I would but lets face it, his movies are dated and do not truely hold up well to modern films, why recreate it.",1311206400,3,457,3.924731182795699
1124025,3,7885142531,"the vendor hadn't sent me yet another defective DVD
very frustrating to get through most of the movie
only to not be able to watch last 30 minutes or so

1124026,5,7885142531,"Just have to agree with the other reviewers, this one awesome flick and one gorgeous looking DVD (for dvd). Was hesitant when I heard this will be out in the states on blu ray in June...glad I couldn't wait. Besides loving this movie (big fan of Donnie Yen), since seeing the trailer on The Man from Nowhere blu ray (another awesome movie and transfer), I knew I would enjoy this movie. Boy, that was an understatement! This has got to be one of the best foreign films I have seen in years. If you liked the US version of Seth Rogans Green Hornet, you will enjoy this import....it is FAR superior! Why didn't the makers of Green Hornet watch this first? Subtitles and all, this movie and DVD rocks! The anamorphic 2.35 video is amazing for dvd. The soundtrack really rocks on the DTS soundtrack. This particular version is region free and should play on any dvd player here in the states. Got this at a great price too. Cannot wait to rebuy this movie on blu ray in June. Lookin forward to the next Donnie Yen movie I can get a hold of...it may be hard to top this one! Donnie just reestablished himself as the greater HK action star.",1300060800,2,1134,4.37914691943128
1124027,4,7885142531,"Donnie Yen returns as Chen Zhen in what could be deemed a sequel to Bruce Lee's ""Fist of Fury"" aka ""Chinese Connection"" (1972), Jet Li's ""Fist of Legend"" (1994), or Yen's own ""Fist of Fury"" Chinese television series, from 1995.  Or perhaps even the 3rd film following Yuen Woo Ping's ""Legend of a Fighter"" (1982) or Jet Li's ""Fearless"" (2006). Luckily the movie's much easier to sort out than my explanation of the work that sequentially preceded it! ALL are great films but none are necessary to view prior to this.

The film starts out in France at the end of WW1. I don't recall how much time elapses between then and when Chen Zhen returns home but I didn't think that Japan entered China until 1931, though the gap was probably explained and I missed it.  He joins a group of rebels and, under the pseudonym of a deceased comrade, becomes part owner of a large night club run by Chinese fat-cats who plan to profit from war, civil or otherwise. In preventing an attack on a Chinese military general, Chen Zhen dons the costume of a movie hero (Kato, Zorro, Black Mask, you pick) and saves the man's life.  The Japanese are outraged and try to find the culprit.  In the meantime he is also romancing the club's singer (Shu Qi, ""The Transporter"", ""Gorgeous"") who may have ulterior motives of her own.

The fights: I try to be as objective as possible, but it's Donnie Yen's own words that I am basing my rating on: he notoriously (and justifiably) ripped apart poorly edited, wire-laden fight scenes a few years ago during the height of his ""S.P.L./Flash Point"" era and prides himself on choreographing better scenes, which he most certainly has done, and in many other titles than the two just mentioned.  Do the fights in this suck?  Absolutely not!  However they are a noticeable step down from the work he has done in the last half-decade under director Wilson Yip.  Here Yen's wire-work is better than most of Yuen Woo Ping's (whose choreography I love but have grown increasingly tired of) but not as good as his own ""Dragon Tiger Gate"".  The editing is also overly choppy, which is not to say it's awful, but we all know that Yen is capable of much better stuff. He IS credited here as action director.

Overall this is an enjoyable film with good enough fights to please most martial arts movie fans and I'm sure I'll watch it multiple times.  If I had a non-fight gripe it would have to be about the absence of the great Yasuaki Kurata who is credited but barely glimpsed at all.  The overall theme seems to be that the Japanese military, prior to (and during) WW2, were complete jerks.  That's what I came away with though I did watch this the same day as ""Black Belt"" (2007), and was likely biased.  I certainly don't think Yen felt that way in ""Ip Man"", lol.

The picture quality on this Media Asia release is widescreen and excellent.  The ""making of"" segment is quite extensive and features Yen on piano, enthusiastically jamming Scott Joplin tunes between takes.  In Cantonese or Mandarin with removable English subtitles.
