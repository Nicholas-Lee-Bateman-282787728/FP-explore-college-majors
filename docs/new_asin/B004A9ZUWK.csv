4305821,5,B004A9ZUWK,"I purchased both the video and book at the same time and have found them to be very instructional and easy to follow.  What McLean  teaches makes a lot of sense concerning the golf swing.  This is not a ""beginners"" instructional series, but a guide to help a person who is an accomplished golfer improve their swing.",1329782400,6,316,4.508771929824562
4305822,5,B004A9ZUWK,"As a beginner, this DVD has helped me a lot to correct my swing. Whenever I need some steps, I watch them and practice. Recommend this DVD for golfers who would like to correct their swing.
I wish I would like to buy a good DVD for short game DVD.",1300924800,5,247,3.96
4305823,5,B004A9ZUWK,"I purchased Jim McLean's book, The Eight-Step Swing, about two weeks ago and read it cover to cover three times. This video covers every important aspect covered in the book! In my opinion, if you will study the full golf swing, piece by piece, as McLean breaks it down here, you will jump light years ahead in your quest for a repeatable, powerful swing! At each of the eight steps presented in this video, just as with the book, McLean gives you drills that not only ingrain the proper motion but give you valuable checks on yourself to make sure that you are in the proper position and balanced.

For me, several subtle concepts derived from the book and the DVD have made a tremendous difference in my club head speed and squaring of the face at impact, namely seeing the same number of knuckles on your forward hand at Steps 2 and 3 as you see at your setup, and the concept of feeling your weight transfer to the TOP of your right foot (not the outside) on the backswing.

Before discovering McLean's material, I had devoted a full month of intense practice to the Stack and Tilt Method, which had a few pluses but had the major drawbacks of robbing me of swing speed and making my right sacroiliac joint sore. I took several weeks off, during which time I read Jim McLean's book, The Slot Swing. After getting Stack and Tilt out of my system and applying the principles talked about in The Slot Swing, my driver speed increased from a steady 89 mph where I had been stuck with Stack and Tilt, up to a steady 108 mph with The Slot Swing. After several weeks of applying the information contained in the book, The Eight-Step Swing, which is fully covered in this DVD, I have bumped my driver speed up to a consistent 120 mph, with about 7 out of 10 drives dead straight, the others mostly draws. I hit my first 300 yard drive at the range a couple of days ago, and I fully credit Jim McLean's wonderful teaching with my progress and newly found confidence that my most accurate shot will come from delivering maximum power down through ""the slot"" to the ball.

Methodically following the steps in McLean's Eight-Step Swing will have you naturally delivering the club head down through ""the slot"", but I highly recommend reading ""The Slot Swing"" as well. As for the quality of the video, it isn't divided into chapters with a menu, but of course, each step is introduced separately in the video itself. Skipping to the next section with my DVD player advances it in 10-minute increments, but you can find your way around quickly enough. The video and audio quality are excellent! For the full swing, this is THE BEST video instruction, bar none! Highly recommended!",1299024000,16,2669,4.544698544698544
4305844,3,B004A9ZUWK,"I red all the comments before made the order for this DVD and the book. There are no special tricks or drills, all are the fundamental basics. So do not have too high expectations",1375574400,,179,4.294117647058823
4305845,4,B004A9ZUWK,"This is an older version of Jim McLean's 8 step swing, but the basic fundamentals are the same.  Includes some practice drills.",1374451200,,127,4.7727272727272725
4305846,5,B004A9ZUWK,"Really like Jim's outlook on the golf swing!  He lets you be comfortable with your personal swing while breaking down a few fundamentals that you can practice at home or on the range.  Overall, the drills are the key and he also lays out the death moves that will hurt anyone's swing.",1367884800,2,284,4.4423076923076925
4305847,3,B004A9ZUWK,"I expected quite more from this video, was it taken in the early 80's? He dose not even show a shot after he gives instructions.",1367798400,,128,4.16
4305848,3,B004A9ZUWK,"Like so many books, take the sawdust out and you have a good pamphlet. Jim goes into too much detail and it gets one confused. Would be better if he were to do a set up where the viewer could go directly to the 'chapter' he finds most appropriate to his needs. Get the book - The Slot Swing.",1365811200,,291,3.9491525423728815
4305849,5,B004A9ZUWK,"loved all 3 purchases.

8419858,1,B004A9ZUWK,"I have read 75+ books and watched 50+ videos on golf instruction. This is by far the worst video (and companion book)I've purchased.

My biggest issue with this specific video (and companion book) is McLean tries to teach a golf swing by emphasizing what NOT to do. The absolute worst way to teach (and learn) new skills.

I don't even like having them in my collection.  I may donate it to my local library.",1406332800,,408,4.486486486486487

8419861,3,B004A9ZUWK,This CD is really for a beginner in golf. I don't think it reinforces anything nor did I learn anything. I don't recommend this CD to anybody except a Beginner.,1380412800,,160,4.366666666666666
8419862,5,B004A9ZUWK,"This is a great summary of Jim's teaching - everything in a nutshell. This is a wonderful mid-season adjunct or reminder to his 8 DVD series ""The Building Block Approach"". Same eight steps but the 8 DVD set breaks each section down into greater detail. This DVD with the other set is a complete program to build and tune your full swing.",1376611200,,337,4.451612903225806
