8004884,5,B0000ZG03G,"This series may be the most underrated Saturday morning cartoon ever released.  Part of the problem is that the target audience is those afflicted with male juvenile humor.  This wound up excluding many of those who normally watch Saturday morning cartoons, and preventing it from being seen by those who might most enjoy it (I know for a fact that I liked the cartoon more than my son).

Unfortunately, it looks like Fox has given up on putting out DVDs, which is shame.  I'd pay top Anime dollar for a couple season sets of this excellent cartoon.",1108080000,10,549,4.628865979381444
