8593505,5,B000FGFS3I,"I'm a housewife and I bought this movie so that I could fix my own toilet on my own and boy has it helped!  After watching it, I can literally fix anything!  I didn't even know what half the toilet parts were before watching it.  Now I'm pretty much an expert.

I bought it because my toilet was running and I wanted to fix it.  I never would've thought it was so easy to get rid of than annoying running and water wasting.

If you want to know how to fix your toilet EASILY, Buy This DVD!  Super Good.  Pretty dang fast shipping too!",1147132800,5,534,4.0673076923076925
