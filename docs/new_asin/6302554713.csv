The story could easily have been made into a mini series, or a TV series today, but was squeezed into the popular 120 minute format of dramas in the early 90's.

481652,2,6302554713,"This movie wasn't completely horrible, but was so disjointed that sometimes I wasn't quite sure what was going on. It gives some great insight into to drug culture and the drug lifestyle, but also some really dumb ideas that clearly were put in without consulting any that truly lived in the drug lifestyle. One of the biggest reasons we watched this was because my wife remembered that ""Tears in Heaven"" was from the soundtrack. It was in the movie, but so out of place. The movie takes place in the mid 70's and plays 70's rock throughout, then hits you with a random 30 seconds of ""Tears in Heaven"". I'm still trying to figure that one out. The actors were great and I'm a big Sam Elliott fan anyway, so I gave it the 2 start for that.",1472860800,,738,4.355072463768116

Greg Alman was a great understated bad guy & fit the story well. I never would have glanced on this ignored movie but for the cast. It was well balanced between the fine line of who is the REAL bad guy, & what is the real truth that was really the reality in that period of time. Criminals of one sort trying to take out competition or bolster political ambitions with false tactics & stirring up the naive black & white thinking of the day. I would have liked to see the same movie more fleshed out with a strong director who gets the ""drug war"". one of these days someone will make a movie about that farce and who really benefits from both all the sides of the industly.

I think Rush and 1989's Drugstore Cowboy are the best depictions of the Do Drugs, nod off, Do More Drugs, Repeat lifestyle that films have to offer. Interestingly, Max Perlich was in
both and I think he did terrific work in both. Definitely tough stuff that will affect viewers no matter what level of involvement in hard drugs they've had, including none at all.",1438646400,3,479,4.647058823529412

481891,2,6302554713,"Rush is a great example of a good plot concept that is simply not executed very well. I like the idea of 2 undercover narcotics cops who find themselves slowly falling too deep into their roles. It's an interesting idea and it can make for a really strong tale if it's done right. The problem is they didn't have a good story arc to carry 2 hours of film. The entire plot is literally as simple as 2 cops trying to buy drugs from a bunch of dealers, and in the process taking too many themselves. That's it, but they drag it out with scene after scene of the same stuff. I can't even count the number of times we see the 2 main characters making a deal and then nervously being forced to take the drugs to prove they aren't cops. It's so repetitive that over time the intensity and danger of what they are doing is utterly lost. It's also strange because we get very few gradual decline scenes from Jason Patric and Jennifer Jason Leigh. It's as if they have a handle on things and then 2 scenes later they are digging in the carpet searching for more coke.

The acting has moments of high quality, but it starts to feel a bit too showy and artificial when they are struggling with addiction. The collection of drug dealers and assorted thugs are decently cast, but we never see anyone suffer the wrath of these guys so they almost become lovable instead of scary. That might be the biggest sin of this movie (aside from the dull pacing.) So many of the situations are treated like life-or-death struggles, but since no one dies, all the teeth are taken out of the villains. I could go on, but there isn't much more to say. Simply put we have a story that is worth telling but it could have been more effective if they worked out some of the kinks and cut back the runtime. I definitely didn't hate Rush but it's lacking anything to set it apart from other police dramas, and drug-use dramas that have the same themes but execute them more effectively.",1432944000,3,1952,4.347945205479452

Their superior is played by the always superb Sam Elliot. The partners must infiltrate the local drug scene in order to bring down a suspected drug lord, (Gregg Allman). Leigh realizes she may be over her head as she starts to fall for Patric and is slowly drawn into the dark side of being a narcotics agent.  Jason Patric has already been enveloped by the drug scene and the two try to help each other get clean and finish the literally impossible job of apprehending Allman using whatever measures possible, no matter how unethical and dangerous they may be. The performances by Leigh and Patric are intense and thoroughly believable.

Meanwhile, they become addicted to drugs while trying to blend in with the drug culture while trying to carry out their mission as cops. All of the physical evidence they collect winds up being consumed. In the end, Leigh's integrity as a person ultimately frees Allman, who can't believe that Leigh didn't try to alter evidence, etc. This movie gives a realistic account of 70's life in the south in the face of adversity. The suspense and drama builds throughout the movie, as a number of people lose their internal battles, and succumb to their demons.

482121,2,6302554713,"I finally saw this movie 17 years after it's initial release.  I remember at the time it came out, it was lauded as a groundbreaking film for it's brutal honesty.  I can certainly see, given the aesthetics of hollywood at the time, why many people saw this movie as a milestone in the drugs crime genre.  I consider myself a well versed film buff, so I have full confidence when I say that this film doesn't hold up, compared to even older films such as The French Connection, or The Godfather.  I'm also a fan of The Wire.  Now, some might argue comparing The Wire to Rush is ridiculous, but it does show the progression of how drugs and corruption are depicted aesthetically in film.  Rush for it's time was groundbreaking, and I do praise someone had the guts to push the envelope at the time, but I believe our tastes as the audience have matured, and with shows like The Wire, it's hard to go back and watch a film like this and accept it without cringing at a few things.  For one, I found Gregg Allman's character completely one dimensional and hollow.  For most of the film it appears Gregg Allman and Jason Patric are checking each other out, as if they were potential gay lovers sizing each other up.  It just took me out of the movie.  Gregg Allman was just silly, walking around in that leather trench coat.  I kept thinking, ""Jesus Gregg, stop this horrible acting and go play a guitar, you douche.""  There were also plenty of melodramatic moments that just made my eyes roll.  One scene involves an exchange between Sam Elliot, who plays the police chief, and Jennifer Jason Leigh, when she's just getting assigned as Jason Patric's partner and there's the cliche dialogue about how ugly this world is and how ugly it will make her.  I thought, really?  You would think she would have had an idea about that when she applied to be a police officer, nevermind an undercover narc.  I'm not saying that kind of stuff doesn't happen, but please, play down the cliches and melodrama.  Also the film is fairly predictable.  I knew once Jason Patric had his eyes on Jennifer Jason Leigh's character, that he would buy it in the end.  She would get addicted to drugs, clean up, then save her partner from addiction, and after her partner buying it, she would have a revelation (because a major leading character, can never go through a cliche film without being changed on some level, physically and morally and then change their tune) and she would stand up for justice and the american way, but somehow still get the drop on Gregg Allman.  For a real complex, riveting and educational drama about drugs and corruption, check out The Wire.  I'm not saying don't watch Rush.  Watch it, then watch The Wire, then watch Rush again, and you'll see what I'm talking about.",1221177600,,2774,4.561616161616161

It's the true first-person story of a female police officer in Texas who went undercover to catch drug dealers and eventually became addicted to drugs herself.  I thought the book was good.  This 1991 film is a remake of that story and stars Jennifer Jason Leigh..

The storyline shows the young idealistic cop being slowly convinced by her partner, Jason Patric, that they would have to do drugs in order to make drug dealers trust them.  Eventually, she and Patric not only become seriously addicted, they also get involved in a romance.  The viewer knows that no good will come of this.  The viewer is right.

The roles are difficult but the actors did their jobs well.  I really believed they were addicted and felt sorry for their predicament.  Their commanding officer, Sam Elliott, knew what was going on but looked the other way because they kept making arrests.  And their world was so infested with drugs that it became impossible to resist.

Because I had read the book, I knew how the story would turn out and this made the film seem a little slow. It could have been edited better.

The only distinction between the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"" are their intentions, which become blurred and distorted by drug addiction.
The bond between the two police officers is very moving, yet tragic. This true story will stun you, as you watch to see what happens from scene to scene, waiting for the next teardrop to fall.",1051315200,2,496,4.847058823529411
482204,4,6302554713,"First off, any film with Gregg Allman as the villain you can count me in for. Allman does a servicable job as the local bar owner/drug dealer, but he has virtually no dialogue. Nonetheless, his presence is menacing enough to pull off the desired effect. Jason Patric is the unquestioned star of Rush. He turns in a career making performance as a ""seasoned"" narcotics officer who makes his living going undercover. Jennifer Jason Leigh is the straight-laced partner he is given to help bring down Allman. Needless to say, Patric is good at his job, almost too good and there's a reason. His partner soon finds out the real deal and also becomes romantically involved with him. Begin the downward spiral into heroin addiction...The film lags a bit at times but Patric's edgy performance is enough to get you to the eventual climax. The ending seems like it was studio mandated which is a shame because the film itself stands on it's own up to the last scene. Anyway, Rush is worth a viewing for anyone interested in deep character development and taut drama. Recommended.",1040947200,21,1069,4.783783783783784
482205,5,6302554713,"I have been waiting to add this DVD to my collection. Rush portrays the heroin addiction of a veteran undercover narcotics officer (Jason Patric) and his rookie partner (Jennifer Leigh). Jennifer Leigh starts as an enthusiastic cop wanting to take the dealers off the street and is slowly transformed into a drug addict with a moral dilemma about her career. This transformation is depressing to watch and leaves the audience with a realistic sense of tragedy. Jason Patric, Jennifer Leigh, and Sam Elliot were perfect choices for this cast because of their ""down to earth"" characters.",1036281600,11,585,5.104166666666667
482206,4,6302554713,"Set late in 1974 this movie takes place in the fictitious town of Catterly, Texas.  Greg Allman owns the bars in town and seemingly everyone wants to get high.  Guys on Harleys are even sharing a joint in front of one of Allman's establishments near the beginning.  Patric is an undercover agent from Montana with Leigh being the new recruit who wants to ""make a difference"".  Sam Elliot supplies them with cash to buy drugs.  Patric likes getting high ""too much"".  He probably does more drugs than everyone else in the show combined.  Patric and Leigh find out they're more like the people they're going to bust than the ones they're working for. Still, this is a good movie.  Jennifer Leigh does some great acting.  You watch her go from a green recruit to someone who sees both sides and doesn't want to be on either one.  Walker, their first bust, seemingly drives Patric over the edge.  He can't stand the guilt he feels for busting him.  Actually based on a true story, the ending is grim, but its hard to anticipate a ""happy"" ending anyway.",1028851200,4,1047,4.56989247311828

482210,5,6302554713,"Every citizen who desires to seriously think about our nation's overall drug policies needs to view the 1991 movie ""Rush."" I finally  decided to do a long overdue community review of this controversial film after reading today's edition of the ""Houston  Chronicle"" newspaper.  My local major daily ran a story concerning undercover police officer Barbara Markham alleging to have been fired  in 1997 by the Chambers County Narcotics Task Force for alerting her supervisors that a paid drug informant was filing false reports.  The  informant who was under the protection of the police hierarchy  simply assumed that Officer Markham would look the other way when he lied to obtain convictions.  An out of court settlement to Markham eventually resolved the matter. Very little appears to have changed since Kim Wozencraft wrote a quasi fictional  account about her own experiences of some twenty-five years ago. History merely repeats itself.
I must be cautious, however, not to merely stress the indirect educational aspects of ""Rush.""  This is also a great film, perhaps even a  masterpiece, that ranks among the very best I have ever seen.  The virtually unknown director Lilli Fini Zanuck put together a fast pace and riveting story. It  offers little comfort to those who glamorize drug use. Ditto for the forces adamantly opposed to legalizing such self destructive behavior.  True believers of either stripe will dislike ""Rush's"" brutal honesty and unwillingness to surrender to staunchly held prejudices. Jennifer  Jason-Leigh is perfectly cast as the fresh police academy graduate assigned to her first police job.  Any previously embraced idealism is  quickly eradicated when she partners with an experienced undercover cop played by Jason Patric.  The latter long ago decided that he must  personally use illegal drugs to allay the suspicions of drug dealers.  He now is a full blown addict. She inevitably finds herself in a  predicament where a drug lord demands at gunpoint that both undercover officers use drugs in his presence.  Moral compromise is not an  option but a mandatory necessity.  A very fine supporting performance is given by Max Perlich as the snitch forced to betray his close  friends.  Perlich deserved at least an Academy Award nomination.  Greg Allman should also do more film work.  Allman is more than apt portraying  the wise and cautious drug kingpin.  The elected officials and top police bosses are willing to violate their ethics and decency to put him  behind bars.  The plot of ""Rush"" revolves around the efforts to achieve this goal.
It would be a mistake to conclude that only Texas has such troubles.  Unfortunately, the corruption of the police and court systems resulting  from our current drug laws continues unabated throughout our country.  Cynicism is rampant and widely held is the view that the end  justifies the means; the law should never get in the way of busting drug offenders. The Constitution of the United States is perceived as a  document not worthy of honor.  Should we completely legalize drugs?  It is neither the purpose of this review or the filmmakers to  thoroughly deal with that divisive issue.  Nevertheless, ""Rush"" will challenge you.  I give it a five star rating.  Make sure you view this film  at least once.  You might even choose to send a copy to your favorite politicians.",977616000,47,3356,5.099447513812155

7827657,4,6302554713,"Ever since I was a child I'd always wondered what the music video for ""Tears in Heaven"" by Eric Clapton was exhibiting. I was intrigued but forgot until recently all about it until coming across the music video again and becoming re-curious again, so I did research and found out the title. And it's always good to see Jason Patric and all his unspoken and hushed glory. Lately his roles are becoming few and far between after his brush with good luck in the 80's and 90's. He's phenomenal.

I had no clue what this movie was about other than the brief description I'd seen while getting ready to rent this movie. It's one of the handfuls of movies that I can say I truly enjoyed but more than likely could never watch again because of the piece of my heart that it touches. The best way I can describe this movie is getting caught up in doing something bad while trying to do something good. This movie is sad and had me tear up a couple of times. It's at least worth a watch one time though, most definitely.",1522800000,,1010,4.315789473684211
