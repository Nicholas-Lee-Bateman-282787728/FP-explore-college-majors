3525079,5,B001D264TU,"I've always enjoyed these two actors, and it was great to see them pair up in the same flick -- were really FUN together.  Macy's dry humour and Ryan's effervescent personality.  There was a surprising cast --- Elliott Gould & LL COOL J. The locations --- S. Africa etc.--- were beautiful --- This is a fun film AND not stupid at the same time like some comedies.  It skewered HOllywood with a wry smile. Romance, caper, very funny -- LIKED IT A LOT!!!!!!!",1233273600,4,456,4.469879518072289
3525080,4,B001D264TU,"I recently screened this film at the Sundance film festival. And even though i did not have high hopes for this film; the wit and comedy stylings of the cast really pulled through, and made this film very enjoyable. William H Macy and Meg Ryan oddly enough had great chemistry and succeeded at poking fun at the insiders in the film industry. Also LL Cool J is playing a Jewish Action star which is pretty much reason alone to check out this movie.
Enjoy!",1233100800,5,455,4.428571428571429

This film is a new inside look on the Hollywood scene and should not be missed.

3525083,5,B001D264TU,"I recently viewed a screening of this film and to be honest i did not have high hopes for this film, yet i was surprised by its wit and comedic appeal.  William H. Macy and Meg Ryan have great chemistry and created a unique style of comedy that enveloped the audience at Sundance.  LL Cool J also adds to the fun of the film when he converts to judaism as he plays an action movie star. I highly recommend this movie for those who are looking for an easy going comedy that has its own twists and turns.  Also for those interested in seeing a live screening at a legit film festival, (which i highly recommend), the 19th Annual San Diego Jewish Film Festival is on Feb 14th.  [...]

3525084,5,B001D264TU,"I guess I'm only the 3rd person to see this movie because I'm only the 3rd to write a review.  I enjoyed this movie.  There were some very funny scenes, especially once they started filming the movie.  Very Good acting and actors, good script, good to see Meg Ryan again and seeming back in form, and great ending.  This was a chick flick and I love chick flicks.",1232582400,2,363,4.294117647058823
3525085,2,B001D264TU,"Hollywood apparently has an abiding incestuous interest in its own shallowness, since several movies have been made about the phony baloneys who make too many of the movies.  There are, of course, movies that are truly works of art, but they are not all that numerous.  ""The Deal"" is not anywere near the top of the line.

The story is a mess.  William Macy's character is in the process of killing himself as the movie opens.  He is living in squalor and is obviously not successful.  But he is interrupted by a nephew with a movie script, which Macy doesn't read but decides must be rewritten--several times.  Then his hype begins and soon a movie is being made without much of a script.  Disaster follows disaster until it is all one great mess, which I assume is supposed to be amusing.

There's a good cast of Macy, Meg Ryan, Elliot Gould, et al., but even a good cast can't make this amusing to anyone except Hollywood insiders.  It's almost sure to be a yawn for everyone else.",1231977600,5,984,4.508474576271187

3525087,5,B001D264TU,"What a shocker....I love finding these little virtually unknown movies that once I watch them, I love, love, love them. Here is one such movie. We get William H Macy (at his comical dry best) as a Hollywood producer who can't do a thing right. We have his nephew (Jason Ritter) who is a screenwriter and has written a very serious movie and show it to his uncle who completely changes everything and then what follows are the wheeling and dealing that has to exemplify Hollywood. Well, along comes Meg Ryan to make sure that he stays within the guidelines and budget and sparks fly...well, eventually. A great cast, a great director, great editing and that wonderful snappy and very humorous dialog that comes fast and furious.",1461369600,4,727,4.732283464566929

On the surface, the pairing of Ryan and Macy seems like a great idea for a romantic comedy.  Unfortunately neither character is particularly interesting.",1400976000,2,420,4.845070422535211

3525104,5,B001D264TU,"I thought this movie was hysterical, but in a quiet, subtle way.  Maybe it's because I'm a lawyer, and I've seen this kind of thing happen in attorneys' characterizations of their clients (or their adversaries).  It's all in that moment when he looks at his nephew's script (I won't give the topic away), and then at the article in Variety about the recently converted to Judaism black action star . . . . and he puts two and two together and it adds up to about a hundred and sixty-seven.  And everyone falls for it.  Or maybe it's just because I'm Jewish.  Anyway, this is a fine addition to this genre.

3525105,4,B001D264TU,"A thoroughly enjoyable romp into showbiz, The Deal exposes what must go on prior to the making of some films and explains why the indies rarely get made while stupid, overdone productions get a green light. The film contains what has become an almost signature role for William H. Macy - that of a loathsome, self-deprecating man who somehow is able to win the audience over by the end of the movie.",1272067200,11,399,4.555555555555555
3525106,3,B001D264TU,"The Deal is a film that will be studied in film classes in the future. It is a comedy approach to how a film is made, (like Singing in the Rain without signing and dancing). Both of these movies were condemned by critics upon the making of them. The Deal is funning and to be seen as a joke on the  industry and then how to make a film and get it produced. I liked it and say it is worth buying just laugh at a film in a film.",1271894400,8,426,3.7333333333333334

3525108,3,B001D264TU,"""The Deal"" is a light comedy with a bit of romance and satire thrown in. It follows the story of one Charlie Burns (William H. Macy, who also co-wrote the screenplay), a failed Hollywood film producer, who uses his nephew's period-piece script (about 19th century British writer and statesman Benjamin Disraeli) for his ""comeback."" While Charlie struggles to get what he wants (sometimes by cheating and lying), he meets a beautiful studio executive Deidre (Meg Ryan). I almost forgot to say that Charlie is a lady's man, too.

I am always interested in the ""films about filmmaking"" sub-genre. You know, there are so many of them - ""Adaptation"" ""Bowfinger"" etc - and some are great (""Day for Night"") and some terrible (""An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn"" ... what else?). Thanks to the cast (that includes Elliot Gould as rabbi and L.L. Cool J. as spoiled action star), ""The Deal"" is mildly amusing, but the film's satire is not sharp and the jokes are not very funny.

Don't get me wrong. I like Meg Ryan and William H. Macy. But somehow it seems they are not the right choice for the roles they are playing in ""The Deal."" There is no chemistry between the two leads to make me believe that they fall in love with each other. Besides, the story itself doesn't convince me. How can a down-and-out film producer like Charlie get a 100 million dollar action movie greenlit when everyone in Hollywood knows he has been unsuccessful so long?

All in all ""The Deal"" is not that bad, at least to me, but it has no originality either, except the location of South Africa. Perhaps this is the most convincing part of the film.",1258761600,12,1626,4.638888888888889
3525109,1,B001D264TU,"This is the worst Meg Ryan movie EVER !! Thought she could have made better choices. Really lame. Lot of profanity, ever other word.

3525111,4,B001D264TU,"Although films about Hollywood, and movies about making movies, are always a difficult sell, ""The Deal"" with Meg Ryan and William Macy is better than most, and in fact is a fairly cute and entertaining Meg Ryan movie.

The film received poor reviews, and went straight to video. But it's surprisingly funny and well done. However, the problem that films in this genre always have is that they are, ultimately, about either the tragedy or the comedy, or both, of pimping and whoring.

People in the movie business, and some movie enthusiasts in the know, find this kind of backstage story great fun. But the audience doesn't seem to care for the implication that they are dolts and marks being gamed by various users and predators in the Hollywood system, who may just coincidentally have made films that the audience loves. In any case, it's worth a view, even if you have to deal with Meg's post surgery face -- she's so cute, can't she just be cute and older, instead of botoxed, lifted, implanted, stretched and embalmed.

3525112,2,B001D264TU,"Pointless, dumb and self-indulgent is my synopsis to something that neither is a story nor contains a plot but does contain a hodgepodge of poorly, reworked comedic scenes found in countless films over the past 80 years. The film goes something like this: desperate people meet; try to sort things out through one dumb error after another (supposedly the funny parts); finally it all works out and they live happily ever after. There's suppose to be a quirky insider look at the movie making industry but, alas, nothing anyone born after 1930 doesn't already know. Add run-of-the-mill acting and fragmented directing/editing to make for a boring and tortuous viewing experience. Even the reviewers that gave it 5 stars (do they work for the studio?) consistently had little to say about the movie.",1239148800,8,797,5.045454545454546

From Fargo to A Civil Action, from his days with Mamet to most recently, he is such a great character actor, so I went into this movie with high hopes.  I was not disappointed.  He plays a hilariously sarcastic screenwriter who dupes Hollywood while falling for Meg Ryan.  LL Cool J steals the show as a rapper/method actor.  I just wish he was in the movie longer.

8291542,5,B001D264TU,"When I saw the overall undeservedly low rating this film has received, I had to write a review and put in my 2 worth.  The Deal is a film about film making, a spoof on Hollywood, and is really very amusing in a dry and witty manner.  William Macy plays a down and out film producer who posseses a very short attention  span, but once he becomes committed to a project, his heart of gold is revealed.  Meg Ryan plays an aspiring producer, who operates under the misapprehension that her integrity and loyalty will be rewarded.  She initially views the Macy characters' lying, manipulation and overall schmoozing with contempt, but after watching him in action for awhile, comes to recognize him as a master of cutting through the crap and getting things done in an efficient manner, without a lot of drama, a rare ability in Hollywood.  The Macy & Meg characters partner together when their action film is shut down, and use the remaining funds to produce a film of quality.  The plot and dialogue are spirited, intelligent and amusing. The acting is excellent. Some of the people who have previously reviewed the film objected to the low life and shady characters portrayed,  but I didn't perceive it that way.  The Macy character had a real knack for using the skills of the people surrounding him in an extremely effective manner, and all the people working on the ""good"" movie were committed to creating a good product.  There were some ""colorful"" characters, but none of them were ""disgusting"". Anyone who works in the real world will recognize the various personality types presented, and there is nothing to be gained by being judgemental. It is a fun movie,  about real people,  with genuinely interesting character development. One drawback, unfortunately, was Meg Ryan's face.  She evidently has had some work done, and in some shots she looked almost haggard.",1507593600,,1869,4.839622641509434
