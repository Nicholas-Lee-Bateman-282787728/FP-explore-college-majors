2377678,5,B000A7DVSG,"This is not the most expensive CGI movie ever made. It's not even in the same league as pixar or other CGI movie makers, but this movie and the other one have rock solid and original story boards with solid and very interesting characters. This isn't just for the kids, I love these two movies. I keep them stored away in my room, you know, to keep them from getting scrathed or ruined. All the other reviews about these two movie metal ages, and fire and ice are true. It's the reason I bought mine and I will always look for those people on other reviews because they were right about these movies. Thanx guys and girls. Now take my advice and atleast try them and maybe you'll fall in love with them like me. God bless you alll.",1325548800,,731,4.266187050359712
2377679,4,B000A7DVSG,My 8 yr old loved the first Dragon movie so much I was glad to find the second one. The movie has creative characters and teaches kids lessons on dealing with anger and not judging others by their past.,1240185600,,202,4.205128205128205
2377680,5,B000A7DVSG,"If your kid likes dragons then they will love this tale. The graphics are great, the music is fabulous and the story is top shelf. The people who wrote this story and the others in this saga should get an award because they are entertaining for kids and adults too and border on theatre releases. I actually prefer these movies to some of the other hack job sci fi flicks being released in theatres today. A lot of imagination went into these stories and your kid should really enjoy them. I would recommend the child being around 5 or older before turning them onto these stories/DVDs because there is animated fighting in it. I simply watch them with my kids and when questions come up then I'm there to answer them so they understand its only fantasy.",1216080000,2,754,4.510948905109489

THE ONLY SAD PART IS TARGON AND AURORA DIE, BUT THEY RETURN AS LIGHT DRAGONS. AND THEY HAD EGGS. THE BABIES ARE SOOOOOOOOO CUUUUUUUTE!!!!!!!
I REALY HOPE THEY COME OUT WITH A THIRD MOVIE.
I'M DIEING TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT AFTER ONE OF THE SHADOW DRAGONS SNEAKS INTO DRAGON WORLD AND I HOPE THEY BRING BACK XENOZ TOO.",1202947200,,975,4.517045454545454
2377682,4,B000A7DVSG,"My son was begging us for this movie ever since he saw the preview that came with the Dragon Egg toys.  (Smart marketing.)  Anyway, he has this one and the first one (Fire and Ice) and LOVES both of them.  He is almost 6.  I was concerned that they might be too violent, since I don't even let him watch Sat. morning cartoons, but compared to a lot of what is out there, these weren't too bad.  I like that they have both a hero and heroine who are equally strong.  I'd reccomend both movies and plan to buy the 3rd one.",1174953600,7,520,4.049019607843137
2377683,5,B000A7DVSG,This is an awesome sequal to an excellent movie. It's got an even better plot than before. The only problem is Thoron's voice isn't as deep as it was in the first movie (and by that I mean it's noticable - I had to check and make sure it was the same person playing him). I can't wait for the next movie! I hope they bring back Zenos in the next movie. They kind of left you hanging there.,1139529600,8,389,3.9367088607594938

8075468,4,B000A7DVSG,"The CG animation isn't great, but the story was fun.  Kind of sorry there wasn't another installment after this one - even though this was kind of cheesy and predictable, that's not always a bad thing.  The story was good, it tried for multiple layers of complexity, and made a few good swipes at it, but it lacked smooth transitions, and explanations sort of came out of nowhere.  [Why would an elder dragon not know his ""dragonlore""?  Oh, so the king dragon can explain what's happening!]  I'm sniping, but I watched the whole thing.  Not sorry I bought the disk, and will probably watch it again eventually.  If you're looking for sophisticated CG or storytelling, you might want to look elsewhere, but I had fun watching it.",1416441600,,728,4.68503937007874

8075471,4,B000A7DVSG,"I'm 36 yrs. old and thought this movie was pretty bad. However, the movie was for my 8 year old son, and he thought it was fantastic. So, over all I guess it's worth 4 stars.",1368057600,,174,3.861111111111111
