8732278,5,B0151SE7TU,"This is a great movie about trauma medicine. Not the boring documentary type but not overly dramatic either, and very factually on point. As soon as the movie started, I thought it was going to be just as bad as all of the made-in-the-80s-at-least training videos I've had to endure. I was dead wrong, acting is great and storyline is great, even the music is not at all insufferable. It's very educational, a lot more enjoyable if you actually know a thing or two about medicine; would recommend to anyone interested in medicine.",1494028800,2,530,4.709677419354839

8732284,5,B0151SE7TU,Really like this movie! It tells a true story about the development of the nation's first Trauma Center and the pioneer heart surgeon Dr. R Adams Cowley's fight to establish a trauma system with rapid transportation through the use of police helicopters. It also explains the The Golden Hour concept of rescue medicine. This film was based on a best selling novel as well. Excellent movie! Well worth buying. It's also very realistic.

8732287,5,B0151SE7TU,"If you are critically injured you have less than an hour to survive. You might not die right then; it may be days or weeks later, but the process of shock has begun, the bodys reaction to terrible trauma from car accidents, gunshots. I spent a night in the original ShockTrauma unit, watching heart surgeon R Adams Cowley and his team... one of the most extraordinary experiences I've ever had. They created the system of trauma medicine, with a team in the ER 24 hours a day, and discovered the critical concept of the Golden Hour. As the DVD says, before ER, before the modern system of emergency trauma medicine, there was the first, Shock Trauma.",1441670400,3,650,4.612068965517241
