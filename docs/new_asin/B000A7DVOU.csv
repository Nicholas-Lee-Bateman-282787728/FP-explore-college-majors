2377684,4,B000A7DVOU,"Many quality movies are released below the radar or do not receive the attention they deserve, and ""Heaven Must Wait"" is one of these gems. Andrew McCarthy plays Raymond,a layabout of sorts who can't seem to keep a job and finally, his successful half-brother informs him that Raymond has inherited some property in the English countryside. Upon arrival in the seemingly idyllic village of Copeingwell, Raymond is disappointed to find that his inheritance consists of a crumbling church. The village villain, bully and Scrooge, a Mr Slee makes Raymond an offer on the land and church, having his own dark motives, having to do with treasure that supposedly lies buried in the derelict church. Raymond also has to deal with a grumpy but attractive divorcee [Louise Lombard] who runs the local B&B and a young orphan boy named Diggity who believes that if he can get Raymond's life turned around for the better and improve Raymond then he [Diggity] will get to be an angel.

The story as described here may seem uninspired but the actors are wonderful in their roles and the lush English countryside provides a beautiful setting for this charming story about finding one's self, purpose and happiness, and a sense of community. A sweet little gem that deserves more attention.",1249689600,31,1274,4.953271028037383
2377685,5,B000A7DVOU,"Since I watched ""Mannequin"" for the very first time, I became a fan of Andrew McCarthy's works. He is a very versatile actor performing nicely either in dramas or comedies. And this little jewel of film is another excellent work of this sometimes and unfairly underrated actor. Here he plays Raymond who is unemployed at the time his half-brother tells him he is the heir of a property in a rural place in England. Very surprised, after saying good-bye to a lovely girl, his best friend in life, and receiving a half-angel kind of brooch as a memento, he flies to his new destination. Arriving there, he meets Mr. Slee, in principle the epitome of the very bad guy who wishes to buy Raymond's property which is...an ancient church where he thinks there is a hidden treasure. Raymond, little by little gets to know the other inhabitants of the village such as Diggity, an orfan boy, and Rachel, a beautiful woman who owns the local Bed & Breakfast and also a gypsy family. His adventures start by the time he gives up selling his property... Watch the film and you will find out why there are angels protecting and changing many people's lives, particularly Raymond's!",1221436800,7,1167,4.697560975609756
2377686,5,B000A7DVOU,"This small ""indie"" film has more going for it than the big budget extravaganzas we hear so much about. Virtually ignored, this film has the elements that Hollywood screenwriters have missed out on for several years: character, unique plot and it is genuinely moving.

Andrew McCarthy stars as a Georgia slouch who inherits property in England. Since he is of no use at home, his stepbrother insists he go there. Much to Kane's (McCarthy) dismay, he inherits a rundown church in a rural British outpost. Along the way we meet a greedy, rich man who wants the church to dig for a fabled treasure, a bitter divorcee (Louise Lombard) who runs the local B&B, a gypsy family and a charming orphan who wants to become an angel. He thinks converting Kane into a man Lombard will fall in love with (they both have many misunderstandings in the film), he will become one.

This is a lovely quiet movie. It is a character study that is so interesting it runs lightening fast and is over, leaving you wanting more.

Forget the comic book, computer game, old TV series remakes (which is all Hollywood is cranking out) and watch this movie.

It's genuine. The acting is fine all around and the transfer is very good.",1218931200,14,1202,4.629107981220657

2377694,4,B000A7DVOU,"It was a good movie, but pictures were often too dark.  Especially, for those in our congregation with seeing problems.  The child seemed to be talking to this guardian angel and not to the Lord.  Some of the English was hard to understand, as it had an English accent.  Though I wouldn't call it perfect, it wasn't bad, either.  We showed it at our New Year's Eve church soup/supper.",1388534400,,384,4.507246376811594
2377695,3,B000A7DVOU,It was a good movie but not what I thought .  It was more of a child movie.  But it was fun to watch and really cute.  The southern accents were very badly done.  I am from the south and I have never heard anything that sounded like this.  Bad Bad Bad.,1388275200,,252,3.769230769230769

2377705,4,B000A7DVOU,"Sort of an old fashioned movie. I bought it because it starred Andrew McCarthy.  He speaks with a strong southern accent in this movie. A cute story of a man (Raymond) who loses his job and then finds out he inherited an English property, which turns out to be an old church. One of the town residents want to buy the property because he believes there is a treasure in the church. Raymond meets a mysterious young boy who thinks that if he helps Raymond he will earn his wings as an angel. The story has a nice ending, but is rather short. Well priced DVD.",1363564800,2,557,4.254716981132075

2377710,5,B000A7DVOU,The movie is hard to understand until the ending.  You don't understand the title until the very last minutes of the movie. I will not give away the ending. Will watch it many more times.,1359676800,,187,4.3428571428571425

2377713,4,B000A7DVOU,"THIS MOVIE IS AN INTERESTING COMBINATION.  IT'S LIKE THEY TOOK ROMANCE, COMEDY, DRAMA AND RELIGION, PUT IN A BLENDER AND IT CAME OUT WELL.  IT TOOK MY THIRD VIEWING TO GET USED TO ANDREW MCCARTHY HAVING SUCH A HEAVY SOUTHERN ACCENT BUT HE DID IT WELL. I'M A SOUTHERN GAL MYSELF SO I CAN JUDGE WITH PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF THIS ACCENT.  I'M STILL A BIG FAN OF HIS WORK.  ONE WOULD HAVE TO MENTION THE DELIGHTFUL MAX DOLBEY AS DIGGITY.  HE'S A FINE YOUNG ACTOR.  IT WILL DEFINITELY GO ON MY ""WATCH AGAIN"" STACK OF DVDS. MY THANKS TO AMAZON FOR THE VARIETY OF MOVIES AND DVDS THEY OFFER.",1349049600,,582,4.293577981651376
2377714,2,B000A7DVOU,"This movie made Andrew McCarthy out to be a hick from Georgia.  His accent was so fake.  And the story line was not believable.  Kind of hard to follow in places.  Although it is a decent film (no swearing or nudity), Not one I would recommend.",1338249600,3,244,4.239130434782608
2377715,1,B000A7DVOU,"Should be ""Everyone Must Wait"", Very Slow movie.  I am an Andrew McCarthy fan, he has performed better in many other movies.  This diamond in the rough, should have stayed in the coal mine.  Gave mine to the trash man.",1285891200,,218,4.4
2377716,4,B000A7DVOU,"A laid back entertainment.  Slow plot but a relaxing ""geel good"" movie.  Slightly sugary.",1275350400,,89,5.285714285714286
8075500,1,B000A7DVOU,Was disappointed in the movie. Very predictable and did not think they displayed the talent of Andrew McCarthy,1502668800,,110,5.166666666666667
8075501,4,B000A7DVOU,"It's true.  The southern accent isn't perfect.  It's true.  It moves a bit slowly at times.  It's also true that this movie is ""old fashioned""....but most of all it warmed my heart.  These days we could all use a touch of that.",1494633600,,227,4.309523809523809

8075506,2,B000A7DVOU,"I wanted to like this movie. I love Andrew McCarthy. But watching him try to do a southern accent for over an hour is just painful. This movie is just one cliche after another. It's supposed to be heartwarming but it's just annoying. Acting? Bad. Screenplay? Bad. Directing? Oh, was there a director on this film? Yikes. Bad, bad, bad.",1421366400,,335,4.6
8075507,5,B000A7DVOU,"The script is a bit of a pantomime, but this is still a good film, because the actors ham it up gloriously whilst still taking the dramatic side and the message seriously. Andrew McCarthy is fun as the goofy hapless American  thrust into the milieu of the slightly unusual English village, with its well-meaning villagers, the villain of the piece (a ham it up for all its worth performance ex-Eastenders star Bill Treacher) and of course the slightly defective angel (played straight by a sweetly effective Max Dolbey). I bought this because I'm a film collector, but I kept it because I love it!",1421193600,,597,4.740384615384615
