What was thought to have a huge impact on story lines and a new begining for the wwf was halted when the driver who ran over stone cold was still not resolved.  The matches themselves were boring and pointless.  The steel cage match was not up to edge, christians, and the hardys potential and I was real disappointed beacuse they did not show much of there skills.  The main event was like an ordinary match on a smackdown episode. The outcome was also real disapointing.  The only upside to this ppv was the return of stone cold steve austin after 10 months.

The return of Stone Cold Steve Austin was sort of interesting, as he searches for the person who ran him down with the automobile a year earlier at the 1999 Survivor Series. I like the part where Austin delivers 3 stunners to Shane McMahon in the ring and drinks beer. That was cool. Otherwise, the rest of this PPV stunk. Don't waste your money on this.

1059199,5,6305710481,"Another overall great PPV by the World Wrestling Federation! But, when doesn't the WWF deliver an awesome PPV? Anyway, we saw things open up with an eight-man tag match involving The Acolytes/The Dudleyz vs. Right to Censor. It was a wild one, as the crowd was hot for this hot opener from beginning to end!
Next on the card, the vetern wrestler-turned annoucer Jerry ""The King"" Lawler duked things out with his long time rival Tazz! We even saw a future WWF superstar, Raven debuet in this brutal leather strap match.
Wild one was on hands next. ""The Lethal Weapon"" Steve Blackmas was on hand at Unforgiven and was willing to defend his title...against anybody. He issued an Open Invitational match for the WWF Hardcore Title! He had to fight against guys like Crash, Perry Saturn, and many others...but who would walk away with the title?
One of the most hated superstars in WWF history, X-pac was on hand for the next match facing against Chris ""the Aatola of Rock and Rollah"" Jericho! Remember, a year from this date, at Unforgiven 1999, these two squared off in Jericho's WWF PPV debuet! Chris won that match by DQ, but now he wants him 1-1 and without any interference.
The match of the night was soon to take place in The Hardyz vs. Edge/Christian for the Tag Titles. You think that is good enough? Four of the best high-flyers in the buisness in the ring together battling for the top Tag prize, the Tag Titles? Well, apparently not for these two teams, as they fought in a steel cage! What a match that was! See that match, and see who walks away with the titles! Can The Hardyz FINALLY win the titles from Edge/Christian or will it be deju vu all over again?
Up next, Rikishi Phatu, now the top heel in the buisness would face Eddie Guerrero for the Intercontinental Championship. This is Rikishi's LAST WWF PPV as a fun-loving, dancing baby-face...can he win the Title for his fans, or will he turn his back on them at Unforgiven? Will Chyna, Eddie's ""mamacita"" but Rikishi's then friend interfere? If so, who will she help? Find out soon by purchasing this video!
A fued was about to be finished between two men who hate each other: Kurt Angle and HHH. They are both heels, yet they are always at each other's throats because of HHH's wife, Stephinie McMahon-Helmsley. Kurt and Steph have a strictly ""buisness"" reletionship"", but since when do buisness partners kiss each other like Kurt did to Steph? And, when do buisness partners hit on each other, like Kurt has been doing to Steph? HHH wants a piece of Kurt, but who would Steph help? Her soul-mate or buisness-mate?
Finally, to end the night we get to see an incredible match against 4 of the most famous stars in Federation history: Kane, Chris Benoit, The Undertaker, and of course ""The People's Champion"" The Rock! Will Benoit win the title against his most hated competitor, The Rock? Or will Kane grab the title against his new enemy and his brother, The Undertaker. Even thought Rocky has the title, anybody can pin anybody for the title, and that will insure everybody of a WILD match, to close a WILD night.

7892894,4,6305710481,"Unforgiven, emanating from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was in for a wild night. The main talk going into the show was the return of Stone Cold Steve Austin to track down the man who ran him over in the parking garage at the 1999 Survivor Series. Here's my review on in my opinion, of the best PPVs the WWF produced in 2000

1.) 8 Man Tag Team Match: The Dudley Boyz and The APA vs The Right To Censor

This was a short opener that's nothing too special. Val Venis gets the pinfall win after Steven Richards nails Bubba Ray with a superkick. Richards gets a post-match beat down from the Dudleyz and the APA before being powerbombed through a table by Bubba

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

A backstage segment with Triple H making a vow to Stephanie that he'll destroy Kurt Angle while Stephanie apologizes for ever defending Angle and that she was wrong about him

2.) Strap Match: Jerry the King Lawler vs Tazz

To follow up with their SummerSlam match, Jerry Lawler and Tazz would go at it once more. This time in a Strap match. Another short match, with Jerry and Tazz both getting in strap shots on each other. The only noteworthy thing about this match was Raven making his WWF debut, who interfered towards the end of the match and attacked Lawler with a DDT to give Tazz the win

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) 10  Minute Hardcore Open Invitational For Hardcore Championship: Al Snow vs Crash Holly vs Test w/Trish Stratus vs Perry Saturn w/Terri vs Funaki vs Steve Blackman (c)

Growing up in the Attitude Era, Hardcore matches were always my favorite and never disappointed and this match was no different. Pure excitement and entertainment at its finest with WWF superstars beating the stuffing out of each other with a variety of weapons to cease control of the Hardcore Title. The title changed hands a couple of times throughout the battle. First Crash pinned Blackman to win the title before getting jumped and pinned by Saturn, seconds later. Blackman ends up pinning Saturn to retain and win the match.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

A backstage segment of Kurt Angle running into Stone Cold Steve Austin for the very first time. Angle offers Austin a gold medal and goes on to patronize him about how it's not as big as his because Austin didn't do anything to win it. Steve Austin responds to Kurt's comments with an ass whipping in the backstage area

4.) X-Pac vs Chris Jericho

This match all started when X-Pac attacked Chris Jericho weeks prior, for no reason at all. X-Pac would continue his assault on Jericho, busting him open backstage with a pair of nun-chucks. And so it lead to this sure to be ""bowling shoe ugly"" grudge match. Jericho and X-Pac had some awesome technical matches back in WCW and it was nice to see these two technical athletes throw down again in the WWF. I never really liked X-Pac and thought he was a boring wrestler to say the least but Jericho made him look good in the ring. Jericho makes X-Pac tap out to the Walls of Jericho for the win. X-Pac jumps Jericho after the match with a nun-chucks attack

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

A backstage segment with Kurt Angle complaining to Commissioner Foley about getting attacked by Stone Cold. Foley makes Angle's match with Triple H, No Disqualifications. Another backstage segment with Stone Cold, this time confronting The Rock before attacking Just Joe in the locker room

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) WWF Tag Team Championship Steel Cage Match: Edge and Christian (c) vs The Hardy Boyz

When people think about the Hardyz and Edge and Christian, they tend to think about their TLC matches which is ashame because this match was a great one and in my opinion, underrated. Both teams are limited to giving their usual stellar performance due to being surrounded by a cage but they make it work. A high and fast paced match with a ton of stomach dropping shots and dives. Lita interferes towards the end, followed by a sick ending that must be seen to be believed

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) Intercontinental Championship Match: Rikishi vs Eddie Guerrero (c) w/Chyna

The build-up to this match was hilarious. Revolving around Eddie Guerrero constantly sneaking around behind Chyna's back or losing his temper with her out of jealousy. Rikishi sort of played a side part who had a grudge to settle with Eddie. Unfortunately this match did not live up to the hype or exceed expectations. Nothing noteworthy about the match and Eddie retains on a DQ. Disappointing.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Funny backstage angle with Kurt and Trish

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.) No Disqualifications Match: Triple H w/Stephanie McMahon vs Kurt Angle (Mick Foley as Special Referee)

The storyline build up between Angle and HHH was amazing with the constant love triangle drama surrounding HHH, Stephanie, and Angle but the match was even greater! A very brutal showing of brawling was showcased throughout this match and it became even more brutal when Triple H began bleeding internally after he was belly to belly suplexed through the Spanish announce table by Angle. Angle injured Triple H's ribs prior to the PPV, so HHH's ribs were Angle's main focus in the match. This match would put a lid on the Angle/HHH feud......for now, as it would continue the following year in 2001 and in 2002.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Shane McMahon claimed that he knew who ran over Stone Cold and had video proof. Shane McMahon accuses Steve Blackman of being the one who ran over Austin and uses a video of Blackman hitting Ken Shamrock with a car on a 1998 Raw as reasoning. Blackman comes out, followed by Steve Austin who drops Blackman with a Stunner. Follow this up with 3 Stunners to Shane. This was a pretty dumb segment. Is was just to add fuel to the Blackman/McMahon feud and did nothing to advance the Stone Cold storyline. Basically just a way to treat the Philadelphia crowd

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

8.) WWF Championship Match: Chris Benoit vs Kane vs The Undertaker vs The Rock (c)

Four gifted athletes step in the squared circle to compete for the prestigious WWF Heavyweight Championship. You get brawler #1, The Undertaker, the submission technician, Chris Benoit, brawler 2, Kane, and the showman, The Rock. Mix these 4 into the ring and you have yourself one heck of a main event! Each superstar soundly shows of what they have to give in the ring and it doesn't disappoint. The match didn't reach the incredible heights it could've reached, but it was still entertainingly watchable. At first it looked as if Chris Benoit was the new WWF Champion and the Age of Benoit had started after pinning Taker, following a chair shot but Commissioner Foley came out and restarted the match. The match went on for maybe another 5-10 minutes and The Rock retained to close the PPV. Watching this many many years ago when this PPV first came out, I was glad to see The Rock retain, but now that I'm older, I think that this PPV should've been Benoit's time to shine. He was over as a heel and had a great rookie year in WWF

Overall: This was a pretty solid PPV. Only a couple of insignificant matches were on the card but above all else, Unforgiven 2000 was a good PPV that WWF produced in 2000.",1393545600,,8191,5.638730675345809

7892896,4,6305710481,"The 8 man tag team match(The Right To Censor vs APA & The Dudley Boys) was short but sweet and the same goes for the Eddie Guerrero-Rikishi-IC title match. The Tazz-Jerry Lawler-strap match was not great but pretty good. The 10-minute Hardcore Battle Royal while having only 6 men instead of 15,it was still just as good as the battle royal from Wrestlemania 2000. The Chris Jericho-X Pac match was a solid,hard-hitting,back-and-forth bout. The Hardy Boys-Edge & Christian-Steel Cage match for the World tag team titles was a high-flying,hard-hitting,hardcore showstealer. The HHH-Kurt Angle match was a hard-hitting,entertaining,back-and-forth brawl. The Fatal Four Way match for the WWE title(The Rock vs Kane vs The Undertaker vs Chris Beniot) was pretty good/solid for a 4 way bout. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10.",1280880000,,817,5.150375939849624
7892897,2,6305710481,"OH MY GOSH!  STONE COLD STEVE AUSTIN IS COMING BACK!  HE'S GOING TO GET REVENGE!  HE'S GOING TO RAISE HELL!

......Whatever.  Could the WWF have picked a worse night to bring back the most popular wrestler in history?  UNFORGIVEN 2000 is a miserable 3 hours with too few bright spots.

1) Right To Censor v. The APA & The Dudley Boyz
---Alright, this one isn't too bad.  It's a predictable but acceptable opener to watch four self-righteous hypocrites get beaten up by four less-than-moral wrestlers.  The match moves at a nice pace, has the familiar hot tags when our good guys dominate the bad guys, and even though RTC sneaks in the pinfall, The Dudleyz & APA get some table revenge.  Back in 2000, this was already a clich.  But at least it's not boring.
""6.0 / 10""
______________________________________

2) Strap Match
Jerry Lawler v. Tazz
---""The King"" won their previous match from a month ago.  Guess who's gonna win this one.  Tazz rarely got a chance to do his thing in the WWF, and Lawler could only do so much at this age.  It's a great shock to see Raven make his debut appearance (to my knowledge).  But otherwise, this is a passable match at best.
""5.0 / 10""
______________________________________

3) 6-Man Hardcore Invitational - 10 Minute Time Length
Hardcore Championship
Crash Holly v. Test v. Al Snow (European champion) v.
Perry Saturn v. Funaki v. Steve Blackman (Hardcore champion)
---When the action is in the ring or at ringside, there are some nice high-risk spots.  When the six start brawling in the crowd, the cameras do a pretty poor job of keeping up.  It just becomes a meandering battle until the closing minutes.  Like most of what you'll see from UNFORGIVEN 2000, this Hardcore Title contest is average.
""5.5 / 10""
______________________________________

4) Chris Jericho v. X-Pac
---Anyone know why X-Pac was still using the DX gimmick when the faction had already disbanded?  Never mind.  This is the most technical display from this PPV, and it's a solid showing from two gifted athletes.  Jericho already had a successful first year with the WWF, and X-Pac (though annoying to most audiences) had some sweet physical skills.  This is an even-handed contest that earned its PPV airtime.
""7.0 / 10""
______________________________________

5) Steel Cage Match - Tag Team Championships
Edge & Christian (champions) v. The Hardy Boyz
---This match is often overshadowed by the legendary Ladder/TLC Matches we saw for almost a year straight.  While not as memorable as those other high-risk displays, this is still an excellent match.  These four guys mesh so well together, that it's almost like poetry-in-motion (forgive the pun).  What more do I need to say?  This is a fast-paced showdown with plenty of stunts that no human being should ever attempt.
""8.0 / 10""
______________________________________

6) Intercontinental Championship
Eddie Guerrero (champion) v. Rikishi
---There's a very funny storyline, with a jealous Eddie desperately trying to prevent Chyna from showing off her sexual appeal.  It's kinda like the Marc Mero & Sable angle from 1998, and equally funny, too.  But this match is a real letdown.  I have no problem with matches that push storylines more than the in-ring action.  But for crying out loud, Rikishi and Eddie were two athletes capable of giving us at least 10 minutes, and still push the angle.  Instead, this whole schmoz was about 5 minutes.  All in all, I was bored, disappointed, and felt cheated...and lied to, and stolen from.  (SWISH!)
""4.0 / 10""
______________________________________

7) No Disqualifications
Kurt Angle v. Triple H
---Now this is more like it!  I always enjoyed the love triangle between Angle, HHH, and Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley.  Heck, I even liked Stephanie the character!  But what I like even more is how well these two work together.  This became a No-DQ contest earlier this evening, and in my opinion, it makes more sense for the rivalry, and inspired a much better match than we would've gotten.  The action gets pretty rough, especially after a Spanish table spot leaves HHH spitting up blood (Angle got a legitimate concussion from this table a month earlier).  The aftermath includes a kiss between a bloody pair of lips...THAT'S HARDCORE!  Back in 2000, Kurt Angle alternated between crisp technician and dorky jobber.  Thankfully, this is more of the latter.  Even more strange was seeing HHH in a pesudo-babyface role back in 2000.  Unlike the IC Title Match, this is a great way to advance a storyline AND deliver great action.  ""Advance?""  Actually, I don't remember this storyline actually finishing after this PPV...hmm...oh well, this is good enough.
""8.0 / 10""
______________________________________

***Throughout the evening, `Stone Cold' Steve Austin basically did whatever he wanted to whomever he wanted backstage.  His return culminates with Shane McMahon telling him --- in the ring --- who was responsible for running into him 10 months ago.  In an amusing but stupid development, Steve Blackman is blamed because of some Parking Lot Brawl from a year ago.  Anyway, this segment goes on and on, with Shane getting Stunned...Austin celebrates...then he gets Stunned again (okay)...Austin celebrates...Shane gets Stunned third time (WTF!).  I mean, could this have gone on any longer!?
""4.0 / 10"" (Nice to have Steve Austin back, but this was incredibly long).
______________________________________

8) WWF Championship
The Undertaker v. Kane v. Chris Benoit v. The Rock (champion)
 ---Well, I hope you hate technical wrestling, because there are nothing but punches and kicks and a few slams for almost 20 minutes.  Fun, huh?  This is easily the worst Fatal Fourway I have ever seen, and definitely one of the WWF/WWE's worst PPV main events.  Other than a neat repeat of Benoit stealing the win, and getting his victory reversed by Mick Foley (this happened 3 months ago with Benoit), this match is just really boring.  These four guys (even the giant Kane) could do great things in one-on-one or tag team action.  But instead of letting the wrestlers have some neat singles or triple threat skirmishes, it's just a repetitive brawl with almost no sensible pace.  Basically, I hate this match, and I feel bad that these four guys didn't shine more.  I don't who's to blame, but this is definitely ""UNFORGIVEN"".
""3.0 / 10""
______________________________________

The WWF had a good year in 2000, but their PPV lineup was pretty average.  UNFORGIVEN, however, is below average.  It doesn't feel like a PPV.  It feels like hodgepodge of ideas, with only a few of them reaching their potential.  The Steel Cage Match and HHH/Angle grudge match are excellent.  The undercard is pretty mediocre, but I can accept that.  What I can't accept is the most popular superstar in wrestling history having a boring return segment, and four of the WWF's top guys engaging in a boring showdown, especially with their talents.  So, bottom line: Avoid UNFORGIVEN 2000.  I'm sure you can find its highlights on YouTube, anyway.",1234224000,2,7038,5.05125977410947
7892898,4,6305710481,"This Unforgiven was good. It started off a little slow, but then it really picked up.

1.8-man tag team match

APA and The Dudley Boyz vs. Right To Censor

This wasn't a very good match at all. It was real short and when what happens after the match is better than what happened during the match,there is a problem. 5 out of 10.

2. Leather Strap Match

Tazz vs. Jerry""The King""Lawler

This was a dissappointment. It just seemed slow and boring. It was also Raven's debut. 6 out of 10.

3. Hardcore Invitational

Steve Blackman vs. Crash vs. Test vs. Al Snow vs. Perry Saturn vs. Funaki(Hardcore Championship)

This was a good match. They constantly used weapons and they fought everywhere. The only problems with this match was that it was only 10 minutes and they repeatedly used the trash can lid. I do like the concept though and I think that they should bring the Hardcore Title back. 7 out of 10.

4. X-Pac vs. Chris Jericho

This was a good match. It was more of a technical contest which isn't a bad thing. Many people consider X-Pac a bad wrestler,but I don't. 8 out of 10.

5. Steel Cage Match

Hardy Boyz vs. Edge and Christian(Tag Team Championship)

This match was just amazing. They did crazy moves and Matt Hardy was busted open pretty badly. Even though Jeff Hardy got out of the cage early,he came back in. There was even a Ladder involved in the match. When Lita came out to help the Hardyz,Christian was trying to climb up the Ladder to get back in,but she gave him a sick hurricanrana off the top of the Ladder. 10 out of 10.

6. Eddie Guerrero vs. Rikishi(Intercontinental Championship)

This match actually had a history,with Eddie Guerrero and Chyna having problems. It wasn't too bad of a match, but it still wasn't up to its potential. 7 out of 10.

7. No Disqualification Match

Triple H vs. Kurt Angle

This match was really focused on the Hunter-Kurt-Stephanie love triangle. Mick Foley was the referee for this match too, and it was excellent. Kurt Angle delivered an overhead belly-to-belly suplex through the announcer's table. After that the match slowed down a bit but it was still great. 10 out of 10.

Stone Cold Steve Austin returned on this night as well,and throughout the night he jumped everybody he came into contact with including Kevin Kelly,Kurt Angle,Joe,Steve Blackman and Shane McMahon. It was hilarious!

8. Fatal-4 Way Match

The Rock vs. The Undertaker vs. Chris Benoit vs. Kane(WWF Championship Match)

This match was great it had a very quick pace and all four guys performed very well,especially Chris Benoit,who laid it all out there. He almost won,but the call was reversed. The ending kind of puzzles me though:Why would Kane prevent Undertaker from breaking up the final pin? Still a great match. 9 out of 10.",1138924800,3,2766,4.657731958762887

Right To Censor V. The Dudley Boyz & Acolytes

Not a very good way to kick off a show. Right To Censor even win the match. *3/4

Brooklyn Strap Match:

Tazz V. Jerry ""The King"" Lawler

Not very good either. Tazz wins because of Raven!?!?!? **

Hardcore Invitational for the WWF Hardcore Championship:

Steve Blackman (Champion) V. Perry Saturn V. Test V. Crash V. Funaki V. Al Snow

Good match but it seemed boring to me. Blackman walks out as Champ. ***

Chris Jericho V. X-Pac

Could have been so much better. Both are great wrestlers and could have stole the show but it was just a above average match with Jericho winning. ***1/2

Steel Cage Match for the WWF Tag Team Championship:

Edge & Christian (Champion) V. Hardy Boyz

Great match that isn't as good as everyone says it is. It's still very good, but not that good. The Hardyz win the Titles! ***3/4

WWF Intercontinental Championship:

Eddie Guerrero (Champion) V. Rikishi

ok match with Eddie winning by DQ. **1/4

No Disqualification Match:

Triple H V. Kurt Angle

Great match that I think could have been just a little better. Triple H wins. ****

Fatal Four Way Match for the WWF Championship:

The Rock (Champion) V. Chris Benoit V. Undertaker V. Kane

ok...Finally..Chris Benoit wins the WWF Championship!...Damn You Foley! God Mick doesn't like Chris very much does he. Benoit has been named WWF Champion 2 times in 3 months and have no gold to show for it. Awesome match with the Rock retaining. ****1/4",1122422400,2,1559,4.7706766917293235

APA & The Dudleyz vs Right 2 Censor

Boring match with some exciting parts. 5/10

2. Strap Match

3. Hardcore Invitational

Pretty good as far as hardcore matches could have made it longer. 7/10

4. X-pac vs Jericho

What kind of name is Xpac, anyway very boring Xpac makes Y2J look bad. 6/10

Eddie Guerrero vs Rikishi

Card filler stunk...Eddie is great but not at this time. 5/10

7. HHH vs Angle Referee:Mick Foley

hHh is the best and Angle is the best ""wrestler"" ever together,Great and the added twist with the HHH/Angle/Steph love tirangle built up the hype. 9/10

8. Championship Fatal4Way

Rock vs Benoit vs Taker vs Kane

4 huge superstars and individual fudes in between made it good but the ending is lame and takes away. 8.5/10

It starts off lame and heats up tword the end the PPV individual ratings average to 9.5 which is a very good PPV that i found somewhere 4 a dolla so if you can find it it is worth it.",1117584000,,1247,4.334782608695652
