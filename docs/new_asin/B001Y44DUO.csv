8358006,5,B001Y44DUO,"My boys (4.5 and 2 year old) absolutely love The Zula Patrol. In the past, they have learned about planetary orbits and rotation, simple machines, characteristics of the planets in the solar system and so much more about space and planets from watching The Zula Patrol. This video is fantastic in that it has expanded their knowledge of eco-systems and life cycles. They have really learned while watching this video...knowledge that they have be able to apply beyond this video.

I highly recommend The Zula Patrol for science and non-science kids alike!",1251504000,7,555,5.032608695652174
