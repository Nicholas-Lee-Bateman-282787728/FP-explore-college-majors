Enjoy this one with your children and grandchildren. This is truly ""historic television"" - long on value!!

4456054,5,B004QVMHZA,I have thoroughly enjoyed Bat Masterson several times since purchasing the DVD set.  The quality is very good.  The shows are great.  There are a lot of great episodes with soon-to-be well known actors guest appearing in the shows.  I highly recommend this set for anyone who likes vintage western TV shows.  It is one of my favorites.,1334707200,7,335,4.706896551724138
4456055,5,B004QVMHZA,"I purchased this set as a Christmas present for my brother.  The set was in a compact plastic box with individual plastic sleeves holding each disc attached by rings.  The discs were in great shape, and the audio/visual quality was very good considering that this is a sixty year old black and white series.",1334275200,5,307,4.666666666666667
4456056,5,B004QVMHZA,"This series is a collection of individual episodes (very few linked episodes) reflecting the American West thru the positive tough ""good guy"" storylines - showing true American integrity, honor, moral values & principles, humor, action, some appropriate classy romance and fun for the whole family.  From adults to the little cowboys and girls they'll appreciate the action and adventure this collection provides.",1331424000,5,413,5.661290322580645
4456057,5,B004QVMHZA,"Im a western movie fanatic and when i stumbled on this Bat Masterson boxed set I just had to buy it.  The set is simply awesome, in order and very nice picture and sound.  Was a very good purchase in my opinion.  Thanks Amazon for offering it!",1327622400,5,243,4.127659574468085
4456058,5,B004QVMHZA,I am not a movie production expert and I do not care to be I just know that I like the oldies from my childhood and yes maybe they are not the same quality of filming of today but it does not have the garbage of today's tv and movies either.  I would recommend this to any generation to enjoy for thirty minutes per episode of family enjoyment.,1325376000,23,344,4.0588235294117645
4456059,5,B004QVMHZA,"Having purchased this dvd,all I can say is that, I'm very glad I did. I had never seen this show before. But being a western fan and also having seen Gene Barry in The Name of the Game and Burke's Law,I bought it. This is one classic TV series and you get the entire series which ran for three seasons. The picture quality is good,even when watching on a 50"" inch TV for a series this old. I was certainly hooked watching 10 episodes each night to the annoyance of a certain person who will remain nameless.
Anybody thinking about buying this DVD should do so. You won't be disappointed.",1317859200,43,587,4.345454545454546
4456060,4,B004QVMHZA,"This Bat Masterson series was a childhood favourite for me and my father on Saturday nights.  It brings back fond memories.

It is black and white but the quality is superior on disc than we ever got over the analog airwaves.

The 30 minute episodes are the ideal length for relaxing before bedtime.

I am pleased it is still possible to purchase these old series.

4456062,5,B004QVMHZA,"This series based on the real life adventures of Bat Masterson, Is not only well done, but still holds up after all these years. If you grew up during the 50's and 60's you'll be glad you revisited Bat & friends, If you're not old enough to have seen it when it was new, give it a chance. You'll be pleasently surprised!",1372464000,,320,4.17741935483871
4456063,1,B004QVMHZA,"This is not intended to be a maliscious review but, fans should be warned to avoid this particular set. Bat Masterson 11 DVD SET contains, without a doubt, the poorest-quality , new dvd's I've ever encountered. This is ATI brand which has fuzzy images, blurred to the point of not being able to distinguish detail if characters are in dark clothing, the voices are way out of sync too. Overall: really bad and would be a definite dissappointment to anybody. I already had Season 1, made by MGM which truly is re-mastered and is excellent quality. I thought it would be nice to have all the seasons in one. Seasons 2 and 3 are available in the excellent-quality MGM dvds. Seller had the gaul to tell me that ""it may be my opinion but...?"" As though I don't know quality? Sorry, but, I've bought used dvd's at pawn shops with marks on them that play and sound better. Received a refund (less shipping) so, overall, not pleasant. Any true fan of period TV would definitely not enjoy these dvd's.",1371772800,,992,4.5474860335195535
4456064,5,B004QVMHZA,"Great! Just as I remembered from years gone by. I like that is in order, easy to watch one or more episodes at a time.",1370649600,,118,3.76
4456065,4,B004QVMHZA,The episodes are just as I remember them.  What a nice nostalgic trip down memory lane. This is a nice addition to the DVD library.,1368230400,,131,4.24
4456066,4,B004QVMHZA,"What is there to say except it's a wonderful trip down memory lane.
Thoroughly enjoyable for all of us baby boomers.",1367020800,,116,4.571428571428571
4456067,5,B004QVMHZA,"if you liked the old TV westerns, this one is a must have.  i've seen only a few episodes so far, but the picture quality is unbelievable.  50 yrs ago, all i could see was a small picture, with constant ""snow"", while i held the attenna for a ""better"" picture.  watching on these DVD's is now like watching it in 3D!",1363996800,,315,4.131147540983607
4456068,2,B004QVMHZA,Chinese knock-off. Picture quality poor compared to more legitimate DVD's. Don't waste your money. Go for the episodes by season and you will be much happier. 30 bucks down the drain. Don't know what the other reviews are talking about when they talk about good picture quality. I own some of the other DVD's and there is no comparison in terms of picture quality.,1363910400,3,364,4.703125
4456069,5,B004QVMHZA,I love old westerns and the characters they represented.  The quality is well prepared and the story lines I always liked.  PLH,1363564800,,127,4.7272727272727275
4456070,5,B004QVMHZA,"The disc labeling, CD book labeling is very well done.  The overall contrast and brightness of each episode is too high yet I can turn it down at the TV. Did you know that Gene Barry was alive until just a few years ago?  Very likable series.  Glen Pickle Sunday, March 17",1363478400,,272,4.1923076923076925
4456071,5,B004QVMHZA,"Brought back a lot of old memories....Enjoyed them very much, were good quality...would recomend them for all old western lovers..",1363132800,,130,5.55
4456072,5,B004QVMHZA,"After waiting for what seemed like years for the newer version of this series to be released, I finally canceled that order and opted to take a chance on this one. Not only was I not disappointed with the quality of this set, but once I realized this one had every single episode of the series, I became one happy camper. The newer version that is still out of stock on Amazon only seems to have one or two seasons. At under 30 bucks for this one, my decision was a no brainer.
Bat Masterson is one of those westerns that will remain a classic until the end of time and can never be duplicated by any of the newer shows on TV today.",1360627200,,632,4.104838709677419
4456073,4,B004QVMHZA,I liked the sahow very much and grew up watching it. I would recommend it to all western fans and feel it is a classic western tv series.,1360368000,,137,3.9285714285714284
4456074,2,B004QVMHZA,"All the reviews were quite convincing that the quality of these episodes were extremely good, but after having watched the first disk i am bewildered by people's claims. The film quality is not better than what cable's western encore station showed, they slipped in and out of degrees of clarity and the ending credits go back and forth in picture size as though a zoom button was employed and turned off and pressed again. I wanted the series because i have fond memories of watching it as a child and every time I hear the song it gives me and warm and fuzzy feeling. And Gene Barry is...well Gene Barry. I have top notch equipment which elevates dvd quality but it couldn't perform any miracles. If you decide to buy it because other reviewers say the newly issued individual series sets by a different company are truly terrible be forewarned about this complete series set........This is why fans of old tv westerns should appreciate what Paramount has done with Gunsmoke and provided fans with the most prisitine looking film quality.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodspiller-Book-One-Warriors-of-Palahia-Series/dp/B007055JQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodspiller: Book One: Warriors of Palahia Series</a>",1360108800,5,1254,5.64021164021164

4456076,1,B004QVMHZA,"I bought this after watching several episodes on hulu.  The quality of the images is far lower than that on hulu.  For example, during the credits, much of the text is such a blur that it can not be read.  On hulu, it is quite legible.  The credits are not so important, but the rest of the video has images that are just as fuzzy.  It looks like this was copied from a 260 line video.  Even the title of the DVD and the ""FBI warning"" are of poor quality.

The sound is not synchronized with the video, making it very annoying to watch.  Worst of all, parts of it have been cropped to a smaller size.  I will return this for a refund.  Perhaps I will purchase&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bat-Masterson-TV-Series-24-Hour-Marathon-Collection/dp/B009CZTFY6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bat Masterson TV Series (24 Hour Marathon Collection)</a>&nbsp;instead, even though it does not contain all episodes.

Had no idea what to expect but I have to say the quality of the episodes were really good and watching these brings back memories I had long since forgotten.
