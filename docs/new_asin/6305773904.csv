1071215,4,6305773904,"When I was growing up I remember being glued to the set every Sunday morning watching the Flash Gordon serials on WGN in Chicago.  These episodes were great sci-fi back then and I was thrilled to find them again on DVD.  With a little trepidation I started showing the episodes to the kids, ages 9, 6, and 4.  I have been amazed how much they enjoy it.  We are watching two episodes every Saturday night.  The kids line up on the couch, watch it with complete attention, and hate having to wait a whole week to see the next episode.  It has really been fun for the kids.  My wife and I really enjoy it, too.  The special effects are dated, but really, the action and story carry you along and it is a lot of fun to watch.  For us, watching the old fashioned special effects are a blast, and for the kids the simple effects are plenty of fun to watch.
One thing that has made the series fun to watch is that we have only been watching two episodes at a time.  Each episode is full of action, and watching them all at once would probably be less enjoyable.  These episodes were originally shown one episode a week back in the 1930's.  Each episode ends at a cliffhanger, so you really want to see the next episode.  It is interesting to imagine the millions of people that went each week to the movies to see each episode.
We have finished watching the first serial, Flash Gordon - Space soldiers, are enjoying this series now, and look forward to watching the following, Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe.  At this rate, it will take almost a year of to watch the series.  What a great way this is to enjoy time with the kids.  I think it is great that a movie series over 60 years old stands up so well.
The only reason to give it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the print used has little specks and a few sound glitches that might have been cleaned up with modern digital techniques.  By the way, to clear up any confusion from the reviews, this product ASIN=6305773904 contains all the original episodes.  It is not an edited version.",1034985600,14,2034,4.293963254593176
1071216,5,6305773904,"I just received my copy of the uncut FLASH GORDON'S TRIP TO MARS in the mail yesterday, and was really impressed.  I grew up with the Buster Crabbe serials, seeing a single episode each day, and looking forward to the following Monday, when the next exciting episode would play.  How I loved the gilded, swashbuckling Flash, the kindly Dr. Zarkov and the exquisite Dale Arden.  I was also extremely fond of the great MING THE MERCILOUS, played with relish by Charles Middleton.  Knowing how he scared me as a child, I can only imagine how he spooked the kids on Saturday afternoons, when the serials played on the big screen.
All that aside, this is FLASH GORDON'S TRIP TO MARS as it is meant to be seen:  complete and uncut, and with a beautiful, clear print.  True, it doesn't have all the ""bells and whistles"" that people expect with DVDs, but it doesn't need them.  This edition is gorgeous.
I do have a warning for you, though.  There are many ""versions"" out there, and a good many of them are butchered to fit a 90 minute time frame.  If you want to see this classic as Universal meant it to be seen, get this COMPLETE AND UNCUT version.  It's well worth the extra money.",1030492800,12,1177,4.457943925233645
1071217,4,6305773904,"This DVD contains 15 20 minute chapters in their original serial format. I found the experience to be a lot of fun to watch, with it's old school sets and effects, stock footage, and action filled storyline. Universal produced the series, and you'll even hear music from their other films used -- at one point I heard the main theme from BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN -- which adds to the fun for film buffs. Serials are a part of the golden age of the movie house and hold a very important part in our cinema history. Check this out - you may be surprised how much you'll enjoy it.",970531200,4,574,4.324074074074074
1071218,5,6305773904,"Following Flash Gordon's original adventures in 'Space Soldiers' (also available on DVD), 1930's cinema goers were treated to this sequel - 'Flash Gordon's Trip To Mars'. All the regulars are back in action for a mamoth  15-part extravaganza. There are slight changes for this serial; Jean Rogers  is now a brunette not a blonde and the story takes place on Mars instead of  Mongo (not that you'd notice the difference). But fortunately some things  never change. If, like me, you remember watching these classic serials  during the school holidays you'll know that the combination of 'Buster  Crabbe' and 'Flash Gordon' guarantees excitement, adventure and fun - and  on this DVD you get 5 hours worth! Although Image Entertainment have not  added any special features, the picture quality is excellent. So if you're  a Flash Gordon fan this is certainly one for your collection.",962150400,5,880,5.0979020979020975
1071219,4,6305773904,"""Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars"" is the second serial of theoriginal Flash Gordon films.  The film picks up at the end of""Flash Gordon Space Solders."" (Please note that each of the Flash Gordon films has been renamed and reedited numerous times.) The second series of chapters, 15 in all, are of a better quality then the first 12 chapters.  The story picks up with the heroes returning from Mongo.  The Earth is thrown into peril once again and Dr. Zarkoff.  Flash and his friends must return to space once again to save the world.  Ming is back as well.  He some how managed to escape death at the end of the first serial and has moved his evil plans to Mars.  I didn't really like the whole Mars thing.  Knowing want we know about Mars today makes the whole story a little silly.  But hay, this film was made at a time when the Red Planet still held a lot of mystery.  So, we now know there are not any cities on Mars, you can still enjoy the movie. Buster Crabbe, who plays Flash, is much more secure in his acting.  He speaks more, and is more proactive.  I liked the character a lot better in this film.  In the first serial Flash spent most of his him getting jumped on and being forced to defend himself.  In this film, Flash plans attacks and fights when he know he has too.  There is a lot of stock footage and a few flash backs to the first serial that pad out the film.  This was a way to save money on the meager $175,000 budget, half of what they spent on the first serial.  The return of all the same actors from the first film help the movie as well.  For the third series the studio replaced Dale and Barin with new actors.  The best part about this film and the previous one is the way that is displayed.  This DVD has all 15 chapters just as they were shown in the theaters.  Each as a title and introduction.  They sum up the last chapter and then end with a cliffhanger.  It is a lot of fun to watch a serial.  The many other Flash Gordon titles are simply these same films recut as feature films.  This DVD has all the footage as it was originally released. Larry ""Buster"" Crabbe played in many films, but really made the role of Flash Gordon special.  He often can be found in westerns, and even played Tarzan in one film.  He does a fine job on this film and pulls off the ""All American Hero"" better then anyone really should.  I had not seen his work, but know I am a fan. Jean Rogers, who plays Dale, is a really cute girl next door. I have to say, I liked her blond hair in the first film, but the comic strip inspired hair change takes nothing away from her beauty.  Dale does not have a lot to do in this serial, but she does manage to move a little away from the totally dependent Dale of the first films. Ming is even more evil as he should be.  In the first film he sat around a lot and gave orders.  In this film Ming is more active. He fights, shoots a ray gun, and even captures Flash Gordon by himself.  Charles Middleton makes a great Ming and will have you plotting your own evil plans before the film is done.  He makes the picture a lot of fun. You will notice a few bad spots in the film. The film is from 1938, so you have to chalk the flaws up to its age. Plus the flaws give the DVD character.  The cheesy voice over will draw a laugh as well as the special effects.  The ""Bat Wings"" are a great idea.  The dolls that flew with them almost looked like.... well they looked like dolls. Buy this film and brush up on some film history as you enjoy some great science fiction!",954979200,45,3514,4.123711340206185
1071291,4,6305773904,"From certain standpoints, this serial is superior to the 1st Flash Gordon chapter-play. The available prints are and photography are generally of better quality, some of the special effects are superior, there are certain exotic space novelties, like the Clay People's subway to the queen's palace and the light bridge, and there are some interesting and creepy visuals in the Forest Kingdom. Also, Flash and Dr. Zarkhov get to wear long pants. Dale Arden and Prince Barrin are played by the same fine actors as in the 1st serial. And one of the best highlights is the surprisingly effective special effect of showing the Clay People kind of 'ooze' out of the cave walls.

From other standpoints, however, this one is not quite as good as the 1st. This is one of the longer movie serials, and it could probably have been shortened by about 3 chapters, if some of the back-and-forth removed. Also, there are not as many fight scenes as in the 1st serial, and no sword fights. And apparently, the Hays Office must have finally gotten a look at Dale and Princess Aura's outfits from the 1st serial, because, to my dismay, Dale is fully dressed throughout every chapter. There are no bare midriffs and she appears have worn a bra in every scene. Just as sad, there is no Princess Aura, who was a wonderful character and helped amp up the sex in the 1st Flash serial.

Nonetheless, if you are one of those quirky or nostalgic types who enjoy movie serials, you will enjoy this. There certainly was no greater movie serial hero than Flash Gordon as played by Buster Crabbe, and there certainly was no greater villain than Charles Middleton's portrayal of Ming the Merciless. Besides top-notch heroism and villainy, this serial features plenty of fantasy and space opera, and something is always happening.

This serial premiered at the height of a zeitgeist peculiar to the 1930's. The concept of the super-hero had risen to the foreground of pop culture. Although the term super-hero had been coined around 1918, probably in reference to Tarzen of the Apes, the 1930's saw an explosion of super-heroes in pulp magazines, radio shows, newspaper funnies, film and serials, and finally comic magazines. The Lone Ranger, the Green Hornet, the Shadow, Flash Gordon, Doc Savage, and of course Superman, all premiered in the 1930's and all were huge commodities at the time.

The opening chapter of this serial features a newspaper headline shot referring to Flash, Zarkhov and Dale as 'Super-Men of the Century.' The term 'superman' could still be used without fear of a lawsuit by DC comics; this serial was released in March 1938, about a month before the 1st issue of Action Comics, featuring the copyrighted Superman, hit the newsstands.

Also noteworthy: the Martians and our heroes sometimes utilize Martian 'flying capes,' which look a lot like a bat's wings. The comic book character Batman premiered a year after this serial, in 1939, looking very much like our hero wearing a flying cape and helmet. (Superman himself would not actually 'fly' until about 1942 or so; in 1938 he could only take prodigious leaps.) In this serial, Flash (along with many other characters), wears a shirt with a stylized lightning bolt across the chest. This lightning bolt looked very much like the symbol adorning the chest of the comic book character Captain Marvel, whose magazines outsold those of Superman, and who would premiere in 1940. A lesser character named 'The Flash' also premiered in 1940, and he also wore a shirt with a lightning bolt insignia (this 'Flash' character would not reach his real fame until the late 1950's, however).

A few months after this serial premiered, on Halloween 1938, Orson Welles broadcast his legendary 'War of the Worlds' radio play, which panicked half the country with a realistic tale of a Martian invasion. The infamy of this play helped draw audiences to see a re-released version of this serial, albeit cut and edited into a feature length movie, that was shown in late 1938.

The fact that this serial takes place on Mars is an anomaly: the original Alex Raymond Flash Gordon story upon which it is based took place entirely on the fictional planet Mongo, which is also the setting for the other 2 Flash serials. Indeed, as of 1938, the comic strip Flash had never been to Mars. Nothing survives to inform the modern film historian as to the reason for changing the setting to Mars.

However, it is known that virtuoso animators the Fleischer Bros. were, prior to this serial, working on a full color animated version of Edgar Rice Burroughs enormously popular space opera ""John Carter of Mars."" Some test footage for this project survives, and if the film had been completed, the final product would have indeed been immensely spectacular. I speculate that it is possible that Universal changed the setting of the Flash Gordon story to Mars so as to place themselves in advance into a position that might favor them should they start copyright infringement litigation against the Fleischers. Indeed, in the absence of good information, this potential threat might even be the reason the Fleischers abandoned the John Carter project.

Regardless of my speculation, Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars remains a fun, interesting, well-crafted in its own way, and a fine trip into the popular consciousness of the late 1930's.",1260230400,,5348,4.913621262458472
1071292,5,6305773904,"Of the three Flash Gordon serials, the Trip to Mars is my favorite.  Ming, for unexplained reasons has escaped death on Mongo and landed on Mars [which bears an uncanny resemblence to planet Mongo]. He is nasty as ever. I really, really hate that Ming!
  I have a confession, however. I am really, really in love with Azura, Queen of Magic! [I don't want that to get around]!
  For some reason, she presented me with my first prepubertal sexual awakening.  I was eight.  It may have been her glacial beauty, her imperious disdain or her ability to turn grown men to clay and vanish on the spot. I don't know.
  She died in chapter 13.  It's an ignominious death in a tacky suburb of Mars.  Even worse, it was at the hands of her own guards.  I only know, had I been there, it would have turned out differently!
  The computer has presented me with magic beyond her dreams.  I could obtain this DVD and perform a search for my Queen.
  Queen Azura was played by Beatrice Roberts.  The actress was born in Manhattan in 1905.  As a young woman she entered several beauty contests including Miss America.  She had a short term marriage to Robert Ripley [Believe It or Not], and a long term dalliance with Louis B. Mayer [MGM]. She appeared in a string of grade B [maybe C] movies, often uncredited.
  I still bear a torch for her.  In truth she would be as old as my grandmother.  On the screen, however, she retains a regal appeal.
  Beatrice Roberts vanished finally into obscurity and apparently is buried in Plymouth, Massachusetts near my hometown.  If I ever find her grave I'll stop and plant some violets.",1203120000,6,1609,4.496527777777778
1071293,3,6305773904,"Though an entertaining serial, ""Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars"" (1938) occasionally falters due to obvious padding and unnecessary comic relief. Luckily, Buster Crabbe and Charles Middleton resume their intergalactic battle in the classic Saturday Matinee tradition  highlighted by the memorable presence of the Clay People. The action-packed finale has a rousing vitality not evident in the previous chapters. Worth seeing, but definitely the weakest of Universal's Flash Gordon trilogy.",1202083200,14,485,6.028985507246377

1071295,5,6305773904,This was truly the for runner for Star Wars and Star Trek.  The special effects look very simple by todays standards. But I am still amazed by how the Clay People come to life out of the walls in the caves. It has great villains in Ming and the Tree People.  I can only imagine how great this Serial looked in 1938 when fans went to the movies on Saturdays to see the next 20 minute chapter.,1193270400,,391,4.064935064935065
1071296,4,6305773904,"These fifteen episodes, twenty minutes each, add up to a five-hour marathon of popcorn-worthy swashbuckling. It's based on Alex Raymond's comic strip from that pre-WWII era that now looks like such an Eden of innocence. It wasn't, of course, but they didn't know it back then.

Queen Azura of Mars has waged war on the clay people, who seem condemned to live their shambling lives away from the sun, in prison uniforms and itchy-looking rubber masks. Evil Ming the Merciless falsely befriends her, to take advantage of her mystic command of the White Opal. It is a gem that grants her magical powers and looks pretty good on with her perpetual evening gown. Somewhere along the line the good guy's gal, Dale Arden, also doffs her lab coat and spends the rest of the flick running through forests and caves in an evening gown of her own - more sparkly, and more dramatic about the bodice. Then there's Prince Barin, standing proud in his armored chestplate and shortie bloomers. And Ming, with a little arrow pasted onto his skullcap.

Well, ignore the costumes (and the plot, if you can). Instead, drink in the tubby little strato-sleds as they soar through the air, flatulent with drooping sparks and drifting wreaths of smoke. Or the wonderful labs, generally bare except for a few ominous Erlenmeyers and a Jacob's ladder or two, or more. Or the ray guns that look mostly like little cookie presses with the handle bent sideways.

It's great stuff. My childhood was, I admit, as close to the series's 1938 date as to this writing, or closer. It was wonderful, stirring adventure back then. It still is, if you can see it with innocent-enough eyes. If not, it's the epitome of camp, only better for being so un-self-conscious. And people don't have bloody fights and do keep their clothes on, so tender sensibilities need not worry.

1071300,4,6305773904,"A modern day approach to this classic from the past cannot do justice when compared to the attitude and actions of the American audience in the 1930's. I interviewed people who lived through the experience as teens when they went to the movies to see ""Flash Gordon Goes to Mars"". The response can only be compared to the excitement level generated by ""Indiana Jones"" or ""Star Wars"". People were looking for escape. Flash Gordon provided the vehicle to take them away. Despite special effects that look silly today, people were thrilled with them in the 30's. The monsters were scary and the idea of life on Mars with ""Clay people"" filled them with fear. One fact you should keep in mind. The largest money maker in the movies was not the best picture in 1938 or any other of that year,it was a re-hash of ""FLASH GORDON"". Audiences talked about the adventures of Flash as we would today of ""Indy"". This DVD is a nice piece of work and the copy lets you relax. It is typical stuff from the 30's and characters such as newsmen, scientists, government officials and butlers can be expected to behave like the idiots  Hollywood portrayed them back then. This series of ""Flash"" was cheaply produced but made a fortune in the movies.
