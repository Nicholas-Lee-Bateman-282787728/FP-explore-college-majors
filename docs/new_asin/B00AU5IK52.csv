5510169,4,B00AU5IK52,"While I don't listen to Dennis Prager much on the radio,(I like learning CD's in the car), I do appreciate his commentary. So much so that I've paid to hear him speak here in Sacramento and have driven to San Francisco twice to see him deliver a speech. We've never been disappointed with his presentations, so when the movie came out on DVD I bought six and loved it and so have those who've received it as a gift. A modern day Thomas Paine, Pragers ""Common Sense"" resonates with todays challenges. The movie is a fair sampling delivered in a very entertaining format, one that will be watched again and again.",1358294400,2,611,4.513513513513513

5510171,5,B00AU5IK52,"As with many things of value, this Diamond-in-the-rough starts slowly but soon develops into a warm, sincere, and deeply thought-provoking movie.  It is one of the best documentaries I've ever watched, well worth the price!!!!  I bought 10 copies when it first came out and gave them to friends, who were almost without exception very impressed!!!!",1358294400,10,348,5.196428571428571
5510172,5,B00AU5IK52,"Good story, well told of a passionate political player, Paul Croshaw. who heard and then followed a random voice on the radio and remembered an old promise he had made to seek God. It turned his life upside down and could have the same effect on others who view the Democratic Party and the left in general as the way to Utopia. That random voice was Dennis Prager  and as a 25+ year listener of one I consider to be among the intellectual and moral elites of all time, I can say Mr. Croshaw captures the message and like Paul the Apostle, he has become an evangelist of what is right and what is Divine.",1358294400,5,604,4.252173913043478
5510173,5,B00AU5IK52,"Paul Croshaw's independent film, ""Baseball, Dennis & The French,"" certainly must be judged as the best political biography to appear since David Horowitz's Radical Son. Additionally, it must be praised for its particular courage in putting onto celluloid the grand themes that have been judged ""radioactive"" to the ethos of an increasingly secular film Industry. What begins as a young boy's desire for acceptance (and a flirtation with divine providence) soon opens up as a robust inquiry into the roots of: the American Founding, our Cultural and Political Exceptionalism, and a reasoned apologetic into the existential Crisis of the West- which in the process of losing its Judeo-Christian values, risks the diminution of its distinctive joy and unique character as a benevolent force in a darkening world.

  Using the root theme of baseball as its Archimedean point, Paul takes us on an odyssey wherein the subterranean lessons of the workaday world etch an incremental and inexorable metamorphosis on the author. There is no ""Damascus Moment"" here, just a slow awakening from the dream of unchallenged opinion through knowledge to slow epiphany of wisdom. Guided on his pilgrimage by media figure Dennis Prager, Croshaw's constant muse, (or should it be Siren?) Prager launches his powerful rhetorical skills in drawing Paul to a return to our soul's and civilization's First Principles.

  Indeed, Mr. Prager's inspiring and honest persuasiveness anchors the film's expansive worldview and primal thesis: That American greatness is intrinsically linked to its goodness, and that its goodness is inextricable bound to America's apprehension of Judeo-Christian ethical monotheism.  While other cultures have grasped only parts of the whole, The Bible, the West's moral loadstone, both imparts and has sustained the Judeo-Christian epistemological foundation of: a knowable rational nature, an enlightened and transcendent justice, and of a personal God that takes a loving interest in both the moral cultivation and the tragic sufferings of his creation. It is within this backdrop that Croshaw demonstrates how a disenchanting secularism has opened a rift between the European and American ethos, and that we follow the Continental Post-Modern philosophies to our own moral peril.

  In his transformation from Liberal Doctrines to the Deep Mystery of the Cross, Mr. Croshaw has rounded the metaphorical bases of life into his mature world view, and as such, his self-discovery is the vindication and ultimate fulfillment of a young boy from Rowland Heights' dream of a single home run. Through his nuanced craft, Croshaw has squared the proverbial circle by melding an incredibly persuasive and substantive message with the hallowed memories of Childhood that we each treasure within us.  The author has given religious Americans a poetic and convincing vehicle to transmit the rationality and gravity of our values to both the secular and to our youth: who are increasingly becoming ethical blank slates. If you are fortunate enough to catch Mr. Croshaw's film, I think you will agree that he has achieved an emotional and philosophical tour de force--the equivalent of a Conservative Grand Slam.",1358035200,19,3204,5.426559356136821
5510174,4,B00AU5IK52,"I saw movie at theater and purchased dvd. Showed dvd to friends. It's a great tool to explain why we are conservatives, why our belief in God is reflected in our support for this great Christian-based, constitutional government. Thanks for this astute, reflective and informative story on the impact the Judeo Christian values had on the development of our great nation. It's a very enjoyable film, my friends and I love it!",1358380800,,424,4.902777777777778
5510175,5,B00AU5IK52,"I've been listening to Dennis on the radio for about 6 years now. He is so wise with such a great moral compass. I wish he was an uncle that I could call for advice or see around the holidays to chat with about God, politics and life in general. When I heard about the movie being released, I bought 2 copies on the first day it was available.  One for me and one to use as a loaner to friends and family. I had no doubt it would disappoint and it didn't.

I loved the explanation Dennis gave the 3 young girls about profanity and all the other great words of wisdom he provided.  Paul Croshaw did a very decent job showing us his life's transition from a liberal to conservative, all due to ""uncle"" Dennis.  No movie is 100% perfect genius. If I had to comment on any flaws, I would say that the scene with the clown and French dialogue is a bit long.

It's been a couple months since I've watched it.  Think it's time for another viewing this weekend!",1358380800,,953,4.1521739130434785
5510176,5,B00AU5IK52,"Baseball, Dennis & and the French.  A movie all should have in their collection.  It will make you laugh, cry but most of all ""Think"".  I believe evryone can relate to this movie at one time or another in your life and Paul has put it on film. God Bless Baseball, Dennis & the French.",1358380800,,284,4.127272727272727
5510177,5,B00AU5IK52,"Dennis Prager is an very inspirational person with insights that will lead a person into some serious thinking.  I want all of my friends, and antagonists, to see this movie.",1358380800,,174,4.8
5510178,5,B00AU5IK52,We loved this. I have enjoyed listened to Dennis Prager for years and discovered him quite by accident. It was so fun to experience it again through this movie and laugh out loud with Paul during it!,1358380800,,199,4.405405405405405
5510179,4,B00AU5IK52,"The other reviewers have pointed out well the merits of this thoughtful documentary. I would add that this was also entertaining and as Paul's story unfolds, one is carried along in discovery with him. Satisfying film that made me smile. Definitely recommend!",1358294400,,259,5.190476190476191
5510180,5,B00AU5IK52,"Very insightful.  Important topics.  Humor kept the viewing light, but there're  very important lessons to be aware of (whether one agrees or not).  Should be shown to all young people.  (Most older people would love it!)",1358294400,,221,5.027777777777778
5510181,4,B00AU5IK52,"There is a somewhat ""passing"" statement made in this film about why Mr. Croshaw went through all the trouble of creating it. I suspect this reason may actually be his most compelling purpose. Conjecture on my part, for sure, but motives like these are important. In my opinion, this film is an attempt to reason with his father, and to some extent with his brother, over the existence of a creator God who has made himself known to man. Look, many of us are truly concerned for the world-at-large, and there are plenty of things mentioned in the film that address these macro issues, however, when you love your parents and family and you believe there is something potentially separating your destinies in a profound manner, it is a incredible motivator and a noble cause to right such a separation.

***** - for the content and intent (Really, this kind of information should be what we all should be analyzing and debating about.)
-1 * because I am a film buff and need to reserve five stars for films that are also technically and/or artistically off the charts.",1358294400,,1066,4.670212765957447
5510182,5,B00AU5IK52,"Funny, deep, and indeed a story almost everyone who grew up in North American suburbia in the '60s, '70s and '80s can relate to. It's also a great introduction to Dennis Prager, whose unique style and brilliant mind has converted thousands like Paul Croshaw from uneasiness and endless searching, to happiness in life.",1358294400,,318,5.018867924528302
5510183,5,B00AU5IK52,"Loved it.  It was so much like my life growing up where we all wonder if God is real.  We create little tests for him to prove himself.  I love the insight into the thinking of both democrats and republicans.  The audience cheered at the end, the first in a long time that I have attended.",1358294400,3,289,4.107142857142857

8557818,5,B00AU5IK52,"I watched this documentary movie for the second time. I love foreign films, the arts and critical thinking. I enjoyed Paul's political point of view from an early age. i.e. Why would anyone be a Republican? It was very funny! This is a film I would like to give to some of the liberal, progressive people I know. I'm interested in their response. I loved this fim!",1400630400,3,364,4.447761194029851
8557819,5,B00AU5IK52,"Great product, Great radio speaker, great message, Thanks, I will buy again. I certainly recommend it. Always learning from Dennis are great.",1385164800,,141,5.454545454545454
8557820,3,B00AU5IK52,"Came in a reasonable amount of time.  Some issues with quality of DVD since I had some problems with skipping of DVD,",1379203200,,117,4.318181818181818
8557821,3,B00AU5IK52,"Entertaining tribute to Dennis Prager and the impact he had on Paul Croshaw. Mr. Croshaw came from a liberal background and a family of atheists, but listening to Prager gradually made him rethink all his values. He is now a conservative and has turned many of his family members around.

The film is a bit noisy, but it is always good-humored.",1375142400,2,344,4.639344262295082
8557822,5,B00AU5IK52,"I have listened to Dennis Prager's radio show for quite some time. I really appreciate his reasoning and logic. I also enjoy his never-ending pursuit of clarity.

I am strong in my Christian faith, but there are many people that I care deeply about that have very little or no faith. This bothers me greatly, so I continue to look for various means and methods to ""gently"" begin a dialog that - hopefully - will at least begin to penetrate the ""wall"" of dogmatic refusal to even entertain the thought that there may indeed something bigger than their intellect that's worth believing in. Even if they can't ""prove"" it.

This video delivers that as only Dennis can.",1368489600,,664,4.666666666666667
8557823,5,B00AU5IK52,"My Political views slant slightly to the right of center, therefore I was a little apprehensive about the subject matter of the film. Boy, was I pleasantly surprized!
  Dennis, Baseball and the French is a story that many of us have traveled in one way or another as we move through life. You can put yourself in Paul Croshaw's shoes and his quest for answers to what is actually important.
  My thoughts of Dennis Prager prior to viewing the film was that he was way to far to the right for my beliefs. Again, was I pleasently surprized! His intelligence and verbal skills are entertaining and enlightening.
  Prager's narrative as to what it means to be an American, to beleive in a higher power and to just adhere plain old fashioned values should hit home with anyyone. Anyone that wants to be a better person, parent and friend.
  Get off the couch and get this film. Then get back on the couch and watch it. Then watch it again and invite some friends.

8557824,4,B00AU5IK52,"I'm not exclusively conservative nor exclusively liberal. (Confusing to many, I'm sure.) I wasn't sure what to expect when I first sat down to watch Baseball, Dennis and the French.  I'll admit I knew very little about Dennis Prager. But I must say that this film really surprised me.  While portraying a conservative message, the movie at no time (I felt) went for cheap shots, alienation or name-calling.  I didn't feel it was overtly political at all. Instead was a message that I could understand, at times relate, and support.  Nothing's perfect and I may have had one or two moments where I took a slight apprehension, but the great thing about Prager is he always explains where he is coming from (something less and less people do I find).  After Prager would explain his reasoning or justify a particular sentiment, I would at least understand his point--even if I didn't completely agree.  I quickly passed this recommendation along to friends (of varying beliefs).  I think this movie creates a nice bridge between the two (often warring) sides.",1360195200,11,1056,4.898876404494382
8557825,5,B00AU5IK52,"I love baseball, I love listening to Dennis on the radio, I love Paris and all things French so this was a cornucopia of cinematic delights for me. I grew up Catholic but became a standard-issue secular liberal fairly early in college, and from that point my journey has closely paralleled Paul's journey. A journey from self-infatuated, ""liberated"" secular man and progressive Democrat (who applauded Hanoi Jane and thought that the only wrong with the Vietnam War was that we were on the wrong side), to a truly open-minded, sober thinking and much more joyous Christian. Still liberal on some economic issues but conservative on foreign policy and social issues.

But enough about me! :- ) Paul's story is sometimes funny, sometimes challenging and always riveting. The movie cuts back and forth seamlessly between his story and Dennis' warmth and wit and wisdom. It has a beautiful flow and I loved it all the way.

Dennis Prager has played such a huge role in my intellectual and spiritual growth, and it was an empowering revelation to come across this movie! Thank you, Paul for making it!
