8623701,5,B005AJJPIE,"Barry Kneller has created a gem in his debut feature. Writing and starring in the indie production, Kneller has created a lead character, named ,""Lemon"" who is at the lower end of 'the ladder' of life. He is a fix-it man for the owner of low-rent apartments. On his trip to work, he befriends a newly-homeless vet, who lost his benefits due to a screw-up by the VA. This man provides the camaraderie and encouragement to Lemon, to strive for a better job. In this quest, Lemon encounters a number of people, some of whom, will play an important role in his life.
With a cast that includes veteran actors Dan Lauria, best know from ""The Wonder Years"", Beth Grant, who deliciously played the cranky pageant lady in ,""Little Miss Sunshine"", plus Rachel Miner, Willie C. Carpenter, and Boston-based, Brian O'Hara, the story is revealed in a way that most people can relate to; we are all a few paychecks away from being homeless or worse. It is an uplifting story, without melodrama. Watch for a cameo appearance by Barry's white chihuahua, ""George"". Beautifully photographed using the Red camera system, this will be remembered as Kneller's career blossoms.",1310774400,5,1154,4.833333333333333
