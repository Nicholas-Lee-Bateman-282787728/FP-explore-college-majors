4567140,4,B0054ECI7A,"Purchased as a gift for my mother who saw this movie when it came out and fell in love with it. While the quality of the DVD was not great, it did give her a chance to go down memory lane. I realize the quality of the original film may have deteriorated over the years contributing to not as ""picture perfect"" we are accustomed to seeing in this digital age. I am puzzled why this remake in 1951 was priced at nearly $20 while the original title filmed in 1932 was sold for $4.99. Mom wanted the 1951 version and it took several months of research before finding it.",1446508800,3,566,4.201834862385321

4567145,5,B0054ECI7A,"I just finished watching the DVD ""Bird of Paradise"" that I ordered from Amazon.
I don't know why some other people who gave it bad reviews say the quality of the transfer is poor.  The quality of the film is just fine and the ending of the movie is intact. The color was rich. Of course it's not going to be exactly like on the big screen but for being home watching on my TV it was very good.

If you like this movie it's worth the buy. If you have never seen it, this is a tragic love story about the romance between an island girl and a Frenchman played by the the handsome LouIs Jourdan.

I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it and I am so happy to own it now.",1440892800,2,679,3.9057971014492754

4567150,1,B0054ECI7A,"I love this movie and wish I had been able to keep it but ended up having to return it because it does not have closed captioning or subtitles.  Due to unfortunate hearing loss, watching movies that aren't closed captioned or subtitled is nothing but an exercise if frustration.  I wish this particular movie was captioned because I love it and would have liked to have watched it again.  I first saw it as a child on the classics channel and have been waiting for it to be released on DVD.  If you don't need captioning or subtitles, it's a great flick.  If you do, like me, you'll be disappointed.  I wish this problem would be resolved for those of us who need captioning.",1428710400,,675,4.403225806451613

4567166,5,B0054ECI7A,"Actually while I wish it were a pressed disk not a DVD-R paper and dye one by one product.  But, I think most of these bad reviews are complaining about the dark night and indoor sequences.  Anybody who has been in the tropics can see this filming as quite naturalistic (extreme color and brilliance to dark) and I think it was intended as such.  People tend to forget that on such an island at such a time there were only oil lamps and torches mostly for fishing.  Seeing it on TV (in black and white) in the 60's as a 8 year old boy I really felt heartstuck by Debra Paget and never forgot it and looked for years for it (what it was and how to buy it).  Seeing it now I appreciate the well researched way the Polynesians were shown and while a bit too modest for me it was well done and gave me just a tingle of slipping into childhood feelings of far away places and romance.  I always wished I could save women from their volcanos of pain and self hurt but it is not possible.",1415318400,,981,4.109947643979058

4567187,3,B0054ECI7A,"While not a great film, the acting by Jeff Chandler and Louis Jourdan makes this enjoyable to watch.  The movie is entertaining because of the venue and supporting cast.  Debra Paget is lovely in this film, even though she was not an outstanding actress.
Yet, there is a certain chemistry between her and Louis Jourdan that appeals to the viewer.  The plot is almost predictable, and
the ending something Hollywood liked to do often in deeply romantic films.",1399075200,,458,4.846153846153846
4567188,5,B0054ECI7A,"My 5-star rating is because I am so happy to finally have a copy of this movie, which was one of my all-tme favorites.  I have to disagree with the reviewers who say the color is not good, too dark, etc. etc.  There are a few spots that are rather dark, but as I recall those spots were dark in the original film.  The sound is excellent, the Hawaiian location shots are beautiful, the music and dancing are lovely (Debra Paget performs a very credible hula).  All that being said, the dialog and story line are pretty hokey in places, (however, in those days long before CGI they did a pretty good job with the volcano sequences.)  All in all I found it to be truly a fun experience.",1394409600,8,684,4.271317829457364

4567190,3,B0054ECI7A,"I have long been a fan of this film and, like many, I've waited years for a decent DVD version. Sadly this isn't it.  Fox didn't bother to remaster it for release but simply made a copy of what must have been the best print available.  The color is muddy in places and almost all the night scenes are lost in too dark scenes.. many times only the eyes and teeth of the characters are visible.  The final climax, which is the high point of the story, is lost in this same black hole.  Too bad, I was hoping for something better.",1391126400,,527,4.137254901960785

4567203,4,B0054ECI7A,"I was intrigued by the customer reviews for this movie. I saw it when I was thirteen on its original realease in the UK back in 1951, and was hugely impressed by the vivid location colour photography. (OK - go ahead and figure out my age,if you must!).

Apparently, the US DVD release comes as a major disappointment to some who have waited years for a video release.  I haven't seen the Region 1 DVD but, as I now live in Spain, I have purchased the newly-released Region 2 Spanish DVD (""AVE DEL PARAISO"") - and was, overall, hugely impressed by the transfer. The colours are gorgeous, the picture bright and sharp and the sound first-rate (just revel in Daniele Amfitheatof's lush music score!). True, there are some dark night sequences - but here, too, I have little cause for complaint - even with these tired old eyes, I could clearly make out much detail.

All of which leads me to believe that the Spanish DVD release has possibly been sourced from superior elements. How come? I can offer no rational explanation. The disc comes with Spanish and English audio, and Spanish and Portugese subtitles, which are optional (and removable).  And, oh yes - a glossy 36-page booklet (Spanish text) with fabulous colour and black and white photos is also included.

Note: The DVD is apparently exclusive to Spain's big department store EL CORTE INGLES, which is why you may not find it listed on Amazon's pages (as so many Spanish DVDS of US titles often are).

Incidentally, it's oft said that ""beauty lies in the eye of the beholder""  So, from here on it's up to you to check out and decide for yourself!",1383436800,12,1605,4.610526315789474

4567209,4,B0054ECI7A,"I have been looking for a copy of this film on DVD for years.  It is not a great movie, or even a great soap opera, but I remember being spellbound by this exotic tidbit as a child, and did not even know until I saw the DVD that it was filmed in color.  The transfer from film to DVD is not the best quality, it sometimes looks a bit blurred or dark, but the color is brilliant.  It just a guilty pleasure for those who were fascinated by stories of exotic people, places and cultures, as filmed in the more innocent era of the 1950's",1377561600,4,534,4.018867924528302

4567211,1,B0054ECI7A,"I remember when I first saw 'Bird of Paradise' back in 1952, the colors were so vivid, that as a teenager, it became one of my favorite films.

However, Fox have now released yet another of their disastrous transfers.  Haven't they got it yet?  Anyone with half a brain would know that putting such sub-standard product on the market is a NO BRAINER!  Don't those in charge of Home Entertainment at Fox ever read the customer reviews about their dreadful transfers of most of their releases, on Amazon.  They all must be too busy doing self-colonoscopies!

The brightness and contrast needed to be adjusted when the film was transferred to digital, or perhaps it came direct from a VHS copy.  It certainly wasn't from a TV print, because no television station in the world would accept such inferior product for telecast!  I know this for a fact, as I have been in the TV industry for 45 years.

The majority of scenes were so dark that you could make out only the whites of their eyes, and their teeth when they smiled.  When there was a bright background, as was the case with the sky, the characters were in silhouette with no distinctive features.  Only a few scenes were acceptable, and those were the ones filmed in bright sunlight.  Many of the interior scenes looked like they were lit by a single candle.

NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOX!  Get your damn act together, otherwise charge less than $5 per copy.  Most of their products up until now have been a waste of money, and I for one, after having (unfortunately) laid out several hundreds of dollars on many of their releases (hoping that I might hit the jackpot with an excellent and viewable transfer), I will not be recommending any of their product to others, and most certainly won't waste any more money in the future on their sub-standard, lack lustre product !!!
