8430848,5,B004IM0EWU,"I was lucky enough to attend a beginning jewelry class last year at James Carter Studio and I was completely hooked.  I now have a complete jewelers bench and enough tools for two people.  Jimmy is a wonderful teacher and watching his DVD is just like being in his class. It was informative, concise, entertaining - all of the things required to keep your interest.  My only question is, when is the next one?",1295913600,5,409,4.5
8430849,5,B004IM0EWU,"Having done several workshops with James Carter and knowing what a wonderful, inspiring teacher he is, I was hoping this DVD would match that experience. It does! It is beautifully shot, very clear, with wonderful insights and asides from the cryptic Mr. Carter. Unlike some instructional videos, it doesn't rely on geeky music or graphics...it's the real deal. Packed with challenging projects for the experienced metalsmith, it also includes practical tips that even beginners would benefit from. It's the humorous and slightly tough-love approach to exacting standards of craftsmanship that one gets from on-site instruction with James. Congratulations, Jimmy!",1295222400,8,663,5.707070707070707
8430850,5,B004IM0EWU,"James Carter is a true master craftsman as well as being a fine mature artist. Being such however is not enough to be an effective teacher or present a good instructional DVD. If you watch this DVD, you will not only get a great sense of technique but a dose of passion and philosophy in approach. It is unusual to see this kind of personal sharing in an instructional DVD. Even the seasoned metalsmith will learn a trick or two. This fine artist knows most, if not all of the tricks of good craft and takes no prisoners in technique. This is not a ""slick"" ultra commercial presentation but the video is clear,engaging, and fun to watch. Whether you are a new beginner or have considerable experience, you will learn something new. Well worthwhile and very good value",1295136000,6,767,4.565217391304348

8430855,5,B004IM0EWU,"This two DVD set is a must for any person interested in learning how to manipulate metal, solder, rivet, make a box catch and hinge making, as well as learning how to appropriately saw, file, sand and finish your pieces.  It also does a great job of showing those interested in bezel creating how to look at this process a little differently.

About two years ago I had been looking for a teacher in the United States to give me some guidance with some of my metalsmithing questions.  The first thing that I looked for was a master artist whose work I found fascinating. The next thing that I wanted was to know if that person was a teacher.  Through my research I fell in love with the work of James Carter.  I would frequently go back to his web site and carefully study his work.  His pieces were very detailed and so expressively his own style.  Each piece seemed to tell a story.

For months and months I had wanted to go to his studio and take a class from him, but that never materialized.  I contacted his studio and asked if he had a DVD for sale.  I always got a polite, ""Not yet, but we are considering it.""  My husband had the good fortune to be near his studio and stopped in to meet and great Mr. Carter and his wife.  Both welcomed into the shop with open arms and a story.  My husband called me at home to tell me that what he saw in Mr. Carter's studio was out of sight.  Oh, how I wanted that DVD.

Last month I got a message from James Carter Studios that announced the release of their new instructional DVD titled Metalsmithing Essentials.  I cleared my entire wish list for Christmas and told my husband, ""I want that!!""  On Christmas morning I opened this DVD and watched both discs immediately.  It was like having a jewelry studio right in my living room.

James Carter has a pleasing and calm teaching style and introduces his many trade secrets in this DVD.  He shares with his viewers in two discs what it has taken him years and much schooling to discover.  His techniques are tried and true.  I had always wanted to know how to make a professional hinge.  With a few tools and a little silver, this is very doable with these instructions.  The camera angles allow for the viewer to see each movement James is making.  The best part of this video is that each project is designed to give it's owner a bird's eye view at how to create with metals using professional and finished techniques.

I would recommend this DVD to any person interested in learning about metalsmithing at any level.  Whether you are a beginner or advanced, there is something here for you.  Much thanks to Mr. Carter for this wonderful video.  Now I am hungry for the next one!!",1294790400,13,2680,4.368421052631579
