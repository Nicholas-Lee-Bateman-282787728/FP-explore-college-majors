8468192,5,B005EFY2YG,"The Ten-Minute Ballet Break is the solution to dancing every day in spite of our very busy schedules or when we cannot make it to class. As an adult student, I find that on those days when I cannot go to class and do not do any ballet movements at all, that lack of using my body will result in poor dancing the next time in class, and generally, in feeling unpleasantly rustier in my everyday life. Just as the title suggests, this video comprises short breaks taken during ones regular activities in order to practice ballet. There are four segments with four exercises in each section that are 10 minutes long. This is excellent because you can do one segment, or even two, during your lunch break! You do not need special attire, only your ballet slippers will suffice. Another option is to do the complete video at the end of the workday, in the comfort of your home. The exercises have a double purpose  to warm you up and loosen up the body, as well as learn/review basic ballet movements which are executed in the center in these lessons. Thus, the student will improve the ability to perform better in class. Deceivingly simple, the exercises evolve into short beautiful combinations in Segments # 3 and # 4 done both forward, sideways and in diagonal. In addition, there is a wealth of information in each exercise and essential concepts of ballet are discussed and then demonstrated by Antonio Carmena, soloist of the New York City Ballet. Finis explains how to use the arms and head, so you can keep your balance when changing directions. I am sure that you too will fall in love with the beautiful adagios. Also, it is wonderful to see Finis demonstrate first with Antonio behind him learning the movements. This is a must-have for any ballet student or teacher looking to expand their video library. I highly recommend it! Ileana Ray, Brooklyn, NY",1470355200,,1861,4.656534954407295
8468193,5,B005EFY2YG,This is a great video to use between ballet classes. I am an adult beginner and using these lessons has helped me immensely while taking adult classes. It has clearly helped my technique and confidence.,1456704000,5,202,4.8
8468194,5,B005EFY2YG,"Love the 10 minute ballet break. Since I used to be a ballet dancer, it was fun to add this to my workout. When my granddaughter gets older I'll give it to her since the instruction is excellent!",1443484800,5,195,4.157894736842105
8468195,5,B005EFY2YG,"I recently purchased this DVD, and I am so happy with it!  I am over 50 years old, but in good shape, being a semi-retired ballet teacher and former dancer. I live in an area where there are no ""adult ballet classes"".  I really wanted a way to keep some ballet movement in my life, but due to old injuries and such, doing a whole ballet class DVD is really more than I can do. THIS DVD is perfect, because it has short, 10-minute segments that can be performed anywhere you have a small space to move around in a bit (don't need much space). They are all performed ""in the center""--no barre required.  The exercises are relatively simple (for someone with previous ballet experience), yet also artistic and very nice to do. Really they can be approached at various levels--the beginner will get a taste of ballet, and the more advanced dancer can work on details of technique, flow of movement and style. I have only done the first two ""breaks"", and both contain two slower combinations, and two a little faster. There is a 'contemporary' feel to the movement, with a solid classical base, which I like. This is a great DVD for a dancer, former dancer, or ballet enthusiast who either can't take a class, or needs something to do between classes that doesn't take much time or space, but comes from a world-class ballet teacher. The DVD has a section where Finis explains the exercises in detail, as well as a section where you can just perform them in sequence. If you want more than 10-minutes, well, do two, three or all four in a row. They are beautifully demonstrated by NYCB soloist Antonio Carmenal. I studied ballet with Finis more than 20 years ago, so this DVD is like coming home! I hope he'll consider doing another DVD like this.",1315353600,27,1742,4.523809523809524
