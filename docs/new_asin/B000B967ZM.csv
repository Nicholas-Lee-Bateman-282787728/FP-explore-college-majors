HOWEVER, it's one of the only Chen Tai Chi Chuan Fa dvds out there, so it's better than nothing. It's really expensive for the low quality, though back when there were no dvds and this was VHS, it must have been great and totally worth the price. It really just needs to be remastered with seperations after each application to bring it up to date with modern machinery. The info is worthwhile. I would not have bought it if I had known about the 1980's-style quality.",1379376000,6,573,4.466666666666667
8083831,5,B000B967ZM,I love this video he does the form and then goes through it again showing the real combat applications. Just the basics but many more can be thought of it just depends in how much you understand tai chi. The main part is that you understand why the move is the way it is. Understanding each move at its basic level helps you to go through the form and also figure out the applications that are more advanced. If I everget a chance I'm going to go to the school in Texas just so I can learn from a real Chen grandmaster. I've learned Yang Tai chi chuan. Chens a bout more advanced and each move is longer but the same basic principles apply done of the stances are different. But its excellently done and he's a real grandmaster. I plan on buying many more videos from him.,1356652800,2,772,4.222972972972973
