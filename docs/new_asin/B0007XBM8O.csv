The end is a little wierd in the sense  when you think it ends one way but then somewhat changes and got me confused, if not for that endiong it would have got 4 stars.

2247766,4,B0007XBM8O,"The old joke is that you should avoid going to hospitals when you are not feeling well because there are too many sick people there.  ""Kansen"" (""Infection"") takes place in a hospital where nobody should go, and that includes the doctors and nurses in director Masayuki Ochiai's 2004 horror film.  Last night I watched the season finale of ""E.R."" and with all the problems the fictional County Hospital has, it looks like a state of the art facility compared to the hospital in this movie.  The doctors have not been paid, nine nurses have quit, patients are falling out of beds, and they are running out of syringes and just about every other type of necessary supply.  One doctor suggests sending every incoming patient to surgery because that might help the place make enough money for them to get paid.  A new nurse is so inexperienced with a syringe that she has turned a comatose patient's arm into a pincushion.  Meanwhile, an ambulance in transit with a patient who has a rash that is quickly covering their entire body keeps asking for help.  It takes that ambulance a while to get to this wretched little hospital, at which point we understand the movie will get to the business of the title.
But before that happens things have already gotten critical when a patient dies because of a fatal mistake.  Recriminations fly fast and furious, along with the fear that a malpractice case could close down the hospital and cost them their lousy jobs.  When they agree to cover up the circumstances of the death, these doctors and nurses earn the fate that awaits them when the decomposing body is delivered and the unknown infectious disease is unleashed.  Whatever it is, it appears to be a green fluid.  The part where your muscle tissue falls apart with the sort of wet sound that makes you physical ill comes last.  Before that there are nightmarish visions and a descent into insanity peculiar to the personality (and personal limitations) of each character.
The basic premise of the killer disease is familiar and depending on your age the films ""The Andromeda Strain"" or ""Cabin Fever"" might be what first comes to your mind as cinematic reference points for this one.  What Ochiai is able to take advantage of is both the setting and the characters to creep you out in this unsettling little horror film.  There are enough gross outs involving bodies falling apart, but the parts that will get you come before the end stage of the infection as the characters fall apart mentally.  Where did the green goo come from?  The question is not really worth asking because it is simply the cause for the grim effects.  The first act of the film is the most problematic because it takes a long while for the ambulance to get to the hospital and get the main part of the story going.  But once things start happening ""Kansen"" jmoves into a higher gear as these doctors and nurses are all trapped in that place by feelings of duty, guilt, and fear as the infection jumps from person to person.
The result is a solid little horror film without any of the cultural mysticism and nuances of the better known efforts in this genre from Japan.  The goal here is not to shock you, but to simply creep you out and it succeeds more often than not in that effort.  ""Kansen"" is the first title in the J-Horror Theater project put together by producer Taka Inchise.  With the international success of ""Ringu"" and ""Ju-On"" the idea is to keep Japan at the forefront of making horror films and make a six-part film anthology.  Involved in the project are Hideo Nakata (""Ringu""), Kiyoshi Kurosawa (""Kairo""), and Takashi Shimizu (""Ju-On"").  Norio Tsuruta directs the second film in the series, ""Yogen"" (""Premonition""), and while the trailer for that film appears on this DVD, I have yet to see its availability.  But on the basis of that trailer and this film there is reason to believe that these Japanese filmmakers will be able to succeed where their American counterparts failed so miserably when they started churning out all those splatter flicks.",1116547200,29,4036,4.716524216524217
2247767,4,B0007XBM8O,"I guess I'm old school when it comes to horror these days, and Infection worked for me. Less is more in the horror genre as far as what is shown to us, and this movie follows that rule very well. I hate it when reviews give everything away, so in a nutshell: A decaying hospital (as well as healthcare system) is the setting for this nicely done thriller. Fear of illness, infection, hospitals, the dark, doctors.... they're all covered here. A botched death at the hands of doctors, a mysterious patient dropped off at the E.R., a hospital with very dark rooms and corridors, an aggressive virus that disolves it's host. The movie really builds tension, and the payoff does not insult the viewer. Most horror films today are pretty silly, and this was a nice little gem to discover. Highly recommended.",1116201600,25,803,4.661971830985915

I was immediately impressed with what the filmmakers did with this film.  They took a highly ambitious concept and an obvious lack of budget and turned it into a minor masterpiece of ingenuity.  I loved the camera work, the editing, the acting, the inspired use of lights and shadows, and the breakneck speed of the film.  I was mesmerized at the outset and hoped they didn't ruin it with a crappy ending; I really wanted to add this film to my collection.  Unfortunately, the ending is ambiguous and not a little perplexing.  For some reason I liked that.  It gives you something to chew on as you ponder that last stray images.

2247772,3,B0007XBM8O,"Set almost entirely in a rundown dreary hospital, Infection (2004) is an eerie, heavily atmospheric Japanese horror film that builds tension though a series of strange often macabre events, where one by one, the medical staff fall victim to an unknown danger.

Central Hospital is a financially troubled, poorly managed, decrepit looking medical facility.  One night in the ER, a patient is accidentally killed, when the wrong drug is administered by a nurse.  As the doctor in charge, Dr. Akiba (Koichi Sato) is prepared to take responsibility, but is convinced by Dr. Uozumi (Masanobo Takashima) to cover up the matter, to keep the hospital in business, and preserve their professional careers.  The entire medical team, two doctors and three nurses, agree to go along with the deception.

An ambulance delivers a patient to the ER, but Dr. Akiba tells the driver to take him somewhere else.  It is later discovered that the patient, has been taken in by Dr. Akai (Shiro Sano).  The man is suffering from an unknown condition that causes body tissues to liquefy into an icky green ooze.  A spaced out looking Akai, insists that the medical staff study the strange malady in the name of science, and possibly becoming famous in the process.  Unfortunately before long, the patient apparently dissolves into a pool of green liquid.  Then really strange things begin to happen to the hospital staff, all involving the green ooze.

Head nurse Shiozaki (Kaho Minami) is the first victim, going into a trance and burning her hands while using the sterilizer.  Another nurse repeatedly sticks herself in the arm with syringes, before stabbing herself in the chest.  A third nurse crawls up the wall and hangs upside down from the ceiling.  After infecting the nurses, the disease moves on to the doctors.  It seems nothing can stop the slimy green ooze.

Director and screenwriter Masayuki Ochiai's film is a densely atmospheric affair, that is most effective if you can go along with premise that the medical madhouse presented is real.  That can be a bit of a stretch, as the place looks more like a school than a modern hospital.  It's a place where a demented patient (Isao Yatsu) constantly runs loose, the staff nap in patient beds, a doctor spends all his time practicing making sutures, and little attention is given to tending patients, or dealing with the outside world.

If you buy into the construct, the film kind of works.  There isn't much overt violence, just a string of strange and eerie events that take place mostly at night, in dimly lighted places.  Before things get too explicit, the scene cuts away.  With no direct confrontation of the threat, there is a general feeling of uneasiness with a few jumps, but no big scares.  Such is often the case with J-horror, which is something of an acquired taste.  Those seeking graphic violence will be disappointed by Infection, as the approach to horror comes from a different direction.",1301788800,,2949,4.911111111111111
2247773,5,B0007XBM8O,"I love Japanese horror. I'm gonna keep this short--to be honest, the end of the movie doesn't really make sense, but considering I know a decent amount of Japanese culture, I think that the moral of the story sort of gets lost in the translation. However, as strange as this may be, the movie still manages to freak me out. I suggest watching it alone in the dark (I know, doing that would make anything scary, right?). Guarantee you will be freaked out--I mean, isn't that why we watch scary movies anyway? We want to be scared!

Awesome movie and I only paid 85cents for mine on here, and it was brand new!",1276387200,,608,4.380530973451328

2247775,1,B0007XBM8O,"sorry to anyone who actually liked this movie, but this is nearly unintelligible. there's almost no real point to the entire movie whatsoever. for the last five minutes they manage to twist the almost nonexistant plot at least 6 times. I'm aware of the fact that maybe this is supposed to be one of those atmospheric open-ended horror films that make you go, ""wow, THAT blew me away' but the entire time i was thinking 'when the f*** is something going to happen?'

the movie goes like this; nothing happens for about a half hour,except some doctor is having trouble at home, but they don't go into it more than 2 minutes out of the movie, so this is just plot filler. the hospital is understaffed, so they have to send a few patients home. they keep cutting to an ambulance that is apparently carrying someone with a full-body rash, and needs emergency care. the ambulance takes him to this understaffed hospital, they say 'blow, go somewhere else.' so the ambulance does whatever any professional paramedic would do; they leave him there in the hallway.

a patient wrapped in bandages (they don't explain fully what was wrong with him, but he's in horrible condition) falls out of bed, they try to save him and accidentally give him the wrong injection and kill him. instead of following procedure, they try to cover up the death by making him rot, or something. then everyone starts oozing some green goo/pus/stuff, and acting weird, then dying. that's about the entire film.

every time we were supposed to be ""scared,"" there was an overly worked cliche (like the solitary moving swing or the uselessly bland 'jump scenes'), or something happens that isn't in the least horrifying (like when the nurse eats what looks like a wonton noodle or a ravioli, but i think it's supposed to be flesh??? i have no idea...)

they also leave a few plot points completely ignored after they got introduced. there was a kid with a mask of a japanese fox demon or something, who had no lines or purpose being in this film whatsoever. there was some annoying 'punk rock' dude with headphones who didn't make sense when he talked, started pouring blood from his ears, and then...that was it. they show him a couple more times in a hospital bed, and you start to think they'll do something else with him, but nothing happens. Not lastly, but certainly the most annoying, was the old lady who would spend her time laughing at the doctors and talking to her dead family in mirrors about making dinner, all the while bouncing up and down.

normally i don't like giving away an ending, but there really wasn't a true ending for this one. it pretty much gave me the impression that they wrote the screenplay as they were shooting this, seeing as it shows that one of the doctors was the paitent that they accidentally killed, the green slime crap was actually blood, the main doctor was imagining everything and actually killing everyone instead of this disease, but then the disease was real, then it might not have been, then none of the characters were real, then they end it with a baffling locker oozing the green goop and a severed hand plopping out for no reason; ugh......

I'm completely baffled as to why this got an 'R' rating. I was expecting some really disturbing scenes or at least something besides what little is actually shown. this was PG-13, tops. Honestly, the only entertaining value this movie has is ripping it to shreds while you're watching it.",1267660800,2,3451,4.686468646864687

2247777,3,B0007XBM8O,"Kansen (Masayuki Ochiai, 2004)

I'm not entirely sure what to think of Kansen, Masayuki Ochiai (Shutter)'s third feature film (following Parasite Eve and The Hypnotist). I can appreciate it on so many levels, but there always seemed to be a really great film lurking underneath this that never got a chance to show its true colors, and so I ended up not nearly as satisfied as I could have been with it.

The opening half-hour of the film will endear it to longtime viewers of shows such as ER; the setting is a rural hospital, the characters its massively overworked night staff. This consists of four doctors-- Nakazono (Salaryman Kintaro's Michiko Hada), Kishido (Glory to the Filmmaker!'s Moro Morooka), Akiba (Rasen's Koichi Sato), and Uozumi (Masanobu Takashima of the upcoming Death Note prequel L: Change the World)-- all presided over by administrator Akai (The Grat Yokai War's Shiro Sano), a gruff, overbearing sort-- and a handful of nurses. They run around trying to do the best they can for a hospital full of patients, but inevitably end up bungling things. When one of the mistakes ends in the death of a patient, the movie sets up as a mystery as to who's actually to blame for the death, but Ochiai has some twists in store in that regard. That storyline, however, only acts as a frame for the bulk of the film, which involves a patient with a mysterious disease who is left in the emergency room by paramedics. The patient, as it turns out, is infectious, and soon the hospital staff finds itself succumbing to the disease-- all, that is, except for Akai and Akiba. Akiba has to figure out how to avoid becoming infected and save as many people as possible, with Akai hindering him at every turn. (But that, of course, is not all. We've got that dead body to deal with as well, and a bunch of very stressed-out hospital staff.)

If you approach it like an episode of ER, and kind of shuffle off the pretty lame infection storyline to the backburner, this is an enjoyable little flick (assuming you've got the stomach for it; the infection tends to do nasty things to the people who contract it). It's certainly not going to end up ranking with such neoclassic Asian horror films as The Eye or Audition, but it serves its purpose well enough, with a nicely chilling atmosphere and some strong acting from the principals. But still, as someone else wrote in a review, it did feel as if this was going to be an entirely different movie, and the infection storyline got stuck in at the last minute. Perhaps that's the case, perhaps not; I've no idea. Not as good as it could've been, but not entirely awful, either. Worth a shot if you've nothing better to do late one night. ** ",1212105600,,2694,4.617954070981211
2247778,3,B0007XBM8O,"Is infection a supernatural tale or a slasher film?  It's actually a supernatural slasher film filled with gore and shot in a dreamlike nightmare fashion.
A Overworked, Underfunded, and Understaffed hospital where patients are mistreated and mistakes are made some worse than others.  After the doctors try to cover up one of said mistakes a infected patient is dropped in their E.R, and all hell breaks lose.

DVD FEATURES
No special features however the picture quality on this looked great, I've been watching mostly blu ray and this film still looked good.  This is the first dvd to actually completely film my screen, I have a 106"" draper screen and on cable 1:85 aspect ratio totally fills the screen but on dvds it leaves just a little tiny black line at the bottom, not your typical letterbox via 2:35.  Anyway, this film completely and perfectly filmed the screen.  It says it was formatted from the original 1:85 version in which the film was shot.  If films aren't usually done like that maybe they should start.
The dolby digital 5.1 track in Japanese was also crisp and effective.",1205971200,4,1184,4.89
2247779,4,B0007XBM8O,"I ended up rewatching this film for the first time six years after my rekindled interest into horror cinema. When I remembered one of the titles from the J-Horror series that seems to have spawned two unofficial entries over the past few years, I ended up remember Infection highly over Premontion - one that was remade in the US a few years back - and Reincarnation - one of the original 8 Films To Die For from Afterdark Films.

What made me hold Infection highly over the two was that it didn't rely on clich tactics to make it as appealing to films like Ju-On and Ring, while it achieves to be a well-paced film with lots of interesting scenes to keep viewers guessing what happens next.

For me, this film is greatly directed to have the most brooding atmosphere ever presented. From a dark to an eerily shaded creep of green, the screen was like a life monitor holding a vital sign that you desperately needed to not have it flat line. It also heavily presented an environment that made you feel that something is obviously wrong, but you don't know when what that wrong would happen.

Effects aren't so much as an issue here - aside from the green blood, but that gets explained later in the film as a metaphor for mental mindsets. Lot's of medical equipment (ie: syringes, scalpels, sutures, ivy racks, etc etc), creepy infected-possessed make-up to make all the doctors look like they need an actual doctor, and overall a gruesome assortment of medical mayhem to freak out the casual movie gore.

An assorted cast is welcomed to the set to help create this monstrosity of a film. Pretty much, think if the whole cast of Grey's Anatomy was suddenly plagued with a case of the Black Plague that induced a flesh-eating virus.

My one fault with the film from reaching a full score from me is that the story fails to stay coherent. At times, it was perfectly clear on what had happen, but trudging on, I felt sort of lost at times, in which, my brain had to stay on to keep up with what was going on. The story lost me at times, and even made me nod off every few scenes, but I could sense a promising premise that could've been polished up with some more time.

Overall, I'm giving this film thumbs up if you're willing to pour your mind into following this film, otherwise, you may be much more happier with a night with Freddy Kruegur if you're not into psychological mind-f@#%s.",1205884800,,2387,4.488479262672811

2247782,3,B0007XBM8O,"""Infection,"" (aka: Kansen) is not a film for everyone. When I first viewed the film a couple of years ago, I knew it was not a masterpiece. Yet, somehow, there is something incredibly creepy about this film which I find appealing. However, as a word of caution, this may not be a film for everyone, so rent it first. However, I really liked this film enough to give it 3.5 stars. The film itself takes place at a hospital that is understaffed, underfunded, short on medical supplies, and staffed by a few incompetent doctors and nurses. The hospital is already reeling with too many patients, when a distress call from an ambulance crew is received requiring permission to drop off an infectiously diseased patient. Moreover, there is an extreme urgency to the voice of the ambulance crew.

However, a cover-up is about to ensue when one of patients in the hospital, who has severe burns, is given an injection of the wrong medicine which will kill him. He was the patient of Dr. Uozumi (Masanobu Takashima), yet it is Dr. Ouzumi's colleague, Dr. Akiba (Koichi Sato), who along with an inexperienced nurse that will be the cause of this patients death. This partly illustrates the tremendous amount of pressure the staff of this hospital face. How do they handle this tragedy? They decide to cover it up. They know that if word gets out that their careers will be ruined. The staff, therefore, decides to heat the body up to speed up the decay process, just in case there is an autopsy. Meanwhile, the medical staff have been so busy with this patient, that they are unaware that the ambulance crew has dropped off the infectious patient in the ER.

This is no ordinary patient the medical staff will have to deal with. Out of nowhere, however, Dr. Akai (Shiro Sano) convinces the medical staff not to report the diseased patient to the Health Department, but instead to study the patients illness: As he tells them that they will be famous, and have job offers and interviews which will make their careers. Dr. Akai, is the most disturbing character in the film, and much attention must be focused on  him. Further, Dr. Akiba's portrayal is of primary importance to the film, which I do not wish to reveal. Director Masayuki Ochiai did a very good job with this film, and gives one a very claustrophobic feel to the film. Plus, the films many questions are answered at the end. I really like this film, but once again, rent it first. And watch Dr. Akiba closely in the beginning of the film. [Stars: 3.5]",1190764800,5,2505,4.650112866817156
2247783,4,B0007XBM8O,"Kansen... That name has become legendary with me. Not because of the unusual plot line, or the cinematography, or even the idea of a slow-roasting corpse in a hospital room- which, now that I put it that way, makes me chuckle.
No, the reason this film is legendary is because of its incredible ability- even MORE so, if you'll believe me, to hit and miss. Either you think it's superbly psychological, or the most hilarious thing you could have accidentally picked up at the video store. There doesn't seem to be much in between there.

If you're reading this, you've likely already seen the other reviews, which give varying amount of summarized plot information. Perhaps they mention the quirks of the hospital staff. Perhaps they mention the visual oddities of watching people 'dissolve'. Whatever it is they do mention, I will assume I may talk with relative freedom from this point.

I think the major thing while watching this movie is an ability to suspend belief at will. Also, if you don't know too much about medicine, it helps. Example: It's really quite annoying to be me sometimes- during the movie, I just kept muttering to myself. ""How the heck are they doing all this? Is it really gangrenous? I mean, it looks like it would be, but I've never seen it dissolve THAT rapidly. And what exactly is up with the blood thing? Am I the only one who is almost completely unable to tell these nurse women apart? What the heck is with that fox-mask kid, anyway...?"" And so on. It makes it very difficult to enjoy the movie when you're constantly questioning its' credibility.

Second, you need to watch it alone. It's a good horror flick rule to have anyway, but there are some movies you can invite people to, given the proper atmosphere. For this one, you can't. Even with belief suspended, the hold it has over you tends to be tenuous. A distraction could quite possibly ruin the entire thing for you. It's not necessarily a bad thing that the movie doesn't try as hard as others to pull you in; I like to think it's simply being polite. If you want to be frightened (or at least creeped out), it requests that you make a bit of effort to do so as well.

Third, watch at night. Turn your screen brightness down a bit if possible. Get comfortable, don't move much. Bring snacks with you so you don't have to get up.

Of course, the atmosphere might not work for some. It might help for certain people to bring a pad of paper and a pen to write everything down- like watching a game show, or reading a crime novel, it helps to unravel clues. See if you can guess the plot twist that's coming beforehand- it can even enhance your enjoyment of the movie. If you can do all of these things, you might just be able to get sucked into it. No guarantees, but they help, I think.

The best thing I managed to get out of this movie, aside from something to laugh at while I'm at work, may sound a bit cynical, but it completely honest. I obtained another favorite music artist.
That's right, the ending song is- as far as I'm concerned- awesome. It's titled, for those who don't read Japanese. ""Yume"". Miwako Okuda, the singer, is superb. (If you've ever heard of her before, it's probably because one of her other songs, ""Shizuka"", was an ending for Great Teacher Onizuka.) I only, sadly, have the four songs that were available on her Myspace page that someone set up, but Yume is included, along with ""Boku ga Ikiteitakoto"", and ""Kanashimi ni Oborete"". 'Boku ga' is a soft, reminiscent song from the perspective of a newly deceased person, and 'Kanashimi' is, to use the American term, 'emo'. But it's still quite enjoyable, especially if you just got dumped and are looking for a good annoyed/depressed mood song.",1187827200,3,3716,4.563718140929535
2247784,4,B0007XBM8O,"A dark, unnerving, metaphysical horror puzzler, ""Infection"" takes place in a struggling, understaffed Japanese hospital where a bad decision being made, ends up being followed by the slow emergence of both supernatural happenings and fiercely simmering tension among the hospital staff.  Controlled exteriors tenuously cover a deepening inter-characters conflict that has people almost literally at one another's throats; a sinister green slime begins to crawl forward from cracks and corners; and finally pesonalties seem to alter and reality itself seems to be slipping around.  ""Infection"" is highly cryptic even for Asian horror (note - I'm counting 'cryptic' as a totally different thing than 'confusing because everything is put together so haphazardly and unevenly')  This is one you can interpret in different ways, possibly even get different interpretations after different watchings, and full of enigmas to try and figure out.

Every chance they had to show something, they would pan away or show the actor's reaction to the scene rather than show what it was they were looking at. It is a movie that you really have to pay attention to to understand what plot. It is indeed a good premise, but the lack of special effects and very parts of the movie hurt it. Personally, I didn't think this movie was scary and it never creeped me out, but overall it was still a decent watch. So, if you like J-horror, you can rent it but good luck fully understanding the end of the movie",1160265600,6,716,4.233576642335766
2247787,4,B0007XBM8O,"Hospitals are inherently spooky.  Scenes of so much pain and death, the very walls soaking up the agony through the years, they can slowly affect the minds and souls of those that work there.  The hospital in ""Infection"" (""Kansen"") is in particularly bad shape. Losing money, unable to keep staff, the doctors and nurses working there are under-qualified and desperate.  Into this unstable environment comes a strange patient, with a black, infectious rash.  Slowly, the rash spreads, revealing a terrifying disease that liquidates the insides of a human's body, slowly driving the staff insane with fear and anticipation.  But all is not as it seems, even then.

I'm impressed that, even watching as much J-Horror as I do, ""Infection"" still managed to creep me out.  It was unexpectedly good.  Director Masayuki Ochiai knows the things in a hospital that can make you cringe, and he uses them to their fullest extent.  He also keeps you guessing as to exactly what kind of horror movie this is.  Is it about a devastating biological infection?  Are those ghosts?  Is that a serial killer?  All of his images and slow revelations of the story keep making less and less sense, disorientating you just when you think you have a handle on it, until the final page is revealed and it all comes crashing home.

""Infection"" isn't quite a gross-out flick, like ""Ichi the Killer,"" but it definitely relies on visual shock for its scares while keeping a good atmosphere.  If anything, it manages to combine the creepy mood of J-Horror ghost films like ""Ring"" while still delivering on cringe-worthy gore.  One scene in particular had me going.  When you see the movie, you will know what it was.

As part of the ""J-Horror Theater"" series, and directer by a relatively new-comer who's experience has mainly been doing horror TV shows, I didn't have high expectations for this film.  I thought it would be a cheap job, done to cash in on the current J-Horror fad.  I was wrong. It is quite a well made little horror flick, not outstanding or groundbreaking, but really excellent for what it is.",1160092800,,2083,4.814084507042254
2247788,4,B0007XBM8O,"There's not much to explain with this kind of movie.  Japanese horror films don't just limit to real actors, but also towards animation.  I'm sure many of you would relate this (if you are an anime fan) to a series called Paranoia Agent or (if you are a gaming fan) to the hospital levels on various ""Silent Hill"" video games produced by Konami.  The scenery, the character development, and even the storyline fazed all of my senses into a horror that I haven't felt since I was seven years old watching ""Are you Afraid of the Dark?"" on Nickelodeon.  This is a scarefest YOU HAVE to see.

The relationship between this movie and (from what I can tell) Silent Hill and Paranoia agent is definetely the unsettling environment.  Whoever did the music is just as much a genious as Akira Yamaoka.  Unlike Silent Hill, however, there are no demonic creatures or deep storylines of death and agony.  Instead, this movie is more like Paranoia Agent (by Geneon Entertainment).  The series involves a more mental aspect of unsettling environments especially in the character development department.  These are stressed out people who have a suicide victim on their hands.

As for the movie's scare factor... DEFINETELY DO NOT WATCH THIS IN THE DARK!!!  The creator of The Grudge and The Ring definetely put a lot of hard work into the creation of this film.  If this film would EVER be adapted to an American film, it had better stick to the original storyline and original plot theme.  Christopher Gans almost had it with Silent Hill, but Roger Avery's ""Witch"" ending didn't make sense, and most of the questions answered on the first game are not in the movie.  Infection's twisted story plot and engrossing plot theme made the movie a 4 star, but it didn't have good enough acting... leaving a star out.  However, it's Japanese acting, so it doesn't surprise me too much.  I was satisfied with all of the suicidal anguish that puts Requiem of a Dream to shame.

If you want a frightfest and don't mind Japanese subs (like anime, it's better with subs), then TOTALLY get this movie and ENJOY IT.  Don't be frustrated with subtitles.  If you can't read, it's probably because you're to scared of the chick using herself as a pincushion practicing stabbing herself with needle.",1158883200,,2267,4.749360613810742

Sounds like it should be a decent movie.  It does have some creepy parts.  Unfortunately, it loses focus on its themes while trying to make you figure out what the heck is going on....if this is a ghost story, medical misadventure, or telenovela.  It goes all over the place and never satisfies.

Technical issues are done poorly.  A good example is when one sort-of ghost appears.  They then hide her head in the mirror (ooh, so spookie for a [...] year old), but then there are her hands and arms in the mirror.

But all those criticisms are nothing compared to THE WORST ACTING EVER!!!  The dialogue is absurd and the actors' reactions are just painfully overdone.  The actors go from confused and sullen to emotionally anguished and screeching for no reason.  I can accept ghosts, boogeymen, flying knife throwing turkeys if I must, but Rns and MDs who FREAK OUT when a patient needs resucitation... who become emotionally unstable when a patient falls out of bed....  OH, DEAR GOD, DON'T GIVE THAT PATIENT AN ASPIRIN!!!!

What is then worse is their lesser reactions to an infection that makes E.Coli look like a paper cut.  ""A doctor was mean to me""= manic crying and screeching.  ""That guy just exploded""= consternation.  What??  STUPID STUPID STUPID.  STUPID.

It seems to me the 'infection' is a metaphor for medical malpractice and it begins with apathy and lack of caring for the patients.

As for the ending, upon re-watching it, I notice the head nurse who returns gets 'infected' when she doesn't want to sign for a patient. (The clipboard scene). The other medic (emt?) insists so she finally signs it. That seems to doom her.

That's what I got from the film, I dig J-Horror but much of it is cultural and that's what makes it so interesting. I was lucky to see Ju On with two Asian women who explained tons of stuff I never would've understood so I'm sure there's lots I didn't 'get' in Infection.",1154563200,3,862,4.375

2247792,3,B0007XBM8O,"Short on money, equipment, and adequate workers, a Japanese central hospital is unable to accept new patients, while struggling just to take care of the patients they already have. After a dire mistake involving a chemical mixup resulting in the death of a burn victim, the doctors and nurses decide to further burn the body to render the cause of death unrecognizable. But the real problems begin with the newest patient, the host of an unknown pathogen which evidently liquifies internal organs into green goop. One particularly ambitious doctor seeks infamy by identifying and treating the pathogen, going as far to threaten the others with blackmail to ensure they comply. As the virus inevitably spreads, insanity and general weirdness ensues. The flawed characters are all pretty memorable, if not particularly likeable. As they barely contain the outbreak, the film takes an almost Romero-esque twist as conflict and enmity swells between them, exploding in violence at times. I'm not digging the end, though. The postmodern climax fragments into a melange of forced motifs, and pretentious plot devices.

Infection is a very effective film when it comes to scares, though. Maybe it's just because I've always had a thing about hospitals, but it provided the perfect bleak setting for its diseased confrontations and medical mishaps. For instance, that messed up old lady was a predictable creep-out tactic, but things get undeniably sordid when she starts cackling as the doctors are losing a patient. Also consider the original host of the virus disappearing off his bed. Did his body disintegrate, or did he slither off into the vents? Very eerie and unconventional atmosphere. There are some lame cliches scattered about, though; annoying fakeouts, SpOoKy aUtO-mOvInG SwInGsEtS, etc. But they're inconsequential in the end.

Anyway, although it falls apart at the end, Infection is a solid horror movie.

The Japanese film ""Infection"" is more than blood and guts. It's blood, guts, gangrene, and muscle tissue. Therefore, if you are ""grossed out"" easily, you may want to avoid this movie.

The film is set in Central Hospital of Japan. You would definitely want to avoid this place if you were sick. This was a good place for the movie to be set in. It provided the ""creepy factor"" that is almost always necessary in a horror movie. The acting is fairly good, although I don't have much to compare it to, since I don't normally watch foreign films. Compared to the average American horror flick, though, the cast was well-picked. Very appropriate for this type of film.

I wasn't extremely impressed, but it is worth watching on a late night when you don't have anything better to do. It isn't something I would buy. If you insist on watching it, at least rent it first. I'm sure that will be enough for you.",1148774400,2,1129,4.392344497607655

I think the actors and actresses are doing a good job. If the acting wasn't that good, then the movie would be a very silly one. This creepiness is refreshing because most American horror movies are scary instead of being creepy. It indeed is a strange hospital, for being so dark everywere so they had to be using flash lights. Even in emergency like that they were still keeping most rooms dark. The lack of music effect was effective for creepiness.

There are some pretty gruesome moments, the nurse with the needles for example, and if you have a fear of hospital this certainly isn't the movie for you.

2247799,4,B0007XBM8O,"This one should. Something is badly wrong at Central Hospital, a small, out of the way rehab facility. Nobody has gotten their paychecks, the administrator  hasn't been seen for days, nine nurses have quit, supplies are running low and the remaining staff is burned out. One young man has cracked. A young nurse is not only incompetent but a hysteric as well.

Clearly we are not in Marcus Welby land. Things are bad and in an instant get a whole lot worse. A patient is killed due to a medical mistake. Instead of reporting it the staff decide to cover it all up. Bad move. Another doctor, the pristine, cold as ice, Dr. Akai overhears the whole thing and he's not pleased. Later  he's going to play the role of avenging angel.

This would be enough of a nightmare but then a patient is dumped in the closed ER. The poor guy is turning into a green blob. Once he escapes into the vents bodies, ghosts and old sins pile up rapidly.

This is a very creepy little movie and it's a perfect example of the diffence between American horror and the Japanese version. Instead of smacking you in the face with a gross out scene the director uses a lot of symbolism and allows the viewer's imagination to do half the scare job for him. At several points we see the empty swing set on hospital grounds. The childless swings are an almost universal symbol that something isn't right and each time we see the swing set things in the hospital get even uglier.

Be sure to watch for a truly great scene that could only take place in a Japanese film: a nurse walks into a room and the blob infested head nurse walks in behind her. The camera cuts to the stairwell and we see a close up of the Walk sign but it looks like the little walking man figure on the sign is really running for his life. Next we see a trembling hand grab a pack of cigarettes. Suddenly we see the young nurse sitting sprawled in a chair and she's smoking. Something horrible has happened. The director doesn't spell it out for you. You just know.

My only gripe with this film is the ending. You never know if it was real, a bad dream or a psychotic episode brought on by a guilty mind.",1138492800,4,2145,4.32089552238806

But to the middle, things start to move.  The mood is depressive, dark, and hopeless.  Everyone is angry, tired, and have lowered to the point of not caring. You are left without a doubt that this is a hospital for the poor.  The characters are just as depressive as the environment.  The use of shadows, wide shots, close-ups, works to hammer into our minds the twilight zone that this hospital and the staff are.  The only problem is the slowness. Why they film about half a movie just to tell you everyone is screw-up? But, the movie moves thanks to the artistic merits of the cinematographer, the guy really knows his stuff.  The images, the lights, with the acting, move the story to the really good part, the infection.  I love the kind of movies where ""this is happening, we don't know why, deal with it, real life seldom explains things"".  We are with the characters in the panic of killing a patient, and we are with then when the mystery patient appears.  The illness is never explained.  We are just hinted that all is a karmic punishment, as everyone is suddenly reminded of a past sin or fear (or is it?).  Then, a few twists and...you are left scratching your head wondering what the hell all was about.  Is a good movie, not like Ringu who for me still is a far superior j-horror flick. Please keep in mind, j-horror )japanese horror to those new to the genre) is unlike american or italian movies.  You have to keep your eyes peel.  Is more a psychological horror than anything.

2247805,4,B0007XBM8O,"Lions Gate Films apparently cut a deal with a Japanese company and created a small sub-division within LGF aptly named J-Horror.  The purpose of this division was to make 6 Japanese horror flicks specifically for the American DVD market.  'Infection' is one of the first of these films released(the second, released simultaneously, is called 'Premonition' and is also worth checking out).

Anyways, the plot of 'Infection' is basically that a hospital is on its last legs:  its running out of supplies, money, employees, etc.  And one night a burn victim is accidentally killed by the staff and a possibly infectious patient is dropped off at the hospital's ER.  The two don't really seem to connect at first, but by the end they are tied together.  The infection then quickly starts spreading(with gallons of green ooze), people start melting from the inside out(literally)and the few employees left(three doctors and a handful of nurses)try to deal with the horrid happenings.

The movie is very well done.  The acting(though I don't speak Japanese)is very good, regardless of the fact I don't recognize any of the actors even from my extensive viewing of Asian cinema.  The cinematography is great and gives the hospital a whole lot of atmosphere(think Von Trier's 'The Kingdom').  The script is well written though the film's logic seems to fall in on itself when the movie is wrapped up.  It will leave you slightly confused.  And the gore(i.e. the burn victim, the constant onslaught of green ooze from every possible orifice)is great.  There aren't too many special effects to speak of but the few that are there are well done.

Overall, 'Infection' is a good little horror flick.  Nothing to really scare you out of your skin, but there's enough creepiness to make you queasy.  Though you will leave a little confused and there are somethings that aren't really explained(i.e. the swingset), this is still a movie worth watching.  Check it out.

2247806,4,B0007XBM8O,"Japanese horror films truly are a different breed.  Infection, from director Masayuki Ochiai, is one humdinger of a creepfest that doesn't spare the gore yet never descends to the level of a hack-and-slash effort.  Its vibrantly dark cinematography and appropriately unsettling music provide the background for a veritable orgy of suspenseful horror as its characters' psychological overloads, helped along by a mysterious catalyst, give birth to something exceedingly ugly and quite often disgusting.  In a sense, the film is somewhat confusing, in that it never exactly spells out the source of the infection or even the absolute nature of it, but I didn't feel the disappointment some viewers might at the ending.

Central Hospital is in trouble.  It's dangerously understaffed, no one has been paid, the director has disappeared, patients are coming to harm because no one is there in a timely fashion to see to their needs, supplies are dangerously low, doctors and nurses are putting in way too many hours to carry the load, etc.  Lest you think things could get any worse, well, they most certainly do.  It all starts when a mistake leads to the death of a patient.  With their backs already to the wall thanks to the deteriorating state of the hospital, the doctors and nurses involved decide to cover up the real cause of death - it was a severe burn victim with no real family, after all.  There is to be one more patient admitted to the hospital, however, one literally dumped on them by paramedics.  John Doe has the mother of all infections, one that liquefies the internal organs and basically causes the victim to start dropping gooey gobs of green nastiness all over the place.  One extremely unemotional doctor, who may or may not have knowledge of the little cover-up so recently planned upstairs, insists on treating the patient, trying to figure out the new pathogen, and thus gaining medical kudos for the effort.  Everyone else is just revolted by the poor excuse of former humanity spreading his nasty green goodness all over the floor.

Well, he of the liquefying organs sort of disappears, and the hospital crew enacts a search for their green and gloppy charge.  It soon becomes clear, however that - whatever the patient had - it is quite infectious.  Rather than call in the health department, they keep on keeping on under the direction of the emotionless pioneer (who I like to call Dr. Gung Ho).  Needless to say, they start dropping like flies - well, not like flies, really, as they tend to do something really nasty such as burn their own hands off before commencing with gooey expectorations of the nastiest sort.  I'm not sure why the hospital is almost completely dark throughout the film, but it makes for a most creepy of settings, and characters have the disarming tendency of sneaking up quietly behind one another out of the frame.  It's really hard to describe the sort of horror that builds up as characters develop the infection, but it's more than capable of spooking and quite possibly disgusting you.

The ending leaves some questions unanswered and may be something of a stretch for some viewers.  Even if you find disappointment in the final minutes, though, there is more than enough gory goodness to keep you entertained up to that point.  Infection (aka Kansen) is apparently the first film in the J-Horror Theatre series, which apparently aims to shock audiences and teach them the fine art of suspenseful dread.

8053188,4,B0007XBM8O,"I`ve seen this movie for I do love Asian Horror, & personally I find this movie rather intriguing. The setting for the movie and the plot was rather good. The run-down hospital, low on medical supplies, understaffed, the remaining over-worked non payed doctors & nurses all at the breaking point, so of course it`s a good recipe for a patient to die, but not because of not anybody caring, but the remaining staff are near total exhaustion. I love how the story progresses when the mysterious patient arrives to change the everything entirely, bringing the suspense up several notches, making the staff eventually lose their grip on reality!",1421712000,,641,4.944444444444445

I am super glad I did, Im a major horror film fan and this doesnt disappoint. This film actually sparked my interest in getting more NON US film releases, because a lot of times they are better than the stuff the US is releasing!! This film is very very creepy. If your into the Silent Hill series, it reminded me alot of those. Very scary film, dare I say the scariest film I have ever seen? Maybe, or pretty close! Does a good job of keeping you in your seat and not wanting to leave until you find out the ending.

I could write pages worth about how great this film is but don't waste your time reading my review. If you are a fan of really creepy horror films just pick it up. I promise you will thank me.",1370131200,,853,4.017647058823529
