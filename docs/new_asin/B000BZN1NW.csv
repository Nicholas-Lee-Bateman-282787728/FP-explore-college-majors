8094885,3,B000BZN1NW,I enjoyed Ernesto's performance in this movie; but that's about it.  The rest of the cast either overacted their roles or the story was so jumbled up I couldn't understand it at all. I don't think subtitles could've helped me understand this at all.,1201564800,,249,4.659090909090909
8094886,5,B000BZN1NW,"Esmeralda is a nurse who has a big heart. She cares so much ... that over a short period of time she managed to get married five times to five different men and somehow manages to balance this bigamous lifestyle with no guilt or remorse. Unfortunately, her luck runs out when she nearly snares husband number six. It is husband number five who gets suspicious and follows her and discovers her *secret* lifestyle ... It is not her job and the long and strenous working hours as she claims which takes up so much of her time. It is the balancing act of carrying on her love life with so many husbands! One husband is a businessman. Another is an older gentleman and a poet. A younger husband is a university student. One of the marriages is simply a ruse, a cover-up  for his ""real life"" gay relationship. Esmeralda married him to hoodwink his mother who might not understand his natural inclinations. And one is a rock star .. a musician.

After Esmeralda is arrested and undergoes interrogation by the chief inspector, he is quite overcome by his self-righteousness. He is a respectable man with strong and high standards of right and wrong.  He wants justice done. However, he also tries to understand and reason out how and why she got so deeply involved in such a complex and socially unacceptable lifestyle. The more he hears about how she met each of her husband's - each so different from the other and yet each with their own brand of attractiveness and individuality, the more the inspector realizes how empty his own life is. He is in fact drawn into sympathizing with her situation. Esmeralda's plight becomes known by the newspapers and media ... She becomes a sensation, getting support from the public and especially feminists who demonstrate on her behalf and for her rights. The chief inspector begins to soften and open up to Esmeralda's charms ... The group of husbands band together and try to free Esmeralda from jail - without success. Despite his best efforts, husband number five who brought charges against Esmeralda is unable to withdraw the legal complaint ...

The film is amusing and entertaining on many levels. Maria Rojo plays this complex comedy role to perfection. Her role as a nurse wins supporters. Her feminine charms are quite obvious to all ... In the end, everyone gets along with everyone else and they have a picnic in a public park - celebrating life. This is a most highly recommended film.

8094887,4,B000BZN1NW,"Have never seen a Maria Rojo film before but bought this film on impulse.  It is subtitled which is fine with me, I like foreign films,  but has no chapters or special features.  The film itself is very sweet; Rojo has great charm.  She is also quite sexy and several of her husbands are bound to set some pulses racing as well. It does have some fairly frank nudity which isn't made clear on the DVD case.  The story has charm and provided many smiles as well as a few outloud laughts.  I will definitely be looking for more of Rojo's films.",1177200000,2,542,4.264705882352941
8094888,5,B000BZN1NW,"I loved this movie. Maria Rojo as Esmeralda is delightfully sweet, and absolutely beautiful. The humor is top-notch; I especially liked how the inspector and others in the police station appeared in the scenes as Esmeralda was describing them.
Esmeralda is light, sweet, beautiful and funny, and she totally fills the movie with those qualities.
I highly recommend this movie.",1066003200,2,376,5.283333333333333
