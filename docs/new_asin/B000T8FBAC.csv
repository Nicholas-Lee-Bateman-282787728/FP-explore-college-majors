8208083,5,B000T8FBAC,"I was considering getting a hedgehog as a pet and ordered this video to find out what was involved in caring for one.  I found that the video was highly informative in all aspects of hedgehog care, including how to select a socialized one, and I appreciated having the visual aspects of the video.  I was impressed by the knowledge of the video's creator, an experienced hedgehog breeder.  I highly recommend this video as a resource for hedgehog owners and prospective owners!",1267920000,,477,4.7926829268292686
8208084,3,B000T8FBAC,"Pros:
Informative
Seems to accurate and up to date with their information
Lots of hedgehog video

Cons:
Same info you could find on any hedgehog website.
Short - 1/2 hour
Has sort of a PBS feel to the DVD.",1232323200,2,205,4.256410256410256
8208085,5,B000T8FBAC,"I'm getting a hedgehog soon, and I'd bought books on hedgehogs and read stuff online, but most of the books were slightly outdated, and I was looking for some information from an experienced breeder/owner that could really help me learn about taking care of hedgehogs. I randomly found ""Hedgehogs Unleashed"" online, and I ordered it right away, with express shipping. It came a couple days later, and I watched it immediately. It was extremely entertaining, very informative, and it really helped me to learn much more about the hedgehog. I definitely feel more comfortable now about getting a hedgehog, even though I have never had one before. I suggest this DVD to anyone who thinks they might want to get a hedgehog; there should be more DVDs like this on hedgehogs. I would buy them!",1228953600,2,787,4.837037037037037
8208086,5,B000T8FBAC,"I ordered this to help me decide if I wanted a pet hedgehog and really enjoyed it, as well as learning about how to best care for my future hog!  My kids also really liked the dvd (they often ask to watch it) and it was a great way to help them learn about their future pets care!  We did decide to get the hedgie and it has gone smoothly because we knew what to expect after seeing the dvd.  Also, I had to have a friend ""baby sit"" our hedgie for a few days and I had her view it before we left!  I think if your are planning on getting a hedgehog, or already have one it's a must have for your hedgie library!  I'd like to see Ms. Warnick do a book as well.",1220313600,2,659,3.781021897810219
8208087,5,B000T8FBAC,This video was soo helpful...it's full of information! I'm very visual so the DVD was a great way for me to learn about all the different aspects of owning a hedgehog. I highly recommend it!,1217894400,,190,4.457142857142857
8208088,5,B000T8FBAC,"This is a great DVD, and answered lots of concerns I had about owning a non-standard pet - My mind was put at ease on everything from diet to hedgehog-specific health issues!",1203292800,,174,4.46875
8208089,5,B000T8FBAC,"This DVD is informative, interesting, and covers everything I hoped to learn, from choosing a hedgehog to obtaining proper veterinary care! Diet, care, everything I wanted to learn was so much more enjoyable and informative in the format of a movie compared to a book. Excellent!
