3176785,5,B00181FABO,"This DVD covers topics that are not normally covered on instructional DVDs, at least the ones I have seen. Antonio, of Pat Metheny fame, explains how to use phrasing most efficiently in your playing and soloing, how to deal with transitions, as well as his approach to technique and listening. I have studied with Antonio, and this DVD shows him off as the excellent teacher that he is. He also demonstrates his interpretation of several tunes from his own album, as well as Pat Metheny songs he has worked on.

The format is a clinic format with a live audience and after each topic is presented, he takes questions. The questions appear not to be scripted, at least many of them are not, I think, so the experience is that of being in the same boat with the audience.

Just to watch Antonio play is a real treat and worth the price of the DVD, but there are three solid hours of really applicable and useful concepts and topics here, so anybody who is interested in jazz, Afro Cuban, and Brazilian style drumming should look at this.",1259539200,,1035,4.529411764705882
3176786,5,B00181FABO,"Antonio breaks things down really down really clearly on this dvd, and his insights and experience are very inspiring! He begins by speaking of his background and his musical journey, and then plays along with some of the tracks from his solo release 'Migration', as well as tracks from his recordings with the Pat Metheny Group. The masterclass format  allows Antonio to cover a range of topics (independence, styles, practicing, technique, phrasing, dynamics, motivic development, etc...) all of which he explains clearly, and provides exercises for. He also gives great insight into playing different styles, and how to develop vocabulary and an ear for jazz, latin and other styles. He also clearly explains some of the more complicated figures he uses, such as a left foot clave in 5/4.
I would especially recommend this dvd for anyone who is checking out contemporary jazz and latin styles, and for fans of Antonio in general.",1215129600,8,932,5.091503267973856
3176787,5,B00181FABO,"It is a very good idea to ask to the customers their opinion ; For me , this DVD is absolutely magnificent, every drummer ( and others musicians too ) should have and see this performance, everthing is there : drumming education, jazz and afro-cuban drumming, rudiments, practicing, left-foot clav, independence, soloing ideas, odd-meter clav, good and interesting explications about music and ""life"" ( having the right attitude ), music-business ... Antonio Sanchez is a very, very good drummer but also musician so he can explain his ""feeling"" and can also share his tremendous musicality. In a intimate master-class setting, he performs both on his smaller traditional-jazz set and his larger kit that he uses with Pat Metheny, playing selections from Pat Metheny Group, along with compositions by Chick Corea. The only ""defect"" in this DVD is the eBook with transcriptions of exercises, it is too small, not complete, it should have more patterns. Aside this, it is perfect, essential for all of us, Emilio ( France ).",1214784000,6,1022,5.089285714285714
3176788,5,B00181FABO,"This is a great video, of a great drummer. If you take playing drums serious in the least bit, I highly recommend this video. Antonio covers topics like creating motifs (just repeated patterns), proper technique (and even how you can still be great with not-so proper technique), playing claves with the left foot (in 4/4 and 5/4, which is really fun!), and there's also a good handful of performances of him playing to tracks from Pat Metheny discs and from his new solo record. This dvd has some very useful information for drummers and musicians, and on top of the educational value, it's just damn entertaining! Very inspirational, I highly recommend!!!",1213833600,5,657,4.927927927927928

8268260,3,B00181FABO,Expected more instruction from it.  Seemed more like just highlights from his recording.  Still great to watch his amazing skills at work.  Didn't feel inspired to try techniques discussed--not in depth enough.,1481414400,,210,5.5

8268262,5,B00181FABO,"This guy is a bad@$$ for sure!
Mr. Sanchez has some really insightful information to offer here as well as some stellar playing.

Highly recommended.",1426118400,,149,4.96

8268264,5,B00181FABO,great cd. he shows a lot of drum styles during this event. antonio is a wizard when it come to playing drums,1414713600,,108,3.9545454545454546

Lo compr nuevo., el dvd lleg sin ralladuras en excelente condiciones interno y externo.",1397347200,,205,4.885714285714286
8268266,4,B00181FABO,"There are several good takeaways, including phrasing, solo motifs, dynamics, and practice techniques. But to me the most enjoyable part of the DVD was watching Antonio play, which he does quite a bit of, including playing along with some of the tunes he has played on with Chick Corea, Pat Metheny, and his own band. Watching his amazing technique and effortless playing is well worth the price of the DVD.",1371254400,,406,4.814285714285714
8268267,3,B00181FABO,ITS okay you know like its very good but it did not have like lessons for jazz and stuff he was doing a lot of just play along so its not that good #Yolo,1371081600,,153,3.5294117647058822
8268268,5,B00181FABO,"It's interesting in that I find this DVD can be trying at times.  Not that the content is poor or substandard ... quite the opposite!! Antonio Sanchez is a remarkable drummer who, on this DVD, offers his 'students' an in-depth insight into his remarkable talent! It's overwhelming at times, which makes it worth watching again and again and again!!",1344297600,,348,4.898305084745763
8268269,5,B00181FABO,"Antonio really gives some good advice and points you in the right direction. If you're a new drummer looking for technique, this is not for you. This is a video that will allow you to dive deeper into the heart of a musician. To feel the music. To really understand it and flow with the band. In fact, I recommend this for beginners only to start learning about the idea of being a musician. This is much more suited for experienced players though. Yet, it is great and I admire Sanchez!",1279584000,,487,4.362637362637362
