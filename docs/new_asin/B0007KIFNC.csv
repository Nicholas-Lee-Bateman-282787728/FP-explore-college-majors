2215599,4,B0007KIFNC,"Finally, the people behind this addictive model search competition have released season one on DVD. Set on three discs, this nine-episode extravaganza where model-wannabes try their hardest to become the next big thing is entertainment at its best.  Who can not root for the underdogs (Adrianne and Elyse) when one religious queen bee (Robin) tries to spoil it for them.  And if that isn't enough, how can one not adore the world's first supermodel (as she loves to call herself) judge Janice Dickinson.  Her tell-it-like-it-is attitude makes for a fun and sometimes jaw-dropping experience.  The DVD package comes with some bonus features like Casting Call, Reliving the First Season, The Two Jays (the art director/make up artist Jay Manuel and the runway diva Jay Alexander).  Yet as engrossing as Cycle One tries to be, the end result is a little disappointing.  Take the episodes, for instance.  Why, oh why were some re-edited (like the missing Tyra response over a shot of one girl's fingers in her bikini bottom loops)?  Less is definitely not more in this case.  And where are the added un-aired scenes ?  The show was filmed 24/7 for eight weeks.  Surely tons of footage was available.  Too bad executive producers Tyra Banks and Ken Mok didn't use any of it. It sure would have helped Cycle One still be in the running towards becoming America's best DVD package.  Let's hope Cycle Two fares even better.-----Martin Boucher",1113696000,7,1434,4.949790794979079
2215600,2,B0007KIFNC,"I was going to write a long review about how much I loved ANTM on TV, an how disappointed I was in the DVD. I was going to go on a rant about censorship, and how a reality show should never be censored for television if it is being marketed for DVD. I was going to write a long review about all of these things, but then I thought ""why bother""? no body cares anyway. Viacom doesn't care, UPN doesn't care, and CBS doesn't care. this is what happens when billion dollar conglomerates control Hollywood. they don't give a rats ass about the audience, and they just what to sell us low quality DVD's like this. if they ever put season 2 on DVD, I hope they put a bit more effort into it than they did season 1.

my wish list for season 2:

1. uncensored video footage.

2. two audio tracks, one censored for TV, and the other uncensored for DVD.

3. extra video footage that was never aired on TV, and extended judging panel footage, similar to the extra videos that are shown on the website.

4. photo gallery, and model biography, and a where are they now text bio.

5. a video introduction to every episode by tyra banks, or at least one of the producers.",1113177600,12,1155,4.2272727272727275
2215601,4,B0007KIFNC,"Being a huge fan of the tv series, I was practically first in line at the store to buy this one. (I couldn't wait to have it shipped to my house.) It's great to watch your favorite episodes without the interruptions of commercials. So two thumbs up for that. I was a bit disappointed by the bonus features. The boxset's final disc (all nine episodes and bonus features are provided on three discs) shows merely a few moments of inital castings and how the girls were chosen. It also shows a few interviews with Jay Manuel (the make-up artist) and Jay Alexander (the runway coach). I was hoping for more footage of the girls' catfights and behind the scene footage of the judging sessions. All in all the first season on DVD is great but I hope UPN provides us with a bit more when the second season comes out.",1113091200,,809,4.4
2215602,5,B0007KIFNC,"Watching this made me angry all over again that Elyse was eliminated. She was obviously the best, but putting all that aside this show is so awesome. It's probably the stupidest concept ever but the show works. I love that it shows the true cattiness of girls and sometimes impossible demands of a slowly being choked to death on it's own vomit industry. Watch for Tyra's overdubbing throughout. Hilarious.",1112486400,,406,4.898550724637682
2215603,5,B0007KIFNC,"America's Next Top Model, or The Model Show as I like to call it, is as addicting and appealing as sugar. I can't get enough.

An avid fan since the very first episode (much to my embarrassment at first), I was quick to buy this season. I was also quick to judge. I taped every episode and watched them constantly so I noticed if there was something missing from this collection. Yes, they left some things out. In the first episode when Janice Dickinson critiques Katie for hooking her fingers into the bottom of her bikini, Tyra says, ""I'm a little insulted. I was on the cover of Sports Illustrated with my fingers hooked in the bottoms of my bathing suit."" Janice then says, ""She's got a lot of work to do to catch up to you, Miss Thing."" Tyra's quote is cut out on the DVDs, possibly because of conflicts with Sports Illustrated. Still, it made me worry that other pieces were cut out as well.

Elyse Sewell is my favorite. Her various rants and sarcastic attitude make for good TV. It doesn't hurt that she's gorgeous.

As Tyra states on the few extras on the DVDs (which include footage of interviews for other seasons), the first season is special because it began the whole thing.

If you're interested, take a chance regardless of what your friends might say. I did, and I don't regret it at all. Buy it, love it, and watch it. It is awesome.",1112313600,3,1352,4.417670682730924
2215604,4,B0007KIFNC,"AMERICA'S NEXT TOP MODEL (ANTM for short) was brought in during the Summer of 2003 for 9 episodes, and became a huge hit for UPN.  And why not?  The first season showed 10 beautiful women who ranged from an atheist brainy waif to a bald black lesbian and some Bible thumpers - all put through their paces and taught how to walk and pose - let the catfights begin!  It was great television and a surprise hit that did well with women and men for being fun, smart, and interesting.  The DVDs offer all nine broadcast episodes, a look at the casting process, a recap of the first season, and a feature on the two Jays (make-up man and catwalk coach).  It's on three DVDs, and the shows look like when they aired (a little spotty in places, but bright and colorful).  It takes a lot to be a model, and this show proved it.  The girls faced bikini waxes, posing with snakes, nudity, and being set loose alone in Paris with tons of appointments and no directions.  This is a great show no matter what you think of models!  Great stuff!",1111017600,27,1029,4.317708333333333
2215605,5,B0007KIFNC,"I have been watching this show ever since it's first season and I have gotten 4 people hooked on the show, two which are straight men. This season has some amazing great characters for television: a religious nut, the all american blonde, the brainiac, etc.. The show gives the girls different photo shoots everyweek which are challenges within themselves and you get to see how they are GREAT and how they AREN'T. The main reason why this show will be adicting to anyone that watches it is if you are critical of yourself you will definately love this show. Everyone has their option of how this girl could have done one task better than the other. And like those who watch Survivor or  any other reality show, you find yourself rooting for at least one of the girls to wub and waiting for others to finally leave.",1110758400,10,815,4.54421768707483

This is a fun show to watch and alot of the girls are great models. I would recomend this dvd for anyone who has seen the show. I have never seen the first cycle but i was addicted to cycle 2 and 3 and now that 4 has started i gonna probably obsess over that. I just love this show its great, i think you should watch the show on wednesday on UPN to see what it's about if you havnt seen to much of it, but be warned! you will be addicted to it! lol",1110499200,4,627,3.90625

2215638,5,B0007KIFNC,"As you can see from my amazon reviewer name, this is my favorite show! Take 10 girls, all different, put them in a house, show them the ""a model's life"" and you get America's Next Top Model! You have: Shannon, the innocent christian teen, Adrianne, the rebel who had a hard life in the middle of Illinois, Gisele, the somewhat annoying teen who was a dancer, and clearly had it easy when she was younger, Kesse, the loveable one, whom came from a hard relationship with her family, Ebony, the bald black lesbian, who stirs up some controversy in the house. Theres also Tessa, who was really nice, Nicole, who was practically obsessed with her boyfriend!! Katie, who looks like a pornstar, and was very privileged, Robin, the complete psycho christian bitch, who stuffs her beliefs down everyone's throats. And last, but damn sure not least, theres Elyse, who admits she didn't really want to be a model, she just tried out for fun. This was a dynamic cast, and its fun to pick your favorites and watch and hope that they make it til the end! And you hope that the ones you hate get eliminated early on!

2215642,5,B0007KIFNC,"Dear Tyra:

I love this show. I stumbled on it quite by accident, probably during rerun times. I never had any interest in modeling, but your show grabbed me and held on.

I find it amazing that some of these girls, so homely you would not look even once at them in a supermarket,photograph like goddesses! That's why I watch the show, to see what these girls do on film. Your photo shoots are so outrageous I don't think they'll work, but they do! You know, like pouring paint, candy, meat,etc all over these girls and it works out.

I love  your work ethic and how you try to put it into the girls who are either too lazy, scared or unconfident and begin sabotaging themselves. Especially the little 20 yr old blond twit on season #10(?) that washed out because she thought wearing $700 skirts was immoral. She admitted she was never in the show for the long run. She hated people telling her what to do. Well, my prayers are with you in the REAL world!!  By not saying this up front, she demolished the chances of another girl who would have worked for it. I know you hate quitters, Tyra and rightfully so.

I love Miss Jay. He makes me laugh so hard. He'd be so much fun at a party. And he/she knows his/her stuff when it comes to modeling.

My wishes for next season:

1. No more cat fights! Seen one, seen 'em all! Yawn. I've taken to changing the channel while the stupid bickering goes on and on....Use this valuable time to show us more photo shoots.

2. Please no more machine gun editing! It makes us work too hard to see what the girls are wearing. And the constant, thudding background music gives us a headache.

3. Keep taking the girls to exotic locales and subjecting them to stressful situations. It makes them stronger in the long run.

Other than a few suggestions, I love the show and have compltely stopped watching American Idol of which is on at the same time as ANTM.",1208476800,,1892,4.361823361823362

I decided to buy it and was not disappointed at all. i think it was one of the best out of all the cycles.  Maybe because it was the original, i'm not sure but they show all the girls getting bikini waxes..lol, a big fight that ends in a religious prayer, a nude photo shoot that some aren't willing to do because of their morals or religious beliefs, its just an awesome show.  if you haven't seen it i would recommend buying it..its worth every penny!!!",1205020800,2,736,4.034246575342466

2215660,5,B0007KIFNC,"America's Next Top Model is a successful reality TV show because the bulk of the show has the contestants doing different things, and what they do is interesting.  Creator and host Tyra Banks is out to prove to the world that modeling isn't just about smiling and looking pretty.  She has the girls compete in every possible arena related to modeling - which includes weekly photo shoots, acting, public speaking and publicity appearances, and traversing non English speaking cities alone with nothing more than a map and a dictionary.  The show is a crash course in modeling 101, and each week one model fails to pass.  Voting is based on competitive challenges and a panel of judges who evaluate the girl's best photo of the week.  The weekly photo shoots appear loosely based on past photos taken of Tyra.  She relishes making the girls ""suffer"" the life of a model by freezing on the top of a skyscraper in bikinis in the winter, and suffering with a smile while posing with snakes and other creepy critters.  The show gets particularly interesting when the final five contestants are flown to Paris to prove they can make it as European models.  The insight into the modeling business is quite appealing as the girls audition with real Parisian clients (called ""go-sees"") and the final two participate in a real life runway show.

It is entertaining to watch a group of average looking girls transform on film, through training and lots of makeup, into real models.  The characters in cycle 1 are so diverse that the interpersonal segments- ""life in the house""- are fairly interesting.  The final five breaks down into the bible belt vs. Adrian and Elise.  Adrian speaks as if she is on heroin, and Elise makes the show because she's actually very intelligent.  Elise's educated ranting on the painfully stupid other girls is very entertaining (although despite being smart enough to make it into Med school, she is obviously anorexic).  Particularly interesting is the episode when the bible thumping model wanna-be's refuse to pose nude.  Cycle 1, lacking the budget, sets, and pizzazz of future cycles of the show, is perhaps the best of all of them.  Tyra has yet to go over the top with her challenges (like making the girls pose in drag or as murder victims), and the cast was diverse enough to be appealing to more than 14 year olds.  [...].  If you like reality TV, America's Next Top Model Cycle 1 will be a pleasant diversion.",1180137600,3,2441,4.771428571428571
2215661,4,B0007KIFNC,I channel surf a lot and sometimes i watch the rerun marathons on MTV. What i can't stand is Miss J. So freakin' gay. This guy/girl dresses like a woman with bands in his hair. When he's not on America's Next Top Model he's(or she) is on the E Channel for the fashion police. He criticizes all these female and male celebrities about how bad they dress and he dresses 100 times worse than the celebrities. I'm gay and out of the closet but this Miss J gives gay men a very bad name. Not all gay men are girly or queeny. And seeing Miss J dress like a woman on every show is pathetic.  Every time i see him on the show i just want to punch his face in. Bring back Janice Dickenson. Oh yeah. She was too good for the show and left. Thank God! Who wants to sit next to Miss J.,1172275200,3,773,3.9551282051282053

2215663,2,B0007KIFNC,"Cycle 5 is by far the most fun to watch...especially Jade!  That whole season was about her.  Too bad she was 2nd runner up.  I'm going to have to wait for Cycles 2 - 4 to come out first.  Hurry up and release these, so I can get Cycle 5.",1158451200,,238,3.7
2215664,3,B0007KIFNC,"Besides the photographs and the design, there is completely no other reason to watch this ridiculous show. The part I find hilarious is that these girls let themselves be ridiculed and accept the ""judges"" rude and sometimes untrue comments to the fullest without saying anything back. Well, Jade tried and look what happened to her. Tyra with the huge forehead kicked her out. Perhaps Jade carries a knife in her hair, that would explain all the backstabbing she did on the show. I also thought her exit was overly sentimental.

But truly, the ridicule towards the models on this show is unnecessary and I think all of them including Banks, Barker etc. are getting complete personal enjoyment and some form of revenge. And besides, the photos depend about 80% on the photographers and the rest on the models. When taking photo shoots in actual life, the models take hundreds of photos, not ten or fifteen.

Anyway, I watch this show solely because of the photos; they are professional and photography rather interests me. But watching Tyra's hideous face gets rather boring and frustrating after a while. The funniest girl out of all cycles I found to be the farmer girl who used to cry every five seconds or so. I do not particularly recollect her name, but she is certainly ""unforgettable"". The drama on this show is unreasonable and should be seriously cut down.

I would never want to participate in this whole scandal. Watching from the sidelines is rather humorous, but actually being on the show itself would be humiliating among lots of other things. Not only I would punch Tyra right into her ugly face, but also knock out ""Miss Jay"". I have absolutely nothing against homosexuals, but that so called persona takes it completely over the top. I do not know how he lives with himself.

If you do not support my opinion that does not affect or offend me in any way. Everyone is entitled to their own choice.

Thank you for reading.

2215665,5,B0007KIFNC,"America's Next Top Model has to be the best reality show on t.v.! I love this show so freakin' much. Who knew Supermodel Tyra Banks had such a brain behind that killer bod? The concept of the show is simple: 10 or more beautiful women complete for the title of America's next top model, they will sign a contract with a famous modeling agency and become the next ""it girl"" around the world. Cycle 1 was a great season, Adrienne Curry won the first season (much derseved), and now she is married to Christopher Knight aka Peter Brady! The most funniest thing about this show is the hilarious, vulgar, and obsessed with a scapple, former supermodel and judge, Janice Dickinson, she is so mean to the girls that you can't believe how nuts she is, poor thing still believes she is still famous, get some counseling honey. The photo shoots are the best segment of the show, great photographers show up and the results are incredible of these wanna-be models. I have seen every season of this hit show, and I plan on watching all the ones they do in the future, I highly recommend this killer show.",1150761600,6,1092,4.52020202020202
2215666,5,B0007KIFNC,"This show is addicting fun and Season 1 is by far the best, chock full of memorable participants! In this season you have ""bitchy"" Elyse who is the most entertaining to watch and keeps you from going insane at the stupidity of some of these models.  You have ""religious"" Robin, who will have you laughing out loud at her unbelievableness.  You also have the all-around ""bad-girl"" Adrianne Curry who you might recognize from her later career highlights such as Surreal Life, that Peter Brady show, oh and Playboy.  There are many more entertaining reality characters and Tyra Banks is not so annoying as in later seasons. You also have the FABULOUS Janice Dickinson as a judge, in true classic form. Janice IS the world's first supermodel and has been well-preserved.

The format of this reality show is very similar to others; the hamsters learn something, reward challenge, main challenge, judging, someone is booted.  I feel that besides the DRAMA, the show offers an interesting look of the modeling side of the fashion business.  This season is never boring!",1139788800,6,1062,4.938202247191011

It's great to watch your favorite episodes without the interruptions of commercials. So two thumbs up for that. I was a bit disappointed by the bonus features. The boxset's final disc (all nine episodes and bonus features are provided on three discs) shows merely a few moments of inital castings and how the girls were chosen. It also shows a few interviews with Jay Manuel (the make-up artist) and Jay Alexander (the runway coach). I was hoping for more footage of the girls' catfights and behind the scene footage of the judging sessions. All in all the first season on DVD is great but I hope UPN provides us with a bit more when the second season comes out.",1126137600,7,809,4.4
2215680,3,B0007KIFNC,"America's Next Top Model is very, very good. I'm a person who knows my Louis Vuitton from my Gucci, so I was quite pleased to see this new reality show that does not have anything to do with backstabbing, eating dead or raw creatures, and stepping onto a map, in front of some non-smiling host. America's Next Top Model is very good, as it features all the aspects of becoming a model in the real world.

That said, however, Cycle 1 was less than satisfactory. The 10 contestants made for very fast movement and very short reality TV (six episodes!!) and I felt quite outraged that the judges did not show enough spunk like they are doing now in Cycle 4 (save for Janice, who always has spunk).

The whole show is very enjoyable, and I very much liked Miss Jay Alexander, who knew his stuff. Runway and strutting are important parts of modelling, and the tips he gave were practical and useful.

This DVD provides many uses - a night of fun with your girl-friends, a fun party-game, or a night of apparaising the various models as they strutted to the top.

I love how the challenges are actually relative to the ultimate prize. Another great thing is that the judges (especially Tyra Banks) seem to really care about the girls; they're not just around to make nasty comments. Plus, the various conflicts between the girls may be staged, but they provide that just-right amount of mindless fun that's necessary. This first season is especially good, since the contestant's personalities were very strong (I couldn't get enough of Elyse/Robin cattiness!)

10 minutes was enough.

This is a great show, and made even greater by the attitude of Tyra, her judges and all of the folks who work the photo shoots.  Their general attitude is that these women are creating art with their bodies -- this is not how they look or act or pose in real life.  They're playing a role.  There's even a memorable scene on the DVD with pictures of Tyra before and after makeup.

Not only is it a great and entertaining show -- but it sends a great message to young women, and shows that models aren't ""just another pretty face.""",1117497600,3,711,4.153284671532846
2215685,5,B0007KIFNC,"I first saw ANTM on VH1 when they were airing reruns of cycle 4.  I never expected to find the show interesting, much less addictive!  The one thing that got me hooked were the photo shoots every episode.  They are not boring everyday, wear a dress, lingerie or bikini and pose sexy.  They were creative, artistic and showed that everyone in this business has to be artistically inclined, even the models themselves.  If it was the goal of Tyra Banks to show the world that it takes more than a pretty face and a nice body to be a model, she has definently achieved it.  We also see in the show that initial judgments based on appearance can mean nothing in the end, as the winner was someone Tyra would have never expected to win.  The prettiest girls with the nicest bodies were eliminated one by one because they were missing something the best girls had and that was personality.  Not only is the show entertaining, it illustrated something very important about modeling, a reality that most do not see.  It takes more than just looking pretty and having a toned body, it takes discipline and a having a personality that shines through to make you look even more beautiful.  I hope this speaks out to the young girls out there that emotional and intellectual development is more important than physical beauty.  Looks won't get you everywhere.

I highly recommend this show for fans of the fashion industry and for those looking for a quality show, especially in the overly saturated ""reality tv"" genre.",1117497600,3,1507,4.666666666666667
2215686,5,B0007KIFNC,"Show the world how human you are. ~Tyra Banks

America's Next Top Model reveals the complex decisions, responsibilities and intellectual challenges models face on a daily basis. Not only are contestants required to navigate the streets of Paris, two even participate in a major fashion show.

The most exciting part of the show is definitely the challenges the contestants face. The desire to overcome all obstacles seems to be the key to traversing the distance between obscurity to fame.

During each show, a panel of fashion experts decides on who will be cut from the show. Dreams are dashed as beautiful women show weaknesses and character flaws.

The bikini wax session was a little much but did show what women have to endure for beauty. The models then endure cold temperatures to model swimsuits on a rooftop. While this does show endurance, it made me wonder why they didn't fly these girls to a warmer location for a weekend.

The physical stress was something I had never considered. The photo shoots were often very energetic and you can see why models need to be young. Robin is the oldest model and seems to play the roll of mom more than model for the most part. Her religious beliefs create an interesting interplay between Elyse and Adrianne who then become friends when Robin becomes a little too controlling. Elyse made me laugh quite a bit with her witty naughtiness and my heart went out to Adrianne who wanted to win like it was life itself and survives food poisoning. Fortunately they get to live it up in Paris later and Adrianne's amazing strength pays off.

Robin ends up in a Garden of Eden type setting (complete with a snake) and also has to make decisions about nude photo shoots. I thought the show went a bit far with the photo shoot in Paris, especially with such young participants.

The stress of competition brings out a great deal of insecurity and self-esteem issues become apparent. Enduring all the criticism alone would cause anyone stress. Tyra Banks is one tough cookie when it comes to dealing out the dirt on every wrong move and every fault. She completely scrutinizes every aspect of each photo shoot and I can't say she is wrong about anything she says to the girls. Her eye for detail is exquisite and she also tried to give the girls a boost in their confidence with carefully selected positive comments.

I remember the days of being 135 pounds and walking on a catwalk in a swimsuit and heels and I will say that these girls are ten times nicer than any of the girls I had to compete with back in my high school days. I wish I'd watched this before my last photo shoot because there were many elements about how to make your eyes more vibrant that I hadn't really considered. I knew eyes were important, but Tyra really emphasizes this point and also makes you think about how the world views intelligent women.

Tyra Banks has done young women a great favor by creating this show. Not only can women see dreams come true, they can see how to avoid nightmares. If you have strong religious beliefs, modeling has many challenges. You are in a no mercy environment where materialism is paramount and you are basically a canvas upon which the world of fashion wants to paint. I was shocked they would cut Adrianne because she was almost dying of food poisoning. That really disturbed me for various reasons. She could have easily completed the test they gave in 10 minutes, sometime later when she was feeling better.

I did gain a new respect for Top Models and the interviews show a full range of personalities and intelligence levels. Most of the contestants are more in competition with their own weaknesses than the other models. In this show, being late to a photo shoot can erase your chances in a heartbeat. As a model, your life is not really your own. Do you have to sell your soul for fame? You decide.

Fortunately there is not much ""clawing"" their way to the top and everyone seems to have normal problems like everyday women in the real world. I didn't even sleep last night, I just watched all six hours. It was that entertaining.
