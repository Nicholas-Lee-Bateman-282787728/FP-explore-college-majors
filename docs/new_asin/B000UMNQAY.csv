8213846,5,B000UMNQAY,"I bought this set for ""Christmas Castles,"" which I fondly remembered from 2000.  The CC disc contains four full length episodes of this beautiful show, complete with the graphics that bracketed the commercial breaks originally. I am not sure how many episodes of the show were made, but I know of one, which I still have on a VHS tape I recorded of ""HGTV Christmas Stuff,"" which featured Madison's Montpelier.  Since that time, the Montpelier mansion has undergone extensive renovation to return it to its appearance during President Madison's lifetime. This could be why that particular episode was omitted, but it is a shame, because it was also charming (and 2 other mansions were shown) The omission does make me wonder if there were other episodes produced, which did not make it onto this disc.
The other HGTV Christmas shows are fine, but I doubt I would have made the effort to buy them on their own. In short, I wish ""Christmas Castles"" had been given its own disc set, especially if there are more episodes than the ones I know of. But, I am giving this set a full 5 stars because the shows look beautiful, and it was worth it for me. Highly recommended for people who love the Holiday season, decorating, and entertaining, but also those who admire architecture and American history.",1383523200,,1294,4.746666666666667
8213847,3,B000UMNQAY,"I ordered this dvd  box set hoping it would have alot of info. on how to decorate in a really fun and creative way for the holidays. I thought the the first 2 dvd's to be slow and really boring.  The first one was a holiday decorating show with one family and it was filmed in a really boring way.  I guess the set was not what I expected. Since it was originally from HGTV, I expected the shows to be more fun to watch with better ideas for my own home decorations, like the Nate B.
show. It really fell short on ideas and enjoyment for me. I would not recommend to anyone.",1322438400,,574,4.017543859649122
8213848,5,B000UMNQAY,"I had searched high and low for a DVD of ""Christmas Castles""--a HGTV series from a few years back.  Hooray, this beautiful series of specials about American mansions and their Christmas decorations, plus their history, is included in this very nice set of DVD's.  The decorating segments would be enjoyable for anyone interested in home, holiday decor. I wasn't much in the mood for the holidays this year, but Ideas for the Holidays perked me right up!",1294099200,2,453,4.87012987012987
8213849,5,B000UMNQAY,I love decorating for Christmas and have boxes and boxes and boxes of decorations.  I found new uses for a lot of my old decorations and it was just fun to watch how creative people can be. The homeowners seemed to enjoy how their homes were transformed for the holidays.  Really enjoyed this DVD.,1248912000,5,297,4.481481481481482
