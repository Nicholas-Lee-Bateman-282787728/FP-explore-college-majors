2482210,4,B000E1OI8K,"Despite the kind of oppressively moody poster that empties theatres by painting it as a dour arthouse flick, Anna Reeves' Oyster Farmer is a pleasant surprise, an engaging comedy drama that flows along like a pleasant stretch of river. The plot is slight: Alex O'Loughlin robs a fish market with the aid of a pair of frozen lobsters and a fruit wrap and posts the money to himself on the stretch of his river where he's got a job on a failing oyster farm to fill in time while he waits for the postman. Only the money gets lost in the post before being cast adrift when the postman has a heart attack - which might seem a little contrived, but does allow the film to explore the various river dwellers he suspects may have ended up with the cash. It's no surprise that he finds love (with ""the bastard child of a s*** collector,"" no less) and the possibility of a real home and future, but the film is far more interested in its likeable characters than breaking new narrative ground, and, with the exception of Jack Thompson's redundant (in both senses of the word) Vietnam vet who seems to have been drafted in solely to add a bit of star power, they're all richly drawn or appealing enough for you to go along with it with no complaints.

It's an Australian film through and through, so, naturally for tax reasons, it's technically a British co-production, which meant going to the absurd extremes of buying film stock from the UK, shipping it to Australia, shipping it back to England to be processed, doing the post-production in the UK and hiring a UK composer and actor to rack up enough points to qualify for those all important sale-and-leaseback requirements. Naturally, the film was never released in the UK. Luckily the UK actor is Bishop Brennan himself, Jim Norton (who gets throttled in one scene but not kicked in the arse by a priest, although he does get to give mouth to mouth to a dog). He gets all the best lines and all but walks off with the movie, but all the cast are on good form here, turning in likeable and believable performances that draw you into the not just the characters and the film but the place itself: take a bow David Field, Kerry Armstrong, Diana Glenn et al. Quietly delightful. The only downer is that the DVD has been needlessly panned-and-scanned from its original 2.35:1 ratio to 1.85:1.",1148256000,5,2334,4.5439429928741095
2482211,4,B000E1OI8K,"If Hemingway's ""Old Man and the Sea"" is about fishing, then ""Oyster Farmer"" is about oyster farming. The story begins with a young man Jack Flange, who robs a fish market and mails the cash to an isolated village where oyster farming is the key business. When the parcel goes missing, he is forced to join the rest as oyster farmer and finds his suspects.

His evaluation of the villagers and interpretation of happenings in the village is solely about finding the bad guy who steals his money. Unfortunately, all his efforts are in vain. People there just care about how to grow better ""oysters""; a father tries to reconcile with his daughter; a divorced husband tries to reconcile with his wife; a divorced woman tries to prove herself as a good oyster farmer. Getting rich is not in their equation of living.

Jack's search for the money and the greedy guy and the villagers' search for love and harmony forms the dialectic theme of the story. The village becomes the lost horizon for the city boy and the oyster becomes his salvation. The black, rough, and dirty shell of the oyster and the white, smooth and juicy oyster meat serves as vital symbol to guide us through the film. The meaning and implication of ""Oyster Farmer"" are soul reaching and rich. If it is not as great as Hemingway's, it is surely a good dose of chicken soup for the mind of metropolitan. Happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing I know - Ernest Hemingway (1899 - 1961)",1144022400,13,1459,4.607692307692307

I really don't want to let any viewer know just what the movie

is about (the Amazon synopsis is very accurate), so I won't give

any specifics about the movie.  I would prefer that you WATCH THIS MOVIE!!  The acting is superb, and the scenery for the

photography is even more amazing.  I loaned this movie to another ""movie aficianodo"" and she was as enthusiastic about its quality as well.

Although the story includes a robbery, it is a rather calm (but not boring!) movie - just not the kind of action-packed film some people might expect from O'Loughlin (which means the movie is not ""Hawaii Five-O""-style with things blowing up and lots of action).",1332806400,,544,4.666666666666667
2482305,4,B000E1OI8K,"There is a plot running here but it's rather loose and takes a back seat to the human element.

Here's the scoop. Jack Flange takes his sister to a New South Whales river town where the main industry is oyster farming. She's going through physical rehab after a car accident. The insurance is about to run out and they're way shy of dough. He pulls off an armored car robbery to get the necessary funds. He cleverly mails the ill gotten gains to himself but it never arrives leading him to suspect those around him of being less than forthright.

That's the basic plot but it nowhere near covers what happens here. Much of the movie is us meeting the locals and getting to know a bit about oyster farming. Jack and his sister are orphans and these people get to resemble family. His boss is separated from his wife who is trying to get the oyster thing going herself. Jack is falling for a local gal that has a thing for shoes. Other members of the community all have their slice of the story. They're an odd lot to be sure but they live an odd existence. There are no roads, so people cart each other up and down the river if their boat isn't working that particular day. It's a very cloistered community with its own cock-eyed way of moving. At a certain point Jack realizes he won't see that money and that's what this movie is all about.

You like these people. They aren't all good but they aren't all bad. Even knock down, drag out fights don't end in long lasting hard feelings. They work hard when they need to and drink lots of beer when they aren't working.

The writing, acting and production are all good as they need to be to pull this off. You can pick at this, that or the other thing but, overall, this is a very satisfying watch.",1326326400,,1746,4.314024390243903

2482309,5,B000E1OI8K,"Summary: After his sister is debilitated by a car accident, Jack Flange moves from the city out to the middle of nowhere to work as an oyster farmer closer to where his sister's going through rehabilitation therapy. He has a bright idea to make the money she needs to keep going with the therapy, but it all backfires and while he stresses out over what to do, he forges a life for himself in the backwater community finding friends, love and a place to call home.

I will start off by admitting that I absolutely love the Australian accent. I worked with a guy in Canada who'd come from Australia only a handful of years before I met him, and I would sit and talk to him just to hear the accent! He was great, he indulged me, and he got a kick out of my delight.

So the fact that this film was made in Australia, and all the actors are not only Australian but actually speak like they are, was great fun for me.

Because I have (sadly) never been to Australia, and even if I had I probably wouldn't have wound up in locations Oyster Farmer was filmed in, this movie fascinated me. I know nothing about oysters nor the farming thereof...in fact, I don't eat seafood at all, let alone know how it's raised or harvested (aside from vague notions). So purely from the aspect of learning something new, of being exposed to a life very foreign to me, I loved the gritty no-holds-barred reality portrayed. This Yank is suitably impressed.

And now on to the only reason I watched this movie to begin with: Alex O'Lachlan. No, I didn't misspell it, mates. As most Alex-admirers are aware, he was born Alexander O'Lachlan and has some credits under that name - including this movie. Why he changed it to the different spelling of O'Loughlin, while still keeping the original pronunciation, is probably the one thing I'd ask him if I happened upon him one day, because I'd love to know!

(If anyone knows of something in print (or a recorded interview) where Mr. O. explains the change, please give me a heads-up. I like to have all the facts!)

While this movie was only made seven years ago - wow, has he really only been doing this for seven years? Really? Okay, eight, if you count his first credit in 2003 on the TV series White Collar Blue - wait, where was I? Oh, yeah. While this movie was only made seven years ago, I expected Alex to look, well...different. I remember the first time I saw Moonlight, after having already watched Hawaii Five-0, I was so struck by how much younger he looked as Mick St. John...and that wasn't as long ago as Oyster Farmer, so I thought he'd look younger yet.

But what surprised me was he pretty much looks just like he does now. Well, without the graying temples. *grin* He even looked younger as Michael in Feed, and I think I've figured out what it is that's made the difference for me. It's his haircut! In both Feed and Moonlight, his hair was longer, and when it's longer, it's wavier. (His hair was blond in Feed, to boot!) But when he's got the more McGarrett-like haircut, he pretty much looks the same whether it's seven years ago or today on the set of H50.

Sorry. Things like that bug me until I figure them out, and you're the unfortunate person I welcome to the windmills of my mind.

The other thing that's the same? The guy can act. From the moments where he's practically hurting himself laughing, to the moments where he's got tear-filled eyes...from the moments where he's having sex on the dock (splinters!) to the moments where he's committing a crime, Jack Flange shows a great deal of range for a man who's become more of an action hero of late with the advent of Steve McGarrett.

(Not that McGarrett doesn't have depth and layers - I don't want to start getting hate mail from die-hard AOL fans, as they sometimes call themselves!)

What I really and truly enjoyed about watching Mr. O. in this film was precisely that, though, and I have to be honest because it's the promised gut reaction I got from Oyster Farmer. He wasn't jumping off buildings or vamping out. He wasn't shooting automatic weapons or chasing bad guys. He was literally, simply, just being.

He was an ordinary man with real-life everyday problems (for an oyster farmer, anyway), heartaches, embarrassments and joys. The movie isn't heightened reality like H50 is. It's reality. It's the sort of film I've gotten used to seeing Alex's H50 co-star Scott Caan in, actually, and I'm finding the indie and indie-like movies more and more enjoyable to watch for both actors as I'm exposed to their work this way.

Why? Because it allows you to see so much more of the actor, in my humble opinion. Now, like I said, I don't want hate mail from people who say, ""He gets to show his whole range on Hawaii Five-0, how dare you say he doesn't!"" That's a conversation for another day. This is just me, how I see things, and watching the difference between an episode of H50 and Oyster Farmer has been a welcome chance to see what else Mr. O. is good at besides being BAMF! (Not that there's anything wrong with BAMF Alex, of course!)

What's funny is that my roommate - who was born in England and spent her childhood either there or in the Far East - hasn't liked Australian accents since her Far East days. So when I would play interviews that Alex has done - and when I tried to make her watch Oyster Farmer with me - she wouldn't watch or listen (or would do so under protest) because she didn't like hearing him speak! LOL! She doesn't mind when he wears the American accent, but would actually cringe when Alex was just talking in his normal voice.

Well, guess what? Oyster Farmer converted her. She admitted to me the other day that she actually likes listening to him speak naturally now. (And that's no small feat - she's pretty set in her opinions about things, so there you go, Alex O'Loughlin broke through the barrier.) *grin*

There were some LOL-funny lines in this movie, but I think my two favorite quotes are both from the character Brownie:

""Unzip your fly, your brains would fall out.""

and

""Don't just sit there fanning your balls, give me a hand with this pump.""

How did Oyster Farmer make me feel? Happy. Hopeful. I loved the cast, the location fascinated me, the glimpse into the hard life of oyster farmers was amazing. And Mr. O'Lachlan, as he was known back then, was an absolute joy to watch. So if you haven't yet, go buy it. Or at the very least, rent it. It's worth your while.

Here's a little bit of trivia for you: Jack Thompson, who plays the character Skippy in this movie, is the father of Alex's friend Patrick Thompson, who co-starred with Alex in the movie he and Patrick came up with the story for, Feed. Jack was also in Feed, as the character Richard. Patrick and Alex also appeared in the movie Man-Thing together.",1321660800,,6782,4.479740680713128
2482310,4,B000E1OI8K,"I bought this movie from Amazon strictly because of Alex O'Loughlin, who, even at this early stage in his acting career, was already an accomplished, charismatic young actor and a feast for the eyes !!  My God, he is truly gorgeous!  This movie portrayed, for me, as an American, a look into the little-known culture of oyster farmers and a stunningly beautiful tour of the Hawkesbury River in the equally fascinating continent of Australia. The low-key humor and salty dialog delivered by the likes of Jack Thompson and David Field were just a special treat. Alex's portrayal of a troubled young man who finds love and friendship in this isolated community is both endearing and heartfelt (with a delightful and rather steamy love scene thrown in!!)

Very cute story, well written, great actors - a movie worth watching.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.",1220313600,3,301,4.454545454545454
2482423,5,B000E1OI8K,"Alex O'Loughlin plays a very good part in this movie. It is amazing how
well he can play different characters. Example, Feed and Moomlight.
In Oyster Farmer he plays a gentle loving brother and how he adapts to
rough country living. Some of the scenes of the Australian  coastline
are just beautiful.",1217808000,2,300,4.769230769230769

2482427,5,B000E1OI8K,"I have one good reason as to why you should see this movie; Alex O'Loughlin (still spelled O'Lachlan for this early performance fresh out of acting school) You may know him as the mesmerizing and memorable Mick St. John from the series about our favorite humanitarian vampire/hero in Moonlight. He is the reason that this movie is so worthwhile.  The scenery in OF is beautiful and the storyline is sweet and engaging. If you are looking for action packed adventure and intense dialog, this movie is not for you.
If you want a sweet simple story with subtle Aussie humor, you will love this movie.  Alex is simply stunning to watch. Even this early role shows the depth of his ability to act.
Luckily you will see Alex in nearly every frame and what a frame he possesses. Not only can he act, he is a pleasure to gaze upon. It is hard to take your eyes off of him.
If you love Alex, this is a must for your collection. Buy it!!  You won't be sorry!  It is one of those movies you will watch again and again.",1215907200,2,1007,4.3121693121693125
2482428,2,B000E1OI8K,"I admit, I bought this movie because of Moonlight's gorgeous main character, Alex O'Loughlin. Not much plot and sort of difficult to follow.

It is a warm romantic film, often funny and very heartwarming.  It is filmed in Austrailia and the scenery is breathtaking. At times it is a little difficult to get past the accent but the charm of listening makes it worthwhile to rewind and relisten.  The major shortcoming to this dvd is that there are no filming or commentary extras.  I would have loved to have some comments from the actors and directors about the filming of various scenes, in addition to the normal deleted scenes found on most dvds.",1213228800,,633,4.566371681415929

Knowing the ways of a small group of oyster farmers in Australia and watching how they handle the wrong decisions of youth and normal everyday work, personal, and community life is just great; so different from what you would think and do... It just broadens your  views and provides you with interesting new knowledge and understanding. I do not agree that this is a comedy, as the CD indicates. But it does contain humor in the midst of human drama and human growth, and so takes you through a real life experience. This would not be possible without some really good acting and obviuos hard work in the establishment of wonderfully realistic connections among characters on screen.",1209254400,,842,4.847222222222222

I Loved, loved, loved this movie and if I were going to buy just one of his, this would be the one. I have seen almost all of his performances , seven total , and this one stands out for no other reason than he Lives and it ends happily. Without going into the plot to great extent, it does take place in New South Wales and was produced by Showtime Australia. It is gorgeous scenery and the music is pure aboriginal (I hope you know what I mean). You can see the boomerangs flying when you just listen. He made this four years ago(2004) and you can see how far he has come if you are a fan of the CBS show Moonlight. Highly recommend.

I loved it so much I bought it from Amazon.  I have watched it numerous times and still laugh just as much as I did the first time.

2482461,4,B000E1OI8K,"This one is definitely worth your time. You get a very interesting look at a subject you probably know nothing about: oysters and how they are raised. The movie is full of wonderfully odd characters, off-beat humor, and colorful language; these are truly people who march to their own beat, and the world be damned.

Look for Jack Thompson, the legendary Aussie actor who in this film plays the leader of a bunch of aging, reclusive jackpine savages, hard-bitten Vietnam vets (yes, there are Australian Vietnam vets). Listen carefully to their conversations; they've seen a lot in their time.

Listen also to the wonderful Irishman who clips up all the money, and uses the portraits on the bills to decorate a bathtub. That's something you don't see everyday.",1165795200,4,759,4.921875
