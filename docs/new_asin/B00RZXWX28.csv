6937912,5,B00RZXWX28,"I saw this in the movie theater & it was like 3 hours long, which isn't a bad thing.  This has been cut down by half.  I did not grow up in L.A. so learning about the scene & bands I have never heard of was fascinating!  I am now a fan of August Red Moon & A La Carte :)  Worth buying, watching & telling all of your friends!  METAL!",1438214400,5,333,3.6338028169014085
6937913,5,B00RZXWX28,"I had really high expectations for part 2 after watching the first installment, and I'm happy to say that it doesn't disappoint. It's refreshing to watch a documentary that focuses on the stuff that I care about: the bands, the musicians, the scene, the music and the sometimes hilarious stories that are shared throughout this series. Penelope Spheeris and VH1 could learn a thing or two about storytelling and integrity from these guys. Another must-have DVD!!!",1436659200,6,463,5.105263157894737

6937915,5,B00RZXWX28,FINALLY the true story of the L.A. Hard Rock And Metal scene told by the people who lived it ....  Also on a personal note its nice to Finally wash the bad taste in my mouth left all those years ago by that Hatchet Job Decline of The western civilization part II the metal years. which did nothing but kill the whole scene ... Only my personal view....  BUY THESE FILMS !!!!  You will not be Disappointed ..  AAAA+++  10 stars !!!,1435017600,5,430,4.195121951219512
8696628,5,B00RZXWX28,"6 STARS!! This is absolutely one of the best watches in a LONG time, goes deep into the L.A. hard rock scene from 1975-1981. I own approx. 700 rock concerts and docs on DVD/Blu and really, this one was so well done, so deep, many many interviews. You will learn so much you may have never known, how many played with others prior to making it, one big underground scene lead mainly by Van Halen ...BUY THIS NOW!!!!",1515024000,,414,4.32051282051282
8696629,4,B00RZXWX28,"This DVD is much better than the first if you're a fan of the 80's bands in my opinion.  You get more of the goods you're looking for!  They still throw in some of those older bands you've never heard of, but not so much this time around.",1501718400,,238,3.9375

8696634,2,B00RZXWX28,"I bought both Parts 1 & 2, and was disappointed in both, it's basically a guy who was on the seen in the early days that got some
other guys who were on the seen, most of which never made it any further than the local clubs, and they told some stories about the good old days on camera.
there was some interesting stuff about how the scene started, but they could have probably condensed all the interesting stuff down to about twenty minutes. very boring, it dragged a lot. The covers of the discs are misleading, The production is kind of Amateur, low budget.
I do not recommend these discs, save your money.",1468886400,,610,4.359649122807017
