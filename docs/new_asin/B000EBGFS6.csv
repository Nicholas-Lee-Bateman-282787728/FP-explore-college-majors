2514894,4,B000EBGFS6,"Very intense action with a good storyline. I tried to anticipate Clayton's (Scott Glenn) next move - but his demeanor was too compelling and demanded obedience. The few times he let his guard down was worth the wait.  I always enjoy movies featuring Harvey Keitel, and I was not disappointed. The direction was well paced with a balance of action, drama, and a bit of romance. This is a five star movie!!",1151280000,7,404,4.611111111111111
2514895,5,B000EBGFS6,"I loved this film! I loved the music, I loved the action, and I LOVED the actors. Also,it was not your typical love story, and that is what was interesting. A great film to sit back, have a margarita and to enjoy the ride!!",1150761600,6,223,4.090909090909091
2514896,5,B000EBGFS6,"Puerto Vallarta Squeeze is a classic action adventure movie a la Romancing the Stone -- the kind you turn on late on Sunday afternoon and watch unfold before you.

At first, in staying true to the genre, you think the movie is doing the thinking for you -- but soon a twist unfolds and you find yourself entwined in a real story line with a real script --something rare in the action/adventure genre.

Great movie. Kudos to the director and writer for making a sub-par book into a classic Sunday flick.",1150675200,8,502,4.5054945054945055
2514897,3,B000EBGFS6,"This movie has some well known actors, Harvey Keitel and Scott Glenn. Harvey Keitel plays CIA honcho Walter McGrane and Scott Glenn plays a rogue CIA assasin, Clayton Price, on the lam from the CIA after a hit he executes goes wrong. Price tricks/buys off a couple, a writer, Danny Pastor and Maria De Santos, his girlfriend, to take him through Mexico to the American border for $5,000. Pastor is desperate for money since he has not sold a book in awhile takes Price up on his offer despite the strong objections of his girlfriend, Maria.  Pastor is a total idiot and makes all the wrong decisions.  They are being chased by the CIA through the outback of Mexico, this does not stop them from hanging out in plain sight in some small Mexican towns.  This could've been a really good movie if not for some of the acting and bad or sometimes unbelievable story line.  All in all it is watchable. I'd rent this one instead of buy it.",1147737600,3,932,4.464705882352941
2514898,5,B000EBGFS6,This is a great movie for people who like action fleaks with a good plot.  Scott Glenn is great in this movie as a CIA hitman who kills someone who is not marked for a hit.  Harvey Keitel has a great role as his boss searching for him in the back roads of Mexico.  The movie has plenty of action and great scenes of Mexico. I recommend this film to all Scott Glenn and Harvey keitel fans--you will not be disappointed!!!!!!  I first rented this flick and now I want to buy it!!!!,1145318400,8,479,4.118279569892473

2514920,4,B000EBGFS6,"Got this because I'm a fan of Scott Glenn, always good to see him carry a movie. A movie with surprising heart and interesting situations between the characters. A big plus is that we visit Mexico and DO NOT have an evil Mexican crime lord 'Jefe'. The villain is American! Sort of a Bourne Identity for Scott Glenn, a role he handles superbly. The movie is a little long at parts (like the serenading dinner or the trips to the bus stop), but has a great conclusion that satisfies.",1334880000,,481,4.415730337078652
2514921,5,B000EBGFS6,"This is by all means an excellent film. It grabs you, holds you, and delivers a fast paced ride into action-adventure.
  A fine cast headed by the never disappointing Scott Glenn, Craig Wasson, and Giovanna Zacarias. Supporting roles are provided by Harvey Keitel, Jonathan Brandis, and Miguel Sandoval. Great acting all around.
 Lest we not forget, there is a wonderful bit by Vikki Carr whose voice has grown moody and mellow with age.
 Good storyline directed by Arthur Alan Seidelman who has previously given us a string of hit TV movies.
 Special mention must be given to the magnificent cinematography of Chuy Chvez. Superb lighting and camera work.
 This film deserved more attention then it received. It's high grade cinema.
 Don't hesitate.
 You'll enjoy it.",1251072000,2,767,5.08
2514922,1,B000EBGFS6,"If you're into made-for-tv quality movies, Puerto Vallarta Squeeze is for you. I wasn't expecting much and that's exactly what I got. I've seen a few movies with Scott Glenn where he was a supporting actor and that's where he should stay. In my opinion, he just wasn't very good as the lead and shouldn't be in the lead of an ""action"" film. He came across as way too old to be as lethal as he was portrayed to be that it pushed the envelop of believability. The ""love story"" aspect of the movie was laughable.

The premise of the movie is nothing new (which isn't a bad thing), but the production value and acting is made-for-tv quality or in this case, straight-to-video quality. Avoid this movie, not even Harvey Keitel could save it.",1249171200,3,736,4.492537313432836
2514923,4,B000EBGFS6,"I didn't expect much of this little movie. I just wanted to see it because it was one of the last films Jonathan Brandis would ever make. For such a small part, he is remarkable and regrettably there's not enough of him here. It's a surprisingly good film. Scott Glenn and Harvey Keitel are great as they always are. Craig Wasson was nice to see since I hadn't seen anything since his over the top performance in Body Double. The film is well written and well acted. Though it did have some shocking moments. Scott Glenn at his age is well preserved and I nearly fell onto the floor during the scene where he's wearing a string bikini. It was nice to see Jonathan Brandis as a wet behind the ears CIA hitman-in-training and a future replacement for the Scott Glenn's seemingly doomed Price. He looked very tired in this movie or was it just me? There's some shocking and notable scenes, this movie is not for the prudish at heart. Though there is a sex scene and visible nudity, the scene is tastefully done and conveys a sense of tender regard between the two characters of Luz and Price. There is notable violence and I came away from this movie with the sense that if you're ever stupid enough to go to Mexico, you should hire a bodyguard, preferrably one who can kill with his hands. All in all this was better than some of the swill that gets the studio treatment. So I highly recommend this if you're a fan of lush Mexican locales and actors who act for the pure joy of acting and not a paycheck. My summary: CIA hitman (Glenn) with emotional scars kills unintended target, gets trapped, needs help getting across the border and hires a down on his luck American writer and his beautiful but gutsy Mexican girlfriend with scars of her own. CIA handler on his trail with CIA hitman in training and heir apparent to Glenn's Price. Price, writer, girlfriend get into some nasty scrapes (terrifying scene involving local police), body count escalates, disagreements and suspicion about Price ensue, cameo by Vicki Carr, girlfriend and Price get close, (too close). CIA handler and trainee close in with one of the most tense and surprising endings I've seen in a while. Two thumbs way up.",1200787200,3,2190,4.575063613231552
2514924,2,B000EBGFS6,"Puerto Vallarta Squeeze, is a dark, conspiracy-laden movie, telling

a story that seems somewhat over-worked (considering the author felt

the need to have one of the protagonists profession be that of a

famed book writer).

It will also probably be of interest mostly to military veterans,

who can relate to the post-traumatic stress syndrome that

characterizes literally 100's of thousands of former personnel in

the well documented conflicts of Vietnam, and some of former covert

operatives of the CIA, as played by Scott Glenn, in this picture.

Apart from the interesting filmed aspects  of small-towns across

Northern Mexico, this picture also emphasizes its rural aspects and

abandoned villages, that obviously, are worlds apart from the major

Mexican cities or even, those of the USA, across the border. The

movie's action isn't entirely isolated, as the tourism hot spots are

also partly filmed, so the audience is able to see that the story

takes place in this day and age.

As said, apart from the psychological aspects that some may

appreciate, (the role being that of a burnt out, aging Vietnam vet,

turned CIA operative), the film also intertwines occasionally some

human aspects as well, such as the poverty of a segment of the

Mexican population, and the peasant beauty of the actress, played

intelligently, and charismatically by Giovanna Zacarias.

Surely, some may question the realism or even, the necessity of once

more bringing in the sterotype of Mexican women as maids, who are

easy to buy favors from,  and of Mexican men as police officers, law

enforcement, some of which are ""clearly"" corrupt.

Harvey Keitel is brought in, to add some spice from time to time, in

the movie, and rescue it from a made-for-TV only stigma, that

otherwise might discourage DVD rental customers, or buyers. Kietel

only mostestly appears in the movie, and isn't given a chance to do

much with his role, or play out  anything remotely close to the

powerful impact some of his previous movies allowed him to do.

The audio, music is acceptable, if not a bit repetitive, and the

classic score too identical to what we've heard 100's of times

before. This is mitigated with the flamenco guitar that is also

interspersed in the soundtrack, to emphasize the Mexican-ness of

this movie.

Overall, not a bad experience, but not something that people will

want to see a second time.",1173916800,4,2407,4.992405063291139
2514925,5,B000EBGFS6,"This is a wonderful, not well known (at least to me) flick with a great plot and a lot of humor thrown in.",1168646400,4,106,3.652173913043478
2514926,4,B000EBGFS6,"Usually these unknown direct to video flicks don't have much going for them other than formulaic plot and maybe a few stars. Both those elements are apparent in ""Puerto Vallarte Squeeze"" (cast includes Scott Glenn, Harvey Keitel, Miguel Sandoval, Craig Wasson and Giovanna Zacaras) but this movie has good action, believable acting and an outstanding script that only one time goes off into predictably silly behavior.

The movie itself is a pretty typical action-suspenser. Glenn goes down to Mexico and kills a couple guys for revenge, then makes a deal with Wasson and girlfriend Zacarias to help him escape. The trio are pursued by cops including American Keitel -- who is very poorly directed and whose role is overly mechanical and macho -- and a Mexcican crew led by Sadoval. A chase ensues, along with some other predictable and unpredictable action, before our film comes to a familiar and somewhat foretold conclusion.

I didn't have high hopes for this movie and it exceeded my expectations in everything but the cardboard characterization Keitel got stuck with. Scott Glenn gives a typical low-key performance and is countered by Wasson, who gives a heart of sleeve performance when stressed. The girlfriend seems to moderate the two extremes and is a nice makeweight for their combat.

I'd recommend this movie to anyone that likes any of the actors, action, suspense, or simple film enjoyment. This movie is about as unpretentious as they come and is has a very intelligent script that keeps you involved all the way. I wish Keitel's character had been written better but the movie overcomes that brief problem, aided in large part by sweeping Mexican (probably Californian) vistas in many scenes.

Note: this movie is also known as ""Puerto Vallarte"".",1162684800,8,1765,5.075862068965518
2514927,4,B000EBGFS6,"An American writer and his Mexican girlfriend witness an assassination in Puerto Vallarta.  Soon they and the assassin are on the run to the US border, pursued by the CIA and Mexican police.  I won't say much more about the plot, because the suspense depends on watching it unwind.

Scott Glenn is impressive as the assassin with a mysterious past and uncertain intentions, stony-faced and tough but also charming when needed.  Harvey Keitel is more relaxed than usual as the cynical CIA man in charge of recovering Glenn.  Four of the the five key roles are very well cast and played, and the fifth could be regarded as appropriately wooden.  The characters drew me in and held my attention.

The plot is strong and well thought out, save for a few weak points that aren't too hard to look past.  So-so ending could have used a little more work.  The suspense and action are handled better than the romance, which is uneven in its portrayal but still compelling enough.  There is a significant amount of psychological interaction between the main characters, who develop in a satisfying way.  The feel of the film is less slick than typical Hollywood products but still fairly smooth, with a little independent film aura, for better and worse.  The action is budget but fine.

Enough interesting things going on in this to make it worth seeing more than once.",1161388800,4,1360,4.760683760683761

8108259,4,B000EBGFS6,"This is a slightly flawed but very fine character-driven film, quite well-made if a bit uneven. Beautifully shot and acted for the most part, though the direction and script are occasionally not up to the rest of the films quality; sometimes heartfelt and realistic, sometimes a tad contrived.

Part melodrama, part romance, part chase / road movie, the script is based on the novel of the same name by Robert James Waller. It is much more of a character study than an action flick, with several ironic turns and a bittersweet but satisfying climax.

Wasson is excellent as the over-the-hill author trying to find his writing mojo in Mexico. As are Glenn as the renegade CIA button man, and Keitel as his CIA nemesis hot on his trail. But Giovanna Zacarfas, who plays Luz, the Mexican woman caught in the middle, nearly steals the show. The characters are well-developed & three-dimensional, and you really care what happens to them.

Thankfully, the movie doesnt rely on violence, guns, shootouts, car explosions, etc., which always cheapen stories. There are 2 or 3 brief violent scenes to ratchet up the tension, but kudos to the writer, Richard Alfieri, who chose to focus on the characters instead of gratuitous violence. The fact that it was beautifully shot on location in Puerto Vallarta (on film, not DV) really helps, as does the gorgeous acoustic guitar soundtrack.

Despite the occasional uneven dialogue & direction, I liked it a lot. It is definitely worth watching again.",1484524800,,1486,4.955823293172691

8108263,2,B000EBGFS6,"Based on the novel by the name, the thriller Puerto Vallarta Squeeze, was a story that never should have happened. No matter how good a film may be, I can not get into it when there is a huge and obvious plot hole. The film wasn't terrible, but it could have been so much better if they had just eliminated the obvious! Scott Glenn stars as a CIA hitman, who after executing his target, kills a potential witness, someone he shouldn't have killed. Following orders, his team leaves him stranded in the small Mexican city of Puerto Vallarta. The hitman needs to get back to the states and decides to pays a couple to take him on a ride to the boarder, never informing them that the Mexican authorities, as well as the CIA, are chasing him. What doesn't make sense to me, is if this guy is such a big time hitman, and he's on the run, why not just steal the car? It really wasn't necessary to drag this couple into it, when all they did was slow him down. This could have been a terrific action thriller, instead it was full of this non-sense, involving this random couple. Scott Glenn stars, and he's one of these guys whose name you don't recognized, but who has had minor roles in huge films for decades. Even I didn't realize until I looked him, but Glenn was in The Silence of The Lambs and The Hunt For Red October. He was very good, but the problem was that it wasn't believable. He wasn't injured, he didn't know these people, and there was no reason for him to take them along. They hindered his getaway and just destroyed the story. Also worth noting is that this was the last film to feature teen heartthrob, Jonathan Brandis, who killed himself in 2003. I've always liked Brandis, as he had a major role in one of my favorite TV shows, Seaquest DSV. He didn't get much work as an adult, which is considered to be one of the major reasons behind his suicide, but it was interesting to see one of his few adult roles. He didn't play a very interesting character, but only ever knowing him as a teen, I really wanted to see what he had become before the tragedy. Puerto Villarta Squeeze had a great back story, but it wasn't the focus of the film. The hitman's interaction with this bizarre couple was, and it just ruined the whole thing.",1408233600,,2245,4.347619047619047
