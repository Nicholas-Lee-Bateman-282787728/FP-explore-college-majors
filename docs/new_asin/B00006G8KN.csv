1754630,4,B00006G8KN,"This is a really good wrestling event, but it is only 1 hour? Why in the blue hell would they put a really 3 hour event it to 1 hour it is dumb. But anyway the event it self is pretty good. The fist match is Rock Superstar"" Kaos vs. Angel and Chris Hamrick(XPW TV-Title Gauntlet Match). It is not a bad match pretty good opening match. The second match Webb vs. GQ Money
(XPW World Title Match) this is really dumb, they cut the match right in the middle of it and you wonder who in the hell won. If you are going to put a match on a tape please put the hole match. The third match is Supreme vs. The Sandman (XPW King of the Deathmatch) now this is an XPW match. This match is F'n great there a weapons, barbed wire, thumbtacks, any thing that you can think of is in this match. One of the best matches on this hole tape. The fourth match is Veronica Caine vs. Lizzy Borden (Buck Naked Match). This is the most dumbes match I have ever seen in my years of watching wrestling. The light go out right when one of the ladys are all most naked it sucks. The this is one of the best moment on the video it is a 20 second scene that has these two hot girls NAKED yes NAKED it rulz they are very hot I'll tell you that much. The last match New Jack vs. Vic Grimes (40-Foot Scaffold Match) this is the best match on the tape it is so cool when the loser goes flying off the scaffold(I won't tell you who wins). That is it 5 match that are all pretty good, But like I said before 1 hour is never enough. For a new wrestling federation that is out there it is not that bad. Maybe in about 2-3 years they might be that new ECW but not right now.",1052092800,2,1635,3.927710843373494
1754631,2,B00006G8KN,"I have 2 other terrible XPW DVDs, ""Baptised In Blood"" and ""Damage Inc."" now those DVDs have no promise or anything good. This DVD I could compare to one of ECW's worst shows. But that is a [heck] of a step up from being pure garbage. Now I am sure they are even better with The Franchise running the show.
Let's get one thing straight first, this is not the full show. It's a compilation of matches from the show. I have one by complaint, they show The World Title match (2nd match of the DVD) in full - a very poor match - but they don't show the best match and 1st of the show in full and that being Kaos' TV title gauntlet. I think Nosawa was supposed to be in the match but he wasn't shown. Infact, GQ Money vs. Kaos was clipped largely and some of the Hamrick match was, as well.
The Sandman vs. Supreme - WHAT A LETDOWN! Sandman refused to use any weapons (Ok... What else can he do?!).
The Buck Naked match was pretty decent but was a HUGE letdown... For the live audience. In this DVD they have a 20 second music video of Veronica Caine and Lizzy Borden completely nude. I promise you, eventhough XPWrestling.com said that they did show nudity before the lights went out, that was false. You couldn't see anything.
The Scaffold match was pretty good but nothing spectacular and actually pretty boring until the fall.
If you are an XPW fan buy it. If you are a hardcore ECW fan, I would save up your money and buy the new and full shows (ie Hostile Takeover, Exit Sandman, Merry F'N X'Mas, etc.) on their official website.
As for the extras, you get a Sandman promo, Supreme Promo and Psicosis vs. Evan Karagious - Good match! The last extra being Scott Snot vs. Vinnie Masaro - Not so good.",1040083200,3,1698,4.27639751552795
1754632,4,B00006G8KN,"Well of corse xpw with never be as good ECW in its glory days
at the moment anyway, but give this fedration a chance its just
finding its feet. Give it some time for its characters to
develope and storylines to flow and this company will be a
force to reckon with. The camra work is a bit shoddy at times
but anyone who was a die hard ECW fan remembers how shoddy ECW'S
camra work was in the early days. This is one of XPW's best
PPV's yet. Grimes takes a 40 foot drop of a scaffold though loads and loads of tables,
witch rivals mick foleys bump off the famous
hell in a cell match if not more xtreme. A Must buy for any Hardcore wrestling fan.

7968443,2,B00006G8KN,"This DVD is noteworthy for one thing only....the infamous Scaffold Match between New Jack and Vic Grimes, where Jack almost legitimately killed Grimes by overthrowing off a 40 foot scaffold. That bump itself is worth watching. The rest, not so much. Well, the nudity is worth a look but the rest of the matches are totally forgettable.",1394236800,,335,4.894736842105263
7968444,2,B00006G8KN,"It's a shame when people have enough money to put on a wrestling show and all they could come up with is this garbage. I will say this, that fall from Vic Grimes was amazing! It was even more amazing that he survived that and continued to wrestle. New Jack is definately a sick MF'er, but Vic Grimes deserves major props for this as far as being hardcore. Other than that and the little part that showed Veronica Caine and Lizzy Borden (who were pornstars at that time) naked, the rest of the show was horrible! I still haven't figured out why they would book a match between Webb and GQ Money for their World Title! My 4 year son would beat the sh@t out of GQ Money easy. It's tragic that the world title of that  wrestling organization has no clout anywhere. You know you have a horrible show when the crowd boos and yells ""boring"" the whole show. I think I have made my point.",1202860800,,879,4.263473053892215
7968445,1,B00006G8KN,"There is little redeeming features in XPW Freefall, the modern epitome of garbage wrestling, and everything ECW's critics claimed ECW to be.

The shameful part is that some of the very few matches on this 60 minute release are actually good.  The reason this DVD gets 1 star is that because it is 60 minutes, huge pieces of the match are cut out---suddenly cutting to a different part of the match later on with only the ""XPW FREEFALL"" logo to let us know of the scene shift.

Aside from the Gauntlet match between Kaos and two other nobodies I never bothered to remember, the matches are pure garbage wrestling, without any sort of technical or athletic wrestling, and just a hardcore brawling with weapons style.

What kills the entire DVD, however, are the commentators.  If it weren't for them, I might have been generous in giving this two stars or even THREE!  The play-by-play commentator makes Michael Cole look like Joey Styles or Gorilla Monsoon.  During the Buck Naked Match, he starts randomly blobbling, acting like he's choking on his tongue and making gibbering noises for no reason.

The color commentator is even worse.  It's some idiot imitating a hispanic person, named ""Chico"" who is so called because EVERY SINGLE SENTENCE OUT OF THE IDIOT'S MOUTH BEGINS, CONTAINS, OR ENDS WITH THE WORD ""CHICO""!  Which in Spanish means ""boy"".  There's a very small percentage of statements coming out of the idiot's mouth that don't have ""Chico"" in them, and he provides nothing useful to any of the matches except to irritate the viewer into madness.  During the Buck Naked match, he starts making groaning noises like he's masturbating!

Two of the high spots on this dismally short DVD are absolutely ruined by the idiocy of the play-by-play commentator, who literally squeals like a little girl when the high spot occurs.  The only sound you hear when The Sandman is dropped on a bed of thumbtacks is the girlish squeal of that commentator, totally ruining the spot, as well as Vic Grimes' fall from the scaffolding.

Also, they screw the audience over in the Buck Naked match, as no one gets naked.  The DVD viewers, however, are shown random videos of the girls topless in apparent photoshoots.  Unfortunately, the primary woman, Veronica Caine, in the nude shoots looks like she's pushing 50 soon.

All in all, this was a disgustingly pathetic home video release, all about garbage wrestling, as two of the matches are cut to pieces to fit the 60 minute run-time, and the rest of them just plain sucked.  XPW IS NO ECW.",1189728000,,2532,4.792626728110599
7968446,4,B00006G8KN,"This DVD really nothing special until you see the 40 foot scaffolding match.

Did noone ever tell Rob Black about ""wrestling feet""?  This appears possible that this was a legitimate 40 feet in the air.  He should have promoted it of being at least 60 or 70 [wrestling] feet as tall as it was.

If memory serves correct, below was 12 tables, 6 layers of 2 tables each layer, to be thrown onto.

One of the opponents was New Jack.  I am not a fan of New Jack.  He is a violent wrestler (which is a positive) but he is one of the selfish wrestlers (he dishes out bumps instead of taking them).

The other oppenent was Vicious Vic Grimes.  He was the one to take the fall, or should I say the ""Freefall"".

As most probably know, wrestling matches are not correographed ahead of time.  The storylines are scripted but matches usually have only an outline at most, if they even have that.

Well, obviously they are not going to practice a fall like this.

This one I would have to say did not go as planned.  New Jack is the one to throw Grimes from the scaffolding.  However most likely Grimes fault in my opinion.  But possibly New Jack was supposed to guide the direction of his ""throw"" of Grimes.  Which if it is true, I especially would hold against New Jack as he is pretty lopsided in how much abuse he is willing to give as opposed to take.

Obviously Grimes was supposed to fall into the center of the tables.  Instead he hits the corners busting out the corners as he goes down.  Tables all the way at the highest levels remain without falling or being molested in any way.

Grimes who is a very big man has a lot less resistence than intended going down and he lands on the rope rings which bounce him pretty high back up into the air.

Reportedly he survived ok which is pretty amazing.

It is quite a spectacle to view and is the payoff on an otherwise average XPW dvd.",1126828800,,1876,4.267045454545454
7968447,2,B00006G8KN,"Thank god this company shut down. The only reason i bought this DVD was for the scaffold match between New Jack and Vic Grimes since I am a very big fan of Jack whom i've met and is a very interesting person to talk to but the match itself sucked in my opinion the second reason was the buck naked match in which the lights go off when the girls get stripped down but they do atleast try to make up for it with doing a sort of striptease with the two ladies afterwards(available only on the dvd or video) but that in itself is only worth watching once and its pretty dull after. Dont waste your time on this, and ECW DVD would be a much better buy.",1116374400,2,648,4.0310077519379846
7968448,2,B00006G8KN,"I received this DVD for free and I am glad I did. I no longer watch wrestling but I decided to check this out, since it boasted hardcore violence and fine azz b***hes. The production is terrible and the commentators really pissed me off. The most disappointing match was the Buck Naked Match. It went on for about five minutes and when one of the broads finally got ""naked"" the lights went out. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT FOR?! But, after that stupid match there is a little 30 second bit where Lizzy Borden and Veronica Caine appear naked, which calmed me down a bit. The Deathmatch was okay with a little bit of hardcore violence. The main event was a 40 foot scaffold match with New Jack and Vic Grimes. It was disappointing for the most part and lasted only five minutes. But it had one of the best moments on the DVD, when New Jack threw Vic Grimes off the 40 ft. scaffold through 4 tables stacked on top of each other. It was one of the most crazy things I've seen in wrestling. But for the mostpart, this shxt sucks. And it is too short, only 60 minutes. Save your money and buy something else.",1104105600,,1097,4.278846153846154
7968449,1,B00006G8KN,"XPW is no ECW. They had no fan support.
Hardly anyone showed up to see this show with New Jack going against Vic Grimes in a scaffold match. The scaffold is very high and the match is very bad. New Jack loves stabbing Grimes with the fork, and I have doubts the stun gun brought into the match was the slightest bit real. The scaffold is high but there are tables stacked upon tables in the ring so it's not that big of a fall.
The commentary is terrible. Most of the matches are terrible. If you like hardcore violence you might enjoy the deathmatch. The ring is very poorly lit and the picture quality is pathetic.
Don't be fooled by the buck naked match. It's just a big tease with the lights going out before anything is actually visible.
I'm glad this company has been shut down because they produced a very poor wrestling product.",1086134400,3,836,4.365384615384615
7968450,2,B00006G8KN,"While slightly better than the last XPW release I picked up (the God-awful Hardcore Conception), this one really isn't much better. There are much better matches but the quality of the presentation is still terrible.
The broadcasters are just annoying. You get a play-by-play man who makes Eric Bischoff's old commentating days seem like John Madden brodcasts and a terrible color man doing an awful Cheech Marin impression. This is the worst commentary I have ever heard. The attempts at humor are just so terrible. Any fan of wrestling could probably do a much better job here.
The only real rewarding moment is a grudge match between New Jack and Vic Grimes in a scaffold match. The advertised Buck Naked Match is a letdown though you do get a video afterward where both women appear nude.
This DVD is pretty bad. The matches are okay but I cannot warn you enough how amateur the quality is and how completely annoying the commentators are. You will honestly probably get a headache listening to them.",1061769600,2,1004,4.809248554913295
