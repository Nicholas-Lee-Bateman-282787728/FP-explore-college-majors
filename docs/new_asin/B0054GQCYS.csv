I played the DVD last night and around 25 minutes into the interview, it starts to pause and the picture and sound gets pixelated. . Takes away from the overall film. Otherwise the interview takes a close up and personal look at a true gentleman and wrestling legend.",1447891200,,358,4.507692307692308

First off, true awa fans will know most of what Nick went over. 40plus yr fans can pass,younger fans will love the info. Perhaps the greatest pro wrestler I have had the pleasure to watch,both live and televised. Nick quite simply could deliver the goods ,a real moneymaker. So few today,can create the story on every level,then follow it thru to its logical conclusion. Buddy Rogers in the 50s another. Need info on Nick,see Mick Karch. Thanks for the memories from a true 9 to 5,humaniod,ham and egger .God Bless Bob",1412380800,,532,4.731182795698925
