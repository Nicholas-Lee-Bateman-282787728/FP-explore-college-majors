7948357,1,B00005O5B0,"I normally would not write a review, but I am ashamed to say that I lost two hours of my life to this obscenely horrible movie. I would have had a better time if I had stabbed myself in the eye five times and tried to bandage it with a soldering iron. If you are looking for a reason to kill yourself, Sonic Impact is the movie for you. Not only was there no Sonic Impact, there was no impact at all. Terrible plot and horrible character development, add to a low budget thriller that I would use to punish my children if they were to pee on the kitchen floor. Ice T was by far the best actor in this movie. If that doesn't give you an impression of its quality, then you probably can't read or write. If you enjoyed Chill Factor, Dante's Peak, or Canadian suspense movies... this movie is for you. I am dumber from seeing this movie. May god have mercy on my soul.",1020038400,7,865,4.124260355029586
7948358,4,B00005O5B0,I first saw this movie when i was in Dubi in a movie theater and when i saw the movie poster i was surprised because i have never heard of this movie.  It is a direct to video release for the U.S.  After the credits rolled through thats when i realized this is not going to be a big budget movie.  Overall it was a really good movie. I reccomend it for people looking for a date movie to rent.,971568000,6,393,3.8875
