8018058,5,1575608863,"This is for advanced guitar players.  It would have been better if there is another song selected instead of The Crush of Love.  I still rate it 5 stars, though.  Danny Gill is awesome.",1448409600,,185,4.382352941176471
8018059,4,1575608863,One of the best guitar lessons ever. Could improve with the addition of a book or booklet.,1428624000,,90,4.352941176470588
8018060,4,1575608863,"I gave this to my BF as a gift.  He can play the guitar but is a novice.  I personally was pretty shocked at how high level this was.  The instructor goes pretty fast, but there are pauses where you can rewind and go back, which I think the person who doesn't play all the time would have to do.  If you can play guitar and want to be able to play like Satriani, I think this would be helpful. If you are learning to play the guitar, don't purchase this as I believe you will be frustrated. One other thing, Joe is not the instructor; I was a little disappointed with that, but the guy who does the video is very good.",1289520000,,618,4.0
8018061,4,1575608863,"If you're a beginner on guitar; move on. Sorry, but keep practicing.

If you are somewhat into guitar, and versed with open chords, with their M7's and sus, and you know a scale or two, maybe tried your hand at some pentatonic scales; this disc is still not for you. Yet.

This is for guitar players that know their instrument, and know music. You need to know legato, bends, and tremolo. If you don't, this disc is not going to teach it to you. If you are familiar with it and tried some licks that way, this disc then becomes a gold mine.

No tabs or short cuts as such, though the screen does offer you the dual view of strum hand and fret hand. The breakdowns are accurate and helpful, but fast and using music terminology. There is no practice time - just demonstrations and a break down of the details, then onwards to the next part. Pace is fast and to the point.

If you do not know music theory, you'll struggle to understand what is going on. If you do not (yet) know the full neck of the guitar and all notes on it, you're going to struggle moving around as well. More so if you lack the dexterity. There is one overview lesson that 'prepares' you for common techniques used by Joe, but that is only to underscore that you need to be an accomplished guitar player before getting ear deep into these teachings.

If you are, and dive into these breakdowns of the songs, you'll be given a great exposure/insight into the genius that is Joe Satriani.",1277683200,2,1457,4.341911764705882
8018062,5,1575608863,"Great DVD. Really breaks down Joe's techniques and songs into managable, learnable sections. Highly recommended!",1211846400,,112,6.533333333333333
8018063,4,1575608863,"These instructional DVDS with Danny Gill pretty much accomplish what they set out to do: teach you to play 6 of Joe's songs note-for-note. It does so in the popular format of showing you both left and right hands in picture to picture format. There is no on-screen or printed tab included, but Gill breaks it down into enough detail that tab is probably unnecessary.

Gill does take a bit of liberty with a lick or two here and there, adding a bit of personal touch, but it all still sounds very close and true to the originals.

However, I was a bit perplexed by a couple song choices for this instructional. When I think Joe Satriani, ""The Crush of Love"" isn't usually the first song of his to leap into my mind. I guess I would have appreciated a ""Flying in a Blue Dream"" lesson or ""Circles"" a bit more. Something a bit more classic. Also, the inclusion of ""Midnight"" seems kind of like a novelty, but I'm sure it is very hard to find a good transcription of this song out there. I'm not a huge tapping kind of guy, but I'm sure many other fans will appreciate its presence.

Also, Gill attempts to throw in a little theory here in there by explaining what mode certain runs are in(""This run is in A Dorian!""), and so forth. I don't really feel like these brushes with theory adds a whole lot, since it is all visual with no notation or any elaboration. If you want theory, get a book on theory.

All very minor quibbles, though. As stated earlier, if you want to learn some of Joe's most popular songs, this is a very good resource and I highly recommend it.",1174521600,12,1562,4.320819112627986
8018064,5,1575608863,This is a great instructional DVD to learning some of Satch's most popular songs.  It takes you through lick by lick breaking down each song and piecing it together for you.  Great for any fan.,1143158400,5,193,4.485714285714286
