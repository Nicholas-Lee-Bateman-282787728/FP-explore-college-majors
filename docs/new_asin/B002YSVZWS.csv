8384393,3,B002YSVZWS,"Primordial is a Pagan Black Metal band from Ireland. This is their first official dvd. The performances are fantastic and inspired but the filming, edition,authoring and sound of this 2XDVD are very poor, leaving one with the desire for a better future release.

DVD 1 is a full concert in Dublin at a small venue. The performance is fantastic but the filming is made with very few cameras, very dark and grainy and exhibits nauseatingly rapid-fire edition that doesn't allow one to appreciate any detail at all. The VBR picture is much lower than it could have been; being a double-layer disc they could have authored this 95' performance at a much higher ratio but it only takes up 5 Gb; what a waste !!

Audio is 2.0 AC3 dolby digital, it's muddy and the guitars cannot be properly heard when playing their trademark no-distortion clean celtic riffing and they only come to life when the distortion/volume pedals are engaged. The bottom end is so boomy it pretty much buries anything else. I had to substract bass from the amp in order to prevent it from clipping and splitting my sub in two. Overall volume is also one of the lowest I've ever experienced, and I have over 700 concert DVDs.

Disc 2 has a documentary on the band but it turns to be made up of ramdom interviews and road footage, maybe only interesting for extreme fans of the band. There are also some 90' of bonus live footage at different euro fests, which not only have band sound and pic but exhibit serious compression artifacts. The Ragnarok part is 16:9 boxed within 4:3 black bars, and the disc will prevent the player from correcting it !

GREAT band, GREAT performances, HORRENDOUS DVD. Get it from a bargain bin or borrow it from somewhere else.",1321833600,3,1725,4.627450980392157
8384394,5,B002YSVZWS,"Primordial is in my humble opinion the best pagan black metal band in existence. Their last two albums ""To the Nameless Dead"" and ""The Gathering Wilderness"" are flawless in all respects. Forget U2 because this Irish band plays with passion. What strikes me most about this band is Alan Nemtheanga's amazing vocals. You can hear the emotion exuding from his voice like some prophet lamenting for a bygone  golden age. Whenever I see him sing with his painted visage, I think of Colonel Kurtz from ""Apocalypse Now"". ""The horror, the horror"". Their sound is very organic. If you like Opeth's ""Deliverance"", Negura Bunget's ""Maiestrit"" and ""Om"", then I highly recommend this dvd.",1276387200,3,675,5.026785714285714
