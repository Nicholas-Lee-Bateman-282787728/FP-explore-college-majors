8659154,3,B00KI30X06,"Alejandro Fern&aacute;ndez Almendras both wrote an directed this Chilean film that promises more than it delivers. Despite a fine premise the power of the film is diluted by a conclusion that seems to sell it out.

Jorge Daniel Candia in an impressive role) is a tranquil, middle-class family man whose neighborhood has become overrun by a fringe class of street thugs. His comparatively fortunate existence makes him the target of their intimidation one night, and hulking outlaw Kalule (Daniel Antivilo) robs him of his insulin needle. Jorge's teenage son (Ariel Mateluna) boldly tries to stand up for his father, which only serves to unleash the bully's terrorizing reign of threats upon the family. Kalule is jailed for a brief time for assault and when he is released the concept of revenge overpowers the story. Jorge and his wife, Marta (Alejandra Ya&ntilde;ez), seek protection from the legal system but are subjected to civic drones and bureaucratic procedure, so they remain vulnerable. As Jorge's family suffers from fear and humiliating anguish, the situation paints him as a deficient patriarch-until he's cornered into defending what's his.

The pace of the film remains brisk despite some lapses in credibility. This is a fine mood piece but stops short of convincing character development. Grady Harp, December 14",1419465600,,1329,5.264150943396227
8659155,4,B00KI30X06,"Jorge is a quiet unassuming family man who works for the local forestry board. The area where he lives is starting to be over run with criminal, sorts. Then one night on his way home - he is abused and robbed. His son is enraged by his father's treatment and goes to sort it out. Sadly this leads to an escalation of violence.

The story soon moves on a number of years and what we get is a build up in the intimidation. His wife and daughter seek answers through the police and courts and they are all but useless to help the family. Faced with the inevitable Jorge has to decide whether to defend what is his or lose everything he holds dear.

This is a simple plot and will inevitably draw comparisons to Michael Winner's classic `Death wish'. This though is a completely different film and the causes are more varied too. This is also not an action fest  where the violence is the star; this is a thoughtful and paced study of one mans despair.

It is a very well made film with simple yet effective direction. The cinematography looks minimal in places but that adds to the starkness of the film and the realism by giving it a sort of voyeur quality. In Spanish and running for around 82 minutes this is an unusual but compelling film that I can easily recommend.",1417651200,,1268,4.360169491525424
8659156,4,B00KI30X06,"Partially based on actual events, To Kill a Man (2014) is concerned with how a man somewhere in Chile, deals with a threat to his family's safety.  The story has quite a few gaps that aren't really filled in very well, but when the focus narrows at crucial moments, the film has a high level tension, along with a sense of uncertainly.

One night, Jorge Contreras (Daniel Candia) a forestry worker, is robbed by a group of thugs led by Kalule (Daniel  Antivilo).  When Jorge's son Jorgito (Ariel Mateluna) attempts to get back what was stolen, he is assaulted by Alamos.  The culprit does a short stint in jail, but when he gets out, Alamos begins to harass Jorge and his family.  After Jorge's daughter Nicole (Jennifer Salas) is attacked, and the justice system fails him, Jorge takes action to eliminate the threat, once and for all.

Although this Film Movement presentation doesn't quite follow the events it is supposedly based on, To Kill a Man has a certain sense of realism and uncertainty that holds your interest.  There are moments that are bristling with tension, as you aren't quite sure how things will play out.  Some elements are a bit strange, like Jorge's occupation and family situation, a refrigerated truck, returning to the scene of the crime, a poor attempt at destroying the evidence, and there never seeming to be any witnesses to any wrongdoing.

A copy was provided for review, and my rating is 3.5 stars.  With a runtime of 82 minutes, To Kill a Man moves at a good pace, and although the story appears to have some gaps, the film is carried by a strong performance from Daniel Candia, earning points for its sense of atmosphere, and some aspects that seem grounded in reality.",1416700800,,1706,4.691275167785235
8659157,4,B00KI30X06,"""To Kill A Man"" (2014 release from Chile; 82 min.) brings the story of a family somewhere in Chile who are the victims of pestering, and eventually much worse, by the neighborhood thugs. After an initial shooting incident, the main thug is sentenced to 1 1/2 years in jail. The movie then jumps forward two years, and the thug and his cronies decide to extract revenge on the family. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience of this plot-heavy movie, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: ""To Kill A Man"" immediately recalls the theme from ""Death Wish"", yes, the Charles Bronson 1970s vigilante movie(s) where Bronson takes justice in his own hands. ""To Kill A Man' is essentially the same, but brought and done in a completely different fashion of course. Indeed, writer-director Alejandro Fernndez Almendras is NOT making a vigilante/action movie, he is instead bringing a psychological study on what it means to kill a man. It doesn't surprise then that the last 20-25 min. of the movie become more and more surreal, as if in a dream. Check out the excellent interview with the director in the DVD bonus materials, in which the director gives great insights on the movie, including that he ""composed the movie like paintings"". So true. Check out several key scenes in the second half of the movie, each lasting several minutes, that are filmed from a single angle. The camera just observes and lets us take it all in. I love it. I should also mention that the tension rarely lets up in the movie, and that at just over 80 min., this went by in a flash. Last but not least, the acting performances are great, most of all from Daniel Candia as our main guy Jorge. I admit that I had not heard of him (or any other performers) before this movie.

This movie was the August, 2014 release in the on-going series of Film Movement's DVD-of-the-Month Club of foreign and indie movies, and the DVD will be released to the public at large in December (but I wouldn't be surprised if ""To Kill A Man"" shows up on Amazon Instant Video before then). As is customary, there is a bonus 'shortie' and this time we get ""Our Blood"" (2014 from the US; 26 min.), a bizarre if not creepy movie about a brother and sister meeting each other after a long time (maybe first time ever) in bison country and feeling attracted to each other. Will they give in to their urges? This shortie was not particularly to my liking, to be honest, and I wouldn't recommend watching this.

Back to the main feature: if you are in the mood for something entirely different than the comic book action hero movie of the week that Hollywood keeps serving up endlessly this summer, you cannot go wrong with this. ""To Kill A Man"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1407974400,,2764,4.568548387096774
8659158,5,B00KI30X06,"Under its stark surface the film is fueled with power! The kind man, with no one to protect him and his family from the devil, is forced to become the devil himself. A lot of movies touches upon this topic, but none represents the change of a good man in such powerful way. Like in the unforgettable murder scene of the village hooligan, this movie restrains the dramatization of vengeance, using an extreme long take and distancing the camera from the action. The movie is skillfully plotted so that a lot of subplots submerge only when you watch carefully. Definitely worth seeing if you're an arthouse fan!",1405468800,,609,4.700934579439252
