8044513,5,B00073J2EK,"I was a Cav pilot with the 101st Airborne Division in RVN in 1971.  I remember the ""donut dollies"" and the entertainers who came to our O-Clubs to entertain us. I met the writer/producer/director of this video in 2005, right after she produced it, and just fell in love with the film.  If you were in 'Nam during the war and were blessed by any of the civilian entertainers who came to 'Nam to entertain us, this film will bless your heart. I have owned the film since it was made and watch it often. Every time I see it I am reduced to a weeping mess.  Trust this old RLO; this film is a ""must own"" if you are a 'Nam vet!",1402876800,,622,4.040650406504065
8044514,3,B00073J2EK,I really expected more music.  It WAS interesting and I did enjoy the music that was there.  Brought back a lot of memories---good and bad.,1371772800,,139,4.52
8044515,5,B00073J2EK,"I was an infantry soldier with the Australian 9th Battalion RAR in South Vietnam in 1968-69 and I relate to the era and the entertainers. Some I know personally and admire, one in particular who has done so much for the veteran community in South Australia and recently deservedly awarded with an Order of Australia Medal (OAM) in the 2013 Australia Day Awards for Services to Veterans. Her name, Pat (The Big Pretzel) Kennedy, two entertainment tours of Vietnam, who appears several times in the ""Entertaining Vietnam"" doco doing her famous ""titty tassel twirl"" and whom I am proud to call ""Sister Soldier"". Pat, for so many years has been the lynchpin and organiser of the Vietnam Veterans Day Concert in Adelaide, SA, annually on the Sunday closest to August 18, bringing remembrance, happiness and ENTERTAINMENT back to us all from the depths of those dark days. I commend Mara Wallis for producing this doco and sharing her experiences along with her other ""mates"" who risked and gave their lives for us. You are the real ""Sapphires"". Thank you. John England, C Company, 9 RAR, SVN 1968-69.",1364947200,3,1095,4.86096256684492

8044517,5,B00073J2EK,"a truly terrific documentary done with a bleeding heart, highlighting a sideshow of the Viet Nam war and bringing true gems of home movies as well as filmed records of shows",1238544000,2,173,4.612903225806452
8044518,5,B00073J2EK,"Entertaining Vietnam. A really terrific documentary. I see lots of documentaries and this is as good as most and better than most. And, it is such a compelling subject, things/issues I never thought about. There are stories within the video that are adventures themselves. For instance, I felt really bad about one of the entertainers who was killed by friendly fire. You must watch the interview to ""get it."" The interview of one of the band members who witnessed the event, was mesmerising. Basically, a soldier who had gone ""over the top"" and, meant to kill another soldier, missed and killed the entertainer. What a story! Sad.

This documentary deserves wide coverage. Vietnam vets will love it. I personally would buy it just for the music. So much more, however. It should have a wide audience. Also, I felt badly that the entertainers did not get more support from the military. This is awful. Apparently the entertainers don't feel this way but I do. Some commander should have been making sure these valuable military assets were protected, transported and anything else needed. We let them down. It is obvious to me that the entertainers' commitment to the troops in bringing them a portion of home deserves recognition. And, this documentary gives well deserved and long overdue recognition to them. For this, I say, HooAhhhhhhhh!!

I love the way the film maker has put the video together, right to the point of the running credits. A great job. And, thanks more than I can possibly convey for bringing a portion of home to the Vietnam warrior and also for putting together this wonderful documentary.

We are now in a war that is Vietnam revisited. It is Iraqnam. Caring Americans need to see Entertaining Vietnam to understand the psyche of how history repeats itself. In addition to personal viewing, Entertaining Vietnam would make a great addition to a college course and I'm personally buying an additional copy for a college Prof. friend. I hope others will do the same.",1174348800,7,1990,4.899109792284866
8044519,5,B00073J2EK,"I was with the USO the summer of 1967 in Japan, Korea, Iwo Jima, Taiwan, Okinawa, Guam, and the Philipines as a college student.  Watching this film left me stunned.  I had forgotten what an impact that tour had made on my life.  This film brought it all home.  Here I am, in my 60's, looking at the interviews of the performers and flash backs to their shows.  The soldiers, the faces, the heat, the costumes, the rivers, the planes, the danger, the longings, the tireless showmanship, the energy, the sadness....Thank you Mara Wallis for preserving this piece of American history.",1173916800,4,582,4.7227722772277225

8044521,5,B00073J2EK,"This is a slice of history never before explored.  We've all heard about the USO, but not about the countless young women and men who entertained the troops in Vietnam independently.  Great investigative work with several major scoops, and on top of it all, it's entertaining!",1110067200,7,276,4.978260869565218
8044522,5,B00073J2EK,"I was surprised by this film. Really moves along and is gripping in parts. Its a look at the war that I've never seen before. Forget Bob Hope, these guys really saw some action in the war!",1109980800,7,188,4.108108108108108
