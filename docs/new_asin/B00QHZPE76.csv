6870767,1,B00QHZPE76,"I have never given anything a one star before. And I am not going to write a long review. There is nothing to review. The premise of this movie was a good one. The acting is so bad, I actually could not stop laughing. I know people in my family who could do a better job of acting in this. They do have the one notable actor, Rutger Hauer.  But you don't see much of him during the film.

Everything about this is just so bad. In fact, instead of me telling you don't waste your money, I say watch it. When you do, come back in here, and tell me if you think I am wrong about the acting, and the writing. I think they must have had no time to do this correctly. The budget must have been about 100 dollars. Oh, and they throw these silly sex scenes that really have no place in there other then to have it in there. No problem for me, the girls are gorgeous. But nothing in this movie is any good at all. Boring, except the acting which is so bad, it's like watching a train wreck, you cant take your eyes off of it. Want a good movie to watch, that makes you think. Rent a movie called The Exam. It was an Independent film, IFC I think?  Try watching that. I think that was a fantastic movie and if you cant rent it here, try netflix. But if you do watch this really horrible movie, please come back here and tell me If you think I was wrong. Not once was I excited in this film. Except when the eye candy was on screen. Good thing they looked great, they sure could not act, and the men were worse. How people gave this movie a 5 star is beyond me. Everyone's taste is different I get it. But wow. This movie is just horrible. I wish I could give it negative numbers. The premise was good. That was it. Such a shame. If you google the movie you will know what it is about in more detail. I don't want to spoil anything, but honest, there is nothing to spoil. I mean nothing. I really hope people come back and talk to me  about this. That is the only reason I even wrote this. Just to see if people are looking at it the way I did. This movie and the acting is so bad. Just wow..",1423872000,5,2081,3.9594272076372317
6870768,5,B00QHZPE76,"I've always enjoyed Rutger Hauer's film work; he and the cast make R.P.G. an incredible experience! When ten older folks wake up in ten MUCH younger bodies and have no idea where they came from or where they are now, the thrill ride is just beginning.

A bit difficult to watch in a couple of spots (violence), but a terrific combination murder mystery/sci-fi flick, as you try to guess who is who and who ""dunnit.""",1421712000,3,415,4.533333333333333

8691399,1,B00QHZPE76,"Pro's: Some nice Costume Designs, the general idea is not bad. Some actors have a nice physical appearance.

Con's: About every mistake you expect to find in a low budget film. Poorly written story which tries to replace character with plot, weak dialogue which often says what you see. Lot of CGI which cannot compete with state of the art. A lot of unmotivated, annoying handheld, shaky camera, Actors stumbling over the english language, a likely unexperienced director who obviously did not know who his lead character was and whose story he wanted to tell or maybe it was simply low, low budget conditions. Set design cannot compete with high budget films,  it looks cheap by nature. Love creative filmmakers and support any indie, but this one is a waste of time and money. Iconic Rutger Hauer has only a few scenes and unfortunately cannot safe the film.",1449100800,,861,4.8108108108108105
8691400,2,B00QHZPE76,"Interesting concept and casting, however, I never felt truly connected to any particular character. A bit like watching a slide show, hooked initially and then ready for it all to end. Final plot twist? Nicely done.  Otherwise, mostly wasted potential.",1432944000,,252,5.3

8691404,5,B00QHZPE76,I can't say anything bad about a Rutger Hauer movie even when it deserves one.  The Man The Myth The Legend. I want more even if it's stuff like this.,1429401600,,150,4.0
