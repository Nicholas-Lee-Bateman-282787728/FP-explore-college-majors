8581464,5,B00CFYD53S,Ive been a Sublime fan since the mid-90's and never had the opportunity to see them before Bradley passed so this was a perfect dvd for me.,1466294400,,139,4.185185185185185
8581465,5,B00CFYD53S,"If this is not simply the greatest gift from god himself to you then you can't call yourself a true Sublime fan. Raw and uncut epicness (Bradley forgets lyrics ""439-0111 whatever"" ends up improvising with the most raw talent ever)... its like entering a time warp back to the golden days. If you're even remotely debating getting it... BUY IT! I assure you that you will not be dissapointed in the slighest.",1443744000,5,407,4.666666666666667

8581468,5,B00CFYD53S,"Well, either you like them or really like them. I really like them. It was and is a loss for us all. Take it for what it is. I never saw them live. Love their music. But, trust me, this video is worth owning! GREG P.S.-""Just take it for what it is! It will be even more special then.""",1405814400,2,284,3.830508474576271
8581469,5,B00CFYD53S,"Bought this shortly after it was released. This concert the band played many of their hit songs and they were performed well. Looks like the band was having a really good time playing their tunes in this small intimate venue. Wish i had been old enough to see these guys when Bradley was still alive. Got into this band a little too late, but this is the next best thing. Hope their record company releases more DVD's like this one because outside of the bootleg circut there isn't  much of this band on DVD available.",1402012800,,518,4.4526315789473685
8581470,4,B00CFYD53S,"Not their best concert, nor in their prime but live sublime is rare so I'd get it again.  The sound quality is pretty decent and the video not bad - and it is Sublime live !  The close-out song while the credits roll is a tear jerker (tribute to Bradley and Lou-dog)",1390089600,,266,4.096153846153846
8581471,3,B00CFYD53S,"I simply love his music !!! I will watch this DVD everytime I have a chance.  Gosh, I wish he could play live again...sighs...",1381968000,,126,4.25
