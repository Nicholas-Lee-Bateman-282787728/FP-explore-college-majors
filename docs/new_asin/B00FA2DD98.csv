I have purchased both DVD editions of this film and I will be reviewing them both: the $5 Alpha Home Video version with the original poster cover, and the $15 The Video Cellar version with the cover featuring Cecil B. DeMille
To begin, Alpha's version has a shorter running time than VC's (Video Cellar). Alpha's version is just over 1 hour and 36 minutes, while VC's version has a running time is 1 hour and 45 minutes. This is because several scenes (including the original introduction) in the beginning of the movie have been removed from from Alpha's version, and there are a couple scenes that appear to have a slightly faster speed.
Secondly, the Alpha version has a soundtrack, whereas VC's has none at all.
But here's the clincher - the Alpha version has a beautiful, clear picture quality whereas VC's version is pathetic quality, and not even full screen.
So, for me, the Alpha DVD version wins by far, even though VC's DVD version contains the complete movie. I promptly returned VC's DVD version.
Now, here's the interesting thing: The first time I watched The Road to Yesterday, I saw it online. It was uploaded online by The Video Cellar - it was the complete 1hour and 45 minute film, and the quality was actually very good. Also, it contained a soundtrack! (A different soundtrack than Alpha's, and in my opinion, the online movie has a better one which sounds more beautiful and original to me. Very odd it wasn't present on their DVD!)
So there you have the more-complicated-than-it-should-be breakdown of Alpha's DVD release, The Video Cellar's DVD release, and the online version of the movie uploaded by The Video Cellar. Whew. Why can't someone release a beautifully remastered, full length DVD version which features the lovely soundtrack?!? (By the way, You can watch the online version I mentioned on Dailymotion or on The Video Cellar's website)
Now to the film itself, I highly recommend you check out Fritzi Kramer's review of The Road to Yesterday on Movies Silently.com. Her breakdown gives you a better look at the movie, it's plot and development, as well as fun bits of behind-the-scenes information. For me, it epitomizes everything a DeMille production should be - incredibly epic, star studded, highly entertaining, and unforgettable. William Boyd absolutely sparkles here in his first leading role, which is undoubtedly the reason DeMille starred him solo in his next epic, The Volga Boatman. That movie became an instant classic, and contributed in turning the already popular William Boyd into a star and matinee idol....and later on, of course, his true calling of becoming Hopalong Cassidy.
To say the least, The Road to Yesterday is an epic classic and a must-see!",1472342400,,2770,4.9336188436830835

8613623,5,B00FA2DD98,"Eye-popping 1925 DeMille silent is certainly not dull. Reincarnation themes, witch-burnings and more are included in a print not nearly as bad as another reviewer suggests. Not bad soundtrack seems to be from a late '20s-early '30s sound reissue. One of the musical themes is cribbed from Joan Crawford's 1928 hit OUR DANCING DAUGHTERS!  The picture was quite watchable shown on an upscaling player on a 40-inch flatscreen.",1425168000,7,423,5.220588235294118
8613624,2,B00FA2DD98,"When it comes to silent films of the teens and 1920s, the difference between these two decades may be only a few years, but the movies themselves are a life time apart; the earlier decade is not only Victorian in story, but productions are more often than not pretty poor, everything from lighting, editing, sets, and all-together over-the-top acting that comes off comical, if not annoying and embarrassingly bad, and adding to the mix is the usual terrible condition of the film print, horrible transfer to video, one is best to avoid the silent films of the 1910s, only for the curiosity value they hold in the context of history, cinematic views of early 20th century New York City, other American major cities, and early American life and people caught on film; as entertainment, for the most part, they hold little to no value.  So has been my experience with these film relics, but the advances made in the aftermath of the first world war and into the 1920s is another matter all together.  Filming techniques improved an astonishing amount, with everything from production values, story writing, acting, directing, over-all quality in Hollywood movie making methods and studio system film making style made the difference like night and day.
Cecil B DeMille's movies of the early to mid '20s is a perfect example of just that; his productions may be over-the-top, to say the least, but his tales of flappers, the very wealthy, the moderns of the jazz age '20s, the morals of the day with it's indulgent characters drinking bath tub gin, dancing on speak easy table tops, and, in general, running amuck, are by far the most interesting, and entertaining, movies of the final few years of the silent films, and the era of random abandonment on the screen for many decades to come.  But, unfortunately, de Mille had many an overly moralistic view stuck in his film, usually thrown in at the end, the ""final pay off"" for all the fun that the characters had enjoyed throughout the first 90% of the story, often being sent back in time to biblical days of Sodom and ultimate destruction and complete ruin, or, at the very least, these amoral sinners were attacked and eaten by lions.  Such are the wages of sin, as De Mille saw it.
Now, to this film at hand, ""The Road to Yesterday"", a De Mille effort from the mid '20s, sub-par to the majority of his other films, and he had, in my view, a great many awful films to his credit, but this is one of the most truly dreadful on so many different levels it's hard to know just where to start.  The story, for one, is particularly dreadful, one of those mishmashes of different eras in history, a dress period piece that was so popular at the time, a favorite so often used in Valentino pictures one wonders how in the world the actor ever gained any popularity in pictures, his choice in film stories as dreadful as his unbelievably laughable lack of
acting talent. One would think a ""period dress piece"" would fare better in the hands of one of the strongest directors of this time, but that most certainly is not the case in ""The Road to Yesterday"", a completely horrid picture from start to finish.  Personally, I don't think any director in the history of film could make a decent film of this type, from any movie era, film taste styles and changes, I can't seem to come up with more than a few words to describe this movie; awful, dreadful, horrid, boring, unbearable, impossible to sit through unless tied to a chair or heavily over sedated with powerful narcotics.
My final review; awful, just awful.
PS
The terrible film transfer to video is equally terrible; like trying to watch a movie underwater with lard rugged all over your goggle mask.",1418774400,3,3701,4.660030627871363
