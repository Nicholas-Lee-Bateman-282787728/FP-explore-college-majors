4260166,2,B00447852K,"First off, let me say that these movies are great, and it is great to see them in hi-definition,  I gave it such a low rating because of the lousy packaging.

I was suckered in because you get two great movies in one package,  the problem is, you get ABSOLUTELY NO BONUS FEATURES WHATSOEVER!  Most multi-movie packages come with separate discs in a double case.  Not so with this one.

Strictly the movies, no audio-commentary,  no deleted scenes, you can't even access the scenes from the menu.  EPIC FAIL!

It's common knowledge that a blu-ray disc will hold a ton of information,  I feel that they could have done a lot better job than this.",1358208000,6,644,4.521739130434782
4260167,5,B00447852K,"Hilarious! Loved the movies, especially if you love the show. NOT FOR KIDS!! Bought it for my fiance and he's addicted. Probably going to start buying the shows seasons now.",1357516800,,173,4.8

4260180,5,B00447852K,"This is a very cheap price for a very great show/movie on bluray.

Trailer Park Boys is a TV Show out of Canada (best thing since Crown Royal) and is hilarious.  This is some cheap entertainment and in normal quality. The show was shot in a NON HD camera therefore the movie isn't full 1080p but it does have both movies on the same bluray which is very convenient especially when running out of slots on your dvd/bluray tower.

I would buy this in a heartbeat if I didn't have it. Also a great gift idea.",1392681600,,505,4.239583333333333

4260188,5,B00447852K,"TPB movie was alot of fun. Different from the TV shows documentary style but a Hollywood film should look like a film. I did not like the replacement Trin though. Countdown to liquor day looks more like the TV show and is also a good laugh. Would of liked more Sarah, Lucy and Trin, but still fun. Would have also liked some commentary but still worth the purchase price.",1359936000,,371,4.391304347826087

8415884,1,B00447852K,I cant say Ive ever seen two complete movies on one side of a DVD before. You can imagine how terrible the quality is by that information alone. There are no subtitles and no chapter menu either. Not recommended. Buy the movies individually instead.,1526342400,,249,4.681818181818182
