8609905,5,B0026I5FBS,Excellent video. I got my first survival kit from my grandfather when I was about 8 or 9. He served in the end of WW2 and beginning of korea and would show me how to use what was in the kit which was a small drawstring bag and take me fishing and point out stuff to me and scenarios.  Which led me to years of reading on the subject and this video took me right back to those good old days.  I recommend this to anyone who does anything in the woods it will save your life or like me at age 34 I'm still fascinated and learning more each day.,1416355200,,542,3.873873873873874
8609906,5,B0026I5FBS,In all of Ron Hoods videos regardless of your skill level outdoors you will learn something.  I own his entire dvd collection. Ron and Karen his wife put these videos together in a quality no others have been able to compete with.  They are the real deal. The videos are worth their weigh in gold information wise as well as quality and entertainment.,1377129600,,351,4.555555555555555
