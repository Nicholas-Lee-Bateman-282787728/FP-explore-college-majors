7039393,5,B00UGQQZSE,"Awesome quality DVD, and even better than I remember the original to be.  The director's cut is THE ONE to buy.  Beautiful Rachel is in all her glory.  Daryl Hannah also acts well, but Rachel's beauty really upstages everyone, including even Harrison.  WOW!  (P.S. Don't bother to see the new movie, as it truly is bad.",1512259200,3,319,4.625

7039395,5,B00UGQQZSE,Excellent movie!!! I watched the night before going to see Blade Runner 2049. It was like a seamless transition. Loved both movies.,1510704000,3,131,5.0

7039400,5,B00UGQQZSE,This is an absolute classic & must see & own. I totally love every scene in this movie and it's our favorite film noir/Sc-Fi Fantasy movie. Nothing really compare to this movie. I've seen it over & over since I was a kid when it came out and it's always just as good as ever. So very glad we got it .,1523232000,,300,3.8548387096774195

7039402,5,B00UGQQZSE,A great addition to my DVD library.,1523059200,,35,4.142857142857143
7039403,5,B00UGQQZSE,I had not seen this movie since it's original theatrical release. The story and the visual effects are definitely up to current movie standards. The video quality of this disc is excellent.,1522886400,,189,4.9375
7039404,5,B00UGQQZSE,"""Classic"" is an overused adjective when it comes to movies, but this one is
a classic science fiction yarn based on a Phillip K. Dick novel of a different name.
Ridley Scott did a masterful job directing this 1982 scifi thriller and Harrison Ford was
excellent as the burned-out police specialist tasked with eliminating the almost-human
androids who sneak back to Earth from colonized worlds in the galaxy.",1521763200,,407,5.0
7039405,3,B00UGQQZSE,"It was OK....just like the rest of the Blade Runner movies.....everything is filmed in the dark and has a so, so story line.",1521504000,,124,4.434782608695652
7039406,4,B00UGQQZSE,"Not much different from the original ""Blade Runner"".  A really good movie.",1519689600,,74,5.166666666666667
7039407,5,B00UGQQZSE,Great movie!,1518393600,,12,5.5
7039408,5,B00UGQQZSE,One of the greatest films ever made.  Blade Runner 2049 is among the best ever made too.,1517875200,,88,4.176470588235294
7039409,5,B00UGQQZSE,Do I really need to write a review about one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever?,1517875200,,76,3.8125
7039410,5,B00UGQQZSE,Good cult type movie It was enjoyable.,1517184000,,38,4.571428571428571
7039411,3,B00UGQQZSE,I guess I am old school. I much prefer the original theatrical version,1515628800,,70,4.461538461538462
7039412,3,B00UGQQZSE,"I never saw it before, and with all the hype I finally got around to seeing it.  The director's cut at least. It started out promising, even if it was slow.  The premise was quite interesting as well as the visuals- even if they have been copied many times since you can still appreciate them.  The climax though- that really didn't pay off for me.  There was a spoiler that I had heard, but if true, the movie was subtle enough to not actually openly state it.  I think it is worth seeing on the basis of admiring a movie that had a huge influence but I would keep expectations low.",1515456000,,583,4.216216216216216
7039413,3,B00UGQQZSE,"I saw this movie when it first came to theaters.  I thought it was boring then.  I own the ""final cut"" and I can't say it raised my opinion of the movie at all.",1514073600,,160,3.676470588235294

8706796,4,B00UGQQZSE,"Great movie from the early eighties, despite of the many version available out there, I did like this one, the final cut.",1532390400,,121,4.545454545454546
8706797,5,B00UGQQZSE,"DVD arrived on time (actually a day early) and in very good condition. The movie is amazing for 1980 - the color, the intelligent dialogue, the complex characters, and of course the action. The quality of the recording was exceptional.",1532131200,,235,4.9
8706798,5,B00UGQQZSE,"I watched this just before 2049 was in theaters and loved it. Loved 2049 as well. They both are a slow burn, and done phenomenally. Considering how ground breaking this was at the time, it shows how impressive it is. I think some bad reviews for these films stem from the instant gratification from films (not always a good thing) more people crave today than ever.",1531440000,,365,4.545454545454546
