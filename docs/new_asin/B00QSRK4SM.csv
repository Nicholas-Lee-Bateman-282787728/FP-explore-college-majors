8692724,5,B00QSRK4SM,"Watched this with my brony grandson (age 10) and never saw him smile more!  He is shy about being a brony but I hope this film will help him accept that being a little different is more than ok, it's great!",1484524800,,206,4.024390243902439

8692728,5,B00QSRK4SM,"While I rarely let 'convention' dictate what I like and don't like, I fought against liking MLP. I was a kid when the originals came out, so this was not only a reboot, but a silly, childish reboot, in my opinion. Then my daughter wanted to watch it and I was in the room. I got sucked in faster than I would have imagined. And despite knowing the term 'brony', I still felt kinda weird. So I enjoyed watching this proof that it really is a fun show with a (positive) cult adult following.",1476230400,2,489,4.212765957446808
8692729,5,B00QSRK4SM,"There are a lot of Brony documentaries out there, and this is quite possibly the best one I've seen! This is an honest film that does justice to the brony community. Props for using an actual brony meetup as the source material.

John de Lancie, take some notes from this one!",1418428800,2,276,4.411764705882353
