8297552,5,B001EBTO1U,"If you watched the war with Iraq on American TV, you learned little about the Iraqis. This set contains About Baghdad, Iraq in Fragments, Return to the Land of Wonders and Hidden Wars of Desert Storm. All four are excellent. The thing that impressed me was that the Iraqis interviewed were intelligent and looked like they could have come from New York, Chicago, Kansas City or San Francisco.
If you have forgotten the Iraq War, I recommend three documentaries on DVD about the chaos of the war by George W. Bush and his cronies: No End In Sight by Charles Ferguson, Taxi To The Dark Side by Alex Gibney and Bush's War from PBS Frontline.
Don't miss Hidden Wars of Desert Storm which explains that the US put depleted uranium in its weapons which killed thousands of coalition troops and many Iraqi babies. It seems that this was a secret that Bush withheld from the American public. Now we know.",1379721600,2,896,4.60625
8297553,4,B001EBTO1U,"Wasn't really sure what this was when I ordered, now I know. Two of the films were made by Iraqis who had left the country, and came back to talk to the ordinary citizens to find out about their feelings towards conditions in the Iraq. Everybody was happy about the US causing the fall of their regime, but did not like the occupation idea. One of these was interesting because the filmmaker's father was actually a diplomat who was asked to return to help form the new government. One other one dealt with the problems faced with forming the new government because there are three main groups there. The last was about the first Gulf war, and questioned whether the mission was to help Kuwait or did the government have other motives. They showed the results of the sanctions, and you could see why the people wanted a change of leadership. Bear in mind that these were made in the mid-2000's, so opinions may have changed as this progressed. I found them interesting to watch to see from a different prospective, than just what we see in the media or simply don't know.",1370304000,2,1071,4.55440414507772
