1063438,1,6305736359,"I wasn't expecting much when I rented it at the video store (thank god I didn't buy it), but what I saw was worse than anyone could imagine. Bad editing, bad acting, horrible dialogue (some of it added in after the movie  was filmed) and a plot that made absolutely no sense. It seems like they  were attempting to make an action/comedy, but it ended up as lots of  pointless action and some comedy that didn't fit in (just to kill some time  between fight scenes.)
Ernie Reyes Jr. and Sr. (as well as the West Coast  Demo Team) do know how to move, but the fight scenes were barely anything  more than finding an excuse for them to take turns showing off their big  spinning and jumping kicks or to spin some weapons around on camera. The  worst of all of the ""show off"" moves was a jump kick by Ernie  Reyes Sr.. He ran about 150 feet towards a guy (who knew he was coming and  was ready for him) before he was in range to kick and the guy didn't even  attempt to dodge it!
I would give this movie three stars as a horror  film.",954288000,,1030,4.1206030150753765
1063439,4,6305736359,"If you enjoy spectacular weaponry (short sticks), amazing kicks, and well choreographed fight scenes, this is the one!  Admittedly, the plot is a little strange, we could have done without the cross-dressing antagonist  ninny, and more development around the subplot of spirituality and the  foster home would have made this a stellar film, but hey, it's a martial  arts film.  Worth a viewing for the well-executed fight scenes.  Kimo (from  The Ultimate Fighting Championships) does a good job as the unstoppable  bodyguard.  Also interesting is the presentation of several different  styles of martial arts, including one from the Philippines.",952214400,,646,5.434343434343434
7893455,3,6305736359,"Normally i'd be massively peeved by people trashing The Ernies. I LOVE Surf Ninjas. However. this movie honestly made me cringe, it wasn't the movie. it was the script. Ernie suddenly turning into this fouth mouthed kid surprised me. i spent the entire movie entertaining myself with ""bleep"" over every curse and woke up with my laptop on replay on the beginning. I did watch it through without boring myself to sleep because I LOVE the Ernies and their school. Action was astounding. no wires there baby. but the rest of it not so much.

So yeah i want to give it a 5 star because i love the action and the Ernies. Then i want to give it 1 star because its HORRIBLE - i give it 3- Ernie is amazing at his martial arts they all are, and thats honestly WHY i bought it. I didn't expect it to be awesome, i knew ernie kicked butt so i bought it. it did what i wanted it to do, showed an amazing talent. but the fact that i cant watch it again because of the cursing and story being so bad keeps it from being a 5 star

if you LOVE action. watch this on mute. no subtitles. then it will a FIVE STAR movie. ONLY THEN",1435104000,,1112,4.0963302752293576
7893456,4,6305736359,"The Ultimate Fight...This is a fine movie.  With the original mandarin Chinese, is a delight to hear the native tongue than some other voice over.  Film quality to dvd transfer is okay, audio fine and action very good.  This is a modern fight love story with some humor, very good.

7893457,1,6305736359,"Movie contains a bunch of Filipinos and people whose lines contains the ""F"" word in every sentence. There was no story. Action sequences are awful.",1342742400,,147,4.92
7893458,2,6305736359,"This flick is so bad it's hilarious.  I think it's safe to say that the majority of the humor was intentional.  Ernie Reyes Jr. (""The Rundown"", ""Surf Ninjas"") directs and stars as Jesse, a member of a group of martial artists who are at war with a group of drug dealers.  Or something like that.  The special features contain a trivia game about the film.  Though I had little recollection of what I had just viewed, I got all dozen-or-so questions right!

Though the plot is essentially non-existent, I assume this was made as a showcase for the talented star, his father, and a couple of others.  Ernie Reyes Sr. has a great (and unexplained) fight with Shishir Inocalla in the dining room during mealtime.  Though most of the fights are ridiculous, they're still a lot better than many other B-films of the time.  Though the crazy flying kicks do go a bit overboard.  I'll also assume that Corin Nemec, who plays the flick's main bad guy, Hitler(?!?) owed someone a serious favor.

I have been a major fan of Ernie Reyes Jr. since I was a kid.  This movie is probably what keeps him from getting better roles.  He is not the greatest actor in the world but he's much better than a lot of the goons that pass for action stars these days and with much better moves as well.  He is incredibly fast, agile, and crazy ripped.  How many sit-ups does this cat do in a day?  I would love to see what he could do with a real script, director, and choreographer.  The trailer for his current film, ""Red Canvas"" looked pretty cool.

The DVD is full screened with decent picture quality.  It only has a few special features, including the trivia and optional Spanish subtitles.  I can't imagine that this would float a lot of people's boats, but not taken seriously it's silly and fun.  If you do like this type of thing act fast, as it's out of print.  2.5 stars.

1998.  aka:  The Process",1235865600,,1881,4.44574780058651
7893459,3,6305736359,"Ernie Reyes Jr. is amazing.  He is unbelievably athletic.  You may recall him from ""The Rundown"".  He was the guy in the jungle who fought the Rock and kicked his butt all over the place.  In The Ultimate Fight, what he makes up with in martial arts skill, he loses in making a good film.

What ruined this movie was it's lack of any real plot and an absolutely horrible lead villain.  The acting wasn't good either and most of the charcaters were just uninteresting.  I was kind of bored throughout as pacing seemed very draggy.  But the villain, seriously he was just about the craziest freak I had ever seen.  Everyone calls him Hitler, and he dresses like a homosexual Hitler and must have some mental issues or be on drugs.  It was frustrating watching his role.

There are 3 guys in this film that know how to put on a good show - Ernie Reyes Jr, his father (Ernie Reyes Sr.) and Shishir Inocalla.  When watching thse guys, you can tell they are real martial artists.  I just wish there had been some real plot to make their fights worth something more than just kind of showing off.  Kimo was the only villain in thie film I enjoyed, but he actually never impressed me too much.  The actor's name is also Kimo and he is a real life UFC legend.  I typically enjoy it when a good martial artist goes up against a UFC guy in these films.  Jet Li did it in Cradle 2 The Grave.  Tony Jaa did it in The Protector.  All 3 of the formentioned martial artists get their turn at the end of the film, but honestly, I was expecting more, especially out of Kimo.

The only part of this movie I enjoyed was the last 15 minutes, simply because the entire 15 minutes was fighting.  The fights were ok, except whenever Reyes Jr. executed his athletic abilites in his kicks I was stunned.  He moves like a video game charcater and he is very fast.  This is about the only reason you will want to own this film, the rest will make you want to turn away in embarassment.",1193097600,,1957,4.272479564032698
7893460,5,6305736359,"Brilliant movie with not much storyline because i like to think that the way the film has been made is for martial arts action only. Ernie Reeyes Jr did a great job and is very talented and his father Ernie Reeyes Sr is brilliant also. The plot is about a martial arts champion in the filipino style called arnis. His name is Pinoy (Shishir Inocalla) and travels to america in order to find himself and try to find out who he really is after nearly killing his opponent in his last competition back home. His fighting skills are put to the test when he finds himself in the middle of a gang war. Forced into sudden street combat against members of the Crazy Dragons gang, Pinoy saves the life of Jesse (Ernie Reeyes Jr) who was being attacked for stealing the gangs ounce of heroin. Impressed by Pinoys fighting techniques Jesse brings Pinoy with him to introduce him to his father (Ernie Reeyes Sr) and friends. The Crazy Dragons want their merchandise back so with the Crazy Dragon's poofter-freak boss and his right hand man (Kimo- UFC & K1 Fighter) surrounds Jesse's house threatening the lives of each member of the family. Now its time for Jesse to get serious and put his martial art skills to the test. Great Tae Kwon Do kicks, unbelievable chereography its a shame that these guys have not been in many films together.",1131408000,,1327,4.556485355648536
7893461,4,6305736359,"The story line was abit weak.
However, the action was amazing! Both Taekwondo and Arnis fight scenes were choreographed with such stimulating imagery.
The Filipino martial arts were represented well in this film. Not many martial arts movies contain the fine ancient art of Arnis. This is a film which opens ones mind to one of the ancient martial arts of the Philippines.",1076371200,,372,4.920634920634921
7893462,5,6305736359,"I have always loved Ernie Reyes Jr., his dad, The West Coast Action Team...the whole gang!!!  But this movie REALLY blew me away!!!!!!  The fight scenes were pinpoint perfect....EXCELLENT choreography by Ernie Sr.!!!!!!  The fastest and best martial arts fighting I've ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The drugs and language were a little heavy...but I think it emphasized the setting in which the gang dudes lived.  I really don't know how they do this stuff...even if I had practiced for 20 years I would never be able to do some of these moves!!!!!!  All and all, this was an AWESOME film!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

7893463,1,6305736359,"I was an Ernie Reyes Jr fan back when I was little, from watching Sidekicks (TV series), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2, and Surf Ninjas. Well I knew this was written/produced/action directed by Ernie, 'The Process' as it was originally called was hyped up by the fans to be a good movie. I, along with other fans were expecting a good showcase of martial arts, being the players included both Ernie's and the West Coast Demo Team. Boy was I totally wrong. I go rent this movie for $4.00 and got basically get 90 minutes of fluff. Bad acting. I mean, BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD. Incomprehensible plot, incomprehensible all-around. Everything about this movie was bad. I'm not joking. I'm sorry that they spent $50,000 on the production of the movie, according to Ernie Jr's website. What a horrible waste of money. I say Ernie should hook up with Yuen Woo Ping and do some Hong Kong Cinema. Showcase his skills the way it was meant to. Seriously. All in all, please save your money and do not, I repeat, DO NOT rent or buy this movie!",976924800,,1039,4.683060109289618
7893464,3,6305736359,The plot and story of this movie are really hard to follow and understand.  But the fighting scenes make up  for it. Ernie Reyes Jr is incredible. All  the moves he pulls out are just simply amazing! but this movie could of  been much better if it had a good story to go with the good action. it's a  shame.,965952000,,307,4.05
