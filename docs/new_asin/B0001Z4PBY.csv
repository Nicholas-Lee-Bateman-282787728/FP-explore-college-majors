2044046,5,B0001Z4PBY,"Oliver Stone would be proud of this film. I purchased copies of this for all my friends and family.....I have been a JFK researcher for 30 years...I own a 1970's copy of the Zapruder film and the Dallas police audio tapes. The editing and directing quality, as well as the research is fabulous. Over 90% of the country believes there was a conspiracy....and this remarkable film is a must see.
I would urge everyone to buy this insightfull piece of work. In June of 1963 JFK signed an executive order which would have abolished the private, for profit Federal Reserve, the holding company for the global elite. He also signed documents to pull us out of Vietnam...this would have cost the Military/Industrial complex and the bankers billions of dollars in lost money. Two months later, the CIA and the Pentagon started formulating assasination plans, the first in Chicago in the fall of 1963 which was discovered. JFK and RFK also betrayed the mob, which let to the CIA involving the mafia with the assasination. Oswald, a CIA operative, most likely never fired a shot. He was a patsy, and was set up like Tim Mcviegh.
Expand your horizons and buy this documentary. One of the best I've seen in 30 years !!!!!  I can't say enough good things about it !!!!!",1269302400,22,1256,4.683257918552036
2044047,2,B0001Z4PBY,"The DVD ""JFK: The Mysterious Death of Number Thirty-Five"" is really a
disaster! I'm sorry to say this! Not so much in what it has to say, but technically!
Firstly; the introduction is repeated! (don't they chech the film before ending the editing?)
Secondly (and worst!); the background music is louder than the voice of the speaker, making it periodically impossible to hear what's going on!
Thirdly; so enoying with all these break-ups with titles and choices to make between all the timy (and short) chapters!
Well, talk about being over-ambitious!

To sum it up; A amateurish production with really tiring result!
Such a pity and such a waist!

2044048,2,B0001Z4PBY,"This has the makings of a decent crime thriller, but it gets overdone in the storyline. Cash shows he's an actor in this as the sociopathic Johnny Talon. I also feel Vic(Mel Sharples)Tayback did a great performance in this as Fred his partner. This is an odd couple indeed, but there's nothing to laugh at here. Fred hires Johnny to hold up a bank, and the catch is they take the vice president's wife which Johnny does, and Fred does the hold-up. There's one catch though, and that's the vice-president doesn't care as he's about ready to run off with his mistress. Cash not only does a impressive acting job, but he actually shows off his guitar abilities here, and he's actually good. Unfortunately, this had some moments that were overdone like where the woman Priscilla keeps calling the vice-president's house to speak to his wife, and then there was little Ronnie Howard as thier little boy who makes it home just in time bringing the police with him. I found the ending too predictable not like in ""Jeopardy"" where Barbara Stanwyck convinces an bank robber to help her husband as he's caught under a fishing pier, and when he frees her husband she lets him escape. I feel the soundtrack was good, Cash was good, and so was Tayback, but the storyline was overdone by about 15 minutes. Wait till Walmart sells this for a buck.",1169769600,2,1332,4.624472573839663
2044049,3,B0001Z4PBY,"Cash plays a villian who conspires with a mobster to rob a bank by kidnapping a banker's wife and demanding money. He plays a kind of derranged villian who hasn't a problem killing another person (except children). It's a decent, low-budget  film, the kind of film you'll see on a Saturday afternoon on television--nothing remarkable. His acting is a bit stiff. He sings the song, ""Five Minutes to Live."" I've seen him in other, more exellent films. This one is for a collector.",1105056000,8,478,4.759036144578313
2044060,5,B0001Z4PBY,My mother is a big Johnny Cash fan and is always collecting his works.  This was a big surprise for her at Christmas! Thank-you!!,1357948800,,129,4.375
2044061,5,B0001Z4PBY,This is a perfect video for anyone who would love to cycle through the California wine country. The ride takes the viewer along many of the famous trails and routes through Sonoma and Napa counties where you pass countryside and rolling hills planted with grape vines and beautifully designed wineries. I thought the video was excellent and plan to buy more of them for my spinning class friends.,1343606400,,396,4.838235294117647
2044062,4,B0001Z4PBY,"Both of Sun Records Rockabilly sensations were grinding out films in the early 1960's. However, while Elvis was appearing in Technicolor extravagances and singing of Blue Hawaiis and Kissin Cousins, Johnny Cash was appearing in this b&w no-budget gem as a psycho looser holding a housewife hostage while crooning to her that she's got ""FIVE MINUTES TO LIVE""!...weird, it's kind of like Johnny Cash comes to Mayberry to rob the bank, flips out and ends up using Opie as a shield as he attempts a backyard escape through the neighborhood. Actually, that's pretty much what happens. Vic Tayback co-stars as Cash's partner in the bank robbery gone wrong and there are unpredictable jolts of violence and mayhem from Johnny to keep things interesting. Offbeat and strange and a little unsettling at times. Cash is quite good as are most of the other actors in this bare bones production. And Opie is...well, Opie. So even if you buy this one for the novelty, you won't be disappointed because it's really a pretty good movie, and the Alpha dvd print is quite acceptible too.",1300924800,8,1069,4.8791208791208796
2044063,1,B0001Z4PBY,"In my opinion this film is a total waste of time.  I have seen almost all of the JFK Assassination DVDs, and the best are THE MEN WHO KILLED KENNEDY (1-6), THE MEN WHO KILLED KENNEDY(7), which the Johnson family forced the History Channel to stop showing and selling, and JFK 3 SHOTS THAT CHANGED AMERICA.",1294185600,2,305,4.446428571428571
2044064,1,B0001Z4PBY,"This is a very poorly done dvd, don't waste your money. First of all, the introduction, music and credits are repeated many times, at the beginning of each section, to the point that it's annoying.  The background music is very loud, and at times drowns out the commentary.  The dvd length is about 45 minutes, and on the cover it states ""approximately 90 min"".  The information presented has been covered many times in other films, with just a little different twist, so really no new information is presented. There is an ""evidence"" section of the dvd- I was interested to watch that- and it was a joke, it showed a document that couldn't be read, and a picture of the Texas School Book Depository. I have other dvd's about the Kennedy assassination, all of them are much better that this one.",1294099200,7,795,4.624113475177305
2044065,4,B0001Z4PBY,"The producer does a good job driving home the evidence about the impossibility of the single bullet theory. But if you have researched this for 25 years like I have nothing new here, if you want a total overview and all of the possibilities, buy Crossfire by Jim Marrs.  The book Oliver Stone based his movie JFK on.",1284249600,2,316,4.448275862068965
2044066,4,B0001Z4PBY,"Overall I'm glad to have watched this DVD, but it could have been much more enjoyable.  My only complaint is the production, the music consistent throughout the documentary simply sucks.  In addition the documentary consist of rather short parts, but your buying an internet series so what can you expect. NOTE: This documentary really only proves Kennedy's autopsy and autopsy information was falsified, but doesn't provide any clue as to who to blame.",1282694400,3,453,5.191780821917808
2044067,4,B0001Z4PBY,"Johnny as a sociopath????  See it! If you are a fan you'll like it. Would have been a pretty good low budget thriler even without Cash, but it's a lot more fun with him.",1278633600,,169,3.9705882352941178
2044068,5,B0001Z4PBY,"I found a documentary on JFK on A&E this past winter and found the whole subject fascinating. Mendelson's documentary answered so many questions and really filled in the gaps. It was really exciting to see some of the unanswered questions explored. It amazes me to this day how the security, the autopsy, the press, all of it was so embryonic in the 60's! This lack of sophistiation is what makes this mystery not go away. I thoroughly enjoyed this video and highly recommend!",1269388800,,476,4.746987951807229
2044069,5,B0001Z4PBY,"In this presentation, Pat Speer takes the viewer on a mind baffeling tour of the very curious inner workings of Dr. Michael Baden and his relationship with House Select Committee on Assasinations. How autopsists were reluctantly coerced into changing their determinations, and persuaded by an aide to LBJ to obtain sworn affidavits, which due to the doctor's concern of their professional reputations, were not signed by them, but by the Department of Justice.
Other mysteries, such as Dr. Baden having H.S.C.A. artists adjust misleading exit-wound trajectory pictures of Kennedy's forehead and back (forehead wound previously unreported in virtually all prior medical examinations, and back wound adjusted upward in renderings). H.S.C.A trajectory experts having to change their measurements to accomodate ever-changing medical opinion, and suspiciously clear and concerted government effort to sustain the Warren Commission's determination that Oswald acted alone.
One very eye-opening view of very conflicting evidence, when you'd thought you'd heard it all!",1269302400,4,1061,5.896103896103896
8018666,5,B0001Z4PBY,I've been interested in the JFK assassination since 1973. I recorded many of the documentaries on my VCR and now want to have them on DVD in my collection.,1483228800,,155,4.379310344827586

8018669,4,B0001Z4PBY,"There is a lot of good information here about the ballistic and medical evidence, but I really urge everyone to go to Pat Speer's website and check out his free online book (and recent updates) for a lot more detail. Also, Speer is one of the few researchers to examine in depth the mainstream media's shameful, error-filled, misleading and deceptive coverage of the assassination over the last 50 years.",1429747200,,404,4.869565217391305
8018670,3,B0001Z4PBY,"FIVE MINUTES TO LIVE (aka: DOOR-TO-DOOR MANIAC) opens w/ Fred Dorella (Vic Tayback w/ hair!) telling the story of outlaw Johnny Cabot  (music icon, Johnny Cash) in flashback. Johnny's living w/ his gal, Doris (Midge Ware), waiting for the next big caper. Fred tells him of a bank robbery scheme, so Johnny jumps right in. Unfortunately for Doris, Fred recognizes her as someone's former girlfriend, causing trigger-happy Johnny to gun her down in cold blood! Next, we're introduced to the bank VP, Ken Wilson (Donald Woods), his wife, Nancy (Cay Forrester), and their son, Bobby (future mega-Director, Ronnie ""Opie"" Howard!). Several minutes elapse as we are treated to the mundane squabbles of the Woods clan, while Fred and Johnny case their house from outside. The domestic quarreling continues when Mr. Wilson drops in on his mistress, and we get neck-deep into Mr. Wilson's pre-divorce drama! Ugh! Thankfully, Johnny's an impatient man, so right after Bobby heads off to school, he makes his move. Posing as a door-to-door salesman, Johnny fools Mrs. Wilson, taking her hostage at long last. After pulling a gun on her, Johnny settles down to serenade the woman w/ some exquisite guitar picking, culminating in Johnny's crooning the title song! Meanwhile, Mr. Wilson argues w/ his mistress, unaware of the horror at home! At last, Wilson arrives at work, only to get caught up in a moral / ethical discussion about divorce! At this point, we may be wondering if the bank will ever be robbed. Back at the house, Johnny gives Nancy some beauty tips, after shooting a vase. Johnny gets frustrated, and starts shattering nick-knacks. Dear god! He's going plum crrazzy! Simultaneously, Fred -remember him?- enters the bank in order to enact the big plan. This, while Johnny finds that Mrs. Wilson just may be more resourceful than he'd anticipated. FMTL is a rather laborious venture indeed. Considering the title, one might expect a suspenseful crime-thriller. Unfortunately, the ""thrills"" are few and far between, though Cash is actually menacing in his berserk role. His fans should love him in this! It's too bad the rest of the movie isn't as engaging as he is!...",1416268800,,2169,5.041782729805014
8018671,5,B0001Z4PBY,"At long last...a decent film transfer of ""Five Minutes to Live"".
...and more Bears (Bear Family) Records and Movies of Hamburg, Germany has given this film it's long overdue legitimate release.
As opposed to many others who have released this film (including Alpha Video) that look, and sound like garbage, this is the best you'll probably ever see.
Handsome packaging, including an illustrated sixteen page booklet, and the film trailer.
Well worth your money, from an outfit who cares about American roots music, and it's presentation.",1407888000,2,537,5.255813953488372
8018672,2,B0001Z4PBY,Bought this because Bai Ling was in it.  Not what I thought it would be.  Enjoyed Bai's part but overall not worth buying for me.,1405382400,,129,4.12
8018673,4,B0001Z4PBY,Kind of a cheesy movie but worth it to see Johnny Cash as a killer....Low budget and the housewife wasn't as glamorous as the pictures on the cover,1399248000,,147,4.285714285714286
8018674,4,B0001Z4PBY,I liked the movie but I'm a Cash fan. If you don't like Cash you probably won't like this movie. I also liked seeing Ron Howard (Opie Taylor) in it. Entertaining for an old movie.,1394064000,,179,4.142857142857143
8018675,4,B0001Z4PBY,"Maybe it's simply the novelty of seeing the man in black playing a crazed villain while singing songs about death,but it is entertaining in a surreal kind of way. Picture quality is passable for such a low budget film. I often wondered if Johnny's performance was the inspiration for Zavier Bardem's Chugar in No Country For Old Men.",1369785600,,333,4.758620689655173
