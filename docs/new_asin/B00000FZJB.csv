1212328,5,B00000FZJB,"This film is very good fun, with aging Star Claude Rains in a very typical role (with a couple of jolly songs as well!). Anyone who wants to hear Rains sing, this is the DVD to get, and for a steal at $7.98. The picture quality, though not restored, is still very watchable with only minor signs of age. The audio I would only give 3 stars. It is very easy to hear, but gets grainy in some parts. The music on occasion suddenly goes low, so I turn the volume up only to find out that 3 seconds later it goes back to normal. If the sound goes down, remember it will only be for a couple of seconds.

1212329,3,B00000FZJB,"I just watched this film for the first time on PBS.  I thought I must have been made in the 1930's because it seemed so dated, but discovered it was a made-for-tv movie in 1957.  If I were just watching it as face-value entertainment, I would have thought it odd and boring, but I LOVED the cast and how it was made.  I loved recognizing Edvard Grieg's (modified) music, and the rhyming dialog that I later discovered was from Robert Browning's poem.  I had only seen Van Johnson in WW II movies, and so didn't know he sang, which was enjoyable.  Same for Claude Raines.  And Jim Backus was a great addition.  There were a lot of special effects that must have been really ""leading edge"" at the time (Van Johnson playing himself double, animated rats being driven to the river, items magically appearing and disappearing), and color at the time was very new, especially on tv.  I loved the quirkiness and had a great time watching it.",1182729600,14,934,4.517857142857143
1212330,2,B00000FZJB,"My daughter's friend loaned her this film, saying, ""This is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. Watch it and tell me what you think of it."" So we gave it a whirl, and we too found it very strange, right from the beginning. Seeing Van Johnson as the piper in that ugly red and white cape, slithering down the tree trunk like a snake was the sign this was only going to go downhill from here, and it did. I got bored with it pretty fast, and having so many dumb songs didn't help move it along either. The rhyming dialog was hokey too. It was pretty close to torture to watch...I rate movies 1 star that are pure torture ( such as the worst movies I think I have ever witnessed: Buster Keaton in Boom in the Moon, and Elvis Presley's Harum Scarum). This wasn't PURE torture, but pretty close. So really it rates 1 and 1/2 stars. I have never liked Van Johnson much, so he didn't help me like this weird bit of cinema. I have enjoyed Claude Rains in many classic films. I wonder why he stooped so low to be the mayor in this dumb movie? I guess by the time any actor is 68 yrs. old, they will take any role they can get, and such must have been Rains' case. During one of the dumb songs, I said to my daughter, "" When this is over, I am going to go online and read reviews about it, and I bet this is one of those films that will have tons of ""Oh, this was my favorite film when I was a child; so glad to see it available again"" type reviews. I got on IMDb and I was right! Nearly every review gushed at how wonderful this film was because of a childhood memory!! It made me laugh! I guess I wanted to post this review  to sort of balance out these sorts of childhood memory reviews. I have watched over 600 films from the classic era ( silents thru the 1950's) and this one is really really bad, folks. I guess if you get it for a dollar at Walmart, you aren't losing much to try it out. And maybe if you are a diehard fan of Van Johnson, you would want this in your collection. I know everyone has different appreciation for what is a ""good movie"". But all in our house were very glad when it was finally over, and we could watch something REALLY good!!!",1151884800,3,2163,4.041958041958042
1212331,4,B00000FZJB,"This review is being written from memory of when I used to watch this movie on TV!!  It's a little dated with lack of today's spectacular FX, but it's still a good, clean, old-time fanstasy based on a fairly tale that the whole family can watch.

I liked the story (even though it doesn't follow the actual story exactly, because in the fairly tale there was no happy ending).  The music was great and based off classical music and used very effectively throughout the movie. (The piece used as the piper's tune to lure the rats away has stuck with me all my life.) Definitely a movie parents can let children can watch and not be worried about filthy language or horrifying special effects.  It also teaches a lesson about honor and the consequences of not living up to it. Highly recommended.",1123113600,,794,4.570422535211268
1212332,5,B00000FZJB,"This Alpha Video DVD of 'The Pied Piper Of Hamelin' is the best source print of this film I have ever seen.

 'Pied Piper Of Hamelin' (1956) is a family treat for all ages and for all holidays. First filmed in color as a Hallmark TV special, it is a masterful, musical re-telling of the legendary fairy tale using the beautiful mysterious, music of Edward Grieg with new lyrics.

 The cast is first-rate, with movie great Van Johnson brilliantly playing the strange and often frightening piper, as well as the kind school teacher Trueson, who is also the village concience.  Legendary movie villain Claude Rains is absolutely wonderful as the clever, sneering, and corrupt lord mayor of Hamelin. Rains has a ball playing him like Prince John of 'Adventures Of Robin Hood' (1938) in retirement! He even does a comical, show-stopping song and dance! Jim Backus also appears as the King's messenger, and his comedy is sorely needed as this fairy tale goes dark in it's second half.

 One highlight of the film, is Van Johnson as the Pied Piper, leading the rats out of Hamelin to their deaths in the river. He is playing on his pipe the haunting melody of 'In The Hall Of The Mountain King' from Mr. Grieg's 'Peter Guint Suite' as the cleverly animated rats march to oblivion!

 Unlike the fairy tale, this 'Pied Piper Of Hamelin' has a happy ending with a lesson for everyone about greed, selfishness, and false pride.",1049673600,29,1416,4.700404858299595
1212333,5,B00000FZJB,"I highly recommend this film, and would give it more stars if I could.  Van Johnson is great as the Pied Piper.  This movie is for people of all ages.  It's well worth seeing!",1007769600,4,175,4.088235294117647

1212408,3,B00000FZJB,"First, I am offended by your phrases that certain THINGS are 'REQUIRED' in this review. NOTHING can be required of anybody in this type of communication. I should stop right here and tell you to mind your own business!

As for the film, I figure Van Johnson's carreer was on the downpath and that the European films he had been making were not keeping his star alive. Playing a villian usually helps; he looks like he is enjoying that in the film. Rhyme set to Edvard Grieg' music is interesting; low cfost, too!

It is a fairy tale and fairy tales are best when told once, no repeats; I will not watch the video again.",1392249600,,619,4.373913043478261
1212409,4,B00000FZJB,"I realize that as far as film restoration priorities go, THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN is probably 10 to the power 4 on that list but I still have hopes of seeing it again looking the way it did when it was first broadcast on TV back in 1957 while I'm still around to appreciate it. PIED PIPER was one of the very first made-for-TV movies and the first one to be made in color even though television pictures were still in black & white. Unlike PLAYHOUSE 90 or THE HALLMARK HALL OF FAME presentations, this was shot on film, not performed live and captured on videotape which gave it a superior broadcast quality. The film proved to be very popular and was shown on NBC around Thanksgiving until the mid-1960s then it disappeared from the airwaves. It made quite the impression on a 5 year old and although today I can see the low budget special effects for what they are, I can still appreciate them for what they meant to me at the time. In time the film slipped into the public domain which is why there are so many bad copies of it out there (including You Tube). This DVD-R is one of the better ones and the cover reproduces the theatrical poster of 1966 but the use of a high quality print (hopefully one exists) for a DVD master would be greatly appreciated.

The movie is loosely based on Robert Browning's poem of the same name. All of the dialogue is in rhyme and a lot of the poem is actually quoted. The town of Hamelin looks like a soundstage set of the period  but the costumes are colorful and the characters are larger than life as befits what is essentially a children's musical. In fact it's the music that everyone remembers as all of it comes from Edvard Grieg and most of it from his PEER GYNT suites. The ridding of the town of rats to ""In the Hall of the Mountain King"" is something that no kid will fail to be impressed by if they are young enough. I showed it to my kids when they were roughly my age when I first saw it and they ""ooohed and ahhhed"" and asked to see it again, a luxury I didn't have in the late 1950s. Van Johnson is a striking Pied Piper (with a human alter ego Truson) while Claude Rains is the perfect crooked politician as the Mayor. Among the town councilmen is Spike Jones regular Doodles Weaver (Sigourney's uncle) and guest stars Jim Backus and Kay Starr (a popular female vocalist of the time) get to have their moments to shine. Although it's a relic from a bygone era (complete with happy ending), it doesn't deserve the public domain oblivion into which it's fallen.",1386979200,8,2516,4.328389830508475

THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN is a marvelous musical adaptation of the fable that was filmed in Technicolor for CBS TV. All songs are based on Edward Grieg's melodies (including the most-familiar ""In the Hall of the Mountain King."" Claude Rains (mayor) handles his vocals well, but Van Johnson is an absolute revelation. In a dual role he has five numbers and dances most nimbly. Also here is pop singer Kay Starr. Jim Backus appears in comic relief as the king's emissary.

The Piper addresses the avarice of Hamelin's mayor and city council, who refuse aid to nearby flood-ravaged Hamelout (where the rats originated from), by demanding all of the 50,000 gold guilders in the town treasury. He plans to distribute their money to Hamelout's unfortunate citizens.

Knowing the entire village has witnessed a promise of payment in full for rat removal, the mayor still has the coinage melted into golden bells for Hamelin's new clock tower, as part of an effort to win the king's approval along with a coveted royal banner. After the fact, the mayor devises a 10-foot-long legal document with numerous stipulations (like a 100 year escrow period) to avoid paying the Piper. After being so rudely handled and seeing that he won't be paid, the Piper's revenge is to lead Hamelin's children out of town with a played song that only they can hear. A nearby mountain opens up; everyone disappears inside before it seals shut again.

This unhappy development is how the legend ends, but the TV movie has a brighter conclusion.

1212453,5,B00000FZJB,"I remembered seeing this one afternoon as a child and totally loved it.
This fantasy folktale holds up even today with its moral lesson of hoarded wealth and what's truly treasurable. Since getting it on DVD, I've shared it with kids and adults alike who thoroughly enjoyed it.

Van Johnson as the Pied Piper is terrific, as Trueson he is more low key, but my favorite in the production is Claude Rains who steals the show as the Mayor of Hamelin Town. The sound is muffled at times and drops in and out in volume and there are alot of scratches and dust all unfortunate, but to some extent acceptable.  The real regret is during Claude Rains' big song number ""Prestige"".  During the song and dance number there are several jump cuts or missing bits of footage, so some lyrics are actually missing. By the way, the music is based upon the works of the composer Edvard Grieg (NOT THE LYRICS).

There are no extras except for an index which is too bad given Van Johnson has just passed away at this writing and it would have been nice to have sub-titles as some of the songs like Prestige, Flim Flam Flue and another of the Piper's song are ""sung spoken"" so fast it's hard to understand what the singers are saying. There are many great names in this production Johnson, Rains, Kay Starr and Jim Bacchus (before Thurston Howell III or Mr Magoo).

The funniest part of the production is when the Piper reads the legal form he is asked to sign by the Council -- any legal beagle will get a kick out of it!

Some have critiqued this movie, which is actually a rather lavish television special, as weird, corny, dumb and who actually ridiculed other reviewers who remembered the Piper fondly from their childhood. Given this un-christian attitude and that they're not fond of musicals and dislike Van Johnson and hate the way Hollywood portrays things sort of reduces their credibility. Amusing that they did use the word ""weird"" given the ending of Browning's poem about a people with ""outlandish ways and dress"". Perhaps they actually read it, but then they would have known the story is based on a tale from the 14th century, sung, written about and eventually written down by Browning in rhyme. Thusly, the production was rhymed to emulate the poem and lifts a good bit from Browning. The Piper's costume is based on sketches and artwork of the Piper dating back centuries. Although the ending was changed to make it happier, the production generally follows the poem's moral lesson of keeping promises. Overall, this centuries old fantasy folk tale is an enjoyeable outing for any family.",1229040000,5,2587,4.674725274725275
