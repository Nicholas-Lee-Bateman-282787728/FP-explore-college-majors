8406798,5,B003VHUHLG,"Simon & Malou (No Time For Love) is an enjoyable comedy from 2009 starring Dejan Cukic and Swedish actress Tuva Nuvotny. Cukic plays children's novelist Simon who is intent on having a family whereas Malou is a career-driven lawyer.
On arriving in Copenhagen Swedish lawyer Malou discovers that the flat she is to live in is still occupied by Simon who has just broken up form girlfriend Lotte. It's then agreed that Simon can stay a short while until he sorts himself out. An accident later forces Simon closer to Malou.
Swede Joel Kinnaman (The Killing) appears as Malou's Swedish boyfriend Stefan who is not impressed with Malou's new living arrangements and Robert Hansen stars as Carsten, Simon's friend.
This is certainly a funny movie with a fine cast of Nordic talent. Nuvotny has several Swedish movies and soap opera Skilda V&auml;rldar under her belt, Cukic has had roles in the recent Wallander series as well as success in Nickolaj og Julie. Kinnaman is probably the most recognised to those outside of Scandinavia due to his appearance as Detective Stephen Holder in The Killing. Hansen is known as Viktor in the Anja og Viktor series of movies in Denmark.
If it's a rom-com you're after and you don't mind the subtitles, Simon & Malou is the answer.",1318204800,,1264,4.829493087557604
