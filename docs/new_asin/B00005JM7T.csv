1508075,1,B00005JM7T,"Dakota Fanning, future ruler of all the universe, has let down her loyal following by appearing in this piece of tripe! Want to see a good Dakota Fanning movie? Rent/buy anything but this! Good art direction, but the performers are wasted-Dakota, Mike Myers, Spencer Breslin, et. al., all that talent gone to waste in this craptacular film. Oh, Dakota, please promise us your loyal viewing public that your next picture won't stink like this one!!! Please, if a Fanning has to appear in a lousy film, let it be Elle-she was in ""Daddy Day Care"", so she should be used to it by now! Honestly, if your films are as bad as this one, I may be forced to switch my presidential vote from you to Emma Watson-she's from the U.K., so she could never be elected-but I am hoping that if enough people write in your name, they will waive the archaic and capricious ""35-years-old to be President"" rule, and the U.S. could see a Dakota Fanning presidency! Fanning in 2004! Let's get out the vote, and bring peace and harmony to the world!

Not really good material for young children.  The movie rating is ""PG"".  This means you won't want your five year-old to watch it.  Would you want your ten year-old to watch ""Alien"", ""The Thing"" or ""Phantasm""?  Those would give them nightmares for weeks!

1509005,1,B00005JM7T,"I don't even know where to begin. This movie is honestly just that bad. It's like if Jack and Jill and the live action Garfield films gave birth to Satan spawn: The Cat in the Hat. I'm going to list the three biggest problems before I attempt to forget about this movie forever.

Problem 1: It's an adaptation of a Dr. Seuss book. Being a kids' book, there's not enough source material to base a movie off of, but this film takes an adaptation to a whole other level. It has NOTHING to do with The Cat in the Hat. The things in this movie make no sense, and, frankly, are quite disturbing. Not only will your kids not understand what's going on, but you will also be scratching your head wondering what in the world is happening. Bottom line, this movie has as much to do with The Cat in the Hat as jumping on a trampoline has to do with getting a high score. This movie is horrible.

Problem 2:  Mike Myers. This is probably the biggest issue with the whole film. Mike Myers does not compare to Jim Carrey's Grinch. Whereas Carry was goofy and real life-like, Myers is full blown terrifying. He is not imaginative, timeless, creative or inspiring; he is horrifying, and the things he does are border-line offensive. It's disgusting. How the producers, Myers or anybody else in this film got away with this, I have no idea. This is not a movie for kids; this is a movie for those looking to sink into a life of depression and anxiety.

Problem 3: The other characters are boring and there is no real sense of story. The acting barely meets the quality of home video, and nobody seems engaged with what they are doing. To complement this, the plot, if you can call it that, has nothing to keep you interested. Yes, it's an adaptation of a Seuss book, but if you insist on making a film like this, you have to make it engaging to keep the audience going. This movie does not do that. The only time you will remark on what is happening in this film is when you wonder why Mike Myers is holding the two kids hostage.

This is all I can take. For the love of God, please don't watch this film. Don't show it to your kids. Don't show it to your family or friends. Don't even watch it for a million bucks. The shell shock you get from having watched this nightmare will not be worth any cent of that million. The Devil himself wouldn't show this film to Hell's denizens. It is that bad. Once you watch this travesty, you will be unable to believe in the inherent good of the human race. If you see a copy of this movie, destroy it. The Dark Lord himself wouldn't put this thing around his finger. Do yourself a favor, and send this abomination back to the fiery depths from whence it came.",1500595200,,2682,4.292490118577075

I was very unhappy with the content. In my opinion, you would not find any of this a real Dr. Suess book so the addition kind of sickened me. Our kids have plenty of time to be subjected to those things when they are older. :-(

IMBD: Sex & Nudity: 5/10

The Cat reacts with interest when he sees a woman's photograph (it unfolds like a centerfold). He makes noises like ""humina-humina-humina-humina, oooh"". His hat grows longer (implying that he has an erection). When Conrad states that's his mother, he says, ""Awkward"", and his hat shrinks to normal size.

The Cat admires a young woman (Paris Hilton) dancing. The woman wears a short top and small skirt (she has a bare abdomen and cleavage).

The Cat bends over and we see his computer-generated buttocks. This is for comedic effect.

The Cat is carrying a garden hoe in one scene and blurts out, ""Dirty hoe"" and then says, ""I'm sorry baby I love you."" He attempts to lick the garden hoe, but is interrupted. (Played for comedic effect, most kids probably won't understand this.)

When asked where he came from, the Cat states, ""When a Mommy cat and a Daddy cat love each other very much, they decide---"", but he is quickly stopped by Conrad.

Like many kids movies, it has hidden innuendos.",1489017600,4,1424,4.56078431372549
1509257,5,B00005JM7T,This movie is hilarious. I don't see why parents have to complain about the humor in the movie. Your kids won't get it. I loved this movie as a kid and thought it was funny.

Specifically there is A LOT of potty humor, demeaning jokes, and VERY questionable content. At one point the cat referred to a ho, while talking to a garden hoe.

I couldn't find it on the TV again so I went to my firestick and found it online. I actually should've bought it instead of renting it but whatever.

If you don't know the book and the movie this movie is about a large cat that brings mischief to a household with 2 kids. The son is michievious and a rule breaker and the daughter is a controlling upright know it all who doesn't know what fun really is. After meeting cat he helps destroy their house and have fun in the process. He helps them maintain an even level of themselves as well as helps them get along which in return helps them repair their destroyed house.

Overall a cute movie and fun for all ages",1487894400,,798,4.044303797468355

1509545,2,B00005JM7T,I grew up on Dr. Seuss.  I still think he's the best.  But this is an absolute bottom of the barrel movie.  Except for Waynes World.  Michael Myers gets on my nerves after about ten minutes in every movie he has been in.  He gives me the opinion that he himself thinks he's a lot funnier then he really is.  Basically they took a classic children's and ruined it.  This will go right along side other great movies on the Michael Myers resume like The Love Guru.,1482192000,,461,4.2298850574712645

This movie is nothing but an insult to Dr. Seus, I swear he rolled in his grave at every sex joke in this movie, counting at 9 at the very least. Sex jokes in a KIDS movie...need I REALLY explain more as to why its bad?

If I were, then I should add the acting is terrible, the jokes are awful, and my god Mike Myers should be given the award for worst actor ever in this movie. He only has two expressions and seems very restrained by the costume. The makeup and effects are awful, and the story sucks as well.

There is no logic to the story. Whatever critic put ""Enormously funny"" on the cover is either very STUPID or was paid to put it there. Because no human in their right mind would praise this film unless they were bribed. This movie should not be viewed by kids or hell anyone for that matter.

It wouldn't be difficult to argue that Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather is the greatest film ever made, for example, but it would be quite difficult to argue that Mario Puzo's novel is the greatest book ever written. Still, it's true that books are usually better than their eventual cinematic adaptations, and rarely is this more true with Bo Welch's bastardization of The Cat in the Hat. Welch is a production designer and while it's competently staged in terms of production design, the script is terrible and as the titular cat, Mike Myers is just kind of creepy. After Ron Howard's terrible version of How the Grinch Stole Christmas and this even worse film, Dr. Seuss' widow refused to allow any more live-action adaptations of her late husband's work, and I can empathize with that, as seeing brilliant material be treated like this must be disheartening when it's so close and personal.

I couldn't believe they turned this cute book into a movie full of rude antics, crude behavior, and sexual innuendos.

The movie isn't terrible, the problem is twofold:
1) Mike Myers makes a great Cat except that the story is written to feature his trademarks and ""Mike Myers"", not the Cat. Jim Carrey as the Grinch was not Ace Ventura but a pretty good Grinch. His shtick wasn't prevalent. But it is here with Myers. He didn't write the script but whoever did obviously thought this would bring in more money. I wish Myers had played the Cat more than himself.

The crude jokes are not on par with say, Shrek (which some people find too offensive for young children, but I still think that one is okay).  This movie is way, way worse in the crude/nasty department than a Shrek movie.  And the bad/rude comments are one right after another...throughout the movie.  I could see how if your kids are over 12 years old, and know the book...they might be entertained by this kind of nasty/adult humor twist on a child's classic.

Another part they are talking about the cat's new car which the meaning spells S.L.O.W. but then he explains that the old car's name / meaning was spelled S.H.I.T.  There was also a part where he calls a hoe (the actual tool for digging the ground) a dirty hoe, then proceeds to make up with it.  Not something that I would like my son watching.

It has good values focusing on family & being responsible, doing the right thing, admitting you're wrong, etc. in between the ridiculous cat in the hat (pretty much exactly like Austin Powers) interacting with the kids on crazy adventures. The kids didn't really ""get it"" but I enjoyed it more than they did. There's a few slightly crude places that are a little over the top for young children.",1397952000,,588,4.5046728971962615

I think this movie had potential, as the large cartoony stuff and exciteable characters do well. In this, I think the mom is a single mom, too. So that was slightly interesting, but it is really dumb and didn't hold my child's attention anyway. I myself think Mike Meyers can only be ""so"" funny with his quips before he gets old.

Those tend to be the words kids pick up on very quickly and even though I can tend to be very open minded some parents would really not like that. I even noticed a bunch of our Disney Animated movies have cursing. Guess it's just the way of the world any more.

Our son definitely connected with Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning characters; these children definitely ""delivered"" a great performance.  However, all of us found Mike Myers to be somewhat predictable and very into his Austin Powers persona.  Same mannerisms, same voice...simply not versatile enough.  Kelly Preston really surprised us, I would've never pictured her in such a mom role, but she was great.  And Alec Baldwin is...well, Alec Baldwin.  Very predictable performance.

And of course, the movie didn't stay TOO true to the back, they needed to cut a few corners.  Thing 1 and Thing 2 were cute.  Overall, a nice, solid B+.",1394582400,,774,4.847328244274809

My childhood memories of sitting in a sunny corner, flipping through the book and eating my crayons were mauled, pillaged, ransacked and then really abused.  I staggered from the theatre in a daze, scarcely believing what I had just experienced.  If only it had been quieter in there I could have tried sleeping though it, but the wailing, crying, gnashing of teeth and thrashing about were too much, and that was only what I was going through -- some moviegoers simply got up and left.  They probably bragged to their friends later about having above average survival instincts.  This movie is great for driving away unwanted guests who drop in uninvited and/or don't know when to go home.  Though some of the more masochistic ones may actually enjoy it.",1376524800,4,904,4.8

1512873,5,B00005JM7T,"I get why so many people are upset over this film, especially if you are a parent and are mindful.of what your kids see and hear. I personally don't think it's that bad for children to watch. Kids are more fascinated with a silly looking over-sized cat that talks- in a house with bright and wacky colors and the energy and thrill of the hyperactivity. Kids aren't concerned eith all that dialogue and most of the stuff thats meant to be funny is over their heads anyway. Seriously. However, I do understand if someone would prefer for their children not to watch it which in my mind is ridiculous. It's not that serious, I've seen much worse on Looney Tunes and Merry Melodies growing up. A DVD is not going to raise your child, thats YOUR job as a parent. That being said...

I give a mild example about something in the film.thats completely over a childs head, they wouldnt get it at all. This is just a sneak peak of the point im making...

Example: After the children discover an oversized cat in their house (after running and screaming for 10 mins) they finally realize this cat is ridiculous and harmless. They talk, chat bla bla bla. He pulls out a clipboard with a stack of papers as thick as a phonebook, he hands them pens and asks them to sign and initial where he points his finger. Hes flipping through the contract as they're signing and refers to a part of the contract as 'Section 8'. He says 'Section 8 of this contract is yada yada yada'. What child would pick that up? The way the term was used was to refer to a particular section in the documents that happened to be the 8th section of the contract. Its silly and easy to miss and if you're a child it most likely will go completely over your head. I picked it up after watching it today. I had the movie since it was released on DVD and just popped it in after 6 or 7 years and I just realized how slick that was lol. Its 'stupid/silly' stuff like this.

I wouldn't call it innocent at all, its not a dingy movie. Only a person with life experience would pick up on the humor. A naive child would be completely deaf to all the jokes, its basically like there are no jokes- its like listening to someone speak their native language infront of you and you're completely oblivious to wgat they're saying. You don't even care and you forgot it ever happened.

The other two situations that stuck in my head would be when the cat was dressed as Rosarita or Quita Banana (whoever she is...) He was singing in drag and something he was singing about rhymed with 'balls' (as in his ballsack) the music slowed and paused before he could say it- he sits for 4 or 5 secs and thinks of another word (he uses 'boys' instead) and continues singing.

Another event was when he was on the homeshopping network or a cooking show similar to a Rachael Rae or Paula Deen. The show is called 'Astounding Products'. Long story, short- he makes a mistake and chops the end of his tail off with a butcher knife, he doesnt realize he did this until Dakota Fanning points it out abd he yells ""SON OF A..."" and an extended bleep sound conceals 'you know the word'.

The bottom line is that, I would say this movie is more for kids in 3rd to 5th grade. The humor that I just mentioned is something most 3rd, 4th and 5th grade kids would find retarded but something to smile at. Kids that are younger wouldn't even be listening, and anyone older (like me) cracks up because its so narrow and basic.

Would I say this is a good movie? Well, I laugh at stuff thats not supposed to be funny. Im tickled very easily. It's 'stupid' comedy but not over-the-top. What kept me so entertained was the design of the set, the bright colors and how simple the humor was. I think its a cute movie, I like it alot. If im speaking in general I wouldnt say its a great movie. Most movies that get realky goid ratings are usually boring to.me.

You will laugh, so will your kids, mine are 1 and 7 and we love it.  Breslin and fanning are incredible and they really look like they had a fun time.
Of course if you want high brow poetry then I suggest you stick with Poe, Hardy or Keats, perhaps even Whitman.

Watch it over and over again, and then go out and get the book, all of suess poems and have an existential conversion about Horton and a nature of our nature discussion about the grinch.

1513025,1,B00005JM7T,"Premise: A hopped-up cat shows two small kids how to have a good time in a world seemingly without consequences.

Annoyance level (1-10): I give this show a 4, mostly for the manic speech patterns of the Cat. Martin Short (the voice) is a fine actor whose oscar winning turn in the Father of the Bride movies made him the pride of Canada. However, I would love to see renowned actors Kenneth Branaugh, Matthew McConaughey or Ralph Fiennes sink their teeth into such a juicy role. I can just hear it now: ""hey kids, let's get all crazy and fly on the ceiling, all while tasting this magic fruit...what a very plum...plum...""

Educational content: This show teaches that it is important to accept people of all shapes and sizes, including those that speak faster than an auctioneer on speed.

Questionable content that makes me wonder: When those two kids grow up, will the Cat's magic help them to learn about the classics of literature? I'd like to see the Cat make Charlotte Bronte's works fun, relevant, and exciting - now THAT would be something!

If I were a script writer: The Cat would take the kids to an animal shelter where they learned the importance of spaying and neutering.

I find a lot of inappropriate humor in kids movies now days but I also feel like they've put those in their for the adults, they want a family that everyone can enjoy and that's what Cat in the Hat does. Toddlers laugh at the huge hairy cat and talking goldfish, big kids laugh at the antics and adults laugh at the sometime outlandish content it's the perfect family movie!

It's been universally panned, especially at release, so I never gave it a 2nd thought. Turns out all the panning was coming from boring cattle that use the TV to babysit their imagination challenged progeny while they go on a Red Lobster date and bring them home McDonald's happy meals for supper. Face it, as 1st graders you thought ""Fun with Dick & Jane"" was gripping drama. You think it's OK for your kids to watch Barney. Dr. Seuss was kind of funny but OVER YOUR HEAD.

This film is not for today's kids. It is for grown ups who loved Dr. Seuss as kids. Dr. Seuss was always intellectual & subversive. Green eggs & ham? Sneetches with stars on their bellies and those without, during the civil rights battles?

Dr. Seuss is not spinning in his grave, he's smiling to see someone made a film for his kids all grown up.",1355356800,2,1013,4.464864864864865

About children not growing up to fast, and yet taking responsiblity for their actions which most fail to realize. LITTLE little kids, such as my 4 year old don't understand the jokes yet, they just see a funny looking giant cat acting all funny, kids making messes, and good music. There is an age range I would suggest NOT showing it to because it DOES have more adult humor in it. But for little kids, teens, and adults then this movie is fun! Also, NO this is not like the book, someone was whinging about that. Just like the other books that were redone into movies, they added to it, changed it a bit and added more!

But I must congratulate him over what he achieved in this one: managing to mix his patented bawdy humor with the innocent and chaotic tale of destruction that ""The Cat in the Hat"" is.
And he succeeds wonderfully; Myers only misses a beat twice in the movie. One, is when he overacts as a ""couch mechanic"" (you ought to see it) and wrestles with an elephant trunk. It's curious, since it's the sort of weird humor I enjoy and write about, but he only managed to make me frown in that scene.
Which killed Mr. Myers' comedic pacing a little. Good thing he recovers quickly and more zany fun ensues. His second misstep is with the S.L.O.W. vehicle; it'd usually lend itself to more silly mischief, but I guess that's a prop he didn't know how to milk properly.
My favorite scene, though, was the one where he pokes fun at stupid infomercials; he's absolutely at his best there.

Alec Baldwin is particularly noxious. They took a cute kid's story and turned it into really awful stuff: gross, coarse ""potty humor"" of the worst kind.

 A brother and sister are left in the house under the care of a babysitter who can't stay awake while their mother goes out to do her real estate stuff. The smarmy neighbor, Baldwin, shows up as does the Cat in the Hat. The Cat turns out to be an obnoxious, snide pest who ruins the house.

1513599,3,B00005JM7T,"I simply don't understand all the poor reviews on this film. I think it proves that many of the people who went to see this film had no idea of what to expect from Dreamworks and Mike Myers. If you like the Austin Powers movies you will really like this. No it wasn't some dumb children's Disney movie. It was edgy and had a more of a sophisticated interpretation of the original Dr. Seuss book.

I'm guessing the problem is that most of those were expecting a re-enactment of the original children's book. And I doubt seriously Mike Myers or Dreamworks would do such a movie as that. My philosophy on movie and books is simply they are not one and of the same. The children's classic The Cat In the Hat was meant to be one of the first books a child could learn to read. It featured a wonderful use of colorful words to go along with the wonderful illustrations of that era of printed children's publishing. If that is what one expects then they would be best just stick to the classic original children's book. I would wager a bet that most of the parents who complained about this movie never bothered to give their children the book. Instead they just take their brats to the multiplex and expect them to have the same experience as actually reading the children's book.

No this is a highly entertaining and humorous critic of modern American life. The character of Mr. Humberfloob (Sean Hayes) and Quinn (Alec Baldwin) along with the mom played by Kelly Preston and the two wonderful child actors do in fact present a satire of modern life. No, children like Sally did not have Palm Pilot organizers in the original book. And no the children in the original book were not as uptight and materialistic as those of 2003. So naturally the Cat (Mike Myers) had to be more sophisticated and edgy.

Bottom line this movie is a view of modern day life in uptight urban America. It simply follows the storyline from Dr. Seuss's children's book. It was not meant to be a remake of the printed book. And if there are those out there that thought so then God help them.

In the spirit of shrek and the other recent releases of kid movies that entertain the adults with clever humor I really didn't find anything ""clever"" here. The few adult oriented lines such as the one above about the ""dirty hoe"" , stick out from the rest of the movie dialog in a way that seem forced. It was like they wrote a great little kids movie then went back and forced some adult humor into the script hoping for a duel audience win over. It don't work.

If I had taken an elementary school child to this I probably would have given it a 1. As it is I gave it a 7. Yes, it had a slew of bad taste jokes, but I laughed several times. Mike Meyers is a funny cat. And I think it should be nominated for an Oscar for set design. Yes, Dr. Seuss is probably rolling in his grave at the liberties that the scriptwriters took.

On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give ""The Cat in the Hat"" a 5, possibly a 5-and-a-half. But I would take this over something like ""Monty Python"" any day. (Monty Python, in my personal opinion, is a definite all-time low. I have yet to see any other movie that sinks below that one.)

It is another example of Hollywood dumping tons of money on the look of a movie instead of the script. Dont get me wrong, this movie looks great.

They could have done something much better with the story but instead tried to make it funny to both adults and kids. When will writers learn? Either MAKE IT A GROWNUP MOVIE OR MAKE IT A KIDS MOVIE! It's really hard to do both without kids going ""Huh?"" and adults going ""funny but I can't explain it to the kids."" Mike Myers was just UNFUNNY as the cat and his delivery of the jokes was rotten. He's barely funny anyway, (example, Waynes World where Mike is a 40 year old dude playing a teenager..also not funny) why would they put him in this movie? It really comes off like he is trying too hard, it's painful to watch. Jim Carey would have been way funnier as the cat in my opinion. I liked the colorful costumes and houses. Visually it was amazing and captured the look and theme of the book but everything else fell short. The kids acting was pretty good and the ending was funny. It's just too bad they made such a bad choice when casting the Cat. Mike ruined the movie and he was way too over the top. If I never see him 'act' again I would not be upset. The jokes in the movie were way too grown up, kids are smart and sadly a lot of them might actually understand this humor and it sets a bad example.

1513886,1,B00005JM7T,"Once upon a time, I was a precocious two-year-old who memorized movies even if she had no clue what the words meant.  One such movie was Dr. Seuss' ""The Cat in the Hat,"" the teleplay featuring the voice of Allan Sherman as the cat.  The story ruled, the music ruled, Dr. Seuss...owned.

Once upon another time, I was an awkward 11-year-old in an awkward class of sixth graders in a coach bus on their way back from a long field trip.  We thought our teachers were SO COOL because they allowed us to see a PG-13 movie, even though NONE of us had yet turned 13.  Said movie was ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.""  Naturally, we ate it up faster than you could say ""green eggs and hormones.""

Fast forward to late 2003, when I sat in the movie theatre with my good friend Michelle.  The last time she and I had gone to the cinema together, we'd seen ""From Justin to Kelly,"" and I suppose we were both determined to make it up to each other.  So I figured, hey, a talented and comedic lead actor playing the coolest cat that anyone's imagination ever conjured up--what could possibly go wrong?

I spent the length of the movie trying desperately to like it.  Trying desperately to enjoy seeing Austin Powers go undercover as a children's book character--dirty jokes and all.  Trying desperately to smile during the scene of cupcake-making.  Trying to laugh during--what?--Paris Hilton??  It worked fine for ""Zoolander,"" but that woman has no right to stick her oddly-shaped nose into this production!

The only failure more miserable than my own attempts to enjoy the movie was the movie itself.  I feel awful for Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin, who would have been the perfect Sally and Conrad, but they were as lost in this film as penguins in Hawaii.

Don't worry, Audrey Geisel, it's not your fault.  Permitting the production of this movie was a mistake anyone could have made.  I trust that in the future, you'll be more selective about who gets their grubby paws on the rights to your late, great husband's immortal masterpieces.

They take something from our childhood and mangle it beyond recognition and add adult humor so maybe parents will enjoy it and buy it when released for home viewing.  I made it as far as the ""dirty Hoe"" reference and then stopped the movie once the cat made sexual overtures to the ""dirty hoe"".  What tripe.  I am not upset they changed it from the book since that is part and parcel of Hollywood.  That is why we have the colloquialism ""The book was better"" because they do such a good job of taking something simple and pure with a simple mesage and transforming it to something unrecognizable.  To let your children view this is to train them in the based humor of mankind and maybe get them killed when they try stair-bobsledding.

We love Dr. Suess as much as the next family but if you can set him aside for an hour or so you'll find this movie is a whole lot of silly fun. It's very brightly colored, has good energetic music, lots of screaming, running, jumping, laughing and nonsense; it's a very ALIVE movie.

Aside from its shameless promotion of the studio which produced it and the mention of the movie's pop soundtrack, this film is just too off color to be a kid's film.  With several profanity references and some crude bodily humor, one wonders why they felt they had to include such nonsense.  Visually, the movie is delightful to behold with its garish colors and some nifty special effects.  Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin are perfect as the kids, and Alec Baldwin does a nice turn as the nasty slovenly boyfriend.  But Mike Myers is just too out of control and self parodying, and Sean Hayes is a real waste as the hygienically concerned boss, but he's delightful in the voice of the fish.  I wouldn't want my kids to see it; it's just not in the true spirit of the Seuss books which inspired it.",1134345600,8,915,4.58282208588957
1513891,1,B00005JM7T,"The Cat in the Hat is one of the most beloved children's books ever. It's surely Dr. Seuss' most famous. So the prospect of bringing it to the world of film for kids to be re-introduced to its magic (which worked for The Grinch) seemed like a great idea.

It WAS a good idea.

This movie, however, is about as fun as a hairball. It takes the basic story of little kids Sally and Conrad, their fish, and the mischievous talking cat who makes their rainy day more interesting and stomps on it with adult jokes, lame impersonations, unpleasant supporting characters, and just plain stupidity. Mike Myers is a very funny guy, but here he's like a retarded Cowardly Lion on speed, turning into cooking show hosts, plumbers, pinatas, salsa dancers, and so on, each and every one of them 100% not funny. Throw in double entendres that could be almost acceptable if they were actually FUNNY (The Cat steps on a hoe and says, 'Dirty ho.' Not funny. Oh, but then he brings it BACK and starts to put his TONGUE ON IT. HA HA HA! LAUGH!)

I'm going into a rant now. I guess the movie is fun for kids that just like noise and silly voices or stoners or people who hate the book, or even people willing to see the movie as a Mike Myers vehicle like Austin Powers. I, however, found it to be one of the worst adaptations of anything, and I just pray there won't be a sequel (there's a second book, though. Yikes.)

Oh, and Alec Baldwin, who plays the sleazy neighbor? He skipped the Oscars, where he was nominated, to record commentary for this movie. I thought he was the SMART Baldwin.",1134345600,9,1571,4.3883161512027495

Even though his performance of the Cat in the Hat at times reminded me of the Cowardly Lion or Snagglepuss with an Austin Powers laugh, Mike Myers does make the cat come to life. The children in the movie do a great job as well.

The scenery of the film stayed true to the world of Dr. Seuss and looked great, even though much of it was once again not in the book. It looked like I was watching a Seuss book come to life.

I was surprised with how many adult jokes made it into the film, not that it bothered me, but I wouldn't expect some of the things hinted at would be hinted at in a movie based on a children's classic. It's kind of like watching Shrek, adults will get some jokes that kids might not get.

Overall a good movie, but if you are expecting this to be exactly like the book, you are going to be very disappointed because this is almost nothing like the book. But like I said, that doesn't necessarily mean that makes it a bad film. I didn't think so, but it's just one of those things that you have to make your own judgments about once you watch it.",1133481600,4,1172,4.064935064935065
1513893,1,B00005JM7T,"Back in 1953, Dr. Seuss (a pseudonym for Theodore Geisel, author of several successful children's books) wrote the screenplay for THE 5,000 FINGERS OF DR. T, a wildly inventive live-action family film. Unfortunately, it was such a box-office flop that the good doctor tended to avoid the subject in subsequent interviews, and turned his back on live-action movie adaptations of his stories for the remainder of his career. Today THE 5,000 FINGERS OF DR. T is a highly-regarded cult classic, even moreso in the wake of the disastrous DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS (2000) and this dismal assault on Geisel's legacy, DR. SEUSS' THE CAT IN THE HAT, which has about as much relation to the original Seuss story as it does to any Victor Hugo novel.

The still-delightful Seuss tales are full of imagination and whimsical linguistics, attributes that the filmmakers apparently had no faith in, as they sacrificed tone and charm for a succession of loud jokes, smart-alecky quips, and violent sight gags. Sadly, this isn't likely to be Hollywood's last rape of Seuss' body of work, and I wouldn't be surprised to see either Adam Sandler in a big screen adaptation of DR.

Mike Meyers is a genius as usual, the kids are both excellent actors. The sets were great, I loved the colors.

Now, I see it.  The film is not only unfunny; it's criminally unfunny and some might call it offensive because of its awfully misguided gags.  Even kids hate it because its hopeless silliness, and their parents find it appalling because of offen suggested sexual nuances.

Mike Myers in prosthetics plays the Cat in the Hat, who visits the house of Little Girl Sally (Fanning) and Little Boy Conrad (Spencer Breslin, 'The Kid').  Sally is a girl who prefers thing in order while Conrad likes mischief-making.  Today is a rainy day, so now The Cat can teach them how to 'have fun.'

But how?  Within the short running time (barely exceeds 80 minutes), unrecognizable Mike Myers in cat's makeup plays every tricks on the house's spic-and-span interior decorations, which all turn messy.  And he thinks it's funny.  Funny, too for us, that he doesn't seem to think that this is exactly what is happening to his career.

The same goes to the adult actors -- Kelly Preston (who should deserve better roles) plays the kids' Mom as she was many times before.  She wants the house to be clean because her boss doesn't like any potentially dirty things (so, he even abhors handshaking ... ho-hum).  And Alec Baldwin is a 'handsome' neighbor who wants to marry her (she is a single mother).  And of course, he wants to get rid of the kids simply because the film needs an obligatory villain.

The only merit of the film is its production designs, which  perfectly fit in this fantasy.  The cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki ('And Your Mother Too' 'A Walk in the Cloud') gives the impeccable dream-like pastel-color touch to this fictional town where a cat can talk and a goldfish can speak.  If only they thought of a more decent story, or at least some funnier gags.

It is a wonder that among this costly confusion of tasteless, meaningless moments, the child actors can retain theit charms to some extent.  But the fact remains that it is a mess, a big, expensive mess which still collected more than $100 m in USA.  Well, what can I say?",1104710400,4,2283,4.666666666666667

After all it's a classic Dr. Suess story, brought to larger-than-life by Mike Myers, what's not to like?  Well, here's a partial list.

Our first introduction to the children the cat entertains involves watching the boy sled down the stairs of his home on a cookie sheet, doing no serious damage to the house or himself.  Remember, this isn't a cartoon kid doing it, but a real, live one.  Do you want your children to try sledding down stairs on a cookie sheet?

When the cat shows up he makes two neutering jokes in less than twenty minutes.  Your kids are bound to catch one of them.  Do you want to explain to your children what neutering is?

At one point, the cat and the kids are jumping on a couch.  The little girl says its like a circus, to which the cat replies, ""Without the drunken clowns with hepatitis.""  Do you want to explain to your children what hepatitis is?

Later, the cat is doing a parody of a cooking show and cuts the end off his tail.  He screams, ""Son of a *****.""  The explicative is beeped out, but he is clearly saying something that begins with a ""B.""  Do you want to explain to your children what he is saying?

Interspersed in the cat's routines are snatches of effeminate gay-man stereotypes.  Do stereotypes of any sort have a place in modern children's movies?  Do you want your children imitating gay-man stereotypes?

If you've read these quetions I've listed and thought, ""That's no big deal.""  By all means, go rent ""Cat in the Hat"" and heaven help you.  Otherwise, forget this travesty and get the original 1971 cartoon with Alan Sherman, a true children's classic with no neutering jokes, deleted explicatives or hurtful stereotypes.",1104105600,25,1848,4.506024096385542

I mean, for one thing they have such a VERY materialistic interpretation of Dr. Seuss' artistic vision. I seem to recall his characters being realistic, and his view of things surreal, yet capturing reality fairly well. And the kids in the story were like REAL kids, not Holloywoodish pretty-faced children.

Mike Myers is a brilliant character actor; there can be no argument there. (Frankly, I don't find him to be at all funny however.) But, his take on the Cat in the Hat character is, well, disturbing. It's like watching a VERY adult comedy making fun of kids' films. And ADULT is how I would describe it, as there is an awful lot of (strange, and disturbing) sexual humor here. It seems to me like this film is a complete bastardization of Seuss. Despite what critics think, I'd recommend watching Jim Carrey's brilliant performance in ""the Grinch"" before watching this flop. (Not that it was such a good film either.)

The DVD design here is kinda cheap. They tried to add some nice features, but it all seemed trashy to me. And there's an awful lot of junk you gotta get through to even get to the film itself. Yuck.",1102896000,8,1239,4.551569506726457

Not only does he play the perfect Grinch, if he knows the movie is aimed towards a children audience, he will not do certain things in a movie. He will refuse to do so. The Grinch was lengthened a bit, but I loved it, and they kept to the book in some of the scenes, which is also admirable.

And his big striped hat

He meets a brat

The sister rats

As pesky as a gnat

They want him to scat

But the house goes splat

And that was that

So much for the cat

And his silly hat

For anyone who loves Dr. Seuss this silly movie brings the book to life in full blown color and lots of action. Director Bo Welch has captured the essence of a perfect little cartoon town with great vibrant colors, lots of lime green, orange and pinks, and an entire world that looks unreal as something that only exists in the best of imaginations.

The cast in this fun family film is wonderful with Mike Myers grabbing the spotlight as the infamous Cat in the Hat and he does a marvelous job in this role despite some repetition with his characters from the Austin Powers movies. Dakota Fanning is the perfect little child and nicely contrasts her hyper-active brother played by Spenser Breslin. Kelly Preston is the ideal cartoon mom with not a hair out of place despite all the chaos she encounters. Alec Baldwin is surprisingly funny in his role as the scheming neighbor bent on seducing the innocent mom next door. Sean Hayes (as Mr. Humberfloob) and Amy Hill (as Mrs. Kwan) offer additional hilarities in their small supporting roles.

Right down to the tail movements, mannerisms, voice, and the famous ""He'll moidalize me"" in the deleted scenes.  (Good thing it ended up there too, 'cause that would've put me over the edge.)

1514112,5,B00005JM7T,"Yes, this movie is as bad as it is reputed to be.  Like one movie critic says, ""This cat is a dog.""  The elegant cat in Dr Seuss's book is now an obnoxious, offensive character who does every stupid act known to TV history to get a cheap laugh.  So why am I allowing my kids to watch it?  Because I remember when I was young, I watched some dumb show that made me laugh non-stop, until my parents took it away.  It was worthless, they said.  It was; people were throwing pies into each other's faces.  For some reason, that just tickled my little mind and I laughed until my side hurt.  I saw the same show when I was older and could not believe I laughed at such moronic jokes.

I knew my kids would love this show, so against my husband's bidding, I let my 5 and 3 year old watch Mike Myer's performance.  They loved it!  My 5 year old son squealed in delight throughout the show.  Then he watched it again and again, more than he did Finding Nemo, Monster Inc, or any other kids movie I got him.  He also knows the original book by heart, but as I expected, this dumb movie just tickled his brain perfectly.  He rewound the part about the Cat cutting off its tail so many times I lost count.  I have other new cartoons waiting for him to watch, but he just wants to rewatch the Cat movie.  I think this movie is stupid and not funny and has inappropriate adult content (none that kids can understand), but it is doing the best job at making my kids laugh, so I feel like I have to give it a good rating.",1100044800,4,1506,4.088737201365188
1514113,2,B00005JM7T,"If you thought that film production companies such as Dream Works, Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment would be able to transform a $109-million budget, an all-star cast and a very famous Dr. Seuss (a.k.a. Theodor S. Geisel, 1904-1991) children's book into a hit film in 2003, you were mistaken.  Instead, the film production of ""The Cat in the Hat"", starring Mike Myers and Alec Baldwin and directed by Bo Welch, was a box-office disaster of epic proportions: earning a paltry $38-million in gross U.S. box-office receipts.  In spite of the lavish sets, costumes and special effects done in a myriad of bright, pastel colors and superb makeup that visually transformed Mike Myers into Seuss's infamous cat, the dialog, acting and side plot utterly failed to inspire, engage, entertain or capture the imaginations of the audience.  Except for a scant number of infrequent jokes that inspired brief responses of laughter, the majority of the film's 82 minutes are dry, humorless and dull.

The film begins in a Seuss-inspired township of imaginative colors and architecture in the real estate firm owned by Mr. Humberfloob (Sean Hayes, better known for his portrayal of Jack in the ongoing TV sitcom of ""Will & Grace""), who suffers from an obsessive-compulsive disorder.  Though intended to be funny, Mr. Humberfloob's yelling is merely annoying.  Working for him is the mother (Kelly Preston) of the two children that will soon be visited by Mike Myer's vision of Seuss's cat.  While being babysat by the overly drowsy Mrs. Kwan (Amy Hill), the children, the disobedient Conrad (Spencer Breslin) and the peremptory Sally (Dakota Fanning), are visited mysteriously by Mike Myers as the Cat in the Hat.  Not having been engaged by any of the characters thus far, Mike Myers arrival is disappointing as he proceeds to vapidly attempt to humor the children out of their boredom and bad behavior.  The most interesting characters, Thing One (Danielle Chuchran & Taylor Rice) and Thing Two (Brittany Oaks & Talia-Lynn Prairie), are by far the most entertaining characters in the film.  Alec Baldwin as the mother's would-be suitor/neighbor named Quinn (a product of poetic license), is often offensive and utterly humorless.

Though the cinematography and special effects are quite good, these alone could not save this film's inability to be in any way entertaining.  It is conceivable that Jim Carrey (who did an excellent job of playing Seuss's grinch in the 2000 ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"") would have been better able to portray the Cat in the Hat as compared to Mike Myers, but that is something that will probably never be known.  Sadly, the best that I can rate the 2003 film version of ""The Cat in the Hat"" is 2 out of 5 stars.  My only advice to anyone wanting to know the actual story is to read Dr. Seuss's original 1957 book with its original illustrations.",1099958400,3,2879,4.99581589958159
1514114,2,B00005JM7T,"This is a terrible adaptation of a great witty (grammar) children book.  Not much of this movie really try to inspired to use any of Dr. Seuss' original concepts or contexts except for the fine graphic and bizarre scenes.  The movie seems to be more inspired by Tim Burton's works then from the late Dr. Seuss.  Aside from the original Dr. Seuss comparison this is an uneventfully boring movie, almost pointless at time.

This could be Mike Myers worst bringing, in which his performance/character as the ""Cat"" was unbearably annoying and less sophisticated then the book character. Making this is a typical overacting Hollywood's flick, being very eccentrics with lots of hollering and screaming.

For the kids:

I would let young children read the real book before watching this movie and then having to example any similarities between them. (Dr. Seuss' work was inspired by hidden political satire of war) The scenes were very bright and colorful though, which kids do like.  Some of the contents of this film weren't even focus toward very young children at all.  ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" was more entertaining and relevant to Dr. Seuss' ideas.  The Crate's scene at the end of the movie, in which the house was morphing into a trippy environment, had a lot of potential. It was tipping on the iceberg of what I was expecting this movie to actually be throughout.

I guest it is really hard to transform a 5-15 min. children book into a 82 min. bad Hollywood's comedy, though this movie fell miserably.",1099958400,,1515,4.837209302325581

1514207,3,B00005JM7T,"Oh, where to start.  No surprises here - this is a flick that will do anything for a kid's laugh, even if that means it will send Seussians into a frenzy, or have Seuss himself doing 360's in his grave.  Let's get the bad out of the way - this flick is simplistic, goes for the easy laugh, relies heavily on expensive production and special effects and makes no attempt to build on the magic of the story and milks it dry.  Worse, it doesn't even use the extended length of what was originally a story you could read in a few minutes to develop its own magic.

That said (and now that we know we're not going to see Seuss get his due), ""Cat"" is still fun.  If unsurprising, it manages to satisfy.  Everybody knows the story - Conrad and Sally, brother and sister, are waiting out a rainy day at home when (for no reason, and without any explanation) the cat appears and begins to tear up the house for laughs.  Soon the cat enlists the aid of Thing #1 and Thing #2.  The movie stretches things out - Conrad (who was the nameless narrator of the story - the cat can never get his name right here in one of the movie's running jokes) is a rascal who never does what he's supposed to; Sally is a control freak and compulsively complies with rules (she envies Conrad who has more rules than she does).  Their mother (played by the lovely Kelly Preston) will be hosting a party at home for her boss - a real estate super-agent with a Seussian name and a nasty obsession for sanitary hands.  Meanwhile, a sinister neighbor (Alec Baldwin) with an eye on Mom, conspires to get Conrad into a military school in order to remove an obstacle between himself and mom.  Obviously, the cat will teach the kids to find the happy medium of spontaneous fun of less-than-mass-destruction, while thwarting the evil Baldwin character.  Meyers plays the cat as a mix of his ""Coffee Talk"" lady and a more jovial version of Burt Lahr's ""Cowardly Lion"".  Meyers is irrepressible as the Cat, and if he misses the story's, he captures the movie's conceit, which is well aware of how short it falls from the original (Myers's cat kicks things off once Conrad and Sally sign a bunch of legal waivers; the cat also never goes anywhere without his magical, time-traveling elves, a trio of uptight suits who only look like lawyers; Myers also proves rather limited in the rhyme department).

Dedicated Seussians aside, it could have been a lot worse - preachy, treacly or simply infantile like some extended Nickelodeon cartoon - ""Cat"" has decent laughs and won't put you to sleep like more acceptable kiddie fair.  Warning though, this flick more closely straddles the line of good taste than other kid-flicks - with several near utterances of not-ready-for Niktoons dialog and plenty of double-entendres which will have you thinking ""isn't this supposed to be a kids' movie?"" (not to mention Myers as plumber, complete with sagging hip-hugger jeans), but I doubt most kids will pick up on them.  I took my 4 and 6 year olders to see it and we all had a ball.  On the other hand, I've finally found a kids flick I can enjoy as much as my kids do (even if the enjoyment ain't that great).  In short, if you are a true devotee of Suess, you'll probably want to stick clear of this flick (catch ""Return of the King"" instead, if accuracy and loyalty are your creeds).

Of course not every movie is made for every adult or kid, so some people aren't going to like it.  This movie was meant to be simple, as the book was.  Read the book, simplicity was what Dr. Seuss' books were all about.  Simple but with moral.  This story teaches lessons for those who bother to pay attention to the story, instead of complaining about it.  It teaches children not to be a stuck up tattle tale, or a rule breaker.  The two children in this movie learn a lesson in a fun and entertaining way, and that's important.  It also teaches adults that career's are important, yes, but not more important than your children.  Every parent needs to spend time with their child, and every childs behaviour is a reflection of the parent.  It teaches these lessons in a simple way as to ensure young children to not get confused or bored with the movie.  It also does this so that anyone of any age can enjoy it.  Granted, most teenagers aren't going to enjoy this movie as much as young children and adults.  Although the use of adult jokes through out the movie will maintain any mature audience.  These jokes are always above kids heads, and never so bad that a child shouldn't watch.  If your young child understands these jokes at a young age...you need to ask YOURSELF why.  While making the jokes targeted towards adults, the cat keeps children visual stimulated, and laughing.  No harm done.  I think the people that get so upset with this movie are the people who have become dependant on special effects, drastic plot lines of no importance, and of the television raising their children while they aren't paying attention.  This is a movie to be enjoyed by the whole family together.

If you'r ready to watch tv as a family and you, the adult, maintain a intellectual level, you will see the value of this movie...and what a jem it really is.

1514301,3,B00005JM7T,"To begin with, there are a lot of people out there who have taken this movie way too seriously. THE CAT IN THE HAT is based/inspired by the beloved children's story by Dr. Seuss. The original book has 72 pages that are mostly illustrations. That's not much source material for a movie, even if it is supposed to be a children's movie. So, the filmmakers expanded the Cat's universe, making it more lively, but in a very unrealistic and cartoony fashion. The movie isn't going to make total sense; it's not supposed to. It's based off a Dr. Seuss book, for Pete's sake.

The story revolves around a sister and brother, Sally and Conrad, who are driving their poor single Mom insane with their unruly behavior. Their mother warns them that they better not get in trouble and to keep the house clean as she leaves the house. She loves her children, but is it too much to ask that they not fight and keep the house clean for once? But, while Mom is away, the Cat will play. Sally, Conrad, and Cat find out that this guy named Quinn who kind of likes their Mom is actually not what he appears to be. So the trio sets forth on a mission to keep Quinn from proposing to Mom.

Mike Myers is a comical genius and perfectly captures the sprite-like nature of Cat. Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin are also well cast as Sally and Conrad. Other than that, there really aren't any other notable acting performances except Paris Hilton's brief cameo.

As for as movies go, THE CAT IN THE HAT is a disappointment. The characters could have been so much more interesting and the story more developed. Instead, the movie feels like watching a bunch of beautifully painted pictures pasted together to try to tell a story. Of course, that didn't bother me as much as all the innuendo that is in the movie. This is supposed to be a children's movie, but instead comes off being more like a PG-13 teen comedy. I can forgive the underdeveloped story and characters, but not the implied sexual references. It's just not right.

1514303,1,B00005JM7T,"Perhaps with ""Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat,"" we can finally declare an official moratorium on any future live-action film adaptations of that beloved author's classic work.  This is an even more egregious fiasco than the earlier ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"" the film that stands, shockingly and inexplicably, as the box office champion of 2000.  (Oh well, at least ""The Cat in the Hat"" didn't emerge as the highest-grossing film of 2003. We should at least be grateful for small favors, I guess).

Mike Myers embarrasses himself to no end playing the crazed feline who bursts into the lives of two bored youngsters one dull rainy afternoon.  Myers' interpretation of the cat seems to derive its inspiration from the Charles Nelson Reilly school of lowbrow comedy. Though the film borrows the basic premise from the book, the screenplay and direction do everything possible to violate the spirit of the source, replacing the original's cleverness, subtlety and literary wit with manic pacing, unctuous caricatures, and foul, inappropriately sexual and scatological humor.  The film's production design is indeed a wonder to behold, capturing the parti-colored splendor of the original book's illustrations to a tee.  This is not, however, the case with the bizarre and repulsive suit the costume designers have fashioned for Meyers to inhabit.  Indeed, the only thing saving Myers from total embarrassment here is the fact that the mask he's been forced to don at least hides his identity to some meager extent (poor Alec Baldwin, as a particularly obnoxious secondary character, is given no such protective covering to hide HIS understandably reddened face behind).

Unlike the classic tale on which it is based, ""The Cat in the Hat"" is a soulless, joyless enterprise that will depress generations of children to come as well as the bewildered adults who will be joining them in the experience.  Really, who of any age wants to look at a cat's naked posterior or Baldwin's prosthetic beer belly, both of which are given ample and merciless display here?

1514358,1,B00005JM7T,"I'm usually not the type of person who lashes out at film versions of books, plays, what have you, when they are altered from their original text (I cringe when I read such phrases as ""Broadway musicals mucked up by Hollywood""), as if the originals were sacred. They are adaptations of those works, and thus entities into themselves. But with this unnecessarily complicated film of the simple, endearing Dr. Seuss classic, there's nothing to do here but complain. Why they would adapt a children's book that takes less than 10 minutes to read to a child into an 82-minute feature is beyond me.

There is literally nothing at all good about this movie. Not a single thing whatsoever. Mike Myers plays the cat as if he were someone's oafish, annoying uncle from Queens doing a botched magic act. He often reverts to variations on his old SNL schticks to keep things from going downhill and fails miserably.

The script, if it could be called such, clogs up the film's simple message of mixing fun with caution with an unnecessary subplot. Alec Baldwin's character of a loutish, hateful suitor to the children's mother wants to send the boy (the decidedly un-cute Spencer Breslin) to military school. After seeing the way the kids act in this film, he may be right, but the subplot could have been cut.

Many of the other new characters are just window dressing. Talented character actress Amy Hill is wasted as a fat, narcoleptic Taiwanese babysitter does absolutely nothing at all. Sean Hayes (who ruins everything he's in) is there as the mother's boss only to suggest that Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is innately funny. As the voice of the goldfish, Hayes provides no charm or humor, just yelling and screaming.

For an alleged family film, this production is unbelievably vulgar and obscene. There is a sequence in a rave, of all places, and who else makes a cameo but amateur filmmaker (to use a polite phrase) Paris Hilton.

First-time director Bo Welch has no sense of comic timing or pacing whatsoever, and for a film that plays as if it were on fast forward, it seems awfully long. Considering his production design background, one would think he'd use colors other than purple, green, and orange for the hideous, expensive sets.

Do not, under any circumstances, view this vile, crass, obscene, offensive, annoying film in any way shape or form. For a better audiovisual adaptation of Dr. Seuss' feline, pick up the charming 1971 TV cartoon on DVD instead.",1093046400,9,2466,4.859523809523809

 Of COURSE it takes liberties with Seuss's book. Hel-loooo? Can you make a 70-page kids' book into a feature-length movie without adding some extra material and character development? If Universal had found a way to strictly adhere to the book, and had avoided giving the picture any personality of its own, 95% of us would've snoozed right through it.

 To those of you who think Mike Myers overplayed the eponymous cat, I say, ""Did you hang out at the snackbar too long?"". Myers delivers many of the best lines in a soft, bashful way that contrasts wonderfully with the movie's general looniness.

 One thing, though-- Mike Myers has made this *his* movie, so don't expect the nice, clean movie short from years ago. Rather, think of this film as a 90-minute series of little fart jokes, all wound up, stretched, folded, spindled, mutilated and spewed all over your nice clean walls to make one BIG fart joke (think of the old show ""Double Dare"" on acid).

 Kids might not get all the jokes in this movie, but those they will get are tasteless, silly, occasionally unwholesome-- and a HECK of a lot of fun.",1090454400,2,685,4.3700787401574805

1514462,2,B00005JM7T,"The idea that Mike Meyers was going to play the title character in ""The Cat in the Hat"" certainly sounded like a good idea and the makeup job is pretty good, but as soon as he shows up in this 2003 film and starts channeling either Bert Lahr or Linda Richman (I am not sure which) for some reason you get a bad feeling.  When you add an inane subplot involving Alec Baldwin as a neighbor with plans for the mom (Kelly Preston) of precocious kids Conrad (Spencer Breslin) and Sally (Dakota Fanning), that bad feeling only grows and then comes the point where you realize that this film is just not funny and that is game, set, match for one of the most disappointing children's films ever made.
There are some good points to the film.  Redoing the Dreamworks bit at the start of the movie in the illustration style of Dr. Seuss was a nice touch and the production design by Alex McDowell(currently working on ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"") is in keeping with the spirit of the beloved author and his cherished book.  But then people start showing up and talking, at which point your mind is consumed with visions of frantic grave spinning.  Adults love the book too and our fond memories of reading it for the first gazillion couple of times is what draws us here, not the promise of adult humor directed narrowly above the heads of the small fry.
I am not really all that concerned with how much of the blame has to do with Meyers and his presence, both in terms of ad libs and writing to his peculiar style of humor, and how much is because screenwriters Alec Berg, David Mandel, and Jeff Schaffer were trying to expand the story to fill up a great big movie like this one.  The added sibling rivalry element is fine (he is compulsively messing up and she is a control freak), but letting Baldwin run around and be annoying was a big mistake while the bits with mom's job and the baby sitter were both unnecessary.  The original story of ""The Cat in the Hat"" was about what happened between two kids and the Cat in the Hat while their mother was not about.  There was an irate fish and the troublemaking twins Thing 1 and Thing 2, but that was it and if the people making this movie could not make it work with those characters then tossing in this other nonsense was not going to help.
The humor represented by what Baldwin's Quinn does and what happens to the babysitter Mrs. Kwan (Amy Hill) are both way beyond the pale.  Dr. Seuss did not do potty jokes nor was he malicious.  Theodore Geisel was creative and imaginative, while those responsible for this travesty are woefully bereft of those qualities.  Dr. Seuss wrote stories to inspire children to read and here the goal is to make money (certainly they made a lot less than they thought they would: the film cost $109 million and grossed only $100 million domestically).  I would want to draw some lesson for future reference having to do with never trying to turn Dr. Seuss into anything more than a half-hour television program and not a bloated 82-minute constrosity, but we all know that Hollywood is slow to learn anything.  Apparently there are some people not even Dr. Seuss can teach.",1087948800,11,3159,4.493891797556719

One of my biggest problems with the dvd, is that the trailers, before the trailers, a message comign up that you can skip foward to the menu, and I have tried how many times, and I can not do that. In 2000, we had How the Grinch Stole Christmas, with Jim Carrey hiting behind a lot of make up, and now we Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat, with Mike Myers now hiding behind a lot of make up.

1514467,3,B00005JM7T,"Here I am again, trying to explain why I rented a movie made from a book.  Against my better judgement I have seen three such films this year and every time I have been disappointed.  You'd think I would have learned something by now, but hope does spring eternal.  On the other hand, you'd think that Hollywood would have learned that just because you *can* make a movie, doesn't mean that you should.
The book Cat in the Hat by Dr. Seuss is a true children's classic about a brother and sister who start one rainy day alone and bored, only to find an unexpected adventure with a tall cat who comes knocking at their door.  This cat is full of magical tricks and surprises, but the children soon learn that there is a price to be paid for all the fun; the house is a wreck and mom is coming home soon.  How can they fix everything in time?
The movie Cat in the Hat takes a very liberal interpretation of the delightful children's book.  As a matter of fact, it hardly resembles the book at all.  In order to stretch a small rhyming picture book into an hour and a half movie, the screenwriters had to distort the original story, add several characters and subplotlines and entierely do away with anything that resembled the original.  The preview clips that advertised TCITH in theaters made it seem as if the movie kept true to Dr. Seuss' book, but that's just not true.  Even the rhyming verse is edited and stretched out to fit.  You can't improve upon perfection, only ruin it.  Couldn't they have left that alone, at least?
I do have some good things to say about the actors involved.  Mike Myers, who plays the Cat, did the best possible job that could have been done with the role he had to work with here.  I have always admired his comedy and he does have some good moments as the Cat.  The little girl who plays Sally is absolutely precious; both kids are good actors, in my opinion.  There's a lot to be said for the valiant attempts at set design and art direction in this film as well.  It can't be easy to translate Seuss's weird, wild style into a three dimensional world for film, but the result kept the feeling of the book's artwork reasonably well despite that challenge.
If you have kids that are just dying to see this movie because they love the book and can't imagine that it would disappoint them, this could be a good object lesson for them.  It is a harmless way to kill an hour and a half.  There was nothing really objectionable in TCITH other than overall mediocrity.  Otherwise I can't find a good reason to recommend this movie to anybody.

I waited until the movie came out on VHS a couple of days before renting this movie and I have to say, the movie was very disappointing. Seemingly made for the kiddies, it seems to me that directors simply didn't have a break through or an eye opener during the making of this movie. The graphics aren't utilized to its extent, rather, just to add a little extra to the movie. Its like old classic Chinese fighting series where they first grasp the technology. An mere experiment, nothing serious. A movie which should have went straight to VHS and didn't deserve the spotlights of the theater.
The plot was way too straight forward and predictable, therefore making it uninteresting. The Cat and the kids were just simply characterless in my opinion. The Cat being just goofy and annoying, while the kids seem like any other kids you've ever seen. Nothing what it should be, nothing really ""unique"" or much of an ""originality"" from the rest. The jokes played in the movie was very childish as well and appeals, therefore, to the younger audience in the most part.
What adds to the nightmare is the fact that the scenary wasn't well thought up of and things aren't nearly as creative as ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"".

(I tried to come up with a better word than ""stupid"" but I couldn't) This is definitely not The Cat in the Hat that we knew as children. Since when did he start blatantly referencing the words S.H._.T, B_TCH and _SS? Or show someone get hit in the b_lls and a dog p_ss on a sandwich? Ok for some comedy movies but gave me a bad feeling in this one. I guess I should have set my expectations a little more in accordance with the PG-13 rating of the movie and not the G rating of the book.",1081814400,5,870,4.093567251461988

1514655,3,B00005JM7T,"""The Cat In The Hat"" feature film is really just a platform for Mike Myers to dress up and get goofy. The biggest problem I have with this film, is that not only are there naughty jokes for adults, but they are jokes that kids understand. Disney is good about putting jokes in their films that adults will laugh at and kids won't understand. Jokes parents will take offense to are the cat calling a rake ""a dirty hoe"" and than kissing it, the cat cutting off his tale and than begining to yell the B word which gets bleeped, and the cat singing about being neutered. Small children won't understand the jokes, but when the kid turns 8, you should stop letting them watch it untill they are 13. The storyline is that one day when Sally and Comrade's mom leaves them with a sleeping babysitter, a mysterious talking cat with his magic hat comes to teach them what being a kid is all about. There isn't actually enough story to fill 90 minutes. The film is basically joke after joke after joke.
This DVD release is very good. The behind the scenes footage isn't as indepth as I would like it to be, but it is enough to let you know how they made the movie. I am surprised to find that Universal didn't go the Disney route with this DVD and add a ton of games. There is only one special feature that kids will want to do, and that is the learn to dance like the cat feature. The deleted scenes are nice, and some of them include early special effects. A decent DVD.
The best part about this movie is Thing 1 and Thing 2. They are wacky and hilarious. This movie isn't sutible for every member of the family, and parents with kids who repeat everything they hear should not let their kids watch ""The Cat In The Hat.""",1081641600,4,1711,4.2676923076923075

Ironically, it was all this negative press that made me want to watch this film, so my daughter and I made a night out of it and watched.  This is one of those Hollywood goof ups that comes along once in awhile.  These are the kinds of movies I live for.  It was obviously intended to be a film aimed at kids, but ends up being more bizarre and disturbing than intended(or was it intended?) much like The Garbage Pail Kids movie or Return To Oz.  The movie is a total overdose of utter zaniness and the bizarre.  In fact, the onlsaught may be too overwhelming for some adults.  Mark my words, this has ""cult film"" written all over it.  Years from now(if not already), this film will achieve a cult following for those into whacked out movies.  I promise.  To all the conservative parents whining about how ""crude"" and ""Inappropriate"" some of the jokes are-Lighten up a bit.  These suggestive themes are shot out so fast that only adults are gonna pick up on them.  Really, they'll fly over your kids' heads, coz they'll be preoccupied with the physical comedy and the overall look of the film.  After viewing, my daughter had no desire to go to a rave, hit on Paris Hilton, call a hoe a ""ho"", use profanity or whack a guy in the groin with a baseball bat.  Your kids are safe, lighten up a bit.  And if you're kids are old enough to get these jokes, then I'd hope they'd be mature enough to handle them and laugh at them.  I mean, it's not Andrew Dice Clay or anything.  To Dr. Suess fans, I agree with the other reviewers and suggest you stay away.  I hate it when Hollywood butchers a book I like(Hannibal comes to mind), and this is no exception.  But if you like just flat out bizarre stuff, check this out.  Regardless of complaints, this movie is actually very funny, very witty.  Especially a scene where the Cat spoofs that lame informercial show, Amazing Discoveries, that used to be on every morning at 5 a.m.(almost always the same episode with that crazy English guy trying to sell that magic car rejuvination wax or Jack Lelane and his Juice Tiger).

The sets and costumes are pretty good, but that's about it. The best character was the fish, but we only get to see him occasionally.
The crude humor was entirely inappropriate for a film based on a Dr. Suess book and billed as a something for kids. Can't Mike Meyers at least try to be funny without resorting to toilet humor and innuendo?

I was even more excited when I heard one of my favorite actors, Mike Myers, would be playing the lead. I finally got a chance to see the movie tonight, and was absolutely dissopointed. I won't even bother comparing the movie to the book, as the two are completely seperate things.
As I said, Mike Myers is one of my favorite actors, and I've come to expect a lot of things from him. His role in this film wasn't one of them. This film wasn't at all what I expected. The two musical numbers were announced instead of spontaneous, as in THE GRINCH. The first was extremely corny while the second was definately not needed.
The humor of the movie also didn't agree with me. Although it has a PG rating, I wouldn't reccomend this film for anyone below the age of 16. The minor sub-plot with the Cat's lawyers was definately not necessary, and the two near-occurances of cussing were very uncalled for. Definately not needed for this film. I'm not a prudish person, but I do know the difference between crude and funny. This film was mostly crude and crass. I am just glad I didn't waste 8bucks at the theater watching it.
If you're a big fan of Dr. Seuss' book, I highly reccomend that you AVOI THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS!! I give it 2 stars only because the children (Fanning and Breslin) were terrific in their roles. Mike Myers - this was definately not your finest hour.",1080518400,,1515,4.3568904593639575

HOWEVER, I feel the Best audience for this flick is for those of us who are still kids inside.

Very little of the original children's book is quoted or shown through the movie, and alot of garbage was added in.  There are several blatant off color jokes through-out the movie such as the cat looking at the mother's photograph and it opening up like a playboy centerfold.  Mike Myer's performance is shoddy to say the least and the voice he uses for the cat is a combination of his SNL character Linda Richman (the ""Cawfee Tawlk"" lady) and the cowardly lion.  There is a whole subplot that involves Alec Baldwin as the mother's dead beat boyfriend that is ridiculous.

1. It's nothing like the book
2. It's no wear near as good as real live version of The Grinch
3. It's not for kids
If you want to let your kids watch this, it's better if the little ones watch How The Grinch Stole Christmas.  Now that's a good hearted family comedy.  Jim Carrey is great in that.  Mike Myer's is good in this too, but not as good as Jim Carrey.  Anyway, it's hard to decide if you want to buy this film, but rent it first if you haven't seen it, then make your decision.  It may be too crude for kids under 5.  Bad parts in this are like when the cat step on a garden ho and it wacks him in the face and he says ""Dirty ho.""  Also when he pretends to be the pinyada and he gets wacked in the balls and then it shows a girl cat swinging on a swing and another part is when he's going a cooking show and the cat cuts of his own tail and say ""SON OF A B!TCH.""

You've got great source material (which is admittedly tough to stretch to an hour and a half), two up-and-coming young actors in Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin, and of course, the very, very funny Mike Myers (sporting a great makeup job) as the mischievous Cat. Seemed like it couldn't fail, right? Well...
What a dreadful disappointment. Myers tries hard, and the kids are fun, but this film is just one tired cliche after another. It's silly and inane and insulting rather than funny. With very little to work with (the book was what? 2 dozen pages or so?) Myers has to improvise a great deal to fill in the gaps between set pieces. Sometimes he's funny, especially when he's referencing some of his prior work (Dr. Evil, Wayne's World) and parodying pop-culture figures. Problem is, some kids--even pop-culture savvy ones--may not catch some of his broad cultural references (though adults will) and that may leave them a little bored or restless. It's obvious when the material begins to run thin, because we are suddenly treated to potty humor and mild innuendo (nothing really bad, but is it really necessary?) and bombastic physical comedy--though the ""rocket car"" scenes were funny in an out-of-control, Roadrunner/Coyote kind of way. But far too many of the gags misfire, and the film seems to assume once too often that ""manic and frenzied"" equals ""funny."" Nope. The whimsy and humor of the original story is completely subverted here. What a waste of time, money, and talent.

The setting was wonderful. From the curvy trees, to Sally and Conrad's pretty-and-perfect mother, everything makes you feel like you've really landed in one of Dr. Seuss' books.
The story almost follows the book, with a few twists and turns placed inside. Mom goes out, cat comes in and recks the house. He takes out thing 1 and 2 to make matters worse. After all that he leaves the house a total wreck, with mom on the way back home. Just before she enters the house, the cat comes back and cleans up his mess.
The acting was so-so. I waited a long time for the cat to actually do something funny; and when he did it raised my laugh-meter up to 4% out of 10%. Dakota Fanning did a wonderful Sally, and so did ""Conrad"". Kelly didn't do to bad either, and Mr. Sean made a few funnny preformances (although his character reminds me alot of somebody in Finding Nemo...).
Overall, it's an O.K. movie. I would have given it 2 stars, but the imaginative and whimsicall setting raised that to a total of 3 stars. The only reason I like this movie is because of the fish.

The film, based on the classic, popular Dr. Suess book, has a brother and sister stuck inside their house, on a rainy day,  with nothing to do except being bored out of there minds (where's Stuart Little when you need him?). Thats about to change, however, when a larger than life cat, in a tall red and white striped hat, breezes through the front door and does everything in his magical powers to cheer both kids up and use their imagination for play, but, wind up getting into all sorts of trouble.
It sounds good, but, it isn't. Thats the main problem with this film. It should have never been made, becuase, what looks and sounds good in print, usually, doesn't translate well to the big screen (there are, of course, some exceptions - ""Lord of the Rings"", anyone?). The movie expands from the book, and comes up uneven (something about a crate that the kids aren't supposed to open.

Are you beginning to get the picture?  Is your skin crawling yet? Poor Ted Geisel, he must be spinning in his grave like a rotisserie chicken.  Why don't they just dig up the body and let the producers molest his skeleton? That would be faster and cheaper, and we wouldn't have to take our kids to see it. This is what comes of trying to make a cartoon without cartoonists.  What's next?: CAP'N CRUNCH: THE MOVIE starring Brendan Fraser as Jean LaFoote?",1077753600,24,1256,4.626126126126126

So don't think this movie will help save the day.
What a mess! What a shame that's it's come down to this,
A gigantic hairball! A huge movie miss!
I thought for a moment it was Powers in drag.
Though not in a dress. In a cat suitish bag!
Or maybe a remake of THE WIZARD OF OZ?
The Cowardly Lion in kitty cat paws?
No! No! It's just rubbish, the worst of the sort!
To take a great classic and its story abort.
And replace it with nonsense that just doesn't fly.
If Seuss were still here I am sure he would die.
His story, his concepts all blasted...oh well,
Into small smithereens. It won't work. It won't sell!
I guess that some think that they'll just tag the title
To a movie so bad that it's up in the nightle!
Oh, yes, they made money but in the end, it is true,
They just couldn't fool us, not me and not you!
Just read the book to the kiddies, indeed.
Just watch the cartoons that this movie exceed.
Just forget about this one and hope there won't be
More movies like this that we won't have to see.

1514935,3,B00005JM7T,"I actually can't say I hate the movie. I guess I respect the effort that film-makers put into movies too much to really hate any movie. The Cat in the Hat is colorful and full of energy... a little too much energy though. I don't really think guys like Mike Myers or Jim Carrey are the right guys to play Dr. Seuss' characters. I mean I always thought of the characters as classy and Jim Carrey and Mike Myers made them hyper-active and rauncy. Still I like the look of the films and they do manage to have some imagination to them. It's just that they have so much energy and the story is so much all over the place that they wear out the viewer by the time they're over.
  When you think about it, the cat in the hat is just teaching the kids in the movie what not to do. I don't know if real kids pick up on that lesson from it though.  The movie spends too much time making the bad things he does look fun. The kids that were in the theatre with me seemed to love it but still you're better off putting the animated one on for them. As for me, I expected to hate the movie but I found it to be a lot more watchable than it has been made out to be. Only problem is that I don't really know what audience to recommend it to. I recommend it to Universal to let Dr. Seuss' rest in peace though and not  make Daisy Head Masey or Green Eggs and Ham lol.",1076630400,6,1351,3.9558823529411766
1514936,1,B00005JM7T,"This movie is incredibly awful!! Mike Myers who is one of my favorite comedy actors really dropped the ball on this one. No offense to him but his acting in this movie comes off as obnoxious and completely unfunny.
 I found nothing funny about this movie by any stretch of the imagination and there is nothing that bonus features could do to save this garbage from falling into utter ruin!
 Dr. Seuss is likely rolling in his grave right now over this mess and if there is to be a sequel to this pathetic excuse for a movie, then may God help us all!
 Do not buy this movie and do not let kids watch this either because it is NOT kids movie material with the nauseating toilet humor that is all over this movie plus it's incredibly short being less than 90 minutes but even then, it's long enough to leave you scarred for a long time.
 Just utterly stupid and classless. Throw this movie into the garbage can and with full force!",1076198400,17,929,4.32183908045977
1514937,1,B00005JM7T,"The Cat in the Hat movie was an attempt to stretch a 20 page Dr. Seuss book with 4 rhymeing words on each page into an hour and 15 minutes long movie. I wouldn't say it was a successful attempt either...
(...)The movie had some redeeming qualities by adding little Seussian reminders here and there, but it was basically a bad movie, or a very long, and good commercial.
Throughout the movie, there was plenty of product placements (Honda Insights), and advertizements for all kinds of Universal Studios stuff. Other movies like the Incredible Hulk had little cameos, and not to mention the cat flat out saying ""Like a ride at Universal Studios... Cha Ching."" and holding up Universal Tickets with their newest ride that opens next year, the Revenge of the mummy. Parts of the movie were also very reminicent of the Cat in the Hat ride at Islands of Adventure.
Like in the book, when the mother comes back in the boy says ""Should we tell her about it? What would you do if your mother asked you?"" I wouldn't tell your mother about this movie. Unless your mother is a big fan of Universal Studios. I don't think Ted Geisel, or his mother would approve of the movie either...",1074988800,9,1173,4.537735849056604

I watched this movie 20 times, and then I kept watching it. I couldn't stop. I've come to realize that this isn't just some simple children's film. This has layers. Every new viewing is a new experience, a new reveal of understanding of what this film is trying to say. The worldbuilding is fascinating, and by turns terrifying. The shot composition is like Jodorowsky without limits. The humor is avant garde. To watch The Cat in the Hat is to feel like going insane. Trust me--I've been there!

It's funny what a film can do to a man when he's had to watch and study it 32 times over 15 months. He develops a sense of comfort. Of belonging. This is the film the world needs now.

Kids loved it.",1522454400,2,832,4.2594936708860756

He legitimately loves this movie, and I kind of worry for his mental health. This film, along with The Love Guru are clearly the reasons Mike Myers consigned himself to semi-retirement. The only thing that redeemed it enough for a 2nd star is the fun that I had watching it with Hawk and making fun of it, and it isn't quite as insulting to the legacy of Dr. Seuss' work as the abominations Illumination Entertainment has been churning out.",1522454400,,617,4.282051282051282
