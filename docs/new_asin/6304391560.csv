7870845,5,6304391560,"I came across this documentary by chance, not long after seeing the ""Ghost and the Darkness"" on the big screen. I was in one of those video-rental chain stores, (coincidentally, with the friend who took me to see the movie) and this movie was in an ""employee's pics""-type section. We rented it, with no hesitation, as I had discredited the ""based on a true story"" intro. to the ""G&tD"", while my friend did not. This documentary erased whatever doubt may have lingered, while it also explained ""How?"", and ""Why?""-which is why it was so memorable to both of us. I have since read J. Patterson's book, ""The Man-Eaters of Tsavo"", which holds his first-hand account of the events which are put to life in the ""G&tD""... but the lions' history/background was covered best in this documentary. It's not ""Hollywood"", and one shouldn't expect it to be... however, it DOES document the reality behind the ""G&tD"", & shouldn't be overlooked!",997142400,18,928,4.8427672955974845
7870846,1,6304391560,"'The Ghost and the Darkness' fell way short of my expectations and I had hoped this documentary would do the subject justice. Unfortunately, 'Maneaters of Tsavo' sucks worse than 'The Ghost and the Darkness'. Every aspect of the production - the filming, narrration, editing, etc - is amateurish. Its like watching a home video of someones trip to Africa. And who cares what Val Kilmer and Michael Douglas have to say on the subject? They're just a couple of dopey actors. Just because they starred in and produced a crappy hollywood version of the story doesnt mean they're authorities on the subject. I also have my doubts about the 'veteran guides' and 'renowned experts' featured in the video. They offer no insight or revelation, as you might expect 'renowned' experts to do. Don't waste your time or money, theres no education to be had from this video. Its not even worth giving away. My copy is headed for the dumpster.",981763200,5,927,4.8
7870847,5,6304391560,"A great addition to your Kenyan Culture library.  File this next to your copy of ""Maneaters of Tsavo"" by Col. Patterson and the video ""The Ghost and the Darkness"".  This video includes interviews the Val Kilmer and Michael Douglas.  Follow a group of Tsavo explorers as they follow the footsteps of Col Patterson during the maneaters crisis.
I enjoyed this video very much.  A well done documentary.",973728000,12,399,4.91044776119403
7870848,5,6304391560,"This is a great companion to your ""The Ghost and The Darkness"" movie and a must for any Val Kilmer collection.
Here is the chance for you to learn the exciting true story behind Val Kilmer's ""The Ghost and The Darkness"" movie. This documentary revisits Col. John Patterson's account of the 2 lions responsible for the deaths of nearly 200 railway workers in Kenya. Interspersed within the documentary footage is an interview with Val Kilmer who talks about his travels to Africa, the legend behind the two lions, how he formed the character of John Patterson and the making of the film. Michael Douglas - the film's producer - is also interviewed for this documentary as is director Stephen Hopkins.",972691200,11,699,4.833333333333333
