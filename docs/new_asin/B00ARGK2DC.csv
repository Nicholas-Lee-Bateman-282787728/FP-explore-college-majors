Box Outlook: Glossy and Sturdy

Box Inside:
  The DVDs were inserted into cheap plastic (soft) covers, and then inserted into their individual pockets. The pockets were made out of cardboard and then simply glued to the main box. If you are going to watch the movies only once then it may be a good fit for you. However, I like to watch the movies over and over, and it was obvious to me that the cheap-guled-pocket for storage will not sustain repeated usage.

Seller: MovieTimeVideo

Final Outcome: Out of the disappointment of such a substandard product i decided to return it.",1409011200,,673,4.61344537815126
