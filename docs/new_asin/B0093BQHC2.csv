USA network has put out some of the best basic cable series over the last few years (in my opinion) and this is no exception.  The story is centered around Mary Shannon (played by Mary McCormack), who is a witness protection inspector in Albuquerque New Mexico.  Each episode contains a case of the week storyline, which pertains to some new witness (or witnesses) who need protecting, and the more arc driven storylines of her personal life.  That is mainly centered around her dysfunctional mother and sister, and the other agents in the Albuquerque office.

McCormack does a great job with her character, playing her harsh, cold and uncaring at times, yet the exact opposite at others.  All covered by a smart mouth and sarcastic wit.  Fredrick Weller plays her partner Marshal perfectly as well.  The two have great chemistry, and throughout the series it is implied and teased that he loves her, and she cares about him.  There is never an overt will they get together vibe, really ever, but to the extent there is one, it is resolved at the end.  The other story that plays out well throughout the series is dealing with her father, and the fact that he abandoned the family.  It is a story that goes through the entire series, and the resolution is done very well.

Ultimately, I think the series did a good job of not being too repetitive.  The case of the week aspect was always different enough not to get boring.  Characters evolved over time, and the show did not hang on past its prime.  I also think the fact that the seasons lasted 13 episodes from seasons 1-4 and 8 episodes the last season, kept it from getting flat.

As far as extras goes, they are pretty bare bones each season.  You pretty much get some deleted scenes, commentary and a gag reel in the first few seasons.  In the final 2 there were nothing.  It would have been nice to have some more behind the scenes material, and that is really the only place where they are lacking.  If you are a fan of smart, funny shows that blend drama and comedy well, check this one out.  You definitely want to price shop for the seasons vs bundles.",1371945600,10,2285,4.562653562653563

8535119,5,B0093BQHC2,"With strong men as supporting characters, the lead in this series is Mary, with a chip on her shoulder, more dysfunctional-family baggage that she can tolerate, and a job with which she has a serious love-hate relationship. The eye-rolls and snarky comments still make me howl out loud -- the cast does an incredible job. Unlike some law-enforcement shows where the actors and actresses are far to young for the position their character has attained, these characters have history and are rough around the edges showing they have all been around the block. Still my favorite and it's been off the air for over 2 years; friends at work hear about twice a month, ""I still miss 'In Plain Sight'."" This was so well-cast, the characters became part of the family over the 5 years we watched it. My favorite is Season 3 with Steven Weber. I was not a fan of his until his appearance during Season 3. Can't wait to re-watch all the episodes.",1417564800,4,934,4.632530120481928
