8697941,3,B00SB3I3RU,The dvds are not meant for playing in the US. You have to have a DVD player which allows you to change your region to where the dvds were produced. I can't play them on my current DVD player. I will have to wait till I can buy a more advanced player to watch them so I'm disappointed it isn't set to be usable here.,1494374400,,315,3.8615384615384616
