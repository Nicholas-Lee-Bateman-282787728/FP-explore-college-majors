7883960,3,6305131163,"With a scant running time of about 27 minutes, this stooge documentary tries to squeeze about 4 decades worth of material into less than half an hour--and I would say the end results are passable.

If you're looking for some rare stooges home movies, then the few clips shown throughout the family album might please you. If you're looking for rare clips or even not-so-rare clips of the stooges in action, you might be better off buying the Goodtimes release: The Three Stooges Story.

Although the Goodtimes release has more than a few factual errors in regards to dates of birth and dates of death--for the most part, the Goodtimes documentary is very solid and very informative. Most of the info provided here on the family album was info I was already privy to--so I guess what I'm trying to say is that this tape didn't shed any new light on the stooges. Plus, all the clips from actual stooge shorts are from the very familiar ""Public Domain"" films.

Also, the narrator of this tape implies that Curly suffered his first stroke during ""Half-Wits Holiday""--but ardent stooge fans will tell you that Curly started suffering his strokes long before the ""big one"" that disabled him during the filming of ""Holiday.""

It also would have been nice if a little more coverage of the Shemp years had been included.

I don't mean to sound like I'm totally slamming this tape. If you're a serious stooge fan, then it wouldn't hurt to have this in your collection--but as I eluded to earlier, there are much better Stooge documentaries out there.

7883961,3,6305131163,"This Stooge documentary had really great potential. It contained very fascinating home movies of the Stooges, and some rare photos. Yet it has really bad narration, goes out of its way to incorporate stock footage from the public domain Stooge shorts, and while it is mentioned that Emil Sitka was going to become ""The Last Stooge,"" it fails to mention that the idea was aborted.",1045612800,2,379,4.846153846153846
7883962,5,6305131163,"THE THREE STOOGES FAMILY ALBUM is a great documentary. It's even better than the A&E BIOGRPAHY of the Three Stooges. This has some rare clips of the Stooges at home and work. Plus, there are some stills from hard-to-find Stooge shorts (TRIPLE CROSSED, RUSTY ROMEOS). This is a great mini documentary for all Stooge fans. You can't be a fan of them until you see the ""real"" Stooges.",1014163200,4,381,4.617647058823529
7883963,5,6305131163,"Three Stooges Family Album is the best Three Stooges bio on video!  The  off-screen home-footage is not only fun but of  pristine quality, capturing  upbeat, funny moments of The Boys stooging around with their wives and  children.  Along with a reputation for taking their work seriously, these  clips show an innate sense of humor and unique chemistry as best buddies.  The final montage includes a quick clip of Curly mugging and squatting with  his britches down. Nyuk. Nyuk. Nyuk. Great show, Comedy Three!",969321600,6,511,5.0602409638554215
7883964,5,6305131163,Most of this tape consists of home movies that Moe took in the early thirties. It's a rare glimpse at what it was like to be a stooge. Lot's of footage of Shemp asnd their families. It's a must for any Stooge collector.,911347200,9,219,4.116279069767442
