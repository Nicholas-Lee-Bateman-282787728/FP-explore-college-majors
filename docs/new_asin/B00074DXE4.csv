8276307,5,B00074DXE4,"On a good system, this DVD plays with way more definition (visual) and fidelity (audio) than watching Youtube. Artistry is genius: performance is stellar: production is off the scale: God is GLORIFIED.  It's really like being there. Can't ask for a better worship experience other than to actually have been there. But this has to be in the running of the top live worship concerts anywhere, any time. One thing I wonder: the description says Region 1 US/CAN only, but ours isn't encoded. I wonder if because it was intended to ship worldwide, if this is incorrect and these DVDs all are really like ours, not region coded?",1354579200,,623,4.768518518518518
8276308,4,B00074DXE4,"I like both, Delirius? and Hillsong, so, this was a very good surprise for me.",1214956800,2,78,4.266666666666667
8276309,5,B00074DXE4,I can't say enough about the Spirit filled worship of Hillsong.  I have enjoyed watching and listening to it over and over again.  I highly recomend it for anyone who leads worship at their church.,1178928000,4,197,4.6
