8147864,5,B000IZJQDE,"I supplemented the reading of the book 4 Perfect Pebbles with Marion's Triumph.  It allowed my students to see the faces behind the story - to realize the human factor involved.  They were glued to the video as they couldn't wait to turn the page of the book.  We wrapped it all up with a personal visit by Marion.  An experience I will never forget, and I hope our students won't forget either.",1431648000,,395,4.36986301369863

8147866,5,B000IZJQDE,"All of Marion's books and videos need to be read and seen by all!  I teach 6th grade and her materials are so age appropriate.

Read and watch them now while Marion is living history.  Marion will respond to letters and emails.",1420934400,,227,4.357142857142857
8147867,5,B000IZJQDE,"Very well done.  We were glad this was available on DVD.  We had the opportunity to meet and hear Marion's presentation
this year and purchase her book.  Marion, her husband and family are truly remarkable.  We are so happy she is still
traveling and sharing her families experience.  Marion and I share the same date of birth except she is ten years older.
We highly recommend this DVD.  The younger generations need to realize how easily this could happen again.",1396656000,,464,4.7375
8147868,5,B000IZJQDE,"When I discovered Marion Blumenthal and her book, I was astounded to learn that her story so closely paralleld that of my uncle that I had to buy and read it immediately. It all happened a few years ago when I was doing research for information about my mother's brother, who, according to the Red Cross, had perished in Bergen Belsen, the notorious Nazi concentration camp in Celle, Germany. Marion and her family fled from Germany to Holland in 1938, just as my uncle did, only to end up in Bergen Belsen by way of the Dutch transit camp at Weterbork. But then I discovered that he had actually been removed from the camp and placed on a train that became known as the ""Phantom Transport"", along with 7500 other sick and dying prisoners, bound for the death camp at Theresienstadt  - all because the Nazis wanted to remove the evidence before the British discovered their atrocities. Ironically, Marion and her family were on the same death train that never arrived at its destination, but had meandered for two weeks trying to avoid the allies and bombed out railroad tracks. When the train reached the little village of Troebitz near Dresden, it could go no farther, and was liberated by the Russians and the towns people. But by then many of the prisoners had contracted Typhus in Bergen Belsen and had died along the way. Sadly, my uncle and Marion's father were beyond help, and both died of the disease shortly after they were liberated. But Marion, her brother and her mother survived, and since then she has dedicated her life to raising the awareness of school children and young adults by her speaking tours literally around the world. She is a fabulous woman and has written a small but wonderful book from her perspective as small child who somehow survived all the horrors while constantly being surrounded by death and despair. For anyone who is interested in Holocaust studies, this is a must read.",1328659200,2,1915,4.7164179104477615
8147869,5,B000IZJQDE,"A riviting story of a holocasut survivor.  Marion's story is one of triumph, hope and inspiration.  Related in her own words Marion tells the story of her internment in a Nazi concentraion camp and of her family's life and triumph after release from the camps. I would also recommend reading Marion's book ""Four Perfect Pebbles"".",1295740800,,329,4.963636363636364
8147870,5,B000IZJQDE,"This allows people young and old to understand how lives were affected during the holocaust. It has a tremendous impact without a lot of  graphic photos.  Children as young as 9 or 10 can watch with their parents or class to see the holocaust from a child's point of view, and hear how important it is to persevere and move on after a tragedy.  Remarkably powerful but gentle treatment of a horrifying part of history.",1223251200,2,418,4.546666666666667
8147871,5,B000IZJQDE,"Holocaust survivors, Marion, her brother, Albert, and their mother, Ruth, present with a beautiful resilience to the horrible life they managed to live to survive. One can picture/feel the pain/fear and miserable existence of the Jewish people as they were manipulated by the Nazis as if they were garbage that could be disposed of at a whim. I thought this was an excellent testimony which gives hope of victory over evil to a needy world today.
