8094573,4,B000BYW6W0,"On my shelf, Tolstoy and Bergman sit next to Edward Lee and Michael Bay.  I have a great affinity for trash, and nothing represents our violent, trash culture in all its low, voyeuristic, cruel totality than ""Queen of the Hood.""  This DVD is exactly what you'd expect it to be: in what appears to be the middle of nowhere, two women (some attractive, some rotund) battle it out in the dirt, while men circle them with videocameras and their friends shout from the sidelines.  Witness an obvious crackhead, who looks on the wrong side of eighty, get her head pounded in by one of the aforementioned rotund women.  Witness an Aryan chick giggling maniacally as she beats the snot out of a girl who looks like she wandered in from Suburbia.  Witness the hilarious sight of that big lady (again) taking on a man and dislocating his hip.

I take away one star from this little reality jewel because the last fight is rather lame, and some of the fights do end a bit too early.  Otherwise, though, you get what you pay for: women throwing each other to the floor, pulling each other's hair out, and punching one another in the face.

Sit back, open your cheapest beer, and revel in the trash that is ""Queen of the Hood.""",1143676800,18,1214,4.486363636363636
