8087404,5,B000BJKWOO,This video shows pictures of the churches in Germany during WW II with swastikas on the altar cloths and in the banners in the churches. These images give us a chance to look at the churches in American with their American flags hung on the walls and in various places.,1489276800,,269,4.4
8087405,4,B000BJKWOO,"Terrible intellectual errors are so often made by serious theologians.  This is history that needs to be known as broadly as possible.  But why drag old Richard Wagner's music into so much of it.  Yes he was a terrible anti-Semite, and Hitler loved his music -- but come on, he died in 1883.  As a Wagner music lover I was so distracted by the beautiful music that I just about couldn't follow the important content of the movie.",1417824000,,429,4.461538461538462
8087406,4,B000BJKWOO,"About ten years ago I did a study of the churches under Hitler.  I can read German, so I was very much helped by German articles and documents I found through the German version of Google.  I also used German monographs on the ""Church Struggle"" that were loaned to me by a friend who is a librarian at a religious studies center in Germany.

The film does a good job of tracing German attitudes during the 1930's back to the Enlightenment when strong attempts were made to separate the German people from their religious faith.  But, it mentions there was little resistance to Hitler from the churches.  What it fails to mention is that Hitler craftily neutered the Roman Catholic Church through the Konkordat.  His representatives worked by hook and crook to seize control of the Protestant churches and their administrative offices so that by 1937 the Evangelical church officeholders were all Nazi sympathizers.  What you do find is that aware individual Christians committed acts of resistance as individual Christians where and when they could.  The Canaris Plot to assassinate Hitler on July 20,1944 shocked the SS officer who investigated it.  After obtaining a list of the participants and interrogating them, he was shocked to learn that each of the 167 had been influenced by involvement in a church.

Prominent in the film is a statement by Emmanuel Hirsch that heralded the coming of Hitler as a gift of God's grace.  In the case of many others, they supported Hitler with fervor initially, but later began to see who and what he was in reality.  Hans and Sophie Scholl were two such people, and their Christian faith was a large part in their opposition to Hitler, for which they paid with their lives.

The film is good, but it would be easy to be misled by it unless one has done some previous reading on the ""Church Struggle.""  In the years following World War II people were grateful to the church for its resistance.  Even Albert Einstein (a Jewish man) said it was only the church that stood up to Hitler--not the great newspapers, not the great universities, and Einstein had come to have the greatest respect for it.  In recent decades we are treated to endless criticisms of the churches for not doing more during the Hitler years.  This film could be better in this respect.",1263859200,11,2297,4.7455919395466
