8484260,4,B005RF3SVQ,"Surely nobody familiar with the long running series of books by Rex Stout will confuse Edward Arnold's character with the real Nero Wolfe nor Lionel Stander as Archie Goodwin. No identity was intended. The assembly line was mandated to produce a sufficient number of potboilers to play second fiddle, on the mandated double features of the Great Depression era, to the film at the top of the bill. Edward Arnold was one of the superior contract players of the era, splitting his time, superbly playing featured (though not starring) roles in the 'A' pictures and solid leads in the  'B' pictures, the so-called, programmers. This one,which severely mangles an original by Stout, turns out to be an amusing mystery in the tradition of the many series of the time,The Lone Wolf, Charlie Chan, Philo Vance, Ellery Queen, Perry Mason, and the like. Its plot follows the formula derived from the film adaptations of other literary mysteries, allowing room for an assortment of  possible suspects, a murder not everyone will perceive as such, a brilliant private eye or amateur, who tends to have some notable idiosyncrasies, and an assistant who tends to be puzzled by the genius of his employer (or friend).  Edward Arnold, on instructions, no doubt, hams it up to a fare-thee-well, and Lionel Stander puts his distinctive voice to good use. If you expect nothing but a moderately diverting look back at the films that we kids saw every Saturday  matinee in the 1930's, this will be satisfying. Don't sit down before it for meaty prime-time fare; it was never intended to serve that purpose.
Incidentally, the current editorial review is incorrect about the substitution of hot chocolate for beer--in my edition, at any rate. Quite the opposite, it is one of the gimmicks used to fill out the Arnold character.",1334275200,7,1806,4.9504950495049505
