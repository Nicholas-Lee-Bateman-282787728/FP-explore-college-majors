7893625,4,6305736146,Early attempt for Polley to highlight the growth of neo-Nazi freaks. Not a good movie.,1415577600,,86,4.8
7893626,3,6305736146,As usual it starts out promising but ultimately falls short. Anything dealing with racial issues in our society is always slanted against white people. Of course the hero is a white female who joins a white power group. This is unrealistic to begin with. Most white females in our society are unopinionated or out right antagonistic to white heritage/identity. The villains are nazis of course. The 3rd reich is more hated in our culture than satan and even less tolerated. Not many females would join a movement so unpopular or so unpopculture! White power groups tend to be the domain of working class white males who feel left out of society without a voice. Females are treated differently and are generally more excepted by nonwhites and therefore don't tend to gravitate toward those beliefs and/or movements. This movie has its good points but is overdone and full of exaggerated realism.,1106352000,7,895,4.973333333333334
7893627,5,6305736146,"I enjoyed this TV movie when it aired, and I was surprised and pleased to see it quickly made available on VHS.  Having bought it, I was even more surprised and pleased when it later became available on DVD and promptly bought it again since the DVD has additional features.  Why surprised?  Because rarely do such well made, thought-provoking and feeling-provoking films become widely available.  Why pleased?  Because this is a film that can help to elucidate and therefore perhaps contribute to the demise of the situation that it describes. We have here only a film, but it can be a valuable tool if used appropriately and without didacticism to show young people and perhaps some older individuals as well the reality of this serious problem among us.  Sarah Polley provides a depth of performance obtained from already acting for many years despite her young age at the time the film was made, and she brings a subtle but believable reality to her young character who, unfortunately, is not perhaps as rare as we might believe her to be in our society.  Nothing is over played, everything speaks for itself.  The rest of the cast have impressive credentials as well, and each lends a three dimensional fullness to their characters. The writer and the director, of course, are owed a huge debt of gratitude for bringing this film to fruition.  However, a nagging paradox is applicable to the film:  to warn against violence, one has to depict it.  Therefore, parts of the film may be very disturbing for some.  But, like receiving a shocking diagnosis of cancer, through this film at least we have a chance to fight the disease rather than have it consume us while we continue in blissful ignorance of its presence.",1097366400,5,1720,4.793220338983051
7893628,2,6305736146,"this movie like american history x was right on the money in the start. but as always the white guilt kicks in and whitey is the evil one. so you know how its going to end. when are they going to make a movie about the evils of other hate groups, oh wait there just patted on the back for hating whitey and given money to keep expanding. thumbs down for the typical hollywood ending. why is it when the white man and woman are proud and have racial idenity they are evil and bad and must be struck down? but we constantly pat the back of those who hate the white man but love the white woman.",1096243200,13,592,4.02542372881356
7893629,4,6305736146,"Depending on your own political and racial views, this film either A) had great potential but a bad ending, or B) showed the ""truth"" about racists! My beliefs sway my opinion toward the former.
Message: Like its big-studio successor American History X, this film presented many rational and researched facts which White Nationalists rightfully use to argue their case. Unfortunately, and also like AHX, it negated every single irrefutable piece of pro-White evidence with acts of blatant violence and stupidity that are, in reality, much, much less common (and rarely, if ever, advocated or supported by respectable WN groups) than the media and entertainment industry enjoy leading its braindead audience of blind sheep to believe.
Acting: I thought each person did a commendable job of interpreting their various roles as they were intended and written. Being a North American teen myself, I found Sarah Polley's portrayal of Catherine Chapman very relatable. Confused, angry, intelligent. Many others will find comfort in her character.
Plot: The storyline had potential, but the end is predictable and overall disappointing. The plot was simple but not really lacking, and not bad for a made-for-TV drama.
I recommend this film to anyone interested in the subject of race. Also check out American History X and Romper Stomper--please just keep an open mind while viewing them and do lots of research before taking a particular viewpoint on their messages.",1024531200,2,1459,5.293103448275862
7893630,4,6305736146,"Catherine Chapman (Sarah Polly) is an intelligent young Canadian university student who happens to be very angry. She see's her countries White European culture being sacrificed for the sake of multiculturalism.  As she begins to question the value of a multiracial society, an  anti-racist organization targets her campus for its activism. Lead by your  rank-n-file self righteous Leftist, this organization holds a rally to  promote its ideology - Catherine attends. She isn't afraid to approach the  microphone and openly question their position and multiracialism in  general. As expected, she is ridiculed for daring to oppose them.
She  takes her anger to the internet where she soon discovers a group of like  minded people who also oppose their governments multicultural policy. The  group is named The National Identity Movement and believes that only the  most extreme solution can save White Canada i.e. Nazism. She befriends  member Tanya Allen and soon finds herself a member as well. She also finds  comfort from older member Lynn Redgrave as a kind of Nazi mother. She  becomes something of a spokesperson for NIM and wipes the floor with those  who debate her. However, terrorist attacks by violent anti-racist activists  and the Canadian governments policy toward White Nationalists convince  Catherine that the world of White Nationalist activism may be far more  violent and dangerous than she can handle.
The film soon turns formula as  Catherine finds herself in over her head and decides to 'betray' her  organization in an attempt to sever her ties to it. I'm sorry, but if  Catherine becomes the spokesperson for this group, she has fully accepted  their ideology and it would take a VERY powerful reason for her to turn her  back on her friends. Not so in this film. But that doesn't matter as the  the film's writers have to make it clear no matter what that Catherine was  wrong and must repent.
For a television movie, White Lies stands apart  with its good acting and stylish approach. The fair treatment of the White  Nationalists was also a welcome surprise. Recommended.",964569600,4,2102,5.090909090909091
7893631,5,6305736146,"It is refreshing to see a film written on such a contravercial subject which does not go over the top yet is so honest and intelligent you can forget it is just a film. The charactors are all special, lovable and dare  I say understandable, this is due to the daring script and direction,  casting and great acting, I wondered whether they were acting. The dialogue  is obviousely well thought through, amusing in places, and extemely  powerful, which is an important part of this film being what it is. White  Lies has everything, emotion, humour, enough violence and action to satisfy  even hardened Romper Stomper fans and twists and turns which left me an  emotional wreck at the end. I spent the entire film changing who and what I  was supporting, and it left me with profound thoughts at the end. So much  so that I had to watch it again and again and then bore my friends talking  about this unforgettable experience, known as White Lies.",950227200,6,946,4.610778443113772
