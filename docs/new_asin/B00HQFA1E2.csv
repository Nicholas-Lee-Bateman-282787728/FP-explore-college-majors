6196588,1,B00HQFA1E2,"This was the second one of these videos that I ordered, and it didn't work either. The video plays until it gets to the next chapter, then it stops!  I actually had to shut down my blue ray player and restart it. Like I said, this happened to me with two of these videos. Back to back. I did figure out how to watch the entire video though. I had to always go to each chapter to watch the entire video.",1475452800,,402,3.962962962962963
6196589,5,B00HQFA1E2,"Chronicles the existence of 'The Friendly Confines'. Originally built for a Federal League baseball team. the league folded and the owner bought the Cubs. He eventually sold to Wrigley. This tells of famous moments, stories, and accomplishments that occurred at the park. Famous people comment and appear. Insightful.

Includes information about retired jersey numbers and statues.",1470268800,,381,5.803571428571429

6196592,5,B00HQFA1E2,"Really neat nostalgia product. I saw my first game at Wrigley in 1939. I remember listening to Bob Elson on WGN broadcasting Gabby Hartnett's 1938 homer in the dark and glad I could see it on this DVD. I've been a White Sox fan for eighty years but always have had sympathy for the Cubs and their fans. This DVD relives the memories, for sure.",1463702400,5,343,4.292307692307692

6196594,5,B00HQFA1E2,"For the low price, this is a much better show than I was expecting. Lots of great detail about the history of not only the structure, but the other elements of the ballpark that make it unique. As a Cubs fan since I was 16, I didn't even know a lot of this stuff! And as an architectural historian, it was great research for me to know going forward.",1448582400,5,350,4.086956521739131

8634243,5,B00HQFA1E2,"As a long-time Cubs fan, I remember taking the ""EL"" train from Evanston to Clark & Addison, which let me off 1/2 block from Wrigley Field.  Back in the latter 1960's the team was mediocre (until 1969, that is), and it was easy to walk up to the park on the day of the game and purchase tickets for seats over the Cubs dugout in the first few rows.  One day I was taking photos of the Cubs at practice and Ron Santo walked over towards me.  I had no pen and nothing for him to sign, but I snapped a photo.  It was easy then to get up close to the players.  There were no lights in the park yet so every game was a day game.  I remember playing hooky from work one time to attend a game, only to find out later that my boss was at the same game.  Lucky he didn't see me.  The park has changed a lot since those days.  I've never been to a night game and it's been many years since I was at Wrigley Field.  But there is no better park to make you feel close to the players and to the game itself.  And this dvd covers the history of the park, the changes made over the decades, and interviews many of the former Cubs (some who have since died).  I love this dvd.  My husband liked it too, even though he's a Braves fan.",1495670400,,1216,3.894308943089431

From every home team that played here (mostly the Cubs, but rich history of the Bears too), event, rock concert etc. Every nook and cranny of Wrigley Field is covered!

8634248,5,B00HQFA1E2,My husband has been a Cubs fan for 80 years. I am so happy he lived to see them win the Series!  I bought this DVD for him because it's a walk down memory lane for him growing up in Chicago.  He has watched it several times!,1487116800,,224,3.74468085106383
