8123501,3,B000FJ4L8S,"Sound quality good with the excellent musical score. Picture grainy, clarity of picture - very poor. Most episodes seemed out of focus. First DVD had digital defects and black horizontal, floating lines, not the normal vertical film scratches. Good price, but I would buy another version, made by a different company. Blu-ray version will be out soon, that should have a higher picture quality.

8123502,5,B000FJ4L8S,"This series was exciting and educational for me as a young man watching B&W TV.  The series was also shown during Naval Boot camp, in San Diego in the 60s.  Watching this series was a lot better than marching around on hot concrete parade fields.",1178496000,,246,4.444444444444445
