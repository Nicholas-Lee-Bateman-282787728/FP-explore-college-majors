2569576,5,B000FJGWC6,"In the first few minutes of the 2004 BBC television comedy, ""The Worst Week of My Life"", Howard Steele (Ben Miller) has a tender, morning bedroom moment with his beautiful, fiance', Mel (Sarah Alexander of ""Coupling"" fame). The phone rings and Mel's mother is on the line in hysterics over the wrong wedding furniture being delivered. So much for tender moments. The show chronicles the wickedly funny, horrible seven days (each episode represents one day) leading up to the couple's wedding ceremony. You know 'Murphy's Law', ""If anything can go wrong, it will go wrong."" Well, just double that for poor, Howard. Wedding furniture is the least of his problems. The main crux of the matter is that Howard will do just about anything to try and please the well to do, 'blue blood' family, that he's marrying into. The family includes Mel's humorless, stuff-shirt father, Dick (Geoffrey Whitehead), hysterical mother, Angela (Alison Steadman) and sluttish younger sister, Sophie (Emma Pierson). Disaster seems to follow anytime Howard tries to please these people and help out. Trouble seems to grow exponentially as the poor man attempts to cover-up each previous mis-step. Just a couple of Howard's disasters include losing the  family's priceless, heirloom ring in the sewer, destroying a painting of his father-in-law, crashing a car into a newly built brick wall, mistakenly giving condoms as a wedding gift, getting into bed and spooning his mother-law, killing the beloved, family dog with a cement mixer and accidentally putting the family's elderly, grandmum into a coma. Things finally come to a head, when the couple must deal with a psychotic, female stalker, who's been plagueing Howard throughout the series. Sounds pretty dark, right? Yup... but this is 'black' humor at its' best! By the end of the series, we seem to be witnessing more of an endurance test, than a wedding ceremony. Howard and Mel will do anything to get to the finish line. It's absolutely gutt-busting, hilarious! Hopefully the BBC will give us a second series, that includes more of the honeymoon. The last scene of the last episode hints, that there is more trouble to come! Highly recommended!",1160697600,35,2180,5.089385474860335
2569577,5,B000FJGWC6,"Nothing beats British humor!  There have been few American shows that have made me laugh out loud as much as this one has.  I think Coupling was the last show that got belly laughs out of me, and that was a British series as well.  The Worst Week of My Life chronicles the seven days before the wedding of Howard (Ben Miller) and Mel (Sarah Alexander).  Everyone knows that the week before a wedding could be stressful, but Howard hadn't anticipated how stressful things would get during that week.  Everything that could possibly go wrong does, and in his desperate attempt to impress his future parents-in-law (played by Alison Steadman and Geoffrey Whitehead), protect a wedding ring that's a family heirloom, getting stuck with the less than ideal best man,  and avoiding a psychotic ex-girlfriend (of sorts), Howard only makes things worse.

As I said earlier, I couldn't stop laughing.  These are seven of the funniest episodes I have seen in quite a long time.  The way Howard gets himself in one mess after another will have you in stitches.  The part about his wanting to impress his in-laws sort of reminded me of Meet the Parents, and Ben Miller reminded me of Ben Stiller (even their names are similar!), but this series is ten times funnier than the aforementioned movie.  I remember Sarah Alexander from her role of Susan in Coupling, and even though she had a plain role as Howard's fiancee in this one, it was fun to see her in another show.  Alison Steadman made a wonderful performance as Mrs. Bennett in Pride and Prejudice '95 and she impressed me with her comic timing again.  And I loved Geoffrey Whitehead's performance!  I loved his deadpan expressions when saying something funny.  I recognized a few faces in this series, people I'm sure I'd seen before but cannot remember where.  Anyway, I love, love, LOVE The Worst Week of My Life.  This BBC comedy series has found a special place on my DVD shelf and I shall watch it again and again.  I can't wait for the second part of the series to be released on this side of the pond.",1159747200,22,2054,4.62707182320442

I'd seen it years ago and decided it was time to keep available in my DVD library.  It doesn't disappoint and the mishaps are a bit over-the-top, but Ben and Sarah make it worth your time.  Her parents are excellent, played with just the right amount of disgust on her father's part and just enough sympathy on her mother's part, to save Ben's character.  It is a bad week for Ben/Howard, Mel/Melissa and her family, but it does actually entertain us until the end.  And it's a happy ending???  Perhaps.",1378771200,,600,4.467889908256881

2569590,5,B000FJGWC6,"if you need a quick, hilarious pick me up, this is the show for you.  this is typical of the British where everything is very droll and very wacky.  everything that could go wrong for this couple in the week leading up to their marriage, does go wrong.  the most hilarious segments are with the brides parents.  the groom's arrival at their home is a recipe for certain disaster from the moment he walks in the front door. everyone around him is afflicted by disaster as well.  both his best man and grandmother in law end up in the hospital in critical condition.

keeping up the hilarity are the groom's own relatives.  his father is the opposite of the bride's parents.  he is at best working class while the bride's parents are a judge and his wife.  the groom's father's newest girlfriend is a lap dancer and she breaks into her routine at almost every chance. when the best man ends up in the hospital, a working class lad must be substituted as best man and he is almost identical to the father.  dinner among all of these folks is a hilarious nightmare.

i have had to deal this past week with relatives with likely terminal conditions so i needed a totally escapist farce.  this was it and i couldn't have asked for a better one.

2569591,5,B000FJGWC6,"I'm not afraid to admit it: absurdity can lead to some of the best comedy going, and when physical situations backed by circumstances complicate matters, hilarity can ensue!

I have never heard of this program and missed the US versions completely, which after reading reviews of them, probably spared me a great deal of groaning and disappointment.

PBS here in Boston have decided to run this locally at Oh-dark-thirty (literally) on the Sunday overnight and I just caught the first episode of this new-to-me program, thankfully, the first episode of Series One, so I have a running start on this series now.

Within the first minute, my mouth was agape at the instant breakneck pace of what bad luck can befall one man... all hilariously timed to the point that I could no longer hold it in and started laughing uncontrollably... which happened several times over the remainder of the program.

The setup is a snap: a middle-class publishing house schlub, not the boss, not a lackey, is happlessly played well by Ben Miller as Howard Steel, who really just wants everyone to be happy, himself included, if that's possible.

In his great fortune, he manages somehow to have a mutually head-over-heels love with Sarah Alexander's character (you may remember her as the tart-tongued blond in Coupling) Mel, the daughter of a Royal Bench Judge. This show is the start of the last week before their wedding and every deity and demigod has apparently deigned to set asunder what the hearts desire... Series One is 7 episodes, one for each day of that fateful and side-splitting week.

The pace is breakneck, and horrifying (and hilarious) calamities involve losing the family heirloom wedding ring he is to present to her, given to her grandmother's grandmama by Queen Victoria herself... after Howard's assistant, fecklessly played by Janine Duvitski who is hilarious, tries it on, can't get it off, finally enlists several coworkers to muscle it off her chubby finger in the loo and it flies into a sink... and the oblivion of the municipal sewer system of London. She does what it takes, though, getting right in there to rescue the ring, getting covered with filth...

All while Howard is saying he ""forgot"" the ring in his office safe and will retrieve it the next day to show to Mel's grandmother, who has not seen it in some time. Unfortunately, in staying at the manse of the Judge, his future father-in-law, he must endure a lovely lamb goulash that he had had once before and politely insisted was the best thing he'd ever eaten, thus sentencing himself and the family to have to eat this abomination well into the foreseeable future. Even his future mother in law's mother, the straight talking Grandmother, simply states ""she'll pass on dinner tonight"" when seeing what was being served.

Howard does the spit the meat into the serviette trick, then dumping it in his dinner jacket pocket... which the household yippee puppy detects, of course. Eventually he is able to escape to the loo to flush the evidence of his foul but well meaning lie only to find that the toilet is not able to flush vigorously enough to handle these huge sinewy chunks of lamb, and must resort to plan B. On his knees, he decides to fish the chunks of meat from the toilet bowl just as the Judge walks into the bathroom to witness him cradling the brown rectangular chunks in his hands... and at first, and only glance, mistakes this for Howard fishing his feces from the toilet for lord knows what purpose!

Before dinner, though, Mel's sister, a late teen dilettante, decides that the bridesmaids dresses are ""utter crap"" and announces that loudly in the foyer to Howard, Mel and their parents. She is so disgusted that she tears the dress off of herself, throwing it upon the floor and stands firm, stark raving naked (nothing shows), complaining about the horrific dress while Howard is struck dumb staring at her, um, attributes... and naturally is busted.

Later after dinner and trying to recover from the pooper scooper incident, Howard tries to make smalltalk in the lounge with the family who have FINALLY resolved the enormous puzzle of a seating plan using little puzzle pieces moves on a scale tableau model on a folding card table. Relief permeates the air as he has just been called that the ring, coated in poo it may be, has been recovered, and the ladies are aglow in a seating plan well done.

And then he sits to enjoy his scotch, the toe of his foot tapping the leg of the card table, which collapses, sending the entire seating plan crashing to the floor in a mess, unrecorded.

Yes, the gags are silly, yes, they've all been done before and since, and usually as stand alone one-liners. They are expanded upon hilariously, though, extracting everything there is worth getting. Here, the beauty of this show is that these vignettes are all woven in, improbably as it might seem, to a continuous stream of misadventure that befalls Howard, one body blow after another... and as dopey as it all is, somehow it is written deftly enough, and you feel so sorry for poor, well-meaning Howard, that it all becomes just plausible enough yet you know the universe could never be so mean... and you must laugh until your eyes water.

If you were fortunate to see the opening teaser segment of the first episode of the Ellen show many years ago on ABC when they gave her a shot and America decided they couldn't handle a gay lead character, you may recall the bit where she replaces the water bottle in her dispenser stand, a very physical, hilarious, non-verbal bit that lasted a good 4 minutes or so culminating in the only two words spoken in the entire bit: ""mmm... Refreshing!"" I won't ruin that bit, but I, until now, had never laughed so hard at something written for TV before in my life, except maybe the classic Lucille Ball chocolate factory bit, which Ellen's was very reminiscent of... What's missing here is the camera mugging that is part of the fun of Mr. Bean, and Howard just doesn't have the heart to be a mean SOB like Basil Fawlty, another hilarious character of British comedy.

Worst Week had me fighting to not laugh so loud as to wake people in the house... and did it for half an hour.

This is hilarious stuff, anyone who's ever gotten married can identify, and the leads are actually likable enough that you are not laughing at them spitefully... Very well done, and I'm sure, as with most British comedy imports, couldn't be transliterated into American well.

It doesn't need to be.

Watch this and laugh. The end.",1326067200,,6541,4.733743409490334

I read in one review that some of the situations have been done before. I did not find that objectionable. Truly original stories are rare, it's the delivery in present day context that matter. The episodes are clever with economy of words and relentless in delivering laughter, before you even get a chance to catch your breath, without resorting to silliness or vulgarity. It is a prized addition to our comedy collection.

It's not a painful show to sit through; it's tolerable.  But it's not entertaining and it's definitely not original.  (Originality isn't everything, I realize, but if you're going to cop other people's ideas, at least do something interesting with them).  I'd give this show two thumbs down, but I'm too bored to even do that.

A prime example occurs when the main character lets a secretary try on his fiance's ring which has been in the family for years.  Guess what happens?  Hmmm.
