8056339,5,B0008JFMZQ,"The Yoga Rx: Immune Booster and General Conditioning DVDs by Larry Payne, PhD, provide safe, user-friendly yoga routines, perfect for older beginners, those not currently exercising, or anyone recovering from illness and/or injury.  Based on the book, Yoga Rx:  A step-by-step program to promote health, wellness, and healing from common ailments, these yoga routines can help increase strength, flexibility, and vitality while reducing stress.

These DVDs are not suggested for experienced yoga students seeking a vigorous fast-paced workout.

The Yoga Rx: Immune Booster and General Conditioning program includes two DVDs: Level One and Level Two, filmed on the grounds of the Rancho La Puerta Spa in Baja, California.  Yoga expert, Larry Payne, instructs you through all the routines, which are taught in the TKV Desikachar style of yoga, a safe, user-friendly style of yoga commonly associated with yoga therapy.

Level One is an excellent gentle yoga practice that can slowly build strength and flexibility.  It includes 20-minute and 40 minute options that are demonstrated by a fit 40-year-old female yoga student.  It is accessible for inexperienced beginners, providing detailed instructions for breathing and moving.  The 20-minute routine is a series of standing poses that ends with relaxation. You can choose to stop or continue with the second 20-minute routine that includes a variety of poses performed lying on your back and your stomach and concludes with more relaxation and a breathing exercise.

The Level Two routine, demonstrated by a fit 49-year-old female yoga student, adds variety and intensity with more challenging standing poses including modified sun salutes and warrior 3 pose, as well as vigorous floor poses such as modified shoulder stand, modified boat, and modified locust.

I've done both routines and like them.  I get excited when I discover yoga DVDs that are accessible and user-friendly for people in their 40s and beyond.  After suggesting several yoga DVDs to my 39-year-old brother who wanted to try yoga and was intimidated with the idea of going to class, these are the DVDs that resonated with him.  He found them challenging without being overwhelming to somebody with no previous yoga experience.

The DVDs move at a slow controlled pace, with expert instruction and soothing background music.  Poses are performed in a flowing manner encouraging you to coordinate your movement and your breath into a relaxing rhythm, which is very soothing for your nervous system.  Periods of rest are sprinkled throughout the routines and counter poses are provided to compensate for challenging poses as appropriate.

If you are looking for accessible, user-friendly yoga routines for your 40s and beyond you may want to give these DVDs a spin.",1222214400,2,2783,5.344036697247707
