433421,5,630203535X,"I used to have this movie, and I seriously regret the fact that my family taped over it.  This is a fun film based on one of the all-time great 80's cartoon series.
Three witches unlease the Smooze on Dream Valley in order to make it ""dark, dank, and dreary.""  The ponies bring Meghan, Danny, and Molly and their Rainbow locket to Ponyland to save them, but the Smooze manages to suck up the Rainbow of Light before a spell mishap puts it to sleep.  The humans, a few ponies, and one brave bushwoolie search for help before the witches can awaken the Smooze and completely flood Ponyland.  Meanwhile, Baby Lickety-Split and Spike run away and meet the Grundles before they reunite with everyone in Flutter Valley, home of the magic ponies that can defeat the Smooze.  Lots of singing and neat adventures take place along the way.
It's really a fun family movie, and there are lots of lessons that are learned along the way about teamwork, family, and keeping hope alive.  The songs are great, particularly ""Nothing Can Stop the Smooze,"" if only for the back-up singing the Smooze heads do.  Buy this movie, you won't regret it.",1027641600,52,1127,4.605
433422,5,630203535X,"Actually, my favorite is Firefly's Adventure, but MLP: The Movie is great! The ponies have to fight against the Smooze, & with the Rainbow of Light buried by the stuff, what'll they do??

Very pleased with my purchase but Im slightly biased as this is my absolute favorite movie from when I was a little girl! I used to watch it at my grandparents house every weekend! Adorable movie, gorgeous colorful ponies of all types, cute songs, great silly villains. Keep in mind this movie is from the 80s, the picture quality is very different from what you see made these days, so don't compare it in that sense.

433547,4,630203535X,"If you were a child of the 80s, you've seen this movie. The plot is pretty urbane and seems geared towards introducing new characters and objects probably for the sole purpose of selling more toys (I'm looking at you Paradise Estates). My 4 year old borrowed an old copy of this from the library and was devastated when we had to return it, so I finally caved and bought this.

433584,4,630203535X,"This DVD is the original My Little Pony (MLP) from the mid-1980s.  Danny DeVito was the big name star in it.

It is a wonderful MLP story about ponies, friendship, trust, and winning as a team.  Yeah!

If you got into the series in the last 15 years then you will probably be very disappointed in the quality of the animation.  The newer series and movies were done at 24+ frames per second largely using Flash Professional.  The original film included in this DVD looks like it is 12 fps or less and done via rotoscoping.  That is just a fancy way of saying that it pales compared to the quality of the MLP most of the audience is used to.

Occasionally you run into a video gem from prior to 2010 that outshines current animation.  For example,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Puss-in-Boots/dp/B0009U7LOO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Puss in Boots</a>&nbsp;is probably the best version out there, but in the case of the MLP Movie, the more recent one is better on a number of levels.

One good thing about this version is that you cannot beat the price.",1515110400,3,1096,5.005524861878453

433588,4,630203535X,"Despite poor quality, the original MLP movie had its cult following by long-time fans. The music, the voice acting, and the characters were all entertained. Plus, the animation was quite very well hand-drawn (although not age well over three decades ago).

Still, I found it to be enjoyable and surprisingly good flick. Just don't get discouraged by current-gen MLP fans and enjoyed the whole movie!",1514073600,,399,5.138461538461539

I was skeptical about my granddaughter liking it due to the many generational changes that have taken place over the years. To my surprise and delight she loves it as well. It's a wonderful story of friendship, accepting people as they are, helping each other, and ultimately banding together to defeat a common enemy. It doesn't sugar coat bad behavior or bad tempers. Instead it shows the ramification of these attitudes and realization that comes from learning they are wrong. It teaches this through a gentle and loving message though. It's also very funny and had wonderful music. Enjoy!",1505260800,,671,4.843478260869565

The story is fun for those who haven't seen it. It's not as energetic as the new ponies. A little sweeter, but is a cute story with an adventurous theme. My daughter (2yr) watched it on repeat but says it's ""a little scary""
There are some funny, but a little abrasive witches, a giant spider thing and a goopy character in it, as the villains, but they keep it pretty light, regardless.
The ponies and other characters are cute- one's a little whiny- lol
They're the characters from back in the day, though, and I like them better than the new ones! (I'm a tad biased)",1503273600,3,671,4.333333333333333

433699,3,630203535X,"It's a passable movie. Though it's astounding to think that this made it to the theaters. No wonder Hasbro's future movies kinda got dinged after this hit theaters.

The general plot sees the ponies pitted against the evil Witches from the Volcano of Gloom, who want to make Ponyland Dark, Dank, and Dreary. Her bumbling daughters Reeka and Draggle are tasked with this, and after failing are sent out to collect ingredients to make The Smooze, skipping out on The Phlume, which terrifies them for some reason (which of course is later revealed). Meanwhile, we have ponies going out to find Lickety Split, a sort of bratty pony who goes it alone after ruining the ponies' spring dance and finds herself chewed out for it. Dragged along is Spike, the baby dragon. The human Megan and her siblings are dragged into the conflict once The Smooze activates sans the phulme (the daughters of course lie to their mother) and starts burying ponyland. The Smooze itself is a rather two-dimensional but intriguing villain; it's a mess of ever expanding purple sludge with eyes that hey, can even sing musical numbers! No seriously, the villain song ""Nothing Can Stop the Smooze"" will get stuck in your head.

The plot from here is your usual ""we gotta stop the bad guys!"" with Megan and co journeying to find the legendary Flutter Ponies after The Smooze eats the ponies' signature weapon, The Rainbow of Light. There's a few new characters met, like the kind but silly Grundles. But there's some things that just kinda stick out, like some of the monster designs (especially those creepy looking forest things that throw sharp tree stumps at the ponies). Then there's the scene where Reeka and Draggle collect The Phlume, which is actually sap that is drawn from the base of this huge plant monster thing. It's...something you have to see for yourself really. The sisters take a lot of abuse in what's supposed to be a comical moment - ""Sisters Try to Collect Liquid From Plant and Hilarity Ensures!"" - but it comes off as...really out of place. Then there's the color pallet, which comes off as (ironically enough) dark, dank and dreary. Seriously, if your media player has color control (for those who bought the DVD) put some pep in the colors. And the animation glitches. Oh man, don't play the ""Take a shot for each mistake"" drinking game. It'll put you out. Especially in some scenes like the one with The Phlume.

After viewing this for myself, it's easy to see how a lot of present-day bronies just don't like this film. It's okay to watch as a piece of MLP history, but when the bumbling HUMAN villains are more interesting than the ponies? Well, you done screwed up.",1469491200,,2667,4.731182795698925

The villains double as the comic relief . . . poorly.  The lack of ""real"" villains feels condescending compared to the previous specials or even ""MLP & Friends"".  The ponies would never have looked at Grogar or Lavan and said, ""Teehee, he's cute!""

Additionally, the animation is just not very good.  With ""MLP & Friends"" I'm willing to cut some slack because, hey, 80s Saturday morning cartoon, but this was a MOVIE that played in actual movie theaters.  Why oh why didn't they go to the company who did the beautiful animation in ""Rescue at Midnight Castle""?  Really sad, especially when Transformers: The Movie, which came out the same year, got AMAZING animation and an action-packed plot.

433832,5,630203535X,"Holy crap - what a godsend! As summer break waned, my girls became increasingly restless  to the point I was relieved and surprised every evening when I arrived home from work and didn't see a broken window and one (or more) of my kids lying in the front lawn. As a general rule, summer-time television is used quite sparingly at home so I was surprised to see an email notification from Amazon scroll across the top of my phone thanking me for my order of My Little Pony: The Movie. My wife must have been having a very bad day.

For my children, this movie did not elicit the normal hyper-active behaviors, including; dancing, singing, spinning, jumping, screaming about, followed by a frenetic recap of every scene and inevitably a fight over who was going to pretend to be what character. . Rather, My Little Ponies lulled them into a trance-like state complete with temporary paralysis, red-eyes and mild drooling. They were completely and utterly mesmerized and I couldn't have gotten their attention if I had entered the house riding an actual pony.

Whats funny is that my wife fondly recalls the innocence of this movie from when she saw it in the theater as a child. But when we watched it with the girls, (who, by this point, had watched it six consecutive times) we realized that the crap today is no better or worse than the crap from 30 years ago. There is some minor verbal abuse and your run-of-the-mill evil - intent on ruining all that is good and beautiful for no good reason. I think under normal circumstances I would have turned off the show and found something better, but like I said, it was the end of summer and the kids eventually sapped all of our patience, creativity and standards. Besides, it was ok when we were little, so, you know its fine.

Heres the best part  they don't sell 1986 era My Little Ponies at the stores (at lease the stores Ive been in with the girls), they only sell the newer ones. So when my girls run up to the stuffed animal display at (insert store name here) because they see a My Little Pony, they inevitably return empty handed because they didn't have the one they wanted. Note  this will only save you money if you don't let your kids watch the newer My Little Pony shows.

While I personally don't care for the movie, I can assure you that my daughters will stand behind this 5-star rating. Im fairly certain they prefer this to Frozen - and that is saying something.",1440374400,,2429,4.506818181818182

433839,4,630203535X,"Before there was ""Friendship is Magic"", there was the original 80s ""My Little Pony"" cartoon series, which this movie ties into. (It takes place after ""Rescue at Midnight Castle"" and ""Escape From Catrina"", but before season one of the classic series.) A bit of forewarning: the original series is quite a bit different from its modern counterpart, so Friendship Is Magic fans who are not also 80s cartoon fans may have a hard time adjusting to it!

The writing for the Movie is quirky but fun, though none of the characters have much depth to them. The art is usually adequate and occasionally quite good, but I don't think it ever ventures into masterpiece quality. The biggest problem the movie faces is that it introduces a huge cast of characters so quickly that it's impossible to keep track of most of them. Adding to the problem, most of the ponies are only distinguishable by their colors (and their cutie marks when they're visible) and I suspect the colorists didn't always color the ponies correctly.

Despite its flaws I still found this movie fairly enjoyable. If you are already a fan of the original MLP, or if you plan to share it with young children, this wouldn't be a bad choice. However adults who are not fans of the original MLP or 80s television for kids in general will likely be less than impressed by this movie.",1438214400,,1337,4.661016949152542

433874,3,630203535X,"The movie it self is great. I grow up watching the movie. I was very disappointed in the product in general. Quality is terrible. I expected so much more for a anniversary edition . The movie blurr in and out like it having trouble forcing on the characters. On top of that it automatically set on full frame 1.33 so if you have wide screen tv. It doesn't fit the entire tv. My cheap Austrian copy that I purchase 10 years ago is more clear than this copy. I ended up buying a used copy from the last release that rhino release on eBay. It's much more clearer that this new release. I wish I would of purchased a brand rhino copy when it first came out. If I could I would return my copy to Amazon just for poor quality. It's might look better on a standard tv vs a wide screen tv. The video that is posted on Amazon is very clear .

Covering some comments that some users are putting yes the things in them do happen. Like for instance the witches and stuff you can read in other reviews. You need to remember they are bad guys in the movie. That why it very important to sit down with your kids and explain the difference in good and evil.

Even her colicky 4 month old brother was soothed by watching them.  For even younger kids, 2 to 3, a few scenes may seem scary.  By age 7 they'll probably be on to somewhat more challenging stories.

I was obsessed with My Little Pony as a kid and so I was thrilled when I had a little girl of my own and saw that they brought back the ponies! And now, thirty years later, the original movie is available once again!

Its funny watching it thirty years later with my daughter with the recognizable voices of Danny DeVito, Tony Randall and Cloris Leachman that meant nothing to me back then! This movie is pretty different from the modern day show and movies and my five year old Paige immediately pointed it out. The ponies look different, sounds different and even act differently but the foundation is still the same! They are a great group of friends that love and support each other and happily go through life together. The color, sound and graphics are what youd expect from the eighties. To me its nostalgic and I love it! Modern day kiddos might not appreciate it so much but I loved watching this with Paige.

There is a lot more music than I remembered. Its almost a musical with as much singing as talking. There is a little more evil and bad guys than I remembered too but my kids are past the age where these things scare them and they understand that they aren't real. My Little Pony is now a classic to me and I am happy to share this with Paige. If you're like me and remember the movie from the eighties and even if you don't and just want to check out what the original was all about, this is a great movie to own.

I could have watched it over and over again.  I also loved playing with the My Little Pony toys and accessories.  However, now that I have two daughters of my own, watching this movie again was different.  It brought back feelings of nostalgia for myself, but I wasn't impressed with the attitudes and language of the characters.  The evil witches were especially evil and used violence and words like ""shut up"" and ""stupid"".  Now, I don't know if watching this as a child turned me into a brat or not, but I don't like to encourage my kids to use language such as this.  Especially at their young ages of 2 and 3.  How do you tell your kid, ""Don't say those words"" when they turn around and say, ""But they said that in the move, mom.""  Well then I guess we won't be watching that movie anymore.

But it was entertaining very much to her.  I watched it with her for the most part and have to say it was almost unbearable as an adult.  No reflection on the movie though.

I mean _anything_.

The animation quality is abysmal, the songs are painfully stupid and the entire film is a plug for the latest Hasbro merchandise. (Dream Castle is destroyed by Shmooze? And the ponies have to move into Paradise Estate? Which just so happens to be on the shelves of your local toy store at this very minute? Along with those cute baby ponies that were introduced in the film?) Ultimately though, those details weren't enough to stop me watching the movie through and basking in warm childhood memories of My Little Pony. And in fairness to My Little Pony: The Movie, consumers cannot reasonably expect that any current or latter-day movie or TV series based on a toy--a toy, for God's sakes--will be anything more than an extended advertisement compliments of the toy manufacturer.",1309046400,,944,4.75

I am in the latter category and I hadn't seen the movie in probably 10+ years. I watched it and still enjoyed it, though I can say that there are flaws to the movie. It is silly at times and has some weird elements (the Smooze is pretty weird) but I would say that overall, it's still a fun movie to watch. Like most of the cartoons from that era, it tries to teach a lesson, and for that reason I think it is worthwhile to share with a child or to watch if you used to love it.

This movie also has a star-studded cast, including Danny DeVito, Madeline Kahn (who I love), and many others that you may recognize by their voices. All these stars for a pretty cheap price is a bargain to me. If you don't read into the movie too much, it's a very cute and fun flick.",1228435200,,892,3.901098901098901

It'll probably fit into your budget, and it's a fresh new way to view the MLP Movie (it's remastered and looks/plays great). If you want the MLP Movie for your own DVD collection, look no further than Amazon.com! It makes a good gift for an MLP fan as well. Here is more specific info:

PROS:
-Definitely loved the movie itself. It's cutesy and the villains are entertaining and funny
-Megan's siblings are in full effect! Plus Baby Lickety-Split is a character, haha
-It's a great way to play the movie, even better than the best VHS versions
-The plot is amazing; the Smooze is after the little ponies and they're working hard to save their home
-The Moochick is a hoot, as always, and a big help
-Fizzy is the most energetic and exciting pony to watch of them all!
-I absolutely LOVE Wind Whistler and North Star, who each deliver magnificent performances
-I love Spike's appearance, and the Grundles
-Wonderful music, especially ""I'll Go It Alone,"" ""Nothing Can Stop the Smooze,"" ""What Good Will Wishing Do?"" and ""Home."" Not to mention the opening and closing themes

CONS:
-Baby Lickety-Split is a brat, unable to see how selfish she is
-Gusty does have a little bit of an attitude (even BEFORE she gets Smoozed) and Shady is too cynical for me. I also didn't like Sweet Stuff after she was Smoozed
-Rosedust was too quick to brush off the little ponies at first
-Miscellaneous ponies do show up at weird times. When Megan, Molly, Danny and the others go for the Flutter Ponies, they show Buttons but she isn't supposed to be with them

Overall, you won't be disappointed at all with this purchase -- I definitely recommend it!",1220313600,5,1772,4.60126582278481

I remember watching this when I was a kid and now have something that I can pass on that was ""classic"".  The animation is a little off, just for the reason that it's older and it was out before digital animation became available.  Although, I would have loved to have seen them put this out on DVD digitally remastered.  Unfortunately, they did not, so we are forced to deal with the sometimes choppy animation.

Despite the fact that some of the ponies acted stubborn and bratty, they all come together in the end and make an example of what positive thinking and working together can do.

434182,4,630203535X,"Althought I am a highly nostalgic person and would love, LOVE to have this movie on DVD, I must say that the animation is no where near the quality of the pilot episodes.  Granted, this is probably because the pilot episodes (""Midnight Castle"" and ""Escape From Catrina"") were animated in Japan while My Little Pony: The Movie and the series (""My Little Pony"" and ""My Little Pony Tales"") that preceeded and succeeded it were animated in the United States.

Still, if you're looking for a good movie for the kids and something you can watch with them (AND you're NOT one of those overprotective parents who thinks your kids will get scared of fictional witches, baby dragons, and/or purple smooze monsters) this is a pretty good film to purchase.  The colors are intriguing and will keep the kids smiling and glued to the tube while the voices, songs, and magic will make you want to stay, watch, and maybe even sing along, too.

The morals of the story will also teach your kids valuable lessons in perseverance, helping others, and having confidence in themselves!

So, in a nutshell, although the animation isn't the best, and characters that aren't supposed to pop up do anyway, the plot, colors, songs, and magic involved in this movie are great for the kids and nostalgic adults such as myself!",1163289600,2,1298,4.751111111111111

In the part about the smooze, when I heard nothing could stop it, I was so worried it would conquer Dream Valley. Later, when we met the Flutter Ponies, we found out they were the only ones that could defeat it.

434184,5,630203535X,"This is the very first MLP cartoon ever made. It was also the first one I ever saw, back in 1984.

The story starts out with Firefly and Medley flying down the rainbow, and all the little ponies playing. The fun of the day ends abruptly when the Strattadons (big, ugly, flying lizards) come and take away Cotton Candy and Moondancer. Firefly flies away to get help. She ends up falling into a well, and is pulled up by a girl named Megan (probably around the age of 12 or 13). She goes with Firefly to Ponyland to help the ponies.

Upon returning, the Strattadons come back and take Bubbles and Ember away. The ponies are being taken to Midnight Castle where the evil Tirac turns them into monsters with his Rainbow of Darkness, so they can pull his chariot.

Sandy Duncan is the voice of Firefly (the only pony to ever have a celebrity voice), and Tony Randall is the voice of the Moochick.

This special is included in the MLP First Season DVD box set, but it's been edited. I suggest you try to find a VHS copy of this, unedited, because it's really the greatest MLP cartoon ever made, and you really miss out on a great song called ""Little Piece of Rainbow,"" sung by the Moochick (Tony Randall).

Word of warning, I wouldn't recommend showing this special to very young children, due to the scary overtones. I saw this when I was a two year-old, but was never freaked out by it, but then again, every kid is different, so use your best judgement.",1145059200,4,1450,4.395522388059701

434187,4,630203535X,"Wow does this bring back memories!  This was probabely the one movie I was the most obessed with as a little kid.  I watched it constantly and acted it out with my own My Little Pony toys.  I bet my dad looks at this movie with dread now because I can't even count the times I made him sit thru it and play it out with me!  He probabely still remebers each line by heart!  ""The Snooz is coming! The snooz is coming!""  Silly..

Sadly when I tried showing it to children I babysit, they were not too impressed.  I suppose it was only good for children who grew up with it and the toys because the children I showed it to simply did not care about seeing the characters or even recognized them.  Seeing your favourite toy in a movie must have been its appeal when it was first released in the 1980s.

That doesn't mean those kids I showed it to didn't enjoy it completely though.  They liked the parts with those 2 bratty witches, and wanted to see my old My Little Pony collection.  I suppose it's simply going to be one of those movies that was only good during a certain time.  But what can you expect?  It was one of those movies born out of a popular toyline.

My Little Ponies are making a comeback now (and this time around they look cute, unlike their last comeback in 1997-1999), so this movie may interest those fans as well.  But for those who don't like the toys, it probabely won't.  Hence why I only gave it 4 stars.",1119052800,3,1427,4.1875

Beware of buying some ""rare"" items used, even here.  The copy I received was a bootlegged DVD made from the VHS.  The quality was AWFUL, absolutely unwatchable.  The audio was off significantly from the video.

It came in with very obviously photocopied box art, and actually said DVDR around the rim!

434201,4,630203535X,"The sun is shining brightly in Dream Valley as Medley and Firefly slide down the rainbow into the waterfall. Bow-Tie, Moondancer, Ember, and the rest of the ponies trot out of Dream Castle, eager to play. The tranquility of the moment is disturbed as black clouds roil across the sky. Huge green dragons, Striadons, under the command of the monstrous creature Scorpan, descend from the sky as the ponies leap to their hooves in alarm. .Far away, a young girl is grooming her pony T.J. when she sees what she thinks is a shooting star. But when something splashes into the well on the farm, she goes to investigate . . . and pulls up Firefly!
""Talking pony!"" the girl exclaims in surprise before introducing herself as Megan. Firefly examines a nearby cliff and decides that it's high enough for a take-off. ""You do know how to ride, I hope?"" she asks Megan, who indignantly replies, ""Of course I know how to ride!"" as she hops onto Firefly's back
Soon they arrive at Dream Castle and all the ponies run out to greet Megan. The moment is ruined when Striadons suddenly dive from the clouds; it's Scorpan's raiding party. One of the dragons catches Megan, but Firefly distracts it with her double-inside-out loop. Megan falls, but is caught and deposited on the ground by Scorpan, who tells her to leave because the battle is not hers. Megan shouts that Scorpan is a monster and takes a swing at him. Since the Striadons have caught two ponies--Bubbles and Ember--Scorpan begins the flight back to Midnight Castle. Megan, Firefly, and the other ponies are left to plan how to save their friends. Back at the castle, Tirak declares that Ember is too small for his purposes and has the guards lead her to the side. ""But you three will do . . . for now,"" he adds, aiming the mouth of the pulsating bag at the other ponies. ""Behold the power of DARKNESS!"" A stream of dark energy screams from the bag, surrounding the three ponies and transforming them into huge, dark dragons. Tirak orders Scorpan to find another pony by midnight . . . or Spike will die.

434202,4,630203535X,"I taped this movie from the Disney Channel, but my sister taped over my copy of it. This isn't the greatest MLP cartoon in the bunch (my favorites are ""Midnight Castle"" and ""Escape from Catrina""), but this one still had it's moments.
The Witches from the Volcano of Gloom create the Smooze to destroy the Little Ponies and their spring festival, so they have to go get the Rainbow of Light, but it ends up buried in the Smooze, and they have to go find the Flutter Ponies. Also, some of the other ponies search for Baby Lickety Split who has run away, with Spike the Dragon.
PROS:
The music and the songs are really good, I think. One of the best song numbers is ""I'll Do the Dirty Work"" sung by Reeka and Draggle. Every time I see this routine, I crack up, along with ""Nothing Can Stop the Smooze"" with the Smooze doing a little 1950's doo wop riff while the witches are singing. Another great song was ""There's Always Another Rainbow."" Not funny like the other two I mentioned, but still a great song.
The Moochick and his rabbit cracked me up. I love Tony Randall's voice of the Moochick better than whoever did him in the MLP TV series. It just seems funnier to me.
Any scene with the Grundles, especially when the Grundle King mentions Grundleland.
Keep your eyes open during any scene with Reeka and Draggle. You'll find little surprises along the way.
CONS (reasons why I give this a 4 rather than a 5):
A lot of the scene changes were a bit choppy and seemed to come so fast.
The paint job on this seemed a bit washed out.
Baby Lickety Split was a brat, and I didn't like Gusty's personality all that much, even BEFORE she got Smoozed.
I didn't particularly care for Buttons's, Lofty's, Baby Lickety Split's, or Sundance's voices. Having seen the MLP TV series before this movie, I think that explains it.
The end of the ""I'll Go it Alone"" song, because the animation was a little odd there.
In some scenes, there are ponies that aren't supposed to be there, and they mysteriously disappear later. Something comman in the TV series, too.
But other than the cons, this is a great movie. It's really very cute! You will not regret it if you buy it.",1084924800,33,2154,4.414572864321608
434203,5,630203535X,"Hi there!! I hope everyone is doing well.  I LOVE this movie and the TV Series.  I used to watch it all the time when I was little and I'm now twenty and still LOVE it.
Summary:  The witches from the volcano of gloom want to destroy the ponies spring festival, so they create the Smooze to devour ponyland.  Baby Lickety Split runs away after Buttons yells at her, and she is accompanied by Spike, a baby dragon.  They meet the Grundles who help them find their way back to Dream Castle.
Meanwhile, The smooze has gotten Gusty, who is very upset and Wind Whistler suggests they go to Megan for help.  Upon arriving at Megan's house, they meet Megan's little sister, Molly, who is seven and Danny, Megan's younger brother who is ten.  Molly is riding Megan's old pony, TJ, and successfully jumps a bail of hay with Megan snapping a picture proudly.  After the picture is taken, Wind Whistler explains the situation and Megan insists to help.  Danny wants to help too, as does Molly, who is very close to Megan and doesn't want to be left out.  They return to ponyland where the other little ponies are introduced to Molly and Danny.  Fizzy, who is a fun loving, easy going unicorn, takes to Molly instantly and vowels to take care of her for Megan.  Megan and the little ponies rush off to seek the Moochick's help after the smooze traps the Rainbow of Light and covers Dream Castle.  The Moochick tells them they need the help of the Flutter ponies who live in Flutter Valley.  He also gives them a new home, Paradise Estate.  After Megan who is accompanied by Fizzy and Wind Whistler, leave the Moochick, they return to Dream Castle to pick up the other little ponies, as well as Molly and Danny.  Molly hops on Fizzy, and Danny hops on Surprise.  After Megan hops on Wind Whistler they're off.
I don't want to give away anymore, but the movie ends on a very sweet and uplifting note.
Proes:
The movie teaches valuable lessons about faith and family and it also shows you more of Megan's home life and her family.  It shows that she will do anything and everything to protect Molly and Danny, along with the little ponies.  It also shows her being more stern with Molly and Danny when they fight, which I think is good considering, Megan was portrayed in the other two movies as being an only child and not very confident in herself, but with a sweet and nice personality.  There were also great songs and I loved the message of , ""There's Always Another Rainbow"".  I firmly believe that myself.  Always have, always will.
I also liked the fact that RoseDust, the Queen of the Flutter ponies, refused to help Megan and the others at first.  It gave the story more of a climax and it also gave viewers a reason to keep watching it.  The other reason I thought that part was good is because it taught the lesson of tolerance and helping others, even if they aren't like you.  Which in my opinion, is a very good lesson to learn.
Cons:
The smooze was plain useless.  It didn't have any characteristics or anything.  Meaning, usually when they have a villain, it speaks it's own mind.  This thing just took orders.  Boring!!",1070668800,11,3121,4.474336283185841
434204,4,630203535X,"This is one of my favorite animated movies of all time.  I recently rented it from blockbuster (I wish they had some of the other little pony movies) and fell in love with it again.  The smooze is attacking, something sent by the witches, and meanwhile baby lickity split has run away.  Alas, I had to give this a 4 instead of 5 because The freaky ""cute"" children make me want to ....

It has the big screen adventure of the G1 gang plus the cover art is really nice. However, I hate that they had to put the G3 logo there.
