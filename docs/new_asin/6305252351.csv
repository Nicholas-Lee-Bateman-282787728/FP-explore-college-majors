Sparks fly when the old-family Audrey gets together with the parvenu Richard  theres fun and fighting and romance in the English countryside!

I have been a fan of British comedy...well, for my entire life, and this show is one of the first I remember. Superbly written, with a great cast and lovely scenery, this is a great show, one that is sure to please the whole family. My family and I love this tape; in fact we have watched it more times than I can count. We all highly recommend this tape to you.

This tape contains three of the half-hour episodes:

No Room In The Lodge  Series 2, episode 2 (October 12, 1980)  Audrey has an old school friend coming over to visit, and she would appreciate it if Richard could put her up for the weekend. However, when the formerly overweight school chum shows up, she turns out to be thin, attractive, and on the prowl. Is Richard in her sights? Audrey had better move fast if she is going to avoid a disaster!

New Years Honours  Series 2, episode 5 (November 2, 1980)  Richards new efficiency drive means that the hedgerows of Grantleigh have got to go. Audrey organizes the local conservationists to stop Richard dead in his tracks. But, word soon reaches Audrey that a local someone is going to be mentioned in the New Years Honours List...Sir Richard de Vere and Lady de Vere? Hmmm.

Speedy Recovery  Series 2, episode 6 (November 9, 1980)  When Audrey injures her back her back, Richards comes over with chocolates and flowers. But, when he starts talking about a skiing trip to the Swiss Alps, Audrey sees her big chance.

By the way, if you liked this tape (and you will), then try to get Peter Spences novel of the same name. It is the basis for the show, but has some delightful differences!",1458518400,,2161,4.640419947506562
8545465,5,6305252351,"To The Manor Born is the finest comedy ever produced by the BBC.  In this Volume Audrey is at her upper crust best. Oh how I wish that all the episodes were available on video.  Grantleigh Manor with Richard DeVere and  Audrey fforbes-Hamilton are the tops when it comes to comedy with that  distintive British flavor. If you have not bought it yet, buy now.",940723200,3,358,4.461538461538462
8545466,5,6305252351,"Volume 4 contains some of the best of the best.  ""To The Manor Born"" stands out as the best there is in terms of every way of evaluating.  It is made up of carefully constructed scripts containing  crisp dialogue delivered with perfect timing by a group of high quality  actors that are perectly cast in roles that are uniquely supurb in the  carefully constructed character developemnt placed into the fascinating and  unfamiliar setting of the British Manor House.  These are delightful folks  living very special lives in very special circumstances.  This series give  us a wonderful opportuity to look through the windows of the Manor House  and behold ordinary life in the aristocracy, estate living,  and British  country life across all classes in the contemporary era.  The high  standards in every aspect of produciton yields the hilarious comedy that  keeps one laughing out loud even though one is alone and has seen it  before.  Once you have gotten to know these characters, you can't stay away  for long.  This is a series that I want to revisit over and over again.  It  is a pure delight for all manner of anglophiles.  I am so glad that it is  finally being released after all of this time.  Episode 11 gives us  a fascinating look at the colorful upper crust experience of the Hunt as  the background for a situation involving the reunion of Audry with one of  her ""old girl"" classmates from finishing school.  ""(In the  The Old Girls' News) I'm under 'Changes of Circumstance.'  'Since the death  of her husband, Audrey has left Grantly Manor and moved down the drive.'  They'll think I live in a pothole!""  Episode 12 involes the tension  between concern for preserving the enviornment and the need for change set  in the week after Christmas that includes elements such as the hedgerows,  the Estate's New Year's Eve Party and the New Year's Honors List.  ""Don't keep saying 'SIR Peter' like that.  You sound like an  American.""  Episode 13 deals with the issue of the National Health  system as Audry's back plunges her from the experience of private care into  the world ofsocialized medicine.  ""I've got a bad chill, I'm  afraid.""  ""COLD, Marjorie.  Only the Royal Family get chills.  What you've got is the common cold.""  This is one of my favorites in  the entire series.  I am already eagerly anticipating the release of  the rest of the series.  Although each episode is complete in its own  right, the characters and relationships develop through the course of the  whole series so that there is a oneness about the complete story.  The only  regret is that it ends!!!",918345600,4,2597,4.775
