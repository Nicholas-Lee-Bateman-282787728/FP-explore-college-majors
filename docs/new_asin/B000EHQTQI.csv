8110336,2,B000EHQTQI,"From what I understood the documentary would focus *ahem* on the exchange of guns for Nile Perch in Africa. I can count on one hand the statements made by people in the film on this important topic. An artist mentions a past episode that he heard on the radio...and it is never explored further. A pilot at the end mentions the possibility and offers some locations, a hint at how the exchange works...and it is never explored further. A reporter goes into detail about his written article (which is more in depth than this feature length documentary apparently) for a few minutes. Other than that, about one hour and 35 minutes of foorage of the Nile Perch community, which is interesting and sad in its bleakness, but not the subject of the documentary. What European group sells what arms to what groups?- this film won't go into any of that. Who is making money, who benefits - that is not explored. IMF and World Bank policy are mentioned in passing with no further investigation. All that money, where does it go, where does it come from- you'll have to rent something else for answers.",1401235200,2,1092,4.634020618556701
8110337,5,B000EHQTQI,"This film is phenomenal. By using the allegory of the predator fish Sauper hits the nail on the head as to how the dynamics of ""survival of the fittest"" affect our lives. The quote from the Ukrainian pilot sums it up: ""African kids get tanks and guns for Christmas, European kids get grapes"".

By showing how the unfair balance of trade locks people into poverty we are able to revisit the colonial past of every place that European business has touched. This story could have been the Spanish conquest of South America, the Dutch invasion of the far east/Indonesia or the story of North America.

Saupers gentle hand, softly, gently drawing out the story from real lives, takes us on an unforgettable journey with no easy answers or exits. Every player in the system only sees their part and only when the viewer pulls together the whole process of destitution does the horror become evident. The horror is that every one of us in involved in the same ecosystem of destruction.

What this documentary achieves is to expose the reality that has driven recent cinema blockbusters such as ""Lord of War"" and ""Syriana"". The medieval conditions of rotting fish dumps, where people fight for scraps of fish bones and brains (with maggots still crawling on them) should strike horror into the heart of every thinking person. How can it be that in these times, where the freight plane pilot scans through digital pics of his personal diary of family and terror, such scenes of primitive destitution play just under the surface.

Striking, stunning and the true horror of brilliant documentary exposure.",1142121600,24,1594,4.870848708487085
8110338,4,B000EHQTQI,"This documentary provides a dramatic reality check against the relative comfort in which most of us live.  Regardless of how you feel about world economics and globalization, one cannot help but be moved by the impact that turning Lake Victoria into a fish farm has had on the people of that country.

The filmmaker stubs his toe a bit in his effort to obtain an support for a local radical's assertion that the fish was being exchanged for weapons.  When he finally obtains an acknowledgment of the weapons trade from a pilot, it was to Angola, not Tanzania.  He would have done better to follow what happens to the money, especially after hearing the very leaders of the country ignore the evidence of environmental impact and assert that their only interest was in selling fish.

But his unsophisticated interpretation of the problem does not blunt the impact of the film.  The real story is in the faces and words of the local people.  One leaves a screening with a single question.  What are we doing to this world?",1142035200,13,1020,4.691011235955056
8110339,5,B000EHQTQI,"An avalanche of information from websites, newspapers, magazines, and even television helps us to know the effects of globalization.  But knowing that two million people in some far away region face starvation is not understanding even one who does.  Documentary filmmaker Hubert Sauper brings understanding through Darwin's Nightmare.

He leads us through Mwanza, a Tanzanian city on the shores of Lake Victoria with an airport.  Every day the largest cargo planes carry 500 tons of fish to Europe, an amount that could provide a half pound per day to the two million Tanzanians facing starvation at the time of filming.

Hubert takes us from knowing to understanding by interviewing a Russian pilot that wants all children of the world to be happy, but knows that he has taken African food to Europe and European weapons to Africa (""For Christmas Day, children in Europe got grapes and children in Africa got weapons."").  Hubert interviews a nightwatchman, who got the $1/night job because his predecessor was killed by thieves, and who welcomes war because then everyone could get a better paying job in the army.  He interviews the small children that live on the street with nothing but ragged shorts and t-shirts, and who melt the plastic from fish boxes for the mind-numbing fumes.

The camera is so close to the subjects and stays, peering across a nose at the lake beyond, that you feel as if you had all day to sit with these people and listen to their hopes and fears.  Interviews with an artist, a journalist, and several prostitutes flesh out the tragic cycles of natural resources leaving the very place they're needed because of some global economic calculus in which each person plays a small, unwilling part.

This is not the ""feel good"" movie of the year.  It is the ""feel"" movie of the year.  Hubert gives us a feeling and understanding of people every bit as warm and clever and loving as those with whom we share our table and our neighborhoods.  At a reception after the film showing, Hubert indicated that he hoped that ""understanding"" will push people to find out more and do more to address such injustices.

This review was based on a theater, not DVD, viewing.",1141862400,13,2187,4.828418230563003
