7846851,1,6303433944,The acting is pretty atrocious in this. The direction is just as bad.,1413504000,,69,4.384615384615385
7846852,4,6303433944,"Arlene Holsclaw (De Mornay) is the sad product of a very tragic upbringing. Her cab driver mom ""hooks"" on the side and as a child, ""Arlie"" witnessed these ""dates."" She was also an incest victim at age 12, attacked by a father (Swanson) who's now a drooling vegetable that mom (Burstyn) cares for, after her fashion.

It's no surprise then that Arlie also became a hooker at a young age, and did worse. The story opens with her on the run from prison, heavy with child, trying to hitchhike back home to a mother that wants nothing to do with her. Along the way she commits an armed robbery, killing a man in the process, and then goes into labor. Back in prison for a long stretch, Arlie signs papers naming her mom legal guardian of infant son Joey. Grandma gives the baby up for adoption, telling Arlie it's a temporary foster care situation.

Released and closely monitored by a stone-hearted parole officer (Bugden), Arlie, now ARLENE, has, with previous mentoring from a kindly prison chaplain, found Jesus. She vows to put her life together, get a good-paying job, fix up a ratty apartment and then reclaim her son. The return of Joey's father (Knepper), who doesn't even know he has a child, tempts Arlene to slip back into prostitution, for he was her pimp, but she tells him to get lost. All that matters is being reunited with a child she hasn't seen in eight years.

When Arlene discovers she no longer has any rights to Joey and that trying to see him will get her parole revoked, she starts to spiral downward toward what appears to be reincarceration, or worse. With no support from a hateful mother, a lover who just wants to peddle her services, a parole officer whose untimely intereference causes Arlene to lose a decent-paying job, and a chaplain (Jenkins) she relied on for spiritual guidance and inspration forbidden by law from seeing her now that she's on the outside, Arlene has an emotional breakdown that may destroy any chance for a happy, productive life.

It's easy to get swept up in this troubling TV drama, thanks to De Mornay's excellent performance. A ""que sera, sera"" conclusion is perhaps its only flaw. Recommended.

7846854,5,6303433944,"I agree with the other reviews! A great choice of roles and an exceptional performance by Ms. DeMornay! I'm a guy but I think everyone can relate to this movie in some kind of way. To me this was a movie about reaching inside yourself and finding an inner strenghth to carry on despite what happened yesterday. But in this case it was really tough because we have a woman who wanted her child,not ""throw it away"" like some people do! I admire ""Arlene for trying on her own even though she got involved with the wrong kind of guy-she could have latched on to another guy for security,like some women do,but she went on her own. She made a mistake but pressed on. Her mother and father were an example of how grownups forget what it's like to be little and were selfish,child molesters and women and children beaters should get life in prison without parole because the victims sometimes never recover and are sentenced to their own prisons. Arlene reached inside herself and had some help from a friend! An excellent movie and agreat performance by Ms.deMornay-her best role and performance! If you can't find it at Amazon.com rent it and maybe Amazon.com will get some more copies! That's all folks!",1026345600,5,1199,4.633802816901408
7846855,4,6303433944,"Rebecca De Mornay plays Arlene, a woman getting out from a prison after eight years. Now she wants to start a new life with her son, who was taken from her after he was born. But things turn out more difficult than she had expected. It doesn't get better by her mother's attitude and that she (the mother) refuses to see she made mistakes and admit she knew Arlene was molested by her father as a child.
Rebecca De Mornay is one of the greatest and most underrated actresses of our time and she makes a wonderful job portraying Arlene, a woman like any other, but who has been though lots of difficulties. Ellen Burstyn is good as the mother and Carole Mitchell-Leon as her new neighbor, Ruby. The music is good and the movie is well written and feels very true, very real. It's one of Rebecca's best movies and, unfortunately, one of her least well known. More people should get the chance to see this beautiful movie. I recommend you to see it!",1011484800,7,946,4.411428571428571
7846856,5,6303433944,"I liked this movie because it showed a side of women I never thought of before,a woman who made a mistake,(who's perfect),and because of parents who didn't value her as a kid,she pays a high price. She really wanted to be a mother but couldn't, alot of women have been placed in similar situations by ""tough guys"" and selfish family members in real life! I thought Rebecca DeMornay was excellent as usual!",984441600,,405,4.638888888888889
7846857,4,6303433944,GETTING OUT is one of those rare TV movies that are actually good. Rebecca DeMornay returns to her hometown upon release from prison. The film depicts  her strained relationship with her mother & the confronting of the  past. DeMornay's character had been molested as a child by her father whom  is now an invalid. Ellen Burstyn portrays her sleazy mother and they are  both amazing in there roles.,966211200,5,398,4.8088235294117645
