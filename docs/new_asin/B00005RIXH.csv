1655890,5,B00005RIXH,"I've been doing yoga everyday for about many years and like to use a variety of styles (Ashtanga/Power, Total Yoga Flow and more Gentle routines as well). I've also got quite a large collection of videos (over 60) that I rotate depending on how my energy level is so I feel got a pretty good basis for comparison.
 Of the Yoga Zone videos I have this is definitely one of the more challenging one's that I've done. It is comprised of two 20 minute routines each of which can be used as a complete routine or combined together if you like.
 I would say that this is NOT for beginners but those with more experience doing yoga. Also, and this is very important, I would not try doing this video without doing some warmups first. I do a series of Sun Salutations (about 3 half salutes (gradually working myself lower), 2 lunge salutes, then one salutation A and B) before doing either of these routines. Another way you could warm up is to do Rodney Yee's AM Yoga for beginners which takes about 15 minutes but should open you up enough. Of course this certainly extends the length of time but I think many people could get hurt if they aren't warmed up before doing either of the routines on this tape (The second routine in particular is very intense on the lower body, particularly the hips and hamstrings which could get injured if not warmed up first).
 Also, there is no relaxation at the end so you'll need to add that at the end (and I'd surely recommend at least a short relaxation to let yourself integrate the routine).
 I really like the Yoga zone tapes, particularly the ones that have the 20 minute routines because I like to alternate various tapes each day to have variety and work the body in different ways (and levels of intensity). In fact I liked their tapes so much that I ordered the 5 pack basics set to have more of their routines to throw into the mix.
 If you want challenging and yet relatively short Power Yoga type routines I would highly recommend Rodneys Power Yoga For Beginners 3 pack, particularly the Flexibility and Stamina tapes (the 3rd, Strength is definitely more for intermediate level students). These tapes do warm you up much better and are very balanced routines and yet only take about 25 minutes or so.
  Another series I'd recommend is by Rainbeau Mars called ""Sacred Yoga"". It's a four tape set in a vinyasa flow style called ""Sacred Yoga"". The first two tapes are more gentle ""For Beginners"" and ""Pure Tranquility"" and the last two are more challenging ""Pure Power"" and ""Pure Sweat"". These are highly recommended also and are about 30-35 minutes long!
 I hope this helps :)

1655891,4,B00005RIXH,"This DVD comprised 2 20min sessions, the second one is a little more challenging than the first. The instructor takes you through a series of moving poses, warrior poses, forward and side bends and lunging poses just to name a few.
There's not a whole lot of instruction about how to position properly yourself in the pose, especially there is no instruction about how to position your feet properly for the warrior poses (I've done beginner iyengar yoga and you learn where to place your feet and how much to angle your foot in.)
But, the instructor does give a modified version of the poses which is great if you aren't all that flexible yet, and you don't need any props.
I've been doing the sessions one after the other. After the first session, I'm usually just sweating very lightly, but by the end of the second session, I've developed a good sweat. Afterwards I feel warm and relaxed and stretched out.
I really enjoy this DVD. I don't think it would be challenging enough for intermediate to advanced people but a beginner with a little knowledge should get a nice workout.",1021161600,22,1082,4.640625
1655915,5,B00005RIXH,"This was the first yoga tape I ever bought and it was a great introduction. I could follow the workout even as a newbie to yoga and grow with it. I find that as I'm building strength, I'm putting more into the workouts and getting more out of them.",1153267200,3,248,4.081632653061225
1655916,5,B00005RIXH,You just can't go wrong with Yoga Zone. I wanted a little more challenging routine for my morning workout and this is perfect. Thanks Yoga Zone for creating another quality workout.,1144627200,2,181,4.870967741935484
1655917,4,B00005RIXH,I use this DVD as a cardio substitute when I cannot do my regular cardio exercise.  It has 2 20-minute sessions that could be done separately or together as I do them.  The tape elevates the heartrate and keeps it elevated during the entire two sessions.  Jean was very easy to follow and the poses flowed together very well.  Ackward Chair and Ski Chair poses were a challenge and the thighs get a good workout with all the balancing poses she does. You can make this workout as hard as you want just by changing how deep you go into the poses.  Modifications to each pose were always mentioned.  I thought session 2 was harder than session 1 but that could be because my thighs were already tired from doing the first session or because session 2 are all standing poses.  I highly recommend this tape to anyone regardless of experience or flexibility.  It was fun and provided a good alternate workout in a short amount of time.,1122336000,5,930,4.494047619047619
1655918,3,B00005RIXH,"This dvd is challenging to someone who does cardio and weights about 2x a week, but only because it is a good muscle workout, especially if you do all 40 mins.  It is NOT, however, a good aerobic workout.  Also, the instructor is incredibly annoying in my opinion.  She speaks almost in monotone, as if it was very hard to memorize the script and she can't make the effort to be natural.  More importantly, the workout itself is extremely repetitive and boring, which means I never use it.  For a more creative fat burning yoga tape, try Crunch Fat Burning Yoga.  I think the instructor in that tape, Sarah Ivanhoe, is far more appealing.  No yoga workout is going to be truly aerobic unless it's an hour long or more, but with the fat burning tape, at least i break a sweat if the room is warm.",1120608000,6,795,4.36734693877551
1655919,3,B00005RIXH,"this dvd is good stretching for body, working the leg and arm muscles and the lower back.  Not too effective for abs.  Trying look for a better one.  But it is a good introduction to yoga.",1067644800,3,188,4.166666666666667
1655920,4,B00005RIXH,"Wow.. now that's a workout.  I never thought I would ever sweat in a yoga class.  I have actually had comparable workouts in the gym.  The poses are show in two different abilities, which is good especially if you're a beginner.  I have no doubt that if you do this video often, along with a healthy diet, you'll lose weight and become stronger.  The only thing I really didn't like about this video was that there isn't a cool down period.  It says there is but it only consists of sitting on the floor, then that's the end.",1058140800,12,525,4.3061224489795915
1655921,5,B00005RIXH,"For yoga, this really makes you move and does built heat and increase your heart rate. I got into Yoga as something different from aerobics but quickly realized it does not replace cardio - it supplements it. This workout, though, does what it promises - as well as being relaxing, it also really works you out. I consider myself to be in the best shape of my life and can get through an entire hour of kickboxing and still think this is a good supplemental (or even a good light-day full workout).",1053388800,8,498,4.423913043478261
1655922,3,B00005RIXH,"The sequences move quickly.  This is ""supposed"" to help you create heat and burn fat.  This isn't for those new to Yoga.  The workouts are short which is good, but there is a lot of movement within the poses. Overall, an ok DVD. By the way, the scenery does nothing for the workout itself.",1050451200,4,289,4.314814814814815
1655923,5,B00005RIXH,"This was my latest purchase in the hunt for a great yoga tape library and it was a great reward. I have been in search of a good flow routine and this gives you two 20 minute routines. You can do them on their own or combine them and get that wonderful fatigue from pushing yourself. The instructor has a great voice and explains the positions well. A beginner could do this as there aren't any difficult positions, but you must have strength in your legs to keep up. A great find.",1047513600,8,481,4.239130434782608
1655924,3,B00005RIXH,"After using several other yoga videos, I found this one to be a little boring and unmotivating. The instructor is very well educated/trained in yoga, and gives detailed directions for getting into positions, and excellent breathing instruction. It doesn't go through very many different poses, though.  Instead, they do a pose, hold it a long time, then add a new component and do it again, and so forth. Good challenging level -- I can certainly see how these moves would burn plenty fat! There are 2 segments on the DVD...one more challenging than the other...but both lack enthusiasm and encouragement, and are focused on specific instruction and explanation, rather than providing an element of relaxation and supportive dialogue, so that the viewer will look forward to tomorrow's workout.",1043107200,9,794,5.203125
7952501,5,B00005RIXH,I have over a period of time bought all the Yoga Zone DVD'd that I could find! I would love to find more of them! It is pleasant to workout in my own home with these instructors! They are very easy to follow and you take your time and listen to your own body until you can to them fully! I recommend them whole hearthily!,1459382400,,321,3.953846153846154
7952502,5,B00005RIXH,"So far, the best yoga DVD I've used is this one. It's informative and challenging. After each session (there are two two-part sessions) you feel yourself gaining strength. After practice with this DVD, your form improves greatly. The narrator/instructor offers modifications for each challenging pose if you don't yet have the strength  to complete them. This DVD is an excellent tool for the practice of yoga and it's easier to follow than many other workout DVDs as the moves aren't complicated. Lastly, I appreciate the two poses I learned from this Yoga Zone, as I hadn't encountered them previously on my yoga journey.",1421884800,,623,5.048543689320389
7952503,5,B00005RIXH,the first yoga routine on this DVD is my favorite.  One you can still do even if you aren't in great shape but easily made more challenging as your strength improves.  the instruction is clear and easy to follow and don't we all wish we could be doing yoga on the beautiful beaches of Sans Souci in Jamaica?,1419984000,,307,4.275862068965517

7952506,4,B00005RIXH,"You won't break a sweat unless you weigh 400lbs.  I'm 5'9"" and about 210, so I'm not skinny.  I also had a space heater on, and I STILL didn't break a sweat.  I would consider myself an advanced beginner.  It is, however, a nice way to do some stretching at the end of the day, so for $4 it was worth it.

If you want something more challenging, but still accessible to beginners, try Element's Hatha and Flow Yoga for Beginners",1353888000,,428,4.234567901234568

7952508,4,B00005RIXH,"I have been moving and thus got out of my routine of practicing yoga at home - I wanted something that was not too challenging, yet would help me jump start some conditioning as well as my overall flexibility. I like the laid back atmosphere created by the scene selection and the modifications she and a partner offer for certain exercises. A very nice moderately challenging workout for a more beginning/intermediate level. The added movements do turn up the heat and feel more aerobic - which has been instructional for me to explore how I can adapt my yoga practice to my particular needs of the day ...",1254355200,,607,4.62962962962963
7952509,5,B00005RIXH,This is a great CD both to tone the body and also it get's your heart rate up.  This DVD definitely works your glutes(buns).  This has two 20 minutes practices and it's great to do before work in the morning.  It's amazing what a short yoga session can do for you when it targets specific areas.,1199145600,,295,4.232142857142857
7952510,5,B00005RIXH,"This DVD was included with the 6 disc Ultimate Collection (which I highly recommend) and is my absolute favorite out of all the Yoga Zone DVDs I own.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that the instructor, Jean, can be a little mundane at times.  She can come off sounding scripted and even stumble over her words which I find amusing. She's not as engaging as some of the other instructors like Jen Monness but she gives you one hell of a ""tune-up""!!

When I began these sessions I had just finished a semester long yoga class in college (while supplementing with Yoga Sculpting on my days off) so my stamina/endurance was already pretty high.  I found the sessions to be a wonderful way to boost energy and immediately incorporated them into my daily yoga routine.

As with all the Yoga Zone DVDs, I appreciate the encouragement the instructors give to only go as far as you're comfortable while providing suitable alternatives to those who are not as limber.  They make sure you understand that breath and posture are major components of each pose (especially important for beginners).  They provide gentle reminders on how to breathe and when to breathe so that you can use your breath to better your technique and move deeper into a pose.

I'm ashamed to say I let myself fall out of practice.  Now that I'm turning back to yoga, this DVD is still by far my favorite.  I'm not as strong as I used to be so I find that the poses challenge me.  I really do feel myself ""building heat,"" I break a sweat now and I can feel my heart rate increase.  I enjoy the second session which focuses entirely on posture, breath and leg strength.  Unlike exercise, which can leave you feeling drained, I feel refreshed and energized.  For something to open my eyes in the morning, it beats out Starbucks any day!",1199059200,2,1808,4.540123456790123
