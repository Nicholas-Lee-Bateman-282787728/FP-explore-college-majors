8653602,4,B00JRO3FMA,"Don't come to this 53 minute ""documentary"" - ""directed and edited"" by British filmmaker Tony Palmer in the 1970s and just making it's home video release - expecting a unbiased story. Nearly all the dialogue is by Playboy Founder and Editor Hugh Hefner as Palmer's cameras follow him while he works and ""plays"". It's almost as if Hefner wanted to make a autobiographical film and hired Palmer to do it.

Because the film was made in early- to mid- 1970s, we see Hefner and his magazine at the peak of their success. Home video had not become common and so it was men's magazines that were the main source of adult entertainment for men. The Playboy Clubs were in full swing. There were offices in Chicago and the Mansion in LA. And Hef bought the biggest private jet, painted it black and called it the Big Bunny.

The film - taken in context for the time period - is  interesting - though, as I said, a bit one-sided. We learn a bit about his beginnings and his work habits too. And , yes, we see lots of women. For the first 20 minutes or so all the playmates are wearing bikinis but - as the film proceeds, the women are shown topless.

Palmer does a strange thing with the soundtrack to this film. With the exception of the theme used for Hefner's TV show ""Playboy After Dark"", all the music is classical with music by Copeland, Walton, Ravel and Wagner, among others. Guess that cuts down the music licensing fees, eh?

Palmer's films are eclectic - to say the least - but for anyone who has followed Playboy's rise (and fall) this is a film worth watching once. The package has a 4-page pamphlet with quotes from the film and a few photos.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
