2168727,5,B00065EB0Y,My son loves all the Baby Genius dvds...  I especially love the ones w/ classical music because they put him to sleep. (He's 2),1236902400,,127,4.291666666666667
2168728,3,B00065EB0Y,"Like all the Baby Genius I think it is good, it should be rated for younger children as an 18 month old get's a little bored with it, they prefer the sing alongs much better and this one seems to bore her.",1172361600,2,205,3.9047619047619047
2168736,2,B00065EB0Y,Not enough music and singing. Didn't compare to other learning music dvd's. This was not what I expected at all.,1390867200,,112,4.65

2168738,2,B00065EB0Y,"I love this series (in some ways more than the other, more popular baby dvd series), but we have trouble playing this particular DVD -- not because of any physical defect with the disc, but because the onscreen DVD menu is so poorly authored. Once we actually get the  video to play it's very nice, but it can be frustrating to get it to that point.",1384300800,,349,4.287878787878788
2168739,5,B00065EB0Y,"The kids love them, can't figure out why.  Not important they were for the kids and the love the, not me.",1372550400,,105,4.0
2168740,3,B00065EB0Y,"This wasn't my favorite Baby Genius DVD and not as exciting as the other ones, but educational as the classical music is beautiful, and both music and DVD scenes are so calming and soothing after a busy, active day for toddlers.  Our daughter uses it to rock our grandson as he takes his bottle before bedtime.",1371513600,,310,4.535714285714286
2168741,4,B00065EB0Y,my 5 month old loves these videos and I don't feel guilty about having her watch them because they are educational,1361836800,,114,4.476190476190476
2168742,5,B00065EB0Y,"We have several of these Baby Genius CD's. She really likes them, they are fun gigles; she tries to sing along and has learned many common nursery rhymes.",1356652800,,154,4.535714285714286
2168743,5,B00065EB0Y,"We have purchased several Baby Genius DVDs for our granddaughter.  Since we provide weekly day care, these videos have been very helpful with keeping her entertained when she's not playing or napping.  Baby Genius products are definitely worth the cost.",1354492800,,253,5.3
2168744,5,B00065EB0Y,I was a music major in college and I work from home. I love listening to this music in my background knowing my kids are being entertained and exposed to the classics. Be assured these arrangements are original and not presented using childish instrumentation.,1325203200,3,260,4.931818181818182
2168745,2,B00065EB0Y,"""Same complaints I had about the Under Water Adventure DVD. It played classical music and showed no real children or activities. Did not keep the attention of my 17-month old. What she enjoys most about the Baby Genius videos is the singing and the real children acting/dancing. I pulled this out after 5 minutes and put in Baby Genius Children's Songs.""",1305158400,,354,4.819672131147541

8038845,5,B00065EB0Y,"The entire Baby Genius DVD line is basically heroin for toddlers, without any of the adverse health or economic effects.

Look, I'm no fan of plopping my kid in front of the TV. But you know those times where you begin to seriously entertain the thought of throwing yourself off the roof of your house to escape the madness? This DVD is for that. Without fail, it will render your child slumped over, slack jawed, in awe, silent. But instead of a life-destroying narcotic coarsing through their veins, they have beautiful classical tomes from all the greats ringing in their ears.

This is the most important commercial product in America.",1427587200,6,639,4.8

8038848,5,B00065EB0Y,"I bought this for my grand daughter 10 years ago knowing the value of classical music, and she loved it. I am a Pre-school teacher who now is a In-Home Family Day Care Provider. When she would join my group as a 4 year old I would play the audio cd of Vivaldi's Four Seasons as the children would do their work from time to time. She very happily would tell me ""oh my baby music!!!"" I now play the VHS tape for the 17 month old toddler I am caring for and she loves it!! She verbalizes what is to come next!!!!! I started showing it to her at about a year. I love it!!!!!! It is part of my magic I have here at my ""COTTAGE""",1404432000,,623,3.875
8038849,5,B00065EB0Y,"Not the typical teaching video, as with the other excellent videos of Baby Genius, but rather entertaining and my 2 year old watches all of these over and over, not as annoying to parents a a lot of childrens videos played over and over. The Baby Genius people did a real good job with this.",1401926400,,291,4.3090909090909095
