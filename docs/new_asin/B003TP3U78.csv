Spinal Tap-This is Spinal Tap: Up to 11 25th anniversary Edition (DVD)

As Spinal Tap returned in 2009 with the One Night Only World Tour and that led to a window for the release of an updated set of their seminal 1984 rockumentary (i.e. farce). This is Spinal Tap: Up to 11 25th anniversary Edition is a 3 disc DVD that does not leave any stone (henge) unturned in a mockery of heavy metal. The original film weds hilarious dialogue, rock n toll tomfoolery and visual comedy gold as Ricky Gervais, Martin Freeman and Eddie Izzard offer their approval. The bonus material is perhaps one disc too many on the quality front-but, as mirthful, musical merchandise goes please make a visit to this font of fun. Far tastier than a Shark (or S**t) Sandwich turn this Tap up to One Louder!",1460678400,2,827,4.530201342281879
