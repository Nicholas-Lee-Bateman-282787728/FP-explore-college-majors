8362650,5,B000AZ6LSU,"This is the 17th Lupin III TV special that aired in 2005.  The title is in my heading.  Why someone decided people would buy this without knowing what it is is beyond me, but there you have it.  Seriously, as of this date there are 25 TV specials and counting.  Let's get a bit more specific.

I found this movie to be highly entertaining and had everything I love about Lupin III in it.  Great characterisation, wild action, crazy situations, genuine humour, some drama and pathos.  The opening sequence with the Lupin Gang escaping from Area 51 is worth the price of admission alone.  The animation was good, the pacing was solid, and each main character had some time in the spotlight.

If you are a Lupin III fan and you know any Japanese, I can't recommend this enough... but make sure you do know some Japanese.  This is a Japanese import disc and has nothing on it for a non-Japanese audience.  There is no English language track, no subs, no nothin'.  Very thin on the extras, too.  Just promo trailers and that's all.",1400544000,,1026,4.510869565217392
