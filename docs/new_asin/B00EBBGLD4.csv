5901056,5,B00EBBGLD4,"Excellent. I was sweaty for the ten minutes. Very easy to follow, no crazy dance moves, very mild jumping motions.",1404777600,6,114,4.75
5901057,5,B00EBBGLD4,"I did 4 lf the exercises last night. I usually do intermediate on all my work outs. I didn't realize how out of shape my arms are. talk about burning... the best part, I don't feel to sore today :) I do recommend this.",1398470400,10,218,3.977272727272727
5901058,5,B00EBBGLD4,"The best part of this is that each segment is only 10 minutes, so I don't get bored, yet I get a good workout. I do the 5-minute warm-up, 2 of the 10-minute segments (usually upper body and core), and the 5-minute cool-down 3 times a week; I walk the other 4 days. Each segment shows the 3 levels (beg., int., dif.), so you can mix and match, according to your abilities for that particular exercise. I am over 60 and have some issues, but this is a great, doable challenge.",1392249600,23,474,4.21978021978022
5901059,5,B00EBBGLD4,"I just purchased this and found the workout very enjoyable yet challenging.  Good instruction, various levels of difficulty and the freedom to do as many workouts as you like and in the order you choose.  I have a few of her other videos and enjoy this instructor.",1392076800,13,264,4.595744680851064
5901060,5,B00EBBGLD4,I attend Weight Watchers and these DVD's and fitness gear items are great and keep me motivated.  I've said good-bye to 130 pounds thus far!!,1433980800,6,141,4.64
5901061,4,B00EBBGLD4,"The reason I bought this kit was because it came with the bands, which are good quality, and because there were short exercises that I could mix and match.  I use the band with Gilad's workout videos now too.  Hopefully they never break and cause a Harry Reid type of injury.

There are also three levels which is nice. I injured my back so I wanted to be able to have a routine that included clear easy alternatives and this one does. Now that my back is getting better I've moved up to levels 2 and even 3 in some instances. They are challenging enough to make me work up a sweat, so I'm happy with that.

My only complaint is that the instructor has a pretty thick southern accent and says ""awesome"" too much.  But the routines are good and she has the smoothest transitions during the warm-up and cool-down than any other I've tried.

I bought this at Costco at a much better price. The problem with that is they only sell exercise DVDs/equipment around January 1.  Like we don't want to exercise the rest of the year or something.",1429315200,,1035,4.359375
5901062,5,B00EBBGLD4,Great workout! Love how you can change your routine daily for long or short workouts. Challenging but easy enough for a beginner and quickly see results!,1428883200,,153,4.923076923076923
5901063,4,B00EBBGLD4,"Great workout using the bands.  I am quite sure that with steady use of this workout, I will be toned up in no time.  Easy to follow.",1425945600,,133,3.888888888888889
5901064,5,B00EBBGLD4,"Great video! So much better than the 15 minute boot camp. The interval training and total body workout are great. The core, upper & lower body workout are good too. I usually do 2 of these and it works you out. I am a runner so these are great on days when running is not possible.",1422748800,,281,4.035714285714286
5901065,4,B00EBBGLD4,"I bought this workout because I don't normally like workouts with bands--working with bands seems so much harder than dumbbells. But if something feels hard, then you need to work at it more. I enjoyed the workout--it hits all major muscle groups, and the three levels portrayed make this workout do-able for everyone. I am a high intermediate exerciser, and while I mostly stuck with level 3 (intermediate), I at times followed level 3 (advanced), and for some of the more challenging moves I dropped down to level 1. I have many, many workouts, but believe I will reach for this often. The cardio section really does get your heart rate up with interval moves. Four stars instead of five as I think most of the standing core moves are a waste of time. Other than that, a great workout for all.",1421193600,2,795,4.605633802816901
5901066,5,B00EBBGLD4,it work but u have to be consistent with it very awesome,1420070400,,56,3.75

5901068,5,B00EBBGLD4,"Love doing this tape and working with bands.  This workout really ""works"" into my schedule.",1405209600,2,91,5.066666666666666
5901069,3,B00EBBGLD4,"It's OK, but definitely not for a beginner -- very fast paced.  But I do use the cords every day, so the cost wasn't a total loss.",1405036800,4,130,3.814814814814815
8603432,4,B00EBBGLD4,"This is a nice beginner friendly or bring back into the swing of things workout. I must warm you though, you must watch it through first because they go from one exercise to the other assuming you already know that steps.",1525564800,,221,4.414634146341464
8603433,5,B00EBBGLD4,"Injured my leg this summer & wanted a DVD that was low impact, but made you feel like youve actually exercised. Have another Stephanie Huckabee DVD and was impressed & thought I would try this one. She doesnt take you through a high-intensity routine, but you still feel like youve gotten a good work out. Stephanies style is not annoying & her cueing is very good. Although the programs are only 10 mins each, I like the fact that you can design your own workout each time you use the DVD and put a few programs together. Dont get this if you're expecting a sweat-producing workout, but do not hesitate if you want something low-impact that makes you feel like youve actually done something!",1520035200,,692,4.588709677419355
8603434,3,B00EBBGLD4,In response to the expired coupons. I bought this at Ollies the end of March and a lot of the boxes said coupons may be expired. This is probably why they were at Ollies.,1491177600,,170,4.029411764705882
8603435,1,B00EBBGLD4,ITS a rip off... coupons out of date... Was going to use them and can't Shame on you. 10 minute work out on DVD its 84 minutes. Bought being overweight and basic is a challenge. I wound NOT suggest to anybody. took photo of expired date.,1489104000,,237,4.173913043478261
8603436,5,B00EBBGLD4,"I love these videos and have been able to incorporate them into my weekly routines! I like the 10 minute segments, low-impact nature of the workouts, and how you can customize/combine the workouts for days when your short on time or want to do a little bit more. Before this video, I was never a big fan of workout videos. I thought they were boring and it was hard for me to get motivated with any. I bought a TON!! this is the first one I've actually enjoyed and I look forward to doing it.",1487721600,,492,4.189473684210526
8603437,4,B00EBBGLD4,"I lost 220.4 pounds and having kept it off for over 7 years on the Weight Watchers.  But was hesitant about buying this kit.  But the first time I tried it, I was hooked.  Mainly because Stephanie brings her ""The FIRM"" experience to the workout.  Some of the moves including four limbs, abduct, zumba in the cool down and a few others I recognized from her ""The FIRM"" workouts.  Plus, I wanted to learn how to do workouts featuring a resistance cord since I some another resistance cord kit in which it is not used that much, ""Debbie Siebers' Slim Series Express""!  Variety is key towards maintaining a healthy lifestyle!",1476144000,,621,4.6
8603438,1,B00EBBGLD4,"The instructor does not demonstrate how to do the different moves before the workout starts. She moves far too quickly too the moves to pick up how to do perform a move before going on to the next one. I would eventually pick up on what to do, but it frustrated me and I really don't use this exercise video. My husband and I took up bike riding, which is far more enjoyable!",1470614400,4,375,4.1506849315068495
8603439,2,B00EBBGLD4,"The CD didn't work on my laptop. Can't figure out why not. The cords are great. A co-worker loves her work out and recommended it to me. Due to health issues, I didn't get to it right away. Oh well....probably too late for a return",1469145600,,231,4.155555555555556
8603440,5,B00EBBGLD4,Great routines. Clever use of warm-up and cool-down segments.,1446595200,2,61,5.888888888888889
8603441,5,B00EBBGLD4,Best ever. Only wish you could find in more places.,1439424000,,51,4.2
