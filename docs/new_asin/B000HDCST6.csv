2634540,5,B000HDCST6,I do this workout often.  I like it so much I ordered another one in case something happened to the one I already had.,1258416000,,118,3.9166666666666665
2634541,4,B000HDCST6,this arrived from the usa in the time specified and  in good condition it is a very useful tape and works the body really well,1251590400,,126,4.04
2634542,5,B000HDCST6,Great workout for pilates and music lovers.  Instructions are easy and can be easily modified for advanced level.  I have used it everyday since I bought it 2 weeks ago and I can already tell a difference.,1249171200,,205,4.513513513513513
2634543,4,B000HDCST6,"This is a great workout, but easy enough for a rather uncoordinated person to keep up!",1239753600,,86,4.4375
2634544,5,B000HDCST6,"There are 2 parts to this video, dance and pilates mat workout. I'm not much for pilates, but the dance portion is the most fun workout video I've ever had in my life! Mari made such a professional video and it's easy enough to get the hang of the moves after the first 2 or 3 workouts. I would recommend this video to anyone looking to shape up or slim down. I'm also looking for something similar to the dance portion done my Mari,(although I love the dance, I need some variety!) but I can't find it anywhere! If someone finds a dance video they like, please post the answer! I've looked everywhere!",1236729600,,602,4.336283185840708
2634545,2,B000HDCST6,"I was disappointed in this because I love Winsor Pilates. I was hoping for a good workout. After about 25 minutes in I finally stopped and watched the rest because it was so boring! I'm not a super athlete so it's not like I am already in such fantastic shape, but this was just a bunch of pacing back and forth and jumping. And the music was corny. For the 25 minutes I did, it felt like a warm up the whole way through. It picked up the pace a bit more after I stopped, but still the moves seemed all the same. You can get a much better workout with any low-impact aerobics class or DVD.",1231891200,5,589,4.042735042735043
2634546,5,B000HDCST6,"I have been doing winsor pilates for 3 years and I can see the results!  Actually, within a few weeks of only doing 20 min. workouts 3 times a week, I had tighter abs and felt good about myself. Go Pilates!!!",1201132800,,208,4.073170731707317
2634547,5,B000HDCST6,"If you wanna lose weight then this DVD definitely if for you, I probably lost like 20 lbs. in three months from dieting and doing this, I mean that chick is a crazy [...], but that's good cause the workout makes you sweat and is intense when you first do it.. I definitely reccommend buying this cause you will not be disappointed!",1180483200,14,331,4.354838709677419
2634548,5,B000HDCST6,"If you want to workout and dance, this is the one.  The only time you are on the floor is for the cool down. Which I hate working out on the floor. One thing I really love about this workout is that you can go at your own pace.  If you need to slow down you can.  My kids, that are now 2, love to workout with me.  We all love it!!",1174608000,13,331,3.5555555555555554
2634549,5,B000HDCST6,"I had this DVD a long time ago, and I was so bummed when I found out that it cracked. When I found it on Amazon, I was overjoyed! And such a great price! Fast shipping too!",1383091200,,172,3.675675675675676
2634550,5,B000HDCST6,"this program works well, i definately recommend her technique. I saw results after the first week and with consistancy you will see a change in your body.",1380672000,,154,4.7407407407407405
2634551,5,B000HDCST6,"I've had this DVD since I was a sophomore in high school and it helped me to lose weight  and my DvD turned up missing so I ordered this one from amazon and I will say for the price this DVD is an excellent copy for one! I have always enjoyed this workout by Mari Winsor! She is an excellent I instructor who makes her workouts fun, easy and with the perfect amount of difficulty! I graduated from college last year and now a few years later this DVD doesn't even seem like it was made that long ago. It's a GREAT way to incorporate cardio and strength building in your workout and with in a month u will definitely see results. I have been working out and eating healthy for 2 months and I have lost 20 lbs and 3 inches in almost every part of my body (waist, hips, thighs, arms, and neck) I recommend it to those who r just starting a workout plan bc it's fun, has results, and it doesn't feel like u r workout bc of the music, and the movements incorporated together! I love this DVD so it's definitely a 5 star to me!",1370131200,,1021,4.079601990049751
2634552,4,B000HDCST6,"If you didn't realize previously - this is one disc originally sold in a set of DVDs, that taken all together, would give you a well-rounded introduction to pilates, plus some added variety of other types of workouts, as well. This disc would be more on the `variety day' end of that spectrum for the set.

If you came across it individually, as I did, this might seem less `pilates' than you expect - more Jazzercise, dance-aerobics style workout, for the entire first half. Only the `cool-down' ending portion will feature the mat based, intro pilates level exercises you may be expecting. If you have not had the basics of pilates, and do not know what she means by terms like ""keeping your powerhouse engaged"" or ""keeping your chest open"" or your arm movements controlled, you're probably not going to get much out of at least the first half of the aerobic part of the workout. As long as you understand how to place resistance on yourself and contract your core correctly, then you'll get more of a challenging workout during this part than it may seem. I was pleasantly surprised that this did include a safer duration warm-up period/stretching routine. Many work-out videos or classes speed past this.

I LOVED that they had live musicians, acoustic drummers, there performing live with them. I'd call it an Afro-Caribbean vibe (with the added guitar track skewing it towards the more Latin end of that genre). The first time around, if you're not following her verbal cues well, the drummers did a great job of matching their rhythm to the specific moves. I just started listening to them to know what to do and when.

As I said, this was closer to a Jazzercise class than I expected - so similarly, the routine was easy to modify to a low impact version, if you have impact/joint issues. I'd actually recommend this, as a stand alone, if you are curious about Zumba, but are afraid to just show up for a class because you have absolutely no latin dance background. Similar, but less complicated basic movements on here.",1364083200,,2028,4.707042253521127
2634553,5,B000HDCST6,This is not your typical pilates video.  There are two workouts on this video.  One is pilates on a mat like we are all used to but incorporates weights which is nice.  The other workout is pretty much zumba.  It's dancing.  I like both workouts and appreciate that they are short and don't have much talking or pauses.,1328659200,,319,4.431034482758621
2634554,4,B000HDCST6,"I LOVE this workout! I had the VHS tape, but when that finally wore out they no longer made them, so I had to order it on DVD.

The circle workouts are great too- especially for arms!",1299369600,,183,3.945945945945946
2634555,1,B000HDCST6,i have been a winsor pilates guru since before my teen years so when i came across this 'fat-burning' workout i was excited! i thought that it would add some versatility to my exercise routine but i didn't enjoy it from the first minute i started! i was so disappointed i didn't even try the 'maximum burn basics' workout...maybe its cuz im not the most choreographed person in the world but its not the moves but the pace that mari would go at...i feel that she doesnt give me enough time to transition into the next move and her explanation on how to carry out the next step is a bit lousy..i found myself just doing my own thing and dancing to the music! if you plan on getting it i hope you will have a better experience.,1286409600,2,725,4.260869565217392
2634556,1,B000HDCST6,I didn't like this dvd it was so boring that you didn't even want to do it. I like to have a workout that is fun and this one is far from it!!!,1283040000,,143,3.3636363636363638
2634557,4,B000HDCST6,Mari does a nice job making pilates fun and also effective.  I measured 1/2 inch taller at my dr. appt. because of her pilates!!  This video has 2 options - one is short and all floor work.  The other is long (about 45 min) and quite a cardio workout too.  Both get your heart pumping.,1280016000,,285,4.127272727272727
2634558,5,B000HDCST6,"I borrowed this DVD from a friend and was really surprised at what a great workout I got from doing the exercises.  I knew Winsor Pilates was a great workout but never knew just how good it was until I did it. I have always worked out but now I don't have time to go to the gym, this is an excellent replacement.  I ordered my own DVD and can't wait until I receive it in the mail.  In the meantime I will continue using my friends. I'm very excited about the transformation I have seen after just 4 days of doing the dvd.  My butt, abs, and arms ache which means the exercises are working.  I also purchased three other Winsor videos, can't wait.",1260576000,,647,4.144
8138688,5,B000HDCST6,"I really enjoy this workout. It's got an energetic pace going for it and you work up a good sweat. At least I sure do. I was hesitant at first in it being a 40 minute workout. But, I found I was able to keep up and complete it without any issues. My best wishes to Mari Winsor (she has ALS) and want to thank her for bringing Pilates to our attention and our lives. Thank You, Mari!",1522454400,,382,3.91025641025641
8138689,5,B000HDCST6,"Good Pilates DVD. The case had initials written on it, but it doesn't bother me. The short version of the workout does have a mistake in it. Mari instructs the people to begin the single leg circles, but then it cuts to them beginning another exercise. Still a great workout for being so short. Convenient to do during a lunch break.",1444003200,,333,4.475409836065574
8138690,5,B000HDCST6,I love Winsor Pilates..  Received this video in no time at all!,1438646400,,63,4.25
8138691,5,B000HDCST6,I had this dvd years ago and went down a whole pant size after doing this ten days in a row. So excited to get this in the mail and get started again!,1434412800,2,150,3.5757575757575757
8138692,5,B000HDCST6,"I used this workout video years ago and loved it, it is fun dance like moves that get you sweating and its a great workout best of all its actually FUN! I lost weight with it back then so I am hoping to do the same now that I have re-purchased this workout video would recommend",1430179200,,278,3.982142857142857

8138697,5,B000HDCST6,"I love this workout. It's fun and keeps your body moving. I used to workout to this regularly about 4 years ago but stopped when the dvd broke. At that time I was in shape and could do the fast and flexible pace. Over the years I've neglected working out because it feels like a chore. However, now that I purchased this again I have been exercising more and my flexibility is returning. There is a different pace you can take if you're out of shape and it definitely is helpful. Now I strive to get back at the pace I was when I had the dvd the first time. I use several pilates dvd and this is by far my most favorite. Try it, you won't regret it!",1385683200,,649,4.038759689922481
