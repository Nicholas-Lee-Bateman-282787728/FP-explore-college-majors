3006248,5,B000XT1P48,"I have always loved ""old movies"" because they alway ""took me away"". I never was a Lana Turner fan....UNTIL...I saw Madame X. I cried so much I thought I would have to go to the hospital for dehydration! Madame X is the number ONE Tearjerker of all time. Number 2 is Stella Dallas starring Barbara Stanwyck. And number 3 is Lana again in imitation of life. Camille starring Garbo and Wuthering Heights with Merle Oberon is up there too. As well as Bette Davis in Now Voyager and Stolen Hours and a Stolen Life and well....anything Davis made. Best Wishes....Dennis Troy

3006249,5,B000XT1P48,"Coming to this DVD double feature with a little history will add to your enjoyment of it - so first a DVD extra.

There was a time when a STAR on the marquee meant money in the bank for the movie studios. Lana Turner was under contract to M-G-M for nearly twenty years. Her films had been of varying quality. The quality she most often projected was S-E-X.

After leaving the studio, Turner still made big films with important co-stars, but most of her publicity centered on her private life. She got a big break when producer Jerry Wald offered her the starring role in his film version of the hot, hot bestseller of the day ""Peyton Place"" in 1957. Turner ended up with an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for her role.

On the night of the ceremony, Lana argued with her then boyfriend, Johnny Stompanato - later that evening, he was stabbed and killed in her home. The publicity was tremendous. In ""Peyton Place"", Lana's character has a long scene on the witness stand talking about her failure as a mother. At the time the scene was playing to packed houses across the United States, Turner was playing the scene in real life in the inquest on Stompanato's demise. Her daughter Cheryl had been arrested for the crime. Turner's inquest testimony is on film and is always used in television biographies on her life.

Would her career survive? Enter producer Ross Hunter, then allied with Universal-International Studios. He offered Lana the leading role in his remake of ""Imitation of Life."" He didn't have money for a large salary and offered her fifty percent of the profits. Lana took it. A supporting player in the film has said that everyone on the set was very aware that this film was make or break for Turner. If the audiences rejected her, it would be over.

Bottom line: big hit for Hunter, U-I, and Turner, who made so much money from the film that she was set for life.

That was 1959, and Hunter and Turner teamed again the next year for the first of the films included in this DVD double feature: ""Portrait in Black."" Written by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts and based on their play, this was a movie about murder and coverup.

Lana's stylish Sheila Cabot is married to a bedridden crank played by Lloyd Nolan. On the side, she is in love with Dr. David Rivera (Anthony Quinn.) Within ten minutes of the movie, a murder plot is hatched by the lovers, and the rest of the movie is taken up with red herrings and unlikely cover ups.

The young lovers Sandra Dee and John Saxon get caught up in the shenanigans (Dee plays Turner's stepdaughter). Anna May Wong and Ray Walston play servants in the Cabot household, and suspicion of blackmail by one or the other of them is heavy.

The costumes and settings are DeLuxe and beautiful. Jewels are by David Webb and costumes by Jean Louis. There is some location filming in San Francisco. The Chrysler cars are sleek with fins defining the Forward Look. That the ending is contrived and unlikely only adds to the berserk joy of ""Portrait in Black.""

Five years later, Turner is five years older, and this brings us to the jewel in this set: ""Madame X."" By 1965, this property had been filmed at least four times. That producer Hunter and star Turner took it on is a testament to their faith in the story. It was filmed by Ross Hunter Productions and Eltee (as in L.T.) Productions. Money is not quite as in evidence as in their two previous films, but every dollar spent shows on the screen. There are beautiful costumes again by Jean Louis, more jewels by David Webb, and Furs by Ben Kahn.

Holly Parker (Turner) marries wealthy Clay Anderson (John Forsythe) and is whisked off the be part of his life in upper crust Connecticut. There she meets his mother Estelle (Constance Bennett). The politically ambitious Clay leaves Holly alone for extended periods of time, and she eventually takes up with Phil Benton (Ricardo Montalban). When the affair is discovered, Benton ends up dead - of course. And Estelle sends Holly on her way to avoid a scandal.

That Holly's life eventually turns to alcohol and grief (despite an interlude with a musician played by John Van Dreelan) - is a given. In fact she is eventually tried for the murder (her second, though her first INTENTIONAL one), and is defended by her own son. She has given her name as Madame X, not wishing to cause embarrassment to her family.

Turner is great in this role. She looks great, and her moment of realization in the courtroom that the man defending her is HER SON is beautifully played. Careers are made on such moments, unless you are Lana Turner known only as a commodity and not an actress.

There are problems of course. Forsythe has that annoying wart on his forehead, Bennett's recent face lift makes her look as if she were wearing a mask, and the hamming of Burgess Meredith is tough to watch. But it's a Turner show, and she is (almost) always worth watching.

These films have not always been easy to find, although both were released for a short time years ago on video. They are presented in Widescreen and have the original trailer included. It is a two-disc set and not the expected one-disc two-sided presentation. The color is not much improved over the video and could have been corrected a bit.

But, folks, at least we have them. Get some popcorn, invite some friends over, and watch how they used to make movies. It's a lot more fun than reality television. Turner and Hunter create their own reality - and now and then there can be nothing more entertaining.",1202860800,31,5513,4.581725888324873
3006250,4,B000XT1P48,"I have waited for ""Madame X"" (1966) to be on DVD for years and finally it is here, at an excellent price as a double feature with ""Portrait in Black"" (1960). I will continue to refer to the price, as this set is sorely lacking in extras. For ""Madame X,"" we have the original trailer, which is entertaining, but not in great shape visually. It looks like a 5th generation dupe at the very best. The movie looks pretty good; decent detail, overall colors are bright, but at the same time, it doesn't appear to have undergone any major restoration work or seem as sharp as many of the Warner/MGM classic titles. The movie holds up well though, mainly due to the quality of the Ross Hunter production, the cast, and a great story: Holly Parker (Lana Turner) is the classic shop girl who marries Clayton Anderson (John Forsythe), an up and coming politician who comes from a long line of wealth. Although Clayton deeply loves Holly, his status-obsessed mother (Constance Bennett's last role) does not. Because of an indiscretion at a point that her husband has ignored her, Clayton's mother sees her opportunity to get rid of Holly while keeping her grandson, the family heir. Holly is forced to go into hiding and lead an empty life. Plenty of tears along the way, and Turner gives probably her finest performance ever. The courtroom scene at the end and reunion with her son will be sure to make you weep. Although somewhat dramatic, it is a stylish soap opera and the performances are excellent. 5 stars for this one!

""Portrait In Black"" tries hard but is not as enjoyable as ""Madame X."" One of the biggest pluses of this film is its uncharacteristic (for this era) use of actual location filming. San Francisco is featured throughout, and not just for long shots. It appears that the stars, including Lana Turner and Anthony Quinn, actually shot many of their scenes in the city and along the Pacific Coast Highway. The story is of a wealthy woman, Sheila Cabot (Turner), who is trapped in a loveless marriage to an invalid (Lloyd Nolan). To ease the pain she starts seeing his doctor (David Rivera, played by Quinn) on the side. Together they plot to murder Mr. Cabot, but things get complicated when an  unknown person begins to blackmail them, and then everything begins to unravel. The cast (including Sandra Dee, Ray Walston, and Anna May Wong) is excellent, however the casting of Anthony Quinn is questionable, as I never really sensed a chemistry between him and Turner. Their chemistry is crucial to the movie, and without it, it's easy to question why she would go to such great lengths to be with him. The ending is also extremely unsatisfying...it leaves too many questions unanswered and seems very abrupt. Turner does as much as she can with a not-so-great script. Again, only a crusty theatrical trailer is tacked on as an extra. The transfer for this movie does not seem as good as Madame X. The print seems somewhat dirty and not quite as sharp. On top of that, the color shifts back and forth every so many frames.  I would give this one 2-3 stars.

Again, for the price, you are getting a great value. 2 famous Ross Hunter classics starring Lana Turner for $12? Amazing! Beggars can't be choosers...",1202774400,4,3218,4.670194003527337
3006251,5,B000XT1P48,"What a great later Lana double feature.

Great scene from PORTRAIT IN BLACK:
Lana Turner is required to drive a car, at night alone, as part of a murder plot but guess what? She can't drive!
So she tries anyway 'cuz she has to but has absolutely no concept of steering or braking or how to work the ""push-button"" automatic transmission.
She follows Anthony Quinn in the other car through the streets of San Francisco swerving and clueless as they barrel along. It starts to rain but she doesn't know from windshield wipers. Finally gets those going when the arms at a rail crossing come down right in front of her freaking her out and separating her from Anthony Quinn as the train goes by. It's a scream!

Great Madame X moment:
Lana Turner and Ricardo Montalban are dancing and Lana remarks how the she loves the mansion but worries about the plumbing. Ricardo makes a remark about the ""facade covering the corrosion"", referring to the house and the rich people at the upper crust party.

Both these films are a hoot. Enjoy them as such!",1202688000,2,1039,4.575268817204301
3006252,5,B000XT1P48,"Madame X is Lana Turners large production leading lady swan song and it is finally on DVD.  I saw this movie as a double feature back in 1967 with of all things Disney's Jungle Book!  I remember that after the film ended the audience was weeping so that they didn't turn up the house lights. I was all of 3 years old and I remember that clearly!  Years later I so the movie again and I wept at the ending too.  It totally manipulates the viewer but it is worth it.  A Ross Hunter production at its best.  Gloss, glamour and Lana!
Portrait in Black is in the same league with all of the same gloss and glamour but doen't have as rich and juciy of a story as Madame X.  Now if we can only get Back Street on DVD.  My VHS copy is almost worn out.",1202169600,33,743,3.972972972972973
3006253,5,B000XT1P48,"Can't believe my two most awaited movies from the queen of glamour, the beautiful LANA TURNER will be available at once in one dvd!!!!
""PORTRAIT IN BLACK"" has everything a good movie from the sixties must have: suspense, glamour, great technicolor picture, simply great!
""MADAME X"" is the movie I always thought Lana should win an Oscar nomination for..She's much better than in ""PEYTON PLACE"", her only nomination.
It's impossible not to be impressed how she changes her looks from the begginning of the picture when she is a newly-wed socialite lovely to look at to the second part when she becomes a drunker, with proper makeup to make her look bad..I mean bad!
The court final scenes makes the stronger, coldest people on earth have tears in their eyes, no doubt about it !
Congratulations Universal for this wonderful gift.. I recommend it highly!!

It had excellent picture and sound quality, but it was not, of course, presented in the correct widescreen (VHS tapes never are).  Can't wait for this.",1200528000,27,439,4.723684210526316
3006255,5,B000XT1P48,"""Portrait in Black"" (1960)
San Francisco cargo ship czar, Matthew Cabot (Lloyd Nolan- Peyton Place as Dr Swain) finds himself bedfast and slowly dying as his beautiful and ultra-glamorous wife Sheila (Lana Turner) becomes more and more desperate to rid herself of a husband, due to his illness, can no longer satisfy her needs!  Enter suave and sophisticated Dr. David Rivera (Anthony Quinn), who is overseeing Mr. Cabot's care, as well as his wife's desires! ""Portrait in Black"" is one of those delicious over-the-top glamour-soap-opera's that you just can't help indulging yourself in!  Co-starring `60's teen queen, Sandra Dee as Lana and Lloyd's daughter, and handsome John Saxon as Sandra's boyfriend, the cast is pleasant to watch as this romantic drama soon becomes a clever murder mystery!  You know from the moment that the movie begins, with it's glossy and glamorous color that it's a Ross Hunter production!  Every detail in this film shouts ""Ross Hunter glamour!"" From Lana's gorgeous Oriental inspired wardrobe to the beautifully decorated homes, it's Mr. Hunter all the way! With classic romantic dramas such as, ""Back Street,"" ""Midnight Lace,"" and this film's double feature  ""Madame X,"" to his credit, Ross excelled with this kind of material and made some really entertaining features!

Madame X (1966)
Aristocratic heiress Estelle Anderson (Constance Bennett) is more than a little disappointed with her son, Clayton Anderson's (John Forsythe) choice for a bride in common girl-next-door Holly Parker (Lana Turner, looking no where near common!) so the wheels begin to be placed in motion to get rid of her! Successful rising political star, Clayton Anderson is rising to the top of the politcal arena and the toil of his success is beginning to weigh heavily on his marriage.  Despairing of the lonliness of her husband's long absences, Holly finds comfort in playboy, Phil Benton, (Ricardo Montalban) who falls deeply in love with her! Holly's mother-in-law discovers the adultrous relationship and begins to plan a way to rid herself of Holly once and for all!  Holly and Clayton's young son, Clayton Jr., is in the middle of the battle and is soon without a mother as Estelle cunningly blackmails Holly into disappaearing from all of their lives forever! Burgess Meredith also stars as a down on his luck con artist that tries to use Holly's past to blackmail her!  Keir Dullea stars as the young adult Clayton Jr in the later scenes who has become a successful lawyer, and unknowingly represents and defends his own mother!  The courtroom scene near the end of the movie is one that will have you reaching for a hankie! A Ross Hunter glamour flick all the way! With gorgeous homes, beautiful fashions, and over-the-top dramatics! A first `class' production all the way!

I highly recommend adding this great double feature of ""Portrait in Black"" and ""Madame X"" to any dvd collector's library!  Never was there a more entertaining glamour queen, than Lana Turner, and she makes the roles in these films so believable and so much fun to watch! I only wish the films could have been made available on single disc dvd editions with some nice commentaries and ""behind the scenes"" information and entertaining stories or gossip! I've long awaited both of these films appearance on dvd, and am glad to finally have them! Now, how about adding Lana's ""By Love Possessed,""(1961) ""Love Has Many Faces,"" (1965) and ""Who's Got The Action?"" (1962) to dvd?!",1194393600,120,3467,5.052539404553415

Out of all of them, she's just heart-stopping and there are no words. She's excellent for the past, the present & for all time. I can praise these films and never stop.

believe who the guilty party was.  I  will  not  reveal  in  case  someone  has  not  seen  it.

I found it on Amazon, of course, and watched it today.  Once again, it brought on the tears, and as an adult I am so taken with the incredible acting of Lana Turner as she transforms herself from a high  society lady to such a broken woman at the hands of her mother-in-law.

3006534,5,B000XT1P48,"I've just watched this film again and find it so much better than ""Imitation"".
Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Douglas Sirk's glossy color dramas, but he also directed some others like ""All that Heaven allows"", ""Never say Goodbye"" (which he co-directed with Jerry Hopper) and even ""Magnificent Obsession"" (the 50's version, please) that I think are a lot better than the highly over-rated ""Imitation of Life"".

""Portrait in Black"" reminds me of some of Hitchcock's best works like ""Vertigo"", ""Marnie"" and ""North by Northwest"". It's from Michael Gordon who directed some very good flicks like ""Woman in Hiding"" (Ida Lupino, one of the best film noirs) and ""Pillow Talk"" (Doris Day and Rock Hudson...it doesn't get any better than this).
It's not only the good plot that I enjoy when I watch ""Portrait in Black"", it's also the gorgeous San Francisco movie locations and Frank Skinner's score. And the suspense, of course!",1401926400,,924,4.923076923076923

3006558,5,B000XT1P48,"Madame X:

Madame X is by far one of my all time favorite movies. It was filmed in a sort of ""soap opera"" manner but yet has such a great movie feel. Lana Turner plays a shop girl who meets a lawyer(played by John Forsythe) who is going places. The movie opens with the surprise marriage of Lana and Johns character arriving at the home where john lives with his mother Estelle(Constant Bennett). A woman who obviously was spoiled and hardened in life by the wealthy lifestyle. Here is where the trouble begins, Lana is not seen as good enough for her new found husband and mother in law makes it known. Without spoiling the plot, I will go no further. I will say this movie grabs you from the beginning to the very end and will play with all your emotions. Its a great story, perfectly cast and moving and gripping. A must see for all who love a GREAT movie!

Portrait in Black:

Portrait in Black is a great film noir classic. Lana plays Sheila. The wife of a wealthy ship magnet who is crippled and bed ridden and also the step mother to Sandra Dee, a spoiled yet well mannered young woman who has her own story going on. Anthony Quinn plays the doctor who is having an affair with Lana Turner who between them plot to kill the husband for his millions. Do they succeeed? not going to say. Its a great movie with suspense and drama from beginning to end. Another well cast movie with some truly great performances. 2 great movies in one package!",1394150400,,1448,4.355555555555555

3006615,5,B000XT1P48,These two movies are fine performances by Lana Turner.  Madame X is a classic story of a woman who makes a tragic mistake that changes her life forever and the dire consequences it has on all those closest to her.  Portrait in Black also stars Anthony Quinn as her adulterous lover and how they plan to do away with her husband.  Great movies from great actors!!!,1375833600,,363,4.46969696969697
3006616,5,B000XT1P48,"At first the movie appeared to be like Lana Turner was all about her self, but as the movie moved along, she was trying to survive in a time when the women had no voice and was always in the back ground only.  As the husband traveled around with work and left her all alone to be feel the loneliness was more than she could cope with.
With unfortunate turns and twist of the move, it brings my heart to full pumping power to know she made the ultimate sacrifice for her child, was it wrong or right, who is to judge, but being a mother made you proud and shocked at the same time.  I cheered on at some points, while crying on others.  A movie that you will never ever forget.",1373414400,,676,4.067669172932331

3006648,5,B000XT1P48,"Lana Turner, Sandra Dee as her step daughter, and Anthoney Quinn as her illicet lover turn in incredible performances in this tightly woven thriller, Portrait in Black.  For me this movie outshines by far the other movie in this set, Madame X.  I was bored during the last half of Madame X so I will focus my review on Portrait in Black, which I found fantastic.

Lana Turner looked so fantastic, and wore such incredibly beautiful clothes in this.  Her stepdaughter, played by Sandra Dee, was at least equally gorgeous.  Sandra Dee was only sixteen when she made this, and it gave me a new appreciation for her dark eyed beauty and acting abilities.

Lana played Sheila Corbett, the abused wife of a terribly tyrannical and ailing shipping empire magnate.  We see him twisting her arm, bullying her, barking orders at her, from his invalid bed, and her, bravely taking it from him, fighting to be civil to him even as he berates and orders her around.  She gets scolded and brutalized by this ruthless tyrant when he finds out she has gotten a learner's permit to drive.

Of course such a gorgeous woman, in her fabulous furs and jewels, has a boyfriend on the side.

There was one scene in this movie where Sheila is forced to drive, even though she doesn't know how, that gave me goosebumps for a good ten minutes at least.  If only Alfred Hitchcock had directed this, we would have had the trademark shadows and camara angles to put the icing on the cake.  This plot has the suspense of one of his better films, but even without his direction, this movie had all the suspense and plot twists any moviegoer could want.

I like movies that are eye candy as far as settings, clothes, and the actors go and this has gobs of that.  Combine that with the edge of your seat suspense, great script and story, great acting, and you have one of the most thouroughly entertaining movies I have seen in a long time.",1359936000,4,1907,4.521865889212828

3006681,4,B000XT1P48,"Let's face it murder, and by this I mean planned murder not some blood simple, spur of the moment, heat of passion thing that could befall anybody, is not job for amateurs. More than a few who have failed to observe this rule have faced the gallows for thinking that they could cheap the hangman, or the odds. Of course that is the premise, the odds against premise, of the film under review, the1960 thriller Portrait In Black, in which the characters play with fire in disregard of that very sound advice just provided, just provided for free.

More importantly love and murder do not mix, do not mix at all. Also advice provided gratis courtesy of viewing many noirs and thrillers. But as humans will do when the love bug gets its nasty side hold on people there is no telling what will happen, or where it will lead. And that is exactly what happens to our unlucky couple in this thriller. They tempt the fates and those angry gods and goddesses in acts of pure hubris smash them like bugs.

Let me provide a few details just to prove my point, although if you too have seen enough noirs and thrillers you already are in my chapel. One unhappy (but rich) San Francisco wife (played by Lana Turner last seen by this reviewer serving them off the arm down at Nick's Dinner further down the coast and also plotting, amateur plotting with a besotted highway tramp, John Garfield, to murder old Nick for love and money in the film adaptation of James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice) of one very sick and ruthless man wants to move on, move on with her husband's doctor (played by Anthony Quinn).

Naturally the lovers want to be happy and happiness cannot wait upon the timely demise of the husband. The husband is therefore a very long gone daddy after a little work by the good doctor. Perfect crime. No somebody is onto their caper. And that someone is also a goner. All done, right. No, no once this thing gets going it snowballs out of control. See, the husband's daughter (played by Sandra Dee) by his first wife tumbled onto the lovers who thought they had everything under control. So, naturally, naturally now that the blood lust is up, she has to go. Almost. But the main mantra of any thriller or any noir is that crime does not pay. And that is the case here. And you wonder why I say murder is no job for amateurs. Got it.",1349568000,,2344,4.433874709976799

Portrait in Black is pretty good if you like Lana Turner even though it doesn't hold a candle to Madame X. This is the first old movie I've seen where they actually make the neglected husband mean enough not to sympathize with. It's a tragedy also. The end was good and surprising but that type of tragedy and suspense-ender makes me mad. But I guess it would've been against the Hollywood code back then for the criminals to get away with their crime without punishment. But it was pretty good--7/10",1297036800,,1010,4.674157303370786

Well 40 odd years later, at long last I managed to acquire a copy of this beloved movie and guess what. Hang on to the tissues mothers. I was transfixed by the incredible performance of Lana Turner. No special effects, no glamourous settings, just real down to earth acting and settings. Wow! I must add that I now found the finale of the moving as heart renching as the goodbye scene, the losing her mind in the snow, the heartache of having to leave someone who loved her so, the addiction to absiynth and the decision to protect her family - what more can I say. If you enjoy good acting and a story of real love and caring in the midst of a human tragedy, this is the movie for you. It is not for cynics or critics, who will see the shortfalls of an ""old movie"", it is just for those who understand the heartache of loss, a mothers love. Ladies get out the tissues, make yourself a flask of coffee, cuddle up in a warm comfy blanket, and begin to cry.

Thank you Amazon for this wonderful addition to my collection.",1290038400,,1266,4.142276422764228

3006758,4,B000XT1P48,"When it comes to glossy 1960s melodrama, there's only one leading lady who consistently delivered the goods - Lana Turner.  Slip into a glittery cocktail dress, prepare the drinks and settle back with two unforgettable movies starring ""La Turner""!

In PORTRAIT IN BLACK (based on a 1947 play by Ivan Goff), Turner plays Sheila, the second wife of ruthless, embittered shipping tycoon Matthew Cabot (Lloyd Nolan). Matt is dying, and the death can't come soon enough for Sheila, who has grown weary of Matt's blazing temper and suspicious mind. Unbeknownst to the rest of the household, Sheila is carrying on an affair with Dr. David Rivera (Anthony Quinn) - who'se also eager for the old codger to fall off the twig - so he administers a lethal concoction in lieu of Matt's daily injection... The deed goes off without a hitch, until a few days later when Sheila receives a hand-printed letter, congratulating the widow on the ""success of her murder"". Sheila and David's lovelife slowly unravels as the pair attempts to track a mysterious blackmailer whilst the body-count rises...

With a slight nod to Lana Turner's film noir masterpiece ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"", PORTRAIT IN BLACK is a gorgeously-filmed mystery thriller which had me riveted right to the end. Sandra Dee co-stars as Sheila's stepdaughter Cathy, with John Saxon as her boyfriend. Richard Basehart, Ray Walston and Anna May Wong (making a brief return to movies after a ten-year absence) are marvelous. Ross Hunter favourite Virginia Grey has a small but very well-written role as Cabot's secretary.

In MADAME X. (1966), Lana Turner is Holly, the vivacious young wife of up-and-coming diplomat Clay Anderson (John Forsythe). Holly has it all, but Clay's globe-trotting lifestyle unfortunately allows Holly to fall prey to the advances of notorious ladies' man Phil Benton (Ricardo Montalban). During a bitter fight where Holly tries to leave Phil once and for all, he accidentally falls down the stairs. Faced with going to trial for his ""murder"", Holly's icy mother-in-law (Constance Bennett) forces the bewildered Holly to stage her death, and stay out of Clay's life forever. Many years pass before Holly, now a drunken, broken old woman, emerges in New York, once again accused of murder. But this time the past is more than a memory away...

With the character of Holly in MADAME X., Lana Turner proves (sadly really for the final time) just how wonderful she could be when the material was first-class. Holly was reportedly one of her favourite roles, and I'm sure she held the experience in fond memory (especially as she later waded through such dreck as 1969's ""The Big Cube"" and 1980's ""Witches' Brew""). Constance Bennett is splendid as the witchy mother-in-law (she sadly passed away shortly before the movie was released); Burgess Meredith is appropriately slimy as the blackmailer trying to ride Holly's coat-tails. Keir Dullea co-stars as Holly's adult son.

A bargain for the price.  Recommended.",1258502400,2,2987,5.0961145194274025

When he is killed in a bad fall during one night of their encounter, she appeals to her matriarchal mother-in-law for help... But the aristocratic woman (Constance Bennett) who has always considered her an embarrassment to her family, convinces her the indiscretion will cost her husband his career and wreck their young son's life...

Over the years, she slowly drifts into a life of alcoholism and prostitution, sinking lower and lower until. in a Mexican hotel she meets Dan Sullivan (Burgess Meredith) a smooth-talking con-man, and agrees to join him in a blackmail scheme...

When she discovers too late that the intended victim is her husband, she shoots the ugly blackmailer and goes on trial for murder signing her confession as the mysterious Madame X...

Unaware of her true identity, the young lawyer assigned to defend her is her own son Clay Anderson Jr (Keir Dullea), now grown to manhood...

PORTRAIT IN BLACK (PIB) portrays cunning and deception as illicit lovers try to cover their tracks after opening a sympathy card containing the words ""Congratulations on the success of your murder."" This is a reverse whodunit in that the guilty are obvious and the suspense is in discovering who knows about it. A worthy costar, Anthony Quinn convincingly portrays a progressive meltdown.

In the beginning, PIB color is not very stable (flickering from cool to warm tones) but it seems to level out by the fifth chapter. Besides subtitles, there are no DVD extras - not even scene selection (though chapter skipping is included). But hey, it's two great movies for the price of one. Both are recorded in English Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono with subtitles in English SDH and French.

3006830,5,B000XT1P48,"Three new film noirs and a weepy double feature---what more could you want for a late winter's evening (or evenings) entertainment? Some of the noirs are weepy, and some of the weepies are noirs, so it gets a little confusing. The one genuine, dyed-in-the-wool noir is 1953's Dangerous Crossing, coming in at a taught 76 minutes. Jeanne Crain plans to spend her honeymoon on a luxury liner with new hubby Carl Betz; problem is, hubby disappears within minutes of boarding, and all the signs point to him never existing. Kindly ship's doctor Michael Rennie straightens it all out, with a goodly number of thrills along the way. Black Widow is less successful a noir, despite the starry cast of Ginger Rogers, Van Heflin, Gene Tierney and George Raft. Set in the celebrity driven world of the New York theatre circa 1954, an ambitious young author uses her wiles to get ahead to little avail, as someone offs her halfway through the film, it's a whodunit that degenerates into a who cares. The main characters aren't drawn sharply enough, and the plot seems oddly discombobulated. With the exception of Heflin, the stars are somewhat past their prime and seem, unfortunately, a bit seedy However, Daisy Kenyon is the pick of the litter, despite it being squarely a Joan Crawford weepy rather than a noir. A love triangle with Crawford, Dana Andrews and Henry Fonda deftly directed by Otto Preminger, one in a long line of her female leads making her way with pluck and honor in a man's world. It's black and white, it rains a lot, and there are some great atmospheric shots, but a film noir it ain't. There are also vintage scenes of mid-century Provincetown, and former Cape resident Ruth Warrick plays Andrew's beleaguered wife; despite Preminger's earlier great noirs such as Laura and Whirlpool, this really is a weepy.
The weepy double feature from Universal consists of Portrait in Black and Madame X, both starring Lana Turner and produced by that sultan of excess, Ross Hunter. Hunter's reality had little relationship to anyone else's; his was a world of the rich or near rich, beautiful or near beautiful, with lots of jewels and Jean Louis gowns, where there were no small emotions, only large, operatic, over-the-top scenes. Portrait in Black is a noir, albeit a noir in blazing color that his nothing to do with the low, cheap detective thrillers we all know and love. Turner and Anthony Quinn kill off her ailing husband Lloyd Nolan, and somebody knows their dirty little secret. Is it bubbly Sandra Dee, pert John Saxon, crusty Ray Walston or the ever mysterious Anna May Wong? And, as weepy par excellance, little can be said about Madame X, other than a profound and astonished, ""wow!"" Turner, as the poor but honest wife of super rich John Forsythe, is blackmailed by her evil mother-in-law, Constance Bennett, into leaving him and their by baby, who, as he grows up to be Keir Dullea, might not be such a bad idea on the face of it. Later, Lana's accused of murder and her lawyer is---you guessed it---Dullea, who has no idea that he's defending his mom. You know, they simply are not making films like this any more.

3006831,4,B000XT1P48,"2 unbelievably camp late career classics from La Turner-in both movies she has a real stretch playing basically herself-a scandal wracked 40 something beauty who wears a million dollar wardrobe and has too many boyfriends who are no good for her. In Portrait she plays  hot blooded Sheila whose lover DR Anthony Quinn murders her invalid husband-the perfect murder until Sheila gets a note:""Congratulations on the success of your murder!"" In Madame X she marries rich John Forsythe & has to battle his bitch of a mother played by the great Constance Bennett-this movie is so over the top, especially after Lana fakes her own death to escape a murder rap (another one!) and spends the next 20 years going from man to man & drink to drink to forget! There's not a dry eye in the house at the end of this movie when she meets her grown up son after her 20 year trip!

3240746,5,B000XT1P48,"Coming to this DVD double feature with a little history will add to your enjoyment of it - so first a DVD extra.

There was a time when a STAR on the marquee meant money in the bank for the movie studios. Lana Turner was under contract to M-G-M for nearly twenty years. Her films had been of varying quality. The quality she most often projected was S-E-X.

After leaving the studio, Turner still made big films with important co-stars, but most of her publicity centered on her private life. She got a big break when producer Jerry Wald offered her the starring role in his film version of the hot, hot bestseller of the day ""Peyton Place"" in 1957. Turner ended up with an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for her role.

On the night of the ceremony, Lana argued with her then boyfriend, Johnny Stompanato - later that evening, he was stabbed and killed in her home. The publicity was tremendous. In ""Peyton Place"", Lana's character has a long scene on the witness stand talking about her failure as a mother. At the time the scene was playing to packed houses across the United States, Turner was playing the scene in real life in the inquest on Stompanato's demise. Her daughter Cheryl had been arrested for the crime. Turner's inquest testimony is on film and is always used in television biographies on her life.

Would her career survive? Enter producer Ross Hunter, then allied with Universal-International Studios. He offered Lana the leading role in his remake of ""Imitation of Life."" He didn't have money for a large salary and offered her fifty percent of the profits. Lana took it. A supporting player in the film has said that everyone on the set was very aware that this film was make or break for Turner. If the audiences rejected her, it would be over.

Bottom line: big hit for Hunter, U-I, and Turner, who made so much money from the film that she was set for life.

That was 1959, and Hunter and Turner teamed again the next year for the first of the films included in this DVD double feature: ""Portrait in Black."" Written by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts and based on their play, this was a movie about murder and coverup.

Lana's stylish Sheila Cabot is married to a bedridden crank played by Lloyd Nolan. On the side, she is in love with Dr. David Rivera (Anthony Quinn.) Within ten minutes of the movie, a murder plot is hatched by the lovers, and the rest of the movie is taken up with red herrings and unlikely cover ups.

The young lovers Sandra Dee and John Saxon get caught up in the shenanigans (Dee plays Turner's stepdaughter). Anna May Wong and Ray Walston play servants in the Cabot household, and suspicion of blackmail by one or the other of them is heavy.

The costumes and settings are DeLuxe and beautiful. Jewels are by David Webb and costumes by Jean Louis. There is some location filming in San Francisco. The Chrysler cars are sleek with fins defining the Forward Look. That the ending is contrived and unlikely only adds to the berserk joy of ""Portrait in Black.""

Five years later, Turner is five years older, and this brings us to the jewel in this set: ""Madame X."" By 1965, this property had been filmed at least four times. That producer Hunter and star Turner took it on is a testament to their faith in the story. It was filmed by Ross Hunter Productions and Eltee (as in L.T.) Productions. Money is not quite as in evidence as in their two previous films, but every dollar spent shows on the screen. There are beautiful costumes again by Jean Louis, more jewels by David Webb, and Furs by Ben Kahn.

Holly Parker (Turner) marries wealthy Clay Anderson (John Forsythe) and is whisked off the be part of his life in upper crust Connecticut. There she meets his mother Estelle (Constance Bennett). The politically ambitious Clay leaves Holly alone for extended periods of time, and she eventually takes up with Phil Benton (Ricardo Montalban). When the affair is discovered, Benton ends up dead - of course. And Estelle sends Holly on her way to avoid a scandal.

That Holly's life eventually turns to alcohol and grief (despite an interlude with a musician played by John Van Dreelan) - is a given. In fact she is eventually tried for the murder (her second, though her first INTENTIONAL one), and is defended by her own son. She has given her name as Madame X, not wishing to cause embarrassment to her family.

Turner is great in this role. She looks great, and her moment of realization in the courtroom that the man defending her is HER SON is beautifully played. Careers are made on such moments, unless you are Lana Turner known only as a commodity and not an actress.

There are problems of course. Forsythe has that annoying wart on his forehead, Bennett's recent face lift makes her look as if she were wearing a mask, and the hamming of Burgess Meredith is tough to watch. But it's a Turner show, and she is (almost) always worth watching.

These films have not always been easy to find, although both were released for a short time years ago on video. They are presented in Widescreen and have the original trailer included. It is a two-disc set and not the expected one-disc two-sided presentation. The color is not much improved over the video and could have been corrected a bit.

But, folks, at least we have them. Get some popcorn, invite some friends over, and watch how they used to make movies. It's a lot more fun than reality television. Turner and Hunter create their own reality - and now and then there can be nothing more entertaining.",1202860800,31,5513,4.581725888324873
3240747,4,B000XT1P48,"I have waited for ""Madame X"" (1966) to be on DVD for years and finally it is here, at an excellent price as a double feature with ""Portrait in Black"" (1960). I will continue to refer to the price, as this set is sorely lacking in extras. For ""Madame X,"" we have the original trailer, which is entertaining, but not in great shape visually. It looks like a 5th generation dupe at the very best. The movie looks pretty good; decent detail, overall colors are bright, but at the same time, it doesn't appear to have undergone any major restoration work or seem as sharp as many of the Warner/MGM classic titles. The movie holds up well though, mainly due to the quality of the Ross Hunter production, the cast, and a great story: Holly Parker (Lana Turner) is the classic shop girl who marries Clayton Anderson (John Forsythe), an up and coming politician who comes from a long line of wealth. Although Clayton deeply loves Holly, his status-obsessed mother (Constance Bennett's last role) does not. Because of an indiscretion at a point that her husband has ignored her, Clayton's mother sees her opportunity to get rid of Holly while keeping her grandson, the family heir. Holly is forced to go into hiding and lead an empty life. Plenty of tears along the way, and Turner gives probably her finest performance ever. The courtroom scene at the end and reunion with her son will be sure to make you weep. Although somewhat dramatic, it is a stylish soap opera and the performances are excellent. 5 stars for this one!

""Portrait In Black"" tries hard but is not as enjoyable as ""Madame X."" One of the biggest pluses of this film is its uncharacteristic (for this era) use of actual location filming. San Francisco is featured throughout, and not just for long shots. It appears that the stars, including Lana Turner and Anthony Quinn, actually shot many of their scenes in the city and along the Pacific Coast Highway. The story is of a wealthy woman, Sheila Cabot (Turner), who is trapped in a loveless marriage to an invalid (Lloyd Nolan). To ease the pain she starts seeing his doctor (David Rivera, played by Quinn) on the side. Together they plot to murder Mr. Cabot, but things get complicated when an  unknown person begins to blackmail them, and then everything begins to unravel. The cast (including Sandra Dee, Ray Walston, and Anna May Wong) is excellent, however the casting of Anthony Quinn is questionable, as I never really sensed a chemistry between him and Turner. Their chemistry is crucial to the movie, and without it, it's easy to question why she would go to such great lengths to be with him. The ending is also extremely unsatisfying...it leaves too many questions unanswered and seems very abrupt. Turner does as much as she can with a not-so-great script. Again, only a crusty theatrical trailer is tacked on as an extra. The transfer for this movie does not seem as good as Madame X. The print seems somewhat dirty and not quite as sharp. On top of that, the color shifts back and forth every so many frames.  I would give this one 2-3 stars.

Again, for the price, you are getting a great value. 2 famous Ross Hunter classics starring Lana Turner for $12? Amazing! Beggars can't be choosers...",1202774400,4,3218,4.670194003527337
3240748,5,B000XT1P48,"What a great later Lana double feature.

Great scene from PORTRAIT IN BLACK:
Lana Turner is required to drive a car, at night alone, as part of a murder plot but guess what? She can't drive!
So she tries anyway 'cuz she has to but has absolutely no concept of steering or braking or how to work the ""push-button"" automatic transmission.
She follows Anthony Quinn in the other car through the streets of San Francisco swerving and clueless as they barrel along. It starts to rain but she doesn't know from windshield wipers. Finally gets those going when the arms at a rail crossing come down right in front of her freaking her out and separating her from Anthony Quinn as the train goes by. It's a scream!

Great Madame X moment:
Lana Turner and Ricardo Montalban are dancing and Lana remarks how the she loves the mansion but worries about the plumbing. Ricardo makes a remark about the ""facade covering the corrosion"", referring to the house and the rich people at the upper crust party.

Both these films are a hoot. Enjoy them as such!",1202688000,2,1039,4.575268817204301

I was all of 3 years old and I remember that clearly!  Years later I so the movie again and I wept at the ending too.  It totally manipulates the viewer but it is worth it.  A Ross Hunter production at its best.  Gloss, glamour and Lana!

It's impossible not to be impressed how she changes her looks from the begginning of the picture when she is a newly-wed socialite lovely to look at to the second part when she becomes a drunker, with proper makeup to make her look bad..I mean bad!

San Francisco cargo ship czar, Matthew Cabot (Lloyd Nolan- Peyton Place as Dr Swain) finds himself bedfast and slowly dying as his beautiful and ultra-glamorous wife Sheila (Lana Turner) becomes more and more desperate to rid herself of a husband, due to his illness, can no longer satisfy her needs!  Enter suave and sophisticated Dr. David Rivera (Anthony Quinn), who is overseeing Mr. Cabot's care, as well as his wife's desires! ""Portrait in Black"" is one of those delicious over-the-top glamour-soap-opera's that you just can't help indulging yourself in!  Co-starring `60's teen queen, Sandra Dee as Lana and Lloyd's daughter, and handsome John Saxon as Sandra's boyfriend, the cast is pleasant to watch as this romantic drama soon becomes a clever murder mystery!  You know from the moment that the movie begins, with it's glossy and glamorous color that it's a Ross Hunter production!  Every detail in this film shouts ""Ross Hunter glamour!"" From Lana's gorgeous Oriental inspired wardrobe to the beautifully decorated homes, it's Mr. Hunter all the way! With classic romantic dramas such as, ""Back Street,"" ""Midnight Lace,"" and this film's double feature  ""Madame X,"" to his credit, Ross excelled with this kind of material and made some really entertaining features!

Madame X (1966)
Aristocratic heiress Estelle Anderson (Constance Bennett) is more than a little disappointed with her son, Clayton Anderson's (John Forsythe) choice for a bride in common girl-next-door Holly Parker (Lana Turner, looking no where near common!) so the wheels begin to be placed in motion to get rid of her! Successful rising political star, Clayton Anderson is rising to the top of the politcal arena and the toil of his success is beginning to weigh heavily on his marriage.  Despairing of the lonliness of her husband's long absences, Holly finds comfort in playboy, Phil Benton, (Ricardo Montalban) who falls deeply in love with her! Holly's mother-in-law discovers the adultrous relationship and begins to plan a way to rid herself of Holly once and for all!  Holly and Clayton's young son, Clayton Jr., is in the middle of the battle and is soon without a mother as Estelle cunningly blackmails Holly into disappaearing from all of their lives forever! Burgess Meredith also stars as a down on his luck con artist that tries to use Holly's past to blackmail her!  Keir Dullea stars as the young adult Clayton Jr in the later scenes who has become a successful lawyer, and unknowingly represents and defends his own mother!  The courtroom scene near the end of the movie is one that will have you reaching for a hankie! A Ross Hunter glamour flick all the way! With gorgeous homes, beautiful fashions, and over-the-top dramatics! A first `class' production all the way!

I highly recommend adding this great double feature of ""Portrait in Black"" and ""Madame X"" to any dvd collector's library!  Never was there a more entertaining glamour queen, than Lana Turner, and she makes the roles in these films so believable and so much fun to watch! I only wish the films could have been made available on single disc dvd editions with some nice commentaries and ""behind the scenes"" information and entertaining stories or gossip! I've long awaited both of these films appearance on dvd, and am glad to finally have them! Now, how about adding Lana's ""By Love Possessed,""(1961) ""Love Has Many Faces,"" (1965) and ""Who's Got The Action?"" (1962) to dvd?!",1194393600,120,3467,5.052539404553415

3240857,5,B000XT1P48,"This is 5 stars for Madame X.  I've not yet seen Portrait in Black.  Madame X is my all time favorite movie.  Your heart goes out to this Madame X.  She is beautiful, elegant and very much in love with her husband and dearly loves their son.  Her mother-in-law, who lives with them never did accept her into the family!  She only pretended to for her son's sake.  The twists and turns of Madame X's life, keeps you guessing, what's next for this poor woman.  But the most touching is the surprise ending!  If you've never seen this, give it a try, you won't be sorry!  If you've seen it before, then consider owning it for your self.  I would give it more than five stars if I could.",1457827200,3,683,4.217054263565892

believe who the guilty party was.  I  will  not  reveal  in  case  someone  has  not  seen  it.

I found it on Amazon, of course, and watched it today.  Once again, it brought on the tears, and as an adult I am so taken with the incredible acting of Lana Turner as she transforms herself from a high  society lady to such a broken woman at the hands of her mother-in-law.

3241031,5,B000XT1P48,"I've just watched this film again and find it so much better than ""Imitation"".
Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Douglas Sirk's glossy color dramas, but he also directed some others like ""All that Heaven allows"", ""Never say Goodbye"" (which he co-directed with Jerry Hopper) and even ""Magnificent Obsession"" (the 50's version, please) that I think are a lot better than the highly over-rated ""Imitation of Life"".

""Portrait in Black"" reminds me of some of Hitchcock's best works like ""Vertigo"", ""Marnie"" and ""North by Northwest"". It's from Michael Gordon who directed some very good flicks like ""Woman in Hiding"" (Ida Lupino, one of the best film noirs) and ""Pillow Talk"" (Doris Day and Rock Hudson...it doesn't get any better than this).
It's not only the good plot that I enjoy when I watch ""Portrait in Black"", it's also the gorgeous San Francisco movie locations and Frank Skinner's score. And the suspense, of course!",1401926400,,924,4.923076923076923

3241055,5,B000XT1P48,"Madame X:

Madame X is by far one of my all time favorite movies. It was filmed in a sort of ""soap opera"" manner but yet has such a great movie feel. Lana Turner plays a shop girl who meets a lawyer(played by John Forsythe) who is going places. The movie opens with the surprise marriage of Lana and Johns character arriving at the home where john lives with his mother Estelle(Constant Bennett). A woman who obviously was spoiled and hardened in life by the wealthy lifestyle. Here is where the trouble begins, Lana is not seen as good enough for her new found husband and mother in law makes it known. Without spoiling the plot, I will go no further. I will say this movie grabs you from the beginning to the very end and will play with all your emotions. Its a great story, perfectly cast and moving and gripping. A must see for all who love a GREAT movie!

Portrait in Black:

Portrait in Black is a great film noir classic. Lana plays Sheila. The wife of a wealthy ship magnet who is crippled and bed ridden and also the step mother to Sandra Dee, a spoiled yet well mannered young woman who has her own story going on. Anthony Quinn plays the doctor who is having an affair with Lana Turner who between them plot to kill the husband for his millions. Do they succeeed? not going to say. Its a great movie with suspense and drama from beginning to end. Another well cast movie with some truly great performances. 2 great movies in one package!",1394150400,,1448,4.355555555555555

3241112,5,B000XT1P48,These two movies are fine performances by Lana Turner.  Madame X is a classic story of a woman who makes a tragic mistake that changes her life forever and the dire consequences it has on all those closest to her.  Portrait in Black also stars Anthony Quinn as her adulterous lover and how they plan to do away with her husband.  Great movies from great actors!!!,1375833600,,363,4.46969696969697
3241113,5,B000XT1P48,"At first the movie appeared to be like Lana Turner was all about her self, but as the movie moved along, she was trying to survive in a time when the women had no voice and was always in the back ground only.  As the husband traveled around with work and left her all alone to be feel the loneliness was more than she could cope with.
With unfortunate turns and twist of the move, it brings my heart to full pumping power to know she made the ultimate sacrifice for her child, was it wrong or right, who is to judge, but being a mother made you proud and shocked at the same time.  I cheered on at some points, while crying on others.  A movie that you will never ever forget.",1373414400,,676,4.067669172932331

3241145,5,B000XT1P48,"Lana Turner, Sandra Dee as her step daughter, and Anthoney Quinn as her illicet lover turn in incredible performances in this tightly woven thriller, Portrait in Black.  For me this movie outshines by far the other movie in this set, Madame X.  I was bored during the last half of Madame X so I will focus my review on Portrait in Black, which I found fantastic.

Lana Turner looked so fantastic, and wore such incredibly beautiful clothes in this.  Her stepdaughter, played by Sandra Dee, was at least equally gorgeous.  Sandra Dee was only sixteen when she made this, and it gave me a new appreciation for her dark eyed beauty and acting abilities.

Lana played Sheila Corbett, the abused wife of a terribly tyrannical and ailing shipping empire magnate.  We see him twisting her arm, bullying her, barking orders at her, from his invalid bed, and her, bravely taking it from him, fighting to be civil to him even as he berates and orders her around.  She gets scolded and brutalized by this ruthless tyrant when he finds out she has gotten a learner's permit to drive.

Of course such a gorgeous woman, in her fabulous furs and jewels, has a boyfriend on the side.

There was one scene in this movie where Sheila is forced to drive, even though she doesn't know how, that gave me goosebumps for a good ten minutes at least.  If only Alfred Hitchcock had directed this, we would have had the trademark shadows and camara angles to put the icing on the cake.  This plot has the suspense of one of his better films, but even without his direction, this movie had all the suspense and plot twists any moviegoer could want.

I like movies that are eye candy as far as settings, clothes, and the actors go and this has gobs of that.  Combine that with the edge of your seat suspense, great script and story, great acting, and you have one of the most thouroughly entertaining movies I have seen in a long time.",1359936000,4,1907,4.521865889212828

3241178,4,B000XT1P48,"Let's face it murder, and by this I mean planned murder not some blood simple, spur of the moment, heat of passion thing that could befall anybody, is not job for amateurs. More than a few who have failed to observe this rule have faced the gallows for thinking that they could cheap the hangman, or the odds. Of course that is the premise, the odds against premise, of the film under review, the1960 thriller Portrait In Black, in which the characters play with fire in disregard of that very sound advice just provided, just provided for free.

More importantly love and murder do not mix, do not mix at all. Also advice provided gratis courtesy of viewing many noirs and thrillers. But as humans will do when the love bug gets its nasty side hold on people there is no telling what will happen, or where it will lead. And that is exactly what happens to our unlucky couple in this thriller. They tempt the fates and those angry gods and goddesses in acts of pure hubris smash them like bugs.

Let me provide a few details just to prove my point, although if you too have seen enough noirs and thrillers you already are in my chapel. One unhappy (but rich) San Francisco wife (played by Lana Turner last seen by this reviewer serving them off the arm down at Nick's Dinner further down the coast and also plotting, amateur plotting with a besotted highway tramp, John Garfield, to murder old Nick for love and money in the film adaptation of James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice) of one very sick and ruthless man wants to move on, move on with her husband's doctor (played by Anthony Quinn).

Naturally the lovers want to be happy and happiness cannot wait upon the timely demise of the husband. The husband is therefore a very long gone daddy after a little work by the good doctor. Perfect crime. No somebody is onto their caper. And that someone is also a goner. All done, right. No, no once this thing gets going it snowballs out of control. See, the husband's daughter (played by Sandra Dee) by his first wife tumbled onto the lovers who thought they had everything under control. So, naturally, naturally now that the blood lust is up, she has to go. Almost. But the main mantra of any thriller or any noir is that crime does not pay. And that is the case here. And you wonder why I say murder is no job for amateurs. Got it.",1349568000,,2344,4.433874709976799

Portrait in Black is pretty good if you like Lana Turner even though it doesn't hold a candle to Madame X. This is the first old movie I've seen where they actually make the neglected husband mean enough not to sympathize with. It's a tragedy also. The end was good and surprising but that type of tragedy and suspense-ender makes me mad. But I guess it would've been against the Hollywood code back then for the criminals to get away with their crime without punishment. But it was pretty good--7/10",1297036800,,1010,4.674157303370786

Well 40 odd years later, at long last I managed to acquire a copy of this beloved movie and guess what. Hang on to the tissues mothers. I was transfixed by the incredible performance of Lana Turner. No special effects, no glamourous settings, just real down to earth acting and settings. Wow! I must add that I now found the finale of the moving as heart renching as the goodbye scene, the losing her mind in the snow, the heartache of having to leave someone who loved her so, the addiction to absiynth and the decision to protect her family - what more can I say. If you enjoy good acting and a story of real love and caring in the midst of a human tragedy, this is the movie for you. It is not for cynics or critics, who will see the shortfalls of an ""old movie"", it is just for those who understand the heartache of loss, a mothers love. Ladies get out the tissues, make yourself a flask of coffee, cuddle up in a warm comfy blanket, and begin to cry.

3241255,4,B000XT1P48,"When it comes to glossy 1960s melodrama, there's only one leading lady who consistently delivered the goods - Lana Turner.  Slip into a glittery cocktail dress, prepare the drinks and settle back with two unforgettable movies starring ""La Turner""!

In PORTRAIT IN BLACK (based on a 1947 play by Ivan Goff), Turner plays Sheila, the second wife of ruthless, embittered shipping tycoon Matthew Cabot (Lloyd Nolan). Matt is dying, and the death can't come soon enough for Sheila, who has grown weary of Matt's blazing temper and suspicious mind. Unbeknownst to the rest of the household, Sheila is carrying on an affair with Dr. David Rivera (Anthony Quinn) - who'se also eager for the old codger to fall off the twig - so he administers a lethal concoction in lieu of Matt's daily injection... The deed goes off without a hitch, until a few days later when Sheila receives a hand-printed letter, congratulating the widow on the ""success of her murder"". Sheila and David's lovelife slowly unravels as the pair attempts to track a mysterious blackmailer whilst the body-count rises...

With a slight nod to Lana Turner's film noir masterpiece ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"", PORTRAIT IN BLACK is a gorgeously-filmed mystery thriller which had me riveted right to the end. Sandra Dee co-stars as Sheila's stepdaughter Cathy, with John Saxon as her boyfriend. Richard Basehart, Ray Walston and Anna May Wong (making a brief return to movies after a ten-year absence) are marvelous. Ross Hunter favourite Virginia Grey has a small but very well-written role as Cabot's secretary.

In MADAME X. (1966), Lana Turner is Holly, the vivacious young wife of up-and-coming diplomat Clay Anderson (John Forsythe). Holly has it all, but Clay's globe-trotting lifestyle unfortunately allows Holly to fall prey to the advances of notorious ladies' man Phil Benton (Ricardo Montalban). During a bitter fight where Holly tries to leave Phil once and for all, he accidentally falls down the stairs. Faced with going to trial for his ""murder"", Holly's icy mother-in-law (Constance Bennett) forces the bewildered Holly to stage her death, and stay out of Clay's life forever. Many years pass before Holly, now a drunken, broken old woman, emerges in New York, once again accused of murder. But this time the past is more than a memory away...

With the character of Holly in MADAME X., Lana Turner proves (sadly really for the final time) just how wonderful she could be when the material was first-class. Holly was reportedly one of her favourite roles, and I'm sure she held the experience in fond memory (especially as she later waded through such dreck as 1969's ""The Big Cube"" and 1980's ""Witches' Brew""). Constance Bennett is splendid as the witchy mother-in-law (she sadly passed away shortly before the movie was released); Burgess Meredith is appropriately slimy as the blackmailer trying to ride Holly's coat-tails. Keir Dullea co-stars as Holly's adult son.

A bargain for the price.  Recommended.",1258502400,2,2987,5.0961145194274025

PORTRAIT IN BLACK (PIB) portrays cunning and deception as illicit lovers try to cover their tracks after opening a sympathy card containing the words ""Congratulations on the success of your murder."" This is a reverse whodunit in that the guilty are obvious and the suspense is in discovering who knows about it. A worthy costar, Anthony Quinn convincingly portrays a progressive meltdown.

In the beginning, PIB color is not very stable (flickering from cool to warm tones) but it seems to level out by the fifth chapter. Besides subtitles, there are no DVD extras - not even scene selection (though chapter skipping is included). But hey, it's two great movies for the price of one. Both are recorded in English Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono with subtitles in English SDH and French.

Jeanne Crain plans to spend her honeymoon on a luxury liner with new hubby Carl Betz; problem is, hubby disappears within minutes of boarding, and all the signs point to him never existing. Kindly ship's doctor Michael Rennie straightens it all out, with a goodly number of thrills along the way. Black Widow is less successful a noir, despite the starry cast of Ginger Rogers, Van Heflin, Gene Tierney and George Raft. Set in the celebrity driven world of the New York theatre circa 1954, an ambitious young author uses her wiles to get ahead to little avail, as someone offs her halfway through the film, it's a whodunit that degenerates into a who cares. The main characters aren't drawn sharply enough, and the plot seems oddly discombobulated. With the exception of Heflin, the stars are somewhat past their prime and seem, unfortunately, a bit seedy However, Daisy Kenyon is the pick of the litter, despite it being squarely a Joan Crawford weepy rather than a noir. A love triangle with Crawford, Dana Andrews and Henry Fonda deftly directed by Otto Preminger, one in a long line of her female leads making her way with pluck and honor in a man's world. It's black and white, it rains a lot, and there are some great atmospheric shots, but a film noir it ain't. There are also vintage scenes of mid-century Provincetown, and former Cape resident Ruth Warrick plays Andrew's beleaguered wife; despite Preminger's earlier great noirs such as Laura and Whirlpool, this really is a weepy.
The weepy double feature from Universal consists of Portrait in Black and Madame X, both starring Lana Turner and produced by that sultan of excess, Ross Hunter. Hunter's reality had little relationship to anyone else's; his was a world of the rich or near rich, beautiful or near beautiful, with lots of jewels and Jean Louis gowns, where there were no small emotions, only large, operatic, over-the-top scenes. Portrait in Black is a noir, albeit a noir in blazing color that his nothing to do with the low, cheap detective thrillers we all know and love. Turner and Anthony Quinn kill off her ailing husband Lloyd Nolan, and somebody knows their dirty little secret. Is it bubbly Sandra Dee, pert John Saxon, crusty Ray Walston or the ever mysterious Anna May Wong? And, as weepy par excellance, little can be said about Madame X, other than a profound and astonished, ""wow!"" Turner, as the poor but honest wife of super rich John Forsythe, is blackmailed by her evil mother-in-law, Constance Bennett, into leaving him and their by baby, who, as he grows up to be Keir Dullea, might not be such a bad idea on the face of it. Later, Lana's accused of murder and her lawyer is---you guessed it---Dullea, who has no idea that he's defending his mom. You know, they simply are not making films like this any more. We may all be better off.",1205798400,,3160,4.757741347905283
3241328,4,B000XT1P48,"2 unbelievably camp late career classics from La Turner-in both movies she has a real stretch playing basically herself-a scandal wracked 40 something beauty who wears a million dollar wardrobe and has too many boyfriends who are no good for her. In Portrait she plays  hot blooded Sheila whose lover DR Anthony Quinn murders her invalid husband-the perfect murder until Sheila gets a note:""Congratulations on the success of your murder!"" In Madame X she marries rich John Forsythe & has to battle his bitch of a mother played by the great Constance Bennett-this movie is so over the top, especially after Lana fakes her own death to escape a murder rap (another one!) and spends the next 20 years going from man to man & drink to drink to forget! There's not a dry eye in the house at the end of this movie when she meets her grown up son after her 20 year trip! They don't make movies like this anymore more's the pity- then again they don't make movie stars like Lana anymore!",1205193600,,979,4.5625
