For God's sake people hell for my sake even if your gonna watch this series watch them  subtitled. Everything else is great though the animation is some of the best  I've ever seen,the story is quite good and it's well writen and funny. I've  seen the subtitled version also and it is infinetly funnier .All around  this is a good video worthy of your attention but if you have a choice  please get it subtitled. Unfortunatly it is not quite as good as the t.v  shows,those are the best damn animation available I highly recomend them if  yuo can get them subtitled.",949536000,4,681,4.625
