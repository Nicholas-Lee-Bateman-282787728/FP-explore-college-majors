8046571,3,B0007A8XM0,"The Ladder Match for the WWF IC title between Bret Hart & HBK was a pretty solid bout with some good moments and the goes for the $10,000 match between Razor Ramon & 1-2-3 Kid. The 4 Doinks-Team Bigelow match from Survivor Series 1993 was a stupid,childish,mindless waste of time with horrible wrestling to boot. The Lumberjack match for the IC title between HBK & Hacksaw Jim Duggan was not great but pretty good and had its moments and some highspots to boot. I give this tape a 6 out of 10.",1328745600,,493,4.369565217391305
8046572,5,B0007A8XM0,"Ladder matches may happen all the time these days, but how often is it that you see one of these between Bret the Hitman Hart and Shawn Michaels?  Extremely rare match-up here back in their Intercontinental Title era days.  Pretty darn good for an early ladder match.

Then we see Razor Ramon vs. the 1-2-3 Kid.  I forgot how much the Kid could fly around back in the day.  It's hard to believe that's X-Pac in there.  Man, he takes a NASTY fall in this match too, from the top turnbuckle all the way to the concrete floor.

Then there's a goofy-as-heck match from Survivor Series with Bastion Booger and the Headshrinkers eating all kinds of food during the match, and then you toss the whacko Bushwackers in there and it only makes things worse.  Too bad most Survivor Series pay per views now only have one real Survivor Series match.

Last is a lumberjack match between Shawn Michaels and Hacksaw Jim Duggan.  How often do you remember seeing these two guys go against each other?  Very rare indeed.  Yokozuna drags old Hacksaw out to the floor during the match and does his patented massive legdrop.  Man, that move looks like it hurts more than anything else in the world.

This is a great item to balance out a collection of pay-per-views over the years, to get some additional footage from the early days of RAW.",1152489600,2,1320,4.538135593220339
8046573,5,B0007A8XM0,If for nothing else buy it for the Ladder Match between the two most heated real rivals in the industry Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels. This was before Shawn was king of the ladder matches and before Bret won his first WWF Title and is quite good.,1117670400,,245,4.23404255319149
