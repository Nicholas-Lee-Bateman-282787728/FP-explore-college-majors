576713,4,6303152759,"Thanks to Anfernee Hardaway and Shaquille O'Neal, this movie contains some of the absolute worst acting I have ever seen in my life.  And yes, that includes the 50 or so ""Mystery Science Theater"" movies that I have viewed.  Watching the two of them try to act was like watching two blue whales attempting to scale Mount Everest.  See what I'm getting at here?  Apparently, the producers figured that getting real athletes to pass as actors would be better than getting real actors to pass as athletes.  WRONG!!!  Personally, I would rather see these two try & sing opera next time rather than do another stint in a movie.  [By the way, if they are in any more movies, I categorically refuse to see them].
Somehow, this is still a great movie.  Nick Nolte turns in a superb and convincing performance of a intense, once successful college basketball coach who is desperate to have a competitive team.  The seemingly hopeless plight of his less-than-talented team leads him to ""bend the rules"" with the efficacy of catapulting his roster back to the summit of NCAA athletics.
This movie serves as a trenchant satire of what has become of modern college athletics.  Bribery & special gifts to student athletes becomes a way for Nolte's university to entice the very best talent on the market.  This modus-operandi has become all too common in the climate of college basketball (as well as college football).  This movie is a powerful and introspective commentary on what has become a prevalent problem.
""Blue Chips"" is a must movie for any fan of sports, as well as persons who are concerned with the goings-on of Intra-collegiate athletics.  Besides Nolte's sensational perfomance, there are also some fun cameos of Rick Pitino, Larry Bird Bobby Knight & others.  If the film didn't include Haradaway & O'Neal, it would be worthy of 5 stars, easy.",984960000,7,1845,4.834394904458598
576714,4,6303152759,"This movie takes a look at the corrupt world of college basketball when Pete Bell(Nolte), a coaching legend at Western University has a team that begins to lose and can't get any new talent so he bribes three key platers to come there breakin NCAA rules. It sure is one great drama.",978393600,,282,4.4423076923076925
576715,4,6303152759,"Like the previous reviewer, I too have a hard time keeping my composure during the riveting panda sequence.  I thought the life-affirming montage, cleverly filmed in raw black-and-white, truly inspired the film to rise  above being run-of-the-mill sports movie to a commentary on the oxymoron of  the fragility and strength behind the human spirit.
While Steel and  Kazaam didn't allow Shaq to explore the depths of his on-screen  personality, Friedkin's direction is able to elicit a performance from the  big man parallel to the coaching of Zen Master Phil Jackson.
Truly a  wonder to behold.",964137600,,594,5.189473684210526
576716,3,6303152759,"William Friedkin's Blue Chips is an engaging and though compelling look at a dark side of sports these days. Nolte's gives a great performance as a coach forced to go under the table to get his team back to it's winning  ways. J.T. Walsh provides support as a rich, gift giving  friend of the  college Nolte coaches for.  I rank this film  up there with Hoop Dreams,  Without Limits and Rudy as the greatest sports films of the nineties. We  can all thank Friedkin for having the sense to put the shot clock at the  bottom of the screen during the final scene of the big game instead of  having to cut back to it every second. Overall, great basketball action,  good direction and a positive message make this a great buy.",951350400,,722,4.401515151515151
576717,5,6303152759,"Blue Chips is a great movie, Shaquille O'neil plays a powerful role as Neon Boudo, a street hoops player from Louisiana.  As his first acting film he does a great job.  After this movie he moves on the the action movie,  Steel, where he plays a super hereo(another great buy). Blue Chips is  probably the best movie I have ever seen. If I could I would give this  movie 18 stars, but I cant. 10 bucks is a great bagrin for this sport  classic. I greatly encourage you to purchase this fine film!",951004800,,495,4.268817204301075

576719,5,6303152759,"Nick Nolte plays an explosive, but caring college basketball coach who's career is on the decline due to recruiting problems. Nolte decides to lose his ethics and give recruits money, cars, houses, etc. to get them to come  to his school. A serious sports movie without the usual fairytale ending.  The basketball action is exciting and realistic because most of it is  played by real NBA stars, like Shaq, Penny Hardaway, Allan Houston, George  Lynch and many others. Bob Cousy is better than expected as the athletic  director who doesn't miss foul shots.",945734400,13,557,4.946236559139785

577569,3,6303152759,"Blue Chips gives us a view of high pressure college sports particularly that of recruiting basketball players. It tells the story of Pete Bell,who was based loosely on Coach Bob Knight,together with real- life basketball stars like Shaquille O'Neal. The movie made an accurate depiction of the reality of college recruitment and the morality play that schools figure in on the college sports. There was also a story about how college players get involved with game fixing themselves. Too bad that it ""chickened out"" and opted for an implausible conclusion and resolved for a Hollywood ending. Nevertheless,it is still an entertaining movie to watch especially for basketball fans.",1415491200,,680,5.305555555555555

Alot of college/NBA players and coaches were innvolved in this movie- Shaq, Penny Hardaway, Bobby Hurley, Bob Knight and I know I'm probably missing several others. For alot of athletes playing starring roles in this movie instead of actors it turned out to be a really well done movie. This movie goes really in depth on the behind the scenes struggles of a head coach (Nick Nolte) who once had a very successful college basketball team and has recently fallen on lean times with the program.

577668,5,6303152759,"Nick Nolte plays Pete Bell, a man pressured to win at all costs by the alumnae, his boss and the populace of Western University. he does not want to cheat but gets sucked into it and regrets it from the moment he does it. ""The rules may not make sense but I believe in them,"" I paraphrase from his last discussion with his players after they defeat Bobby Knight's team.

I taped this movie from cable many years ago and I can tell you that even today the film resonates with me. The movie has so many cameos that I can't name them all. I will say this, however, each and every one of the cast has an integral part in moving the story along. Penny Hardaway's innocence and Ricky's greed and Boudreaux's confidence--each had a pivotal part to play in the film. Like The Program of 1993, this film had remarkable poignancy.

College athletics becomes corrupted by big time sports. For all those who say that college athletics are ""more pure"" than the pros this film should open your eyes as to what goes on under and sometimes over the table.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I recommend it to anyone who likes a sports movie. Buy it and you won't be disappointed.

Enter Shaq, Penny Hardaway and Matt Nover. They are three great players Nolte wants to join his team but they want special accommodations. This movie was good throughout and had a good ending. Bob Cousy has a small part. Shaq surprised me. I thought he did a good acting job. Penny was so so. Nolte did a pretty good job. Mary McDonell gave a great supporting performance. The Late JT Walsh did great. He was a very underrated actor. This movie is great for young kids who like basketball and also good for the adults because part of the serious issues at hand in the movie. Those looking for other great basketball movies seek out Hoosiers as I believe that is the best basketball movie of all time. Cheers!",1367798400,,1044,4.304568527918781

578032,5,6303152759,"One of the Best Sports Stories of All time!  For anyone interested in the inner machinery of ""Big Time College Recruiting"" this movie is a must see.  The actor/athletes are well cast and Nick Nolte is priceless, as usual.  Mary McDonnell's beauty is only eclipsed by her spot-on portrayal of the dutiful, and loyal die-hard educator/sports fan.  Ed O'Neal, Louis Gosset, Jr. and J.T Walsh are outstanding and very believable in their supporting roles.  The beautiful, ""tough-as-nails"" Alfre Woodard captivates with her role as the ""protective, street-smart, hard-working mom' who will not see ANYONE take advantage of her child's athletic gift, especially if she is not rewarded for all of her hard work, in keeping the family safe, in the tough, locked-down ghettos of Chicago.

Additional praise must be given to Shaquill O'Neal and Penny Hardaway's portrayal of athletes who are talked into (without too much pressure) becoming the center piece of a desperate coach's last ditch effort to save his team's (and his own) reputation as a sports powerhouse.  Both Shaq and Penny were so convincing in their roles that you might even believe that they were actually recruited under similar circumstances.  Whether they had previous experience as actors never entered into the equation, because of their ""spot on"" performances.  It would be nice to see each of them in more roles that don't rely on their appeal as athletes, or former athletes...  I'm sure that each of them would do just fine.",1362873600,,1491,5.073770491803279

I saw this movie a long time ago when I was a kid and I liked it then.  I still like how this movie exposes a lot about big-time sports that maybe a lot of people don't think about.  If people do think about how money gets into big-time sports, they still might not understand what it's really like.  The movie sheds light on how there are always games within or beyond the game.  It's not always a fair game and we've seen a lot of cheats in real sports this past decade: baseball's steroid era, college athletes getting paid, and recently Lance Armstrong/cyclists doping.  In this win at all costs economy, it sends the wrong message to kids growing up.  Are sports just entertainment like theater or music, or is it something more objective that shows us what we're capable of doing?  Sports need to get back to the basics - for the joy they bring.  They need to get the big money out and pay athletes/owners more reasonable amounts.  It is too corrupt.",1352505600,,1087,4.39

578040,5,6303152759,"Where does one begin when attempting to describe an artistic work of true genius?  What did the first art critic say after seeing Leos Mona Lisa?

Words cannot do justice to this celluloid epic brought to us by the mastermind who also brought to us Kevin Costner playing baseball in a movie.

Let us begin at the beginning.  Just see the movie.  Stop whatever you are doing right now, and go watch the movie.  If you have already seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it again.

There, that was easy, was it not?  Now, the role of the reviewer remains, so we must at least attempt to describe to others, those who have not experienced this work of cinematic excellence how exactly their lives are incomplete for not having experienced it.

Perhaps what stands out most amongst the incomprehensible joy that is this film is the brilliant cast of characters immortalized here in.  Blue Chips gave us Nick Nolte in all of his post-48 Hours pre-mug shot glory, back when he was still believable as a human being.  Nolte stars as Pete Bell, a generic Bob Knight in a Season on the Brink who eventually decides to cast his lot in with the Pete Carrolls and John Calliparis of the coaching world and start recruiting a little more creatively.  But that is just a drop in the bucket of the fictional world this film encompasses.

It gave us Ricky Roe, the farmboy moron with the heart of gold (and a daddy who needs a new tractor).  It gave us Neon Bordeaux; that born-on-the-bayou conglomeration of superhuman athletic prowess and a happy go-lucky attitude towards his own illiteracy that makes it a little bit easier to overlook the sad state of poor rural and/or inner city school systems in the United States.  It gave us Butch McRae, a Magic Johnson 2.0 (minus the AIDS) whose single mother who could just use a little help to put some food on the table for Butch and his four sisters.  And those are just the recruits.

Groundbreaking in its own right is the scene where Rick Pitino has to explain to his wife why he gave $3,000 to an assistant coaches wife for an abortion after Rick impregnated her following 30 seconds of sex on a table at a friends Italian Restaurant.  Truly Oscar worthy in every sense of the term.

Also look for revelatory performances from Ed ONeil as a guy named Ed (not Al Bundy) and Bob Cousy as Vic the athletic director.  If all of that was not enough to convince you that this is quite possibly the greatest film ever made, please allow me to introduce the following bullet list to further my case on behalf of the films most eloquent contributions to the history of moving pictures:

 Bob Hurley as an Indiana Hoosier
 The awkward Eric Anderson/Calbert Chaney shower scene
 Dick Vitale eating pizza
 Jim Caviezel playing basketball (prior to Crucifixion)
 Jerry Tarkanian topless scene
 Larry Bird as a shady used car salesman

In conclusion, watch the movie.  You will thank Matt Nover and I later.  To put it simply, Da Vinci and Picasso are lucky that Ron Shelton did not want to be a painter.

578170,4,6303152759,"Being involved in collegiate and high school coaching, I tend to go back and watch this film from time to time to remind me of what sports is all about.  If you're a coach, it's about your devotion to your program and to your kids that you coach.  It's the job, it's the challenge.  It's the same as teaching a class of Math or History to a bunch of kids.  The point is to teach them to become better at what they do and to also make them better on everything outside of the game itself.

If you're a ballplayer, it's about your devotion to the game and to yourself and to your team.  You're as good as your team and it is up to you to understand the philosophy being taught in the game.  The game doesn't just teach you about becoming a better ball player.  The game teaches you about leadership, teamwork, decision-making, and responsibility.  Whether you succeed at the game or not, you succeed in all other aspects involved.

Blue Chips is about how critical it can become at times to make right decisions at all levels of athletics.  Whether you're the president of the college, the athletic director, a booster, a coach, or even a player, the decisions you make can have considerable effects and consequences for the overall integrity of the sport, your school, and career.  Without going into too much detail about the movie, Blue Chips deals with under the table financing of high school players by boosters and people close to the college, in hopes of wooing these standouts to sign with the program.  All levels of the program are involved in this true-to-life tale of deception, greed, and moral judgment.

I will disagree with other reviewers about the cast.  I will argue that to tell the true story of this side of collegiate athletics, it would be normal to use actual athletes that were ""larger than life"" at the time.  Overall, a good movie to watch if you enjoy the sports genre.",1173052800,,1897,4.535294117647059
578171,5,6303152759,"I'm a very good basketball player, let's get that straight right off the top, but this movie is as close as you will ever get to capturing the essence of top shelf hoops. Odds are that you will never get to see me play hoops in person, so I would go for this DVD. There are several things I look for in a great movie and this one includes all of them.

1. Superstar actors- Nick Nolte answers the call here. Nolte is a whacked out hippie who, through a witness protection program, ends up coaching a college basketball powerhouse. He is as intense as Bo Pelini on a pixie stick binge after losing to Kst at home. He is totally believable as a big time college basketball coach. The play he draws up in the Indiana game, an alley oop with time running out to Leon Boodeaux(Shaquille O'Neal), would totally work against a Bobby Knight coached team. I thought Dennis Hopper was awesome as the assistant with issues.

2. Hot chicks- I love Katie Holmes and you do too. She is totally awesome in the movie as Penny Hardaway's girlfriend. How Penny deals with Katie's pregnancy along with running the point of a fictional basketball team shows his true range. How he did not get an oscar nod after this performance is still debated to this day at your house.

3. Great supporting cast- Matt Nover has always been an A list hollywood star and this film cemented him as one of the top leading men out there. You really feel like he is not going to Western unless his dad gets a tractor. You want his dad to get that tractor, you NEED his dad to get that tractor. Well, I'm not going to spoil it for you but his dad gets the tractor. You kind of get mad at Matt Nover because you feel he is responsible for the program getting in trouble, but his speech at the end about the problems his uncle dealt with growing up in Central Tennessee kind of makes you feel for the kid.

4. Sunny weather in the background- There are several points in this movie where the sun is out. If it is raining all of the time, no one really feels that good about things. If you put some sunshine in equation, life is just better. This movie features the sun on more than one occasion.

5. Livestock- There is a point in this film where you see a cow. That can't be all bad.

6. Bobby Knight- Bobby Knight plays the basketball coach of Indiana University in this movie. You really believe he is a coach in this film and not just a reality TV star like he is now. What is Bobby Knight? Warm and adorable as always.

Overall, this movie sums up college athletics more than anything I have ever seen. The booster guy named happy is kind of a dork, but the lesson learned here is that if you have money you get what you want. That is totally true. Combine my bankroll with my looks and you quickly see why the deck is stacked against you. I'm the final four and you are Barry Collier's NCAA tournament history.",1142812800,3,2874,4.272058823529412
578172,3,6303152759,"There's one thing that puts Blue Chips one star above my usual 2-star rating for a guilty pleasure -- Nick Nolte!  He absolutely rises above what is a disappointingly predictable script by Ron Shelton (Bull Durham) with mostly pedestrian direction by William Friedkin (The French Connection, The Exorcist).

The explosive, and ultimately comical opening scene in the locker room sets the stage for Coach Pete Bell's competitive demons to vie with his better angels for dominance where winning means everything -- big time collegiate basketball. While all the characters here seem to be drawn from all-too-familiar stereotypes, especially the slimy and corrupt alumni booster (J.T. Walsh) and the young recruits from relatively poor backgrounds (Shaquille O'Neal, Anfernee Hardaway, and Matt Nover), Nolte makes the role of Coach Bell singular in every way. Along the way we meet the likes of ex-NBA great Bob Cousy as the equally torn college athletic director as well as Coach Bell's friend and confidant; along with the likes of former players Larry Bird and Marques Johnson in fictional roles, real-life college coaches Jerry Tarkanian, Bobby Knight, Rick Pitino, and others.

I suppose what leaves a cynical taste is the utter lack of scruples displayed by so many, but especially the under-privileged parents of two of the recruits; they're more-than-willing participants in what Coach Bell feels he has to do in order to compete, making the whole exercise feel too legitimate in a ""real world"" sense.  While the coach agonizes, the parents and recruits readily acquiesce.  Still, Nolte strikes the right tone in it all.

Blue Chips is a film worth watching for its methodical, and in Nolte's hands, entertaining depiction of college basketball recruiting. Mary McDonnell as the coach's ex-wife makes an attractive, intelligent, but unwitting anti-foil to Nolte's various schemes to push the letter of the rules just a little bit further, helping him procure the team that rises above the mediocre and reaches the sublime.

 While the second half of the story is mostly predictable and the message of redemption heavy-handed and contrived, the ending in the playground does indeed resonate.  It's a good rental for an evening's entertainment for those who enjoy relevant sports movies, and especially for those who like seeing Nick Nolte play a role to the hilt.",1142121600,,2367,5.2407407407407405
578173,3,6303152759,"Oh, how the mighty have fallen. In the `70s, director William Friedkin was at the peak of his powers. The one-two punch of The French Connection and The Exorcist made him a force to be reckoned with. And then, he made Sorcerer, a critical and commercial failure. His industry clout disappeared as fast as he had acquired it. Studios did not want to deal with his inflated ego and hard-headed pragmatism. Other than the excellent, To Live and Die in L.A. Friedkin has made one forgettable film after another through the `80s and `90s. On paper, Blue Chips must have seemed like a good idea. Team up Friedkin with a Ron Shelton (responsible for one of the best sports films ever, Bull Durham) penned screenplay to create a hard-hitting expose on college basketball. So, what happened?

Friedkin doesn't seem all that interested in the basketball sequences, shooting them in the standard way that we have seen on TV instead of trying something different, like employing his trademark you-are-there cinema verite which would have captured the intensity of a live game, much as Oliver Stone did in Any Given Sunday. Friedkin seems more interested in the off-court mechanics: the wheeling and dealing needed to get raw talent from high schools to their college without a rival school stealing/enticing them away and Bell wrestling with his conscious. This is when the film is at its strongest and most interesting.

Blue Chips is fine until its conclusion when it suddenly loses its freakin' mind when a guilt-ridden Bell tries to redeem himself at a post-game press conference. It just doesn't seem believable-especially when this scene is followed by a staggeringly nave, it-starts-with-our-kids message that is way too preachy. It betrays what the film has been saying up to this point: that no one seems to play for the love of the game anymore. Everybody wants something - money, a house, a car, or a job. Ultimately, Blue Chips is about an honest man who sells his soul, who gives into overwhelming pressure to get what he wants and who loses his way. Friedkin almost pulls it off and the sudden, pat ending makes one wonder if he originally intended a more downbeat ending only for the timid studio to impose a more positive conclusion. In doing so, they've alienated the audience who was with them up until that point.",1112659200,2,2320,4.856060606060606
578174,4,6303152759,"Okay...Shaq and Penny are not good actors.  With that being said and out in the open, let's address the role of Coach Pete Bell (portrayed in this film, brilliantly, by Nick Nolte).  Coach Bell, and obvious Bobby Knight knock-off, is torn between running a clean program and winning games.  Coach Bell, who has not had an impact season in a number of years, decides to allow Western University boosters free reign to 'buy' players at the highest price in order to play for his team.

As bad as Shaq and Penny are, Matt Nover delivers the kind of awful performance that actually lends a level of respectability to the former Orlando Magic teammates performance.  The centerpiece of this film, Nolte, delivers the kind of commanding and believable performance that certainly warrants more recognition than he actually received.  The pivotal moments in this film are as follows:

1) The scene in which Nolte agonizes over making the phone call to Happy to 'make it so'.  Great acting from Nolte.

2) The absolute top moment in the film, however, is Nolte's speech at the end.  Coach Bell, who can not allow himself to cheat, gives a srtong and candid speech in which he addresses all the problems with modern day college athletes.  get the money out of the sports.  Too many other people are making money off the kids' hard work.  Its all about money.

Overall, I gave this film four stars.  Had Shaq or Penny not been in this movie, it would have received five stars.  Their screen presence is just too unpalatable to warrant such a high rating.

578175,1,6303152759,"Okay, this movie is a complete waste of time for even the most diehard college basketball fans.

Nick Nolte does a fine job acting like Bob Knight coaching UCLA, or in this case, the fictional Western Univ. That is until the 'real' Bob Knight coaches Indiana against Nolte's fictional team in the climactic game at the end.

I was a student at IU when Nolte was going to every Indiana home game in order to study how a real college basketball coach acts. At the time Indiana was number 1 in the nation so Nolte got a lot of attention for his role. However, the acting by Shaq, Hardaway, and Matt Nover was absolutely HORRID!

The plot centers around a legendary b-ball court (Nolte as a Knight rip-off right down to the sweater) who is turned to cheating by those nasty alumni and boosters. He takes his dirty team through the season and plays number 1 Indiana at the end. The Real Bob Knight shows up with a cast of former IU b-ball legends and one Duke legend in Bobby Hurley. Anyway, after beating the squeaky clean Indiana team Nolte rats out the alums and boosters for their recruiting violations.

Other than Nolte nobody gives a really solid performance. Mary McDonnell is good but she's hardly in the movie. Bob Cousy plays the AD and he does an okay job for a guy who isn't even an actor. Hardaway is terrible and Matt Nover is just plain horrible.

The only part really worth watching is the final game between Indiana and Shaq's team. It does a good job of taking you inside the huddle as you actually see and hear Knight diagram plays and Nolte does the same. However, it just turns into a highlight reel of Shaq dunking.

If you want to see a good b-ball movie just watch Hoosiers again. Also, I'd like to be on whatever mind altering drugs the people who gave this movie 5 stars were taking.",1108339200,4,1805,4.421686746987952

578178,5,6303152759,"Nick Nolte, age 53 here, is outstanding in his role as ""Pete Bell"" in 1994's ""Blue Chips"". Bell is a Bobby Knight-like basketball coach who is not at all happy when his team is on the losing end of the score. Knight himself has a role in this movie, as do some other well-known people from the real basketball world.

I find myself watching and re-watching the opening scene of this film, where Nolte storms into the locker room, wreaking havoc on the water cooler (and whatever else happens to be within arm's reach). It's a great beginning to a very good motion picture.

The DVD edition of ""Blue Chips"" was released by Paramount in March of 2005, and became a welcome addition to my collection of movie discs. The DVD offers up a beautiful-looking Widescreen (1.85:1 anamorphic) version of the movie. Colors are brilliant. No bonus features are offered on the disc however. Not even the Theatrical Trailer, which would have been kind of nice to have.

The 1997 VHS video edition of ""Blue Chips"" is not really too bad either, although it's not in the preferred Widescreen mode. But the VHS does offer a robust 2.0 Dolby Surround track.

If you collect sports movies, you should probably get yourself a video or DVD copy of 1994's ""Blue Chips"" for sure. It's worth the price for that opening water cooler-destroying scene and Coach Bell's later basketball-kicking tirade all by themselves. ;)
