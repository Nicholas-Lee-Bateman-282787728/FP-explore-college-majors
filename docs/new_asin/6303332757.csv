8171487,5,6303332757,This was the first power rangers ep ever. If you are buying this copy for the first box art then do it. But if you are looking to buy this because you just wanted to see the ep then you should look for the CLASSIC RED RANGER tape. You get two ep for less. You get this ep Day of the Dumpster and The Wannabe Ranger.,994204800,,315,3.787878787878788
8171488,5,6303332757,"""Day of the Dumpster"" is the episode that started the whole craze off. That is why I like it so much.  The first Morphin' sequence, the first time you see the Zords etc. that's what makes it the best!",985392000,,200,4.128205128205129
8171489,5,6303332757,"Hi,
I was a HUGE Fan Of the power ranger shows in the being. But After they started bringing in new cast mebers it started to sink for me. I was  anout 9 or so when the show first aired in 1993. And I was a Fan Untill  1997. I stoped watching it when it started to be on like at 8:00 in the  mornning on a saturday and well I like to sleep in, nowadays I find myself  waking up at 1:00pm. Well if you wanted to know what the best episode is,  it is the first one. I know its Hella cheesy and I know That It was done  hella fast, but I still loved it. And Well Seeing it time to time alone in  my basement where no one can see of hear whats going down in there brings  back old child hood memories. I Thought that The pink Ranger was soo cool.  I was sooo trying to be like her a one point...But MY Favorite Ranger of  all time would have to be Tommy the Green, White and red Ranger, He was  sooo cute and I hope that guy who played Tommy ""Jason Jhon"" Is  working on something because he was really good, and a Major Hottie. But  Evin though he wasn't really an origanal ranger he is still cute. But  anyway I thought that the first one is the best one and if you are a  die-hard Power Ranger Fan Buy it.",966470400,3,1203,3.8137651821862346
