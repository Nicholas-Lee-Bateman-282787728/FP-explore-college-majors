8348314,2,B001ZEHRY2,"I just received Arlen Roth's Lap Steel Guitar yesterday. I expected this DVD to be for beginners in lap steel guitar rather than experienced conventional guitar players. About the only instruction for new players was selecting and holding the lap steel guitar slide and tuning your guitar to the open E tuning. A brief description of right hand usage was not very clear. Terminology is used that the new player probably isn't familiar with. The video goes very quickly and really only demonstrates Roth's abilities. On the tv screen lesson examples are shown in white refer to the small booklet inside the DVD case. They show the DVD example shown in standard music notation and the tab format. No notes or discussion appear in the booklet. He mentions chords, notes, etc which the experienced guitarist would understand. I feel this video is definitely not suitable for a person desiring to learn lap guitar that doesn't have a firm grasp of the conventional steel guitar and its associated music theory.",1314230400,16,1005,4.952662721893491
8348315,4,B001ZEHRY2,"I just picked up a lap steel a few months ago on a whim.  After playing guitar for 20 years, I'm really enjoying the instrument a whole lot.  It's an awesome instrument to learn to play.  The problem is, unless you want to play country or bluegrass, there isn't very many books or videos available to help you learn.  I've investigated everything that's out there, and short of finding a rock/blues lap steel player to give you lessons this is the best.  As he does with everything I've seen him in, Arlen Roth does a great job of teaching you the basics through cool, classic licks that just sound great.  As with a lot of these old Hot Licks videos, not every example is notated in the booklet, but if you have a decent ear you can pick those licks up.  And plenty of the great stuff he plays IS tabed out in the books.  A great primer and definitely worth the money.",1274400000,13,869,4.288343558282208
