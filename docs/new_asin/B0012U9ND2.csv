8247831,5,B0012U9ND2,The Nancy Drew season 1 episodes are extremely good! The mysteries are awesome and intriguing! There are 7 episodes with four on one side of the disk and 3 on the other. I love how the episodes take place in the 70's!! Pamela Sue Martin is a brilliant Nancy Drew!!! I love this!!!,1425254400,3,280,4.30188679245283
