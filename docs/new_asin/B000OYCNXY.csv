8607679,5,B000OYCNXY,"""For Catherine""  brings humor and sentiment to the TV screen in a poetic waltz.  This first production by 207 pictures develops the theme of the romantic comedy through the backdoor via a sensitive, witty young man eperiencing his first true love.  The movie elicits laughter from the outset, ofttimes iced with tears.  I look forward to more productions from such a talented new director and crew.",1180656000,,398,4.984848484848484
