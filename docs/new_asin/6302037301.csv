7819958,5,6302037301,I showed this film (when it was on a reel) in my high school classroom.  my husband and I were discussing it so I looked on Amazon... of course... there it was! Hoyt Axton narrates and if nothing else the hair style and clothing is worth it! I wish we could do a .. where are they now... on many of the key players!,1357171200,,315,3.921875
7819959,2,6302037301,"I own versions of the song Cocaine Blues by Bob Dylan, Keith Richards, Dave Van Ronk, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Jackson Brown and probably one or two other artists, and I have heard conflicting stories about who wrote it.  I thought this video was about the song.  I was especially excited that the narrator is Hoyt Axton, because his version is my favorite, though I have never seen it on his records.

It's not about the song.  It is an anti-drug documentary.  It is however, the best anti-drug documentary I know of, like the best house in a bad neighborhood.",1250294400,,559,4.606060606060606
7819960,5,6302037301,"This is a classic document on the cocaine phenomenon, particularly
covering the '80s mania that swallowed Hollywood and most of America's
youth.  Ignore the reviews that complain that it's not ""starring"" Frank
Zappa.  He appears, logically and articulately, as one of the ""players""
who addresses the blizard of powder that became a cultural epidemic --
and which is making a resurgence in the 21st Century.  If nothing else,
this documentary tracks the appeal as well as the destructive nature
of a unique drug that has seduced young and old alike.  It's a winner --
literally and figuratively, with Festival Awards and kudos from critics.
Highly recommended.",1208304000,,659,5.188679245283019
7819961,1,6302037301,"Frank Zappa is NOT a ""Primary Contributor"". He appears briefly on three occasions during this 52-minute snoozer about cocaine abuse in the 1970's.
About this non-movie, I think Frank said it best; ""I think its completely absurd.""",1055721600,12,229,5.216216216216216
