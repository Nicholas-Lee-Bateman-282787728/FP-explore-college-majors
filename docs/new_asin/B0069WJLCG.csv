The video is fun to watch, humorous and educational all at the same time. Very well written. The characters (Whoops and Bubbs) are lovable and make you smile. You won't be disappointed - it's very clever and watchable over and over.",1323993600,,362,4.584615384615384
4981031,5,B0069WJLCG,"This is a wonderful ""how to"" for kids.  With Whoops and Bubbs, the intended audience is young kids but older children are mesmerized as well.  I gave this as a gift to my friend for her two children, they have watched it over and over.  It was an instant favorite!",1323993600,,264,4.24

8495549,5,B0069WJLCG,My 2 year old loves this DVD.  I asked to watch it every morning.  Now he copy their jokes and saying the lines with them.  Going to see if they have more to offer,1395619200,,163,3.735294117647059
8495550,5,B0069WJLCG,"Two puppets narrate this dvd and it goes through 4 different start to finishes (milk, applesauce, day as a firefighter, and pizza).  My kids love this video and laugh at the jokes.  If you are looking for dvds for the kids this one works out.",1360886400,,242,4.355555555555555
8495551,5,B0069WJLCG,"I have a 4 yr old and a 20 mos old and they both love this DVD.  It is a lot like ""How things are made,"" but for children.  There are four segment that go through the ""start to finish"" processes.  They are how you get milk, apples to applesauce, a day with a firefighter, and how to make pizza.  It is very educational and kept my children's interest.  I'm an Elementary Music teacher and my husband is a High school math teacher and we are always on the look out for good educational products.  This is on the ""approved list.""

They teach everything from social skills, math (shapes & patterns), safety, music (some singing), science, and more.  I'm already hoping for another DVD.  My students would love it. :)

We received a copy of the DVD for free to review, but all opinions our my own.  We'd buy the next one if they had it in a series.",1327017600,,946,4.2824858757062145
8495552,5,B0069WJLCG,"As a mom of seven children, I have been through hundreds - yes, hundreds - of children's movies, educational DVD's and seen all of the programs on television. Start to Finish grabbed all of my children's attention immediately and kept them glued to my laptop the whole time it was playing! Even my older children, aged 12, 11, 9, and 7 stopped what they were doing to sit and watch it.

From shapes to colors to good manners, puppets and real-life concepts, and narrated with a sweet voice, this educational DVD for children has pulled out all of the stops!

Step aside, Baby Einstein, Sid the Science Kid, Dora the Explorer and good ol' Sesame Street! Start to Finish has topped them all, ingeniously combining the best aspects of children's videos and packing them all in one! I won't be surprised when a television station or big corporation (like Disney) notices this one and scoops it up!",1326844800,,933,4.642424242424243
8495553,5,B0069WJLCG,"This is a terrific concept and beautifully executed. My six-year-old son has watched the DVD over and over again... and never seems to tire of it. If you're interested in giving your kids an alternative to ""canned"" television and an opportunity to get their minds working and questioning, I'd highly recommend investing in this DVD. Waiting anxiously for the next one to come out!!",1325116800,,381,4.96875
8495554,5,B0069WJLCG,"I purchased this video for my niece and nephew. They LOVED it! My brother told me that they love to watch Whoops and Bubbs and in addition to being entertained they actually learn something. Also my brothers friend, a teacher, is going to buy it for his classroom because he thinks its a great educational tool. I am very pleased with my purchase.",1324512000,,347,4.523809523809524
8495555,5,B0069WJLCG,"I played the DVD for my two kids, ages five and three, and they both loved it, and so did I.  It was entertaining and informative.  Very well done and great concept.",1324425600,,165,4.125
8495556,5,B0069WJLCG,"I recently purchased Start to Finish and now this is the only DVD my kid asks for. The characters Whoops and Bubbs are very funny and entertaining. They bring you on four separate little journeys to explore how things are done & created, hence the name from Start to Finish. I love it because my child is totally engaged and learning something new at the same time. When I gave her a glass of milk, she started to tell me how it was made, I almost died. It was fantastic! It has a magically Sesame Street quality to it -  I highly recommend it.",1324080000,,544,4.230769230769231
