2893143,5,B000T28POM,"To the reviewer asking about the first Demons movie, they both will be re-released the same day and both are going to have an all new digital transfer. Now, if they would only release them in the original language with subtitles, we would be in business. Unsure if new version will have that, Anchor Bays site doesn't state the language options...",1189036800,5,347,4.704918032786885
2893164,3,B000T28POM,The first one was good but with this one it's just weird because some of the characters that died in the first movie are alive and well in this one. Weird.,1376352000,,155,4.032258064516129
2893165,5,B000T28POM,If you like the first one then you will love this one as well. This film is almost like the first one except in a apartment building.,1365292800,,133,3.962962962962963

2893167,4,B000T28POM,"I liked the first one.  This one kinda didn't make sense - the way the demons showed up in this movie kinda stupid, but the monsters were cool.  Keep your eyes open for the stars from the original movie!",1360368000,,203,4.17948717948718
2893168,5,B000T28POM,"Both Demons and Demons 2 are two of the greatest horror movies of all times, great special efects. Dario Argento rules",1360368000,,118,4.666666666666667
2893169,4,B000T28POM,"Very good for a sequel, and fun to see the retro fashions.  Good soundtrack, but the audio quality was a little weak.  My biggest complaint is that the ridiculous demon puppet creature should have been cut from the special edition, and it would have made it a classic.",1358985600,,268,4.5625
2893170,5,B000T28POM,A good movie. Not as good as the first(No film snob here.) But a definitely great addition!  Also killer effects!,1353024000,,113,4.65
2893171,5,B000T28POM,Old horror movies never get old :) Baught these for my brother for his birthday and amozon was amazing with the payment address not interfearing with his mailing address. he got them no problem as predicted. hard to put a smile on his face but it did lol.,1349136000,,255,4.333333333333333
2893172,4,B000T28POM,Demons 2 well if your prone to nightmares this is not a movie for you some parts are cheesy like the little boy demon who has convulsions and a germlin type demon pops out of the demon boys chest and chases after the pregnat lady and the dog demon that eats his masters face off. The movie has the same concept of many popular zombie movies do if your bitten or scratched or infected blood gets on you then you get infected same thing with the demonds in this movie with the added effect that like in the movie pulse the dead can come through the tv it seems to have many aspects of other horror movies but is a good horror movie just the same.,1344816000,,644,4.119047619047619
2893173,4,B000T28POM,"The first demons is one of the all time great horror movies ever made imo. It's got great 1980's metal songs as a backdrop and dread and atmosphere that's hard to beat. So this one doesn't even try. It has the action taking place in a condo building and doesn't have the classic metal behind it. It's still alot of good demonic fun though. The movie moves fast and the effects are of their day but that still like the first one doesn't hurt this one at all.
The series went on to  have two more sequels 'the church'  and 'demons 3 , the orgre""  the church is like this one with people being attacked by demons, the ogre is not really. But this is a direct sequel and it's still a fun horror movie. NOt a classic by any standards though. Demons is fierce and pure terror and this one isn't quite as good for sure. But it's not a one star movie as a few people have stated. The print looks pretty good here too. THis one needs to be put out on blu ray along with 'demons' , the best deal would be both on one blu ray... but , it has been reported that at least 'demons' will come out on blu ray in the future. The date of release is not out yet...  well , at least we have this on dvd along with all the others in the series.",1313971200,,1223,3.979591836734694

2893195,1,B000T28POM,"As a horror movie fan, I've longed for many years before finding a copy of that movie in my country, and after the purchase I have been unable to watch it for many days since I remembered how scared I was when I saw a few movie's clips as a child. Well before the end, I felt insulted by the many shortcomings this movie incurs. Bad acting, bad fx, scanty script, no suspense, and such silly turns I wouldn't have believed neither if I were a 5 years old child. I mean: the director, to build an acceptable plot, must set some rules, and then respect them. That's half the recipe of a good movie, so the action flows smoothly and he can devote himself to scare his audience at his best. If the contagion spreads through blood and claws, that's stupid that somebody got infected without any contact with one or the others. If the infected mutates into a demon through a quite painful, horrific phase, it is silly to show people once totally normal that have become demons in a heartbeat. It is just like if mr. Bava made intentionally fun of his own audience, or he deemed his public as composed by brainless mongoloids he could fool at will. I wouldn't give a single star, not to mention that I won't ever watch the first one, after this experience. If you need a good story of humans turned into horrific killers, pick one of Romero's ""zombies"" or ""28 days later"".",1248134400,,1365,4.399209486166008
2893196,3,B000T28POM,"Demons 1 & 2 are basically one and the same. Swap out a movie theater for an apartment building and a cursed big screen movie for a cursed t.v. movie and you've pretty nailed every major difference between the two films.

Plot-wise, there's really nothing of substance here. What you get is just enough to (sort of) make sense of why everything's going on.

No time is spent developing the characters and the sheer number of them leaves the viewer completely uninterested in what happens to them anyway.

The special fx are good, though i found the original Demons to be a bit more impressive. This is basically the movie's sole strong point and is, quite honestly, the only reason i'd watch it again.

The dubbing ranges from laughable to passable, which i suppose is pretty typical for the genre. On the bright side, this movie contains so little plot that you could probably watch it with the sound off and get just as much out of it.

There's not much in the way of special features... basically a commentary track which I'll more than likely never listen to.

Worth seeing if you're a fan of cheesy gore and fast moving zombies (demons) or if you like goofy Italian horror flicks. This is nothing a casual horror fan would enjoy.",1244419200,,1234,4.586363636363636
2893197,4,B000T28POM,"Demons 2 is a good follow up to cult classic Demons. I enjoyed how Lamberto Bava chosed to have the demon epidemic once again in a closed environment,adding to the intensity and paranoia of the dwindling number of survivors(parking garage). Another good factor is the infection is spread by blood contact to the skin, which gives a explanation of how that girl from the first Demons(the one drenched in Demon blood in the theater) turned into a demon on her boyfriend in the air ducts. The pimp from the first film makes a good return in the next, even though he became a demon in the first( a Return of the Living Dead 2 type of thing). By the way he is a Black Roman as described in the audio commentary of Demons 1. All in all this is a good film and continuation of a cult classic dynasty and where it stops. Better than The Church, The Sect, and that HORRIBLE Demons 3: Ogre.",1238025600,9,880,4.33939393939394

2893199,4,B000T28POM,i liked demons but this one  demons2 was a tad better. taking place in an apartment building it is funny and horrific combined. demons takes place in a movie theater and is also worth watching.,1232323200,,193,4.514285714285714

This is not an upgrade if this is not fixed. AVOID FOR NOW!!!!!",1222646400,,509,5.697368421052632
2893201,3,B000T28POM,"The first movie, ""Demons"", was much better in my opinion. The acting was a little better, and it was scarier when I first saw it.  As with the first movie, what was the point of the punk rocker teens?  It did not add much to the movie at all.  It seemed out of place to me having that scene in the movie.  The young lady who played Sally, was better at playing a demon than her human character.  Her whinning was quite annoying and the acting over the top at times.  The scene with the demon fighting the expecting mother was silly and could have been left out of the film.  The other scene was when the expecting mother went into labor and had her baby, only to get up with her husband and walk out of the building as though she was going for a walk.  The three stars are for the demons makeup and how scary they could be at times.",1216425600,,832,4.061349693251533
2893202,2,B000T28POM,Demons 2 is standard sequel to a good horror film. The film pretty much follows the first film's plot but this time it's a TV broadcast instead of a movie. Some of the same cast is even back and the flying baby demon talk about funny.,1207008000,,234,4.108695652173913
2893203,4,B000T28POM,"In a large city at a apartment building complex, a documentary on the demon incidents is shown on TV but unfortunately it causes the demons to literally come out of the screen as they transform some of the residents into horrifying demons that attack the building but can anyone make it out alive?

A worthy sequel to Lamberto Bava's 1985 gorehound shocker ""Demons"" is also directed by Bava and produced by the legendary Dario Argento. The make-up effects especially the little shreiking demon that comes out of a possessed boy are well done and the music score by Simon Boswell is enjoyable, it's nowhere as good as the original cult favorite but still delivers some shocking effects and of course the debut of Dario's daughter Asia in her first movie role.

This DVD contains great picture and sound with the uncut uncensored version with audio commentary and Trailers to this and other Anchor Bay/Starz releases.",1202083200,2,915,4.896774193548387

8207521,1,B000T28POM,"I watched this movie it is foolish, with a very flimsy plot. This movie is just like a middle through out, no clear start or end. The only cool thing is when a demon comes out of the tv. I have seen better movies, and have seen worse movies. Do your self a favor avoid Demons 2, and watch Demons, Demons is the best Italian film ever. To me Demons 2 never happened.",1396137600,,365,4.013698630136986
