1380191,5,B00004Z4VT,I was a teen in the late 70's and an Eagles fan.  I followed both Don Henley and Glenn Frye thru the 80's.  When Hell Freezes Over came out on VHS I fell in love with it so it was no surprise that I bought the Inside Job CD as soon as it was released. When this DVD came out it was a must and did not disappoint!!!!  I love it (except for the hair) and Don Henley is still rockin'!!!  Talking To The Moon still makes me cry and My Thanksgiving has become my fav song...only wish that On My WEdding Day had been on here.  And There Not Here....is kickin'.  Inside Job is an absolute must for any music fan and this delivers all and more.....,981763200,,640,3.9609375
1380192,5,B00004Z4VT,"This is a great DVD.  The sound is very well recorded and reproduced.  The video quality is excellent as well.  If you want a flashy stage with lots of props and costume changes--forget it.  But it is a concert you will love.  It has  a unique version of Hotel California--I would call it a Tex Mex version.  It works.  Other Eagle songs include The Long Run, and the never-get-tired-of-hearing-it Desperado.  Many new songs from his Inside Job CD, as well as some older Henley material--from Boys of Summer and All She Wants To Do is Dance to the more mellow stuff like Heart Of The Matter, and End Of Innocence.  In my opinion a perfect blend of old and new stuff; upbeat and mellow.  If you like Don Henley, you will like this.",980985600,7,730,4.413533834586466
1380193,5,B00004Z4VT,"This is a must have DVD. Don Henley's concert it excellent, the musicians are 1st rate, and the DVD audio is great as well. As an earlier reviewer noted, the 5.1 mix added little to the rear channels, but this is a minor issue, this was definitely one of the best concert tours of 2000, and this DVD reflects this well. Personally, I think his latest CD is his finest solo effort to date, and one of the best CDs of the year.",977961600,,425,4.132530120481928
1380194,4,B00004Z4VT,"You all know Henley so I'll spare the career retrospective. This DVD was taped May 25, 2000 at Fair Park Music Hall in Dallas. From the opener of Dirty Laundry through the entire set and closing with Hotel California, this is a great show by a fantastic song writer. Don's voice sounds great on this night and his back-up band is very sharp. Not a lot of talk between songs, but one great tune after another. The other songs include Sunset Grill, Workin' It, Taking You Home, The Boys of Summer, Lilah, Everything is Different Now, The End of the Innocence, All She Wants to Do is Dance, New York Minute, Talking to the Moon, They're Not Here (They're Not Coming), The Heart of the Matter, Desperado, The Long Run, and My Thanksgiving.
That covers the show, now on to the DVD features... well, there really aren't any. The sound quality is excellent and the production is flawless, but no multiple camera angles, no extras, no videos, just a short intro then on to the show. I'm not complaining as the show is fantastic, but if you like whistles and bells look elsewhere. If you love Henley, the Eagles or just great music then you'll still love it.",974764800,38,1149,4.528846153846154
1380195,5,B00004Z4VT,"Henley's execution of his own classics and new hits alike is nearly flawless.  The concert includes several tracks not aired on the A&E Live special, including Lilah, Talking to the Moon, and They're Not Here, They're Not Coming.  The DTS track for this DVD is superb, with good spatial imaging and effective incorporation of the surround channels; the Dolby Digital track is somewhat less impressive.  The .1 LFE channel is satisfactory though not generally overpowering.  If you're a Henley fan, it doesn't get much better than this.",974764800,2,535,5.114942528735632
1380196,4,B00004Z4VT,"Don Henley is one of those artists people either love or hate:  he strikes one as either wise and insightful or smug and arrogant.  In ""Live Inside Job,"" Henley reminds us that whatever the viewer's opinion of him, he's written an impressive list of songs that spans three decades.  The concert (taken in part from A&E's ""Live By Request"" broadcast) leans heavily on songs from ""Inside Job,"" although there is a good sampling from all of Henley's solo albums.  Eagles fans who buy the DVD may be disappointed by the sparsity of Eagles songs, although Henley closes with a ska/reggae version of ""Hotel California"" that is worth the the price of the DVD alone.  The DVD has a few drawbacks:  at times, the sound mix is bad (Henley's vocals on ""Taking You Home"" are almost inaudible at first) and there are virtually no extras (a couple videos would have been a nice touch).  Those are minor disadvantages, though, and the concert itself is an enjoyable reminder of how blue-eyed soulful a singer Henley still is.  This is a nice addition to anyone's collection of music DVD's.",974592000,10,1074,4.736559139784946

1380215,5,B00004Z4VT,"This is a great concert film! The production is top-notch - great camera work and excellent sound. Mr. Henley is backed by an outstanding band, and they rip through an eclectic mix of Henley's songs - from old Eagles tunes to newer (2000) ones. And don't forget about all of that great solo work from the 80's! One thing is sure to amaze you as you watch this: Don Henley can sing his ass off! He is belting them out strong and on-key all the way through. What a Voice! But then, you probably already knew that :) RCL, 2014.",1403827200,,524,4.25
1380216,5,B00004Z4VT,Henley truly knows how to sing properly and takes care of his voice. He also aims to sing perfectly every time. There are a lot of live recordings of Henley solo and with The Eagles. I have not heard one where he was not hitting it out of the ballpark. The solo album that this DVD's tour was supporting had a lot of good songs. He also performs other solo and Eagles material. Whether it is audio or video I prefer live recordings to capture a true live performance for the attending audience. I do not like staged live shows set up for the sake of making a DVD. This show is good enough in that regard however they did do a fake announcer overdub. I'd have preferred that the band just walk onto the stage without an announcement (which is probably the way they did it that night) rather than have some person pretending to be announcing the show. This did not warrant a penalty in rating but it was worth mentioning. Otherwise enjoy the show. Henley's voice is in tip top shape as usual and the band is tight.,1401235200,,1012,4.303664921465969
1380239,5,B00004Z4VT,"Good mix of past and present.

1380240,4,B00004Z4VT,"This is one wonderful concert to watch. Having been a Henley fan for many decades, it is easy to like, but when I saw this version of Hotel California I was absolutely blown away. I must now watch and listen to that particular version it on a daily basis  for my Tex Mex fix. Super innovative and always puts me in a good mood.",1392940800,,327,4.109375
1380241,5,B00004Z4VT,"This is one of my favorite concert dvds. Don Henley is masterful on stage and his music, whether solo or with the Eagles is top notch. Great songs, many hits...",1388361600,,160,4.366666666666666
1380242,5,B00004Z4VT,"I have always been a big fan of The Eagles, but I never seen any solo DVD's of the brains behind the band.  This showcases numerous eagles tunes along with solo songs that Henley has released over his illustrious solo career.

Eagles fan or not, I highly recommend this DVD.  It has all the old-school tunes like 'All She Wants To Do is Dance, Dirty Laundry, End Of Innocence, along with new, hip, up-beat songs Henley recently wrote for his 'Inside Job' album like 'Workin' It'",1379289600,,478,4.534883720930233

Pay attn. to the mini-interview of Henly as he briefly discusses what he has been up to since Eagles Break Up I around 1981-82:  solo work and tours, 1994-Hell Freezes Over and subsequent tours, and marriage and three kids, this solo concert is in 2000 and with all the great Henley songs:  Boys of Summer, Dirty Laundry, All She Wants to Do Is Dance, Sunset Grill, End of the Innocence, the Heart of the Matter, New York Minute, some songs from his new record at the time, and a few Eagles songs to close:  Desperado, Hotel California with a Latino music beat and the horn section doing the solo guitar parts at the end.  musicianshiip excellent and some of these artists joined the Eagles for their Eagles Farewell I Tour

1380246,5,B00004Z4VT,"OMG, This dvd is for all Henley fans. The audio is outstanding and he does pretty much all of his best songs. There is a couple of songs where the lead guitar is too faint but overall a good buy. I would have loved to see this in person!!",1362009600,,238,3.877551020408163
1380247,5,B00004Z4VT,"I have always loved The Eagles, but my favorite songs were written and sung by Don Henley. This DVD is from a concert that was shown on TV years ago. I had a video tape that still sounded great, but the picture was really rough. I was pleased to find the DVD and destroy the video tape. I would recommend if you are a fan.",1338422400,,322,3.9692307692307693

Now...as to the Don Henley dvd...If you love the Eagles, most likely you will love this dvd, ""Don Henley Live - Inside Job"". Pure Don Henley and songs that you do not hear with the Eagles.

Just an important note as I was a little disappointed (NO ONE'S FAULT) the format does not work with wide screen monitors. It simply does not fill the screen. Do not know about wide screen TV's.",1323129600,,644,4.543103448275862
1380259,5,B00004Z4VT,"This is real music.  We don't need a $100M venue here to be entertained.  Moved me to tears several times.  The Heart of the Matter and The End of the Innocence get me every time.  He just stands there and doesn't have to even try, and is superb.  His speaking voice sounds NOTHING like his singing voice, which is neat.  I would highly recommend this.  Don Henley is one of the very few artists whose solo work equals/exceeds their work with their bands.",1315440000,,455,4.409638554216867
1380260,5,B00004Z4VT,"Frank Zappa, in his humorous social commentary, Henley is not. They are both one of a kind, with Zappa being the better musician. As far as songwriting, well, I'm simply going to say I think Henley has always been an excellent songwriter and was/is even a better one as a solo artist. He may not get the laughs Zappa did with his unique brand of humor, and maybe it's not quite a fair comparison, but the point is that they both took/take their work seriously and each has their own personal and effective way in getting their points across. Were Henley trying to be a Zappa, Kiss, or a myriad of other artists, he wouldn't be himself and he wouldn't get his great songs across. This is a very enjoyable dvd and any Henley fan and new to Henley people will find this very well done and will feel as if they had walked out of the concert hall quite satisfied. Please, Zappa fans, understand my point as I am a huge Zappa fan and I did commit that Zappa is the better musician!",1308614400,,975,4.304347826086956
1380261,5,B00004Z4VT,It was awesome had all of the greatest Don Henley hits of all time. And it included the Eagles tunes Hotel California and Deperado.,1293321600,,131,4.5
1380262,5,B00004Z4VT,Simply a great live video production as you would expect of one of the Eagles. His renditions of Taking You Home and Everything is Different Now (with a terrific backup choral group) are my faves. The Boys of Summer is noteworthy for its more original sounding guitar tracks.,1271203200,,275,4.75
1380263,5,B00004Z4VT,"One of the most surprising CD's from Henley in his career; at his best. Recorded in 2000 when his voice was at it's apex this collection ranges from a rocking ""Nobody Else In The World But You,"" with Stevie Wonder to a super rocking ,""Miss Ghost,"" with Randy Jackson and Jimmie Vaughan. This slamming song has got to be up there on top with his best. Henley is known for his no holds bared lyrics and this lives up to his reputation of telling it like it is. ""Damn It, Rose,"" is a prime example. A must CD for Henley fans, you won't be disapointed with this one. I gave it 5 stars.",1258416000,,581,4.150442477876106
1380264,5,B00004Z4VT,You can see the class in the driving force behind the Eagles in this DVD. His voice is unique and evokes many emotions depending on the song. If you haven't heard his solo work this is a great introduction. An unusual version of Hotel California finishes it off. Great music DVD. The 5.1 audio is top quality.,1213747200,,309,4.43859649122807
1380265,5,B00004Z4VT,"Live - Inside Job is Don Henley at his best. From his solo career to his years with The Eagles, it's all covered here! Henley rocks on ""All She Wants To Do Is Dance"" while inciting so many great memories with ""Desperado"". This a concert no Eagles fan or Henley fan should miss owning! I only wish there were more concerts available by both the Eagles and Don Henley on DVD. I'd own them ALL!!",1173312000,2,392,4.24
1380266,4,B00004Z4VT,"Everytime I had a chance to see Don Henley performing live, either in a concert( unfortunately the only one I had the chance to attend was while living in London back in 1989/1990 ) or in DVD's, like the Eagles one or this latest ""Inside Job"", I realize that I am watching an intelligent and very mature artist with a perfect sense on how to deliver good music.

I must admit that I would have liked to see a couple of more songs from ""The end of the innocence "" album in this concert DVD but overall the selection is well balanced between some older stuff and his latest work. I would really like to see him recording some new material soon and hopefully, that at some point in time he decides to tour again and perform in more southern latitudes... more precisely in my hometown Buenos Aires. Lets hope that he does... I'm sure that the audience would be gratefull, as it always happens in this country with artists of the level of Mr. Don Henley.",1163030400,,949,4.361581920903955
1380267,5,B00004Z4VT,"A friend of mine suggested I watch The Eagles Hell Freezes Over and I got hooked ever since! I take my music very seriously and the Eagles are awesome! I bought this video because in my opinion, The Eagles are an awesome band! I heard some reviewers saying that Don Henley in this concert is not flashly and looks like he put on weight and can't hit the high notes like he used to, my response to this is, Don Henley is in his 50's, put yourself in his shoes, if you would to be his age, you too would be a little more heavy set, just think about what you say, before you say it. This Video I give 5 stars across the board, the man is extremely talented, yes he is a little older, but dudes and dudettes he is not 20 any more, and his talent at his age will give most the run for their money. If you are reading this and are sincere about music, especially the Eagles and Don Henley, he is awesome and I wish he could live for ever! Get this video, you are not wasting your money.",1119484800,7,980,4.005102040816326
1380268,5,B00004Z4VT,"I have been a fan of Don Henley since I was just a little girl and I still love his music today. After seing The Eagles live recently and listening to their music and watching their DVD -- I just couldn't get enough of them, especially of Don who is my favourite band member so when I found this DVD I was thrilled. Buying it was money well spent. It's a great show by a great performer and WOW what a voice this man has. What tallent! His music is timeless. I loved practically everything about this DVD and there are lots of familiar songs. I wasn't keen on Hotel California but I have Hell Freezes Over and can watch it on that. All the other songs are brilliant!! Don's version of HC was obviously meant to be different and that's what it is -- variety and for that I like what he has done. Some comments here about him thinking he is 'God' in the concert are just uncalled for and frankly rude. He is a singer, on stage, giving a concert. What do you expect him to do, hide out the back and sing from there? He is having a fun time and enjoying himself.",1101859200,4,1058,4.115942028985507
1380280,4,B00004Z4VT,"...this DVD is a great experience.  One thing that I have liked about Eagles concerts and live albums is that the songs are played pretty much as they are done on the studio albums, and Henley has continued this tradition.  Henley is a serious musician and it shows: the production of the music is very controlled, not one note too many or too few.  Though I would have liked to have seen some raucous guitar solos a la Joe Walsh, that didn't happen.  But I liked the control and professionalism the band showed.  (In fact, because the guitar players weren't all over the place, I picked up a couple of licks.)  The filming was very good, very professional and clear, not at all dark or out-of-focus.  The closeups of the musicians were adequate, but I would have enjoyed seeing the camera linger on them longer, and some of their solos did get short shrift.  Some of my favorite songs were played, such as ""Everything is Different Now"", ""Taking You Home"" and ""Boys of Summer"".  Henley's voice showed strong and controlled.  I did notice that some of the songs are in a lower key than originally sung (""Taking to the Moon"", ""Heart of the Matter"") but that would not be noticeable to any but a musician who had played those songs.  Anyone watching the DVD will enjoy the music, but a casual viewer could feel visually shortchanged.  One could enjoy a CD version of this nearly as much as the DVD, and for that reason I give it four rather than five stars.",1101427200,,1454,4.50763358778626
1380281,3,B00004Z4VT,"If you are looking for a concert full of spectacular effects, go and purchase ""Cher in concert"". Let's face it, Don Henley is not a stage show, but he is a fantastic songwriter.  This concert filmed in 2000, displays some of his solo songs, and some songs from his contribution as a key member of the Eagles.

I was looking very forward to watching this DVD.  However, I was disappointed as the show lacked any spark, and his voice is not as good as it once was.  In fact, he seemed to have trouble reaching the high notes on several occasions.

This DVD comes with DTS, 5.1 surround sound and 2.0.  Both DTS and 5.1 sound quite tinny and lack substantial bass. I recommend viewers selecting the 2.0 mix.

DVD highlights include ""Taking You Home"" and ""Desperado"".  As other reviewers have stated, his new version of ""Hotel California"" is dreadful. Skip that particular song.",1095552000,4,874,4.62987012987013
1380282,5,B00004Z4VT,"It seems, as time goes on, Henley just gets better. With the eagles he came up with 'The Last Resort' possibly one of the prettiest use of chord sequences about and powerful words to accompany them. Then solo with classics 'The End Of The Innocence' and 'New York Minute' and now with what I regard the best two tracks on this album 'Goodbye To A River' and 'Damn It Rose'. The latter trying to convey the suicide of a close friend. What you hear is what you get with Henley. He has to be the finest vocalist 'live' I've encountered. As for his songwriting let me put it this way, I'd put him up next to Roger Waters with the way his songs always manage to move me. Shame they left the two best songs form the album off the DVD. Splendid work Mr Henley. Time to take another eleven year break it was worth the wait.",1080259200,,815,4.197452229299363
1380283,5,B00004Z4VT,"Don Henley isn't, and never will be, a flamboyant artist and this DVD only serves to prove it. The man takes his music very seriously and expects to be taken seriously in return. What this serves to produce is a very polished stage performance.
As with Eagles performances, ""Live: Inside Job"" is an extremely good display of top quality musicianship. Henley gives impassioned and nearly flawless renditions of the best of his solo career, some Eagles material (including a twist on the classic ""Hotel California"") and some good new material. He is well backed up by an excellent band and choir.
This is an excellently produced DVD. None of the material seems out of place, it is visually pleasing but most importantly with anything that Henley does the sound is rich and enveloping. All in all this is a fantastic listening experience for Henley fans but also for anyone who can appreciate good musicianship.",1061337600,14,908,4.902597402597403
1380284,5,B00004Z4VT,"I have been a long time Eagles fan and particular favored all the artists that have come through including henley, fry, schmidt, walsch, etc..... You cannot compare ""hell freezes over"" with ""inside job"" for a number of reasons.. First of all""Hell freezes over to me is the bench mark of reproduction of live concert that with all those boys together puts on a show like no other... to me Timmothy B has great singing ability, Walsch has his own unique blend of input into the show that he does not get credit for and truely has great abilities... Henley I feel has more passion in his singing surrounded by these guys however in Inside job if you truely want to appreciate the  man, the song writer, the ""passion"" it is a great concert and dvd... great quality as a music experience and not a flashy show but great quality music.. My only dissapointment is the changing of Hotel California. He should have finished a more traditional version but who am I to judge. There are so many classics but as usual coming off this new album ""Taking you home"" will always be a favorite... ""everything is different now"" is a great version and a underated song along with ""My thanksgiving"" Desperado in his last verse makes a difference than the usual, and "" There not here, they're not coming"" is just a fun road song.... My last comments are as a person myself with a love of music, Henly truely is a great song writer..",1047600000,2,1409,4.525490196078431
1380285,5,B00004Z4VT,"Great DVD!  I agree with others that the DTS mix is not as good as 'Hell Freezes Over' but it's certainly a pleasant listening experience.
One thing I notice with my DVD (which I'm not sure if it's a defect or what) is that, on either the DTS or DD version, the rear surround speakers seem to become more noticeable half way in the middle of the flute solo at the beginning of Lilah.  You can actually hear the flute sound move from the front to the rear speakers (hummm!?!).  Before that point, there is not much going on in the rear speakers, but after that point, the surround experience is greater with more instrumentation and background vocals coming from the rear.  Is it just me?!?  I'll probably return the DVD for another copy to hear if it acts the same way.
None the less, the sound quality is very clean and this DVD is a keeper!",1040947200,3,842,4.337579617834395

This effort by Henley is worth adding to your collection, if for no other reason than the captivating new treatment of ""Hotel California"", but the background vocals and instrumental work on traditional Eagles songs falls far short of the magnificent talent displayed by the original personnel on ""Hell Freezes Over"".",1031961600,,528,5.068965517241379
1380287,5,B00004Z4VT,"As I expected, Don Henley never ceases to amaze me with his distinct voice and his cool, sophisticated stage presence.  I saw this concert in Columbus, Ohio in 2000 and walked away one satisfied lady with Don's new songs and of course, ""End of the Innocence"" and ""Sunset Grill"".  I have a surround sound stereo system and this DVD is usually my top request - listen to ""Everything is Different Now"" and ""My Thanksgiving"" - I guarantee you will not be disappointed.  Don't expect a lot of onstage activity with this concert; grab your bottle of wine, kick back, and enjoy the show...it is quality musical entertainment from this outstanding artist.",1029369600,,647,4.8108108108108105
1380288,5,B00004Z4VT,"If there is anyone out there that would still argue that Dolby's Prologic is the format of choice for music, they obviously don't have DTS dialed in properly in their home theater. This DVD is the finest example to date of DTS at its best. Clean, Pure. It will expose any shortcomings in the reproduction chain -- even tiny ones -- so be careful.
Yes, there are a few weak points in the DVD, but it sounds to me like that can be traced to the miking, quality of microphones used, etc. This is that clean a recording -- you can hear the subtleties. MUCH better than Eagles DVD, even the DTS version. Fuller. More dynamic. Like being there.
I have played this DVD for friends over and over, and everyone of them runs out the next day to pick it up. Great engineering and sound quality, plus the video is also well above average.",1029110400,,826,4.335483870967742
1380289,5,B00004Z4VT,"Picked this up after hearing the Hell Freezes Over DVD and was totally thrilled at the great song selection, the great sounding band and especially the ""TEX MEX"" version of Hotel California.  I don't understand the complaints about the new version.  If you want to hear the old version, listen to the Eagles CD.  It is nice to see a new twist to an old classic. Loved the horns.  The new songs were a nice addition to Henley's classics, especially ""Everything is Different Now"".  The only complaint is that I felt the audio didn't take full advantage of DTS and DD as well as Hell Freezes Over.  Still sounded great though.",1013644800,,623,4.5675675675675675
1380310,5,B00004Z4VT,"For the life of me I cant see how ANYONE can knock the performance and more importantly the sound of this concert. If your playing this on a decent surround system in DTS mode and it's not ROCKIN YOUR A** OFF, then you need a new system or a new set of ears. Cause this is one of the best recordings and performances on DVD that's out there folk's, trust me. I was inspired to write this review after seeing a couple of the one star reviews below, due to the SOUND????? You've got to be kidding me! Everytime I play this concert (especially Boys of Summer), I thank ""GOD"" for DVD cause it's the next best thing to being there. Do yourself a favor and ignore these ""audio challenged"" individuals and get this concert, it is a GEM!",1009497600,,729,4.251798561151079
1380311,1,B00004Z4VT,This DVD is a sad example of DVD audio.  I was hoping that the earlier Eagles recording of 7 bridges road would have been the start of something great.  This DVD failed to capture the quality of most modern CD recordings.  Don's voice was not centered and was smeared between the left and right channels.  The rear surround channels were a joke and consisted mostly of croud noises...yea...I paid for that???  If you like Don's music save the bucks and buy a CD recording.  If you don't like his music avoid this at all costs.,1000598400,7,526,4.484210526315789
1380312,4,B00004Z4VT,"I like this DVD.  It is a straight forward concert - no fluff between tracks - just live music.  The songs are performed just like the originals and are excellent.
I did find myself chuckling outloud during Hotel California but not because I didn't enjoy it.  I chuckled because of the comments made by Mr. Narez in his review here on Amazon - I got a funny visual of what he must have gone through with his friends watching HC, especially when the trombone section played the blistering guitar solo of the original Eagles version.  I missed the original HC, but enjoyed this version too.
If you like Don's CD's, buy this.",997401600,,622,4.526785714285714
1380313,3,B00004Z4VT,"I thought I have another gold to be added to my dvd concert collection unitl I heard Henley's solo version of HOTEL CALIFORNIA, it was a disaster in the highest intensity, I & my friends nearly died laughing and me , I was so embarrassed because before we played it I keep telling them that somebody  wrote in the review that the HC version is  worth the dvd (what a fool I was to believe that). How in the world could he allow himself in ruining the national anthem of many of the EAGELS believers!!!I condemn him for doing this!!! Fortunately for Henley he included the EAGLES' In The Long Run, this save his ass!!!....and compare the guitarists that Henley hired to join him here with EAGLES' Don Felder & Joe Walsh, they are 3000 miles away from Hell Freezes Over! Anyhow this is still a good dvd, good song choices and good audio on both DTS and DD, I could have rated it with 5 star but Henley's version of HC took away 2 stars! So come on Don redeem yourself!!!!",995414400,3,969,4.318681318681318

In terms of DTS Sound quality, I would put this  2nd to what I judge all other in my collection to as the best in DTS sound quality to: (Eagles - when hell freezes over DTS)
Yes, Hotel California is terrible (arrangement wise) But if you like Don Henley's music, you will really appreciate the DTS sound quality of this DVD.",992822400,,420,4.384615384615385

ES EVIDENTE QUE NO ES FACIL REEMPLAZAR LOS COROS QUE LE HACIAN SUS VIEJOS COMPAEROS DE RUTA, Y DE LA BANDA, CREO QUE ES SOLO CORRECTA, MUY PROFESIONAL, PERO NO APORTA NADA NUEVO. SI UNO QUISIERA SABER DE QUE SE TRATA EL SONIDO DTS, ESTE NO ES UN BUEN EJEMPLO, YA QUE ES MUY INFERIOR AL DVD DE EAGLES, DONDE UNO PUEDE APRECIAR EL SONIDO DTS EN SU PLENITUD, ACA EN CAMBIO LO QUE MAS SE NOTA ES UNA MUY MARCADA TENDENCIA A LOS SONIDOS AGUDOS, SOBRE TODO EN LA VOZ DE DON, QUE LLEGAN A MOLESTAR. LA IMAGEN ES BUENA Y LAS CANCIONES ESTAN A LA ALTURA DE LA BUENA VOZ DE DON, PERO PERSONALMENTE REITERO QUE ESTE DVD ES MUY INFERIOR AL DE EAGLES.",984960000,,1052,4.151960784313726

HOTEL CALIFORNIA AND BRASS DO NOT MIX.
Yes. It's that bad.
Desperado, as always, is a classic. if you want some great stuff by henley, you can't forget about the rest of the boys... go get When Hell Freezes Over.",981849600,,477,4.195652173913044
