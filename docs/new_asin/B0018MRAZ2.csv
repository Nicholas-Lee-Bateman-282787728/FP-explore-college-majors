8270119,5,B0018MRAZ2,"""Up CloSe With Josh Groban"" is a little gem of a DVD that was available only at Walmart for $5.00, about a month before the release of ""Awake Live"", which cost considerably more. It contains four songs(three written by Josh) performed live in a very intimate setting with a small audience. The result is pure gold-the excitement of a live performance paired with the superior sound of a studio recording. Every JG fan should have this, and anyone who does not know him will find him irresistable after this priceless introduction. Highly collectible!",1358467200,,550,4.924731182795699
8270120,1,B0018MRAZ2,"Although I really like Groban and I'm sure this would have been a good album, when I recieved it the CD didn't play on any of the 3 systems I tried it on.

Extemely disappointed and willnot buy from this vendor again.  Just wasted my money.",1345334400,,240,4.195652173913044
8270121,1,B0018MRAZ2,"This is NOT the Josh Groban AWAKE LIVE DVD - you will receive Up Close With Josh Groban which is 4 songs from the Awake DVD.  Very Misleading unless you read the entire page before buying.  My sister had this on her wish list and I had to return (thanks Amazon), because I knew it was not what she meant to ask for.",1324598400,2,315,3.984126984126984
8270122,5,B0018MRAZ2,"I became a Josh Groban fan after he did this concert tour, so I missed the tour.  It's great to be back there and experience the thing.  Josh is a great singer, funny, creative, full of surprises.  His voice is huge and booming, but versatile.  His instrumentals are as big as his voice.  The whole things just grabs you and doesn't let you go.",1288656000,5,344,4.3125
8270123,1,B0018MRAZ2,I AM A GROBAN FAN BUT CD WAS A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT.  IT ONLY HAD 4 SONGS THAT WERE ON OTHER ALBUMS OF HIS. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,1264636800,2,130,3.814814814814815

8270125,5,B0018MRAZ2,Thank you for the prompt and efficient service. I expected it to take four weeks to arrive in Australia however it only took two. I would use your company again in the future.,1243036800,,175,4.333333333333333
