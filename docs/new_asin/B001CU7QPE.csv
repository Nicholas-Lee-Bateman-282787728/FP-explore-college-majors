8290008,2,B001CU7QPE,"a deep sea mystery this is most definitely NOT!  i would not call where sunken ships are already known to be by so many witnesses barely under water to be in the 'deep sea.' at the main Royal Navy base at Scapa Flow. This  is a tediously strung out story and no one except those hiding under rocks knows the Germans scuttled their own ships. They were to be dispersed among various allies, Lord knows the British Royal Navy didn't want any of them. Their own navy was destined for downsizing anyway. That early 20th century naval arms race was won by the British. If there is any lesson here it is those dreadnaughts on both sides were so enormously expensive their respective governments were reluctant to let them out of safe harbor to fight. They did so but once in an inconclusively fought battle off Jutland. Of more interest and perhaps much less known was the subsequent efforts of one salvage company to raise as many as possible for scrap value. a book about that is far more interesting and I would encourage its reading.",1445040000,,1031,4.537634408602151
8290009,3,B001CU7QPE,"I actually like the Deep Sea series, but in this one most of the show was spent on ""investigating"" something which was a mystery to no one; it was always known that the German Navy scuttled its own ships while interned at Scapa Flow to prevent their reassignment to navies of the victorious nations. More of the show should have included footage of the remaining wrecks and even the ultimate fates of the ships which were raised and recommissioned. I thought it was disappointing, when it could have been dramatic.",1402617600,2,514,4.722222222222222
