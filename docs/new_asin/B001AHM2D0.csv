Sorry I bought it...could not give it away. Handsome young man on cover...I would be willing to bet he is sorry he starred in such a piece of trash.",1449014400,,285,4.339622641509434

8277469,5,B001AHM2D0,This movie has such a great message. It is a very real movie addressing the real issues going on in the world today. I enjoyed the movie and the lasting impression of the message it sends.,1221436800,,188,4.25
8277470,5,B001AHM2D0,"With the constant ""anti-immigration"" diatribes spewing from the political pundits these days, it was refreshing to see a film that put a human face on this controversy. Gritty, realistic, caustic, with a lasting message certain to stir anyone regardless of which side of the immigration isle you reside.  While it is definitely an ""indie"" film shot on a shoestring budget, the story is as compelling as any big Hollywood budget film.  If the immigration issue interests you, Border Wars, is a must see. As ""Maria Full of Grace"" humanized the struggles of a young female drug smuggler, ""Border Wars"" encapsulates the plight of extreme patriot caught up in immigration battles of today.",1219968000,,684,5.098214285714286
8277471,5,B001AHM2D0,I live close to the border in Southern California and this movie is very realistic.  I would encourage you to take a look at what happens on a daily basis.  Spread the word about this movie especially with the presidential nomination up for grabs; it is important to educate ourselves with this hot topic and choose which president would be best to control our borders.  Kudos to those who put this movie together.  Well done!,1219968000,2,426,4.64
8277472,5,B001AHM2D0,"This is a must see movie, especially in the time we live in. The language is a little rough, but it fits the setting, unfortunately. Buy, rent, see this movie. I have worked with Ryan Noble in the past and he is an excellent director. His attention to detail has impressed me. He is an up and coming person in the movie industry.",1219968000,,329,4.238095238095238
8277473,5,B001AHM2D0,"See it, if you can't rent it somewhere....Buy it... or ask your local Hollywood Video or Blockbuster to buy it...worth seeing over and over",1219968000,,139,4.833333333333333
