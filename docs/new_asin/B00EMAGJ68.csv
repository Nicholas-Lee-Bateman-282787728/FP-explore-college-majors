5927726,5,B00EMAGJ68,"I had read the novel Thrse Desqueyroux when I was an adolescent and had hated it. Seeing the film made me want to read it again and I was amazed at how faithful the film was to the book. The actors are wonderful. I found Gilles Dellouche in the role of Bernard, the husband, nicer in the film than in the novel. Audrey Tautou, famous for Amlie, shows what a dramatic actress she can be!",1389830400,9,386,4.16
5927727,3,B00EMAGJ68,"Warning: plot spoiler included

I had mixed feelings about this film.
What I loved:  the beauty of the location and filming, the outdoor lifestyle, the settings
What troubled me:  the selfish cruelty of how Therese dealt with her unhappiness.  Instead of having the guts to extricate herself in a way that would only risk herself, she resorts to a cruel means to try to free herself.  I had a hard time sympathizing with her after that, especially seeing her lack of empathy or remorse.
What helped: there was some redemption later on, and some touching final scenes.",1389398400,6,567,4.804123711340206
5927728,4,B00EMAGJ68,excellent movie and performance by Audrey Tautou. Therese is in a situation that is out of her nature. She lives in the old world of living when young women had to accept the situation in which they married.,1389139200,,207,4.473684210526316
5927729,4,B00EMAGJ68,"This film boasts wonderful sets, clothes, music, and cinematography.  The acting is all first rate also.  Much of the story is told with a minimum of strokes, so don't expect to have it all spelled out.  There are also no clear-cut answers or endings, so if that drives you crazy you might want to skip it.  If you enjoyed the last film by Miller/Tautou - Secret - you'll probably be up for this one.  I'd compare it to the classic Merchant/Ivory films.",1388361600,14,453,4.475609756097561
5927730,3,B00EMAGJ68,"Set in the mid 1920's,Therese, chronicles the  marriage of two French aristocrats whose wealth comes from owning large tracts of land. They live in manor houses on estates covered with pine forests and generally have almost nothing to do beyond hunting, dining and worrying about the respectability of the family name. Tradition runs deep and we quickly learn that everyone adheres closely to it.

As the film opens, Therese is shown as a relatively normal teenager playing and laughing with her best friend Anne, whose brother she is expected to marry. We learn that Anne has taken up the aristocratic sport of hunting, which Therese finds appalling but there is little more exposition of Therese's character and the film jumps to her short courtship and marriage.  Therese and her intended, an older man named Bernard, both agree that it is good to marry their forests together, but other than that they appear to have little in common. We assume that the coming marriage will have little passion, but the movie is really about Therese's deeper compulsions.

As her wedding approaches there is a short scene with Anne in which Therese states that she is having thoughts she shares with no one and believes that marriage will correct them. She repeats this to Bernard and we get the feeling that perhaps she is protesting the lack of intellectual respect for women and their thoughts. At this point the viewer is prepared to learn more about her views and how they are thwarted by the society she lives in.  Without giving away too many details of the story, my problem with the film stems from the fact that the nature of these thoughts and her subsequent behaviors are never explored or foreshadowed in a satisfying manner.  She maintains an eerie, silent demeanor filled with pregnant glances for most of the film.  While Tautou's acting is engaging, her character does not explain the things she does or what she wants. It is left up to other characters to infer her motives and ambitions because she never once articulates them. In the end the film leaves us with more questions than answers and confuses any ideas we may form about her inner workings and who she wants to be or will become.",1387065600,17,2197,4.796296296296297
5927731,3,B00EMAGJ68,"It is the summer of 1922.  Two French girls, Therese (Audrey Tautou) and Anne (Anais Demoustier), nearing the cusp of womanhood are enjoying the simple pleasures of the French countryside.  Riding their bikes, playing tag, and dreaming about the future.  Fast-forward six years and Therese is about to marry Anne's brother Bernard (Gilles Lellouch).  We sense the first tinge of trouble when Therese says her head is ""too full of ideas"" and she hopes marriage will settle her down.  She hopes marriage will save her and she will be ""at peace"", she confesses.  These are never good reasons to marry. The viewer may wonder if she has a mental illness.  Later, you may wonder even more.

It's a marriage of convenience, rich marrying rich.  The provincial marrying the boor.  As psychologists say, when you marry for money, you earn every cent.  Therese and Bernard will both experience that by the end of this film.  Therese longs for something else.  She glimpses what she longs for when she meets the first love of Anne. Jean (Stanley Weber) talks of spurning conventionality and dreams big dreams.  You sense it is wakening something in her.  But there are so little choices for women who dream, who marry young, and are stuck in the French countryside.  You pity them.  You pity their servants even more.

This movie could be titled ""Desperate Measures"", as Therese goes to desperate measures to free herself.  She envisions herself doing desperate things.  And she acts on some of her visions.  Therese is not necessarily a sympathetic character, nor is her husband or their families. However, you see how imprisoned she is because of the times, narrow choices for women and her location.  We never discuss feelings, Therese admits to Jean.  We discuss hunting and the weather.

I enjoyed watching the film to listen to the French, watch Mme. Tatou (although her lips are pursed most of the time and her expression vacant), and look at the French decor.  The homes of both families are exquisite.  I kept wishing the characters would move so I could see the decor.  However, it's a depressing film.  Tatou has none of her familiar sparkle - it has been stamped out by her depression and repression. The film doesn't resolve much as Therese's desires are so ill-formed.  She doesn't know what she wants as she apparently has been stuck in the French countryside all of her life.  How can you dream of something you have never seen? The character is from my grandmothers' generation, born around the turn of the 20th century.  It's interesting to compare her life to theirs.

The movie advances slowly.  It captures the characters' desperation as they are caught in circumstances.  If you like dark, slow moving films which examine circumstances and emotions, you may love the film.  I prefer something more buoyant.  By the end of the film, Therese's circumstances have improved, but you don't see enough of them to be satisfied.  Her husband, the boor, is still living at the beck and call of propriety, being the good old boy as he says. There's one in every generation he says. The film is successful in capturing the emptiness of opportunity and feeling in lives which are lived by convention and not choice.  It is an adaptation of the novel by Franois Mauriac.",1386892800,12,3268,4.832129963898917

I must say that part of the problem was in the editing. I watched about 15 minutes and had to turn it off.
Let me warn all the couple out there too - this is NOT a date movie! This is one of those films that leaves you feeling miserable after you watch it.

5927740,2,B00EMAGJ68,"Seemed to drag.  Slow.  Good acting and cinematography, but too long.  I disliked Therese from start to finish.  Cold and detached, I didn't care about her plight, nor happy for her freedom in the end.  Was just happy when the film was over.",1399420800,,241,4.511627906976744
5927741,2,B00EMAGJ68,"Thrse tells the story of a wealthy woman (Thrse) who marries the older brother (Bernard) of her best friend (Anne). The movie quickly establishes that this is not a passionate marriage, but is one of mutual convenience. At one point, prior to their marriage, Thrse tells her fianc Bernard that ""part of the reason I'm marrying you is for your pines. I hope you realize that."" The movie details Thrse's dissatisfaction in her marriage, her gradual realization that it may be possible to have a passionate marriage (freed from the constraints of the traditional setting in which she was figuratively imprisoned), and her subsequent attempts at getting out of her marriage.

My first problem with the movie is the casting. Tautou is brilliant, but she's supposed to play a young early 20-something woman. In the movie, she looks older than Bernard, who is supposed to be several years her senior. This is compounded by the fact that her best friend, Anne, is played by a woman who is more than ten years Tautou's junior. This detail really bothered me. If they absolutely wanted Tautou to play the role of Thrse, then they should have gotten an older actress to play Anne, and they shouldn't have made Bernard look so young.

More importantly, Thrse is a very difficult character to like. She appears cold, detached, and unforgiving. It is difficult to care about a character with so little to draw the viewer to her. There is perhaps no better example of this coldness than Thrse's lack of interest for her newborn daughter. I found Gilles Lellouche's Bernard, in spite of all his simple provincialism, to be a much more interesting character. Clearly, the viewer is supposed to feel happiness and joy for Thrse at the end of the movie, but I felt no such feelings for a character who was, up until that point, a cold and unsmiling person.",1398643200,4,1837,4.773584905660377

8606818,5,B00EMAGJ68,"I've never read the book, so my review is based solely on the merits of the movie itself.

I'm usually not a fan of movies/stories that have the ""oh those poor rich people"" vibe to them, but this one was good. I really enjoyed Claude Miller's direction. I've always wanted to see one of his movies, and I'm definitely interested in seeing a few more after viewing this one. I thought the muted colours worked perfect with the subject matter. The visuals had a very earthy tone, which kind of plays with the notion that all of these characters owe their wealth to the earth.
In general, there's a feeling of detachment throughout the  film. There's the obvious emotional detachment between characters, which is certainly the main theme of the movie. But there's also the detachment of the wealthy from the rest of the world; a kind of cloistered extended family living in isolated opulence that's succumbing to decay. The notion of decay subtly runs throughout the film (e.g.; the references to mouldy walls, or the statements about a family name fading away).
I thought Audrey Tautou did great as the lead. I'd compare her role here in a favourable way to her turn as Coco Chanel in ""Coco Avant Chanel"".

I read a few reviews saying the movie was too slow, or that there wasn't enough drama/excitement. But I think that plays to real life, especially the notion of a quasi-arranged marriage done for the sake of convenience and wealth. There's not going to be  a lot of drama in a passionless relationship. Therese isn't  necessarily in any kind of dire straits (in terms of poverty or being in  a life-or-death situation) either, so desperation isn't a big motivating factor. Her state seems more of  a dull, oppressed ennui that takes a dark turn. A really dark turn.

If you're looking for drama and passion and heavy dialogue...this isn't a great movie.
I personally liked it because it's a movie you appreciate more when you're thinking about or discussing the themes and ideas of the movie after you watch it.",1519862400,,2015,4.720797720797721
8606819,5,B00EMAGJ68,"Despite the negative comments, ""Therese"" is an amazing film to watch if situated in its proper historical context: A woman in a rural area (in France or in any other Western country) had virtually no freedom in the 1920s. ""Therese"" is an adaptation of Francois Mauriac's ""Therese  Desqueyroux,"" which was published in 1927. The novel is available in English on Amazon.

8606822,4,B00EMAGJ68,"This film is a meditation about the madness that can ensue when a person lives too much inside of her own head.
