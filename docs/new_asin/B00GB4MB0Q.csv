8621922,1,B00GB4MB0Q,"I saw this concert already online when it was streamed live and it is AMAZING!

However, I am reviewing the PRODUCT.

THIS blu-ray is *not* for region 1 users (north america), which is misleading as it is listed on the amazon. COM and not .co.uk

If I were to order this, it would not play in my blu ray/dvd player.

Hopefully they can put a region-free or region 1 disc up. Fingers crossed.",1388707200,4,391,4.315068493150685
