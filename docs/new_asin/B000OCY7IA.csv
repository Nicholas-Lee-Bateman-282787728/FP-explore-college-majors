8184470,5,B000OCY7IA,I found it be real & enlightening!  Professional athletes are superior people even though they don't know it!  This was a good taste for the average fan.  I hope the Bonds legacy gets the recognition they deserve!,1516060800,,213,4.702702702702703

8184472,1,B000OCY7IA,"I was hoping that this DVD would show tons of highlight footage of Barry Bonds' actual accomplishments on the field, not just his home runs, but his fielding, base stealing, etc.  If you added up all the actual historical ""highlight"" video footage, it would be the total sum of less than 3 minutes.  Very disappointing.

This dvd was less about baseball and more about the press getting even with what they dislike about Barry and his alleged steroid use - the first 30+ minutes is dedicated only to this - then they do about a 10+ minute bio on his life, then go back to the steroid controversy.  What you purchase is countless negative video opinions from sports writers, ex-team mates, coaches, etc., video of Barry's most cynical answers about his own personality and/or career, plus his arguements on and off the field with the press. The ""bonus features"" are actually better than the main featured story - but again, only interview footage.

I would NOT recommend this dvd to anyone who wants to view the video highlights of Barry's baseball career and/or an unbiased bio of the life of Barry Bonds.",1358380800,3,1105,4.734375
8184473,5,B000OCY7IA,"Great footage of baseball's best player ever - enhanced or not.  The story doesn't dodge all the controversy, but it also doesn't linger on it at the expense of showing key footage of the Bonds historic career. When you see how talented, fast and strong he is as a ""youngster"" you'll wonder why he ever thought he needed to bulk up.
All the ESPN bios are great -- and on sale cheap since they must have produced too many of them.",1321401600,,429,4.296296296296297
