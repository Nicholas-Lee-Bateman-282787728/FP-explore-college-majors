5647107,5,B00BM9FTKY,"Just when you think Ellen Barrett can't come up with something else that is great, you are proven wrong.  This is a workout in which you use only your own body strength, yet your arms will be very sore at the end.  She put out two new DVDs which run for 30 minutes.  I was drenched by the end of this one.  Sometimes I only have time for a 30 minute workout.  She is such a pleasant instructor and always easy to follow.",1365292800,13,420,4.0120481927710845
5647108,5,B00BM9FTKY,I love her exercise DVDs and her positive attitude.  They  have made a difference in both my mind and my body.,1425081600,,110,4.190476190476191
5647109,5,B00BM9FTKY,Ellen Barrett is the best! Have most of her videos and I can say that this one is a favorite. You can get a great workout in 30 minutes which is great for busy people. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to get cardio and toning in a fun video.,1423699200,,258,3.8867924528301887
5647110,2,B00BM9FTKY,I love Elllen's workouts and I was excited to try this 30 min workout.  There is way too much repetition.  I hate when moves are repeated ad nauseum and so I turned it off 20 min in and did one of her other workouts instead.,1423353600,,224,3.9555555555555557
5647111,4,B00BM9FTKY,"Workout is 30 minutes long, low-impact.  Moves not hard, doesn't require a lot of coordination, but will help test your balance.  I'm not sure how good of a cardio workout this is, but it's good for times when I don't feel like doing high-impact exercises.  Instructor talks a lot so I tune her out.  She performs a lot of lunges and I could feel it the next day.",1417478400,,363,4.294117647058823
5647112,5,B00BM9FTKY,"I absolutely love this workout!!  Ellen Barrett makes the best workouts.  I always feel so good when I've done them -- worked and strengthened, but energized not wiped out.  Sometimes I'll wake up feeling achy and tired, then I pop in Ellen's DVDs and the aches and pains are gone, plus I got a great workout!  I don't mind the 45-50 minute workouts that made her famous, but sometimes I have to leave out parts of them to stick to my schedule, and I end up feeling like I short-changed myself.  Not so with the ""express"" series!  It's an entire workout, but compacted to only 30 minutes.  I didn't find the music annoying, as some reviewers have stated.  It might not be what I would typically listen to, but in my opinion, it suits the workout.
I already have her ""sculpting"" express DVD , but I would love it so much if Ellen made more of these!",1406764800,,848,4.356687898089172
5647113,3,B00BM9FTKY,"I really like Ellen Barrett's work out. There are some nice stretches, flexibility and dance moves incorporated into the workout. Unfortunately, there is only one workout on the DVD, I wish there were more.",1404691200,,206,5.088235294117647
5647114,5,B00BM9FTKY,I use Ellen Barrett tapes several times a week.  Love them and her.,1404259200,,67,4.153846153846154
5647115,5,B00BM9FTKY,"I own about 7 different Ellen Barrett workout dvd's and this one is my favorite.  I feel I get the most from this.  Its much more intense and only 30 minutes.  You get a lot of toning and cardio.  I love the music.  Its very relaxing and before you know it, the workout is done!  This is the first of her workouts that I have done that I wakeup barely walking.  Thanks to rainbow lunge!  That means its working!!  She's the best!",1400284800,,429,4.134146341463414
5647116,5,B00BM9FTKY,"Tried Ellen's newest workouts on cable. Liked them so much I ordered all three!
It's a nice change from all the other hyped-up routines on the circuit.",1398729600,,151,4.62962962962963
5647117,5,B00BM9FTKY,"I love Ellen Barrett her workouts are the perfect balance between cardio, pilates, core work, and yoga!!! Her videos are the perfect way to start your day.  I feel refresh and energized all day",1396656000,,193,4.676470588235294
5647119,5,B00BM9FTKY,"This is a fabulous video workout. I first saw it on comcast in their exercise lineup. For a week I watched and participated, then it was gone. I was lucky to find it on Amazon at a great price. I workout to this cd twice daily, 5 days a week. I enjoy the smooth moves, not jerky. As a 65 year young female with 2 Total hip replacements. I find Ellen Barrett easy to follow. The combination of the moves and her gentle style of incorporating each to conclude as one total body workout, leaves me sweaty not breathless. Overall this cd is easy to follow and fun to do. I totally recommend it for anyone who wants to sweat a little.",1394323200,,629,4.163934426229508
5647120,5,B00BM9FTKY,I actually found this on Comcast Demand and loved it.  I used it for about two months and now it's no longer On Demand :(  so I need to own it! .  It's fun and different.  You're doing hard work but it doesn't feel like it.  It was nice for those days I couldn't make it to the gym.,1390953600,,282,3.711864406779661
5647121,5,B00BM9FTKY,"Wow! Ellen does not mess around in this 30 minute workout!  I consider myself to be at a pretty advanced level, and she had me sweating and kept my heart rate up. I really appreciate the shorter workout time.  It helps me mentally to know that it's only 30 minutes; I find I can carve that much time out of my busy work/parenting schedule. I still love her 45 minute workouts, though, and do them on the weekends when I have more time. This workout is definitely worth the money!",1388880000,,479,4.311111111111111
5647122,5,B00BM9FTKY,This is one of those perfect workouts for packing a punch with limited time.  I love Ellen and this dvd helps me get in a quick workout on days were I normally would have missed one due to time crunches.  Thanks again Ellen - another killer workout.,1387843200,,249,4.276595744680851
5647123,3,B00BM9FTKY,"First, let me say that I really like Ellen Barrett DVDs.  Unfortunately, I didn't like this one because it's incredibly repetitive. However, it is a good workout, especially for a light day.  However, the same moves are done over and over and over in the DVD.  I know some people dislike ""happy feet,"" and if they do, then avoid this.  Most of Ellen's DVDs are around 45 minutes, and because this one is at 30 minutes, I thought I would like it.  However, the repetition bored me. I thought that once I got through the warm-up, it would get better, and then I realized it's the same moves throughout the DVD.

As always, the production values are great:  fun, upbeat music, good sound, good visuals, and nice set/studio.

Ellen is her usual cheerful and upbeat self, and she's motivating.

If you like Ellen and you are okay with repetition, you'll be okay with this.",1385424000,4,867,4.577922077922078
5647124,5,B00BM9FTKY,"Great workout, featuring Ellen's phenomenal queuing and trademark stretch-strength-cardio fusion fitness.  The music is upbeat and inspiring and the moves and sequencing are unique and fun.",1384387200,2,189,6.269230769230769
5647125,5,B00BM9FTKY,"Anything by Ellen is worth getting - she's made me WANT to exercise.  It's a good workout, but it still feels good (even when it kind of doesn't)  and you feel good after too!",1380672000,,175,4.117647058823529
5647126,3,B00BM9FTKY,"This one did not have the variety that her others have so it was not as fun. I have Fat Burning Fusion, Skinny Sculpt (my fave so far) and Power Fusion. I a planning on buying her others DVDs also. Her workout theory I right on with what my body needs. I come from a ballet background and really appreciate her attention to form during the workout. Def keeps you toned and looking slim.",1378598400,,386,4.22972972972973
5647127,3,B00BM9FTKY,"I have to admit, the first time I did this workout, I found myself a bit bored and looking at the time and thanking the lord it wasn't any longer than 30 minutes otherwise I'd be comatose.

I couldn't quite put my finger on it. It's not Ellen, she's still a superb instructor. And sure, the music is different to the ones on her previous DVDs but it doesn't have that awful mournful chanting (or wailing?) on her other new offering, Sleek Sculpt Express.

But I gave it another chance, because gosh darn it, I love Ellen's workouts - and she changed me from an ""I hate exercise"" and a ""Once a month is enough"" person to an ""I've worked out 5 days in a row, now I'm going to plan the workouts I'll do for the next 7 days!"" - now after the 2nd & 3rd time doing this workout, it has grown on me and I love the way the workout just flows from one move to another so well.

Super Fast Body Blast is about 30 minutes of cardio and there's quite a bit of repetition of the moves (i.e rainbow lunges - arghh! - I am not a fan of this move as it's uncomfortable on my toes to twist from side to side, so I just perform standard lunges). When you have a short amount of time, the variety in the workout will be less but that's so you can work on/perfect the moves you've learned. The emphasis is always on good form and working out with control. Having both of these means you'll achieve better results.

This DVD is great for when you have a limited amount of time to exercise. But my body doesn't feel like it has been blasted enough after this workout so I like to follow it up with Ellen's other new 30 minute offering (Sleek Sculpt Express).

Super Fast Body Blast + Sleek Sculpt Express = Now that's what I call a body blast! And boy does my booty hurt the next day.",1375660800,13,1762,4.1104651162790695
5647128,5,B00BM9FTKY,Ellen Barrett has a way of taking you through a workout without you realizing that you have just exercised every muscle in your body....but you'll know it the next day! Very low impact - lots of balance challenges - and a very fluid routine. Just what a balance challenged older woman needs! I now have 5 DVD's by Ellen and I love them all.,1374192000,2,340,4.328125
5647139,5,B00BM9FTKY,"I really like Ellen Barrett's DVDs and have most of her collection. I've been following her for about a decade. This workout is extremely intense, far more than I could have ever imagined. It really works the abs, thighs, legs and butt. I will definitely make this part of my rotating DVD series.",1373760000,4,296,4.60377358490566
5647140,3,B00BM9FTKY,I broke some sweat but it was really too repetitive and not fun at all! She basically builds a couple routines and repeats them over and over broken only by the not-so-happy feet! I liked her Fat burning fusion dvd but I don't think I will use the super fast dvd that often at all! Waste of money :(,1373587200,,299,4.084745762711864
5647141,5,B00BM9FTKY,"Love all of Ellen's workouts. This one is quick and to the point. It's a series of moves that she starts out slow then quickens. A bit repetitive, but hits all the muscle groups. And who really wants to think when they only have 30 min. to exercise?",1373587200,,249,4.208333333333333
5647142,5,B00BM9FTKY,"I have several of Ellen's workouts and they are all great. I just finished this one for the first time, and I can't believe how sweaty I got in 30 minutes. Ellen makes sure you are always using muscle, not momentum.  So every move has a purpose and an effect. Yes there is a lot of repetition here, but the only way a certain move can do its job is if you repeat it, so that doesn't bother me.  The workout still seems to go by pretty quickly. And can you say glutes and obliques?  Fabulous. I have weight to lose but work out regularly, so I am in decent shape. By the time I hit the last 5 minutes or so, I was pooped and ready for the end, so it's certainly enough of a challenge. This one will be part of my regular rotation for sure.  Definitely a keeper!",1373328000,,760,4.013245033112582
5647143,5,B00BM9FTKY,I just love all of Ellen's fitness fusion dvd's...I feel so good after Ellen's workouts and I see great results....love the 30 minute format as well and get a great workout!,1372723200,,173,4.612903225806452
5647144,5,B00BM9FTKY,"I'm a die hard Ellen Barrett fan and own almost all of her videos. I do an Ellen video 3-4 times a week, so I'm in fairly good shape and I could tell after doing this video that it is a bit more challenging than most of her videos, likely due to the fact that she squeezes the work out into 30 minutes instead of her usual 40-45. I appreciate that, since I generally only do 30 minutes of any of Ellen's videos due to being time crunched. With this video I feel like I'm getting a good, complete workout in 30 minutes. It features Ellen's classic big, controlled movements, done a little quicker than most of her videos, that challenge your muscles and create cardio. It doesn't contain as much variety as most of her videos, but it moves quickly and I'm happy to add it to my collection. After doing this video for the first time, I woke up the next day with some soreness in my middle back, and butt area - it's been a very long time since an Ellen video made me sore! I consider that a success!",1372118400,12,997,4.170984455958549
5647145,5,B00BM9FTKY,Great workout while stool being gentle on your joints. I love the stretches melded throughout. I highly recommend this workout series.,1371600000,,134,5.428571428571429
5647146,5,B00BM9FTKY,I have all of her exercise DVDs. I like this one because it's 30 minutes long. This is a good amount of time for me.,1371513600,,116,3.68
5647147,5,B00BM9FTKY,"A great 30 min. workout. Thanks Ellen, I loved this and sleek sculpt,you keep putting out  great workouts I love them all,keep up the good work.ready for more",1370822400,,158,4.642857142857143
5647148,5,B00BM9FTKY,"I love the fact that in 30 minutes, this workout makes you sweat as if it was any of Ellen's 45 minutes standard session. Repetitions are fine and you really feel your entire body working. 100% recommendable!",1369440000,,208,4.648648648648648
5647149,3,B00BM9FTKY,"I was happy to see that Ellen was releasing a 30 minute all cardio DVD and that it was to be more fast paced than her other workouts. The last few I bought I returned because I did not or barely broke a sweat. I can honestly say that I broke a decent sweat from this workout. However, that did not happen until the third part of the series where you put all the moves together over and over again. I was happy that I broke a sweat and my heart rate did go up. However, again this is so repetitive that the more you do this workout the more aggravating it is. I have had enough ""Happy Feet"" from Barefoot Cardio. In this workout it feels like you spend half the time doing that, whether it is by itself, or in combination before another move. I don't know if I should keep this or send it back. I bought my copy from Total Fitness DVDs for about 14.95. I'm debating whether the decent sweat for a repetitive 30 minute DVD is worth it.",1369440000,,933,4.076086956521739
5647150,2,B00BM9FTKY,"I am Italian, and in Italy by chance I came across Ellen's Fat Burning Fusion, that was offered for free through an iPad  fitness application. I got hooked and I now own all her workouts, and having done them on a regular basis for over a year I can say that they have worked wonders and definitely strengthened my quads, which is a must for me due to a long-standing knee problem. so when last week I got the two last additions to her Live series I was so thrilled I immediately tried them out, but while Sleek Sculpt Express was well up Ellen's usual (high) standards, I regret to say that Super Fast Body Blast was a total disappointment. One thing I usually like about Ellen's workouts is variety, one move flowing into the next and moving on all the time so it never gets boring. With this workout one move still does flow into the next, only the same routine gets repeated over and over, so that by the fifth repetition I had to refrain from kicking the TV in exasperation and by the seventh I had decided I'll probably never do this workout agan. And if you have a knee problem you had better stay right away from the rainbow lunge!",1369180800,43,1139,4.322429906542056
5647151,5,B00BM9FTKY,"I just got this DVD and have done it twice.  It is FUN and the time goes by so fast while I'm doing it.

I love Ellen Barrett's workouts and have several of her DVDs.  She is such a positive, upbeat, encouraging instructor. I wish I could bottle some of her enthusiasm.  It's not that saccharine, fake smiling you'll find on other workouts.  She just clearly loves what she does and it oozes out of her!

Some people don't like how Ellen repeats a lot of the same moves, but for me, it's so helpful to learn it fast and do it well.

My other Ellen favorite is Sleek Sculpt Express. I am drenched by the end of that one. This workout, like all of Ellen's, is invigorating.

I hope she does more 30 minute workouts.",1369094400,,713,4.1911764705882355
5647152,5,B00BM9FTKY,"I am new to Ellen's workouts...having mainly Denise Austin cardio/strength DVDs. But I recently bought Ellen's Grace and Gusto, Super Fast Body Blast and Slim Sculpt. I love the 1/2 hour format. I also love the fact that this is a combination of cardio/strength/stretch; I got rid of my D.A. yoga tapes because they only stretch you and you hardly burn any calories. This is perfect...burned 250 calories in 30 minutes and was dripping with sweat. I also felt stretched. As a former ballet dancer, I loved that it felt like dancing!",1368662400,2,532,4.793478260869565
5647153,4,B00BM9FTKY,"I have nearly ALL of Ellens DVDs.  I think she is the best instructor with a soothing voice and i just look forward to anything she puts out.  Unfortunately, this DVDs music is HORRID!  Maybe it is because I am used to the soothing Latin grooves in her other dvds but its so hard for me to get through 30 mins of having to hear it.  I mute it and listen to something else.  Thats the only issue I have.  Otherwise AMAZING WORKOUT!!!!! LOVE YOU ELLEN!",1368230400,,450,4.174418604651163

5647155,5,B00BM9FTKY,"This is Ellen's best Live workout yet! It's so fun & energizing! The music is peppy, Ellen is her usual cheerful self, & the moves are challenging and entertaining. I've added this one to my weekly rotation.",1368057600,,207,4.621621621621622
5647156,5,B00BM9FTKY,I would highly recommend this DVD.  It's so great to get a total workout in a half hour.  And it doesn't hurt.  Very gentle on the body.  Thank you Ellen!,1366934400,,154,4.033333333333333
5647157,5,B00BM9FTKY,"UPDATE:  1/24/14

I have been doing a lot of this dvd.  The stronger and more fit I get, the more I love it.  (Been also working out at the gym, hardcore classes, 2x a week)  Super Blast is almost perfect for a quick, intense, cardio that also stretches and lengthens.

What I love most is how my quads/IT bands are deeply stretched in Rainbow Lunge.  Brilliant.  My confidence in Ellen Barrett is very high.  She delivers on what she promises.
*************************************************************

OLD REVIEW:
I bought this workout, but I haven't been doing it. It's not challenging enough. Also, it's it bit tedious and repetitive. In addition, it's kind of hard on my knees.

I wanted to like it though.

Here is a tip if you want to get an even tougher workout: Go through the video.  Toward the end of chapter 5, start chapter 5 over then finish the video.  You will really sweat!
*****
I have been lately searching for more challenging workouts, (low impact) ones that really make me sweat, get my heart rate going strong, and that work my muscles.  My elllen favorites are Fat Burning Fusion and Slo-Robics.  Slo-Robics is not available for sale anywhere. You CAN google it and watch it online for free.

I hope this helps people who want to find challenging, low impact workouts!  Ellen is good but not all her workouts are the same, I find these older ones to be exactly what I want.",1366070400,16,1401,4.672131147540983
5647158,5,B00BM9FTKY,This is another great routine by my foavorite instructor. It is a quick 30 min low impact cardio routine that uses her signature ballet and yoga moves with an athletic feel. The music is awesome-world beats and bollywood-really cool! This is a great 30 min cardio routine that gets the job done and is fun too.,1365552000,,310,4.553571428571429
8570706,3,B00BM9FTKY,"Ellen is very sweet and if I had unlimited time to work out, then she'd be great.  But, I need a good workout in 30 minutes or less.  The pace of this video was WAY too slow for me.",1492992000,,181,3.6153846153846154

8570711,5,B00BM9FTKY,"I just watched it and haven't done the routine, but I have collected almost all of Ellen's Workout DVD's and I'm hooked!  I have been doing them for
two weeks and I'm already seeing results in my arms.  I love that you can do her workouts barefoot, she gives clear concise instruction ahead of time, so you always know when to switch so you can keep up.  The moves are fairly easy so there is no confusion like some of the dance/cardio routines out there where you are always changing up.  This isn't drippin' sweat, out of breath type of Cardio, the moves are controlled and good form and posture is always reinforced.  You should not be disappointed as long as you know what your buying from the get go.",1457913600,,705,4.392307692307693
8570712,4,B00BM9FTKY,"This is a quick and efficient workout by Ellen Barrett.  While it may not be as complex or as strenuous as her other dvds, especially the Studio series, it will work you  out and make you feel amazing afterwards. Highly recommend.",1457222400,,230,4.585365853658536
8570713,5,B00BM9FTKY,"I love Ellen Barrett. I am so glad she has 30 minutes workouts now, since that's about all the time I have. As usual she delivers.
