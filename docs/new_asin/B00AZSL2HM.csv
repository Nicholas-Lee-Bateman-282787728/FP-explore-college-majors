8559881,5,B00AZSL2HM,"IF YOU ENJOY GREAT ACTION MOVIES--GRIZZLY IS THE ALL-TIME BEST! BUY IT NOW! I first saw GRIZZLY when released in May 1976 as a 15 year old teenager and GRIZZLY quickly became my all-time number 1 favorite movie and still is and while I haven't seen the new BLU-RAY version yet, I have the 30TH ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL EDITION on DVD and still love it...I enjoy the actors. the action. the scenery. and the fact that there is no other movie like this as well paced and acted. If you love animals like I do, you will simply fall in love with Teddy--an 11 foot tall KODIAK BEAR (the only GRIZZLY born in captivity.) CHRISTOPHER GEORGE. ANDREW PRINE. RICHARD JAECKEL. JOAN McCALL. AND TEDDY ARE ALL EXCELLENT

I was a 15 year old teenager when GRIZZLY was released in May 1976 and has been my all-time number 1 favorite ever since!
The scenery is great. the actors are great. the beauty of the national park is great. the direction by director William Girdler is crisp
and great...and TEDDY the 11 foot GRIZZLY and a very beautiful animal is great. TEDDY is the only GRIZZLY ever to be born
in captivity. TEDDY is an 11 foot KODIAK BEAR! If you love action movies and animals like I do, you will simply enjoy GRIZZLY!
