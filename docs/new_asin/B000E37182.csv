8104672,5,B000E37182,"Being a student of WWII naval history, I found that the work was accurate and indeed a worthy purchase. I saw it after reading Buell's Biography and that of the Naval Institute. The modern work of the man is balanced and for the most part very interesting. I only found that the period of time during his Chief of Staff days and Post War career were not given much cover. But on the other hand his Chief of Staff days were purposely panned by the man himself (Spruance) and the time in the Philippines should have been given more attention.",1458777600,,540,4.41
8104673,4,B000E37182,"The History Channel presentation Battle Group: Spruance combines documentary still photographs and video with live-action re-creations of scenes on board Admiral Raymond A. Spruance's various flagships, including the Enterprise. Spruance was lean and fit, maintaining a regimen of regular brisk walks on the ship's deck, partly for fitness, and partly because he found it aided his thinking for naval strategy. Aides by necessity had to walk alongside. The Battle Group video doesn't have the flash of a Hollywood production, but it has authenticity in spades. I was torn between giving it four or five stars, and settled on four due to the modest production values of a story about a modest man. But don't be deceived; modesty masked one of the finest naval warfare minds in the world.

Battle Group Spruance details the career of the man who eventually led the island-hopping charge against the occupying Japanese in the Pacific during World War II. But before that campaign could begin, there was the matter of Midway to be settled.  Spruance was in overall command of the fleet at the Battle of Midway in June of 1942, a battle which Japanese Admiral Yamamoto expected would result in the United States suing for peace. Hailed as the ""turning point of the war in the Pacific"", the Battle of Midway resulted in the loss of four Japanese carriers and one American carrier, the Yorktown. The opposing ships never saw each other, with the combat being taken to the ships by carrier-launched aircraft. By the autumn of 1942, Spruance was the Deputy Chief of Pacific Naval Operations, under Admiral Nimitz.

Spruance came to the war from a position as professor at the Naval War College. Quiet, self-effacing, and thoughtful, Spruance did not court the attention of the press, and was relatively little known outside of military circles. Following the war, Spruance returned to the Naval War College, this time as its President. Naval historian Admiral Samuel Morison (author of many books including the Pulitzer Prize winning Admiral of the Ocean Sea, and The Two-Ocean War) called Spruance ""one of the greatest admirals in American Naval history."" Battle Group Spruance is a good place to become acquainted with the man known as ""the thinking man's admiral"".",1420243200,2,2258,5.080862533692723
