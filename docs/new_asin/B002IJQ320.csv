3936663,5,B002IJQ320,"Even though its out-of-stock on Amazon.com, buying it from another seller wasn't that horrible. The package arrived quickly and, even though I bought an used copy; it came in perfect condition and worked on my DVD player. The film itself is quite unique due to it being about a vampiric (demon possessed, actually) 750cc Norton Commando motorcycle killing people for blood in the UK. The special effects to me was believeable done and the blood & gore kept me going through the film. If you have a horror movie collection and looking for a new piece to add to your collection, or enjoy films like Maximum Overdrive, Christine, or Killdozer; buy this film because its a real treat.",1357344000,,680,4.771186440677966

8370998,5,B002IJQ320,"A classic of Bad Cinema. Not just bad cinema, but Bad Cinema. If you like trashy movies, classic bikes, and inexplicable scatological puppets, well buddy... this is a movie for you! The animatronics where a Norton Commando gets changed into a monster are a special treat. I know what I'm about to say here is high praise, but this cinematic masterpiece is the Birth of a Nation of Satanic motorcycle horror movies featuring a 1974 year model British motorcycle .",1420588800,3,462,4.7875
