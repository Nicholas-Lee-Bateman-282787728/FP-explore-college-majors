551684,5,6303046444,Another of universal's films that have stood the test of time...desert..wind blowing...great monsters..original..great sound effects. this movie is just pure entertainment...if you are a fan of the 50's scfi...  grab your kids and watch with them..i guarantee they will enjoy....,996364800,3,279,5.975
551685,4,6303046444,"First of all I could have sworn I saw a DVD of this film. But in andy case...
Like all of the '50's Sci-Fi movies one must put away their modern-day objections and open their minds to some silliness.  If one can't do that, all of these movies will be nothing more than kids stuff. ""Monolith Monsters"" must be viewed with the same open-mindedness.  It's a good story that allows the mystery to build before we get to the payoff: So-so special effects of ""living"" rocks that grow into ""monoliths"" of towering, tumbling rocks that threaten a desert community. One can't help to ask: ""How long have the meteor fragments been in the desert and is this the first time it ever rained to initiate this terror?"" Don't be a cynical adult when watching this film and you'll enjoy it.  It makes for a good weekend watch with your kids or by yourself and is much better than many other '50's Sci-Fi movies. On a quality scale, I put it slightly below ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" or ""Them"" but equal to ""Trantula."" For those (like me) who can't help themselves when it comes to '50's Sci-Fi, this is a film worth having.",990576000,5,1111,4.463054187192118
551686,4,6303046444,"I saw this film in its original release and thought it interesting even tho it had no ""critters"" in it.  The plot presented a scientific challenge to a group of ordinary people in an isolated community.  They must solve the mystery to save lives.  This was standard SF fare in 1957.  Viewed in comparison to today's mega-$million SciFi extravaganzas, it is refreshingly simple and nostalgic.  B&W, crude special effects, mono-dimensional people, and no sex or nudity but it has a lasting quality of being almost believeable.",982800000,3,524,5.046511627906977
551687,4,6303046444,"I think we've only seen this one about 10 or 12 times, which is why it only gets four stars.  The problem is that these monsters are just a little abstract for Benjamin (4 years old).  There's no explosions, no army guys, and face it -- unless it's raining, the most dangerous thing about a monolith monster is that it might fall on you.  The plague genre was handled much more effectively in movies like ""The Andromeda Strain",980812800,,426,4.435897435897436

Tremendous B&W sci-fi movie just from  that standpoint alone and well worth watching and discussing with the kids.",944006400,2,384,5.0
551690,5,6303046444,"...for what that's worth. Like the last reviewer, I saw it at a very early age. Thirty years later (channel flipping at 1 am), I recognized it instantly--from nothing more than the opening scene of a car moving down a  desert highway. It must be a very special movie that something like that  should happen--twice, judging from saxsdad's review. And forget the  allegory-for-the-communist-threat hypothesis: that's a (thankfully  discredited) analysis of 50's sci-fi that began in the paraniod imaginings  of professors paid on the side by the column inch. Nevertheless, Monolith  Monsters abounds in rich Freudian imagery (this last to film students  hard-up for a paper topic). And it has all the elements of classic  Hollywood 50's sci-fi: it takes place in the DESERT, there are Scientifical  Experiments and Explanations, it has Alien Monsters, and High-Technology  (albeit an iron lung)--all except radiation (being the California desert,  not NM). The B/W photography rounds out Monolith Monster's bona fides. Get  it while you still can. Whenever you have an apartment that needs cleaning,  dishes that need washing, or a paper due in the morning, you'll never tire  of watching this instead.",939340800,10,1200,5.3138297872340425

551789,4,6303046444,"While my friends, who were born in the 80s, made fun of this movie and claimed that it needed the MST3K crew in the foreground, I still like it.  It is one of the more creative and well-made of the 50s monster movies.  While not up to the standards of Them, Forbidden Planet or War of the Worlds, the monsters are among the most unique you will find in film.  Well worth the money for fans of old-school monster movies.",1261180800,,419,4.2125
551790,4,6303046444,"There are only a precious few Grade B horror films of the 50s that still resonate with those who saw them then and can feel even now the creepy sensations of tumbling rocks.  THE MONOLITH MONSTERS is an effective thrilller that director Jack Sherwood can justly be proud of.  The plot is a staple of the genre. A meteor falls to earth and it causes terror and destruction in its wake.  But in this case, the terror and destruction build slowly from the opening scene.  The first half of the movie is a series of vignettes, each pointing the audience to accept the reality of small rocks growing monstrously huge when exposed to water.  Any living creature that comes into contact with them has the silicon drained from its body with the result that what had once been a normal living entity is morphed into a crusty ossified corpse.  Grant Williams (of THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN fame) and perennial 50s beauty Lola Albright are the romantic leads and their interaction blends seamlessly.  They are right there to witness the gradual evolution of a menace that begins with just one rock but soon enough changes to a crushing crawling wall of towering rocks that seems invincible.  Part of what makes this film work is the realization that earth is threatened not by a thinking Big Bug From Up There but by the natural process of life and growth of the monoliths.  By the second half, the monoliths are seen for what they are--a serious threat to all life on earth.  The ticking time bomb of a plot demands that humanity find a way to stop their relentless onslaught or face extinction.

Even after repeated viewings, one can appreciate how effective is the melding of acting, scripting, pacing, and FX.  At first the monoliths are presented as no more than a bunch of shiny rocks, sort of like obsidian.  Director Sherwood slowly causes us to view them in an evolving light--from a bare recognition of their existence to a wonder at their growth and finally to a weird terror at being pulverised by their progress.  We not only SEE them grow and spread but we HEAR them crash, thus intensifying the creepy terror.  THE MONOLITH MONSTERS is one of the jewels of that decade or of any other.  Finally, sharp eyed viewers will note the presence of uncredited appearances of William Schallert (DOBIE GILLIS), Paul Peterson (DONNA REED), and Troy Donahue.",1248220800,,2352,4.713936430317848

I do not like giving plot details in my reviews but, this one does have an intriguing premise that is well executed. Good special effect and I'm sure that is an unbilled Paul Peterson from 'The Donna Reed Show' as the boy with the bike. The transfer is excellent on the ultimate sci-fi classic collection volume one.

551795,5,6303046444,"Enough with the ""science"" of the Monolith Monsters!! Who cares if it's goofy science, bad geology or whatever (like ""The Day After Tomorrow"" or ""Deep Impact"" is any more realistic)! This is a great movie, with decent special effects and a truly fun story. This movie is a great way to spend a rainy Saturday afternoon. Like the best of the 50's sci-fi, you have a really original story where rocks are threatening to destory the surface of the Earth, you have a great musical score that really drives the action, top notch acting also raises ""Monolith Monsters"" above the usual B-Movie schlock. I loved when the VHS tape came out and featured the original theatrical trailer at the beginning. It seems Universal gave quite a few of their 50's sci-fi/horror films a decent treatment in the mid 90's with these releases. Films like ""Monolith Monsters"", ""The Night Walker"", ""Tarantula"", ""The Deadly Mantis"", etc. never looked better than with these restored versions, and the movie trailers were a great addition. So Universal....where are the DVD versions? It's obvious some care and attention were given to these films with their last VHS release, so why not just pump them out on DVD? As a fan of the genre I would be willing to plunk down the money to get the latest and greatest versions of these films. Or better yet give us box set similar to what was done with the ""Frankenstein"" & ""Wolfman"" movies.",1139184000,13,1404,4.758196721311475
551796,4,6303046444,"My 12-year son and I first saw ""Monolith Monsters"" with 15 other geologists as evening entertainment in a makeshift trailer-theater at the University of California's White Mountain Research Station in Bishop, California. We watched the movie in utter amusement as characters Dave Miller (government geologist), Professor Arthur Flanders and others in the cast spouted one nonsensical aphorism after another, in their attempt to explain the formation of the monoliths and the possible ways of stopping their growth. The movie is one of the best examples of ""Bad Geology"" that I had seen. Even my son pointed out the movie's finer statements: 1) looking at a piece of Obsidian (a black glassy rock) that every school kid recognizes, Dave Miller says ""Looks like stone to me"" - duh; 2) theorizing that water makes the rocks grow, the townsfolks decide to flood the monoliths with salt and water. But Obsidian (silicon dioxide) is inert to both salt and water!

Without getting into other specifics of the movie's bad geology, it is clear any halfway intelligent middle school student would have identified the rock. And yet despite some of the funky statements, ""Monolith Monsters"" remains a wholly enjoyable `B' movie. It is `Camp' entertainment for scientists, especially geologists, and is a period piece of Bad Geology - a good movie to watch with colleagues over a beer while making childish insidious remarks. This is high entertainment. If you like the TV program  ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"", you'll love this movie.",1129680000,,1524,5.165991902834008
551797,5,6303046444,"I won't reiterate the plot; most of the other reviews provide a nice summary.  I saw the movie as part of a Saturday matinee double feature when I was about nine, and was expecting a standard stunt-man-in-a-bad-rubber-suit jump-out-and-say-boo ""horror"" flick, like its companion on the double bill that day (which was ""Night of the Blood Beast,"" forsooth -- featuring a stunt man in a bad rubber suit).

Instead, I was enthralled by a thoughtful, suspenseful, problem-solving tale of research, hypothesis, and creative solutions to the problem of a mindless, purposeless natural force -- it was great, and made the ""sci fi"" horror films of the day seem juvenile and trite, even to a nine year old.  I loved it, and began reading good science fiction (like Heinlein, Clarke, and Asimov) as a result.

Though not up to the production standards of ""Forbidden Planet"" it holds its own.  The science is fairly silly (as if recent movies like ""The Core"" have even a faint resemblence to plausibility), but it is far above the standard 1950s ""let's see if we can make the audience jump"" genre.  It's actually a thoughtful film, and hugely enjoyable to this day.",1128297600,5,1154,4.892307692307693
551885,4,6303046444,"The Monolith Monsters is one of the better sci-fi flicks of the 1950s, certainly better than it's own title.  It has an imaginative idea, a relatively intelligent script, for a sci-fi film, decent acting, and excellent special effects for the 1950s, though not in color.  There are no monsters, just crystal meteorites that grow tall as skyscrapers then crash down and shatter into hundreds of pieces each of which grow again, repeating the process, multiplying and spreading.  Meanwhile, human contact with the metorites causes the humans to slowly turn into rocks, due to absorption of their silicon.  A geologist (Grant Williams, who also starred in The Incredible Shrinking Man) discovers plain water makes the rocks grow, just as it begins raining.  He has to find out what will make them stop before they crash down on his home town, and before a little student of his fiancee, the school teacher, turns to stone.  Suspense is maintained evenly, realism added by fine character actors like Les Tremayne (War of the Worlds, Angry Red Planet) as the editor of the town newspaper.

It's difficult to rate this film without considering what kind of films you're comparing it to.  Compare it to other sf films of the 1950s, and if you divide those films into serious ones (The Day The Earth Stood Still, George Pal films, Forbidden Planet, Curt Siodmak films) and those whose main value is they're so corny they're funny (Ed Wood films, Cat Women of the Moon, etc.), Monolith Monsters fits at the lower end of the first category, about as good as Them or It Came From Outer Space.  If Forbidden Planet is a 10 and Plan 9 From Outer Space 1, I'd give this a 7.  Since I love sci-fi films I'd rate them all a little higher and give it 8 or 9, so I'm giving it 4 of 5 stars here.  You might disagree if you find the idea of growing rocks a little silly.",1125014400,4,1851,4.595744680851064
551886,5,6303046444,"So imagine you are in another country with only two or three English language channels on and they put this on.  You watch it because you have no choice, but somewhere in the middle you start to be interested in the plot.  When it is over, you go to work and say ""You know, I saw this movie last night that wasn't that bad.""

I think that is how I would describe most people's view of Monolith Monsters.  It's a fun little film that is definitely a good representation of 1950s science fiction.  If that is a genre you are interested, or if you just like old movies, you won't be sad after seeing this one.",1105315200,5,606,4.189655172413793

551888,4,6303046444,"This was the second monster movie I ever saw (right after Them!).  Not I have it in my collection and it is better than I remembered.
A small mining town is in danger when a mysterious meteorite falls in the nearby mountains.  Black rocks, unexplained deaths and destruction soon follow.  Soon the truth is learned as it is discovered that the meteorite is a deadly menace.  When the stone comes in contact with water is absorbs the silicates in the area and grows into a Column.  Once tall enough, the column topples and shatters creating new pieces to grow and shatter.
Just as the menace is discovered the region experiences a torrential downpour.  Gigantic columns of rock begin to tumble down a mountain pass towards the town.  An evacuation is put into effect while a method of stopping the crushing rocks is searched for.  People who come in contact with the rocks are paralyzed as their silicates are removed.  A cure used on a small girl with a paralyzed arm leads to the breakthrough in stopping the monoliths.  The only way to stop them before they destroy the town is to blow up the local dam so that it washes salt from the salt mine into the path of the approaching towers.
Although the idea of falling rocks used as monsters seems a bit lame, the movie works (if you ignore the science and biology).  Better acting than is found in most monster movies contributes to the films success along with excellent special effects and genuine suspense.  The Monolith Monsters should be added to the collection of any monster movie fan.",1088380800,8,1541,4.645756457564576
551889,4,6303046444,"In science fiction films the threat of meteors serves as a plot premise in one of two ways.  First, there are the meteors (or asteroids or comets or rouge planets) big enough that when they collide with the earth it is going to literally be the end of the world.  Contemporary audiences will be thinking ""Deep Impact"" and ""Armageddon,"" while those who are older or have a sense of cinematic history will be thinking of ""Meteor"" and other films all the way back to ""When Worlds Collide"" (which always makes me think of George Pal and his bride).  Second, there are the meteors that crash and bring with them a strange visitor from another planet, which can be anything from a dangerous microscopic organism as we found in ""The Andromeda Strain"" or a growing monstrous glob that threatens to devour everyone at the local movie palace as in ""The Blob.""  But in the 1957 film ""The Monolith Monsters"" the writers (Jack Arnold and Robert M. Fresco with the story, Fresco and Norman Jolley with the script) come up with something a little bit different.  This time the meteor essentially IS the monster.
The opening for ""The Monolith Monsters"" is fairly traditional for a Fifties sci fi flick.  Paul Frees does an initial voice over and then the meteorite crashes near a small California town.  Ben Gilbert (Phil Harvey) just happens to have his car overheat near the impact point and since he happens to be a geologist for the Department of the Interior he checks out the meteorite.  What he finds are these pieces of rock that look sort of glassy, like obsidian (they do look good), but he does not notice that a piece of rock that had water spilled on it is smoking.  This cannot be good and we would know this even if the music did not provide an ominous clue.  That night the wind knocks over a convenient beaker of water that falls on Ben's samples and the rock begins to grow into (you guessed it) a monster monolith.
When fellow geologist Dave Miller (Grant Williams, a.k.a. ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"") shows up the next day to the office he finds that Ben (cue the music) has been turned to stone.  Plus there are all these broken pieces of black rock all over the place.  Later that day Dave's girl friend, Cathy Barrett (Lola Albright) takes her class of school children on a field trip to the desert, where young Ginny Simpson (Linda Scheley) finds one of those cool looking pieces of black rock.  She takes it home with her but her mother, who has not been watching the movie, insists Ginny wash off that dirty rock before she brings it into the house.  By the time Dave starts to piece things together and shows up at the Simpson house, Ginny's parents are turned to stone and so is her arm.  What can this all possibly mean?
This is the point in ""The Monolith Monsters"" where Dave turns to his mentor, Professor Arthur Flanders (Trevor Bardette), who shows up and starts connecting the dots by providing a lot of necessary exposition.  The interesting idea here is that these rocks leach all of the silicone out of anything that touch, whether it is the dessert sand or Ginny's arm (I did not know that silicon was a big part of our arms, but then I never did take biology so what do I know?  However, that iron lung doing what it does makes no sense at all).  But the monster in this film is rather unique and for once there is not a lot of time wasted getting everybody to do the right thing; the closest thing to a villain in the film is veteran character actor William Schallert who plays a weatherman whose true level of expertise is about what you would expect from a 1950s weatherman.
Dave is a rather classic science fiction B-movie hero and there is something to be said for the film's simple solution to the menace of the monoliths (it is a simple household item found on most dinning room tables).  For that matter the monoliths, which grow into this giant obelisks that then splinter and topple forward (decent special effects for the time), ready to repeat the process during the next thunderstorm, are pretty interesting just because they are so decidedly different; in other words, they are truly alien.  You also have to like the brisk pace of this story, which director John Sherwood (""The Creature Walks Among Us"") brings in at 77 minutes.  Not a great film this remains a solid B-movie from the period that offers more than its share of originality with the ideas if not the execution.",1079568000,4,4416,4.557522123893805

551891,4,6303046444,"Meteor fragments from deep space grow gigantic and mobile after contact with plain water. What is worse, they absorb the silica out of human flesh and turn people into stone. (Silicon Valley nothwithstanding, I had to look up ""silica,"" too). This nifty-'50s sci-fi flick is unique because the ""monster"" is a bunch of rocks. Not giant bugs or radioactive dinosaurs, mind you, but rocks with an attitude of deadly intention. Giant rocks that crush buildings and steadily move down the canyon toward the helpless desert town. The authorities run around with more than the usual B movie incredulity because they can't fathom what space-age menace is on the loose now. Our favorite scene is after Grant Williams figures out that water gives the rocks mysterious power, it starts raining heavily in an arid area that probably hadn't seen more than a passing shower for months. The script includes the obligatory mysterious deaths and enough suspense to keep classic sci-fi/horror fans amused. Sighful-eyeful, Lola Albright lends her considerable talents to the story. Sadly, her role as a ""Miss Landers""-type schoolteacher means she dresses modestly, and there is no cleavage or cheesecake.

551893,5,6303046444,"Although this movie was made in 1957, in my opinion it has the most well thought out plot from a scientific viewpoint of any movie that has been produced before or since!  The actor that played the geologist was excellent - he played the role with great intensity at all the appropriate points in the film.  I felt that the special effects were just excellent(even by todays standards). Even after all these years, I still get goosebumps when I watch this movie.  The concept of these crystals growing to colossal heights & propagating across the country with the simple addition of water (which allowed them to draw silica from the earth) was mind boggling. This movie has never been given the credit it so richly deserves.  It certainly would be wonderful if audiences could again be treated to a science fiction movie such as this with such well thought out concepts.
This movie would be a prime choice for a remake if it remained true to the original story line & just updated the technology, special effects & sound(which would be truly awesome with THX).",1026345600,3,1060,4.713513513513513

The strength of this movie lies in the fact that its such an original story. Despite the title,there are no ""monsters"" in this movie. The threat comes in the form of a meteor that crashes to earth and when exposed to water grows to gigantic proportions only to come crashing back down to the earth where it breaks into pieces and the process is repeated over and over again...
To tell you more would ruin the film for you because a major portion of the movie is dedicated to discovering the secrets of the meteor and finding a way to stop its slow advance towards the town of San Angelo.
One problem I had with the film was that no one was ever in any immediate danger from the falling rocks. A scene with one of the main characters speeding down the highway while the monoliths are crashing down around him would have done a lot to boost the excitement level.
All told,this is a decent little flick. The spfx are good if not great and the cast is pretty solid. I thought it had a bit more potential than what made it to the screen but I definetly enjoyed it more the second time I watched it.

7836479,4,6303046444,"John Sherwood's The Monolith Monsters (1957) is by far one of my favorite  B sci-fi (ish) monster movies!  I'm being very generous with rating but, this is a hilariously average (but wonderful) romp with one of the more peculiar ""monsters"" matched up with some of the best 50s special effects I've seen.  The Monolith Monsters is without doubt one of the more interesting films of the 1950s American Realist Science Fiction movement and B sci-fi in general (I'm not counting films that transcend their B movie status and enter the ranks of the greats -- The Monolith Monsters has no pretensions of being anything more than a B movie and unabashedly isn't).

The most arresting quality of the film (besides the special effects) is John Sherwood's creation of a small town ethos with a kaleidoscopic group of characters instead of concentrating solely on the two leads.  The plethora of secondary characters with substantial screen time include the local newspaper writer, a geology professor, the local police chief, the local doctor, a doctor from the city, etc.  Sherwood manages to enhance the isolation of the town and its resulting close-knit ethos with a bleak and isolated setting -- a town at the dusty rock strewn edge of the California desert.

I was also surprised by the female lead, Cathy (Lola Albright) -- the male geologists value her input and ask her to help with the experiments although she's not a scientist but rather the local school teacher.  All in all there's nothing egregious about the film's gender dynamics -- something which often plagues films of this period and beyond.

Brief Plot Summary (limited spoilers)

The film begins, in pseudo-documentary mode, with a brief voiceover introduction (with accompanying stock footage -- of course!) on meteors.

The premise is simple: a meteor from some unknown distant part of the galaxy crashes into many small pieces near a dusty California town.  The meteor, unactivated by water, is benign.  Various towns people pick up the interesting rock (which looks like obsidian) and bring it to their homes.  However, a particularly large chunk is accidentally activated by contact with water and kills a geologist.  This meteor has the ability to turn people completely rigid by sucking out all the silicon from their victims' skin.

One of Cathy's school children on an excursion into the country picks up a large chunk and brings it home.  Later that evening the rock is activated by water since she dropped it in a bucket and destroys her entire house (the meteor grows exponentially in the presence of water) and kills her parents.  The little girl's hand has its silicon sucked out!  She's sent to a city doctor who comes up with a cure.  It's up to the local geologist Dave (Grant Williams fresh off the success of The Shrinking Man) and his one time professor to apply the principles of this medical cure to defeating the meteor which is cascading down the valleys destroying everything in its path (the picture below)

Final Thoughts

The images of the meteors growing, cracking, growing again, rumbling down the valley destroying buildings are absolutely spectacular!  I was shocked at the quality of these 50s effects (even if the premise sounds hokey watch it for the last third)! The film is also blessed with a surprisingly solid plot that doesn't falter (although the ending is painfully abrupt).

All in all this is a must watch for anyone who loves B sci-fi or popular 50s entertainment!  The small town ethos, the relatively ok acting, the special effects, and straightforward well paced plot make this an endearing little gem.",1302048000,,3613,4.961794019933555
7836480,3,6303046444,"Released by Universal in 1957, THE MONOLITH MONSTERS is unexpectedly plausible--well, at least in comparison with atomic ants, critters from outer space, and the usual spate of hokey costumes that characterized B-level sci-fi and horror movies of the era.  The story created by Norman Jolley and Robert M. Fresco is quite clever.  A meteorite strikes the earth and its chemical composition is such that water causes its fragments to grown into, yes, monster monoliths.  These eventually collapse under their own weight, and the resulting fragments begin the process all over again, each fragment growing into a monolith.

The cast is not greatly memorable.  Grant Williams had a solid but minor career, appearing in such semi-classics as WRITTEN ON THE WIND and THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN; leading lady Lola Albright would eventually be best known for the cult film LORD LOVE A DUCK and her numerous television appearances.  Even so, the single most noticeable performer in the film is William Schallert, uncredited in the tiny role of a weatherman, who went on to an extremely worthy character-actor career in film, television, and on the stage.

The screenplay doesn't do much to improve on the original idea, but it is serviceable, and director John Sherwood--who worked primarily as an assistant director than as a director in his own right--sets a good pace but doesn't add much in the way of dynamics.  The special effects aren't bad, especially for this period, but it is very obvious that they are done as minatures.  Still, the whole thing is a lot of fun, clever without being excessive, enjoyable without being in the least bit thought provoking.  Recommended for fans of the genre.

7836481,5,6303046444,"I remembered this movie as a kid and always liked it. I hadn't seen the movie for at least 30 years, but when I finaly figured out the title I quickly grabbed this movie.
  I was not disapointed.

This is not a gripping terror yarn, or a silly monster movie ( as a kid I thought the title doesn't fit and I still don't really think it does. Maybe Megalith or monolith ""danger""...""monster"" implies a scary creature)

  I realized after watching this that this was a very carefully scripted, well plotted movie. No loose ends, none of the ""...Oh they did a boner there"", or ""they screwed up there"", or ""that's pretty lame""...none of that. Nothing was contrived and  the science they did, made sence, the origin made sence,the danger and menace made sence, the cure for the problem it caused in Humans made sence and the way the mennace was dealt with was plausible and credible. (though they didn't explain how the agent that stopped it worked, it did make ""chemestry"" sence.)

 I have to say that of all the science fiction movies I've seen this is probably the most credible, logical, plausible one I've ever seen, and even the special effects of the growing rocks was pretty well done. (probably nothing by todays standards, but for the time, the effects were very good)

 Considering this is a 1957 movie, and apparently a ""B"" movie at that, this is a very well crafted story, and sci-fi writers could learn a lesson or two. If your looking for a scream fest, this is not your movie, but if you don't want your intelligence insulted, this one is for you.",1290643200,,1556,4.541218637992832
