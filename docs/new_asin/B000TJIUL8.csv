8315605,1,B000TJIUL8,"It did not work in my dvd player or my Xbox, I was very disappointed because I love fist of the North star.",1465862400,,107,3.6956521739130435
8315606,4,B000TJIUL8,no english subs however if you follow the series it's easy to follow with a little knowlage of familiar words they use often enough.  However the story is very laid back and drama more then action packed like everything else.  The animation is great but after 25 years they kill off Roa in this.  You don't really see him die it's almost the same as the fist of the north star movie but there were only like 3 fight scenes.  But it came with so much stuff and all together it's more of a collector item then anything else.,1396051200,2,522,4.242424242424242
