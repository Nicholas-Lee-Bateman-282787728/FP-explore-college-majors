8217185,5,B0000ACNQD,"I bought this video about 12 years ago and I've shown it to many religion classes I've taught at home as well as
in my present classes in Catholic school.  Every student that has seen this video absolutely loves it!!  It is such a wonderful interpretation of faith and courage that was very well performed.  To this day it still brings tears to my eyes at the end of the video.....that's the kind of impact it had on me as an adult.  Very highly recommended for all religion classes and the perfect video for all age groups for the Easter season.  Happy Easter!!",1205798400,,562,4.41747572815534
