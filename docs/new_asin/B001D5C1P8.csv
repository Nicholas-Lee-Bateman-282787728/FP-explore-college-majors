This DVD is 1950's stuff very tame by todays standards and I was aware of that. The headliner was Virginia Bell vintage of 1958 or so, she was the reason I bought the DVD. The Virginia Bell loop was a clothed bed roll, not even a glimpse of her fantastic tits. As for the 2DVDs, soft R rating and more soft R (pum intended). If you want to see how tame girlie loops can get then buy this. There are better loops out there of Virginia Bell on [...] for free.",1296604800,10,601,4.016666666666667
