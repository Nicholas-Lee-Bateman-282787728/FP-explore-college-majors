This parenting thing never ends :)  Anyway, he asked me to order it, as he planned on using the Dr. Seuss DVD as part of his lesson plan.  He has done this and said the kids LOVED it.  They were engaged, entertained and learning.  Who knew Seuss was not just for the toddlers?",1326240000,,379,4.136986301369863
8066191,5,B0009S5KMQ,"No matter your need- entertainment, Dr. Seuss Fandom, or education, this is a great resource! I purchased this to use in my middle school history class to teach about the politics of the time. When it arrived I put it on my laptop in the kitchen to pre-view while making dinner. It attracted my whole family to watch!",1305936000,,317,4.482758620689655
8066192,5,B0009S5KMQ,"This documentary is a treat for Dr. Seuss's adult fans. In 2004, it was aired on U. S. public television as part of the PBS Independent Lens series. It is a fairly comprehensive treatment of Theodor Geisel's (Dr. Seuss's) life, which is presented essentially in chronological order; it is not exclusively concerned with Geisel's politics. The documentary completes Geisel's story for those of us who are mostly familiar with the Dr. Seuss books for children. It is engaging to watch, and within its 84 minutes it manages to celebrate Seuss's creations and to illuminate Geisel's motivations, his development, and his working style.",1230940800,,631,5.196078431372549
