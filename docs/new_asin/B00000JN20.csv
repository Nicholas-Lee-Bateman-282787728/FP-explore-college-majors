1234705,3,B00000JN20,"If you want to see what a sick movie was like in 1941, then this is for you. Supposedly watered down from the stage play, ""Shanghai Gesture"" is a mess. A spoiled rich girl, Poppy (get it?) becomes enamored of a hustler (Victor Mature) working in a notorious Den of Sin run by the notorious Madame Gin Sling (Ona Munson from ""GWTW""). It's a gambling set up that offers more if you're interested. Poppy becomes addicted to gambling and opium in a bizarre plot by Gin Sling to humiliate the girl's father (Walter Huston) who she had once been involved with and who left her when she became pregnant. Now China's most infamous underworld figure, she's out to even the score. Trashy and ridiculous, it takes a lot to sit through this hokum. Gin Sling's hair styles are a sight to see. Mean, unsympathetic characters populate this Von Sternberg directed morality tale but the overall effect is ""yawn"". A lot of hinted at depravity includes white slavery where girls are held in baskets that are suspended over throngs of reaching and grabbing men. See this out of curiosity if you must---it sounds more interesting than it really is---but be aware the DVD transfer is poor. Gene Tierney (Poppy) went on to do better films than this like ""Laura"" and ""Leave Her to Heaven"" proving that her talent and beauty could shine in better material.",1036022400,5,1331,4.6923076923076925
1234706,4,B00000JN20,"After the critical and box-office disaster of the beautiful and sardonic ""The Devil is a Woman"", Josef Von Sternberg had his artistic freedom taken away by the studio and was forced to direct works that were  unsuitable to his tastes. He eventually could not even get work in Hollywood  and he remains another sad example of genius wasted. He did however manage  to work on one project that was worthy of his talent:""The Shanghai  Gesture"".""The Shanghai Gesture""was an anomaly when it was  released in the 1940's. Directed in Von Sternberg's exquisite baroque  style,it depicted the decadent  goings-ons of characters engaged in  vice,drugs and revenge set in a gambling den. At that time pre-war Hollywood  films were firmly entrenched in  the genteel and ""The Shanghai  Gesture"" was considered too daring to be made. Indeed the film could  only be made with heavy censorship and this constitutes the film's most  serious flaw-some of the plot becomes incoherent due to the forced  obscuring of some of the character's motivation. But the film is still  remarkable for how perverse it is ,considering the time period,and its  subtle yet unmistakeable methods of portraying  depravity. Unfortunately,""The Shanghai Gesture"" met the same fate  as ""The Devil is a Woman"" and not until it was rediscovered by  the French was it appreciated as the masterpiece that it is. The only thing  to be added is of the technical-its camerawork and photography are  outstanding and it contains a very entertaining and large cast of whom  three deserve mention. Victor Mature,very amusing as the sly and mysterious  Dr. Omar;Gene Tierney,so breathtakingly gorgeous as the eager to be  corrupted Poppy,and best of all -Ona Munson giving the performance of her  career as Mother Gin Sling -a Machiavellian revenger whose serpentine  coiffure and mocking nonchalance conceal a heart consumed by pain.""The  Shanghai Gesture"" is Josef Von Sternberg's last memorable Hollywood  film and though not as well known as the great Marlene Dietrich  collaborations certainly merits to be ranked with them.",949449600,47,2076,5.2439024390243905

1234726,2,B00000JN20,"A youthful radiant Gene Tierney was wasted in this early forties ""film noir"" tale of ""Babylon"" Shanghai. According to a ""Preface"" on this DVD, ""Shanghai Gesture"" had many problems with the censors of its day and was apparently re-edited more than once. It shows!  What we have is a story that revolves around a gambling casino in early 20th century Shanghai populated by a cosmospolitan collection of every level of humanity. The casino is run by ""Mother"" Gin-Sling played by Ona Munson (a non-Chinese actress playing one) who chews up the scenery and everyone in it with great delight and relish.  In her employ is Victor Mature playing the part of an Arab doctor - yes, your eyes are not deceiving you.  Enter Gene Tierney as a spoiled little rich girl who is addicted to gambling for its own sake. VM is all over her; GT is all over him.  They have about as much chemistry as a duck stuck in an oil spill. VM's constant mugging is unbearable. (Interestingly, the two appear together again in the 1954 movie ""The Egyptian"".  GT plays an Egyptian princess who can't stand VM, an aspiring class climber. Her reaction there appears to be quite believable.)  Be that as it may, it turns out that the powers that be intend to close down Gin-Sling's establishment.  She plans to take revenge on the political official responsible for this threat (well played by Walter Huston) and makes good on her promise. However, (SPOILER ALERT!) everything backfires in a most unexpected way and chaos is the end result.

The movie suffers from extremely poor editing, jumps around from scene to scene as if something was left out or filmed so much out of sequence that it couldn't be conjoined properly. It also makes little sense after all is said and done.  If nothing else, the movie highlights the debauchery, arrogance, pomposity, class differential, and self-indulgence of the upper crust Europeans who temporarily dared to claim Shanghai (and so much of China at that time) as their own. Aside from the performance of Ona Munson, the appearance of the 19 or 20 year old Gene Tierney was at least partial compensation for enduring this DVD.",1424390400,,2131,4.784741144414169

1234728,5,B00000JN20,"Early in this movie, the Chorus Girl asks Doctor Omar ""When do we eat?""
Doctor Omar:  I'll have the cook send up a brace of thousand-year-old eggs.  Do you like them soft?
(obscenely stagy eye-roll)
Or scrambled?
(stagy exit through low door)

Other reviewers have pointed out, astutely, how 'pre-code' this movie seems, even though it was released in 1941.  In fact, in its relentless doubling down on corny dialogue with stagy, vaudevillian eye-rolling and shoulder shrugs, it seems a throwback to an even earlier era.  ""You want comic relief?,"" Von Sternberg asks.  ""I give it.  I give it 'til you CRY.""

What can I say?  It works.  SHANGHAI GESTURE is as ridiculous as SHANGHAI EXPRESS is sublime, and yet it is spell-binding.  Gene Tierney is gorgeous as Poppy, but the unsung Phyllis Brooks (as the Chorus Girl) makes a nice Elvgren to her Vargas.  Walter Huston, as Sir Guy Charteris, may not seem British at all, but is superb as an elder executive.  Veteran Swiss actor Albert Bassermann also shines as the urbane Commissioner.

1234737,4,B00000JN20,"""The Shanghai Gesture"" is a 1941 film noir set in Shanghai. It tells the story of a young woman's (Gene Tierney) descent into decadence and beyond. The film was based on a 1926 play about life in a brothel.

Beautiful Gene Tierney (1920-91) was nominated for an Oscar for ""Leave Her to Heaven"" (1944) and appeared in more than 40 films, the most notable of which were ""Tobacco Road"" (1941), ""Laura"" (1944), ""Razor's Edge"" (1946), and ""The Left Hand of God"" (1955). She was known for her escapades with famous personalities like Tyrone Power, Ally Kahn, and JFK.

Victor Mature (1913-99) made his film debut in 1940 in ""One Million BC"". This was his 6th film and quite a departure from his usual role - he plays a charming, educated, seducer of young women. He's not particularly convincing, and his work here isn't as good as he could be -  ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946), ""Kiss of Death"" (1947), ""The Robe"" (1953) - yet it's interesting to see him in this manner.

Ona Munson (1903-1955) plays a decadent Chinese woman who runs a gambler casino. She's best known as Belle Watling (Clark Gable's prostitute friend in ""GWTW""). She is stunning and steals every scene she appears in.

Walter Huston (1883-1950) plays a rich man with several secrets which come back to haunt him. Huston was churning out films at breakneck speed in the 30s, then got better as he got older, and he was nominated for an Oscar in 1937 (""Dodsworth""), 1942 (""Devil and Daniel Webster"") and 1943 (""Yankee Doodle Dandy"") and won in 1949 for ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"". He died in 1950.

Russia born Maria Ouspenskaya (1876-1949) worked with Huston on ""Dodsworth"" (1936) for which she was nominated for an Oscar for ""Dodsworth"" (1936) and again for ""Love Affair"" (1939). She is best known as the Gypsy woman in ""The Wolfman"" (1941) and ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman"" (1943). Unfortunately in this film she merely stand there for 15 minutes and never says a word.

""Iron"" Mike Mazurki (1907-90) plays a richshaw driver. Big Mike was a professional wrestler, 6'5"" tall, and played the heavy in dozens of films and TV programs., notable as Splitface in ""Dick Tracy"" (1945), ""Big Tree"" Collins in ""Dakota"" (1945), and the Philistine in ""Samson and Delilah"" (1949).

Josef von Sternberg (1894-1969) wrote and directs. Born in Vienna, he grew up in New York and moved to Germany in 1929. He was nominated twice for an Oscar - ""Morocco"" (1930) and ""Shanghai Express"" (1931). His credo was ""To know what to reveal and what to conceal and in what degree to do this is all there is to art."" He claimed ""I care nothing about the story, only how it is photographed."" You can see this philosophy in the film - many of the scenes have photographic beauty but don't necessarily advance the plot or serve the story.

1941 was a terrific year for films - ""Citizen Kane"", ""The Maltese Falcon"", Sergeant York"", ""How Green Was My Valley"", Meet John Doe"", ""Buck Privates"", ""They Died with Their Boots On"", ""The Sea Wolf"" ""High Sierra"", ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", and ""A Yank in the RAF"".

The NY Times called it ""utterly and lavishly pretentious, so persistently opaque and so very badly acted in every leading role but one that its single redeeming feature is that it finally becomes laughable.""

Bottom line - beautifully photographed and atmospheric early film noir.",1339545600,4,3326,4.7669565217391305
1234738,3,B00000JN20,"You must really be enthralled with Gene Tierney to add this to your collection.  It is a dark, foggy print with acceptable audio.  Had it been filmed with multiple studio lighting techniques, and interesting camera angles, it would almost qualify as film noir.  This is early Gene Tierney, and as beautiful as she is, this is not the glowing Gene Tierney we all love.  I won't divulge any plot or sub-plots here.  This is a character study, of very seedy and sordid people involved in the gambling and politics of old Shangai.  This movie has an extremely decadent quality especially considering it was released in 1941.  It feels more like those pre-code early 1930,s B-movies. Victor Mature co-stars and is fine in his role. Ona Munson, who portrays Mother Gin Sling, is the personification of decadent evil.  Walter Huston as Gene Tierney's father believes he is above Mother Gin Sling's grasp and control in this depraved world.  The story feels cheap and dirty.  As viewers, we are offered a voyeristic glimpse into a sordid underworld. It is there that Gene Tierney is lured and corrupted. Here quick spiral into the grasp of Mother Gin Sling is dark and complete.  The film has suggestions of illicit sex, gambling addiction, and alcohol (drugs?) abuse.  To watch lovely Gene Tierney succomb to these vices is one of the marvels of the film.  To see the ramifications of her fall as well as the evil that eddies through every scene is disturbing to say the least. For a film released in 1941, there seem to be no redeeming values here.  Shangai Gesture is considered to be the last great film by director Josef von Sternberg ( The Blue Angel, Blonde Venus ). He also wrote the screenplay.  It is hard to believe this is one of the films that introduced Gene Tierney to the world of film, it almost anti-Hollywood.",1335484800,2,1820,4.715189873417722
1234739,1,B00000JN20,"I ordered this movie expecting a suspenseful, classic film noir.  What I saw instead was a confusing, meandering, pointless story with a ""surprise ending"" that was hardly any surprise.  Multiple themes run contiguously throughout the film, but none are fully explored or clearly explained, and there is no closure or conclusion to most of the threads.  Much of the action occurs in close to real time; there are no flashbacks, so we must depend on the character's occasional droning to carry us through each scene.  Unfortunately, there are numerous ""missing scenes"" that force the viewer to decide what happened in the interim.  Despite a fine international cast, there is virtually no emotion or feeling to them.  Describing the acting as wooden is an unfair indictment of trees.  Even the prototypical dragon-lady looks bored out of her mind, or maybe she just came out of a Botox session.  A somewhat youthful Victor Mature must have found his role particularly ludicrous, for in one kissing scene he dramatically imitates, or mocks, Rudolph Valentino's Sheik, or maybe it was Bela Lugosi's Dracula.  You decide.  It's enough to make you laugh - or cringe.  It was as though a bad radio or stage play had been adapted to the silver screen without taking advantage of any of its attributes.

1234745,4,B00000JN20,"THE SHANGHAI GESTURE (based on the controversial play by John Colton) is a stylish noir drama which reeks with all the hallmarks of director Josef von Sternberg.  In one of the early loan-outs from her Fox contract, Gene Tierney is a luminous heroine, and Ona Munson provides a fun villainess.

Into the shady streets of Shanghai arrives Victoria ""Poppy"" Charteris (Gene Tierney), the daughter of an influential financier.  She quickly falls under the spell of immoral Doctor Omar (Victor Mature) and becomes a regular at the glamorous casino belonging to Mother Gin Sling (Ona Munson), a dangerous woman not to be trifled with, as Poppy and her father (Walter Huston) will soon discover...

Josef von Sternberg paints a lush picture of Shanghai at the very height of it's excess and debauchery.  Just like Poppy, the audience is slowly seduced into this gilded world; and it's a very heady cocktail.  THE SHANGHAI GESTURE also features the moody and shadow-heavy lighting effects which von Sternberg was famous for.

Gene Tierney (dressed in an exclusive wardrobe by Oleg Cassini) glows as Poppy, and it's really fun watching her playing drunk and disorderly!  Ona Munson is the true star here, and provides a chilling and controlled performance as the ultimate dragon lady, Mother Gin Sling.  Munson is best-remembered for playing Belle Watling, the tart with a heart in ""Gone with the Wind"".  She was one of the most fascinating yet cruelly-ignored actresses of the period; it's great seeing her in a meaty role like Gin Sling.  Her incredible clothes were provided by Royer.

Victor Mature and Walter Huston barely register (you're meant to be watching Tierney and Munson).  Phyllis Brooks is also memorable, playing a wisecracking chorus girl on the make.

I really enjoyed THE SHANGHAI GESTURE, even though the current DVD release from Image Entertainment/Mystic Fire Video suffers from just about every example of print damage you can imagine (ghosting, watermarks, vertical scratches); and the audio is almost as bad.  But, in a strange way, it all adds to the character of the movie.

1234747,4,B00000JN20,"This movie has been written about so often and so well, and in such detail, there is no need to re-hash all that here.  The play from which it is taken is deadly dull and pretensious.  It amazes me von Sternberg was able to transform it into stimulating adult entertainment.

Nevertheless, from my point of view, the movie ends as a demonstration of the betrayal and infamy and moral depravity of Anglo-colonials, not only in the Orient -- and not only Englishmen either -- but all over the world.  At the time the movie was made, the notion of such a thing was absolutely scandalous, and that's why the show was hidden by clouds of hippocritical critic-babel, and touted as a kind of von Sternberg freak show of Asiatic, drug-soaked depravity.  The Japanese hadn't thrown the English out of Asia yet, and English-speakers and readers lived pretty much in a land described by W. Somorset Maugham.  Colonialism was far from dead, even in the cosmopolitan metropolis Shanghai; the first and greatest Open Trading City, where anything you could think of and pay for was available.  It's interesting to recollect that Wallace Simpson, who married the King of England and became the Dutchess of Windsor, served her sexual apprenticeship in a Shanghai social club for batchelors, perhaps not too unlike this one of Madame Gin Sling's.

And, it is curious, particularly, that von Sternberg chose to introduce a theme of homoeroticism through the very big, dark handsome and masculine, Victor Mature.  In a burnoose and fez and with smoldering sensuality in every un-blinking black-eyed look, he is/was a challenge to every ""straight"" man.  Today's equivalent would be a muscle-bound actor naked, or in a thong.  Interestingly enough, at about the same time, in THE MALTESE FALCON, the director does much he same thing, in the same way, with the introduction of a character called Joel Cairo, played by, of all people, Peter Lorre.  In that film, the forbidden sin was of Syrian origin, had curly hair, wore a tux, smelled of Chypre and got bitch-slapped by Mary Astor.  What is so remarkable is that the existence of Gay men as sexually secure and formidable, integral figures in a modern story, was a very dangerous thing to propose, let alone to show.

How far we have come in only about half a century.  In SHANGHAI GESTURE, all the so-called vices are on parade, as characters and types in a gambling den (with rooms upstairs.)  It's like an automated wax-works of Protestant sin.  But, looking at those characters today, and that situation now in the age of legalized gambling -- and the rebirth of Shanghai -- we see nothing or nearly nothing out of the ordinary.  Except, of course, the astonishing beauty of the very young Jean Tierny who, under von Sternberg's lens, writhes and pouts like a little kitten being teased just as she enters her first heat.",1154649600,9,2855,4.839506172839506

This story was watered down, so it goes, to get around the Hollywood censors - and nothing is left. There's not a character to care about (except maybe Dixie). Victor Mature is SO bad, it's amazing he had a career at all.",1151625600,3,365,4.367647058823529
1234749,5,B00000JN20,"this film was originally a play written in the mid 1920's by john colton. there are only three copies of the play in circulation, of which i own two. the watered down version of this play is what you see in this film. by the 1940's standards, this film is outrageous, but by todays standards it is rather tame. from my information, there were over one hundred versions of the film script that were submitted to the censors.

the original name of one of the leading characters was NOT madame gin sling but ""mother god damn"". the original setting for the piece was a brothel, not a gambling den.

the original shanghai gesture, according to john colton was thus, extend the hand to its extreme and place the tip of one's thumb to the edge of one's nose with the pinky facing outwards. this is never mentioned in the film.

kind of loses the point, doesn't it?

but this film, despite its shortcomings is most worthwhile.",1140652800,6,918,4.5120481927710845
1234750,4,B00000JN20,"""The Shanghai Gesture"" is often regarded as an early film noir. I'm not sure I'd go so far as to call it noir. Maybe proto-noir. It embodies some noir conventions and defies others. ""The Shanghai Gesture"" is a dark story of revenge and greed among seedy underworld characters. But the underworld is in Shanghai, not in the urban jungle of World War II-era America. The story takes place when Shanghai was an international city, part of the British Empire, ""a refuge for people who wished to live between the lines of laws and customs"", as we're told in the introduction to the film.

The film's first scene shows us a street in Shanghai populated by colorful characters from every corner of the globe. Then we enter ""Mother Gin Sling's Casino"", an opulent gambling house where Asian, European, Indian, American, and Arab patrons come to be entertained and where no one likes to talk about his nationality. Most of the film takes place in this exotic casino where shootings are commonplace and no law exists except for that of the proprietor, Mother Gin Sling (Ona Munson). One evening, Mother Gin Sling is informed that she must close her establishment and move to another part of town. This district of the city has been purchased by a conglomerate that intends to renovate it. Not too concerned about the problem, Mother Gin sets about finding a way to bribe or threaten the new owner, Sir Guy Charteris (Walter Huston) into letting her stay. That same evening a beautiful young woman calling herself Poppy Smith (Gene Tierney) visits the casino. A pampered and overprotected rich girl straight from finishing school, Poppy is looking for adventure and danger in the ""wicked city"". With the encouragement of Doctor Omar (Victor Mature), a slick, poetic ladies' man who works for Mother Gin Sling, she finds too much of it. But everything that goes on in Mother Gin Sling's casino is to her purposes, which will be revealed at a dinner party on the Chinese New Year, attended by Sir Guy and Shanghai's powerful people.

""The Shanghai Gesture"" was originally a play by John Colton, and sometimes it feels stagy. Written for Broadway in 1925, the story tries to bring together all manner of vice in an irresistibly exotic location, which is nothing if not entertaining. The most enjoyable performance in the film is probably that of Phyllis Brooks as tough chorus girl Dixie Pomeroy, who has landed in Shanghai and has to make the best of it. She's got spunk and most of the film's best lines, although she's a minor character. Gene Tierney is generally convincing as a spoiled rich girl who is transformed into a raving junkie. And she radiates star power. Ona Munson is always upstaged by her outrageous coiffure.

""The Shanghai Gesture"" hasn't fared well with critics, but it was never intended to be great writing. This is salacious popular entertainment, the stuff of pulp fiction. We have a pretty young woman in an exotic environment who jettisons all propriety and succumbs to a lifestyle of debauchery. In a grand style. And to her own ruin, of course. Shanghai? International intrigue? Gene Tierney? I can't help but be entertained, even if the film is a bit ridiculous.

The DVD (Image Entertainment disc): This isn't a pristine print of the film. It has some white specks, although not enough to be distracting. The sound needs to be cleaned up, but the only major problems are during the dinner sequence. It's very watchable, but it needs some work. The only bonus features are text filmographies for director Josef von Sternberg and four members of the cast.",1112486400,16,3571,4.839607201309329
1234751,5,B00000JN20,"Although the plot may present some ""holes"" (I think maybe due to censorship ""cuts"") and some of it might strike some as ""uneven"", it is nevertheless an attractive, visually stunning, sumptuous, bizarre, baroque, ""decadent"" Von Sternberg film, with a great cast.
I will start with Ona Munson, `cos she really steals the film from everyone, including one of my favourite actresses and beauties, lovely Gene Tierney glamorously dressed by her then husband Oleg Cassini. Munson's performance is a-la-par with any of the exotic characters played by Marlene Dietrich in her `30s Paramount Extravaganzas. As Mother Gin Sling, she's simply superb, wearing heavy Chinese-make-up, and all kinds of exotic hairstyles and clothes. I only recall Ona Munson, as Belle Watling in ""Gone With the Wind"", and you'd never tell they're the same person. She seems to have been really a ""chameleon"", because she IS the embittered Mother Gin Sling. I think she gave an Academy Award winning performance (IMHO).
On the other hand, Walter Huston, one of America's greatest actors ever (""Dodsworth"", ""Treasure of Sierra Madre"", etc.) is his usual best as Sir Guy Charteris, the man who wants to take control of Shanghai, thus affecting Mother Gin Sling's business (she owns a Casino located in an ""important zone"" of the city). I won't tell more.
I saw this one on TCM (they borrowed it , because it does not belong to their catalog) with a Robert Osborne introduction, excellent as always, and he tells that no one could had filmed this story, because of the restrictions of the Production Code, until Von Sternberg did it, using the ""innuendo"" and making changes on the original story here and there, to have the ""approval"" seal. Anyway, the films is charged with sexual tension, double-entendre, amorality and decadence, as I stated before. It is a Shanghai that can only exist within the mind of the ""Master of Style"" that was Von Sternberg, I just love his films.
And we have too a lovely, young Gene Tierney as the spoiled Victoria Charteris (Huston's daughter), Victor Mature as ""gigoloyish"" character, Phyllis Brooks, as a beautiful, wise-cracking chorus girl (she reminded me of Jean Harlow's wise-cracking roles), Ivan Lebedeff as a ""Casino-Roulette-addict"", the funny Eric Blore as an employee of Mother Gin Sling, Mike Mazurki (as one of Mother Gin-Sling's thugs) and Madame Maria Ouspenskaya, in a small role (The ""Amah"").
In all, a worthwhile film, which I enjoyed completely. Sadly, it seems there are not ""restored"" copies available.
I think I'll buy the DVD, in spite of what's stated about its quality, because I don't think that there is any better edition around (Both the VHS and the DVD were edited by Image).",1087862400,28,2705,5.040178571428571
1234752,4,B00000JN20,"Strangely enough, Gene Tierney isn't the main character of Von Sternberg's THE SHANGHAI GESTURE, neither Victor Mature alias Dr. Omar, nor Walter Huston. No, the picture is haunted by the Sternbergian character of ""Mother"" Gin Sling who steals the show whenever it appears. Ona Munson and Von Sternberg have created here a figure worthy to stay in the annals of cinema if not in the cinematographic harem of this director, in the company of Marlene Dietrich.
Too bad that the quality of the DVD presented by Image isn't at the level of the movie. Bad images, bad sound and extra poor bonus features. This shows how highly this company thinks of the movie lovers.",1080000000,19,662,4.815789473684211

But a white woman playing the role of Mother Gin Sling comes off as grotesque and unconvincing. Those were the dictates of the film industry at the time and evidently still is today to a degree. The film is rife with already well-established racial stereotypes, not to mention sexism, yet a sweep of the camera shows all nations, ethnicities and genders are represented throughout the film, and on fairly equal footing, in just about every role except the lead ones. Overall it isn't as tight a film as von Sternberg's ""Shanghai Express"", even though it rarely ventures outside the depicted casino. Worth watching even so, on several different levels.",1474416000,,811,5.059701492537314
