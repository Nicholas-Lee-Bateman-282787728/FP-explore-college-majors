222075,5,6300198200,"PBS's production of The Displaced Person is a perfectly cast adaptation of Flannery O'Connor's short story of the same name. In particular, Shirley Stoler seems born to enflesh Mrs. Shortley, the wife of the white farm hand, as O'Connor wrote her.

The story takes place on a Georgia farm after World War II. The owner of the farm, Mrs. McIntyre, has a Catholic priest find her a ""displaced person"" to work as a farm hand. The Polish refugee,  Mr. Guizac, is honest, industrious, and capable, and thus upsets the equilibrium between Mrs. McIntyre and her white farm hands as well as threatening the social balance between whites and blacks on the farm.

The production is very faithful to the short story, though it omits the incident in which Guizac catches Sulk, the younger black farm hand, stealing a chicken; and, the final phrase of the story, in which Fr. Flynn ""sit[s] by the side of her [Mrs. McIntyre's] bed and explain[s] the doctrines of the Church"" is expanded into a discourse on the doctrine of Purgatory.

The short story was filmed at Andalusia, Flannery O'Connor's home, according to the credits. This is a perfect setting since the Displaced Person is her story that is most closely tied to her life and farm, and a  nice treat for O'Connor fans, allowing them to experience her farm.

A quibble: Amazon lists Henry Fonda as one of the actors; I did not see him in the production, and the IMDb listing for the film does not include him among the cast.

222078,4,6300198200,"It was good to see Flannery's O'Conner's short story acted out. As I was in an O'Conner discussion class, this helped a lot. The setting, casting and tone were quite appropriate. Wish there were more movies of O'Conner's work!",1380412800,,226,4.82051282051282
222079,5,6300198200,"I agree with fra7299's very thoughtful review of this film of Flannery O'Connor's longest short story (and the concluding story of her first collection entitled ""A Good Man is Hard to Find"").  The film make lack the immediate clarity and impact of current and contemporary film-making quality because it was made for television: a series on PBS, I believe, called ""American Story Theatre.""  But, as I am sure fra7299 agrees, the cinematic structure, the camera work, the pacing, and above all the superb acting are excellent and do O'Connor's story justice.  (Some of her works, such as ""The Life You Save May Be Your Own,"" have been interpreted for television, stage, or film with disasterous results and total disregard for faithfulness to the author's intentions.  The whole ending of ""The Life You Save..."" was turned on its head in a television production of some years ago.  The film of her novel Wise Blood by John Huston is commendable in many ways -- the casting and consequent acting, the pacing, the tone, but it omits [perhaps unavoidably]certain elements, images, and scenes from the novel that are essential to Flannery O'Connor's meaning.)  However, this remarkably fine televion/film interpretation of ""The Displaced Person"" is, indeed, faithfully and beautifully rendered . . . a creatively reverent cinematic enhancement of O'Connor's masterful story.",1294358400,9,1369,5.256880733944954
222080,3,6300198200,"I guess there are two ways to view this DVD. From a literary standpoint, this is almost a flawless version of Flannery O'Connor's short story, as most characters and situations are exactly the same as the story. However, from a film viewing standpoint, it could have been better. The film's quality definitely seems dated, and seems to have a low budget quality about it. It's ironic because the film's poor quality blends in right with the dreary mood of the story.

However, I found the DVD quite worthwhile because I found the story interesting enough and it seemed to follow right along with O'Connor's tale. In ""The Displaced Person"",  Mrs. McIntyre, who owns land in Georgia after World War 2, goes against the grain by allowing an outsider, a foreign man and his family, to come in and work on her farm. Immediately when he comes, the place seems to be disrupted. While Mrs. McIntyre loves Mr. Guizac's (the displaced person's) work ethic, others, such as Mrs. Shortley, resent that a foreigner can come in and ""mess"" things up. Harmony is not easy to achieve once McIntyre allows his family to stay, and eventually this leads to Mrs. McIntyre deciding to ask the Shortleys to leave. However, Mrs. Shortley, overhearing this, decides to have her family leave. This leads to more turmoil and Mrs. McIntyre must deal with the conflict of keeping or firing the Displaced Person. This eventually leads to a few tragedies on the farm.

What this film does a superb job of is underscoring the themes that O'Connor loved to present. The idea of jealousy or simple-mindedness is examined in the character of Mr. and Mrs. Shortley. While Mrs. Shortley has visions that Mr. Guizac will lead to nothing but destruction, her husband is as narrow-minded and prejudiced as she is about foreigners. Mrs. McIntyre seems to be looking for ""salvation"", but she only finds it in the Displaced Person, Mr. Guizac, not in the priest's lectures. In this way, many of the characters are misled and ultimately must pay the consequence for not seeing situations in more reasonable ways. While the Displaced Person comes in and ruins the harmony, many of the characters are eaten up by their own motivations and seemingly destroy themselves with gossip and attempts at self-gain.

What makes this a great film for fans of O'Connor is that there are overtones to a deep psychological meaning that you might not find in just the average movie. This film was clearly designed to be true to the story, and so the impact is greater. It is a rather short film, being only about fifty minutes in length, and there is even a short performance from Samuel L. Jackson in here.

I would say that if you are a big O'Connor fan than this is worth a check out; if you aren't then you might not be so impressed.  I give four stars for the film itself, but 2 for the quality.",1215820800,6,2840,4.692771084337349
222081,4,6300198200,"I am fond of this video and grateful for its existence. Say what you will about the production; for most of us, it provides a rare chance to see the home in which Flannery O'Connor spent her adult years and in which she wrote most of her stories(the film was shot 'on location' at the farm). After O'Connor's death, the family kept the farm private, and her fans had to catch what glimpses they could. Now, of course, Andalusia is open to the public on Tuesdays and Saturdays, but for those who live far from Milledgeville, ""The Displaced Person"" provides a chance to see what the author's life was like - and - it's a whopping good story.",1110499200,7,639,4.423728813559322
222082,5,6300198200,"I must disagree with the previous reviewer.  This version of the O'Connor story is beautifully produced as well as acted.  It has a stateliness and sadness that approximate the themes of the story, that man cannot be saved  by his reason and logic alone but in a world of inexplicable evil must  submit to Christian salvation.  Like it or not, politically correct or not,  that's how O'Connor felt.
Irene Worth is magnificent as Mrs. McIntyre,  too consumed with ""practical"" matters to recognize the lost state  of her own soul.  And she's matched by the likes of Shirley Stoler, Lane  Smith (hiliarious), John Houseman, and a very young Samuel L. Jackson.
Lastly, plaudits go to the gentle, elegiac photography and Bill Conti's  ravishingly beautiful music score.",951350400,16,764,5.032

222135,5,6300198200,"It must be difficult to even try to translate O'Connor's themes, characters, and sense of place to film. This adaptation (which I first saw when it was broadcast on PBS in 1977) is about ninety percent successful. Yes, the fact that we can't get inside Mrs. Shortley's head to experience her final revelation is a big minus. But the atmosphere, the director's lack of sentimentality, and (most particularly) Irene Worth's performance are powerful compensations. I don't believe anyone who loves the story can find fault with Worth's incarnation of Mrs. McIntyre.

7804591,5,6300198200,"I have to say that this film resonates with me in a peculiar way.  I feel that it captured the spirit of the American South quite accurately, and even mirrors some of my own experiences there as an ethnic Pole from Chicago.  I landed in the deep south of the American United States after joining the military.  Military culture and anthropological makeup is primarily Southern and its saturation is markedly Southern when stationed in the South.  My family were displaced persons to America after World War II.

The focus of this film is not so much on the Polish family as much as it is on the Southern WASP's who form up the group of antagonists who plot in various ways against the Polish family.  They do so on the working principle of American Southern Chauvinism.  The protagonist of the film is a landowner, a WASP woman, who is weary of the poor help she has endured on her farm in the past 20 years.  Most of her help consisted of Southern poor black ""Negroes"" and ""white trash"" as she referred to them.  She begins the film ecstatic about the arriving new Pole, and how energetic, thrifty, and skilled he is.  The Pole is accomplishing everything from farming to fixing mechanical equipment at record speeds she has hardly seen before.  Slowly, though she transforms and joins the group of Southern antagonists in the typified chauvinistic working principles.  The Pole becomes the hero and martyr of the film due to this antagonism.  The moral narration is anchored by the Roman Catholic priest who was a friend to the white woman (a very unlikely scenario in the deep South of Georgia).  The Priest orchestrated the sponsorship of the Polish family to this farm.  Some theological messages of purgatory are conveyed subtly midway and then strongly towards the end.  This is no doubt a reflection of Flannery O'Connor's Roman Catholic faith.

This is a fascinating film that is my first introduction to Flannery O'Connor, and I look forward to reading her books in the near future.",1468108800,,1992,4.760932944606414
