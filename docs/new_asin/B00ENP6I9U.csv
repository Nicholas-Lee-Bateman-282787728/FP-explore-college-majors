5928979,5,B00ENP6I9U,"Kings Faith on DVD is an excellent movie full of action, suspense, faith and love. It tells a story of Brendan who had no family and got involved in a bad life with many bad decisions.  In was in and out of many foster families and finally got put in a juvenile penitentiary. While there he became a Christian. When he gets out he has his last chance.
  Friends from  Brendans past look him up and try to get him to become involved again. They try to pressure  Brendan by going after his new friends.
What will become of him and his faith now that hes out?
  This is a very entertaining DVD and full of action. It captured my young adults attention and they really enjoyed it.  A really nice movie to watch with the whole family. Even though it is a Christian film the acting and scenes are very professionally done.
  Kings Faith tells us that with Jesus we have second chances and life can be good and fulfilling. You don't have to be angry all of the time or out to get everyone. I highly recommend Kings Faith.

5928980,5,B00ENP6I9U,"King's Faith was a great movie!  The story was very good and there were times that I was surprised, tense, moved, and several times where I laughed/chuckled. There is some violence and drug content in King's Faith, but nothing overly graphic (in my opinion).

The only thing I didn't particularly care for about King's Faith was how towards the beginning of the movie, there were prolonged moments with little-to-no dialogue - which made my attention kind of wane. I understood the reason for them (to show how the main character was adjusting/getting used to his new life), but that wasn't a favorite part of the movie for me.

The acting was fantastic and I loved the characters of Mike and Vanessa. I could definitely feel for them and the grief they were going through - Vanessa especially.

Overall, King's Faith was a wonderful movie with a great message! I recommend this movie for teens and adults - it was great!

5928995,5,B00ENP6I9U,"What a wonderful movie. Exes can be jealous like what happened between Zach and Natalie. Don't hide the truth. Both Brendan King (Crawford Wilson) and Natalie Jenkins (Kayla Compton), who develop a serious relationship,  have done so at some point but found love with each other. Brandon found Christ, and  Mike and Natalie both have played a major part in that. Natalie gave him a cross. She also was worried about him when he was severely beaten and wanted to know he is safe like any other true relationship involves in part when at least one person in it is affected! He saved her when her car burned too, which is why else I am proud of her for being there for him! Some may want to be content cautious, but overall this is a very good, life changing movie!",1488844800,,762,4.435714285714286

Just as Moses struck the rock, so did King (and countless other Christians) strike the rock in their moments of frustration or faith lapses.  Does this make them unbelievers or unrepentant sinners?

The movie did try to send a good message and there were some very big issue that were addressed in this film. I will give it credit for that. Drugs, gangs, violence, and abortion are very real problems. But, if you are going to make a movie addressing these issue it needs to be watchable and NOT make me want to run out of the room.

5929121,5,B00ENP6I9U,Good movie.,1417910400,,11,5.0
5929122,1,B00ENP6I9U,"Just like Hans Christian Andersen's tale where `the emperor had no clothes' yet everyone feared the penalty of stating this truth, let me state CLEARLY, ""This movie is NOT Christian and the title character is NOT behaving as though he is `born again' or even wants to be""! It is heartwrenching to read reviews which proclaim stories of this type as Christian. Simply giving an actor a Bible to read and setting up a storyline which suggests that he used to be a `bad person' but is now a `good person' (in terms of his social behavior) doesn't make a person a Christian. In fact it doesn't even mean that the person has a fear of damnation, or for that matter ... even a fear of God. All it means is that a person has discovered that one type of behavior is much more likely (than the other) to bring a more pleasant environment into ones daily social life. Social/moral conversions are far more common than spiritual conversions and Matthew 7:16 is a pretty simple way to tell the difference. ""By their fruit you will know them.""

Almost from the opening scene, this movie proves that King hasn't truly changed (inside his heart) in terms of his purpose/priorities in life. In fact, he is still trying to find comfort by changing his physical environment (proven by his attempt to renovate the nightmare of a house where he once lived). If a Christian were trying to make amends for the past, it should be to repair broken relationships with PEOPLE, not fix up old buildings! Even more ridiculous is when the story exposes the indefensible revelation that he has decided to continue to withhold the secret whereabouts of a very large volume of drugs. What possible excuse could he have to do that? Could there be any question about what the right thing to do would be? I can't accept for a second that he would (or even could) sleep nights with this moral millstone around his neck.

I can say in all honesty that I can't find anything in this story which gives me the impression that either the writer/director or the movies co-writer, have even the vaguest notion as to what happens to people when they asks Christ into their heart. Furthermore ... I find it bizarre that in the storyline, the name of `Jesus' is spoken mockingly (twice) by Eli, (one of the gang members), and in another place, Kings new-found friends `jealous boyfriend' also uses the name of `Jesus' multiple times (in an unquestionably hateful way), yet ... never, to the best of my knowledge, was it spoken at all by the supposedly born again character.

If you go to the Amazon listing for a movie called Cherry Crush, (which is another movie written and directed by the same person), you can see the trailer for that movie. When I saw it, it told me all I need to know about the reason this movie is so totally clueless about the way someone who is born again would actually behave. There seems to be a common theme between the two movies, but that commonality is one focusing on young adults with antisocial and twisted views of life! Some people might argue that the director could have become a Christian sometime after the time when Cherry Crush was made, but this movie, in and of itself, proves otherwise. In short  this story is empiricism in nature, and is merely a humanistic interpretation of proper Christian behavior, not a genuine Christian view. 1 Corinthians 2:14 states But the natural man does not perceive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he understand them because they are spiritually discerned.

At best ... I could go along with a discussion which would show this movie as a training tool for explaining the difference between Christianity and secular humanism. Apart from this possible use, the movie is a total waste in every conceivable way. Simply putting a movie's character in an environment where people talk about, and/or quote from the Bible, doesn't make the story or the character Christian.

This movie makes a naive attempt to exemplify superficial changes in moral behavior as being one and the same with being born again. In conclusion ... it is an insulting and deceptive depiction of what really happens when a person asks Christ into their life.

In detention Brendan gives his life to God.  He is discharged from detention to a foster home of christian foster parents.

I am usually a fairly tough critic when it comes to Christian cinema (cinema in general), but I am more critical with Christian cinema because the message is so crucial. Overall the movie is well done, the overall acting is good, there are some rough patches, i.e. some music issues and a few weirdly delivered lines (not unlike many other movies), but the story is layered and has many beautiful subtle moments that resonate. This movie takes some risks with the story telling and content, but it is not unnecessary or graphic which is a relief. I also like that it is not completely predictable.

5929213,4,B00ENP6I9U,"Featuring some strong acting, a gripping story-line, and a beautiful score, ""King's Faith"" is a movie worth watching! It wasn't long into the movie before I became absorbed by Brendan's story, a foster youth who has lived through some harrowing experiences and has chosen to turn his life around with God's grace. The movie aptly depicts how the choices we make can have long-term consequences, and the plot-line of Brendan being stalked by his old gang is a frightening one. The movie does a great job at building up tension, not only in terms of Brendan's situation with his former gang, but also regarding the blossoming romance he encounters and his relationship with the foster parents. As a professional myself who works with both foster youth and foster families, I found that there was an excellent element of realism to how Brendan and the foster care system was portrayed. I found myself wishing that the own youth I interact with would experience a life-changing encounter with Jesus, such as Brendan does. The character of Brendan is not perfect, and he doesn't always make the right choices, a fact I also appreciated.

Although it wouldn't be fair to compare this film to big-budget movie films, I believe that ""King's Faith"" is a solid addition to Christian-based films, a movie with a lot of heart that is likely to move many people to tears. You will quickly grow to care about the lives of those depicted on the screen, and find yourself rooting for them and what they are going through. And, as already noted, I must say that the musical soundtrack for the movie is just beautiful, definitely enhancing the overall movie experience.

I strongly recommend ""King's Faith"", whether for viewing as a family (with children of an appropriate age), as a youth group, or at other church functions. I award ""King's Faith"" 4 out of 5 stars.

5929214,5,B00ENP6I9U,"Brendan King has lived a hard life, running with a rough crowd, being bounced from foster home to foster home. But he found a faith that turned his life around while spending time in the juvenile penitentiary.

Fresh out of prison he finds hope and security in a new foster home and friends that share his beliefs, but his ties to the past threaten to drag him down, especially when it begins to threaten the lives of those he loves.

King's Faith is a fantastic film, with a compelling plot, and many talented actors. I've seen a lot of Christian films, and sadly I couldn't always in good faith recommend them, but King's Faith is completely different. It has a strong message of faith that strikes a perfect balance in that it isn't overly preachy, yet it wasn't flimsy in its message in a Hallmark card kinda way like other films have been. King's Faith conveyed a strong message of faith, that fit perfectly into the setting and plot.

This movie is honestly the best Christian movie I have seen in a long time, the storytelling was inspiring, compelling, and powerful, this is a movie that I could rewatch multiple times because it was just so well done from the story, and filming, to the fantastic actors.

The reason that this movie is rated PG-13 is because of three scenes of violence. The opening scene shows a blurry flashback of Brendan's old life and how he watched a friend die in his own blood. And two scenes where a gun is waved around a in a forcefully threatening manner. There wasn't any swearing or innuendoes, or sex. But because of the violent scenes parents should let their kids watch this only with discretion, because it may not be good for younger children.

Overall though, I give this movie a full 5 stars, and would heartily recommend it to anyone who will listen! This movie well so well done, and I was engaged from the very start of it. Absolutely excellent!

5929215,5,B00ENP6I9U,"Dont let the rating be the standard by which you choose whether to purchase and watch the film or not.  In my opinion, there wasn't anything that would offend and audience; there is no foul language or sexual content.  What is a part of it are the themes of faith, forgiveness, romance, death, plus so much more.  There are brief parts where guns and drugs are present.
The whole DVD is geared toward giving hope to those who have made past mistakes such as being pregnant as a teen or running with a gang.  Some of the characters have seen some rough stuff because of the choices they made and the resulting consequences such as being in prison.  When one young man is in prison, he is given a Bible to read.  This is the only book he is allowed to read.  As he reads this book, he becomes a Christian before being released.
Upon his release, his new life and old life collide and tough choices have to be made.  Those decisions are not just witnessed by teens, but the foster parents whom he lives with and the police officer who waits to see him fail.  Yet, some believe in him and encourage him to share his past and show them where he has been and how they can make a difference.
As I watched it, the movie struck me as authentic, not made of nice thoughts or emotions, but raw reality at times in all its ugliness.  I saw how love can really cause a person seeking to live for Christ wrestle with acting by faith or in the flesh.  It was refreshing to see the foster parents open their hearts to his sordid past and help him walk through growing up into a mature Christian young man.
One of the main female characters comes from a broken home, and her choice not to share with her mother what is going on inside her makes for a rough road.  As she watches the believers gather to work, study, talk or just hang out, her heart is challenged to open up and take a risk.  Unconditional love is costly as the movie portrays, but so worth the risk or investment when given time after time.
It is a touching movie that has extra features and a Bible study that can be done as a result of seeing the film.  I hope it is shared in homes all across the globe.  Even if the subject matter isn't an issue in your home, remember it may be in a neighbors, family or friends home.  After watching Kings Faith, it might just give you ideas on how to reach out to others or start up a discussion about the many topics brought out in the film.",1383696000,2,2432,4.209051724137931
5929216,5,B00ENP6I9U,"We don't have the opportunity to view many movies, as few pass the radar of what we find acceptable.  When I read the story line for this movie, I felt that it was watch-worthy.  This is the story of overcoming odds, redemption, and healing.
The movie, King's Faith, is the story of one's journey from darkness to light.  Brendan King, a young man lost in the Foster Care system, found himself on the road to destruction.  His only family were the gang members he had been running with until the day they were caught and he was put away.  During his time in a juvenile detention center, Brendan was given a Bible and after reading it, knew that there was more to life.
In the movie, he enters his final foster home where he is given the opportunities to grow and become responsible.  He attends school and becomes part of a club called the 'Seekers', a group of christian young people who look for opportunities to do good in the community.
It's not long before Brendan's past catches up with him.  Some members from his old gang seek him out, looking for information on the whereabouts of some hidden goods.  When he refuses to give them what they are looking for, they begin to harass his friends and destroy the hope that Brendan has found in a dream to build a recreational house for children in his old neighborhood.
Brendan eventually makes the choice to try and deal with the situation himself, instead of relying on God.  It could cost him everything, but he can't stand the thought of harm coming to those who have shown him love.  What will the outcome be?  You'll just have to get the movie for yourself to find out. =)
This movie is rated PG-13 for content - violence, drug content, and thematic elements.  There is a scene, like a flashback, where a youth is laying in a pool of his own blood.  There is also some other violence relating to the gang members that seek him out.  You do not watch what transpires, but you know what happened, when you see the outcome.  The movie also references a situation regarding abortion - the hidden secrets, pain, and suffering associated with that choice.  There is a strong emphasis on faith in God throughout the movie, as well as references to Scripture.  I was also impressed that there was not foul language in the film.
While I would not watch this movie with my children, I do feel that it would be an acceptable movie to watch with older teens.  There are many opportunities to discuss various situations throughout the movie.  Overall, I feel that I could recommend this movie.

5929217,5,B00ENP6I9U,"Brendan King has been kicked around foster care for a large part of his life, searching for somewhere to belong he found himself at home with a gang in the city and ends up on a downward spiral that lands him in prison. As he serves his time, thanks to a Bible study group, Brendan has found a new relationship with Christ. As Brendan moves in with a foster family and starts back at high school, he finds his past coming back for him as former gang members want to find out where he and a friend hid a stash years ago. With his life spinning out of control will Brendan being able to lean on his new found belief or will he slip back into his old ways?

As a fan of faith based movies I really enjoyed this movie, Faith-based movies are always hit or miss where they can come off as very cheesy and over stereotypical or just appear to have little no budget, thankfully King's Faith presents a strong script with believable characters and does not play on stereotypes to hold up its script. This is a great movie, with numerous points of discussion and how someone can change and grow.

This is a great movie for the family, I would recommend against younger kids watching it do to gang violence and some images are a little graphic, otherwise it is a great family movie to own!

5929219,5,B00ENP6I9U,"Can a person change?
In this movie, King's Faith, Brendan King shows us how.  A troubled teen, Brendan has just gotten out of juvie and is placed in the foster home of a couple, the Stubbs, who recently lost their son, a police officer.  Mr. Stubbs' faith in God allows him to be close to Brendan right away, but his wife Vanessa is still angry and bitter after the loss of their son that she cannot find it in her heart to even try.  As Brendan assimilates to high school he finds joy in serving with other members of the Faith Club and together they decide raise money to transform Brendan's old inner-city house into a safe haven for troubled youth.  Along the way Brendan meets another troubled soul...  a homecoming queen who is not much unlike himself.  As they all work together to change the lives of inner city kids, Brendan's old gang comes skulking around determined to beat out of Brendan the location of a hidden stash of drugs.  As he refuses the gang starts bullying his friends, going so far as to run Brendan's best friend down while he was riding his bike.  With no where left to turn, Brendan fears he has no other options but to give them what they want...  Or does he?  With help from his new friends Brendan realizes that ""if you stand firm in your faith, anything is possible.""  I was on the edge of my seat wondering how Brendan was going to extricate himself from a tough situation while remaining true to his newfound faith.

This movie was really good.  In the special featurrette ""behind the scenes"" the producers discuss that this was a low-budget movies, but you can't tell it.  It is very well made. Some of the acting was a little, well, corny and parts of it to me moved a little slow, but I believe this movie will resonate with teenagers and young adults.  James and I joked about how much we DID NOT miss High School while viewing this movie.  Being a teen was SO hard.  There are a lot of teens who are hurting and lost and I do not envy anyone who is trying to be a teenager today.

5929221,5,B00ENP6I9U,"18 is the magic number for Brendan King. It's not his age but the number of foster home's he's been in and he's hoping that he will finally find a place to call home, not just a temporary stop in life. Yet for Brendan, he's had to grow up fast and see things that many hope never to encounter in life. After losing his mother to drugs and alcohol and watching her die and never knowing who his father is, he goes with whatever family he can find. For Brendan, that would mean gangs. Gang members looked out for one another and were there for you when family wasn't. At least that is what he always believed.

Now after being released from prison after a drug raid that left his best friend dead, Brendan believes he discovered his new lease on life. It began when the only book he could have in prison was a Bible given to him from a pastor. Having nothing else to do and no hope for a future, Brendan discovered that there is someone who will never leave you and one that offers the life he always dreamed even if he never discovered it from his own family. Armed with trying a new path to life, he becomes a foster child to Mike and Vee who have suffered their own loss, their son who died as a police officer when a traffic stop resulted in being shot by gang members.

Now if Brendan can only convince his foster parent's that he has changed along with the kids in his new high school who wonder just how true the rumors are about him. However just as he's hoping for a positive change, the local sheriff keeps a close eye out believing no one can reform and eventually will fall back into their old ways. When Brendan's gang members are released from prison they come back around searching for a drug stash they believe that Brendan has hidden. Will he be able to hold fast to the faith he has found or will old habits call him back?

I received King's Faith by Provident Films and FlyBy Promotions for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and the opinions expressed are strictly my own. While this is a Christian based film, the subject matter deals with gangs and drugs and may not be suitable for all members of your family. Parental discretion is strongly advised but it does open up conversations for parents of teens to have with their children regarding the circumstances surrounding the issues Brendan faces not only from peer pressure from his old life but also in dealing with defending his faith to people who don't believe he's changed for the better. In this DVD extra's are some clips that can be used for Bible Study purposes as well as a discussion guide link for more resources. My 14-year-old daughter watched this with us and found it worth watching because is deals with the very things happening within our high school and she got to see an positive alternative by the end of the film both in the way of second chances and in how God can come through when you least expect it. Well worth every 108 minutes and for that I give this one a 5 out of 5 stars.",1382659200,5,3028,4.355752212389381

8607094,5,B00ENP6I9U,INSPIRATIONAL! I work with troubled teen boys in a residential home. I have shown this several times & they can relate. In fact they often requests to rewatch it. This movie promotes forgiveness and promises hope. It teaches that God has a plan for our lives; if we get off track he will guide us back if we only listen. HIGHLY RECOMMEND,1512777600,5,337,4.451612903225806

8607096,5,B00ENP6I9U,This is the story of a young man who didn't have a good start in life.  He struggled against some serious odds  to find his way and a purpose to his life.  How refreshing to watch a movie about young people who posses faith and moral depth and don't follow the crowd. Thank you to the filmmakers.  Keep up your good work.,1510444800,4,321,4.129032258064516
