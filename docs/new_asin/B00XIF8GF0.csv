7167772,5,B00XIF8GF0,"Very powerful, atmospheric and suspenseful film. If you like thrillers like 'Prisoners', 'Mystic River', 'Gone Girl', 'Gone Baby Gone' etc you will love this - although this film is also very original. The cast are amazing and all deliver superb performances with Oscar nominee Diane Lane being the standout. Very recommended.",1431648000,34,326,5.411764705882353
7167773,5,B00XIF8GF0,"I thought this film was great! Well written, the actors were all spot-on as their characters AND the characters were all well developed, so you could care about what really happened in this ""scary good"" movie. I don't want to spoil any of the plot, but as a mother, Diane Lane was creepy in her depiction of the mother ashamed of her daughter's looks, while all the while, being more than just a little loving and caring to the character of ""Ronnie"", played by Dakota Fanning. I definitely think this a story worth watching, especially in light of just way too many crimes that are being committed by minors in our present day society.",1431648000,37,635,4.578947368421052
7167774,4,B00XIF8GF0,"(Every Secret Thing) has an amazing ensemble cast Starring Diane Lane...Elizabeth Banks...Common...Dakota Fanning and Nate Parker. All the acting was amazing by the supporting cast as well.

The story revolves around two young women who were sent to prison as young girls for kidnapping and killing a biracial baby girl. The girls (Dakota Fanning) and (Danielle Macdonald) are released after Seven years and soon after their release, a Three year old biracial girl goes missing from a furniture store while her parents aren't looking.

Detective Nancy Porter (Elizabeth Banks) who found the dead infant reluctantly takes on this missing child case and of course these girls are the main suspects! As the movie goes on, as each girl is interrogated we see each girl's version of what happened the day the baby was kidnapped and and eventually killed.

Diane Lane is perfect as the mother of one of the notorious girls as the role requires almost bi polar type behavior. It's a good story and mystery ,tragic yet not graphic. There are some flaws such as how they set up certain parts of the story to tie into each other so everything would seem even,it's still a very good watch that I recommend!",1431648000,38,1195,4.876847290640394
7167775,5,B00XIF8GF0,"While this a sad subject, the acting in this film was terrific.  It's hard to imagine a child doing such horrible things, but that's life sometimes.  This was a great movie and I would recommend it to a friend who likes similar subjects.  I loved the ""I wonder who"" aspect of this film.  It makes you wonder who dun it and the ending is a little bit of a surprise.  Don't miss this movie if you like horror, suspense and surprises.",1488326400,4,431,4.271604938271605

7167778,4,B00XIF8GF0,Predictable but safe plot.  Pretty much came clear right at the start but Danielle Macdonald was great in acting the innocent criminal.  Diane Lane was good.  Dakota Fanning clearly didn't put a lot of heart into this role but it was very nice to graciously cede the movie to Macdonald.  Worth while.,1485561600,,300,4.711538461538462

7167838,3,B00XIF8GF0,"In case there is any question, women, young and old, can do bad things just like the men.  This movie provides a fictional example.  One of the strongest promoters of this film is Frances McDormand (Olive Kitteridge), its producer.  Nicole Holofcener (Enough Said) wrote the screenplay based on Laura Lippmans novel.  It is directed by documentarian Amy Berg (West of Memphis) and has a terrific cast of women in the key roles.

The story involves a pair of 11-year old girls who, on their way home, find a baby crying in her carriage on the front porch of a house.  With no adult in sight, they pick up the girl and take her to their secret room inside a forested area of their town.  They originally though they could mother the kid, but soon lose interest with horrible results.  Both girls are put in juvenile detention for 7 years and are now free.  Ronnie (Dakota Fanning, The Twilight Sagas) works part time at a bagel store and struggles with her life.  Her parents are the kind you're glad you never had.

Alice (Danielle Macdonald, The East) is, wellon the robust side.  Shes always walking around town with her Big Gulp.  She doesnt have a job but is constantly pushed to find one by her mother Helen (Diane Lane, Man of Steel).  That coupling alone is a head scratcher.  An overweight girl, with curly blond hair is the daughter of this sleek wisp of a woman?  On top of that Helen is also a respected elementary school teacher.  When a 3 year old girl disappears from a furniture store, detectives Nancy Porter (Elizabeth Banks, The Hunger Games) and Kevin Jones (Nate Parker, Non-Stop) are called in to investigate.  Porter was a rookie cop who actually found the baby, 7 years earlier.  The event still plays on her mind.  She wants to pull out all the stops to find the 3 year old before harm befalls her.  Guess who the prime suspects are?

The movie is dark and very unglamorous, adding to the already depressing tone.  Im pretty sure there is not a smile to be found in the films thankfully brief 93 minute running time.  It is a pretty good procedural however and provides enough twists and turns to keep you guessing.  At least for a little while.  Experienced mystery solvers will figure it out early on as the little secrets are released in drips and drabs.  I found the film to be a slow-burning psychological mystery, often coaxing the characters to just get on with it.  A couple surprises at the end provide the proper context to an overly complicated story.",1460678400,3,2485,4.573696145124717

7167840,1,B00XIF8GF0,"CONTAINS SPOILERS.....

How does a large white woman with curly blonde hair
carry a black three year old with dark curly hair
out of a big furniture store
in sunny daylight,
and no one sees anything...not child's the parents...not the customers in the store...not the people on the street....
and even the salespeople say that no one left the store?

Why was a black baby left alone in a stroller on a porch,
so that when she cries, no one hears her,
so that two white girls can walk onto the porch,
take the baby out of the stroller,
and walk down the street with the baby,
and no one sees or hears anything?
How long was the baby out of the stroller before anyone noticed that she was kidnapped?

This movie was too long and very boring and dragged out.
There weren't enough details and nothing was explained.

How did the police finally find the dead baby?
How did the police connect the two little girls to the dead baby?
How was there enough evidence to convict both girls, for an equal sentence, so that they are released on the same day?

The second kidnapping was just as ridiculous as the first.
There was no emotion from the characters.
Especially, the mothers who lost their babies did not show any emotion - - the black mother whose baby was killed, the white mother whose black baby was kidnapped, and the baby killer whose baby was put up for adoption against her will - - they were all flat and emotionless.

This movie focused a lot on race issues and weight issues.

I hated the ending.",1458432000,,1503,4.423913043478261

Why have some reviewed giving the entire play by play of the movie? Whats the point in someone actually watching the movie if they can just read about? I think that is why they write books...

It kept me thinking come on come on and the ending took me by surprise. It wasn't so much of a drag to get to the end, but more of build come on hurry up. It was easy to tell the who, but the why with the twist at the end was great. I think they could have done a little more with Diane Lane's role, but still the part suited her acting personality quite well. I think I could add this to my collection of movies easily.

7167857,3,B00XIF8GF0,"Based on a book by Laura Lippman, Every Secret Thing revolves around the abduction of a little girl from under the noses of her arguing mother and boyfriend in a second hand furniture store. Seven years ago two girls around the same age at the time as today's abductee, were jailed for abducting and killing a baby.  They have both been released from jail, are both or one of them responsible for this abduction, or should police resources be looking elsewhere?

Every Secret Thing is a mystery that isn't really one you look for clues and solve yourself, as information about the responsible person, and even the baby abduction eight years ago is slowly dripped out to the viewer (as Elizabeth Banks' detective character discovers it), in the slow moving plot. When we are shown the second abduction, it doesn't really make sense how they would have got out of the store, but I can't really go into that  without giving away who was responsible.

Overall the movie resembled a made for TV movie, even though I'm pretty sure it wasn't.  There are constant switches between the two crime time periods which the ones without the girls in them isn't always immediately clear which time your in. For example I thought they found the second abductee body only with a later scene did I realise, oh that was the first kid. The acting isn't bad, but the pace of the movie is slow.  I also wondered why Orangetown would have a sign that said Town of Orangetown, that we constantly revisit for some reason.  When half of your town's name has the word  town in it, surely the one word is all you need on a sign.",1446854400,,1600,4.550522648083624

Diane Lane, Elizabeth Banks, Dakota Fanning, and Danielle Macdonald plays against type in this extraordinary indie film. I love the multiple twists. No one is who they seem. This movie is dark, riveting, surprising, and highly underrated. I haven't read the novel but I think I might now. The subject matter is a little disturbing but none of the violence is graphic or unnecessary. I highly recommend ""Every Secret Thing"". It's so incredibly eerie.

7167905,4,B00XIF8GF0,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

I always find it odd when a plethora of movies with similar themes all come out at the same time. I know movies take time to get financed and produced but it still seems strange. With CHILD 44 released a few weeks back and STRANGERLAND out the same week as this title maybe we could lay off missing children for a while now. Doubtful but lets hope.

The movie begins years in the past with Alice Manning and Ronnie Fuller, two young girls forced into a non-existent friendship by Alices mother Helen (Diane Lane). Sent to a party the backward and poor Ronnie lashes out at the partys host and the girls are sent home. Along the way they hear a baby crying from the front porch of a house and take the baby with them. When the child is later found dead, the girls are sent away to juvenile prison.

Now after time served and reaching their 18th birthdays, the girls have been released. Alice (Danielle Macdonald) has returned to her mothers home. Each day she sets out in search of work as Helen continues to support her but nudges her to find a job. Ronnie (Dakota Fanning), on the other hand, is working at a nearby bakery. While Alice seems content with her life now Ronnie seems troubled. Heavy on the make-up and sporting a chip on her shoulder attitude, shes moving through life but with no direction.

Then it happens. Another baby comes up missing. And with a push from the mother of the child the two girls killed years ago, the police come calling with the girls as the most obvious suspects. Detective Nancy Porter (Elizabeth Banks) was the officer who found the first girl and is still troubled by all aspects of that case. Detective Kevin Jones (Nate Parker) is more inclined to believe that the boyfriend of the new missing childs mother could be involved. Between the two of them a search for the truth and the missing child brings them together to search all possibilities.

What makes the movie interesting is the lives of the two girls and how they slowly are revealed to us as the investigation and search for the new missing child takes place. A combination of flashbacks and current events helps us to see who these two girls are and what might motivate them (or not) to do what they did so long ago. That is if they actually did it. At times the flashbacks make us wonder if it wasn't one as opposed to both who were responsible for the death of that child.

The movie progresses along nicely and brings all of the characters together at different times before providing the solution to the problem at hand. No one was left unscarred by the tragic events of the past. Those wounds led to some serious secrets that are uncovered as the movie moves forward. And until the end not all will be revealed. In the end everyone develops new wounds and the secrets that were kept will have a lasting effect on everyone.

Well written, well directed and well-acted this movie will keep you guessing from start to finish. At times youll think you know what happened when a new clue or moment presents itself to have you guessing all over again. The simple solution seems readily apparent and then a twist makes you think your original guess completely wrong. Then something else happens and you consider that maybe you were right the first time. Thats the sign of a good mystery. Agatha Christie would be proud.

While you would think the stand out performances here would be the two girls in fact the ones that stand out are Lane and Banks. This is not discrediting the performances of Macdonald and Fanning who do a great job here, but the subtle moments of discomfort Lane displays and the troubled officer Banks offers are both a joy to behold. Both are actresses deserving of bigger films.

With the tons of serial killers, rapists and one shot murderers seen on TV these days my guess is little will be considered shocking here. Yes a child has been killed but fortunately for us the director and writer determined that to witness that murder was something we didn't need to see. We already know its a terrible thing to have happened. But along with that murder are several other secret things that are just as troubling. This one is worth watching.",1440547200,8,4221,4.543421052631579

Her mom (Diane Lane) is best friends with other girl, Ronnie (Dakota Fanning) who is quiet and reserved. She seems to have a messed up family life, but that is not developed. It isn't long before another girl goes missing, and the two girls become suspects. Elizabeth Banks plays the detective investigating the case. She was also the officer who found the dead child seven years ago.

The film includes smartly placed flashbacks. There are also excellent clues, things and dialogue that have no meaning until you know the ending. The plot keeps you engaged as the pieces to the puzzle fall in place.

7167968,2,B00XIF8GF0,"So while the story had some premise, it just honestly felt slow.  The girl playing Alice Manning was hateable, but I didn't feel the full extent of showing her manipulative abilities.  Her performance certainly made me dislike her, but honestly just fell flat with a character who could have been really fun to play.  It isn't hard to hate her for the things she's accused of; but instead of her character moving the story along interestingly, she bare-minimumed it.  Boring.  The tale was also set in really dull and dark places which kinda works in a film like Gone Girl, but just got old here.  The Whole Story (until the last few minutes)  was just DULL.  Watching Elizabeth Banks was by far my favorite part of the film.  She handles drama well.  It was neat to see Diane Lane play borderline crazy as well.  You never really knew what she was thinking, but it just could have been so much more and wasn't.",1435881600,,911,4.52760736196319
7167969,4,B00XIF8GF0,"There is a lot to like about EVERY SECRET THING.  Directed by Amy Berg from screenwriter Nicole Holofceners adaptation of Laura Lippmans novel, the mystery drama boasts a first-rate cast, all at the top of their game, and a basic story that is certainly intriguing.

Eight years ago, a baby went missing and, after its body was discovered, two young girls were arrested for the crime and imprisoned for seven years.  Now, they are out and another little girl is missing.  Is history repeating itself?

Newcomer Danielle Macdonald, a terrific find, and Dakota Fanning play the grown versions of the two girls, considered by detectives Elizabeth Banks and Nate Parker as the most likely suspects in the new disappearance.  Diane Lane is cast as Macdonalds mother, who is not quite as innocent as she seems, and Common has a limited role as the father of one of the missing children.

Aside from the fact that it moves a bit too slowly for my taste and deals with a horrible subject (i.e. the murder of children), my basic problem with the picture is that it lacks focus.  I have not read the novel upon which it was based, but my hunch is that the script follows the book rather closely, which, if true, would be a mistake because novels and screenplays are not the same.  They have different requirements.

Watching EVERY SECRET THINGg, I kept asking myself: (1) Whats this movie about? and (2) Who is the storys protagonist?  Was it the detective (Banks)?  One of the girls (Macdonald or Fanning)?  Or, was it the mother (Diane Lane, who has first billing)?  As presented, Im really not sure.

Had the filmmakers restructured their film to spotlight the Banks detective character and and/or the ultimate culprit (whose identity I will not reveal here), so that the story became more of a cat-and-mouse game, I think the final film would have worked much better and moved faster.  Indeed, in the deleted scenes included on the DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment, there are two or three sequences that would have definitely enhanced this different approach to the material.

After a young child is taken Detective Porter (Banks) begins to investigate two prime suspects Ronnie Fuller (Fanning) and Alice Manning. These two girls recently were released from juvenile prison for the kidnapping and murder of a small infant. All signs point to Ronnie but she insists she is innocent. It is up to Detective Porter to find the missing girl before it's too late. This is a difficult movie to review. I do have to admit that it was a good movie and the acting was great. The movie was very gripping and it made me want to keep watching to find out what was going to happen next. That said the movie is also very difficult to watch. There is nothing all that graphic, but the subject matter is very disturbing and parents of young children may struggle with this. All that said though this is a very good movie and fans of shows like Law and Order: SVU or movies like The Lovely Bones and Reclaim will like this one as well.

They do a really interesting thing with this movie.  They stay true to the original novel but I feel like they do a lot more to develop the characters.  The book was phenomenol and I would have said complete, so it was interesting to see the way the movie took the character development to a whole other level.

Now they are both 18 and recently released and another child has disappeared from the area--could one or both of the young women be involved?

Every Little Thing has a potentially very interesting set-up but the characters aren't vivid enough to function as more than rough sketches despite some fine work from the cast.  Dakota Fanning plays Ronnie Fuller, the more obviously damaged of the two grown up girls--she's the one that the other girl insisted was responsible for everything.  But the movie seems to have very little interest in her, unfortunately, and allows Dakota Fanning very little opportunity to flesh out her character--we know that she is painfully withdrawn and eaten up by guilt but she is never much of a factor in the present day plot.

The other girl is named Alice and played very well by Danielle Macdonald.  She's fat, has extremely low self-esteem, claims that she was unjustly imprisoned as a child for a murder she did not commit and dreams of becoming a reality television star.  Alice clearly feels no guilt at all which would make her either completely innocent or a monster.

Every Secret Thing is adapted poorly from a novel by Laura Lippman.  The movie version never generates any tension whatsoever and the potentially colorful characters never manage to punch through the suffocatingly inert storytelling which views everything with a badly misjudged detachment that drains all traces of humanity from the proceedings.

Elizabeth Banks plays a police detective who earned her promotion because of the earlier case.  Banks is primarily known as a comic actress and does nothing here to change that impression although she doesn't embarrass herself either.  Unfortunately in a film too populated with underdeveloped characters Banks' Detective Porter is easily the most underwritten of the primary characters.  By the end of the movie I had no idea if Nancy Porter was a good detective or not or whether the man who lived with her was her boyfriend or husband.  Did she feel an extra obligation in the current missing child case since she owes her career to the earlier tragedy?  The movie clearly doesn't care one way or another.

The final scene demonstrates perfectly that the filmmakers never figured out how to adapt the book Every Secret Thing into an effective movie.  It turns out that the childhood scenes at the beginning of the movie are from the POV of a specific character but there is absolutely nothing in the movie to indicate that, which was a big mistake.  In fact the character of Alice Manning would have been a perfect storyteller for parts of Every Secret Thing, with a strong voice that could have cut through the hazy miasma of the film's largely inert storytelling.  Every Secret Thing had the potential to be both funny and creepy but the material never really comes alive enough to be anything more than a dull exercise in nicely photographed misery.",1432512000,5,3086,4.922779922779923

It's broken into 13 chapters. I always notice musical scores when they push scenes to new levels. The all piano score will rip your heart out as the movie climaxes in chapter 11.
