500134,3,6302593301,"The Cat and the Fiddle is the story of a musical couple. They meet when Victor (Ramon Novarro) slips into a taxi being used by Shirley (Jeanette MacDonald). Although she rejects him at first, the two become live-in companions, both struggling to achieve fame as composers. When her song becomes a hit, Victor feels the itch to succeed even more. Shirley is aware of this feeling and plans to leave the city to accompany Victor to the town where they met, hoping to spark inspiration. However, he knows that this will jeopardize her career, so he stages a change of heart and leaves her to compose an operetta.

Novarro is slightly creepy in his love scenes as he seems more like an obsessive stalker than an amorous man. His voice is not great, but he is certainly passionate and attractive. MacDonald has a soft, operatic voice which is not my favorite, but she shows vocal ability. Her acting is not wonderful.

The music is not very memorable, nor is the story or the chemistry between the actors.",1144281600,4,1000,4.6440677966101696
500135,5,6302593301,"Although mostly forgotten, this is a really fun excursion back into 1934.  In Brussels, failed composer Victor (Silent star Ramon Navarro, in a finely etched performance) is running from a restaurateur when he hops into a taxi occupied by Shirley (Jeanette). [That's what they used to call ""cute-meet"" in screenwriter parlance]. She haughtily asks him to find his own cab but he turns on the charm.  They find they are living next door to each other in matching 'pensions'...The Kern-Harbach score is lovely: the most memorable tune being ONE MOMENT ALONE. There is also an eclectic ditty entitled IMPRESSIONS IN A HARLEM FLAT...While not considered a completely successful transfer of the orignal Broadway show - which ran 395 performances - it's more than pleasant enough.  Also worth noting is the rare screen appearance of Vivienne Segal as the vampish leading lady Odette.  Novarro, whom I've never seen sans in the Garbo flick MATA HARI does a really admirable job here. This would be his last part of any consequence in films. Some trivia: Jeanette's costume in the finale was worn by Joan Crawford in the LET'S GO BAVARIAN number in her 1933 hit DANCING LADY.",1043712000,23,1167,4.969230769230769
500136,4,6302593301,"Besides ""Mata-Hari"" this is the only talkie starring Ramon Novarro, available, in vhs or dvd format, on the market, and thus one of the only chances to hear his pleasant voice and to check what a fine actor he was . Personally, I'd only seen previously, the aforementioned ""Mata Hari"" and the blockbuster silent ""Ben-Hur"" (1926). Here Novarro plays Victor, a young struggling composer who lives in Brussels, where he meets and falls in love with american Shirley, played by Jeanette MacDonald, in her first feature at new home MGM, singing along the way (both), some nice Jerome Kern songs, most notably ""The Night was made for Love"" and ""She didn't say Yes"".
Fine character actors Frank Morgan (as MacDonald's powerful and rich suitor), Charles Butterworth (playing an absent minded friend of Novarro), Jean Hersholt (as Novarro's music professor) and Henry Armetta (extremely funny as a bad-tempered cab driver- he's named his taxi ""Teresa""!), add charm to this lovely musical with the ""european"" flavour, and the technicolored ending was a nice surprise.",1030060800,15,1057,5.151162790697675

7829991,4,6302593301,Navorro was pretty good and actually helped the film be better than it really was. McDonald was all right and the rest of the cast added zip to the otherwise rather flat story. Pretty good film,1430611200,,193,4.388888888888889
7829992,5,6302593301,"Jeanette MacDonald shines like a bright Northern star in this 1933 MGM classic also starring Ramon Novarro. Novarro was a matinee idol at MGM during the silent era; in 1922, after filming ""The Prisoner of Zenda,"" MGM executives brought him into their studio as the Latin lover after the sudden and unexpected demise of Rudolph Valentino. Novarro had only two years in his contact with MGM when he did ""The Cat and the Fiddle."" Novarro offers a brilliant performance as Victor Florescu, a talented, Brussels-based composer of serious music under the tutelage of respected Professor Bertier. When he meets beautiful Shirley Sheridan (MacDonald), a New Yorker living in Brussels as a professional Opera singer, the two bohemians fall in love. The story is a musical comedy and the songs from the Kern-Harbaugh stage musical comedy is used largely intact. Jeanette MacDonald's ""The Night Was Made for Love"" later became a big hit. This pre-code film is not without controversy with regards to the moral codes, since MacDonald and Navarro are portrayed as live-in companions.

Many movie critics and fans were used to Novarro in silent movies and they were less enthusiastic about his talkie movies. In fact some of the greatest silent stars of MGM had difficulty making success when talkies came along. I for one enjoyed this romantic comedy tremendously. I thought MacDonald and Novarro made lovely couple and the story is full of warmth.",1420675200,,1435,5.080508474576271
7829993,5,6302593301,First time that I have ever seen Ramon Novarro in a movie and his pairing with Jeanette MacDonald is great to see. Beautiful songs and the ending is in color. Highly recommend this movie!,1392076800,3,187,4.529411764705882
7829994,4,6302593301,"It's admirable of Warner Classics to keep making these less well-known titles
available. This adaptation of a Kern-Harbach stage show uses very little of the
original storyline but manages to cram in most of the main melodies. And the
last five minutes are in color. Basically, Ramon Novarro is an operetta composer
and Jeanette MacDonald is a composer, too. In the stage show, she was a pop
tunesmith, and the two were in a culture war. The movie loses most of this, and,
frankly, the story loses power. Still, the music is wonderful and there's lots
of it, and MacDonald gets another chance to play a woman sensible and artistic
who is constantly perplexed by the craziness of men. It's a great part for her,
and she plays it very well. Novarro is a passable singer, but of course MacDonald
is one of Hollywood's great vocalists. Her fans will have to have this, and
students of the Broadway-Hollywood interchange will want this movie as well. Not
the greatest, but very enjoyable, and very fast-moving, too.",1380844800,9,1010,4.777142857142858
7829995,5,6302593301,I really enjoy listening to Jeannette McDonald as she sings. You come away with complete happiness. The love scenes in her movies are done exceptionately well. There is drama also which is also done well. Directors back in the Golden Age of Hollywood knew how to make good movies and this is one of them. If you like musicals for the songs that are in them then you will enjoy purchasing this one. Amazon comes with a promise of meeting their customers expectations and they do this with excellence. Their movies are in very good condition and the price is very reasonable.,1372464000,,573,4.627450980392157
7829996,4,6302593301,"A ""goody two shoes""  says nice things about everything.  Well this is one of a few reviews of mine and I still can't stop loving the oldies. If you want to acquaint yourself with a fantasy l920's, check into your video time machine and find yourself living in a cute and weightless world where people fall in love in two seconds and out of love in a half an hour. They also have meteoric careers in two minutes and sing a lot about their loves or disappointments;and there is Jeanette MacDonald singing beautifully as alwlays and talented Ramon Navarro, acting and singing well.  The songs are pretty and the world is one we would love to believe in.",1291766400,,650,4.491525423728813
