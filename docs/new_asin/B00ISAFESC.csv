6290643,4,B00ISAFESC,"In Clifford Odets' original 1937 production of GOLDEN BOY, boxer Joe Bonaparte was played by Luther Adler, Lorna Moon by Frances Farmer, racketeer Eddie Fusilli by Elia Kazan and next-door neighbor Mr. Karp by Lee J. Cobb (who in the film is Joe's father). Other stage actors: John Garfield, Howard Da Silva and Karl Malden.

Rouben Mamoulian's film version has 21-year-old Bill Holden in his first credited role. Bill was almost fired early on because of mediocre work but Barbara Stanwyck intervened. Success here established him as a star and gave Holden the nickname 'Golden Boy.'

Among the uncrediteds:
James 'Cannonball' Green as MSG opponent 'Chocolate Drop' also cameoed in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ROCKY-IV/dp/6304007582/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ROCKY IV</a>&nbsp;(1985).

Dorothy's most famous role: the alcoholic second wife of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CITIZEN-KANE/dp/6304119046/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CITIZEN KANE</a>&nbsp;(1941).

From seven decades distance, the clichd plot of 'Golden Boy"" and some of its dialogue go beyond melodrama, landing squarely in the corn bin. Joe Bonaparte, a first generation Italian-American, is torn between his love of music and an urgency to ""be"" somebody and to make big money. Joe abandons the violin to become a boxer but immediately regrets the decision, and not just because he's disappointed his papa. An unscrupulous promoter and manipulative girlfriend keep Joe in the ring, and when a gangster buys his contract and schedules a Madison Square Garden bout, it leads to tragedy. (This final boxing sequence is the film's highlight.)

8644969,3,B00ISAFESC,"Was just ok. Interesting to watch the stars but the story didn't grab me. Am a fan of William Holden but its obvious he's feeling his way here.

This story didn't grab me, despite the roster of terrific stars. Am a big fan of William Holden but its obvious he's feeling his way here. Love Barbara Stanwyck and she's terrific as usual. I thought Lee J. Cobb was the best performer in this drama as Holden's father. This is a drama and a bit soapy at times. The quality of the dvd is fine. Don't recommend unless one is just really a fan of the stars.",1525910400,,549,4.179245283018868
