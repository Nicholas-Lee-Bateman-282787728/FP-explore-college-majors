5189431,4,B008XEZXV6,"Liked the movie and the lead actress being over 30. The story focus on her and her ""trapped"" lifestyle and the destroyed path it leads. Once again from Japan, a great story with ropes on soft skin.",1376611200,,197,4.351351351351352
5189432,4,B008XEZXV6,"I love this genre and true to the Japan cinematic industry it doesn't fail to amuse, arouse and hold your interest",1375142400,,114,4.476190476190476
5189433,5,B008XEZXV6,This movie is excellent movie enjoy but you need a strong stomic to watch so be a wear of the movie it is very sexuality not for kids at all do not bring kids only adults you need a good head to focus enjoy no girl friend recommended  enjoy if girls watch it remember its only a movie not real life .,1367712000,5,300,3.838709677419355
5189434,1,B008XEZXV6,"this is definitely not what I expected. I should have read the buyer reviews more carefully! Be sure you read the description and reviews, to  make sure you want this film.",1366070400,,172,4.548387096774194
5189435,2,B008XEZXV6,I gave it two stars because the package was in good condition and the disc was snapped in place.  No visible signs of damage to the disc surface.  I will watch it soon.,1355356800,,168,4.0606060606060606
5189436,3,B008XEZXV6,"if you enjoy Japanese movies that it has limited nudity and some sort of silly humor included in erotic movie. You will enjoy this one. It contains very light and comical( if you are a hardcore BDSM fan) BDSM scenes. Story line makes no sense at all, so pay no attention. Females in the movie attractive and show 70's style T&A. If you have Amazon.com instant video, see if it is available there before buying it. Another words, if you can rent first do it before purchasing. This is my opinion anyway...",1355184000,19,504,4.489130434782608
5189437,5,B008XEZXV6,"While the title of this film may initially conjure up visions of 'historical' scenarios such as Racquel Welch cracking her whip above a bunch of semi-naked female galley slaves in the 1960's flik ""The Magic Christian"" - or perhaps a group of female prisoners being shipped to a penal colony somewhere - in fact there is very little 'nautical' action contained within this bent little bit of Japanese erotica.  This is Switchblade DVDs third  release (to date) of a Shintoho Studios production 'celebrating' the writings of revered (at least in Japan) S&M author Oniroku Dan... based on one of his stories of the same name.

There IS a 'slave ship' in the movie, but it is apparently more like someone's houseboat moored in the harbour where a group of 'masked' bondage devotees gather to act out their fantasies - which mostly involve (purportedly 'consensual') tying up and sexually 'humiliating' women.  'Fans' of Japanese cinematic kink are doubtless well aware that this is a favorite 'theme' of the genre, as well as, author Oniroku Dan.  BUT - scenes that actually take place on the 'slave ship' are minimal within the  plot of the film and most of the action takes place 'on land' in modern day Japan.  The story-line of 'Slave Ship' is actually pretty intriguing as it involves some seemingly autobiographical elements with an exploration of the complexities of sado-masochistic relationships.  This is not a 'white slavery' movie - rather, the lead protagonist, 'Onimata', is a 'respected' popular S&M writer (as only in Japan!) and his character acts as a bit of a moderator throughout the tale.  There are two principle female characters in the story - one is a young woman who is sort of a protege of Onimata - she is curious about, but leery of getting involved in. S&M sex - the other is an older woman, 'Kikue'  that Onimata previously had a D/S relationship with - they apparently first met at a function on the 'slave ship'...  She is now married to a 'nice guy' BUT is having an affair with another crazed individual, 'Kitagawa', who provides the doses of 'extreme' sexual action that she has become addicted to, and this duality in her personality has caused her to have a nervous break-down.  Onimata attempts to intercede on the husband's behalf to 'get to the bottom of things' but as he 'investigates' and confronts the 'players' involved he is 'shocked' at the revelations he discovers and the enigmatic plot threads play out in some surprising ways!

I gave this movie 5 stars, not because it is on a par with 'Citizen Cane', but because it 'really delivers' in the BDSM department AND frames that action with some interesting human psychological drama (for a change!). Pretty much ALL of the ero-action in this flik is bondage oriented and the 'scenes' are very intense - definitely the 'roughest' of the 3 Swithblade 'Oniroku Dan' oriented releases to date.  While the sex scenes respect the usual parameters for Japanese Pinku erotica (no naked genitals or explicit acts graphically depicted) the SM scenes get fairly wild and portray acts such as whipping, hot wax, enforced golden showers, and a few other 'imaginative' kinks that I will leave to the potential viewer to discover for themselves!  There is, happily, no digital censorship in this film but that is because those elements of the female anatomy that might usually be 'fogged out' are, instead, artfully covered in ropes - via some pretty stringent shibari style ties.  What, perhaps, lifts all of this above the usual 'concerns' about misogynistic portrayals of 'abused' femininity is the exploration of the 2 principal female character's complex libidos.

""Slave Ship' decidedly 'pushes the envelope' for this type of film and causes one to 'marvel' at the cultural differences between the 'East' and ""West"" - that a movie with such intense fetish elements could be made for the 'general public' in Japan!  But, that's sorta what 'makes life interesting' and, personally, I sure appreciate that Swithcblade is bringing some of this imaginative erotica 'across the pond' for discovery by a new Western audience.  IF the viewer enjoys this type of film I would highly recommend it but be fore-warned that it is 'bent'.  On the 'technical' side: the film quality is  exlnt widescreen format - English subs are really good - no 'extras' other than some 'trailers' for other Switchblade offerings.",1354233600,31,4386,4.956343792633015
5189438,1,B008XEZXV6,"Anyone can do this with a VHS player and a DVD burner.  Give me a reason to replace my VHS tape, give me a disc with chapters at least.
The film should get FIVE stars, the format gets one star and that is too many.",1345680000,10,214,3.7555555555555555

It co-stars Wallace Beery (another forgotten actor). With these two how could this miss?,1399680000,,252,4.622222222222222
