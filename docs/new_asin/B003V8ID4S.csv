In Disk 2, the English subtitles are atrocious!!  Typos and misspellings are the very least of the issues.  The translations are very poorly done and it makes it extremely hard to follow what is going on.  I wish whoever had done the subtitles for Disk 1 had carried on for Disk 2.

The storyline itself is wonderful and I very much enjoyed the show from start to finish.",1360540800,,597,4.5327102803738315
8406487,5,B003V8ID4S,"I won't lie I bought this product because of Kim Jaejoong.

But it turn out to be a wonderful drama, its a mixture of laughter and sadness.

Misfortunes come and go with the characters, and keeps you glued in your sit wanting to watching more.

This is one of the best Japanese dramas out there, the writers really thought this drama out because it deals with everyday human problems.

And what more than featuring the networking of Tweeter.

Though the translation were off by the characters names and phases said throughout the drama in the last couple episodes, you can pretty  much tell what they really meant to say.

Watching this great drama wasn't a waste of my time.",1291075200,2,675,4.621848739495798
