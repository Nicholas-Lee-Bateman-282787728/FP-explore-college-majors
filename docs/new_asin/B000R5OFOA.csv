2858571,5,B000R5OFOA,"Doc Strange has always been one of my favourite marvel character. It is a fresh new look of his origin and it is pretty well done. I really enjoyed this movie. It was far better than The Invincible Iron Man and the Ultimate Avengers. In fact, I was surprised and it was far better than all the Action Movies from Marvel this year. The storytelling is amazing and the character development is well done too. It was mature and very dark.",1187481600,7,435,4.382716049382716
2858572,4,B000R5OFOA,"With the comic book generation getting older and better income, and technology becoming more integrated, marvel has wisely chosen to animate many of their older comic books.  This is the fourth in a line of animated features (the avengers 1 &2, and Iron Man being the other three).  This one I think is on par with avengers one.  The story line devolps Dr. Strange better than the other three films, and the action sequences are second to none in the animation world.  Can a neurosurgon manage to live without his hands.  Can he break free from his on inhibitions and limitations.  Check this film out and refresh your memory on this classic character.  Stan Lee has done it again.",1187481600,3,681,4.6722689075630255
2858573,4,B000R5OFOA,"I've always been into the more hands-on of the superhero crowd, so you might see why Dr. Strange isn't one of my comic book favorites. Nevertheless, there were times when I looked in on him and relished his wacky adventures and trippy forays into funky looking dimensions, as creatively rendered by artist Steve Ditko. Given that my interest in the Sorcerer Supreme is anemic, I must mention that stories about Strange were never better than when Stan Lee was writing them waaay back in the '60s. I've always thought one of the coolest things about the Dr. Strange mythos were the wonderfully exotic sounding invocations (as imagined by Stan) which Dr. Strange would righteously toss out: ""By the all-seeing Eye of Agamotto!"" or ""By the hoary hosts of Hoggoth!"" Or how about ""By the shades of the shadowy Seraphim!""? But nary a one is uttered in this animated film, however, as we witness Dr. Strange's origin, a stage in which he probably wasn't that familiar with Agamotto, Hoggoth, or Seraphim.

To the plot now: Stephen Strange is a talented neurosurgeon. But he's egotistical, callous, and uncaring. He's even big enough of a jerk that he rejects a plea for help regarding a brain-diseased child who sees in her nightmares a dreaded countenance swathed in flames. One evening, while driving, Stephen careens off the road and hurtles down a cliff, which results in irreparable damage to his hands. Despairing, having lost his fortunes, and having exhausted all treatment options for his injuries, he bleakly reaches the end of his rope. But fate intervenes in the presence of Wong, a sorcerer who senses potential in Strange. Wong sends him to a remote Tibetan monastery, to possibly become a student of the Ancient One. However, Strange, being not much into Eastern mysticism, merely seeks to unearth a cure for his mangled hands.

No surprise then that it takes Strange a while to ""accept the unacceptable,"" but once he does, he graduates from the grasshopper routine and begins to learn the arcane arts at a prodigious pace. In time, he comes to learn of the Sanctum Sanctorum which houses the Nexus, the center of all dimensions. It is the Nexus which the Ancient One and his disciples continue to safeguard from the Dread Dormammu. Dormammu, a malevolent, otherdimensional being formed of absolute magic, has repeatedly sent his eldritch creatures to storm the Sanctum. And, with each successive attempt, he gets ever closer. Dr. Strange figures out that Dormammu's plan is somehow linked to the widespread epidemic of comatose children which has overran many hospital wards. As he sets out to help the children, Dormammu launches an all out final assault on the Sanctum. Now will the true Sorcerer Supreme please stand up?

This being the origin story, parts of the film are naturally slow going. We learn of Strange's tragic backstory and how he came to be so cold-hearted and materialistic in his former civilian life. The flashbacks work to flesh out the character and to further engage the viewer. I'm not sure if the version in Marvel's mainstream continuity had a kid sister. But young April and her plight make Strange a more sympathetic person.

When not focusing on Strange, the film shifts to the exploits of the Ancient One's disciples, in particular to Wong and the surly, arrogant Mordo. Mordo takes it for granted that he is the Ancient One's successor to the title of Sorcerer Supreme. Wong is quite dissimilar to the manservant version from the comics. Here, he's more a colleague and even mentor to Strange. And he has hair. Wong is devoted to the Ancient One and mistrusts Mordo and his lofty ambitions. Meanwhile, they and the other disciples continuously take on Dormammu's ever encroaching minions in heartstopping magical scraps.

With the show of magic being generated to mostly craft weaponry out of thin air, there's no room for the classic Dr. Strange incantations, as I've said (but two more classic phrases I just about forgot are ""By the Vishanti!"" and ""By the Crimson Bands of Cytorrak!""). It would've nice to see more esoteric mysticism going on. It's a bit odd seeing the good doctor engaging in a strenuous physical activity like sword fighting. At least, we get to see him make use of astral projection, a staple of the Dr. Strange comics. Dr. Strange does have over 40 years of published history to draw from. But, to reiterate, I'm not a Dr. Strange connoisseur, so I'm not sure exactly how much was altered in this film. One thing that's been changed for sure are his duds as this incarnation has him sporting a new costume that seems austere but is nevertheless very stylin'.

DR. STRANGE: THE SORCERER SUPREME is the fourth direct-to-dvd collaboration between Marvel and LionsGate and decidedly improves on the stinky animated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Invincible-Iron-Man/dp/B000K7UBTI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Invincible Iron Man</a>&nbsp;dvd which it succeeds. We get very nice animation, explosive and well-choreographed fight sequences, and a decent story with enough soap to tug at the heart and enough tussles to keep content the adventurer within you. People die in this one, thus lending the film more depth and high stakes relevance than, say, your average Saturday cartoon episode.

DR. STRANGE: THE SORCERER SUPREME is presented in wide screen. Special features include: Marvel Video Game Cinematics; the 14-minute-long segment ""The Origin of Doctor Strange,"" featuring interviews with comic book writers Stan Lee and Steve Englehart; A First Look at the promising upcoming ""Avengers Reborn"" (which is set in the future and features Ultron and the Teen Avengers); Doctor Strange concept art; and a trailer gallery. But no film commentary. Which sucks.

I say this one merits a rating of three and a half stars. I wouldn't at all be averse to a sequel. Marvel and LionsGate have something good going here with their direct to dvd animated releases. Keep 'em coming. I'm certainly down with the next project, Avengers Reborn.

2858574,4,B000R5OFOA,"*Spoiler Alert!
Great news!  The new Dr. Strange movie came out and I bought it and watched it the first day.  I was filled with anticipation of my favorite comic book hero coming to the movies.  The DVD cover art is very attractive and has a spell surrounding the Sorcerer Supreme's hands -- spheres with runes and symbols around them showing the fascinating nature of his magic.  I loved the movie and there were many good and not so good aspects to review in it.
The movie began and for the first five or six minutes it was all about magicians I had never seen before.  They all seemed to have magic amulets that weaken the unique quality of the Eye of Agamotto, Dr. Strange's most powerful talisman.  I realized one of these magicians was Baron Mordo, which was cool and then I realized one of them was Wong.  Dr. Strange's house servant of old now has magic powers which rival even those of Mordo!  Wong never had any magic powers that I can recall in the comics.  The most he had was some meager martial arts skill.  So that was a bit of a surprise.
After that the story goes into the origin of Dr. Strange and is extremely well done.  I was very happily surprised by how well done.  Of course, I am critical of events that are mundane which are unbelievable.  One of my few beefs during the origin part is when Dr. Strange is climbing sheer mountain cliffs wearing a parka and gloves and using no climbing tools whatsoever.  This is supposed to be the time when his hands don't even work well and he's pulling himself up mountains.  But, I can forgive for a while.  The other is that climbing into the mountains of Tibet to find a guru is totally hackneyed now.  It would have been a good place to mix it up a bit.  (How about another dimension?)
At a certain point Mordo is told to train Dr. Strange.  They battle with conjured magic swords.  For one thing, the swords are fancy looking but have little magic about them except that they appear out of thin air which is a cool effect, but Dr. Strange has rarely if ever used magic swords.  Swords should have only been used once, if at all in the movie.  He is known for his very powerful magic, not his conjuring of conventional weapons, same with Mordo.  Throughout the movie Dr. Strange's spells are swords or are uninteresting looking.  The lesser magicians that fight for the Ancient One have spells that are much more visually interesting.  I believe Dr. Strange should have had the most visually fascinating spells.  Where are the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak, the Fangs of Farralah, or so many other super-cool spells?  The artists missed out on a real opportunity to dazzle the audience with Dr. Strange's spells.  Remember Steve Ditko???
Dormammu is different looking.  Perhaps it was a good idea to make him look a bit more sophisticated, but his look is really missing something.  I would suggest more details in his appearance or perhaps an attempt at a 3rd dimension to his visage.  Also, his voice is exactly like the voice of the Locnar in Heavy Metal.  That was disappointing and distracting.
The Eye of Agamotto being handed over to Strange just because the Ancient One apparently dies is a bit of a letdown too.  In the comics, he was awarded the Eye by the Ancient One after defeating Dormammu.  It makes more sense and gives the Eye more value that way.  Strange uses the Eye at the end of the movie, but not in any way that made sense to me.  This goes to another point.  Without some kind of narrative the battles make less sense.  So, to tackle that problem I would have Dr. Strange use his trademark spells and also say (at least some of the time) things like ""If I hadn't called upon the Shield of Seraphim in time, Dormammu's bolt of bedevilment would have destroyed me.""  Strange speak, if you will.  If you have a really talented voice actor and script writer it could be pulled off without sounding stupid.  Creating what would eventually become visually distinct and recognizable detailed spells would be cool too.
After the origin parts the plot seems to move too fast, Dr. Strange getting the Eye and the Ancient One dying in the first movie.  The need to move things along shouldn't outweigh the ability to have a good story that can be continued.  If there had been more of a focus on the fascinating nature of the world of magic and dimensional travel, etc. we could have waited for the Eye of Agamotto  to be mentioned later.  I would have had the battle with Dormammu in the Dark Dimension, as it was in the comics.  Battles take place in the downtown areas of a big city (New York?) and there are many witnesses to the monsters later in the movie.  Most of the time in Dr. Strange comics, ordinary citizens are spared the knowledge of magic and monsters.  Dr. Strange keeps these guys out of our dimension.  This leads to a kind of ""secret"" world that only the reader and a few special characters know about.  Dr. Strange's new coat hides his incredibly cool outfit.  Even the cloak of levitation lacks the detailed patterns in the yellow trim and the horned collar is missing!
I loved the adult (violent) nature of the plot.  If there is anything I can't stand, it is monsters that are not evil enough to hurt and kill people.  No problem there.  The many deaths in the movie gave me a good chill.  The tension created when the monsters attacked worked well for me.  The monsters were cool, even if there were a few too many `bulls.'
Some of the special effects were very good.  The spells of the lesser magicians were very visually appealing, even if they didn't have as much power.  The concealing tornado spells were well done too.  For the most part the sound effects were well done.
To review, the origin parts of the movie were pretty much excellent.  The violence is reasonable and mature which is hard to pull off in a cartoon movie I believe.  The movie is filled with character development that works well and is mostly true to the comic book history of Dr. Strange.  Hopefully in the future the writers will not rush the story along or be afraid to repeat and stay true to the original storyline of the Dr. Strange comics.  Mentioning Clea at the end was simply unnecessary.  His spells really need more distinction and verbal description, but that would be easy to manage in a future movie and I do pray there will be many more.  I loved seeing Dr. Strange in a movie.  That alone is cause for celebration.  Marvel has really missed the boat by not creating more Dr. Strange movies.  Hopefully, this is the beginning of a new era of Dr. Strange.  Don't miss this movie!",1187395200,8,6575,4.495777027027027
2858575,3,B000R5OFOA,"after seeing a few Marvel movies and cartoons that have really been off-beat, i was refreshingly surprised at this one. it was a descent show of what the comics in movie form have the potential of becoming, although with a little higher budget it would be much better. the character movements seemed a little stiff and at times it felt as if they were using the old way to make a cartoon.

that was a small blemish. the storyline was all-right, and once again if there were better editing this movie would be great. I loved the visuals for the adjacent dimensions and the idea behind it, but the script seemed rushed and some of the action scenes did as well. I did like the fact that they didn't hold back, meaning they actually killed off many of the characters. I haven't read the comic nor have i seen the TV show, so i don't know how it compares to those, but as for a cartoon on its own, it's worth a watch, but maybe not buying.",1187222400,8,935,4.2824858757062145
2858576,5,B000R5OFOA,"After the hugely disappointing Iron Man movie, I was a little aphrehensive for how they would handle Doctor Strange, one of my favorite, and most overlooked Marvel characters.  Well, needless to say, they got it completely right this time.  Not only do they stick to the comic origins of the character, but his story arc is retained, which makes for a rewarding film, even though he doesn't reach his full potential til the final act of the movie.  I also like how they did the story of The Ancient One, and the passing of The Eye, and his cloak, step-by-step to the new Sorcerer Supreme.  Even the major bad guy, Dormamu was handled well.  Since these features are based more on the Ultimate versions of the Marvelverse, they are open to some modification, but all of the characters' main points were covered.  I can't wait for them to make a live-action Doctor Strange movie, but I fear it won't be as good as this one.",1187136000,6,921,4.551515151515152
2858577,4,B000R5OFOA,"Well after the lackluster The Invincible Iron Man and the dissapointing Ultimate Avengers 2 they finally got it right. Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme is everything I loved about the comics with a little kung fu too. The score was funny though, there are strains from the score of Lady in the Water and even part of a song from Charlotte's Web (the cartoon film of the 80's, I think). But it was nice all the same. Now, as far as Avengers Reborn...God it looks awful. I hope it's not as bad as it seems. It just seems a rotten idea, a total ploy to get the ""kids demographic"". I'm sick of all these movies trying to appeal to this or that audience. Have the artistic integrity to make the film you want to make, if the source material supports it then do it. But as soon as you start thinking about trying to get this type or that type or another type to like your film, pretty soon you have something so vague and watered down that no one ends up liking it.",1187136000,30,959,4.245901639344262
2858578,4,B000R5OFOA,"My first experience of a Doctor Strange Comic was in the early 80s. After voraciously reading through I became a life long fan. It was a bit disappointing that, except for some cameos in Saturday morning cartoons the Doc never had a good live action or feature length Cartoon written for him.

That has now changed.

Note: I give it 4 stars ONLY because I reserve 5 for movies that are SO good that the producers literally walked on water to make it.

There have been complaints that the movie is NOT the Doctor from the Comic books. I have to strongly disagree. The Style is different from some of the runs of Doctor Strange in the comic series (updated and modern) but what you want and expect is still there. Comics change with each new writer and artist and I think it's worth looking at the Movie as if a new Comic team were taking over an existing title. The story is tweaked somewhat and some artistic license is taken in places where the background was a bit open for interpretation, but I really didn't have any problem with that. In some areas there were definite improvement (Wong is a MUCH more interesting character than in the comics).

The Plot moves at a good pace and I didn't find myself wandering or bored.

Some things that I reflected on...

- The Animation is good to very good, borderline great but not astoundingly great. The reason for this looks like money. Think MUCH Better than Sat morning or weekday afternoon Cartoon, but not the masterpieces we've seen from of the legendary Anime films like Akira. The style seems somewhat like what I remember from Batman the Animated series.

- The Audio which has a 6.1 DTS track is as good as any feature length film, the separation is better than many films I've seen/heard.

All and all I would place it as one of the best or the best Animated Marvel has done to date, which is pretty cool since the Doc deserves it.

Now all we need is for Marvel to bring back the character in a regular series. Ideally using the new style in the movie (my hope and recommendation).",1187049600,7,2039,4.459677419354839

2858611,4,B000R5OFOA,"Stephen Strange was an arrogant, brilliant neurosurgeon... until the day his hands were practically destroyed by a car wreck. So he became a wizard instead.

It's kind of an odd backstory for a superhero, but the animated ""Doctor Strange"" movie is a thoroughly solid origin story for one of Marvel's odder superheroes -- it's a slow, somber burn that effectively introduces the character of Doctor Strange, breaking him down and building him up into a true hero. There's plenty of magic and action woven in, but the real fascination is in seeing the title character working towards being a sorcerer.

While driving home one night, Strange sees a demonic flaming face and the spirits of children watching him -- so he promptly spins out of control and goes over a cliff. When he awakes, his hands have sustained massive nerve damage that leaves them barely able to do anything with them. Over the following months, he bankrupts himself seeking a cure, and finally attempts to kill himself after losing his home... but is rescued by a strange man named Wong who promises a cure.

That cure requires him to find a mysterious sanctum in the remote mountains of Tibet, where the magically-adept Ancient One puts him to work while claiming that the cure for his hands resides ""inside you."" But a terrible power called Dormammu is threatening our world, and the Ancient One must teach Strange his mystical powers in order to save it -- despite the treachery of one of his followers. Hint: it's the guy who's always complaining.

Marvel has more recently produced a live-action ""Doctor Strange"" movie, but the animated film is also a pretty solid retelling of the origin of this particular superhero. And it's more fascinating than many superhero origin stories -- while most end up becoming superheroes because of a personal loss or because they've seen injustices worth fighting, Doctor Strange's losses are merely what has shaped his life as a doctor, and he has to move past them to become the Sorcerer Supreme and a world-saving hero.

And as you'd expect of any story that involves nerve damage, demons, suicidal depression, comatose kids and losing all your worldly possessions.... it's a rather somber and dark story. The first two-thirds of the movie move fairly slowly, following Strange as he crumbles physically and mentally, such as when he's toiling to tear down a literal stone wall that keeps rebuilding itself overnight. At the same time, it somberly explores how he became what he is now, even as the Ancient One tears away the last of his arrogance and callousness.

But don't worry, slow does not mean boring. The story veers into Baron Mordo's ongoing battles against supernatural hellhounds and other supernatural problems, even as the Ancient One tries to unravel what Dormammu is doing. And when Strange finally comes into his powers, the action begins amping itself up -- we finally get to see Strange as he was always meant to be, and ger some nice battles both physical (Wong and Mordo duke it out with magical swords) and metaphysical (firing energy blasts at Dormammu).

As for the animation, it is decent but nothing special -- the animation style can be a bit choppy and sometimes doesn't quite get across the mystical, psychedelic quality. But it does a solid job with subtle facial expressions and gestures, and there are some very nice, clean designs (such as Dormammu, who looks a bit like a spectral balrog, or the Tibetan sanctuary's fantastical mountain castle).

And it takes a lot to make us empathize with an arrogant and uncaring doctor, but the movie somehow succeeds at making us care -- we see Strange struggle and crumble and build himself back up. And through flashbacks, we see the loss of his young sister, which he's never entirely gotten over. The flaw in characterization seems to be the warrior Mordo, whose reason for becoming evil is... well, it's that he doesn't like how his boss is doing things. And by ""doing things,"" I mean ""not promoting me for sacrificing my men and wanting to murder comatose children.""

""Doctor Strange"" is a pretty solid animated origin-story for the Sorcerer Supreme, and a pretty decent way to familiarize yourself with Marvel's most magical superhero... if you can overlook the thin secondary villain.",1478044800,,4278,4.922330097087379

2858691,5,B000R5OFOA,"I have ever been a fan of Marvel Comics' ""Doctor Strange"". I've always enjoyed the Sorceror Supreme, and this straight to DVD release of the good Doctor's tale of his rise from self-important doctor to Sorceror Supreme had me enthralled from the get go.

Doctor Strange, voiced by the talented Bryce Johnson, was a good choice for the voice of Strange, keeping with the element of curiosity and intellect that the Doctor displayed in his early days of his learning underneath the Ancient One.

Now, I know that most will complain about the very, very condensed version of Doctor Strange's story, but I believe that Greg Johnson did a great job writing the script for a feature film that highlight's the Doctor's fledgling career as a sorceror, while not completely glossing over all of the parts that make the story important and believable... well, as believable as a comic book superhero can be.

Johnson's screenplay touches on the Doctor's career, putting us into the point where we see the Doctor as he was just before his accident that mangled his hands. A self-important, smug, condescending man who has little time to expend on treating patients who will not attain a spot for his name in medical journals.

The story continues there, touching over his history with his sister, but not completely leaving the parts that flesh out the Doctor, make him more human to us.

At this point, I'm afraid my review must end, for I will not give away the rest of the Doctor's story. You'll just have to see it for yourselves, and that is exactly what I recommend you do. I give the animated adaptation of Doctor Strange's fledgling career a 9/10.",1454976000,,1644,4.754385964912281

The average non-comic book reader who enjoys the superhero genre most likely knows little to nothing about Dr. Strange.

2858867,5,B000R5OFOA,I admit that I found out about this film of Dr. Strange; Sorcerer Supreme from my personalized Amazon account recommendations. Im glad to have been introduced to this movie because of the innovative plot around the archetype of Dr. Strange. In the 2007 animated version of Dr. Strange Sorcerer Supreme a gifted doctors life is turned upside down after a car crash. He ends becoming spiritually changed when he seeks out unconventional methods to heal.  I also enjoyed the unique way that the movie illustrated how sometimes our destinies can be even bigger than a person imagines.  A hidden clue to this is shown when the Dr. Strange character is shown a group of children who are experiencing unexplained visions affecting their mind.,1448496000,3,735,4.967479674796748

2858947,4,B000R5OFOA,"It's difficult to compress decades of back story into a short video for newbies and fans alike. Everyone is going to complain about something, and no one is always happy. That's the case here. But in fairness, the production team does some justice to the topic. There's just enough of the tradition and just enough of a twist to enable this version of the story to come through clearly in one video. There are enough plot holes and questions about how things were portrayed, but the story gives a good foundation for (hopefully) more episodes. I regret that so much is lost - some rich content that shaped the character and his mission, strengthened his connections to the costars of the series, and forged the man into the Sorcerer Supreme. I don't think The Ancient One or Mordo was given enough of the traditional bend, or enough depth for their importance in the universe of stories. I'm pleased with what was, but think so much more could have been done. Newbies will enjoy, and fans will contemplate......",1447200000,3,1011,4.7175141242937855

2859052,4,B000R5OFOA,"Before Dr. Strange became Sorcerer Supreme, he was a supremely icy neurosurgeon, mostly in it for the money and to do surgeries for the record books.  But there are supernatural wonders and horrors afoot, and there are indicators that he was born for something greater.  When an auto accident ruins his hands and his career, he finds himself scrambling up steep mountain slopes in Tibet for a possible cure, but gets hard training a new vocation instead.  All this leads to a showdown with an ancient enemy bent on bringing a reign of terror to the world.
 This is a good character study, and the filmmakers do what they can to put the viewer right there with the good doctor as he reacts to trauma, makes desperate attempts to heal, faces fears, faces past mistakes, overcomes outer and inner obstacles, learns magic, learns to give back, and takes up the mystical mantle.  Theres more emphasis on drama than action, which is not a bad thing.
 A big shout-out to the mostly-Japanese animation team, who give this film an anime look and feelalso not a bad thing.  There are lots of good shots, such as sorcerers bounding over the roofs of cars, tears dripping on an OR floor, the doctors reflection in a pair of spectacles, and the press of a hand against a nexus of magic.  The standard incantations from the comics are missing, but there are plenty of eloquent silences and gestures that get the job done.
 I only give the film four stars, as I found some of the medical and healthcare scenarios a little puzzling.  Im not sure how well some of them would stand up to scrutiny, although a more expert opinion than mine would be a better judge.  But once life veers the good doctor off the medical path and onto the magical path (however severely), the skys the limit.
 Should Marvel decide to return to the animated film series, it would be grand to have a sequel where he jumps into fantastical alternate universes, as in the comics.  And is surprised by Clea.",1425686400,6,1963,4.590257879656161

2859063,3,B000R5OFOA,While I love Doctor Strange and would love to see the eventual movie be a fantastic success this cartoon is lacking.  The main problem is that the overwhelming majority of Marvel Animated Features are a one off good for what they are but presented in such a way that they can never be expanded upon.  Thats not to say that the presentation we get is without redeeming features but the moments that you can actually call a solid win are few and far between. The origin story is something that the overwhelming majority of the audience would be familiar with anyway and ultimately the villain is forgettable.  While the end of the storyline is promising it is also equally frustrating because we know we will never see any of these people again.,1418342400,,743,4.613636363636363

2859073,3,B000R5OFOA,"There will not be a feature length film released to theaters any time soon if this movie is any indication or omen. This work feels as if someone threw some material at the oscillator to see what would stick. Take some original story line and throw in some ""cool"" new stuff that will hopefully bring in a new/younger audience. But the original material was re-conceptualized and the new stuff was undeveloped, so you get this half-hearted product.

I had to watch this product because I have loved Doctor Strange since I was about 9 or 10 back in the early 70s. He was a hero who went places and did things that no other super hero could do. And those places always looked so amazing to me. Dali, Gaudi, these artists would have understood the places Doctor Strange visited. The places that should be interesting in this movie did not have well imagined key animation cells. Riddle me this, why would Chinese animators put Greco-Roman architecture in a location that is to be Tibet? Oh, so that's why the view is rather washed out? I get it!

The folk who made this movie get the concept of a Sorcerer Supreme, but they do not know Doctor Strange as well as most fans do. I also do not feel that had I known nothing of the comic book, I would not be crying for more of this having watched it. My guess is that any future for this franchise will entail more training and raw recruits rather than being about Stephen Strange and his trials and tribulations. This movie wrapped things up with a bow, there is nothing left, except for cleaning up the fiddly bits.

I do not see Johnny Depp playing Doctor Strange if this is how they want to play it. I think they can add the martial arts, but not at the cost of losing what made the original story so strong it has remained alive for so many decades.

The more I write about it, the less I find to like about it. So I am left to hoping that someone with tons of money will someday come to save Doctor Strange from this ignominious heartbreaker. Note to self; add this to things to do with lottery winnings, should that ever happen.",1409356800,,2077,4.373056994818653

As it turns out, this is the high water mark for Marvel Animated movies.  The voice cast is top notch and the story is engaging and fun.  It captures the essence of Stephen Strange's origin story and balances two important villains pretty well at the same time.

2859080,5,B000R5OFOA,"This is a far superior Doctor Strange movie to the version made in the 1970s.  Though this is animated it's actually a very complex and mature story.  That's not to say a younger viewer can't appreciate it, but it's mature enough where an adult should not feel ashamed to watch it.

If you want a retelling of Doctor Strange's backstory this film covers the bulk of it quite well.  The animation is lush and vivid.  The writing is so well done that you would hope that this is what the live action Doctor Strange movie would look like.  This is a very under-rated animated feature.

Edit:  Revised review nine years after first viewing and recent rewatching:

This is the the very under-rated Doctor Strange animated movie from nine years ago.  Roughly the same plot as the live action movie but it goes into detail about why Doctor Strange wanted to be a Doctor, left The Ancient One in tact, and does not require Doctor Strange to need a sling Ring to open a portal.  Also, like in the comics, Mordo is the real villain of the origin story.

The Ancient One always knew Doctor Strange was destined to be the next Sorcerer Supreme and never turned him away (just tested him heavily) and it's indicated that Doctor Strange had a predispostion for Magick he just never knew about. He is able to see through a Glamour spell he was not supposed to, before even damaging his hands.

If you like the live action Doctor Strange I urge you to check out this sorely under-rated animated film. (Note: do not confuse this with the Doctor Strange knock off movie of the early 90s or the 1970s Doctor strange live action movie).

 Also if you ever played Avengers Alliance (The Facebook game) you will find they stole / sampled some of their music from this movie.

The animation is gorgeous and surpasses some Disney cell animation. Also some flashbacks give Strange more depth.  It's as beautiful as an animated Disney feature and is sorely underated.

Seriously, this is a beautiful movie.  Dont consider it as competition for the movie but a companion piece for it.  If you liked Doctor Strange I urge you to watch this slightly more comic book accurate version that has fallen into semi-obscurity.  Its surprisingly beautiful.
I highly recommend this film for any Marvel fan or anyone just starting to get into the supernatural aspects of the Marvel universe.",1395100800,14,2352,4.673965936739659

However, there are several elements that were missing from the original comic books which made it less conforming. One, which in my opinion is a bonus in fact, was that Dr. Strange never says, ""by the <fill in the blank>,"" to do an incantation. Another, which is more egregious, is the fact that magic (in the series) has ""flavors,"" good/evil, light/dark, etc. When (spoiler) Dr. Strange defeats Dormamu by taking all its magic, Strange would then be filled with evil magic.

2859105,3,B000R5OFOA,"After about two other failed attempts at getting his own movie(say what you will, but I actually dug Doctor Mordred), Marvel Animation decided to take the ""original Doctor"" and make their fourth film through Lionsgate about him. Unlike the previous animated movies though, this one didn't have any connection to them and was treated as its own story.

Pompous-ass Stephen Strange is one of the leading surgeons in his field, but is only interested in unique cases by wealthy patients. After a mystical vision causes him to crash his car, his hands are crushed, and he can't perform surgery anymore, Strange uses all his funds up scouring the world looking for a way to restore his hands. When he's at the end of his rope, a stranger named Wong appears and tells him to see out the enigmatic Ancient One in Tibet.

Once finally in Tibet, Strange joins in with Wong's crew of sorcerers, which is spearheaded by the agressive Mordu(""Baron Mordu""). Their troops are after the demonic entity Dormammu who was sealed off in another dimension ages ago by the Ancient One. Strange starts his training under them to be a magician, during which he finds his hands are healed. Mordu becomes enraged when he learns that the title of Sorcerer Supreme(their grand poobah), and he strikes a deal with Dormammu to get rid of Strange if he kills the Ancient One for him.

Dormammu is released through the dreams of children in a coma, and destroys the Sanctum Sanctorum which bridges the gap between our world and the demon world. After dying, the Ancient One passes his power on to Strange with his mystical amulet(the Eye Of Agamotto). With his new strength, Strange manages to defeat Mordu, and absorbs all of Dormammu's magic. Strange then remakes the Sanctum with Wong, and begins his new life as the Sorcerer Supreme.

This made for a decent secret origin for Dr. Strange. I think Marvel chose to take a chance on doing an animated movie of him to try and introduce him to a new generation of fans. With magic being a big thing in Hollywood at the time, Dr. Strange was a good attempt, although it's hard to say how non-hardcore comic geeks would accept it. The animation is pretty good, exceptionally better than what was used in the previous Iron Man movie. It's hard to say if this one is a keeper for your video library, but very much worth a rental or borrowing from a friend.",1332460800,,2370,4.662679425837321
2859106,3,B000R5OFOA,"Good, but not real good. Wish it had more extras. Good action, a little more character development would be nice. It starts off like you already know what's going on.",1330300800,,166,4.566666666666666
2859107,4,B000R5OFOA,"Because of the undeserved B level status of this character, I let this movie sit on the dusty shelf of a half off store for about half a year before I shelled out $2.72 to see it. I had already been let down by a couple of Marvel's other outings; Doctor Strange hardly inspires confidence (by modern standards) considering that he hasn't made a recent stab at box office bucks.

However, after being let down by Green Lantern's box office stab and blown away by DC's animated lament to the fans, ""We forgive you and awesome cartoons!,"" I decided to let marvel apologize for never giving Stephen Strange the chance to make sorcery sexy again.

APOLOGY ACCEPTED, MARVEL. I had a lot of fun watching this picture and I went in with pretty low expectation. As the opening scene started, I was already thinking about the deodorant stick or tube of chap stick I could have bought for the money, but then this incredible action started to unfold involving characters that immediately made me interested in them. That's the key, charismatic characters and in this, several characters are never really introduced, but make an impression anyway due to design and you miss them as the body count rises.

Yes, much like the Green Lanterns, these sorcerers enjoy slightly shorter lives than insects and it's understandable. They fight creatures larger than semi trucks and gargantuan floating fire heads. In this, magic spells have to hold and if the monster or whatever you are fighting breaks through, you are right in the way, SQUISH. That reminds me of the lanterns, enemies smash their conjurations all the time.

Stephen Strange is a bit of a Bat Man type (who knew), he's rich, he's distinguished, debonair, but unlike Bruce, he is stuck up and indifferent about the lower classes. He's pretty easy to hate, but even here, he is animated to be so slick and urbane that I at least, just accepted that he is that way. Every insanely rich person can't be expected to be humble and magnanimous. Especially a doctor, they have to actually work their way to riches; no shame on them for unrealistically expecting everyone else to do so. (Yes I'm humanizing a fictional character, let me be!)

Now, onto my dislikes: I don't think we got enough time to see Stephen as his old pre super hero transformation. I was just getting to know him when the crash happens and his character is ""changed"" for the better, but the transformation happened too fast and in flashes of him paying for more elaborate and expensive surgeries; the flashing took away the weight of what was happening: rich doctor , losing it all, walking in the shoes of the...uninsured. ;-)

Also, I always welcome medical + sci fi/fantasy, but recoil when I can't spot anything ""medical"" happening. With more and more descriptive medical dramas on tv, we are becoming more of a medically sensitive audience, maybe we still couldn't graduate medical school, but we know what to ""look"" for in a medical drama. What of the chill inducing reading of the medical report that describes all of the different pins and screws used to hold the patient's bones together (common medical drama fair), and at least I would think that if a doctor's hands were broken, the fingers should shake (the classic surgeon fear) or not be able to close or extend or jerk. Strange's hands never do that in this and the scars that also could have been a disturbing medical element aren't shown except in one or two shots. They should have been there prominent to constantly remind us that this man had been hurt in this way.

He's got broken hands and he still makes a fist when the door man lets him into his apartment straight out of the hospital? I think any skater boy who's ever taken a particularly gnarly spill could tell you that wouldn't fly.

If you were to turn to this half way into it, you'd never know that his hands are hurt because they bend sometimes and tend to make due. I know a few scenes were shown to try and ""remind"" us they don't work, like when he ties brushes to his hands to wash floors, but how did he tie them in the first place? Plus, oh so blatantly, he climbs a cliff face to reach the Temple and he uses the knocker without much problem. If you give a character a medical condition; you gotta respect that condition. Making the character able to use his hands a little, but with constant shaking could have solved the problem of inconsistency and made the character's condition more medically sound.

But besides, little things like that, I adore this. I especially like when Stephen comes into his own and steps out of his chambers drenched in silken garments and looking very...sexy. I look forward to more of that in the second feature, which I hope this gets one. Just one more criticism, the CGI sucked, but sucky cgi is becoming more common place these days, nothing strange about that.",1323907200,,4850,4.649941656942824
2859108,5,B000R5OFOA,"I tend to go for some of the more 2nd tier characters when it comes to Marvel Comics. Like Darkhawk. To this day, I keep hoping for more from that character. Dr. Strange happens to be another of my preferred characters.

This is not a canon story, but rather a envisioned retelling meant to garner new fans. Bryse Johnson does a great job voicing the arrogant Dr. Strange, in every aspect. The plot reveals the motivation to be the very best at what he does, through the loss of family. He's brash, rude, and probably worth a few curse words as well. But when the not so good doctor gets in a hoary wreck and looks to a dull future without the use of his hands.

Kharma, right?

Well, he gets the idea of getting treatment by way of Eastern holistics. But this is only after an intervention of a suicide attempt. It is revealed to him, during the healing process, that he possesses a hidden talent in the sorcerous arts. Another student takes an insult as reason to step in and fill the role of villain. And the rest of the film passes as it would be expected.

This Marvel animated effort is definitely one of the better one, comparing the Iron Man, Black Panther, and Avengers attempts. We won't talk about the Spider-Woman debacle. The plot is polished and focuses on the story through the characters. And we get some awesome introductions. Mordo, Dormammu, the Ancient One. All presented very well. We get a mixed bag of special features: one featurette, a look at the animated Avengers, a bag of trailers, and concept art. The film is in presented widescreen with 5.1 surround.  Typical. But the story alone is more than worth it. It is a solid effort from Marvel. More of these videos and they might come up to the par of DC animated films.",1319846400,,1746,4.477987421383648

2859111,3,B000R5OFOA,"I went into this with low expectations.  Given that Marvel's other films hadn't done well, even with their all-star Avengers cast, I wasn't expecting much from Dr. Strange.  But surprisingly, this was quite enjoyable.

It begins with Dr. Strange as a brilliant yet self-centered surgeon whose interests lie solely in wealth and prestige.  But an encounter with the spiritual realm causes a crippling car accident, leaving Dr. Strange without the intricate use of his hands.  Strange exhausts his fortune seeking reconstruction surgery, but no-one is able to restore his fractured hands.  Years later, poor and destitute, a desperate and near suicidal Strange journeys to Tibet to explore his last hope, ""the Ancient One"".  Dr. Strange seeks the restoration of his hands, but his magical tutors are more interested in the redemption of his soul.  Strange slowly begins to discover the world of magic and learns to become its guardian.  Finally, he and his companions must make a stand against the dark forces seeking to destroy Earth.

I never thought a movie about magic could be this interesting.  I expected some really laborious magical duels that just look like two people doing sign language, but thankfully Dr. Strange delivers both visually and kinetically. The action is beautifully choreographed and emotionally resonant.  The art style is sharp, visually engaging, and memorable.  But the highlight of Dr. Strange is in its characters and storytelling; the journey of a selfish yet resourceful doctor to a humble leader and protector of earth.  Doctor Strange: the Sorcerer Supreme is a memorable and emotionally engrossing film, and one of Marvel's finest.",1278720000,2,1667,5.265151515151516

There was a TV movie made of it that was rather disappointing.

Now, this.  To the younger viewer, probably unaware of the grand tradition of the character, the film is probably okay.  But it does little service to the original.

This is not to say that the film is bad.  It just isn't that good.  The ""real"" Doctor Strange explored the envelope of mystic philosophy in the comic; this version is just confronted with pithy Zenlike slogans.

Particularly in the cartoon medium, it would be possible to extend the visuals to those of the comic books the film is ostensibly derived from.  Yet this was overlooked in favor of a much simpler, action-with-little-thought feature.

It draws perhaps a little too much from Eastern cinema (as well as Western cinema pretending to be Eastern cinema), but it's a good watch and a promising continuation of the new Lionsgate/Marvel animated film series.

The story is surprisingly well crafted, although there are no surprises at all to be found from beginning to end.  The voice acting is competant and doesn't draw attention to itself, and the art style is similar to the previous attempts, most notably the Avengers films released a couple of years ago.  The character and creature design are imaginative and fun to watch.

As with all the Marvel animated films from the last few years, the animation is a little clunky and perhaps too stylised when considering that the bulk of the comics of the last forty years have focused on realistic depictions, with only a few exceptions here and there.  However, the action sequences are wonderfully fluid and dynamic, as well as some of the flashier special effects.  They're not up to Disney standard, just for example, and although it's a lot cleaner around the edges there isn't as much detail as, say, the 1990s ""Spider-Man"" or ""X-Men"" animated series.

Still, it's very much worth a watch, although I probably wouldn't recommend picking it up for more than a fiver.

2859127,2,B000R5OFOA,"Wow, what a mess up!  An animated movie with a reasonable budget about Doctor Strange could be an opportunity to travel into untold worlds and have all kinds of amazing experiences with the Doctor.

But instead we get a badly done 'origins of the character' film that leaves very little to the viewer's imagination AND, WORST OF ALL, becomes a sword-fighting film.

When the first character pulled a sword of out thin air, I thought ""hey, that's cool"".  But when everyone did it, including Doctor Strange, I thought, ""OMG, they never read a single Doctor Strange comic!""

The animation was decent, and the monsters and enemies weren't horrible, but the filmmakers really blew it on STORY and CONCEPT.  What were they thinking?!??!

This could have been a film starting with Dr Strange (already super-powerful) and with maybe a brief flashback entailing how he became the Sorceror Supreme -- but to devote the whole film to a bunch of magical cohorts who die easily (and no viewers care b/c they're not part of the comic anyway) and really miss most of what Doctor Strange was about -- what a waste.

Its like doing the only Superman movie and having 95% be about Krypton and the folks that live there... and then boom, everyone's dead except this one guy who can fly.  The end.

I was suprised to discover from watching the production team interviews that they actually were fans of the original Doctor Strange comics.

But the telling line came from one interviewee who said (I'm paraphrasing), ""We gave them each different abilities, and then from there it was similar to mutants and other superheroes.""  ie you blew it!

Another person also said (paraphrasing), ""We only had a few panels of origin, so we had to make up all this other stuff.""  Take it from a Doctor Strange fan -- I wish you hadn't made up any of that ridiculous non-sensical origin material, and just stuck with the 100+ issues of much more interesting material -- that sticks to the Doctor Strange genre!

This is why the film was a waste -- Doctor Strange is a magician of utmost power and knowledge who can travel all realms of reality to stop evil doers on a grand scale.

He is not a sword fighter, martial artist, or Zen monk.  He has a few very powerful items he uses frequently -- his cloak and necklace -- but he doesn't use a SWORD!!!  Talk about 'missing the point'!

They didn't have ANYONE intone a chant for a spell, didn't have ANYONE explain about magic, and while they did go thru a few world portals, no one really did much in other dimensions.  WHY!?!?!?

Damnit!  C'mon, Marvel -- don't blow it!  With each of these animated flicks, your company has a chance to do something great with your characters, but instead you are going for cheesy poorly written screenplays!

Stay away from 'origin' films.  Have the courage to start your movie with a full-blown superhero, and don't take their powers away.  Don't make them have amnesia.  Don't go back in time or off to another place.  Keep them in their spot, leave them with their powers, and let them do what they do in the comics!  Is it REALLY that hard?!?!?

Hint -- do your film like a comic.  It worked for Sin City, and it can work for you.  Don't do films like films.  We don't need any more 'origin' movies ... at leat not before the 2nd or 3rd movie.  Just give us a flashback scene and explain more later...!

2859132,3,B000R5OFOA,"Dr. Strange is the 4th animated movie from Marvel Lions Gate.  It's not a bad movie.  It's got some decent action, a good plot, and Strange is more than just a one note super hero with a gimmick.  I can't say how closely it follows the original Strange from the comics but as a newcomer to the character, it was a cool portrayal.

The only major downside, is other than Strange, there were no other characters that I could get invested in.  They were all pretty much just there to either motivate Strange in the right direction, or to cause conflict.  The flashbacks were good and helped build Strange's character and motivation.  I thought his transformation from a crippled doctor to a sorcerer was a little rushed but all in all it's better to speed things up than to let them drag.

The features included a look into the history of Strange in the comics with interviews with former writers of the series and the producers of the movie.  There's also a look at the next Marvel animated installment, Avengers Reborn, a teenage team of the Avengers.  It does not look promising.  The movie wasn't bad but I probably wouldn't buy it anytime soon.  Worth checking out if you enjoyed Marvel's previous releases.",1194048000,3,1209,4.624413145539906

 This is a Marvel production, the names on the credits will be familiar to fans old and new, so you know the character and story are in good hands. Of particular fun is the interview with Stan Lee and some views of the old and new Doctor.

This is the 4th Marvel animated film that I've purchased and I believe that they just get better and better.

The first 3 films (Ultimate Avengers, Ultimate Avengers 2 & Iron Man) were all enjoyable, but the impovement from film to film, be it in animation style, dialogue and voice acting, has been steady and greatly appreciated.

These animated features have the ability to reach a younger audience than their celuloid brothers, and yet at no time did I feel that they weren't also reaching out to a discerning adult audience.

There is a lot in this movie that the filmakers, and we old skool Dr. Strange fans, can be proud of. The heritage is alive and well!",1192665600,,682,4.6115702479338845

2859136,5,B000R5OFOA,"The new Marvel animated made for video films have been hit and miss. In watching Dr Strange, they have found a great retelling of the Strange mythos with a modern day twist of the day.

The animation is crisper in color and hue. The storytelling on the Strange film is par to most feature films

For fans of the comic adaventures of Dr Strange will NOT be disappointed. Those new fans will enjoy this production as well.

It comes down to this, IS IT WORTH IT? I say this..it is an amazing production and would hope that those at Lion's Gate and Marvel retell more stories of Dr Strange. If it does not happen, well it is their Loss

Actually, there is only one layer of reality we see.  We see it only as short, non-penetrating glimpes as the heros look into a portal from this side.  They do not go into the other dimension or confront the far from unspeakable evil that sends its mildy imaginitive minions into our reality as forebears of evil in an attempt to gain control of our world.
This is intended as an adult or, at least, mature teenager cartoon.  But, the story and imagery are not as good as one would expect.  I imagined unspeakable horrors, adult animations and multiple dimensions/layers of reality that our heros enter into to do battle.  Even the purveyor of the evil is left far in the background and not confronted.

3 of 5 is a fair rating.  Buy it on standard DVD for far less, or better, rent it first.  Then buy it if you desire.  Its a watch once or twice video.",1191283200,4,1122,4.737113402061856

Was hoping to hear some of the odd, quirky spells, and see some of the fantastic dimensional landscapes as envisioned by Dr. Strange creators Stan Lee & Steve Ditko...instead, we get a poor man's version of Harry Potter (bewildered student in a ""school"" for wizards...been there, done that)...Instead of exciting sorcerer battles, we get sword fights with ""lightsabers"" in an obvious rip-off of Star Wars...

This was a chance to bring a classic, unique Marvel creation to the limelight,  but the producers instead tried to mimic current sci-fi/fantasy trends, and in my opinion, failed miserabley.

You've already seen many elements of this film in OTHER movies, folks, Done better.

Spider-Man: Sins of the Fathers Chapter 1: Dr Strange (1996; season 3 ep 1)

It takes a lot from Batman Begins as we watch Stephen Strange go on a journey from a cold-hearted surgeon to a broken man and finally into a force to be reckoned with. It also takes a little from The Matrix as Dr. Strange is pulled into a world that's invisible to most but is all around us. The animation is really great and you'll recognize some veteran voice actors that really add to the movie. Not being a Dr. Strange fan before, this movie makes me want to follow more of his adventures.",1190246400,3,560,4.242990654205608

2859142,4,B000R5OFOA,"I'm glad that the state of the art has improved so much so that all the Marvel Animated movies are viable.  Having viewed the latest (fourth) in the series, ""Doctor Strange"" I can say it is the best looking of the bunch so far.  The script and story are nicely done too - a straight but completely modernized version of the origin of Doctor Strange.

The movie is quite short, so there is not much sense in giving away any of the details.  The modernizations are completely true to the characters and there are numerous small things and tiny details that long time fans will see and hear and will appreciate but don't distract the uninitiated.

With 40 plus years of character development available, it's refreshing to see this kind of update which is really a simplification and optimization of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original work.  The writer did a great job distilling so much into this package and made the origin tale interesting instead of just a setup for the main story.  It's a shame Steve Ditko was not credited on-screen as he is in the Spider-Man features.  He deserved a lot of credit for Doctor Strange - his images and art that were the signature of the comic book influenced so much of how we now expect the world of magic to appear in movies and tv today.  Only a few panels were devoted to the origin story in the comics, but the slight to Ditko is unforgivable.  He is mentioned in the special features by Stan Lee and several other comic book writers -- they know.  Of course they know.

This is my very first Blu-Ray disc and the images and sound produced here are truly incredible.  The movie is in 1080p/24fps and this appears to take a lot of processing power to display.  My Sony BDP-S300 displayed a ""loading"" screen for a few minutes and then another loading screen with animated gears for a few minutes before the top menu even appeared.  The disc has HD 7.1 sound - so if you have the sound system and a 1080p capable set, this is about as good a demo disc as there is.

This disc is a definite buy for your collection.  Very interesting.  With all this technology and all these great characters many more great movies can be made.  But please get the script thoroughly polished and make good stories for these marvel features.  The opportunity to create something truly lasting completely depends on the script and story.  This disc is perhaps not in that category, but I can clearly see the potential for greatness that exists in these properties if enough care an attention is put into them.

And please credit the original creators.  Whatever royalty you might have to pay them is worth it.  Legalities aside they must be given credit where due and it is richly due to them here.",1190073600,4,2717,4.520491803278689
2859143,4,B000R5OFOA,"The video was dark and the action tight. Going into this film I had no fore knowledge of the Dr. Strange character or comic but I was still able to really enjoy the story and didn't leave the film feeling like I was left out, yet I could tell that there was some things put in certain places that were for the comic fans too. This amazing balance is a hard one to reach and I applaud them for obtaining it.

The tale opens with an intense chase scene with the pupils of the Ancient One pursuing a servant of Dormammu. This chase passes by the car of the gifted and selfish Dr. Strange. The tale continues and Dr. Strange is struck with a tragedy that sets him on a path to recover his life. During the quest he is led to the training temple of the Ancient One and receives healing and instruction while there.

One of the qualities that I really enjoyed in this tale was the clear development of the character of Dr. Strange. In the beginning he is a selfish, self-obsessed, cruel, haunted man. They did a great job of creating a feeling of disgust and pity over his character in the start of the film, I found my self caring about the character because I knew something obviously led him to be the creep that was before me and yet he was still a creep that could just walk away from the woman's suffering. Then as the tale goes on we learn about what happened to him that hardened his heart and we watch Dr. Strange forgive himself and grow into a wonderful person. It was quite a delightful experience that gave so much depth to the story.

The setting and animation was wonderful and crisp. The movement was fluid and action dynamic. One aspect of the setting that I really enjoyed was how the creators limited the abilities of the magic users. Everyone learned how to manipulate their environment by realizing the oneness of it all but each person was limited to their own innate abilities. This way each character had both power and limitation, they did a great job of showing both. This helped to give great tension as you watch the characters being powerful and when they were faced with their limitations their downfall as well.",1190073600,3,2136,4.416243654822335
2859144,4,B000R5OFOA,"I wasn't sure what to expect. I know about Dr. Strange, but I was never ""into"" Dr Strange. I felt the movie was well paced, well written, and well performed.

I feel that these sort of comic based movie stories are all too formulaic, and Dr. Strange was; however, it was still plenty entertaining. I think it could have use a bit more intensity in it's action, and charactor interactions; it's a subdued movie much of the time. I expected more of an ending as well, but again this was solid.

I don't think this was on par with Ultimate Avengers, my favorite newer Marvel DTV so far. I feel this was more like Invincible Iron Man. So if you like Iron Man, you will probably like Dr. Strange. In my opinion.",1189555200,3,706,4.340909090909091
2859145,3,B000R5OFOA,"Like Iron Man, I thought this was done really well. The animation and back story along with the acting was very good. I just question Marvels choice of doing a Dr. Strange animated movie. I am not complaing, I like that they didn't go with the standard X-Men or other really popular characters but it seems like a 'Strange' choice. But Marvel also did a made for TV movie back in the late 70's early 80's of Strange too. So they might be trying to get an old favorite character over with some new fans.

Its a good movie and a good story. I recommend it.",1189382400,,554,4.226415094339623
2859146,5,B000R5OFOA,"Marvel does it again!  This movie pays tribute to the character by going more in-depth into the characters personal life, which reflected on the choices he made.  It touches on how tragedy can emotional blind a person from seeing what is really inside.  It also shows how people can put up walls believing they are protected themselves, but in truth can be holding themselves back from something greater.  Well done.",1189036800,2,416,4.9
2859147,4,B000R5OFOA,"Doctor Strange, the fourth Marvel animated feature distributed by Lion's Gate, is a pure treat.  Re-telling the origin of Marvel's sorcerer supreme, Doctor Strange follows the wealthy and full of himself doctor and surgeon Stephen Strange, as he bears witness to a supernatural event before an accident robs him of his greatest tools: his hands.  Soon enough, Strange learns he has a destiny, which leads him to Tibet and coming under the teachings of the Ancient One, who foretells of a powerful and ancient evil callded Dorramu, which is preparing to rear it's ugly head.  Though there are a few more modern twists (a car accident robs Strange of the use of his hands here, his faithful assistant Wong is much less ethnic), this animated origin story is plenty entertaining.  The animation and voice acting are top notch, and the Doctor Strange mythology of the classic Marvel comics is put to good use as well.  Though like the other Marvel animated features, Doctor Strange is an acquired taste, but for those who have so far enjoyed the Ultimate Avengers and Iron Man DVD's, Doctor Strange is more than well worth a visit.",1188864000,10,1127,4.848958333333333
2859148,4,B000R5OFOA,"Admittedly I'm not a long-time follower of Dr Strange, and I nod with respect to those who can comment more authoritatively about the accuracy of the adaptation. Nonetheless, I am pleased and impressed with the talent and creativity that goes into these Marvel Ani-movies. The comics corporations just do tooo much foot-dragging in adapting their properties to the big or small screen, denying fans the fun and excitement of seeing their favorites spring off the comic page. I've enjoyed the Avengers 1 & 2, and Iron Man, and really wonder what's going to happen with the upcoming future Avengers tale. It's just fun seeing these characters being treated in a polished and respectful manner, and I really wish DC comics would get on the animated movie bandwagon. One thing I don't get is why they don't get these a short run in theaters before going to DVD. Glen Larson did this with the pilot for the original Battlestar Galactica, and cheesy though it was (by today's standards especially), it was still great to see it on the ""big screen.""

But, the lesson learned is still valuable despite the overall mediocre plot and story. I do actually want to see a sequal to see how the plot will continue.

2859152,5,B000R5OFOA,"As a kid, I loved Doctor Strange. It was my all time favorite comic book. During the late 60s and early 70s I would head down to the Loch Ridge Pharmacy with my fifty cents, get a Doctor Strange comic and Milk Duds, and still have two dimes left for my piggy bank. Under the magical spell of a quick sugar rush, Stephen Strange would take me on a journey where ancient mysticism, powerful spells and the All Seeing Eye of Agamotto would be the only weapons to save the world from extra-dimensional mystic entities like the malevolent Mephisto or the dreaded Dormammu. Forget Spiderman and his doting Aunt May. Don't bother me with Bruce Wayne and Bat Caves. Doctor Strange was the best, Jerry. THE BEST!

The 80s came and so did puberty. The Dodgers, Playmates of the Month and Chevies became more wonderous than a comic book wizard. Such is life. Doctor Strange faded in my memory but, as I later discovered, never really died.

Almost thirty years later I'm walking through Target with my little boy. For some unknown, almost mystical reason I stop at an end-cap full of DVDs. The title, ""Doctor Strange,"" and the familiar image of my childhood hero transports me back to 1969. I quickly nab the DVD from the shelf and joyfully regale my son with memories of the good Doctor. His eyes light up as I explain the hero. ""You got to buy it, Daddy!"" he exclaims.

That afternoon, with some take-out pizza, my little boy and I sat back on the couch and had a great time watching this DVD. The good folks at Marvel didn't let me down. The story and animated images were almost perfect. Me and, more importantly, my son loved it. We watched it twice.
