8376603,4,B002P31SL0,"the sales portion was very interesting, especially the amount of smoking that was shown. I had hoped for a little more footage showing the steam era, but I guess that the Santa Fe really never focused on documenting the steam era as much as the other railroads did. Otherwise the video was great",1504569600,,295,4.584905660377358
8376604,5,B002P31SL0,"Wonderful historic motion pictures with sound of Santa Fe trains on Cajon, Raton, and Edelstein Hill.  Many of the clips are in color.  Unique video of a train coming through Big Cut around 1950 with brake smoke.",1497571200,,212,4.702702702702703
