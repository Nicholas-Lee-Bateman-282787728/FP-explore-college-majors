5114366,1,B007Y6CTBG,I usually really like Morgan Spurlock films.  This one however needs to have every copy collected up and burned to save his reputation.  The characters that are examined are extremes and all too often total wierdos.  Why do I want to sit and watch a man who loves his beard more than mankind tell his self righteous story for 27 min?  Then you have the extreme Middle Eastern metro sexual.  It just gets too odd for me.  My advice is to forget you ever even heard of this piece.,1346803200,,478,4.314606741573034
5114367,2,B007Y6CTBG,"I feel like this film's trailer misrepresents the content of the film.  This film ""stars"" Jason Bateman and Will Arnett, but they've got very little face-time, and most of their scenes appear in the trailer itself.  Morgan Spurlock has more face-time, like the trailer suggests... but only in the first 30 minutes of the film.  Overall, it wasn't a terrible movie, but I do feel like it could (and should) have been compressed down to 35-45 minutes instead of clocking in at 83 minutes.  There were interesting segments, but our interest in most of them tapered out after 5-10 minutes (and the segments would go on for 15-20).",1344556800,2,626,4.768518518518518
5114368,1,B007Y6CTBG,"Love body hair and facial hair and watching hairy men who take their hair very seriously?  Then, you'll love this movie.  The trailer is the best part of the film and does a great job of highlighting the only seconds worth watching.  This movie is mostly about facial and body hair.  Peppered in are some of my favorite entertaining individuals with random commentary, clearly those unfocused moments do not carry this scattered film.  It is not about men in the 21st century, it is not about metrosexuality, it's not about anything really except for some chumps with body hair, one without, and few random stories about them.",1343088000,12,626,4.813084112149533

5114370,1,B007Y6CTBG,"1st - I'm a 66 yr old female who's waded thru more males in my lifetime than I could even begin to count.  Not sure if the guy w/the long-long-long beard was more repulsive than the ""Fresh Balls"" salesman.  Take it back - the whole idea of men needed a substance to freshen their balls grosses me out more than anything I've ever heard in decades.  Sorry, but real guys just shift their ""manly"" parts quickly by hand.

The narcissistic gentleman - so deathly tramatized by his teenage appearance...he needs to have his eyebrows professionally done & wears make-up?  A man who wears make-up freaks me out.  Ick, ick, ick...I rarely wore make-up & had to beat the guys off w/a stick.

If this is how men groom themselves now - thank God I don't date much anymore...

p.s.  Saw Ed McMann (Johnny's sidekick) on the street in NYC. Impeccable from head to toe, but he was a big TV star.

Also funny are the interviews of Paul Rudd or Zach Galifianakis. I think the best thing of the film is the Spa day of Jason Bateman and Will Arnett, one of the most funniest scenes.

5114376,2,B007Y6CTBG,It was mostly about hair. Shaving and grooming manhair. It mentioned this in the preview but did not say the whole movie would be about hair. They spent at least 20 minutes on the beard competitor and the mustashe deal just was too long. I thought it would be funny but have some good aspects about manhood for a class I teach on gender. Not so much. I'm sad I wasted the $$ on buying. I should have rented it first buy the proce to rent was 1/3 to buy so I took the chance. Bad call.,1365206400,2,484,4.0
5114377,3,B007Y6CTBG,"Not Spurlock's best work.  If you want an actual engagement offering perspective upon masculinity and maleness, the existential condition of the western man at the dawn of the 21st century or whateverhaveyou, this is not your film.  It's really just a series of somewhat superficial vignettes concerning facial and body hair, and personal grooming.  These are interspersed with that sort of spritely wry running ad-libbed commentary you'd expect from Jud Aptow's stable of comedic talent - Aptow himself, Rudd, Galifianakis, Bateman, and company - and this comedic horseplay is really the only reason to see this film. I enjoyed it, but it's thin gruel given what Spurlock could have done with the subject. I was hoping for something like what Chris Rock did with Afro-American hair culture in ""Good Hair"" - that film is excellent, really fascinating. This by comparison is mediocre, frankly quite disappointing. There's really no especial insight into gender, sexuality or culture here at all, which is what I expected and had hoped would be forthcoming. I've thought some of Spurlock's earlier stuff like ""Super Size Me"" and ""The Greatest Movie Ever Sold"" to be rather insightful, if gimmicky. This is neither clever in that trademark gimmicky sense, nor especially educational.  Still, if Rudd, Galifiankis, Bateman and that crew goofing off for the camera sounds like fun, you might still enjoy this.

[Additional thought, 4/5/13]

I've been mulling this film since last night, and it seems to me that this is the least personal effort that I've seen Spurlock make. I've seen quite a bit of his stuff, and he almost always is the pivotal character in his productions, being the sort of everyman narrator and gentle inquisitor who puts himself into an interesting situation (for 30 days typically, that's his schtick) and lets the story happen to him. Here, he appears only briefly, where he shaves off his iconic mustache to raise money for ""Movember"" prostate cancer research. He isn't even clearly the interviewer in most of the rest of the film. It's like he just stuck a bunch of his new found celebrity friends in front of the camera and then shot a bunch of footage about guys growing and trimming facial hair. I'm thinking this is its own slovenly commentary on what's become masculinity in this culture. You get a bunch of adolescent-retarded celebrities whose personas have been frozen since sophomore year college when they did this same comic schtick for their friends at their frat parties, and then a film about the one non-controversial thing about maleness left a college educated post-feminist guy in this culture: growing hair on his body and face while losing it on his head.  It's come to the point that the only way guys can assert their maleness without causing waves these days is through grooming their hair. It's the one gender distinctive that a guy like Spurlock can vigorously assert without pissing his hip vegan wife off.

I'm not saying I'm much different than Spurlock, here. I'm not Robert Bly, and I don't have a chip on my shoulder about gender, or a coherent theory of gender myself. But I know this: a film about gender these days that is any good would be offensive to many people and would be compelling.  It would be deeply reactive, and this piece is not. We've gone from Don Draper and Sinatra to ""Sex in the City"" and ""Girls"" in two generations. What the heck has just happened?  That's an intense and vertigo inducing shift there, and nobody's got anything interesting to say about it?  All we can do is dish anodyne nonsense like this about it? Words like feminist, androgyny, misanthropy, misandry, eros and do not occur in this film.  How come?  Come on. Spurlock is okay when he is goring oxen acceptable to his cultural class. George Bush and corporations can be safely mocked and dissected.  But when he crosses into territory where the truth might lead him to examine and say things that might upset his groovy Brooklynite friends he pulls all his punches and becomes insipid and lazy. Poor show.  Too bad.",1365033600,6,4060,4.8979591836734695
5114378,5,B007Y6CTBG,"Great movie.  The funniest part was about Fresh Balls.  I tried the product and it is awesome.

I would tell everyone to watch the movie and try Fresh Balls.",1361145600,3,157,4.344827586206897
5114379,2,B007Y6CTBG,"After watching the trailer and reading the summary I expected this film to be a funny take on how men have evolved into a softer version of their former tough-guy selves. But in the end the entire movie is really focussed on body hair, male body hair to be specific. An hour and 23 minutes of body hair. So, my recommendation would be... If you are really into the male body hair debate, you will like this movie. Otherwise, it's not all that funny and collectively pretty boring.",1360800000,3,480,4.465909090909091
5114380,3,B007Y6CTBG,"As I was searching movies the 2012 documentary MANSOME came to my attention.  I was on the fence until I noticed it was a Morgan Spurlock film.  A fan of Spurlock's features SUPER SIZE ME, WHERE IN THE WORLD IS OSAMA BIN LADEN?, and THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER SOLD, as well as the one episode of his television program THIRTY DAYS I managed to see, I selected MANSOME.

Even though MANSOME held my attention, when the film ended I thought I didn't like it.  I realize I felt let down because I was looking for something as engrossing as, say, that episode of THIRTY DAYS where Spurlock tries to live on a salary of minimum wage for a month.  Instead, I should have appreciated MANSOME for being MANSOME, an offbeat look at the trend in appearance-centered men.

Also, it could be that MANSOME made me and other reviewers (most of the 14 preceding me do not like the film) uneasy, showing us men putting as much effort into their looks as women do.  The film's most memorable segment covers beard competition champion Jack Passion, and while a facial hair contest is not to a woman's beauty pageant what male go-go dancers are to female dancers, nonetheless I think the concept of a man using his appearance to further himself could reveal your prejudice.  If that doesn't, then MANSOME's look at grooming-fixated Ricky Manchanda, who cares about more than just his whiskers, could.",1359072000,,1378,4.6652892561983474
5114381,1,B007Y6CTBG,"WARNING WATCH AT YOUR OWN RISK OF LOSING 2 HOURS OF YOUR LIFE.

If you've ever watched a movie where you felt you wanted your time back then you will know the feeling of watching this movie.

The thing is it NEVER really looks into what being a man is seriously.  It's all random entertainment and side stories like about a guy who does beard competitions, which was lame as hell.  The only thing this movie does is make men want to pamper themselves more like a gay, which IS NOT and will NEVER be what being a man is about because being a man is about having purpose, drive, and building the ability to create in that purpose.  NOT pampering yourself like a woman.  This side of being a man is never looked at in the movie though it is the evolutionary FACT.  In general if you're a gay or metrosexual you will like this film because it teaches you how to be more SUPERFICIAL and materialistic.  While the REAL men and people who aren't as concerned with their looks and other peoples' looks will waste their time with this movie as they know life is fleeting and there are people suffering medical conditions like cancer, people dying in other countries, and wars being fought.  Thus it is on the individual to do something with their life that helps themselves and others more than continually trying to maintain their physicalimage.

BUT if you want to continue to build up a superficial, materialistic culture of random entertainment watch this silly random entertainment movie.",1358812800,,1484,4.608365019011407
5114382,1,B007Y6CTBG,"I've really been looking for a good DVD (for my gender driven 102 research class) which discusses the way in which our society views men, the characteristics society ascribes to men, and the implications of these rigid societal standards. Unfortunately, there are very few documentaries or even books that focus the way in which society views and treats the male. Because of this I generally end up with a more female focused class wherein I try to show my male students (who generally don't like this topic, probably because it's difficult to relate to) that in defining the female, in ascribing to her specific characteristics and standards society necessarily defines the male (and their characteristics and standards) as the opposite. For the most part my students do come to understand this, BUT it would be really, really great to have some of the hundreds of documentaries produced on gender focused on the male.

SO...I was really stoked to see this DVD appear on the market. And then I watched it. Really? This is the best that can be done? This is horrible. In fact, I actually believe it reinforces common stereotypes instead of dispelling them (with regards to both the male and the female). It's focused on hair (body hair, facial hair, shaving, waxing,...etc.). I don't inherently have a problem with the focus, but it was pushed way too far...the talking points got stale and absurd quickly. I mean, how long can you talk about a beard? Apparently, pretty long; you can even extend the beard conversation by talking about competitive beard growing as a sport (no, seriously). Come on! My students aren't going to be able to relate to that kind of thing.

Another thing that really irritates the beejeezus out of me is the criticism of both genders in the film. For example, in the mustache segment Bateman asks Arnett if he ever dated a girl with facial hair (of course, his question is tinged with distaste) and when Arnett responds that he has, we are rewarded with our Ew[...] The majority of women have facial hair, period. It's a fact. Why? Why even address women in this documentary? And if you are, shouldn't you be preaching acceptance? Stupid. Then, we get a parade of women prancing across the screen talking about how they hate male back hair. Seriously, couldn't you find a better source for your claim that it's the societal standard for men to be manscaped than women of the street! Female driven documentaries DON'T pull men in off the street for their opinions and then call them fact; they rely on advertisements, television, statistics...etc. Surprisingly, this film had none of those things to support the women's claims. Oh, and I LOVE the whole waxing segment when the men gripe about how waxing is essentially stealing their manhood. Come on! Really!? How about the Brazilian? Women have been flocking to waxing and doing it in droves for years now. How about giving some statistics on how the number of males waxing has increased and why it is harmful and acknowledging the societal pressure to wax on BOTH genders and then preaching acceptance.

I could keep complaining about how awful this documentary is, but I won't. I will provide you with my favorite quote from the movie (although how I actually chose just ONE, I have no idea):

""The feminist movement put men in a situation where they don't know where they belong anymore.""

Clearly, we're dealing with the apex of intelligence here. Obviously, I won't be showing this to my 102 kids and it's a real shame because it's a wasted opportunity. What a trite piece of garbage.",1357603200,3,3569,4.82516339869281

The majority of this film was having random people, mostly emotionally immature men who have quasi-celebrity status give their ""expert"" (non-expert) opinion on what you should do to be ""manly"" in the realm of body grooming. Then he threw in a few others, shown as the anomolies, like the dude with the 2' long beard, the pro wrestler who shaves every part of his body before an event, and the guy who obsessively gets manicures and facial hair removal procedures. There's such a broader depth of discussion that could be had about the various views on male self-expression.
