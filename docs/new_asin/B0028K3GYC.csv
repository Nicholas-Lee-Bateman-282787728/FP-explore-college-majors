8356350,1,B0028K3GYC,It's not in English and the sub titles don't really make sense. It is like trying to have a 6 year old explain suicide. There isn't any depth or understanding the topic. This is possibly because of information being lost in translation. Amazon is doing people of by not making it clear it only had English subtitles. I would not have rented it if I knew that.,1481932800,,359,4.373134328358209
8356351,1,B0028K3GYC,"There was nothing in the description to warn that this is a hodgepodge of interviews with people speaking Russian or something close. The subtitles don't make much sense, as if the translator doesn't have a good grasp of English. If you understand one of the Slovak languages, you may get more from this than I did. After 15 minutes, I was done.",1364428800,,345,4.580645161290323
8356352,2,B0028K3GYC,This video looks like it could excellent but it is in Bulgarian with only subtitles.  I am dyslexic and reading subtitles is laborious and distracting.  I wanted to show this to my Grief and Loss class but I cannot expect them to read subtitles for an hour.  English voice-over would make it so much better.,1362873600,,307,4.545454545454546
