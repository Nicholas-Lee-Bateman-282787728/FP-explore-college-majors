1206916,1,B00000F2S2,"I couldn't understand how I'd never seen it before.  I love Charlie Chan films, I love Peter Ustinov.  I love silly all-star casts (Death on the Nile is one of my favorites.).  How could I fail to love this film?  Well, it was just awful.  Ustinov is okay, though the voice he chooses for Chan is actually kind of annoying.  The real problem isn't anybody's performance, it's the script.  Chan's son is a bumbling idiot far surpassing any of the clownishness of the older films. He's also half Jewish and played by Richard Hatch who, diplomatically, is neither Asian nor Jewish.  Let's not get into the white Ustinov playing Chan.  It just shows how much had not changed in the years since the originals.  It isn't funny, it isn't warm--as many of the older films were--it isn't clever.  It is overplayed, but not camp.  It is slapstick, but not surprising.  It just fails miserably.  Then, to add insult to injury, in one of the special features, Richard Hatch, whose career has really soared since then, let me tell you, drones on and on about how athletic he is and how he did most of his own stunts and how he impressed the casting people.  I have a bone to pick with many special features added on to movies that don't even deserve release on DVD, much less eulogies presenting them as if they actually were good or significant films.  This disc is the epitome of that kind of overblown nonsense.  The short about American Cinema is okay, if you really believe that a studio that produced Chuck Norris movies is worth eulogizing, as well.  This DVD does nothing but glorify junk.",1123718400,30,1584,4.576512455516014
1206917,5,B00000F2S2,"I don't know what the previous reviewer was on when he critiqued this film, but it must have been powerful stuff!  CHARLIE CHAN & THE CURSE OF THE DRAGON QUEEN is remembered as the last truly great CHAN film, with Ustinov effortlessly effective in his commanding performance as the Asian Sherlock Holmes.

1206993,3,B00000F2S2,"Great cast playing a host of zany characters, but I think it was supposed to be a comedy.  It wasn't.  Perhaps the writers thought that frenzied slapstick was enough to make it so, but somehow, with nothing better to do, it just dragged on from one uninspired prattfall to the next.  The only rolling-on-the-floor laugh in the whole movie comes when a trained attack dog is tricked into blowing out a candle.  It was so stupid it was hilarious, but it wasn't enough to save what is essentially a turkey.  Too bad, too, because the cast of crazies offered something to work with (although Brian Keith's apoplectic cop could have stayed home).  Best one word description I can come up with is ""insipid.""  Or maybe it was just me.",1467763200,,727,4.589147286821706
1206994,2,B00000F2S2,"The best that can probably be said about this 1981 attempt to do a Charlie Chan comedy is that it's actually a lot better than Peter Seller's Dr Fu Manchu parody from the year earlier.  Unfortunately, this hodgepodge of Mel Brooks style parody, Blake Edwards style slapstick and Neil Simon's  Murder By Death is long on silly but very short on actual laughs.

The story concerns a bizarre killer who is baffling police, forcing them to call Charlie Chan (Peter Ustinov in a somewhat condescending performance) out of retirement to help solve it.  His half Jewish half Chinese grandson Lee Chan, Jr (Richard Hatch, game but not a talented comic actor) wants to follow in his grandfather's footsteps but is a clumsy doofus who creates havoc wherever he treads.  A couple of the chain reaction slapstick gags involving Hatch are elaborate enough that you have to give the filmmakers some credit for at least trying.

A very young Michelle Pfeiffer is cute as a button but largely wasted as a ditsy blonde who is engaged to Lee Chan, Jr--she amazingly manages to emerge from this mess with her dignity completely intact.  The same can't be said for the normally reliable Brian Keith who overacts strenuously trying to wring some laughs from the weak material.  Roddy McDowell doesn't fare much better as the sinister butler who is confined to a wheelchair (or is he?).  Angie Dickinson is miscast as the sinister Dragon Queen (Is she supposed to be Chinese?) who may be behind the murders in revenge for Chan catching her years earlier for the murder of  Lee Chan Jr's grandfather.  Although Chan himself says the most obvious suspect can usually be ruled out, so more astute viewers will likely consider her a red herring.

The lack of laughs makes this impossible to recommend, but considering the way cultural sensitivities are these days (celebrated filmmaker Steven Soderbergh wanted very much to do a Charlie Chan movie but backlash forced him to abandon the project) Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen might well turn out to be the last Charlie Chan film ever made, so if you are a fan of the character from his B-movie days this might be worth a look.  It certainly works up to a point as a Charlie Chan film--unfunny gags aside the plotting isn't terrible and the identity of the murderer not especially obvious.  There is at least an attempt to provide clues and give Charlie Chan an actual mystery to solve.

It's very likely that Peter Ustinov's performance was informed by the broadness all around him--he does an adequate job as the famous detective but not much better.  The rest of the cast (except for Michelle Pfeiffer) seems to be straining really hard for laughs that just aren't there.  If you are a fan of the old Charlie Chan films this might be a decent time-waster, but everyone else should probably stay away.",1463011200,,2843,4.757637474541752

But this doesn't seem to know which comedy format to follow, so the directors/writers threw it all in. And it is painful to watch. Maybe toddlers would enjoy it. In a way I found it insulting to all the previous Chan movies, even though I do like almost all the old films with Roddy McDowall and Peter Ustinov.

1207065,2,B00000F2S2,"Let me begin by saying I love spoofs. I grew up (if that's the right word) on MAD Magazine and parodies of movies used to be a staple of that magazine. I love silliness. And I love Charlie Chan movies. However, I don't love this. I wanted to. . .really I did. Unfortunately, aside from having a script that just isn't very funny, the leads - i.e., Peter Ustinov, Richard Hatch, Angie Dickinson and Brian Keith - are dreadful (Hatch less dreadful than the others). Some of the supporting players are good. Lee Grant, Rachel Roberts and especially Roddy McDowall are lots of fun. So is Michelle Pfeiffer at her bubble-headed best. But beyond that there's not a lot going for this movie. On top of that, the video quality is absolutely dreadful, like a much-used VHS that was recorded onto DVD with no enhancing whatsoever. All in all, very disappointing. I would love to see a really well-made Chan parody. But the times, they have a-changed and I don't think anyone bothers with parodies anymore. Too bad.

But, I watched it a lot a lot as a kid, and loved the Charlie Chan movies.  So, I took it as a silly homage, with a great cast, and loved it any way.

1207095,1,B00000F2S2,"As we all know, the best movie ever made is Road House with Patrick Swayze and Cool as Ice with Vanilla Ice is a distant second.  But, this review is not about these two outstanding achievements in cinematic perfection; rather, it is about the worst movie ever - Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen.  How can a movie packed with household name stars including a few with English nobility titles, crash and burn before the beginning credits finish running?

The movie lacks all the wit and wisdom of the 1930s - 1940s era films.  The slapstick is slapstuck and wouldn't even make past ABC's liberal comedy standards.  I wanted to laugh, really I did, but I just couldn't do it.  The movie just sucks.  I have never walked out of a movie that was in my DVD player, until now.  Literally, I got up, walked out of the room, left the house, got in the car, drove until I ran out of gas and checked into a no questions asked motel under an assumed name.  I didn't bring my cell phone or tell my wife where I was going for fear she would tell me about the film or make me listen to it through the speaker phone.  In other words, even if you are a bad cinema fan (Something Weird Video, Crown International releases, MST3K etc.) the film has nothing of interest.  Like skidmarks, it is a stain on the Charlie Chan franchise.

So, instead of wasting your time with this movie, ""Ditch the zero, and get with a hero.""  Re-watch Road House or buy the new release of Cool as Ice.",1313971200,,1477,4.307971014492754

1207188,1,B00000F2S2,"The film opens in Hawaii. Charlie Chan is there to investigate a ""suicide"", and solves the murder. Now a newspaper tells of a crime. The scenes tell this is a comedy. How well will it age? The story of a man ""baked to death"" sets the tone for this comedy. [I didn't find it funny, did you?] Lee Chan has a talent for making life interesting. There is another killing in an acupuncture clinic. It is played for laughs. Charlie Chan makes his comments. The ""fork in the teacup"" clue is explained. There is a new mystery when the elevator door opens. Does this apple fall far from the tree? [Did a stunt double run up those stairs for Charlie?]

A book of matches provides a clue. More scenes follow. Remember Disco? Did it survive this film? ""Where did the suspects go?"" Were white suits in style then? There is a chase like in the horse and buggy days. This pads out the film and provides action. ""She got away."" Will the Dragon Queen interrupt the wedding? Is there a market for those old ""Charlie Chan"" films at a theatre? Can Lee and Cordelia sing ""Happy Birthday""? Is the killer someone in the room? Yes, but its not obvious, or credible. Will the Pineapple Queen be canned? Will you regret watching this film?

The ""Charlie Chan"" series lasted about 16 years. Their quality depended on a budget that kept declining. The films are available on DVD today. Earl Derr Biggers invented the ""Charlie Chan"" character from a famous Honolulu detective. He also wrote other novels. ""Charlie Chan"" in the novels did not have a mustache and goatee; that was invented by Werner Oland.",1231459200,,1575,4.561837455830389
1207189,1,B00000F2S2,The one or two funny lines were not enough to justify the length of this awful movie.  I couldn't even watch it to the end.,1212105600,,123,3.92
1207190,3,B00000F2S2,"Surprisingly funny screwball comedy that mixes ""What's Up, Doc?"" (1971) with ""What's Up, Tiger Lily?"" (1966). Many of the funniest slapstick scenes are reminiscent of ""What's Up, Doc?"" such as tumbling garbage cans, oblivious street crossings leading to big crashes, and even a plate glass delivery truck lasting through many close calls prior to getting destroyed.  Like ""What's Up, Doc?"", there is also a guy hanging onto a banner which rips slowly down across the street.  Unlike ""What's Up, Doc?"", he does not crash into the plate glass truck.  Too bad, as that's one of the funniest scenes in the earlier movie.  There are plenty of chase scenes that take advantage of the San Francisco hills and backgrounds.

The movie has about as much to do with other Charlie Chan movies as an egg salad recipe has to do with the original Japanese thriller in ""What's Up, Tiger Lily?"".  The faked Chinese accents make it look like the actors are dubbing themselves, which adds to the humor of the movie.

Ustinov himself is actually much funnier in his Poirot mysteries.  He did not deliver the famous Chan aphorisms as well as I think he could have.  Lets not even talk about his debut operetta during the opening titles.  All in all, though, definitely worth watching more than once.",1173916800,2,1278,4.821100917431193
1207191,3,B00000F2S2,"This is a spoof on the more traditional Charlie Chan movies.  As spoof's go, it is pretty unoriginal.",1162684800,4,101,4.611111111111111
1207192,3,B00000F2S2,"During the 1930s Charlie Chan films were extremely popular with Asian American audiences; by the 1980s a later generation derrided them for their use of caucasian actors Warner Oland and Sidney Tolar in the title role.  CHARLIE CHAN AND THE CURSE OF THE DRAGON QUEEN attempts to play to both sides of the coin, acting as both homage and parody of the original films.  Not surprisingly, when released in 1981 it pleased neither.

Set in San Francisco, DRAGON QUEEN finds Chan called out of retirement in Hawaii to uncover a serial killer whose trademark is ""bizarre deaths;"" he is assisted by his grandson, a bumbling Lee Chan Jr. who proves as much hinderance as help.  Like most films that do not fulfill their promise, the problem begins with the script: it never really references the Chan films in any significant way, nor does it ever develop the fangs required of an effective parody.  Nor are the two leads well suited to their roles: both Peter Ustinov and Angie Dickinson are wildly out of place as Chan and the Dragon Queen, utterly unfunny in every imaginable way.

The saving grace of the film is in the supporting players.  Perhaps the single most successful performer is Lee Grant in the role of Jimmy Jr.'s maternal and very Jewish grandmother.  Grant aside, the always memorable Roddy McDowell and the brilliant Rachel Roberts jolt their every scene to life; Brian Keith plays against type as a hysterical and wildly profane police officer; and Richard Hatch is surprisingly good as Chan's bumbling grandson.  Michelle Pfeiffer, in one of her earliest roles, is thrown in for good measure--and while the script gives her little to do beyond look pretty and giggle she does both extremely well.

Even so, this is not enough to save the film, which slowly but surely dissolves into a morass of very obvious slapstick humor; when all is said and done, the end result is rather like THE GOOD EARTH MEETS THE PINK PANTHER.  It has moments, but it is more awkward than amusing.  The DVD includes two bonus shorts, a ""Making Of"" documentary on the film and a ""History Of"" American Studios.  Both are mildly interesting, but I wouldn't go out of my way.  Three stars for the efforts of Lee Grant, Roddy McDowell, Rachel Roberts and company, but--and in the words of the original screen Chan--most viewers should say ""Thank you so much!"" and pass along another way.
