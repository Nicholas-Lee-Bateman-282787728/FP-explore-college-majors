7951081,5,B00005QW5W,"Ekin Cheng, stars as Mr. Cool, a former gang member, who returns to Hong Kong after being incarcerated in a Taiwanese prison for six years to discover he has a illegitimate son by his ex-girlfriend.
Cool, a renowned Martial Artist, has grown up in prison and wants nothing to do with his former association but the gangers won't take no for an answer.
To complicate matters, Cool gains custody of his son, and a new love interest, his son's school teacher!
I am a big fan of Ekin Cheng and HK cinema in general and I LOVED this film. Ekin was great as the reformed Bad Guy, always bearing things with stoicism and a sense of humor. The only thing I didn't like was the ending...
Definitely a must see for fans of Ekin's.",1032134400,2,720,4.380597014925373
