Marketed for an underserved audience that deserves much better.",1390953600,,149,5.818181818181818
8652616,4,B007FRX058,First off I have to say I did not buy this DVD. I bought several disks from company and they gave this to me free. Sometimes the production seems a little more could have been put into it. If you are looking for a big budget disk this is not it. It teaches quite a few ways to meditate (focus the mind). I never meditated before but I have to say I have not felt so good in a very long time. I feel more with it than I have felt in years. The 4 stars is a mixture of 2 1/2 stars for DVD and 5 stars for the meditation itself. If you are a little older I would recommend learning. It is easy. I am more aware. I feel my blood pressure has gone done (not tested yet). I am more relaxed. I recommend meditation whole heartedly.,1339977600,,724,3.865771812080537
