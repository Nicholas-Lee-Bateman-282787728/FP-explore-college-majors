8242225,3,B0011TN7C2,I think if you want to learn hypnosis by something else. There is to much talking about things that is not really relevant to the subject.,1381104000,,138,4.346153846153846
8242226,4,B0011TN7C2,I bought this to learn how to hypnotize myself.  I have found that self hypnosis is a very useful tool and have great luck with it over the years.  I am interested in mind games and to see how a professional uses the techniques. It was interesting as well as entertaining. It gave me some ideas for my in house training sessions to spice thing up a bit.,1275436800,2,353,4.176470588235294
8242227,3,B0011TN7C2,"The production quality of this DVD is ok. The information in this video is VERY basic, too basic for the price. If you have about an hour of time to search YOUTUBE, you could gather as much good data. Mr. Nongard is a skilled Hypnotist, but in this video you don't learn much of what he may have to offer. I would not recommend this video to anyone. Save your money and watch his videos or others on YOUTUBE.",1261440000,17,408,4.177215189873418
