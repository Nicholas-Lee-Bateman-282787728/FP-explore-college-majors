202971,4,1930612001,"Do you want to be inspired? Watch this video.
We often use the term 'revival' too lightly, referring to a particularly inspiring meeting. In this video, revival describes an entire society being reformed. Depending on the city, this has different 'symptoms'. For example: bars being closed, due to lack of business; jails being closed, due to lack of crime; increased harvests; reduction in drug trade; all-night prayer vigils held in the sports arena, with tens of thousands of participants, etc.
There are four segments, each about 15 minutes long, each featuring a different city around the world that is currently undergoing revival. I was most impacted by the commonalities between these stories. In each case, the story started with sin and darkness. In each case, there were praying believers. In each case, churches united in partnership.  The lessons seem obvious.",1054512000,14,873,5.235714285714286
202972,5,1930612001,Two years ago I attended one of George Otis Jr seninars in Australia. I found him inspiring and very creadable.  (17 years ago I saw his Dad at a FGBMFI meeting in Melbourne and he was showing off his 16mm film on his Lebanon Radio station) His journalistic background has given him the ability to be professional and very well researched in this production and in Transformations 2. This video is must see for anyone who wants some solid proof God still exists.,1046736000,10,462,4.566265060240964
202973,5,1930612001,"A powerful testimony to the power of the Living God! In this video George Otis Jr. documents four towns that have been transformed by God. This, as the video well documents, takes place when churches come together in unity to call out to God in prayer. During this time of prayer God showed the intercessors the reasons why darkness was so strong in their towns and how to pray against it. This video clearly demonstrates the gospel by revealing just how much God wants to be involved in our lives, churches and communities. It also shows the blessing that comes when we corporately turn to God and acknowledge Him in all our ways. I recommend this video to be watched individually or corporately, in small groups and in churches; as God wants this for all His people in every church and every town.",1022198400,15,799,4.594405594405594

202985,5,1930612001,"This is a must-have classic documentary for your Christian library.  It was one of the first to document God's faithfulness in transforming communities across the world, and made me think differently about God's interactions with people when it first came out many years ago, and it has reminded me of His personal investment in His people now that I have seen it again.  I'm sure I will pull it out and re-watch it on occasion, as I do Father of Lights and other inspiring documentaries of our time.",1393804800,2,500,4.670454545454546

202988,5,1930612001,It's amazing to see what God did and how he trasformed dark place to light. And see what can even happen to land and produce when a place turns back to God. And that even jails can close down in a place cause there basically is no more crime.,1382745600,,242,3.9591836734693877

202990,5,1930612001,The video was great. I wanted to share it with my small group Bible study.

202992,5,1930612001,"I first saw this video when it first came out, but I left it in a VCR machine that I sold! Saw it again when recently re-purchasing, and had the same 'riveting' experience. If you want to see some unimaginable things that our awesome God does, check out this video. You will say to yourself, ""This can't be happening ... but I'm seeing it with my own eyes."" Oh, WE of little faith! We, the church, have got to learn that we need each other, lay down our 'we've got it together' pride, embrace one another as the Body of Christ, and unite so God can move among us. Forgive us, Lord, for our puny short sightedness, and teach us unity--based on Your Spirit, and not on the doctrines we allow to divide us! George Otis, Jr. has done a masterful job of documenting all this.",1379980800,3,770,4.280821917808219

203002,5,1930612001,"Anyone who is interested in genuine revival should enjoy this video.  I was so encouraged by it that I shared it with my friends and my church, and I even took it with me on a recent trip to Haiti and showed it to some believers there in the French version. It is challenging, encouraging, and uplifting and has given me a desire to see the same kind of revival in my town in Oklahoma and in our nation.  I have been inspired and given hope that in the difficult times we are facing in the United States that our nation may yet be turned around by the type of revival shown in this video.  I hope others will see this video and find the same kind of inspiration.",1346803200,8,662,4.116279069767442

Everything in this video is a strong reminder to all Christians that we need to go back to prayer and stand in the authority that God has given us.

203012,5,1930612001,"I've seen the video (and Transformations II which I wish Amazon also carried and highly recommend it to anyone even if you only come out with a renewed committment to individual prayer -- something that is the 1st and foremost key (with reading the Word) to success in the ongoing Christian life. It is also invaluable as inspiration for corporate prayer. Have you ever seen a church in rivival (consistent miracles, spontaneous conviction of sin and willing obedience to the steps to salvation, gifts of the spirit operating within Corinthian guidelines)without a sustained inercessory prayer group? Neither have I. Yet the naysayers (who probably are in dead (no spirit) churches or no church at all)pick apart that which is NOT Otis' calling -salvation. His calling is corporate prayer by believers. Otis presupposes (and teaches) that prayer warriors who would get involved in this kind of prayer (or any intercessory prayer) are already saved and filled with the Spirit. Otherwise the person would find themselves like the example in Acts: beat up stripped and naked by demons. ""We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, against spiritual wickedness in high places.""

This and all the Transformations videos are a wonderful inspiration to individuals, churches and whole cities to join voices and call out to God for more of Him (revival).",1153872000,5,1381,5.192825112107624
203013,1,1930612001,"There have been several websites that have questioned the facts in this video. If you buy or view this video I recommend you do the same. About a year ago I personally e-mailed Mareth Warren at the Sentinal Group who forwarded it to another (can't remember his name)requesting a refutation. The staff member responded that they were planning to post a refutation to their critics claims on the Sentinal web site; I'm still waiting.
Additionally George Otis has never personally disavowed his unbiblical Moral Government Theology as outlined in his book ""The God They Never Knew""",1062201600,7,578,5.03125

However, before I did I wanted to make sure the information was accurate.  I did research on the video and the towns where they claim the great revivals happened.  It appears the video is exaggerated and misleading.
Let Us Reason Ministries has a lot of documentation.  The claims of violence and crime going down are misleading.  Pastors in the towns were interviewed and they said the claims were false.
