8505055,5,B006VOX7O0,"This is an exceptional performance of Bruckner's 7th with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Klaus Tennstedt in 1977.  I never saw Tennstedt live, but having the privilege of seeing this performance makes me appreciate all the more what a special conductor he was.  This is simply a great performance, and the Boston Symphony rises to the occasion.  Indeed, listening to this performance makes me appreciate that great Bruckner playing need not be limited to orchestras in Germany and Austria (and the Netherlands).  Except for some minor flubs from the trumpets in the fourth movement, the playing of the orchestra is never anything less than superb.

Tennstedt puts forward an earnest, involved reading of this magnificent symphony.  The performance is imbued with emotional involvement, great dignity, and complete commitment.  Nothing is routine in the performance, nor does Tennstedt introduce interpretive disruptions.  We just get pure Bruckner, played beautifully and with the music doing the talking.  And it speaks volumes.

I had a couple of unexpected reactions.  First, I counted I believe four women in the entire orchestra.  Things have certainly changed since 1977!  And second, what is interesting to me is that I didn't even know this performance was out there until recently and it certainly hasn't made any great splash in terms of an awareness that there's a great Bruckner 7performance lurking on DVD.  Compare that to the DVD of Celibidache's return to the Berlin Philharmonic with his live Bruckner 7, which has received lots of raves and yet which to these ears is such a weird, non-conforming reading that gets crushed under the weight of its own slowness (a 90-minute performance of a symphony that most do between 60-70 minutes).  And I consider myself a Celibidache fan!

At any rate, I greatly encourage anyone who loves Bruckner, or loves Tennstedt, to get your hands on this truly great performance.  It's quite special.",1445731200,8,1961,5.194267515923567

8505057,5,B006VOX7O0,"The legendary Klaus Tennstedt (1926-1998) leads a riveting, intensely lyrical performance of Anton Bruckner's most popular and immediately appealing symphony. Tennstedt's tempos, at least in the first two movements, are somewhat slower than the norm. The second, for example, stretches out to a leisurely twenty-two and one half minutes. But the conductor's dramatic gift ensures that each episode commands our undivided attention. Moreover he manages Bruckner's often abrupt changes of mood and color with uncommon skill and sensitivity. Indeed this splendid performance alone would guarantee Tennstedt a place in the pantheon of great Bruckner interpreters from Wilhelm Furtwangler to Christian Thielemann.

The video reveals that Tennstedt conducts with his entire body--particularly his hands, elbows, shoulders, and head. Gestures range from the tiniest motion of the tip of the baton to broad, sweeping movements of the conductor's arms which slash the air wildly and bring forth volcanic eruptions from the great Boston Symphony. According to the booklet, Tennstedt was so nervous and insecure in 1974 that he very nearly cancelled his first appearance with this orchestra. Here, just three years later, he exudes tremendous confidence and exercises total command of his forces. Nonetheless he is not afraid to smile when warranted by the music and to even dance a bit in the joyous scherzo.

It is unclear from the booklet which edition of the score Tennstedt employed for this performance. However the controversial cymbal crash in the slow movement, restored by Leopold Nowak in 1954, is included.

This DVD captures the Boston band at very nearly the peak of its considerable powers. In more than an hour of challenging, exhausting music--most notably for the brass--I detected only one tiny flaw: a few cracked notes from the clarinets. The warmth and beauty of the strings (especially the first violins and double basses) hark back to Serge Koussevitzky's heyday nearly thirty years before. Flutist Doriot Anthony Dwyer, as so often in this era, deserves special recognition for the almost impossible richness of her tone and the majesty of her phrasing. The seemingly tireless brasses provide a glowing harmonic underpinning to the proceedings, and when called upon (as they are quite frequently in this score) they make a most magnificent racket. Even the timpanist shines here. His deafening crescendo toward the end of the first movement is simply unforgettable.

The camera work and direction are generally sensible, especially given that this was a live telecast. A few significant solos were missed, and the occasional split-screen effects are distracting and unnecessary. And, oh my, don't those Wagner Tubas look strange? At climactic moments, the director generally defaults to a wide shot of the full orchestra from the back of the hall, but the ensemble is so distant from the camera that hardly any detail (other than the pipes of Symphony Hall's familiar organ) is visible.

For a 1977 telecast, the audio is unexpectedly vivid and detailed. The basses and timpani sound magnificently rich and full. Further, the score's many delicate wind solos have been expertly captured without undue spotlighting. Unfortunately the violins seem quite far from the microphones (at least in the opening movement), but the ear quickly compensates. Only after glancing at the back of the box did I realize that this recording was described as ""enhanced mono"" (whatever that is) and not true stereo.

In other words, urgently recommended. Now, ICA, can we please have more Tennstedt?",1339804800,23,3593,5.361702127659575
