Triple H makes his WWE Studios debut as he plays Ray Bradstone who used to be a wheel-man for a group of bank robbers led by a man named Larue (Kevin Corrigan) but was caught & served a prison sentence where he rehabilitated himself via advice from a radio show & knowledgeable books. He gets released with the goal to leave his past behind him, including refusing to be acknowledged by his past nickname of ""Ray Ray"", & set things right with his daughter Sally (Ariel Winter) & ex-wife Lynne (Annabeth Gish). After the difficulties of being an ex-con in the real world effected Ray as his family kept telling him that they've moved on while he couldn't find a job & lost everything he had in a fire, he agreed to do another job with his old crew but had a change of heart at the last minute & ditched the crew during the robbery and stowaway on his daughter's class trip to New Orleans. When the Larue & the robbers discover that Ray left them & the police chase them, one of the robbers drop the bag of money next to the school bus Ray is on by accident & it gets loaded on the bus that Ray just happens to be on making Larue think that Ray set them up to take the fall while he gets away with the money. So while Ray uses this trip to try to reconnect with his daughter, he has to deal with so many other issues such as the trip's supervisor Ms. Miller (Yeardley Smith), Larue on his tail, the police also looking for Ray assuming that he was was part of the robbery, and dealing with the kids on this trip from the ""spoiled"" Paris Hilton type to a ""brainiac"" to a prankster.

Inside Out:
A.J. (Triple H) is an ex-convict who was in jail for 13 years for manslaughter. The man to meet him when he gets out is his best friend, Jack (Michael Rapaport), who's a low-level mobster working for his father Dr. Vic (Bruce Dern) & also married to A.J. ex-girlfriend Claire (Parker Posey) with them having a daughter named Pepper (Juliette Goglia). When Jack tries to get A.J. back in the game, he tells him that he's not going back into mob work & just wants to have his own business making pickles (which becomes a running joke throughout the whole movie) but ends up being at the wrong place at the wrong time when Jack accidentally shoots someone he's was only suppose to collect money from for his father causing him to handle the situation while Jack kept the money for himself & left town. It later turns out that the man Jack shot was an undercover informant for Martha (Julie White), an agent for the Louisiana Tax Board, who's out to get Dr. Vic for tax evasion & illegal smuggling but also gets the police involved when she informs Detective Calgrove (Michael Cudlitz) about her informant missing only to find out about the shooting. After Dr. Vic finds out that the deal went back & he didn't get his money, A.J. said he would handle it only for Vic to decide to take matters into his own hands. So A.J. must deal with trying to protect Jack's family & address the issues between him & Claire, dealing with Martha & Det. Calgrove who are determined to get Vic with or without his help, Jack's out of control attitude, and Vic's deadly assistant Irena (Jency Griffin) who had a habit of leaving notes saying ""Kaboom"" before something bad happens.

""The Chaperone"" was WWE Studios second attempt at a family comedy after Knucklehead with the difference here being that this was more humorous with the dialog more than just physical comedy as it was a modern day ""Kindergarten Cop"" & a good overall family comedy.  ""Inside Out"" had some establish actors throughout the movie & the story was good but wasn't anything here really memorable or would make me watch it again after the first viewing.  Both films has Triple H playing an ex-con trying to turn his life around only to keep running into issues with people from his past only with one movie being played for comedy while the other had a more serious tone so both movies are worth a rental or a stream to decide if it's something you want to keep in your collection.",1399939200,,4040,4.411528150134048
