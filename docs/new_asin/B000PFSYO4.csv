2817574,1,B000PFSYO4,"In my honest opinion, this was a terrible movie.  I agree with that other post that said that the Marvel releases were bad (although I did like the Dr. Strange one), but this wasn't any better.  If anyone has seen the animated Justice League/ Justice League Unlimited cartoon on Cartoon Network, they are sure to be disappointed with this release.  If they had at least used the same voice actors and artists from the cartoon series, this might have turned out better.",1201564800,12,468,4.682926829268292
2817575,2,B000PFSYO4,"Like another reviewer mentioned, if you saw the first 20 minutes of the film, you would have high hopes for the rest, but around the 45 minute mark, things fall apart.

I've never read the graphic novel it is based on and my comments are on the film itself.

The film starts off promisingly with a mysterious man writing about the end of humanity before killing himself.  It is 1953, and the US is coming off yet another war, and the start of the cold war.  The Justice Society has been disbanded, with members hunted by the government in an era of McCarthyism.  People are suspicious of each other and their motives.  Even the super heroes question what is right and wrong.

Despite all the turmoil, heroes like Batman work underground as a mysterious cult envelopes the world and clues about something or someone called, ""The Centre"" may spell doom for man kind.  Along the way, characters such as Hal Jordan, the Martian Manhunter, Flash, et al, are introduced, eventually coming together to face whatever this ""Centre"" is.

The action builds at a great pace, as more and more about the characters and this ""centre"" are revealed until the 45 minute mark when the centre just appears.  Then it becomes an all out battle, with all the superheroes of the world uniting under superman who reminds the world that in the grand scheme of things, all the bickering is petty when the fate of the world is at stake.

unfortunately, this battle is the downfall of the movie. It's as if halfway through, the funding was cut and the movie had to end quickly.  The fantastic build-up of the ""centre"" plot are dropped as if it was of no consequence.  He or It, just becomes another bad guy.  No explanation is giving to why ""the centre"" appears out of nowhere, how he effects people psychicly, and where he came from.  A detective character, who is implied to be the Martian manhunter in disguise, or maybe not, is dropped.  Why the martian manhunter goes after the space shuttle launch is not made clear, and his assimilation happens too quickly.

You know the good guys win in the end, but the climax is all too deus ex machina and cliched that it is a disgrace to what preceeded it.  If you've seen the, ""hero knows nothing about his powers, but at the pivotal moment becomes more powerful than all the other superheroes combined and able to take down the evil entity that was previously too much for all the superheroes"" in at least 30 of the recent justice league cartoons, this will feel tired.

Voice acting is solid.  animation is great.  But the first 45 minutes are so well done, that you may feel bitter and angry the remainder is so disastrously poor.",1201305600,31,2651,4.585987261146497
2817576,5,B000PFSYO4,"I was lucky enough to've gotten a screening copy with the 1st 20 minutes of the film & already being a fan of the original source material let me just say WOW!!!  This is one of the closest adaptions from comic to film that I've ever seen & it transfers over nicely!  The animation is great, though maybe not quite as crisp as the Superman/Doomsday recently released.  One thing is for sure, it still blows the pants off any of Marvel's animated features.  The scenes from the film come right out of the book, from the Hal Jordon being shot down over enemy skies, to Martian Manhunter mimicing Groucho & Bugs Bunny, to the Flash racing through Vegas looking for the 6 hidden bombs planted by Captain Cold.  Not everything is included from the original book, but almost everything is at least touched upon & acknowledged with there only being a few exceptions.  All the voice acting seemed pretty well spot on, Supes voice is gonna take a little getting used to & Batman didn't have a speaking roll (only seen fighting off the cult who'd kidnapped the boy when John Jonnz comes to help).  All in all if the first 20 minutes is any indicator of the rest of the film (which I can only imagine will be) this is gonna be an amazing film!!!  Definately a must own item for any comic fan!!!",1200441600,18,1283,4.4297872340425535
2817577,4,B000PFSYO4,"Justice League: New Frontier is the second in a series of stand alone animated films (the first was Superman: Doomsday), and is a direct to video adaptation of the New Frontier comic by award winning writer and artist Darwyn Cooke, who was involved with this film as one of the writers and producers. Producer Bruce Timm was involved (the man behind the Justice League TV series) but this is a very different effort.

Set in the 1950s, the story features the origins of the Justice League heroes during an optimistic but still troubled time, with acknowledgments of the civil rights movement and paranoia about communism. We follow the origin story of Hal Jordan as Green Lantern as well as the Martian Manhunter, though Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Flash are also prominently featured. And of course, we get their formation as a team for the first time against a threat too great for anything but a combined effort.

Cooke is a fan of the ""Silver Age"" of comics, and there are a few more obscure comic characters making brief appearances too. As far as the main cast, it's Kyle MacLachlan (Twin Peaks) as Superman, Jeremy Sisto (Six Feet Under) as Batman, Lucy Lawless (Xena) as Wonder Woman, Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser) as The Flash and David Boreanaz (Angel) as Green Lantern. The voice work is terrific, and even though Batman isn't in much of the film, Jeremy Sisto makes a huge new impression. The animation ranges from excellent to outstanding, and I think the retro montage created for the opening credits is worth the price of admission alone.

It should be noted this isn't for very young children, there's no swearing but there's an opening where an unknown character finishes writing a book about the malevolent force, and then shoots himself in the head. None of the bloodshed is terribly graphic, but it's there so the film is rated PG-13 for violence. Personally, I'm glad to see animation being produced for adults, and I think it's a great idea to adapt completely different comics and graphic novels into animated films, giving us different perspectives on these timeless characters. This is a sincere effort to make a worthwhile film, and I hope it finds some support out there.

Available as a single disc, with commentaries and some extras, or a 2-disc special edition, which adds two more documentaries (I can't find online how long they'll be) and three episodes of the Justice League animated TV series.",1199318400,2,2442,4.862980769230769

2817599,3,B000PFSYO4,"It's interesting though the story is very thin and cockamamie and only seems to exist  as an excuse to introduce or at least present each member of the Justice League , even Green Arrow was present in a non speaking role. Aquaman made an appearance at the last but imo it was awkward and inexplicable , I half expected him to say something like "" so whats been goin on up here with you folks? We've been hearing a bunch of noise from down there , is there like a war or something?"" The violence was really quite jarring considering the nostalgic flavor of the animation but I suppose it wouldnt have sold if it didn't contain some.

2817600,5,B000PFSYO4,"If you are mourning the loss of the brilliant comic book artist-writer Darwyn Cooke, one of the best ways to celebrate his life and talent is to reread his graphic novels and shorter stories, and to view this faithful adaptation of one of his best stories. THE NEW FRONTIER: SPECIAL EDITION (Blu-ray) is a low-priced version of the animated feature that captures Cooke's dynamic designs and beautiful writing, as well as the spirit of post-war America, when the possibilities were endless and a young president inspired millions of Baby Boomers to lives of public service.
  This was also the time when comic books, especially the DC line, were invigorated by writers and artists inspired by editor Julius Schwartz to ""be original"" (his motto), and produced a Silver Age of comics marked by intelligent writing and graceful artwork. Cooke had his own, unique style, but you can see the influences of these masters of the superhero genre in this poetic paen to the era.

2817616,5,B000PFSYO4,"Watching this brought back the nostalgia of growing up reading the comics of the Silver Age. It focuses on the heroes who started the resurgence of comics in the late 50's. It puts modern slants on the origins and first meetings of the characters, but retains the wonder and freshness of that by-gone era. It was nice to see Green Lantern as the main character instead of Batman and Superman. It was fun for this long time comic book fan to spot familiar characters in the crowd scenes. The producers showed their own fan-boy love for long forgotten names and faces that they sprinkled around in background- Unnamed heroes & teams like the Challengers of the Unknown, Metal Men, Doom Patrol & Slam Bradley. The ""Easter Eggs"" spread throughout this movie won't confuse or alienate any newer viewers because the tip of the hat to the past only enhances an otherwise satisfying story.",1457395200,8,881,4.764705882352941

2817639,4,B000PFSYO4,"In the fifties, the world doesnt know what to make of superheroes. Some of them are accepted and beloved, others not so much. When a mysterious entity known as The Center rises to thwart the planet, the core Justice LeaguersSuperman, Batman, Flash, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, and Martian Manhuntermust unite for the first time to stop what is seemingly an unstoppable threat.

Based on the best-selling graphic novel by Darwyn Cooke, Justice League: The New Frontier is unlike any Justice League movie out there. For starters, its a period piece. Nothing modern day here, with the story taking place between 1953 and 1960. Even more so, its art direction is based on Cookes art from the graphic novel, where each character was drawn in a very forties-style way: simple, with minimal muscle and heavy lines for eyes. No bodybuilding superheroes in this flick. And, of course, all the backgrounds, supporting cast and tech in the film were all time-appropriate as well. Even the advanced tech in the film was old school in its presentation and style.

The story was goodvery much an origin story for the Justice League, with the overarching origin story being that of Green Lanternand each character was faithful to their source material. The pacing was a bit slow at times, with lots of talkingthere were a few moments where I was, like, Get on with it! but at the same time, it being a period piece, TV and movies back then had lots of talking, too.

Not that talking is a bad thing. Just wished for a few more fast-paced sequencesnot necessarily violence or fightingto move things along.

Warner Bros. and DC Comics are amazing at their direct-to-market animated features, each one meant to stand on its own instead of where one story feeds off another. By doing that, they pick and choose the best graphic novels to adapt and don't have to worry about the baggage of continuity as a result. Doing Justice League: The New Frontier afforded them an opportunity to do something wholly original and deliver something that modern day audiences haven't seen in recent years: a superhero story that takes place in the past. After watching this, I wish someone in Hollywood would do a live action version of Superman or Flash or whoever, but set it in the past. You can still be true to the characters, as this story has shown, but give something fresh at the same time and, from a marketing and creative standpoint, give something original as a result.

Justice League: The New Frontier is a fantastic movie, and for those who want more of their favorite heroes but sometimes wish something new was done with them, then this is the flick for you.

2817665,5,B000PFSYO4,"I rather enjoyed this take on the Justice League as instead of rebooting the Justice League the filmmakers decided to take them back to the 50s during the Korean War time period. The Cold War period provides a pretty cool background for this movie as the paranoia over Communists and fear of the superhumans feels real. Used as an introduction/origin for both Green Lantern and Martian Manhunter the film also gives glimpses of the mindset of the 50s with regular people set against the Flash for wearing red and fearing he may be a Communist. The animation is solid and harkens back to an earlier age of comics (not the same animation as either of the JLA tv shows), the story moves along at a decent pace. At PG13 there are a couple of things that are touchy for younger viewers but another outstanding release from DC. A load of extras with documentaries about the JL including a cool one about the Legion of Doom plus a few extra episodes from the tv series thrown in.

2817672,5,B000PFSYO4,"This vibrant and beautifully produced adaptation of the ""Justice League - The New Frontier""
comic book series by Darwyn Cooke is nothing short of spectacular.  The idea of incorporating
the golden and silver age DC Comics characters into their actual timeline against the political
and social climate of the day makes for a totally compelling, thoughtful and thrilling ride.
Every aspect of this production is first rate.  Producer Bruce Timm and the many talented
artists who obviously lovingly labored on the project all deserve top marks.  An atypical cast
is assembled for the voice acting (David Boreanaz, Miguel Ferrer, Lucy Lawless, Phil Morris,
Kyle Maclachlan, Jeremy Sisto and Neil Patrick Harris) by Andrea Romano.
Themes of racial tolerance, war, patriotism, paranoia are all explored within the confines
of science fiction (a great vehicle).  The New Frontier speech by President John Fitzgerald
Kennedy provides the coda and continues to inspire and remind us all as Americans of our
special heritage and the need to rise to those challenges as a nation.

Special features include a superb documentary of the Justice League of America comic
series and its many eras and incarnations over the past fifty years.  This book and the
concepts it explored basically gave birth to the silver age of comics (as well as DC Comics
biggest competitor) and remains to this day a source of inspiration and imagination.
Kudos to the many artists who have contributed over the years.",1393027200,,1482,5.154166666666667
2817673,4,B000PFSYO4,"If you grew up reading the Silver Age comic books as I did, in some respects this movie (along with the original source material) is a respectful look back, although its setting is a couple of decades prior to that Silver Age, set in the mid-1950s during the McCarthy era. Unlike the heroes of the Silver Age comics of the 60s and 70s, these heroes are not universally welcomed by the people and the government of the U.S.; the former greets them with suspicion and paranoia and the latter tries to round them up and contain them. This is the story of how they overcome that suspicion and work together against a common world-threatening foe, planting the seeds that will eventually become the Justice League.

The movie opens with various unconnected vignettes, as we are introduced to Hal Jordan, who is then a fighter pilot in Korea and who's just been told the war is over, the Martian Manhunter, who has just been accidentally transported to Earth, Superman and Wonder Woman, who argue on the battlefield in Vietnam, Superman and Lois Lane discussing the need for heroes, the Flash battling Captain Cold, the Martian Manhunter meeting Batman as they save a child abducted by a religious cult, Hal Jordan taking on the mantle of Green Lantern, and so on.

As we see these scenes, we hear a voice speaking through some of these characters, the voice of an ancient being called ""The Center,"" who has vast physical and mental powers. It has decided that humanity is a blight on the planet, a blight that must be eradicated. And it just might have the power to do so.

It's hard to sum up the plot without giving too much away. And it's a hard plot to sum up, anyway, since there are so many plot threads that weave through this movie, like the connection between Hal Jordan, the Martian Manhunter, Superman, Mars, and Abin Sur. Suffice to say that there are connections and they all lead up to a terrifying threat, one that will require the cooperation and courage of everyone: hero, soldier, government agent, and civilian alike.

But is that enough? The threat is unlike anything they've ever faced. It has taken out two of their strongest with ease; how can the rest of them win? The final battle is amazing, with an all-out assault on multiple fronts, a desperate do-or-die plan, devastating losses, but also true heart, inspiration, and courage. This is very much a tale of yesteryear and every now and then it's nice to have that kind of unambiguous good vs. evil story, one that leaves you with an impulse to cheer at the end.

The artwork, the costumes, the clothing, the hairstyles all share the same nostalgic look backward, and there are lovely little touches everywhere, like the national anthem played at the end of the television day, with the Indian head test screen. This truly is an all-star cast, more so than is usual for these films, with David Boreanaz as Hal Jordan, Miguel Ferrer as the Martian Manhunter, Neil Patrick Harris as the Flash, Lucy Lawless as Wonder Woman, Kyle MacLachlan as Superman, Kyra Sedgwick as Lois Lane, Brooke Shields as Carol Ferris, and so on. The standout for me was Jeremy Sisto as Batman but all of the actors had their moments.

My only problem with this movie is that they tried to cram too much material into too little time. That means that they had to give short shrift to some of these plot threads, had to leave out clarifying scenes from the original source material, didn't have time to develop some of these characters, and so on. Overall, though, I enjoyed this a lot and, for a brief time, felt like I was returning to an earlier era.",1392249600,,3599,4.642072213500785

Super heroes are being hunted down by a dark ops government agency.  Only Superman and Wonder Woman sign loyalty agreements are called upon to help in times of great need.

2817695,4,B000PFSYO4,"I guess if you are well versed with the comic book background of the Justice League, you will have no problem following this movie - but since I didn't, it took me some time to put all the pieces together.  Despite that, this was an enjoyable movie and well worth the time spent viewing it.

The movie uses a villain of epic proportions to bring together the members of the Justice League, and it arrives at this consolidated group of heroes through a rather disjointed way.  Stories about Flash, Superman and Wonder Woman, Batman, and Green Lantern all seem to be going on at the same time until they come together and the story makes sense.  In a way, this movie reminded me of ""The Usual Suspects"", in which you didn't get what was going on until the end, but this movie was much easier to understand.  I think that with a little bit of background it would have been easier to follow and then would have been more enjoyable from the get-go.

Like other Superfriends / Justice League adventures, the villain in this one is a real meanie and incredibly destructive.  One superhero dies and then comes back; others suffer significant injuries which eventually heal.  There are also a group of heroes which are unfamiliar and are not introduced, so you either have to have background knowledge or look them up after watching the movie; fortunately, these are lesser heroes which thus far have not played a big part in any stories I am familiar with.

In the final analysis, this movie presents an interesting story, a great villain, and a fresh look at the superheroes we watched and read about as a child.  While I might have done a few things differently when crafting it, I wouldn't hesitate to watch it again.  It was interesting, fun and entertaining - just what I wanted out of this type of movie.

2817711,1,B000PFSYO4,"Contains spoilers. This is my opinion of the movie. I will go into detail. If you have your heart set on seeing this movie, then move along. If you want to see some random knucklehead's opinion, then please enjoy.

Where to begin with this movie. The main problem is with how the characters are being represented. Green Lantern is a self-centered pacifist. Superman is useless and preachy. Other than Martian Manhunter, none of the others are remarkable in any way. We are first treated to Hal Jordan, the soon-to-be Green Lantern. He has decided that killing enemy combatants in the Korean war that he is piloting in is unjustifiable. This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for two things. 1. He has wingmen that he is endangering with this policy. 2. He kills an enemy soldier in self-defense a couple seconds later. I shall not blame him for that, but later he comments that the only way he could be made to kill is save his own stupid hide. So, what about the men fighting alongside you? Screw them, I guess. Your country that has called upon you to defend it? Screw it too.
Superman's role is completely unnecessary and he literally does nothing in it. If he had been left out it may have actually been an improvement. Every time he comes onto the screen he is preaching some half-baked reasoning at us. First, he explains that Batman and Wonder Woman are fugitives (something that is never fully explained) because they didn't give up on their principles when people asked them too. How dare they have convictions! The nerve! They try to represent this by Superman chewing out Wonder Woman in Cambodia. Wonder Woman has just released some girls from captivity from some marauders that murdered their husbands and kept them to ""use."" Upon their release they picked up various weapons and killed the dirtbags. Oh no! Rapists are being killed! The horror! Superman is against this because of his usual holier-than-thou approach to crime-fighting. Normally, Superman leads by example. Showing everyone of what they can be by doing the right thing himself. He lets his actions do the talking. This time he's some unwanted ""preacher"" that keeps popping up to throw his ideals at the audience. When the government captures Martian for trying to sneak on a rocket ship headed to Mars, he's there to accuse the agents of xenophobia. Yes, Supes, that's it. It has nothing to do with him being caught in a restricted area on government property or anything.
Meanwhile, Hal Jordan is being made the Green Lantern because he believes that ""all life is precious."" Okay, fine, I guess I can see that. That makes sense. The super-villain here is a telepathic flying island (strange, I know) that fears humans and our destructive tendencies. When the island, which is called the Center, comes around with his hoard of dinosaur minions (which even stranger), Green Lantern in an integral piece in thier defeat. And by defeat, I mean mean he blows them all the heck up. Does GL mourn the harsh necessity of war? Does he regret the action of wiping out an endangered species and the millennia old life-form that was the Center? Does he wish for a world where the Center had overcome his irrational fear of humanity and shared with us his wisdom that came with thousands of years of observation of the human race? No, he flies into space and does some loop-the-loops. This character is unbelievably inconsistent! Where was Superman during all this? Surely, he could have vindicated his existence in this epic battle. Actually, he was flattened by a giant laser from the Center and was MIA for the whole fight. So...yeah, he was useless and annoying for the entire movie. At least it was a short one.",1362614400,8,3682,4.753125

2817729,4,B000PFSYO4,"New Frontier is an animated adaptation of a comic book limited series of the same name by Darwyn Cooke (which I have not read as of yet).  It is set in the 1950s and depicts an atmosphere in which distrust is common and superheroes are treated with suspicion and envy by the public and government alike.  Lurking in the background is a force referred to as The Centre, which is coming to the conclusion that humanity is too dangerous to be allowed existence.

All of the Justice League mainstays are involved, but Green Lantern, Flash and Martian Manhunter are the main focus.  Their character arcs drive the feature, and are all interesting and reasonably well developed.  This is particularly true of Hal Jordan, whose origin as Green Lantern gets center stage.

The look and feel of New Frontier is purposely that of a different time, not only in setting but also style.  Golden and Silver Age character designs are used and the story itself focuses on changing attitudes and fears of the 1950s adapted to larger than life heroes and threats.  Fans solely of modern comics might find this jarring but those interested in all eras should enjoy it.

The special features for the two-disc version are excellent, primarily the look at how villains evolved in comics through time and their relationships with the heroes they fight.  Other features include a discussion of adapting the story from the comic and three episodes from Justice League Unlimited.

There's a lot covered and the movie moves at a quick pace, but I think it's works well and spends time in the right spots to flesh out the story.  Overall New Frontier is a nice tribute to a different era and type of comic story and a strong addition to DC's animation library.",1341705600,2,1732,4.736666666666666

2817731,4,B000PFSYO4,"To put my cards on the table, I'm not a comic book fan. I'm not even a fan of cartoons, strictly speaking. Instead, I'm an Amazon user who enjoys re-watching ""Batman the Animated Series"" from the 90s.

This movie is very distinct from that generation of 90s cartoons. It's all harsher, more violent, though not needlessly so, and not really action-packed. But it's also a more mature story, a gritty and less ideal look at the world of Superman and company. In some cases, it's wonderful.

For instance, this movie shows the only Batman I have ever found really scary. Finally!

There are weaknesses. First of all, the movie presents yet another story where Superman is the punching bag, though it's handled well enough. And even with the added grit and violence, the movie still lacks the narrative weight of a good live-action show.

In the end, it all makes for a very interesting and even inspiring movie, but I find the 90s cartoons more enjoyable.",1333324800,,953,4.72289156626506

2817734,3,B000PFSYO4,"I've read the books this film was adapted from and now seen the film, and in both cases I was left feeling, ""That was okay, I guess...."" which isn't the most ringing endorsement.  As a lifelong reader and collector of DC Silver Age comics I was interested to see these beloved characters in action again, and that was genuinely thrilling, but the usual problem of team comics is very apparent here.  The storyline is forced to work in far more characters than space allows, so many are shortchanged, and the plot must perforce be contrived to present yet another cosmic menace so overwhelming that all these super-people are required to band together to stop it.  And after fifty years of huge cosmic menaces, there isn't much unexplored territory left to cover.  So much of the conflict in this story feels contrived and convenient or borrowed from other similar stories.  If you think you've seen it all before, you probably have.  The last sequences will remind you strongly of  the original Star Wars, most tellingly.

I don't think the animation is as strong as in earlier DC animated projects, and the plot wasn't nearly as engaging as those crafted for the 1990s Batman series.  Perhaps Batman's more down-to-earth, film noir settings lend themselves to better drama.  Batman is one of the more interesting characters in Justice League: New Frontiers but is not given as much screen time as Green Lantern/Hal Jordan or  the Martian Manhunter, who together are the big hogs of this movie.  MM is handled well, for a character I was never much a fan of, but Hal Jordan has had his Silver Age origins tweaked in some odd ways that don't really work for me.  And he doesn't show up as Green Lantern until relatively late in the film.

We see in passing Superman, Wonder Woman (token femme hero), the Flash, Robin, Green Arrow, Adam Strange, the Blackhawks, Aquaman, the Atom, and some assorted girfriends, but few of these heroes have much to do -- Wonder Woman in particular  seems sadly wasted, especially given Lucy Lawless' presence as her voice -- the closest we'll ever get to having her star in the part she was born to play, alas.  There are simply too many heroes crammed into too small a space, I'm afraid.  The cosmic menace is a sort of amorphous flying blob that spins out dinosaurs and monsters from itself, sort of Lovecraftian, but it isn't really that terrifying and seems fairly easily dealt with in the end.  Just another day at the office for the Justice League!

The closing scenes with the American flag-waving and the patriotic clamor made me laugh when I saw the credits and realized that most of the grunt work was done by Koreans (presumably because they work cheap).  Maybe a little of the  Justice League's rah-rah U-S-A! boosterism should carryover into keeping some animation jobs at home and not overseas, Warner Brothers?

And just why does Carol Ferris' eye color keep changing? I think Bats ought to look into this ... something strange is going on here... and where is Zook???",1319068800,,3014,4.755769230769231

I used to gripe and moan for DC to take today's writers and assign them Golden and Silver era stories. DC did NOT disappoint and raised the bar, IMO.

2817742,4,B000PFSYO4,"Every story has a beginning.

This adaptation of Darwyn Cooke's graphic novel tells the story of the formation of the Justice League in the 1950s.  With The House Un-American Activities Committee's hearings on un-American activities under way, the superheroes are under a great deal of scrutiny and suspicion.  With people running around in costumes and performing acts of questionable nature, one can see why the government had great concerns. If you were residing in this country, then your unconditional loyalty was to the red, white and blue.

This is a gripping 75 minutes.  You get the background story on the Martian Manhunter and a civil lesson in judging an individual solely by appearance. The origins of the Green Lantern are revealed as a cocky test pilot becomes the most powerful human alive.

The Flash, the outsider, becomes a true superhero when Superman is taken out of action by the mysterious and lethal Center, an ancient life form which has decided to eradicate the human race.  Flash's lack of self confidence to play with the ""big guys"" is well written.

Wonder Woman is truly depicted as an Amazon Princess.  Her dark side is allowed to flourish in an Indo-China village where Superman is appalled by what he discovers.

Batman has his savory moments.  A young Robin is introduced.

You have romance for the Flash and Green Lantern.  Lois Lane is there carrying her eternal torch for the Man of Steel.  There is an emotional scene with Lois which is well done.

There are brief cameos by President John Kennedy and Lex Luthor.  The title The New Frontier is from a speech that President Kennedy gave on July 15, 1960 in Los Angeles when he accepted his party nomination for President.

2817746,5,B000PFSYO4,"The time is the 1950s: full of Cold War tensions, McCarthyism paranoia plus the beginnings of both the space race and the Civil Rights movement. Imagine that caught in the middle of all this are superheroes such as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman  and potential ones like test pilot Hal Jordan, Barry Allan aka The Flash or the Martian Manhunter who hides away as Detective John Jones to name a few. Now imagine that a mysterious primordial being known only as the Center threatened to wipe humanity off the Earth and led these heroes to come together to form the Justice League? All these elements come together in the animated DVD film Justice League: The New Frontier.

The film features a phenomenal cast of voices for its characters. They include Kyle MacLachlan as Superman, Lucy Lawless as Wonder Woman, David Boreanaz as Hal Jordan, Miguel Ferrer as the Martain Manhunter, Neil Patrick Harris as the Flash, Phil Morris as government agent Faraday, Brooke Shields as aerospace executive Carol Ferris and Kyra Sedgwick as Lois Lane. There's only one mis-casted voice in the form of Jeremy Sisto as Batman whose voice seems rather odd for the role. Yet overall the voice cast all breathe a huge amount of life into their characters and properly compliment the animated versions of their characters.

As mentioned above, this is an animated film and it is all the better for it. Animation is all too often written off as being just for children but this film is far more then just that. The animation allows for the film to be visually retro yet exciting. This retro feel is not only in terms of how characters look with nods to the comics of the 1950s but with the design work that match the era well. The film has a PG-13 rating which means it has a bit more blood, mild language and violence then one might expect to see in an animated film though it should still be okay to watch with kids around. Perhaps the best example is one of the film's best sequences: its epilogue which combines JFK's ""new frontier"" speech with a montage of DC comic images and a stirring piece of music from composer Kevin Manthei. In short, the animation is a strength not a weakness of the film.

Last but not least is the story. Adapted from the  acclaimed graphic novel by Darwyn Cooke, the film puts these superheroes into the 1950s and watches as they live through, and are effected by, the events of that time such as the beginning of U.S involvement in Vietnam (when it was still known as Indochina). McCarthyism paranoia and the beginnings of both the space race and the Civil Rights movement. Yet no superhero movie would be complete without a super-villain and action sequences and this film has both. Its villain is the Center,  a mysterious primordial being who slowly makes its presence known as it works towards humanity's destruction. The film features a lot of action including a Korean War dogfight, Flash saving Las Vegas, an attempted Mars mission, battles with dinosaurs and all that's leading up to an epic climatic battle off Cape Canaveral. This combination of fact and fiction works to create a truly an epic tale

While it may be animated, to be perfectly honest I'm not sure a live action version could improve the film. With its combination of a phenomenal voice cast, retro design work, superb animation and an epic story. The result is a superhero film that is head and shoulders above many of its live action counterparts in the genre. If you want to see your favorite superheroes in a new light, then look towards The New Frontier.",1285200000,,3547,4.702093397745571
2817747,2,B000PFSYO4,"When not liking something and not enjoying it, I always try to give it the benefit of the doubt and wait a couple years before re-watching it again to see if my initial thoughts were true. Having said that and having watched the single-disc version of Justice League--A New Frontier a good couple years again after picking it up on an impulse buy, I have to say that I remain disappointed.

The movie itself was  hyped with having been based on the graphic novel hit. However, with such a drab main villain, I cannot see how such a work even warranted being made into a movie-- even one that's straight to DVD. As for the heroes, there seems to be an awkward balance between each major DC character. While expected main heroes like Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman are given a respectable amount of screen time, an odd amount of time has also been given to the Flash and the Green Arrow, who ultimately end up playing the more major roles near the film's end. However, with such key roles at the film's climax, one would expect something of a buildup for both characters. What viewers actually receive is something rather odd in which these characters are given some ample screen time, but it feels as if little to no progress in terms of character buildup has gone on at all-- sure, inciting incidents are one thing, but to actually have the character advance emotionally is another subject altogether.

Add to this the awkward insertion of minor swears to taunt the PG-13 label in the viewers' faces and you have one of the worst animated DC releases as of late.

The only thing keeping me from giving a 1-star rating is the documentary on the Justice League, telling of the comic's highs and lows throughout its many years. If it weren't for this little bonus, I would have sold this release years ago.",1280880000,,1806,4.58204334365325
2817748,5,B000PFSYO4,"One of my favorite entries in this movie line, The New Frontier is an adaptation of Darwyn Cooke's best selling graphic novel. Like Doomsday, it is severely shortened in terms of story but it doesn't feel as rushed as the other despite having more characters. Set in two of my favorite decades and in a time when the adventures in comics were actually enjoyable though a tad silly (I can't get enough of the Golden and Silver Age), New Frontier brings together seven of the world's mightiest heroes to form the greatest superhero group ever.

The story mainly focuses on Hal Jordan, The Flash and Martian Manhunter while Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman have smaller roles and Aquaman has a cameo near the end. In the prologue, an unseen author is possessed by a being called the Center, a living island that can spawn dinosaurs that plans to destroy mankind. Set during the fifties into 1960, the heroes that were present in WWII are now labeled as Communist and the Justice Society disbands. Superman signs on with the government while Batman continues in his ways and Wonder Woman heads back to Paradise Island. Hal, J'onn and Barry each have their own story that leads them to the climatic battle at the end. Despite not originating in the comics, the Center is a great threat to unite the heroes. Not fully shown until the end, the ominous voice that possesses several characters really builds it up as a force to be reckoned with. It's amazing how many heroes are featured in this, whether it be a large role or a fleeting cameo. Other than the Justice League, here's just a small list of the heroes that appear;

Green Arrow
The Blackhawks
Challengers of the Unknown
Adam Strange
The Justice Society
The Metal Men

Another great thing is that they tie in the year that each character appeared; Martian Manhunter (1954), The Flash (1956), Green Lantern (1959) and lastly, ending on their iconic encounter with Starro the Conqueror, the JLA (1960).

The animation is fantastic and, unlike Doomsday, the characters look nothing like their JL/JLU counterparts. Instead the characters reflect their Golden/Silver Age appearances. Batman first appears in his long ears and purple gloves costume but by the end, he's in his Silver Age costume, with Robin by his side and fighting in the Bat-Plane (looks better in the fifties than today). While he has no speaking lines, Green Arrow is beardless, sporting more of a Robin Hood look in his costume and flying his Arrow Plane during the climax. The cities, clothes and vehicles also reflect the time period fantastically. Also of note is the fact the characters actually go through wardrobe changes throughout the film instead of staying in one outfit (except Superman and Wonder Woman) as is the usual in animation.

Andrea Romano unites an all-star talent voice cast that is nothing short of perfection. Technically playing the character back in the nineties, Lucy Lawless is excellent as Wonder Woman and is probably the only person (other than Lynda Carter) I would like to see play the role in a feature film. Jeremy Sisto brings a deeper gravelly voice to Batman compared to what we've heard in the past while Kyle MacLachlan is great as '50s Superman, displaying an authoritative voice that Baldwin failed to do in Doomsday. David Boreanaz is wonderful as Hal Jordan (the Green Lantern who should be featured more prominently in recent animated projects), able to convey Hal as a man who is willing to fight for his country. Neil Patrick Harris and Miguel Ferrer are good with Flash and the Martian Manhunter, bringing their own interpretations to the characters while retaining a bit of what we've heard in the past.",1279929600,4,3673,4.861022364217252
2817749,5,B000PFSYO4,"I simply have no explanation as to why this has gotten only an aggregate 3.5 star rating.  This is one of the best animated super hero movies that I've seen.  I was familiar with Darwyn Cooke's book by reputation, but I had not read it (still haven't - but I plan on checking it out).  I knew that it was an attempt to recreate the Silver Age DC superheroes for a more contemporary audience.  I got a huge kick out of the film that was based on it.  The joy of the film was seeing the current major members of the JLA placed in the context of the Cold War and McCarthyism.  It isn't a perfect creation of the time, since certain characters who were JLA stalwarts like Aquaman and the Atom (though both Professor Ray Palmer and Arthur Curry make a brief appearances) do not appear, but all in all it is a fun affair.  In the context of the story there are both established heroes like the Big Three (Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman) and semi-genesis stories of the Flash, the Green Lantern, and J'onn J'onzz.  But the great thing is that the story doesn't get bogged down in the origins stories, but instead actually move the film along.

If you are a fan of DC comics and the JLA, this is definitely worth checking out.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and I can't imagine a fan of comics who wouldn't.  With the caveat that there are many comics fundamentalists, who get inconceivably narrow in what they will accept as representations of the originals.  But, then, they are usually just about impossible to please anyway.",1278892800,2,1518,4.4601449275362315
2817750,4,B000PFSYO4,"New Frontier is an epic DC Comics series that chronicles the origins of the Justice League of America amidst the dynamic era that ushered in the Kennedy administration.  Now made into an animated feature, it effectively captures the spirit of the 1950's Silver Age of comics.  It's also the most adult oriented storylines here, focusing less on action and more on plot development.  The story begins with a ""Watchmen"" effect as each Superhero struggles with their purpose and identity during the McCarthy era.  Batman is in hiding (more than usual), Wonder Woman leads a group of female rebels in Korea, and the Flash is pursued by the US Government. Superman signed on as an agent of the US, but doesn't know where his loyalties lie.  New Frontier  also covers the origin stories of Hal Jordan (the Green Lantern), and J'onn J'onzz, (the Martian Manhunter).

The villain in New Frontier is the weakest point of the film, as it uses the `unexplainable alien evil that's existed for centuries' motif that was so popular in the Silver Age.  But New Frontier isn't really about the villain; it's about the characters and their transformation from one age to another. The art and acting is all great and really embodies the time period they're shooting for. The voicework is a mixed bag.  Neil Patrick Harris as The Flash is a delight, but Batman left me missing Kevin Conroy (TAS) or Rino Romano (The Batman series).  The action is well handled here, though kind of odd because of the villain.  Overall I was pleasantly impressed with New Frontier and highly recommend it as New Frontier establishes the foundation for the new launch of DC Animated Films.",1278720000,,1652,4.843416370106762

2817753,5,B000PFSYO4,"After DC's middle of the road Superman: Doomsday DVD, we get this fantastic addition to our DVD library. Justice League: the New Frontier, based on the Graphic Novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Absolute-DC-The-New-Frontier/dp/1401210805/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Absolute DC: The New Frontier</a>, is a ""What if?"" Story asking ""What if the DC's Superheroes existed during the Cold War?"" But it also tells the origin of Hal Jordan, the Green Lantern. And it all builds up to a climax that could only be described as ""biblical.""

You can tell a meticulous amount of love went into the production of this animated feature. The animation is very close to the art of the source material, and the voice cast is very strong. To me, David Boreanaz IS the voice of Hal Jordan. And they squeezed every detail they could from the Graphic Novel into the movie. It's not perfect enough to replace the original story, but the material that was dropped doesn't hamper the movie. What was cut: the Suicide Squad, the Challenger of the Unknown, the Viking Prince, most of the JSA and John Henry story.

What makes this DVD a perfect five is they extras on the Two-Disk version. We get two commentary track, one with the filmmakers, and another one with Darwyn Cooke, the original writer/artist from the graphic novel. Two entertaining documentaries, ""The History of the Justice League,"" and ""The Legion of Doom: Pathology of the Super Villain,"" as a comic book fan, I really enjoy these and I've watched them over and over. Plus, a featurette ""Comic Book Commentary: Homage to the New Frontier,"" which is the creator, Darwyn Cooke, detailing what was cut during the adaptation from the Graphic Novel to Film.

Finally, on this 2-Disk Special Edition, three episodes for Justice League Unlimited. ""Dark Heart,"" where an unidentified alien menace threatens the earth, which is a nice parallel for the movie. ""To Another Shore,"" which features the Viking Prince. And ""Task Force X"" which a group of villains calling themselves Task Force X, AKA the Suicide Squad, infiltrate the JLA headquarters.

This is a perfect 5 out of 5. Maybe, not so good for young kids, because it takes place during the Cold War, so they might not ""get it."" But, for us older types, this is a great movie with awesome extras. I can't recommend it enough, and if you like this, maybe take the plunge and look up the source material.",1272240000,4,2436,5.067331670822942

2817756,1,B000PFSYO4,"I bought this movie thinking I would enjoy it like every other DC movie I own or have seen (except the '90 Batman movies). It starts out with someone calling themselves ""The Centre"" and how he started out as a lifeform who is now the greatest of all the lifeforms on earth. This, ""The Centre"", is obviously revering to God. He also states the beginning of life where everything ""evolved""; more garbage! There is no proof of evolution and they have to keep changing their beliefs on it because of how many times this or that has been proven wrong. Anyway, the voice acting isn't too good either; it just seems like the wrong people are voicing each person. Their costumes look ugly too. Superman is a whiny idiot and the entire story should be about something they know. At one point Batman is fighting some...priests? Who are dressed in purple cultish robes. Batman is fighting them because, ""The Centre"" needs energy or something and so the priests are trying to kill a young child. Further more, they are fighting in an obvious church (cross on outside of building, giant statue of Christ hung on the cross). After seeing this movie I immediately destroyed it. I hate this movie, not just for their bad portrayal of Christians and how the world was created, but the designs of each superhero looks like they're from the '60's. WonderWoman is a barbaric idiot who enjoys letting men get killed, Superman whines and bemoans his thoughts to Lois and Wonder Woman, And Batman is speechless and a crappy fighter. The best part of this movie is the scenes with Flash, The Real Green Lantern (Hal Jordan) and Martian Manhunter. I would not recommend this movie to Satan; though he'd really like it.",1268524800,5,1693,4.684563758389261
2817757,5,B000PFSYO4,"Based on Darwyn Cooke's Elseworlds mini-series, this was the second of the DC Universe line of direct-to-video animated movies based on DC Comics. The movie has no ties to the Justice League/Justice League Unlimited TV series or the Justice League: Crisis On Two Earths movie. In fact, the actual ""Justice League"" barely appears in the movie except for a quick shot at the end featuring the founding members of this timeline's JLA.

Set in an alternate 1950s, the former Golden Age heroes such as the Justice Society have gone into hiding after being persecuted by McCarthyism. Superman and Wonder Woman are now agents of the American government, and helping to end the Korean War. Elsewhere, the shapechanging Martian, J'onn J'onzz, was accidently brought to Earth, and assumes the identity of Gotham City detective, John Johns. Former Air Force pilot Hal Jordan is recruited by Ferris Industries, which is secretly part of the U.S. military planning a manned flight to Mars after J'onn's initial existence is made known to them. During the flight, Hal realizes the rocket is carrying weapons to Mars as an accident causes it to explode in space, but he is rescued by Superman. However, J'onn is captured by the government. As this is going on, a mysterious force known as The Centre has been influencing criminals and others throughout the world. Aware of the impending threat, a Green Lantern heads to Earth, but is injured when Hal's rocket blew up, so he passes his ring over to him even though Hal has no idea how to use it. The Centre then reveals itself to be a giant flying island that literally has dinosaurs crawling out if it, and attacks Paradise Island. Wonder Woman barely escapes to warn Superman and the others, but Supes himself is taken down by it. This leaves the task up to the remaining heroes, including Flash, Batman, Green Arrow, J'onn, Adam Strange, the Challengers of the Unknown, and the Blackhawks. With the help of Ray Palmer's(the Atom)shrinking tech, and Hal Jordan emerging as the new Green Lantern at the last possible second, they manage to send the dying Centre out into space. Following this, the heroes are exonerated, and a new team is formed under the logo of the Justice League.

This film stands out pretty well as far as a home video release. The animation is above the par of its TV counterparts featuring Bruce Timm's crew, although Darwyn Cooke himself played a large part in the movie's production. Andrea Romano's selection of voice actors stand out too, with David Boreanaz as Hal Jordan, Neil Patrick Harris as Flash, Kyle MacLachlan as Superman, and Lucy Lawless is perfect as the more-Amazonian-than-normal Wonder Woman.

2817759,4,B000PFSYO4,"A strange thing, my ever-growing respect for Justice League: The New Frontier.  It was a title I actually preordered before its release in great anticipation.  I tore into and viewed it moments after it was released and came away with a shrug.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it well enough but having just completed the final season of The Justice League Unlimited, I fear I went into New Frontier with expectations higher than even Superman's capable of flying.

Now here it is a year and a half after the fact and I'm returning to the film once more.  Why the resurgence in interest you ask? Well both Wonder Woman and Green Lantern First Flight contained a commentary featurette about the translation of New Frontier from graphic novel (2004) into animated film (2008).  So well assembled was this DVD extra that I actually decided to dig out my Two-Disc Edition set of New Frontier to absorb every little detail once more.  Conclusion: this is a far better story than I initially realized.  Almost like good cheese or fine wine, it has aged with a certain charm.

The error in my ways the first time through was to enter the film with expectations of an animated feature film of Bruce Timm and company's Justice League.  The uniqueness of The New Frontier is found right in Darwyn Cooke's graphic novel on which the film is based in his homage to DC Comics' Silver Age.  Yes the characters look different than what we're collectively used to but the beauty contained within runs much deeper than the superficial.

Taking place in the early-mid 1950s, The New Frontier drops its viewer into the Korean War through the eyes of fighter pilot, Hal Jordan. At this point in time, the Justice Society has already been disbanded while the United States itself not only fears but actually fights to contain the spread of communism. Superman, Wonder Woman and Flash are already fighting crime individually (so their back stories are completely omitted in this film save for a bit of retrospective decision making on Wonder Woman's home island).

The backbone of this tale centers on a primordial life form known only as The Center, which is Cook's ingeniously clever way of integrating DC comics' oft-referenced Dinosaur Island. This ancient being is so vast that it acts as a self-contained ecosystem covered with extinct life forms on which to feed. Monitoring the rise of mankind, The Center finally decides that we have become both violent and intelligent-enough (upon discovering nuclear energy) to pose a threat to its existence. Like most beings on our planet struggling for survival, it decides to annihilate the threat of humanity and begins portraying its cryptic plan by possessing the minds of the weak and evil. Indeed some of these scenes are downright creepy both in the novel and in the film.

While the viewer is technically being carried along the meteoric rise of Hal Jordan's transformation into the Green Lantern, the arrival and foundation of J'onn J'onzz (Martian Manhunter) is also a critical part of the story's development. Interestingly, many of the film's supporting cast actually consists of classic DC comic characters in various phases of their lives.

It appears the most common complaint to the animated incarnation is its pacing and indeed the final quarter of the film really does feel rushed. It is obvious that the show's creative team struggled to compress such an epic story into a 75-minute production. Make no mistake, the flow of the story arc and the details presented are 100% complete, it's just that several Leaguers (Green Arrow, Adam Strange, Aqua-man, etc.) appear but do little more than that. It's sad really that such tight time restrictions were placed upon this first-class production as it simply baffles the imagination to envision what this work could have been.  It probably could have been an ongoing series the likes of which could compete with the DCAU's Justice League and JL Unlimited.

Casting is, for the most part, stellar as expected from Andrea Romano. Miguel Ferrer as Martian Manhunter, David Boreanaz as Hal Jordan, Neil Patrick Harris as Allen, Kyle MacLachlan as Superman, Lucy Lawless as Wonder Woman, Kyra Sedgwick as Lois Lane, Brooke Shields as Carol Ferris, Vicki Lewis as Iris. I know I'm in the minority on this one, but believe it or not I found Jeremy Sisto's vocal work as Batman to be a bit too deep (picture Vin Diesel with a cold) but serviceable. Perhaps I'm just a bit partial to Kevin Conroy's years of beautiful vocal work in the DCAU in my assessment.

The animation is very similar to past and recent DC Animated Universe efforts, which is to say beautifully done with special consideration to separate the vintage Silver Era uniforms from the contemporary outfits.  It takes a little time to get used to the look but (and especially if you compare it to the pages of the graphic novel) this is a first class effort all the way.

For a Warner release, this set comes stacked with special features. Disc 1 breaks down with an excellent documentary called Super Heroes United!: The Complete Justice League History, full audio commentary (2 separate tracks) with the show's creative team and the graphic novel's writer Darwyn Cooke. There's also an interesting look at DC's feature film release: Batman Gotham Knight (which was to follow).

The second disc contains an equal-but-opposite documentary entitled The Legion of Doom: The Pathology of the Super Villain, which in my opinion the two documentaries make the set worth the price of admission by themselves. Additionally, the second disc contains a fun featurette that compares the film directly to the comic book and 3 episodes of the contemporary Justice League (Dark Heart, To Another Shore, and Task Force X).

All in all, this is a very solid interpretation of a spectacular graphic novel. My only complaint is the time restriction that 1 hour & 15 minutes places on the writer's ability to establish the full backstory of the League. The attention to detail is second to none (after all, Bruce Timm and Andrea Romano were involved).

An appreciation for Darwyn Cooke's graphic novel of the same name is helpful but not a prerequisite.  I've actually gone about discovering the work backward (film first, graphic novel after) and found many of the themes and grand story arcs to be incredibly brilliant.  In going back to take a look at his own personal favorite DC Comics era, Cooke managed to put together a story that ties real world events with the superhero mythos nearly flawlessly.  The inspiration that drove him into attempting such an ambitious project is apparent in nearly every panel on every page.

The animated version is a must for any DCAU fan, individuals who enjoyed the excellent graphic novel on which the material is based, and just about anyone who appreciates smart story telling in the animated medium.",1253404800,,6872,4.917026793431288

There are political messages within the movie which spoiled that ""golden age"" feel for me.  Yes, those old comics had anti-communist leanings, but this movie's message was clearly the antithesis of that era, or should I say ""rejection"" of that era.

2817767,4,B000PFSYO4,"Justice League - The New Frontier is an adaptation of the award-winning comic series by Darwyn Cooke. It retells the origin of the Justice League against the backdrop of the 1950s cold war and McCarthyism. A new generation of heroes must come together to defeat an approaching alien threat known as 'The Centre'.

This is a very good entry in DC's new Original Animated Movies series. Like any adaptation some scenes have been trimmed and others tweaked to streamline the narrative, but the result stays true to Cooke's original series and packs in lots of drama and action. The animation is excellent - it really helps that Cooke's original art style translates very well to the screen, and stylistically the piece nails the period look its going for. Definitely some of the best animation yet to come out of the DC line, which has been consistently high in quality. The voice cast is an ensemble of animation veterans and celebrities like Lucy Lawless (who else would you get for Wonder Woman?)  and David Boreanaz (Hal Jordan).

If there's one complaint, and this applies to every Direct-to-DVD release in both the DC and Marvel lines, it's that the film could stand to be longer. The story is very tightly paced at 75 minutes, and sometimes it jumps rapidly between multiple scenes and characters. There are multiple plot threads that run through this film - from the establishing of Superman and Batman to origin stories for Martian Manhunter and Green Lantern. The Flash feels somewhat shortchanged (if you haven't read the graphic novel, it's not made clear until the end that he's still a relative unknown), and Wonder Woman's role could be defined as small but vital. Aquaman's cameo at the end seems to come from nowhere until you realize the film is about setting up the Silver Age of DC comic history.

If all that seems a bit confusing, the film definitely comes together nicely in the end, and I've gained more appreciation for it on repeated viewings. The single-disc DVD comes with two commentaries (one from the creative staff, one from Darwyn Cooke) and both are very informative.

2817771,5,B000PFSYO4,"Let me start off by saying this film is PURE JOY for silver age comic fans. It's not hard to get excited while watching your favorite DC heroes with all their classic retro glory featured in a mature/intelligent/emotionally gripping story. It makes an excellent companion piece to the award winning graphic novel by Darwyn Cooke. (who was also actively involved in this production)

Even though it was necessary to excise much of the story because of time constraints, Bruce Timm and co. still manage to capture the essence of the piece in a limited running time. In fact, the length is my only real complaint. There's no reason why Warner should not approve a larger budget for these fine DC Universe titles. A lengthier running time than 70 minutes should be common sense when adapting an epic yarn such as The New Frontier. Still, the animators make great use of what they have and the running time is only a minor complaint. Here's hoping for an eventual ""director's cut"" with added material.

As I've said, I do enjoy nearly everything about this film. First off, the animation is very rich and picturesque. Definitely well above your Saturday morning quality. The retro/Golden Age/Silver Age character designs are breathtaking. Seeing Superman look as if he could be the same Superman from the Fleischer cartoons and Batman appearing as if he leaped from the pages of Bob Kane's original comics is just beyond cool. I prefer these designs to those in the Justice League/Justice League Unlimited cartoons. As for the voice acting, the surprising choice of actors do a very inspired job. You have to remember that they're voicing the Golden/Silver Age versions of these characters, and they absolutely NAIL it. Kyle MacLachlan is perfect as this era's Superman. Jeremy Sisto also puts in a first-rate performance as Bob Kane's Batman, it's a complete 180 from Kevin Conroy and that's exactly what this version of the character needs. Lucy Lawless, Neil Patrick Harris, Miguel Ferrer, Brooke Shields, David Boreanaz, etc. also do exceptional work in bringing their characters to life.

No offense to Kyle Rayner or John Stewart, but as we all know Hal Jordan is THE Green Lantern. The New Frontier is one of the best depictions of this character in all of comics and likewise with the film adaptation. It's great to finally see Hal Jordan given some animated justice as a deep, compelling character. This film succeeds in impacting the viewer on an emotional level, there's more than a few tear jerking moments for DC comics fans in this personal/engaging story. It's all complimented by an uplifting, sweeping score that fits the source material like a brightly colored glove.

And just like the graphic novel on which it's based, this IS intended for older audiences so don't start whining if you buy this DVD for little 5 year old Timmy. Looking at some of the 1 star ""reviews"" on this page, I see far too many pathetic morons/incompetent parents who bought this film for their 5 year olds without looking at the PG-13 rating and descriptors. I wonder if these automatons somehow think that the film would be appropriate for their small child just because it has Batman, Superman and other heroes on the cover? Do these idiots also buy Watchmen, The Dark Knight Returns, Superman: Red Son, Marvel Knights, The Ultimates and other mature comics for their children and then complain how inappropriate they are? Do they let their children watch HBO's Spawn animated series or CN's Adult Swim and then endlessly bitch about how explicit the programs are for their kids? Or maybe these are the very same ignorant wastes of flesh who took their children to see The Dark Knight (best film of the year) and then proceeded to moan and bellow about how dark and gritty the film is and call Heath's Joker ""Satanic"". LMFAO! So of course just disregard any negative rating that uses the PG-13 content as a basis for their opinion, Amazon's overall rating for this movie would definitely be higher.

In conclusion, this is a superb film and excellent adaptation of Darwyn Cooke's modern classic. The 2 disc DVD also includes some very worthwhile extras such as featurettes on the Justice League's history, the Legion of Doom, and commentary by the filmmakers and Darwyn Cooke. Do yourself and every other comics fan a favor by supporting quality productions such as this. 2008 is definitely the year of the comic book film.

Other than that, excellent, violent, mature, fun to just see a different and decidedly retro reworking of the characters we like so much.  People die badly, Wonderwoman is a bit edgier.
The voice casting is very good.  I'll always prefer Kevin Conroy, out of faithfulness, but Jeremy Sisto does a very good Batman.  He doesn't do very much in this film though.  The writer of the graphic novel was more interested in Green Lantern.

By far the best part of this DVD is the History of the Justice League featurette.  In my opinion it was better than the film itself, and practically worth the price on its own.  It is much more accurate and indepth than many of the sloppy thrown-together featurettes you're used to.

2817775,3,B000PFSYO4,"I've never really been a fan of the animated comic book movies, but I decided to give it a try as still being a fan of the heroes I find the Justice League interesting. What I was given was good, but nothing amazing and it certainly didn't change my perception of these types of animated movies.

The story is set in the 1950's and focuses around the original formation of the Justice League of America. Batman and Detective John Jones are trying to solve the mystery of the Centre, Superman and Wonder Woman are soldiers for the US Army, Flash is trying to live a normal life with Special Agent King Farraday always on his tail and Hal Jordan has been selected for a special space mission to Mars. The whole centre mystery primarily focuses around the Martian Manhunter and the birth of the Green Lantern. It's a good little story, but seems to be a film that's trying too hard to appeal to all audiences.

Be warned, the violence is quite graphic and at times the language used is quite colourful. I guess the writers and animators felt that this would help create a higher level of adult realism to the film. On the contrary in fact, it came across as forced and quite ridiculous as a whole.

It's an enjoyable film none the less, but I feel kind of dirty even calling it a film or movie as it's just over an hour long and in my eyes a true film has to be 90 minutes or more. I can imagine that if you're a fan of the old school comic saga or TV shows then this is a film you will love, but to me it was just nothing ground breaking.",1220140800,3,1536,4.217687074829932

The plot moves along very well without omitting anything important.  The surprising thing was that they were able to introduce so many characters so well without making it heavy.  Those who are fans of these comics will not be disappointed because they will not have to put up with pointless aspects of back-story that take away from the plot. while those who are new to DC will be captured by compelling characters that they will want to learn more about.  I strongly recommend it.,1219276800,3,612,4.62962962962963
2817777,5,B000PFSYO4,"Since I was a child, I have always been a big fan of the ""Justice League"" comic book series. I actually grew up reading Justice League, Justice Society and Legion of Super Heroes comic books from the 70's and 80's and even up to the 90's.

For me, it was the comic to get because all the major DC Super Heroes were featured. You had Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, the Flash, Green Arrow and many others. So, when you bought these comic books, it was a bang for your .25 or .65 cents (depending when you started reading comic books) unlike the several dollar per issue cost that they are now.

As for ""Justice League: The New Frontier"", this animated film is based on Darwyn Cooke's award-winning graphic novel featuring the Justice League during the Cold War. The heroes under government suspicion, the end of the Korean war and the heroes created with a look that looked unique for that era (despite it being created in several years ago).

This animated film continues DC's continued work to feature our heroes but not cookie cutter as in Saturday's morning cartoons. From the Justice League Unlimited series that was on the Cartoon Network to the last DVD release of ""Superman Doomsday"", ""Justice League: The New Frontier"" continues animation for adults.

The film centers around the super heroes as Superman is loyal to the government (despite the government not trusting the heroes); Wonder Woman as the Amazon blood thirsty fighter; Batman as the dark knight that is labeled as an anti-hero, thus being a good guy, is looked at as an enemy due to media portrayal. The Flash as the latest new Hero with super speed who is just emerging onto the scene and the series introduces Hal Jordan (aka the Green Lantern) and how he becomes the one of Earth's heroes and Martian Manhunter, brought to this world but disliked because he is an alien.

Needless to say that each hero has their storyline tied together but the main heroes focused on are Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter and the Flash. Hal Jordan as the risk taker, Martian Manhunter aka Jon Jonzz trying to assimilate into American culture via trying too be human and the Flash who feels his power of super speed is not so important.

You do also see a few cameos by other heroes such as the Blackhawks, Adam Strange, John Henry and more.

But all unite together to take on the toughest enemy Earth has ever faced but can the heroes work together despite their differences and will the US government work with them.

All in all, ""Justice League: The New Frontier"" is a refreshing animated film, something different, that DC fans will just enjoy. It's unique and something that many people familiar to original comic book series may not be accustomed to but moreso, to watch something that is for mature audiences. For example, Hal Jordan having to fight for his life and having to kill and have the blood of the enemy splatter all over him after shooting him with a gun. Again, this is not for the kiddies.

As for the DVD, the special features are simply awesome.

For one, the featurette on ""Super Heroes United! The Complete Justice League History"" is probably a documentary that I would have bought the DVD just for it. Interviews with past and present DC Justice League writers and history on each heroes and overall, pretty cool featurette on the Justice League. Simply awesome.

The exclusive sneak peak to ""Batman Gothic Knight"" left me giddy as DC chose to work with Japanese anime creators to create the upcoming Batman animated release.

I have listened to Darwyn Cooke's audio commentary as he talked about the film, the differences between the film and the graphic novel. Actually pretty cool to hear the original creator of the graphic novel chime in on the animated series.

As for the animation, I felt that the animation in correlation with the era this animated film takes place worked quite well. The voice acting is superb with voice acting by well known actors and actresses David Boreanaz (""Bones"", ""Angel""), Brooke Shields, Lucy Lawless, Kyra Sedgwick, Neil Patrick Harris, Jeremy Sisto and Kyle Maclachlan.

2817778,2,B000PFSYO4,"I grew up reading Marvel. I was only interested in the main DC characters like Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman. And I think there's a reason why they're the three largest characters on the DVD cover while everybody else is just backdrop.

I enjoyed about 5min of this movie. The rest of it was SO BORING!!! And I think this movie is proof that a live action JLA movie wouldn't work. There are too many characters, too much jumping around, and most of the characters are so bland and pointless that you just don't care. There was not enough Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman in this movie to save it. I know the Green Lantern has a big following. Why, I don't know. The Flash seems cool but here he's just dull.

I also hated the artwork on the characters. The background artists did a great job. But the character art director did a terrible job. All of the characters have zero detail. They're all blocky with square fingers. It's the same as what you get on Cartoon Network.

I wasn't a fan of JLA before this movie and I'm certainly not one now. I think movies of the individual characters might be better though. Still waiting on the Wonder Woman movie.",1217548800,,1159,4.4575471698113205

I found that only 2 minutes or less into the film - this animated cartoon - supposedly geared toward children, was really only a form of Grand Theft Auto or Mortal Combat set in superhero facade.  It became graphically violent in mere seconds.  Not for children by any stretch of the imagination. It does not even represent the true nature of the original episodes.  I do not appreciate when cartoonists make movies based on loved characters that are twisted into a version of the new ultra-violent society we live in.

So many of us know that comic book heroes are mythic and their stories often have dark and tragic origins. On this level, ""Frontier"" does not disappoint a true fan. The story-lines are complex intersections of pride, glory and loss and the villain, voiced by the incomparable Keith David, is a menace like none other.

Against the backdrop of the post WWII cold war, Timm and company suppose the creation of the Justice League as an answer to fear, cynicism and lost hope. They succeed on all levels.

I don't know why the studios don't rely more on animation writers for comic book films. BTAS, JLU and Superman clearly show animation writers understand and love these characters and would never disservice them or their fans.

2817782,3,B000PFSYO4,"If you were an avid comic collector in the 1970s and 1980s, the coolest thing to ever hit theaters at the time (besides Star Wars) was Superman. It was a monumental achievement in storytelling and special effects, especially on the big screen because most other iconic superheroes existed through cartoons (Superfriends, Spiderman and His Amazing Friends). Anything with live-action at the time was relegated to the small screen as a hokey series (Batman, The Incredible Hulk, Flash) or TV movie (Spiderman, Captain America).

By the late 80s and early 90s, Hollywood began to truly recognize the potential worth of bringing comic characters to the big screen beginning with its take on Batman. Though the Superman franchise was run into the ground (1987), Batman did pretty well, surviving a change in its lead actor (1995), even if the third time (1997) wasn't a charm. Before audiences could even mourn the decline of the Batman and Superman franchises, along came X-Men (2000), closely followed by Spiderman (2002). Thanks to the care taken to fully develop its characters, the wonderfully crafted story lines, and the amazing CGI, it was as if Hollywood finally got it. And if it hadn't been for the success of these two previous franchises, there would have been no Fantastic Four, no restart of the Superman franchise, no Hulk movies, and especially no Batman movies by Chris Nolan.

In the wake of Polar Express, the Golum of Peter Jackson's movies, Beowulf, and the last two Hulk pictures, it's time for Hollywood to take the same caring approach to an all-CGI film when transferring comic heroes from page to screen. Why? The reason is simple: the cartoon form of yesterday looks tired and old. Perhaps this reviewer has been spoiled by Pixar's beautifully rendered movies; perhaps it's also anime films such as Appleseed: Ex Machina that have me, as a viewer, yearning for something more spectacular for the superheroes I grew up with.

Justice League: The New Frontier was a masterstroke of storytelling. Set in the 1950s, the story is taken from Darwyn Cooke's 2004 DC miniseries. Though the film could have been even longer to incorporate more from the original storyline, all the necessary elements are present to show how these super beings came together to form the Justice League. And its message of coming together to work towards a common goal, regardless of differences, resonates throughout the picture.

The artwork of the original series in print echoed the Silver Age of comics. If only that same motif could have transferred more successfully to the film adaptation. Admittedly, especially when it comes to storytelling about beings with super powers, the story can be told much easier (and cheaper) in cartoon form. But now it's time to take that medium to a whole other level. It's time to give it some super powers of its own.",1215993600,,2855,4.991596638655462
2817783,1,B000PFSYO4,"This movie was a huge disppointment especially being produced after the well-made Justice League and Justice League Unlimited Animated Series.  I must admit that I have not read the Darwyn Cooke series upon which this movie is based, and I am judging this movie solely on its merits (or lack thereof).  One thing that I am learning about Warner Brothers is that the freedom of being able to release animated movies straight to DVD is an invitation to show gratuitous violence and bloodshed (especially the bloodshed).  A warning to parents: the opening scene of this film shows a man blowing his head off.  The movie goes quickly downhill from there.  Now I am not against stories containing action and suspense.  But what differentiates DVD movies like this one and Superman:Doomsday from previous animated material is that the storytelling was much better and stylish in the previous material.  Sophisticated viewers do not need bloodshed and death shown frame to frame to understand the plot.  Such disregard for style and plot is an insult to viewers and comic book fans alike, and it often appears as if the bloodshed is a substitute for plot and character development.  Speaking of character development, the so-called heroes in this film are portrayed (with the exception of Superman and the Flash) as egotistic, whiny and self-centered.  The most disturbing and disgraceful portrayal is that of Wonder Woman.  Instead of the strong, graceful and majestic character that she has been in the comics for years, she is portrayed as a bullying, angry and atypically violent jerk.  In one scene, she condones the killing of a group of soldiers (that were rendered unarmed) by a group of villagers that were previously tortured by the soldiers.  The very idea that the Wonder Woman created many years ago by William Moulton Marston to fight war and aggression would be twisted into a brute that is no different than the men she was appointed to bring peace to is an affront and an insult to the character.  The whole movie appears to be a launching point for a potential Green Lantern series.  However, his appearance is so late in the picture that viewers will lose interest in the film before it happens. The villain is just some nameless alien blob that gets into the minds of weak people and makes them do bad things.  (Maybe it got into the minds of the writers of this film).  We never know where it comes from or why it does what it does.  It just does its thing (and predictably renders every other hero useless) long enough  for Green Lantern to make his appearance.  Let's hope that the upcoming Wonder Woman DVD (in 2009) is much better and more respectful of its source material than this piece of trash.  If DC wanted to do a Green Lantern story, his history and origin is rich enough to warrant his own film.  I really wish that DC Comics animation would just make good and well-written adaptations of the individual heroes (such as Shazam, Aquaman and Green Lantern) than subjecting us to this bloodthirsty garbage.",1215907200,4,3031,4.8108108108108105

Set mostly in the 50s and featuring the DC hero fashion of that period the paranoid US government have blackballed all superheroes, claiming that they have something to hide beside their identities and dismiss them as Commies. The Flash is even ridiculed because of his RED costume. But soon they will have to come together again to fight a common enemy when (and I'm not kidding) a large floating, living island of dinosaurs called The Center plans to wipe out humanity.

I've read hundreds of comic books in my life and that is seriously the dumbest crap I have ever heard. Every other part of JL: TNF is far superior to this 'Center' nonsense, so it's such a shame that the main plot drags it down. I especially like the story about the Martian Manhunter and the Flash.

The best part about this disk was the special features, which include an interesting history of DC.  However, the movie itself was bad.  It seemed to use mild profanity just to earn a PG-13 rating to attract an adult audience. I found the film to be quite childish, and, to be frank, cheesy.

This movie had everything I hoped for: blood, plot, action, great dialogue, unanswered questions, some adult language, and everything in between. I found myself constantly pausing it to say ""Wow!""

2817799,3,B000PFSYO4,"For those of you that grew up reading the JLA during the 60's ""Silver Age"" of comics, it's great seeing the old characters back again. It's the Green Lantern and Flash we all knew and loved. Things have obviously changed a lot since then and it was a good feeling of nostalgia just going back to those glory years of the JLA again.

Unfortunately, the storyline isn't all that exciting. It's a short story (as most animated flicks are) and it leaves you wanting to see more.

And while I don't mind that they took a few liberties in introducing HOW the characters came to be (for instance Hal Jordan's Green Lantern origin), I didn't like some of the things that were added (perhaps from later years). For example, in the original Silver Age of comics I don't remember J'onn J'onzz the Martian Manhunter as being able to ""shape shift"". Was that one of his original traits? (Maybe I'm just forgetting this after all these years.) I always pictured him as basically another Superman type but lots weaker due to his inability to deal with Fire and of course his inability to fly back home to his home planet of Mars.

Anyway, even though the storyline wasn't all that great, it was wonderful seeing the Silver Agers back in action again! If you're a Silver Age reader, check it out, if just for that fact.",1208995200,,1302,4.531914893617022

Second, I will say this has a big name cast to fill the boots of these Characters. Kyle Maclachlan bring a different to Superman. Neil Patrick Harris (who did the MTV version of Spiderman) is the Flash. Lucy Lawless (Xena) proves she is a vocal amazon as Wonder Woman. David Borenaz (Buffy's favorite vamp Angel) lifts the chracter of Hal Jordan to new heights. Miguel Ferrer and Kyra Sedgwick are wasted in the roles of the Martian Manhunter and Lois Lane. Law and Order Jeremy Sisco put a new spin on Batman.

They also have vocal stunt casting of great audio talent who have a throw away line or three. People like Joe Mantegna, Phillip Morris and Brooke Shields are part of this large cast, but are wasted with a few throw away lines.

The story is faithful to Darwyn Cooke's two part graphic novel. He also does one of the two audio commentary tracks. It still seems too rushed.  Bruce Timm could have taken a bigger risk and done this as a three hour cartoon project, but I will take what I have

The production is a higher standard then most cartoons made for video, but when you push the envelope like Superman Doomsday (aka the Death of Superman), you need is push the time and the story past 80 minutes.

I was disappointed by the slow pacing, the unremarkable villain, and the lack of chemistry among the characters.  The voice talent here, seemingly upgraded from the regular actors from the regular series, is so lackluster.  I like many of the actors, but found their voice acting to be so uninspired.

Having watched this, I wondered what made Bruce Timm's original JL and JLU series so good.  I think the answer is its concise format:  each episode (or double ep) tells a story and gets out.  ""New Frontier"" does in this movie format what perhaps Timm would do in the first and last five minutes of his episode(s).  The rest is just wasted time.  I don't recommend any JL or JLU fans to watch this -- and yes, I agree, this (unlike JL and JLU) really is not for young children.  Sorry Hal Jordan, but ""Outstanding!""?

I was only able to read Vol. 1 out of the two trades released from the DC comic series, and the trade was very good.  The movie glazed over several plot points in the interest of time but what we have left is 75 minutes of heart-felt story that takes our favorite DC characters and adds new dimensions to them.  At it's heart, New Frontier is mainly Hal Jordan's story.  Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman all play their roles but I think Hal is the core of this story.  It tells the story of how the DC heroes reacted to the world giving in to the Red Scare during the beginning of the Cold War years and shows how they deal with it.  The main antagonist of the story is a being called The Centre, an ancient creature that has been on Earth since before the dinosaurs and hates that humans have taken it over.  We also get The Flash and Martian Manhunter heavily engrained in the story.  And with the PG-13 rating, the violence is not held back.  Plus, the DVD bonus features are great!

And padding the disk with extra JLU episodes doesn't help, since the story itself is a total departure from the version depicted in the earlier JLA storylines regarding the formation of the league and the advent of the Watchtower.

I am also a fan of Bruce Timm's' various animated treatments of Batman, Superman, and the Justice League.  This ranks right up alongside those top flight efforts.  And the casting was dead-on.  Neil Patrick Harris as Barry Allen/Flash, David Boreanaz as Hal Jordan/Green Lantern, and Jeremy Sisto as Batman (Bruce Wayne is curiously absent) were all inspired choices.

I do like the way they did Wonder Woman and the Martian Manhunter but other than that the other guys are the same more or less (read less). The voice overs are not very good and the choices (outside of WW and MM which are both great) are nothing to write home about.

If you're looking to just watch the feature, well, the feature (i.e., New Frontier) is good, but it's not the star of this 2-disc set.  The star here are the documentaries/tributes within the DVDs.  Super Heroes United (disc 1) was fabulous, what with all the old writers and other substantial folks (like Stan Lee) commenting - this was the one that made it worth my money.

2817825,4,B000PFSYO4,"This review is about the movie alone, because frankly, I'm not a big special features fan.  I'll try to avoid spoilers in this review, but there's only so much I can do in that respect.

First off, although it was nice to see the justice league again in both their silver and golden age outfits, I'm afraid I didn't really get a feel for the optimism of golden-age comics in this movie.  In the trailer, Darwyn Cooke says that he loved to revisit those older times, because everything seemed positive, but he shows little to no sign of actually appreciating that positive outlook in both the original comic books or the movie that was based on them.  In fact, his short speech at the end of the comic trades for the New Frontier is a decidedly pessimistic one, painting him, as a comic writer, as being a bit like Alan Moore.  In other words, he takes positive figures and looks at them negatively.  That's not, in my opinion, such an impressive thing to do, and it's not like it hasn't been done a million times before.

The overtones (and undertones) of this movie are about the negative viewpoint almost exclusively; corruption in politics, illegal government action against its own citizens and eventually, an enemy so monstrous that it forces people to band together and fight it in spite of their differing beliefs, although it's not implied in either the film or the comic that anything about mankind and its problems really changes after all is said and done.

Unlike some people, I have no difficulty with intense violence, with cursing or with addressing the tough issues.  I think all three of those things can make the storytelling vehicle that much more accessible to today's audience.  However, it's much harder, and shows a much greater artistic talent, to address tough issues with the hope that the situation will improve one day.  In the comic, this was a slightly bigger theme than in the film, although not by much.  This is the main reason why I, for one, will not compare the New Frontier comic book to Alex Ross' masterpiece Kingdom Come; which at least ended with peace and optimism at the helm, despite the tragedies and wars involved in previous chapters of the story.

This is my first and most major issue with the movie; its overall pessimism.  When I heard ""silver age,"" I was expecting something a little more upbeat.

Another gripe of mine is that the background music in this movie is in every way inferior to the music used in the trailer, and is repeated over and over throughout the film, as if to constantly remind you of just how homemade it sounds.  My brother can play something similar to the movie's background music on his Casio, and I don't need to pay him a cent.

Still, for all of these gripes of mine, the story is at least complex enough and includes enough major characters from that time period to hold my attention, and it does confront big issues and show another version of the Justice League's formation, and the beginning and ending of the movie (my favorite parts) are done in an art nouveau-type style, the latter of which uses a section of Kennedy's acceptance speech, which was perhaps the only truly positive moment in the movie, but was utterly disconnected from the rest of the movie, and so it left little impact in my mind.

That brings me to my last gripe about the movie.  It was simply too short.  I see no reason why animated movies; even animated movies made directly for DVD can't exceed two hours in length.  For some reason, there's never been an animated movie that exceeded two hours in length, while at this day in age, it's very common for live movies (such as Transformers or King Kong) to push past the two hour mark.  Two hours is a good amount of time for a movie, and it's a shame that the animation art form in general has been cheated that way.

Seventy minutes isn't enough time to tell a big story about everybody in the DC Universe, and while they might not have been able to include too many more plot points with the extra time, they could at least have put some more dramatic scenes in and made it really feel epic, instead of feeling rushed, as it wound up feeling.

So why did I not rate this review lower?  Well, it's still DC, and at a few points in the story, the characters actually deliver some nice monologues about what you can justify and when, and what kind of responsibilities people have as human beings and as americans.  Those are things people don't think about anymore because they find it depressing that they don't measure up, so they try to forget that they have larger responsibilities instead of struggling to attain higher standards of moral conduct with the hope in their hearts that things will get better if they continue to struggle.  This isn't really said in the movie, but at least it's hinted at.  It reminds us that we've lost something dear and sacred and we show no signs of getting it back, and anything that can do that is worth that fourth star, no matter what other problems I had with it.",1206921600,,5017,4.56298773690078

The animation is particularly disappointing. when the characters are standing still, they manage to convey the vitality of Cooke's original art, but that all collapses when they try to move.

2817833,1,B000PFSYO4,"I grew up on the stories of DC and Marvel.  I watched Superfriends as a kid (which wasn't really good until the Legion of Doom arrived).  I read comics until my late 20's and then gave them up, just because the number of interweaving storylines in multiple different titles made it an expensive hobby.  Now in my mid-30s with a son of my own, I have passed on my love of superheros.  My 5 year old and I loved the Justice League (and Unlimited) series and were hugely disappointed when it was canceled (we now own all those DVDs).  We had been waiting for something new to enjoy.

I have not read the New Frontier graphic novel that this DVD is based on, but I can tell you that this movie was a huge disappointment for several reasons.

#1 The plot made no sense and actually, was fairly boring.  I understand from other reviewers that several things were cut out of the original novel.  After reading the synopsis on the cover and seeing that the movie length was only 75 minutes, I was worried that this might be the case.  ""The Center"" was never fully explained and left me with several questions what it's history was and on how such a powerful being was so easily destroyed.

#2 The characters were not fully developed.  We never learn much about each characters past actions that lead up to the movie's events, except for GL, who we spend way too much time with.

#3 Most of the voices were okay, except for Batman, who I felt was completely miscast.  I am fairly flexible with accepting different actors playing the same role, but this one did not work for me.

I highly recommend not buying this movie.  Get the Justice League TV series instead (I wish they would bring that back).

The lesson I learned from this (I pre-ordered) is to wait to read reviews before purchasing.",1206576000,17,1784,4.45679012345679

2817837,5,B000PFSYO4,"Justice League: The New Frontier is a retelling of a previous comic book storyline that took place in the DC universe. It is, essentially, a re-telling of the origins of a number of the key Justice League members as well as their first real 'test' as a team.

For once, this is a DC animated movie that is not focused primarily on Superman. There are a number of featured heroes, and the cast size is almost too big for the movie. Some heroes are not really examined, but they are viewable during the course of the adventure. The climactic battle at the end of the movie is a truly heroic moment and shines as one of the best animated tales to be released in recent times.

The voice-acting is well done. Of all of the talent featured, I found Lucy Lawless' performance as Wonder Woman to be the best of the 'featured' characters. There were no particularly flawed performances, though I still prefer Kevin Conroy's Batman to the one featured in New Frontier. The style of the animation is an amalgamation; you can still see the Justice League: Unlimited style buried beneath the Silver age renditions of the heroes. The combination works well and provides for some intense moments during the story.

On the whole, Justice League: The New Frontier is a fantastic movie. It is a rendition worthy of the finest that DC watchers could hope for and finds its place as a new standard for the DC animated universe to meet.",1206403200,,1416,4.58893280632411

The story here is a bit weak and convoluted in the villian that must be fought, but the animation is top notch, the characters come with the history that I remember and seeing them come together to work as a team is quite fun.

2817844,3,B000PFSYO4,"I just watched this for the first time after having ordered it and being side tracked by other things e.g. school and work. I thought this was really great and an interesting take on the Justice League. Specifically, I loved the exploration of the characters from a very mature prospective within a political context. Each of the characters wasn't just a cardboard hero in that they were black or white about aspects of good or evil; that they themselves are conflicted with regard to their role e.g. Hal Jordan as U.S. Air Force Pilot having no other choice but to kill a Korean soldier in self defense; this being shown rather graphically as the enemy was shot in the face. Another great moment is when Wonder Woman frees Chineese slave women gives them access to weapons and they take revenge on the people that captured them. Additional great moments include, Superman's dialogue with government agent Faraday about their treatment of the Martian Manhunter and the dialoge between Superman and Lois Lane about the nature of humanity about the nature of heroes. Apart from this, the use of Silver age comic art and dialogue was wonderfully done. I would have liked a little bit more origin background on each of the heroes and their personal development as well as a little bit more on the formation of the Justice League.

My credentials: Comicbook collector for 30 years.  I own over 100,000 and have favored the DC characters since I was a child.  I consider myself to be a knowledgable fan and expert.

The artwork in this film was not that great.....but that is ok.  The voice acting was pretty good.  The story line, plot development, and character backgrounds/definitions were probably the WORST of any animated movie I have ever seen.

Almost every scene had nothing to do with the next one or any other one for that matter.  Almost every scene had nothing to do with how the story would progress or eventually resolve.  Examples:

1: The first scene with Superman and Wonder Woman had nothing to do with any other point in the movie where they interacted with each other.
2: The story and development of J'onn Jonzz, The Martian Manhunter (which was a majority of the film) had nothing to do with anything.  The story could have been told with the omission of ALL his scenes.
3: ALL the scenes of interaction between Batman and J'onn were irrelevant to the unanticipated role that Batman would play at the end.  Eliminate all those scenes and the storyline would have been the same.
4: The main ""bad guy"" has been around for millions of years, then basically pops up out of nowhere (in terms of human history) and is then defeated in what I consider to be extremely easy fashion.
5: Said bad guy takes out Superman like he's a ragdoll but can't do the same with the Flash, or the humans that are attacking it?

I could list many more but I think you get my point.  Bottom line; All this is is a collection of non-related scenes leading up to a lame conclusion.  I am so very disappointed in Bruce Timm (normally an absolute genius), Darwyn Cooke, and especially Dan Didio and DC Comics for allowing this rubbish to be distributed.

As a DC fanatic, I cant help but notice the quality stuff being put out by Marvel. (Iron Man, Dr. Strange, and other animation).  Come on DC.....you can be great again.",1205798400,6,2189,4.583547557840617

2817847,4,B000PFSYO4,"Justice League: The New Frontier (2008) - Dave Bullock

Being the huge fan of superhero comics that I am, it will be difficult for me to heavily dislike any superhero movie.  Just the fact of me being able to watch my favorite heroes in live action is often enough of a reward in itself.  Now, I am a huge fan of Darwyn Cooke's ""The New Frontier"" graphic novel; I think he really captures the essence of the Silver Age comics' timeless appeal, while also throwing in a lot of modern day consciousness to balance the whole package out.  Thus, I really hoped that the DVD adaption would be able to live up to the original.  Thankfully, it survived the test.  True, a lot of it is extremely melodramatic, extremely corny, and the voice acting is a little weak.  But, who cares?  The film is just filled with so much joy, so much fun, so much enthusiasm, and so much admiration and reverence for these great heroes that the negatives don't even matter.  You see, comic book superheroes (especially DC's Silver Age) are a really interesting thing.  The history of writers and artists that have worked on and developed these characters have all, in a way, tried to capture an ideal, the ideal of pure heroism.  They take out all of the extra stuffing that often fills the psychology of characters in most fiction and create heroism at its most basic and primal: a sacrifice for the greater good.  And that, my friends, is a beautiful thing.  And yes, I definitely recommend this film to everyone.",1205539200,,1490,4.577358490566038

The storyline is great.  An homage back to the silver age and a well done one at that.  For those of you that grew up reading comics in the 60's and 70's it will bring back memories, for those newer readers, it will still entertain and make you think.

For the first time,we get to see the origin of Hal Jordan becoming the Green Lantern in an animated style. The story is set in the World War II era and the heroes costumes are set back in the Silver Age of DC Comics around 1945-1960. It's very art deco like the Batman Animated Series in 1992. And at some points it just gets kind of bloody.gritty and unforgiving. But any kid over 12 can handle it. I will say it was scripted and done much better than the first Warner Premiere offering of Superman:Doomsday. Warner Premiere has a Anime/Manga style treatment for the Batman coming sometime before Dark Knight comes out in Summer 2008. On the second disc,there is a preview featurette of this animated movie and it looks amazing! I really wish they would do a Knightfall animated feature but who knows what's around the bend? Also on the second disc you will get to know the Legion Of Doom,the rogues gallery of bad guys in the DC Universe. Overall it's worth every penny.

The main title sequence is BEAUTIFUL.  It very much resembles the style of the cover art of the comic book series.  However, that's pretty much all that I liked.  Somehow, someone forgot that Hal Jordan and John Jones (J'onn J'onzz) really carry the story while setting up the backdrop of the it along with the rest of the cameo heroes.  If I hadn't read the comic, I would have been very confused.  It's a quick-paced movie without breaks or pauses (even when there should be, understandable due to the amount of content from the comic booksbut inexcusable).  My friend agreed, and his sister, who had never read it, was very confused indeed.  Most of the male voices sound alikea very testosterone sounding heroic and manly voice, which does little to distinguish character.  The animation was nicer than I expected based on previews.

Still, JL:ANF doesn't bomb out either.  There's a whole lot to like, I just wish there was more of it.  After seeing Superman, Batman, and the rest done so brilliantly for so many years, it's hard to understand the decision to scrap the whole thing and start over with inferior voice talent.  Andrea Romano is, as Joss Whedon once called her, the best casting director on the planet, but her choices for these last two DC offerings have been beneath her.  Great actors, but voiceover is a whole different cup of tea from being on camera.  To Ms. Romano's credit, Lucy Lawless is the best possible Wonder Woman; too bad she doesn't have much to do here storywise.  That is, of course, unless owning Superman qualifies... and shouldn't it always?  batman is the biggest disappointment for me here, but he does have a great moment where he threatens Martian Manhunter by declaring that while he has some kryptonite squirreled away to deal with the big blue boy scout, all he needs to take J'onn Jonzz out is a penny to buy a pack of matches.  Ouch!  That's my man, right there.

This film gets three stars by itself, but I'm throwing extra credit up there for the great bonus features on this two-disc edition and for introducing more mature elements (and blood!) to a genre that has historically been overtly kid-friendly.  Comic book audiences and themes have matured greatly and it's about damn time that the adaptations followed suit. ""A New Frontier"" gets 3 1/2 stars from me, rounded up for the pre-stated reasons.",1204934400,3,2507,5.79291553133515
2817863,5,B000PFSYO4,"Comics scripter and artist, Darwyn Cooke, created quite a splash when he wrote the mini-series, JUSTICE LEAGUE: THE NEW FRONTIER.  Those issues have been gathered into a graphic novel.

When I first read the issues, I have to admit to being a little put off.  The story seemed to meander a little and took too long to develop in some ways.  But it was really interesting seeing Superman, Batman, Wonder  Woman, and the Flash during the paranoid times of McCarthyism.  The art seemed a little too unfinished for my taste for the first couple issues, but it was the first time I'd ever seen any of Cooke's work.  His writing and his art grew on me.  By the third issue, I was won over by the storyline and the different look of the characters.

JUSTICE LEAGUE:  THE NEW FRONTIER is the second of DC Comics' and Warner's direct-to-DVD efforts.  The first was SUPERMAN: DOOMSDAY.  Hopefully there will be a lot more to come.  The special editions have the trailer for the Batman animated feature that will be coming out soon.

The movie strikes the same tone as the graphic novel.  The mid-1950s to 1960 are represented in a number of ways.  The suspicion of anyone from outside the country - including of Superman - is well-defined.  Hal Jordan (voiced by David Boreanaz, ANGEL, BONES) as a Korean Air Force fighter pilot is well done and sets up his eventual recruitment by the Green Lanterns.

The Martian Manhunter (voice by Miguel Ferrer, CROSSING JORDAN, THE BIONIC WOMAN) seizes a big part of the story as both an alien newly arrived to our planet, a detective, and an outsider viewing the strange and politically suspicious world of the 1950s.  One of the best parts of the movie for my son and I was watching the Martian Manhunter change into various characters while he watched television.  When he unexpectedly changed into Bugs Bunny, we both lost it.

I really missed the opening segments of the comic book where the Losers comics heroes took on the dinosaurs of Dinosaur Island.  I didn't like the ending the Losers experienced, but I really noticed them absent from the continuity.

Like the comic series, you have to watch the movie closely to figure out everything that's going on.  The original Justice League origin story featured an alien menace to the world.  The retelling of that origin, in the Justice League series recently on television, features a threat from Mars.  And this movie also features an otherworldly menace, although it takes a while to build to that threat.

I loved seeing so many of the lesser known heroes of the DC universe in action:  the Challengers of the Unknown, the Blackhawks, the Metal Men, Adam Strange, and others.  When Darwyn Cooke wrote the original comics, I knew that he loved the characters and was paying homage to so much of their roots.  That same kind of care and consideration is evident in this DVD production.

The Blu-ray video was fantastic.  The colors were bright and varied.  King Faraday's gray eyes were arctic and really distinguished him.  The audio was just as impressive.

As for special features, the disc comes fully loaded.  There are two different commentaries and several features regarding the making of the film.  One of the best pieces was the preview of Batman: Gotham Knight that's supposed to come out in July.  The anime style artwork looks breathtaking.  There are also three of director Bruce W. Timm's favorite JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED episodes on the disc.

Although JUSTICE LEAGUE: THE NEW FRONTIER is a cartoon and is about characters familiar to kids, parents need to know that the violence is at times very graphic and the language can be occasionally coarse.  All in all, though, this is a great movie to own, especially in the high-def versions.",1204848000,9,3741,4.7828125
2817864,3,B000PFSYO4,"First if you are expecting to see the action or gritt you saw on death of superman then you might as well not pick this up. Granted it has some scenes that aren't for the kiddes in there but, it wasn't nowhere near as dark.

Second for a 75 min movie it spends a ridiclos amount of time developing. Granted we get a batman part here, a flash part here, some supes/WW talk from time to time but, for the most part it just centers around the origin of hal jordan (green lantern) and Jonn Jonz (martian manhunter).

Third wasn't that overly impressed with the action scenes. There were decent but, after death of superman and even the justice leauge cartoons little disappointed.

Fourth voice acting wasn't that bad. Only  probelm I had was Batman's which it was more that conroy does such a good job it's hard to hear anyone else do batman.

Fifth ovearll the story was decent. Basically the gov't is cracking down on superheroes and it just shows the beginning of the silver age of comics. Don't care for the gov't think wish they could have gone about that a better way.

Finally if you are an old school fan you probaly love this. If you are more new school you'll like it but, it won't wow your world or anything. I would say it's still worth a buy if you have 15 dollars burning in your pocket and are going through no justice league on tv anymore pains.",1204848000,,1358,4.3478260869565215
2817865,1,B000PFSYO4,"The movie has a vintage look to them which was refreshing. I was expecting a hero-filled, action-packed movie, instead what we get is about five minutes of action towards the end of the movie! Additionally, those very little action scenes were gory and brutal.
This movie might have been called ""Green Lantern- the origin"". About a quarter featured Hal Jordan and the rest was a spotlight on the Martian Manhunter. The cover was misleading with all the heroes in fighting poses. What we get is a handful of justice leaguers finshing off the movie.
I am very disapointed, I hope Bruce Timm reads this review!",1204848000,2,607,4.79047619047619

I felt like I was watching a blockbuster motion picture. Hearing all-new voices takes a little getting used to, but welcome nonetheless, especially Lucy Lawless as Wonder Woman. It has traces of nostalgia that younger viewers may not get, but then I think this was made with the older generation in mind. If you have EVER been a fan of the original Justice League, don't just rent this movie, BUY a copy. It's great for a late-night viewing with friends.",1204848000,4,604,4.5
2817867,5,B000PFSYO4,"Although I wouldn't necessarily recommend this for small youngsters,teens & adults will love this DVD movie! Our heroes are put in the middle of a very dangerous situation,and must find a way to work together to overcome the evil that threatens the entire world! Kudos to the animators-they gave the heroes a touch of humanity I don't think I have ever seen before. If you haven't seen this yet,you should-you'll absolutely love it!",1204848000,3,432,4.931506849315069
2817868,4,B000PFSYO4,"A very well done adaptation of the New Frontier graphic novel. The animation stays true to the feel of the book, the voice acting was excellent, casting voices that fit the characters exactly. I was wary of Brooke Shields being cast in the role of Carol Ferris, and I must say I'm delighted to be wrong. She did a wonderful job. My personally favorites were Neil Patrick Harris as the Flash and Miguel Ferrer as my favorite DC hero, the Martian Manhunter. The fact they used the real audio of the new frontier speech brought tears to my eyes, as the book did. This is a wonderful blend of DC history and real history.

The way they condensed the story for the most part was well done, but I didn't like the new sequence with the failed rocket to mars. Needless to say, we're watching a fantastic story, but the completely unrealistic fight, and survival of one of Hal having begun to fall in nothing but a space suit back into the atmosphere pulled me out of the story for that moment. Especially when he is shown 5 minutes later to be just fine and standing. The event in the graphic novel was planned well, and came off much better. Having said that, most of the trimming didn't bother me, although I did think they could have made it a longer than 70 minutes and only made it even more interesting and intertwined.

The extras are somewhat disappointing. I loved Darwyn Cooke's commentary, but the production staff one was so boring, I shut it off after only 15 minutes. The documentary on the Justice League and the villains of DC was well done, as was the preview for the Batman: Gotham Knight DVD, but the episodes of the Justice League show I already own on their seasons, and a lot of the perks felt like they were added on only to take up space.

I'm not going to even get into the complaints from parents about the violence in this, except to say READ YOUR DVD RATINGS! ANIMATED DOES NOT EQUAL FOR KIDS! The level of violence and blood was fine for a PG-13 movie, especially one that so obviously was trying to show the consequences of war and bigotry.

It's a good film, and I recommend it. But I still hold the original graphic novel as one of  the best works DC has put out, and I'd offer that this movie is a good introduction to Cooke's vision. If you enjoy it, get the book. You'll get even more than what you found here.",1204848000,2,2337,4.363218390804597
2817869,2,B000PFSYO4,"I know this movie is based on a famous graphic novel, but the reality is that this DVD will be purchased mostly for children. THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. The level of bloody violence is terrible. There's a suicide in the opening scene. Green Lantern shoots a man in the head at point blank range and gets covered in his blood. A child is threatened by an evil cult at knifepoint. Wonder Woman's blood stains her invisible airplane to the point where it is no longer invisible. The ""heroes"" are covered in blood as they rip attacking monsters apart. It's over-the-top. Another example of poor writers substituting shock-value storytelling for genuine creativity.

Now, before I'm dismissed as some kind of conservative lunatic, I realize this movie is PG-13. Like a responsible parent, I screened the movie, and I found it inappropriate for children (and for decent adults).

The SUBJECT MATTER naturally attracts children. That's the problem. DC Comics should not make adult-centered animated films using CHILDREN'S FAVORITE CHARACTERS. This movie is almost ALWAYS found in the children's movie section of stores. No matter how responsible you or I might be as a parent, you know that countless bad parents will show their children this crap. That's why I wrote the bad review. Maybe it will keep some child from seeing this film.",1204848000,4,1334,4.977578475336323

Some SPOILERS here.

JUSTICE LEAGUE: THE NEW FRONTIER is the latest from the direct-to-video line of DC Universe Original Animated Movies, being the second offering after&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-Doomsday-DC-Universe-Animated-Original-Movie/dp/B000PE0G0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman - Doomsday (DC Universe Animated Original Movie)</a>. THE NEW FRONTIER is Warner Brothers' adaptation of Darwyn Cooke's brilliant, critically-acclaimed 2004 two-volumed graphic novel series. And, in fact, Cooke, is on board as a creative consultant. So many chances for him to even more influence the project (this is a good thing).

First, a little set-up: After the second world war, things changed in the way that mystery men were perceived by the public and by the government, both having grown fearful and suspicious, thanks to rampant McCarthyism. Buffeted by paranoia, the capes had become unpopular, deemed untrustworthy, and soon fell out of favor altogether. The government's insistence that the superheroes unmask leads to the disbanding of the Justice Society. As the film opens, former JSA members Superman and a growingly disgruntled Wonder Woman had signed loyalty oaths to the American government. Batman hadn't and thus had become a fugitive. And the Hourman is dead.

It's 1953 now, and reporter Lois Lane, broadcasting over the Armed Forces radio, heralds the end of the Korean War. And for Air Force fighter pilot Hal Jordan, the news immediately gets him one step closer to his dream of becoming an astronaut. But, then, one tragic, life-altering event throws a wrench into his plans.

In a Gotham observatory, a scientist lies crumbled to the floor, expiring of shock and asking forgiveness from the extraterrestrial visitor he had unwittingly brought forth in an attempt to contact the red planet. The Martian Manhunter has come to Earth.

Meanwhile, a primordial psychic entity known as the Centre has begun seeping into an ever increasing fragment of the public consciousness. A crazed artist had even created a story about the Centre, before blowing his brains out. On occasion, this malevolent presence had even briefly possessed those it had influenced. The Centre's scheme, when it's finally revealed, will place all of humanity in total jeopardy and will force the mystery men to come out of hiding and once again save the world.

I wish JUSTICE LEAGUE: THE NEW FRONTIER had been longer. But what there is of it is pretty terrific. It's told as a period piece, the story set in the backdrop of the 1950s, as racial injustices and xenophobia heavily impacted the American culture. A heads up: this flick is rated PG-13 (there's a suicide, one instance of cussing, and Hal Jordan commits an act which parents maybe shouldn't let their younger kids see). At a running time of 75 minutes, NEW FRONTIER covers a hectic, sprawling span of eight years (1953-1960) in the lives of its characters. DC Comics' Big Three take a back seat as, instead, Hal Jordan, J'onn J'onzz, and Barry Allen (to a lesser extent) do the heavy lifting in terms of focus and onscreen time.

So we get to see these three characters develop the most. If there's a leading man in NEW FRONTIER, it'd have to be Hal Jordan. Sucks for me as I'm not really into Jordan (I think he's a bit too smug). However, David Boreanaz, who voices him, goes a long way into making him palatable. Thru the course of the film, we get to learn of Hal's fearlessness and his high regard for human life (traits which would make him the ideal choice as a Green Lantern, which we do see late in the game). Ample time is also given to the stranded Martian, J'onn J'onzz (or John Jones), and his attempts to acclimate to his strange new world. But it's very hard going as he's repeatedly exposed to man's meanness, ignorance, and mindless conformity. When J'onn hears of a space mission to Mars, he jumps at the chance to return home. Meanwhile, the Flash is also spotlighted. The Flash is a newcomer and one of the few superheroes who still does his crimefighting in public. He quickly becomes a target for government agents, who attempt to capture him to see ""what makes him tick."" Also touched on is Flash's feelings of inadequacy in the presence of the more established superheroes. But, no worries, he gets a chance to shine.

So, it turns out, the good old days maybe weren't so good. The film does a decent job of reflecting key aspects in the political and cultural climate of the '50s, and of how the DC characters react to these times. When the Flash, having had enough of government persecution, decides to publicly hang it up, he draws snide comments from the man on the street (""And what was with that red costume? Red's for commies!""). I do wish we could've seen more of John Wilson a.k.a. John Henry, a black vigilante whose battles with the Klan ends in tragedy.

The retro-style animation is certainly dynamic and is reminiscent of the recent DC animated television shows (BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES, SUPERMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES, JUSTICE LEAGUE). It also closely resembles Darwyn Cooke's clean, nostalgic-style artwork. In fact, certain of the film compositions and imagery are lifted directly from the limited series.

The spectacular voice cast is an acting who's who, beginning with David Boreanaz as the daredevil flyboy Hal Jordan. Jeremy Sisto's vibrant voice does Batman a solid (but Kevin Conroy still rules), while Neil Patrick Harris is simply spot on as the Flash. Lucy Lawless (XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS) is a no-brainer as Wonder Woman (there's just a shade of that New Zealand accent). Also here are Brooke Shields (Carol Ferris), Kyra Sedgwick (Lois Lane), Miguel Ferrer (pretty good as the Martian Manhunter), and, surprisingly okay, Kyle MacLachlan as Superman. Oh, and Keith David voices the Centre.

Tons of bonus features here, in this 2-disc Special Edition. Disc 1 not only contains the movie but also the in-depth documentary ""Super Heroes United!: The Complete Justice League History."" At 41 minutes, this is a must see for JLA fans as it covers the different periods of DC's premiere superteam. There's an exclusive sneak peek at the upcoming animated DC Universe line's BATMAN: GOTHAM KNIGHT (an anthology supposedly composed of 6 stories and told mostly in manga animation style; think ANIMATRIX). There are 2 audio commentaries, both insightful, one with the animation filmmakers (including Bruce Timm), the other with comic book writer/artist Darwyn Cooke.

Disc 2 has the documentary ""The Legion of Doom: The Pathology of the Super Villain"" (which I found boring since I'm not that into the baddies); the 10-minute-long featurette ""Comic Book Commentary: Homage to the New Frontier"" (Darwyn Cooke goes a bit more behind the scenes and talks about stuff in the original mini-series which were left out of the film (the Losers, Ted Grant's last boxing match; the Challengers of the Unknown, etc.)); and 3 bonus Justice League episodes (""Dark Heart,"" ""To Another Shore,"" and the very cool ""Task Force X"").

It's not a perfect movie. Superman and King Faraday, for example, come out with hokey battle speeches. And, no doubt, longtime fans will get more of a kick from this film as there are plenty of cameos made by lesser known residents of the DC Universe (the Blackhawks, the Golden Age version of Green Arrow, Adam Strange, etc.). So newcomers or the more casual fans just might spend a busload of time playing the ""Okay, now who's that?"" game. It's a sprawling film, with an abundance of characters. The storytelling in the film's first half tends to be non-linear and is a bit disjointed as various story arcs take turns on camera, none of 'em initially having much to do with one another (with the exception of the Centre thread, which fairly early on impacts the Flash, Batman, and J'onn J'onzz). It's not until the second half that NEW FRONTIER gains a focused narrative drive. And, again, this really needed to be a longer film. So those are my gripes, and, really, compared to what's good and awesome about the film, the negatives are negligible.

All hail Bruce Timm and his nerdy posse! There's such an infusion here of that joy in superheroes and in the Golden and Silver Ages of comic books, translating to an exuberant, if dark, picture. It's an action-packed production (check out Flash's run-in with Captain Cold), climaxing in an all-out effort from the heroes as the Centre makes its end move to obliterate humanity. And, by gum, there's dinosaurs! And, to top it all off, this story also paves the way for the eventual forming of the Justice League.

2817871,1,B000PFSYO4,"The 2-disc special edition is nothing more than ""How We Made It""  and a couple of Justice League Unlimited re-runs.  The story was nothing special, basically a how we got together along with a how Green Lantern got started story blend.  The Justice League Unlimited stories ranged from good to mediocre, but this is a step below that.",1204761600,4,334,4.724137931034483
2817872,5,B000PFSYO4,"First, I was shocked when I saw the suicide, then Hal blowing someones brains out, the SOB word mentioned twice and Wonder Woman simply allowing soldiers to be killed.  She might as well have killed them herself since she was an accomplice to murder, right or wrong.  Then I looked at the PG-13 rating and understood why.  This is definately not a kids cartoon.  It also reminded me of JL and JLU where the US government was secretly keeping tabs on the justice league and weren't completely trusted.

Anyway, this was really good and I really enjoyed the intro for Batman.  Although it didn't explain why Batman was a renegade.  Superman was taken out too quickly, I would have liked to see him fighting side by side with the other heavy hitters, Wonder Woman, Martian Manhunter, and Green Lantern.  Overall, I enjoy almost all Justice League material.  Has anyone heard of a real life Justice League with Roth Brandon and Christian Bale, etc.?  I saw some stuff on youtube.",1204761600,3,975,4.715976331360947
2817873,5,B000PFSYO4,"New Frontier is the 2nd DTV release from WB in this new line of DC Universe movies, the first being Superman Doomsday.  Being a fan of the graphic, I was more than excited at the idea of watching it animated.  The book is without a doubt one of the best examples of modern stuperhero story telling and the movie definitely does it justice.

Bruce Timm is behind this, just like practically every other DC superhero animated series of the past 10 plus years.  Which is a good thing, he created quality stuff back then, and NF is no exception.  The best decision they made here was choosing what to adapt, and getting Darwyn Cooke, the writer/artist of NF involved.  Cooke and Timm had similar artistic styles so this resembles both the graphic novel artwork as well as the previous Justice League series.

As far as the voice talent go, no major complaints here.  True to form, Timm enlists yet another Joss Whedon colaborator in David Boreanaz to voice Hal Jordan.  I'm not a fan of him from his live action stuff but he's fine as Hal.  Neil Patrick Harris is a no-brainer for Flash, and Miguel Ferrer brings a lot of depth to J'onn.  The big three are all pretty standard and don't have much screen time.  Jeremy Sisto's Batman works, but I don't know how I would have liked him if he had been the star of the movie.

Going into it, I already had a pretty good idea of what was going to be cut, and I was right.  John Henry and his hammer was cut but that was a pretty easy descision.  The Losers on Dinosuar Island?  Gone.  The Challengers of the Unknown are still in it, but we lose their backstory which was dissapointing but what can you do?  I would have loved to see these scenes in there but they weren't that necessary to the overall plot, except a lot of backstory about Dinosaur Island which would have helped.  A little explanation would have been appreciated, but you can never accuse this movie of being boring.  We're also treated to some in depth features including a featurette spotlighting the JL and their history as well as one giving an in depth look at the Legion of Doom.

If you're a JL fan, you have to see this.  It is essential for any DC Comics collection.  Let's hope the quality doesn't slide with the highly anticipated Batman: Gotham Knight.",1204675200,3,2273,4.450363196125908
2817874,4,B000PFSYO4,"If you have a Blu-ray player - does this disc ever look good.  Animation is ideally suited to High Definition.  Just incredible looking.  The acting/voice performances were excellent.  I love the original cast and wouldn't change a thing, yet the new voices here all work quite well - another triumph for Andrea Romano's casting and voice direction talents.

Many others have spelled out the basic plot already so no need to go into that much more.  The main villain is a bit weak even after hearing the explanation in the special features.  That's about the only weakness in the script.  I would say this movie is primarily a Green Lantern/Flash story -- lots of great stuff from the old comics done well and many nice touches and fine polishes to many elements.  It is a lot like the old JLA comic - all the characters in one place for the same price.

I can easily forgive the liberal leaning retcon elements of this story.  The period between the golden and silver age of comics where the story takes place is ripe for new material.  All of our comic heroes are creations of the times they were made.  At the time of the Korean War, could Superman actually realize he was just a government tool?  Or Batman change his style and look because Robin was now part of his life's responsibility?  These are modern paradigms presented as vintage.  But we all know that.  The retcon is not offensive.  It's part of the story the writer wanted to tell, and weaving the story in with JFK's ""New Frontier"" speech actually worked.  And that was part of the point here.  Something ""dated"" still directly applies to our modern world.  JFK's truth still rings true today as if Obama had said it yesterday.  Superheroes in the 1950's didn't comprehend as our hindsight allows us to, but since this is just a story it's okay that they apparently did all along.

I enjoyed this film.  I thought it was written at a very adult level and that the comic book kids from 8-12 won't be able to appreciate it.  I'm looking forward to more features from DC.  I think this is a great trend to produce animated superhero features.  I think the script could have been fleshed out a lot more, because a 74 minute movie is just not enough to tell the tale.  It's loaded with small details but I'd have preferred if it was loaded with larger more developed details of all the characters.  But what we got was still good and I'm grateful that such movies are being made at all.",1204675200,3,2448,4.5125284738041005
2817875,4,B000PFSYO4,"...this IS a very good comic book movie. So good that at least twice I inadvertently responded to it on a vocal level, forgetting that I was watching an animated film.
My primary concern was that it stayed true to the excellent comic upon which it was based and that it did. Of course its seventy-five minute running time  couldn't provide the huge depth of story of the original comic but that didn't detract from my total enjoyment.
The voice work from all cast members is superb and the moment when Hal Jordan fully becomes Green Lantern is positively transcendent.
Good stuff and well worth the time to watch.",1204675200,4,613,4.623853211009174
2817876,5,B000PFSYO4,"To be honest, I was a bit skeptical going into this. Warner's last direct-to-DVD animated release, ""Superman: Doomsday"", left me a little cold. It had fast forwarded the story into overdrive to cram it into 75 minutes. There seemed to be so much more they could do with it. And I didn't find the voice cast to be all that great.

Now along comes their second foray, and they certainly learned a whole lot between the two. ""Justice League: The New Frontier"" is retro. There is violence, both implied and seen, which should probably keep this away from children's eyes.

The setting is post-Korean War America. Superhero types have been forced to sign a loyalty oath. The government in in the throws of McCarthy-ism, and some of the heroes are questioning their choices

Along comes fighter pilot Hal Jordan (David Boreanaz). After avoiding killing during the war, he ends up in a mental hospital and then is hired as a test pilot. When the world is in danger, he finds that his destiny lies beyond what he could have imagined.

This story is basically a dual origin tale. Giving us a quick take on the beginnings of J'onn J'onzz, The Martian Manhunter (complete with some fun cameos from the Warner library). More involved is the transformation of Hal Jordan into Earth's member of the Green Lantern Corp.

The animation, blending traditional and computer styles, is top notch. There are little subtleties in style and dialogue that help set the period very nicely. Lucy Lawless' take on Wonder Woman, and Boreanaz as Jordan/Lantern are the voice cast stand outs. The only one that stood out as a questionable choice for me was Jeremy Sisto as Batman. It just never clicked for me.

The special edition and Blu-ray versions include 3 episodes from Cartoon Network's excellent ""Justice League: Unlimited"" series which fill in the gaps on a couple of characters.

I'd like to see a continuation of this series on DVD exploring some of the other characters in more detail.",1204588800,7,1968,4.804733727810651
2817877,5,B000PFSYO4,"Justice League was one of my all time favorite shows. I mean when you're in your early 20's with a full time job watching a show like Justice League it really makes people wonder about what this show is all about. With this brand new film Bruce Timm is really taking the step to keep the older fans interested in his work by maturing the story lines as well as the characters.

The New Fronier is based on the forming of the Justice League through a writter and artist with a huge passion for the silver age of DC comics. With the film adaption Bruce Timm went out of his way to find new voices for his cahracters to really bring out the 50's theme with a little bit of takiness but at the same time really trying to bring out the thematic elements that revolved around the story. At points it can be a little confusing to the watcher, but for me the Cold War was a bit confusing all together.

This movie will make a great addition to your comic film collection. It's a great story eventhough it doesn't involve all the characters in depth, it capture a bit history as well as the evolution of the comic book industry if you look hard enough. I am very excited for the next Bruce Timm film and I am so happy to know he and his staff are still not through with their work.",1204502400,7,1272,4.187755102040816
2817878,5,B000PFSYO4,"I have been very pleased with most of the recent releases from Marvel and DC. Check out the Gotham Knight xtra. Many of the more recent feature length titles from Marvel and DC are indeed targeting a niche void that has typically been filled by Japanese Anime. It is about time. American audiences almost always think Child's play when they see animation. These newer titles ""Superman Doomsday"", ""Ironman"", ""TMNT"", ""Justice League the New Frontier"", ""Hellboy Animated"" and several others are definitely not for kids. They are more like the source material. The graphic novels in which they get their direction are in my opinion not for young kids either. They are for older kids ,adolescents and adults. Superman Doomsday was the top selling graphic novel of all time because it sparked imagination. The DVD is probably more bloody and violent that most R-rated movies, Tarentino excluded. The main problem is that retailers do not yet know this. They see animation and stock these titles along with the other cartoons. Parents please inform yourselves. Do not expect others to do it for you. Never trust ratings. Enjoy these titles responsibly. Many of them are very good. By the way Justice League the New Frontier was not intended to have any relationship to the TV series.",1204502400,3,1276,4.9672897196261685
2817879,4,B000PFSYO4,"I prepared myself with the knowledge that New Frontier wouldn't measure up to the book. But, this is true of almost any book to film adaptation.

What did I love? First off, I loved the Flash. I totally want DC to produce a cartoon version of Flash for tv. I enjoy Wally on JLU, but this interpretation made him into someone I could truly root for. He is a man who is fearful but driven...with a splash of humility and humor. It didn't matter that he was Barry...he could have been Wally or Jay or Bart. The main thing seen here is respect to the man beneath the mask. The Flash in New Frontier is a true hero and I can see why his hometown would honor him with a museum. The Flash was the best part of this movie.

Hal Jordan was also great. It's funny how perfectly David Boreanaz was for the part. It almost seemed like the animators made Hal resemble the popular Angel and Bones actor. In the opening job interview scene at the restaurant, with Carol, he looked just like Boreanaz. Or does Boreanaz just resemble Hal? Whatever the answer, it was a perfect voice performance. Hal was the second best part of the film. He was actually Hal more than GL and I didn't care. They made Hal a true hero and, maybe for the first time ever, truly felt connected to the character. I've always connected with Jon and Kyle more. This is a watershed moment for Hal Jordan in animation.

What else did I love? J'onn was amazing. I loved him in JLU, but here he was just as heroic. It's cool how he almost seemed more human than Batman. (Who, was also done very well. He had more of a secondary role here. Which is fine. Usually Batman steals the show. It was nice to see Flash and GL get the spotlight.) I also LOVED Wonder Woman!!!!

Lucy Lawless is ideal as the voice of Diana. I hope they keep her for the upcoming WW dvd they are doing. She was tough but had a sense of humor as well. Her determination and bravery was well done in her all too brief scenes. My first complaint is that I wanted to see more of this Diana. The invisible plane moment was cool and I liked when she took over for Superman in leading the troops. (Nice to see the Blackhawks and Adam Strange get cameos as well.)

Also, the History of the Justice League extra on disc one is a must see. Mark Waid and Stan Lee were my favorites. This is a great introduction to the DCU for new fans.

New Frontier isn't close to being as good as the book, but, as a tribute and a way to lure viewers to the comic version, I say it's pretty darn perfect. Major kudos to DC for including a leaflet in the dvd advertising the graphic novel of NF. The animation is done with love and the voice acting is perfect. An extra 20 minutes would have been nice to flesh out the story a bit, but, as is, it is still worth everyone's time. Don't watch New Frontier to see what they cut out...just enjoy it for what it is: a rollicking, action packed adventure that celebrates the DC Universe.",1204416000,,2932,4.226785714285715
2817880,4,B000PFSYO4,"This translation of Darwyn Cooke's superb graphic novel about the creation of the Justice League in the 1950s during the days of the Space Race and the scariest institutionalization of the military/industrial complex was a natural to be translated to the screen in an animated format: Cooke's graphics in the original work owe much to Bruce Timm's beautiful work for the animated series of BATMAN, SUPERMAN, and JUSTICE LEAGUE. This film has a much more complex and historically responsible screenplay than anything Timm and his cohorts have yet done for the DC figures, and it's also more violent (this does not have a G rating, and might be too scary for young children).

For comics fan familiar with either Cooke's original series of with the DC Silver Age this film is a great treat, especially since the animation is so stellar (the compositions are unusually well done) and because so is the voice work; Andrea Romano has done an exceptional job matching familiar actors to the superheroes and their friends and girlfriends, with particular standouts being Lucy Lawless as Wonder Woman, Miguel Ferrer as the Martian Manhunter, Neil Patrick Harris as the Flash, Jeremy Sisto as the Batman, David Boreanaz as Hal Jordan/Green Lantern and Brooke Shields as Carol Ferris. The charming Fabulous Fifties look of the original Cooke graphic novel has been retained, with an emphasis on ""Googie"" architecture, Danish modern furniture, and a wardrobe for Carol Ferris that includes Capri pants and pillbox hats. Viewers unfamiliar with the DC Silver Age will probably be very confused by the silent cameos played by Adam Strange, the Challengers of the Unknown, the Blackhawks, and Ray Palmer. Even so, the giddy Eisenhower/Kennedy Era can-do optimism should make this very enjoyable for almost anyone over the age of 13 interested in DC Comics. There are multiple extras, including a very enjoyable commentary by Darwyn Cooke (who winningly sounds like a 1950s lovable tough guy!), an interview with many famous DC editors and writers (including Denny O'Neil, Roy Thomas, Len Wein and Marv Wolfman) about the history of the Justice League, and a preview of the very strange-looking animated film BATMAN: GOTHAM KNIGHT which will represent a real break from the Timm-styled animation in favor of a moodier Manga-influenced style.",1204416000,2,2326,5.1697612732095495
2817881,2,B000PFSYO4,"This is a decent stand-alone movie, but be warned--this is not for kids. Take the PG-13 seriously. The movie opens with a man's suicide (by handgun). The final act is not shown, but it's clear what he is going to do with the gun. Several scenes are bloody. Sure it's cartoon blood, but it can be disturbing even for kids as old as ten. A few ""son of a _____""s and some other choice language top it off.
Otherwise, it has some nice moments, particularly some of the origin scenes for Silver Age Justice Leaguers. But overall, it lacks the charm of the TV series (and the series pilot had cooler aliens). Better than the Superman:Doomsday movie, but still not that great.",1204416000,4,669,4.491803278688525

The only way to know if one would enjoy this is to check it out yourself-not recomended for kids (some blood and violence), but older kids and adults will enjoy it.  Also if you like nostalgia and are a fan of  the sixties this movie is a wonderful trip to that era.

Also note that it is for fans of the DCU mostly, most people bashing this film are way to diehard based on the novel and expect the same (exactly) of what they read...

I was very pleased to see DC making some thing different and I am Looking foward to their next release (Batman Gotham Knight) done in the style of the animatrix.  Enjoy at your own risk!-Count Banks",1204416000,2,850,4.348101265822785
2817883,4,B000PFSYO4,"The plot in short is things from inside the earth see humans as corrupt and evil, and thus must be eliminated so the DC super heroes come to stop it. The Film does star Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman, but focuses Green Lantern who gets his ring in the film, Martian Manhunter who comes to earth in the film, and Flash who the fait of the earth depends on.
You may ask ""are all the heroes on the cover in the movie?"" and the answer is pretty much. I remember seeing most of them, but a few I did not see. I may have over looked them since other than the main heroes there roles are usually brief and non-speaking. For example Speedy and Wonder Girl are only in a picture of the Teen Titans when they are showing a bit of the future in the end of the movie.
Now a big question you may have is ""why is it PG-13?"" I think it has some thing to do with them trying to get animation more respect and make it not thought of as a medium limited to children only. I say this since they could have easily made this a PG. The rating was dew to some scenes like when Wonder Woman wrecks her invisible plane and there is blood everywhere (although she goes to the medic and comes out with a cast on her arm and not even a scratch other than that), and when they fight the monsters from under ground they basically splatter them (It is not as gory as it sounds). And people do say ""son of a b****"" twice. So if you show this to children watch it first.
But for that I take off one star, since the great story, acting, and animation in this should get at least 4 stars. For anyone over 13 I recommend it, anyone under I think it is probably best to wait a few years.",1204416000,,1654,4.0303951367781155
2817884,1,B000PFSYO4,"A complete waste of money. Some of the worst animation I have seen in many a year. The voice acting was very poor.  The name actors and actresses came across wooden and stiff.  After the brilliant animated DC JLA series this was a true come down. The New Frontier comic book had its problems, Twenty-First century attitudes grafted on to the 1950s, but it was much better done than this. The villian was true to the type of end of world threats that the JLA did fight in its first incarnation, which is about the most that I can say for this mess, except for the hilarious Martian Manhunter watching TV scenes. Only for die-hard JLA collectors. Language and violence make this definitely unsuitable for kids. It is also too boring for the average kid.  The JLA deserves a much better animated treatment than this drek.",1204329600,10,818,4.589041095890411

They have Senator McCarthy persecuting Flash because he wears red - ridiculous. And, they top the whole thing off with portraying the very late kennedy as the god of all gods and savior to both superheroes and the little people.

2817886,2,B000PFSYO4,"A lot of people have complemented the animation here but I don't see it.  It was crude and jumpy, almost as if they were trying to convey a retro feel with old animation.  In some parts, it looked like an old, mass produced  Saturday morning cartoon.  In others, it almost felt Clutch Cargoish (with very small parts of the frame -- mostly the mouth -- having movement).  I was hoping for some modern, slick 2D animation to portray this world of the 1950's.  What I saw looked very cheap.

The poor animation could have been overlooked with a good story.  Too bad this movie didn't have that either.  It was OK in parts, but it was too frequently incoherent and rushed.  It skipped around without a solid direction and then -- suddenly -- we're in the final fight.  Nobody besides Green Lantern is developed very well and even his development seemed sloppy.

If there is an upside to the production, it's the voice acting.  The actors involved did what they could with a poor script.

Overall, I was disappointed.  Warner should aim higher than this.",1204243200,4,1050,4.6
2817887,3,B000PFSYO4,"I have always wished for a old school Dc Movie but I'll have to keep wishing.

I am bewildered why ""first PG-13""! In this movie and ""Death of superman"" is such a selling point. So I look at it in the store and think wow! finally I get to see Wonder Woman all bloody!
A Justice league with swearing and violence! I gotta have it! I loved the art work and the Cold War idea but from the creepy demonic Suicied at the begining to the slow motion bullet through the head, I knew this wouldn't do it.

My only complaint is that it should have been longer. I understand the heads at Warner Bros. deciding that 75 minutes was more than enough time to tell this story for the average animated film fan. I would have preferred to have watched this movie in a theater for 2 hours easily. There are, much to my surprise and joy, several scenes in the novel that have not been excised due to their graphic nature. That's why parents should definitely screen this film for anyone under the age of 12. All in all, I look forward to more wonderful work from WB(s).",1204243200,3,693,4.464566929133858
2817889,4,B000PFSYO4,"I'll get right t the point: this film is a very condensed version of the books it's based on.  My main complaints with the title come from the compromises that had to be ,made to accommodate this.  I understand the reason for it though; if you add commercials the film runs at 90 minutes without having to make many cuts, if any at all.  While I'm not a fan of this approach (I would much rather see a longer version on Blu-ray and let them make edits for broadcast) I can't condemn them for being economical in their approach.  I think a lot of people don't realize just how small the audience for this kind of thing really is, so the fact that WB is doing it at all should be commended.

Content wise there was a lot of re-jiggering of the details of some parts of the story to make the key players involved in the action; such as J'onn J'onzz getting in on the fight with Batman in the cathedral, or Hal Jordan teaming with Ric Flagg on the Mars mission, to the exclusion of Flaggs love interest.  However, these changes do the job of keeping the focus on the superhero cast.  After all, these are the characters that are selling the film, not the Martian Manhunter's human police partner.

There is a feeling of rushing through scenes to get as much in a possible.  By doing this I feel that the producers have sacrificed a lot of atmosphere and tension that is inherent in the story.  Certain minor characters, such as Green Arrow, have been reduced to little more than a fly-by cameo, so don't let the package art fool you into thinking you're gonna get a huge roster of characters to play with.  There are a lot of, ""blink and you miss them"" moments that touch upon things from the book, but they go by pretty quickly.

I bought the Blu-ray version of this film and it looks nothing short of spectacular in high definition.  The images are crisp, bright and colorful without any line pixelazation or de-interlace artifacts.

The sound is, likewise, very punchy.  There isn't much in the way of surround or very deep bass, but it's clear and precise when they are used.  There felt to be a little imbalance between music and dialouge volume, but nothing painful.

The cast was uniformly good, although I'm not sure what the producers saw in David Boreanez as Hal Jordan.  I absolutley loved both Jeremy sisto and Kyle Mclaughlin as batman and Superman respectively.  Jeremy Sistos Batman puts Rino Romano to shame, and gives the gerat Kevin Conroy a run for his Bat-Money.  I never, in a thousand years, would have pegged Kyle Mclaughlin as a Superman character, but he brings just the right amount of serious tone and 50's all-american swagger that this version of the character needs.  Migul Ferrera is an actor that has really excelled since picking up voice work and is great as the Martian Manhunter.  While the rest of the cast is good, no one else really jumped out at me like these guys did.  As for D.B. as Jordan... Maybe I just never really got the character but I just didn't feel it so much.

The film is worth having if you're a fan of either the book or the time period.  Yes, it's a little dark and mature in places, but that is in keeping with the source material.  It's not a kids film and isn't being sold as a ids film.  It's light on screen time for some of the heavy hitter characters, like Bats, Supes and WW, but they make an impact when they do appear.  This is also in keeping with the source material.  This is more the story of Hal Jordan taking steps to become the Green Lantern we all admire, and not so much about the adventures of the fully formed hero.  You can see how the seeds would be laid for the Justice League to appear in this universe.  This may rub some who are fans of the modern age JLA the wrong way, but this is a different time and carries different attitudes.  Worth the purchase, definitely worth the Blu-ray.",1204243200,6,3865,4.415254237288136
2817890,5,B000PFSYO4,"I admit, I'm a child of the Silver Age of DC Comics! I grew up on Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, the Flash, Green Lantern, the Atom, Adam Strange...and especially the Justice League of America. So I admit, ""Justice League - The New Frontier (Two-Disc Special Edition)"" brought a lump to my throat...it was like being a kid, again!

Based on Darwyn Cooke's remarkable, nostalgic reworking of the birth of the Silver Age heroes during the transitional 1950s, the animated film homages the characters I grew up, loving (especially test pilot/Green Lantern Hal Jordan, the Martian Manhunter, and police scientist/Flash Barry Allen), in the context of the era, a decade of Communist paranoia, McCarthy witch hunts, the birth of the Space Age, and struggle for racial equality. One element Cooke 'lifted' from Frank Miller's ""Dark Knight"" epic, that of the government ordering superheroes to 'stand down', fits this saga exceptionally well, with Superman as the only 'approved' hero, Batman refusing to, thus becoming a wanted fugitive, and the 'Golden Age' heroes forced into retirement (I was disappointed not seeing more of the JSA, other than in the opening credits, but there are a LOT of characters that DO appear!)

Of course, a new, unstoppable, super-powered villain (the primeval, immortal 'Centre') picks this time to eradicate the human race, quickly knocking Superman out of the battle, and requiring the new generation of heroes, teamed with Batman and Wonder Woman, to save the world.

There are SO many touches I loved! A reworking of Hal Jordan's origin as Green Lantern; the romances of Supes and Lois Lane, Jordan and Carol Ferris, and Barry Allen and Iris West; heroes I hadn't seen in years (the Challengers of the Unknown and the Blackhawks), fighting along side Adam Strange, Green Arrow, Aquaman, and even a pre-Atom Ray Palmer; the superhero 'Air Force', with Wonder Woman's invisible airplane, and the Bat-plane and Arrow-plane. Admittedly, many characters don't get much screen time, but with a cast this large, it is understandable (it would be a problem of the ever-growing JLA of the comics, as well).

I have to mention the voice talent involved, as the casting was dead-on! David (TV's 'Angel') Boreanaz as Jordan, Neil Patrick Harris ('Doogie Howser') as Allen, Kyle ('Twin Peaks') MacLachlan as Superman; Lucy ('Xena') Lawless, a PERFECT Wonder Woman, Kyra ('The Closer') Sedgwick as Lois, Brooke Shields as Carol, Vicki Lewis as Iris...this is truly an all-star affair! Two voice performers deserve special recognition; Miguel Ferrer is exceptional as the Martian Manhunter, combining an alien aloofness with compassion; and Jeremy Sisto has, arguably, the BEST voice for Batman I've ever heard...he really IS the Dark Knight!

While I admit Darwyn Cooke's original story far outshines the film (original stories nearly always do), as someone who only sporadically looks at comics, these days, ""Justice League"" is a fabulous 'blast from the past'.

2817893,3,B000PFSYO4,"I happened to see this at Blockbuster and rented it. glad I did. I would not have wanted to waste my money and buy it.

First off...

let me just say I have no problem with the silver age comics. i have no problem with haveing storys where superheros are not in their masks, or in more human stories. that is not my problem with this video.

Yes the art was good. yes there were some interesting elements. and the fact thats its a movie they can use stock fotage of Kenddys speech.

my beef with this is that DC THE NEW FRONTIER was a long seres and was put into a two volume graphic novel.

this seres/graphic novel is presented in the movie HOWEVER the movie is only 75 minuts long. I have the feeling the producers did not have a lot of mony to make a longer movie.

the graphic novel is interesting and I like it.

but I did not much care for this movie.

why?

well for one thing there is alot of material left out. now with some things I can live with that. they cant have everything. however the things left out are some important plot points. such as the segificance of dinosaur island. and other important plot points which are not in the movie.

i don't mind that the 'center' is not fully explained.
however it was a bit confusing. i was not sure at first the monster at the end was the center till it spoke.
some more dialog to explain this would have been helpful.

the charterisation is rather low and some charturs just waltz along with little introduction. some chartures change their motivation without much effort.

so the result is from this low charterisation, material from comic not adapted, lost plot points etc
only results in a rather short almost incoherent movie.

events happen just a bit to quickly. there is not much charture depth. and some story elements are not well developed.

which is a shame because again it was a good comic.

so my advice is to buy the comic NOT the movie.
rent the movie don't buy it.

this movie could have been much better.",1204156800,3,2052,4.329842931937173

It did do a good job of following the graphic novel but some scenes in the graphic novel were cut out. The animation and coloring were also quit good but not the best. In this story, the US have now entered the Cold War. The US government is now under control of the entire US. Prejudice, ignorancy and distrust have tooken control of the American people and they now distrusts superheroes and the Justice Society of America has been forced to retire. Superman and several other superheroes such as Wonder Woman, Batman and Flash however are not. They want to help the world and create a new league of superheroes and put an end to all the prejudice and ignorances. A ""dinosaur island"" has been discovered to be an ancient monster known as The Centre. It is older then time itself and it posesses human-like intelligence and has existed on the Earth since time began. It believes humans to be a menace and now seeks to annihilate all of humanity. It produces reptilian and bird-like creatures who resemble dinosaurs, pterosaurs and H.P. Lovecraft-like monsters in high numbers and is probably the source of all the superheroes' problems. Superman and the other heroes must fight this extraterrestrial beast and prove to the US that they are needed and prejudice and ignorance need to stop. As they fight the beast, they are joined by new heroes such as Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, Challengers of the Unknown and Blackhawks.

You might also enjoy the DVD extras for I really did. My favorite was the documentary of the Legion of Doom, an alliance consisting of the world's nastiest villains. You'll enjoy watching this extras, learning about the nasty villains on how they came to be and the important roles they have played in good vs. evil and the history of comics.

Another includes the history of the Justice League of America. This one
explains the birth of the Justice League of America and the history they have played in comic books.

If you enjoyed Darwynn Cooke's graphic novel Justice League:The New Frontier, then you might enjoy this full-length animated feature. It has an epic storyline and explains the birth of the Justice League of America, but some scenes from the graphic novel were not put in. In spite of this, I enjoyed this animated film. You might also if you enjoyed the graphic novel. It was good but I felt that they could have at least done alot better. It's not the best but it's not bad. But you might enjoy it. However I do prefer the graphic novel over the animated film.

2817896,5,B000PFSYO4,"New Frontier is comprehensive in its scope and presentation. The complexity of the historical time period will be lost on many, especially children. Some would recommend that this film not be show to children. I agree it is particularly violent and fearful in places. As a parent, I recommend you screen it first, then watch it WITH your child (age six or seven and up). Take time out to describe our nation's positions during this tumultuous time of our history, discuss the real need we faced to raise the bar in our country's moral and ethical landscape.

If you're not planning on watching it with your child, and it's not in you to appreciate/communicate the themes of this phenomenal piece of literature, you should probably give this film a pass. This is an opportunity however for you, as a parent, to lead your child into higher order thinking, while simultaneously enjoying a fun night with him/her.

Will it scare your little one? Probably... but seated right beside the fear resides the daunting challenge and the hope that we can overcome our fears when we work together and hold to a higher set of ideals. This film captures the human spirit--and the American spirit. There is no way I'd let my two young ones miss this film. We watched it together, and you'd be surprised how much they are capable of taking in and processing.

Adult fans of comics will not be disappointed in anything other than what didn't make the movie from the graphic novel. It's a five star offering from DC and Warner, worthy I believe of Academy Award consideration.",1204156800,5,1557,4.7380073800738005

It looked good (usually when the animation was taken directly from the comic) and the voice casting was a good fit (if a tad monotonous after a while) and there were some genuinely affecting sequences, but in the rush to condense things, the scope and soul of the source have been lost.",1204070400,7,743,4.66412213740458

Every character had to be introduced with back story included and every character had to have his or her own showplace.  Don't we already KNOW their backstories?  Don't we already know what powers they have and what they can do?  Do we need tacked on characters?  Green Arrow, Robin, and Aquaman were just there for us to see how well animated they were and that was about it.

2817899,4,B000PFSYO4,"The New Frontier, Darwyn Cooke's loving homage to DC's Silver Age, gets the animated treatment in this highly anticipated DC animated movie, Justice League: The New Frontier.  Taking place in the early-mid 1950's, at the height of McCarthy-ism and America's fear of communism, an evil force called The Centre (voiced by Keith David) is coming from the underground to wipe out all of humanity.  In the middle of all this is jaded pilot Hal Jordan (voiced by David Boreanaz), who will soon discover his destiny as the Green Lantern; then there is Barry Allen (voiced by Neil Patrick Harris), known as The Flash, who finds himself being hunted by the government; and then there is the Martian Manhunter J'onn J'onzz (voiced by Miguel Ferrer), the last of his kind who feels The Centre approaching.  All of whom soon enough stand united with Superman (voiced by Kyle MacLachlan), Batman (voiced by Jeremy Sisto), and Wonder Woman (voiced by Lucy ""Xena"" Lawless, which seems like a no-brainer) with the fate of the world hanging in the balance.  For fans of Cooke's original New Frontier series, you'll be pleased to know that this animated take retains much of Cooke's visual art style and atmosphere.  What really hurts Justice League: The New Frontier is that cramming all of Cooke's smart and intelligent take on the Silver Age into one 75 minute feature is really noticable.  The feature just feels overly rushed after the first 40 minutes or so, and never really lives up to the potential that gets set early on.  Also, other heroes like Adam Strange and Green Arrow pop up out of nowhere, although Aquaman's appearance ends up being surprisingly enjoyable.  That being said though, there is still much to admire here for older comic fans and fans of Cooke's work as well, and there is a horde of voice talent including John Heard, Joe Mantegna, Kyra Sedgwick, and Brooke Shields in supporting roles.  All in all, while not perfect, Justice League: The New Frontier is a more than solid take on Cooke's work, and the surprisingly good special features on this two-disc edition (two commentaries including one by Cooke, an insightful documentary ranging from the Golden Age to today, a handful of Justice League TV episodes) really make The New Frontier worth picking up.",1204070400,31,2271,4.908616187989556
2817900,4,B000PFSYO4,"The Jutice League has been around in the comics for ages. It was a brilliant way for DC to get all their major characters into the same book without always, say, having to have Batman visit Metroplolis. The JLA wasn't the first super-hero group, but it was the most popular.

""Justice League: The New Frontier"" takes the League back to the early 1950's. It was a time when America was easily spooked, and folks like McCarthy had far more power than they should ever be allowed.

The movie begins with pilot Hal Jordan being shot down at the end of the Korean War, the arrival of a Martian on Earth and a sinister voice talking about the Centre and the end of the world. Gradually all the characters we know and love (Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, etc), are introduced and the story kicks into high-gear as they try to fight the Centre and deal with a paranoid US government.

The movie's animation and style are incredible. They very nicely capture the feeling of the 1950's Heck, I was even giggling a little with impressed glee at the menu!

Along with the animantion, the acting and story are both quite good, though the story really suffers from a feeling of being incomplete. This is likely due to the extremely short run-time (75 minutes). You simply cannot do a really good epic story with this many characters in that short of an ammount of time. Not if you want to, as it were, do it justice. On the plus side, the main character in the story is Green Lantern, and he's always been a personal favorite of mine.

Still, I recommend the movie. I don't know how it compares to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DC-The-New-Frontier-Vol-1/dp/1401203507/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DC: The New Frontier, Vol. 1</a>&nbsp;cause I haven't read it.

2817901,2,B000PFSYO4,"As a fan of the original graphic novel and DCU's cartoons, I must admit this release was highly dissappointing. Rather than keep the original's dramatic pulse, ""Justice League - The New Frontier"" is satisfied with a bloodless adaptation. Gone are the truly original character designs -replaced by polished clones more reminiscent of their DCAU counterparts. The musical score -often the highlight of WB's cartoons- is cut off abruptly between scenes, giving the impression of a cut-and-paste production, and fails to produce a cohesive thematic picture or quicken the pulse. Too many corners have been cut...and while I appreciate the attempt at an honest adaptation, I think that anyone who has really appreciated the original comics can recognize that their spirit has been lost in translation. This is perhaps most noticeable during JFK's speech at the end, which, unlike in the comics, now seems like a tired -and not a little bizarre- afterthought with little dramatic import to the events we've just witnessed.

While others have complained about the emphasis on the b-rate characters, I felt that their stories could've used even more time. As it is, all the heroes seem sort of shoehorned in, and the abstract threat of the centre is made far too explicit. The result: nothing is interesting, intriguing, or mysterious.

""The New Frontier"" would've been better done in the truly art deco days of Batman: The Animated Series -before the designers decided to make everything easier, shorter, and therefore cheaper to animate.",1204070400,5,1531,5.219512195121951

Here's what I got: some guy named ""The Center"" writes a book containing his manifesto, then kills himself.  Years later, he is reincarnated as a sentient floating dinosaur island with planets inside of him?  Huh?  On top of that, we have a mysterious cult worshipping him, although we are never given any clue as to how they communicate with ""it"" or how it possesses their bodies to speak through them.  We are also never told what this thing wants, like if it is alien, or trying to destroy the Earth, and why would other humans help it?  The story could also have used a little more focus on the rest of the JLA, or simply call it a Green Lantern movie.  The art style was great, recalling Jack Kirby, although I thought Wonder Woman came off looking more like a drag queen.  Being a huge fan of the DC Animated Universe, I was looking forward to a fresh take on the JLA, but this came as a huge disappointment.",1204070400,5,1159,4.304147465437788
2817904,5,B000PFSYO4,"Generally excellent animated film about the formation of DC comics' premier superhero team, the Justice League of America.  Two elements make this movie rather unique: 1) The origin of the League is actually an incidental element in a story that's really about paranoia, prejudice, and a country losing its way, and 2) the story is set in the 1950's. On that second point, the choice of timeframe isn't as strange as it sounds, because the initial Justice League comic book stories were set in that same period.

Here, however, subject matter such as McCarthyism and the other serious elements mentioned above are liberally included when they were nowhere to be found in the original comics.  What's interesting is that everything combines fine: the more serious themes aren't at all at odds with the superhero action, which actually becomes more dramatic knowing that dark government mechanisms and motivations are possibly influencing our heroes' obstensibly heroic actions.

My single-disc version of ""Justice League: The New Frontier"" includes the 75-minute film; two commentary tracks; an excellent 41-minute documentary about the various comic book and television versions of the Justice League that have appeared over the years; and a generous preview of the upcoming direct-to-DVD animated ""Batman"" film now in the works.  I understand that the two-disc version of this film includes an additional documentary about the artistic choices made in adapting the original ""DC: The New Frontier"" comic book mini-series (yes, the original work had a slightly different title) into the animated film; three episodes of the ""Justice League"" animated TV show (which is not set in the same 1950's time frame/continuity as the film); and one or two other small things.  The one-disc version was generous enough for my tastes.

""Justice League: The New Frontier"" is perhaps not blazingly original.  Superhero stories have grown up over the years and story elements such as the government wanting to register and control all superheroes, superheroes having to deal with relevant social issues, etc. are things that are now seen fairly often in comics and movies.  Still, seeing these elements employed with DC's usually upbeat and optimistic heroes, in a bright, stylish 1950's setting, no less, is very interesting.  And the action, music, and voice characterizations are top notch, too.

If you're a fan of comic books or superhero stories, you'll enjoy this DVD.  If you're a fan of both of those things, you'll really enjoy it.",1204070400,12,2525,5.253731343283582
2817905,4,B000PFSYO4,"Great characters. Great style and animation. Decent story. Good movie. I learned about the Justice League from my dad (now 50) during the late 1980s, just before 'Batman' came out. I was just a couple years too young and missed the wave of the DC Super Powers Collection. At this time, Superfriends wasn't airing (not on any channel I got), Superhero toys were in hiatus, and comics sales were slow. I watched the 1966 Batman movie on a daily basis. Dad told me origin stories every Saturday from Batman & Robin to Flash and Green Lantern. When they released the DC Comics Super Heroes Action figures I was hooked.

JLNF is the embodiment of everything I ever learned from my Dad (and later read) about the Silver Age incarnations of the heroes of the Justice League. The original story is a great throwback and homage from writer Darwyn Cooke, to the same age of comics he and my dad both grew up with. With the real-world, historical backdrop, great characterizations, and score, this film gets a solid four out of five stars.

Criticism: Too short. After a brilliant setup, the story drops off too quickly due to time constraints. Had the story been longer, I think we could have seen a lot more of what we signed up for. It could have been more action packed. While 'Superman: Doomsday' was more action oriented, 'JL: New Frontier' falls short on excitement. However, JLNF had the deeper elements of characters that seemed to be lacking from SD. While JLNF was much better than SD, in a way, it seems as though they each had something the other was missing. A lot of the characters are mere cameos, but considering time constraints, it's understandable. It's a better experience to see Aquaman, Green Arrow, and others as cameos than not at all.

Despite statements from the creators, repeatedly explainting that JLNF is in NO WAY an extension of the JL Animated Series (which should be painfully obvious), negative reviewers still constantly compare the two. What's with that? I just don't get it.

As far as violence and language goes... Check the PG-13 rating. The MPAA doesn't just make them for kicks. This is a story for an older and more mature audience. It's really intended for anybody who knows and appreciates the Silver Age of DC comics. Many of those people being over 40. It's been stated many times that this movie is for ""fans"".

It could have been better, but I find myself fairly satisfied. One HUGE plus to the 2-disc DVD is the special features. There are two great featurettes, one about the evolution of the JLA, and one about the ""Pathology of the Supervillain"". They include Paul Levitz, Marv Wolfman, Bruce Timm, Mark Waid, and others. Also included is a sneak peak at the upcoming 'Batman: Gotham Knight'. There are also three episodes from 'Justice League Unlimited' included. Each episode featuring a story with integral characters from the film, Ray Palmer (The Atom), Colonel Flagg, and King Faraday.

If you're expecting to see more things that you've already seen in the Justice League Animated Series, you'll probably be disappointed. But if you have an appreciation for where comics came from, an understanding of the history of Justice League, you've read Cooke's original story, or want to see something involving the JL that you might not have seen before, try it. You might like it.",1204070400,2,3324,4.792321116928447

If they can't (or won't) do live-action movies like Marvel has done successfully, at least we DC fans can have something to look forward to and watch with enthusiasm.

It's not today's JLA, or even yesterday's.  It's an alternative.  And it was pretty darn good.  I loved the personalization of the characters on this DVD, in particular Hal Jordan (AKA Green Lantern) and J'onn J'onzz (AKA Martian Manhunter).  And the anti-feminine, vengeful Wonder Woman?  Intriguing.

If you're looking for a true fight 'em and win movie, this isn't it.  This movie was more about the origins of the 50s characters than them banding together to fight a powerful otherworldly villain.  The ""action"" doesn't start until about 3/4 in, as another reviewer noted and was subsequently disappointed.  However, it was the character depth and development of the DVD that postponed the ""action,"" and I say, ""BRAVO.""  I'm more about the writing than fighting.  Anyone can write a fight scene, but I think it takes true talent to develop your characters and get the audience to feel something for them before involving them in something major action-wise.  In fact, the battle scenes were a bit disappointing after getting to know the JLA characters on DVD that I've already known and loved for years from the comics.  Each one has an interesting story, and I wanted more of that.  But I understand that you have to wrap things up sometime and form a league, so...

The animation wasn't top-notch, but I don't think it is intended to be.  It's intended to have a 50s/60s feel (like the time period of the movie), and it succeeds in that regard.  In fact, it's better than all superhero animation from that time period (think the early Fantastic Four and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man-The-67-Collection-6-Volume-Animated-Set/dp/B0001I55O2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man - The '67 Collection (6 Volume Animated Set)</a>&nbsp;cartoons).

I'm in the middle of watching the extras on the two-disc special edition set, but as a comic book geek, I'm loving it.  Seeing the history of the JLA through the Golden, Silver, Bronze, and Modern ages of comic books was fun and nostalgic.  And watching the interviews of some of my favorite writers was pleasing to put a face with a name.  I can't wait to see what else is in store on the Extras that I have yet to watch!

All in all, I'm very happy with my purchase and I hope that DC continues to put forth ""adult"" animated superhero movies worthy of their characters and the DC name.",1204070400,2,3370,5.680638722554891
2817907,4,B000PFSYO4,"So like most everyone else who saw the preview for this movie on the Superman Doomsday DVD, I preordered this movie when it was available. The animation is great, the story is solid, and the characters have solid dialogue. I haven't read the graphic novel, only seen the movie, but I intend to read the graphic novel soon. One of the few downsides is the final battle is a little disappointing. I was glad to see the Superman did not save the day, but all the other characters.

Hal Jordan is one of my favorite characters in DC Comics. Over the years, we have wanted to see him animated. The super friends didn't do him justice. Over the years, Bruce Timm has told great stories with the Batman, Superman, and the Justice League animated series. But we never saw Hal Jordan except for a cameo appearance in a time traveling episode on Justice League. He is, afterall, the greatest Green Lantern. So I was stoked to see him in this film. I was even more excited to see that his origin story and how he came to get the ring was told correctly. Hopefully, we will get to see more work from the DC Universe with Hal Jordan in the future.

One last thing. Batman was not played by Kevin Conroy. For those of you who don't know that name, he is the voice actor who played Batman in the animated series and the Justice League series. It is strange not hearing Kevin's voice in this film, however, this new actor does well. It takes a little getting used-to, but it does work. Highly recommended.",1203984000,2,1489,4.410909090909091

2817911,4,B000PFSYO4,"This animated film is from the creators of the DC Comics Animated Universe (""Batman: The Animated Series"", ""Superman: The Animated Series"", ""Justice League Unlimited""), and based on Darwyn Cooke's famous miniseries ""DC: The New Frontier"", chronicling the emergence of the Justice League and the Silver Age DC universe in the 1950s.

I wasn't a huge fan of the original story; I quite liked the idea of the story, but how it was actually told just didn't click for me, because of the art (which I found unsuited to the subject; it's hard to take seriously a story where all the women are cherubs) and the crowded, unfocussed story. However, I am a huge fan of the DCAU animation crew, so having them adapting it was a huge plus, and I figured that the need to cut for a 75 minute movie would actually work to the story's benefit. And, indeed, that's the case here.

There's been a lot of characters and scenes excised, but what there is almost qualifies as a photographic/word-by-word reproduction of the book. Cooke was involved in the DCAU (Batman Beyond especially), so his work translates very well to the Timm animated world. On the stuff that was cut, principally:

1. The Losers and the Challengers, apart from Ace Morgan.
2. Minor cameos in the book are cut down to visual cameos here, including Green Arrow and Adam Strange.
3. In particular, the really dumb scene with all the mystical heroes deciding not to help stop the destruction of the world because this is `a new age' isn't here, which is a huge plus.
4. The only really notable scene from any of the kept plots that isn't here is Superman's visit to Themyscira and his conversation with Diana about leadership; instead, there's a scene with Lois that addresses basically the same theme.
5. The `John Henry' plot, which is confined to a news report here.

The story itself is still basically focussed on Hal and J'onn (it feels even more Hal-centric here than the book, maybe because they cut all the thought monologues, which affects J'onn a lot more than Hal). One of the things that I do credit the book for is writing one of the few versions of J'onn I've ever found interesting; conversely, the book-Hal is saddled with some truly horrid dialogue, which is absent here, so that's another plus for the film.

My one real complaint: incredibly, despite the fact that her part is minor, the DCAU crew finds room to screw up Wonder Woman's mythos. In the book, the scene where the Centre overwhelms Themyscira is preceded by a snippet of Diana and some other Amazon cheerfully fencing; in the film, the other Amazon is angry with her, says that many of them want ""new leadership"", and then attacks her. For Heaven's sake, people, the DCAU's botching of the Amazons was already one of the few black marks on the whole enterprise, and you still haven't found time to actually read any of her comics?  That does not fill me with hope for the WW animated movie in the works.

Overall, though, this is a strong effort.",1203984000,5,2981,4.655893536121673
2817912,3,B000PFSYO4,"Take a look at the box.  The three most prominent characters are the DC heavy hitters, Superman, Batman, and Wonderwoman.  Why?  Because those are the characters that the fans want to see.  Those are the characters that are going to sell the movie.  Unfortunately, the big three are merely supporting characters in this film, their roles little more than cameo appearances.  This film brought back unpleasant memories of ""The Superfriends"".  Week after week I would tune in to see Batman and Superman, only to find that the actual story centered around the insipid Wendy and Marvin.

The actual story of this film centers around Green Lantern, Flash, and Martian Manhunter.  I feel that potential buyers should know that before deciding to purchase.  While not as stupid as Wendy and Marvin, they are not nearly on the same level, in terms of popularity, as the Big 3.  I can see why DC sought to obscure that fact with their deceptive marketing.  Nobody wants to buy a DVD about Green Lantern (Green who???).

The packaging and its placement alongside the more child-friendly animation offerings doesn't give an accurate assessmentof the target audience for the film.

Setting the story during America's Red Scare period (first communism, then terrorism..), this Justice League story about how the heroes band together to fight not just a powerful super creature but the fear and suspicion of ordinary people.

Most notable is the juxtaposition of origins of the Martian Manhunter and Superman; the ""Bad"" alien vs. the ""good"" alien. The Flash subplot also reinforces this ""judging by outward appearances"" theme (a guy in a bar says ""Flash must be a commie, always wearing red.."").  The Red Scare is depicted here as well, Batman is treated as a villian and Superman and Wonder Woman are forced to sign ""Loyalty Oaths"" - deeds are not enough, formally stating that you are a ""good American"" is necessary.

The best part of the film is the end, when all the heroes unite to fight ""The Center"" (a reference to William Butler Yeats, ""The Second Coming""?), a giant monster with psychic powers. The heroes convince the army to drop the Left Wing-Right Wing arguments and unite with the heroes to fight the common enemy. A very good speech indeed.

Buy this DVD, even if you are not a Justice League fan.",1203897600,7,1239,4.722222222222222
2817915,4,B000PFSYO4,"Saw this movie on Saturday and was blown away.
YES if you have not read the book things may be slightly confusing but like the creators said at Wondercon, this was made for the fans. People who appreciate DC, Bruce Tom and love serious and faithful takes on these characters. I shall be purchasing this bluray disc version the day it comes out.
Also thumbs WAY UP on the killer soundtrack.
Overall it may be a bit too stylised for some haters but people who love or appreciate atomic age/pulpfiction/Superhero style visuals and love Superman/Batman Wonderwoman/Greenlantern should take a look at this.
Also one of the coolest interpretations of Batman, from his voice to is lines, just wicket.
4 stars, minus one for possible confusion among non DC/comic readers. This is a super faithful adaption of New Frontier and a trillion times better than the Superman Doomsday which I did not like.",1203897600,7,890,4.8618421052631575
2817916,4,B000PFSYO4,"The creative team behind ""Superman: Doomsday"" and ""Justice League Unlimited"" explore the origins of the Justice League in the latest animated adventure ""Justice League: The New Frontier"". Set in the 1950s, the US Government has taken serious actions against superheroes and forcing some to become fugitives. When a powerful entity known as the Center threatens to exterminate all mankind, the world's greatest heroes must put their differences aside and band together against such a powerful enemy.

Its strong and mature storylines are inspiring. The character designs, action sequences and slick animation style are among the animated film's strongest points. ""The New Frontier"" features the fine voice talents of David Boreanaz, Lucy Lawless, Jeremy Sisto, Neil Patrick Harris, Miguel Ferrer, Brooke Shields, Kyra Sedgwick and Kyle Maclachlan.

""Justice League: The New Frontier"" 2-disc Special Edition blows away any previous DC Universe direct-to-video DVD. The animated adventure is presented in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen format.

2817917,5,B000PFSYO4,"It was drawn to symbolize the GOLDEN age of comics it's not that they couldn't do it in a newer style (notice the word newer not better.) it's paying homage to how and why comics where and still can be good with meaning behind their stories and not just mindless violence,
Very good movie. 9/10",1202256000,13,294,4.363636363636363
2817918,5,B000PFSYO4,"This is single handedly the best animated short movie in ages. It's gritty, holds no punches, lacks the weak dialogue that normally plagues the classic super heroes and has a clean style.

Keep in mind this is NOT for a younger audience. There is mild language, and a good amount of blood. This is meant for an older audience, and it benefits from it. Instead of wasting time overly explaining things it just jumps in and expects you to follow. It sucks you in and doesn't let you out.

It's so quick at getting you information, and so efficient that by the end you are amazed how much information you received in an hour and seventeen minutes.

The visual style is superb, looking like a modern cartoon with a lot of classic styles to them. Namely Superman who looks straight out of the original comics. This film is a great origins story for multiple characters and won't let any fan down.

Ontop of all of this you have a stellar voice cast all of who match perfectly to their characters. This is worth purchasing and watching for any Justice League fan, or any fan of the animated series, or super hero films in general.",1201824000,15,1124,4.495098039215686
2817919,2,B000PFSYO4,"Lucy Lawless is a great talent for genre films. In general, there is some great voice direction and acting. The music composer did a great job with moving the film forward. It is too bad that these voices and music are giving life to a story with no ""center"". The subtext has a good morality play for our times, but this is lost among the mess. The saddest part is the lack of quality control on the animation. In one scene some detectives looked like they had no waists. My kids do better (they are young animators themselves). They consistently got things as basic as Superman's uniform wrong. A travesty. Hopefully they didn't spend much money on this...because there are soooo many more worthy projects.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Justice-League-The-New-Frontier-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000PFSYO4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Justice League - The New Frontier (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>",1201651200,9,939,5.911764705882353
