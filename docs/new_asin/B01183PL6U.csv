8723786,5,B01183PL6U,I watched this video in preparation for a repeat cesarean to determine what was being missed and what damages I could mitigate for my newborn. I learned a tremendous amount from this video. For moms who don't really have a choice in the matter and require a cesarean birth there are things you can do to help your baby get some of the benefits from vaginal delivery such as microbiological seeding of your baby's digestive tract with a swabbed culture from your vagina. The benefits of vaginal birth are tremendous and much of those benefits come from the bacterial community they encounter during delivery. I strongly urge all mothers preparing for childbirth to consider this documentary. I purchased a copy for my obgyn as well and he shared it with the midwives in his practice. This video largely shaped my cesarean birth plan.,1455148800,4,832,4.825174825174825
