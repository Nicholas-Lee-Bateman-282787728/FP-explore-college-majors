8298818,1,B001ELTLJ0,"I hardly ever give reviews but this was soooooooo bad I had to. This was the worst acting, strangest script (creepy) terrible writing and looks like they shot it with a flip phone from the 90's. My man Freddy got some ninja skills with the box cutter though...LOL! I only watched it for about 20 minutes and realized I could never get that time back and stopped watching.",1521417600,,371,4.470588235294118
8298819,1,B001ELTLJ0,"I'm with the zero star reviewers. This was so bad: terrible acting, senseless plot, rotten lighting, horrible sets.  Skip this crap.",1515456000,,132,5.285714285714286

8298822,5,B001ELTLJ0,"Low budget film that's so dumb it's entertaining.  Mostly the same actors as were in ""Woods of Evil,"" which is also low budget and dumb, but entertaining.",1502928000,,154,4.703703703703703
8298823,2,B001ELTLJ0,"Bad acting followed by more bad acting. What gang has only 6 people in it? Why are bikers holding the first woman hostage? Why did I waste my time watching this? If you do decide to watch, try not to giggle at the scene (SPOILER) where two of the female gang members pretend to be confused on the address to deliver a pizza. When they go in through the door and take cover I couldn't help but laugh.",1418947200,,399,4.128205128205129
