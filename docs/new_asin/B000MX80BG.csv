8173316,2,B000MX80BG,"Am a long time and experienced passenger train rider in US and Canada.  Rode the original California Zephyr several times and its successor, the Rio Grande Zephyr, a total of 36 times.  Am very familiar with that train which is fortunate because the subject video was very disappointing.  It was disappointing because it showed very little of the interior of the train.  The video showed a monotonous series of similar exterior runbys.",1470787200,,435,5.0
8173317,5,B000MX80BG,"I rode on this right after Amtrak took over the route. Then, it used a all the cars available from the railroads, there was no consistency.",1370476800,,139,4.384615384615385
8173318,3,B000MX80BG,"The photography was excellent, but there were too many redundant scenes.  More time could have focused on the equipment that made up the train.",1351468800,,143,4.958333333333333
8173319,4,B000MX80BG,"Actual riders including the author who rode in the engine gave a true feel of the thrill involved in taking the California Zephyr train from Chicago, to Denver and on through some of the most scenic areas of the West concluding the trip in Oakland. A delight for both train affectionados as well as tourists who plan to ride this special train someday.  Well presented and narrated, delightful scenery and at a fair price. It is so easy to purchase videos of this nature from Amazon in the privacy of your own home and know that the DVD will arrive in a few days and be exactly as the promos describe.",1349568000,2,601,4.414414414414415
8173320,4,B000MX80BG,"A film about a train can be presented as a general travelogue, or,  in this case, a specialized coverage. But if you choose the latter, you need to explain certain inconsistencies, such as, how the Wolverine Limited can start out as a regular train from New York to Detroit and turn into a mixed train between Dearborn MI and Chicago. I was intrigued by a shot, westbound out of Denver, of three trees and the curving track in the distance, the very same trees I photographed in a shot in one of two films I have made on this subject.  The sounds of the train from the engineer's cab made me feel relieved that as a passenger one is not subjected to such noise 8 hours a day. There is a wonderful shot of the eastbound CZ in Illinois disappearing into the clouds of a steam excursion train proceeding in the other direction. The important thing is that there are at least seven films, including two made by myself, on the subject of a train  that, in its original form, has vanished from American railroading.",1213747200,4,1009,4.443243243243243
