8324226,3,B0007KY8C4,"In the beginning of this DVD labeled as level three, Moira welcomes you to a level two workout.  It is indeed a level two workout.  I have done Stott Pilates Core Challenge (level three) many times, Stott Pilates Relaxation Pilates (15 minute level one stretching) many times, and in the past the other mat level two DVD (I forget the name).  This DVD is as slow as the other mat workout I have, but the difference is this workout is shorter by about 10 or more minutes.  I was disappointed because I know the principles, and just need quick reminders during the exercise, not before.",1500249600,,584,4.533333333333333

8324228,5,B0007KY8C4,I was surprised in the way the exercise band was used in the different exercises; and how it intensified the execution of the movements.,1495929600,,136,4.708333333333333

8324230,2,B0007KY8C4,"This is a great DVD if you want a full Pilates lesson. It goes into proper posture and alignment like pilates should. However, if you are like me, and have carved a precious hour out of your morning to get some exercise done, you don't want to spend twenty of those minutes on a 'warmup' which is really a lesson on alignment and doesn't actually warm you up. If you want to take your evenings and dive into the world of Pilates, this is your video. If you actually want to exercise, pick something else.",1287360000,2,504,4.315789473684211
8324231,5,B0007KY8C4,"I am used to doing high impact exercise, but I developed plantar faciatis (heel pain) and had to take a break from my normal routine.  This is a wonderful DVD.  It gives you a great all body workout without any impact.  The muscles all over your body will feel lit up for hours afterwards.

I am in pretty good shape and I am used to lifting weights, but this gives you a similar result without putting stress on your body.  If the workout gets too easy, you can just hold onto the bands at a lower spot and get a harder workout.

This workout not only improves your body, but it improves your mind as well.  It is relaxing and it is a nice and quiet time that you get only to yourself.  I am not sure why the previous reviewer left the review she did.  I felt like I had to correct this error.",1228694400,5,794,4.070967741935484
8324232,1,B0007KY8C4,"I am use to a choreographed pilates dvd or class and based on the fact that this instructor is the ""first lady of pilates"", I expected it to be a great DVD.  The instructor walks through every motion and they do about 2 body band motions and then move on to the next.  It is a constant stop and start.  This has nothing to do with body sculpting.  It may be more of a stretch tape for a 200 year old women but for this being a 3 on a scale of 5 for difficulty, I expected a lot more. I would never recommend this DVD.",1150243200,16,517,3.849056603773585
