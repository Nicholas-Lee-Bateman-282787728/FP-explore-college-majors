3593288,4,B001G0MFLA,If you love CSI NY you will not be disapointed. I really loved and almost watched it all in one sitting.  I look forward to season 6.,1257724800,,133,3.925925925925926
3593289,4,B001G0MFLA,"Killers using avatars to lure people to their doom. A runner shows up at a firesale on wedding dresses and ends up dead from a simple push. A Nazi selling family heirlooms from the Holocaust. The fifth season of CSI:NY continued to have fascinating, challenging stories and changes that would effect the characters personally. This remains my favorite of the ""CSI"" shows (I dislike the overwrought ""CSI: Miami"" compared to the more down-to-Earth ""CSI: NY"" but that's me. When David Caruso takes off his sunglasses and throws out those snappy one-liners it reminds me of a bad Shatner moment).

We have a crew of great guest stars including Ed Asner in an uncharacteristic role (at least this late in his career although he might have played this type of role earlier in his career before ""Mary Tyler Moore"" and ""Lou Grant""--which by the way where IS ""Lou Grant"" on DVD?).

The fifth season looks quite good although there is a noticeable video noise on a number of episodes but, not a surprise, given that there are four episodes on eath DVD. The one issue I have with the fifth season is the lack of commentary tracks. I realize it doesn't matter to everyone but when I watch an episode for a second or third time I like to hear the behind-the-scenes drama/issues that the production crew have.

We get a number of solid extras here which fans will enjoy but I hope that Paramount/CBS will resume including commentary tracks for the next season.",1257033600,7,1446,4.707509881422925
3593290,5,B001G0MFLA,"The feel here is totally different from the mother series--CSI.  Gary Sinese and ALL the cast are great, and really come together as a unit.  Very original stories. Purchased through Amazon. Highly recommended.",1255737600,8,210,5.333333333333333
3593291,5,B001G0MFLA,"I've just purchased CSI NY season 5, and I am thrilled. Each season's episodes of the show get better & better. The quality of the scripts and the great actors are what make a dvd set for me. Like most people, I really don't care whether there are Bonus Features or Special features. Sure, they're nice to have, but I don't buy a dvd for that! I love this show more & more each year & I guess most tv viewers agree with me, because this show is in the top 20 in ratings every week!!! Keep them coming!!!",1255132800,15,503,4.090909090909091
3593292,4,B001G0MFLA,"This is my second time writing a review for CSI:New York, I don't know why they didn't published it but my guess is that my review is too short. All I can say for now is this show is my number 2 favorite crime show on tv.",1254787200,2,221,3.723404255319149
3593293,1,B001G0MFLA,"The slate of C.S.I. 2009 yielded Seasons 9 of the original, 7 of MIAMI & 5 of NEW YORK. I just finished re-watching Season 5 tonight. Season 5 was THE best of the entire franchise of that slate. Storyline, suspense, action, drama, character development, a 25 episode long Jerry Bruckheimer film. In order of greatness, NEW YORK-5, C.S.I. 9 & MIAMI 7, but it ended up with the WORST DVD!

Going in storyline order & overlap to finally BIG names & what else made this season such a spectacle. Mac survives the kidnapping & attempted murder by Ethan Scott, Part 1 in HOSTAGE(Season 4 finale) & VERITAS the Season 5 premiere. 0n location filming in Jersey City, New Jersey. Season 5 began as awesomely as Season 4 ended.

Flack drafting Terrence Davis(Nelly) as a confidential informant, seen in TURBULENCE(cowritten by Gary Sinise), MY NAME IS MAC TAYLOR & the Season Finale PAY UP.

Anne Steele's thumbdrive, first alluded to in Season 4's YOU ONLY DIE TWICE, Brigham Sinclair was worried when it surfaced in SEX, LIES & SILICONE, then again in THE TRIANGLE, HELP, SHE'S NOT THERE, THE PARTY'S 0VER & THE PAST, PRESENT & MURDER. You had secrets that could cripple New York's big power players with Hawkes urged to take a bribe by an old friend to have the thumbdrive destroyed. The fate of the thumbdrive was never resolved. It was suggested it was crushed by a subway car.

The Greek Antiquities Smuggling Ring-THE COST OF LIVING introduced us to Sebastian Diakos & George Kolovos, members of the Greek consulate taking full advantage of their diplomatic immunity. Diakos attacks Stella causing Mac to remove her from the case. Stella will not go quietly into the night & brings in Angell to launch their own off the books investigation of Diakos & Kolovos. When Diakos is found dead, it's revealed the killer is Kolovos who did it to keep Diakos quiet when Diakos is found dead in POINT OF NO RETURN. Stella believes her mentor Professor Papakota is her friend, somebody to be trusted, Stella discovers in the investigation into the death of George Kolovos that it was Papakota's brother Tesso in GROUNDS FOR DECEPTION written by Melina Kanakeredes in her writing debut. Stella follows Papakota to Greece with Mac behind her where the final showdown with Papakota ends in both brothers killed, Kosta by Tesso & Tesso by Mac.

Mac stalked by Ella McBride-*first-MIA/NYC NON-STOP was the first episode of the series, not BLINK, therefore DEAD INSIDE, not MY NAME IS MAC TAYLOR is the real 100th episode*. Ella McBride is confronted with the murder of her father by her mother who discovered that he was in an online affair with his daughter although Ella never knew SHE was the object of her dad's misguided affections. In DEAD INSIDE, Casey LaBow played Ella with great sympathy. Her family has been destroyed & turns Mac into an object of her said twisted affections. This followed into FORBIDDEN FRUIT & NO GOOD DEED when Mac rescues Ella from a suicide attempt.

Inspector Jillian Whitford played by Julia 0rmond who worked with Mac in her pursuit of sex traffickers. Whitford & Taylor partnered up in MY NAME IS MAC TAYLOR, SHE'S NOT THERE(where she pursued the sex trafficking ring which led to the C.S.I. Trilogy that united all 3 shows in the slate of C.S.I. 2010) & THE PARTY'S OVER where she worked the investigation of Kaplan's fraud with Taylor solving the budget cut crisis.

Spinning off from Ethan Scott in VERITAS was the introduction of Samantha Flack, Don's sister played my the brilliant Kathleen Munroe. Eddie Cahill & Munroe were honest & believable as siblings. Samantha was a lost soul with Flack working against the odds to save her from substance abuse revealed in DEAD INSIDE.

Lindsay ending up pregnant in THE BOX, driving Danny to propose marriage. The episode, anchored by Danny's narration was a great arc for both characters with Lucy born in GREATER GOOD.

The department is plagued my budget cuts first alluded to in THE COST OF LIVING when Adam is threatened with termination, the team rallies around Adam by suspending their vacations. The budget cuts are revealed to be from fraud committed by deputy mayor Stewart Kaplan who is found murdered in THE PARTY'S OVER which begat Robert Dunbrook who would pop up again in THE PAST, PRESENT & MURDER & PAY UP introducing CONNOR Dunbrook. Dunbrook, played my Craig T. Nelson, the FATHER of Noah Nelson, a C.S.I. NEW YORK staff writer & producer.

The team goes after skinhead Micheal Elgers in GREEN PIECE & YAHRZEIT. Elgers is vicious, evil & unapologetically racist even taunting Hawkes.

Flack & Angell began a romance in Season 4, their love was sweet with many cute moments. Flack is made to worry about Angell in GROUNDS FOR DECEPTION when Stella reveals she recruited Angell in her case against Diakos & Kolovos. Angell in the course of delivering Connor Dunbrook to court to testify against his father is killed in the line of duty with Mac leading a counter-assaulton the thugs who went after the younger Dunbrook & the scumbag who killed Angell in PAY UP.

You have all of these storylines in this season, many overlapping. A tightrope walk from premiere to finale.

Here are other events, BIG names, MAROON 5 in PAGE TURNER, Nelly as Davis, Ashlee & Pete Wentz in POINT OF NO RETURN which brought back Marty Pino from Season 2 who was an assistant medical examiner to Hammerbeck who fired him when Pino forged overtime slips. Pino was left to harvest heroin from dead bodies, a crime that led to his wife Annabel being killed. Pino at the end threatens suicide & it is Sid left to save him. Jonah Lotan churned out a command performance here after Season 2's TRAPPED, SUPER MEN & RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP. Lotan had his finest hour here. Chris Daughtry was the first AMERICAN IDOL alum seen in this season in MY NAME IS MAC TAYLOR & then we had Katherine McPhee in PREY where she plays Dana Melton, a woman desperately seeking to rid her life of her stalker. Melton takes a forensics class taught by Stella which references cases from Seasons 2 & 3. The murder of Lauren Redgrave in the former's CITY OF THE DOLLS & from the latter season, the murders of Pauline Rayburn in NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE & Sara Jackson in 0PEN & SHUT. Melton uses what Stella teaches her to stage the perfect murder. Which all served as blasts from the past. If there was an Aiden Burn episode, Season 5 would have tied all of the past seasons together.

The DVD followed the franchise's tradition of doing jack sh!+ to highlight ripped from the headlines episodes & no episode was more ripped from the headlines then YAHRZEIT which used of all things, The Holocaust, Nazis & World War 2. The killer in The Holocaust end of the case, Klaus Braun was played with menacing skill by Ed Asner who was nominated for Best Guest Actor in a Drama for the 2010 Emmy Awards. Asner stole the show playing Braun as a Nazi posing as a Jew to escape charges of war crimes. We learn more about Mac & what a man of honor his father was. YAHRZEIT was the SCHINDLER'S LIST of television drama.

This was the best season of the ENTIRE franchise from beginning in 2008 to end in 2009, from the twilight of Bush into the dawning of 0bama. Season 5 of C.S.I. NEW YORK blew both C.S.I. & C.S.I. MIAMI into dust. NEW YORK was flawless during this time. Season 5 was a tour de force but of the 3 shows, it got without a doubt, the WORST F()<KING DVD EVER!!!!!! All of these storylines, events, character arcs, BIG names & breathtaking adventure ended up on a DVD that only offered content on 1 episode, the highly disposable, throwaway MY NAME IS MAC TAYLOR which is almost a self-contained episode. There were so many other BETTER, more substantial episodes but content was pissed away on THIS! I challenge all of my critics to re-watch Season 5 of C.S.I. NEW YORK on DVD to tell me I'm wrong in my assertion that not only was it the worst DVD of the 3 shows for that slate, but the WORST F()<KING DVD OF THE ENTIRE C.S.I. FRANCHISE. Season 4 at least had an overview. Season 5 like 3 before & 6 after had NOTHING that paid any look inside of the behind the scenes, the action & everything else that went in to Season 5. When you all watch Season 5 of C.S.I. NEW YORK on DVD, you will see proof positive how we get raped in the wallet EVERY SINGLE TIME we buy a DVD. What a disconnect, the best of the 3 that season on television, but rendered impotent on DVD.

SEASON 5 OF C.S.I. NEW YORK ON DVD IS AN UNMITIGATED DISASTER!!!!! THERE WAS NO THOUGHT AT ALL PUT INTO ITS PRODUCTION. Look at THE TRIANGLE, Carmine Giovinazzo, Hill Harper & Gary Sinise on top of the Empire State Building tethered to ropes with imminent death from a fall & THE TRIANGLE was ignored, an episode with greater significance on the overall season then MY NAME IS MAC TAYLOR. Season 5 of C.S.I. NEW YORK on television was an event, a 25 episode long Bruckheimer film, on DVD, IT SUCKS!!!! IT SUCKS BEYOND MEASURE. A complete, utter, soul-crushing disappointment. The DVD killed the season. No commentary anywhere, ANYWHERE & this was a season that deserved commentary on almost EVERY single episode. Top dollar, bullsh!+ content!",1254355200,7,9142,4.633950617283951

3593316,3,B001G0MFLA,"A fair season of CSI:NY but not one of the better ones. The season definitely went out with a bang, but the season itself was something of a drag. The series really pushed the envelope of plausibility with some of the writing, including the ""my name is Mac Taylor"" episode or, even more ridiculous, the eyeball dropping into Stella's coffee episode. That one really strained at believably, and made me question how the editors never step in and say, ""Ok, this is just getting silly. It's one thing to have a piece of crime evidence drop randomly from the sky, another thing to have it drop right in front of a CSI detective, but having it drop with perfect precision directly into her coffee cup with just a little splunk?""  That's less CSI and more something supernaturally calculated from a cheesy horror film.
The Montana baby subplot was cute, but seriously, she gives birth and then is literally back at work in the next episode?  Are they really that demanding at the CSI lab? She's depicted as having an extended, painful labor, so wouldn't Mac insist on her taking recovery time?
A couple decent episodes this season (the Ed Asner Nazi episode was a good one) but overall nothing all that great.",1457395200,,1203,4.669811320754717

3593390,5,B001G0MFLA,"Television shows are meant to entertain but, given their wide range of influence, it's wonderful when they take the chance to enlighten. This episode certainly did. An extremely well-written tale takes from a Neo-Nazi murder victim to a self-hating/hiding German Nazi/faux Holocaust survivor, from 2009 Holocaust relics being auctioned off to 1942-1945 when millions, MILLIONS, were rounded up like cattle to simply die, to be pillaged and humiliated, to be murdered. To tell this story, the show highlights terrifying reenactments, images, and stories. But this sadness isn't the only message to permeate through the screen. We learn that Mac Taylor's father was a soldier who carried an Auschwitz survivor, on his back, to safety. We learn that Sheldon's uncle preached peace and tolerance, much like the figure of the Civil Rights Movement, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Though Sheldon doesn't take the bait, Danny certainly does, doing what all the viewers wanted to do, taking down a Neo-Nazi witness after some crude and disgusting remarks.

3593402,3,B001G0MFLA,"It is always a pity to have a basically good season diminshed in enjoyment by a few really awful episodes. After some really wonderfully written and acted episodes we get to the point where Stella takes matters in to her own and even goes off to Greece to solve a crime. What a crock!!! Fortunately it is near the end of the season, but how these clunkers get accepted by the other writers and the actors is beyond me.  I guess to each his own. I assume that some will enjoy this corn, but I was glad the Season ended,",1343692800,,518,4.18
3593403,5,B001G0MFLA,I received the DVD without any hassle.  The price was a better deal then I could have gotten anywhere else.  No problems with this purchase.,1329350400,,140,4.56
3593404,5,B001G0MFLA,"I don't have time to watch network television on a schedule and Tivo/DirectTVing can also be bothersome, so I just buy Season Sets of shows that strike my interest. As far as the CSI franchise is concerned, it took until Season 5 was complete before I ever watched a single episode, but I enjoyed it all through the Grissom years---not so much since.

Although I despise David Caruso as an actor (and, if possible, he has gotten worse through the years of CSI, with his ego dripping all over his horrendously delivered lines and awkwardly cocked head), I listened to suggestions and bought the first season of CSI:MIAMI. It was (and is) also very good----though not as good as the original. I have liked all of the other characters on MIAMI and the story lines have been generally appealing, so I have continued to watch.

I did hesitate a long time before jumping into CSI:NY, as I did not think that yet ANOTHER Crime Scene Investigation show could hold my interest.

WAS I WRONG.

CSI:NY, from the beginning, has been by far the best of the CSI Franchise. Across the board, the acting is superior, the characters and their relationships between and among each other is at least as good as CSI:Orig and much better than MIAMI, and the stories are a much better balance of lab-techno and human interest.

I have just completed viewing SEASON 5, and it was the best yet. Let other reviewers give spoilers---I will avoid that---but the familiarity of the characters and their relationships is what really makes this series. If other viewers complain that there is not enough technical/medical/forensics babble on the program, what can I say? People are enthralled with different things. I prefer the human element standing out within the context of a police/laboratory setting.

I know it will not happen, because CSI:NY is the lowest rated of the three series and barely escaped cancellation at the end of Season 7, but I hope this show runs another 10 years. It deserves it.",1321228800,,1975,4.777126099706745
3593405,5,B001G0MFLA,This series seems to be getting better and better. I didn't think my allegiance could change from the original to a newer one but I have to say that CSI:NY does the trick. Long may it continue (along with my other love CSI:Miami,1314230400,,228,4.325581395348837

3593420,5,B001G0MFLA,"The characters of this version of CSI have not only proven themselves over and over, but managed to take the third outing of the CSI franchise and make it not just another CSI series but their own series. They have their own story lines other than the crimes they solve. They have personality, twists, and a rock solid footing. Season 5 is no different. If anything, season 5 takes the story lines to a new level exploring the relationships of the characters much more deeply. ****** Spoiler**** There is an issue of pregnancy between two of the main characters, issues of with Mac Taylor and his relationship with his superiors, an issue with Stella and her roots, and the list goes on. (Fans of Stargate SG1 may see a familiar face in the Stella situations.) These situations further the bonds all of these characters share. Only to strengthen their relationships with one another. ****** Spoiler alert over ****** Gary Sinise and Melina Kanakaredes are the two main characters, but they share the spotlight equally with the whole cast of this magnificent show. All in all, I found this a very enjoyable season. My only complaint was that I could not get my hands on season 6 fast enough to see where the writers took these characters next. My second complaint would be that this show is very very addictive, as my daughter has said over and over ""You and your CSI!"" Nuff said.  If you are a serious video nut like I am, I highly recommend not only this season but all of the seasons of CSI: NY.

I purchased anyway, and contacted seller by email, to question why priority shipping was not available.  The sellers response was immediate.  Although it was not a general practice offered, upon request, if necessary, the seller would accomodate.  Not only was the dvd shipped priority, the seller did so at no additional cost. I did not assume, by my email, the dvd would be shipped priority nor free of charge.  By the seller extending this courtesy, availabilty of future purchases with this seller will be my first choice.

A big improvement on the characters and their interactions  on a personal level, and the camerawork make these moments heartfelt.
