3659052,1,B001JP62QG,"Ridiculously cheap. This ""documentary"" was slow boring and the host chick was annoying as hell, always cheese smiling to the point of and obvious fake.",1406246400,,151,5.08
3659053,1,B001JP62QG,Substantial as a fart.  It's wonderful and uplifting for the .00000000000000001% of hot shots who can get into the tents.  Meh and double meh.,1395273600,,142,4.875
3659054,2,B001JP62QG,This is a low budget documentary for those who are really into fashion.  I tried this show since there wasn't any Project Runway or Fashion Show available on Prime.  I was disappointed.,1394928000,2,185,4.75
3659055,2,B001JP62QG,"A documentary on NY Fashion Week done right would be fantastic. Unfortunately, this one is boring and shallow. Hope it's replaced by something of value.",1389830400,2,152,5.12
3659056,4,B001JP62QG,"Good overview on fashion week for those that don't know anything about it. Going for the first time next week, so this definitely makes me better prepared.",1378080000,,155,4.777777777777778
3659057,5,B001JP62QG,Here I thought I was going to see about fashion and the shows in the tents. This was a monologue on the life of Nicky Hilton. So boring and really who cares....she must have funded it...,1376956800,,186,4.194444444444445
3659058,1,B001JP62QG,Oh everyone want to do documentaries on fashion. I didn't see anything wow in there. Wouldn't recommend it or watch it again.,1362787200,,125,4.7272727272727275
8313329,2,B001JP62QG,Eh. So vacuous at the start that I couldn't continue to pretend I was shallow enough to watch it. Oh well.,1480723200,,106,4.095238095238095
8313330,4,B001JP62QG,It is going to be a gift for my granddaughter who is taking fashion design in college. I think she will be happy with it.,1479081600,,121,3.88
8313331,1,B001JP62QG,I only made it to 5 minutes. Kudos to anyone that suffered through more.,1466899200,,72,4.214285714285714
8313332,1,B001JP62QG,This is terrible. What a waste of $2!!!! It's like a 1990s home video. Save your time. I wish I could get mine back.,1464393600,,116,3.875
8313333,1,B001JP62QG,dont mean to be mean but...sloppy and poorly edited..and so rife with misunderstood terms.  Actually unintentionally funny.,1463616000,,123,6.235294117647059
8313334,5,B001JP62QG,"As a long-time fan/viewer of all kinds of fashion shows, e.g., Project Runway, Project Runway All-Stars, Project Runway Junior, and the CFDA Fashion Fund competition series (which just completed on Amazon Prime), I really loved this documentary.  Although slightly dated, I highly recommend this well-made video.  If you're a fan of NY Fashion Week, I believe you'll certainly enjoy this.",1461974400,,388,5.45
8313335,4,B001JP62QG,I have to give them some credits. I like the show because it gives me the whole picture of what the fashion show is and it has different angel of views from the people in the show even the perspective of camera man.  I like it.,1457222400,,227,3.9347826086956523
8313336,3,B001JP62QG,A little dated but still entertaining for the fashionista.,1456963200,,58,5.555555555555555
8313337,1,B001JP62QG,The production quality is abysmal. Amazon should be embarrassed to even be streaming this.,1449360000,,90,5.5
8313338,4,B001JP62QG,I felt this was pretty interesting and informing to watch coming from someone who has never been to fashion week.,1429228800,,113,4.7
