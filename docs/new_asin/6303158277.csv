580890,5,6303158277,"I would recommend this DVD to anyone who has seen the show and liked it. I wouldn't suggest this to someone who hasn't seen the show. You really need knowledge of the show to understand the movie. The extras are very cool  and you get both the dubbed and subbed version on one disc! The movie  brings together all the characters from the show. I won't ruin the movie by  saying what its about, but lets just say that everyone ends up getting ship  wrecked on a small island and it just gets going from there. If your a fan  of Ranma 1/2 buy this right away.",923702400,,557,4.168224299065421
580971,5,6303158277,"Now here's somethin you don't see everyday, Ranma girl breasts a jigglin! the writers sure had a lot of fun. This was a cool movie, my favorite of the two. The story is cool, stealing the girls for a man to marry. akane is, of course, the choice of the head guy. the animation is classic, the humor is still top notch, and the girls showing off their skin? Great I especially love the dragon fist and lionheart moves Ranma and Ryoga do. then there's Shampoo...hubba hubba!",1129680000,,472,4.436781609195402
580972,4,6303158277,"I bought this movie not knowing what the heck it was (I'd seen about half of the third series of Ranma 1/2 in Italian), and I watched it on a tiny low color computer. It left me..... in awe. It was a GREAT movie!!! Bet you guessed that by now. After watching this I immediately tracked down the Ranma series and ended up recording series 1-7 off TV... I also bought the entire manga series (in Italian, as far as I know vol. 38 isn't out in English). But on with the review.
There were a few things that I didn't particularly love about this DVD. The plotline is good, but has a few weak spots. It's the usual, Akane is kidnapped by a prince, Ranma goes to save her... but that's why it's good isn't it? (I'm a big R&A fan). There are also a few cute moments for... ((In my opinion)) Kuno and Nabiki, Ucchan and Ryoga, and even Shampoo and Mousse! Not to mention Ranma and Akane.
There are some great extras on this DVD, like the relationship chart, that gives you brief clip that shows the relationship. (Example: Kuno loves pigtailed girl. ""Oh pigtailed girl thank the heavens you're safe!"" *Gets kicked into the dirt by Ranma*) . Both the dubbed and subtitled versions are good, but in the sutitled version, Ranma NEARLY says that he LOVES Akane, while in the dubbed he... almost says he loves her. Get it? There are also trailers for the Ranma TV series and the OAVs, not to mention other Viz videos. Overall, it's worth the money, and is really fun to watch!!",1071619200,4,1464,4.366300366300366
580973,5,6303158277,"This movie was much better then the first one. This is the first anime i have seen thats better in the english version then the japenese version.  It is a must have for any Ranma fan.  The only problem with it is that there is too much showing of the girls (if u know what i mean) The first one wasn't like that and because of that. now i can not show it in my schools anime club. A sham yes but i can't complain on normal standards. It seems to have too much in comon with the first one. For instance, Akane is kidnaped and is chosen to be someone's bride, The kidnaper is a prince of a place few have heard of, and in the end they become friends. (also Kuno and his boat) Although i can't get by the fact that it was better then the first. I mean lots more action, and the fights are longer, plus Ranma isn't the only one u get to see fight. Buy it, laugh, and enjoy.",1064880000,,869,3.9318181818181817
580974,4,6303158277,"Personally, I loved this movie. It has all the sly humor, interpersonal relationship fire, and action/adventure that the Ranma anime and manga have. Well drawn as always, with all the known English voices (Sarah Strange still doing boy Ranma). But... a good part of the movie is the T&A. Girl Ranma's (in a tight and revealing tank top!), and Ukyo in a plunging spaghetti-strap dress, and Nabiki in I do't know what the heck it is, but it exposes a lot, and Shampoo, not that it matters since she's an exhibitionist anyway. Even Kasumi has a clingy outfit on. Not a big deal for true fans of anime, since the Japanese are frank about sex, but for young American kids... it might be something to consider. As for the story line, well, Akane gets kidnapped yet again. Ho hum, right? Well, mostly... but there are some interesting twists and humor to this, and the sondtrack is lively, too.",1048723200,2,887,4.620253164556962
580975,5,6303158277,"The movie is a really cute one, especially if you like shojo parts. As in the first one(can't they think of anything else?)Akane gets kidnapped and forcd to marry a prince, who, by the way looks like he is barely nine. The other girls get taken too and Ranma and Co. go rescue them. All the guys are wearing shorts, so they look kinda weird, especially Mousse. The girls get these skimpy clothes on the island they are taken to and girl-type Ranma is seen topless once. Mousee tries to save Shampoo and it is really sweet. OOOOO! I love those scences! There is also a spring on the island that turns every thing it touches in to a man........
The Dvd has some boring extra features that aren't worth looking at, so buy the video and save yourself some cash!",1045180800,,757,4.375886524822695
580976,5,6303158277,"The second theatre release of the Ranma  series is great!  NIHAO MY CONCUBINE is just as good if (in my opinion) better than BIG TROUBLE IN NEKONRON CHINA.  The whole gang is back in this wild vacation gone wrong.  It's your classic Ranma comedy with a new adventure and a great movie all around.
This one starts out as Kuno gets a new yacht and he wants to take the Pig Tailed girl (female Ranma) and Akane on a vacation cruise.  After the gang invites themselves on Kuno's vacation, the gang, Ryoga, Mousse, Soun, Genma, Happosai, Cologne, Shampoo, Ukyo, Nabiki and Kasumi, they find themselves shipwrecked and stranded on an island.  Mysteriously, the girls start disappearing!  After catching the culprits trying to kidnap Ranma, they find out that Prince Toma and his lackeys, Wonton, Torisutan and Sarotoru, are kidnapping girls and preparing them to compete to be the bride of Toma.  He then tells Akane that if she refuses to come with him, he'll turn her into a man using a magical water and he demonstrates on a lobster.  After the Jusenkyo guys see this (Ranma, Genma, Ryoga and Mousse), they realize that they can be cured!  It's now up to the boys and Cologne to save the girls and cure themselves of the curse.
O.k. first off, this movie is a little shorter than the first (it's about an hour) but I assure you, it's very worth it.  This one is even funnier than NEKONRON and the other guys (Ryoga, Mousse and Kuno) get a lot more play in this one than the first one.  Plus the fight scenes are pretty good, like the brawl in the great hall of Toma's throne room and of course the one on one match ups of the boys against Toma's henchmen.  Kuno vs Wonton is just funny as hell, Mousse vs Torisutan is awesome!  It showcases Mousse's techniques and it has a really funny twist during the fight.  Ryoga vs Sarotoru isn't as good as the other 2 but at least Ryoga does his SHI-SHI HOKODEN technique.  By far, the final fight between Ranma and Toma is excellent.  It's'a very cool fight beginning to end and of course Ranma does his special technique, NO NOT ""THE RUN AWAY!"", the HYRYUSHOTEN-HA.
Out of the 3 Ranma  theatre releases (BIG TROUBLE IN NEKONRON CHINA and TEAM RANMA vs THE PHOENIX), NIHAO is my favorite.  It's a definite if you're a Ranma fan and it should be in your collection.  If it's not, check out NIHAO MY CONCUBINE.  And don't forget to check out the OAV series, BIG TROUBLE and of course the many episodes that make up the series.  Enjoy!",1044403200,,2471,4.493273542600897
580977,5,6303158277,I think this movie is so great! It's funny and excellent. A perfect gift for any Ranma fan!,1031011200,,91,4.111111111111111
580978,4,6303158277,"I've watched this in both English and Japanese, and found the English track to be hilarious!  There is slight nudity (Ranma-chan) when her shirt is pulled off by that old pervert (ya know who I'm talking about).  The plot is very interesting, but in this movie and the first one, it's all about rescuing Akane.  But in this one, at least Mousse has more screen time, not to mention Akane's sisters and the rest of the Ranma cast.  Shampoo's broken english sounds bad in English, but it's better in Japanese.  The characters are hilarious, all the ones transformed from the magical water on the island.  Mostly humor, as with most Ranma movies/episodes, and best suited for a 13 and up audience.",1008115200,4,694,4.694214876033058
580979,5,6303158277,"Nihao My Concunine was the first movie of Ranma 1/2 that I first purchased. Pretty much the entire cast of characters was in it (Ranma, Akane, Nabiki, Kasumi, Soun, Genma, Ryoga,Tatewaki Kuno, Shampoo, Ukyo, Happosai,Mousse, and Cologne). This movie was the best anime theatrical movie I have seen.  The plot of the movie is that Kuno has made a boat and invites the Pig-tailed Girl ( Female Ranma) and Akane. The others just invite themselves. The boat shipwrecks on a Island, and the girls, except Cologne, are all kidnapped. Ranma and the other men than decide to go after them on a floating Island named Togenkyo.

580980,5,6303158277,"I have been a fan of Ranma 1/2 since my high school days, and way before Pok&eacute;mon was advertising it on it's videos.  I have been involved in the fanfiction/fansites and fanclubs that follow this wonderful series from the genius mind of Rumiko Takahashi, and I think I can safely say that this is one of the best Ranma 1/2 plot lines out of all of the animated features (OAV, TV and Movie included) ever done.
I do not want to spoil the movie for you if you haven't seen it, but the basic plotline is that Ranma and the gang head out to sea in Kunou's new yacht and end up shipwrecked on an island.  And island ruled by an illusion master prince, who happens to be looking for a bride, and is collecting young girls in order to make a good selection.
Suffice it to say a battle royal follows post haste when most of the girls are stolen from Ranma and the gang, and the movie winds down with Ranma making a HUGE sacrafice for Akane, along with demonstrating new techniques for both Ranma and Ryouga.
Over all if you like Anime you will like this DVD.  If you like Ranma 1/2, you will love this DVD.",1006560000,4,1104,4.247619047619048
581044,5,6303158277,"As a practicing hardcore Ranma  fan (check out my site in my learn more about me page) I found this DVD highly enjoyable! I LOVED the animation, abseloutely amazing animation! The 1st class animation was my favourite part! AMAZING !!! Did i mention the animation was really good? Anyways, down to business, about the movie! It was very very funny, the usual hillarious comedy that Ranma  is so famous for! Pretty much all the characters in the story! Lots and lots of action, AMAZING affects! The guys were using their special attacks quite a bit, that was really cool! People getting on each other's nerves breaking into arguements asusual, especially Ryoga and Ukyo, that arguement was settled in a cute way! Sometimes in movies based on series, the personality and characteristics change slightly different, but thats not the case with this! The characters acted as you'd hoped  and not make you think 'they're so stupid!' A little nudity at the beginning, and very 'dodgy' clothing throughout, worn by the girls! So, watch with discretion! I mean, in the series, all the girls were really decent and comparing it to the clothes worn in the movie was quite a difference! But, that's not a major drawback! The song at the end, A piece of love, was really nice! One of my favourite songs! About the DVD, EXCELLENT animation, very good sound quality! The extras, well we have character profile, explains curses and professions and personalities. That was fun to go through! They have actual sketches by Rumiko Takahashi, it was fun to look at! The love triangle, or as i'd call it, the love pentagon! That part was really cool, they had a short clip of each character's realationships with each other like Mousse totally inlove with Shampoo and Shampoo really bugged at Mousse for not leaving her alone! You get the picture! They had many more extras! Also a section all about VIZ products and you can watch Ranma  trailers of the first movie; Big Trouble in Nekonolon China! And the OAV trailer and the trailer for the TV series. Also, many trailers from other anime! That's all i can think of to comments about at the moment! Later!",997747200,8,2134,4.775067750677507
581045,4,6303158277,"Plot: On a beach vacation, all the girls get abducted. (The guys stop fighting each other and team up for a change) How will Ranma, Ryoga and Mousse save them?
Good points: Story has a better flow than the first movie, and the animation is as excellent. I especially liked the hints as to who will end up marrying each other; nice touch. Preserving Akane requires a special sacrifice from Ranma. Will he be willing?  Does he really, ummmm, Love her?
Bad point: The cute innocence of the series is lost with a bit too much skin. One might conclude that the REAL plot centers on who is the ultimate babe -- Nabiki or Ukyo? Both are animated as fabulous babes, wearing revealing bikinis, but where's the humor? (The series has Shampoo providing humorous contrast to Ranma's repeated complaints about Akane. Shampoo can cook, fight, is madly in love with Ranma and also happens to be THE ultimate babe. It's enough to make guys sigh ""Ranma, don't be such an idiot!"")
Overall: It's an enjoyable movie, but don't be surprised if females get disgusted from the slow pans of the jiggling Nabiki and quivering Ukyo. On the other hand, otaku guys into this stuff will think this is the best ever. Ranma 1/2 collectors will want to get this, but might think about getting the OVA Series first. People new to Ranma 1/2 wanting the ultimate Rumiko Takahashi viewing experience should start with the TV series.",989280000,2,1396,4.67479674796748
581046,5,6303158277,"Anyone who even REMOTELY likes Ranma 1/2 MUST have this Movie. It all begins with Ranma, Akane, Ryoga, Ukyo, Mousse, Shampoo, Soun, Genma, Kuno, Nabiki, Kasumi, Happosai, and Cologne (am i leaving anyone out?) all getting shipwrecked on an island. The real trouble begins with the girls dissapearing without a word, and its up to the men to investigate and get them back.
The middle aera gets a little slow, but speeds up quickly once the fighting begins. The most touching point, however, is when Mousse goes to the extreme to rescue Shampoo from Toristan, a bird-like man. It's a small part of the movie, but by far the best.
The odd point, however, is how they toned down the ability of the women of the show to fight. Its understandable with Ukyo, for she doesn't have her spatula for this adventure, and Nabiki is just about the only girl able to take care for herself (if you have Kuno as the closest thing to a boyfriend, you need to be able to take care of yourself)
Although it's suggested that you watch or read some Ranma 1/2 first, I've used this movie to get several people who never even heard of Ranma 1/2, much less anime, and turned them into hardcore Ranma 1/2 maniacs.",987465600,,1187,4.525581395348837
581047,3,6303158277,"Even though I am a HUGE fan of the Ranma 1/2 series I just wished that this movie was a little better than this. Sure Rumiko Takahshi did not write it which is a reason why but for a 60 min movie I feel that some things could have been added or taken away to make me not thinking that I am watching the 1st movie again(You know like the whole ""take Akane save Akane"" thing). I love the clarity, sound and features that I love in all DVD.",986083200,,437,3.9213483146067416
581048,5,6303158277,"Though I haven't been able to watch much Ranma, what I have has made me extremely happy.  This Anime has it all; action, romance, comedy, and occasional drama.  All the characters are loveable, especially our aqua-transsexual Ranma himself (or is it herself?)
Nihao my concubine stays true to the spirit of the Anime series, while being a work of art in it's own right.  The holiday setting adds a wonderful feel to the movie, and you get into it straight away.
It's basically the story of Big Trouble in Nekonron, China again, with Akane getting kidnapped and Ranma going out to rescue her with the 'help' of his assorted rivals.  However, this time around the plot is tighter, and the relationships between the characters and their feelings towards one another are more deeply explored.
There are quite a few touching scenes in this movie, my personal favourite is when Mousse...well, I can't give that away!  Let's just say that if you ever thought Mousse and Shampoo should be together, you'll like this part!
All in all, this is a wonderful addition to the Ranma 1/2 universe; the only complaint I have against it was that it was too short!  If you like Ranma at all, check this out!",981763200,,1188,4.6875

581050,5,6303158277,"For Anime fans, DVD is a godsend. Purity and snobbery demands that you get subtitled imports and pay a high premium for a scarce collection of titles. Noninitiates prefer them dubbed, and get them cheaper and more readily available. Sometimes even the snobs have to make do with dubs, often poor dubs at that. Now along comes this fine edition of Ranma 1/2's second movie to make the future look bright.
Watch it in Japanese with English subtitles, English with Japanese subitles, English with English subtitles, Japanese with Japanese subtitles. Watch half of it dubbed, watch the other half subtitled, whatever blows your skirt up. Open-minded fellow that I am, I watched both modes. The dub is actually top-notch, and allowed me to focus on the action. The subtitles provided a more accurate translation of the dialog, a clearer understanding of what was going on.
So the DVD rocks. How's the movie? The first Ranma 1/2 movie was little more than a series of crazy set-pieces, manic and disconnected. This film slows things down enough to focus more on the characters, while still maintaining the series' high-energy fun.
I'll spare you another plot rehash -- check the Amazon review for that.  Suffice to say that the movie gives fans what they want.  Akane and Ranma have many great love-hate moments, Mousse shows some backbone, and even Ryoga makes himself useful. Nabiki shines in several scenes as she starts to enjoy being a love-goddess abductee. The new characters are memorable as well; the villain is a remarkably sympathetic boy whose tender scenes with Akane steal the show. The animation is not Disney quality, but it is smooth and stylish (particularly in the climactic shadowy battle scenes).
It's got action, it's got eye candy, it's got some underlying complexity but nothing that gets in the way of the fun. Definitely a must for fans of the series, and a good jumping-on point (with some backstory) for anyone anime-inclined.",974851200,12,1948,4.97239263803681
