I immediately ditched my ""white collar job"" and traded it in for a ""Kentucky Waterfall"" complete with stonewashed torn jeans and a neck beard. I can barely walk from my trailer to the local Wal*Mart without being ravaged by women. I met my new wife thanks to ""American Mullet"". I was walking home from the local Circle K with my beer when I saw her checkin out my goods. I said, ""Hey baby, how bout we go inside and see where this 6 pack takes us""

The rest is history. Thank you American Mullet. You gave me a new lease on life, and encouraged me to start my dream job. I'm now the CEO of my own moonshine distillery and a roadie for Bon Bovi during the off season.",1402963200,,752,4.1506849315068495

Not trailer park dwelling ppl whose family tree is a wreath. 99% of them are though. this is the 1%",1365206400,,215,4.142857142857143

Some might laugh at the simple commentary (I didn't), or feel a twinge of nostalgia if they mulletized themselves back in the 70s or early 80s. But that's about the only entertainment you're going to get from American Mullet.

Never having wore this style myself, I can't relate very well to the film. I had bushy hair, but never the short-long version. So the nagging ""Why?"" question kept tugging at me. Why am I watching this? What purpose does it serve? Are there really that many Harley-riding, lesbian, faux country-western singers out there?

Maybe I'm completely unaware of this niche group.

The documentary-makers traveled around the Western U.S., finding those poor lost souls who still think the mullet is cool, or is a statement of individuality (something I wished they'd covered in more depth). One Harley Davidson riding tough-guy commented on how he doesn't care what others think of his hair, he wears the style because it represents him as a person -- showing people what's on the inside by wearing the mullet on the outside. I thought this was the most insightful commentary in the entire film (especially with the Jennifer Aniston look-alikes that currently decorate a huge portion of American women's heads). But this information is touched on for only a minute and then quickly brushed aside as we move from mullet-wearer to mullet-wearer and hear a bunch of rubbish that makes the entire documentary feel scatterbrained.

The biggest blessing about American Mullet is that it's only 52 minutes long. I don't say this in an antagonistic fashion, either. It's actually somewhat of a compliment. The film-makers didn't stretch this rather static topic out into a two hour presentation. I'll give them credit for that, but that's about it.

(My advice to those who still wear this hairstyle? It's okay if you want to be ""an individual"". It's okay if you want to be retro. But is this style what you really want? It's horrible! Get a haircut!)",1154563200,,2148,4.919889502762431
7986847,5,B00008RV2H,"I went into this thinking I'd have a lot of laughs looking at people with funny hair.  I did, all the way through, but my sense of humor went through a transition from laughing at the subjects of the film, to laughing at how we as a society (me included) put so much meaning into a person's appearance.  Why are we so touchy about how others look, especially when it comes to what we consider to be the extreme in bad taste?  I still think mullets look ugly on most people (there were a few people who actually wore that look very well!).  But there is a deeper ugliness in those who chose to look down on others that they consider tacky or silly.  Perhaps the mullet is one of the last bastions of American individualism.  It's what makes our culture so diverse and interesting.  This film is a wonderful celebration of that!",1077235200,11,826,4.359477124183006
