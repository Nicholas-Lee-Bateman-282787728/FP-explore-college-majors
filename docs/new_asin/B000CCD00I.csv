I was thrilled to find these on DVD! They came in the mail within a day or two after ordering and they are everything I'd hoped they would be. I recommend these to anyone with children. They are timeless, clever, and entertaining. The sellers should also be trusted with prompt service and quality products.",1208995200,3,449,4.625
