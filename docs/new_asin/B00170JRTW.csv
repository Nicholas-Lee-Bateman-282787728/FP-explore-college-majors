3166263,4,B00170JRTW,"This is a wonderful ""bittersweet dramedy"" rendered in twelve half-hour episodes.

JOANNA LUMLEY's PERFORMANCE

I had never seen Joanna Lumley in a leading role (no, I never did get around to watching ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS) and was deeply impressed by her work in Sensitive Skin. Here, as a 62-year old woman struggling with an unfulfilling marriage, her out-to-lunch adult son, her bitter sister, and life and death in general, she is oh-so-heartbreakingly good: pensive, quietly intelligent, quietly glamorous, quietly tragic, even, in her way. Her wit is dry but never cutting or sarcastic; you sense she is a more-than-decent person, possibly even a kind one. And she seems to have an air of bittersweet humor about her at all times, as though people's most outrageous, offensive, or hurtful behavior amuses her. But she telegraphs her amusement in a way that makes it seem she is not only smiling over their absurdities, but laughing at herself, too. What I loved best about her was her air of vulnerability.

Her face can be described as a ""magnificent ruin"": conventionally, model-worthy beautiful, but also slightly craggy with the years, with regret, and with a subdued sort of pain she keeps close to her chest. She is elegantly but heavily made up with dark lip rouge and black eye pencil and softly glowing blush, almost as though the rituals of beauty help ease this unnamed, muted pain she carries around with her at all times.

DISC 1 (SERIES 1)

There is a marked difference between the two discs. The first disc, series 1, is more like a series of vignettes that are loosely related due to the recurring characters and themes. The general vignette subjects include: managing to live with a neurotic long-time spouse who hasn't emotionally resonated with you for years; dealing with an envious sister and her boorish husband; wondering whether you've really ""made something"" of your life after all; trying to fill the inexplicable holes in your heart with posh flats and Vidal Sassoon haircuts and always coming up short; and being alarmingly pursued by a variety of inappropriate men.

The first few episodes did not really hold my attention all that well, because the writers just drop us into said vignettes and show us a series of characters we don't know who display neurotic, selfish, bizarre, or embarassing behavior. Sometimes I felt my attention wander.

I felt, oddly enough, that there was a whif of CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM about this series. Now, please know that they are vastly different shows with *completely* different approaches and senses of humor. CURB is broad, laugh-out-loud, outrageous comedy rendered in colorful splashes; SKIN is utterly subdued, autumnal, bitterish-sweet ""dramedy"" that mixes sharp, cutting humor with sometimes heart-wrenching reflections on life and death. But, they are similar in that in both series, the main characters encounter increasingly absurd people who make the main characters, dysfunctional as they themselves might be, seem almost sane in relation to the rest of the world.

I guarantee that even if you weren't that engaged by the first few episodes, the last episode of this 6-part disc will hook you expertly and reel you in. After that, the show really picks up steam.

DISC 2 (Series 2)

The second disc/series is much more like a traditional serial, with plots and subplots that run throughout all 6 episodes. It is also much more emotionally compelling than the first disc. There are some shocking plot twists throughout, all the way to the last episode. That's about all I can say without giving away spoilers, but I hope you stick with the series until the end.

OTHER IMPRESSIONS

I was so disappointed when I realized BBC had not made any more episodes after these twelve. There are so many characters I wanted to know more about, storylines I wanted to explore in greater depth. I believe HB0 will be producing a re-make of this series starring Kim Cattrell in the Lumley role, but I urge you to see the original version first because I highly doubt the same ""autumnal"" tone will translate into the American version.

The overall impression of the teleplay, humor, acting, camera work and color palette is indeed one of autumn--the autumns of people's lifespans, but also autumn as a represenation of emotional bruising and bottled up-pain.  The somber selections of classical, folk, and pop music combine to create an almost constant elegiac tone; even at the conclusion of the funniest or most amusing scenes, the music reminds us that life is always embroidered with pain, one side lined with humor but the other inevitably lined with suffering.

Denis Lawson is excellent as Lumley's husband; this Scottish actor (Ewan MacGregor's uncle) is highly underrated and I always long to see him on screen more. Pitch-perfect guest stars include luminaries such as Frances De La Tour and Jean Marsh (in a devastating role).

RECOMMENDATION

If you are looking for sharp humor but not for outright comedy; if you don't mind a good dose of the bitter with your sweet (I don't really even think there is a ""sweet"" here); and if you don't mind not quite knowing ""what ultimately happens"" to the characters you've grown to be invested in, this series will really speak to you. Be prepared to sit and brood a little bit and perhaps even shed a tear throughout.",1265068800,14,5664,4.9390115667718195
3166264,5,B00170JRTW,"I bought this dvd series because I so enjoyed Joanna Lumley in AbFab and wanted to see more of her work.  Two things struck me about this BBC series:  First, this is a realistic telling of what it is like to be in your 60's today.  We were ""the me generation,"" it is hard to believe we are in our 60's now--we were important, we set the rules, we partied and we thought we'd go on forever.  We still think of ourselves that way.  Being 60 today is not like when my Grandmother turned 60.  We still drive sports cars, bikes, hike, party, drink, some do drugs, and have sex.  Seeing flirting and sexual appetites still strong in people in their 60's is common today--just you wait!  The Second thing, I felt was that I really knew these people.  Joanna's character's discussions with her halucinatory visitors is typical of someone who is trying to come to terms with getting older.  How does it affect me, and how should it affect me?  What are the boundaries?  How should I be living my life now and how should I represent that.  It's totally weird to realize that if you are still waiting for things to happen to you, you have missed most of your life!  Mr. Blick, who is writer, director and producer has done an incredible job.  He is either 60 or he understands that generation extremely well.  This is a wonderful series.  The actors are first rate, Joanna Lumley is terrific.  When you remember Patsy from AbFab, and see Ms. Lumley in this, you realize what a good actor she is. If you are a fan of hers, grab it.",1256342400,50,1519,4.364285714285714

It takes a bit a patience to get through the first series.  It's pretty glum, but you have time to get introduced to everyone.  The second series is great.  There's a lot more characters who come in and out that add a humorous tone.",1228262400,12,361,4.173913043478261
3166267,5,B00170JRTW,"Bought this set simply because of Joanna Lumley, who in my mind is the greatest comedic talent since Lucille Ball, yet she is more frequently dramatic, of late.  This British import of her recent BBC series that ran for 2 years is more drama than comedy, and, as ever, she's watchable and fantastic.
Beyond her indelible Patsy Stone in 'Absolutely Fabulous', my personal favorite work of hers was 'Class Act' because of the exceptional supporting cast she worked with, and it was funny.  There aren't many laughs in 'Sensitive Skin', in fact, its sort of foreboding- it makes turning 60 and being in your 60s seem very frightening, but in the next 20 years i hope to get over it.
One minor flaw is that EVERY male character in 'Sensitive Skin', in nearly every episode, is in complete awe of Joanna, invariably all falling madly in love with her- i get it, she's irresistable, i've purchased from Amazon everything her name is linked to, but the point does seem overstated. We, the audience, can love and admire her, uh, lovelieness, but it seems, well, yes, overstated.
It is fascinating melodrama, she has a husband, splits with husband, husband dies, meets a long line of suitors, then winds up in the final episode with what seems to be a reincarnation of the dead husband.  The British locales seem bleak, dreary and yet invigorating, somehow, for Joanna to sludge through all of her miseries.
 I  would love to see Ms. Lumley in a first rate theatrical release, win an Oscar to get the dramatic juices extracted from her, and then return to comedy.  How many actresses are truly, with genious, hilarious?  Ms. Lumley is amongst a scant few who have the gift of comedic brilliance that trancends cultures, age, race, gender.  So, let her be done with dull miscast sons, dead husbands, or husky sobbing with a long face squeezing out a tear with a snivel as seen in 'Sensitive Skin'.
 Funniest actress ever.  Versatile yes, it has been proved.  Now, please be hilarious again.  Nobody else is.",1227312000,10,1997,4.7398843930635834

3166269,5,B00170JRTW,"Joanna Lumley is, as always, brilliant, and there is real chemistry between her and the wonderful Denis Lawson.  The script is, in my opinion, rich and very well-written, bubbling with both sadness and humour, and showing great insight into what it means to become aware of time running out.  The main characters are so strongly drawn that they stay with you long after you've finished watching.  As a bonus, you get to view London and listen to a great selection of music.  Series 2 is a bit more of a mixed bag and there were some bits that felt a little contrived or consciously quirky, but I still enjoyed it very much.

When I heard a remake of Sensitive Skin was being made in US/Canada I had to check out the original. I loved it!
It is elegant and beautifully photographed. I think it catches the feeling many long time married couples have as they search for meaning in their 60's. So many of us can see ourselves in these characters.

3166281,4,B00170JRTW,"The story in the beginning series is somewhat comedic and dialog is very good. The dynamic between characters is funny, if not curious, somewhat contrived and to some extent non-believable, especially the son. The second series really leaves too much to the imagination however.  Disappeared is the husband, Denis Lawson, a victim of grief and heart failure, both of which are only implied until late in the second serious.  The main character, played by Joanna Lumley is both tragic and provocative.  Jean Marsh's role kinda left a poor impression of a character that was incomplete and wanting of better writing. The son goes through a metamorphosis which entangles the plot and is somewhat confused with gimmickry.  In the end, the happiness is achieved and our protagonist is rewarded for her perseverance.",1329091200,,810,5.1603053435114505

3166285,5,B00170JRTW,"Joanna Lumley shows off her substantial acting chops in this series.  It's a poignant and hilarious look at aging in the twenty-first century.  All the performances are wonderful, but Lumley stands out.  Everyone knows she can do slapstick and outrageous comedy, but she's equally adept at drama.  The quiet moments in Sensitive Skin, where all her longings and regrets and bafflement at growing older are etched on her face are profoundly moving.

The writing is lovely as well though, personally, I found the magic realism/surrealism (imaginary friends, frustration personified, etc...) to be the weakest link -- and I'm a big Dennis Potter fan.  The series is at its best when it sticks with the Here & Now and, thankfully, that's where it lives most of the time.  And, thank goodness for British television, which isn't obsessed with youth and the 18-49 year old demographic.  Wish the Yanks would follow that lead.

3166286,5,B00170JRTW,"Sooner of later everyone is going to have to turn 60. Joanna Lumley, seemed destined to never grow up in Ad Fab. She begins this series with a brilliant one liner about hormone therapy reminiscent of the narcissistic lush she once played, but Sensitive Skin is different. It is as real as the problems of growing older. The series takes on all the uncertainty, mortality and regret that comes with age. It does so with black humor lingering looks and pregnant pauses that allow us to fill in the blanks without slowing the pace. Often what is not said is what makes this all too short series such a gem.

You won't find many belly laughs here because the humor is filled with an irony that is visceral. So much of life just doesn't seem to work as it once did for her. We watch as her choices narrow and defeats that would have been brushed side in youth become defining and perhaps insurmountable. We accompany her through the loss of love and the death of friends who can't make the required transitions. In the end, we ""settle in"" with her as she comes to fully know herself and forge a new life based perhaps on better choices. We are left with a message of hope that life and love go on, proving that 60 is not too late to start over.",1276992000,10,1239,4.3405172413793105

3400766,5,B00170JRTW,"Joanna Lumley is, as always, brilliant, and there is real chemistry between her and the wonderful Denis Lawson.  The script is, in my opinion, rich and very well-written, bubbling with both sadness and humour, and showing great insight into what it means to become aware of time running out.  The main characters are so strongly drawn that they stay with you long after you've finished watching.  As a bonus, you get to view London and listen to a great selection of music.  Series 2 is a bit more of a mixed bag and there were some bits that felt a little contrived or consciously quirky, but I still enjoyed it very much.

When I heard a remake of Sensitive Skin was being made in US/Canada I had to check out the original. I loved it!
It is elegant and beautifully photographed. I think it catches the feeling many long time married couples have as they search for meaning in their 60's. So many of us can see ourselves in these characters.

3400778,4,B00170JRTW,"The story in the beginning series is somewhat comedic and dialog is very good. The dynamic between characters is funny, if not curious, somewhat contrived and to some extent non-believable, especially the son. The second series really leaves too much to the imagination however.  Disappeared is the husband, Denis Lawson, a victim of grief and heart failure, both of which are only implied until late in the second serious.  The main character, played by Joanna Lumley is both tragic and provocative.  Jean Marsh's role kinda left a poor impression of a character that was incomplete and wanting of better writing. The son goes through a metamorphosis which entangles the plot and is somewhat confused with gimmickry.  In the end, the happiness is achieved and our protagonist is rewarded for her perseverance.",1329091200,,810,5.1603053435114505

3400782,5,B00170JRTW,"Joanna Lumley shows off her substantial acting chops in this series.  It's a poignant and hilarious look at aging in the twenty-first century.  All the performances are wonderful, but Lumley stands out.  Everyone knows she can do slapstick and outrageous comedy, but she's equally adept at drama.  The quiet moments in Sensitive Skin, where all her longings and regrets and bafflement at growing older are etched on her face are profoundly moving.

The writing is lovely as well though, personally, I found the magic realism/surrealism (imaginary friends, frustration personified, etc...) to be the weakest link -- and I'm a big Dennis Potter fan.  The series is at its best when it sticks with the Here & Now and, thankfully, that's where it lives most of the time.  And, thank goodness for British television, which isn't obsessed with youth and the 18-49 year old demographic.  Wish the Yanks would follow that lead.  Would love to see another series!!",1287532800,2,955,5.031847133757962
3400783,5,B00170JRTW,"Sooner of later everyone is going to have to turn 60. Joanna Lumley, seemed destined to never grow up in Ad Fab. She begins this series with a brilliant one liner about hormone therapy reminiscent of the narcissistic lush she once played, but Sensitive Skin is different. It is as real as the problems of growing older. The series takes on all the uncertainty, mortality and regret that comes with age. It does so with black humor lingering looks and pregnant pauses that allow us to fill in the blanks without slowing the pace. Often what is not said is what makes this all too short series such a gem.

You won't find many belly laughs here because the humor is filled with an irony that is visceral. So much of life just doesn't seem to work as it once did for her. We watch as her choices narrow and defeats that would have been brushed side in youth become defining and perhaps insurmountable. We accompany her through the loss of love and the death of friends who can't make the required transitions. In the end, we ""settle in"" with her as she comes to fully know herself and forge a new life based perhaps on better choices. We are left with a message of hope that life and love go on, proving that 60 is not too late to start over.",1276992000,10,1239,4.3405172413793105

8264493,5,B00170JRTW,"I am a man of a certain age; someone who has spent most of his adult life as a writer.
That said, I can honestly admit that I never really appreciated all the nuances of the word ""bittersweet"" until I watched both seasons of ""Sensitive Skin."" Joanna Lumley (I'm old enough to remember when one of her first roles was in ""The New Avengers"") and Denis Lawson play a couple in their 60s that has grown so comfortable with one another that they no longer feel the thrill of being married. Lumley's character was once the belle of the ball and is trying desperately to hold onto her looks and figure. Lawson plays a columnist who seems to get angrier by the day. A hypochondriac whose constant visits to the doctor cost a fortune, he loves his wife but doesn't really appear to be ""in love"" with her any more. He spends his time ranting rather than wooing. She, meanwhile, continues to wonder if maybe, just maybe, she could have done better both in her marriage and her career.
I'm not going to delve deeply into the plot of either season because I think doing so would be a disservice to those that have not yet seen this truly well done series. Instead, I'll say that the writing captures the joy, the humor, the angst, and the fear that we all face once we realize that - no matter what we may have thought in the past about being invincible - we're getting older and slower and more weathered each and every day. We can try to hold back the tide of aging by a variety of means but, ultimately, we cannot do so. Some people accept that fact and go on to enjoy the time they have left while, for others, that realization can truly be a catalyst for bad decisions.
I'll also mention here the fact that the music which accompanies the episodes in this series is well chosen and adds, I think, a great deal to the storytelling. Old pop tunes and classical music help to heighten the mood of the most important scenes.
In addition, I'd like to pay tribute to the directors who kept each episode moving along at a nice, easy pace. Not too fast, not too slow; the pace is just fast enough to allow us to remain engaged but not so fast that we miss the wonderfully nuanced performances of Lumley, Lawson and the rest of the cast.
I should add here that I don't think everyone will like this series because, in truth, the storylines can be occasionally uncomfortable. Additionally, the series constantly reminds those of us of a certain age that we are no longer who - or what - we once were back in the days when the future seemed endless.
For those that are not afraid to face the fact we are getting older, however, I think you'll find this a truly marvelous series.
