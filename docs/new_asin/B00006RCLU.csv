7972546,1,B00006RCLU,"My 1 star rating here is not related to Abbott and Costello.  As far as I'm concerned, almost everything they produced was worthy of 5 stars.
THIS IS A DUPLICATE of a DVD that I have now purchased no less than 3 TIMES!
One of the disadvantages of selling something online is that you can't always determine what you are buying.  Unfortunately, this Amazon part number didn't have any description or picture of the packaging, so I took a chance it was something new.
This title should read ""The Abbott and Costello Show"".  It's the same green DVD package from GoodTimes DVD that is sold under two other configurations.
Before you order, confirm that you don't already have this UPC/ISBN.
This particular title is:

It's a live 1954 episode of The Colgate Comedy Hour, with guests Jane Russell, Rhonda Fleming, Connie Haines and Beryl Davis.
""Too broke to pay their rooming house bill in the fictional Latin country of Bolamania, Bud and Lou rehearse a magic trick in the hope of landing a nightclub gig before Lou hits on the idea of impersonating El Presidente.  The boys dissolve into laughter and ubscripted ad libs, poke affectionate fun at Liberace and You Bet Your Life and recreate various classic routines, while the lovely ladies perform a medley of musical numbers.  Complete with original ads for Colgate Dental Cream. Palmolive Soap, Ajax Cleanser, Fab Detergent and Halo Shampoo, the show also stars Baby Mistin, Nester Paiva (Tarantula), Benny Rubin and Jim Hayward.""",1073952000,12,1518,4.891050583657588
