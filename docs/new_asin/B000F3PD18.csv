8116868,4,B000F3PD18,"There were a total of 17 had drawn Superman cartoons made for the Fleischer and Famous studios, all are now in the public domain, this collection has an assortment of 9 of them plus 6 others, three of them ""Noveltoons"", the oddest of the bunch is an Italian cartoon called ""Mr Rossi On The Beach"" (this even retained the original Italian credit sequence)
One thing that I really like is all the films contained in this collection have the original studio logos in the beginning, some public domain cartoons remove them, but they remain intact here!
The back says it runs 75 min, but the whole collection runs 118 min.
I found this for one penny on clearence at a discount store where I live so I said, seem like a good deal to me!
This is a Digiview release and the quiality is actually pretty good for these old cartoons, there is the usual suspects, frame jumps, image wobble, scratches, but after all this is film.
Of course there are better quality collections that include ALL 17 Superman cartoons, VCI's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-The-Ultimate-Max-Fleischer-Cartoon-Collection/dp/B000F9RL9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman - The Ultimate Max Fleischer Cartoon Collection</a>, which I also own and will be reviewing soon.",1344729600,2,1287,5.44
