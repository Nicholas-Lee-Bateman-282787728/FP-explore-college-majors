2616608,4,B000GRU8UY,"I like the collection of asanas. a different style of presentation than what we are used to here in the US. However, this is Yoga in its unadulterated form, as designed by the creator, yogi patanjali. These days yoga teachers present ""hacks"" of the original form!! glad some teachers are still preserving the native form! thanks for providing it on amazon prime",1414972800,2,361,4.838709677419355
2616609,5,B000GRU8UY,"The presentation is a little on the boring side, but I gave it 5 stars because medical & health benefits are given for each asana. Cautions are also given",1396396800,2,154,4.344827586206897

2616611,1,B000GRU8UY,This was not my idea of a training video. Watching this guy do poses was like watching paint peel. Poor quality.,1389916800,3,112,4.380952380952381
2616612,5,B000GRU8UY,"I have something (from 2005) from netflix that sounds a lot like this dvd.  (Now that I read the review, it IS this dvd).
 Actually, it is GREAT for those of us who really
want to see a pose - THE ASANAS-  demonstrated and perhaps follow along.  I did not find this ""condescending "" or ""snobbish"" at all.- as the ""two star reviewer"" alleges.

So many yoga classes - in studios- good studios- as well as very good private fitness centers go with the same old same old - warm ups, some vinyasa , a few standing poses, a balance pose, a couple twists, and then into savasana- it is REFRESHING to see the actual variety of poses here , along with their Sanskrit names, SLOWLY DEMONSTRATED AND NARRATED.  Pretty much NOBODY is
going to measure up to this little elite and cliqueish band of yoga celebrities- Yee, Rae, Corn- who I find so tiresome anyway-
yet this DVD shows ACTUAL NORMAL PEOPLE , in modest clothing (!) who are nevertheless incredibly able , posture perfect, and
flexible- they actually have normal fit bodies instead of something that looks like extreme bodybuilding was involved.

Hatha yoga was meant to come to us primarily through the poses, and this dvd does a fine job of doing just that.  This is also an excellent resource for teachers who sincerely wish to help their students and clients learn poses without having to swan about in front of a room all the time.",1378080000,,1384,4.530120481927711
2616613,2,B000GRU8UY,"Play:
First is the credits, then the menu. Menu is split into Manu A - c each contain 12-13 asanas/yoga poses. You cannot play it all, you must play each one separately which means going back to the menu after each pose is demonstrated. Each one is 2-4 min long. Only the Sanskrit name is given on the menu & pronounced during the demonstration, never the English name.
All poses are ones on most beginner yoga workouts such as mountain, fish, warrior 1, 2 sitting spinal twists, locust, sitting fwd bends, standing back bend, pyramid, modified boat, bow, triangle, side angle, twisted triangle, hero, child's, camel, shoulder stand, wide angle standing fwd bend, single sitting wide angle fwd bend, etc..
The camera/lighting/sound are find, not high money, but better then average set inside a room. The voice over by I assume Dr. Sujatha reminds me of old 1970s/1980s PBS lecture programs. Slow, perfect, over pronunciation of all words to a boring degree that sounds condescending as if read at a snobbish high class lecture/gathering. It's set at a small room/stage inside taht is very basic. One Indian man & woman in regular cotton shirt/pants demonstrate the poses 1 at a time most times. This is not set to look beautiful as some yoga workouts do but basic. They do the poses well, but not inspiring like Shiva Rae, Rodney Yee, Rainbeau Mars, Sean Corn, etc. They demonstrate the pose in/out of it quickly, then you are told how to do it with the video paused in certain spots sometimes. They show it quickly on both sides. After it is demonstrated, the benefits are told as well as the words are on the screen are displayed to inform how it helps the physical body such as how it helps to lose weight, tone which muscles, tone which organs or glands & how helps to energize or relax the mind/spirit. Contraindications are also displayed/told such as if you have sciatica, high blood pressure, gland issues, back pain, etc. not to do that particular pose.

I love being informed of all the benefits/contraindications, but becasue it was delivered in such a dry tone, I could not watch it. The only poses are beginner & since I've been doing yoga dvds for 5 years now I already know them. What is instructed is the same as any workout yoga dvd for beginners. Rare is there a quick history for barely a min about what chakras are, some quick thing about Indian myth that barely made any sense what it has to do with that particular pose.
I give this 2 stars only because some people can use this as reference & may like the dry tone & it IS informative. But as the other reviewer said, since it's laid out like a book & barely more informative that a workout, it doesn't serve better then either one.",1208044800,,2706,4.60248447204969
2616614,2,B000GRU8UY,"This video is not worth the time or money.  Buy a book with more information. It is a poor quality video. The students demonstrate the poses and the teacher talkes you through them.  You will get more information and poses from a book, for less.  If you hate books, this is the video for you.  There is no yoga routine, just a demonstration of each pose.",1191110400,,354,4.318181818181818
8134146,5,B000GRU8UY,I like this video very much aside from the introduction largo--it's very good for showing appropriate alignment of the body and breath while doing them--and that is key in getting most benefits without doing harm to your body--for you are actually also working with subtle /meridian channels and the chakras not just the physical body(I have had 3 years of martial art also tai chi)--I also liked that it noted  the Sanskrit names of asana's and potential benefits and cautions --most usually just when you think you know it all....you find you really don't--especially when you reflect back on yourself--and much to be learned from what would seem the simplest thing--can have many applications!,1493683200,,696,5.105263157894737

8134148,5,B000GRU8UY,"These asanas are perfect for me, challenging but not impossible. Yoga originated in India, so I guess I kind of like being instructed by people from India. lol  I also like the information on how certain poses help relieve different ailments.",1456617600,,242,4.902439024390244
8134149,4,B000GRU8UY,Like it.  It's different than the other yoga.,1444176000,,45,4.625

8134151,5,B000GRU8UY,"I'd recommend you watch this for yourself, before giving any credence to the two sarcastic one-star reviews posted here.

This is a GREAT introduction to Yoga for beginners.  Which is ME.  If you're an expert Yogi Master, I can't speak to how much this will mean to YOU.  But if you're interested in learning how to properly strike Yoga poses, this is terrific.

Speaking for myself, I find this an indispensable guide.  No, it doesn't have ""Hollywood"" written all over it.  But if you're interested in Yoga instruction, I doubt you could do any better than this.  Why?

1.  Instructions are clear and demonstrated very well, giving you time to strike a proper pose, without dragging on for an eternity.  Need more time?  Hit the pause button.
2.  Best yet, after each pose and its instruction, you'll learn precisely what health benefits that particular pose offers.  So if, for example, you're wanting to increase blood flow to internal organs OR improve spinal elasticity, it will be very clear just which pose is most advantageous to your area of need.  It truly and clearly helps you understand which poses will help you the most (and which to avoid, if you suffer from any health conditions like high blood pressure, hyperthyrodisim, etc.).  VERY helpful info!
3.  Poses are named in Hindi AND English.  Personally, I like this explanation of the meaning of the name of each pose.

Give it a try before you judge it!  I give it an A+ for clarity and utility!",1432166400,2,1464,4.734126984126984

8134154,4,B000GRU8UY,I like the explanation of why each pose is beneficial and that he m o ves quickly from one pose to next.,1426291200,,104,3.772727272727273
8134155,4,B000GRU8UY,"I don't understand why the genre is labeled as horror, its almost insulting. I like the video because I like learning what all the poses do for me, as I was not educated in Yoga by a Yogi anywhere, ever.  It is a practice my friends encouraged me to try because of my physical ailments. Yes, it is most different but that doesn't mean its horrible. I enjoy documentaries of some very boring materiel so maybe that is why this isn't the worst film ever made. It is definitely can be a challenge to ""watch"" so I close my eyes, but I get posture in the pose and its purpose for my body and how long I should hold it which I am glad the poses are not held for upwards of 10-15 mins for some of them.",1422748800,,695,4.036231884057971
