8302888,1,B001FVLWZ0,"saw this series all the way up thru episode 28
then i had to stop as i was totally bored
problem is with the script, lots of digressions unrelated to the main plot
the only redeeming quality is the costume
this 60 plus episode series could be presented much better in 20 episode max....
major disappointment....",1291334400,,311,4.571428571428571
8302889,2,B001FVLWZ0,"I've watched dozens of Korean TV series dramas. Many were historical dramas. This was perhaps the least inspiring I've seen.

The script was ho-hum. Basically, it centered about a clueless dummy who castrated himself to become a eunuch, so he could be near the woman he loved, while nominally serving the king, who made that woman his queen. He constantly exasperated people in the story, as well as viewers, acting like he knew what was up, but really didn't. Try rooting for him to come through, then time and time again he gives one more reason to assume he is hopelessly stupid.

The scriptwriter was also very wasteful when it came to utilizing his characters. Often, when you expected something really unique to happen, you're disappointed with two-dimensional story developments.

The high point I would say was the proficient acting skills of Jun Kwang Ryul, who played the head eunuch and sage adviser to the kings.

Han Jung Soo provided great supporting acting to augment Jun Kwang Ryul's role. And Jun Hye Bin was fascinating as the always-scheming femme fatale.

Oh Man Suk in the main role was so predictable as to be boring. And Koo Hye Sun, as the love of his life who became a queen, was often irritatingly repetitious. I fault more so the lackluster script they had to follow. But she was much better in ""Mighty Chilwu"" and ""Boys Over Flowers."" Both characters seemed to be retarded, having severe learning problems, time and time again failing to learn anything from their mistakes.

Before buying this Korean TV series, I would strongly suggest buying something else... unless, like me, you've already seen just about every other Korean historical drama, and want to watch it simply because, like the man who told people who asked him why he must climb a mountain, ""Because it's there.""

8302890,3,B001FVLWZ0,"This show is on par with ""Jewel of the Palace"" on cinematography & acting. But with better editing, it could be shortened to under 40 episodes.  Many scenes are overlong and do not add more to the story.  Many characters are unlikable.  You can feel yourself age while watching this show.",1268092800,,288,4.607843137254902
8302891,4,B001FVLWZ0,"Those who have been enthralled by the Korean costume drama ""Dae Jang Geum""  (quite frankly one of the most stimulating mini-series ever produced), will be delighted with the web of stories arising out of 15th century Korea. Again we see magnificent productions of the feudal court with its intricate political reversals, love triangles, revenge, jealousy, and ambition.

What makes this series different is that it focuses on the Department of Eunochs, particularly one very intelligent yet ruthless head of the Department - Lord Jo - who engineers a ""change of era"" by poisoning the king when the young, ego driven, yet inexperienced monarch threatens to cancel the eunochs' opportunity - as a class - to wed partners or adopt children.

The story follows the intricate political moves of Lord Jo, his adoption of a son, and the attempts to protect the Korean monarchy from corrupt ministers.

While no Korean miniseries is going to rival ""Dae Jang Geum"", I did find this series to be consistently entertaining, better, let's say, than ""Damo"" - another series about feudal Korea.  Go for it.",1234310400,6,1092,5.044444444444444
