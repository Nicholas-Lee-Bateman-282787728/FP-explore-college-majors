8174898,4,6305492964,"Contains live performances of some of Cuba's finest musicians. The Salsa flavor is apparent in every aspect of this slice of Havana, which includes interviews, in-the-studio footage, a virtual tour of the city, and Salsa dance lessons. Showcased artists include Bamboleo, La Barriada, Klimax, Chika Del Son, Angel Bonne, Arte Mixto, and more.
This was a zero cost production DVD. The video & audio do not always match. It was no a worry for me but for some nit pickers they have given bad reviews becouse of this. The video's are good & the music makes me want to dance so I like it.
The Salsa lesson is by an average Rueda dancer. I was not impressed.",1039046400,7,652,4.581196581196581
