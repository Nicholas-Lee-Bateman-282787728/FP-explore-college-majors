3103547,5,B0013D8LHW,"A stunning and remarkable documentary film about the illegal fishing of sharks for the Asian food market that is both riveting and beautiful to watch.  The film documents director Rob Stewart's discovery and determination in letting the public know about the plight of sharks being killed off.  The High Def imagery/cinematography is simply incredible and I'm sure the Bluray disc will look equally impressive as when I saw it on the AFI' Silver Theatre DLP system in March of 2006.  The film is essential in educating all about the misconceptions and slaughter of sharks, it is both enlightening and ultimately heartbreaking - highly recommended!",1204070400,19,647,5.201923076923077

The first time I saw it was at a scuba diving and marine biology summer camp called odyssey expeditions. It shook myself and all my friends up. That was 6 years ago, and I've probably watched this movie 10 more times since then. It's thrilling, upsetting, hopeful, and educational. I showed it to my environmental literature teacher at college, at he then made watching it an extra credit opportunity for my classmates. I've tried to show this movie to as many ocean-lovers as I know, and everyone is impressed by Rob Stewart; as well as shocked and horrified by the shark finning industry. It's truly a must-see.

3103791,2,B0013D8LHW,"This movie missed it's mark. If the goal was to sway the mass audience that sharks are safe and should be protected, this film actually did the opposite. I suspect the majority of people who have viewed the film and left positive reviews are already passionate about shark protection. However, for the mass audience who grew up fearing Jaws and are not already passionate about shark protection, this movie does more damage than good for the cause.

The movie started well with beautiful imagery and an interesting premise that sharks are not the feared man eaters we grew up believing from the Jaws movies. I enjoyed the first 1/3 and was looking forward to being convinced the premise was true. However, the film took a turn from interesting to terrible early on.

*Slight SPOILER ALERT*

The movie turned bad when the director, Rob Stewart, met up with a fanatical animal rights activist, Paul Watson. Prior to this point in the film, Stewart laid the foundation that he was going to prove sharks were not dangerous and that they should be protected. Instead of proving this, the film shifted directions and the final 2/3's of it covered a fanatical, and illegal hunt for people fishing for sharks.

As a lay person to shark conservation, I wanted to believe Stewart's premise, but he lost all credibility with this film. I was neutral toward shark preservation prior to the film, but by the end of the movie I felt somewhat bad for the shark fisherman and found the conservationists fanatical and mentally unstable.

For example, Stewart and Watson, pursue shark fisherman in Costa Rica. Watson's ship appeared to be something similar to a small Navy destroyer or a Coast Guard cutter. They locate a tiny, beat-up fishing boat that was manned by men appearing desperately poor from a third world country and trying to survive. In the movie, Watson and/or Stewart paint a picture of the fisherman as greedy money grubbing corporate Wall Street types. While trying to paint this picture, the video displays a tiny, worn out fishing boat full of third world looking impoverished fisherman being rammed by a giant, expensive ship with a well fed, overweight captain. The message loses all credibility.

After countless attempts to harass the fisherman with a fire-hoses, etc, Watson began ramming the small fishing boat with a giant knife blade attached to his boat. He was actually trying to cut the fishing boat open to sink it on video. Watson brags about sinking other boats in the past. It was disturbing.

Eventually authorities rightfully arrest Stewart and Watson for attempted murder of the fisherman. Although there is some confusion, it appears the fisherman were not violating any laws by fishing for shark.

There were many graphic scenes of sharks being killed, or their fins being cut off live sharks and their live remains dumped at sea. This was eye opening and had a certain impact on us viewing the film, however, that message was lost in Stewart's nativity and Watson's over inflated ego and bully behavior.

Stewart lost further credibility when he interviewed another shark expert throughout the film who claimed how safe sharks are and how they don't attack people. Stewart does not disclose in the movie that this very shark expert was attacked by a shark himself.

I'm disappointed because the movie began so well and had so much potential. Including a fanatical animal right's activist who was willing to break the law and put the life of a shark before a human, was a real turn off to the cause and a sign of immaturity. To make progress with the average person, a more moderate, balanced messages is needed. Attacking people trying to make a living is not the way to inspire change or get the laws about shark hunting changed.

I left the film curious if sharks were as dangerous as most people think. That question was left unanswered with minimal to no evidence one way or the other. I was disturbed by the fining of sharks and the remains being discarded, but I was not convinced or shown ANY evidence that it poses a threat to the Eco system. I left thinking the shark protection activists in the movie were egotistical thrill seekers who would kill a human that was legally fishing for shark. I'm not sure that was the message Stewart was after.",1352332800,5,4278,4.814713896457766
3103792,5,B0013D8LHW,This is an amazing documentary!  After watching this I realized that any one person can make a difference.

3103793,2,B0013D8LHW,"This film has a great message that needs to be told. However, some poor filming techniques really get in the way. The narration is AWFUL! I understand that this young man wanted to tell his own story, but he would have been better off finding someone with a less grating voice. Also, some of the narration is downright corny. This really detracts from the message. The film also uses really corny music while showing sharks being killed.

It shows how money distroys life.  Through Rob's eyes, we see the need to preserve this magical place called the sea and all the beautiful creatures that live in it. This video is very well done and beautiful photography.  It has already put enough pressure on some countries to stop finning sharks.  Good work Rob and keep it up!!",1325894400,,623,4.477876106194691
3103796,5,B0013D8LHW,"One of the best documentaries I have ever seen in my life. This is one of those movies that would appeal to a wide audience, and is incredibly compelling in general.

I was moved by the motivation and message, and wish I could somehow get everyone on earth to watch this movie. It is so important for people to know about what is going on in our oceans. The alarms need to be sounded immediately and people need to stand up and fight before it is too late. It is estimated that over 90% of shark poulations have been eliminated from the World's oceans in the last 10 years due to the finning industry. If you eliminate the apex preditor in the ocean then you get massive imbalances. What happens if there are no sharks to consume dead and rotting whale carcasas in the ocean, or to kill off the sick and dying fish? You end up with a cesspool in the end, rather than a beautiful Ocean.

I think this is the most important issue that very few people in the world are aware of. We know nothing about shark breeding, and know that the gestation period is lengthy, and sharks also reach sexual maturity at a later stage in life. This is all bad stuff when it comes to keeping healthy numbers in our oceans, as the shark finning industry continues to rape and pillage our serene oceans.

Watch this movie and pass it along. Please please raise awareness before it is too late.

3103797,4,B0013D8LHW,"The documentary, ""Sharkwater,"" by filmmaker and naturalist Rob Stewart, has, essentially, a twofold purpose: to rehabilitate the reputation of the shark by countering many of the myths and misconceptions that, over the millennia, have grown up around the creature, and to raise awareness in the general public that the shark is basically being hunted out of existence by poachers eager to sell its high-priced fin - shark-fin soup being one of the priciest delicacies in Asian cooking.  Compounding the tragedy is the fact that the fin is largely inedible and used mainly for ornamentation.  According to Stewart, 100 million sharks are killed each year to support this billion dollar industry, resulting in the world's shark population declining by an estimated 90%.  Yet, because they are not cute and cuddly creatures, there is no real constituency fighting for sharks as there is for dolphins and seals.  Stewart's film is a small-step attempt to rectify that situation.

Stewart begins by demonstrating that sharks and humans can exist in harmony together.  This he does by donning scuba gear and plunging into shark-infested waters where he proceeds to pet, cuddle and play with the animals, all without incident.  He also cites a number of statistics to back up his assertion, the prime one being that only five people per year on average are killed by sharks while a hundred or so are killed annually by elephants.

Then he moves on to the more political aspects of the issue.  The movie sets up an interesting dichotomy between two realms of existence, juxtaposing the beauty of nature with the ugliness of the human world.  For while we're being shown eye-popping, multi-colored images of life under water - all in gorgeous hi-def, I might add - there's plenty of drama taking place on the high seas, as Stewart joins up with Paul Watson, a ""direct action"" conservationist who has devoted his entire adult life to roaming the oceans, trying to put a halt to the wholesale slaughter of the creatures who reside therein.  We see Watson and his crew getting into tense confrontations with poachers, only to find THEMSELVES the object of pursuit by Costa Rican authorities.  Stewart points out how corrupt governments like the one in Costa Rica outlaw shark hunting on an official level - in order to maintain their appeal to eco-conscious tourists - then secretly profit from it by looking the other way as poachers illegally operate off their coasts.

And it isn't just out of compassion for the shark that Stewart and his buddies have mounted a crusade against this mass poaching.  It's out of concern for the ecosystem itself, as the diminution or, heaven forbid, the elimination of one of the world's great predators could upset the delicate natural balance in ways we can not yet fully comprehend - including potentially increasing the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere if plankton-eating creatures that are current shark prey are allowed to flourish in ever-greater numbers.

But there is hope.  At the time this film was released (2007), sixteen countries had already banned shark-finning (hopefully more effectively than Costa Rica), and the general public had begun to fight back, as evidenced by mass street protests that began springing up in places like Costa Rica to help raise awareness of the issue - much as this film itself does.

Stewart - who wrote, directed, produced and served as cinematographer for this amazing and inspiring film - can be justifiably proud of both his mission and his work.",1310169600,4,3539,5.022222222222222

As soon as we stop paying for shark finning, there will be nobody willing to do it. I sincerely hope this is easier than stopping people to pay for drugs.
Even if you are not militant on the conservationism troops, this movie will entertain and leave a strong feeling about the importance of sharks in Nature, before we discover it the hard way.

If my voice could be heard by what is left of the sharks, then, I'd tell them ""I'm sorry"",  even though my remorse would not bring back the sharks made victim to (according to filmmaker Rob Stewart) the 90% decline, over the past 50 years. I've learned this sad fact:
most of the sharks killed have been killed for their fins, so people could have their delicacy, make money and go deeper and further into denial, denying that the day is so close for the air to be so polluted that breathing clean air, which was supposed to be a natural right, would turn into a far away myth, fairytale, and fantasy.
The ocean provides much of the Earth's oxygen, and included in sharks' prey is a type of fish that eats phytoplankton, an important photosynthetic plant that provides oxygene for our already damaged planet.
Where are we going to turn when all the sharks are gone?
Would money heal our Earth?
Years ago, I saw a bumper sticker that read, ""Humans are not the only species on Earth. We just act like it."" , and so we have and so we do. But when is the end to ignorance and greed?
All the trouble, all the money and all the energy that goes into destroying the beings that make the chain of life (that is sacred), could and would cure hunger, illnesses and poverty. But greed finally would take away life as we know it.
The children would forget the ocean, the forest, clean air, animals and what was always meant to be sacred, LIFE!

3103874,5,B0013D8LHW,"""Sharkwater"" is a fascinating Canadian documentary featuring the scuba diver Rob Stewart and the controversial environmentalist activist Paul Watson, the leader of the Sea Shepherd organization. Together, Stewart and Watson want to save - wait for it - the sharks!

I've heard of people who want to save whales or dolphins, but this is the first time I encounter people who actually want to save sharks. I didn't even know sharks were particularly threatened. Shark the hunter, man the hunted, right?

Not so, according to ""Sharkwater"". 90% of the shark population is already gone, and several species are threatened with extinction, including the peaceful whale shark (the world's largest fish). The documentary even claims that the complete extinction of sharks might affect the global climate, since shark predation stops other fish from overconsuming plankton. And plankton is necessary to keep the climate in balance.

I'm not sure if I buy that particular argument, or the claim that most sharks are pretty harmless to humans, but it's pretty clear from the documentary that all sharks are threatened by overfishing from the absurd shark finning industry. Conservations efforts are hampered by a variety of factors: shark fin soup and other shark-derived products are part of East Asian culture, the oceans are difficult to control, and many people don't like sharks anyway!

The most interesting part of ""Sharkwater"" features Paul Watson and his notorious activist group Sea Shepherd. I've heard of Sea Shepherd already 25 years ago, when they were literally attacking whaling ships in Iceland and Norway. Sea Shepherd has always been considered a dangerous extremist group.

Or so I imagined.

In ""Sharkwater"", Sea Shepherd is actually invited by the president of Costa Rica to protect the Cocos Island from poachers. However, as Watson and his ship approaches Costa Rica, something goes dangerously wrong. The local authorities in the coastal town of Puntarenas suddenly turn coat and start prosecuting Sea Shepherd, placing the entire crew in house arrest! Stewart goes AWOL and soon discovers what's going on: the Taiwanese mafia controls large and illegal shark finning facilities in the town, complete with secret ports. Here we have another and more disturbing reason why conservation efforts fail: sheer corruption. The mobsters presumably bought off the courts in Puntarenas, making sure they turn against Sea Shepherd.

Watson, Stewart and the other activists see no other choice than to leave Costa Rica as fast as possible, which they also manage to do under dramatic circumstances, the Sea Shepherd ship being chased by the coast guard. Instead, they set sail to the Galapagos Island, where they are on friendly terms with the local authorities (!). Undaunted, Stewart decides to go back to Costa Rica in secret, and even sneeks into Puntarenas where the people have started to protest against the Taiwanese mafia and their illegal activities. Taking advantage of the chaos, Stewart finally manages to visit the elusive Cocos Island, where he can be alone with his beloved sharks...

""Sharkwater"" does get a bit too romantic for my taste at times, but it's nevertheless one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. Indeed, it often comes close to being an adventure or action movie. To some extent, it's also a propaganda movie for the Sea Shepherd organization. Indeed, this is the film's weakest point, since Paul Watson turns out to be a misanthrope who apparently thinks sharks are better than primates (i.e. us). Perhaps when the sharks are safe and sound, we could feed this man to them? Still, I admit that these guys and their chases make great television!

As a scuba diver, sharks are what you want to see, especially the whale shark, but they are generally so shy they will certainly keep their distance.

The film sees Rob Stewart explore the `Darwin's theory of evolution' Galapagos islands and Costa Rica.  Rob is a professional underwater photographer and videographer so the images he captures while gliding through the depths are stunning.  That is until they turn to the finning operations, the corruption and images of sharks caught in a long lines where you can but ponder `what is humanity doing'.

This film really gives you a wake up call to the importance of the oceans and the sharks place at top of the food chain to keep everything balanced.

The books emphasis goes  more on the role of the Sea Shepherd, the ocean's eco systems and gives you a chance to look again at the gracefulness of the shark.

Though some might at first think this is another shark ""slasher"" movie, the film is actually a compassionate argument for shark protection. The sharks and other marine creatures are beautifully filmed, which provides a strong juxtaposition against filmaker Rob Stewart's coverage of the brutal sharkfin trade. Not for the faint of heart, there are scenes of wholesale shark-slaughter for their fins (a delicacy in China and sold for medicinal purposes in many countries). Stewart works with Sea Shepherd in the film and captures brave confrontations at sea with both pirates and police. Confrontations, even physical confrontations, are a necessary evil to bring attention to the need for enforcing the laws against illegal fishing that are so blatantly ignored. This film is heartbreaking in its portrayal of the injustice to sharks and other marine life threatened by over-exploitation. It's infuriating in its portrayal of the ignorance of the Chinese for their insistence on consuming tasteless shark fins to boast their status in society and for their insistence that shark products have magical medicinal powers. But Sharkwater is also beautiful in its portrayal of the majesty of sharks and other marine life and in its message that they are in dire need of protection. Creatures that have survived for hundreds of millions of years, that lived on this planet before the dinosaurs, are being wiped out by humans. This will be a tragic loss to future generations.

As an underwater documentary junkie I know good underwater filming when I see it and this movie's underwater shots are breath-taking.

But its not just a movie with pretty scenery.  Surely It's part documentary about conservation and nature, but its also a drama about political activism, man's greed, man's self-sacrifice and man's bravery.

this movie shows what people are will do to cover up whats illegal and how sharks are not a threat to us at all. for if they where people would die every day form them. they are creatures that need our protection! i have made everybody in my family watch this and it to has effected them maybe not in the same way as me but it did let them see what has happened to this earth and what its coming to. so i HOPE you watch this and that it effects you too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1211241600,,1350,4.003703703703704

3103990,5,B0013D8LHW,"This movie is a powerful commentary about the cruel exploitation of sharks - and the open oceans in general - by mankind.

Rob Stewart & his team have done an indredible job of bringing to light how these beautiful creatures are not the villians we have made them out to be. Rather, he argues that sharks are alpha predators that have kept many ocean ecosystems in check over the last 400 million years. However there is no international law protecting sharks, as there is for whales, pandas and other endangered creatures, and as a result over 90% of all shark populations have been ruthlessly wiped out, under our noses, out on the open oceans. This movie effectively conveys a sense of urgency about protecting these creatures against a back-drop of 21st century activism and derring-do. It also suggests that humans, not sharks, are the real scourge of the seas.

I first saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2006 and knew I would have to see it again in high-definition. Soundtrack is pretty fantastic too, with many established artists such as Portishead and Moby contributing. Kudos to National Geographic. But it is the underwater footage that stands out. It is first rate stuff, on a footing equal to the underwater film you see on 'Planet Earth'. Rare scenes of schooling hammerhead sharks and whale sharks are truly phenomenal. If you have ever been diving in Galapagos or Cocos island this film will quickly take you back to those trips. If you have not had the good luck to do so, you will quickly learn why it is so necessary to preserve these unique habitats.

Of special note: the Special Features has a video called 'Virtual Ocean' featuring high-def footage running in an endless loop set to great music. The footage is absolutely spectacular - on a high-definition television you can almost feel like you are scuba diving (yes folks, it is that spectacular). Footage does appear to be in 1080i, not 1080p but inspiring nonetheless.

Great one for your library.",1209945600,,1997,4.830409356725146
3103991,5,B0013D8LHW,"I'll get the nit out of the way: I found Stewart's narration a little annoying.  His voice had a note of smugness in it that grated on my ears.  BUT...The story is undeniably compelling and dramatic, the underwater photography as stunning as anything you'll see in ""Blue Planet,"" and everything is in service of a crucial ecological cause.  Ever since the late Steven Erwin hit the scene with his ""Crocodile Hunter"" persona, nature films have seemed to go out of their way to exclaim that this or that large and scary animal is ""beautiful"" or ""gorgeous,"" or by crikey, in some way less frightening than it really is for being, in fact, magnificent.  I see no contradiction.  Sharks are in fact essential to the health of the oceans, and they occupy a vital niche in the world's most important ecosystems.  'Nuff said, frankly.  No effort to convince me that most sharks are handsome or cuddly is going to work.  But it is impossible not to admire how supremely they have become adapted to their environment, over eons of deep time.  That honing is evident in the grace of some, the unique features of others, and the range and success of many.  All of which is now threatened by the species that fancies itself intelligent.  The blind forces of evolution have produced an astonishing creature that the ruthless intellect of humans now threatens to extinguish.  Stewart captures the obscenity and injustice of this state of affairs very powerfully in ""Sharkwater,"" making it one of few must-see documentaries.",1208995200,,1508,4.84765625

3103993,5,B0013D8LHW,"I was privileged to meet both Rob Stewart and Paul Watson at a media event, and both gave very emotional presentations on the plight of the world's oceans and the creatures we humans are systematically wiping out. Sharks, in particular, have received a bad rep throughout the ages, just like wolves on dry land. To understand these magnificent creatures you need to learn more about them. I have personally been in the water with sharks on several occasions and was fascinated by the amazing agility and grace these animals possess. Yes, wild animals can be dangerous, that's why we call them ""wild"", but if you know more about them you will realize that they do not deserve the bad reputation and shock effect they seem to generate among most people. Sharks have been around for eons, and humans, who have been around for just a comparably short time, are destroying them either because of fear, a misguided desire for ""exotic"" foods, or because they consider it a ""sport"". We have to come to our senses soon, or it will be too late for many species.

Having won over twenty international film awards and garnered much critical acclaim, it's shocking how little exposure and theatrical play this film has had in the US. Regardless, this is easily one of the very best documentaries I've seen.

I was taken off-guard by how little I really knew about sharks aside from the terrible misconceptions so many of us have been fed since childhood. Rob Stewart does a magnificent job of thoroughly dismantling the caricature of sharks as ferocious monsters deserving of our fear and hatred, instead capturing the gentle beauty and vital importance of these creatures to life as we know it. The frightening ordeal Stewart finds himself in while filming is worthwhile viewing in itself. You don't need to be an environmentalist to appreciate Stewart's courageous documentation of the heart-wrenching barbarity imposed upon sharks (and other aquatic life).

3338288,2,B0013D8LHW,"This movie missed it's mark. If the goal was to sway the mass audience that sharks are safe and should be protected, this film actually did the opposite. I suspect the majority of people who have viewed the film and left positive reviews are already passionate about shark protection. However, for the mass audience who grew up fearing Jaws and are not already passionate about shark protection, this movie does more damage than good for the cause.

The movie started well with beautiful imagery and an interesting premise that sharks are not the feared man eaters we grew up believing from the Jaws movies. I enjoyed the first 1/3 and was looking forward to being convinced the premise was true. However, the film took a turn from interesting to terrible early on.

*Slight SPOILER ALERT*

The movie turned bad when the director, Rob Stewart, met up with a fanatical animal rights activist, Paul Watson. Prior to this point in the film, Stewart laid the foundation that he was going to prove sharks were not dangerous and that they should be protected. Instead of proving this, the film shifted directions and the final 2/3's of it covered a fanatical, and illegal hunt for people fishing for sharks.

As a lay person to shark conservation, I wanted to believe Stewart's premise, but he lost all credibility with this film. I was neutral toward shark preservation prior to the film, but by the end of the movie I felt somewhat bad for the shark fisherman and found the conservationists fanatical and mentally unstable.

For example, Stewart and Watson, pursue shark fisherman in Costa Rica. Watson's ship appeared to be something similar to a small Navy destroyer or a Coast Guard cutter. They locate a tiny, beat-up fishing boat that was manned by men appearing desperately poor from a third world country and trying to survive. In the movie, Watson and/or Stewart paint a picture of the fisherman as greedy money grubbing corporate Wall Street types. While trying to paint this picture, the video displays a tiny, worn out fishing boat full of third world looking impoverished fisherman being rammed by a giant, expensive ship with a well fed, overweight captain. The message loses all credibility.

After countless attempts to harass the fisherman with a fire-hoses, etc, Watson began ramming the small fishing boat with a giant knife blade attached to his boat. He was actually trying to cut the fishing boat open to sink it on video. Watson brags about sinking other boats in the past. It was disturbing.

Eventually authorities rightfully arrest Stewart and Watson for attempted murder of the fisherman. Although there is some confusion, it appears the fisherman were not violating any laws by fishing for shark.

There were many graphic scenes of sharks being killed, or their fins being cut off live sharks and their live remains dumped at sea. This was eye opening and had a certain impact on us viewing the film, however, that message was lost in Stewart's nativity and Watson's over inflated ego and bully behavior.

Stewart lost further credibility when he interviewed another shark expert throughout the film who claimed how safe sharks are and how they don't attack people. Stewart does not disclose in the movie that this very shark expert was attacked by a shark himself.

I'm disappointed because the movie began so well and had so much potential. Including a fanatical animal right's activist who was willing to break the law and put the life of a shark before a human, was a real turn off to the cause and a sign of immaturity. To make progress with the average person, a more moderate, balanced messages is needed. Attacking people trying to make a living is not the way to inspire change or get the laws about shark hunting changed.

I left the film curious if sharks were as dangerous as most people think. That question was left unanswered with minimal to no evidence one way or the other. I was disturbed by the fining of sharks and the remains being discarded, but I was not convinced or shown ANY evidence that it poses a threat to the Eco system. I left thinking the shark protection activists in the movie were egotistical thrill seekers who would kill a human that was legally fishing for shark. I'm not sure that was the message Stewart was after.",1352332800,5,4278,4.814713896457766

I was moved by the motivation and message, and wish I could somehow get everyone on earth to watch this movie. It is so important for people to know about what is going on in our oceans. The alarms need to be sounded immediately and people need to stand up and fight before it is too late. It is estimated that over 90% of shark poulations have been eliminated from the World's oceans in the last 10 years due to the finning industry. If you eliminate the apex preditor in the ocean then you get massive imbalances. What happens if there are no sharks to consume dead and rotting whale carcasas in the ocean, or to kill off the sick and dying fish? You end up with a cesspool in the end, rather than a beautiful Ocean.

I think this is the most important issue that very few people in the world are aware of. We know nothing about shark breeding, and know that the gestation period is lengthy, and sharks also reach sexual maturity at a later stage in life. This is all bad stuff when it comes to keeping healthy numbers in our oceans, as the shark finning industry continues to rape and pillage our serene oceans.

Watch this movie and pass it along. Please please raise awareness before it is too late.

3338294,4,B0013D8LHW,"The documentary, ""Sharkwater,"" by filmmaker and naturalist Rob Stewart, has, essentially, a twofold purpose: to rehabilitate the reputation of the shark by countering many of the myths and misconceptions that, over the millennia, have grown up around the creature, and to raise awareness in the general public that the shark is basically being hunted out of existence by poachers eager to sell its high-priced fin - shark-fin soup being one of the priciest delicacies in Asian cooking.  Compounding the tragedy is the fact that the fin is largely inedible and used mainly for ornamentation.  According to Stewart, 100 million sharks are killed each year to support this billion dollar industry, resulting in the world's shark population declining by an estimated 90%.  Yet, because they are not cute and cuddly creatures, there is no real constituency fighting for sharks as there is for dolphins and seals.  Stewart's film is a small-step attempt to rectify that situation.

Stewart begins by demonstrating that sharks and humans can exist in harmony together.  This he does by donning scuba gear and plunging into shark-infested waters where he proceeds to pet, cuddle and play with the animals, all without incident.  He also cites a number of statistics to back up his assertion, the prime one being that only five people per year on average are killed by sharks while a hundred or so are killed annually by elephants.

Then he moves on to the more political aspects of the issue.  The movie sets up an interesting dichotomy between two realms of existence, juxtaposing the beauty of nature with the ugliness of the human world.  For while we're being shown eye-popping, multi-colored images of life under water - all in gorgeous hi-def, I might add - there's plenty of drama taking place on the high seas, as Stewart joins up with Paul Watson, a ""direct action"" conservationist who has devoted his entire adult life to roaming the oceans, trying to put a halt to the wholesale slaughter of the creatures who reside therein.  We see Watson and his crew getting into tense confrontations with poachers, only to find THEMSELVES the object of pursuit by Costa Rican authorities.  Stewart points out how corrupt governments like the one in Costa Rica outlaw shark hunting on an official level - in order to maintain their appeal to eco-conscious tourists - then secretly profit from it by looking the other way as poachers illegally operate off their coasts.

And it isn't just out of compassion for the shark that Stewart and his buddies have mounted a crusade against this mass poaching.  It's out of concern for the ecosystem itself, as the diminution or, heaven forbid, the elimination of one of the world's great predators could upset the delicate natural balance in ways we can not yet fully comprehend - including potentially increasing the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere if plankton-eating creatures that are current shark prey are allowed to flourish in ever-greater numbers.

But there is hope.  At the time this film was released (2007), sixteen countries had already banned shark-finning (hopefully more effectively than Costa Rica), and the general public had begun to fight back, as evidenced by mass street protests that began springing up in places like Costa Rica to help raise awareness of the issue - much as this film itself does.

Stewart - who wrote, directed, produced and served as cinematographer for this amazing and inspiring film - can be justifiably proud of both his mission and his work.",1310169600,4,3539,5.022222222222222

most of the sharks killed have been killed for their fins, so people could have their delicacy, make money and go deeper and further into denial, denying that the day is so close for the air to be so polluted that breathing clean air, which was supposed to be a natural right, would turn into a far away myth, fairytale, and fantasy.

3338371,5,B0013D8LHW,"""Sharkwater"" is a fascinating Canadian documentary featuring the scuba diver Rob Stewart and the controversial environmentalist activist Paul Watson, the leader of the Sea Shepherd organization. Together, Stewart and Watson want to save - wait for it - the sharks!

I've heard of people who want to save whales or dolphins, but this is the first time I encounter people who actually want to save sharks. I didn't even know sharks were particularly threatened. Shark the hunter, man the hunted, right?

Not so, according to ""Sharkwater"". 90% of the shark population is already gone, and several species are threatened with extinction, including the peaceful whale shark (the world's largest fish). The documentary even claims that the complete extinction of sharks might affect the global climate, since shark predation stops other fish from overconsuming plankton. And plankton is necessary to keep the climate in balance.

I'm not sure if I buy that particular argument, or the claim that most sharks are pretty harmless to humans, but it's pretty clear from the documentary that all sharks are threatened by overfishing from the absurd shark finning industry. Conservations efforts are hampered by a variety of factors: shark fin soup and other shark-derived products are part of East Asian culture, the oceans are difficult to control, and many people don't like sharks anyway!

The most interesting part of ""Sharkwater"" features Paul Watson and his notorious activist group Sea Shepherd. I've heard of Sea Shepherd already 25 years ago, when they were literally attacking whaling ships in Iceland and Norway. Sea Shepherd has always been considered a dangerous extremist group.

Or so I imagined.

In ""Sharkwater"", Sea Shepherd is actually invited by the president of Costa Rica to protect the Cocos Island from poachers. However, as Watson and his ship approaches Costa Rica, something goes dangerously wrong. The local authorities in the coastal town of Puntarenas suddenly turn coat and start prosecuting Sea Shepherd, placing the entire crew in house arrest! Stewart goes AWOL and soon discovers what's going on: the Taiwanese mafia controls large and illegal shark finning facilities in the town, complete with secret ports. Here we have another and more disturbing reason why conservation efforts fail: sheer corruption. The mobsters presumably bought off the courts in Puntarenas, making sure they turn against Sea Shepherd.

Watson, Stewart and the other activists see no other choice than to leave Costa Rica as fast as possible, which they also manage to do under dramatic circumstances, the Sea Shepherd ship being chased by the coast guard. Instead, they set sail to the Galapagos Island, where they are on friendly terms with the local authorities (!). Undaunted, Stewart decides to go back to Costa Rica in secret, and even sneeks into Puntarenas where the people have started to protest against the Taiwanese mafia and their illegal activities. Taking advantage of the chaos, Stewart finally manages to visit the elusive Cocos Island, where he can be alone with his beloved sharks...

""Sharkwater"" does get a bit too romantic for my taste at times, but it's nevertheless one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. Indeed, it often comes close to being an adventure or action movie. To some extent, it's also a propaganda movie for the Sea Shepherd organization. Indeed, this is the film's weakest point, since Paul Watson turns out to be a misanthrope who apparently thinks sharks are better than primates (i.e. us). Perhaps when the sharks are safe and sound, we could feed this man to them? Still, I admit that these guys and their chases make great television!

As a scuba diver, sharks are what you want to see, especially the whale shark, but they are generally so shy they will certainly keep their distance.

The film sees Rob Stewart explore the `Darwin's theory of evolution' Galapagos islands and Costa Rica.  Rob is a professional underwater photographer and videographer so the images he captures while gliding through the depths are stunning.  That is until they turn to the finning operations, the corruption and images of sharks caught in a long lines where you can but ponder `what is humanity doing'.

This film really gives you a wake up call to the importance of the oceans and the sharks place at top of the food chain to keep everything balanced.

The books emphasis goes  more on the role of the Sea Shepherd, the ocean's eco systems and gives you a chance to look again at the gracefulness of the shark.

Though some might at first think this is another shark ""slasher"" movie, the film is actually a compassionate argument for shark protection. The sharks and other marine creatures are beautifully filmed, which provides a strong juxtaposition against filmaker Rob Stewart's coverage of the brutal sharkfin trade. Not for the faint of heart, there are scenes of wholesale shark-slaughter for their fins (a delicacy in China and sold for medicinal purposes in many countries). Stewart works with Sea Shepherd in the film and captures brave confrontations at sea with both pirates and police. Confrontations, even physical confrontations, are a necessary evil to bring attention to the need for enforcing the laws against illegal fishing that are so blatantly ignored. This film is heartbreaking in its portrayal of the injustice to sharks and other marine life threatened by over-exploitation. It's infuriating in its portrayal of the ignorance of the Chinese for their insistence on consuming tasteless shark fins to boast their status in society and for their insistence that shark products have magical medicinal powers. But Sharkwater is also beautiful in its portrayal of the majesty of sharks and other marine life and in its message that they are in dire need of protection. Creatures that have survived for hundreds of millions of years, that lived on this planet before the dinosaurs, are being wiped out by humans. This will be a tragic loss to future generations.

3338487,5,B0013D8LHW,"This movie is a powerful commentary about the cruel exploitation of sharks - and the open oceans in general - by mankind.

Rob Stewart & his team have done an indredible job of bringing to light how these beautiful creatures are not the villians we have made them out to be. Rather, he argues that sharks are alpha predators that have kept many ocean ecosystems in check over the last 400 million years. However there is no international law protecting sharks, as there is for whales, pandas and other endangered creatures, and as a result over 90% of all shark populations have been ruthlessly wiped out, under our noses, out on the open oceans. This movie effectively conveys a sense of urgency about protecting these creatures against a back-drop of 21st century activism and derring-do. It also suggests that humans, not sharks, are the real scourge of the seas.

I first saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2006 and knew I would have to see it again in high-definition. Soundtrack is pretty fantastic too, with many established artists such as Portishead and Moby contributing. Kudos to National Geographic. But it is the underwater footage that stands out. It is first rate stuff, on a footing equal to the underwater film you see on 'Planet Earth'. Rare scenes of schooling hammerhead sharks and whale sharks are truly phenomenal. If you have ever been diving in Galapagos or Cocos island this film will quickly take you back to those trips. If you have not had the good luck to do so, you will quickly learn why it is so necessary to preserve these unique habitats.

Of special note: the Special Features has a video called 'Virtual Ocean' featuring high-def footage running in an endless loop set to great music. The footage is absolutely spectacular - on a high-definition television you can almost feel like you are scuba diving (yes folks, it is that spectacular). Footage does appear to be in 1080i, not 1080p but inspiring nonetheless.

BUT...The story is undeniably compelling and dramatic, the underwater photography as stunning as anything you'll see in ""Blue Planet,"" and everything is in service of a crucial ecological cause.  Ever since the late Steven Erwin hit the scene with his ""Crocodile Hunter"" persona, nature films have seemed to go out of their way to exclaim that this or that large and scary animal is ""beautiful"" or ""gorgeous,"" or by crikey, in some way less frightening than it really is for being, in fact, magnificent.  I see no contradiction.  Sharks are in fact essential to the health of the oceans, and they occupy a vital niche in the world's most important ecosystems.  'Nuff said, frankly.  No effort to convince me that most sharks are handsome or cuddly is going to work.  But it is impossible not to admire how supremely they have become adapted to their environment, over eons of deep time.  That honing is evident in the grace of some, the unique features of others, and the range and success of many.  All of which is now threatened by the species that fancies itself intelligent.  The blind forces of evolution have produced an astonishing creature that the ruthless intellect of humans now threatens to extinguish.

Yes, wild animals can be dangerous, that's why we call them ""wild"", but if you know more about them you will realize that they do not deserve the bad reputation and shock effect they seem to generate among most people. Sharks have been around for eons, and humans, who have been around for just a comparably short time, are destroying them either because of fear, a misguided desire for ""exotic"" foods, or because they consider it a ""sport"".

It's really sad what they do to these animals, Sharks are my favorite Marine animals and they aren't as dangerous as people believe them to be. I wanted to add this to my library of movies just incase I ever need to show someone a great shark documentary.",1458864000,,418,4.30379746835443
