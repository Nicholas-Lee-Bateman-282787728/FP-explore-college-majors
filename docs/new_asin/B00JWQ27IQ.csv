8655639,1,B00JWQ27IQ,"Much like Mr. Catona, my experience with singing teachers has been very disappointing.  Being taught and practicing ""proper"" technique left my voice weak and thin and worse than when I started.  I was really optimistic about this video and method,  as I thought his ideas made a lot of sense.  I practiced along with this dvd for several months.  At first I thought my vocal tone was sounding better,  however my success with this course ends there.  I now have no range to speak of.  I can no longer sing falsetto,  not something I used often but at least I could do so.  The only way I can sing any high note is to push it out loudly,  I cannot sing them softly.  Opposite, I cannot get any power behind low notes,  they are weak and useless.  I had really high hopes for this voice building technique but ended up with my worst voice ever.  Very disappointed and giving up.",1525824000,,876,4.3875
