8170410,5,B000MOM72I,"This is a good one for kids. Very educational, several species, a brief glimpse into another human culture. Only one kill, not shown on screen.  My son at first thought this was scary based on the music but he loves it now.  Might be boring if you are looking for something fast paced about tigers hunting, but from an education perspective great for kids. Not as quickly changing, flashing images.",1403913600,,398,4.671428571428572
8170411,5,B000MOM72I,"I've seen Planet Earth, Blue Planet and Life of Mammals -- but this is more in depth and specific. I thought it was great. Yes, I'm sure as another reviewer said, you've seen one tiger video up close... However, the monkeys, the trained otters, etc. make it different.",1241481600,3,268,4.604166666666667
8170412,4,B000MOM72I,"If you've seen several nature documentaries, you won't be in for much different here--except, perhaps, for the location, which is the swamps of India. In many ways, this video is similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Into-the-Lion-s-Den/dp/B000UYN9RC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Into the Lion's Den</a>. Here, a man goes to see and film the tigers living in the swamps of India. Whereas the naturalist in ""Into the Lion's Den"" approaches lions on foot, here the naturalist builds blinds from which he can film the tigers when they approach.

The footage is well shot and interesting, and the cats are beautiful. Most of the footage, though, is of the cats lying around or otherwise inactive. There is one kill, but the footage is not graphic. The booklet that accompanies the DVD is similar to an encyclopedia article. It contains all sorts of facts in small, easily read and digested tidbits. The booklet might be a bit difficult for a ten year old to process everything, but a child with an interest in big cats should find most of the book accessible and interesting.",1202774400,7,1117,5.382857142857143
