8411707,5,B00402LWWY,"I recently purchased the 2010 Japan Video Praise-Volume 2 DVD by Light4Japan Productions and was blessed beyond measure listening to 12 beautiful worship songs in Japanese! Eight well-known songs such as Shout to the Lord, Blessed Be the Name, and Power of Your Love have been translated and included along with four original Japanese songs. On-screen lyrics are in Japanese or Romanji (Japanese words written in our alphabet). Beautiful nature scenes and lovely faces from Japan and locations outside Japan provide a visual backdrop to inspire worship of our Lord while embracing His love for us. This DVD series is great for small groups of Japanese or individuals who are interested in worshiping the Lord through song in Japanese.",1505260800,,734,5.176470588235294
