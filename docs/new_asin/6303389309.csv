7844789,4,6303389309,"This is one of my favorite episodes of the entire series. This episode demonstrated everything that has made star trek as popular as it is forty years after it begin. The exchange between Riker and Worf about racial predjuidce is priceless and exemplifies why star trek has lasted as long as it has. Truly one of the best episodes ever made. If you are introducing someone to trek, this is the episode to show them.",1176076800,,415,4.546666666666667
7844790,3,6303389309,"The Enterprise responds to an unknown distress call from Galorndon Core, an uninhabited planet wracked by constant storms.  Riker, Worf and La Forge beam down and discover a Romulan craft that has crashed.  Searching for survivors, Riker and Worf find a wounded Romulan and are forced to beam back before they can find La Forge.  While the Enterprise figures out a way to locate their Chief Engineer, La Forge is attacked by another Romulan.  Because of the struggle and the violent storms of the planet, La Forge loses his vision and the Romulan can no longer walk.  Meanwhile, a Romulan ship has arrived upon the scene ready and willing to fight.
One of the standard war stories has a pair of enemy soldiers having to work with together in order to survive.  The most notable example of this would be the 1968 film ""Hell in the Pacific"" with Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune marooned together on an island.  Of course the story does not have to take place in a war, as Tony Curtis and Sidney Portier proved in ""The Defiant Ones.""  In the Next Generation episode ""The Enemy,"" the Federation is not a war with the Romulan Empire, but there is certainly a level of mutual distrust.  Consequently, this is a rather standard version of the tale, quite predictable.  The idea that the Romulans show up at a crash site and immediately start threatening to start a war is a bit over the top and loses the episode a star.  After all, the planet is causing enough problems without falling back on the Romulan ""Evil Empire"" stereotype.  Besides, the story is predicatable enough that neither LaVar Burton or anybody else has any really worthwhile dramatic moments.  Certainly a missed opportunity.",973555200,,1685,4.74914089347079
