It will probably change yours.  This film  follows an Angels descent to human life and a further descent into the  temptations of this world.  The movie is a bit long but worth watching  every minute.  I wish it weren't so expensive or I'd buy copies for my  entire family.  Buy it!",911260800,4,458,4.475609756097561

582471,5,6303148263,I have seen the movie years ago but did not know it;s name all this time. It was not until that I came across a bio on Wim Wender that I found out the name of the movie. I like the movie because it is not only European but is a personal and rewarding in and gives us a different and humane aspect of Angelic affairs. And that the role of angels is an everyday fact and that they have our interests at heart. The movie for me to track down the  movie took a while. So I was glad that it was available and in good order. I wanted to see the original because it is filmed in East Berlin as Wings of Desire was filmed in West Berlin. I had an ex-girlfriend who went to the places filmed in both movies and so I was able to hear first hand of the movie envisaged for us not governed in a harsh manner,1338854400,2,795,3.847560975609756
582472,5,6303148263,"Wings of Desire and its sequel, this movie, make up a beautiful story told beautifully--the cinematic equivalent of having your cake and eating it too. Wenders' idea of angels are supernatural people who go around taking commonplaces, basically--they're observers, now that people have stopped listening to them tell the message of the Good News. The plot is two angels choosing to be mortal. One chooses it for a girl and in short ""To say 'Ah!' and 'Oh!' and 'Hey!' instead of always 'Yea and amen'"" and one chooses it to prevent an accident. In real life, outside these movies, angels don't try to stop accidents. They should know that God has planned every beat of every wing (Matthew 10:28-31). God allows evil, but uses it to work everything out for good at the end of the story (Romans 8:28, James 1:2-4). Though angels do watch over believers, their primary work is praising God day and night (Isaiah 6:1-4, Psalm 103:20, Rev. 5:11). I doubt they get tired enough of it to prefer the good things that we get as humans, like coffee and surprise and bare feet in grass. In this film, the angel Cassiel got off to a pretty sad start as a human, which he simply couldn't have if he remembered all he knew about God. So disbelief must be suspended for there to be a plot at all. The characters' bittersweet ending can remind us of our own ending which is only sweet (John 5:28,29, Rev. 21:3-5), knowing that everything is under God's competent and gracious control.",1304294400,,1467,4.6461538461538465
582473,5,6303148263,"This is a wonderful movie of redemption.  The characters are skillfully drawn and filled with feeling.  The angels seem to feel so deeply the sorrows and foibles of the humans. When the angel Cassiel finds himself having become human, he struggles and learns the true meaning of unconditional love and sacrifice. This script and cinematography are superb!  The camera work is genius! I highly recommend this move to anyone who enjoys movies that evoke depths of emotion and poignancy.",1254268800,3,484,5.10126582278481
582474,4,6303148263,"This movie has the same director, same characters, same formula, and the same feel. Yet it is different and maybe even superior in different ways to ""Wings of Desire.""  However it does start off awfully slow paced and you're not sure where they're trying to go. It also takes a little bit of time of getting used to the characters switching from English to German and German to English on a whim. Sometimes this movie has the feeling that is designed to promote out of work actors. We see Peter Falk even getting to play Columbo. Nastassja Kinski, as Raphaela, was always a good actor. In this film, she excels and with a little age looks even better. A great antagonist in this film is Willem Dafoe as Emit Flesti; he almost makes you want to be the bad guy.

Movie based on:

""The light of the body is the eye.
If, therefore, thine eye be clear, the whole body shall be full of light.
But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness.""
(Matthew, VI, 22)

Our story takes place in post-Cold War Berlin in an area that is known is no man's land. Cassiel (Otto Sander) is frustrated as being an angel (an angle is nothing but the messenger) he can influence but not directly the nature of people. He crosses the line into reality to save the life of a fallen girl. This is where the adventure really begins as he must learn to see humans from a human perspective. In the process, he still knows right from wrong and must struggle to maintain the right. We suffer and triumph with him as he meets up once more with all the characters that he tried to interact with as an Angel. Will he be able to survive against evil?

582477,1,6303148263,"The first hour of this film follows the majesty, strength of ""Wings of Desire"" (Himmel Uber Berlin). The otherworldy and worldly resonate together on the screen. Philosophy, compassion, the Angel longing for Life is here again, played out again and again, for the first hour; I was entranced.

But when the Angel becomes Man, becomes Karl Engel, the film begins to lose focus, the pathos is weakened and characters becomes hard to relate to, especially Cassiel (now Karl Engel in human form). He becomes a thief, an alcoholic, gets mixed up with a mobster, does him a favor and from then on, everything becomes convoluted and strained, the plot faltering, the philosophy filled with platitudes. Even Willem Defoe's character becomes less intriguing and Raphaela (played by Kinksi) just another ball to jungle in the mess. Throw in the fact that the mobster was born in Germany and raised in America and finds his sister, the one who stayed behind during the second World War and you get the idea. (Even writing this review, I feel convoluted...)

And the ending, my word, so many loose ends and Wim Wenders expects the audience to just ignore them in the pseudo-grandeur of the last five minutes. Not to mention the anti-climatic antics of Karl Engel.

In Wim Wender's first film about angels becoming human, he remained faithful to his vision from the beginning. In this one, he starts out on one note, tries to Hollywoodize it with the next note, only attempting to go back to his original idea in the end. It feels like he started making a house of card, stopped used the cards, began to use domino pieces - the thing collapses and he goes back to using cards.

If you loved the first film, watch only the first hour of this. It should have been a short film. The only thing great that came out of this movie was the U2 music video, ""Faraway, So Close"" which I feel captures more of the magic of Wim Wenders' first film than this 'movie'.",1221868800,7,1941,4.650145772594752

582479,5,6303148263,"In searching for the transcendent, and for a spiritual explanation of its material certainties and flaws, there are people who choose to believe in angels, those unmaterial beings that watch over mortals perennially, shedding light and preventing souls from falling into darkness. It is certainly a great story line, and one that touches many, but ""Faraway so close"" distants itself from the mere and plain interest of the obvious subject and dares to explore way deeper in the uncertain terrains of beliefs, sentiments, destiny versus will, friendship and the very essence of good and evil. It ends up being a beautiful and moving screen poem. I just love this movie and treasure it at home as one of my favorites..

This is the long awaited sequel to a previous movie by Wim Wenders under the title ""Wings of Desire"". In the first movie, Damiel (Bruno Ganz) an angelic being, falls in love with Marion (Solveig Dommartin) a mortal woman. Due to the strength of his feelings, Damiel chooses to make the transition to mortality and ends up forming a mortal family. The movie comes across as a beautiful love story.

In ""Faraway so close"" a somewhat darker side of the same process is told. Cassiel (Otto Sanders) another angel, and friend of Damiel, makes the same transition to mortality but essentially, to prevent destiny from fulfilling itself. That is, for the wrong reasons although for a good end (saving a little girl's life). Mortality ends up being a painful and shocking process for Cassiel no matter how desperately Damiel and his family try to help. In the end, there is some sort of agreement that the time for Cassiel to come down to this earth was not right. And perhaps neither were the reasons. However, destiny shows up again, and time comes for Cassiel to leave its mortal self and set things right again. The momentum is symbolized by Emit Flesti (Willem Defoe). Spell it backwards and the name will read ""Time itself"".

Certainly a thought-provoking kind of movie, with a great script in German, English, French and Italian and an impressive photography and marvelous direction. Beautiful and well constructed characters abound such as Raphaela (a companion angel for Cassiel, played by Nastassja Kinski), Tony Baker (Horst Bucholz), Heinz Rahrmann (Konrad), Philip Winter (Rudiger Vogeler), Camilla Pontabry (who plays Doria, Damiel and Marion's daughter) and of course the already beloved characters of Damiel, Cassiel and Marion.

Cameo appearances by Lou Reed, Mikhail Gorbachov and Peter Falk are included, all playing themselves. And the post-Berlin wall setting, together with the contradictions and conflicts still present in current German society are worth every penny. It is certainly not a mainstream sort of movie, yet in my opinion it delivers a strong message to everyone with a touch of spirituality and wanders about life, death, love, fate, will, good, evil and the essentials of our presence in this earth.",1145404800,24,2947,5.05761316872428
582510,5,6303148263,"Wenders retakes the characters of Wings of desire with a visible purpose: to recreate a memorable metaphoric story around the fall of the ominous Berlin 's Wall, as well as existential considerations These angels are true messengers capable to help the men, far beyond to remain so close but just so far. He permeates the story with a very smart approach around the ethical behavior through this harp reflection in the film: ""The people thinks have conquered the world, but the true is the world has conquered the people.""  This concept is the core of the work because recalls us in last instance the role of the artist in the world: Not pretend to change the world, but the world don' t change him.""

As a matter of fact Wenders underlines a formidable concept: The consume of excessive images, a typical feature of the actual world, makes the love to be in danger, because brings with it the forgetfulness about ""to know to look.""  Besides, the cynical attitude of the store boss who decide exchange porno videos for old weapons of the missed East Germany is simply prodigious. But the film is ambitious because there are besides, important allusions respect the solitude, the existential void, the redemption 's loss and the time' s fugacity.

This is a film that deserves from you your most careful attention, abnegate dedication and total commitment. It' s a formidable work with countless issues which deal about the human condition in those times.",1137110400,3,1454,4.850806451612903
582511,5,6303148263,"It's the kind of story I think we need to know this days. I've read an analysis about it, years ago, which can resume very well what is behind this master piece, but you'll need to see ""Wings of Desire"" too if you are really aimed to undestand. So, taking both films in account, they are about good reasons for an angel to become human beings: love by a special person or a irrestible necessity to protect the good feellings humans are still capable to heve.",1125792000,5,458,4.337209302325581

582513,2,6303148263,"In Wim Wender's follow-up to ""Wings of Desire,"" the angel Cassiel (Otto Sandler) becomes human and struggles with the depravity and the spiritual blindness of mortals to establish a moral life.  Becoming confused along the way, he flirts with addiction and criminality.  The previous film was nearly plotless, achieving its effect by revealing the thoughts of random humans so that we could perceive ourselves just as the angels perceive us.  The result was surreal wordplay juxtaposed with provocative images.

By contrast, this film is nothing but plot, as Cassiel meets so many people and becomes involved in so many outlandish events that it becomes impossible to care about any of it.  Peter Falk's cameo as a former angel doesn't work this time around, nor does veteran Velvet Underground rocker Lou Reed, whose inclusion seems to be nothing more than an egregious case of star worship.  Throw in gangsters, circus performers, and a rescue by bungee cord that climaxes the film, and you are left with a complete mess./",1103760000,12,1024,5.065476190476191

FAR AWAY, SO CLOSE! is the flip side to ""Wings of Desire.""  Here, instead of desiring to be flesh and blood, the angel seeks to understand why humans have such a hard time experiencing the spiritual.  These two films, taken together, offer a stunning and profoundly moving picture of the bittersweet, paradoxical and all-too-brief human experience.

582516,5,6303148263,"One of Wneders better efforts, I would call this more of a companion to rather than a sequel to ""Wings of Desire"".  Overall, I think ""Wings of Desire"" was a better movie, it seems as though Wenders was trying to be a little more mainstream in this film, but nonetheless, an excellent film in the same veign as ""Wings of Desire"".  I think it would have been that much better if he hadn't spent so much time on the character who was an arms dealer and the angels attempts to thwart his operation.  This section of the movie came off as a mad cap adventure, and was not true to the overall tone and message of the film.  But perhaps Wenders was trying to interject some levity in this film, he is known to be a bit heavy-handed in his other efforts.
I would not necessarily say that one MUST see ""Wings of Desire"" to enjoy this film, but it would sure help, as that film sets up much the character development for ""Far Away, So Close""
Both films are insightful, well written, thought-provoking, well acted, and have great cinematography.

582518,4,6303148263,"Unlike the angel in ""Wings of Desire,"" who longed to be human to experience the pleasures and satisfactions of being in a physical body, the angel in ""Faraway So Close"" (more a companion piece than a sequel to ""Wings of Desire"") longs to be human to see through man's eyes and discover why human beings find it so difficult to experience the spiritual.
The angel reborn into a physical body learns the harsh lessons of life: humans can barely see beyond their own physical bodies much less glimpse the spiritual world; time passes quickly and often leaves one behind in the dust without anyone noticing or caring; and the bitterness of loneliness is a terrible thing. This is in direct contradistinction to the angel in ""Wings of Desire."" That angel finds joy and satisfaction in love, work and family.
Wenders, therefore, brilliantly shows us both sides of the human coin. The postive side is reflected in ""Wings of Desire"" and represent love and growth and the negative side is reflected in ""Faraway So Close"" and signify loneliness and decay. Although ""Faraway So Close"" sacrifices the originality that ""Wings of Desire"" offered us, it makes up for it by completing the human picture; for ""Wings of Desire"" and this film form a complete and compelling whole.",1009411200,104,1261,4.869767441860465

No more original ideas are left to make its sequel a viable continuation. Perhaps that's why ""Far away..."" looks so tired, so exhausted of creative impulse, undecided between the tragic and the comical. The devices that are impressive in ""Wings"", such as the internal murmurs, the down-to-earth dialogue between angels and an ""inspired"" Peter Falk, don't work here with the same impact. Apparently Wenders attempted to make up for the lack of original ideas with a more story-like narrative, but that is a poor compensation.

In this film viewers are returned to Berlin (albeit in the  post-Cold War era), to see how Cassiel struggles with the barrier that  exists between men and angels (for those of you who have not seen  ""Wings of Desire"" - Cassiel is an angel). As with the first film,  the angels in this movie watch over humans as if they are there own  charges. Casssiel's problems eminate from his desire to make contact with  these people, much the same way that Damiel did in ""Wings of  Desire"".
Cassiel achieves his wish when he is forced to a make a  split-second decision to save a young girl's life. By interceding he  becomes a part of the world he had only been able to view from afar. The  rest of the movie thus focuses on how Cassiel deals with the pressures and  stresses of being ""human"". I don't want to give away too much of  the story so I'll stop my description here.
