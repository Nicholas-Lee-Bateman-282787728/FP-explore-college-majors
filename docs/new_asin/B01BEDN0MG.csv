7633217,5,B01BEDN0MG,"Brokenwood Mysteries, Series 2. This popular New Zealand television series returns for a second  helping of four feature-length detective stories.  Its part of the invasion of highly entertaining entertainment from Down Under: Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries, A Place to Call Home, Jack Irish, Janet King, The Slap, The Code, The Doctor Blake Mysteries, resembles Midsomer Murders in its idyllic setting and lightness of touch.

Detective Senior Sergeant Mike Shepherd (the immensely likeable, rumpled Neill Reathink COLOMBOGo Girls) has  transferred from the big city to the small town of Brokenwood, settled into the relaxed rhythms of seemingly quiet country life, discovered that murder happens everywhere. His methodical young assistant, Detective Kristin Sims (Fern Sutherland, The  Almighty Johnsons), has adapted to Shepherds unconventional ways, even tolerates listening to country music in his 1971 classic car. So there is growing accord between the mismatched pair, but all is not well in Brokenwood:  passions simmering beneath the sleepy surface regularly erupt into gruesome crimes.

In these four feature-length mysteries, Shepherd and Sims contend with a potential serial killer, a group of egocentric thespians, a family of territorial fishermen, the mysterious death of Shepherds favorite country singer. As filmed on location in New Zealands beautiful North Island, these engrossing mysteries boast tight scripts, compelling characters, dry humor, and piquant wit. The episodes are:

1. Leather and Lace. DC Breen and his rugby team show up for practice, are appalled to find their coach's body prominently displayed. Shepherd and Sims struggle to find out who would do this to a popular pillar of the community.  A second body is found; the detectives believe the deaths are related.
2. To Die or Not to Die. Shepherds friend/employee Jared, a young Maori, lands the title role in The Brokenwood Theatre Society's production of Shakespeares Hamlet.  However, a young cast member, Ben Faulkner, dies at the end of the debut performance. The detectives initially think Ben died of natural causes.
3. The Catch of the Day. Jared discovers a severed human hand in a crayfish pot on Brokenwood Beach. Shepherd, Sims, and Breen set about finding who the hand belongs to, whether he is still somehow alive. Signs seem to point to the Keely family, owners of the crayfish pot, fierce protectors of their family's fishing legacy, territories.
4. Blood Pink. Shepherd and Jared attend a concert by Shepherd's favorite country musician, Holly Collins; she announces that it will be her final show.  She is found electrocuted the next morning in her motel bathtub.  It appears to be suicide--or perhaps drunken accident. But Shepherd believes the cause of death to be more sinister.

Scene after scene of this top- drawer production is lovely to look at.  The touch is light; no profanity, sexual scenes, disturbing images. I received the boxed four DVD set for review, in order to pen an honest, unbiased review.  It runs approximately 367 minutes.  Has subtitles, thank goodness, the Kiwi accent is one of the strangest Ive ever heard. It also has a four minute behind the scenes featurette and a photo gallery. The series is charming, well-written, gripping and funny, with more than its quota of twists and turns. Rea does a manful job of leading the investigations and carrying the shows: he solves grisly murders, all the while remaining easy-going, intelligent, capable of humor and wit. Fine family entertainment.",1461801600,10,3528,5.318345323741007
7633218,5,B01BEDN0MG,"If you are coming to this review and have not watched Series (Season) 1, then go look for that and order it. Its really better to start at the beginning. But be aware of any reviews containing Spoilers. After all this is a mystery series (though an offbeat often comedic one). This review  like my others will NOT contain spoilers.

Brokenwood was produced in New Zealand for NZ TV.

Now that I have those familiar with the series, welcome to Series 2. This time we have four separate 90 minute mysteries with DI Mike Shepherd (who for some reason NEVER ties his necktie or closes the top button on his shirt), his right hand person DC Kristin Sims and a few minor characters. Each of the 4 stories stands on its own and is complete. You could watch them in any order and it wouldnt matter. What we get in this show is a dead body (at least one) and lot of suspects and there is usually a theme. Brokenwood is SMALL town and characters repeat appearances. The pharmacist shows up in both Disc 3 and 4. The subjects this time have to do with a local production of Hamlet, A murder on the local Football (soccer team) and the death of a Country Music star. (If you know Season One, you already know that Shepherd is a big country music fan. So these are not spoilers since they are obvious in the first minute. Who did the murder is Shepherd and Sims job and you follow along.
I will point out that there is some real graphic violence here though no graphic language. Its definitely an individual preference but I find that some of the accents are sometimes hard to decipher and I find the English subtitles a big help. (There are easy to read on the DVD. They are not on the streaming versions.

The DVD has two bonuses, neither is important or useful. One is a photo gallery. The other is a Behind The Scenes featurette that features the actors who play Shepherd and Sims and lasts about five minutes.  Unlike other BTS featurettes, I didn't learn anything new.

I'd also like to make one other suggestion: When you chose an episode, before you have the option to PLAY it, a ""synopsis"" appears on the screen. My suggestion: IGNORE IT and just press play.  A few of these synopses have spoilers in them and reading them first - the first time you watch - adds nothing to your enjoyment. The same gores, IIMHO, for reviews that provide these ""summaries"". Really, you don't need them!

I truly love this series and  if you are coming to this review  you probably do too. No loose ends here but I look forward to a Series Three!

Not that , as I post this review, the DVD had not been released. It will be released on May 3, 2016. I was provided an advance copy in exchange for an objective review.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7633219,5,B01BEDN0MG,"A cop show that engages the viewer better than the average murder mystery TV show. It is not heavy and dark like many of the contemporary shows. The investigation is more intellectual, not reliant as much on science and technology as are most current police who-dun-its. I LIKE THAT.
Brokenwood has action, humor, real front-page-possible plots while visually stimulating as a travelogue (filmed on New Zealands north island.)

Developed characters return from this series debut. DSS Mike Shepherd (Neill Rea) commands Brokenwood CIB (Criminal Investigation Branch). He uses his wits to assimilate clues, and even sits and talks to the dead victims. Perky, dedicated, Det. Sims (Fern Sutherland) hates the Country music Shepherd plays in his classic cars cassette player. I agree with Sims, but the shows background music is only Country snippets. Jared (Pana Herma Taylor) is the local love-magnet familiar with the Brokenwood turf & surf. DC Sam Breen (Nic Sampson) is third man on the team with Gina Kadinsky (Christina Ionda) the pathologist.

SDH SUBTITLES for all 4 stories, each 1  hour length.
=[1]=Leather and Lace
DC Breens rugby Brokenwood Cheetahs teams likable coach Arnie is dead on the play field, stripped, and strapped to a goalpost. A ladys knickers murder, a case for DSS Shepherd & Sims. Is Breen a suspect?
=[2]=To Die or Not to Die
Actor Ben dies onstage at the end of The Brokenwood Theatre Society  Hamlet presentationfor real. Jared played the lead, will the investigation lead to him as the culprit? Is one of the grieving cast only acting?
=[3]=Catch of the Day
Not the best day of fishing when a severed hand is a part of the days Brokenwood Beach catch. Is the owner alive or dead? The Brokenwood detectives must face a fishing territory feud. A lovely seaside crime.
=[4]=Blood Pink
DSS Shepherd's country music love is a factor when a singing favorite is playing and dying in Brokenwood. Murder or suicide must be solved by the crime team. Of course the rest of the band is suspect. Which of the guys wears lipstick?, the only obvious clue.

Our house liked the first season, and we love season 2, and long for a 3rd.",1460505600,16,2148,4.8901098901098905

7633222,2,B01BEDN0MG,"I have watched many good Detective series from AU and NZ and this one is the most boring of all. There is NO Thrill or Suspense in the stories, or even any urgency on the part of the Team to solve these crimes. They are so relaxed and nonchalant about their job, like they are solving a cross-word puzzle, not murders. The characters are also 2 dimensional, so it's impossible to get to know them or to care about who done the crimes and why. The only enjoyable part in the series is the photography of scenic NZ countryside.",1516752000,,525,4.313131313131313

7633258,4,B01BEDN0MG,"""The Brokenwood Mysteries"" Series 2 returns to the small New Zealand town and its laid-back, slightly eccentric inhabitants for another four murder mysteries. Detective Senior Sergeant Mike Shepherd (Neill Rea) and Detective Sims (Fern Sutherland) have developed a good working relationship, and Shepherd has become more trusting of Sims. Sharply-dressed Detective Constable Breen (Nic Sampson) has a bigger presence this season. He's always deadpan and quite funny is episodes 1-3, though more serious in episode 4 this season. Dr. Gina Kadinsky (Christina Ionda), morbid Russian pathologist who struggles to understand ""the English humor"" and flirts with Shepherd in the strangest way, is a scene-stealer. And Shepherd still talks to corpses, though not to all of them, which is odd. The Frog & Cheetah seems to be the only social establishment in town.

This series is a relief from angst-driven detectives who spend more time fighting their own dysfunction than they do fighting crime. Brokenwood's detectives are highly functional, good-natured people driven by a sense of duty to their community. The show has a comic undertone; it never takes anyone very seriously. It still feels like the episodes should have been 60 minutes rather than 90, the show's single persistent flaw. The second episode is lower in quality than the others and a bit tedious. The detectives spin their wheels for an hour and a half; the suspects all have weak motives; and the investigation is directionless. That's the exception to generally high quality mysteries. Someone remarked to me that the mysteries are very different from one another. It's true that these don't have the sameness that some series do. The comic perspective allows for wildly varied murders.

The DVDs: All discs offer optional English subtitles and a scene index. Disc 4 bonus features include a featurette of Cast & Crew Interviews and a Photo Gallery, which is a slide show of behind-the-scenes stills.

The episodes are:

The coach of DC Breen's rugby team, Arnie Langstone (Phil Vaughan), is found dead, stripped and bound to a goal post with ladies' panties stuffed down his throat in ""Leather and Lace."" Langstone was considered a good guy by all who knew him, in spite of having led the Brokenwood Cheetahs on a 50-game losing streak. The coach had denounced violence and aggression in the game following the tragic death of a player on the field, and the team had suffered. DC Breen is forced to sit this one out and pines to be back on the case to avoid doing endless chores at home. Arnie's estranged wife Barbara (Rebecca Swaney) was having an affair with Steve (Ben Barrington), a player with anger management issues. And out-of-towner Dena Clark (Julia Hyde) disappeared the night of the murder, after her car ran out of gas. But the mystery may turn on some missing library books.

An actor keels over dead in the Brokenwood Theatre Society's production of ""Hamlet"", as detectives Shepherd and Sims look on in ""To Die or Not To Die."" Twenty-one-year-old Ben Falkner (Nick Davies) was killed by potassium cyanide, but how he ingested it is a mystery. Ben had recently broken off a relationship with actress Juliet Phelps (Holly Hudson), who subsequently has a breakdown. Juliet's mother Ruth (Robyn Malcolm) is the stage manager and an aspiring actress of little talent, and her father is the company's manager Ralph St. John (Peter Hambleton). The detectives reckon that they all have motives, though seemingly weak, to kill Falkner, but so do costumer Gray Jenkins (Bruce Phillips), an older ex-actor with a shine for young Falkner, and Gray's lover Neil Bloom (Phil Peleton), a pharmacist with access to cyanide. The detectives are in the dark until the final sequence.

Jared (Pana Hema-Taylor) is out for an early morning surf on Brokenwood Beach in ""Catch of the Day"", when he finds a severed human hand in a crayfish pot. The pot belongs to the Keely family, an old cray catcher family resented by the newer aquaculture businesses for their attitude of entitlement. The body of fisheries officer Bryce Fahey is discovered caught in equipment operated by Pullman Aquaculture on its mussel farm. Fahey was killed with a spear gun while diving in an undisclosed location, before his hand was removed. The Keelys, led by belligerent Tommy Keely (Cohen Holloway), despised Bryce and felt he was on the take to Pullman. Fisheries officer Noel Cleland (Stephen Papps) felt the same. Bryce's wife Jools (Ingrid Park) has a relationship with Pullman's lawyer Dennis Buchanan (Shane Cortese). But where Fahey was killed is key.

DSS Shepherd drags Jared to a country music concert featuring sensation Holly Collins (Bronwyn Turei) in ""Blood Pink."" Surprising everyone, including her band, Collins announces their breakup and her impending move to Nashville onstage. She is found by the maid the next morning electrocuted to death in her hotel room bathtub, holding an electric guitar in the wrong hand, with the words ""Goodbye, Holly C"" scrawled in pink lipstick on the mirror. After accepting condolences from Gina and Detective Sims, Shepherd investigates or tries to. Collins' entire band, two roadies, and manager Ritchie Mathis (Eryn Wilson) are no where to be found. As they learn of Collins' death and trickle in, they present numerous motives for murder. Shepherd finds himself consulting rabid Collins fans Celia (Jacque Drew) and Rayleen (Yvette Parsons) for insight into the band.",1492128000,,5461,5.115470852017937

7633282,4,B01BEDN0MG,"The little New Zealand town of Brokenwood is like many little towns in England and the United States: lots and lots of murder on a weekly basis.  And those who have seen the first season of this quirky little mystery series will know roughly what to expect  in ""Brokenwood Mysteries, Series 2"" -- gorgeous scenery, bizarre deaths, and an undercurrent of clever, slightly offbeat humor that permeates every single episode.

""Leather & Lace"": A local rugby coach is found stripped naked, tied to the goalposts and suffocated by a pair of black lacy panties. Nobody has any idea why he would be murdered, since he was almost universally loved and admired by the people of Brokenwood. But as Detective Inspector Shepherd (Neill Rea) and Detective Constable Sims (Fern Sutherland) dig deeper, they discover that he had some hidden sides that nobody knew of -- and clearly, an enemy who hated him enough to kill.

""To Die or Not to Die"": Seconds after finishing ""Hamlet,"" the actor who played Laertes collapses and dies from cyanide poisoning.... and yet, nobody can figure out how the guy was murdered. Shepherd and Sims must investigate who dunnit, and how and why the murder was committed, but first they must unravel the webs of love, hate and artistic obsession that run through the theater company.

""Catch of the Day"": A severed hand is found in a crayfish trap, forcing the police to try to figure out whose hand it is, and whether the owner is still alive. But when the body is found nearby, Shepherd quickly uncovers the rather sordid details of the victim's personal life. And when Sims investigates a family of dedicated crayfishermen, she discovers that there may be a past murder linked to the present one.

""Blood Pink"": Shepherd's favorite country star has come to Brokenwood.... but her final New Zealand performance turns out to be her last one ever, as she's found electrocuted in the bathtub with her electric guitar. Her band had plenty of motives to kill her, but did one of them actually do it? As he tries to find out who, the young child of the drummer goes mysteriously missing, and another corpse is found...

Those familiar with British murder mystery series will probably recognize a similar tone to ""Brokenwood Mysteries, Series 2"" -- a picturesque small town that is somehow riddled with bizarre murders. What sets this series apart is the unique, quirky edge that I've seen in other New Zealand movies and TV shows, whether it's a sobbing forklift driver or a professional possum-skinner. No crime is so awful that Kiwis can't wring some humor from it.

But don't worry, the crimes are often horrific and there's plenty of death (cyanide, drowning, choking, electrocution), as well as some subplots that are handled with all the seriousness they demand (a small child going missing). There's also a lot of nimble dialogue (Sam Breen lamenting having to quiz old ladies about embroidered underwear) and clever clues woven into the story, which may seem minor but are actually quite significant (a past tragedy, a phone call, a young actress' immature romantic pursuits).

And the actors are absolute delights -- Rea plays Shepherd as a dry eccentric who is obsessed with country music and chitchats with corpses, and is sometimes a bit put off by the weirdos that live in Brokenwood. Sutherland is a good counterpoint as a more ordinary young cop, though with a similar dry sense of humor and her own list of weird experiences (including the ""What is that SMELL?"" first date).

And there are a couple of solid supporting actors in Nic Sampson as the ""normal"" cop (who is always having disastrous suspect interviews), and Cristina Ionda as the morbidly wacky Russian medical examiner who is constantly talking about how much Russia sucks. And of course, Pana Hema Taylor as Shepherd's laid-back, jack-of-all-trades Maori neighbor.

""Brokenwood Mysteries Series 2"" is a solid, entertainingly quirky take on the standard murder mystery formula, and a pleasant way to visit New Zealand without the jet lag. Charming and fun.",1481068800,2,4045,4.9338235294117645

They left us hanging a bit at the end of Season 1, and I wondered if a return trip to New Zealand was going to happen but then Acorn issued a fresh a new season, four totally absorbing, twisty tales and a marvelous escape into crime, NZ style. Sims is always by-the-book in approaching each case, but experience has taught her that there 's much to learn from her elder, more 'creative' partner. Shepherd, who would make Columbo proud with his methods, his ratty Ford and his devotion to Country Western music, views each crime from a different perspective than Sims but their work dovetails into a seamless net that snares the bad guys. Creeps and crooks stand no chance against these two, who rival Barnaby & Troy (the beloved Midsomer Murders saga) as favorite detectives you'd like to see solving the mysteries in your neighborhood.

7633332,5,B01BEDN0MG,"Senior Sergeant Mike Shepherd and his partner Detective Kristin Sims are back and I, for one, couldn't be happier.
Shepherd and Sims first paired up when he came to Brokenwood to investigate a murder in the first series. Sent from police headquarters, he is a lone wolf investigator who rubs some of the local cops the wrong way as he tries to figure out why a prominent local man was killed. Sims is among the local cops who doesn't take to him - at least at first - but by the end of the season's four episodes they've figured out how to work together.
In Series 2 they've become real partners and that makes this season's episodes even more enjoyable than the first one.
Sims is sassy and she gives as good as she gets when she and Shepherd swap theories and insults. Played wonderfully by Fern Sutherland, Sims is methodical, often inspired, and not the least bit afraid to contradict Shepherd when she thinks he's on the wrong track - admirable qualities in a partner. Neill Rea as Shepherd is rumpled, usually needs a shave, and is a veteran investigator whose talent and experience are a perfect match for his younger colleague's skill set.
This four-episode series involves some pretty bizarre crimes, including one in which a rugby coach is found dead and tied to a goalpost with a deflated football covering his face. Figuring out who killed the coach - and why - takes not only patient digging and inspired guesswork but also a short course in physics.
(Sounds confusing but, trust me, it all becomes clear in the end.)
Set on New Zealand's incredibly beautiful North Island, ""The Brokenwood Mysteries"" has been compared to the UK's long-running ""Midsomer Murders"" series but I'm not sure that I would agree. To my mind, this is a uniquely New Zealand offering, able to stand on its own two feet.
Shepherd, for example, is a country music fan, has been married and divorced more than once (though just how many times he's made a trip to the altar is not exactly clear), and is unconventional not only in his appearance but also in his way of approaching an investigation. Sims, meanwhile, is not someone who dutifully follows along in her boss's footsteps. She dislikes country music (and regularly tells Shepherd that), has a mind of her own, a wealth of local knowledge that Shepherd doesn't possess, and is perfectly capable of standing foursquare in the face of danger. Together, Shepherd and Sims are a formidable team precisely because, in my opinion, they are each capable of handling a case on their own.
The verdict: This is a great mystery series with twisty plots, intriguing characters, great chemistry between Rea and Sutherland, and some unexpected lighter moments that add some flavor to the narratives. Paired with incomparable scenery, it's a show I highly recommend.",1464134400,9,2795,4.800829875518672

7633337,5,B01BEDN0MG,"The 5,000-strong town of Brokenwood, New Zealand, is once again host to multiple murderers. If it were a real town, it's murder-per-capita would be one for the record books.

DSS Mike Shepherd and Detective Kristin Sims are more comfortable with each other, now that they've solved some mysteries together. Sims now understands Shepherd's inclination to talk to the corpses. She doesn't even roll her eyes at his goofy humor, usually  and gets in some one-liners herself. He hasn't converted her to country music, but he doesn't stop trying.

I'm glad to see the return of the irrepressible Jared Morehu (MORE eh hoo) who is a philosopher par excellence. Who else would understand the physics behind gardening? And there's Dr. Kadinsky, the medical examiner. She is from Russia and gamely struggles to understand what she calls ""English humor"", such as when she tells Shepherd about a body with one hand missing: ""The victim, he was very handsome.... Hand Some. A man with only some of his hands.""

""Brokenwood"" is a semi-light-hearted police procedural with some laugh-out-loud moments.

Series 2 originally aired Sept/Oct 2015. Each episode is 1  hours, which gives a lot of time for each plot and characterization to develop. That's 6 hours of nice mystery viewing. The DVD also has two short Bonus Features. English subtitles are available for the episodes and the first Bonus.

....Episode 1  ""Leather and Lace"" Nineteen year-old Dena Clarke, pretty and dressed for a night on the town, has run out of gas late at night on a rural road. A passing car nearly runs her over when she tries to flag it down. It stops a bit ahead of her and, puzzled, she takes a photo of its license plate with her phone. Then it backs up and soon Dena is running through the woods screaming with her pursuer silent, swift and deadly. No use running from the driver of a car with a bumper sticker claiming ""Can't Beat a Cheetah"".
....Episode 2  ""To Die or Not to Die""  Jared is playing Laertes in the Brokenwood amateur theater production of ""Hamlet."" Jared explains why Shakespeare appeals: ""I always really liked the words, you know? A bit like hip-hop without the fat beats."" Mike and Kristin attend a performance, and Mike only sleeps through half of it. He wakes up for the actors taking their bows at the end, just in time to see one of the actors die on stage..
I love the pronunciation of British names, even though it can drive me crazy. The theater director is named Ralph St. John. It's pronounced rafe SIN jin.
....Episode 3  ""Catch of the Day"" In the early morning of an overcast day, Jared heads for the water off Brokenwood Beach with his surfboard. But there's no surfing for him. Instead he finds a craypot in the shallow water, it's only catch a severed human hand. Pointing right at him, he later claims. Now they need to find the body it was attached to.
Trivia: In New Zealand, a cray-pot is for catching rock lobster.
Check out a scene with DC Sam Breen's car approaching a rural house. I love the optical illusion where a car is moving forward, but the spokes on the wheels appear to be moving backwards.
....Episode 4  ""Blood Pink"" Mike has done himself proud  he's wearing cowboy boots and a western shirt. And he's talked Kristin into joining him at the Brokenwood concert of local country & western star Holly Collins and her group, the Hole in the Wall Gang. At the end of the concert, Holly announces that ""Tonight is the last time the Hole in the Wall Gang will play together."" As this is the first the band had heard that their jobs were ending, Collins could expect some resentment. But enough to kill her?
....Bonus Features
A.  ""Cast & Crew Interviews"" (3 minutes) Fern Sutherland (plays Kristin Sims) and Neill Rea (plays Mike Shepherd) talk a bit about how the dynamics have changed between their characters, now that they know each other better.
B.  ""Photo Gallery""  (2 minutes)

""Brokenwood Series 3"" is in production. I can't wait for to the continuation of this enjoyable mystery series. Mike Shepherd's stubble gets a little longer each year. Maybe by Series 3 he will have a full beard.

Not only are the episodes well written, but the cast has wonderful chemistry and the level of acting is so good that the viewer believes what is being portrayed, whether it is heartfelt drama or simply small town eccentricity.  I started watching this series mainly for the ""exotic"" setting of New Zealand and found entertaining characters, plots that held my interest and that Brokenwood has many of the characteristics of small towns everywhere.  Murder is a grimm business, and in Brokenwood you get not only the detective's perspectives, but also those of the community.  The victims are well known in town and have histories that cause the Ladies Sewing Club among others  to offer assistance and opinions to the detectives.  Of course there are always cheese rolls and a bit of gossip to go along with the help. Whether it is the local rugby team, the community theater, a long time feud, or a concert stop for a favorite country singer, the story will keep you involved to the finish and wondering if Simms will ever make the coffee so anyone can drink it.",1462060800,2,1289,4.836363636363636
