8149124,5,B000J3OR8E,Great production by a legendary stonemaster and archaeologist!!! This is a must-view for all those immersed in paleo research.,1410652800,,126,5.684210526315789
8149125,5,B000J3OR8E,I like this dvd but it was too advanced for my abilites at this time. Very interesting though and as my abilites improve I will have a great dvd to dig out of the closet.,1359504000,,170,3.8857142857142857
8149126,5,B000J3OR8E,"Nice video demonstrating the knapping of a point in a logical storyline.  Its not a how to video, but a good demo by a knowledgeable knapper.",1255824000,,141,4.423076923076923
8149127,5,B000J3OR8E,"I found it very interesting and is helping me over come a couple of problems that I couldnn;t figure out,Very good product for the price",1222992000,,136,4.48
8149128,5,B000J3OR8E,"I guess I am really snowed by Dr. Bradley, but his background, working on so many important paleo archaeological sites, Clovis culture sites, and his teaching credentials, tied together with his obvious knapping talent, and ability to communicate verbally while he is demonstrating....really impresses me.  I have watched the video maybe 25 times.  My favorite knapping video, followed by videos by Mr. W. Blackwell and Mr. Jim Redfearn, both of whom have a talent for teaching while knapping.  This video is a lot cheaper than tutition to the University of Exeter where Dr. Bradley teaches.",1196121600,4,591,5.2
8149129,3,B000J3OR8E,"This DVD is an archaeological peice, not a ""how to"". If you want to learn flintknapping DC Waldorf's ""The Art of Flintknapping"" is a better place to start. In Clovis Technology Bruce Bradley introduces new archaeoligical evidence that the Clovis point was made using a technique known as overshot flaking. Bradley is a skilled flintknapper and this technique must be hard because he fails at it. After removing only a few overshot flakes he  resorts to conventional knapping and never gets back to overshot flaking. He blaims this on a new billet that he had never used before. Not sure why the project wasn't scrapped and filmed another day when things were going right. It would have been more educational to see the point made completely with overshot technology.",1182816000,7,766,4.937984496124031
