3002135,1,B000XEFQHA,I like the CD but it stops in the middle of the tape but I really like the movement of the exercise.,1355702400,,100,3.590909090909091
3002136,5,B000XEFQHA,"This DVD clearly instructs you how to do the exercises, and it gives you an idea of how to connect with the energy movement involved.  Some of the exercises take awhile to connect with, but they feel like the real thing when you do.

I've been working with DVDs for almost two years now.  This is the best that I've seen so far.  Not a bad price, either.",1350950400,4,354,4.161764705882353

3002138,5,B000XEFQHA,"I had this tape and played it so long, the tape wore out.. it's a great workout for beginners of chi kung and for teaching students.. unlike the postures of yoga or tai chi, chi kung is easy to learn and can be practiced anywhere for as long or short as you like.. the workout doesn't look strenuous but it will increase your energy, flexibility and internal organ strength..",1335657600,6,375,4.449275362318841
3002139,3,B000XEFQHA,"The instruction on this dvd is very good and it is a very good routine (although it may be a bit much if you are a real beginner/couch potato.)  However, this dvd was filmed in front of a screen that allowed the producer to add varying backgrounds and the backgrounds are rapidly changing, sometimes ""flashing"" from one to the next in a way that is very distracting and detracts from the overall presentation.  It would have been much nicer if this had been filmed with a single background of a beach or mountain scene.  This unfortunate use of technology diminishes the experience of what would have otherwise been a great instructional dvd. I have own over 20 different Qi Gong videos, and this one rates near the bottom compared to many that are better quality both in terms of the instruction and the overall esthetic quality of the production and scenery.  If you are looking for a great Qi Gong Series, I recommend Lee Holden (Exercise to Heal, not the Sounds True Production).  The Exercise to Heal videos are all recorded in beautiful natural surroundings (i.e. Lake Tahoe) that add to the relaxing and peaceful quality of the practice.",1296086400,30,1144,4.728643216080402

3002142,5,B000XEFQHA,"For those of you who are not familiar with him, Dr. Jerry Alan Johnson is authentic and the genuine thing! Jerry has covered many points that are seldom mentioned or even not known by other instructors in the TAO YIN rules. Traditional Chinese Medicine makes a whole lot more sense when you review that section.

8228115,4,B000XEFQHA,"The workout was manageable for a beginner.  From an intellectual perspective, I might have liked a little more information on the exercises.  Yet, the additional information may have detracted from the exercises and may have become cumbersome in DVD with repetitive viewing.  The one thing I really liked was the backgrounds used.  Chinese Medicine is so effective at using nature to explain the concepts.  The backgrounds were thoughtfully selected and really helped drive home ""ah ha"" moments.  An example was one movement was talking about releasing frozen energy in the body.  The background was an Alaskan glacier calfing and falling into the ocean.  I completely got it.  The intensity and time commitment of freezing energy in the body.  The breaking up and melting away into an enormous ocean.  The thoughtfulness and subtle clarity of the DVD allowed me to see a compassionate, dedicated, and thoughtful person who reached out to all senses to help his students learn.  Would highly recommend.",1472428800,,1002,5.19375

8228119,1,B000XEFQHA,I purchased this because of the reviews. The changing flashing backgrounds were very unsettling. the instruction was very hard to follow.

8228120,5,B000XEFQHA,"A great video that describes the qigong practices very well.  I learned these as purgations (called cleansings in the video) and the five tonification exercises for the organs previously, but Dr. Johnson's descriptions are very thorough, helping one to fully benefit from the practice.  Thanks for producing this!  It was very helpful.",1428278400,3,335,5.403846153846154
