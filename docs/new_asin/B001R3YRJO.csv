3772865,5,B001R3YRJO,"This DVD is perfect if you are thinking of visiting Britain. Wales is the original Celtic homeland - not many people realize that before English became the dominant language, an early form of Welsh was spoken across the British isles and this language is still spoken in parts of Wales today. Apart from the language, Wales offers visitors a host of reasons to visit from 1000 year old castles to modern theme parks for the whole family. With beautiful beaches and coastline and some spectacular mountain areas all within a few hours of each other there will be something for everyone in Wales! Highly recommended...",1234569600,,616,4.876190476190477
3772868,4,B001R3YRJO,"Almost perfect, Cariad... Rachel has a low-key and lovely way with the people and places visited. A bit of thoughtful modern editing in certain  ""too-long"" sections and better sound quality would boost this to 4 stars. We lived in West Wales for years, and thoroughly enjoyed seeing old haunts and hidden treasures again. I've recommended this travelogue to friends planning journeys to Cymru. Diolch yn fawr!",1417737600,,409,5.196969696969697
3772869,3,B001R3YRJO,"It is ok, but a bit dry. Could have made it a bit more exciting.",1414540800,,64,3.3333333333333335
3772870,4,B001R3YRJO,Interesting--beautiful country.,1412380800,,31,15.0
3772871,1,B001R3YRJO,Believe she was doing this as a project for a degree. Very juvenile and not at all interesting. Never went into detail in any areas of Wales. The only item of interest was the spoon carving. Don't know any more about Wales now than before watching this video. Utterly ridiculous.,1411084800,3,279,4.6
3772872,5,B001R3YRJO,"I lived in Wales as a child, so the pictures of the towns and castles were very dear to me.",1406332800,,91,3.6
3772873,2,B001R3YRJO,Basically an infomercial for tourist attractions in Wales....no real historical information at all.  Tried to cover the entire country in 20 second video clips.  Not worth the effort to watch.,1385596800,2,192,5.366666666666666
3772874,3,B001R3YRJO,Feels like it was made by a chamber of commerce.  Nice shots of the countryside and some historic places. Ok.,1382832000,2,109,4.45
3772875,2,B001R3YRJO,"I would not recommend this DVD. Moderator jumped around the country. Feel that I need to watch it 2 or 3 times more. There are better DVDs out there, I am sure.",1374710400,,160,4.03125
3772876,3,B001R3YRJO,"Travel video that did not spend enough time at each destination to make me think I'd ever want to visit
Wales",1365033600,,109,4.238095238095238
3772877,2,B001R3YRJO,I looked forward to this dvd because it was newer and filmed in high definition.  I was hoping for beautiful scenery similar to others I have bought - hoping to see more of the place we visited.  This was more of a vacation commercial for people in the UK.  I can't imagine that anyone outside the UK would be that interested in all the roller coasters and petting zoos.  So much of this video was spent on things that looked as though you could have been anywhere.  I was hoping to see lots more panoramic high definition photography of the things that make Wales unique.  Instead there were surfers and people jumping into water and windsurfing.  The dvd seemed to be trying to convince people to come to Wales to surf and swim and ride roller coasters.  Tourists are far more likely to be interested in the castles - which were covered with about 5 to 10 seconds each for most of them.  Instead of seeing the Brecon Beacons scenery - they focused on the whiskey distillery and close-ups of the bottles in the factory.  Very expensive for such disappointment.,1264291200,4,1061,4.536842105263158
8337256,2,B001R3YRJO,Interesting but,1481414400,,15,7.0
8337257,2,B001R3YRJO,"Very disjointed - no maps to orient onself - audio levels jump around.

There is some interesting coverage of special events at the many destinations covered - almost all of which are communities.  There is almost no coverage of landscape - geology - mining history - etc.

If you are going, I'd think it worth a look.  If you've been - your memories should do fine.",1477958400,,366,4.5
8337258,3,B001R3YRJO,"It does a fair job in showing some of the more interesting places in this very beautiful and friendly country.  However, there is too much time spent in showing Ms. Hicks walking from place to place.",1447632000,,199,4.527777777777778
8337259,4,B001R3YRJO,Excellent guide through Wales!  Very personable host too!  Great place for photography.  A must visit!,1446076800,,102,5.666666666666667
8337260,4,B001R3YRJO,Informative introduction to tourist attractions in Wales. Narrator is easy to listen to; very useful for anyone considering travel to Wales and good overview of charming locations.,1440806400,,180,5.703703703703703
8337261,4,B001R3YRJO,Great program.  Enjoyed the history,1435968000,,35,6.0

8337264,5,B001R3YRJO,"Rachel Hicks does a great job at showing us the hidden gems of Wales. I always try to to skip the tourist attractions when vacationing, and she gave me a lot of unconventional things to do in Wales. Very high quality travel film!",1428278400,,229,4.348837209302325
8337265,1,B001R3YRJO,Very amateur photography and questionable choice of places visited make this video quite unappealing.  We didn't get through it all.,1425945600,,132,5.6
