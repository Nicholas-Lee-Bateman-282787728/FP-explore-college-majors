3559537,5,B001F114IA,"This movie was a big surprise. I had seen the trailer and thought I knew what to expect, but was completely blown by the fantastic photography and by Gonzalo Sanchez Sala's performance. It is a history of a boy that needs to be loved, with ghosts hunting him from the past. Sexual awakening, fear and treason.
The director is able to make the mundane scenes into delicate art, pay extra attention to the morning scene of the boy in bed.
This is a must see, must have. It is a shame that it didn't make the big screens. Thank you Spain and Ivan Noel for allowing your movies to express this kind of art.",1236816000,41,602,4.2894736842105265
3559538,4,B001F114IA,"What starts out seemingly as an intergenerational love story between a shy, lonely 13 year old living with his mother in the Spanish countryside and an older man just passing through eventually becomes something else altogether. I compare this film favorably to Wild Tigers I Have Known, another coming of age story told in long, painterly takes, except that this movie, with the help of its filming locations, is even more beautiful to look at. Quick research tells me that this is the director's first film, and I can only hope there is more to come. The acting is wonderful, especially considering that most of the young cast are novices. A truly heartbreaking story which refuses to give a pat Hollywood ending (though some sense of closure would have been nice, but that is my only gripe). I found myself so taken with Pablo in this story, and wanting him to heal the wounds he is carrying around with him. In the end, we don't know whether he does or not, and that was more tragic than all that had come before. If you love a deep story, great and pristene images of Spain, and a slight but well crafted mystery, then do not miss this film. Spread the word!",1235865600,48,1163,4.542857142857143
3559539,5,B001F114IA,"A coming-of-age tale with more than a few twists, director Ivan Noel's debut makes superb use of its setting--the gorgeous rolling hills and verdant fields of Andalusia in southern Spain--to underscore young Pablo's (a note-perfect Gonzalo Sanchez Salas) discovery of secrets, both about himself as a growing lad haunted by his father's death, and about his family in general.

While his put-upon mom tries to make ends meet, Pablo--whose father died in an accident, the nature of which is only revealed gradually in flashbacks--roams the fecund countryside, frequently accompanied by his vastly more mature tomboy friend Julia (spark-plug Ana Tutor, in a star-making performance). Alone one day, he comes across a man, Paco, (Francisco Alfonsin) lounging beside his broken-down car. A conversation is started and then interrupted by the nosey local postman, who warns Pablo about strange men. The postman gone, the conversation resumes--and where it leads shakes Pablo and everyone around him to the core.

Director Noel shoots the gloriously sunlit countryside around the village of Jerez with the eye of a painter while showing his expertise at playing with audience expectations. It is this sure-handed way with what turns out to be a surprising narrative, the naturalism of the local townspeople in their first acting roles, and the almost dangerous sensuality of the cinematography, that marks In Your Absence as a very impressive first film.

THIS IS THE OFFICIAL SYNOPSIS, WHICH HAS NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN AMAZON'S LISTING:

13-year-old Pablo is a quiet, lonely boy with a troubled past.  His only friend is Julia, a shameless 15-year-old girl who is more than willing to help Pablo with his transition from childhood to adolescence, and give him some advice on sex, love and life in general.  On a quiet country road just outside of the village, Pablo meets Paco, an oddly calm, well dressed stranger whose car just broke down.  Nevertheless, he seems more interested in the boy than fixing his problem.  At first Pablo maintains a cautious distance from the stranger, vaguely heeding his fellow villagers' advice to keep his distance.  However, the boy's subconscious quest to find understanding of his dark past and guilt makes him lose all of his protective layers.  He sees a new friend in Paco; someone he can open up to and feel valued by almost like a replacement father.  As Pablo's affection grows for the man, he is unknowingly and blindly being lead toward a tragedy that will scar him for life.",1223683200,82,2513,5.1048780487804875

It is evocative enough to be explanatory for those teens who are 'adult' enough to understand, yet covert enough to not scandalise very young children who might be viewing while in their most impressionable stage of sexual/emotional development.

This man focuses his attention at the boy. many people thinking that he was a child molester-especially those who really are child molesters and they are hidden. This boy gets confused and thinks that he is love with the man and the man with him. This a story of coming of age, the awakening of sexual feelings, and the sense of betrayal. Very good the roles of the actors in the film-especially the boy.
The movie was made with taste, tact, and presented the subject matter in a very responsible way-this is not a pornographic movie about pedophilia, a very artistic presentation of the subject matter of coming of age in the life of a boy. Very well done. I recommend it to persons with a very open mind.",1394582400,3,813,4.426666666666667

A stranger appears on the scene and there is anxiety created about the intention of this man in regards to the boy.  The relationship between the boy and this man becomes the key plot of the film.  The ending is matter of fact.  There is no happily-ever-after finish but one that is more likely to have occurred.,1368057600,,423,4.6

I do see  a lot of indie films.... and the common thread to them is they seem very believable in their story, like you are watching as a fly on the wall of a situation.... not watching ""actors"". I read saw the commentary by the director who said there was no script as such, only a story board apparently. Well you sure wouldn't know that from the presentation. I did not see a disclaimer in the closing credits about no animals being harmed during the filming..... or maybe I just didn't see it. The chlld main character did certainly take ""chances"" as they say when filming... Probably because Europeans tend to deal with nudity and sexuality much different than uptight America does. Maybe another reason why non American indie films are more viewed as seeing a real appearing depiction of life, shall we say. The ending was not especially clear, at least to me as to what transpired from the incident near the end of the period of time when the boy is younger to the final scene of him now older......",1366243200,3,1068,4.5625

Much reviewed here, on YouTube, on IMDB, and more via Google.

DON'T READ REVIEWS.
Many bad plot spoilers; most much personal viewpoint.

Just order it and watch movie.  See on-disk comments and how-we-made-it.
Then, if interested, see reviews -- some with fascinating comments and rants by writer-director.

Beautiful photography.
Pleasant and appropriate flamenco-like music.
(By writer-director and played by him and lead kid.)
Nice travelogue of Andalusian countryside and village.

Plot will hold your attention; although, to me, some inexplicable scenes and loose ends.

Not really a teen-age or gay love (or sex) story.  In fact, a (count 'em) sextuple tragedy

Great casting and acting, including the supporting roles and, especially, the lead kid.",1320192000,2,902,6.45

And one thing that is open to the viewers imagination is that you're not sure if the boy has a crush on the stranger or just looks up to him as a role model.",1292716800,4,433,3.769230769230769
3559588,2,B001F114IA,"This film was quite a disappointment to me. From the very beginning, it was clear that the photography was going to be clunky and amateurish, and it was. The sound was OK, and fortunately the subtitles were very good. The story was of the rambling variety - I could have gladly edited out 20 minutes of the film. To its credit, the DVD has a Making Of Commentary, which helps pinpoint the beautiful region of Spain where the film was shot.
The main story was interesting enough - and the 13 year old boy, Pablo, was a sympathetic character. The tension created between him and Paco, ""the stranger with a past"" was quite interesting, but the film's climax bordered on the ludicrous.
This film would have been a success on Argentinian or Mexican television, but I can't recommend it here.  Sorry, but I have to pull the ladder on this one.",1287187200,5,837,4.543046357615894

It looks at first as if this is going to end in tears, and so it does, but not for the reasons one expects:  for there are deceptions and mixed messages aplenty.  Ultimately the boy is betrayed by this man, and also by his mother; and though the villagers try to protect him he is on his own.  A gem of a performance from the boy, as also from the rather older and more mature girl who is all set to show him what sex is all about, to his confusion.  I don't think this is a coming-of-age film so much as one of love and betrayal.  Beautiful, at times life-affirming, but finally sad, I loved it!",1268179200,9,852,4.29375

3559603,5,B001F114IA,"If I had any pre-conceived notions about this film before I watched it, they were completely blown out of the water by what I saw.

Paco comes to a small village in Spain, and finds himself stranded on the roadside when his car breaks down. By accident or by design, he first meets Pablo. Pablo's father has recently been killed in an accident that Pablo very much blames himself for. So when Paco is kind and understanding, it only serves to remind Pablo of what a cruel and unforgiving man his father had been. Paco manages to develop a relationship with the boy, while keeping up the pretence that he's come to this village to find Pablo's father, who was an old Army buddy. Meanwhile, the entire village is buzzing with gossip about this stranger in town, and his odd attachment to a thirteen year old local boy.

Pablo, at thirteen, is confused by his adolescent sexual feelings. His friend Julia, a bit older and more sexually mature, presents young Pablo with his first sexual encounter, and that only serves to deepen Pablo's confusion. But he begins to realise that his attraction to Paco may be more than parental. He's developed something of a crush on the kind stranger. So he decides to offer himself to the older man, and is surprised when his offer is refused. His confusion about Paco is cleared up when he discovers the man in bed with someone else, and overhears their conversation, where it is explained that Paco was indeed a friend of Pablo's late father. Something I don't think Pablo had quite believed. And Pablo's heart is broken to find that Paco is in love with someone else in the village, not him.  In a fit of jealous rage and deep pain over being deceived, Pablo decides to shoot Paco with his father's shotgun.

The film ends with a scene depicting Pablo and Paco years later, as Paco tries to explain that he has forgiven the boy. But what seems evident is that Pablo has not forgiven Paco for the apparent deception. He seems to have grown into a sad and lonely adult. And we are left to wonder whether he ever sorted out his sexual identity.

(If anything, an opposite impression is driven home relentlessly.) At that moment all believability was gone and I felt as though I'd been manipulated for the sake of the screenwriter's indulgence.

Still, I can recommend ""En Tu Ausencia"" for all its positive attributes and I don't regret watching it. The music soundtrack is also worth mentioning because it is so omnipresent and evocative, almost like another character in the film.

This film features fine acting - especially by the two main protagonists - and a plot which constantly has you second guessing in the wrong direction. Some may find it's hinting at paedophilia and the boy's nudity a little disturbing. In context, it is not, and you soon realise that that aspect of the boy's behaviour being 'disturbing' is also echoed by the main male lead. As often makes a good plot, there is the element of misunderstanding and characters taking the wrong message. A totally thought provoking film.",1244937600,18,754,5.04
