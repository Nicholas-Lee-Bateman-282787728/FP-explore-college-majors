Using re-enactments and with commentary by noted authors and historians, it goes on to tell the stories of such notable captives as Mary Rowlandson, James Smith, Oliver Spencer, and Mary Jemison.  Each of these individuals tell their own unique story of the barbarism and kindness they experienced at the hands of their Indian captors.  Some, like James Smith and Mary Jemison, spent many years among the Indians and were adopted into the tribe, becoming fully assimilated into their culture.  The video also examines the literary genere of the ""Captivity Narrative"" which became quite popular in the 18th and 19th centuries.  These accounts, often lurid and adventurous tales, became a much sought-after form of entertainment.  This video gives an excellent introduction to this fascinating subject.",1047600000,2,933,5.312925170068027
