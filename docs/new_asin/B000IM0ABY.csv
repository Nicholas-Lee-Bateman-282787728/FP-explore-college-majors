8146232,3,B000IM0ABY,"After watching the BBC version of ""The Office"" on DVD I also watched the American version of ""The Office"" on DVD.

You get a different feel for a show when instead of waiting a week between episodes, and then several months between seasons; you watch the whole season in a week or two.

If you've seen either version, you'll like the other. If you've seen neither version, I expect you'll like them both. If I had to pick one or the other though, my opinion is that the BBC version is better.

They're both essentially the same show. The sets look the same, the characters are pretty much the same except for their names; the premise is the same, the story lines, plots, and style of humor are similar.

The one outstanding difference, in my opinion, is that I classify the BBC version as a ""farcical satire"" while the USA version is a ""satirical farce."" Meaning the USA version is far sillier and far more unrealistic. Let's take an analytical look at the stars of the shows.

The Regional Manager

--------------------

David Brent (Ricky Gervais) of the BBC version is an incompetent buffoon who often says outrageous things. You could call him a jerk as well.

Michael Scott (Steve Carell) of the USA version is an exact copy of Brent, except much worse, and a bit creepier.

While David Brent would say something once in awhile that made you think ""I can't believe he just said that!""... Michael Scott says something like that about every 3 minutes.

Brent was a normal heterosexual. Scott is mostly heterosexual but has a weird attraction to a young temp, Ryan, which often is expressed in a creepy manner.

I have nothing against homosexuality or bisexuality. The way it's presented in Michael Scott's character, however, is unsettling. For example, on one episode, Scott asks Ryan to come to work 2 hours early, ostensibly to bring him a breakfast sandwich. Which he does. Then when Ryan asks ""Why did you need me early?"", Scott says ""To bring me this sausage egg cheese biscuit. Take a couple hours, the office is yours. Risky Business, Home Alone. Take off your pants, run around, do whatever you want.""

Creepy.

Assistant TO The Regional Manager

---------------------------------

In the BBC version, bad haircut victim Gareth Keenan (Mackenzie Crook) is the uptight, power hungry Assistant To the Regional Manager who likes to call himself the Assistant Regional Manager.

In the USA version, we have Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). Bad haircut, power hungry, thinks he's a martial artist, part time volunteer deputy sheriff, and fiercely loyal to his boss. Same as Gareth except Gareth is in the U.K. version of the National Guard instead of the police.

The Dwight/Gareth character sometimes acts very childish, especially when antagonized (or as they say in the BBC version, ""being wound up"") by their archenemy Tim/Jim.

Tim/Jim Salesman & Dawn/Pam Receptionist

----------------------------------------

Tim (Martin Freeman) in the UK Office often conspires with the receptionist Dawn Tinsley (Lucy Davis) in ""winding up"" Gareth with various pranks such as putting his stapler in a big Jello like a fossilized insect forever trapped in amber.

Tim and Dawn get along very well. They have a subtle romance going on for most of the series, except Dawn is engaged to one of the guys who works in the warehouse. So they mostly keep their feelings suppressed.

In the USA office we have Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) taking the place of Tim & Dawn.

Everything about their relationship is the same as in the BBC version of the show, but the subtlety has been eliminated. Jim and Pam OBVIOUSLY are attracted to each other from the very beginning, where as with Tim and Dawn it isn't quite so obvious until after a few episodes.

The ""minor"" characters in the show are all mirrored: UK Keith becomes USA Kevin; UK Chris ""Finchy"" Finch becomes USA Todd Packer, etc. Even the WRITERS are the same! Steve Merchant and Ricky Gervais created and wrote the UK series... and they both are also credited as writers for the entire 47 episodes (so far) of the US series.

While I see the USA version as far less subtle, it's also much more ""stretched out"" (47 episodes during 3 years) than the UK version, which consisted of only 14 episodes during 3 years. After 14 episodes of the US version, Michael Scott is still the boss; whereas David Brent was long gone. I've watched all but the last 2 episodes of Season 2 and I'm wondering how long it will take for Scott to be fired. Or if they're not going to fire him.

Having Gervais and Merchant on the writing staff of The Office can be seen as positive or negative. The negative is that the US version of the show is simply repeating what's already been done on the UK version. The positive is that perhaps the quality will be higher now that they've had their practice run with the UK version.

Both the UK and US versions of ""The Office"" have made me laugh out loud unexpectedly. Which I hardly ever do. So they are both good comedies.",1176508800,,5012,4.750865051903114

I have to admit, I didn't like this show the first time I saw it. But it has grown on me, I now look forward to Thursdays all week. I watched both seasons in three days. Couldn't stop laughing.",1159747200,3,338,4.2153846153846155
