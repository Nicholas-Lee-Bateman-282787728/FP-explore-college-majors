As he has been the favorite for many greats, too many to mention in this review, I appreciate that there is a book with him in it. Bashiri is a musical genius! I am so glad this book is available to those wanting to learn from him!",1303257600,,401,4.0886075949367084
8595035,1,0757938892,"This a poor excuse for an educational video on several levels. Firstly it comes across as a shameless vehicle to plug Bashiri's avergage tunes. Secondly he never really 'demonstrates' the elements of what he's doing, taking no time to inspire the viewer to 'try this at home'. Finally, there are so many other great videos out there, many from LP, that this one just doesn't compete.
If you want to learn something about 'pop' percussion, get yourself a copy of Luis Conte's dvd and check out some gigs!",1233964800,,503,4.7272727272727275
