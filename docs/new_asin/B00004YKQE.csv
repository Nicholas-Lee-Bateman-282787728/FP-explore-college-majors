(Although I think the film is a little too mannered and is marred by some poor casting, it would have earned a solid three stars on its own merits.) The picture quality is abysmal, with a plethora of scratches, tears, squiggles, and all the other signs of a bottom-of-the-barrel print used for the digital transfer. The contrast drops almost to nil two-thirds into the film, rendering Welles' rich blacks into a uniformly soupy grey. Several scenes in outdoor locations look horribly overexposed, resulting in a bleached white frame that is almost physically painful to watch.  The audio track is just as bad, with crackles and a constant hiss making it difficult to understand the dialogue. (The absence of a subtitle track makes this even worse!) The only ""extras"" are a trailer for CITIZEN KANE and an utterly extraneous intro by Tony Curtis (who mispronounces ""Arkadin"" and continues his creepy habit of wearing black leather gloves). To top it all off, this is the version that excises almost ALL of Welles' original flashback structure for the film!  Bottom line: Don't buy this.

1375975,2,B00004YKQE,"Warning: the cut of the film on this DVD is so poor, it makes it not worth getting. Criterion put this film out on Laser Disc based on a print made in 1961. That's the one to own.
I lived by Maltin as my bible. And in many cases, that was a very bad choice. Because of his reviews of this and 'Lady from Shanghai' I stayed away from them. When I saw this for the first time I thought I'd lost my mind. This is such a rich, wonderful film. Sure, Welles didn't get to finish editing it, but that doesn't bother me much at all. What is left is still one of the most ambitious and interesting movies of all time. The sheen of it may not match Citizen Kane, but there is much more going on in the film itself. (Perfect explanation of why Americans slighted it and Europeans rightly voted it one of the most important films of all time.)
In a lot of ways, Mr. Arkadin is a recapitulation of the Kane theme, but this time, the truth of the character doesn't elude its pursuers only to be revealed to the viewer (Rosebud), the secret is that there was no secret and the whole tangle just disappears in a puff of smoke. There is so much going on in this film, it takes many viewings just to sort it out. There are also some of the greatest moments of Welles career like his telling of the parable of the scorpion and the frog.

1375976,5,B00004YKQE,"I gave this film 5 stars because first & foremost it's a Welles movie. Which doesn't mean to say it's not a good film. If you are partial to Welles then it's a good film. If you believe that he was the greatest film maker that ever walked the earth, then this could possibly be your favourite. The trouble is, ""Mr. Arkardin"" ,unfortunately, has been mutilated by bad editing. Not unlike many of the films Welles had taken away from him before editing began. Still,it is quite a classic Wellesian artifact,containing hallmark camera angles & positions that are instantly recognisable to the trained Orsonite. Other directors who try, always fail, unable to achieve the same depth of field. Mr Arkadin ~(aka Confidential Report in some countries)~ has a wonderful cast & it's interesting to see Welles venture into the ""Citizen Kane""-type plot once again. The out-of-sync voices will disturb a few viewers, but if so there's still plenty to watch. Interesting to note that Orson's last wife appears as the lead. I would have liked some restoration & care, but I'm still quite happy it's finally on DVD. This ribbon of dreams inspired many great directors of the 70's. I'm sure it will inspire many more.

As the titular character, Orson once again steals the show.
Each version of the film is different than the other in terms of editing, as many scenes are switched around. There are also some scenes in each version that don't appear in one another. This is a really interesting boxed set, as it comes literally packed with the three versions of the film, ample bonus material (including a booklet with very detailed histories of the disagreeing prints featured in the set) and even the novel that is the basis for the film, written by Welles.

1376014,1,B00004YKQE,"There isn't much new that can be said about Orson Welles (1915-85). He created some of the very best theatre, radio, and films in history, and is credited by almost everyone for making the #1 film of all time - ""Citizen Kane"" (1941). But someone along the line, early on, he started having problems with producers and studios, left projects unfinished, went over budget, and a whole host of problems that ultimately resulted in fewer and fewer films of lesser and lesser quality. With the failure of ""The Lady from Shanghai"" (1947) and ""Macbeth"" (1948), Welles' career in the US was virtually finished, and he went to Europe where he was still held in high regard. By 1955, when this film was made, Welles had some modest successes (""The Third Man""), but was relegated to making low budget films and appearing as an actor to finance his various projects.

The film is based on a series of ""Harry Lime"" radio shows (1951-2) produced by Welles from London following the success of ""The Third Man"" (1949) that featured Welles as Harry Lime. Like ""Citizen Kane"" (1941), the film involves an investigator researching the past of a mysterious multi-millionaire by visiting the sites and talking with the people who knew him when.

Robert Arden (1922-2004) plays the smuggler who is hired by Welles to investigate the past he claims he doesn't remember. This was Arden's most significant role in a career that involved some 50+ films between 1944 and 2001. Prior to this Arden had worked with Welles on the ""Harry Lime"" radio series.

Beautiful Patricia Medina (1919) plays Milly, Arden's girlfriend. Medina had a busy career in the 40s and 50s and is best remembered from her roles in films like ""Fortunes of Captain Blood"" (1951), ""Lady in the Iron Mask"" (1952), and ""The Black Knight"" (1954). In 1960 she married Welles' good friend and long time collaborator, Joseph Cotton.

Akim Tamiroff (1899-1972) plays Jakob Zouk, the last man alive who knows Welles' secret past. Tamiroff is best remembered for his role as the Uncle Joe in Orson  Welles' ""Touch of Evil"" (1958) and twice was nominated for Best Supporting Actor (""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" and ""The General Died at Dawn""). He appeared with Welles in 4 films.

Michael Redgrave (1908-85) plays another one of the people that Arden interviews on his quest to uncover Welles' past. Redgrave is probably best known as the father of actresses Lynn and Vanessa, although he had a prodigious career as an actor appearing in more than 50 films between 1938 and 1975. He was nominated for an Oscar (""Mourning Becomes Electra"") and twice for a BAFTA (""Time without Pity"", ""The Night My Number Came Up"").

Mischa Auer (1905-67) plays The Flea Professor. He was nominated for an Oscar for his role in ""My Man Godfrey"" (1936), one of more than 100+ films he made, often playing a foreigner in films like ""Clive of India"" (1935) and ""Anna Karenina"" (1935). I liked him best as the ballet teacher from ""You Can't Take it With You"" (1938) and the cowboy in ""Destry Rides Again"" (1939).

The top films for 1955 were  ""Lady and the Tramp"", ""Mister  Roberts"", Guys and Dolls"", ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and ""Picnic"". The Oscars went to ""Marty"" (Picture, Director, Actor), ""Mister Roberts"" (Supporting Actor), ""East of Eden"" (Supporting Actress), and ""The Rose Tatoo"" (Actress). Other notable films released that year were ""The 7 Year Itch"", ""Blackboard Jungle"", ""Lady and the Tramp"", ""Oklahoma"", ""To Catch a Thief"" and ""The Virgin Queen"".

The NY Times called the film - ""in turn, baffling, exciting, infuriating, original and obscure. It is also, from start to finish, the work of a man with an unmistakable genius for the film medium."" OTOH they said - ""His ambiguous cutting techniques and piercing sound track are so unconventional that they operate as constant distractions to an attentive observer."" Their conclusion - ""...Arkadin is less a performance than a presence, and, on screen or off, it overwhelms a film, which, for all its strangeness, is seldom less than brilliant.""

No film director was better than Welles in exploring the corrupting side of power and for expressing the longing for innocence, which can never be achieved. Hence his obsession with the past and sending the innocent into the labyrinth. The themes of self-deception and betrayal are always on Welles' mind and are present here too. But the film is so deeply flawed, perhaps it is the better judgment to save one's energies for a more substantial approach.

FWIW - I think I figured out why Welles used Arden, who does a terrible acting job, and why the film is as bad as it is. Arden worked on the radio show, and if you close your eyes and listen to the movie, you'll find hidden herein a great radio show. IOW Welles put some figures up on the screen to illustrate his marvelous radio show. Listening to this way the film is a real treat, but...

Bottom line - deeply flawed Welles film with no redeeming qualities. Of interest only to rapid fans of Welles.",1312934400,4,4976,4.8182883939038685
1376015,5,B00004YKQE,"Re: The Corinth Version

Upon beginning Welles' epic Inception-esque neo-noir of a power-hungry man using the dredges of the world as his puppets, the average cinemaphile may become disillusioned.  The opening scene of a frantic man trying to explain his desire to save what is obviously a sick ex-con in a dilapidated old warehouse could confuse and bewilder even the most refreshed viewer.  Couple this with the faulty audio synch queued by either Welles or years of mismatched ""true"" versions, and within the first ten minutes the gumption of linear creativity begins to dwindle in the air.  Is this the epic like the overhyped Citizen Kane or unheard The Magnificent Ambersons, or merely another ambitious, yet faulty Girl from Shanghai?  Oddly, Mr. Arkadin falls somewhere near the top (albeit standing closer to Ambersons instead of Kane).  What slowly begins as shoddy workmanship, delightfully transforms into a darker, brooding slice of cinema that combines the horror of crime, the power of family, the depth of detailed storytelling, and how the culture of a being, destined to be that being, will never change.

Welles steps to the plate after the disastrous opening by providing viewers the opportunity to see a flashback within a flashback.  This is important to mention not merely because of the seemingly creative dream-within-a-dream of Nolan's Inception, but because it provides the overall tone of the film.  A man runs toward the screen, a knife firmly in his back, a simple whisper, a name - Arkadin - and the sinister path of our unfortunate anti-hero is marked.  Guy van Stratten (Robert Arden) a two-bit petty criminal who cannot shake the name whispered; follows the disheveled path of locating the myth of Arkadin.  His journey walks him directly into Hell itself which is full of crazy Klux'ers, a party full of Goya masks, Neptune, a bout of amnesia, and characters aplenty that are just as devoid of morals as our lead, Mr. Gregory Arkadin.  This is where our tone is demonstrated.  The dark shadows, the unredeemable characters, the unsettling cinematography, all build the walls around Welles' unexplained labyrinth.  It is a film where the audience is given no choice but to root for the lesser of two evils; to say ""that is the villain I want to win"".  This is not an unfamiliar concept to Welles, especially when you look at Citizen Kane, Magnificent Ambersons, or even Girl from Shanghai, in which our central characters are considerably flawed and morally unjust, while their surrounding world reflects that.  In Kane (which, looking back, feels like a Bizzaro version of Mr. Arkadin), we have a power hungry individual attempting to make sense of his life, his power, and his wealth; while in Arkadin we have that same question but instead of following Welles' Kane, we follow van Stratten as he further destroys the myth of his employer.  It is one of those rare occasions where suspicion surrounds Mr. Arkadin from the beginning and as the film continues it further darkens and grows more malicious.  Yet, when the blanket is revealed, Arkadin shows his emotion - this film suddenly changes again.  That is the pleasure of watching Mr. Arkadin, easily before our eyes it transforms from a classic who-dun-it, to a crime story, all the way to a family drama, all with one of our main characters shrouded in a secret Welles refuses to reveal.

Yet, within this secrecy, we have one character that remains relatively pure, and ultimately becomes the crux of this film.  Paola Mori plays Arkadin's daughter Raina, the apple of both Welles and van Stratten's eye, and subsequently the only character to wear white in this entire film.  This builds an interesting dynamic between our two villains as they both keep truths away from her, as if they know the darkness that surrounds their world.  As the symbolic bomb in this ""Spy vs. Spy"" storyline, Raina is the ultimate pawn, never quite choosing one side over the other, until the race-against-time airplane ending.  What makes Arkadin more than just your simple twist at the end is Welles giving the final power to this innocent character.  Raina, needing to trust her father or a man she has given her heart to, ultimately makes the decision that Stratten desires, making him victorious at the end, and the penultimate bad guy.  Opening the door once again to the offered thought, ""knowing a scorpion is a scorpion, why would you be surprised when he stings you""?  One should further wonder then, upon a second viewing, who was the self-proclaimed mad genius of this film?  Welles played the part, but did Stratten know what he was doing all along?  Is he the scorpion in Welles' story?  Was this final act of aggression the final step in his master plan?  Did Arkadin, originally titled Confidential Report, dupe us as well?  Reviewing the tapes, one must question who was the central focus of this film?  Was Stratten smarter than Arkadin?

One of my favorite quotes about this film comes from the final lines from an essay by J. Hoberman in which he states, ""...described Citizen Kane as a labyrinth without a center. Mr. Arkadin does have a center. It's a maze designed by the Minotaur.""  Arkadin is a fully developed maze, complete with trap doors (the Baroness), hidden passages (Redgrave), and quizzical stops (i.e. the flea trainer - my FAVORITE part of this darkness), and finally the big question at the end; follow two wrong paths or do nothing at all?  It is Welles' best maze he has created yet, and while there is no mirrored justice (see end of Shanghai), the craft of storytelling has never been better.  Intertwining Greek mythology with fables and even a spice of fairy tales, Arkadin doesn't give an itinerary or a final destination.  The beginning of Arkadin, gives us no indication of what is about to happen, Welles easily allows us to get lost in his maze, without offering anything looking like a map.  While campy, one cannot help but compliment the hopes that Welles had with this seemingly unfinished project.  Scenes were out of place, props were obviously half-built, and voices never matched, but the vision was there.  The choice of placing cameras on the ground to give Arkadin a bigger stature, almost superhuman qualities, was brilliant.  The joyous nature of the score matched with a destroyed background complimented each other perfectly, giving us glossy exterior to accompany our moldy interior.  The dizziness while watching the scene of Arkadin interrogating Stratten's drunken female partner felt realistic and sociopathic at the same time.  The hallucinogenic haze of either insanity or inebriation is exactly what Welles wanted to accomplish, and if this ""Corinth"" version is merely 1/3 of our director's final thought, then Mr. Arkadin has every possibility of being Orson Welles' magnum opus.",1296000000,2,6824,4.979717813051146
1376016,4,B00004YKQE,"A film typical of 1955, the very heart of the Cold War. Orson Welles though manages to write a book and then make a film that exposes one of these rich men after WW2 who made a fortune during and after the war, and yet he succeeds in hardly mentioning the defeated side of that war who were the main customers and who knows what too of these men who came rich out of the war. We jump from Italy, to Spain, from Germany to England, from France to Poland and we only know that fishy people were used to accumulate that fortune and were eliminated for the police not to trace them to the order giver.

After the war that Mr. Arkadin hires some kind of international private eye adventurer to find out what is being said about him in Europe. His real intention is to trace those who could be embarrassing if they started talking and then he eliminates them one after the other. The private eye has only one objective: to capture the love of the daughter of this rich man. Not simple, indeed.

And the end is just fishy and unimaginable. The rotten rich man disappears in thin air over the communication system of an airport air control tower: he is speaking one second and he is gone the next and the plane he was coming in crashes and no body is in it. The private eye can go away with the rich daughter but does it mean it is finished. Of course not. These war time entrepreneurs are extremely good at disappearing to reappear later on with a good amount of money they had manage to store away in some Swiss safe heaven.

The film is more disturbing than really thrilling and Orson Welles probably wanted it like that, mysterious, embarrassing and disquieting, but what's the next stop in the plot, sir?

It's no secret this movie has a very checkered history, and Welles himself was highly disappointed with it. There are 3 different edits of this (all included in the collection) so armchair scholars can doubtless spend time comparing and contrasting them... but to be honest the movie itself is not interesting enough to merit it. The story is so-so, and one of the weakest aspects was Orson himself. He looks terrible in this, with the ridiculous beard and wig, and what I can only hope was an attempt at a Hungarian accent.

On the plus side, the film has a few diamonds in its rough, ""Orson moments"" where his brilliance as a director shine through.

1376038,5,B00004YKQE,"First, I would like to express my appreciation for the review by Felix Felicis (Apr. 20 2006) which I thought was extremely helpful and interesting and wise.  The reason I am adding my own review is to emphasize the wondrous acting interludes in this movie.  Mr. Welles, of course, is always hypnotic, I can never take my eyes off him in any movie in which he appears (or waddles).  The two American leads, Robert Arden and Patricia Medina, are of course hilariously bad, as has been mentioned ad infinitum ad nauseam.  Imagine Robert Mitchum and Marilyn Monroe (or Jayne Mansfield, or maybe Brigitte Bardot), and as Raina, think of Natalie Wood.  Oh well.  Never mind them.  The four reasons Mr. Arkadin is marvelous are:

1.  Akim Tamiroff in his sad, pathetic, enormously brave and heartbreaking portrayal of the indignities of old age and poverty.  At one point he pleads to be allowed to put on his trousers (to cover up his soiled underwear?).  I have a feeling that was an improvised line.

2.  Mischa Auer and the flea circus.  It is not just the human actor but the insect performers who made my jaw drop as I stared obsessively at the screen in this unbelievable gothic and unforgettable cameo.

3.  Michael Redgrave.  I have seen Michael Redgrave in many British films of the 1940's, but I did not recognize him as the weird Hitchcockian antiques dealer.  THAT WAS MICHAEL REDGRAVE??? I thought reading the credits.  I can watch this scene over and over again and never get tired of it.

4.  Last -- the most incredible and most marvelous Katina Paxinou.  If the movie contained nothing else but Katina Paxinou as Sophia, it would rate five stars.  Six stars.  Maybe ten stars.

Of course there are other things in Mr. Arkadin.  The penitentes.  The masquerade ball.  The German street (reminiscent of The Third Man's Vienna).  The tale of the scorpion and the frog.  (Which one is Arkadin?  Maybe he's both.  Maybe he's Aristotle Onassis.  Who cares.  Watch the movie.)",1256428800,5,1981,4.7463126843657815

Indeed, I was satisfied. What an excellent story from writing, to directing, to acting (editing I cant speak for having only watched 1 version of the 3) but in version 3, aka "" The Comprehensive Version"", it was obvious the very good job of telling a complex story). The dialogue alone made me clap. If you have been eyeballing this movie, do not hesitate to watch it by all means.  I rented the 3rd disc alone and if I should find this 3 disc set come down to the `'teen'' price range, then I will purchase it gladly (I refuse to pay over 18 for any DVD in any format, just a personal thing). Until then, I wait and I toast to ""character"" ...watch the move then reread. If you like Orson Wells, you'll love this movie. If you weren't sure about him before, you will probably rent more of his movies and may just come away naming him as great after all. What writer/director /actor nowadays can really compare to his triple threat? Also, his classical training shines in this movie as found in the subtext, acting, and dialogue.

UPDATE: I have now seen version 3, aka ""Comprehensive Version""; not good at all. Right off of the bat, he characters were introduced to quickly and some not at all.

1376040,4,B00004YKQE,"This film may be the most intrinsically Wellesian of all his works, combining the story unspooling of Citizen Kane, the post-war shadiness of The Stranger and The Third Man, the visual oddities of The Lady From Shanghai- starting with the pilotless airplane that opens the film, the soliloquizing of his Shakespearean films, the later ruthless characterizations of Touch Of Evil, and the decayed world feel of The Trial, which- like this film- also combines scenes shot in different countries for an oddly geo-disorienting feel. While the pseudo-intellectual French cinema magazine Cahiers Du Cinema called Mr. Arkadin (actually Confidential Report- the worst of the three in this set) Welles' best film, and one of the top ten ever made, it is not close to being that, for their choice was as politically motivated as the opinions of those critics who have derided Welles as a failure.

  Yet, it's a damned good film, and, especially the Comprehensive version can make claims to greatness, with a very modern look and sensibility to it that makes it all the more galling that Hollywood has never once come up with something as daring as this. Perhaps the recent crime noir film Memento comes close, but that film is internally complex, whereas Mr. Arkadin's complexities are externally complex and fractal. The influence of this film on French filmmakers of the New Wave, but even on directors like Michelangelo Antonioni and Ingmar Bergman, in their chronologically challenging films of the 1960s, is immense and manifest. Mr. Arkadin is not only a palimpsest within itself, but in its exterior making and history. This package, and the Comprehensive version, do an excellent job in decoding that all. But, this film is not, as critic J. Hoberman claims in the booklet, a Jorge Luis Borgesian film, for there is rationality, realism, resolution, and character development in this film. It is not wan, nor failed, Surrealism-cum-Magical Realism. It is one of the highest manifestations of film noir and pulp fiction, and as such, has been rendered a great service in this explication of its meaning and roots by The Criterion Collection. See this film, and see a world that did exist after the Second World War, both in reality, and in the minds of those whose warp of it is remembered even more keenly. Yet, the greatest thing about it, as with all art than can be called great, is that for all it gives, its best secrets still remain.",1221350400,3,2438,4.9559902200489

To understand Mr. Arkadin I think you have to understand where it fits into the trajectory of Welles' career. Chronologically, Arkadin comes after two very impressive Shakespearean productions, Macbeth & Othello, and before his noir masterpiece, Touch of Evil. Arkadin is wedged between and borrows from two distinct genres: it is both an extravagant piece of theatre that seems to be suspended in time and a gritty noir very much situated in the post-WWII Europe where Welles lived and worked and struggled to finance this film. It is not so much a seamless hybrid as it is a lurid oddity made on the cheap, an amalgam of mismatched and perhaps incompatible parts, but of course this is part of its charm (only great artists indulge in follies of this magnitude). The imperfectly wedded seams between the two genres, Welles' dimestore wardrobe and make-up, the papier mache costumes, and the uneven performances and acting styles (ranging from the inspired to the incompetent) make this seem like a woefully underfinanced and mismanaged affair. While watching this you feel like you are on a movie set and Welles cannot make up his mind which of two films he wants to make: another Shakespeare film or a film noir. The end product is that there is no end product, just a set of mismatched parts that do not go together however you edit them.

Welles plays war profiteer Gregory Arkadin, the archetypal self-crafted man, who has either disowned his past or literally forgotten what that past was. Arkadin is either wittingly living a grand illusion of his own manufacture or he has unwittingly lost touch with his authentic self or perhaps a bit of both. Since Arkadin's entire existence is predicated upon his ability to manufacture confidence, it is unclear even to him whether he can be said to have a true self. No one is exactly certain who Arkadin really is. He lives in a castle amidst a swirl of rumor and myth, much of it put into circulation and perpetuated by Arkadin himself. His parties are lavishly produced affairs where he tells outlandish stories. He is the ultimate celebrity subsisting on an abundance of life-generating charsima. The one thing that eludes him is that lost or misplaced authenticity. Welles plays this tragi-comic-absurdist part brilliantly. He looks like a king from a Greek tragedy or Shakespeare or from the pen of a surrealist playwrite. Welles makes no attempt to make the Spanish castle that Arkadin occupies look real. It is supposed to look like a stage to emphasize that Arkadin is merely an actor/director  producing and staging a version of himself for the public to consume. Welles' inventiveness as a director and actor are both harnessed to great effect. Like so many of the great kings of Greek and Shakespearean tragedy, this one has a wayward daughter whose failure to comply with her father's wishes leads to tragedy but only indirectly so. Like Lear, this king's downfall is brought about not by an external cause, but by profound internal uncertainty.

It is unclear whether Welles intentionally deflates the tragic narrative of Mr. Arkadin with the comic narrative of Guy von Stratten (Robert Arden) and fellow grifter and sometimes squeeze Mily (Patricia Medina) or whether this deflation is merely an unintended effect of a frugal budget which made certain casting choices necessary. These two low-lifes look, talk, and act like stock pulp fiction characters straight off an American film noir soundstage. Intentional or no, the actors playing these two grifters are no great shakes and the fact that these two Actors Studio rejects occupy the screen with Welles' creates a strangely  disorientating feeling that some grevious error has been made. But we have no choice but to go with it and to try and figure out what Welles is doing or attempting to do. If we give Welles the benefit of the doubt, it would seem that he intentionally cast two second-rate actors in order to emphasize the inadequacy of the characters that they are playing. Real actors with real talent seem to exude confidence even when they are playing helpless characters, but bad actors truly seem helpless and powerless. Maybe this had something to do with Welles' casting choices.

In any event, the underconceived and underbudgeted Guy and Mily narrative intersects with the overwrought Arkadin narrative. Just by chance Guy hears Arkadin's name while doing a stretch of time in prison, and, again by chance, he hears more information about Arkadin when one of his smuggling operations is momentarily interrupted by a man with a knife in his back who stumbles and falls on the dock near his boat. Dead men might tell no tales but dying ones surely do, and, before expiring once and for all, this one (for some inexplicable reason) whispers to Guy information that he claims Arkadin wants kept secret. So like any good grifter Guy decides to see how much Arkadin is willing to pay to keep it secret. To get to Arkadin he heads to Spain and befriends Arkadin's daughter Raina (Paolo Mori). Raina recognizes Guy for the grifter that he is but she enjoys playing with him because hes such a sap and she knows it irks her daddy to have him around. Arkadin knows only one thing is more alluring to a mug like Guy than a pretty dame and thats money so Arkadin gets rid of him by sending him off on a paid holiday/odyssey to solve a riddle that he suspects has no solution. Affecting amnesia, Arkadin hires Guy to find out who Arkadin is. Guy is suspicious but takes the bait anyway. Much of the film is thus spent following Guy as he chases one lead after another from Berlin to South America and back to Spain. In the process Guy meets a rogues gallery of Arkadin's old acquaintances (played by actors far superior to Robert Arden: ie Welles' staple Akim Tamiroff and Michael Redgrave). But Guy begins to suspect that Arkadin is playing with him and that Arkadin is conducting a parallel investigation of his own. And Guy is right. We find that Arkadin genuinely wants to find out which of his old acquaintances are still alive and if all of the facts that can be compiled about his life add up to anything. The plot is no more farfetched than was the plot of Citizen Kane which it resembles, the problem is in the execution. To pull off this intricate narrative puzzle requires the same deft display of technical and narrative skill that was employed on Kane, but clearly Welles does not have the resources here to accomplish what he sets out to do. Without his troupe of actors, without the backing and resources of a Hollywood studio, without a staff of expert technicians, and without financing Welles could not quite pull this one off.

Granted, the Wellesian brilliance is there in fits and starts. Its there in the brilliantly conceived Gregory Arkadin who is both a classic theatrical archetype and an updated existential version of that archetype, (ie he is the penultimate man without qualities or man without a center that Welles is so fond of). The brilliance is there in Welles genre-bending & genre-blending sense of narrative play (in the attempted wedding of the stagey theatrical craftiness that he mastered early in his radio career and the gritty noir that came to be his signature style), and it is there in the wily sophistication of the editing that makes each frame and sequence of a Welles film such a singular experience. Unfortunately, the brilliant pieces do not quite collude into a coherent whole and so the film is best appreciated for the brilliance of (some of) its unfinished and mismatched parts.

My favorite Welles films are the ones he made before this one (Citizen Kane & Maginificent Ambersons & Journey Into Fear & The Stranger & Lady from Shanghai & Macbeth & Othello) and the ones that he made after this one (Touch of Evil & The Trial & Falstaff & F for Fake). But Arkadin is an essential Welles film for those looking to trace the evolution of the Welles' style and vision. Sometimes an imperfect film tells us just as much about an artist as a perfect one does. This film is a goldmine for Welles scholars and for pro and semi-pro film buffs. For the general viewer this film is not as essential as the other eleven films in the Welles oeuvre.",1221004800,6,8458,4.796296296296297
1376042,3,B00004YKQE,"Mr Arkadin was a bad film. As with every mistake that Wells made, his apologists have held that it is a great film ruined by the usual ""evil"" producers who took it out of the man's hands and recut it. The idea is always that Wells created ""greatness"" in editing. But contrary to all the presentation in this excellent collection, no amount of editing could have improved Mr. Arkadin.

The story is a lame rather obvious remix of elements from ""Kane"" and ""the third man"". But the Kane-style flashbacks fail because they do nothing but reveal that the ogerish title character is indeed an ogre. The third man elements end up going wrong in every way the third man got right. The lead american character is a tired 1950s archtype complete with a rotten stereotypical accent with his (used and) dead girlfriend dragged along.

The film really can't be saved because no amount of artful direction or editing can make up for a total lack of a story and wooden one-dimensional lead. There are nice flashes in some scenes, but not enough to make a film.

But as film history, this criterion edition is outstanding. Multiple versions of the film are presented to show the different choices made in its construction and its evolution (or devolution). The mini-documentaries on the project of recontructing the film are actually far more interesting than the film itself. There is also a great deal of historical material about this stage of Wells career. I don't know that the actual film was worth all the effort, but what can be said is that the overall package clears up a great deal of mythology associated with the film.

Bad film, but very interesting as a document covering film history.",1219104000,4,1684,4.737201365187714
1376043,3,B00004YKQE,"MR. ARKADIN (aka ""Confidential Report"") is now advertised as a forgotten Orson Welles classic. In all probability this movie in first run was rightly dismissed as a mediocrity. The script is by turn confused and transparently predictable. Welles as the main character mugs for a tilted camera to the point of annoyance and his direction is heavy handed: the overuse of skewed horizons, bizarre camera angles, cluttered sets and jarring edits do nothing but distract the viewer. Peripheral eccentrics pass through the story as rapidly as the blurry panning used in one scene.

(*Plot spoilers follow*)

The wealthy Mr. A. (estimated worth: 100 million dollars) feigns amnesia and sends a would-be blackmailer (Guy Van Stratten) on a worldwide search for answers to his ""mysterious"" past-- the true motive is to prevent his daughter (Raina) from learning that her father was once a lowlife gangster. Arkadin secretly tails his hired investigator and disposes of old acquaintances as each is discovered. (Note that none of these killings is ever shown.) Once the last link to his past is destroyed, Arkadin intends to either frame Van Stratten for the several murders or kill him. Realizing this, the frightened man flees to Spain and the arms of waiting Raina, where he believes he will be safe. Arkadin follows by piloting his small plane in a race to beat Van Stratten to Raina. In a desperate radio conversation with his daughter, Arkadin is misled into believing she knows ""everything,"" so he apparently throws himself from the airplane (again this is implied).

1376045,3,B00004YKQE,"This lavish DVD offers a detailed presentation of a film that in each of its various versions is nearly unwatchable.

It's hard not to suspect that a jealous Welles, who is given credit by some for the look and writing of The Third Man, tried to best the success of that picture by cobbling together scripts from the Harry Lime spin-off radio show and dressing them up in a Kane like framework.  And there are some impressive shots and scenes here.  But, save for a couple of cameos and Billie Whitlaw's voicing of the ingenue, the movie's also uniformly badly acted.  And that includes Welles and particularly the disastrously miscast lead, Michael Arden.  Perhaps a version that Welles edited himself may have worked, but I'm dubious as so much of what's here is downright sloppy.  For instance, the voice over that opens the film says that the plane found flying empty was the result of a murder, which it isn't.  And it makes absolutely no sense that Guy in his life or death position at the start of the film would stop and recount the action thus far to Zouk who is plainly deranged.  (We're told that this was an inspiration of Welles on the set and if so it's not a very logical one and makes the charater of Guy seem like a bigger moron than is plausible.)  It's also not clear why, if the film was taken away from Welles and edited by others after he'd worked on only the first few scenes, so many of the characters throughout the whole picture are voiced by Welles.

The DVD has good stuff, like MP3s of the Lime radio shows, a chat with the great Simon Callow and a very good dual comentary.  Curiously, the most entertaining feature included here is the film's novelization credited to Welles.  This version at least provides motivation -- and wit -- for the charter of Van Stratten, as well as some pulpy fun.

All told, Criterion provides a feast for Welles apologists.",1195948800,6,1884,4.538461538461538

Still, I'm rathere severe in my judgements of movies, and can only give it a ""C""-rating. On the other hand, the extras in this set are so large that I give them a ""A"", making the whole package a ""B"". The characters are strongly drawn; the direction and photograhpy are excellent.

But the new comprehensive version included in this set is as close as we can get to Orson's wishes, and the film is superb. It's a fun and playful tale, with Welles almost winking at the camera as Arkadin. All the trademark Welles shots are here, including a quite effective shot on a rocking ship on the sea which really gives you a feeling of seasickness.

1376080,4,B00004YKQE,"This movie goes by two names, Mr. Arkadin and Confidential Report, and no one can really say with any finality which is the definitive title.

This is exactly what you might expect from a film that has more versions than you can shake a stick at. So many, in fact, that again there is no one of them that is truely conclusive.

So if you were hoping for Criterion to batten down the hatches on the ""best"" or even ""ultimate"" Arkadin you're right out of luck. If anything, this set contributes fuel to the fire.

Arkadin was another film that Welles made over years as he chased funding literally around the globe. That it's a pretty good film is testament to his ability as a filmmaker.

As you probably know Arkadin is often described as a kind of pale imitation of Citizen Kane, and there are superficial similarities. However, there were enough differences for me to regard the film as a seperate and worthy effort. It is much more in the noir tradition of Lady From Shanghai and Touch Of Evil and it has a bizzare cinematography all its own. (Which, apparently, is the result of extensive re-editing by a producer to make the film easier to understand).

-An aside- Does re-editing to ""improve"" a film EVER work? Why do they bother?

I enjoyed the movie, it's not my favorite Welles, but it was more entertaining than, though just as editorially complex as, F For Fake.

I have to admit, I've not watched every version Criterion has presented me with. It's difficult to watch a film, then watch a slightly different version, then another slightly different version. My hat is off though, to Criterion, for delivering the goods. The booklet that goes along (the one that describes the films many many many many many versions) is as detailed as we have come to expect from this company and the transfers are good.

The enclosed novel of the film is credited to Welles, though the booklet says he claimed not to have written so much as a word. In fact, the authorship of this novel is as much a mystery as the umpteen jillion different renditions of the film.",1162684800,7,2059,4.576086956521739
1376081,4,B00004YKQE,"Mr Arkadin, aka Confidential Report - or, to give it its rather wonderful German title, Mr Satan in Person - is certainly one of the most problematic of Awesome's films, with a lot of money obviously spent on screen in all the location-hopping, but far too little in post-production (the lip-synching is truly atrocious throughout thanks to constant script changes). It also boasts every conceivable manner of (often wildly incompatible) performance from its interesting cast - Robert Arden gives possibly the loudest performance in a leading role until Al Pacino started making movies, Welles towers and glowers behind one of cinema's worst wig, beard and putty nose ensembles, Patricia Medina is almost endearing in her total lack of ability, Michael Redgrave hams it up outrageously while the likes of Katina Paxinou and Suzanne Flon tone it down and Akim Tamiroff steals every scene going. The first third is awkward in each of the three versions on Criterion's excellent DVD, but it gradually exerts a grip, filled throughout with Welles' trademarks, from the almost omnipresent ceilings in shots to the director conspicuously dubbing bit players (everyone from Gregoire Aslan's dying blackmailer to Mischa Auer's flea circus impresario).

Most of the changes in the `comprehensive version' make sense, even if after seeing the other two versions it is jarring to see the visit to Sophie come after Arkadin's appearance in Mexico (which does explain why Van Stratten didn't tell him that Sophie didn't care). However, the opening doesn't flow quite as well once Arden's introductory screen credit that flows right into his arrival at Zouk's garret is put at the end of the picture. The film never quite lives up to its premise, but as ever with Welles, it's an engaging mess.

With an excellent and intelligent selection of extras (including what may well be Harry Alan Towers only appearance on a Criterion DVD!), this comes highly recommended.",1152144000,13,1950,5.167721518987341
1376082,4,B00004YKQE,"If you are scrolling through the Customer Reviews on this page, please give short shrift to the mean-spirited and childishly vindictive ""reviews"" by two particular contributors with strangely similar low opinions about Orson Welles and this work. In quick response to their rants, Criterion have reissued a number of films that are far from being masterpieces (Michael Bay's 'Armageddon' anyone?) and while 'Mr. Arkadin' is not one of Welles' greatest films, it is undoubtedly fascinating and the story of its making and reconstruction is highly worthy of the effort expended and fully merits inclusion in the collection. Let's not forget that Welles was one of cinema's greatest innovators and his extraordinary contribution to furthering the art of cinema is unarguable.

Essentially, 'Mr. Arkadin' is Welles' attempt to elevate Pulp into Myth. Based on ""a lot of bad radio scripts"" (in Welles' words) written for the Harry Lime radio shows, one could also read it as a more personal attempt to free himself from the shackles of 'Citizen Kane' (with which it has numerous parallels) and be reborn as a European filmmaker. The fact that, again, Welles was restricted by budget and eventually dismissed from the editing room due to the commercial concerns of his producer Louis Dolivet does not diminish what is still a highly intriguing work. In fact, 'Mr. Arkadin' has become something of an enigma unto itself and the story of it's creation and subsequent undoing is as fascinating as the film itself.

In terms of this set, Criterion has done a wonderful job of collating all the available edits (including two Spanish versions which are known, hilariously, by the unexplained mis-crediting of the lead actor!?) and working them into a 'final' version hinted at by Welles' notes and conversations with the ubiquitous Peter Bogdanovich (who also features in the documentary, unsurprisingly). This 'final' version, while far from perfect, restores the original flashback structure as well as the original beginning and ending sequences. On the first disc, however, is the 'Corinth' version (originally discovered by Bogdanovich) that already incorporates some of the author's original intentions. This particular edit also features a highly illuminating commentary track by Welles scholars Jonathan Rosenbaum and James Naremore who consider this version to be the most satisfying. Also included are mp3 files of the three Harry Lime radio plays that had a direct influence on the story, featurettes by Welles biographer and actor Simon Callow, and a highly welcome reprint of the Mr. Arkadin novel/novelisation (you decide) with an excellent newly commissioned introduction by Robert Polito.

His directorial flourishes are definitely evident, but it is hard to really enjoy the film do to the quality of the transfer.  The picture is dark and the audio is exceptionally bad.  It looks like there were some budgetary issues in the making of the film so I couldn't tell whether this was a bad DVD presentation of a mediocre film, or an awful movie put on DVD badly.

1376084,5,B00004YKQE,"Had Orson Welles lived in this era of filmmaking, his life would have been a happier one. Nowadays, every untalented hack gets an ""a film by"" credit on his latest wannabe blockbuster, and kids fresh from film school are granted a right of final cut as a given. Not so before Orson -- he blazed the trail for American film that put so much control in the hands of lesser makers after he fought (and lost) the battles over creative control that they are the beneficiaries of.

Welles' outsize brilliance, prickly and quirky personality and ultimately quite tragic view of human behavior made him a difficult director for studios to work with, and a troubling filmmaker for audiences to love.

If interviews he gave later can be trusted, this complex and dense reworking of both the structure of ""Citzen Kane"" and the postwar cynicism of ""The Third Man"" was Welles' idea of a ""commercial"" movie. But ""Mr. Arkadin"" is nothing of the kind. It's a complex, flawed, ravishingly visual cross between a noir potboiler and a Fellinian assault on high society, an incomplete and blurred treasure map to the buried bones and grinning skull that Welles believed lay beneath any great international fortune.

Criterion is to be saluted for not only assembling what is easily the best and most coherent continuity of this notoriously truncated and mutilated work, but for also respecting cinematic history enough to include the two most widely circulated previous editions of the film.

As in Welles' visually stunning re-interpretation of Kafka's ""The Trial,"" there is a great deal of talent on display here, and much for the Wellesian scholar to admire. Even in this definitive edition, ""Mr. Arkadin"" is a flawed, four star film that I've given five stars to as a way of correcting for the bitter Welles haters who have gone out of their way to slag this unique and interesting package and picture.

Here's hoping Universal will follow Criterion's lead and do a deluxe editon of Welles' ""Touch of Evil"" that will not only include the Walter Mirsch recut (now the only version commercially available), but will give us back the earlier (and some would say better and truer) versions of Welles' second best movie too!",1149292800,12,2202,4.892761394101877

1376098,3,B00004YKQE,"""Confidential Report"" was a movie I'd never heard of before but watched because it was a product of Orson Welles.  Even the blindest of Welles aficionados have to acknowledge that our boy has stumbled as much as he has succeeded in the film industry.  I'm not quite sure what category ""Confidential Report"" fits into, however.  It begins with great promise; we see a plane flying pilotless over Europe and are promised the real story behind this story.  As the story unfolds, we can't help but notice that the supporting cast includes some of the best European actors of the day while the star roles are reserved for a couple of nobodies.  Bridging the gap is Boy Wonder himself, Orson Welles, in the title role of Mr. Arkadin.  I realize this picture was made around 50 years ago but surely somebody could have done something with makeup and hair-styling because the facial appearance of Welles's character is a joke.  He is supposedly a recluse but keeps showing up everywhere.  In the meantime, the plot somehow manages to get better as we go along but then it veers back to mediocrity.  Welles shows he can still deliver some impressive lines but his co-stars show that they can't.  The film eventually goes down in flames as a clumsy love story.  Along the way, my ears lit up as I heard Mr. Arkadin tell a story that I heard in ""The Crying Game"" and nowhere else.  That and Welles himself are probably the only two connections to greatness that this film offers.  For the Welles fans there are touches of his brilliance but enough clumsiness to leave you more insulted than disappointed.  However, it doesn't last all that long and, as I mentioned earlier, there are times the plot moves along quite well.",1146614400,18,1711,4.678929765886288
1376099,5,B00004YKQE,"Orson Welles wrote and directed ""Mr. Arkadin"" based on 3 episodes of ""The Lives of Harry Lime"" (1951-1952) radio show, in which Welles starred as antihero adventurer Harry Lime, reprising his role from the 1949 film ""The Third Man"". Guy Van Stratten (Robert Arden) -con artist, ""petty adventurer"", and, according to himself, ""the world's greatest sucker""- was smuggling cigarettes with girlfriend Mily (Patricia Medina) in Naples harbor when a man named Bracco (Gregoire Aslan) was stabbed on the dock. Bracco whispered 2 names to Mily with his dying breath. One name was Gregory Arkadin (Orson Welles), a fabulously wealthy international financier. Thinking that Bracco's dying words might be worth something to Arkadin, Guy tries to ingratiate himself with Arkadin's daughter Raina (Paola Mori), while Mily uses her charms to get close to him. Disapproving of Guy's relationship with Raina and realizing his ambitions, Mr. Arkadin proposes to pay Guy to investigate his past in exchange for Guy abandoning Raina. Arkadin claims to suffer from amnesia, knowing nothing before he found himself in Zurich in 1927 with 200,000 Swiss francs in his pocket. With this information, Guy criss-crosses Europe trying to reconstruct Arkadin's past. (4 stars)

""Mr. Arkadin"" has been called a burlesque and a pastiche of Orson Welles' earlier films. It's not clear whether to take it literally, figuratively, or as satire -although the film's outrightly comic scenes are its best. Robert Arden's performance is often considered the weak spot in the film, because he doesn't make Guy Van Stratten sympathetic. I think Arden portrays Guy's clumsy, obnoxious ambition rather well actually. He's not a sympathetic character, but a junior Mr. Arkadin. There are many wonderful supporting performances. The weakness is Mr. Arkadin himself, who is a caricature rather than a character. Called ""the ogre"" by his daughter and a ""phenomenon of an age of disillusion and crisis"" by his enemies, Mr. Arkadin has a ridiculous appearance and manner, and his actions rarely make sense. A large man with a conspicuously coiffed hair and beard, he is simply absurd. Welles' keen sense of the absurd comes through in canted camera angles and lavish, chaotic art direction. The seemingly modern tale is set before an intriguing medieval backdrop of castles, peasants, and religious ritual. The Goya-inspired masquerade ball adds a touch of grotesque to the already unsettling tone.

Adding to the absurdity, Welles often changed his mind about structure and dialogue, forcing some scenes to be dubbed later. Welles himself dubbed several parts, including Bracco and The Professor. That was probably for technical reasons, but it's unfortunate. Scenes dubbed out of artistic whim are recognizable for speech that doesn't match the actors' lips. Welles lost control of the film in the editing process, as usual, ultimately resulting in several different versions of ""Mr. Arkadin"". Producer Louis Dolivet, a stealthy character himself, took the film away from Welles, because he was editing only 2 minutes of final product per week. Louis Dolivet was a communist who had been Welles' political mentor for a few years in the 1940s. Dolivet later had colorful career as a Soviet  espionage agent, but insofar as ""Mr. Arkadin"" was concerned, he did the capitalist thing and sued Welles.  The Criterion Collection offers 3 versions of the film in this ""The Complete Mr. Arkadin"" set (5 stars). Optional English subtitles are available.

DISC 1: The ""Corinth Version"" (99 minutes), discovered by Peter Bogdanovich in the early 1960s, is thought to be the last extant version to be under Orson Welles' control. Welles stated that the editing within scenes is true to his intentions. This version isn't horrible, bu it cuts to Guy and Zouk in the Berlin apartment repeatedly in such a manner as to disrupt the flow of the film. Arkadin's rendition of the scorpion-crossing-the-river story is the worst that I have seen, and it spoils his entrance. Bonus features on Disc 1: There is a nice audio commentary by Welles scholars Jonathan Rosenbaum and James Naremore. They discuss the film's origins, visual style, themes, performances, and Welles' directing methods. ""The Lives of Harry Lime"" (90 min) includes the 3 radio show episodes (audio) on which the film was based, for play on a computer, DVD or MP3 player. The sound quality is not very good. ""Reviving Harry Lime"" (20 min) is an interview with Harry Alan Towers, who created and produced the radio show. He recalls how Orson Welles came to work on the show, putting the show together, and who may have actually written the 6 episodes credited to Welles, namely Ernest Borneman. There is also a ""Stills Gallery"" of production stills and behind-the-scenes photos.

DISC 2: The ""Confidential Report"" version (98 minutes), or the Louis Dolivet edit, which was released in 1955 in Great Britain. This version has the best picture quality, but it's the worst edit. It assumes that the audience will not be able to follow the story unless it is spelled out. The flashback structure is simplified, which at least eliminates choppiness. But the audience is guided by an overburdened voiceover narration. Extraneous scenes are included, particularly in the first 15 minutes, while more interesting material was cut. The introductions to both women, Mily and Riana, make them out to be weaker characters than they are. The scene on the dock with Bracco is longer, contains more explication, and a different intent. The bonus feature on Disc 2 is ""Men of Mystery"" (25 min), an interview with Welles biographer Simon Callow, who talks about Orson Welles, Louis Dolivet, actor Michael Redgrave, and includes some interview tapes with Robert Arden.

DISC 3: This ""Comprehensive Version"" (105 minutes) has recently been assembled by film historians/archivists Stefan Drossler and Claude Bertemes from 5 different versions of the film based on comments that Welles made in the years following the film's original release. It is an attempt to create a Welles edit, not the best edit. Although we may know Welles' intentions, it is impossible to know what he would have done had he had the footage in front of him. This version is superior to the others, because the elaborate flashback structure has been restored to working order. But it errs on the side of including too much. For example: Additional footage of Guy approaching Zouk's apartment house gives that scene an inappropriately leisurely pace. In one scene, Mily's dialogue is interrupted then resumed, apparently a mistake. A clip of the plane crashing makes little sense, because it is a subjective camera in an empty plane. Bonus features on Disc 3: ""On the Comprehensive Version"" (20 min) in which Drossler, Bertemes, and Peter Bogdanovich explain some of the decisions in the new edit. ""Outtakes and Rushes"" (30 min) are from footage found at the Cinematheque de Luxembourg. ""The Spanish Actresses"" are alternative scenes with the Baroness Nagel (4 min) and Sophie (7 min) shot specially for the Spanish language version with Spanish actresses Amparo Rivelles and Irene Lopez Heredia.",1145923200,116,7151,5.186147186147186
1376100,5,B00004YKQE,"Welles had final cut on several other films after Kane, though he had to leave Hollywood and flee to Europe to regain creative control.  Othello, The Trial, Chimes at Midnight, The Immortal Story, F for Fake, and Filming Othello were all as Welles cut them and were limited only by budget and the availability of actors.  While ""restored"" versions of Othello and Touch of Evil were released in the 1990s, neither was Welles' cut and the merits of each have been hotly debated (I dislike both of them.)

Mr. Arkadin was the only of Welles' European films that was taken away from him (Don Quixote was never finished because Welles never wanted to.)  According to the commentary on this new DVD set, Welles was only completing 2 minutes of editing during post-production on Arkadin per week, so it's not surprising that after 5 weeks producer Louis Dolivet took the film away from him.

What resulted after that was 5 different cuts of the film, 2 in Spanish, 3 in English.  This DVD set offers the best two English versions of the film (one titled Mr. Arkadin, the other called Confidential Report) and a new version reconstructed by Stefan Drossler (of the Munich Film Museum) using all the available footage from the 5 versions and outtakes.  All three versions look and sound fantastic - they've never been available with such superb quality before this release.

Stefan's cut is 6 minutes longer than the others, and was reconstructed following hints Welles gave in interviews about his conception of the film and using the two earliest cuts of the film as a guide (since Welles was still involved on the cutting at that point.)  The result is very impressive, and all three versions of the film have merit and are enjoyable.

The screenplay for the film was cobbled together from several episodes of the radio series The Lives of Harry Lime, in which Welles reprised his character from The Third Man.  It has always been said Welles wrote those radioplays, but one of the new interviews in this DVD set calls even that into question.  As it is, the story and film are sort of a low-budget pastiche of Kane and The Third Man, with Welles playing a billionaire hiding behind poorly applied make-up who employs a boobish petty smuggler to delve into the secrets of his past.

It's a fun film.  Brilliant camera use, a constant in all of Welles' work, some wonderful performances by the guest stars, and in this one some very bombastic performances by the leads.  Don't expect the standards set by Kane - get yourself in an Ed Wood/Mystery Science Theatre 3000 mood and you will delighted and astounded.

The DVD set also includes the novel of Mr. Arkadin, which Welles didn't write.  The screenplay was novellized in French for a newspaper serial and then translated back into English for the novel.  It's not a bad book and offers explications for some things left confusing in the film, though whether it does so in a way Welles would have agreed with is anybody's guess.

Three of the radio episodes upon which the screenplay was based are also included, though they have very poor sound quality and are impossible to understand at points, and it's a shame Criterion didn't locate better copies of them, as great copies do exist.

All that plus several short documentaries, a hefty collection of behind-the-scenes stills, and even outtakes, deleted scenes, rushes, and scenes from the Spanish version featuring different actresses.

An astounding set all-in-all, for Welles' most under-rated film.",1145836800,15,3501,4.840604026845638
1376101,5,B00004YKQE,"Orson Welles was many things - daring, ambitious, brilliant, egomaniacal - but structured was not one of them. When he was merely 21 he was given the keys to RKO and the right to make any film he wished. He made ""Citizen Kane"", not only one of the finest and most important pictures ever but also the subject of much wrangling between himself and William Randolph Hearst, one of the most powerful media tycoons in history. Though the film was released as he intended, Welles paid a heavy price for his hubris - he would never again enjoy that kind of creative control in any of his later films. His next feature, ""The Magnificent Ambersons"", was famously taken from him in editing and cut by nearly an hour, and the remaining nitrate was later destroyed. ""The Stranger"", ""The Trial"", ""Don Quixote"", and ""Touch of Evil"", among several others, suffered the same fate (thankfully ToE was at least later restored to his meticulous specifications). However, no film of Welles suffered as much as ""Mr. Arkadin"", described in his own words as his most butchered movie.

Before I describe the plot of the film or the details of this wonderful Criterion edition, you first must understand what version of the film I am discussing here, and a bit about it's tortured history. ""Mr. Arkadin"" was never completed by Welles or authorized by him in ANY form - so there is not a long-lost Director's Cut of the film or a clear and precise set of instructions by Welles to be carried out to their fullest intent (like the restored version of Touch of Evil, which was based on a 58-page memo that Welles sent Universal). ALL versions of this film were edited after Welles failed to deliver his cut on time - without his direct input. The assembly process is further hurt by the fact that Welles conceived of an intricate flashback structure to tell his tale just before shooting, and shot the film in fragmented form precisely because he would be the only one who could assemble it properly. Additionally, it was shot over a long period of time over several locations and in varying degrees of quality - there are a number of scenes that freely switch between 16mm and 35mm and a lot of unfinished dialogue track timing and several poorly overdubbed segments. There are at least SIX distinct versions of the film and each contains at least one thing that the others do not - the ""Corinth"" version found by Peter Bogdanovich in 1960 (98 minutes with Welles' described flashback struture mostly intact; until now generally considered to be the best representation of ""Mr. Arkadin""), two seperate Spanish-language cuts, an American linear version that is derived from the Corinth cut, the notorious ""Confidential Report"" European cut that was done by Louis Dolivet (95 minutes), and finally for this release we get a brand-new ""comprehensive"" cut of the film done by Stefan Drossler of Fimmuseum Munchen in conjunction with Claude Bertemes. This new 105-minute cut is an attempt to piece together the most complete, coherent and lucid version of the film, using only the most finished shots and Welles' own piecemeal instructions from notes and interviews, and contuity clues from the previous cuts (especially the ""Corinth"", which is the earliest cut) for the footage itself and how it should be properly sequenced. This is by far the BEST cut of ""Mr. Arkadin"" available, in my opinion, and since Criterion was thoughtful enough to include the Corinth and Confidential Report versions in this set, it is easy to compare how much improved the clarity of the story becomes in the comprehensive version, with Welles' intricate flashbacks intact and his unique sense of film grammar plainly evident. If you do by this set I would recommend watching this edit of the film first, and then wading into the earlier cuts. Kudos to Criterion for this magnificent restoration attempt (as usual).

""Mr. Arkadin"" is the story of Gregory Arkadin (Orson Welles), a shadowy figure with enormous resources who built himself up from humble beginnings, but cannot recall any of the details of how his initial fortune came to be. The story is intentionally told in fragments. In the opening shot we see an unknown figure lying dead on a beach. Suddenly, two men are hiding out from the police, one of them is desperate to tell his tale. His name is Guy Van Stratten (Robert Arden), a smuggler who was kind to a dying man in his last moments (he was knifed to death). The man tells Guy and his girlfriend, Mily, the names of two people - Gregory Arkadin and a woman named Sophia - information, he says, that is worth a fortune. Van Stratten, now unemployed with nothing but time on his hands, is curious and decides to search for the elusive Arkadin - in the hopes of blackmailing him. He discovers that Arkadin has a beautiful daughter, Raina, and uses her as a means of entrance into his world. But Arkadin is one step ahead of him; he knows everything there is to know about Guy through his vast network of spies. Eventually, Guy is hired by Arkadin to discover the truth about his life and fortune (and the mysterious Sophia, who's last name no one remembers) because he is an army man and has access to all kinds of confidential information; but Arkadin is merely using Guy as bait - he follows him every step of the way, interviews the same figures that Guy does, and eventually kills each one of them as the story of his life begins to unravel; he is ashamed of his secrets and is driven to protect his daughter's innocence before Van Stratten reaches her and tells her the truth. Soon, only Van Stratten and Arkadin are left, and as Guy races to find Raina in time Arkadin is right on his tail. The conclusion of this excellent thriller is exciting and also very revealing about Arkadin's character, much like the final moments of ""Citizen Kane"". It is a worthy addition to the Welles noir canon alongside ""Touch of Evil"" and ""The Lady From Shanghai"" and others.

Even in mangled form, it is easy to see why the film is so admired. It bears all the hallmarks of Welles' unique visual style - extremely low angle shots at or even below ground level, deep focus all the way from the foreground to the background, long tracking shots, dramatic visual compositions (with a face filling the foreground and a figure far in the background, for example), characters looking directly into the camera from a higher position in order to mythically exaggerate them, etc. and since it is a noir it also features the typical flair in lighting and shadows. Welles, as Arkadin, is often photographed in shadow, silouhette, or even in masks. The story itself is pretty fascinating on a number of levels. For one thing, just about every character is crooked and unlikeable at the start - including both male protagonists. The plot deals with the secrets and possible redemption of such a character, Mr. Arkadin, and only in the ending of the film is he really humanized - this is more than a passing resemblance to the central idea behind ""Citizen Kane"", of course. Also, the dense labyrinthine plot and the atmosphere and realistic sound design (even with a fractured score) contribute quite a bit of atmosphere and thrills to the film. As stated eariler, this amazing Criterion release contains three distinct cuts of the movie and several worthwhile and informative special features - film critic Johnathan Rosenbaum and author James Naremore provide commentary on the Corinth version, there are outtakes of Welles acting and directed from the assembly cut of the rushes, and on the Comprehensive version there is a great 20-minute documentary fully explaining the reasoning behind the new cut and the various differences in the previous versions. There is also a novelization of the story, credited to Welles but in reality a ghost-written translation of a French version of the tale. In addition, all versions have been significantly cleaned up in terms of aural and visual debris and down-converted from a 1.33:1 full frame HD transfer, with the comprehensive cut and the ""Confidential Report"" version being the cleanest. All in all, if you are a fan of Welles and curious about his incomplete works, or you love noir, or even just like film in general and wish to learn from a master, I can't stress how awesome this Criterion Edition of The Complete Mr. Arkadin is. It's a great thriller, visually and thematically impressive, that was never completed  - but this ""best guess"" is probably as close as we'll ever get. And as typical for Criterion, it's pretty damn good.",1145491200,31,8526,4.794017675050986
1376102,5,B00004YKQE,"Orson Welles more than any film director understood that film is a mosaic of tiles, and that it is in the act of piecing them together that a film is made. He also failed to do so about half the time, in part due to his nature, in part due to the nature of the business. He wrote, acted, directed in this manner, creating puzzle pieces much in the way Brian Wilson created ""Smile"" musically, and with similar results on ""Mr. Arkadin"". Wilson finally finished ""Smile"" two years ago; Welles has ""Arkadin"" finished for him with this box set.

Welles deliberately filmed ""Arkadin"" so that only he could fuse the fragments together properly to protect himself from interference. Then the producers took it away from him and over time arranged and released five different versions of it, none of which had the structure or story line Welles intended, one or two of which literally do not make sense. Working that way, juggling it all in his head, Welles did let some balls drop - in particular the opening section seems to have missing shots or even scenes (scenes which appear in the novel version included here, begun by Welles and finished by his secretary). This box set includes the two best previously released versions, both intriguing but flawed, and then a new version crafting together in beautifully remastered image and sound something much closer to what Welles would have done if he could have. It's still rather like the Ancient Roman novel (the first surviving) ""Satyricon"", wonderful large fragments of a great work in ruins. But what ruins. The flea circus scene, Michael Redgrave's pawnbroker, the Christmas orgy, the German ghetto, are all among the best stuff Welles ever filmed. Holes in the plot - holes that could have been explained or worked out but weren't - remain, but if you're interested in Welles you will enjoy the new version a lot.

It would rate a four if not for the extras, which include footage of Welles doing takes as an actor and even better Welles directing the very ordinary actor in the lead (the film would be another level higher with someone like Richard Basehart instead) and his non-actress wife, who plays Arkadin's daughter. Five minutes only, the later is priceless for anyone interested in the craft of acting on film. If you have only seen the English versions, you'll be thrilled with the lost ending, the end credits, whole scenes that were only in the Spanish version. Except for the young leads, the actors are extraordinary. Welles neophytes should start elsewhere, but anyone who has digested ""Citizen Kane"" will find ""Arkadin"" compelling, for all the flaws in makeup, post-dubbing, the music which was written without cue lengths so the audio cuts are clumsy, even the botched initial set-up for the flashback structure ('We're about to be murdered so let me tell you the whole story...').

He hires a man who has been searching for him since he had heard his name from a man who was dieing, to make a report about Mr. Arkadin. Apparently, he had amnesia and forgot what happened to him at a young age. The young man becomes attached to Arkadin's daughter and travels all over the world to find new facts about arkadin's life.

1376106,5,B00004YKQE,"We will probably never know exactly what Orson Welles envisioned Mr. Arkadin to be, but even in its present state, it remains a commandable achievement and one of his most underrated films. His storytelling mastery is evident throughout, both in the sound and images. As in Citizen Kane, the main character's life is gradually explored, but this time it's the subject of the inquiry who started it himself; this brings the film in the territory of initiations and psychoanalysis. Seemingly to uncover his own past, Arkadin sends low-profile hood Guy Van Stratten in a complex initiatic quest, one in which the initiated is mostly lured by money and luxury. Like Kane, Arkadin takes shape mainly via other people's testimonies, and he undergoes his own type of initiation: for the very first time, he is stripped of the masks and disguises he always relied on, and he is scared at the perspective of his private self (his Jungian 'number 2' personality) being discovered by the only person he cares for. Fables are scattered throughout the film, and the movie itself is such a tale, Arkadin acting as its grand, imposing Ogre, a character possessing strange and far-reaching powers. His overbearing abilities are illustrated in various ways, notably through the film's rapidly changing settings (a device also used in The Trial). The work's depth can also be measured by this consideration: Mr. Arkadin's universe is a huge maze in which Arkadin himself is Minos, Dedalus and the Minotaur all at once. This dense, rich and dreamlike film has never really received its due.",1073952000,5,1571,5.022988505747127

I should have buyed Touch of Evil instead. The quality of the picture is laughable, sometimes there are glitches in the sound during scene changes. Judging by the picture and sound quality I would say that they used equipment from the 30's to shoot and edit the movie and that the print used for that transfer was stored in a refrigerator during 45 years. Welles directing work is good but obviously he had to deal with the poor quality of the European movie industry of the 50's. Sometimes the picture shake, during the opening credits the captions are white on a white or gray background so we can't read everything. The editing is very poor, there are too many scene changes. When I bought this DVD I expected to receive the LaserLight version, instead I got a DVD made by Alpha Video. The case cover is different and there is no supplemental material.

1376138,2,B00004YKQE,"This film represents sort of an artistic low point for Welles.  Presumably exhausted by his four-year ordeal of producing ""Othello"" and far removed from his Hollywood glory years, he attempted a comeback with this hodgepodge re-working of the ""Citizen Kane"" theme.  The rich and mysterious Mr. Arkadin hires an investigator to research his past, presumably to keep his secrets away from his enemies.  However, everyone interviewed by the private eye mysteriously dies!  (This idea was realized more effectively in 1987's ""Angel Heart"").  Although this film showcases' Welles unique style far better than, say, ""The Stranger,"" its utter lack of production values make the experience somewhat grueling.  Welles shoots with a manic energy, but fails to reach the giddy heights of ""The Lady from Shanghai"" or the visual eloquence of ""Othello.""  Fortunately, Welles gets some entertaining performances from his supporting cast, particularly Michael Redgrave as an effeminate shopkeeper and the ubiquitous Akim Tamiroff (""Touch of Evil's"" Uncle Joe Grandi) as the kooky Jacob Zouk.
The Laserlight DVD transfer doesn't help matters.  As noted, it's taken from a grainy, choppy, poorly synced public domain print.

1376139,2,B00004YKQE,"Welles gathered up his own money to make this, something of a European ""Citizen Kane."" It's an overblown mess, due probably to the fact that the distributor pulled it out of Welles' hands and butchered it.

The DVD looks exceptionally poor, mastered from terrible source material. But being an independantly financed Welles film, I'll assume there was little better in the way of source material. The distortion of the score is inexscusable, however.

1376140,5,B00004YKQE,"Having now seen all the commercially available versions of Mr. Arkadin/Confidential Report, I have to say that the VHS version from Janus Films/Home Vision Cinema, isbn 0-7800-2063-4, is the only one in which the story makes any real sense. This is the original English language release version, released in Europe in 1955 (a Spanish language version, with some different actors, was released first, in Spain). It is longer than the other versions with many of the holes in continuity filled in with missing footage and dialogue. The image ond sound quality is far above other available versions--beautiful.
This is the one you need to buy. Janus Films releases many films on DVD with Criterion, and I have no idea why they haven't done so with this facsinating film as well.
But, don't buy this expecting to see the ""director's cut.""  Welles never created a final cut. The film was taken from him by his European backers, who had it cut their own way. Reportedly, Welle's version was more like Citizen Kane, with a series of out-of-order flashbacks told through the point of views of different characters. This version is more linear. Peter Bogdonavich wrote that he had seen a copy of the film in the US that restored the flashback format, but that version, if it survived, has not seen a video release.
To confuse the question of ""what was Welle's original vision for Arkadin"" even more, there was also a novel based on Welle's screenplay that came out before the film was completed and a radio play with the same plot years earlier.
In any case, for now, this VHS from Janus is the best way to go (and, unfortuntely, the most expensive).",1037836800,5,1641,4.778169014084507

1376142,3,B00004YKQE,"There is no THE version of this film. Even though many consider the British'European version, ""Confidential Report,"" to be the definative one, that is simply not true. The original release was in Spain with Spanish actors--actors who didn't appear in the English language version--in several key roles.
And, even though it came out years later, Welles has been quoted as liking the American release version, the one on this disc,titled ""Mr. Arkadin"", better (although it was a best fo two evils situation for him).
Welles was never allowed to complete this film. While he was (endlessly) editing, the film was taken from him by his European backers and completed without his participation (he found out the hard way that Hollywood didn't have a monopoly on raping his art). So there is no definitive Welles version.
""Mr. Arkadin"", which we have here on this disc, has a more linear storyline. ""Confidential Report"" (available on a better-quality VHS than this disc) opens with a ""flashback within a flashback"" which was obviously imposed on the piece in postproduction. The dubbing here is not just odd, as it is in all of Welles' European productions, which were filmed silent with all sound added in postproduction. In ""Report"" it is obvious that the actors dubbed in totally different dialoge so that the 2nd flashback would work. Compare the scenes with protagonist VanStratten and crazy old criminal Zouk in ""Report"" with those in ""Arkadin"" and you can tell the Arkadin scenes contain the original dialoge, unaltered. So, despite being a few minutes shorter that the available ""Report"" version, I consider Mr. Arkadin superior in many ways. Too bad it's a crappy print.
In any case, for $5, I think this Arkadin is a good buy, despite the poor picture.
Perhaps Criterion will release a DVD with a 3 major versions: Spanish Arkadin, Confidential Report, and American Arkadin.

Ordinarily I'm not greatly affected by the quality of a DVD, but this one is in such a bad state that I have to comment on it.  Somehow the people at Limelight have managed to recreate exactly the look and feel of a ten-year-old video copy that was recorded off the air.  There are nasty scratches all throughout the film, the picture is fuzzy and there are places where the video disappears for a few frames and is replaced by a red screen.  The sound is extremely poor in places, seems to be very compressed and is a second out of sync with the video for the entirety of the movie.  That last complaint is really inexcusable and greatly affected my enjoyment of the film.  The fast nature of the film and the quickly edited scenes mean that the audio problems jarred much more annoyingly than they would in another movie.  Hopefully someone will release a cleaned up version of this movie in the future; I would definitely be planning on buying that version.
As for the movie itself, I found it to be very interesting.  The audio problems with this DVD meant that some of the dialogue is inaudible even on repeat viewings, but the film is so enthralling that this does not matter too much.  The acting from Orson Welles is wonderful, of course, although some of the other performers are not quite up to his standard.  The direction is great and the fast edits really work in keeping the viewer interested.
All in all, this is a very good film, but if you plan on buying it on DVD I'd wait until some one else (anyone else) releases one.  Also, Tony Curtis' wardrobe in his introductions is really starting to unnerve me.  The black leather gloves are just too much.",993168000,16,1800,4.421212121212121
1376144,2,B00004YKQE,"The first thing I noticed with Arkadin was the similarities with Citizen Kane. Both stories revolve around an aloof wealthy complex figure, both are a character study of one great man. Arkadin, however, doesn't take it's time to tell a clean story.
First, about the DVD. I share the comment with other online reviewers that it's not good. The image has the look like it was mastered from video, and the sound is flat with characteristics of generation loss. The audio is compressed so much, the music, effects, and dialogue often seem to be at the same volume level. This makes the movie irritating and difficult to watch all the way through.
Welles would rather talk about his accomplishments on Arkadin than his other movies. But I'd stick with Kane as his best work. Arakadin's pacing is fast and furious, much like that of radio drama intended to keep the audience interested and excited. It doesn't work in this movie, however. The fast cuts, dutch tilts, and overlapping dialogue drove me batty. This movie most closely resembles bad Italian films from that period.
Arkadin's character, as well, is creepy and unbelievable. I didn't see real depth in the character, as in Kane. Arkadin seemed one-dimensional, lurchy, and uninteresting. Symbols (like the sled in Kane) are replaced with mystery around who Arkadin really is. But who really cares?
For anyone studying Welles and film, this is a movie that you should see. But you probably don't need to watch it more than once.
Tony Curtis, looking really creepy and donning strange black gloves, stumbles through an introduction of this DVD speaking mostly of Welle's life and times. He is right, in his half-drunk commentary, Welles was a shooting star that rose to stardom and faded away through the rest of his career.",992476800,,1777,4.906976744186046
1376145,1,B00004YKQE,"Okay, I am a fan of Welles, and believe that all of his films should be released in the most pristine perfect version possible. So to watch this monstrosity of a DVD pained me more than anything. I couldn't enjoy the film because the limitations of the disc were so annoying. First off, this is not a clean print. The image looks horrid and the sound is not much better. Laserlight really just dumped the picture and ran. Is the film good? Yeah, it's not his best film, but it's still entertaining. But I'll pick up another copy sometime when a company that cares about it releases it. This versions cheap becuase it's not very good.",983318400,9,633,4.4655172413793105
1376146,1,B00004YKQE,"Laserlight's scratched and speckled public domain version of MR. ARKADIN, even at four bucks, is worthless and rapes Welles's memory. Seven versions of this film are floating about. The best is Criterion Collection's superbly rich, smooth-flowing laserdisc, which I have and which I hope will appear on DVD along with Criterion's vastly well-documented MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS. And may Criterion get the strong new print released to theaters early last year for its DVD version of CITIZEN KANE. Laserlight's MR. ARKADIN, the film's U.S. title, is just atrocious, with jumps, dialogue dropouts, a pale image, and worst of all, a linear re-editing of the story which Welles expressly strove to avoid. He wanted wildly intense editing. With its lost footage (you wouldn't believe the great stuff they left out), the Laserlight version only looks swift, while the Criterion version, called CONFIDENTIAL REPORT, has the European release, anointed by New Wave directors back in the fifties, which cleaves more closely to Welles's vision. There is NO FINAL EDIT BY WELLES known to exist. While you await Criterion's DVD of CONFIDENTIAL REPORT (or seek the laserdisc on auction sites), buy the DVDs of THE TRIAL and the re-edited TOUCH OF EVIL for Welles in his glory. I haven't seen Bogdanovich's LADY FROM SHANGHAI DVD, a film gutted by Columbia Pictures (especially the Fun House climax), then rescored, and stripped as well of Welles's strong, radio-smart sound effects (just dead studio sound remains)---but have great hopes for it and await its delivery from Amazon. RKO gutted THE STRANGER, weakening it, removing a dark, 20-minute opening about Nazis in South America which set up Franz Kindler's being in New England. It's a necessary DVD, nonetheless. But avoid Laserlight's washed out public domain MY MAN GODFREY DVD. My tape off PBS is far richer, as I imagine is the videocassette version.",973641600,52,1893,5.230263157894737
