8401982,5,B003PD00BI,"Peter Burwash is an excellent communicator.  His book, primarily the first edition, is a classic.  This video series sprung from the book.

Burwash hosts this tape.  He does not waste words and gets right to the point on a variety of topics.  The tape is about an hour long and it is well worth watching repeatedly.  Simple but important concepts in singles and doubles are covered separately.
