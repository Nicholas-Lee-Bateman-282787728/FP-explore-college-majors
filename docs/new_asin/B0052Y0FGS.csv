8454790,3,B0052Y0FGS,This is just another release of the Filthy Lucre show in Japan where Johnny dresses like an Oompa Loompa. If you alreay have the show in one of it's various permutations don't bother. It is a good show though.,1388620800,,209,4.384615384615385
8454791,5,B0052Y0FGS,"I'm impressed. The film and audio quality are excellent- clear and closeup.  Considering this concert takes place towards the last leg of the tour, the Pistols are tight as hell and it's great to see the originals together on stage kicking ass.  I will say it's distracting to see John dressed as a Keebler elf...not sure what that was about...but ignoring that, the attitude is there.
Remember THIS IS THE 1996 reunion tour, so trying to compare anything to 1977 is ridiculous, ANY reunion is to be taken for ITS MOMENT AND ITS SOUND.  If you're a hardcore Pistols fan, this is a must-have for memory sake because you probably attended the tour somewhere around the world.  I say this one's worth it no matter what, but to each his own after all.  Watch it loud in stereo and have a gobsmacking good time.",1366588800,3,806,4.569444444444445
8454792,5,B0052Y0FGS,"As always this Pistols concert is about an hour long and right to the point.  This video was shot in Japan during the 1996 Filthy Lucre tour.  The reunited Sex Pistols were certainly not short on energy and they were not looking back in any way.  They performed the songs with pure attitude and the gained insite that comes from being in their forties.  Johnny Rotten taunts and sneers at the audience all through the show and they simply want more from him.  The song arrangements are very close to the album versons with no extended solos or added jamming, but you can be sure Steve Jones does put the bollocks to them when he needs to.  Paul Cook gets his moment during the audience participation of Anarchy In The UK.  He draws the crowd in and they respond!  Glen Matlock bolsters the songs with his nimble bass playing.  The show never drags or wears out it's welcome.  Nor is it pompus or bloated.  The Sex Pistols simply got in Japan's face and let the songs leave their message.

And that is why there are no bonus features on this disc.  You will not find language or audio options.  No backstage interviews or behind the scenes footage to be found. No easter eggs or other hidden suprises are on this disc.  Anything the Pistols have to say is found in their songs.",1337126400,6,1276,4.439655172413793
8454793,3,B0052Y0FGS,"The title is incredibly misleading; you'd think you're getting the 1970s notorious TV appearances--you're not. No Interviews, no Bill Grundy, no BBC TV...this is just another rehash of their newer concert footage. Same 'era' as ""There'll Always Be An England"". Nothing new here & no frills nor bonus materials. Sure, it's a great concert (even if John looks silly as hell in his leiderhosen & Oompa Loompa hair) but it's still really nothing new...Just wringing some more cash outta chaos, that's all. A dud.",1331424000,,508,5.059523809523809
