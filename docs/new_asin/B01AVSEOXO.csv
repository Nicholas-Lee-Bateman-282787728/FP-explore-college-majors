7613701,5,B01AVSEOXO,"I had the opportunity to see this current incarnation of Renaissance last night at a venue in D.C it had been 38 years since I last saw them in the U.K. they sounded even better than the 38 years since I had seen them. Annie's voice is a true miracle of sound and there has been no fall off whatsoever. This band is meant to be experienced in person, but if you can't get to one of their amazing performances, this is the next best thing. The set list is breathtaking and the musicianship is second to none. Thank you Annie for keeping this music alive ",1455321600,5,553,4.216981132075472
7613702,5,B01AVSEOXO,"In spite of the tragic loss of Michael Dunford in 2012, Renaissance has retooled & gone forward. Musically, this is perhaps the tightest & most exciting version of the band ever! The addition of Leo Traversa on bass & Mark Lambert on guitar has given the rhythm section heightened energy & focus, and the presence of Tom Brislin in the Keyboard 2 role takes everything up a notch from the brilliant orchestral passages to the synth lead improvisations. Annie is still in fine voice, & the playing of both Rave Tesar on piano & Frank Pagano on drums seemed to be inspired by the energy of the new musicians. Also, Mark Lambert is the best male vocalist in the band since Jon Camp. The ensemble singing is also the finest ever with 3 of the men joining Annie in passages such as the one in the incredible ""Running Hard."" Speaking of the tunes, both classic & more recent compositions are featured. ""Mother Russia"" & ""Ashes Are Burning"" have  rarely been this dramatically performed & the new material is written in classic Renaissance style and are quite compelling. ""Symphony of Light"" is possibly the next Renaissance epic. The setting in the Union Chapel is sumptuous & totally in keeping with the band's aesthetic. Both the camera & sound work are first rate & you will thoroughly enjoy this DVD. Let's hope that they put out videos of the 2 tunes I was lucky enough to experience last October (with this same lineup): ""Song For All Seasons"" & ""Sounds of the Sea.""",1455062400,6,1466,4.638461538461539
7613703,5,B01AVSEOXO,Great music with extraordinary sound and camera work in a beautiful venue,1455062400,3,73,5.166666666666667
7613704,5,B01AVSEOXO,"This is the band's second live DVD following&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Renaissance-Live-In-Concert-Tour-2011/dp/B008B8AOCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Renaissance Live In Concert Tour 2011</a>. Both are excellent performances, but this DVD is technically superior. The video quality is better (shot in HD), and the gorgeous venue is beautifully lit by Steve Hackett's lighting director Russel 'Tigger' Matthews. There are more camera angles providing excellent coverage of all musicians. Editing is paced just right.

The stereo audio track on the DVD is LPCM encoded (CD quality), mixed by Rave Tesar. A first for the band, the DVD also includes a 5.1 Dolby Digital surround track. The surround mix is subtle but adds a lot to the home theater concert experience.

Unlike the previous DVD, this set list includes the traditional encore of a nearly 20-minute Ashes are Burning, and it is outstanding. My one disappointment is that Song for All Seasons or Day of the Dreamer is not included.",1455062400,11,1038,5.913333333333333

Thanks",1489968000,,17,5.0
7613706,3,B01AVSEOXO,"Love this band, and instrumentally this is great. The band is just excellent, but what was really a downer for me was some of  Annie Haslam's performance. I can't be the only person that cringed many times during her vocals,  which made it quite obvious that Haslam has lost some of  her vocal range, or maybe it was just a bad night for her, or maybe I was expecting too much. I might like it better on a second listen.",1484265600,3,420,4.225
7613707,5,B01AVSEOXO,"I don't know why there are a few reviews of ""Procal Harum Live at the Union Chapel"" but doesnt hurt anything and I may even buy that one! Well to the Renaissance version of Live at the Union Chapel, I find it to be very good. At first I thought it might not even be on par with the live DVD that I got where they performed Turn of the Cards and Scheherazade and Other Stories from a couple of years back. Annie has aged a bit and when they performed the first song on this DVD, prologue which is a bit of scales and medeval scat singing, I thought she handled the vocal duties very well and of course the musicianship is very good also, in fact most of the crew here was on the Turn of the Cards/Scheherazade and Other Stories compilation. Carpet of the Sun came next with Ocean Gypsy right after and all were good. Running Hard which is probably my favorite song overall from these guys was good but I am spoiled and will always consider the studio version on Turn of the Cards to be the absolute best it could ever be done...........very dynamic on that album and was a little weaker here and the other live version where the TOTC/SAOS were performed.

Then I listened to Grandene Il Vento and my ears started perking up. The whole group and Annie seemed to be hitting their stride now in the performance. On all of the songs there is a short explanation of something about the song and then Annie explained Symphony of Light was dedicated to Michael Dunford. I had to listen to that three times before I could go on.............great performance! Northern Lights, The Mystic and the Muse, Mother Russia and the encore Ashes are Burning held my focus throughout.

What I realized is that even though Annies voice is still better than any I have ever heard but when she sings the older stuff like Running Hard, it is just the matter that you cant reproduce young when you are old..........it can be nothing but a little different. So then I realized that songs like Symphony of Light etc. are much more recent compositions and those songs as astounding performed here.

All I could really do while watching all of this was to applaud and be very envious of those who were able to attend the concert at Union Chapel. Highly recommend.",1481673600,2,2234,4.443902439024391
7613708,5,B01AVSEOXO,"This is an excellent documentation of what may well be the best version of this group yet.  Annie Haslam is still quite amazing, and the twin keyboards of Rave Tesar and Tom Brislin are wonderful.  Try to see this group live if you can, but there aren't many chances for that these days, so I recommend getting this as a substitute.",1478217600,,332,4.426229508196721

7613711,5,B01AVSEOXO,"I enjoyed this DVD very much. I was surprised in fact by its production level and by the video and audio quality.
The performance of the band is very good and it will not disappoint the fans even in those classics and loved songs.
Annie's voice is another good surprise. She's so powerful and sharp that it seems even better than before.
The other guys are great musicians and are wonderful replaces to John Tout, Michael Dunford, Jon Camp and Terry Sullivan.
I liked very much the new songs too. They are great and in the same style, beautiful melody, great vocal harmonies and lots of keyboards.
The old and classic songs are very well performed and arranged with the keyboards replacing the orchestra parts.
Therefore I have no complaints (unless it could be two hours longer...) and I love it.",1473206400,,797,4.659574468085107
7613712,5,B01AVSEOXO,Anyone who has enjoyed Renaissance over the years will want this in their DVD collection. Very nice camera work and sound quality. The intimate venue is a plus.,1469491200,,160,4.75

7613714,4,B01AVSEOXO,One of my favorite groups ever and they are still great. Annie Haslam sounds almost as good now as she did in the 1970s! Wow! What would have made this even better is if they had an orchestra backing them up.,1468800000,,208,4.097560975609756
7613715,5,B01AVSEOXO,"Nice DVD concert of Renaissance. Great venue to record and film the show for their type of music. Also, the sound and video is excellent.  Annie Haslam's voice is still as good as it was in the seventies. Plus the band is brilliant. Totally amazing. Three tracks from their newest studio album plus the classic seventies music is on the DVD. Hopefully, they will do another studio album soon.",1468454400,2,392,4.681159420289855

7613719,5,B01AVSEOXO,"This is a great Renaissance concert film.  Annie Haslam is still in good voice.  I saw Renaissance in 2013 and 2014 and Day Of The Dreamer and Song For All Seasons were performed.  I was disappointed that these songs were not included on this fine DVD.  On a positive note, several songs from the Symphony Of Light album were included in this film..",1464566400,2,349,4.492063492063492
7613720,5,B01AVSEOXO,"I'll let others speak about the technical aspects of this concert DVD (such as lighting, 5.1 surround sound, etc.). I want to speak to the music. First off, for those of you who are not familiar with Renaissance but love ""old skool"" prog rock, this is a band you MUST add to your collection! For far too long this band has remained in relative obscurity by comparison to the contemporaries of their day--King Crimson, Yes, ELP, etc. Song for song, Renaissance is better than all of those bands. This concert DVD was recorded at the famous Union Chapel in London (same place Procol Harum recorded one of its classic concerts) in April 2015. The set list includes a nice selection of some of their most well-known songs as well as a few new songs from the album Grandine il Vento, recorded prior to the untimely passing of the band's heart and soul, Michael Dunford. There is not a bad song in this live collection; in fact, they're all real gems. Most may be familiar with ""Northern Lights."" Many may be familiar with ""Prologue,"" ""Carpet of the Sun,"" ""Ocean Gypsy,"" ""Running Hard,"" ""Mother Russia"" and ""Ashes are Burning."" They're all here. In addition to these timeless classics, the viewer gets to see the band run through ""Grandine il Vento,"" ""Symphony of Light"" and ""The Mystic and the Muse""--three of their most recently recorded songs. The musicianship of Rave Tesar (keyboards), Tom Brislin (keyboards), Mark Lambert (acoustic 6- and 12-string guitars), Leo Traversa (bass) and Frank Pagano (drums and percussion) is incredible and jaw-dropping! With the newer technology that exists today, Renaissance are able to capture and recreate the symphonic aspects of their recorded work from their ""classic line up"" period (early 70's to early 80's). Annie Haslam's five-octave voice is just as clear, powerful and emotive as it was when she was in her 20's and just starting out with the band.

The time changes and orchestration that characterizes prog rock can be found in all of the songs on this DVD, including their newer numbers. ""Symphony of Light"" is a triumphant return to their ""classic"" period and is one of the outstanding pieces on the disc. ""Running Hard"" and ""Ashes are Burning"" are two of their better, older tunes--in my opinion--but you can't go wrong with any of the songs on this concert DVD. For those of you who are looking for a band to call your own, or more ""mature"" Renaissance fans who want to relive those bygone glory days of the 70's, buy this DVD. If you're a fan of prog rock, I'm willing to bet the farm you won't be disappointed.

Personally, I have literally played this concert DVD at least 75 times since I received my copy in December of last year. I just can't seem to put it down! I wanted to share the majesty and glory that is Renaissance with my closest friends and family, so I've purchased at least 10 copies of this DVD to send to them. Words can't describe just how amazing this music video really is! For those of you who are not familiar with their work, buy this DVD first. If you like it, I would suggest you then get your hands on a copy of the concert DVD ""Tour 2011: Turn of the Cards; Scheherazade and Other Stories Live in Concert."" If you cant get this DVD on Amazon, you can pick up a copy at Renaissance's web site (renaissancetouring.com). This is another very special concert, recorded at the Keswick Theater in the Philadelphia area. The band performs what many consider to be their two best albums, Turn of the Cards (1974) and Scheherazade and Other Stories (1975) in their entirety. Lord have mercy! ""Song of Scheherazade"" alone is worth the price of admission! If this second DVD grabs you and hooks you into Renaissance, I would suggest you then go grab some of their classic albums. My suggestion is start with the two albums just mentioned and also find copies of Prologue, Ashes Are Burning and A Song For All Seasons.

Although obviously the classic line up of the band is no longer together, the musicians that make up the modern incarnation of Renaissance are musicians par excellence. They still tour, mainly up and down the Atlantic seaboard and occasionally in western Europe and Asia. If you ever get a chance to see this band play, GO GO GO! You most definitely won't regret it.

This review comes from an independent fan of Renaissance who serves in no official capacity for the band.",1463270400,5,4364,4.693211488250653
7613721,5,B01AVSEOXO,Excellent concert dvd. It consists of AH and an outstanding new group playing old and new Renassance music. The overall quality is excellant. AH sounds great. AH said it best. Renaissance is back.,1462060800,,196,4.96969696969697
7613722,5,B01AVSEOXO,"Lucky enough to see them at Frome on this UK Tour, so this DVD is a fantastic reminder as they played the same set. It really makes you appreciate how talented all the members of the band are, and the version of Ashes are Burning is just epic. The setting at the Union Chapel in London is just wonderful.",1457740800,,304,4.169491525423729
7613723,5,B01AVSEOXO,"Saw this tour at The Robin 2 in Bilston, loved it then love the DVD, great souvenir of a superb evening of high quality singing and musicianship.",1457568000,,145,4.407407407407407
7613724,5,B01AVSEOXO,Absolutely superb performances by Annie Haslam and Renaissance - very high quality DVD. This is the best live concert recording available of this unique and amazing group. Annie Haslam's voice has never sounded better and the musicianship is impeccable. Bravo to Annie Haslam for keeping the flame of this timeless music alive.,1455753600,10,327,5.3076923076923075
8748633,2,B01AVSEOXO,Really the disc should be called ancient Annie Haslam & group. She is struggling to sing in tune and some would be suitable for Halloween. Sorry to make this review. To cap it all the Surround Sound is probably the worst Ive heard and I resorted to stereo. If you're looking for the full Renaissance sound with lovely singing then wait for the next try.,1534032000,,353,4.446153846153846
8748634,5,B01AVSEOXO,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this DVD, despite the fact that Annie Haslam is the only remaining member from the original band. The video quality is a noticeable improvement over the Turn Of The Cards/ Scheherazade DVD. There were a few missed notes, but overall it was very enjoyable to watch. Annie is still able to hit the soaring high notes, but you can tell she is really working to do what used to seem effortless in the past. The other musicians acquitted themselves quit well here. However I think that Tom Brislin was not as good at duplicating the band's original sound as Jason Hart was on the prior DVD. I have been listening to Renaissance since I purchased the Live At Carnegie Hall album in my college days back in 1977. I was never able to see the band in concert, so it is nice to have this DVD.",1528588800,,817,4.381578947368421

8748640,5,B01AVSEOXO,"A truly stellar concert experience. Picture quality on a 4k tv is absolutely stunning! Annie Haslam is in excellent form,as usual. Though i did notice an occasional strain on some notes, it is few & far between ( she IS 70 ), she hits the high notes with full force that will make you gasp. The band is exceptional; to my mind, better than the original.",1493683200,,353,4.363636363636363
