277468,4,6300219658,"Actually got this DVD, A Great Wall, because it has table tennis in it. However, I was more than pleasantly surprised. Not only did I get a new glimpse of China (at the time the movie was made), but it is a very good movie showing the different ways people in different countries live and admire each other's habits. A very good family story involving culture, family, and sport...",1268611200,3,381,4.536231884057971
277469,5,6300219658,"A GREAT WALL is a great film, over twenty years later and is definitely worth watching.  Director Peter Wang did a great job capturing the experiences of Chinese-American family, headed by their father (Peter Wang), a product of Silicone Valley, who, when passed up for a promotion believes that it is because he is Chinese.  After that setback, he quits his job and uproots his family to go visit relatives in China.  Yet, struggle exists everywhere (even if you try to relocate yourself to get perspective).  Good lord knows the family experiences this in droves, due to cultural misunderstandings and language barriers.  Yet, it is also a very important journey (filled with warm and happy moments, too).  I enjoy that this film is so real and believeable.  The actors are great and they truly work well together as an ensemble.  It also provides insight for audience members unaware of the great divide between people that exists when some family relocates to the United States, while others remain in their native country.  This is a great character study.",1186790400,4,1061,4.9491525423728815
277470,5,6300219658,"I'm surprised no one has wanted to review this film, though maybe with the current interest in comic-book heroes, slam-bang action features, violence, etc etc etc, this film is a little too benign for many.  At any rate, I highly recommend it:  Peter Wang stars as the father of his Chinese-American family.  They visit China to re-connect with his wife's relatives and visit his own father's grave after many years.  The film is full of tender and amusing moments, especially when the Chinese relatives meet their American relatives, and the American electric blanket starts smoking from being plugged into Chinese current, or when the Chinese father remarks that the Americans don't know how to use chopsticks, and his wife reminds him that he doesn't know how to use a fork.  The Chinese-American athletic son turns the head of the Chinese daughter, who temporarily begins to think and dress ""American,"" provoking critical reactions from her Chinese boyfriend and various onlookers, but finally the son loses in a hard-fought ping-pong game (to the boyfriend), confusions of identity and self-concept are straightened out, and the film ends on the most pleasant of notes.  This film is not only well worth seeing, but ought to be on DVD.  I suppose the bottom-line, cost/benefit analysis mentality rules the better format out.  But there ought to be, somewhere, in the shark-infested waters of the film industry, moments of selflessness, where someone says, ""This is a really wonderful, heartwarming film--let's make it available.  We can make plenty of money on other things with far less humanity.""",1121558400,,1603,5.158301158301159
277471,4,6300219658,"I saw this film in an LA theater when it first came out. It was gentle, charming, and about family and generations in a universal way but with Chinese faces, places and customs which made it interesting. It was a very nice way to spend a couple of hours and I recommend it highly.",1091145600,7,280,4.203703703703703
277472,3,6300219658,"The American Fang family is going to Beijing to meet Leo's sister and her family who he has not seen for 30 years.  When they meet, both families have preconceived notions of how things should be based on their own culture and they encounter different barriers besides the Great Wall.  These barriers are built upon the minute details that are encountered in everyday life along with ideas that people have been taught through their environment.  These differences are blown up by presumptions of how things should be base on learned morals, values, and beliefs.  The Great Wall presents an interesting idea; however, the film feels forced as the characters seem a little to rigid in their environment.  The end result is an average cinematic experience that does not meet up to the expectations of the story.",1043539200,5,809,4.919117647058823
277473,5,6300219658,"A Great Wall tells the story of a Chinese family living in America when the father, a first generation Chinese immigrant and computer specialist, decides to take his family home to China for a visit.  What follows is a delightful study in cultural contrasts but, more importantly, a study in the special issues that 1st generation families face from both the perspective of the parents and the children.  In the end, the movie still manages to be warm and light-hearted while still exposing the key issues in satyrical fashion.  A really fun movie to watch over again.  Highly recommended.",1034294400,18,589,4.91919191919192
7807382,5,6300219658,"Not quite a comedy, more drama... ""A Great Wall"" was a good 1980's-style look at the cultural differences between a Chinese American family and their Mainland Chinese relatives. The film also shows Post-Mao China during the beginning of the Deng Xiaoping era. This is a China that one will no longer see if visiting the country today. I would only recommend this film for those with an interest in 1980's China nostalgia... or is a fan of that Wham music video ""Freedom"" (the one that shows the group's 1985 China tour). I was constantly thinking of that Wham video and song while watching ""A Great Wall"".",1516233600,,605,4.716981132075472

7807384,4,6300219658,"REVIEWING the Blu Ray copy of this obscure but unique film. I owned the original DVD copy of it and this BD gives no image improvement, a shame that this title fell into the hands of Kino-Lorber who was never conscientious in their film transfers (take Tampopo, or Come And See, and Great Wall, of course). If you owned the DVD, by all means skipped this edition, the colors remained muted, and image is fairly soft. But the film in its unremastered high-def format remains resonant and nostalgic in the sense that it was released in the year I graduated from high-school, where China still wasn't ""rich"", and a Chinese-hybrid type of perestroika/glasnost thats confined only in the economic sphere - was something like still a decade away. Peter Fang seemed to have saw a ""slit' - a cultural thaw during that time where Chinese paranoia against anything Western is starting to slackened, the result is a film that for me I don't want to end - well at least that it should get going for three or more hours. The far more interesting characters are the ones by Lili and the Chinese boy, while the younger Wang role will never be emphatic because he played the typical irreverent, foul-mouthed, sports-crazed white Western dude - in a Chinese man's body.
Lending comical relief is the boy that's Diao's best friend, who has not aspired to a higher ambition - in this case going into Beijing University, and liking Luciano Pavarotti. The best thing about this film is that it was made in 1985 where the US appears an economic, social paradise (the superpower beast wasn't yet wounded on its head) while China look unspoilt, still very much the ""sleeping dragon.""",1496361600,2,1659,4.724137931034483
7807385,3,6300219658,It was O.K. Not what we expected but still interesting. Lots of Chinese culture compared with American culture. It felt like a student film.,1422489600,,140,4.875
7807386,5,6300219658,Probably a film most likely to be loved by people who were in China in the 80s. I loved it.,1417651200,,91,3.6
7807387,5,6300219658,I love the intertwining of two families of the same culture but from two very different societies. This movie is fun to watch.,1410825600,,126,4.521739130434782
7807388,5,6300219658,"This is a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful film about cross cultural differences between a Chinese-American family and their relatives, a Chinese family.  Wonderful scenes of life in China (pre-Tiananmen Square), wonderful performances and great humor and drama.
Warm and real.  Well-acted, written and directed.  A true gem of a film.",1365120000,,334,5.775510204081633
7807389,5,6300219658,"A great movie that stars a friend of mine Kelvin Han Yee. It is about an American family who relocates to China after he quits his job. They move in with their relatives, and comedy ensues due to language & cultural barriers. There is also a Ping Pong Tournament that occurs in the movie, this was cool to watch! <3 <3 <3",1363478400,,321,4.193548387096774
7807390,5,6300219658,"I liked this movie - it did a wonderful job of portraying the culture shock encountered by a Chinese-American family living in San Francisco that takes a vacation trip to Beijing for the father to visit his sister and her family. The San Francisco family consists of the father who was born in China but came to the U.S. early in his life, who still retains his basic roots although has become Americanized, his born in the U.S. Chinese-American wife who is much more Americanized and doesn't speak Chinese but still retains the basic culture, and their totally Americanized son. It's interesting to see how each of them reacts to their experience in China, in particular to the sister's family consisting of her, her very traditional husband, and their impressionable daughter.

The experience is handled in a warm and believable way - there's nothing hugely dramatic but then there doesn't have to be. It's a movie about cultural differences and everything is handled tastefully. I also enjoyed the many scenes of Beijing - the grander tourist attractions as well as the everyday living that most people never see. It was very interesting. This is a very well done film and I heartily recommend it.",1343088000,2,1200,4.882352941176471
7807391,5,6300219658,"This is a true good movie that shows the differences between Chinese and Chinese-Americans.

What I liked about the movie was it portray the language barrier right off the bat. This might be a shock to people, but many Chinese-American do not speak Mandarin. That's right, they don't speak it because they learn English growing up and not Mandarin. I said Mandarin because saying Chinese isn't exactly correct as there are a bunch of Chinese Langauges out there. So, in the movie what they are speaking is Mandarin.

Many people in Beijing don't speak English as well. They do try to learn English, but that still doesn't mean they fully understand everything. That was shown in this movie. I must say though, the Chinese people in China do give more of a enough in learning English than the Chinese-American trying to learn Mandarin. That was shown in the movie when the mother and son both took Chinese Classes, but they didn't know anything whatever someone would talk to them in Mandarin when they were in Beijing. Now, the reverse isn't true as you see Lilli being talked to in English over and over again. She did understand more English than the guy, Paul, understood any Mandarin.

As expected, the two different cultures clashes come out and is shown in the movie. I loved seeing and learning about how different the two cultures really are. One thing for sure came out and Chinese-American are very well feed compared to Chinese people in Beijing.

Towards the end of the movie, it was very well done as both cultures/families learned a little something about each other and are better off that way.

This a great movie to buy and a great movie to watch. I fully recommend it.",1335398400,2,1686,4.7016949152542376
