8335156,3,B001Q8FSQ6,"The Revenge of the Crusader (1964) made me suffer deprivation of all interest in the first few minutes. It begins with Arabs and a few western crusaders in opening shots, fighting, the crusaders were really violent barbarians in these fake, inadequate sequences.

The First Crusade was a ploy to play for a stake in wealth and power. The truth is that the crusades were a response to the greed in barons and an attempt to reclaim Christian holy lands for profit.

Fundamentally, if you are an enthusiastic devotee of sword and Crusader epics, swashbuckling romances and imitation sword adventures, then The Revenge of the Crusader should be in accordance with your interests and right up your garden and something inspiring.",1384300800,2,724,5.025
8335157,4,B001Q8FSQ6,"Mya Communication has released an excellent Italian Epic from the Early Sixties which resembles the old Hollywood sword plays from the thirties and fifties in 'THE REVENGE OF THE CRUSADER' aka 'GENOVEFFA DI BRANANTE', a film which starts out as corny but gradually builds to a tension of unease and dread.  It stars two actors who would make their mark in Euro Horror cult classics : Alberto Lupo who was in the great guilty pleasure 'ATOM AGE VAMPIRE' aka 'SEDDOK-L'EREDE DI SATANA' plays the hero in a very subdued performance and Stephen Forsyth who appeared in Mario Bava's delirious giallo 'HATCHET FOR THE HONEYMOON' as the villain in a cold, cobra-like manner.  Written and Directed by Riccardo Freda , it has many genre touches appearing throughout its running time almost capturing a film noirish style within its structure.  There are great horrific Freda touches such as a chase through a forest during a thunderstorm and an extremely gritty for its time torture dungeon scene.  The film has a great Errol Flynn/Basil Rathbone sword fighting climax between hero and villain as future action director Stelvio Massi has them going up shadowy corridors, down staircases,and dangling from parapets in beautiful chiarascuro photography.  The rousing score by Carlo Rusticelli completes the mix and all in all, the film emerges as a brilliant dose of opulent derring do.  Mya Communication releases a nice, crisp 1.85 transfer in Italian with English subtitles which is highly recommended for all action film fans.",1299369600,4,1519,5.154471544715447
8335158,5,B001Q8FSQ6,"The Revenge of the Crusader is a, Spanish / Italian co-production that was co-written and directed by Jos&eacute; Luis Monter whose only other notable film credit includes working as a assistant director on  Riccardo Freda's, Romeo and Juliet. The screenplay for The Revenge of the Crusader was co-written by Riccardo Freda whose other notable films include The Horrible Dr. Hitchcock, The Ghost, Double Face, The Iguana with the Tongue of Fire and Tragic Ceremony. The score for The Revenge of the Crusader was composed by Carlo Rustichelli, whose other notable scores include The Whip and the Body, Blood and Black Lace, The Maniacs and Kill, Baby... Kill! Carlo Rustichelli composes an adequate and at times unremarkable score for The Revenge of the Crusader.

The plot is a Medieval tale about jealously, obsession and revenge that owes a lot of its style and structure to the Peplum film genre which was on its last legs around the time this film was being made. Visually the film is very appealing as picturesque landscapes and sound stage locations are used to their fullest. The action sequences are well done, even if they are very tame, especially by today's standards. Over the course of his career director Riccardo Freda had been replaced by other directors and his association with this film via the screenplay and some of the film's visual style during the opening sequences, suggests he might have been this film's original director.

The cast are more than adequate in their respective roles with the only stand out performance coming from Stephen Forsyth in the role of Golo. There is even a scene in The Revenge of the Crusader that foreshadows Stephen Forsyth's most famous role John Harrington, from the Mario Bava film Hatchet for the Honeymoon. Golo disposes of a traitor by driving an axe through his skull. The most entertaining aspect of this film is watching Stephen Forsyth in one of his first starring roles going ballistic on anyone who opposes him. Ultimately if you are a fan of sword & sandal epics and swashbuckling adventures, than The Revenge of the Crusader should be right up your alley.

The DVD:

The Revenge of the Crusader is presented in a letterboxed widescreen that frame the image in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio. This transfer has been flagged for progressive playback. The opening and closing credits are in Italian. The source used for this transfer is in good shape, print damage is virtually nonexistent. Also the 1.85:1 aspect ratio appears to be this film's original aspect ratio as opening and closing credits fully appear in frame and the image never looks to tightly framed. Colors and flesh tones look accurate. Black levels fare well and outside of a few minor instances where the image looks a tad too soft, details look crisp throughout. There is some mild edge enhancement which is noticeable throughout.

This release comes with one audio option a Dolby Digital mono mix in Italian. There are no problems with background noise or any other major audio defects. The audio sounds clear and evenly balanced and at times robust, mostly during the fight sequences and when the score for the film is playing in the background. Removable English subtitles that are easy to read and follow have been included. Of note the subtitles do have some grammatical errors.

This release comes with no extra content. Overall The Revenge of the Crusader gets a satisfying release that is highlighted by a well rounded audio video presentation.",1288915200,2,3480,4.958833619210978
