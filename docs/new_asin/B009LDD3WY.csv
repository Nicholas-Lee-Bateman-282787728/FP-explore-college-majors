5349438,5,B009LDD3WY,I have enjoyed the Treme series from day one to the present. I'm waiting anxiously for the final season to finally air! I guess I love the show so much because of my deep affection for the city of New Orleans as well.,1371945600,10,217,4.069767441860465
5349439,2,B009LDD3WY,"Treme: The Complete Third Season was enjoyable when I saw it on HBO, and I imagine I'll enjoy watching it again if, and when, Amazon sends it to me. The music is wonderful, the acting superb, and the story line must have grabbed me, this being season three and all.  Before purchasing Season Three, now three months or so ago, I guess I would have liked to know (Amazon says this kind of detail ""makes a good review"") that Amazon actually had it in hand and could ship it to me. Amazon probably shouldn't list a product it can't get or ask the customer who hasn't received it for a product review.  Mild plaint, that, offered in good humor . . . because Treme's a great show.",1371859200,,675,4.307086614173229
5349440,5,B009LDD3WY,"I will not include any spoilers in this.
The third season continues the excellence of this show.
Anyone who saw The Wire and enjoyed it must see Treme, not only because it shares many of the same production crew and some actors, but because it is better than The Wire.
It draws together different strands of society and interweaves them in an intelligent, exciting and poignant storyline about post-Katrina New Orleans.
Slicker, more sophisticated and better acted than so much of what else is about.
The (Jazz and Folk) music is first class too.",1367625600,18,546,4.819148936170213

The Treme is one of the best pieces of television I have seen in years.  I've watched Series 1 and 2 over and over. I was in Jakarta last week and HBO was doing back-to-back-episode reruns.  So where is the DVD? Don't make me go to torrent for this.",1362873600,5,493,6.220588235294118
5349442,4,B009LDD3WY,"'Treme', the third season, brought the characters, Hurricane Katrina, the plot lines of each person together to show the connections. We started out in season one with the after affects of Katrina, up close and personal. The hurricane smashed the city, the families, and lives of it's inhabitants. Season one told their stories, season two told of their efforts to reclaim, and, now, season three shows us how they are all connected.

Treme is a series based on New Orleans musicians. It brings us a series of characters who are musicians or work with them, or have a place where musicians congregate. Music is the basis of the parade. When I think of New Orleans, I think of the parades, and 'Treme' three is a parade. A journalist shows up to help a lawyer follow the leads to a murderer, a down and out former addict musician finds his way to sobriety, a chef moves back from New York to her own restaurant, a bar owner tries to find her rapist, a young student wants to find her dreams, a good cop battles corruption, a favored musician receives a cancer diagnosis,and a trombonist teaching music at a school tries to find his way to the big time. A lot going on, and all of these characters have a subtle connection to each other. One or the other of these people find themselves embroiled in new situations and discover Katrina was just a jumping place for life.

Season three seemed to make the connections of what was going wrong and what could change to make lives better. The dreams that were realized were not always the thrill of a lifetime. And, as ever, the music was what held this series together. The music of New Orleans is riveting and life affirming. The beat and the bass and the mood it sets is New Orleans. We had some closure of troubles and doors still left open. We have Season Four to come with five more episodes. I am so looking forward to Treme, the finale.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 02-25-13",1361750400,40,1925,4.54178674351585
5349443,5,B009LDD3WY,"I have followed Treme from the first season til the third. I have enjoyed the touching storyline that is told from person to another. It is amazing how the people of New Orleans have managed to work through their problems, trials, disappointments, and tragedies. They have tried to overcome many obstacles and adversities. That is what some of the people have tried to do since their devasting ordeal with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The cast in this series are extremely talented in their craft as they have tried to portray the good, the bad, the pain, and the up and down struggles of some of the residents of New Orleans.

This show constantly uses top-notch actors, the best music in the world, architecture, food, politics and everything else that makes New Orleans so crazy to behold.  I am not sure how to review this show since I have been to the city so many times and know many of the places/musicians/restaurants that are in the show.  It is as close to authentic as actually going there, but you have to go there to ""get it"".  I mean, if you don't know who Kermit Ruffins and Donald Harrison are, how can you really enjoy this show?  All I can do is say that if you know who they are, this is sheer bliss, warts and all.  If you don't, watch this show and if it speaks to you, get on a plane immediately and go.  Life-altering experiences await.",1429401600,,775,4.303448275862069

5350581,4,B009LDD3WY,"AWSOME series! It could really use a cleaning up of the nudity (suggested and limited exposure would work just fine)and some of the language goes overboard even for a reality series.
BUT, THE MUSIC!!!!  I have been searching for a soundtrack for this series but haven't found one. Beside the stories of each character the music is intoxicating!! Some of the actors are real musicians and the ledgens such as Fats Domino with a cameo make this searies really believeable. Several times in my head I would wonder, ""What's happening to Antoine or LaDonna, or did DJ Davis ever finish the opera? I would love to see this series pick up again or spin off and follow a couple stories in more depth. An example would be a deeper review of John Goodman's character and how he got to the point where we see him in the show. Another spinoff could be to follow the Indians and tell more about them and the other chiefs. But what would make me watch would be THE MUSIC!!! I just can't stress how GREAT THE MUSIC IS in the show. The only reason I give this series 4 stars is because of the pornography I had to fast forward through and the constant language used. I would have turned the show off after the first 15min of it weren't for THE MUSIC! As an amature musician myself The MUSIC captured me and pulled me in and I fast forwarded through the crap. This series could have succeeded without all the crap.
If you are a musican you can't help being drawn into this show. If you are a Christian musican be very careful and keep your finger on the FF button and set up the language beeper. This series taught me a lot about New Orleans and its culture and it stayed away from the voodoo cult stuff which I'm grateful fo

5350666,5,B009LDD3WY,"If you enjoyed treme's style over the first two seasons you'll find the quality continues. Without spoiling anything ""The big Chief"" continues to show how an authentic culture can ensure true dignity. And that, to me, is what makes Treme utterly unique: as an exploration into how the New Orleans culture is authentic and true and dignified. We Americans are generally not threatened by cultural dynamism, but maybe our notions of change and plenty should have a counterpoint. The NOLA culture is the product of a very dynamic process, so it's strange to ask it to stand still, but it's a lot of fun to think about wanting it to go on the way it has been, in the not so distant past, at least for a while longer.  When we talk about moving CBGB to Vegas, we can wonder whether we need to look backwards, somewhat, for authenticity.",1425945600,,831,4.577181208053691

5350706,5,B009LDD3WY,"Right up there with ""The Sopranos"" and ""The Wire"" for complexity of its characters. I only wish the music from this season had been collected in an album.

5350738,5,B009LDD3WY,"I love this show. It gives a real insight into the gestalt of New Orleans residents and the travails they faced with Katrina. Liberally sprinkled with music and the joy that is Mardi Gras. A real classic and an example of the best that TV has to offer.

5350750,3,B009LDD3WY,"We found that the series is sort of losing its way, now more about the characters' rather than having their story arcs reflect New Orleans. The best episode, and its a GREAT one, is the Mardi Gras Indian episode. If there is one big upside to this is that they put longer musical numbers into the show. The music seemed less varied, but what they did show was excellent and fuller songs. Can't complain about that. That said, we probably won't watch the final half season 4.

Oh, as another buyer noted, this series is great for binge watching.",1423353600,,544,4.494949494949495

5350756,4,B009LDD3WY,"Treme is an excellent series. The complex stories that define and distinguish New Orleans' evolution through the centuries of history in light of the post Katrina years are brilliantly captured via the characters, the music, food, race relations, the politics of power, depth of caring people, corruption, and social justice to name a few. I will look forward to watching again. I love New Orleans and truly appreciate the seriies.",1419984000,,431,5.171428571428572

5350771,5,B009LDD3WY,"Outstanding show! Every one of the actors portraying continuing characters is outstanding.

Trem is honest in showing that the disaster that was Katrina was a perfect storm of Mother Nature and incompetence and corruption at every level, not just FEMA falling down on the job (which they arguably didn't do so badly).

My only quibble is that the musical numbers are too short. That said, the real star of the show is the music of New Orleans.",1419465600,,443,4.740259740259741

5350773,5,B009LDD3WY,Just started Season 3...and the whole series continues to have me thoroughly engaged to the characters and their lives...as they navigate day to day post-Katrina. Just can't say enough about the Music I wasn't aware of outside of Neville Bros'...totally new genre that I look forward to experiencing Live in the Future.,1419292800,,319,5.153846153846154

5350787,4,B009LDD3WY,Loved it.  The fact that it showed how the people of New Orleans suffered after Katrina.  The concept of what they went through wow. I love the music and how it seemed to have helped make it through some of the pain of lose. I got started an couldn't stop watching until there were no more to watch.  Good job,1418601600,,309,4.116666666666666
5350788,4,B009LDD3WY,"Still a great series with a wonderful sound track. The Third Season focused on personal challenges and demons, with Katrina's effects as a more muted background.",1418515200,,161,5.230769230769231
5350789,5,B009LDD3WY,"Treme is a rare invitation to indulge and experience the culture of New Orleans.  Having been there twice after hurricane Katrina, we were able to understand the level of destation and how much it took to rebuild the city.  Treme allows one to learn about various political, cultural, and environ, environmental aspects of how events evolved just after the hurricane to the vibrant city is has come back to being.  Love that it was filmed there and that they used local actors.  It makes one want to go back and visit all the restaurants, bars, and events they show in the series.  Highly recommend.",1418515200,,599,4.721153846153846

5350791,5,B009LDD3WY,"Treme at it's best!!! Music, story, actors ... just all of it, enchanting, takes you in, totally!!! Tough stuff, if you allow yourself to go into it, couldn't work without the music, filled with soul just like the actors, like everybody is giving all they have, and find a way to go through the most difficult circumstances of living in a katrinazed city. A must to see and listen to!",1418342400,,384,4.5
5350792,5,B009LDD3WY,"Love this show and anything made by David Simon like The Wire, Homicide, etc.  It's writing, acting, cinematography and music is heartbreaking, inspiring and really illustrates the reality of New Orleans, the many cultures and art forms that make this city so important to protect  for its history and rebuilding physically/emotionally.  New Orleans is a magical place, just wish the governement took its citizens as seriously in working faster in making a stronger built city sana corruption!",1418256000,,493,5.376623376623376

5350794,5,B009LDD3WY,"Visited NOLA in 2013; It's amazing how this place becomes apart of you... the crescent city lives in our bones! So when we returned home to New England, we started watching this series as a way to stay connected to our experience there. And have we been hooked!! We started watching just after the last season ended, but this allowed us the ability to binge watch the first two seasons. The soundtracks are amazing, and its exciting to say during an episode 'we went there!' Or, 'I know that place!'
Even if you have never been, the series is a fabulously heart wrenching, hopeful and saddening, undying beat of the people and places that make New Orleans. MUST WATCH!!!",1418083200,,670,4.638655462184874

5350809,4,B009LDD3WY,"Still love this series, but found the first season more compelling.  The way each story line is continually broken up, showing just a snippet of each before circling around again, makes me feel a little A.D.D.  Not a lot of the story moves forward in each episode.  That being said, I find it worth watching just for the ""slice of life"" feel and the music.",1417737600,,356,4.446153846153846

The treatment given New Orleans is one of the jaundiced eye.  It's not cliche like so many other shows set there or a chamber of commerce shine job by any means.  Ultimately though, it's the characters and storytelling that make Treme so wonderful.  I watch each episode, then watch it again with the commentary, then again with the music commentary.

Characters that seemed barely important have complex and insurmountable problems that they slowly work through, or don't. It's a gritty show, the characters rarely look fantastic, they are more reality show than reality shows. Love the music, the writing is superb, and the talented actors are, well, exceedingly talented.",1412208000,,398,5.234375
5350888,5,B009LDD3WY,"Seasons 1-3 were excellent. However, I am totally turned off by your ""bait & switch"" tactics of trying to charge me for the fourth and final season (even though it is a shortened season). What idiot made that boneheaded decision? Do you actually think you can force us to pay additional for the last season, even though the first three were included in our prime membership? I can tell from reading the synopsis that the final episodes were just wrap-up episodes to wind it down and added nothing new to the story. It bothers me greatly that I now have to go and review every season before I start a new series to see if you are pulling a bait and switch on that one too. I can tell you, I have grave doubts about renewing Prime if this is the way you are going to treat your members.",1412121600,,784,4.268456375838926

It's great to hear the music and see scenes shot on location in NOLA landmarks. I like that you can hear a whole song, not just in the background.  The sites used aren't just the typical famous spots, they're ""hole in the wall"" places that only the locals know about. I watch when I get home sick.

5350974,5,B009LDD3WY,"I adore the show, it is fantastic. What I don't care for so much is the fact that I pay as much for Prime as I do Netflix and Prime sees fit to post 'most' of the seasons of a cancelled show and then try to charge me for the last season when I've already paid my subscription. The sub price claims to also save me money on shipping, when in fact I'm paying the same amount for shipping I would when buying from other vendors, the only difference being that with Prime my shipping is 2 day rather than the standard 5 to 7. I'm thinking we won't renew this subscription in the future. Charging me for the last season of a cancelled show when you already charged me a subscription, seriously, that's a bit greedy.",1408665600,7,710,4.189781021897811

Classic, traditional, and contemporary music styles done well by so many artists.  Many unique cultural aspects are viewed and are part of the story lines from Mardi Gras to music education to corruption to second lines to food and to negatives such as senseless murders and violent crimes that seem part of NO.

5350984,5,B009LDD3WY,"Excellent music and the terrific actors are superb. A very good peek into the amazing history of New Orleans Mardi Gras and jazz music. Spot performances of living legends of jazz and many local musicians. It cooks, along with the indigenous culinary cuisine. It has simultaneous story lines. One being about the sad and, I believe, truthful story about the horrible mismanagement and injustices forced upon the good people of New Orleans after the disastrous flooding.
  The main overlaying story is about N.O. style jazz music and it's huge influence it has today. About how the people are so very attached to it, and truly live it. It will make you laugh, it will make you happy and at times, sad. If you really love music and especially jazz, watch it for that reason alone. Altogether very, very entertaining.",1407888000,,814,4.848920863309353

In fact, the only negative I experienced is that they seem to go out if the way to show every characteristic, music style trait, flavor, etc when more time could be spent on the story lines.  By this season you are fully invested in the characters and I worried over who might be killed off.  What a great way to visit a place by watching in the comfort of your own home.

5351090,5,B009LDD3WY,"This continuing series, highlights both the goof and bad of New Orleans. At times the plot which intertwines at least 5 different stories gets chopped up moving from one place to another but the frenetic storytelling always has the background music that is fabulous! I think the modern convention of quickly switching around the plots of the several stories probably matches the ADD  nature of our culture.
The music and food stories are a true delight, taking you to the behind the scenes look at both. Many local to NOLA musicians are featured, that is the best part!",1403049600,,569,4.8061224489795915

5351093,5,B009LDD3WY,"This show shines a spotlight on the beauty and tragedy of New Orleans. The plight and difficulties, of a post Katrina city,
which was abandoned and cast an indifferent hand by the Bush administration during the storm. Remember, G.W. was on vacation and Katrina was obviously not a big enough concern for him to come back to Washington and man the helm to help the people of N.O..David Simon shows how N.O. then becomes a land grab, while many of the dislocated residents struggle to come back,
only to find their homes demolished without their consent or knowledge. This is not the least of the injustices heaped upon the
people of N.O. as we also hear the many stories of police intimidation and violence against the citizens it is supposed to protect.
Through it all though, we are shown the magnificent music and culture which is N.O. as well. The food and of course America's
gift to the world, "" creative improvised democratic music"". A must see!",1402617600,,951,4.700598802395209

5351110,5,B009LDD3WY,"Treme's third season is an exercise in patience (even compared to its first two). Because the show was renewed for a third and a short fourth season, the third does not have the complete arcs that characterized seasons one and two, and no strong theme emerges. Instead, it plays as a more detached exploration of the lives of the various characters. There also isn't nearly as much new ground explored here; we're mostly sticking with the established characters and settings, the most notable edition being a new character who is basically a muckraking reporter.

However, the third season serves to set up the show's preplanned conclusion in season four, and in that it succeeds. I strongly recommend sticking with it to the end.",1393891200,,730,4.934959349593496

Our son moved there not long after Katrina and we visit often, the first time when there were still black X's on houses and whole blocks were sitting abandoned.  I thought that the first season was a really good portrayal of NOLA in the first couple of years after the storm.  My New Orleans friends concur.  As the series progressed into Season II, it was still a pretty good picture.  Like all TV series, they have to move the story forward in a dramatic way, so Season III was a little less like reality (IMO).  Still, we enjoyed it, and will watch Season IV when it's available on Amazon.",1389225600,,652,4.391666666666667

The story is well written even into the third season; somehow it straddles the line between tragic and uplifting.  The way it is edited and presented shows that they have some respect for their viewers; the message is clear without being patronizing and redundant.

 I've only just visited New Orleans for a few weeks so I don't really know the city but what I see in ""Treme"" is a realistic portrait of real people struggling with life and the problems with building a society in a place where the only real rock bed foundation is art and soul.  It illustrates Shiller's quote, ""Es ist der Geist, der sich den Krper baut"" (the sould builds the body).  Brava",1386201600,2,748,4.537313432835821

Like all the footage and how they show the Columns Hotel.  The violin girl's character takes off.  Love that d.j. and love his song!  This show is well-done and worth it just see all the footage!

So then I ordered and watched the other series and found them fascinating and yet horrible to see first hand what the people of N.O. had to deal with from H. Katrina.  I suppose in a lot of ways they are still trying to recover.  Other than an over abundance of swear words which I managed to tune out I think anyone would and should watch this.  Actual bands were used, actual chefs were in the restaurant scenes.  And oh, that wonderful violin wonder, Lucia Micarelli!  She put every emotion into her music.  There was not nearly enough of that to suit me.  I understood she had studied classical music for 7 years but had never before acted.  She was a natural.
