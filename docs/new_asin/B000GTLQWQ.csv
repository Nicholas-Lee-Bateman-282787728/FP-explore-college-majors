8134471,5,B000GTLQWQ,A must watch for everyone who cares about animals. I have been advocating for 15 yrs. for puppy mill victims and this story was to the point. It is irritating that it takes so long to get a person/s convicted of a crime like this. I wish the film would have shown the criminal's facial expression when he was finally caught and handcuffed. The anger I felt during this film is productive for myself and I believe others as well. This is a issue that needs more and more attention. Watch it and share.,1445904000,2,500,4.329787234042553
8134472,4,B000GTLQWQ,"The 2006 documentary DEALING DOGS left me thinking: There's an endless stream of children's movies about dogs, let alone the multi-sequel series - BEETHOVEN, AIR BUD, BENJI, and so on.  But for DEALING DOGS to be produced, the anti-animal cruelty organization Last Chance for Animals had to come up with the money?  With the millions the film industry makes off our love of dogs and other pets, DEALING DOGS gets made on what looks like a budget that wouldn't pay for a case of Alpo?

Maybe that explains the unspeakable acts DEALING DOGS reveals in its undercover investigation of dog dealers.  Whether it's about a dog matching wits with Charles Grodin or one in an overcrowded kennel that will be sold for medical research if it's not first killed by other dogs, there is no thought for anything other than profit and loss?",1439164800,2,826,4.755244755244755
8134473,4,B000GTLQWQ,Older documentary exposing puppy mills. The film is a bit dated but a good start for someone who wants info on the cruel world of puppy mills.,1391731200,,142,4.296296296296297
8134474,5,B000GTLQWQ,this is a wonderful documentary but the only way to truly save dogs and factory farmed animals is to go vegan!!! then they won't have to die!,1289952000,3,141,4.2592592592592595
8134475,5,B000GTLQWQ,"Very interesting.  Great undercover investigation. I can't believe so many dogs are STILL going to research facilities and teaching schools.  With the millions of dogs, why on earth would bunchers go and steal someone's pet? If the government knows these dog dealers exist, why don't they inspect better or more often in a country that is so opposed to animal crimes.  They basically get away with hurting animals because they are merely a commodity.",1269302400,7,450,5.054054054054054
8134476,4,B000GTLQWQ,"this is a very well made documentary.

its really unfortunate that things like this exist. its probably one of the most disgusting things a person can do. im glad in the end they had dogs taken away. but there is never going to be a punishment large enough to hit these people with.

the worst part is probably watching a dog get shot in the head. that, and when the poor sickly dog is barely alive one day and dead the next. it makes it so much worse to see something alive and then to see them dead. it makes it personal, as if there could have been something you could do. it effects you in such a way that you almost lose hope.

i cant imagine what their kids are going to grow up to be like... save us all.",1263945600,2,711,4.028368794326241
8134477,5,B000GTLQWQ,this video shows  the  problem that is happening all over the  country.  I  will  warn  you  it  is  graphic  and is  not  intended  for young children.,1248307200,3,152,4.346153846153846
8134478,5,B000GTLQWQ,"This was a very difficult watch for any dog lover. I watched this with my dogs on my lap and by my feet and with tears on my face. I haven't seen this type of indifference towards life since watching documentaries on concentration camps. It is unfortunate to put it that way, but that is who these Arkansas rednecks resemble the most:Nazis. Hell cannot be hot enough in my opinion for these people.
The program is very well done and allows us as the viewers to understand the danger that the undercover activist is in. As an undercover informant he has to see(and share with us) such cruelty and large amounts of unnecessary deaths. If you plan on watching this with children present, you would probably want to preview it first and see that it would be a very bad idea. The hope all throughout the show is that the evil-doers will get punished. They do and they don't. The fines and losing of ones license (eventually) seem a little too much like the proverbial slap on the wrist.
The only way I see someone wanting to watch this possibly to convince someone about animal rights and cruelties. I don't see this as an entertainment type program, but it does help to inform about something that most of the country isn't aware of, especially my grateful happy dogs who are still wondering why I shed so many tears.",1242691200,12,1313,4.5210084033613445
8134479,5,B000GTLQWQ,"In short, this is a very disturbing documentary on one ""Class B"" dog dealer, and how they mistreated and abused the dogs held in their care.  In the end, because of the efforts of a small animal rights organization who sent in an undercover investigator, the operation gets shut down by the feds, and the owner fined.  There are also elements of hypocrisy in this film, such as when the owner is revealed as being the preacher of his small Christian church.  The hypocrisy, of course being how can a religious and supposedly caring Christian disregard and abuse many of these beautiful, innocent animals?!  It's hard to believe that this kind of stuff goes on in this day and age.",1237939200,6,680,4.641666666666667
8134480,5,B000GTLQWQ,"Before starting my review, I feel it's absolutely necessary to warn all viewers of what they are about to witness here.  The secret video footage taken of the dogs along with the illegal, cruel, and inhumane activities in this kennel is deeply disturbing on many levels and it is very difficult to watch.  I wanted to cry more than once while watching this program and I'm not afraid to admit this.  The journey through this documentary is a heartbreaking one but the ending is rewarding and it makes the effort worthwhile.

Thousands of dogs are bought by research labs and veterinary schools every year in America.  These animals are supplied by `Class A' dealers (they breed the dogs themselves) and `Class B' dealers (they buy dogs from the pound, shelters, and small breeders) and this latter category are the ones who have been known to regularly violate animal welfare laws meant to protect animals.  Class B dealers are licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to buy, house, and sell dogs.  The USDA, through the federal Animal Welfare Act, is supposed to ensure the humane treatment of these dogs.  Obviously they are failing in their responsibilities as this program clearly demonstrates.

In 2002, a small animal rights organization, Last Chance For Animals, began a 6 month undercover investigation of Martin Creek Kennel in Williford, Arkansas which happened to be America's most notorious Class B dog dealer.  An investigator, known only as 'Pete', successfully infiltrated this kennel as an employee working for the owner C.C. Baird.  After 6 months undercover and with over 70 hours of covert footage amassing evidence of hundreds of violations, Pete left the kennel.

After 9 months, the evidence was turned over to the U.S. Attorney's office in Little Rock, Arkansas where they began their own investigation.  On August 26, 2003, a joint federal task force raided the Martin Creek Kennel and rescued 125 out of 600 dogs.  Justice was agonizingly slow in coming.  Finally, in January 2005, the USDA settled the civil case.  C.C. Baird, his wife, and 2 daughters were charged with over 500 violations of the Animal Welfare Act.  His license was permanently revoked to buy and sell animals and he was fined $262,700, the largest fine ever imposed under the Animal Welfare Act.  However, the U.S. Attorney's criminal case was still ongoing.

Meanwhile, the Northeast Arkansans For Animals organization took the opportunity to prepare the previously rescued dogs for adoption.  This is the most rewarding and satisfying footage of the program as it showed the dogs being loved and cared for.  Every animal rescued from Martin Creek Kennel found a new home.

Further charges were brought against C.C Baird eight months later.  Baird surrendered 700 acres of his land including his home and kennel, all worth 1.1 million dollars.  He then surrendered $200,000 and paid $42,400 to animal rescue groups who cared for the animals seized in the 2003 raid.  In July of 2006, Baird was sentenced to 3 years supervised probation, 6 months home detention, and fined $7,500.

Looking back now, I'm glad the penalties in this case were so severe yet somehow I don't feel it was enough.  I think C.C. Baird should have done some serious jail time too but that's just my opinion.  My 5 star rating for this program is dedicated to publicizing the message of out of control dog dealing, the courage and perseverance of Last Chance For Animals, and final justice for the detestable Martin Creek Kennel.",1187136000,29,3513,4.989690721649485
