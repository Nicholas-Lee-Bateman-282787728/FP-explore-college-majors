8113827,4,B000ES3JCY,"I bought this movie because I had the chance to work a summer on a Great Lakes ore boat when I was in college and still a teen.  This movie is a fairly realistic portrayal of the kinds of men a college student is likely to meet, so it is interesting in that respect.  There isn't much story; just a collection of snippets of the lives of these seamen.",1157587200,3,351,4.072463768115942
