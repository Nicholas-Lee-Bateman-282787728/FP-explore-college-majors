8054288,5,B0007YYRV2,"I like this story and I'm retired! It is a good story for younger ones. The main character is spoiled something awful and he has to learn the hard way what work ethic is all about. Interestingly enough, there is a scene cut from the VHS tape that did air on television many years ago regards the knife that the boy bought from a drowned man's kit.",1367193600,,347,4.1940298507462686

I liked the part where the kid wakes up on deck under a sail and looks at his hands. Would be good to discuss with kids.

If you are a sailor you will enjoy finding mistakes in the action (for example when Dan asks to go over the side in  a dory, while the ship is beating in a fresh breeze of wind, which would have left him far behind with no hope of catching up), but that will in no way detract from the impact of the tale. A great yarn!",1337385600,,554,3.972972972972973

I liked the part where the kid wakes up on deck under a sail and looks at his hands. Would be good to discuss with kids in terms of work ethic and self awareness.

If you are a sailor you will enjoy finding mistakes and improbable events in the nautical action (""she's got  a bone in her teeth, and the kid is going over the side in a dory to FISH!? Why doesn't he just WATER SKI behind the schooner, and HARPOON as he goes?"") but that will in no way detract from the impact of the tale. A great yarn!",1337385600,,605,4.067226890756302
8054291,1,B0007YYRV2,"I ordered this TV version of ""Captains Courageous,"" and I was charged for this version. However, the version I received was the Spencer Tracey movie version. This was to be a gift for someone who already owns the Tracy movie version. This product is still being advertised as the TV version with Karl Malden, but know you may not receive what you ordered in this transaction. Hopefully, I get some type of response to this problem--I will update later if the seller, JTSMOVIES, responds and sends me the correct version in time for the holidays.... :(",1323302400,,551,4.75
