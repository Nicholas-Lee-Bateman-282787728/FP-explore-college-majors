It looked like you are watching form an old 1950's TV set. They also did not do the volumes in chronological order. 2 strikes against them earns a weaK 3 stars.",1391904000,,290,4.017241379310345
8051323,3,B0007TKFYU,"Volume 9 of Alpha Video's continuing series of ""Ramar of the Jungle"" DVD releases consists of four more episodes set in India.  In total, Alpha has released 12 of the 13 Indian episodes.  As always, Dr. Tom ""Ramar"" Reynolds (Jon Hall) and Professor Howard Ogden (Ray Montgomery) are back for plenty of jungle adventures, along with their local guide Zahir (Victor Millan).  Yes, the story lines are hokey and the acting sometimes borders on the amateurish, but if you grew up watching ""Ramar,"" the shows bring back some great memories.

The visual quality on these episodes is on a par with most of the other volumes in the series, save volumes 1 & 2, which are the best of the bunch.  The images are not as sharp and crisp as one would prefer and there is noticeable hiss on the audio track.  Still, the episodes are watchable and, despite their less than stellar presentation, Alpha has done an admirable job in making this early television series (1952-54) available to its Baby Boomer fan base.

One lingering question does remain . . . where is the 13th and final Indian episode?",1118793600,3,1084,4.673684210526316
