7113583,5,B00VX21UL2,I was very satisfied with the item I received. I was told that it would take between 3rd-28th and I was nervous because my items were Christmas presents. I got the items within a week!!!!,1294099200,,187,4.371428571428571
7113584,5,B00VX21UL2,"When one compares the various sitcoms presently airing on television to The Cosby Show, a remarkable difference is evident.  It is unknown whether this was the intent of the producers, but The Cosby Show family-centered storylines and themes clearly bespeak Christian values and morals. Throughout its various episodes, this sitcom not only teaches valuable life lessons, but also presents everyday family life in a way that nearly everyone... can relate to.  In episode 17 of season 6, for example, viewers, particularly children, learn a valuable lesson about stealing, confession, and honesty when Rudy ""borrows"" $2.30 from Claire's money and gets caught trying to return it.

While little to no direct reference to religion and/or Christianity is evident on The Cosby Show, upon examining the family values, ethics, and functions the sitcom portrays, it is clear that the Christian worldview is present.  The show clearly demonstrates the kind of monogamous relationship that ought to exist between a husband and wife through the example of Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable and his wife Claire, the grandparents, and in later episodes, draughts Sondra and her husband Elvin.  Sexual morality is upheld in that there are no displays of promiscuity and fornication, which nowadays is very rare.

The Cosby Show portrays ideals in family life, values, child-rearing, relationships, etc. that many people look up to.  The sitcom reflects Biblical principles in morality and acceptable behavior and demonstrates human value through the interactions of the family members with one another and with outside forces.",1292112000,3,1602,5.461538461538462
7113585,5,B00VX21UL2,"I ordered this set after growing tired of trying to track them down on YouTube. The Cosby Show is a quality show all-around, but I enjoy these seasons the best. They're just really funny. The addition of Pam, Lance, Charmaine & their friends help with that, as well the inclusion of the community center Theo was at. Those characters add something fresh to the show, because at that point, I find most of the Cosby kids, except for Theo, to be kind of annoying (not sure if that was the effect the writers were going for). The storyline with Dabnis, Vanessa's fiance, was good too. It's worth it for those episodes, the one where Rudy and her friends try to sneak into a club, and, of course, the series finale.",1291939200,,711,4.476923076923077

This was one of the best series of  family relationship that one could purchase on TV today.

There is something wrong with the sound channels, many times the left or right channel goes much fainter, I have noticed when there is a camera change, is also when the sounds cut low. It happens from Season 1 to about season 6. I watch this, along with Roseanne and Sinfeld, when I go to bed so I have head phones one. The other two TV shows has no issues with the sound, so I know it's not my DVD player. I am now watching the Cosby series again for the second time since I bought these, the sound is still an issue, it's very very annoying. I'm rather disappointed in that. So, with that, this is a review about the products, the physical product would only get something like a 1 star, the THE COSBY SHOW product, the show itself, certainly gets a 5 stars.",1355443200,,832,4.173913043478261

7113668,5,B00VX21UL2,"Bill Cosby is great and we are thankful to enjoy such talent! We wish that the Fatherhood cartoon would be released on DVD. Two seasons on Nick Nite (2004-2005 season run time and has been canceled). and twenty six episodes.. This was a great cartoon with values, please release this on DVD. And also Little Bill on DVD.

We own seasons 1-6 and we just purchased seasons seven and eight as we want our children to see what real T.V. and good T.V. shows really are and because we love this T.V. series, its clean fun and funny! Great for family laughs! We cut the cord on cable and now view TV though our DVD collection or watch though Netflix on our Roku. We just grew tired of paying for paid TV with nothing good to watch.

We read a review saying how this show used to be on Netflix and was for some reason taking off of Netflix, don't know why... But it is okay for us as we like to take our DVD's with us while on the road as it makes for some fun times. This has also come in handy when we are out and have to wait for long periods of time.. This happen recently and The Cosby Show saved the day! We started season one and before we knew it, it was time to go on to our next destination.

So back to the reason we went ahead and purchased this collection. Due to the garbage on T.V. these days, looks like many people are looking for great T.V. shows and are turning to shows like this again. Many people are tired of paying for trash T.V. so they have found other ways to view T.V. the way they want to. Looks like this is the growing attitudes with paid for TV these days.. And I know many like the Cosby show so it is in demand!

While shopping on Amazon we selected the used copy we wanted and while still shopping someone else purchased the copy we had in our cart so we lost that copy and had to select another copy that cost more. I guess that goes to show how great this show is, everyone is grabbing copies of it.(demand for this show is good)(which is good, because this should show producers that people really want to watch).

Anyway, our family loves this show and glad that we were still able to find a used copy for a decent price.. We don't want to spend too much money out of our budget. We are just glad to be able to watch T.V. the way we want to and not have to pay for crap TV. We are tired of today's T.V. shows.. It's really sad that such a good method of influence has turned into trash T.V with the exception of National Geo etc.. Any way, if you want clean T.V. this is it!

I can say since we cut cable off we have a better free life.. seems like we have more family time and time to do the things that we want to do. Plus we pay for the shows that we want like The Cosby show since it is not on Netflix. I am glad that this T.V. series is available on Amazon.

This T.V. Series teaches a lot of great lessons and also entertains you.. Miss those days of shows like this. So if you are looking for clean great family fun, this show is for you.. You will not be disappointed. Our children love this show! This show could even go for parental education!

Happy viewing! And if you are looking for more funny shows, don't for get The PJ's with Eddie Murphy, Martin show, My wife and Kids, Jamie Foxx show, and What's happening! Great shows, real T.V.

Shipping was as expected and we are in the process of viewing all the DVD's so we can see how they play!

7113670,5,B00VX21UL2,"I had never watched ""The Cosby Show"" until I got pregnant and my husband decided to start watching it on Netflix. I immediately loved it and wanted to watch the whole thing - all 8 seasons - before our baby was born. Well, that obviously didn't happen but we kept watching it even after our baby girl was born, until one day Netflix decided to remove ""The Cosby Show"" from the ""watch instantly"" feature and we had to stop. I was so frustrated that I decided I wanted to buy all 8 seasons of The Cosby Show - not only so that I could finish it, but also to be able to show it to my daughter when she's older! So, we purchased all 8 seasons and I'm so glad we did because we now own hours and hours of comedy that will always be timeless and entertaining.

Before I purchased from this seller, I looked at other sellers from which I could order the same product and have it shipped through Amazon Prime, however, their product was about $100.00 more expensive than from this seller, and it was the exact same product! Also, the shipping was faster than I expected and totally worth paying the $12.00 extra dollars. I'm very pleased with my purchase!",1331510400,,1147,4.334883720930232
