8217744,5,B000VAFNAQ,"This is a remarkable set from this master jazz musician. Anyone who appreciates excellent straight-up jazz will find this recording to be completely satisfying.

A clarification on this. This is actually the companion DVD for the Dexter Gordon Live in Iowa - which is equally incredible! The Maintenance Shop was a club that was located in Ames, Iowa - not San Francisco as the company mistakenly identifies. These 2 sets were part of a series that was broadcast on National Public television in late 1979 and throughout 1980. Other performers in the series - playing 2 sets each - were the Bill Evans Trio with Marc Johnson on bass & Joe Labarbera on drums; the Phil Woods Quartet; the Great Guitars and the Woody Shaw Qunitet. All but the Shaw sets were originally released on VHS in the early-to-mid-nineties.

Hopedully, this company will strive to release the other performances in the Maintenance Shop series - especially the Shaw sets whose quintet at the time included Vitor Lewis on drums and the late Carter Jefferson on tenor sax.

These 2 Dexter sets come highly recommended.",1343779200,3,1087,4.896739130434782
8217745,5,B000VAFNAQ,"While the video quality isn't the best, the audio is quite good(not perfect though for audiophiles).  The performance is hypnotizing and Dexter's sax is soothing.  While it's only 4 songs (maybe 5) the performance is quite long.",1326153600,,228,5.135135135135135
8217746,5,B000VAFNAQ,"Dexter Gordon and his support players (George Cables on piano, Rufus Reid bass, Eddie Gladen drums) all perform at their best here.  This DVD contains more pieces from the same 1979 concert at San Francisco's Maintenance Shop that was released by Rhapsody Films as The Dexter Gordon Quartet.  That's right--more pieces, not the same ones.  And the notes on the back provide a little more detail than on the old VHS tape.  If you enjoyed Dexter Gordon's music, or his performance in Round Midnight, then this is for you.  He was one of the great bebop tenor sax players.",1264982400,2,569,4.707070707070707
