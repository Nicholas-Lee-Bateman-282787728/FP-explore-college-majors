8735681,5,B0165BJCS8,"I don't know why people are criticizing this movie so much, looks like Asians think way different then us. I watched the movie tonight and I was very impress, I really didn't thought I was going to like it that much. Movie was funny, kind of sad also and very entertaining. I'm definitely going to watch it again with the nephews.",1460505600,,330,4.426229508196721
8735682,1,B0165BJCS8,"Most ridiculous movie I've seen in a while , especially given that this movie was the highest grossing in China? Take fluffy cg creatures, mixed with the dumbest bunch of human characters, mix it well with sophomoric jokes and cheap kung fu fights ( basically that's the extent of action in this movie)  in a laboriously long and dull story and you have a Chinese blockbuster that only Chinese will enjoy. Actually the best part of this movie is the absolutely ridiculous and nonsensical English sub-title. I swear every connected with it must have been high on opium because it is so laughably incoherent. I guess when you live in a country devoid of much joy (I think that's a fair assessment from my many trips there) , surrounded by grubby environment, I see why the Chinese are so eager to escape into a childish fantasy world, no matter how silly or stupid it is.",1457222400,,869,4.606451612903226

8735684,1,B0165BJCS8,Absolutely Terrible ... That this is the #1 grossing film in Chinese history is.. ?????? what up China ?,1452729600,,104,4.526315789473684
