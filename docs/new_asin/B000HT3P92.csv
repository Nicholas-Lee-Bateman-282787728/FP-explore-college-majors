2643380,5,B000HT3P92,"I quite enjoyed the movie, I don't get the reviews put up here. Who Made the Potato salad was a valid comedic joke that I've heard alot at dinners and black gatherings!! haha i'm laughin now. I go around asking randomly ""Who Made the Potato Salad"".

Anyway about the movie. It's basically Guess Who's Coming to Dinner/Guess who (newer updated version) except instead of it being a black guy or white guy (Guess who-Ashton Kutcher) it's a copper! aka 5.0 aka Pig (in the moive) aka Shaft (in the movie) aka Po-Po aka Urkel (Jaleel White). haha It's sorta he's dorky but uppity meeting the slightly ghetto family of his fiancees. The mom in Boomerang who makes the chittlins is in it. Her part stood out the most and I was on the floor laughing at her and her husband (comedian from Comic view with the red hair. He also played the dad of the guy who Debo stole the bike from in the First Friday movie)

I'll have to watch it again b/c I didn't knwo it was a Thanksgiving setting.

Ummm there should be jokes for everyone in this movie. I thought the first scene was hilarious. The plastic cover on the couch was funny (you can relate to that right!)

Ummm there's two parts that might make it uncomfortable to watch with your folks. The cursing (yeah I agree very excessive and the n-word) and then Jaleel waking up with a morning w--d. (i laughed at that b/c that's relatable

Check out this movie and also check out the new movie ""the salon"" (probably should buy that)",1189987200,,1469,4.425925925925926
2643381,3,B000HT3P92,"I enjoyed this movie.  I was glad to see Jaleel White acting again. It's not a block buster, but good for DVD and funny too!",1179360000,,124,3.96
2643382,3,B000HT3P92,"I saw this movie and thought it was real cute and funny. I'm not surprised to see Jaleel White still accepting roles that still links him to Steve Urkel, but I guess you can take what you can get when you aren't really starring in great roles. I was waiting for him to say ""DID I DO THAAAAT!!!"". Otherwise, it was pretty good. There were some stupid moments, but I would add it to my DVD collection.",1178409600,7,399,4.194805194805195
2643383,1,B000HT3P92,"but did he check the script before he agreed to this project? this was worst than ""carmen: the hip-oprea"" (featuring beyonce)! and i bet it's in the 10 cent bargin bin with the movie ""the seat filler"" (also featuring deRay davis)

no one in this movie had any chemistry between them. every 7th word was peppered with profanity. i did not laugh once and actually found myself cheering because it was finally over.

the plot is thin and thoughtless. the cast is corny and catastrophic.

unless you've been imprisoned for the last 12 years and are forced to watch this, i wouldn't suggest that you waste your time, money or energy on this film.",1170633600,,641,4.605263157894737

Clifton Powell is the mini James brown of the film game,Bro man is in everything. Ella Joyce is still thick like a Sweet Potatoe Pie YES LAWWDD!!  Reynaldo Rey(Red) is a Fool he cracks me up,but this film on a whole just seemed thrown together&never gets going.",1165708800,4,412,4.421052631578948

Is not a word in their vocabulary. Movies about meeting the in-laws are not new, but few are this funny. This urban comedy dishes out the laughs and a scene-stealing performance by Eddie Griffin. Dysfunctional has rarely been so much fun.",1163980800,3,514,4.586956521739131

2643418,5,B000HT3P92,"Seems like a lot of people expected a wholesome, heartwarming drama and were disappointed that it was basically the opposite. Uh, the fact that this movie went straight to DVD and the ""R"" rating should be a dead giveaway. People, the internet exists for a reason, I suggest using it to determine whether or not a movie will be suitable for your personal morals.

Anyway, onto the review...

Let me just say that this movie is worth watching for Deray's character alone. The first scene he's in is so funny I nearly spit blueberry snapple onto my laptop. Yeah okay, this movie is DEFINITELY ghetto. So if you aren't prepared for some blatant stereotypical black humor than I suggest staying away. At the same time, this movie is not nearly as bad as most Tyler Perry movies/shows when it comes to stereotypical black characters so take it for what it's worth.

If you liked Friday, then you'll probably like this movie. I would classify this as ""Friday Lite,"" as it's clearly not anywhere near as good as Friday, but it will still provide some good entertainment and laughs.

Again, if you're looking for fun-loving entertainment for the whole family, watch Cosby Show re-runs. If you want to watch a funny ass black comedy that holds no punches, this is the movie for you.",1286668800,,1272,4.690582959641255
2643419,4,B000HT3P92,"This movie may come across as a ""generic film"" in which it may to some, but the old ""Erckel"" is just as funny as he was when he was younger and now as a grown man.

2643420,5,B000HT3P92,this was great movie that whole family can watch together it's action pack & VERY funny..glad that it was brand new in original wrapping..only thing i would change about this transaction is to get the package within 72hours..,1270598400,,225,4.947368421052632
2643421,4,B000HT3P92,I thought it was soo funny and sweet. Between the cop hating father and low life brother could drive any man crazy,1269129600,,114,4.2272727272727275

2643423,1,B000HT3P92,"I wish you could give this movie a negative rating! I must confess that I was an Jaleel White (Erkel) fan from way back and thought that this would be a great movie to watch during the Thanksgiving holiday with my family even though I had never heard of the movie before. Well, first of all the language was so bad that no one underage should be watching it. The characters consisted of every negative stereo-type in the book and the writing stunk!! We watched about half way through and felt ashamed of ourselves for wasting that much time on such useless drivel!! We didn't care who made the potato salad--ALL WE WANTED WAS OUR MONEY BACK FOR THIS ROTTEN MOVIE!!",1231286400,,664,4.4958677685950414

2643425,4,B000HT3P92,"THIS MOVIE WAS OK.  ITS A GHETTO VERSION OF THE MOVIE ""SOULFOOD"". THE ACTING COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER, BUT OVERALL THE MOVIE WAS FUNNY AND WATCHABLE.  IF YOU ARE A FAN OF LOW BUDGET MOVIES, THIS IS A GREAT ONE TO ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION.",1214956800,,234,4.177777777777778
2643426,2,B000HT3P92,"I thought this movie was very low budget, however, still funny.  It wasn't side cracking funny, but being as though this may be true to life families somewhere in this country (not mine), that just made it more hilairous.  I've seen the movie quite a few times and still manage to get some good laughs in.",1213574400,,305,4.428571428571429
2643427,4,B000HT3P92,"I rented this movie prior to ordering it.  Not really being a fan of so-called comedies....I can honestly say that I found this movie to be funny. I expected to see an overgrown ""Urkel"" but was pleasantly surprised by Jaleel White's performance.  He was funny but not over the top nerdy. I am somewhat surprised that many people did not find the film funny or maybe I am surprised that I actually found it to be funny. I have to agree with the reviewer's comments that the film is stereotypical but I have not found one comedy yet that is not.  As I previously stated, I am not much for comedies but this one did make me laugh and I think that all of the characters were pretty funny.  Maybe it would be better to recommend that you rent it first (though I will definitely watch it again).",1196726400,3,789,4.3108108108108105

8141438,4,B000HT3P92,"This movie came out in 2006, which was ten years ago, and it's still a good movie to watch with Jaleel White. I have this movie stored in a zip-loc bag with the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th season of the show Family Matters with Jaleel White on the DVD sets, and I also have eight seasons of Family Matters on the DVD sets with Jaleel White. That's a show Jaleel White is best known for as a main character playing (Steve Urkel), and it's my all-time favorite show with him. And I would watch this movie with Jaleel White, after watching him from the eight seasons of Family Matters that I just like and have on the DVD sets. There is also a 9th season of Family Matters, which is the very last season with Jaleel White, but I don't like that season for a simple reason, so I wouldn't have the 9th season of Family Matters on the DVD set to watch before watching this movie. The first eight seasons is good enough for me to watch along with this movie anyway, and Family Matters is still my all-time favorite show to watch with Jaleel White. And that show with him brings back good memories. And instead of me even watching the 9th season of Family Matters that I don't like, I would also watch this movie with Jaleel White. I find this movie and the first eight seasons of Family Matters with Jaleel White is a great collection for me to have and watch all together. And I do have this movie added with the first eight seasons of Family Matters that I just like and have on the DVD sets.

This movie even shows Jaleel White getting married to his girlfriend in the last scene, which was a good thing for him. And this movie with Jaleel White now started to even remind me of a Christmas movie from last year in 2015 and from the Lifetime channel, and that Christmas movie is called ""The Flight Before Christmas."" And two other main characters from the show Family Matters with Jaleel White stars in that movie, and it's shows them being married just like in Family Matters. I do find this movie with Jaleel White is just like that Christmas movie from the Lifetime channel, because it's about a young couple being on a plane and going to spend a Christmas vacation. And this movie shows Jaleel White and his girlfriend going to a spend a vacation together. So I would pretend or make believe that this movie is ""The Flight Before Christmas"", even though it's not a Christmas movie or the real thing.

I started to type a review on this movie and on 7/13/2016, and today is 12/1/2016. It's even Christmas time, and I actually even have this movie wrapped up with the first eight seasons of Family Matters that I just like and have on the DVD sets as a Christmas present to myself, and I just know that I'll enjoy watching this movie and the eight seasons of Family Matters with Jaleel White, after opening them up on Christmas morning.",1468368000,,2829,4.366223908918406
