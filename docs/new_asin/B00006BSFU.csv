1741584,4,B00006BSFU,"A few little things could be better...

1st, Only one of the episodes is even remotely Christmas related, which is fine.  But since the kids will want to watch the others for the rest of the year, and I can see being a little annoyed at watching the holiday episode in May, I think it would've been nice for this episode to be the last, or to have an option to play the others without this one.

Another thing I didn't care for was all of the advertisements at the beginning.  I wonder if this really sells anything???  All we ever do is hit the search button several times to get through them all.

One wonderful thing about this DVD compared to other Dora DVD we have is that you CAN play all the episodes with just one button, instead of having to go into a sub-menu to get to the Bonus episodes (too much for a 2 year old to do on their own).

The Christmas episode is fine and fun to watch during the holidays.  Two of the other three are fine, but the ""Quack Quack"" episode where Dora and Boots jump into a coloring book is a little strange... even my 3 year old thinks so.  Not bad, just... not quite right.  I wouldn't recommend this as a first Dora DVD (Meet Diego or Super Silly Fiesta, for example, are much better for overall content).",1103760000,17,1247,4.201680672268908
1741585,5,B00006BSFU,"Great little tape with all the regular dora features,  my 1 1/2 year old granddaughter was mesmorized.  I wish i would have waited and got it at Target as I paid $14.99 @ blockbuster.",1037923200,6,183,4.352941176470588
1741586,5,B00006BSFU,"The Christmas Episode features which Backstreet Boy voicing Santa? Howie Dourough!!! It's true!! You should hear how he sings ""Feliz Navidad""(made famous by Jose Feliciano)!! Santa even gets a present from Dora and Boots!!",1033171200,19,222,5.5588235294117645
1741593,1,B00006BSFU,I was VERY dissapointed to see that only the first episode was about christmas. i thought i was buying a dora christmas movie or atleast 3-4 episodes about christmas!!!!,1194048000,2,169,4.862068965517241
1741594,5,B00006BSFU,this is excellent for teaching children how to get along with other children.,1169164800,,77,5.0
1741595,4,B00006BSFU,"My kids have this video and they love it.  Especially my daughter.  My son still hides away in his bedroom to watch it.  Everyone is right about it being one little Christmas episode but it's cute.  The only thing I didn't care much for was how Howie Dorough of the Backstreet Boys portrayed Santa Claus.  He used the stereotypical ""mexican"" slang accent and as the mother of half hispanic children, I found it almost offensive.  Even my son pointed out that Mexicans don't talk like that.",1160611200,2,489,4.627906976744186
1741596,5,B00006BSFU,"Our 2 year old absolutely adores Dora.  This Christmas DVD is her favorite and she watches it over and over again all year round.  We love the fact that Dora is a positive cartoon female role model for our daughter.

Our family sings the songs over and over again in English and Spanish and we run around the house together playing our own version of ""Swiper No Swiping"".  We substitute our daughter's name (Keysha) for Dora and sing ""Keysha, Keysha, Keysha the Explorer"" etc.

We own nearly every Dora video even though we live in Singapore.  I'm sure one day Keysha will grow out of Dora but for now, she's absolutely delighted.  That, of course, makes us happy parents.",1147305600,,672,4.5966386554621845
1741597,3,B00006BSFU,Since this DVD shows a Christnas themed picture on the cover it would have been great to have 4 Christmas themed episodes. All the episodes on this DVD(including the one Christmas episode) have been shown on the Dora TV series. We all know that Dora has a baby brother and sister but since they were first introduced this spring they have only been in 3-4 episodes. The Dora series needs to have some new life breathed into it. Even my 27 month granddaughter is beginning to tire of the same episodes being shown constantly.,1135123200,,524,4.585106382978723
1741598,4,B00006BSFU,"The Christmas episode (yes, just one) is good, but I have to empathically agree with the other folks who think that ""Quack, Quack"" is weird.  My kids just say ""that's silly"" and ignore that they're jumping into a coloring book world.  In some shows, that wouldn't seem to be strange (in Magic School Bus, for example, that would be a very tame field trip), but for Dora it just seems ""wrong"".  Anyway, the others are fine but not the best episodes.  Our favorite Dora DVD remains ""Meet Diego"" because of the animal focus.",1132963200,4,521,4.56989247311828
1741599,3,B00006BSFU,"Only 1 episode (regular length) is Christmas related, and the other 3 are just regular Dora shows. With tivo, we have plenty of Dora episodes already recorded, so this really was just $12 for a short Dora Christmas show.",1131840000,9,220,4.666666666666667
1741600,3,B00006BSFU,"Can't tell yet, because it will be for christmas gift, after that I can rate it...",1129507200,,82,4.1875
1741601,5,B00006BSFU,"This dvd offers four Dora cartoons, one of which being a Christmas themed episode. The Santa episode is very cute and sweet, one of the best Dora episodes I have seen! Even Swiper is a sweetie in this show! My three year old was enthralled with this dvd and asked to watch it repeatedly during the Christmas season. It is a great addition to our family dvd collection.

I do agree with another reviewer who wrote that the 'Quack Quack' episode is weird. I agree, it is definitely not one of the best. However, the Santa show was so great it makes up for the shortcomings of the other. :)",1105315200,14,587,4.336363636363636

7967012,4,B00006BSFU,"I purchased this DVD for a friends' daughter, who is almost five.  She is a HUGE Dora the Explorer fan.  She LOVES this DVD.  I gave it to her as a Christmas present and her mother told me that she's already watched it dozens of times.  FYI only one episode on this DVD include a Christmas theme.",1431561600,,296,4.140350877192983

7967014,5,B00006BSFU,Purchased for my daughter who absolutely loved it!  She enjoys Dora very much and enjoys her stories!  She is outgrowing it a bit now but I can pass to my grandkids! Thanks!,1393632000,,173,4.375
7967015,2,B00006BSFU,"This Christmas DVD did not keep my daughter's attention, like some of the others.  She's a Dora fan but I would have to give this one a thumbs down.",1358380800,,148,4.103448275862069
7967016,3,B00006BSFU,"My son loves watching Dora so I wanted to get him a Dora Christmas movie for him to enjoy over the holidays.  However there is only one short Christmas episode, about 15 minutes long, and the rest is just normal Dora episodes.  The Dora episodes are fine, I just wouldn't really call this a Christmas film.  It has one short Christmas episode.",1320883200,,343,4.5
7967017,5,B00006BSFU,I ordered this DVD to replace a VHS that as totally wore out.  I was surprised to receive this DVD without the bar code on it.  I wondered if it was a pirate DVD.,1300320000,,162,3.735294117647059

7967019,4,B00006BSFU,"We purchased when our youngest were 2 and 3 and they are still watching now that they are 4 and 5.  Truly stood the test of time.  Probably the favorite of the Dora movies.  They don't watch the others much any more, but they love this one.",1200528000,,240,4.0638297872340425
