8060403,5,B0009GV9BO,"If you get a kick out of LBJ chewing someone out over the phone or talking
about the Snobby Kennedy's this is the product for you.
Super interesting conversations.  Some are the most historical things we will
ever hear and some are just hilarious.
That deep southern drawl  coming  from a giant. A giant litterally and politically.
Say what they want, Johnson and even Nixon on tape is facinating to listen to.",1358035200,,410,4.666666666666667

8060405,5,B0009GV9BO,"This is popular history done right, a useful tool for the uninitiated.  With a little more budget for production values (to rid us of those cheesy re-enact scenes...how about footage from the LBJL folks...there's lots of it) this could have been a national treasure.  For the real deal I also recommend The American Experience 2 dvd set LBJ...but this is a great starting point. I view it about once every 6 months and it's always refreshing and revealing.",1232064000,4,456,4.833333333333333
8060406,5,B0009GV9BO,It's almost unbelievebale that we can eaves drop on the president of the United States! This set of DVD's opens up a whole new light on the Johnson presidency. I knew he was rough around the edges but never dreamed he was so full of hate and paranoia! Every moment of these tapes is as intriguing as any mystery novel or movie ever made.,1197763200,3,337,4.28125
8060407,5,B0009GV9BO,"Face it, there is something about LBJ that no other President had.  These tapes are integral to the person who is after the real meaning and intent behind what LBJ was saying.  The written word does not get across the emotions of what is being said or felt.  This clears up many subjects from the man and the position, he was a great manipulator.",1131321600,7,346,4.375
