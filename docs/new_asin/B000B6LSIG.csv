2711096,2,B000B6LSIG,"When this program aired originally in 1956-1957, there were twenty six episodes, each 28 minutes in length. That is 11 hours of show.
The series has been ""edited"" to 6 hours on this DVD set. This ""editing"" also lacks finesse. Is some AIR POWER better than none? I leave that decision to you, the potential buyer. Simply consider yourself warned.",1322265600,,345,4.766666666666667
2711097,3,B000B6LSIG,I remember the shows being better than the ones on this DVD. The lack of the introduction music puts it into a category below Victory at Sea. The shows have been edited which also lessens the value of the shows. I would still recommend it.,1315267200,,239,4.333333333333333
2711098,1,B000B6LSIG,"The other reviewers are, unfortunately, correct - some of the most dramatic parts are cut or misplaced. For me, in particular, is the final portion of the Ploesti segment. If my fading memory serves me, the original ended with an ominous comment by Cronkite that now (rather than using and losing so many crew, planes and bombs) ""one plane , one pilot and one bomb"" would do the job and eliminate the target. And, having been an engine mechanic on those huge 28 cylinder, R-4360 radial engines (during the 60's) I also miss the engine start that began each episode.",1295308800,,565,4.66
2711099,5,B000B6LSIG,"ARRIVED IN PROMPT ORDER, WELL PACKAGED. PROBLEM WITH WHOEVER PACKAGED THE PRODUCT i.e. CBS.. Opening and closing of program not what I remember. Episodes jammed together.",1247184000,,170,5.576923076923077
2711100,4,B000B6LSIG,Just as I remembered it. The dulcet tones of Walter Kronkite and some amazing footage,1209168000,,85,4.733333333333333
2711101,5,B000B6LSIG,"With this series and a copy of Victory at Sea you will have every foot of 16mm film of WWII aviation that you could ever possibly want. Also, the bonus video on the P-47, P51, B-17, B-24 and RAF and Luftwaffe is tremendous. A wonderful compilation of WWII Aviation History.",1193616000,,273,4.48
2711102,4,B000B6LSIG,"I have been a major collector of WW 2 films.  In fact, I had my own home movie theatre where I showed 16mm  films in a 15 seat setting.  I owned original prints of Victory at Sea, Battle Line, Biography (with a young Mike Wallace narrating), World at War and others.  However, I found it very difficult to find one of my favorite series aired in 1956, AIR POWER.  What I remembered the most was the beautiful opening and the music by the CBS Orchestra. I love seeing the complete film of any series, including opening and closings and the related credits. Unfortunately, the edited films available now (either on tape or DVD) have rearranged the original series and  only at  the beginning of each tape or DVD does it show the opening shots of the planes and the original theme music.  That is what I miss, but otherwise, it was one of the finest docs ever produced on the WW2 planes and their effect on the outcome of the war.",1170288000,,927,4.380116959064328
2711103,5,B000B6LSIG,"The first thing you need to know about this film is ""WALTER CRONKITE""!  Just the fact that hes on it makes it worth the price! Everything you could possibly want to know about the planes that flew in WWI is here! Its the best documentary on this subject I've ever seen!",1158278400,,269,4.2745098039215685
2711104,5,B000B6LSIG,"This is by far the best Documentary Series of World War II.  The whole series is narrated by Walter Cronkite, delivered superbly in only the way Cronkite does, outstanding.  It has not a dull moment, and shows how Air Power destroyed Germany and Japan.  It has excellent plane camera views and informative map illustrations.  This is Walter Cronkite's best work, ever.",1154217600,,368,4.983606557377049
2711105,1,B000B6LSIG,"With great excitement I sat down to view this DVD, one of my all-time favorite documentaries. I was extremely disappointed to find, that in my favorite segment: The Liberation of France, the final scene had been cut! It was the best scene in the whole series. The beautiful footage of two flights of Thunderbolts, criss-crossing above the Arch de Triomphe was missing! These documentaries are works of art. You can't cut the last scene of one anymore than you could with Gone With The Wind. What were these guys thinking? I'm returning my set. I refuse to support such insensitive and indiscriminate editing and I urge others to do the same.",1090800000,,641,4.783783783783784
2711106,5,B000B6LSIG,Great reminder of what air power the United States had in World War II. This story of Air Power should be re-shown on TV to remind people of the great price in lives and suffering shown by the American servicemen and women in this war. Great DVD!,1063411200,,246,4.25531914893617
2711107,5,B000B6LSIG,"The dramatic script and musical score will quickly expose the age of this documentary, but in many ways it remains a timeless set with excellent footage narrated by Walter Cronkite.  It reflects some of the ""air power won the war!"" attitude of the immediate post-war decades, but it is also fairly balanced and despite being funded by the Air Force it does not disregard the Navy.  It suffers, as all air power documentaries seem to, from some historically inaccurate editing (e.g., VIII Bomber Command Liberators seemingly bombing Rabaul), but much of the footage is true to the locations and/or events that are being described, making it a must-have for the WWII or Aviation enthusiast.  This is predominantly a history of US air power, but footage includes aircraft from all the major combatants, including some great German and Japanese clips (most likely taken from wartime propaganda reels). Don't let the age of these episodes delude you...in my opinion a finer series has yet to be done.",946944000,,995,5.0181818181818185
2711108,5,B000B6LSIG,"Military documentaries continue to be popular.  This one was done in the mid-50's as a counterpoint to the popular VICTORY AT SEA series done earlier in that decade.  The slant this time is victory through airpower.  Both shows had unequaled drama in their compelling use of literate  narration, dramatic combat scenes, and memorable music.  The editing in  both series was masterful.  This program was originally 30 minutes long and  deals with a major aviation themes of World War II, including Ploesti,  Schweinfurt, the Battle of Britain, and many others.  The Air Force ate it  up, considering how the Navy's story got such a public realtions boost from  VICTORY.  Although is is now 40 years old is it is still first  class.
Documentaries today lack the emotion and literate narration this  series offered.  To understand why Air Power maintains such an important  position in the American pysche you must see this series.  This is a must  for those that love aviation.",943228800,,975,4.98125

8162460,5,B000B6LSIG,this series should be interesting to anyone interested in the history of aviation,1497916800,,81,5.3076923076923075
8162461,5,B000B6LSIG,I purchased this DVD as a replacement for a video cassette version.  These DVD's are an excellent source for military history.,1494374400,,126,5.0
8162462,5,B000B6LSIG,"It may not be perfect, as other reviewers have written, but it's pretty darn good and it's the old Air Power that I remember from the late 1950s, the same old CBS documentary that made me decide at an early age that I, too, wanted to be a part of US Air Force Air Power.  Having retired as a Lt. Col. and flying as a pilot during my 21-year USAF career, I look at these old Air Power programs and project myself back to when I watched these as a ten-year-old, secure in the fact that these shows sparked a dream and that I was able to make my dream of being an Air Force pilot come true.",1457827200,,587,3.9745762711864407
8162463,5,B000B6LSIG,Only on VHS here so drawback and you have to have a VCR. Did tell a story I always heard that seemed a victory for the Allies the raid on Ploesti where I think a lot of guys got a medal. They had to go back many times to finish the deal. Being a fan that Air Power wins wars or is the most instrumental  part in that victory I enjoyed this and will continue to enjoy this. And the Price for it was great.,1398729600,,404,3.7529411764705882
8162464,5,B000B6LSIG,"Great information from the best in reporting. Every History teacher should have this in their library. If you love military history, this is a must buy.",1398038400,,152,4.884615384615385
8162465,3,B000B6LSIG,"Badly edited, but fun for war buffs! Gives a view of the airwar, but lacks examination of the actual aircraft.",1391299200,,110,4.55
8162466,3,B000B6LSIG,"Cronkite's timeless narrative is here in all its stentorian '50s style as he takes you back to an era close to the second World War when airpower and television journalism were both still young and unjaded.  Unfortunately, Richard Rodgers' sweeping score, which I remember being played in its full majesty during the introduction and the credits when this was broadcast, is only present as background to the narrative. So I'm still looking for some way to re-experience what I saw so many years ago.  But perhaps one just can't go back.",1369699200,,536,4.8791208791208796
8162467,5,B000B6LSIG,I remember watching the original series on television in the late 50s. Very informative and so many of the particiapants were still alive to lend credibility to the shows.,1355270400,,171,4.931034482758621
