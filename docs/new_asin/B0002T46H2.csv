I'm rating it 4/5 because at 35 min it's a bit short; I guess buying the series makes it better value.",1109116800,,380,4.205479452054795
8174874,5,B0002T46H2,"I enjoyed this beginners level dvd. Pretty easy to follow for people that have never done salsa in their life. I find it difficult to understand how it can receive a bad rating and be on a salsa video review website in the ""whats hot"" column. It's very contradicting. However, i do believe is a good instructional video for beginners.",1108771200,,334,4.583333333333333

There are so many bad points for this dvd I do not know where to start.
At 35 minutes it is way too short for a good value dvd today.
The teachers bad technique & knowledge of Salsa & Cuban dancing is an embarrassment.
I would not let these teachers out of a beginners class.
Do not bother to buy. There are other far better instructional Salsa dvd's being sold on Amazon.",1108512000,,415,4.402597402597403
