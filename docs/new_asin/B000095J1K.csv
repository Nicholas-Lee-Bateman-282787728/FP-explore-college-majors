1879252,5,B000095J1K,"Dave Chappelle's humor is one of a kind.  You won't find this comedic act yelling and screaming to get your attention.  This show will keep you wanting more because Dave tells his tales like it is.  From the whole Sesame Street gang to sex and drugs, where does he come up with this stuff?  I've seen Dave in many small movie roles such as Blue Streak and Men in Tights, but I think Killin' Them Softly shows his strong talents.  I've been waiting for this DVD to come out a long time and am happy to see it be available soon.  There is no comparing Chappelle to Chris Rock, Bernie Mac or Chris Tucker, this guy is on his own level.",1053302400,6,632,4.181818181818182

I understand that Dave Chappelle has now become a classic comedy icon but you're not going to have to pay this price for any of Eddie Murphy or Richard Pryors DVDs.

Or maybe I'm missing something here because the set I bought only had one DVD in it, which was his HBO special, which contained all of the jokes that were described in the description or is there a new release out that comes with more than just one disc in it?

Ever since Half Baked I've been a fan so when I saw this in the new release section back in 2003 I decided to buy it.  I hadn't seen him perform live so I had no clue really if I'd like it.  Like is not the word I'd use to describe how I feel about this DVD!  I knew immediately he was going to be BIG! I wasn't wrong!

The man is HILARIOUS from beginning to end.  Not since Eddie Murphy's Delirious have I laughed so hard.  This is before Chappelle Show, when he was just Dave.  He goes through a variety of subjects, some of them the  usual topics comedians use like race & relationships but he delivers it with this amazing amount of thought and intelligence behind it and in a way that is so fearless. You know its his own genuine thoughts and he's just being who he is, which don't see often these days. I have seen this DVD dozens of times and it never gets old.  It's still relevant 6 years later and just as funny as the first time I saw it. I do have his other stand up DVD and I have to say its good but but it can't touch Killin' Em Softly.

What really differentiates Chappelle from other comedians, something I don't often see mentioned in his evaluations, is his nack for subtle humor. Although his material is outrageous in concept, his delivery is what makes it so brilliant. He throws in little words here and there, facial expressions, and masterfully realized impressions that are all made with such a laid-back delivery. It's subtle. He captures emotions.

Almost everything he talks about in this will keep you laughing. It may be the typical things an African-American comedian might talk about, but it is down right hilarious the way Dave presents it.

My favorites would be:

- Taped 9-1-1 call - ""Help! Help Mutha F**ka They Comin' Ta Get Me!""

- Ditched in the Ghetto - ""Hey Baby! Baby go home... what the F**k are you doin' up!""

- Discovering old shows - ""B***H I LIVE IN A F**KING TRASH CAN""

- Clinton/Bush/First Black presidency (By far the best one)

- Chivalry

55 minutes of sheer hysteria in one stand up by one man. Of course getting the DVD would be good, but I would actually recommend downloading it because of quick access to it. With a DVD you have to put it in the computer or DVD player and wait to then play it, but when you have it already on your computer you can just run it with a media player.

1879398,4,B000095J1K,"Many comedians have a schtick: some rant about their wives, others rant about society and government, others use voice talents, even one rants about Starbucks. For Dave Chappelle, as well as many other black comedians, he tends to focus on the difference between blacks and whites. Despite it being hilarious, it's also ""safe"" in a weird way, as if you're not going to be shocked and offended, it's just ""the Dave we know and love"".

Many stories, some quite hiliarious are present here. My favorite is his discovery of just how bad some of our favorite children shows are, complete with some impersonations of characters on Sesame Street. There's many others including his white friend managing to escape jail time, a night in a limousine, and some jabs at the Clinton and Lewinsky scandal.

Where it falls slightly flat(it's still funny though) is the ""see, black people don't do that ****"" stuff, since it's essentially rampant in every black comedian's repertoire such as Chris Rock. It's not as funny when you've heard it many other times by Chris Rock or Bernie Mac or D.L Hughley or any of the others.

One unfortunate thing about this disc is that it's an hour long. It's actually 55 minutes but considering the price on here, it's pretty good but instead of let's say combining 2 comedy gigs they just show one so it's much better to rent or just surf HBO every weekend.

Only a coloured person like him can permit himself racial jokes. But presented by him, relaxed, you have to laugh - nevertheless if you are black or white, asian or latino. He only feigns the hysteria, mocks the enthusiasm, leading suburbian street subcultures back to the roots of reason. I like his joke ""Who are the scariest people? White guys in black gangs. No telling what they did to get respect."" In ""Killin' Them Softly"" he creates sketches of the church child up to the drugs consumer, of the ""Sesame Street"" up to the government, really about everything, which seems to be ""typically American"": So his brain-work is a wonderful help for Europeans, not to take too seriously the USA ...",1135468800,4,922,4.841772151898734

1879413,2,B000095J1K,"Nothing but stereotypical african american humor that we've heard a billion times before- how many more comedians can do the same bits on cops, that ""white-voice"" imitation, racism, and differences between whitesa and blacks- come on already, it's the same jokes over and over and over again- I like Chapelle but think he's given way too much credit",1122422400,5,349,5.0344827586206895
1879414,4,B000095J1K,This dvd was full of laughs and Dave Chappelle humour. It is a type of humour that celebrates difference between people in a way that white and black people can both laugh and enjoy. Very entertaining,1121731200,3,200,4.583333333333333
1879415,4,B000095J1K,"I want to start by saying this HBO special introduced me to Dave Chapelle. Actually the movie Con Air did, but this was my first exposure to him as a standup comedian. I love this guy's comedy. I love it! He cracks me and my girlfriend up whenever he appears on a tv screen.

That being said, while Dave Chapelle is very funny, no doubt, I think it's a stretch calling his material ""genius"". I find his comedy to be original, smart and frankly a roll-around-laughing-hilarious, yet essentially derivative of every single solitary African-American stand up comic I've ever seen, i.e. the bulk of his ""genius"" material consists of anecdotes and jabs with the sole purpose of belittling Caucasians, ""Killin' them softly"".

In the two hours he talks his talk I can safely say most of it was painting whites as the racist morons of society, doing it in that white-person's mock voice that ALL ""genius"" black comedians do (y'know, as if we all talk like anal news anchormen or stoned surfers). While he does it in his own playful way, and one should know he isn't serious, you couldn't honestly say that his brand of comedy is 100% new. Show me a black comedian that doesn't rip on white people to get a cheap laugh and I'll show you something you've never seen before.

Still his comedy makes me cry with laughter, I own Chapelle's Show first season on DVD and can't wait for the next one. I watch his show on Comedy Central (when it isn't a rerun, which means these days I don't), so don't go calling me bitter because he makes white jokes. I laugh at them as much as the black guys do. I think he's great, and seems to be approachable to anyone from any background. I know he's a decent guy. So take it easy before you click on how this didn't help you (even though you don't need help). I'm only making an argument for the ""reviews"" before mine that hail him as a comic ""genius"". That's extreme. If he could make an audience laugh without a single joke about Caucasians, and was still as funny as he is... then I'd have no argument. Until then he's just very, very funny and you should buy this DVD nonetheless.",1098403200,16,2109,4.458549222797927
1879416,4,B000095J1K,"Dave Chappelle's concert is great! I'd recommend it just as much as I do Chris Rock's concerts! I never followed Dave's show, but now I'm definitely gonna check out his episodes.

What I love most about Killin' Them Softly is Dave's constant use of a ""white"" voice. It's generic, all right, but it's so funny! I never thought Chappelle could imitate so well that ""game show host""-style of caucasian accent but it cracked me up whenever he used it in the many anecdotes he told!

This stand-up was great and I'd suggest anybody to check it out. Dave's insights on several topics and issues are hillarious! Notables include his segment on the corruption of Sesame Street and the sex scandal of the Clinton Presidency.

I think any fan of great stand-up comedy would be happy to have this in their collection.",1097539200,6,806,4.702127659574468

I have not seen anything this funny since Eddie Murphy retired from stand-up. Not for kids, but no way can you pass this up for great laughs.

It would have been great if there was an interview with Dave or backstage behind the scene look. But its all good. This performance still covers with its raw sense of mentality.

1879431,4,B000095J1K,"If you're in the mood for some irreverent, occasionally off-color black comedy but Chris Rock is a bit ""much"" for you, this HBO standup special is definitely a worthy option.  Dave Chappelle doesn't share Rock's abrasive tone, rapid-fire delivery, or penchant for bursts of profanity, but behind his low-key approach is an equally bold and perceptive comic voice.  And he's really in his element here, free from the inconsistency that has plagued his Comedy Central sketch show since its premiere last year.  Armed with an arsenal of voices ranging from Oscar the Grouch to Bill Clinton to a generic white guy, Dave offers his hilarious take on subjects few comedians can address this well without going over the top.  His assessments of modern-day race and gender relations elicit frequent fits of hooting and hollering from his audience, and it's easy to see why, as Dave seems to have a knack for expressing what everyone else is thinking.  Dave also proves himself to be a master storyteller, particularly with an account of a night in the projects that's both hilarious and depressing at the same time.  Later on he examines the hidden messages in kids' TV, unveils his plans for becoming the first black president, and of course skewers the whole Clinton-Monica Lewinsky situation, how the media covered it, and just what it tells us about the nature of celebrity.  As I've already mentioned, Dave has his own show on Comedy Central right now, and while it's shown a lot of potential it hasn't quite has its stride yet.  If you want some prime Chappelle, kick back with this DVD and of course a copy of ""Half Baked.""",1081555200,2,1622,4.830324909747293

He was comfortably slumped in Conan's chair and displayed a natural sense of comic timing. A quick search on Amazon revealed that there were DVDs of his shows. I ordered. Was in store for a ribtickling hour or so. This guy is good!
In this particular cameo, he comfortably treads the line of race, social commentary, kids, the presidency, relationships and some other miscellaneous things. I could go on about the material in and of itself, but that'd only serve to spoil something that you should have no idea is coming at you.
