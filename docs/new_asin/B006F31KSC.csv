8610844,5,B006F31KSC,This documentary tells the story of the Tar Sands in Canada and the great damage it has done to the people and the environment.  It's a dirty stinking shame what an industry can get by with.  If we were to spill one 55 gallon drum of oil on a piece of ground or into a stream we would be fined and made to clean it up.  The oil industry is devastating the people and environment and no one will do anything about it!,1350864000,,416,3.9879518072289155
