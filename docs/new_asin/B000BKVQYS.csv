8088138,4,B000BKVQYS,"""Viva Chihuahua"" is viewable for the good songs and wonderful horses, but the story does not work because the 2 leading men simply aren't suitable for their roles as ""Latin Lovers;"" Miguel Aceves Mejia (1915-2006) doesn't have the personality or looks, and German Valdez ""Tin Tan"" (1915-1973) looks over the hill and worn past his years (46 when this film was made) for the guys to be irresistible to the 20-something girls. The plot concerns Miguel Lopez, who is an upstanding member of his community, and in order to have a wild and woolly time, he invents a brother, Pancho, and goes to a neighboring town as his ""bad brother."" There he meets German Terrazo (Tin Tan), and together they are up to no good, deceiving the ladies into thinking they're someone they're not. The two main love interests are Marina Camacho and Norma Mora, and you will also see a young Eric del Castillo, still going strong in the 2007 telenovelas, as a policeman.

Director Gilberto Martinez Solares co-wrote the script, loosely based on an Oscar Wilde story. Music is by Raul Lavista, and cinematography by Jack Draper, and unfortunately, what they have to work with doesn't rise to their Epoca de Oro standard, but squeaks into a 4 star category for the songs and the beautiful horses (there is a short horse race included in the film too). There are 2 songs written by Jose Alfredo Jimenez, and those who remember Lalo Guerrero's 1955 hit ""Pancho Lopez,"" will be amused by Aceves Mejia and Tin Tan's rendition. This film is in b&w, and no subtitles are available. Keep your expectations low on this one!
