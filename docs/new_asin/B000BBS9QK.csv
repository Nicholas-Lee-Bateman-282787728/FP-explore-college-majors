2411479,3,B000BBS9QK,"This offering from National Geographic was a little disappointing. Having watched a lot of dvds on this subject this dvd did not offer any real insight into the many unanswered questions that need to be explored.

I feel any reasonable person would question and find it difficult to accept that a super-power like the USA could virtually just sit-back and allow 4 commercial planes to fly off course and not be intercepted, as depicted here.

It is  unfortunate that the many interlects at National Geographics did not seize this opportunity to produce a more meaningful representation.",1132012800,22,586,5.083333333333333
2411480,5,B000BBS9QK,"This is the first documentary produced for television that links America's 9/11 event to the burgeoning army that defeated the Soviets in Afghanistan in 1980. That army came to be known as Al Quaeda. After defeating the Soviets this group of multinational mercenaires, led financially and spiritually by Osama bin Laden, decided to take on the other remaining world power, the United States. This is the linchpin for events from Sept. 11, 2001 and everything that has happened since that time.

This is a scintillating documentary told in allegorical detail of events around the world. It pinpoints the assassination of New York Rabbi Meir Kahane as the signature event that launched Al Quaeda's campaign in the United States. Kahane had been a Jewish leader in New York that rallied worldwide support and opinion against Soviet and Middle Eastern mistreatment of Jews with great success. His assassination was a new entry in modern history and a great success for Al Quaeda.

There is so much going on in this four-hour epic that it cannot be adequately described in a review. The first two hours authenticate the historic development of Al Quaeda and its plans to destroy the World Trade Center. The back two hours are a blow-by-blow account of events leading to 9/11. This film moves at a rapid pace and is far more engaging than the movie HBO showed in the middle of the night, ""The Hamburg Cell"", about the conspirators from 9/11 and their plotting in Germany.

I urge anyone that likes documentaries, American history, or good filmmaking to acquire this CD at the earliest possible moment. Until another production comes along that casts these events together in greater detail, with better production values and a beefier script, this will remain the authoriatative television documentary on this subject.

Kudos to the National Geographic Channel for producing this outstanding program and taking up the gauntlet dropped by The Discovery Channel and The Learning Channel, which formerly did this kind of programming well but now seem more interested in televising ""reality"" programs about police chases and motorcycle mechanics.

The National Geographic Channel, which is currently airing an equally outstanding documentary on the failures of hurricane Katrina, is now the best option on cable for this kind of ex post facto documentary. This film is its best work to date and should be in everyone's library that enjoys knowing what the hell is going on in the world.",1130889600,80,2476,5.088669950738916

I've seen the documentary itself on televison before and thought it was fantastic for something made only a few years after the fact. My only problem however, is the return policy. Living far from my daughter, she wasn't able to visit until just recently, by which time it was too late to return the product when we discovered that the first disc was riddled with errors that caused it to skip the entire first half of the program.

After the momentus killing of this mass murderer i wanted to see the entire program again to refresh the history leading up to the dreadful day in us/world history.

How everytime this country gets hits in one way or other, how we pull together in order to get the job done.  The embarassing part of it is that we soon afterwards go back to our own stupid way of thinking which is what caused our present grief in the first place.  If we don't want to acknowledge that there is a God and that He loves us, we will continue to have problems in this country.",1297468800,2,550,4.425742574257426
2411517,1,B000BBS9QK,"Where the truth lies in the 911 event starts with Sept 10, 2001 when Rumsfeld steps forward and indicates the Pentagon cannot account for trillions of American citizen's dollars lost. The next day (9/11/2001) the two places the records of the money trail where this money went, namely Building 7 of the twin Tower complex and the west wing of the Pentagon were destroyed. Can anyone in their right mind consider this a mere coincidence?

Everyone heard there were ""put Options"" purchased in the several weeks prior to 9/11/2001 betting the stock value of the two planes hitting the twin towers would plummet, reeping big rewards for someone speculating and buying these put options. According to a recent source, the security company contracted to place electronic security system in Building 7 was the source of these put options. The SEC recommended to the 911 Commission these coincidental purchases be investigated. This was not explored by the 911 Commission. The 911 Commission was given a very limited time frame to conduct the study, with a limited budget to do so and conflicting evidence was to be disregarded. Who laid such conditions on the 911 Commission and what was the purpose?

Was Cheney put in charge of NORAD in the months prior to 9/11/2001?  Is it Cheney who ordered a ""stand down"" of NORAD so planes destined for disaster could complete their mission? Is it true Cheney was only willing to provide testimony behind closed doors and not under oath? What type testimony is that?

Is it true there was evidence of nanothermite in the rubble on 9/11/2001 that would suggest a controlled demolition of Building 7 and possibly the twin towers?

We only got five frames showing an object hitting the Pentagon. Why are the other security cameras facing the Pentagon parking lot and recordings by off-site private establishments such as a hotel and gas station that faced the Pentagon being held under lock n' key and away from the US citizen?  What gives them the right to do so? Who do they work for if not for us?

Cheney was the CEO of Halliburton prior to his VP position. Was Bush Jr a simpleton who had his puppet strings pulled by Cheney to get us in Iraq? Was it a coincidence that Bush jr was reading about the story of a goat on 911 in Florida so Cheney could oversee an operation such as 911?

The biggest question of all...are those behind the scenes in US government going to be allowed to remain in the shadows...guilty of  cover up that would implicate and prove them to be traitors to the USA and American citizens? Is this what one would call a true democracy, if the citizens are meant to be ignorant of those so evil as they must have been and continue to be?

Let's insist on another investigation and disclose what must be. Insist all testimony is under oath, including Cheney's. Let's rid our government of the cockroaches and return the government to the people it rightfully belongs to.",1296864000,11,2925,4.7176470588235295

2411520,4,B000BBS9QK,"Very powerful and indepth.  The documentary reminded me of the event and caused rememberances of that terrible day like it was yesterday.  The visual effect and historical background causes one to remember the importance of history; as well as the ways one person or political motive can cause uprising that leads to devistating results.  This documentary comes highly recommend by someone that took one year of Middle Eastern studies while an undergrad, and since than has developed an clearer ubdersstanding of the people, environment and politics.  What should come from this, besides the importance of what lead up to the cause of 9/11, but that these people of Middle Eastern descent are radical extremists and do not speak for the people who belief and practice Islam.  Lastly, this documentary should not be forgotten and shown to our children and their children as a reminder that one political movement or one radical person can alter and break down everything we have worked hard for in one swift move.",1286755200,2,1012,5.0359281437125745
2411521,5,B000BBS9QK,"I rate this as 5-stars not from a vantage-point of enjoyment, but from a place of assessing it's importance.

This should be required viewing in schools, government, and elsewhere to truly understand how events unfolded. Yes, it provides background on the ""seeds"" that later sprouted so horrifically.

National Geographic was thorough, accurate, respectful yet honest, and well-rounded.

This is not a propoganda piece at all. NGS simply presents information, photos, video footage, interviews & comments and background history on Afghanistan, Mujahadeen, Soviet Union in the Middle East in the 1980's, the 1993 bombing of the WTC, and other pertinent information which any of you can look up elsewhere to corroborate it.

This is not ""easy"" to watch. Any person with a heart and conscience will cringe at a lot of what you will see and hear. Whatever your politics (and/or conspiracy theories), just watch this to appreciate your fellow everyday Americans. You really feel like you are ""there"" when you see this.

I don't recommend younger children watch this alone, and I would strongly encourage parents to discuss this with their children, no matter the age.

My own comment is: While the terrorists themselves committed these acts and are responsible, Americans truly need to learn and understand what America as a political entity and military power has done through the many decades to other countries and peoples.

2411523,4,B000BBS9QK,This is the best presentation of the events of 911. National Geographic outdid themselves. It arrived on time and in great condition.,1272499200,2,133,5.090909090909091
2411524,5,B000BBS9QK,This was an excellent and detailed account of the events and characters that led up to the horrible day of 9-11-01.

Very disturbing at times but informative.,1269907200,3,283,5.173913043478261
2411525,5,B000BBS9QK,"When you put this in your DVD Player, be prepared for a full blown journey into what led up to September 11th, you will be taken into the training camps of Al Queida, you will learn how an ordinary 6'5"" Saudi with wealthy background and leader of a ragtag group of fighters drove Russia out of Afghanistan, became America's most dangerous terrorist after being betrayed by his own people.

This DVD is as compelling as it gets, it is over 3 1/2 hours long and leaves no stone unturned, unless you are one of those conspiracy theorists who believes 9/11 was an inside job, which I am inclined to believe to a point that Bush and his flunkies knew there was an attack on the way and did nothing to stop it simply on the basis that they wanted to go to war with someone.

But enough of my opinions, that's not what this review is about, there is not one boring minute in this documentary, if you want to see what led up to 9/11, then you owe it to yourself to see this video, I have so many 9/11 documentaries on my shelf but if I want to sit and show someone why 9/11 happened, I'll show them this one.

2411526,4,B000BBS9QK,"If you ignore the childish tabloid style, the thunderous sound effects, the satellite camera zooming in on each city with a crash -- and if you imagine the narrator's voice as being the voice of Will Lyman, the PBS narrator -- if you do that, this documentary could be a Frontline. The content is quite serious, and since PBS did not elect to make a comprehensive documentary about the origins and execution of 9/11, this is the next best thing.

There is an anecdote in the film about a group of Muslims who were students at a tiny southern college. They took off their shoes when they went to pray, and the white students threw the shoes in a pond on the campus. One of these young Muslims turned out to be the mastermind of 9/11.

If the right questions are not asked and debated, then the truth will never be known.  The many scientists around the globe that have legitimate beefs about the official story should have had the opportunity to be heard. Why was Building 7 never even dealt with? This video was very one sided, with great production value as you'd expect from NG, but basically nothing more than propaganda. It saddened me.",1238889600,5,500,4.9523809523809526

Missing, unfortunately, is adequate reference to those who have, who are, and who will risk their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor to provide those of us fortunate enough to call ourselves Americans with the freedoms which we, at present and throughout our history, enjoy and have enjoyed.",1225584000,3,532,4.846153846153846

It by all means paid no respect to the victims of that tragic act performed by evil cowards. Pictures flicker and over-smart jingles and annoying noises far too often distort the message and irritate the viewer. It somehow appears as if it was a show designed by a bunch of hyper-active kids in the early teenage years!
I am sorry I had to ""let some steam out"" in this review, but I felt that I had to do so because the ""show"" in reality was put together by a company - National Geographic - which I believed was serious and of great responsibility.

2411544,5,B000BBS9QK,"I have about 12 9/11 DVDs and this one, without a doubt, is the best one.  If you only want to buy one 9/11 DVD, this is the one you want.

There are 2 discs.  Disc 1 is about 4 hours long and has 2 parts.  The 1st part is a chronological run down of all of the known events leading to the 9/11 attacks.  I have to admit that I was surprised how much National Geographic was able to put together.  The 2nd part of disc 1 gives a minute by minute run down of all of the events that took place on the day of the attacks.  Once again, I was surprised how much National Geographic was able to put together.  You'll hear accounts from those on the planes (via recorded phone calls) and accounts from those who were near or on the floors of the Twin Towers that got hit by the planes.  These accounts are chilling.  There was about a solid hour during the 2nd part of disc 1 where I had the chills.  You will be utterly speechless by the end of the 1st disc.

This is a DVD that every American should see because on 9/11 we all asked ourselves, ""How could something like this have happened?""  Well, this DVD answers that question and we really should pay attention to that answer so that it won't happen again.  So many people could have prevented this tragedy and we didn't.

This DVD goes in to a great level of detail which I personally like, but someone with ADD or a short attention span may have a hard time sitting through a 4 hour-long documentary, though I personally was rivetted to my TV throughout all of disc 1.  I recommend watching the 1st disc in 3 or 4 parts, though once you start watching the 2nd half, you will not be able to stop.

This DVD is amazing!  I'm glad I bought it and I really think you should buy it, watch it and remember/learn how destructive hate can be and how important it is that we all do what we can to prevent this sort of thing, because it CAN happen again.",1198368000,41,1894,4.114441416893733

Disc 1: To be honest I didn't watch it all. I do not, in any way, wish to ""understand"" terrorist actions or the finatics that take part in it. Yes,there's theories of ""conspiracy"" with all the warning signs prior to 9/11 but since I'm not privy to government secrets I have no way of knowing if they're warranted or not. No matter what major event happens, there's always a conspiracy theory that follows. I didn't want this DVD for political reasons. But I will say, I'll never understand why America allows people to gather for the simple purpose of spewing forth hatred and violence toward others. We have freedom of speech but I do not believe that talk of this nature is what our forefathers were thinking of.

Disc 2: This disc is why I want this DVD. It shows a minute by minute account of Sept. 11th from the terrorist finatics at the various airports to the sounds of emergency beepers going off on the emergency personnel trapped in the tower rubble. This DVD has short accounts by survivors of the towers, rescue personnel and a few family members that lost loved ones. No lengthy, tear at your heart, interviews. My imagination can do that quite nicely without actually hearing the words.

So 4 stars because all I want is disc 2 and I wish these two discs had been sold separately. I love the way NG laid out the whole program. Each time showing the time of what was about to happen. I could follow the entire day, minute by minute. This is what I want and if there's other programs put out in this same format, I'm not aware of them so I have no way to compare.",1188691200,27,1823,4.324561403508772

2411552,5,B000BBS9QK,"There are lots of documentaries about the events of 9/11, and all of them have their strengths and weaknesses.  This one has weaknesses, too, but I don't think they matter much.  It was made with a purpose in mind: to examine the evolution of bin Laden's operation beginning with the resistance to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1980 and ending with the events of 9/11.  It is not-- and it's not intended to be-- a comprehensive overview of US foreign policy, the operation of the CIA, the rise of fundamentalist Islam, or anything else.  Rather, it's the narrative of the time line that ends with the hijackings on 9/11.

It's composed of news footage, still photos, and interviews with eyewitnesses and participants.  The end result is a sequential narrative explaining how 9/11 happened and suggesting why the intelligence community failed to understand what was happening.  As is the case with most National Geographic documentaries, the production values on this DVD are very high.

Is this the last word about 9/11?  Of course not, and I'd be amazed if the writers and producers thought it was.  Rather, it's one resource that's very valuable for anyone who wants to understand those events.

I am highly interesting in many aspects about the terrorist attack. This DVD told me things that I had not known before, and I had already purchased a few DVD's on 9/11. I recommend this DVD to anyone who is interested in seeing and hearing a wide variety of information on the attacks.",1161561600,6,410,4.694444444444445
2411554,2,B000BBS9QK,"This could have been a very good documentary, but the video editing style made it unwatchable for me.  The camera never stays on any subject for more than 5 seconds, film is sped up and slowed down for no apparent reason, and bright flashes of light with loud sound effects highlight the transition from scene to scene.  The events surrounding 9/11 are fully capable of engaging my attention without this in-your-face style of presentation, which ironically dilutes the overall impact of the film.",1161216000,7,497,4.975903614457831
2411555,2,B000BBS9QK,"This is a ""goody-goody"" Ronald Reagan propaganda style film. By that I mean that it tries to portray the US as the good guys being hit by the bad ones. It doesn't say what dirty role the US CIA had in birthing the whole horrible genie of fundamentalis Islam, how it set up, equipped and nurtured not only Bin Laden and his Al-Qaeda, but a whole bunch of other loathsome Islamic terror outfits now stalking the globe - like the Islamic Brotherhood and the Taliban for instance: all just to defeat the USSR, and gain access to hydrocarbon rich regions, to fuel the greedy American consumerist lifestyle which US citizens take so much for granted. I am not a ""conspiracy theorist""; these people are usually an absurd breed, going off at the other extreme tangent. I live in Peshawar, the hotbed of CIA mischief in the 1980s and 90s (and even now), and the area where I live - the University Town - housed all the actors on this stage: the US officials and spies, their clubs, the Afghan ""Mujahideen"" leaders' houses, etc. etc... I grew up seeing all this going on literally next door, and so would like to apprise my American friends of the unpleasant truth. The National Geographic and the Reader's Digest magazines are two long established icons of US media culture that have served as the unofficial (and therefore hard to suspect) mouthpieces of some of the most outrageous US propaganda drives... Never trust their political commentaries, although their articles about polar bears and planets can be very nice...",1158451200,22,1514,4.760456273764259
2411556,5,B000BBS9QK,"Wow, I watched this on the national geographic channel and I was so astonished at some of the details, that I had to buy it. It should be a must buy for any library across this country. I encouage every American to watch this!",1157932800,3,226,4.159090909090909
2411557,5,B000BBS9QK,"I am very satisfied with my purchase. Those who rated this dvd low are those out there looking for conspiracy theories. National Geographic was sure to avoid this, they didn't feed you any ideas of anything other than what happened, they give you the full story of the terrorist plots execution and timeline. The dvd starts way back in 1980. The first program shows the events leading up to it, and stops on sept 10th. the second program takes you through the entire day of Sept 11. It takes you through every thing the terrorist plan and do that day. With real life accounts the events come together. I personally love the way they did the film, theres no unnessecary scenes of violence. I highly recommend this to any one looking just for the story of 9/11, who wants to know what happened on the blackest day of American history. As for those who believe the conspiracy theories, this isn't the film for you.",1156982400,6,911,4.560975609756097
2411558,1,B000BBS9QK,"I have never seen a WORSE production by National Geographic than this.  I have lost respect for them after this awful DVD. They did not do their homework, nor did they connect the dots.

Very disappointing.  Watch ""9/11 - In Plane Sight"" instead.",1143676800,23,246,4.674418604651163
2411559,5,B000BBS9QK,"Inside 9/11 takes us on a vivid journey, starting with the origins of militant Islam and the genesis of 'The Planes' plot all the way to zero hour. The documentary utilizes a unique hyperlink filmmaking style that riveted my eyes to the screen. There are countless moments I wished to turn away . . . but could not. While Inside 9/11 details the face of evil, it also shows the selfless courage of so many who sacrificed their lives to save complete strangers. First person accounts complement stark video coverage in telling the story. I've watched several of these films; Inside 9/11 provides the most complete detailing of a day that will never be forgotten. The film succeeds because it blends the micro(like the ticket agent who gave Atta his ticket) with the macro view of 9/11. I felt like I had lived through 9/11 again . . . this time with understanding.",1138406400,17,863,4.647058823529412

8084815,5,B000BBS9QK,"Spread over two disks: Begins in 1980 with Afghanistan rebels fighting against Russia. When Russia gives up rebels are courted by bin Laden. Then Iraq war and Saudi Arabia chooses the United States' protection over bin Laden so he goes about from country to country creating a network. The 1993 WTC, the U.S.S. Cole, and then he wrangles some guys willing to martyr themselves! Shares the evidence that was accumulated about the people involved, frighteningly SAD! WHAT IS IT FOR! Includes mentioned attempts to get a 'companion' (too expensive-$400- as they had sent back their unused stipends) and adult vid rental at hotel (hmm?).

Disk two focuses upon the attacks themselves and includes actual video footage and first-hand interviews. From there it is about the massive destruction and doomed phone calls which includes info about the passengers that retook the final plane. Insightful and at times sickening to ponder. Frustrating, confusion by authorities.

Extras includes focus upon children at a nearby school and how they dealt with the situation. RIP.",1482364800,,1064,5.252941176470588
