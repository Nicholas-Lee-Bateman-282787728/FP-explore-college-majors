8239627,5,B0010Z642C,"This documentary shows Kiki Smith preparing for an installation in Venice, Italy, around 2002, and it also shows her working in her studio, at home in New York City. The film presents itself as a congenial and informal collage of her comments, and it gives insight into her creative process and history. It reveals bits and pieces of her life in a circular, free-wheeling fashion. Her assistants and collaborators are also interviewed, and they give added insight into a generous, intuitive, delightful artist and her world. The viewer is welcomed into the activities and life of Kiki Smith, a joyful, effervescent, and prolific artist.",1317859200,2,636,5.125
