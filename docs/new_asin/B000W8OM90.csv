8221656,4,B000W8OM90,"For Gene Autry fans!  The video transfer quality and the audio on this and other discs in this series is excellent.  You can tell that Gene was maturing a little in this one but he still turned in a good performance and ""Frog"" Milhouse was back with him in his final film. A ""must"" for Autry fans.",1362009600,,297,4.192982456140351
8221657,4,B000W8OM90,"If you ever enjoyed Gene Autry then this movie is for you. It has him singing as well as riding Champion which as I understand he did most of his own without a double. Also ""Froggy"" gets into trouble as well.",1358985600,,208,4.097560975609756
8221658,5,B000W8OM90,I enjoy Gene Autry's movies. This was only one of his movies that I had not seen in awhile. Enjoyed it greatly.,1342483200,,111,4.090909090909091
8221659,5,B000W8OM90,"Gene Autry winds up his movie career with this action-packed, well-acted tale of the last days of the Pony Express -- a station owner's desperate attempts to preserve it, a forward-looking former rider's vision of how stagecoaches and the telegraph will replace it to the benefit of everyone.

 Autry said in his autobiography ""Back in the Saddle"" that he and his production company didn't know when they made ""Last of the Pony Riders"" that it would be his final picture. But more recent interviews with surviving participants suggest that they DID know it, and Gene Autry, Dick Jones and company seem to go all-out to make the last one a winner.

 And it is. Gene shows more enthusiasm for the plot than he did in a few of his last Columbia movies; the stunting in the fight scenes, and in Jones' hell-for-leather riding, is first-rate; and Smiley Burnette's comic relief is kept to a reasonable level by the director. There are just two songs in the picture, which is rather typical of Gene's later movies; they focused more on plot and action than his films made for Republic before World War II.

 It speaks much for the whole-souled goodness of Gene Autry the man that he allows Dick Jones to speak the last line in Autry's last movie, while Autry simply looks on approvingly, with his usual ambiguous smile. This was, indeed, ""Last of the Pony Riders,"" on several different levels.",1276473600,2,1387,4.734439834024896
