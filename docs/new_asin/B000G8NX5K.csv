8129418,3,B000G8NX5K,"This film is the kind of phenomenon that here in Rouyn-Noranda, Qu., where we have an entire festival of this sort of thing (believe it or not!), namely the ""Festival du 'DocuMenteur' de l'Abitibi-Tmiscamingue"", which annually occurs right here in the Mockumentary Capital of the World, exclusively featuring such ""mockumentaries"", i.e. faked documentaries, for the sake of the humour of it all. (Just think of that witty French neologism, ""docuMenteur"", as an English punning word, ""docuMendacity"".) On those terms the film, which I viewed in one of its North American DVD editions (Alliance 102469) actually works, although it takes awhile to realise what the actors and others involved in producing it are striving for. This is not quite the kind of straightforward comedy, also, admittedly, a ""mockumentary"",  that is only partly an equivalent, for deluded stand-up comedians, of what ""This Is Spinal Tap"", its sequels, and films and sound recordings imitating that cult classic, are for would-be, inept rockers who are ""legends in their own minds"" (and nothing more than that). ""Greg & Gentillon"" documents a friendship gone sour on the road as delusions and failure wreck those lads' relationship with each other. At least both of them still are young, with their adult futures ahead of them, once they come to their senses!

Greg and Gentillon (or ""G2"", played, respectively, by Louis Durand and Thomas Michael) have been childhood friends, great buddies in high school, whom their classmates and the citizens of Aylmer, Qubec, enjoy simply for whom they are as human beings, rather than the star entertainers that the warm reception and recognition of their small community lead the lads on to thinking that they can achieve stardom. In fact, they have no real artistic talent at all, which, soon enough and ever more progressively, becomes obvious as things stagnate and worsen for them in Toronto, the big centre which they set out upon graduating from high school, with hopes to have its people adoringly at their feet. Then, so they hope, onwards to Los Angeles and to Las Vegas! However, the two are merely jovial mates whose good-natured camaraderie is something that others in Aylmer cherish for the sweet and modestly pleasing thing that it is. Their antics are not really comic, just youthfully high-spirited fun for their friends and fellow citizens in little Aylmer share in and to enjoy. Greg and Gentillon remind me of guys in the circle of young friends, in their twenties and thirties, who get together in the back yard for barbecues and beer-fests at the apartment building next-door to me where one of the couples lives. Their rowdy frolicking is enjoyable for those involved but not meant for public consumption on stage or screen and, of course, they themselves would be aware of that. Putting such ""personal shtick"" up on the stage leads to truly ""pathetic"" results (in the sense of being lame and unimpressive).

In the movie, Greg gets involved additionally in a fourth-rate ""bar band"", which increasingly draws him into its realm and leads to a gradual rift in his collaborations with Gentillon.  A rupture develops in the friendship of the two, things have fallen completely apart in Toronto, and, chastened by experience, Greg, realising that his life (in music as well as in comedy) is going nowhere, returns to Aylmer. The duo's truly pathetic agent, Paul-Emile (acted by Paolo Mancini), a n'er-do-well living in the basement of his parents' house, is just as deluded as G2 themselves are, but he, at least hem, with a glimmer of self-protection, remains behind in Aylmer where he belongs, rather than sets himself up in higher style that only would bust him financially. In the film, both comedy duo and band never do anything beyond provide low-grand stage chatter in bars, eateries, and other such venues as ""amateur hour"" fare (what, in comedy, is known as ""open mic"" opportunities) or, in the case of the band in which Greg takes part, provide music also as background sonic fare for customers to drink, to flirt, to cruise-for-sex, to ""schmooze"" with friends and strangers alike, and, in general, to carouse. As for Gentillon, well, he seems, by film's end, intent on persisting in going solo as a comic, not realising how utterly non-existent his ""talent"" really is, leaving the viewer only to hope for the best for him, with more than merely uncertainty that he likely will go anywhere far in the entertainment world.

I can think of a good use for this bilingual French-English film (with subtitles when French is the language spoken), which grows increasingly grim as it proceeds. In university, there were classmates as fellow music majors who had either no discernible talent at all or who had it in too little measure to achieve even modest success in music, especially as performers or composers. In some cases a few eventually would manage to inflict themselves as ""music educators"" upon children and teens, teaching music poorly, blandly, and inadequately. I was one of the few of my class to make a career in music, in librarianship, while others should have sought also to follow related endeavours such the music industry or sales, although very few did so. ""Greg & Gentillon"" would be a good film for such aspiring musical tyros to see and to absorb the lessons that it (along with some serious discussion with adults after viewing it) could impart to such students of the performing arts, be that in music, drama, comedy, or other areas thereof. Perhaps in that function, rather than as only an intermittently enjoyable movie, ""Greg & Gentillon"" could serve a much-needed function to curb star-struck youth who really should reassess their genuine potential.",1438992000,,5714,5.023206751054852
