8153560,5,B000JYWF64,"The story line has been done before. High school boy meets a girl with special powers. Even though this theme has been rehashed over and over; this series is surprisingly good. Yuji is a normal guy who happens to run into the flame haze, Shana. Shana fights a never ending battle with beings from a parallel dimension that eat human souls. The story is about the bond of their friendship and their fight to save the world. There are a lot of things about this anime to like. The animation is really good, the voice acting is good and the characters are interesting. Each episode keeps you wanting to keep watching more. As the relationships between the characters grows stronger the show becomes more captivating. The picture is clear and the colors are vivid. The worst part about the show is that I have to wait to see the 2nd season. I really liked Shakugan no Shana and I'm looking forward to the 2nd season. It's not a new idea but it's still a really enjoyable anime. Give it a shot why don't ya.",1355616000,,1002,4.451086956521739
