1678673,4,B00005YUOR,"The essential elements here are a gathering of nearly all surviving members of the cast save for ""Barnabas"" who is conspiciously absent. Alexandra Moltke (Victoria Winters) appears for the first time since leaving the show. Some of ""Dark Shadows"" most famous scenes are shown in a quick review of the actors work. Dan Curtis is also present to tie a lot together. A few genuinely funny responses in the question and answer session, particularly John Karlen (Emmy winner, but not for ""Willie"" who gave a perfect performance of a man having a nervous breakdown that should have won one) and a perfect impersonation of Thayer David by ""Adam"". Also included are star appearances on the Mike Douglas Show and The Merv Griffin Show and a few adverts. I don't recommend this DVD unless you are a real fan of the show. It moves rather slowly and you see the actors as they are today, much older but wiser. But fans love them 100% and are just glad to see them all together again.",1068163200,61,971,4.618497109826589
1678674,5,B00005YUOR,"I saw this Video at the ""Dark Shadows"" Festival in NY Yesterday Sunday Sept 31st 2003, and This is a must have for every DS Fan, it includes clips of past shows and interviews with the cast and a Panel Interview with the entire cast of the show and with the Creators behind the scenes like Colbert (Music) Sy Thomasoff , (set Design) (sorry for my mispelling of his name}and Dan Curtis. Just a message to those that order This DVD, If you have already Pre-ordered the DVD Titled ""Dark Shadows Memories"" Take note, At the Festival I talked to Representatives of MPI who distrubite the DS videos, and they told me that this is the Same DVD under a different name. so if you ordered it under the ""Memories"" name, This is the video or DVD you will be Recieving instead.",1062374400,23,765,4.394366197183099

7957312,5,B00005YUOR,Enjoyed the DVD.  The reunion was very interesting as were the extras.  I am a fan of Dark Shadows in the 1960s but did not get to see all of the shows due to work.,1394755200,2,164,3.657142857142857
7957313,4,B00005YUOR,was a nice update after they had stopped filming !  a definite piece to add to my dark shadows collection !!,1391817600,,108,4.142857142857143
7957314,1,B00005YUOR,you can see it all on youtube. It's badly shot and edited. Not worthy of a fan product. They could have spent more time piecing it together than just letting it run on and on.,1386547200,,175,4.0285714285714285

7957317,4,B00005YUOR,First off I thought It would be alot better done than it was.  But I am a die hard Dark shadows fan.  I found the interviews on the Mike Douglas show with Jonathon Frid and Joan Bennett very cool (their is a very annoying woman with Joan however).  They do a very nice little talk with the audience however the audience asked some really stupid questions.  Lara Parker still looks gorgeous after all these years.  I really wished Jonathan would have been apart of it. Dan Curtis is a complete hoot. The way he threw things together and they worked the man is a genious!!!!  The fruit cake that hosted this reunion should be shot,1073520000,23,628,4.417391304347826
