8220794,5,B000W00XPU,"Hey it's Sunnydale Chick here and I FINALLY got to see I know who killed me (The headings the third song they play in the Gentleman's club.....(Slipping Away by Nine Inch Nails ......and the other one is Step On it by a Band named Vietnam, great songs for anyone who wants em') I never REALLY knew what this movie was about....and then I saw Hard Candy again and I remembered just how much I wanted to see this.......I'm not gonna give the ending away.....I wouldn't Do that......Besides its Really fun to figure this out......(This one Is Tricky though......but I know my fans can get it....(Tip you'll have to watch the movie a few time's..(It even took me 2 times and you're talking to the girl who guessed both Scream Killers.....but this was tricky) Also it's NOT like a Stripper movie....don't think Showgirls....DO think Ringer...it's like that....if Buffy and Faith were sisters, personality wise of course I know that in the movie Lindsay Lohans identical, Lindsays also REALLY great in this role, No idea why this movie gets so much flack, my fiance is also giving me Blue roses, (cause we love this movie so, he's making me a Blue Rose stained glass window, and he's making me the blue knife at the end (we collect and make movie collectibles and prop weapons.....There's a FUNNY cameo of Crabman at the hospital.....and clues thru out the movie that'll help you guess who the killers are.....And of course me being The Scream Queen and all I will help you. Aubrey and Dakota are shone with 2 bright colors. Aubrey Blue and Dakota's Red. (I would be Red like Dakota) Aubrey gets a Blue Rose from her boyfriend...and Dakota is wearing a red strippers outfit under a bright red light at The Gentleman's club called Striptease. You'll see a bright neon sign with the same colors outside, the foot and hand of the Stripper on the sign blink on and off....(representing her limbs the killer cuts off later. When we see Dakota dancing at the club in the beginning....not a dream sequence......it's something that happened to her that later happens to Aubrey (You figure this later) When Aubreys writing this story to get into Yale......it's about Dakota.....and both sisters have been dreaming of meeting each other later. When Aubreys sitting with the blue rose her boyfriend gives her.....you see this Overhead shot of a fence on the balcony behind them......and the wooden slats that are on it each have one whole piece.......and one that's missing half a piece (another clue) When Dakota gets one of the killers with the blue glass knife he made ......it's a Referance to what the mom said (you're a kicker girl.....so you go ahead and kick! Then she stabs the killer in the neck with the knife killing him before she goes to rescue her twin sister, and they KNOW they won't be alone. Not anymore.",1388361600,,2806,4.763860369609857
