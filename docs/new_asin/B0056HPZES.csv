8459642,5,B0056HPZES,This really is an excellent film that has an even-handed approach to covering the rise of student aesthetes. All of them share the dream of becoming an NFL player but of course the numbers don't lie... few will make it. This documentary has a great backstory and is strongly recommended.,1518220800,,287,4.76
8459643,5,B0056HPZES,"This is another one of these documentaries that young football players need to see.  Just because you may have the talents does not necessarily equate to ""instant stardom"".",1399248000,,172,5.142857142857143

8459645,5,B0056HPZES,A must see.  7 years in the making and so worth the story it tells.  Humor and tears.  Laughter and disappointment.  Heroes on and off the field.  Great surprise ending.  Loved the barbeque scene.,1323648000,,196,4.617647058823529
