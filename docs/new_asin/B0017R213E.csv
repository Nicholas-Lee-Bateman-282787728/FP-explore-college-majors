Note: this is not a Region 1 movie mine was region 3 so buyers beware.  I have a region free DvD player, there were no skips and no problems with the movie. This was a great Anime! No smut(fan service)there was a small bit of cussing and some crude humor.  I gave it four stars because they jumped around in the scenes and I had to figure out, who was where in the scenes in the beginning.  They settled down and it became a very captivating movie!",1274918400,,575,4.1441441441441444
