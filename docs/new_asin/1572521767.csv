189607,4,1572521767,"To the review from San Diego: Do you always bring your personal agenda to the critique of everything you listen to and/or see? That sounds like a pretty unhappy life. Is it so strange to believe that a film can tell a powerful and compelling story without endorsing what it portrays? Swept Away is a film that is both beautiful and disgusting, but not once did I ever believe that it embraced male domination, female oppression, or any type of class ideology. It told a story that had political undertones, and it did a great job in doing so. I don't particularly care for capitalism, communism or patriarchy, but I'm not shallow or naive enought to bring my unrealistic visions of a nonexistent utopia into my critiques of art, film and literature.",998179200,7,749,4.681818181818182
189608,5,1572521767,"I am not a huge fan of Lina Wertmuller, but I really enjoy this movie, and it was one of the first DVDs I bought.  To me it's just a great romance.  Great ending.  Very entertaining.",986860800,2,182,4.0
189609,5,1572521767,"Lina Wertmuller has certainly proven herself to be one of the best female  directors of all time. And he made film history when he got nominated for  Best Director in 1976 for `Seven Beauties' which is her best film and  marked her second pairing with Giancarlo Giannini, who was also nominated  for Best Actor. This was their first pairing and remains one of the most  provocative and saucy of all films. A richly comic Italian gem that has  images and scenes that linger in the mind long afterwards. Mairangela  Melato is great as the bitching rich and uptight but beautiful blonde who  believes in class superiority and never gets off Giannini's back during the  first third of the film. But once they are marooned on a desert island  their roles are quickly reversed until Melato is literally kissing  Giannini's feet. Wertmuller tackles a lot of political and sexist issues  along the way. Some of the sexist material may offend some (especially  women). Some women are not too fond of the idea of a woman lowering herself  to the level of being a mere servant and sex slave. But let's not forget  that a woman put this exquisitely stingy premise on the screen and she must  have had her reasons. Both actors are flawless in their roles. Guanine's  look is intense and Melato's beauty is intoxicating. The ending is both  emotionally wrenching and strangely comic. Extras: the complete title is;  Swept Away... by an unusual destiny in the blue sea of August. From a scale  of 1-10 I give this film a 9!",968284800,4,1508,4.683206106870229
189610,4,1572521767,"It's true that Lina doesn't date well - her politics are so out in front.  But if one understands and loves Italian culture, there's much to be savored in such films as PASQUALE SEVEN BEAUTIES and this gem from the  mid-seventies.  Please don't be distracted by any ranting from humorless PC  types who don't get the joke: their snorts are the equivalent of a gay  politico thinking MR. RIPLEY was homophobic.  Ennio Guaneri's  cinematography here is splendid, but the  greatest element (alonsgide  Melato's performance - that queen of Milanese cynicism) is Piero Piccioni's  ethereal guitar and bossa-nova score as directed by Berto Pisano (composer  of ""Kill Them All""). One should be so lucky as to own a copy of  this soundtrack.  I hope Lina can make a comeback stateside since her fall  from favor in '79 with A NIGHTFULL OF RAIN.  The lady studied under  Fellini, and she has a probing social conscience, which is more than can be  said for most US filmmakers chasing a buck.",961113600,4,982,4.7844311377245505
189611,1,1572521767,"What started like a witty satire got quickly progressing into the trivial, banal and offensive scenes.  If Italian means sophistication, this one definitely isn't.  I was appaled by the notion that a liberated woman would  quickly succumb to a ""natural"" role of a slave to her  ""master"".  I think this movie is degrading to both men and women.  I don't think it has an underlying agenda, in my opinion, it's just plain  junk.  I can't understand how it could be called a comedy or a sexy movie;  rent Fassbinder's ""Satan's brew"" if you want something good of  the same kind.",959040000,9,574,4.65

It was considered quite controversial. I think the cinematography and the music are quite beautiful.

It was refreshing to listen to them go back and forth even though I cant speak Italian the subtitles make most everything clear.  One term had me buffaloed when he calls her and industrial whore, does this mean he thinks she works hard at her suspected trade?  She really isn't a fallen woman but a very lovely, blonde, Italian actress who has sadly passed away already.  I loved this DVD and all the actors in it, so much so that I turned around and bought Summer Night featuring the same, delightful Mariangela Melato continuing the side-splittingly funny Capitalist/Socialist rant.  It seems European politics are so much fun; perhaps our sob-sister politicians could learn something from them. One of my daughters didn't like it, voicing concern about violence against women; I think she missed the point but perhaps thats my male viewpoint and to think about it the feminists probably wouldnt like it.

189677,5,1572521767,"Raffaella (Mariangela Melato) is an upper class, blond and beautiful young woman sailing in the Mediterranean Sea on a large and magnificent yacht loaded with luxuries and servile, lower class sailors expected to grovel in her presence and in the presence of others of equal power and wealth.  She is a motor-mouthed complainer who continually rattles on about politics, the low quality of service in restaurants, the smell of the sailors eager to serve her and on a variety of other topics.  Gennarino (Giancarlo Giannini) does his best to serve food and drinks to Raffaella promptly and efficiently, but is gradually getting sick of her whining pushiness. At a turning point in the movie, Raffaella suddenly decides she wants to explore away from the yacht and orders Gennarino to drive her around in the yacht's dinghy.  He protests that it would be dangerous to start out so late in the day, but she batters him into submission with her machine-gun explanations.  They start out with Gennarino at the controls of a small outboard motor.  The motor fails, they drift aimlessly for days, then land on a gorgeous Mediterranean island.  Raffaella was the dominant, bossy person early in her relationship with Gennarino, but now is proving herself to be without a work ethic or survival skills, useless out of her element and without license to continue bossing Gennarino.  Meanwhile, Gennarino is having tremendous success showing off his ability to gather food and otherwise prosper in a bountiful new environment.  Eventually, Raffaella submits to Gennarino's better judgment in this new setting and allows him to become her survivalist boss.  He has turned the tables on her, but it doesn't end there.  She learns to think of him as her master, then falls in love with him.  They have a whirlwind courtship on the island which leads to an extremely erotic scene of the couple rising to the unbridled lust stage while rolling together on the island's big and beautiful sand dunes.  They wrestle with the question of whether they should stay on the island forever or return to the mainland but remain together as a couple for the rest of their lives.  They repeatedly vow to remain as a loving couple until the movie's end when they are forced to choose love rising above class differences or letting class differences tear them apart, leaving them remembering the island adventure only as a temporary fling.",1381622400,3,2409,4.962686567164179

Upgraded BD player firmware, no go. Also tried on another Sony and a cheaper Cyberhome that allows Region code to be changed. Tried all the regions, but still the feature would not play. Would not play on computer either. Ambiguous message about wrong region code (Power DVD DX s/w).

Ordered another DVD, but still exact same problem. Am considering informing the DVD publisher. Incidently, there is a english-dubbed version on YouTube, but poor video quality. Anyway I had to return the DVD's, both were brand new.

IMHO this film needs to be viewed in the english language, unless you understand Italian. The dialogue is too fast-paced, and I personally have trouble reading subtitles and trying to view the film at the same time (I also have same problem with walking and chewing gum).

Something obviously went wrong in this batch of manufactured DVD's. Also, it would have been easy for them to add english language dialogue as an audio option, so why then not?",1349136000,,1112,4.836842105263158

But Swept Away is primarily the obvious: a Mariangela Melato vehicle, and in the role of Rafaella Lanzetti, by turns the Industrial Bitch and finally, for the hero, Angel Face, Mariangela Melato hits the ball into orbit. Not even Vivien Leigh or Clark Gable in Gone With the Wind went through more, so memorably.

All they had to deal with was a vengeful Union Army.

It does not hurt that hers promises to remain a stunning beauty--I am 53, and the thought has never occured to me before--even after, say, the age of 100.

Then I wanted to write a paper on it for my undergraduate Cinema Studies class and when I started to do research, I realized this movie was an allegory for the political atmosphere of Italy in the late 60s and early 70s.  Being a young American, I was not aware of the struggles and sometimes terrorism that went on there during that period.  Even if you don't know about the politics you can still enjoy it if you can get over the woman being hit constantly (it really helps to read what the director said about that, the characters are representations of classes, so it is not about a man beating a woman, but the lower class rising up against their oppressors) [...] is where you can find my paper if you would like to read more on it.

189729,3,1572521767,"The time-honored ""man and woman stuck on a desert island"" scenario is served up with a heaping tablespoon of class struggle and an acidic twist of sexual politics in this controversial 1975 film from Italian director Lena Wertmuller. A shrill and haughty bourgeoisie woman (Mariangela Melato) charters a yacht cruise for herself and her equally obnoxious fascist friends, who all seem to delight in belittling their slovenly deck hand (Giancarlo Giannini), who is a card-carrying communist. Fate and circumstance conspire to strand Melato and Giannini together on a small Mediterranean isle, setting the stage for some interesting role reversal games (with definite S&M overtones, I should warn you). This film has a polarizing effect on viewers, which I think can be attributed to its fascinating feminist dilemma: How does one react to an obviously talented and self-assured female director with unmistakably misogynist leanings? BTW, in case you are curious about the Guy Ritchie/Madonna remake? Two words: Stay away.",1216252800,2,1020,5.462025316455696
189730,5,1572521767,"In a nutshell and taking off the PC blinders that other reviewers have stuck to their faces Swept Away is about natural sex roles (yes, male domination and female submission) and how societal complexities and absurdities which we create distort them. The writer (female) bangs this into the head of the observer over and over again, scene after scene. The use and discussion of class provides both interesting humor and the sex role reversed ""setup"" for the movie's main theme- which is the abrupt and even violent return to a natural state which they both end up very happy with. Again this is forced upon the audience in both action and dialogue with NO ambiguity.

<spoiler> The ending is NOT as others described a poke at male domination-ridiculous (he even gives his wife a good smack in the end) or anything else but them realizing that there are too many obstacles for their love to continue (which she realizes immediately), and that their brief time on the island will have to remain a memory. Demoralized, they both return to the ""real"" world.

Some have argued that this is male fantasy but I would argue it is just as much Lina's fantasy. Judge for yourself. It's a good movie for those men and women who are sick of feminism and the larger politically correct world of today.",1214265600,3,1288,4.6946902654867255

189732,1,1572521767,"It's not hard  to see why madonna jumped on remaking this much enjoyed classic. The socio-political-class-drama pitting a low rent man against a spoilt rich-B*%$# makes for a brilliant, satirical screenplay (even if the sappy ending is totally uninspired). UN-fortunately, this ultimate vanity project is nothing but a disaster,literally, at sea. Every critic who threw rotten tomatoes at this silly mess of a movie deserves major applause. Rambo-armed, designer dressed Madonna simply cannot disappear into the skin of another character, even if indeed that character is supposed to be everything her ""persona"" is: Opinionated, rude,glamorous,aggressive, tough and demanding. Goldie Hawn was far more effective (and hilarious) when she played the same pampered-rich-demanding-B*%#@  also having major fits over silly nothings on a sailing vessel in the film Overboard. Mr. Giannini,who plays ""Pepe"",(the target of her wrath) is a very likable, smart, ruggedly handsome, furry, unwashed, bedroom-eyed hunk who does his best, but fails to keep the film from stinking...er..I mean sinking. The never ending extra-gooey footage of them after he successfully breaks her down , saddles her up and has her submissively purring resembles a nauseating informercial for a romantic club-med. A vulnerable, love-sick character in the unskilled hands of Madonna is impossible to believe and have any sympathy for.  Everyone else in the film is forgetable...except for the casting choice of the two old-school-cartoon-grubby cooks (very three stooges) on board.

189746,5,1572521767,"Swept Away is criticized by Tania Modleski for poking fun at feminists. That is part of the film's accomplishment, though: Swept Away is culturally valuable for its ability to poke fun at everyone whose flaws warrant it. Wertmuller presents us with extreme characters in absurd situations--characters we love to hate but who are still capable of moving us when they express sincere emotional tenderness and vulnerability. This story explores the ways in which political and economic divisions allow pig-headed people to treat each other. And it certainly doesn't support the oppression of women, as a short-sighted viewing of the film may suggest, because Wertmuller emphasizes the notion that relationships based on one's ability to dominate the other perpetually fail. Whether that dominance comes from political, economic, or gender roles, domination and subjugation create such mistrust in both parties that love cannot sustain itself. Wertmuller masterfully creates type characters--the rich bitch and the vengeful Sicilian--who turn into human beings outside of society and touch the audience with their attempt and failure at love. The elements of composition, music and lighting are used in such a beautiful way that the audience is convinced throughout the couple's stay on the island that love is possible, despite the divisive odds against them, and so their fall is that much more saddening at the end of the film. And the often harsh dialogue and action are Wertmuller's bright way of presenting a farcical tale to her audience, daring us to judge the characters lest we be judged.",1178323200,2,1594,5.329365079365079
189747,4,1572521767,"Let's start withn a few important items.

This is really a 4.5* film.  It would be a five star but some scences have lost their punch and the scene where Gennarino almost rapes Rafaella is really now in poor taste.

Second, this DVD is only in Italian and does not have the English dub (which is weird as the video I have of this film has the dub) on it - this really does not matter to me as I always watch the original language with subtitles. But switch the Italian from mono to 5.1 for better sound quality.

Third, the review title is the English full title of this film.  The Italian title is Travolti da un insolito Destino nell'azzurro mare D'Agosto.

This movie has three acts.  Act 1 - Status Quo - Rafaella and her friends rent a yacht.  Rafaella is an overly opinionated and always ready to tear down anyone else.  Rafaella is also very rude to the yacht staff.  Gennarino is the one of the crew members that Rafaella loves to demean. (The funny thing is that in 1975, her views were very controversial but now she seems very reasonable.)

Act 2 - Castaway - Rafaella has over slept (to 7 p.m.)and demands to be taken to the cove that her friends are swimming.  Gennarino is told to take her in the rubber dingy.  On the way the dingy has motor problems and they go adrift.  Eventually they wind up on a deserted island.  This becomes a variation of Taming of the Shew.  Rafaella is her demanding shrew but Gennarino realizes he holds all the cards on the island and uses them to break Rafaella. (The main scene gets ugly when assaults her, rips her clothes off almost rapes her - this is just too much in today's standards.) Eventually, Rafaella becomes his willing subject and falls in love with the primal man. (Because he is nothing like the men in her life.)

Act 3 - Reality - The two are rescued.  But their love remains when they return.  The question is will it survive reality?

This is the best film of Italian director Lina Wertmueller.  She shows us two disagrable people and then makes them intense and interesting.  Giancarlo Giannini is Wertmueller's favorite actor and he give a fantastic performance as out antihero.  Mariangelo Melato shows that a shrew can have multiple dimensions.

This is a great movie and if you take it in the context of the time made, it is even better.",1177459200,4,2308,4.4534606205250595

The sailor, Gennarino, who is a communist, does not like this woman but has to bear with her bad mood. One day she wakes up late in the afternoon and asks to be taken to land where everyone had gone earlier. Gennarino sets up a boat but during the trip, the boat breaks down. They spend the night in the middle of the sea.

189750,5,1572521767,"Linda Wertmller's 1974 Swept Away looks at one of those infamous elephants in the living room that no one wants to talk about - sex and politics. Little wonder it's one of the most controversial movies ever made.  Exquisitely filmed in the Mediterranean, Swept Away is the story of two people from very different worlds thrown together by chance.  Gennarino (Giancarlo Giannini) is a poor sailor working aboard a chartered yacht. Raffaella (Mariangela Melato) is the beautiful, wealthy woman who chartered it.  Raffaella treats Gennarino like dirt - constantly insulting and ridiculing him - and he has no choice but to let her. She is capital; he is labor. He must put up with her abuses because he needs her money. That fact gives her power over him. But when the two of them become stranded on a deserted island, the tables are quickly turned. Gennarino has the skills needed to survive. Raffaella's only skills consist of shopping, sunbathing and ordering servants around. If she wants to survive, she must give Gennarino what he wants, and what he wants is nothing less than her complete physical, mental and emotional submission.  At first, she resists, later she consents. Eventually, she comes to want - even love - his domination.  It would be easy to dismiss Swept Away as pure male fantasy, until you remember that it was made by a woman and a feminist. Wertmller asks us, with all the subtlety of a Howitzer, to look at the complex relationships between sex and power, and how easily those relationships can be flipped on their heads. You might not like what Wertmller has to say. You'll probably hate the way she says it. Or not!

if you are a foreign subtitle yuppie like me who appreciates the difference in european vs american directors, this film should literally sweep you away.

it's different, it takes the male macho point of view, but it also opens up the macho attitude in the same way that marcello mastroianni did with his films like WIFEMISTRESS, CITY OF WOMEN, 8 1/2 and LA DOLCE VITA.

the story is role reversal. a communist crew member on a yacht who hates rich people gets stranded on a deserted tropical island with a rich blonde. both are married but suddenly he is boss -- not she. her money means nothing on the island and she literally becomes his slave and eventually his love slave in order for both of them to survive. the movie is better than the one tom hanks starred in when his plane crashes and he is forced to survive on his own.

the u.s. version of this movie, made by madonna, was terrible. this one will show you the creative talents of wertmueller. try it. you'll enjoy your evening.",1156636800,2,1010,4.4728260869565215
189753,5,1572521767,"""Travolti da un insolito destino nell'azzurro mare d'agosto"" (Swept Away by an Unusual Destiny in the Blue Sea of August), to give it its convoluted original title, was meant as an allegory on social and class injustice as much as a battle for dominance between the sexes. It is one of Lina Wertmuller's finest films and is the one which most closely fuses her main themes of socio-political and sexual injustice.

Rich, upper-middle-class, Raffaella (Mariangela Melato), a loud-mouthed and opinionated Social Democrat from Milan, and the pampered jet-set clique she hangs out with are on a yachting holiday in the Mediterranean. They are served by a crew of poor working-class, dark skinned southerners, one of whom, Gennarino (Giancarlo Giannini), a card carrying communist, cannot abide her whiny bitchiness. As luck would have it, they end up marooned on a deserted island. Torn from their worldly moorings, they undergo a role reversal as the rich, pampered lady has to literally prostrate herself before the menial servant in order to survive. This role reversal is portrayed graphically and very brutally and will certainly have feminists and even many men cringing in disgust, especially in our era of extreme political correctness. She is smacked, beaten, almost raped, made to grovel and finally forced to acknowledge him as her ""Master"". Incredibly, she slowly falls in love with him. To the point where she no longer wants to be rescued when a passing ship sails within sight of their island ""paradise.""

The bleak ending following their rescue, where she leaves him for the privileged lifestyle she had previously been accustomed to, is pessimistic and sad and points to how things never really change in the end - the poor will always be poor, the rich rich and not even love can break through that barrier. One final irony is revealed at the end when the dominatingly abusive Gennarino is shown as a meek, almost henpecked husband, set upon by his jealous wife when she finds out that he has had an affair with the woman while marooned on the island. The closing shot of him timidly carrying her bags as he walks a respectful 2 paces behind her is unforgettable. Not at all the ""Master"" he made himself out to be on his little island utopia.

Much of the socio-political implications will be lost to American audiences who will see it purely as a satirical battle of the sexes. On the level of a love story it is bittersweet if not downright sad. On the level of sexual equality, it pokes a finger at the concept of male domination. On the socio-political level it is a parable and a warning that tables will turn and that the oppressed will one day arise and the ruling elite will get a taste of the injustice that they have meted out for so long.

Previously released in 1997 in a deplorable transfer by Fox-Lorber, it has finally been restored and remastered to almost pristine condition by its successor, Koch-Lorber Films. It is presented in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio (enhanced for widescreen TV). The film was deliberately shot in soft focus and exhibits a small amount of grain but other than that, it boasts gorgeously saturated colors, deep, rich blacks and nary a nick in a film that is over 30 years old (1974). The azure-blue hues of the Mediterranean sea and sky are a joy to behold. The original Italian mono track is included as well as 2.0 Stereo and Dolby Digital 5.1 remixes. The sound is not that great but more than adequate for its purpose. This is after all a dialogue driven movie and Raffaella does sound obnoxiously shrill. Optional English subtitles are included. There are no extras save for some Koch-Lorber trailers. ""Swept Away"" comes in the same transfer as that found in Koch Lorber's Lina Wertmuller Collection but avoid that if you can. Only ""Swept Away"" and ""Summer Night"" have been fully remastered.

Raffaela is kicked, punched, sexually subjugated, denied food, and made to beg for love (in a reference to Mary Magdalene, she actually weeps on Giannini's feet)to play out the director's theme turning tables on the arrogant, masterful wealthy class and their Christian Democratic Party social policy. The master/servant role reversal, particularly as a prelude to ""love,"" is a bit much. Any stars are due to the remarkable actors, especially Mariangela Melato.

After searching the one-room chapel that is obviously deserted he exclaims, ""Christ on the cross, worse than coca-cola!""

Naturally, the man is the one most reluctant to go back to the society where he is worker-slave and the woman is ruler over him! The black humor is wonderful because it is visual, via the camera angles and shots, and it is beautifully filmed. I'm afraid the new version, from what I've heard,(and I will not pay to see it)meddles with the ending and hence changes the meaning of the film.

189770,4,1572521767,"""Swept Away"" is an interesting italian 1974 release about a greedy woman who expects her male servent to accommodate her with anything she pleases in all costs.  Her cruelty takes an unexpected turn once they become trapped on an island together.  Then the job roles turn around, and her trials return to haunt her.  The war that erupts between each other takes an unusual turn.
This creative plot was written wonderfully.  They combine drama, comedy, romance, and slight erotica to make this unforgettable movie.  Its conflicts and its trials keep audiences watching closely at what will happen next.  The love story theme is one of the most unique in cinema history, though cruel.  Twists and turns arise in various scenes giving it the added edge, leading to a surprise and powerful conclusion.  Though there are some flaws not relating to the writing, namely the woman managing to keep her make-up on throught the entire island stay without reapplying, the interesting storyline greatly makes up for it.  The acting is interesting, especially the two lead actors: Giancarlo Giannini and Mariangela Melato.  Though Melato occasionally overreacts some words, she keeps her character interesting with her unique charisma.  Giannini keeps his aggressive edge intact in every moment.  All other actors also perform their roles wonderfully.
""Swept Away"" is a great film for those looking for something unforgettably unique.  This will surely keep audiences entertained.  Those who like this film should stay away from the 2002 American remake, starring Madonna.  It's not nearly as good.",1079827200,13,1585,5.258964143426295

When she suggests this to the sailor he says that it was late and dangerous but she didn't care and as result they got lost and ended in a deserted island.

First off I want to make it clear that although there is some violence toward women in this Wertmuller is NOT a hater of women. The violence is to show how weak the male characters are to the strength of the women oin the story(THe very end makes that clear). In every film I have seen by Lina Wertmuller the women always come out ahead in the sticky rocky ride of modern Italian relationships.
I was floored at this films mix of politics and comedy which is a mix Wertmuller was never afraid to use as often in her career as Hitchcock used ""the common man accused of a crime and catching the killer to prove himself innocent"".
The performances are amazing and this film ranks amnong the best in the directors career. Highly recommended even if the quality of the dvd is a little off par.",1030752000,10,903,4.349112426035503

Swept Away is filled with witty, intelligent dialogue, hilarious banter and breath-taking scenes of the Mediteranean.  It's also fairly politically literate, which is a rarity in Hollywood these days, it's also rare in most other movie making outlets.

The plot sounds as formulaic as humanly possible, but wait!  This one is different.  It's got a style and panache that barely any other films can match.  Sure it was controversial (the misogynistic violence is quite disturbing) but Lina Wertmuller offers up a masterpiece that should not be ignored.  It's easily her best and most enjoyable movie.  Some would argue Seven Beauties is her best, but I respectfully disagree.

To see this one on a large screen would be quite an experience, just looking at it on my regular television made it seem as if I were cruising the Medeteranean right along with them.  They just don't make movies like this anymore, and especially not in Hollywood.  When recommending foreign films to your friends you cannot go wrong by pushing this video into their hands.
