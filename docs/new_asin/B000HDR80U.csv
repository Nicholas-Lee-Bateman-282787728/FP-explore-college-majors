2634585,4,B000HDR80U,I enjoyed this film. Great mystery as to who is the killer. Isolated eerie backwoods atmosphere and strange people who live around the place. Great to see this film fully restored and uncut. Locations are used very well and the film is very intriguing right to the very end.,1445558400,,274,4.612244897959184

2634587,2,B000HDR80U,"A group ventures into the country for some rest and relaxation. But instead they find some vaguely hostile locals, a few harmless romps in the hay...and a mad killer wearing a garish rubber mask!

Rather by the book rural horror is somewhat hampered by the occasional flat performance, but does manage some decently odd touches.

Case in point: check out that way weird striptease/makeup/gay seduction/hatpin murder sequence).

The low key action lacks any real chutzpah until the last half hour when our psycho begins to get his freak on.

2634588,4,B000HDR80U,"Come on folks, for a first movie for a writer/director, and a budget << $100 K, this one has a lot of strengths, mainly the story, which is well-done.  Given some of the reviews, I thought director/writer Paulsen was challenging the great Ed Wood!  But here, at least, is nothing Ed Wood woulda/coulda done.
With a decent budget and proper time to do re-takes, cuts, etc. this would have been very good.  Certainly better than most of the genera of like today.. By the way, I watched the ""streamed"" version, which apparently is without many of the bad cuts and pastes some complain about in the CD.",1424649600,,598,4.570093457943925

2634592,4,B000HDR80U,"SAVAGE WEEKEND (aka: THE KILLER BEHIND THE MASK) has a few problems. However, it has its good points as well, including the character named Otis, played by William Sanderson (BLADERUNNER, MAN'S BEST FRIEND). Sanderson plays him w/ just the right mixture of backward hillbilly-ness and unbalanced menace. The nefarious character named Mac Macauley (played by the one and only David Gale- REANIMATOR, THE BRAIN, SYNGENOR)is also quite good in a wicked, ""macho man"" way. His dialogue on the fishing boat is priceless, including the branding-iron-flashback-sequence. The rest of the cast would be very dull indeed, if not for the fact that they're busy taking their clothes off, and having sex every few minutes! The biggest complaints about this movie have always been that A) It takes well over half its running time before anyone gets killed. B) The acting can get pretty wooden at times, and C) The boom microphone is visible -especially toward the beginning- in several scenes, making them painful to watch! Still, once the madman dons the mask, this becomes an effective horror movie. Coming out two years after TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and BLACK CHRISTMAS, but pre-dating HALLOWEEN by two years, SAVAGE WEEKEND gets extra points for originality, a nice twist, and a machete vs. chainsaw finale! Seeing it uncut adds an extra star to the total...",1409875200,3,1347,5.127272727272727

2634594,4,B000HDR80U,"Sure it took forever for anything to happen, but I didn't mind it. One character was very entertaining to watch (I'm sure you'll guess which one). Wished the murders had been more graphic (as in bloody) and less chat though.",1392508800,2,224,4.625
2634595,4,B000HDR80U,"This early slasher film has a sleazy discomfort to it that fans of b-movies like Criminally Insane or Fight For Your Life will definitely go for, plus it's got a moustachioed David Gale (the mad doc from Re-Animator) playing against type as the manliest of all men and Blade Runner/Newhart's William Sanderson as a dimwitted backwoods hick.  Also, this is legitimately a movie about a bunch of folks who go upstate to look at a boat.  That's the whole purpose of their trip.  Brilliant.",1390867200,,486,4.761904761904762
2634596,5,B000HDR80U,"This film is really good for a low budget film, and for its time too. I believe this was filmed in 1976. I liked this movie a lot, although, it was easy to find out who the killer was. The kills were ok and I was scared a few times. I like the soundtrack from this film too. Pretty impressive for low budget. The acting and cast were ok as well. The DVD edition of this is just ok. This needs to have a remastered in high definition on either DVD or Blu-ray to make it even more enjoyable, but the DVD does the job. I would recommend this movie for your horror collection. I got this movie really cheap at the time too which made me pleased with my purchase. I would rate this 3.9 out of 5. I just ordered the Blu-ray version of this, which is one of my favorite classic horror films. 5 out of 5 stars.",1381795200,4,802,3.987577639751553

I mean, I lost count of how many times the BOOM MIC was clearly visible in the frame!!  Not scary, not creepy, just AWFUL.",1343692800,,417,4.294871794871795

2634600,2,B000HDR80U,"This is a yawn of a slasher movie, made in 1976, although it was stuck on the shelf for five years before being released. When you see it you'll know why. The film plays like an uneasy combination of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""The Phantom of the Opera"", and ""Pod People"".

After a brief, tense, and needlessly melodramatic opening revealing conflict and parenting issues within a tedious group of people, the cast goes to a creepy old cabin for the weekend, where crazy Otis works as a boat caretaker. How do we know Otis is crazy? The heavy-handed direction and screenplay have one cast member mention to another that Otis has previously kidnapped and branded (yes, with a branding iron) a woman. But that's all in the past, and they have no reservations whatsoever about letting Otis stay on as the caretaker of their boat. It turns out that Otis is none too skilled at his craft, as they bring in an outsider to assist him, after which many bad things happen. Coincidence?

The film is mostly boring, although there is one fairly good plot twist which you can predict if you watch carefully: I was too bored to watch it all that carefully in part due to the tedious flute and banjo music. I give ""Savage Weekend"" two stars for throwing the curveball at the end.

As a side note, the movie is available as part of the ""50 Movie Pack: Drive-In Movie Classics"" collection, normally for less that you would pay for this single DVD.",1224028800,4,1435,4.575875486381323

2634603,1,B000HDR80U,"Why would anyone waste time and money releasing a film on DVD in a form that is confused and incomplete due to heavy editing and censoring?? Such is the case with Savage Weekend. I first saw the film several years ago at a drive-in theater in Georgia. I vividly recall that there were several nude and racy scenes and some fairly graphic violence, as well. Well, if you buy this DVD you can safely play it for the kids because all of the ""adult"" content is missing!! Also, the picture quality is absolutely dreadful and grainy and looks like it was copied from a very poor quality source; such as a copy made on VHS at home from a poor cable t.v. service!! Maybe one day Anchor Bay or someone else will give this film the treatment it deserves and release it in the original, complete, unedited and uncensored version. Also with decent and clearer picture quality, too. As a fan of actress Caitlin O'Heaney (aka Kathleen Heaney), this DVD is a real letdown.",1183593600,38,957,4.505747126436781

8138758,3,B000HDR80U,"Greg Pettis (Jeff Pomerantz) former spokesman for a governor that committed suicide has his son (Adam Hirsch) for the weekend. His ex-wife is off for the weekend or so with her boyfriend Robert Fathwood (Jim Doerr). He is having a boat being built. The group includes broker friend Jay Alsop (Devin Goldenberg), Shirley Sales (Caitlin O'Heaney) and the flamboyant Nicky (Christopher Allport) who has all the best lines. There is a story about a girl being branded with an ""H"" for ""whore"" by Otis (William Sanderson). Toward the end of the film a slasher appears.

The film opens with a teaser that happens at the end of the film. Greg wears a black suit with a black tie when we first meet him. There are three scenes where the microphone appear and a fourth where there is a microphone shadow. Nicky was great in his bits and they needed to fit him more into the script. Much of the film was ""so bad it is good.""

I watched this on a 50 DVD pack which showed the branding scene and plenty of nudity.

8138760,4,B000HDR80U,"Another unsung gem from the 70's that, when it is mentioned in reference books, is usually maligned or unfairly labeled a ""bomb"". While the film is partly a stalk 'n' slash tale, it's quite refreshing in it's delivery, as there are no teenagers and very few children in sight, just adults acting like adults. A group of friends (each one with personal problems of their own) head to a house in Upstate New York for some business and fun. In the film's funniest scene, openly-gay Nicky (Christopher Allport of JACK FROST - 1996) stops at a bar for a drink and ends up beating the crap out of two brawny men making fun of his sexuality (and the extremely short swim trunks he is wearing). Once they reach the house, they find a dead bat nailed to the door (only Nicky is man enough to remove it). After a few BIG CHILL-like moments, where Mac Macauley (RE-ANIMATOR's David Gale) regales a story to two of the guests about how local borderline retard Otis (William Sanderson of FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE - 1977, in his first theatrical film) branded a woman years earlier with the letter ""H"" (for ""whore""; I said he was borderline retarded), another couple make love completely naked in a field while Nicky watches nearby (and ogles the naked man) and they all watch Otis kill a renegade rat, a masked killer begins to kill them one-by-one for some unknown reason. Could it be Otis, who rides a bike and spends too much time in a graveyard talking to the headstone of his dead friend? Or Mac, who gets his rocks off by telling scary stories to everyone? Or could it be someone in the house? Since they all seem to have one problem or another, from jealousy, child custody trouble, sexual abuse to sexual identity, it is a definite possibility. As the story progresses, the group have a fancy dress dinner party and the killing begins. Jay (Devin Goldenberg) is hung in the barn and another is done in with a hatpin to the ear. A table saw is used to kill another, in the film's most suspenseful scene. A baling hook and impalement are used to kill another before the killer is unmasked and his motivations revealed. It all ends in a final showdown (a chainsaw and a machete are involved), where an unlikely character becomes the savior.  This is one of my favorite 70's horror films. It's mature in it's approach to love and death, something you don't normally see in low-budget horror films. Director/producer/scripter David Paulsen (SCHIZOID - 1980) doesn't tip his hand that there's a killer on the loose until about the 45 minute mark (where we see the masked killer trying on one of the guest's clothes). Up until then, we see plenty of full frontal nudity (both male and female), the Otis flashback where he brands the woman and smashes her lover's head against a rock (this flashback may not be true, since Mac, who is telling it, does not like Otis to begin with), a cringe-inducing scene where Mac removes a fishing hook from a guy's foot and various sexual infidelities among the cast. What really is different about this film is the way it portrays the gay character. Nicky is not portrayed as a limp-wristed girly-man, but as a strong person capable of taking care of himself and others, a rarity in 70's cinema. The killer's motivation is not much of a surprise (it's basically revealed in the opening minutes), but the tense final minutes, coupled with a creepy banjo score, really toss you for a loop. The acting is uniformly good (most of the cast went on to have long careers, many of them in the horror genre) and the gore, while sparse, is well-handled. The only minus is the pesky boom mike makes several appearances at the top of the screen, but that could be a framing issue on the print I viewed. Originally filmed in 1976 as KILLER BEHIND THE MASK, released in 1979 as THE UPSTATE MURDERS and renamed in 1981 as SAVAGE WEEKEND. It would make a perfect double bill with another 70's undiscovered gem, THE REDEEMER (1976). Also starring James Doerr, Marilyn Hamlin, Caitlin O'Heaney (as ""Kathleen Heaney"", who would later star in HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE - 1980), Jeffrey David Pomerantz and a very young Yancy Butler (WITCHBLADE [2001 - 2002]) as the ""Little Girl"". A Paragon Video VHS Release. Also available on DVD in one of those 50 movie comps (DRIVE IN MOVIE CLASSICS) from Mill Creek Entertainment. There was even a version converted to 3D in 2012 in hopes of getting people to buy it for the now long-lasting 3D fad.

8138762,4,B000HDR80U,"Marie and Greg are in the process of getting a divorce, so she decides to get away with her boyfriend Robert for the weekend. Joining Marie and Robert are Maries sister Shirley and her friend Nicky. When they arrive at a remote farmhouse everything seems normal but thats not the case. It seems that a masked killer has joined the party and he begins killing them one by one.

I have to be really honest, I almost turned the movie off during the opening credits because of the lame banjo music. Savage Weekend contains a bizarre soundtrack. Most of the film is pretty slow, theres a fair amount of nudity and a number of sex scenes as well. Savage Weekend doesnt really get going until the last 20-30 minutes and if youve never seen it, its definitely worth a look. The film runs 88 minutes and its rated R.

Video Quality 3.8/5
The new Savage Weekend 1080p High Definition Widescreen 1.85:1 Blu-ray transfer from Kino Lorber / Scorpion Releasing taken from the original elements is probably the best this film has ever looked. Its evident this film hasn't gone through any major restoration because it still contains some scratches and speckling here and there, certainly not enough to ruin the viewing experience for me.

I also noticed a number of scenes throughout the film that contain some very faint vertical lines, fortunately they didn't really take anything away from the image. Overall this film looks pretty good, theres quite a bit of grain throughout the film but images come through nice and clear for the most part. Colors are pretty good, considering this isn't a very bright film to begin with. Outdoor scenes look really good, skin tones appear correct and the color of the blood seems accurate. Overall this new Blu-ray from Kino Lorber/ Scorpion Releasing is definitely better looking than the old DVD version I have from Mill Creek.

Audio Quality 3.5/5
The 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio does pretty decent job but it definitely isn't perfect. The dialogue comes thru crisp and clean for the most part but it gets muddled by background noise and music in a few scenes. I noticed a bit of a hiss thru my sound system but not enough to detract from the overall listening experience.

The film was reissued on bluray and ur selling it. Ummm, re-encode, please! Which can be said about many of the older titles you have posted. THAT SAID: Something cool and creepy about this film. Not paint by numbers and not predictable.  As clunky as it is at times - and admittedly some bad acting - there's a lot of style and a lot of steering clear of cliches. One of those rainy-day-on-the-couch 70s flicks. Great to see some of the cast members in early roles. The open and close work well together (the magic of editing! And a good directorial move)! Some scenes are totally out of the blue, keeps you guessing. And also saying WTF? Score by Dov Seltzer is pretty great. Deserves an official release. Enjoy.
