3983902,5,B002T5QM42,"One of the best films I have ever seen.  Charles Darwin's theories remain controversial today within some schools or segments of the Christian community, due to the implications of his theories, well described in this film.  However, his observation of natural selection allowed geneticists to recognize the causes of many diseases being due to genetic mutations, and thereby facilitating the cure or prevention of some of those diseases.  His work has resulted in the decrease of human and animal suffering, and continues to improve our lives today.",1519084800,,550,5.2988505747126435

3983909,5,B002T5QM42,"This film is of the same ilk as other first decade of this millennium films that have a non-existent primary character in them, such as Sixth Sense, A Beautiful Mind, etc.  While that concept is not entirely original, it has not been played out in quite this manner.  His ideas on evolution were utterly brilliant, and his love for his family was immense.  He embodied the true spirit of what it means to be religious - kind to others and true to self.  Thus, the debate about the compatibility, or lack thereof, between religion and evolution is tertiary.

The idyllic pastoral setting provides a fitting backdrop for the naturalist who, dedicated to family and community, is faced with a choice between publishing ideas that strike at the heart of conventional religious belief and betraying his own intellectual convictions.  I would like to have seen more of Thomas Huxley and more detail on the evolution of Darwin's ideas.

That switch from believing in a god creation to evolution was really a hard for Darwin and many others at the time to transcend. Seeing others come to the grip with such things actually makes it a bit easier for some others that are having a difficult time transcending and helped to show me the difficulties that these other people just might be having and or have had. I fell into the natural science world in a heart beat and the idea that there was and is no form of evolution is just crazy to me, we can see evolution all around us without really even looking. That there was a time that it was believed to be sacrilegious and  teaching it could get you excommunicated if not killed is beyond my beliefs. But yet it was and in some places is considered sacrilegious and it is deadly to teach.

3983932,3,B002T5QM42,"Beautifully filmed, great acting, wonderful soundtrack.
Another great bit of British BBC periodical costume drama.
And yet....?
Is this a relatively new phenomena... or have humans been doing this to each other for millenia? I'm referring to the deliberate falsification of historical events for public consumption, designed to be disseminated on a large scale, and perpetrated under the excuse of 'entertainment'?
Perhaps this is the peculiar weakness of our own time?
I become more and more aware of this possibility the older I get.

I know that 'Artistic licence' is the excuse,
but I do start to wonder after watching this film how much of it is deliberate manipulation of public opinion (propaganda) done to serve the agenda of current 'causes'. (E.g. such as the 'Carlos The Jackal film', etc.)

This film CREATION is a good example of that (e.g. was that title deliberately chosen to attract and influence/re-educate 'Creationists' and Christians?)

It's advertised as ""The true story of Charles Darwin"".

The TRUE story?!! :-0

The whole thrust of the film is that Darwin was an atheist who was cajoled into writing 'On the Origin of Species' as a necessary strategy in a battle against 'religion' and the idea of a 'Creator Deity.

But that is not ""true"", as Darwin himself stated:
""when I wrote The Origin of Species, my faith in God was as strong as that of a bishop.""

The secondary idea appears to be perpetuating the idea that there was - and still is (?) - a battle going on between 'science' and 'religion'.
Thomas Huxley is presented in the film as thinking that science and religion were intrinsically opposed.
Yet here is what Huxley actually wrote about 'science' and 'religion':

""The antagonism between science and religion, about which we hear so much, appears to me to be purely factitious - fabricated, on the one hand, by short-sighted religious people who confound a certain branch of science, theology, with religion; and, on the other, by equally short-sighted scientific people who forget that science takes for its province only that which is susceptible of clear intellectual comprehension"". [T.H.Huxley, ""The Interpreters of Genesis and the Interpreters of Nature"" in Science and Hebrew Tradition, (London: Macmillan, 1904), pp. 160-161.)]

More aspects of the film that are not ""true"",

- Curiously more than half of the film falsely depicts Darwin talking to an apparition of his deceased daughter Annie and going slightly mad, (tearing down his dovecot/hydrowater tower and running around the garden ordering his invisible dead daughter to 'come back here'.

- The Vicar of Downes is falsely represented and made to be the 'baddie' of the film. A rift in their friendship towards the end of Darwin's life is falsely depicted.

- But I suppose the biggest deviation from fact and what strikes me as the biggest deliberate deception perpetrated under the guise of 'entertainment' has to be the presentation of Darwin as an athiest and his gradual rejection of victorian Christianity falsely shown as him categorically rejecting the concept of a cosmic Creator.

That's quite a bit of 'artistic licence' going on there.

Strikes me as more like lying about the past to win today's perceived 'battles' (viz. Evolution versus I.D perhaps?)

It IS correct that Darwin DID come to consider religion as a tribal survival strategy
Yet at the time of publishing 'On the Origin of Species' (which is where the film ends) he still believed that there was a God who was the ""ultimate lawgiver"".
And even at the end of his life Darwin never did reject a belief in a Creator God.
He DID gradually cease to believe in and reject Victorian Christianity.
But the two are NOT the same thing (Dawkins appears to make the same mistake).
Contrary to the film's depiction, Darwin remained close friends with the vicar of Downes, John Innes, all his life plus continued to play a leading part in the parish work of his local church.

Darwin wrote: ""...[it is] absurd to doubt that a man might be an ardent Theist and an evolutionist"".

In 1879 he wrote: ""I have NEVER been an atheist in the sense of denying the existence of a God. - I think that generally... an agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind.""

I suppose the BIG question I am pondering is why people in positions of power and control in the media today (the BBC) feel the need to deceive viewers about all that?",1396828800,3,4413,4.900671140939597

3983934,5,B002T5QM42,"I knew nothing about Darwin, so this was interesting! All of the actors did a great job! It kept my attention all the way through and it was really enjoyable. It wasn't about evolution, but about Darwin's personal struggles.",1395792000,2,224,4.769230769230769
3983935,5,B002T5QM42,I don't know how historically correct this is. I knew Darwin withheld publication of his book for years because he knew how it would impact the world. I didn't know it made him sick. It's a story about a married couple with hugh differences in their religious beliefs. Cumberbatch has a small role.,1394668800,2,298,4.6415094339622645
3983936,5,B002T5QM42,"For me this portrayal of Charles Darwin's search to finally document his historical belief of evolution is a prime example of how his daily life of loss and triumph became a working part of his (and our) ultimate gifts to society.
Little known facts are revealed where the viewer witnesses a tortured life that Darwin has in experiencing the death of his firstborn daughter and a loving wife who remains totally devoted to him even though she fears his destruction as a scientist if the world is as outraged as she believes it will be by his book.
We leave this presentation realizing how troubled he must have been on the two opposing fronts; one, in that as in our own lives he often had so little influence of it's future. Two, his ultimate revelation of a controversial truth that effects our view of all life from beginning of time to an unexpected future.
My biased point being, creation is a fluid thing generation to generation. Going in, we are so certain of our belief; then leaving, the inescapable truth that God has been in control long before our perception (or even our creation) of a God existed. I'm sure God marvels at how short sited we are as the best representation of the best thought in the divine mind.

I've tried to be concise. The movie and it's actors will provoke you; but not to one point or the other; but to both points of contemporary view. Enjoy!",1389830400,2,1380,4.542168674698795
3983937,5,B002T5QM42,"My background is chemical eng. I like reading the cradle of civilisation, astronomy, physics, archaeology, palaeontology, biology, anthropology, electronics. I've ever seen UFO by my eyes 3 times last year, 2013, (all appeared in the sky. Other people in the area watched it also. I've 2 eye witnesses nearby on the 2nd watched) but I also do believe in God existence as I find God's wonderful creation in me & other creations too. How wonderful is my mind (brain) & body work. From the lowest cast (viruses) until highest cast(human/ alien), from anything on earth to the mighty universe (galaxies, quasars, dark matter, BLACK HOLES, etc) nothing is created by chance/ coincidentally even until subatomic particles bcs scientists found regularities & they can formulate it becomes nuclear energy (particle elementary science). They are so amazed by the regularities in the mighty universe. I can understand some scientists anti/ battle against religion and vise versa bcs they see each other in different angle.

Scientists see anything based on 100% evidence & logic way of thinking while religion(s) were made for human moral guidance only bcs in the past/ ancient time human were still wild/ sadistic. Sometimes religion could explain something but admits miracles. It also admits God(s) existence who created this life/ Someone who is/are higher thn us while Budha (founder: Sidharta Gautama) doesn't believe in God but in reincarnation. Hwvr, correct/ true religion is teaching us about moral/ do good things for humanity. So scientists & religions see something at different angles bcs they both are created/ exist for a specific purpose.

Science without religion is like human can understand how material works/ is created until subatomic level (elementary particles/ things tht made up an atom) but they don't believe tht stones form SOS sign in a desert means someone is in danger. They thought those are created naturally. While religion without science is like our world was created only around 6,000 yrs ago (bible says 1 day on earth is 1,000 yrs in heaven) but many geological evidences indicating/ prove much much older (some billion yrs). Watch DVD ""God in America"".

I do believe in evolution/ diversity  theories bcs God commanded all creations to multiply/ full fill the earth in the early creation. All creations from viruses until human are equipped wth very adaptive capabilities against changing / hostile envinroments. Scientists spends billion of dollars every year to fight the more resistant viruses & bacteria, etc. Elvis & M Jackson could soon be forgotten after several generations but all creations, especially human being, are the legend ! It's not a simple task to keep exist & even become more versatile/ intelligence  frm a very simple life form in the early creation until now. Some billions yrs already and all creatures are still keep adapting themselves for new environments (eg. climate change, drugs/ chemical resistant).  So both should fulfil each other.",1389052800,,2999,5.224532224532225
3983938,5,B002T5QM42,I'm a biologist so of course I love a movie about someone as influential to science as Darwin but I especially like this movie because it really shows his personal life in depth and how he really struggled both with the loss of his daughter and the publishing of Origin.,1387065600,,270,4.42

3983945,2,B002T5QM42,"I can't hear it. Closed Captions would have been nice. I'll rate it again after I buy speakers for my laptop, which I feel I shouldn't have to do.",1376956800,,146,4.068965517241379
3983946,3,B002T5QM42,"First a few facts: Charles Darwin did not invent the term evolution. It was a topic that had been under discussion in several forms for some time before Darwin began his important works. His training had originally been religious based as virtually all advanced educational institutions of his day were operated by one or another religion. He was deeply concerned with the possible debates that would arise out of his books. This was part of the reason why he was so slow to publish. Once it became known to him that his reluctance might cause him to lose his standing as a foundational voice in the modern theory and fact of evolution he did complete and publish. His wife was perhaps more religious than he was he was and she did express religious-based reservations. However she was closely associated with the production of his books as an editor and ultimately a staunch supporter of her husband.

With that as background I ow move into my opinions of the movie Creation. In terms of photography, costumes much of the acting this is a good movie. In terms of the writing and directing it does not seem like a reasonable portrayal of the facts. There is too much melodrama around the personal issues Charles Darwin as a father and especially as a person who had suffered the loss of a favorite daughter. It is a matter of history that Darwin did lose a daughter and that he lived in the time when it was normal for people to give themselves over to their emotions in the face of such a loss. In the context of his time many people lost children. Whatever the degree to which this loss scarred the Darwin family too much is made of how it might have affected his work as a biologist.

Had this been a fictional movie rather than historical fiction, had the writer found a way to disconnect his themes from the life of the real Charles Darwin this could have been a fairly good period piece. The effort to cast the evolution debate in the religious literalism versus science argument of the 21st century is not too far-fetched in that the modern argument is not radically different from the 19th century argument. What I find myself objecting to is the relative imbalance and implied directorial inability to thread this movie between Darwin's domestic emotional stresses, his religious and scientific internal conflicts and his social and professional external responsibilities. If that reads as a somewhat thrown together sentence; there is a similar feel to the movie.

There are other dramas and historic movie bios of Charles Darwin. I hope to find one better than the movie Creation.",1373587200,2,2591,4.727876106194691
3983947,4,B002T5QM42,Not easy to overcome the centuries of religious mis-direction and just accept the evidence.  Bettany did a wonderful job of showing the conflict that raged in Darwin's mind.,1372377600,,173,5.178571428571429
3983948,5,B002T5QM42,"More than anything else, this film is about courage - specifically Charles Darwin's willingness to go where his research led him in spite of what he had been taught from the pulpit, and the courage Emma showed in reading his manuscript and, in spite of her deep religious conviction, having the intellectual honesty to encourage its publication. In that same vein I wonder how many Christians of today have avoided seeing this movie simply because of the subject matter? I personally know quite a few. Darwin demonstrated that an open, inquisitive mind is a doorway to true understanding.

I found the scenes involving Annie to be especially moving, perhaps because she reminded me so much of my own daughter when she was that age. I think the movie can be summed up in a single scene - the one in which Annie explains she has been made to kneel on rocks by the Parson because of her belief dinosaurs were real. In a small way that is representative of the mindset which caused the Church to burn Giordano Bruno at the stake and try and imprison Galileo for their belief that the earth revolves around the sun... because as all but the most hard core creationists now know, both dinosaurs and our heliocentric solar system are realities.

It is ironic, however, that the director decided to look at logical Darwin as consumed by mystical apparitions.  True?  I don't know.  After all, the parent-child bond is not just a genetic connection.",1359590400,,532,5.2

Darwin suffered personal tragedy and he wanted to believe in the teachings with which he had been infused, but he couldn't ignore his well-tested observations and managed to stand up and tell the truth.

3983956,5,B002T5QM42,"This BBC production tells the story of Charles Darwin's struggle over publishing what he had discovered to be undeniable and doing so in the face of the common sense and faith of the time, including that of his wife. He preceded modern Biblical scholarship in taking away a literal belief in the Genesis story of creation.  In the film, one of his friends says, ""Congratulations, sir!  You've killed God.""

It strikes me as tragic that in Darwin's time (1800s), as well as  today, many have assumed that you must choose between being religious, a person of faith, and being realistic, a scientist.  Based on the belief that the only way to approach the Judeo-Christian religion is through a literal interpretation of the traditional writings, this is a tragic course that ignores our own experience of life.

So in the film we have Emma Darwin, Charles' wife,  who is devout in her faith yet has to deny the truth of experience in order to sustain it; and then there is Charles, who because of his inability to deny the truth of his discoveries, feels he must deny any possibility of trust in the overwhelming Mysterious Reality of life.  What a shame!",1348531200,,1152,4.725
3983957,3,B002T5QM42,"Paul Bettany plays a frail, if not half crazed Darwin struggling to write his first book. Based on letters and journals, primarily from Darwin's children, the film offers a human look at Darwin, the man. The theory of evolution is and its ideas are introduced sporadically throughout the story, making his work secondary to the tale. Jennifer Connelly plays his concerned, somewhat non-supportive wife who too must deal the traditional ways and her love for her husband. What I loved most about the film was the magical relationship Darwin had with his daughter Annie, clearly his favorite.

The downside I have is the name of the film and cover design. Darwinism has nothing to do with creation. The image of Darwin with the baby Orangutan, fingers touching are clearly symbolic of God and man in the Sistine Chapel. While Darwin's worked stepped on the church's toes (Catholic church now supports Darwin's teaching) Darwin was no astrophysicist. His work was strictly how life has evolved through small changes and variations, using his knowledge on botany. It has zero to do with creation.

I did not like Bettany or Connelly in their roles, nor did I like the screenplay and directing and editing of the film. It was far too haphazard of a story. The theme, what ever it was, wasn't driven home. Bettany and Connelly lacked fire. It was good to see once as a semi-docudrama, but overall it was on the boring side.

But recently, I discovered it by chance and it has become one of my all-time favorite films. It is a powerful story about life of a man torn between an idea so compelling, he could not ignore it, and the struggles which stirred his own heart, centered around his family. It is a fascinating and heart-wrenching tale which everyone should have a chance to watch and reflect upon, regardless of what your thoughts on evolution or creation may be.",1338854400,,560,4.5
3983959,5,B002T5QM42,"A BBC film documenting a critical period in Charles Darwin's life, basically from the time he returned from his voyage on the Beagle until the publication of The Origin of Species.

You know the basic facts, I'm sure. For one thing, Darwin married his first cousin, so at some point the question arises as to whether that was the reason that his oldest daughter, his favorite daughter Annie, was too weak to throw off what was probably pneumonia. But the fault might as easily have been the rather primitive medical care she received.

Darwin was so devastated by her death that he became ill. Or perhaps the fault there was a tropical disease he picked up on his voyage. As I say, medicine was pretty primitive. Ironically, Darwin's discoveries have had a profound effect on the science of medicine.

Another problem was that his wife was a devout Christian, and saw clearly that his theories had no room for a creator god in them. At the very least, they contradicted the Book of Genesis most emphatically.

So many things held him back from writing his book that it took a 20-page letter from another scientist who had come up with very much the same theory, plus a visit from his friend Hooker who insisted that he had so much more detail and evidence to present that he should go ahead and do it before the other guy. (Historians remember his name; it may have been Watson. Something veddy, veddy English.)

This is a very effective telling of a story many others have told. It manages to take a different angle, and a different story telling method, relying heavily on interpreting the mind of Darwin into dreams and perhaps hallucinations. Since there are also just plain memories and the time line jumps around a lot, it mirrors the confusion Darwin himself felt as he dealt with all the factors he knew were involved in the publication of his work. An important aspect remained his love for his wife and her devoutly religious beliefs.",1336694400,,1944,4.6725146198830405
3983960,5,B002T5QM42,"I will be buying this movie as soon as possible. I love science with all of its technicalities and stifling theories, but more than that I love its ability to explore and question everything. The ideas that human understanding has not yet reached its full potential and that it must be carried upon the backs of those daring and brave enough to speak up inspire me to be bold both in my discovering and in my ascertions of reality.

I felt all of this and more as I watched Creation. I cannot say I ever knew Darwin personally so I cannot comment on the ""likeness"" of the character in the movie with regard to Charles Darwin himself.  But I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed the contrast of the struggles, the failures, and the discouragements portrayed in the film with the final resolve to share an idea wrought with consequence.  When do we decide to stand?  Why do we decide to stand?  I especially liked how Mrs. Darwin, despite her own reservations, finally opens herself to what she fears in an attempt to understand the man she married.

This movie spoke to me as a scientist, as a person of faith, as a husband, as a father, as a human-being riddled with grief, doubt, and the desire for hope.  And it caused my soul to groan because it was not released to more theaters in the United States!  It makes me wonder when more people in the world are gonna grow up and dare to understand things they fear because they think such things may be contrary to their dearly held beliefs.  Oh, how the beauty of the world opens itself up to those daring enough to believe that there may be beauty beyond their current ability to understand it.

I very much agree that this film did not take the controversy of the theory of evolution head on.  It did not squash religion in the name of science.  Instead, I thought it opened both science and religion alike to the possibility that there are many, MANY things that either one has yet to understand, has yet to explore, has yet to reconcile...

I thoroughly believe that any person who entrenches themselves in any ideology so deeply that they cannot believe that they may have missed a boat somewhere has completely missed the only boat that ever mattered.  This film shows how at least two people got on board.",1330473600,2,2258,4.488997555012225
3983961,3,B002T5QM42,"Creation is a beautifully-filmed motion picture that looks amazing. If only the plot lived up to the on-screen scenery, it'd be a fine production indeed! Instead, Creation re-casts Charles Darwin as a madman, Emma Darwin as a shrew, and poor Annie Darwin as a revenant (if only in her father's tormented mind). It also seeks to add drama to an event in human history (the release of Darwin's theories on natural selection) already so remarkable in itself that it requires no gilded reinterpretation.

While Darwin look-alike Paul Bettany was truly excellent in his interpretation of the great naturalist, poor Jennifer Connelly was left to struggle to make something out of the filmmakers' terrible perspective on Emma, who was by any account I've ever seen nothing like Creation would have us believe. (Connelly also looked almost nothing like Emma, and never came across as convincingly Victorian in dress, manner, hairstyle or tone.)

Creation was bad enough to merit two stars for plot but the visual satisfaction it provides does go some way toward carrying its multitudinous defects. For a more informative take on Charles Darwin's life and mindset in the period before the release of The Origin of Species, or on the Darwin family itself, look to the many other biographies in both print and film that tell the story more accurately than the failed melodrama that was Creation. I'd recommend Darwin's Darkest Hour, and Charles and Emma as being two excellent places to start, though why not simply explore Darwin's books for yourself? They combine readability with a vast sense of intellectual stimulation that no analysis can hope to match. Just please don't make the error of seeing Creation and then coming away thinking you have an education on the Darwin marriage, or the writing of the theory of evolution, because you most assuredly haven't.",1328659200,3,1855,5.078688524590164

3983963,4,B002T5QM42,"For some time, I put off looking at this movie.  Just never got around to it, until last evening on a boring night.  As a professed Christian for many years, I had heard and read stories that Darwin had a death-bed conversion and recanted much of his thinking on the matter.  How true that story happens to be, no doubt only the grave knows for sure.  Whatever his eternal outcome, the movie was surprisingly different than what I anticipated.

At first I thought it would be heavily focused upon his scientific beliefs and conclusions about life and its origins.  Instead, it was heavily focused upon his grief over the death of his daughter, who appeared to him often in his mind and sight.  I will say that if the producer wanted to make a movie that focused upon a stable and brilliant man, who brought forth the truth of life's existence, it sorely lacked in that aspect.  Instead, I was drawn into a man who seemed emotionally unstable, drowning in guilt and grief, rather than a rational thinking individual.  It also seemed to contradict his basic thinking that we die and that's it folks, so why the constant reincarnation of his dead daughter like a ghost who has continued to live in another form? That element of the story for me, created conflict in the theme.

With that in mind, where does that leave your thoughts about Darwin himself? Were his theories tainted by his life's experience?  Does life have no meaning and all is random chance, because he could find no meaning in the death of his daughter other than the fittest survive and the weak perish?

The movie was interesting and enlightening.  Somewhat slow at times.  However, the acting was quite good, and I'm a tad disappointed that my favorite Jeremy Northam had such a small role.  Nevertheless, if you know nothing of the man Darwin, it's worth the watch, which will lead you to read further about the man behind the origin of species.",1322352000,,1915,4.640949554896142

3983965,4,B002T5QM42,"I love Bettaney and Connolly.  So I was really excited to see them both in a film on a topic that I am fascinated with - Darwin.  This film did not follow the voyage of the Beagle instead taking place after his return as he continues his experiments and begins writing up his findings.  This movie was far more about his relationships with his family, his children and his crisis of faith at the loss of his favorite daughter and how that affects his work, and his sanity.  I found the performances to be fantastic - the scenes with the orangutang were not to be missed.  And I didn't see that this was offensive in any way (as some people mentioned on other review sites) because it is a personal story.  No where does it say that religion is right or wrong, it instead focuses on Darwin as a person as he wrestles with what his findings may do to the religious society.

I found this to be a very slow, but interesting film that opened my eyes to another side of the man who still creates so much controversy even today.

3983966,2,B002T5QM42,"While there are warm scenes between Darwin and his daughter Anne and also, of course, between Darwin and his wife, the movie as a whole has a somber tenor about it.  The tone of the film is necessarily sad because of the argument being made that the existence of evil argues against God's existence, certainly an age-old argument.  To make the point there is a lot of suffering shown:  by Darwin, his daughter, and by certain creatures that are highlighted.  In making this argument the film-makers do not take into consideration how the fall of man that we read about in Genesis brought death upon all of creation.

Darwin as played by Paul Bettany suffers greatly from physical and emotional illness (just as Darwin did) and he is mentally tormented by what he sees as purposeless in nature and the needless destruction of animal life: in the film Darwin mentions the trout, for example, producing myriads of offspring which are then eaten by other animals.

There is some historical inaccuracy that I was able to detect.  The major impetus for Darwin writing his seminal book was not so much Huxley, but Darwin's receiving a letter from Alfred Russell Wallace who also conceived the theory of evolution.  Wallace, a spiritist, had received the theory in a vision.  Darwin's colleagues such as Thomas Huxley urged Darwin to write his book so that he would be given sole credit for the theory.  The film makes the reason for the writing of the Origin of Species a moral argument coming from Huxley and agreed upon by Darwin when really it was  the threat from Wallace that was the reason.

Christianity is rather misrepresented by the local village pastor who is cruel and unreasonable to Anne and in the end abandons Darwin.  This is an unfortunate representation of Christianity but it helps the argument of the film.  During Darwin's lifetime there were very sincere and Godly Christians who were providing housing, food, and clothing in Bristol and in London.  Thousands of orphans were helped.  This was only a small part of what was happening in Christianity.  It is also true that there were men taking positions as country vicars who cared more for a respectable position and  their hobbies than the souls of men,  but, as I say, there was much more to the picture than what they represented.

Also, Darwin's theory was not opposed only by the religious, a point made by Huxley in the movie.  It was also opposed by reputable scientists such as James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin, and Gregor Mendel to name a few.  Also, many who were religious, including many clergy,  jumped on the Darwinian bandwagon.  Darwin's theory was an excuse to disregard the Bible, or, at the least, not regard it as an authority.  This is the reason why in many religious circles today, the Bible is considered to be only myth or poetry.

Many of us can relate, I am sure, to Darwin's struggle (at least to some extent) with the existence of evil and the seeming lack of purpose of things.  For many of us, when we came to know Jesus Christ, we looked at God's creation quite differently and could understand the purpose of things.  We could also appreciate the effect that the fall of man has had upon the creation.  But we can watch this film and realize that before we were Christians we similarly did not appreciate God for who He is and His creation for what it is.",1309046400,13,3356,4.688888888888889

3983970,2,B002T5QM42,"The husband and wife acting team of Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star as Charles and Emma Darwin in this truly subpar realization of a most fascinating subject. The theory of evolution by natural selection is one of the most controversial ideas that any human has ever come up with. Shouldn't the film about the man responsible for this idea have some intensity and passion, perhaps stirring up some debate of it's own? Apparently that was not the intention of the filmmakers. They made a film as genteel as could possibly be made. It's even strangely disrespectful of Darwin himself, portrraying him as a raving loon at times, possibly a schizophrenic. This is really off the mark. Of course the man was deeply distressed by the death of his daughter but the movie has him running around like a crazy man, talking to her ghost.

The focus is too much on Darwin's family dynamic, ( something we see all too often in biographical films of great historical figures ), and not enough on what made Darwin the legendary scientist that he was. The filmmakers take the unfortunate path of trying to have the audience relate to Darwin in the most cozy and sentimental way. The more honest road would have been to make a film about his passionate exploration of the natural world and how he came to the understanding of his theory. There is little shown here about Darwin's enthusiasm and commitment. The film mostly focuses on his endless suffering. The daughter is too prevalent in the story. One wonders if she's the main character.

The performances are respectable. Bettany played a similar scientist in ""Master and Commander"" opposite Russell Crowe. That movie was a sea-faring action adventure but Bettany's characterization of a naturalist was far better than his dreay role here in ""Creation"". Jennifer Connelly has played suffering women for so long that adding another role like this under her belt doesn't distinguish it at all from her previous work. Overall, I would say this film could have been something if it wasn't afraid of the subject and attacked it with more passionate conviction.

The flashbacks are a great way of filling in the backstory of Darwin's life and learnings.  And the scenes of death are some of the most poignant moments of any movie; especially the simultaneous death scenes of Darwin's daughter and a baby orangutan.  Interlaced into the life of Darwin is his work and his relationships with other great personages of the day, especially Thomas Huxley and Joseph Hooker, both wonderfully played by Toby Jones and Benedict Cumberbatch (Sherlock Holmes).

The actors who were chosen were all good choices, but in general its not what i would call a great movie, even if i was not aware of the true history of Darwin. This has a very backhanded christian overtone, constantly beating into the viewer that Darwin was constantly miserable & possibly insane.

3983973,5,B002T5QM42,"In ""Master and Commander,"" Paul Bettany played Dr. Stephen Maturin, who is dying to explore nature on the Galapagos Islands--two decades before Darwin.

Maturin is struggling to understand the diversity of species, but he doesn't get a chance to scoop Darwin because of the pressures of war.

Now Paul Bettany plays Darwin himself--a post-Beagle, post-Galapagos Darwin.

He does a great job demonstrating the emotional turmoil Darwin went through, holding back the writing and publishing of his theory for 20 years, and finally only going forward with it when Alfred Russell Wallace publishes a shorter version of the same theory.

Darwin is physically ill during most of the movie, and there is the strong implication that much, if not all of it, is psychosomatic, brought on by grief and guilt over his dead first daughter, and dread over what his theory will do to society and is doing to his marriage.

He is ""cured"" (insofar as he is cured) by an early version of Freud's ""talking cure.""  His hydrotherapist physician sees that Darwin needs more than physical treatment, and encourages him to talk through his remorse, guilt, loss, fear, and self-punishment.

(Also a nice connection to Thomas DeQuincy, laudanum--opium, and the power of the unconscious.  Also an interesting follow-up, with Darwin and wife resuming sexual relations--Bettany and Connelly are in fact husband and wife.)

The acting is simply wonderful throughout.

Connelly manages to be both believably religious/rigid and loving and forgiving.  Bettany is great as the tormented Darwin.  The daughter, Annie, practically steals the show both as a real girl and a hullucinatory embodiment of Darwin's conscience.

Almost as interesting are the Extras.  Three professors are interviewed: one atheist, one deist but believer-in-Darwin, and one Young Earther (the world is only 6000 years old) who is also (!) a believer in natural selection.",1294531200,2,1912,5.288079470198675

3983975,3,B002T5QM42,"The focus of this flawed but still fascinating biopic is not on the scientific process that led to the discovery of evolution, but rather on Darwin's psychological struggle to come to grips with the death of his daughter and to reconcile his theories with the beliefs of his God-fearing wife, Emma.  The depiction of Darwin here makes him seem more like a tortured soul, a Romantic poet, or creative genius, than like a meticulous scientist who was also troubled at home and concerned about the moral implications of his work.

The filmmakers take quite a few liberties with the actual facts of the story, but the general line is accurate.  Darwin was a devoted father, and was devastated by the death of his daughter Annie at age 10.  He was himself quite sickly in later years of his life, and his wife did worry whether his theories would keep him out of heaven.  As the film portrays it, the emotional strain of his guilt and the tension between his wife made him into a tormented wreck, literally haunted by apparitions of his deceased daughter.  The struggle to compose the Origin of Species is turned here into a kind of gothic horror.  The irony, as it is presented here, is that a man haunted by ghosts and racked by guilt and resentment at a God who would take away his daughter, would create a document that has served for many to banish superstition and guilt from the rational view of the world.  Darwin did have doubts as to whether he should publish his manuscript during his lifetime - but to present the actual composition of the Origin of Species as the product of feverish nightmares, resentment, and guilt gives a false impression.  The book doesn't at all read that way - it is clear, vivid and often quite witty - and his wife Emma did not merely approve its publication with reluctance in the end, but helped him to make his ideas clearer and her editorial input helped him to craft its prose into one of the masterpieces of modern scientific literature.

The film looks good, and some of the best moments manage to illustrate effectively Darwin's view of the world - in which natural features must be understood as the product of an ongoing struggle for survival.  It's entertaining, and Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly deliver compelling performances.  It's a bit too melodramatic, though, for my tastes.  There's no real drama of ideas here, no sense of the struggle of discovery - rather the theory of evolution is treated as already worked out and the only issue is whether Darwin has the emotional fortitude to publish his account, whether he can reconcile with his wife Emma and achieve closure in his anger with God over the death of his daughter.",1292803200,,2681,4.678723404255319

3983977,5,B002T5QM42,"A lot of people seem to think this film is schmaltzy rubbish, or they get offended by the onward march of the Dawkinsian Atheist missionaries. Personally, I find this film steered well clear of both and it's refreshing to see a film tackle such a heavy-weight premise without making it too much of a documentary.

As someone who has been through the agony of losing faith (though thankfully not losing a child), I found Bettany's portrayal very convincing and I think the director must have had some personal experience of this issue, as his treatment of it isn't strident, but more sympathetic and the film ends with the curious message 'Charles Darwin was buried in Westminster Abbey with full Christian honours' (something that no self-respecting militant atheist would mention).

And then there is the portrayal of his daughter & wife. Jennifer Connolly (playing 'Emma Darwin') comes across brilliantly as one of those very strict Catholic women (of whom I know a few) who are quick to label any doubts as being sin. I think her real life relationship with Paul Bettany also adds a real emotional depth that is lacking in so many films about relationships.
Many mistake this for cheesiness, but really cliche often makes the genuine seem tawdry.

Lastly, there is Anne Darwin who comes across perfectly as one of those gracious full-of-life children who are sadly taken at a young age. The bits where Darwin hallucinates her & sees her running down alley-ways may be a little bit reminicent of other films (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-Ship/dp/B000089RW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost Ship</a>), but her acting is convincing enough.

In criticism, the film did have a rather confusing structure, where events happened (e.g. Anne dying) & then you are shown what happened leading up to it. It reminded me rather of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Family-Guy/dp/B003DZX46G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Family Guy</a>, where persistent annoying digressions get in the way of moving the plot along.

Overall then, I would recommend this to everyone. I swear I could even get my Christian mother to watch this & she would not be offended by it. That's not to say the idea is not revolutionary but, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-The-Origin-of-Species/dp/190460577X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On The Origin of Species</a>&nbsp;itself, it puts it in an agreeable way and so changes the World by silence and not by violence.

He even admitted the need for a 'Creator' to get the whole subject of creation going [See Origin of Species - the last page, last paragraph of any edition after 1860 and before some ""corrections"" of a year ago.]

In Victorian England, in the Scopes Trial of the 20's in our country - and even today - this is a hot topic.  Excellent book, excellent movie and still an excellent topic after all these years.  Some call this dramatized in the comments here - but I don't think you could dramatize it enough.",1285804800,,916,4.4226190476190474

Paul Bettany plays Darwin at three stages of his life, struggling with the death of his daughter, and wrestling with whether or not to unleash his theory evolution on the world and thus create the firestorm he knows it will both with the church and his religious wife (a luminous Jennifer Connelly).

It doesn't all work, and the philosophical arguments are occasionally reduced to near platitudes, but as an emotional portrait of suffering though loss and metaphysical confusion - the struggle with the meaning of life, love and truth - it has more than it's fair share of powerful and touching scenes.",1285200000,,637,4.94392523364486

""Charles Darwin's ""The Origin of Species,"" first published in 1859, has been called the biggest single idea in the history of thought.

This is the story of how it came to be written.""

The above appears printed on-screen at the beginning of this wonderful film that stars real-life married couple Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly as Charles and Emma Darwin.

(Charles Darwin's environment was one of extreme supernaturalism.  As well, Emma was a very religious person.)

This film is partly biographical, partly fictionalized account of English naturalist Charles Darwin's (1809 to 1882) relationship with his eldest daughter, Annie (1841 to 1851), as he struggles to write his scientific masterpiece ""The Origin of Species.""  The important thing to realize is that this film is not a documentary nor does it claim to be one.

(Actually, the 1859 first edition of Darwin's book was entitled ""On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.""  It was for the sixth edition that Darwin shortened its title to ""The Origin of Species."")

This film is based on Randal Keynes' best-selling biography of Darwin entitled ""Annie's Box.""  Keynes is the great-great-grandson of Charles Darwin.

Much of the film took place at Darwin's home, Down House in Kent, England.

I was impressed with the factual information presented.  All the major players who influenced Darwin and urged him to publish are shown and the actors do good jobs in their roles.  Special kudos must go to Paul Bettany for his superb portrayal of Charles Darwin, a tricky role when you consider that Bettany had to show how Darwin evolved from creationist to rationalist.

At the end of the movie, facts are presented on-screen.  My favourite:

""Charles Darwin's ""The Origin of Species"" was sold out on its day of publication.""

Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2010) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has many interesting extras.

In conclusion, this is a deeply human film that allows the viewer to be entertained and educated (a rare combination these days) at the same time.  I leave you with the last words of this movie (that are part of a very powerful and poignant final scene).  Note that these are the actual words Darwin used in the last sentence of his scientific masterpiece:

""There is grandeur in this view of life [that is, grandeur in the laws of nature], that whilst this planet has gone cycling according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning, endless forms [of life], most beautiful and most wonderful, have been, and are being, evolved.""

3983981,5,B002T5QM42,"""Creation"" tells the story of the ""creation"" of one of the greatest intellectual achievements in human history -- Charles Darwin's ""On the Origins of Species."" As depicted here in a series of flashbacks and flashforwards, the great scientist brilliantly played by Paul Bettany, is haunted by the early death of his beloved eldest daughter Annie. It has driven him away from his devoutly Christian wife, Emma, (played by his real-life wife Jennifer Connelly) who both blames herself and her husband for the child's death -- and yet is comforted by the thought of her safe in Heaven.

Darwin himself has lost his religious faith, yet he hesitates to publish his great work for fear of destroying not only his marriage but of dismantling one of the pillars of English society. And yet, how can he hide the truth as he clearly perceives it? The conflict is eating him up from within -- bent, sick, feeble, his hands shaking, he lacks the strength and determination necessary to fulfill the role history has allotted him. He sees the ghost of his daughter at every turn, reproaching him for being untrue to himself.

This movie is well-acted and well-written and very moving. One can sympathize with all the characters. All are flawed, trying to do the best as they see it. But it's Darwin on whom the focus must remain. He sees the world differently from others. His keen observation of life around him informs his genius.

When one considers that here today in the United States, the theory of evolution is still disputed by religious fundamentalists who make a religion of ignorance, one can understand his hesitation to publish. And yet, as he states in his great work, their is grandeur in his picture of the world -- and endlessly complex mechanism that produced one a mind such as his.",1283644800,4,1787,4.795454545454546
3983982,5,B002T5QM42,"Many people will be familiar with the creationist-fueled furore this movie ignited in the United States, but after watching this movie the most striking conclusion that can be drawn from the controversy (as opposed to about the movie itself) is that creationists love to condemn things sight unseen. Far from being an attack on anyone's faith, the movie tells a very moving and very human story about the life, loves, and sufferings of Charles Darwin and his loved ones against the backdrop of writing the Origin of Species. Indeed, though the moviemakers most likely consciously courted controversy by their choice of title, the ""creation"" referred to is arguably the creative process of writing that famous work.

Though laced with quotes from Darwin's magnum opus, the movie will not tell you much about science or the details of the theory of descent with modification by natural selection (Darwin himself never called it evolution), and though the story does not shrink from raising the many thorny emotional questions and tensions between evolution and faith, it wisely refrains from taking sides. Indeed, some might even object that it portrays the champions of faith, such as Darwin's devoted friend reverend John Innes, in a more sympathetic light than the champions of science, in particular Thomas Huxley's rather unkind cameo, which plays the only slightly sour note in the movie.

More than about the theory or the conflict, however, the story of the movie is a very human story. It shows Charles Darwin as a very caring and thoughtful man, a deeply loving parent (a notable rarity in victorian times), haunted (quite literally, but not at all in the way we have come to expect from horror movies) by the ghost of his beloved oldest daughter, and tormented both by crippling physical illness (historically accurate and unexplained to this day) and by the emotional rift the conflict of conscience and faith is driving between him and his wife. The larger issues are ever looming in the background, but the story is first and foremost about people and how they deal with the challenges that life throws them, the questions they ask, the answers they find, the things they deem worth fighting for, and the way they deal with the loss of whom and what they hold dear.

The movie can afford to make strong claims about historical authenticity. Much of the dialogue has been based directly on authentic letters and other historical documents. Many of the locations are literally the ones where the actual events took place, and many of the props are the actual objects and furnishings once belonging to the Darwin family and preserved at Down House and in other museum collections. In spite of this near-documentary attention to historical accuracy, the movie manages to avoid falling into the trap of didacticism, in large part thanks to the superb acting skills not just of lead actors Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly, but of a solid supporting cast including such flawless portrayals as Jeremy Northam's reverend Innes and Bill Paterson's doctor Gully, proving once again that there are no small parts, only small actors.

One final note on Martha West, whose Oscar-worthy portrayal of Annie makes her without doubt the best child actor I have seen since well before Harry Potter. I think she is destined for great things (beyond what she has already achieved here) and I can't wait to see her on the screen again.",1282867200,15,3428,4.977312390924957

His tribulations, smart conversations with Huxley, and the slow process of creation of his formidable text ""The origin of the species"" are depicted with admirable mastership in this movie that really superseded my initial expectations. Paul Bettany like Darwin proves why he is nowadays, one of the most remarkable actors of his generation and Jennifer Connelly like Emma his lovable wife  make a delightful couple.

Hovered by sequences of nocturnal beauty and profound sentiment around the irreversible loss of her daughter. It's worthy to remark the captivating sequence of the baby orangutan in the zoo.

I wouldn't hesitate to qualify this movie not only as the most rewarding films of the year, but besides I would dare to consider it the masterpiece of Jon Amiel.

The acting is fine and Paul Bettany pulls off a decent Darwin. There are some great scenes, particularly the Orangutan, the death of Darwin's daughter, and Huxley's cameo. I really liked the way it portrayed the ""survival of the fittest"" - not as an academic debate, but as a series of field observations in the outdoors - exactly where Darwin would have devised his theory.

It's one thing to avoid lionizing the man, but it's just as inappropriate to wrongly portray him as schizoid.

3983987,1,B002T5QM42,"After reading Randal Keynes' book, which is the basis for this movie, and Darwin's own account of his life as well as his scientific contributions, this movie was a terrible disappointment. Where Keynes is balanced and careful this movie is excessive and biased. It is a fiction about a character loosely based on Darwin who we are to believe is struggling to the point of mental illness to reject a literalist, Book of Genesis, account of the origins of life on earth. The movie squanders an excellent cast of actors and the opportunity to provide a glimpse into the personal life of one of the world's greatest intellects. It fictionalizes history to make it fit into the current argument between those who accept the evidence for evolution as spelled out in Darwin's Origins of the Species and the Christian Creationist's and their  theory of intelligent design. The result is a biased account of history and a story that makes Darwin appear to be a pathetic neurotic.",1279843200,16,971,4.849397590361446

3983989,3,B002T5QM42,"I wanted to enjoy ""Creation"" more than I did.  Certainly, the focus upon Darwin's private life - as a husband and a father - is an interesting way to portray the man.  Yet, Toby Jones' electrifying portrayal of Thomas Henry Huxley - even though brief - had more moment in the drama than anything the actor did as Darwin.  What I did not like about the film is that it made the tremendous genius look like a hallucinating madman in the same way that Vincent Van Gogh is often described as a mentally disturbed artist rather than show these men as the thoughtful intellectuals both of them truly were.  It is true that Darwin was emotionally wounded by the deaths of his daughters and that he did worry about the effect of his great idea on contemporary Christian understanding as well as his wife's profound religious views. But actually his wife was far more supportive of his enterprise than is shown in the film...and Charles Darwin's sudden rush to publish the ""Big Book"" after 1858 was probably spurred by the fear that another scientist would take the credit for the insights he had developed for decades. In summary, see ""Darwin's Darkest Hour"" for a far more balanced view of the critical year before publication of ""On the Origin of Species."" Alternatively, there is a very, very good ""biography"" of Darwin on DVD entitled ""Darwin's Dangerous Idea"" which is the opening movie in the 7 part ""Evolution"" series from PBS.

But I will say that the scenes of Darwin interacting with a zoo Orangutan are magical. Now that's something to marvel at.",1279584000,28,1549,4.7011070110701105

Ultimately many people believe that Darwin was agnostic or atheistic.  That, in what I know of him, is not true.  If you read his book, ""On the Origin of Species"" (which I have read 3-4 times) you can feel his thoughts and beliefs come through.  Ok, read just the last sentence, and that will be enough.

I have the strong impression that his falling out with the Church of England is not due to his lack of personal faith, but, rather, because the Church provided an unyielding stone wall that was dogmatically unwilling to consider the possibility of anything other than the strict literalist reading of the creation of the world as found in Genesis, while Darwin's 20+ years of observation showed him that species can and do change, appear, and go extinct.

Kudos to Darwin for his willingness to share the truths he discovered, and to his wife, Emma, too.  And Kudos to the BBC for such a fine production.

I found the BBC's attention to detail in dress and, as much as is possible, historical accuracy to be top-notch.

3983996,4,B002T5QM42,"CREATION is not a film about the development of Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution, and if that is what the audience expects it will be disappointed.  What this little film presents instead is the midlife crisis (the film takes place in 1858-59 and Darwin was born in 1809, having completed his 1840 'Voyage of the Beagle' after the famous time he spent from 1831 -36 on the HMS Beagle as a naturalist gathering data) when Darwin had made his observations of nature and natural survival of the fittest and was struggling with writing of 'The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection', a book that would threaten to incise his relationship not only with Christian society but also with his fervently religious wife Emma.  It is a story of the tortured man coping with the dichotomy between science and religion, between a man obsessed with his scientific discoveries while longing to be a good father to the children he loved. Yes there is discussion of his scientific theories, made mostly in his stories he told his children, but the book on which it is based, Randal Keynes 'Annie's Box' (Keynes is the great great grandson of Darwin) - a book of diaries and quiet notes about the Darwin and his oldest daughter Annie whose death as a young girl nearly destroyed Darwin - is more concerned with opening the windows to the family life of the great scientist than expounding the scientific theory we all know so well.  John Collee's screenplay serves the film well as does the careful direction of Jon Amiel.

Charles Darwin's presence  is illuminated by Paul Bettany's performance and the difficult role of his wife Emma is played with great sensitivity by Bettany's real wife Jennifer Connelly.  The pivotal role of Annie (Darwin's eldest daughter who seemed to have inherited all of the curiosity and imagination of Darwin) is portrayed by first time actress Martha West (daughter of actor Dominic West): it is Annie's death that alters the course of this story, that  event and the final reconciliation between Darwin and Emma after Emma actually reads the completed book (The Origin of Species).  The supporting cast is excellent: Jeremy Northam is the unforgiving cleric Reverend Innes, the other Darwin children are very natural in their acting - Freya Parks, Harrison Sansostri, Christopher Dunkin - and Toby Jones adds sparks as Thomas Huxley who declares that Darwin's theories prove that God is dead! The cinematography by Jess Hall is excellent - especially in the scenes involving man's first connection with the apes.  The musical score by Christopher Young rather blurs all the action into a Victorian mush, but the actors and director are able to make us forget that ill-conceived add-on. In all, the film is a family story - it just so happens that the family is that of a great man about whose personal life we know very little. Impressive work.

If you have to watch only one, I would go for Darwin's Darkest Hour. The family drama is there, but the science is there too. Plus it maintains a cool scientist in the background, whereas the Creation Darwin has severe psychological problems.

The book Creation is based on seems to be more factual than the movie. Annie in fact died of a form of tuberculosis.

Creation does outline how far science leaped just then, but how backward medicine still was. Of course, the stimulus to research evolution and biology helped medcicine along as well, at least by 1900.

For all they had to work with, Creation ends up as a surprisingly superficial movie.",1520121600,3,562,4.783505154639175
