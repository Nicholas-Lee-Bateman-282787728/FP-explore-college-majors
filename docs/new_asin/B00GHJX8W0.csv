6076109,5,B00GHJX8W0,"I bought this Malaysian release of Blood Prison.  Honestly I don't know if this is an offical release or a bootleg.  As far as the DVD goes, quality is perfect.  Audio, video and subtitles.  The movie itself is great.  It seems as if Naruto was abandonded by the Hidden Leaf Village.  It almost brought a tear to my eye when the whole village came back in the end to support him!  This movie held my attention for an hour and a half.  Never a dull moment.  One of the best Naruto movies.  If you like Naruto, of course this movie is a must see.",1339459200,23,544,4.144230769230769

It's different from the others, everyone has turned their backs on our beloved hero, sending the ninja to prison after Naruto ""committed"" a serious crime, but all is not right and it's up to Naruto himself to solve this mystery, stay safe from those that are after him and lastly clear his name.

This one plays a bit like a filler episode, and spends WAY too much time in prison with Naruto mostly powerless.  Pretty boring overall.

I also liked that they gave Hinata (girl) more of a role in the movie, giving girls more attention in a good way in a shounen (boy) series.",1420588800,,372,4.405797101449275

I have enjoyed the entire series and this movie is no exception. Of all the movies this one stuck out the most with its story line and the way it fit in with cannon. I don't recommend watching it unless the original anime or manga series has been read or watched almost in its entirety due to some chronological happenings.

6076207,1,B00GHJX8W0,"This movie was a travesty for Naruto! I've been a Naruto fan for literally years and I've seen all but one movie. I've seen most of the episodes. Out of those I've only disliked Naruto Guardians of the Crescent Moon Kingdom. This was worse. The worst thing about this movie was the rampant patriarchal idea that even if a father kills his son/child well he's still the father & should be forgiven & also forgiven by his son whom he murdered; utter garbage. In this case, the father kept the soul of the son he murdered in a magic box of sorts. His excuse was that he was waiting to see his son one more time to effectively absolve himself of his crime. During the time of his son's soul imprisonment the father was taking prisoners and killing them to harvest their chakra. He tries this with Naruto. As it turns out the writers of this movie have Naruto yell at and berate the son's soul-being for wanting final revenge on his father. Naruto praises the father for working all those years just to see his son once more. It's sick & wrong. They take Naruto down a very wrong turn in this movie. It sends the message that fathers who may kill me heir child should be forgiven and forgiven by that child. This perpetuates the idea that fathers, that males should be forgiven, essentially excused for murder, even that of their own child.
This sounds a lot like the bible story of a god and his son & both murders are twisted and wrong. Neither had to be done. Certainly a god being just that could have chosen any other way to accomplish his goal/s, rather than to choose to murder his child. But few seem to catch on to that subtle fact.

In the end Naruto actually works to finally destroy this very same murdered boy. Bad, Bad, Bad! This kind of propaganda perpetuates the incorrect idea that fathers/males can do as they please, have total control, and need not be accountable for evil acts. A real, true, and loving father/male or god would never do this! Though this movie is not openly about any god or religion, I personally feel the message and idea is present. I am not OK with that!

Personally, if I was murdered by my father & could still have awareness as a soul-being, I would never forgive him & certainly would not be grateful for his twisted desire to see me once more for absolution as it was strongly suggested in this movie. Also, in this part of the movie,  they have Naruto wash right over the father's serial murders of prisoners for his final desire. WTF?

Anyone who loves Naruto would be well advised to pass by this garbage & buy Naruto Shippuden the Movie: The Will of Fire!",1408752000,,2601,4.423799582463466

I got this on the recommendation that it was a great movie. I didn't think it was great, but I thought it was good enough.

This movie added a new element to Naruto but still kept all of its epicness this is the first movie we get to see with Naruto in sage mode and one of my personal pet peeves is that gamabunta fights to and in my personal feel every fight is better with a frog;)  This is the first time mystery is really added to Naruto in a good way. We also get to see killer bee in this and the rakage the opening scene its self is will drag u in

aside from how amazing the movie is it came two days early and in perfect condition. I suggest u go out and buy a copy now,this is just one of those movies you have to own",1395446400,3,709,3.8493150684931505

6076228,4,B00GHJX8W0,"And my favorite Naruto movie by far. I'm fairly sure I like it more than lost tower or road to ninja. Definitely worth buying. Bryce papenbrook who is the voice of English dub kirito voices the English dub young muku. And ryuuzetsu is amazing, and very pretty, I would have preferred her as the heroine of Naruto since she only hits Naruto once in the whole movie (she had a good reason-any self respecting female would have hit him for that-I would have).

This movie Blood Prison wasn't at all disappointing, it had a nice story & some great fight scenes. I also watched the short film that is included on this disc & it was pretty interesting too.",1393286400,,276,4.54
6076238,5,B00GHJX8W0,"I have been waiting for this movie for a while. When I heard that Viz was releasing it this month, just four months after they released Lost Tower, I was excited. The action was amazing, and it knew when to be funny and it knew when to be serious. Maile Flanagan was top form as Naruto in this one.

The story was amazing. Naruto gets sent to prison for attacking the Raikage, a crime he didn't commit, and once he arrives, the warden Mui seals off his chakra with a jutsu that could kill him if he even tries. Soon he finds himself in a conspiracy that could mean trouble for the world and it's all centered not only to himself but the also the prison and the warden himself and he must stop it before it's too late.

I love the movie characters. First we get Maroi, a shifty-looking prisoner who actually seems to know more than he lets on, Ryuzetsu, a kuniochi of the Hidden Grass Village who is after Mui for an event I can't really disclose here, because you know, spoilers. And there's Mui with the shocking revelation on why he did what he did, and it's NOT to rule the world.

While the movie does have it's faults (Where does Naruto get his cloak when he goes Sage Mode and why does it disappear when he doesn't use it?) but they're pretty much minor when you're having fun. I can say with certainty that it's one of my personal favorites.

Now all I have to do is wait for Road to Ninja because it's the next one. Get it done, Viz!",1392940800,2,1441,4.2101449275362315

6076243,5,B00GHJX8W0,"Now, I'm not going to BS you and make this movie out to be something it isn't. This is by far the best Naruto movie. Why? Because it knows it's a movie. Unlike other Naruto films (Including Road to Ninja), This film doesn't try to force some message from the show down your throat. NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG!!! I don't mind that in the other films (Except Lost Tower, that movie sucks). But Blood Prison is just a side story of fun, mystery, and action. It has a cool mystery/conspiracy that forces Naruto into a very bad situation. But it never contradicts what was put out in the original series or even the other movies. And the message it sent about Forgiveness and Moving forward after making mistakes was very well written and executed. Plus, from the fan perspective, it had everything we wanted. Cool action showcasing all the characters and SAGE MODE!!!

To sum up, Blood Prison has all the good things from Naruto and the other movies. It has the awesome concepts of the series. It has all the characters fighting like the Will of Fire. And it has the Message we can all stand behind from Road to Ninja. And, as a side note, THE ANIMATION WAS GODLY!!! It's a fun watch even if you aren't a fan of the series. Highly recommend to everyone. I hope this helps your decision.",1387152000,35,1278,4.438297872340425

It's either dubbed or not and I want to know before I actually buy a Japanese movie.

6076246,5,B00GHJX8W0,"Blood Prison was a really great Naruto movie. I watched the Japanese version and it had alot of awesome fight scenes. Whats even better is,Killer Bee is in it,fighting too. The Raikageis only at the beginning and the 5th Hokage fights too but in her Leaf village clothes. All the Leaf Ninja 11 are in this movie and this is the first movie to have Sage mode Naruto. I'm really glad Viz are releasing this early besides having to wait a year every time they release a Naruto movie. Maybe Road to Ninja will be released this year has well.

6076251,4,B00GHJX8W0,"About the disc...

The quality is pretty good. There is no English audio, as expected. The subtitles can be a bit confusing, as they don't always separate one character's statement from the next very clearly, but it really shouldn't cause much of a problem.

As well, there is a very humorous extra short story, concerning Naruto's second attempt at the Chunin exam, and how he messes that up in typical Naruto fashion.

About the movie...

Having watched several of the earlier Naruto movies, it's obvious that they follow a certain formula. Not a bad thing, and one like ""The Will of Fire"" can add some interesting twists to it. But this one, with the premise of Naruto being put into a prison, seemed to be an attempt at a departure from the usual, which is one thing that got my interest.

So, I want to give props to the people behind it for trying something different, and for largely succeeding at it.

Events at the end aside, Naruto is pretty much on his own in this movie--isolated from the village, in a hostile place, and being manipulated for reasons that aren't clear at first. The story is intricate and well thought out, much more than a simple ""find bad guy, beat up bad guy"" scenario.

Fitting the story into the timeline of the manga or anime would be problematic, but if you've seen some episodes of the anime about the time of the Five Kages' Summit, you may have seen some posters for it in the background of a few scenes, and it seems like that's about the same time events in the movie take place.

Of course, it's still a Naruto movie, and the themes of friendship and loyalty are there in the end. But it doesn't have a typical happy ending, either.

Btw there're a couple of extra scenes after the end credits.

I enjoyed it a lot, and can recommend it.",1377907200,2,1780,4.466049382716049
6076252,5,B00GHJX8W0,"I was hesitant to buy this movie, since it is not a dubbed version.  The story description, and my love of the series provided enough friction where I decided that I did not want to wait it out.  I can't be happier with my decision.  I won't go into any detail on the story or plot, other than Naruto is one of the best written animes, with excellent character development and well thought continuity.  If you want to know about the plot, read the Amazon synopsis.

I want to inform that the video quality is quite good, and if you use an upscaling DVD player - looks really good on screen.  While I only have a pedestrian understanding of Japanese, playing the audio with the subtitles HELPS the immersion process.  The voice actors do an excellent job conveying the urgency of the situation.  Unlike their English Dub counterparts -who try to emulate the spoken Japanese inflection the Japanese dialogue gives the proper weight and balance.  English Dubs always sounds like they're screaming at each other-which just isn't the case.  I have become accustomed to this screeching on many of the animes over the years.

If you're considering buying this, but hesitant concerned about the VIDEO quality - it is first rate.  If you're concerned about not understanding the dialogue - the subtitles work.  I was also concerned that with subtitles, I would 'miss"" the action because I was reading the dialouge, and there is some of that..but the movie is worth a second look - so problem solved.",1377129600,3,1490,4.728682170542636
