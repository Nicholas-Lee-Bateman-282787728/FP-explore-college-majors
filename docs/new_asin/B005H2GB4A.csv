""Former medical university professor Dr. Menton takes two teens on a teaching-tour through the major systems of the body. Dr. Menton is loved worldwide for his humorous and insightful talks that leave audiences in hushed awe at the Creator's wisdom. In this series, Menton employs anatomical props, models, and microscopic images to teach about God's amazing designs for life.
Geared for teens and adults, Body of Evidence is a 16-part series. Great for anyone studying the human body, plus all who want to be able to show their skeptical friends some of the most amazing designs that point unmistakably to our Creator. Produced in cooperation with the AFA Homeschool Channel.""

I looked into this DVD when searching out study help for an Anatomy and Physiology class. There is no information provided by the publisher on the Amazon listing and nothing on the cover of the dvd that indicates it is a theological lesson. I would have been upset if I had bought the item only to find out it was a creation science product.",1338508800,11,1051,4.898876404494382
