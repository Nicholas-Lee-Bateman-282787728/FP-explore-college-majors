We're hearing more about bacterial meningitis but 4 years ago when my granddaughter got it we knew nothing about it but the name. Thank God she survived with little disfiguration but she did spend 30 days in ICU on life support.

Please have your children vaccinated against this horrible disease.

The seller was very efficient in getting this movie delivered in a timely manner and in perfect condition.",1223164800,,461,4.75
8326248,5,B000067JJA,I showed this video to my Pathogenic Microbiology class for second year Medical Laboratory Technician students.  As college students they were amazed at how quickly the disease spread and how devastating it's consequences were.  They were amazed at how prevalent it is among students like themselves.  They all planned to find out more about the available vaccine.  I will definitely  use it again when I teach Principles of Microbiology in the fall semester to other Allied Health and Nursing students.,1047513600,6,503,5.2375
