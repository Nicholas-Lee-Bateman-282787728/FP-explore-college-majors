2711174,1,B000LP5CMA,This video is impressive to watch but is no help whatever in learning the movements and postures of yoga.,1209254400,7,105,4.578947368421052
2711175,4,B000LP5CMA,"Although you need to have taken a few months of guided yoga, this DVD is wonderful for people who love the Iyengar style.  It provides a basic guide for at home practice, focusing on proper execution of the asanas.  I took a yoga elective for one semester, and this DVD's simple narration and subtle music had me remembering all the comments my instructor gave, enhancing the entire experience.  However, if you like exotic locations and hi-tech interactive menus, this is not for you.  If you just need a little help and guidance practicing on your own, Gabriella is an incredible person to watch and learn from.",1208044800,41,613,4.754716981132075
2711176,2,B000LP5CMA,"This dvd demonstrates  a series of yoga poses, but there is no instruction or program to follow. To use it you would need to select poses, figure out how to do them and then design your own program. It might be just what some people are looking for, but it doesn't work for me.",1199577600,14,277,4.12962962962963
2711177,3,B000LP5CMA,"While Gabriella's execution of the positions is impressive, the dvd is organized in a way that makes it pretty useless.  This dvd is more a reference for how to do the perfect position than it is a routine of any sort.  Many of the poses go by way too fast, there's little to no discussion about breath and not even a discussion about warm up or cool down.

I'm sure this is a great reference for people wanting to see how a particular pose is done perfectly, but if you're looking for a daily routine, or workout, especially if you're a begining or intermediate student - steer clear!",1181779200,53,585,4.398148148148148
2711178,5,B000LP5CMA,"This looks like a basic yoga tape.  It's not.  What it is, is an archival DVD recording of one of the finest yoga teachers in the world, Gabriella Giubilaro.  Because it was intended as a reference for her teachings, it allows each exercise to be viewed on its own, out of any sequence.

But, if you just push, ""Play"", it's also a series of yoga poses that can be done as a routine.  Therein lies its genius:  if you need guidance to get through a yoga practice, this will do it.  No more looking wistfully at that yoga book.

However, in order to do these poses properly, you would have to a) study with a disciple of B.K.S. Iyengar for at least three months, or b) practice with a book by an Iyengar disciple who talks about the muscle activation that Gabriella is doing in this dvd.  (You're looking for cues like, ""No droopy kneecaps.""  ""Imagine four points on the soles of the feet.)  Basically, the idea is that you are using all of the muscles by forcing them to work, just by thinking about the muscles tightening while you are in the poses.

The results of the effort involved are threefold:  the level of concentration required by this practice will bring up emotional issues and force you to stay with the feelings; the amount of muscle work involved will turn you into a skinny yoga person after about a year; the stress it takes away will clear up your skin.

(It is possible to do the same thing with slow, heavy weightlifting, but I've never known a weightlifter who was without injury after thirty years.  I know a lot of yoga practicioners who have gone fifty years without a serious injury.)

In my twenties, I took a class a lot like this, three days a week.  At the time, I lived in New Orleans, ate and drank what you would expect to eat and drink in New Orleans, was in a sedentary, stressful graduate program, and, after a year, wore a size eight.

Caveats:  Not for beginners.  You have to start with some instruction, either via an Iyegar book aimed at beginners or a class.  This uses intermediate level timings.  After a few months you will need to increase the length of time you hold the poses, and you will need a book to tell you how to progress.

This is what yoga is supposed to be.  It's very basic. It's very focused. It brings with it power and grace.",1178236800,200,2287,4.377672209026128
2711199,5,B000LP5CMA,"This is an excellent guide for experienced yogis. Gabriella is charming to watch and leads one thru a practice that covers all areas. It is not for a beginner but exactly what I was looking for. I do my own practice now, in addition to one or two classes a week, and find that using her video helps me by suggesting the next pose so I don't have to think about it. There are also places where it is easy and recommended to pause the video so one can stay in the pose longer. I enjoy using this video and highly recommend it.",1455235200,4,524,4.097087378640777

This is not a video that will help you in any way whatsoever unless you already know what you are doing. This video is dangerously advanced--I say dangerous because you will hurt yourself from the get-go unless you already know what you are doing. This video is only a visual demonstration of an expert (the best in the world according to the promo) performing asanas, one after the next. No instruction. Don't buy this video unless you are a yoga instructor or have just returned from a year in India where you practiced daily and are already extremely advanced. My husband purchased this, thinking it would help our home practice of unsupervised yoga. No way. What a waste of money for all but the super-elite practitioner.",1426464000,5,852,4.802721088435374

2711213,1,B000LP5CMA,I expected to find vinyasas. Instead the DVD started with Gabriella doing a headstand. From there it was walk-throughs of poses. I was very disappointed,1400716800,,152,5.12
2711214,3,B000LP5CMA,"I thought this was more of a beginners dvd. She got right into poses that would take me years to do. I read the reviews and everyone likes her, I can agree with them that she's great. It just wasn't for me",1393632000,,205,3.9047619047619047

2711217,3,B000LP5CMA,"Gabriella is one of top 10 Iyengar teacher in the world, I was expecting a more educational DVD with asanas variations suitable for beginners, intermedia and advances students but this DVD is too flat and basic, that is why my evaluation is even generous, hope she deliver a must better DVD in the future.",1382918400,2,305,4.666666666666667
2711218,2,B000LP5CMA,"So, as all these reviews seem to suggest, YES! You need prior experience in yoga, and specifically in Iyengar yoga. Three months I'd say at the very least.

You probably should have taken an Iyengar class, or a few to know what it's about. I'd recommend following this DVD with either the book ""The Iyengar Way"" or BKS Iyengar's own book, ""Light on Yoga."" Their both really good references and they also have detailed courses in the backs of both books. ""The Iyengar Way"" may be a little easier to follow as it marks the levels of postures from Beginner to Advanced. Just going through the first two levels (Beginner and General) will take you over two years following the designated courses. That being said, make sure the ""level"" of the poses on the DVD before attempting them as they might be deceptively difficult.

The Iyengar style is a very slow style focusing on alignment, breathing and concentration. One holds a pose for 20 or 30 seconds, while some inverted poses can be held much longer (5 minutes). If you're looking for flow, Vinyasa, Power Yoga, you won't get it here.

Gabriella is very flexible! Although she offers variations and adjustments, she doesn't spend THAT much time on them... Pay attention to when she says, ""If you can, put your head to your leg."" It's understated but it's very important that you listen to your body. Don't force it to do anything it's unable to do! Don't try to make it look exactly as she does, as you may not be able to reach forward as much as her. Follow her suggestions for modifications whenever necessary!
For instance, a lot of pictures and instructions on performing Downward Dog often tell you to straighten your legs and put your weight into your heels, extending them deeply into the ground. A lot of people have tight hamstrings, and these actions are impossible. Don't hurt yourself trying to do as she says or does. If you need to bend your knees and lift your heels off the ground, do so. The principle action of the pose is to lengthen the spine. Bend at the hips and maintain a straight back. Don't bend or curve the back. Remember, you must make your spine long by keeping it straight.

The same goes for Uttanasana or other forward bends (Paschimottanasana, Janu Sirsasana, etc). Don't be afraid to use a belt to do these seated postures. Don't try to bend forward as much as possible if it means collapsing at the lower back! The bend in any of the forward bends happens in the hips alone. One must make the back as straight as possible, make the spine as long as possible. If using a belt helps you achieve this, use it! Again, these modifications tend to be understated, but it's very important to modify the postures according to your own body's capabilities!

It's a pose library for an Iyengar student familiar with the poses already and would like to practice with an instructor outlining the steps to take as you go along. I'm not going to say it's an indispensable resource because it really is not! It is helpful to see someone perform some of these postures properly, but I don't really think it's necessary to own this DVD. She helps you keep in mind certain aspects, but she doesn't take the time to correct any common errors people make in postures. That is why you should have already gone to classes to correct any problems or tendencies you may have in certain postures as well as establishing which postures YOU will have to modify and how.

Hope this helps. :)",1377993600,38,3449,4.6
2711221,2,B000LP5CMA,"This DVD consists of Gabriella demonstrating different poses. She is very good and gives some instructions. But if you are looking for a DVD with a routine that you can follow along at home, this is not the DVD for you. I bought the DVD because I have been practicing Iyengar yoga for about 7 years but recently moved and no longer have a group to practice with. I wanted a routine or series of routines to practice at home. This DVD is mostly for people who are trying to learn some of the finer points of specific poses. But I have to admit it falls a bit short there because her instructions are quite minimal. It would be better if she went through fewer poses in more detail perhaps discussing common mistakes and how to avoid them.",1373846400,6,737,4.3478260869565215
2711222,5,B000LP5CMA,"Years ago I took a workshop with Gabriella. She was fun, informative, precise and I learned things that have stayed with me. Her DVD captures her approach. She takes yoga seriously, she does not take herself seriously, which is wonderful. What other master teacher would offer a DVD with outtakes showing her tumbling out of headstand? The DVD offers a choice of English, Italian, Spanish, French, Japanese and Russian. It offers a master class with Gabriella leading you from pose to pose and offering great instruction that I have not seen on other DVDs. She is very much in the Iyengar mode of precision and particularization. The DVD moves through the poses a little faster than I would like but that's why God invented the Pause button. Also, you can study each asana individually. This is my new favorite yoga DVD. But understand that she doesn't announce, ""Okay, now we begin the session."" It is to be understood that the series of poses are for you to follow along with. Cinque stelle! Brava.",1369526400,7,1000,4.786127167630058

Not just a brain dragging around this mass of dead weight, called a body. I was looking for an Iyengar Yoga instructor, by way of a DVD, who could help me to revive my yoga practice. This is it ! She delivers a complete and thorough daily practice that will produce immediate changes in your body and awaken your whole being. I feel wonderful. She provides alternate versions of poses that may be too challenging for less experienced or rusty practitioners. This is pure, straight forward Iyengar Yoga.

2711231,2,B000LP5CMA,"I was so disappointed with this video.  After hearing great stuff from a fellow yoga student I bought this video hoping for great Yoga sessions.  The poses or asanas are demonstrated properly and such, but there are no sequences etc.  I guess I've set the bar pretty high because of the video I've  been using which has 35 different routines based on experience, time, and special focuses.  I'd have to be a very experienced video tech person to record and sequence these demonstration into sequences I find useful.  On the other hand if you current do your own routines and are just looking for demonstrations of proper form, etc i suppose this dvd would suit that purpose.",1327449600,8,674,4.717948717948718

I have been practicing Iyengar Yoga for 15 years and have some circumstances in my life right now that are preventing me from attending classes. So this video is such a blessing for me to add into my home practice. It is beautifully done, the peacefulness it brings really helps me focus. She gives very clear effective points to get you into/out of the asanas. I also love the sequence, it's very well rounded. Thank you Gabriella!!",1316822400,5,490,4.64367816091954
2711233,5,B000LP5CMA,"Before you buy this DVD, make sure you know about Iyengar yoga, and you should probably have some background in it. If you haven't heard of the style, this probably isn't what you're looking for and instead, you may want to look into Shiva Rea's DVDs or something similar (it's probably more of the yoga you're used to/what you expect yoga to be). If you've had practice as an Iyengar student, this DVD is great as a reference for home practice.

I took Iyengar yoga for a year, and now I'm moving to a small, rural community where the only yoga is ""fitness""-type yoga at a small gym...and if you've done Iyengar, you know that's not the same at all! To keep my home practice going, I use this DVD along with printable practice sequences from the Iyengar Yoga Institute of New York ([...]). I use the sheet (as well as books like Yoga: The Iyengar Way) for the order of sequences, then I play the asana (you can choose each pose separately) on this DVD as a guide for alignment and such.

You can play the asanas all in a row, but I can't see doing that- it goes too quickly, and there's a lot. I think that this DVD is best as an asana-by-asana reference when you've had background in Iyengar yoga. After all, it's hard to read in a book how to align yourself while trying to do the pose- hearing it out loud makes it tons easier!

Overall, great for the home practice of an Iyengar student. If you don't have Iyengar background, this might not be for you.",1277683200,72,1457,4.329670329670329

For a serious Hatha yoga (or Iyengar) student, I would definitely recommend this as a learning tool to enhance one's study in classes.  However, I do not consider this to be a ""workout"" DVD, as she does not really stay and work in the poses, since there are so many to squeeze in.  I don't think that was her intention.
