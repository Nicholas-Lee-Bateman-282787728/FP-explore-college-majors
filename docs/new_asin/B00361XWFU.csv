program when he sees the children laughing and singing, he begins to run and sing as well. I suppose he puts
himself in that film.. It makes him happy!!! AND that makes me happy!!  Thanks!!!",1391558400,,301,4.101694915254237

8389384,5,B00361XWFU,"I think this DVD is awesome!  My boys are 2 and 3 and they are just starting to do stuff that they need to be more prepared for.  The episodes in this DVD (which the Let's Grow series is only available on DVD) are all abut safety issues that kids face everyday.  They include what to do when there is a fire, encourage kids to wear their helmets, be safe during cooking, work together, using a first aid kit, buckling up and more!  My sons were really enjoying this DVD and I think it was registering with them that they are supposed to do those things to keep themselves safe.  I don't think kids are stupid and if it takes a big purple dinosaur to teach my son to wear a bike helmet, then so be it!  What is great is that this DVD features all the popular Sprout characters so kids are not only watching their favorite tv friends but also hoping gaining some knowledge from it!  I love the bright animation and that the DVD is over an hour of fun!",1278806400,3,949,4.1530054644808745
