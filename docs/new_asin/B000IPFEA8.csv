8147206,5,B000IPFEA8,"My husband and I grew up with Zorro, so I hunted for this for my 8 year old grandson and he loves the storyies.  So impressive in this world of DS3 and movies in 3D, the story of Zorro stills works for our grandson, and grandma and grandpa were smiling too.",1420243200,,257,4.03921568627451
8147207,4,B000IPFEA8,"This is a single DVD with 4 episodes.  Good variety.  Excellent clarity.  COLORIZED is different getting use to.  I would have rather had the b & w original versions.  But, I didn't want to spend a fortune to relive my childhood memories.  Mission was accomplished.

Thanks.",1354492800,,274,4.826086956521739
8147208,5,B000IPFEA8,great movie/  I watch it over and over again.  I really love Zorro movies.  I have several.  Guy is great !,1353974400,,107,3.9523809523809526
8147209,5,B000IPFEA8,"Continuing the exploits of our best hero of yesteryear (1957) - namely Zorro - and there will always only be one true Zorro, and sorry Tyronne Power - it is Guy Williams! This is the Zorro we all love and will remember most from television's true golden age. Here he is again in Volume 3 & the action picks up pace now.

As part of the Disney Movie Club collection, this is a must - regardless of the Treasures black & white release which is fast tripling in price online. The bonus with this set, is these are colorized versions and though my preference is actually for the black & white - I am still happy to have these. Disney again could have spent a little more time with the reproduction to DVD process but we are getting used to that and regardless grab these while you can.

In this volume Zorro begins his true fight with the mysterious ""Eagle"" that reared signs towards the end of volume 2.",1268438400,2,900,4.319526627218935

8147211,5,B000IPFEA8,"When I was a kid, the story arc of the criminal mastermind, known as ""the Eagle"" rivted me, with his dastardly plot to take over the California colony and sell it to the highest foreign bidder, and it still holds up well today.  The current films with Anthony Hopkins & Tony Banderas actually borrowed a great deal from this storyline.  Fans of these movies as well as Disney fans will enjoy it and see many connection.",1178582400,,419,4.5
