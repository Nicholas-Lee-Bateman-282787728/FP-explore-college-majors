1493417,5,B00005JLF1,"An Alias DVD (or entire box set) would be a lucrative end for the studios to think about. They could tap a whole other fan base if they did so. When you think about it, Alias' timeslot (Sundays, 9pm) is pretty obscure, and it would also give people a chance to catch up on the little things they may have missed in the action packed episodes that have left even the most die hard fans confused.
I'm thrilled that both the first and the second seasons are coming out on DVD, only months apart. Right on ABC!",1022198400,,506,4.22680412371134
1493418,5,B00005JLF1,"I am a true fan of Alias and it is the ONLY show I try to watch consistently every week.  Even though I have had my vcr record the last several episodes, I would DEFINATELY buy the entire season on DVD.  It is a show that is fast moving and doesn't leave room for boredom no matter how many times you watch it.  I did miss one or two episodes unfortunately and would love to be able to start over with the pilot of the show and go through them in order again.  PLEEAASSEE bring this out on DVD so I can buy it!!  It has something for everyone and doesn't contain much, if any swearing and nothing really that would make it objectionable for families.  My 8 year old loves it whenever he gets a chance to see it and everyone here KNOWS that when Alias is on, Mom is off-limits!  I am hooked and will be back next season for sure!
For those of you unfamiliar with the show- is that possible??  It gives a recap at the beginning of every episode now to catch you up on the background and history of what's happened up until that point, which I have never seen done before and is EXTREMELY helpful even as a refresher.  It airs on ABC on Sundays at 9:00pm EST.  It's about a college girl, Sydney Bristow, that was recruited to work for what she thought was a secret division of the CIA and learned years later (when the show began) that it wasn't really the CIA at all, but a group called SD-6 whom she had thought she was working against.  Thus the backbone of the show- she's a double agent and the only one she knows that is aware of the truth is one other double agent ""whom she hardly knows""- her father, Jack Bristow.  (Apparently it's been a strange, distant relationship between these two).
Her contact in the true CIA is Michael Vaughn (very cool and good looking) and the show plays with the chemistry they have between them and the fact that they can't actually get involved with each other, but the underlying feeling is they want to.
There are other main characters, Dixon her partner in SD-6 (who thinks he is working for the CIA like everyone else there except for Sydney, her dad and the boss- Arvin Sloane.) An important detail about Sloane is that he was apparently born without a heart (feelings and emotion that is)  as he is cold and calculating and the job ALWAYS comes first.  He and Jack Bristow have history and are in a complicated, twisted way- friends, sort of.  Jack is his right hand man, but if Sloane ever learned that Jack or Sydney were double agents he would kill them or have them killed without hesitation.  He does love his wife, but if faced with choosing between his wife and his job, it would be a tough decision.  He had a hand in Sydney's upbringing and thinks of her as, in a way, his own daughter, although any favors he may do for her will most likely cost her in the future as in his eyes she will 'owe him one'.
Throw this in with her reporter friend, Will Tippin and roommate and best friend, Francie (who Sydney has to lie to all the time to protect them, as apparently the saying, ""I could tell you, but then I would have to kill you"" in this show means ""if I tell you, SD-6 will kill you"") and you have one very intense, smart action/drama.  I give it 2 thumbs up and hope it comes out on DVD so I can have it at home.",1022112000,2,3266,4.223472668810289
1493419,5,B00005JLF1,"Whether you're a sci/fi, action, comedy, or romance fan, Alias can deliver.  It is one of the best shows, with never-ending plot twists, and stories to entertain everyone.  Best of all, it's aimed at the family!",1022112000,,211,4.833333333333333

I would recomend this DVD to anyone who is an action movie lover.  You never know what will happen next.  Your heart is pounding every second of the film.  Jenifer Garner is the best actress for the part, no one could have done it better!  This is one of those shows where you could watch it 100 times and still want to watch it over and over again.  ALIAS is a show that any actress would die to star in.  There is no better show than ALIAS!  ALIAS RULES!!!",1021161600,2,574,4.1454545454545455

1493695,3,B00005JLF1,"This is my review for the entire series not just Season 1.

While in school, girl gets recruited by what she thinks is the CIA. She, however, is really working for basically a world crime mob network. She goes on CIA-like (or what we are told) missions to get this or that or stop this or that. Then when she tells her fiance who she works for they murder him. She finds out who she really works for. Then she finds out her parents were spies. Then she becomes a double agent actually working for the CIA to stop her current employer who she thought was the CIA.

There are lots of action scenes. Lots of tech gadgets. Lots of impossible James-Bond and Mission-Impossible-like escapes from sticky situations on the missions. It was fun . . . until around Season 1 Episode 14. Then 1) it became old. same ol' stunts, same foreign back drops, same costumes, same missions, same tech gadgets, etc and 2) it became very very very weird in a cult like way. The plot became very heavy on the magic and prophecy type stuff . . . like that TV show about alien encounters with those two FBI agents or something. Anyway, you can literally fast forward through the episodes from that episode on and not miss much. Because there are so many names and locales mentioned in this crazy labyrinth plot they put forward they have to constantly review what has happened to keep everyone current. It is just goofy. And no one and I mean no one can be fluent in all the world's languages. Just silliness. The violence is on the high end--people being stabbed, blood squirting out of stab wounds, knives sticking out of people, people being tortured, scalped, etc. Wasn't even necessary to show all of that. We have imaginations. Anyway the first few episodes of the first season has a great fictional aspect that made the show entertaining and fun. However, it just became a parody of itself after that. Also the character's vacillation in her affection for her dad and mom just became soap opera like. I love you. I hate you. I love you. I am sorry. Don't ever talk to me again. You saved my life for the 20th time so I love you and was wrong about you. LOL I mean come on. Also, the idea that person can have a fiance, friends, go to graduate school, be fit, have a house, a car, work for two employers in a high stress situation, be fluent in every language known to man, dive off of buildings, be shot, be stabbed, be tortured, fly to remote parts of the world and return home the next day, etc is over the top even for fiction land. And the idea that a little skinny hungry looking girl can take out all those men . . . LOL . . . well . . . I did say it was fiction",1476230400,,2650,4.298
1493826,3,B00005JLF1,"I couldn't watch it all the way through as I kept critiquing the writing.  ""They don't do it that way!"" was my most comment disclaimer.  Mindless entertainment, but what else could you expect from brain-dead Holly-weird ""made for TV.""  I'll give the entire season to somebody that may actually not look so closely into the story.",1472169600,,329,4.839285714285714
1493827,2,B00005JLF1,"I kept watching hoping it would get better. Some shows do. This one didn't. Normally I'm a fan of J.J. Abrams but this was just awful. Garner's acting is just plain bad. She is not at all believable as a spy. The fight scenes are painfully fake. Yes, Miss Garner looks good in a dress but that's the only good thing I can say about her (though her costumes are just silly and some down right ugly). The music is annoying. The dialogue is cartoonish. I can't believe this show lasted five seasons. It might be the worst spy program I've ever seen and I'm a huge fan of the genre. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.",1471305600,,617,4.19327731092437

1493896,5,B00005JLF1,"I love this show, all Seasons! It the epitome of what good action tv shows should be. It's never vulgar, never inappropriate, never shows sex scenes, never graphically violent...just good spy action, laced with possible love interest dilemnas (which are entertaining), sprinkles of comedy, intelligent storylines and even some far out revelations.  My kids are teenagers and I can let them watch without worrying about seeing or hearing something inappropriate. Great show! I hate shows no a days...where there's always a gay or lesbian person, sex scenes and graphic, unnecessary violence. People are desensitized because of it..sad really.

1493983,5,B00005JLF1,"Alias is an older series now with formulaic but fun episodes. It is very well acted and directed, turning what could have been a fluffy girl-spy show into a puzzle of motivations. Jennifer Garner makes her very physical role look easy. And there's always cool gadgets and a new outfit for her to wear when the attractive star goes to the club to suss out the international terrorists. (International terrorists always base their operations in clubs for some reason.) The other actors also elevate the series. Ron Rifkin is dangerous, creepy, and obsessed, always just about to discover Sydney's double-agent status. Michael Vartan plays it both uptight and cool. His relationship with Rifkin's character is far more complicated than just being another double-agent, since they have also been friends. Rifkin plays the master manipulator, who plays on people's feelings and lulls them into a false sense of trust. This is a better show than it should have been, and credit to J.J. Abrams whose reputation just grows with the body of his work. I was sorry to watch the last episode.",1453766400,3,1080,4.972375690607735

1493985,4,B00005JLF1,"My four stars are equivalent to the five star rating since I'm not much for fanaticism.  And contrary to this statement, I am a fan of Jennifer Garner, and have three of her feature films also.  I am a heterosexual twenty-something male, so it's nice to see a pretty face on the screen after having a bad day.
I was also surprised to find Mr. Bradley Cooper, and whoa, the show is a product of J.J. Abrams, the new Star Trek guy.
I used to listen to extreme metal in years past, but I've gone soft, and some of this show is dark for me, but it is thrilling.  So this is Metal Jennifer Garner for me.
The season is very well crafted, but I feel it is played out too much in certain episodes, so I won't follow up with the next seasons. But that is how tv series go.  It is nice how you can watch any episode in this season, because they fill you in with My name is Sydney Bristow intro.  It was cool how she is a spy, then a double agent, THEN, she's part of a five hundred year old prophecy, the plot thickens; nice touch.
The soundtrack and original scores I dig.  They've got Enya, 90's pop/alternative and an industrial rock thing going on, and the commentaries on select episodes are informative and insightful for the trivia buffs.",1448236800,,1236,4.238297872340426

I remember laying on the floor watching with my mom and sister as we all got hooked about the same time thanks to my sister who turned us on to it.  Season 1 started off so promising for this series!  I think by season 4 things started to falter for me.",1406592000,,371,3.779220779220779

1494389,5,B00005JLF1,"This show is lots of clever fun.  There's humor, plenty of action and intrigue, and a very strong and attractive heroine.  Yet the soundtrack is especially admirable.  Michael Giacchino has scored the show just superbly.  Most t.v. shows (and films, for that matter) have too much music, forgetting that the soundtrack is the character not portrayed by the actors (and who wants a character on screen all the time?).  Mr. Giacchino allows for silence and quite effectively employs popular songs.  His own compositions are inevitably engaging and appropriate.  This show is worth watching just for the music!",1405209600,,607,5.195876288659794

1494475,5,B00005JLF1,"I'm really disappointed in Amazon Prime. For months it had Alias (all five seasons) on Prime. I'm just a little annoyed that it's no longer free. I paid the $107 for Prime and a lot of my shows are not on Prime. I was expecting to get Alias since it's was free before. So a little annoyed with Amazon Prime. I mean the other JJ Adrams show (Fringe) is on amazon prime. So I don't know.

I loved Alias. I own all five seasons on dvd. I kinda miss this show. Because it hooks you in. I didn't start watching Alias when it was in the third season. I borrowed the first and second seasons from a friend at work. He told me about it. So once the third season started I was already in love with the season.

1494476,5,B00005JLF1,"Alias is a five star series in my book.  However, the company that sold it to me, through Amazon, so-called ""Heart's Desires"" did not meet my expectations.  One of the discs was unplayable on any DVD player or computer from the first time I tried (""Please Eject Disc; Playback Feature May Not Be Available On This Disc"").  This is unacceptable in an item purchased new.  However, when I attempted to return it for a replacement from ""Heart's Desires"" (It is to laugh!), they refused to stand behind their product saying, ""im [sic] sorry we don't replace new items.""  I cannot understand such a flat refusal to provide one of the most basic forms of customer service.  This review is to warn other buyers to beware of purchasing products from this ""Heart's Desires"" outfit, as they will not stand behind what they sell.

1494958,5,B00005JLF1,Alias is like a New York strip steak every episode was high impact had you and the edge of your seat shaking your legs biting your fingernails and at the end of each episode you were licking your lips wanting more,1382400000,,213,4.219512195121951
1494959,5,B00005JLF1,I was not enthusiastic about watching this show but was bored so tried it. The show has some spoofs of James Bonds and Mission Impossible. Unlike Bond the show has developed characters and subplots. The more I watched it the more it drew me in. There is considerable violence but not graphic usually. I would recommend it.,1382313600,,322,4.666666666666667
1494960,4,B00005JLF1,This first season takes some time to get into - but then like LOST - it becomes an addiction. Characters are great. Highly recommend. Must watch Season Two- so think of this as the appetizer!,1382140800,,191,4.485714285714286

Big fan of Covert Affairs and I see a lot of similarities, like a grand franchise. If you want to watch this show, I recommend start at the beginning. It's key the entire series.",1381708800,,326,4.45

1495119,4,B00005JLF1,Didn't get a chance to watch the show when it came out origianally.  I am enjoying catching up on some of the old shows on my Kindle Amazon Prime membership.  The show is a good spy series with one spy organization trying to take out another.,1379289600,,242,4.239130434782608
1495170,5,B00005JLF1,"Now I remember why we enjoyed the series so much, great series regulars. Changing scenery, young unknown actors like Bradley Cooper whom I could not remember from the first season.",1379203200,,180,5.033333333333333

Pretty much anything JJ Abrams does will have that extra touch to it and this doesn't fail to deliver.  Strong characters, great story lines and powerful actors portraying them along with the fantastic camera and editing.  Hard to have any critic at all except I look forward to seeing all the seasons and hopefully we will see more like this with current things in TV and movies.",1379116800,,588,4.376146788990826

1495176,5,B00005JLF1,"What can I say about one of the most addicting shows off all lm time? Highly recommended to anyone who really likes a good thrill ride for an hour (really 42 mins.) of tv. The acting, directing, costumes, music cinematography, hair,  makeup, etc, etc, etc are phenomenal! I love the quick paced story and the way they moved from one location to the next in one episode. This show' s got a little something for everyone: heart, a forbidden love story, action, drama, humor, mystery, and more! Check out the show that made Jennifer Garner a star and gave Bradley Cooper his first big role!",1378771200,,587,4.59047619047619
1495177,5,B00005JLF1,Watched it on TV years ago & love watching it from the beginning all over again!  Great storyline.  I won't miss a minute of these phenomenal actors' action packed shows!!!,1378771200,,172,4.7
1495178,5,B00005JLF1,Loved this show and season.  If anything I'd knock it down a bit for not enough people getting hurt or killed given how many shots are fired and how many fights there are.  That being said it's not enough to take away a star.  Great show.,1378771200,,238,4.130434782608695

1495249,5,B00005JLF1,I totally love this show. Like any series like this you need to watch a few to understand and start to connect with the characters and their stories. But I have to say I love the character Sydney Bristow in this series because she is a strong woman through and through. Feminine and badass all at the SamE time. The complexity of the character is well written and acted. You will fall in love with her.,1378512000,,402,4.302631578947368

1495251,5,B00005JLF1,I have gone back and revisited this show and i'm hooked again. This was an awesome (far fetched as all get out) show. Plus Jennifer Garner is quite easy on the eyes.,1378425600,,165,4.1875
1495252,5,B00005JLF1,great service...worked perfectly and worked on ipad and laptop.  enjoyed all the episodes.  ready for season 2 already to get more Alias.,1378425600,,137,5.181818181818182

1495254,5,B00005JLF1,"Alias is excellent.  The acting is great and the story line is also excellent.  In a lot of series you can figure out what is going to happen; in this one you are constantly surprised by what the writers come up with.  Its compelling, exciting and addictive.  Worth watching, you won't be disappointed.",1378339200,,302,4.6415094339622645

1495338,3,B00005JLF1,"I think the plots are a bit thin in places, and the guy who comes up with all the little gimmicks and gadgets is straight out of James Bond.  Also, I personally don't care for the cross/double cross plot lines, or finding out that the person you thought was a good guy is really a bad guy.  It just isn't all that believable.",1378166400,,325,4.142857142857143
1495339,5,B00005JLF1,I wanted to start watching a show that wouldn't be too predictable and therefore make me bored partway through.  Season 1 of Alias is definitely the way to go with over 20 episodes to get you hooked.  I am already on Season 2 and can't wait to see what it brings :),1378166400,,265,4.076923076923077
1495340,3,B00005JLF1,"I like the characters even though there's not much depth to them. Action is okay, easy to follow, generally predictable. Something to watch when I have something else to do. I like the music. Every episode is a cliffhanger. I watched about half the season then jumped to the first episode of season 4. There are some interesting changes, but it looks like it pretty much running the same formula. I'll continue watching but don't know if I can make it through 4 seasons before my interest gives out.",1378166400,,499,4.617977528089888
1495341,5,B00005JLF1,Great season...I loved this show when it was airing but watching it again just shows how much the show was ahead of its time with some of the topics addressed. Every episode is like watching a movie...great continuity with storylines and very well acted. Nothing like it on TV today...great watch! highly recommend!!,1377907200,,316,4.981132075471698
1495342,5,B00005JLF1,Wish it were still on.  I will rewatch these episodes over and over.  Nothing on tv compairs to this season,1377734400,,107,4.3

1495437,5,B00005JLF1,"Jennifer Garner is great as Sydney Bristow.  The story takes tunes that you will never see coming.  She's the kind of kick a**, no non-since woman who never quits until the job is done and done well.  She also has a vulnerable sweet side that makes you root for her when she down.  Check out this series and if you aren't hooked by the first episode, then spy themed shows.",1377388800,,373,4.285714285714286

1495439,5,B00005JLF1,"I love the covert action, however it is too violent in the fighting parts and the actors don't seem to get hurt as much as the action would seem to imply. That part could be a little more realistic. The storyline keeps me watching. You can never tell where it's going next. I like it because I can watch it any time I want, but it would be boring if I had to wait for it to continue ""next week"".",1377302400,,395,3.95

1495441,5,B00005JLF1,Didn't watch this series when it was on regular TV as I can't deal with the commercials. Streaming it on Amazon is a real pleasure and lets me watch the series through to the end. Looking forward to the entire series.,1377216000,,217,4.317073170731708
1495442,4,B00005JLF1,"Although the quality of video is poor, the series is very good.  It can be distracting when seeing Sidney's hair as a semi-solid red with little definition.

1495445,5,B00005JLF1,"I liked this show when it was on 10 years ago mostly because I would have killed to work on the costumes!!! Love the variety and who wouldn't want to jet off to exotic locations and dabble in intrigue? There's the romance/danger of the spy game, and Jennifer Garner is awesome. Love Victor Garber too as her not-sure-how-to-be-a-father, and love that this was Bradley Cooper's first big show....",1377043200,,395,4.823529411764706

1495640,5,B00005JLF1,This show is never dull - the ending always leaves you up in the air which means you just have to see the next episode - sure glad I have Amazon Prime so I can watch as many episodes as I can at a time - oh - and so good not to have commercials - you don't lose the story that way.  Love the intrigue this show provides.,1376092800,,320,3.63768115942029
1495641,5,B00005JLF1,It's like watching a female James Bond. Gadgets and action with sexy clothes and actors delivering their lines with a lot of conviction.,1376006400,,136,4.956521739130435
1495642,5,B00005JLF1,"Alias arrived when spy action dramas had hit their low, even Bond had been reduced to a shadow of his former self relying on ridiculous scenarios and cheap laughs.  Alias reset everything with a serious real tone, a revolutionary amazing and powerful woman as the lead character and JJ injected what would become a signature twist, a fantasy scifi mystery that provides an undertone to the character-based stories.  You start to watch for the awesome stories and action and you stay for the complex characters you grow to love.  It's one of my all-time favorite series.",1376006400,,569,4.90625
1495643,5,B00005JLF1,"This show is great. I was so happy to have found it on Amazon Prime because I never had the chance to view it during it's original run. A must watch, Jennifer Garner is terrific and accompanied by a talented cast. Bravo!",1375574400,,220,4.261904761904762

1496023,4,B00005JLF1,I had forgotten how quickly paced and well done this series was.  JJ Abrams kept things moving and had the Rimbaldi theme running through the whole season.  And what a beautiful young lady Jennifer Garner is in this breakout for her.,1373155200,,233,4.658536585365853
1496024,5,B00005JLF1,This is a fascinating program. I'm glad Amazon offers it so I can watch more than one episode at a time. The CIA or not. The truth or not. Good person or bad. That's what we get to ponder. Well acted with likable but devious characters,1372982400,,235,4.130434782608695

1496029,3,B00005JLF1,"I still watch this show (haven't finished season 1 yet). The story is moderately interesting and they don't overdo it too much with the martial arts aspect. It has a kind of plastic-like, factory-made feel to the storyline though. It's worth checking out if you like spy stories.",1372723200,,279,4.833333333333333
1496030,4,B00005JLF1,"Filled with suspense and lots of action, this series combines good acting with plots that keep you wanting more.

1496277,1,B00005JLF1,Watched the first three or four episodes & gave up. Highly contrived & boring - seemed like a bad comic book come to life. The story line was a real stretch & not very believable - and the 'excitement' was just not there.,1370390400,4,221,4.162790697674419

1496366,3,B00005JLF1,"I didn't watch this when it was on TV. I thought I'd give it a shot. There are some plot twists that weave in & out and and move the deeper mystery along. However, each episode is formulaic right down to the musical sections when no words are spoken. There is a lot of action, but the fight scenes are really choreographed. I do like the main character's story though.",1369785600,,368,4.271428571428571

1496562,4,B00005JLF1,"Love this series - at the beginning.  Jennifer Gardner does a great job with this role and is easy on the eyes.  However as the series progresses, it gets wishy-washy.  Folks change sides all the time. plots get more and more far fetched, and through it all Jennifer looses more clothes.  Breaking point for me was when an entire team gets out of an armored vehicle in full tactical gear from head to toe - but not Sydney.  She is in a tight fitting tank top and camo shorts. Looks great! But makes no sense.",1368144000,,508,4.3052631578947365

1496664,4,B00005JLF1,"If you like J J Abrams, than you will like this series. It was an earlier effort, so you have to consider that it won't quite be up to his newer material. Especially compared to the Fringe series or the new Star Trek. Also, while the plot is confusing at first, you will soon begin to understand the consistent Abrams formula for character development with lots of twists to the story line.",1367625600,,390,4.430555555555555

1497391,3,B00005JLF1,"Nominated for 11 Emmy awards, ALIAS revolves around a young woman employed with SD-6, what she believes to be a subsidiary of the CIA. In the midst of her covert missions, Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) attempts to juggle college life, her romance with a handsome medical student (Edward Atterton), and her shaky relationship with her father.

When she tells her fianc&eacute; the truth about her job, he winds up dead. Suddenly she realizes she's not working for the CIA but has been hired to fight against them by a terrorist organization called the Alliance. Now she's a double agent whose mission is to bring SD-6 down before someone else gets hurt and the only other agent she can trust is none other than her estranged father, Jack (Victor Garber). Alias is a surprisingly good drama of the action variety full of tight-knit plots and clever twists. There's time for important character development between the action scenes, and several additional plots (both romantically and professionally) flesh out the time outside SD-6. One of the finest things about the show is how well we get to know and understand the motivations of all the characters -- not merely Sydney. This is very important when it comes to the villain, Slone (Ron Rifkin), a man so corrupt he ordered Sydney's boyfriend killed but who endures a chilling turn of the tables when his own wife is targeted by the Alliance.

This thinking mans show requires a great deal of emotional commitment. The episodes build on one another, often leaving off in terrifying cliffhangers. Don't start the series unless you're prepared to devote some time to finishing it. Add into the plot the attentions of Sydney's best friend Will Tippin (Bradley Cooper), a reporter with the local newspaper who thinks there's something amiss with Danny's death, and a number of side plots involving everything from romantic relationships to rat-infested apartments and you have a truly complex series with a surprising amount of heart. Even minor characters you learn to care about. The villain of the piece is surprisingly empathetic; as much as you hate and fear the man, you also abhor the thought of seeing him tortured. There's also a nice piece of romantic tension involving Sydney's handler at the CIA, a good looking agent by the name of Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan).

The show is not perfect but the first season is surprisingly decent. Unfortunate amounts of language creep into most of the dialogue (along with some unsavory comments like ""screw you,"" and ""bite me,"" and a** gets a regular workout), but the TV14 rating comes from violence (major hand-to-hand combat, as well as some shootouts, dead bodies, and explosions) more than anything else. In the first episode we discover this isn't a sugar-coated glimpse into espionage when terrorists extract Sydney's molar after she refuses them information. Scenes of violent combat aren't what stuck with me after the closing credits -- it was the implications of gory torture sessions. Mouths pried open and teeth drills humming, hot-tipped needles being driven into hands, necks, and arms. One agent, knowing he won't be able to get free in time to turn off an access code with his fingerprint, has his partner cut off his finger and take it with him to the keypad.

The series is an all out exploration of hand to hand combat. People are struck in the back of the head, hit with tranquilizer darts, pummeled to the ground, kicked in the face, thrown against walls, injected with needles, and tortured. Characters get bloody after being beat up (many scenes are painful to watch due to the absolute devastation of their faces) and bloody corpses are often seen laying around in background shots. By far the most intense scenes of violence come from agents forced to keep their cover by abusing someone else. A man's arm is broken under the pretense of getting information. Characters are tied to chairs and threatened with torture devices -- hot needles, a lack of pain medication, and other heartless methods. The violence is so extreme viewers should be warned that its realism, while never overly graphic (we don't see the finger cut off or the arm broken, but instead hear it) is not for the faint of heart.

Only three of the 22 episodes have anything sexual in them. The first episode is by far the worst, primarily through the power of suggestion. Sydney and Danny are obviously in a sexual relationship outside the sanctity of marriage. He lays on top of her on the couch and kisses her bare stomach, talking about how one day they're going to have lots of beautiful children. Uneasy about the lies between them, Sydney takes him into the bathroom and tells him to get undressed. They both climb into the shower (no nudity) but not for a romantic fling; she wants to tell him about SD-6 without being overheard. It's also implied most (if not all) of the main characters have a cavalier attitude about sex. Sydney's best friends are all either living with someone or casually involved elsewhere. (She knocks on Arvin's door one evening to find a coworker lounging in the background wearing his shirt; he wakes up beside her in a later scene.)

Sydney also falls prey to a passionate moment with a former lover while on a mission for SD-6. They kiss passionately and partially undress each other before the show ends; the following episode opens with them curled up together under the covers, just in time to make a daring escape. Sexual tension permeates a few of the action scenes, the most notable two being in the 3rd and 7th episodes. In a narrative we see what is apparently a sexual tryst between an ex-agent and a terrorist; his back moving in and out of camera range and a long hand playing with the chain around his neck (on which is the key the woman needs for her assignment). Later in the series Sydney enters a sleazy bar undercover and flirts with the owner while scantily clad girls sway in the background behind glass (and also overhead). When she's caught trying to escape the owner licks her face. Some of her costume choices are immodest, with short skirts, cleavage-bearing tops, and skintight gowns. She also appears in a bikini on occasion. If all this content were in one film only, I would never recommend the movie in question. But since it's spread out over roughly nine hours of entertainment, it becomes less of a problem.

The best thing about Alias is watching the relationship between father and daughter mature. Is Jack a good or bad guy? Each show reveals a little more of his character, first showing his cold utter lack of regard for his daughter and slowly bleeding into a true bond built on trust through trial and error. Jack Bristow is one of the most complicated of the show's characters. He's nothing short of fascinating and Victor Garber does an excellent job of portraying him. Some of his actions are positively barbaric and yet we learn to take his side as along with Sydney we slowly uncover the truth. The second element I liked was the fact her grief seems real. Too many shows replace the lost romantic lead early on and fail to portray a realistic grieving period. Sydney lives through amazing and dangerous situations but doesn't go home feeling good about herself. She cries for lost comrades, resists the romantic advances of the two men in her life, and remains faithful to Danny's memory.

The bad thing about Alias is  the brutal implied violence, mildly crude language, and one element which concerns me: an agent rationalizing bad behavior. A figure we grow to respect and even like is also uncommonly brutal when faced with decisions. He breaks rules at the CIA, imposes cruel torture methods to gain information, and kills one of his informants at point-blank range. This sends mixed signals to young people searching for heroes in our corrupt society.

Yes, travel to exotic foreign lands, living in a world of high fashion, rubbing elbows (while in disguise) with the wealthy and powerful. . .all in a day's work for this student trying to hold down a full-time job without flunking out of her graduate program, while contending with her distant father and the romantic machinations of a nosy journalist (is there any other kind?) and her protective CIA handler.  Dianna Rigg (Emma Peale of ""The Avengers""), meet your protege, Jennifer Garner (Sidney Bristow), who was later succeded by Piper Perabo (CIA agent Annie Walker of ""Covert Affairs"").

Needless to say I was disappointed by both. I ran both the HD version on ROKU, and the DVD version through my DVD player. The DVD's sound was same as HD version on prime, but the picture quality was really lacking. I am back to watching the series on Prime.

1497825,4,B00005JLF1,"Alias is worth watching to see an early product of JJ Abrams.  It's not a great show, but it is a good one.

Sydney is a grad student...and an covert operative for a secret organization that she initially believes to be a branch of the CIA.  But is it?

This mystery/thriller/action/drama hybrid throws so much at us that some of it is bound to stick, and does.  But for all that it has it's shortcomings as well.  Jennifer Garner is adequate in the role, but shows her weaknesses as an actress as well, the result is adequate, but not great.

The true genius of this show is it's structure, a unique, eclectic blend of flashback and forward.  Sound familiar?  It should for all fans of LOST.  But having said that, it's not the same, by a long shot, only similar.  Not similar enough to anger LOST fans, but similar enough for LOST fans to recognize it fairly quickly and find themselves settling in to a familiar structure.

The real advantage of the structure is that it forgives any shortcomings of the actors/actresses in the series, including Ms. Jennifer Garner who used Alias as a show to pole vault herself into an A-list career...for a short time.",1362787200,,1157,4.563106796116505

Weird seeing Nokia candy bar phones again :) but anyways this is a good spy/double agent tv series. Pretty entertaining show with alot of unexpected twists and Jennifer Garner looking different almost every week.

In the 1st month, my wife and I watched the 1st season of American Horror Story and really enjoyed it. We signed up for a year's service (or more accurately, decided not to cancel after the 1st month) and were looking for something new to watch together that would hold her attention after the youngest went to bed - my wife usually fell asleep by this time.

Jennifer Garner does a great job in this Spy vs. Spy series that has a lot of action and always ends with a decent cliff hanger. The situations she gets into and out of are over the top (Have you seen the new Bruce Willis movie!?), and in reality the life expectancy of such an agent wouldn't be more than a couple of weeks, but there is a decent story line that runs through it and it fits the bill, particularly given what is on prime time tv these days.

AGAIN, I loved the intrigue and the character, Sydney Bristow. (Still do, which is why I am watching the series again on Amazon!)
However, this series also introduced me to J. J. ""Bad Robot"" Abrams. So far, I have been fascinated by all of his works that I have had the pleasure to see.

1498616,5,B00005JLF1,"This first season of ""Alias"" still holds up. Abrams and company know how to combine espionage and science fiction with classic story lines to create something that draws viewers back each week. Sydney Bristow remains one of my favorite characters. On a quiet Sunday morning, I like to tune in to my Amazon account and stream older tv series. And  when I saw ""Alias"" was available, I dove right in--Season One and Anna Espinoza! It doesn't get any better than Rimbaldi and the Bristows' awkward relationship. Don't forget to pay attention to the show's real star--Marshall--the tech guy. Watch ""Alias"" on Amazon and see how JJ Abrams began building his creative aesthetic--one mystery inside another and another and another....",1360454400,,726,5.100840336134453

The very first episode was amazing, the characters are strong,  the situations are complex and interesting and the fighting is great (though if I see one more person rebound from a sharp kick to the head,  those kicks hurt, you wouldn't just bounce back!)

However 12 episodes in,  and she is just a bit too perfect for me.  All those languages, all those skills,  and she's never killed anyone...  I like some of the more outre scenarios, but I am not as gripped as I had hoped I would be.

I'm a fan of the new series on TNT that has a similiar theme, but now I don't like it as much when I see this series is a 100% better.

I can like over the top cliff hanging tv series with a little extra cheese on top, but I actually found myself gritting my teeth or fast forwarding through dragging reflective pop emo song montages that occur more than once in each episode.

(normal grad student life scenes>extreme double secret agent missions>near capture> too love or not to love my dad; repeat.  There are too many gaping holes in the story for me to overlook and I have no problem suspending disbelief when artistically led that way.

1499005,5,B00005JLF1,"Put simply: no one had ever seen a show like Alias when it began airing in 2001. The full-act teasers, the serial nature of the show despite being on network television, the constant use of one episode's final scene as a sort of teaser for the next that led to endless cliff-hangers, and nearly all the unique elements of story and production that have come to be synonymous with Abrams (or particularly the more commercially successful Lost that used so many of the exact format ideas) were not only pioneered but mastered by season 1 of Alias. It's a real tribute to the show as a whole for me that this is only my personal third favorite season of the show yet for me it was an easy 5-star rating and a season of television I would urge anyone to watch without hesitation. I consider this a truly GREAT season of TV, amazingly I just liked the next two of the show even more. However, I warn you to be sure you have plenty of time on your hands for the next few days before you watch the pilot because you will not want to quit running through the episodes once you get started.

Season 1 wastes no time in getting started with the major story lines of the show yet somehow you quickly identify with the supporting characters and find yourself attached to their development as well. Will's investigations into SD6, the murder of Danny, etc. comprise some of the great moments of the season I believe. The balance between action and mythology on one hand and daily life, supporting character, etc. on the other was perhaps better achieved in this season- season 2 did this nicely as well though- than any other I've seen on television and if you're looking to find a fun, intense show that still lets you identify with the people you're watching then I think the first two seasons of Alias will be among the best you could ever hope to find.",1340409600,2,1843,4.452662721893491

1499010,5,B00005JLF1,"Even at a young age, JJ Abrams had brilliant sensibilities showing his skill as a future filmmaker. Before the release of John Carpenter's Escape from New York Abrams father, Gerald W Abrams (nominated for the miniseries Nuremberg and Family of Spies), took him to see a rough cut of the film as young JJ was a Carpenter fan. After the film Gerald suggested cutting out the original opening sequence of the flick, while a 15-year-old JJ suggested that Carpenter make it clearer that the character of Maggie dies at the end. (Sorry if I spoiled the end, I haven't personally seen the flick at the time of this writing, so I spoiled it for myself by knowing this bit of trivia.) Carpenter followed both suggestions to the letter.

Since then Abrams has made major waves in the entertainment industry with movies such as Mission Impossible 3 and Star Trek as well as TV series such as Lost and Fringe. While he may have also created Felicity, it could be said that Alias was the jumping off point for a lot of the advancement he has made in his career. Interesting for a show that started off as an in-joke from Felicity. ABC was so impressed with Alias that they requested Abrams to help develop a serialized show that would mirror Survivor and Cast Away, which would become zeitgeist known as Lost. A big name star was also impressed with the show and requested him to take over directorial duties for a major franchise. That star was Tom Cruise, and the film he went on to direct was Mission Impossible 3 which also became the biggest budget feature film ever directed by a first time filmmaker.

Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) works for SD-6, a black ops organization she was fooled into believing was a part of the CIA. But when her fianc Danny (Edward Atterton) is murdered because she told him the truth about her secret life, she learns from an unlikely source that SD-6 is not a member of the CIA: her somewhat estranged father Jack Bristow (Victor Garber). Driven by her anger toward the organization over the death of Danny and the fact that she's been lied to for years, she goes to the CIA to work as double agent to take down SD-6 and its nefarious boss Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin) with the help of her CIA handler Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan). Meanwhile, Sydney's friend Will Tippin (Bradley Cooper) who works as a reporter suspects more behind the death of Danny and seeks to find out the truth, but may put himself and his friends in harm's way by doing so.

I have to be honest and say that I'm not a Jennifer Garner fan. I don't find her attractive the way many others do, and in the select few films I've chosen to view that featured her didn't really demonstrate her ability as a very capable actress. For that reason it took me a while to finally decide to give this show a try. The end result surprised me. It turns out that Abrams knows how to effectively use her and she pulls off a very competent performance in dramatic action. It also helps that she's surrounded by immense talent with the brilliant Victor Garber, Ron Rifkin, Michael Vartan, and Bradley Cooper to play off. Everyone does their part admirably, often showing a talent for portraying characters with hidden agendas with undercurrents that must stay just beneath the surface.

Here JJ Abrams crafts a drama that hits many notes throughout one full season. It could have been easy for this spy series to get mired in gadgets and especially in the fantastical Sci-Fi mythology of the series. Abrams and his writers walk a fine line though, keeping the action ramped up and grounding the series in the characters and their relationships. Alias is really the story of relationships in the midst of hidden secrets. Sydney must hide her true career from her friends and her ties to the CIA from SD-6, Sloane must hide the truth of SD-6's affiliations (or lack thereof) with the CIA from his employees, and Will must hide his investigation of Danny's murder from Sydney. In a subplot we even find out that Sydney's friend's fianc is hiding an affair, further demonstrating the season's views of reconciling relationships while having to remain covert about the truth.

The premiere season of Alias is one of those rare premiere seasons that is perfection. I almost wish that I had the opportunity to catch this when it first aired, but at the same time I'm glad I don't have to wait till the next week to know what's going to happen next. Throughout season 1 of Alias there are many instances where episodes end on major cliffhangers, something that ABC became frustrated with during season 2 and ordered to be rectified halfway through the season. I highly recommend that you give this a try, it's highly enjoyable, filled with action, and character development and drama to keep you invested in the lives of these characters.

4.5/5

1499119,4,B00005JLF1,"Approximately three-parts ludicrous in my most considered estimate, but as ludicrous is now the new plausible I guess it's only pedants like me who trouble ourselves over questions like how agents, after a mere year or so of training, are fluent in just about every language under the sun, have acquired martial-arts skills that would put Olympic medallists to shame, possess computer skills that enable them to hack into the most sophisticated databases in a matter of seconds, etc, etc. However, the good news is that once you learn to relax and accept these as mere conventions of TVLand then it becomes relatively easy to accept supermodel lookalikes as not only secret agents but able to maintain their alluring looks despite almost daily being tortured, beaten, and kick-boxed into near-submission. And, to be fair, Jennifer Garner is probably marginally less unbelievable than Uma Thurman in this kind of role; the martial arts sequences actually look quite believable in a technicolour kind of way. And I think concentrating on martial arts as the kickass method of choice rather than boring old guns is a real aesthetic positive.

You'd expect such implausibilities would be played at least only half-seriously but the makers of this series deliver it almost completely straight - unless they're being extremely subtle in their satirical intent. At first, I thought they'd misjudged their tone but as the series developed I found the stolid insistence that these things could Really Happen became more and more convincing. About midway through Disc Three, I admit, I was starting to flag. There was far too much time devoted to Sydney's private life and I found this soppy and dull. I was craving some bite and pizzazz and luckily Quentin Tarantino rode to the rescue. His guest-star role in a double-episode about half-way through (with what sounds like his own improvised dialogue - sans the customary obscenities for Network TV consumption) simply ignited the whole series and from then on it rode the momentum to a resounding climax on Disc Six. I'm really looking forward to seeing how Season Two pans out. Are Sydney and her mother going to warmly embrace in the opening scene......?

Very good cast too with too many standouts to single out but only average dialogue, excellent visuals, generally a far better than average series. Just try to get over the dullish patch about a third of the way through and I think you'll be happy you got this one.",1321920000,,2464,4.992700729927007
1499120,4,B00005JLF1,I love this series and was glad to find it.  I plan on purchasing the rest of the seasons. I received this in good time.,1317168000,,120,3.8
1499121,5,B00005JLF1,"I watched Alias this summer in 2011 and I couldn't believe this show was made in 2001.

Alias Season 1 has quickly become one of my all-time favorites.  I was surprised to find how much I enjoyed this show since I'm not big on the spy genre.  On the surface, Alias seems like an action show with a female lead in sexy outfits, but it is much more than that.  It is a tour de force of tight writing, sharp dialogue, outstanding acting, and creative vision.  Alias is the story of Sydney Bristow -- the girl next door, straight-A student type who happens to sign up for spy work, out of patriotic inspiration and boredom.  Most spies and action heroes are cold, calculating personalities, so this was a refreshing concept.  The show works for me because as absurd as the plot twists become, I believe in Sydney Bristow.  Her character is always grounded and she is easy to relate to, because she is sensitive and wears her heart on her sleeve.  This is J.J. Abram's trademark -- the drama that is both realistic and absurd at the same time.  Sydney does crazy spy work and juggles both a double-life and double-agent job, but she comes home to hang out with her friends who know nothing about her spy life, and she struggles with her relationships with her father and her paternalistic boss.  As weird as the espionage world gets, we can always relate to hating your boss, trying to get along with parents, and managing work-life balance.  It's hard to find compelling 20-something female leading roles in Hollywood, which makes me appreciate Sydney Bristow on a personal level.

The show further innovates by mixing different genres: espionage, mystery/thriller, and a little soapy drama.  I love cross-genre shows because there is more variety, less chance of falling into cliches, and the audience doesn't quite know what to expect.  The action sequences, camera work, and costumes are film quality.  You will have fun watching Sydney execute her missions.  I'm not a connoisseur of spy shows, but I was entertained by the different wigs/dresses, car chases, and parachuting.

I really enjoyed the writing and fast-paced plotting.  Not many words are wasted.  The action sequences are cut extremely tight.  Unlike other spy shows, there isn't much mission preparation or debriefing shown; we just see Sydney stealing item X and then we're back in Los Angeles.  One moment Sydney is in spy headquarters and then she's having beer at her apartment with her best buddies.  Yet the show takes the time to explore Sydney's emotional reactions, which keeps the show grounded in reality.

The big selling point for me is Jennifer Garner's performance.  She is naturally charismatic and has probably the world's best smile, making Sydney probably the most likable spy in cinematic history.  (It seems like every male character on the show is in love with Sydney -- a joke, but not far from the truth.)  Garner clearly put 100% effort into her acting.  Watch her face when she runs -- it's clear that both Garner and Sydney take their job seriously.  Sydney Bristow is an extremely demanding role (Sydney is in almost every scene, stunt sequences, foreign languages, dramatic acting) and Garner does everything very well.  The rest of the cast is absolutely stellar.  I don't know how many TV shows have ever had a cast this good.  There are two critically acclaimed Broadway actors (Victor Garber and Ron Rifkin) and Michael Vartan, Bradley Cooper, and Merrin Dungey have all gone on to great careers (in particular Cooper has become a huge star).  Kevin Weisman is funny and charming as the comic relief, and Carl Lumbly, as Sydney's partner, lends gravity and presence to the show.  Every single cast member is fantastic and my only complaint is that I wish Vartan and Dungey's characters could have been written better.  The superb acting is what really makes the show work.  In the hands of lesser actors, the show would have become campy.

If you've read this far, you should buy this series now!  I'll leave you with the words of a TV critic:

""Alias isn't a perfect series, by any means. But I do think it's the most important show of the past ten years that's been completely swept under the rug. ... I have a sneaking suspicion that few shows have had a greater impact on the television landscape today."" - Ryan McGee, AV Club

1499122,3,B00005JLF1,"This was a fun, bubble-gum pop kind of a show in its day. I was a fan when it first aired, largely because it featured some engaging performances by the principles and because the producers were able to create some fun (albeit it often wholly preposterous) storylines on a limited TV budget. Garner, Garber, and Rifkin are especially good, although the talents of Carl Lumbly, Bradley Cooper, and Kevin Weisman should not be overlooked. Good, fun entertainment, although the first two seasons are really the only two worth investing in. After Season 2, the plots get a little too stale or a little too convoluted. But if you're looking for two solid seasons of entertainment and can afford to skip the rest, this is a solid bet.",1310169600,2,728,4.74015748031496
1499123,5,B00005JLF1,"I never once watched this show while it was being broadcast - it looked too ""MTV"" for me. My wife and I were in a local used book/DVD store and saw a used copy of this real cheap. She said she saw the last season of this and liked it and was interested in seeing the first season. So, being a dutiful (yet cheap) husband, I picked it up.

I honestly wasn't expecting to enjoy this but watched it anyway. The next thing I knew, we had watched the first three episodes and I was an hour past my regular bed time (I get up early in the morning for work). We were enjoying the show so much that we watched the fourth.

It seemed every show had a cliffhanger!

If it were a weekend night and I didn't have to go in to work the next day, I bet we'd have watched all night.

Jennifer Garner is the star of this show and holds her own but Ron Rifkin and Victor Garber are top-notch in this series and really elevate the show in my opinion.

Plus, I just loved the writing. The stories were intricate and creative. The pacing was darn near perfect as it mixed in action with the necessary exposition peppered with some humor (usually provided by Kevin Weisman (Marshall Flinkman as the socially awkward/technical genius - think 'Q' in James Bond - of this spy series).

It didn't take us long to finish the entire season. Of course, we bought Season 2, then Season 3, etc. We ended up burning through all five seasons in about as many months.

For my money, though, Season 1 was the best of the bunch.",1309996800,,1492,4.2140350877192985
1499124,4,B00005JLF1,"Mission Impossible, The Perils of Pauline, Million Dollar Woman and who knows how many other films and television productions, JJ Abrams has mastered, including the dramatic underplaying song, the quick cut, and, of course, the  heroine in innumerable, always revealing costumes. The result is a series in which one can immediately spot the film-tv historical sources for everything going on ( the last episode included in this first season makes sure to get in the famous scene with Dustin Hoffman and, was it Laurence Olivier, not a bad influence). Despite its being a pastiche of the past, Alias does have the verve, the
panache, to keep one watching in mindless thrall to each 45 minute episode. Quite helpful, I would say a vital element, is the soap opera component with its continuing saga of whether a little girl who lost her Mom can grow up to find love, happiness and fulfillment as an action hero. The stunts while repetitive are a credit to the people who plan and carry them out, the plot line of each episode, while repetitive, do sufficiently carry forward the soap opera to maintain ones interest. I'm not sufficiently versed in the art of acting to know who the performing stalwarts are upon whom the show is firmly founded but its a good bet is that Rifkin is one of them. Of course, without the heroine's ability to look good and handle the necessary tears, smiles, indignation and winsomeness, all else would collapse. She does what is asked of her sufficiently well that one easily forgives her anything that might be lacking in her dramatic non-superwoman moments.
All-in-all, this is a quite watchable escape from reality to be recommended to anyone who seeks a few minutes solace from the news columns",1305504000,,1726,4.850847457627118

The entire season was well written and well produced and the cast were all great.  This was Jennifer Garner's ""Star Vehicle"" and it certainly accomplished that for her.
If you liked the series, I would recommend that you spring for the complete series collector's boxed set.
Even through the writing got tougher with each season, they did a mostly good job keeping it all together for a five year run.
It's hard to be creative and interesting for that long even with new writers being brought in, but if you like the characters
and are willing to see the series through, you will be rewarded...even if the last ep was a little disappointing, it was an ending that made the most sense.",1271203200,2,795,4.520833333333333
1499231,4,B00005JLF1,"Alias --

I've only seen a few first season episodes but the stories really rock.  Kind of like a Mission Impossible/Girl from UNCLE mix-up, Sydney gets involved in a covert operation known as SD-6.  After they assassinate her boyfriend to keep their location and existence secret, she decides to become a double-agent and work for the CIA, to bring down SD-6 and then ""get the hell out"" of the spy business.

Except that SD-6 is quite an octopus with nuclear bomb sales to foreign lands and a ruthless director.  They don't yet suspect that Sydney (played admirably by Jennifer Gardner) is a double agent and give her all kinds of interesting assignments.

So far we have the usual socially-inept guy who gives the low-down on secret devices such as a sonic disrupter pen or a walkie-talkie necklace, brings back memories of Mission Impossible and the old James Bond movies.  She also has an evil agent competitor who seems to out-wit and be one step ahead of her at every turn.

As I understand it, Alias later morphed into a science fiction show which I'd like to see that transformation.

Meantime, season one looks pretty fresh and exciting.  The cliffhanger endings keep you wanting more and the staccato music brings back memories of Lalo Shafrin's Mission Impossible.

The downside is that Sydney's escape of some impossible situations seems a bit too pat to me. And when she does escape, how does she get back to the USA in record time?  Some plot holes such as this take away from the overall excitement of the show.

Recommended.

The ""Alias"" characters are well written and menacing, just as an intelligence agency should be.  JJ Abrams (Star Trek 2009) did an excellent job molding Sydney (Jennifer Garner) character into the perfect spy and a deadly adversary when needed but also a spy that considers ""collateral damage"" as well.  This is a more real scenario than the press often reports, because these people are also real people dealing with unique problems.  As a villain Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin) is cold as ice and twice as treacherous.  This is good TV as a matter of fact; this show elevated our normal spy show to a new level.  Characters you can relate to and real world problems taken right out of today's headlines.  The actors were great, the limited budget was used very well to compensate for the special effects used and JJ brought it all together for five seasons with Ms Garner's help of course.  The show would not have lasted that long if there wasn't something special going on.  Good stuff, I will watch the episodes over and over, still entertaining after the last curtain call.
I hope you enjoy it too!",1264291200,2,1281,5.333333333333333

As for Alias itself -- story follows Sydney Bristow and her trying to bring down an agency called SD6 after they *spoiler spoiler* kill her fiance *end spoiler end spoiler*

Some cons: They do leave each episode (about 95% of the time) as cliff hangers. Which as a series is understandable, if you want your viewer to come back next week. However, watching it on DVD once you start, you just can't stop! You just have to keep watching to find out what happens next!

1499410,3,B00005JLF1,"Firstly, I have never seen this show before.  I saw in on Amazon for under $20 and I need a show.  I need a show with enough action to keep my attention on the tredmill every night, and preferably enough of a female element to interest my wife, so we have a show to watch together.  Alias meets both criteria, but only just barely.

All my reviews are spoiler free, so I won't ruin the plot by giving it away, but seriously, 1/2 of all the episodes involve secret agent Sydney Bristow dressing up in a slinky outfit with a sexy hairdo to infiltrate a swanky party always being thrown in the same building as a secret base for her to break into and steal some item or artifact.  Apparently bad guys are quite fond of swanky parties and also can't get away from the ""office"" long enough to really enjoy them, so why not throw a party at the secret bad guy base?  Perfect!  Well maybe not.  Sure, I can appreciate Jennifer Garners mid driff and long sexy legs as much as the next guy, but after a while it feels like I'm watching a game of ""dress up"" when every other episode involves her dolling up in a new sexy dress.

Mixed in with the action are ""daddy issues"", ""mommy issues"", friend issues, romance, long discussions worthy of daytime drama and a good dose of crying and hand wringing over Sydneys life foibles.  Fortunatly, my wife enjoys those parts too, so it gives us something to enjoy together, Alias has become ""our show"".

There is too much violence and torture for my tastes.  Some things the bad guys (and some of the ""good guys"") do is just too graphic for the both of us.

We bought the whole series and will watch it all eventually, but the main plot line is starting to feel too much like ""Lost"", which is a show I despise.  ""Lost"" is a snipe hunt.  After watching ""Lost"" for years, it has become clear that there is no underlying plot, its just a bunch of crap the writer thinks up over coffee that day.  If you remember Lost, there was a point where the story starting going off from reality (People stranded on an island trying to survive) to fantasy (smoke monsters, dead people flash backs, mystical powers, etc).  The first half of Alias season one is quasi reality (a female secret agent) and 1/2 way through gets mystical (500 year old prophesies, machines created by an ancient mystic prophet named Rambaldi who keeps coming up for reasons that are, by the end of Season 1, not at all explained) and part of it starts to feel silly.

Overall the writing is passable.  There are a couple good scenes and a couple good plot twists.  In fact there are many plot twists, but most of them are blindingly obvious.  A lot of the time I can't tell if the writers are being serious or tounge-in-cheek as well.  One time they need to disarm some C4 plastic explosives.  It is ""hidden"" in a maintenance closet in big boxes with ""C4"" written all over it.  One character says, ""well I can tell its C4, because it has ""C4"" written all over it.""  Also, working in Network Admin (as I do) is a liability for enjoying some of the show, because I know that things don't work the way the writers think they do.  Wireless Modems don't steal data off hard disks just by putting them 4 inches away from a mainframe, for example...  Unfortunatly, there is quite a bit of this sillyness, but thats a common problem.

In the end, each episode got me interested enough to watch the next, so its certainly worth the under $20 price, but I have no doubt that the whole underlying ""Rambaldi"" plot will not pan out to my satisfaction...",1256256000,5,3533,4.3938461538461535

Watching the show on DVD is the way to go, as it allows you to slam back four to five episodes at a clip.

As you likely know by now, Jennifer Garner is Sydney Bristow, a college co-ed looking for some direction in life.  She is nothing short of amazed when she is recruited to a super-secret branch of the CIA.  Or is she ?  We quickly discover that Syd is actually working for the bad guys.  But in the best cloak and dagger tradition, she works her way deeper into the organization to make the world safer.  Working with the real CIA, she takes on missions for the evil SD6, keeping tabs on the bad guys and working in a concurrent ""counter mission"".

The cast of characters is top drawer.  Ron Rifkin plays the evil Arvin Sloane, while Carl Lumbly is the likeable and loyal Marcus Dixon.  One of the true standouts is Kevin Weisman, SD-6's resident gadget guru(think ""Q"" only quirkier).  This is the show that put creator JJ Abrams on the map, and rightfully so.  Garner's Bristow is engaging, sexy, and just darn fun to watch.  The show trots all over the globe engaging in plenty of spy vs. spy, but be forewarned !  Starting down this road will claim many, many hours of your free time.  Not that that is necessarily a bad thing.",1255478400,5,1462,4.379182156133829

1499547,1,B00005JLF1,"I address this review to the first three seasons of Alias. Season one is fantastic. The actors are fine and the story flows along and keeps ones attention. I am more interested in helping people avoid my mistake. I had seen a few episodes in the past and so bought the first three seasons. As I mentioned, the first season was excelent and well worth the price. Unfortunately, the script writers seemed to be in a perpetial loop. The same old things happen over and over, episode after episode. If you like seeing sociopath murders (the bad guys) escape about 999 times out of a 1000 - this is your cup of tea. If you enjoy seeing the ""good guys"" make one mistake after another, you'll love these. Two more issues. This tv series is set up and runs episode to episode like a soap opera. Every episode is intended to force the viewer to ""come back next time (week)."" The constant betrayals by most all the characters fits this soap opera scheme and is repitious. The other issue I had was that they tended to run about five minutes of past episodes every episode, and it was not necessarily from the last episode. I found this ridiculous and considered this a production move to shorten the script length and save money. So, I recommend season one and would encourage you to ignore all the rest!",1249776000,9,1294,4.487288135593221
1499548,4,B00005JLF1,"So, I believe that this is a re-issue of the original first season that must have been discontinued.  When I ordered this, I couldn't figure out why the price was so low.  The packaging is much smaller and simpler, with all discs inside of a case barely larger than a standard DVD case.  They are arranged in a similar fashion to some of the Full House DVD's, where the discs lay on top of each other, slightly overlapping.  I believe the first season of House does this as well.

So, if you don't really care about having extensive packaging such as the 24 box sets, you can't go wrong with this for the price.  The show is wonderful, and I'm glad that I'll be able to add them all to my collection at this price.

1499549,5,B00005JLF1,"I enjoyed the entire series of Alias, but the first season definitely was the best.
You really got to see all sides of Sydney's life and the dichotomy of her two existences really pull against each other creating an intense inward struggle. Once the series gets on a ways, her personal life and her work life kind of merge together and that see-saw balances out.
One of the great things about it is it just throws you in, no slow lead in. The moment you start the first episode, you're deep in it and hooked.
Jennifer Garner has such a girl next door look to her, that before I watched it, I couldn't imagine her in this role. But once I started watching it, I couldn't imagine anyone else in the role of Sydney.

1499552,5,B00005JLF1,"This show is SO good, it's not like any other ""agent/spy/CIA series"" you've seen before, it's a completely different plot, dramatic, funny, sad, exiting and realistic at the same time, and the acting's amazing.

I remember watching the very first episode back when it first came out, we were on vacation and my sister and I watched it together, I had just turned 9. I specifically remember the scene when Sydney is in a basement and is asked by that man, ""Who are you working for?"" while he gets ready to pull her teeth out. Then she mumbles desperately, and when he loosens his grip on that terrible torture instrument, she says flippantly, ""I just wanted to say ... Start with the teeth in the back - if you don't mind?"" (Fantastic scene!)

Unfortunately, not long after, the holidays were over and I couldn't watch it anymore - I had to go to bed (remember I was 9 years old?), it was on at 11 PM or so.
And so I almost completely forgot about the series, even though that specific scene has been so clear in my head all the years from the broadcast of that pilot and to this very day.

But then I actually bought the first season this year, and I watched it, and it's just fantastic! In my opinion it's the best tv series ever, the plot is brilliant, it's very exciting, and the acting is absolutely outstanding! Especially Jennifer Garner, she fits and plays perfectly in that part, no one else could have done it half as well as her.

That was a long story, but I wanted to share my memories of that series from when I was a little boy, and how I feel about it now.
Really great show.

1499554,5,B00005JLF1,"I knew of this series, . . .never got sucked into it when it was on TV but I'm a fan of rock em sock em chick kicking butt video games, and movies.  Big fan of the Buffy the Vampire series and anything deep thought provoking, but not to over my head flicks, books, and video games.  I've always like Jennifer Garner.  Unfortunately, the very first movie I ever saw her in was some really dorky 13 year old movie but I had the foresight to not hold it against her.  That movie was pretty darn bad but I could see that she was the type of actress that had potential and was enjoyable to watch on screen.  Next came Juno and Elecktra and I was really impressed with her performance there so I thought I wouldn't hold it against her that she married Ben Aflack.
So I bought the first season on Amazon, read that the director was the same director of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and pushed play.  This sucked me in at the pilot and I could see what all the buzz is about.  This series plays out like a live action, of course scaled down and edited version of Tomb Raider meets, Mission Impossible.  I would be hard pressed to say anything bad about this, . . so far, . . I have only seen the first season.  Understandibly this is Hollywood entertainment and thus has its limitations, . . will you be entertained, yes.  You'll be on the edge of your seat at times saying ""What the?!"" Now the quirky, . . .for some reason she is always running through a hallway, . .almost like clock work during every episode there is a hallway scene.  Also I do like the fact that her character is not so cold bold but she seems a little soft at times.  I would like to see her a little more tough like her nemisis Ana, . . because she has such a cute pretty face it would make for better character development.

1499710,5,B00005JLF1,"Most television series acknowledge the importance of the first season, a precursor to the however many running years a show has. ALIAS has not let its viewers down. JJ Abrams, most famous for his work on FELECITY, comes to us with a breathtaking reinvention of ther spy series.
Syndey Bristow, a strong-willed graduate student has two worlds: one of a regular student who spends her evenings home with her friends and fiancee, Danny. Another of an international spy for SD-6, a black-ops division of the CIA. But, when she decides to bring pieces of the worlds together, by telling her fiancee of her double life, SD-6 has him killed. In a brilliant pilot, Sydney's work life is revealed to be a sham, she is not working for a black-ops CIA division, but a syndicate of an international terrorist organization, the Alliance.
The first season follows Sydney and her pursuit to end the success and livelihood of the group that killed her fiancee and took seven years of her life, mainly SD-6 director, Arvin Sloane. With her father, another agent at SD-6 (Victor Garber), she becomes a double agent for the CIA, working with her handler, Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), to bring down the men that destroyed her life. Filled with interesting plots, ALIAS provides an incrediblely easy way to spend an hour entertained. With the constant mystery of how much of Sydney's life revolves around those she does not know, the character of Miss Bristow continues to fascinate viewers.",1217116800,,1474,4.923694779116466

1499804,4,B00005JLF1,"YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S ABOUT:
Sydney Bristow is a grad student living in LA and working part time at Credit Dauphine.  Ahh, but there's more - CD is actually a front for SD-6, a black-ops arm of the CIA, and Syd is one of their protgs, bravely conducting missions around the world.  Ahh, but it's not over yet - SD-6 really has no connection to the CIA.  In fact, SD-6 is actually one of a number of semi-autonomous departments of a large, clandestine and thoroughly criminal enterprise known as ""The Alliance"".  Syd learns this from her father shortly after finding her fiance murdered and herself marked for death in the first episode of this show.  Jack Bristow, a man with seemingly no connection to SD-6 prior to that moment, is himself a double-agent - working for the real CIA against SD-6 from the inside.  Soon Syd is following in the footsteps of her father, a man she hardly knows.  Put under the supervision of a CIA handler named Vaughn, Syd's workload doubles - carrying out CIA counter-missions during SD-6 operations.  As Season 1 progresses, we learn more of the hierarchy of The Alliance, of the conflicting loyalties of Sydney, and that of the other mercenary organizations with whom The Alliance periodically competes and wars against.

Though shadowy espionage highlights the action, the show tosses in some interesting and unexpected touches.  Early on, we find that SD-6 and its competitors have taken an interest in an obscure renaissance-era inventor named Rambaldi - a man whose notes seem to predict digital computing and cellphones centuries ahead of their time.  With subtle hints that suggest just how devastating all this cloakNdagger can get, ""Alias"" bridges the gap between espionage and sci-fi as the Bond movies had without going in the camp direction.

Never forgetting that Syd is the star of the show, the scripts also dwell on her homelife, on her roommate Francie and on the reporter Will Tippin.  Tippin's unrequited love for Sydney will draw him into investigating her fiancee's murder - a move which will bring him face to face with SD-6.

I SAT THROUGH EACH EPISODE DESPITE:
I Got into this show because of JJ Abrams, also the man behind ""Lost"", but ""Alias"" is the anti-""Lost"" in many ways.  Few of the characters manage to be credible and absorbing at the same time.  The stories practically grind to a halt when returning us to Syd's apartment - are everyday people that annoyingly boring?  Virtually all of the main characters are cyborgs, including Sydney (except when she has to have an emotional moment).  Many of the missions are repetitive - go somewhere, find something, clobber some baddies using Matrix-like choreography, show off some great costuming, use some near-magic gadgetry to get past secure spaces and get out.  So many critical items are stolen from offices secured by biometric devices that it's incredible that anybody still relied on them half-way through the first season.  The show gets undue mileage from unnecessary famous guest stars - Roger Moore as one of the Alliance bigwigs and Quentin Tarantino as a former SD-6 operative who turns traitor.

I IGNORED THE FLAWS BECAUSE:
Despite the show's repeated cheats, ""Alias"" is still loads of fun.  The actors bond in ways that their characters' bios wouldn't suggest.  The scripts intriguingly weave the show's many subplots through each episode - Tippen will have to face SD-6, but how will it look from the outside?  Syd's best friend in SD-6 is co-Agent Dixon, a really noble guy but still a loyal SD-6 agent - will Syd have to kill him when he begins to uncover clues to her identity as a double-agent?  And just where is all this Rambaldi stuff going anyway?

At its worst, ""Alias"" is breezy and unmemorable, but more often that that, it's absorbing fun.",1192320000,2,3776,4.879310344827586

1499807,1,B00005JLF1,"Don't start watching this show.  Trust me.  I'm saving you a large portion of your life that you won't ever get back.  Don't get me wrong.  Season one is actually a lot of fun.  It moves at a good pace and introduces an overall plot line and mythology that is quite intriguing.  The following 4 seasons, however, don't deliver.  In fact, quite the opposite, they fall maddeningly short.  It's clear that JJ Abrams et al had absolutely no idea where the show should end up.  The writers apparantly made things up as they went along, painted themselves into about a thousand corners, and were not smart enough to get themsevles out.

A few random thoughts on this series and it's creator:
--> Milo Rambaldi, his artifacts, his ""end game"", and where the Bristows really fit in will never be satisfactorily explained.  Don't expect this, the show's most interesting sub-plot to amount to anything.
--> I hope you perfer shallow pretty-boy male-archetypes like Vaughn more than substantial, real characters like Will.  The breif Vaughn reprieve in season 3 where Weiss took more of a leading role in Sydney's life was welcome but all too short.
--> The situations Sydney finds her self in start out ludicrous (but well within the limits of a suspension of disbelief) and only get worse (well beyond said suspension).  By season 5 I was yelling at the TV desperately hoping my pleas might change the unchangable.
--> Nobody talks the way these people do...and it's annoying.
--> If this show were a soap opera (which it pretty much is) it would rival Passions for ridiculousness.  However, the writers of Passions seem to realize that their product is stupid.  I get the feeling that the Alias writers think their doing seriously good work.
--> It's pretty clear JJ Abrams has nothing to do with LOST anymore...evidenced by the fact that LOST is still good.
--> A pregnant field agent Sydney Bristow made me phyisically want to hurt someone, which leads me to my last point...
--> I'd really like to punch JJ Abrams.  I think I might get off easy.  It would take 100+ episodes of Alias entered as evidence, but I think I could get the judge to see that the battery was warranted.",1182384000,15,2173,4.7063492063492065

The first season of Alias is almost too good, and I would definitely say that DVD is the way to watch it. Each episode is action packed and fast paced so that once you start watching it's really hard to make yourself stop. In fact, going to work is just about the only thing that made me turn off the television at night. Get the first season of Alias when you have a long weekend available, because you won't want to step away for even a minute.",1181347200,4,677,4.022222222222222

The show about the beautiful undercover agent Sidney Bristow will be appreciated by both fans of action (because of the great special effects) drama (it packs an emotional wallop) and suspense (the cliffhangers will keep you watching this 6-DVD set hours past your bedtime).

The story revolves around the young secret agent who works for a covert branch of the CIA called SD-6 and is about to have her world turned upside down when she finds out secrets about the people she works for, her past and her estranged father. One of the main reasons this show works flawlessly is its actors. Jennifer Garner is unbelievably convincing and good in the role of Sidney, Victor Garber (a Broadway Tony nominee) plays her father most credibly and there is even an episode dedicated to Mr. Quentin Tarantino! All in all, a great show with amazing plot twists, cliff-hangers and all your usual and unusual spy stuff!",1166832000,2,969,4.767857142857143
1499951,4,B00005JLF1,"I didn't get interested in Alias until after they started coming out on DVD.  It provided some entertaining episodes and I especially liked Victor Garber as Jack Bristow.  I guess the premise that Sidney is recruited out of college appeals to the younger crowd, but it seemed a little silly for the CIA/SD-6 to approach her and offer her a job.  I think I would have been pretty surprised if it happened to me and would have wondered what I had done (good or bad) and what skills I possessed that could have attracted the notice of a government spy agency.

While the series is pretty entertaining and I have followed it up to the end of season 4, it still cannot hold a candle to a show that is now off the air, but available on DVD.  Go check out La Femme Nikita.  Nikita, played by Peta Wilson, is a much more believable covert operative.  And she has no need to use bad wigs or trashy, revealing clothes to do her job.  (Yes I'm talking about the blue latex mini dress Sidney wore on a job and those hideous Rainbow Brite wigs).  The music, characters, plot, sets, and character interactions are just plain better and more believable on La Femme Nikita.  It's based off of the French movie of the same title and loosely based on Bridget Fonda's Point of No Return.

Even though the series is long over, it still stays current because everything they used back in the late '90's was ultra high tech.  So the show doesn't look dated.  It's got a different feel from Alias, and the storylines are more believable.  And there's a great love story plot in there, for all of you who like the Sidney/Michael story it's nothing compared to the Nikita/Michael tension.  Check it out.  It's developed cult staus and all the seasons are available on DVD.",1157932800,5,1747,4.481012658227848

Alias is about a spy who tells her fiance, Danny, about what she really does. Danny is murdered by SD-6, the branch of the CIA Sydney Bristow works for. She soon discovers that SD-6 is not apart of the CIA. She teams up with the real CIA to destroy SD-6 from the inside, as Syd is now a double agent. Soon, Arvin Sloane, the head of SD-6 discovers secrets about Milo Rambaldi, an ancient prophet. Rambaldi has many artifacts of great power. Sloane becomes obsessed with Rambaldi and his secret works. Rambaldi is surrounded in mystery. Sydney and Dixon go on many missions to discover more about Rambaldi. But, Rambaldi is not the only thing in this season. SD-6 sells weapons to terroist groups. So, the main theme of Alias is to hand the weapons to the CIA instead of the villians. But, the Rambaldi storyline is always in the background of the series. Alias is filled with double crosses, cliffhangers, outrageous outfits and exotic locales.

1499953,4,B00005JLF1,"I'm becomming a fan of the type of show that is a long-running storyline.  Shows like Taken, The 4400, Lost, and my new favorite, 24.  It is hard to pick up these types of shows during their runs (like you could with Friends or Seinfield) but, thank goodness for DVD show releases, I could start this series from the beginning.  So, if you like those shows then you'll probably like this one.  It is a wattered-down version of 24 though it is slowly becomming more like Lost with a certain sci-fi twist they've thrown in there.

Jennifer Garner plays Sydney Bristow, a field unit in SD-6, an offshoot of the CIA.  She is told to tell nobody about SD-6 but when she tells her fiance, he is killed and she learns many truths.

Such as the fact that SD-6 is not part of the CIA, but part of ""The Alliance"", the agency she thought she was trying to destroy.  Also, that her Father, who she thought sold airplane parts, is also part of SD-6 and knows that it doesn't operate out of Langley.

So Sydney goes to the CIA and becomes a double agent.  Many other plot twists come throughout the episodes as everybody in her life seems to be affected by her decisions.  I just finished the first season and there seems to be a lot of questions that need to be answered.  I'll most definately be headed out to pick up the second season to see where things are taken.

The amazing thing about Sydney is that she must lead three lives, which often do not coincide with each other.  First is the life of working for SD-6, who she can't tell anybody (not even family) about.  Then there is her work with the CIA which, again, family and friends can't know about and especially her friends at SD-6.  She is also a college student and everybody from that life (roommates and friends) assumes she works at a bank.  Keeping these three things in order can get pretty entertaining at times.

But I'm not completely sold on this yet.  I'm just running out of options to follow, unfortunately.  This starts off with the double-agent story which I thought was interesting.  But mid-way through the plot thickens as they pick up the trail of a 15th century inventory/architect that turns out to be a prophet prophesying events to happen during this time (think of him as a cross between DaVinci and Nostredomas).  And Sydney appears to be a great deal of that prophecy.  So the storyline has turned a bit Fantasy/Sci-Fi-ish.  While I generally like those types of stories, it isn't exactly what I was looking for in this story line.  So I'll give it another season and see if I want to continue on to the end from there (watching 5 seasons is a LOT of time commitment).

But I'd say that if you like what you've heard so far then go out and pick this up.  I'm just hoping this review better prepares you for what you are really getting yourelf in to.",1153612800,3,2825,4.424418604651163

The full season set enables you to enjoy episode after episode without having to wait for the next weeks viewing on TV.  Alias grabs your attention from the start of the show, and will have you drawn into the world of Sydney Bristow for the entire season.  This show has superb acting, and has a little bit of everything: action, romance, and cliffhangers.  You will not be dissapointed, so give it a try.  I guarantee you will be running to order season two after you finish the first.",1152144000,,595,4.673076923076923

Alias is a show with various aspects to attract many different kinds of people with themes such as betrayal, romance, good vs. evil, friendship, and much more.  Ultimately it will offer up something to attract almost anyone.

The directing of the show is well done, the acting is good, and the writing is unmatched by almost any other show (with the writers giving the audience credit for being smart enough to follow along; thereby, allowing more complex ideas to develop throughout the show).

I would highly recommend Alias, with the only fault being in that it is addicting and almost impossible to walk away.",1151971200,,850,4.716216216216216

You know that feeling you get when you're watching a movie in the theater, and something really exciting happens, and you want to rewind to see what you might have just missed?  That's how this show is!  CONSTANTLY!!!  Especially during the ""undercover"" sequences.

I like the African American actor, but it gets weird seeing Jennifer and him together always.  Even in 24, Jack is with different folks all the time.  But that would be the only complaint.

I recommend this to everyone on your friend's list.

It feels like one big story when you watch them all together.  Pretty genius work by J.J. Abrams.  And I think Jennifer Garner is adorable as Sydney Bristow, so...that definitely helps.

This is a note to fans and people considering buying the season dvd's. Now that the alias series is over...I know that there  will be alot of people wanting to own it ... and thats fantastic!, but I recently heard that there will be a Complete Series Box Set released sometime in December. This will include.. The Complete Seasons one through Five and will contain according to those releasing it loads of extra content that is not included on the individual seasons that are currently being sold.

1500060,5,B00005JLF1,"Why such a cautionary title if it's 5 stars? Because this'll hook its teeth in you except instead of resisting you'll like it so maybe it's like your loved one play-biting? I don't know but this is quite an addicting series. Sharp-writing, intriguing plots are what await you and just like shows like Lost or 24, they're extremely big guilty pleasures where you come back week after week and what's nice about DVD is you can see it on your time without stupid sports pre-empts(I'm looking at you Fox).

Sydney Bristow is a graduate student who wants to be a teacher and she has normal friends: Will, a reporter and Francine, a caterer. She has a normal career too but that's what she wants them to think: she's actually an agent working for SD-6, a cover branch of the CIA. Turns out that's not the case as SD-6 is actually the bad guys so she decides one thing: bring them down by being a double agent cooperating with the real CIA. But how does one conduct top secret business under the very nose of powerful government officials? That's the fun of it.

In fact, the show is quite fun. Like 24, the show deals with espionage and classified stuff but unlike 24, Alias has gadgetry and gismos that Jack Bauer would probably break in 5 seconds beating a guy with. The show has an ultra-cool look to it and the show knows it and shows every opportunity it can while 24 is a bit more gritty and realistic(despite the show's 24 hour premise). Both are still well-written shows and they become quick guilty pleasures. In many ways one of the show's flaws is actually positive if you consider your viewing schedule. Alias is so layered in its writing that missing one episode you'd literally be lost so DVD helps, but then again it'll probably make you watch all the episodes in big marathons if you don't have much of a social life(like me).

One problem that I always personally had a problem with dealing with spy shows such as this is the amount of information mentioned. Characters, minor and major, are mentioned often and at one point you're like ""wait, that was....oh that was that guy, right"". It's a bit too layered but that's alright since most of it isn't all that important and the ones that are get center stage. The characters are quite well cast and no problems with any of them. There's even such guest spots such as Roger Moore(who of course played another famous spy), Amy Irving, even Quentin Tarantino of all people. Also Saw fans will recognize Tobin Bell a.k.a Jigsaw.

What'll probably become the bane of your existence in regards to this series is the idea of the cliffhanger. It of course refers to leaving a big shocking moment right when the show ends and Alias is chockful of them. Even non 2-parters get ""to be continued"" like endings and the show ends with a big one although a disadvantage of getting into a show late is that other people blab it, assuming you've watched it already. Some are too busy so when the finale's big shock comes in, I already heard it but it was still cool, just not ""holy crap!"".

If you're looking for a guilty pleasure show it's easy to recommend Alias. If you're easily sucked into this kind of stuff stay away from Alias because I'm willing to bet if you're into Alias by the time Disc 1 ends, you should already be considering Season 2.",1146787200,2,3295,4.521812080536913
1500061,4,B00005JLF1,"This plot seems completely unbelievable.  Yet, every week I find myself drawn to this show.  For all the impossible plot lines and unbelievable characters, ALIAS is just a great show for mindless escapism and entertainment.  If you can suspend disbelief, you might find that this show is for you.  Just a short survey of some of the unlikely characters in this show:

Jack Bristow was married to a Russian spy who used him for an information source in the CIA.  He spent a year in jail under suspicion for being a spy himself.  Yet, Jack is a trusted double agent? He works with his daughter at the CIA and SD6?  Give me a break.

Sydney Bristow is the lead in the series.  She is a college student turned secret agent.  Despite looking like head stuck on a stick figure, she is somehow able to perform almost superhuman feats of strength, athleticism, and agility.  Likewise, she is a super smart, hyper aware double agent, who never gets caught despite the fact that she wears her heart on her sleeve and is willing to break any protocol for a friend or relative.

Marshal Flinkman (sp) is the tech-guy who works at SD6 and later at the CIA. He is, to this reviewer anyway, the most believable character on the show.  Despite being used primarily for comic relief and creating from scratch impossible devices, he is the only person who carries the quite confidence and energy that I would expect a real intelligence expert to have.

This review could go on and on just talking about all the weird, interesting, and unlikely characters.  Sydney's mother, the evil head of SD-6, Michael Vaughn, Sydney's partner at SD-6, and more - including the cool bald guy from LOST and JAG.  However, rest assured, it is entertaining.

Finally, while the show itself is a bizarre labyrinth of betrayal, plot twists, and surprise endings; it is just fun to watch.  If you are looking for some mindless entertainment, you can't go wrong with Alias.",1146009600,,1934,4.685459940652819
1500062,5,B00005JLF1,"I would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys well written,well acted,action/spy dramas.  The cast is amazing.

I remember the very first episode was run without commercial interuption, a very rare thing for network television, and I for one was HOOKED instantly.  It is just such a fun concept to begin with, a college girl by day/international spy by night!

If you have never seen this show, do yourself a favor a BUY it now, don't borrow it, don't rent it, BUY it, because you'll want to watch it again and again in the future, I'd bet on it.

I let friends borrow mine and they told me later that they couldn't stop watching it, they actually watched the entire season in one weekend.

1500063,5,B00005JLF1,I have all 4 seasons of Alias. The first two are what made this show great. Season 3 is good but season 4 is a complete mess. I just can't bring myself to waste time watching season 4. Season 1 & 2 really show the best in television. Get them both together.,1143072000,,257,3.9615384615384617
1500064,5,B00005JLF1,"I'm a huge fan of the 24 series, but for both 24 and Alias I had the same problem - there's no way I could schedule my life around weekly episodes. So I deliberately abstained from watching the series while it was on, and then got the DVD set out afterwards. Not only does this make it easier to watch them properly, but it also means you can have marathon watching episodes. Instead of wasting time with commercials and waiting a week, you can zip through a whole batch of them at once.

I love female lead characters, I love James Bond style action and I love quick-paced, intelligent plot. Alias provides a lot of that. I also love medieval / renaissance style mystery tie-ins and that of course is in here as well. Sydney is a college student and in short order both she and her father are double agents. They really work for the CIA, but they're infiltrating the evil SD-6. Sydney's fiance is slain because of her indiscretion. She has a romance building with her CIA handler. Who can she trust? Who's on her side?

I also love the way they make it ""appear"" to be all over the world. I wish of course that they had a budget to actually go places - I would much rather see a scene in Honk Kong vs what LA thinks Hong Kong looks like. They can only do what they can do, of course. I like how she dresses up and down, blue hair and red hair, showing that all sorts of shapes and styles can look nice.

So, on to the issues. First, I'll comment that they aren't huge issues. I avidly watched the whole series through and enjoyed it. Still, there were definitely issues that were jarring during the process.

First, I realize Sydney is supposed to be a ""young adult"" and even though she's a genius mentally, the isn't fully emotionally mature. Still, some of the things she does for plot related reasons are completely inane. She's a trained spy but she *conveniently* forgets protocol and rationale when the plot needs it to happen. She's an incredibly skilled fighter who can shoot, kick box, kung fu and pick up any random weapon with incredible skill - but when the plot requires it, a cheezy security guard can take her out. Surely the plot could have a *reasonable* reason for these things to happen.

I really enjoyed Sydney's African-American best friend and the ups and downs that go through that storyline. On the other hand, Sydney's male reporter friend drove me insane a lot of the time. I realize reporters need to be investigative. They need to be diligent and dogged. This guy's rapid-fire method of harassing people wouldn't have gotten him many stories! That being said, I do think he changed a lot, for the better, as the series progressed.

Something that really struck me as odd is that Sydney often goes into missions for SD-6 - with SD-6 monitoring her every move - but she's actively, VERBALLY talking via a hidden mike to her CIA contact the entire time. Even if the signal was scrambled, SD-6 would detect it. But they wouldn't have to! All the SD-6 watchers would take one look at her face and know exactly what she was saying, just by reading her lips.

I don't want to give away the storyline, of course. It's a soap opera of twists and turns, of characters disappearing and reappearing. It's a great watch-through and great to keep to replay and watch the subtle movements and clues. There are a ton of non-verbal signals being given here that you only pick up on the second or third watching.

I do want to warn on the DVD that there is a super-cool commentary with the entire cast of the final episode - and it is really funny - but it gives a TON of spoilers!! Surely the actors could have done their commentary without mentioning things from season 2 or 3. If you are watching this for the first time, I really recommend NOT watching that commentary and waiting until you're done with season 3 to go back and watch it. Otherwise some things will be ruined for you.

Well recommended.",1142467200,2,3917,4.467132867132867
1500065,5,B00005JLF1,"I was saddened to hear that this season of Alias(Season 5)will be the last but fortunately we can still watch the first 4 seasons on DVD whenever we want. In my opinion though season 1 is still the best. It takes place before Sydney's mom enters the picture and before her best friend gets cloned and before 2 mysterious missing years...not to say that Alias Season 1 is exactly simple. Unlike all of those DEAD BODY OF THE WEEK shows you can't just pop in any episode and know what's going on. Each episode builds on what happened in previous episodes springing sevral twists as the season goes along. Yes Jennifer Garner is sexy and looks great kicking butt but she also proves herself a great actress as well. Her joy,pain,loneliness and anger comes through vividly in every episode which is what keeps us engaged no matter how tricky the plotlines get. With terrific music selection,stylish action,a great supporting cast from the lovable babbling Marshall to the manipulative Sloan to the writer's ability to not reveal enough information so you have to keep watching to get answers Alias simply put was one of the most exciting satisfying T.V. shows ever made.",1141948800,3,1166,4.8059701492537314

1500068,5,B00005JLF1,I started watching the show regularly during the 3rd season.  By then the show was more inconsistent but it still was good enough for me to go back and watch past seasons.  The 1st season is the best by far.  There is a sense of fun even among the tragedy that Syndey faces.  The character of Will worked better when he was an outsider on the verge of finding out the truth.  Too bad they couldn't sustain that intensity and Will was forced out of the show.  Anyway there aren't many shows like Alias now so the dvd set will keep you entertained.,1137628800,2,546,4.252427184466019
1500192,5,B00005JLF1,"Back in 2001 when ALIAS first premiered, I remember watching the pilot episode on ABC on a Sunday night.  It was incredibly entertaining, and I was greatly intrigued.  It was so different from anything that had been shown on TV at the time.  ABC had went on a publicity craze with the show, running 30 second clips for months in advance; not to mention ALIAS was essentially the first TV show to act as a marketing device (notice the constant presence of the Nokia phones, and in Season Two the love affair with the Ford Focus).  Anyway, I'm always looking for one show that I can make plans to watch, something that can be ""my show.""  At the time, I had decided that ALIAS would receive this notable honor.  But, as is always the case, by the next week I was busy and I'd already forgotten.  Long story short, earlier this year when ALIAS entered syndication, I caught a 1 AM episode and remembered why I'd been so excited about the show to begin with.  So, I went out and bought ALIAS Season One.  Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed.

The first season of ALIAS is truly phenomenal.  It's a master at employing those wonderful, old-school cliffhanger endings.  I'll avoid repeating the basic story arc, as you can read that in any of the other reviews.  Just let me join the rest of the Amazon review crew in saying that this really is one of the best shows on television.  It's smart, suspenseful, and sleek.  How addicted did I become to this show?  Buy the end of Season One, I was practically going through withdrawals.  For Christmas I picked up Seasons 2, 3 and 4.  Right now I'm on Episode 18 of Season Two.  I must admit, it's not quite as good as the original season.  The first half was absolutely dismal.  But, somewhere around Episode 10, it reverts to the old Season One edge-of-your-seat style.  Yet unfortunately, ALIAS (after having its old time slot rearranged) has recently been canceled after five seasons.  The only good thing is that ABC will allow the show to finish out its five year, 110 episode career as opposed to just blindly yanking it from the winter lineup.  It's a classy move considering ALIAS really was the first series to put ABC back on the map in an era pre Desperate Housewives/Lost/Grey's Anatomy/Commander in Chief, when NBC and Friends ruled the airwaves (and my how the times change).  Bottom line:  ALIAS Season One is a great buy and if you do become addicted like the rest of us, at least you'll know you won't be getting caught up in a show that never got to complete itself.  And here's a BIG tip if you're like myself and are new to the ALIAS franchise and will be watching it play out on DVD:  don't read or watch anything even remotely related to ALIAS.  It's a show that over the years has been chop-full of surprises and twists.  Don't ruin the experience -- I can't tell you how many times ABC promos and Entertainment Weekly spoilers have provided me with way too much information!",1137369600,2,2941,4.515151515151516

She proves that you can be sexy, have fun, be in love, have babies and still be who you are and kick butt.

1500195,4,B00005JLF1,"Although it might not possess the real hard edge of shows like 24, Alias is a well designed espionage show with enough suspense, plot twists and interesting characters to keep you coming back for more. While some may be turned off by a female lead character (Sydney Bristow) or sometimes unbelievable plot lines, this show is just too good to ignore. Anyone that really gives this show a fair chance will be impressed. The plot features different parts of the world each week and involves a number of rival groups in the intelligence community. At times the shifting alliances, betrayals and sheer number of players may become a bit overwhelming, but ultimately it adds to the fun. The lead character is Sydney Bristow, a quick kicking college grad student who spends most of her time working as a double agent unbeknownst to her civilian friends. Sydney's character is a determined and very competent agent who has enough toughness to take a punch or to work through an emotional crisis. Other major players include her father and fellow agent Jack Bristow who is lacking in parental skills, but is a master of an intimidation and one of Sydney's main safety measures when things go awry. Her handler Michael Vaughn is a clean cut young company man for the CIA who is highly competent despite sometimes letting his crush of Sydney interfere with his work. On the flip side, you have Arvin Sloan, a man who can change alliances as often as the weather. He makes for a fun villan, but he is only one of many in this well-produced first season which includes an Asian gentleman who likes to torture his victims by doing a little dental work.

Other notable characters are civilian reporter Will Tippin who is almost willing to pursue any good news story regardless of the consequences. Sydney's partner at SD-6 (a rival agency of the CIA)Dixon who is as competent a spy as can be found, but who unfortunately doesn't realize he's been duped into working for the wrong team so to speak. There are plenty of other interesting characters such as Mr. Saark, Noah Hicks, etc....so the show never seems to become tiresome. Keep an eye out for a cameo role for former James Bond frontman Roger Moore.

The show has an overall flow to it with a story line that holds together across all the episodes.  The story is far fetched but still very good and keeps you hanging on to see how it unfolds.

The characters are well developed and have some great depth to them.  The writing is solid, and acting is outstanding in my view.

There's some action in each episode which keeps it high energy, but the story line is much deeper than a typical ""excuse to blow stuff up"" movie might be.",1129334400,4,638,4.231404958677686
1500198,5,B00005JLF1,"There are so many TV sources these days-- 6 broadcast networks, countless cable nets-- that it is quite impossible to keep up on all the good shows.  Add to that the growing phenomenon of both comedies and dramas being presented in serial form (as opposed to the days when each episode stood alone), and it becomes increasingly impossible to pick up shows in the middle.

Thankfully, the availability of full seasons on DVD provides a second way to consume this content.  Alias is a show best watched in voracious gulps, and if you've never seen it, this first season DVD release will provide you an onramp to one of the most innovative and well-done shows in recent years.

The plot, or rather premise, goes like this (I'm spoiling episode 1 but you'll live): Sydney Bristow is a grad student about to get engaged, her mom is dead, she's estranged from her father, and oh yeah, she works as a CIA agent.  We learn in the series premiere that what she thinks is the CIA is actually an enemy cell, and she has been duped all along; and, her father also works for that enemy cell.  Sydney decides to ""walk in"" to the CIA, and becomes a double agent.  Soon we learn that her dad is also a double agent.  (There are still some exciting plot details in episode 1 I'm leaving out.)

Each week, Sydney undertakes a mission for the bad guys, and receives a counter-mission from her CIA handler, usually along the lines of, give the bad guys fake info and pass the real info to us.

But the premise leaves out so much of the appeal.  First off, the writing is intelligent and outstanding, and that generally makes a great TV show.  Second, Jennifer Garner is gorgeous, sexy, alluring, the girl next door, your best friend, and one hell of a kick boxer all rolled up into one.  And the suspense is remarkable-- each episode unfolds at breakneck pace, adding to the cumulative plot while presenting you with immediate action, intrigue and jeopardy.  And almost every one ends with an irresistible cliff hanger.  (This makes the DVD an especially enjoyable viewing experience; you can blow through several of these at once, rather than having to wait a week.)

I'd sound byte the show like this: Thirtysomething meets 24.

And if that wasn't enough, there is a running and complex plotline that resembles the Da Vinci Code, involving a fictitious historical figure Rimbaldi who resembles Da Vinci in scope of accomplishment, and who's inventions are sought by all parties, good and evil.

Of particular note is the season one 2-parter featuring Quentin Tarrentino. Spectacular television.  (Oh, and watching without commercials... priceless.)

I've refrained from tipping you to any of the future plot direction.  You'll love the discovery.  And there's no rush to catch up, either; the show is in season 5 now.",1128643200,5,2799,4.751552795031056

1500300,5,B00005JLF1,Alias is one of my Favorite shows because of all the spying she does and espionage that goes around it makes you think does that really happen when I'm in school. The show is about a young woman who decided to enter the CIA when one of them ask her to. For years she does it until she's about to get marry and she tell's her fiance once the CIA or fake CIA fines out they have him kill. Once this happens everything changes sydney fines out that she's been working on the wrong side all along and now wants to take them down. The rest of the show is great and the dvd has enough stuff to get buy so don't sit here and order it already.,1123027200,,635,3.96875

It reminds me a bit of Dark Angel and The X-Files, but the elements it has in common with those shows are handled in a much drier, less engaging way. And am I the only one who thinks Jennifer Garner was terribly miscast? She CANNOT play ""tough chick"". She's much more suited to comedy.",1122508800,4,349,4.303030303030303

1500303,5,B00005JLF1,"Alias is a good TV show. The show starts out with Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner), engaged to a man named Danny. She tells him that she works for the ""CIA"" black ops division cell (SD-G) and he is killed by her boss. She then finds out that who she works for is a group called the alliance. She then goes to the CIA and becomes a double agent, and discovers that her father is a double agent to, working for SD-6  and the CIA. Her friend Will then begins to investigate Dannys death and gets into some big trouble, while Sydney and her dad try to take down the alliance.

The actors in the show are very good. Ron Rifkin, Carl Lumby, and Victor Garber are the older of the bunch and are the best actors on the show.

Guest Stars include Quentin Tarintino, Roger Moore and David Anders.",1121385600,,786,4.261744966442953
1500304,5,B00005JLF1,"I have to be honest...when I first saw this show being advertised way back in late 2001, I thought it was just another one of those ""kick-butt, girl power, girls are just as strong as boys"" shows and  just wrote it off.  But then, after recently getting into 24 and becoming oh so addicted, I went online and decided to see  what reviews were given for Alias. I never knew the show was emmy nominated so I thought I'd give it a chance and checked out volume 1 at Blockbuster and was pleasantly surprised.

  The acting is really good, the action ain't bad, and the plots are really gripping.  I'd have to say this show is pretty much a cross between James Bond and the O.C.  You got all the fancy gadgets, action, and sex appeal of the James Bond movies along with the drama of the O.C. with Sydney and her friends/family.  Even though the action can sometimes seem a little off, I still think it's a really cool show and, in my opinion, is suitable for the entire family.  I don't wanna compare this to 24 like many have, so I'll just say: give it a chance before you dismiss it like I did. Trust me, you'll be glad you did. The first few episodes have a little too much drama with the friends and family, but then the suspense really picks up later on, so don't give up after just a few episodes.  Oh, and it's also worth the fifty bucks. You can watch it again years later when it's faded from your memory andthe cable/sattelite goes out. Also, if you like this show, you'll definitely like 24, so I would recommend picking that up too.",1121126400,,1539,4.290657439446367
1500305,5,B00005JLF1,"In 2001, two new spy dramas went head-to-head during the new television season.  The Fox network had their real-time powerhouse ""24"", and ABC premiered the female driven spy drama ""Alias"".  Reviews for both shows were spectacular, ""24"" took off with audiences immediately, ""Alias"" built up more of a cult following that continued to grow each week.  Even though ""Alias"" wasn't pulling down the numbers that ""24"" was in the ratings, it was strong enough for ABC to know that they had a hit on their hands.

""Alias"" focuses on a young, sexy female spy named Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) who was essentially drafted into the spy world during college.  Sydney believes she is working for a special black-ops branch of the CIA, known as SD-6.  What Sydney doesn't know is that her and everyone she works with really are working for the very people they thought they were fighting, and that the head of SD-6, Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin) is a former member of the CIA who became a traitor to his country and now focuses on assembling a device that was designed by an inventor named Milo Rambaldi several centuries prior to now.  Sydney soon becomes a double-agent working for the CIA and attempting to bring down SD-6 with the help of her double-agent father, Jack (Victor Garber) and CIA agent Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan).

""Alias"" is one of those shows that missing one week can sometimes lead to total confusion when watching the next week's episode, which is what makes Tivo or these DVD season box sets so awesome.  Full of twists and turns that will keep your head spinning, ""Alias"" is an entertaining thrill ride that never lets up from the opening sequence of the first episode until the cliffhanger for the season finale.  Series creator J.J. Abrams has assembled a superb team of writers and directors to brilliantly craft this series into the spy thriller masterpiece that it is today.  With an incredibly talented cast, led by Jennifer Garner, and stories that go from the very real world to somewhat sci-fi, this is not a series to be missed.

""Alias"" is a highly recommended series for fans of the spy genre or just great drama in general.",1120608000,2,2152,4.77088948787062

A friend recommended this series to me - and I took a chance and went out and bought the first season.  Every single penny I spent on this series ended up being well worth it!  I cannot even explain how riveted I am by these characters and the predicaments each finds himself/herself in.  All it took was the first 10 minutes of the pilot to know I was simply going to love this series.  I probably could have watched all 22 episodes in the span of 2 days - but I tried to go super slowly as I am still waiting for Season 2 to arrive via mail.

This show has now become my guilty addiction - and we all need one - and I guarantee you that Alias will satisfy any desire for gripping, edge-of-your-seat, top quality television.",1118188800,4,886,4.034285714285715

1500309,5,B00005JLF1,"I'll have to admit I'm not much of a person for TV shows. I rarely have time to watch them, so whoever invented these things? Kudos to them seriously! Now then, back to this DVD set.

Alias was introduced to me by a friend who insisted I watch it and gave me season one without even let me protest. So the busy canine that I was at the time, I decided to plop in the first DVD with the first episode of the series...little expecting how I would feel about it afterward.

One word describes the feeling I had....INCREDIBLE! SO much was put into the making of this series that I just couldn't stop watching it. The episode ended, but I was not satisfied...AT ALL. I had to continually watch each episode in sequence just to keep myself sane from so many drop offs in each story line.

Not to give away too much, Sydney Bristow finds herself in a predicament of being involved with SD-6, a supposed ""branch"" of the CIA. This, she finds out, is false in that this branch is part of an agency used to work in governmental overthrow and basically overtaking everything involving it. Once Sydney finds this out, she becomes a double-agent for SD-6 and the REAL CIA to help bring down the agency.

So much could be described here, but for the sake of space and time, this is definitely a series (starting with season one of course ;-)) worth watching! You will love it!",1116201600,,1361,4.388888888888889

Sydney Bristow is one the first characters in a spy series that seems almost real. Her whole life is not just spy stuff. She has to deal with regular problems that everybody has to deal with but with a few twists. Whether it be the death of a loved one, a silent romance, or getting to know her estranged father, the writers give you a good look at the complex character of Sydney Bristow.

The 1st season was a good start showing Sydney ( the lovely Jennifer Garner) adapting to the spy life and figuring out what was all a lie. The set is great but I warn you after watching this show you will want to get the 2nd season immediatly.

This show has cliffhangers almost every episode.

However there aren't a whole lot of special features and the box designs change so much every season.  Wheres the continuity!?

1500452,5,B00005JLF1,"Premiering in September 2001, Alias has built a steady and loyal following among television viewers.  The show combines the fast pace action sequences of 24 with the conspiracy theory backdrop of the X-Files.  It also doesn't hurt that the show centers itself around a character that's a beautiful and mysterious woman.  But the true strength of Alias, as with most successful TV shows, is its unique and creative writers who manage to always keep their audience on edge...

Jennifer Garner (star of 13 Going On Thirty) plays the role of Sydney Anne Bristow, a beautiful, intelligent American woman recruited to work for the government's super secret SD-6 agency.  However, problems arise when her fianc is murdered by the agency she works for, and she ultimately discovers that SD-6 is not a legitimate government organization at all...  In seek of revenge, Sydney contacts the CIA, and they deploy her as a double agent.  Meanwhile, Sydney's estranged father, Jack (Victor Garber), also works as a double agent, and their relationship blossoms as a result of their work.  Together, they manage to eliminate SD-6, and now both work full-time for the CIA where they're accompanied by fellow colleagues Marshall Flinkman (Kevin Weisman), Marcus Dixon (Carl Lumbly), and Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan)...

1500453,5,B00005JLF1,"I have to admit that when I first saw the previews on ABC, I wasn't quite convinced, despite being a big fan of the spy genre. But the first time I saw it, I was blown away. I couldn't believe that something this good was on network television (let alone on ABC, which at the time was notorious for its bad hits:misses ratio). The plots were absolute genius, and I'd (very loudly) curse at the television every time an episode ended. It didn't just have me at the edge of my seat. It had me on the floor! In the back of my head I always knew that Syd would pull through. But how would she escape this time? Tune in next week!

Except now you don't have to wait seven agonizing days to find out, since it's all at your fingertips on DVD. (Or you can deliberately wait a week between viewings for a truly authentic nail-biting experience. Up to you naturally.) Even if you're one of the Alias faithful whose seen each and every episode on its original airdate, it's worth another run through. You'll probably catch all sorts of stuff you missed the first time around--the plots are as thick as a good milkshake, and it continues to amaze me how much stuff the writers could cram into a single episode. And best of all, you'll get the absolute best picture and sound quality. It's quite a different experience seeing it in widescreen, especially if you've grown accustomed to over-the-air analog. And of course there are the special features, the many different peeks behind the curtain. You'll get lots of answers to your how-did-they-do-that questions in the behind-the-scenes featurettes, cast and crew insights from the audio commentaries, and quite a few good laughs from the gag reel.

If you're an Alias fan and don't have this yet, what are you waiting for? On the other hand, if you haven't seen so much as a minute of this show's crazy costume-changing, ass-kicking, and double-crossing, you owe it to yourself to check it out.",1113523200,,1934,4.602898550724638
1500454,4,B00005JLF1,"To be completely positive from the onset I would like to write that this show is very entertaining, although a substantial suspension of disbelief must be maintained throughout if any of this show is to be taken seriously.  The acting is top-notch, the action is fun even though secret agent Sydney Bristow does have an easy time of disarming her enemies with lightning-quick kickboxing techniques (anyone with a passing interest in firearms would know she would have been shot long before her round-house kick landed); yet the most surprising aspect of this show is the cinematography.  I was constantly impressed with the professional level, movie-quality in fact, of the photography.  The lighting is lush and carefully planned, and many of the tracking shots make for some of the most breathtaking action sequences I've seen in a long time.  Jennifer Garner is the central, strong-willed yet patriotic catalyst for this story which is a potent mixture of ""La Femme Nikita"" and James Bond films with a splash of the ""X-files"" thrown in for some supernatural flavor.  That, and Jennifer Garner is a fine actress.  The rest of the cast is solid, as is the dialogue.  The dialogue is so well-written that I have to point out that the plotting is actually very predictable, at least in Season 1.  I remember countless plot-twists that I saw coming from a proverbial mile away.  I would hear all this good dialogue, see some excellent action sequences, experience some of the best acting on television, only then to be let down by either predictability, or worse, convenience for the sake of pushing the story forward.  On the back of the box for ""Alias: The Complete First Season"" it reads, ""This edge-of-your-seat collection with its heart-pounding action of unpredictable plot twists will have you gasping for air and begging for Season 2!""  By episode 11, entitled ""The Confession,"" I was starting to get a little frustrated and concerned that the writing was suffering from creative burnout.  Sydney is tortured three different times in the first 11 shows, and it was becoming ridiculous that so many of the bad-guy henchmen could be duped into thinking she is wandering through restricted areas looking for the bathroom.  But then...who shows up in episode 12 and 13, a two-parter entitled ""The Box,"" none other than the director of ""Pulp Fiction"" Quentin Tarantino.  The show gets a much-needed shot in the arm with his high energy and quirky diabolical humor.  It sounded time and again like he wrote his own dialogue for these episodes, because the writing took a giant leap skyward.  Besides, showing him and his tight band of rogue mercenaries infiltrate DS-6 to the song ""Dragula"" by Rob Zombie was easily one of the brightest highlights of the season.  The writing after that two-part show got much, much better.  There were a few more predictable plot-twists that followed, but for the most part they were forgivable (e.g. a CIA extraction that is an obvious homage to the James Bond film ""Thunderball"").  All in all, this was certainly worth my money; and after hearing that Season 2 is even better that the first season I quickly obtained a mint copy with hope and very few reservations.  This is a fun show to watch.  There is drama, action, good dialogue, professional-level photography, and with the final cliffhanger a sense that this show has a brilliant future in Season 2.

At the end of the third episode I was spitting feathers, because I wasn't able to see what happened next, why do they have to do this to you? Well, because they want you to watch...duh, and like sheep I do.

I had to one-day ship the complete season otherwise I would probably have never slept. So, now I watch and wonder if I should just go ahead and order Season 2 now to save having to wait that whole day just to get it after I finish Season 1.

Must go, ALIAS is waiting, and I have several friends who are going to kill me if I don't finish watching soon and loan them the first two discs.",1112659200,,747,4.109589041095891
1500456,4,B00005JLF1,"'Alias'is an effective hybrid of 'Mission Impossible' and better night-time soap operas like 'Dallas' or 'Falcon Crest.' Although the series is very 21st Century, creator J.J. Abrams packs 'Alias' with lots of old school quality, making this one modern action show that multiple generations can enjoy. This series is a must for any fans of Ian Fleming's James Bond novels, or TV series like 'The Man from UNCLE' or 'The Avengers.'

Jennifer Garner is at the very center of 'Alias.' Playing double agent Sydney Bristow, Garner's given the task of donning a bewildering array of costumes, wigs, and accents. Although Garner's described as an overnight sensation, she'd been working steadily in smaller roles for years prior to her breakthrough in 'Alias,' and she shines particularly well when given the chance to interact with her excellent supporting cast. There's her steadfast partner Dixon (Carl Lumbly), brainy techie Marshall (Kevin Weisman, perhaps the sweetest eccentric since Radar O'Reilly), and CIA liason Vaughn (Michael Vartan). It's two old pros, however, who attract the most attention. Victor Garber plays Sydney's emotionally distant father, and Ron Rifkin plays the enigmatically evil Sloane - the chief villain of the series. You may not recognize either Garber's or Rifkin's names but you have seen these fine character actors at work in TV and movies for years.

Most of the writing is very good in this season, and Buena Vista generously packed this box set with extras. I don't think anyone would reasonably expect this series to reflect the real-life workings of the CIA, so enjoy it as escapist espionage with light touches of science fiction. As good as this season is, though, it's nothing compared to the heights the series would reach in the second season.",1112054400,3,1784,5.16955017301038
1500457,5,B00005JLF1,"I have just finished watching the first season of ""Alias"" on DVD staring the incredible Jennifer Garner. Wow!!! What a show!!! A show packed with intrigue, suspense, faced-paced action and cliffhangers week after week. Just when I think it couldn't get any better it wow's me with a one-two punch. Since the show originally aired on TV, this is the first time I got a chance to see it in sequential order without two or three weeks of annoying pre-emptions.

 All the actors are incredible in playing their roles. Sydney Bristow played by Jennifer Garner is perfect casting as well as Marshall the High-tech guy played by Kevin Weisman. Victor Garber plays Jack Bristow, Sydney's father. Marcus Dixon played by former (Cagney and Lacey) alumni Carl Lumbly is a great partner for Sydney. Sydney's two best friends in the world are Will and Francine. They don't know she is a spy and if they did find out may be killed as was Sydney's fianc by the evil Arvin Sloane of SD-6.

When she realized that she was not working for the good guys she went to the only people who could bring them down,""The CIA."" She has a handler, a man named Vaughn. When SD-6 sends her out on an operation, Sidney goes to Vaughn for a counter-mission. She and Dixon who is unaware of her double-agent status travels with her around the world to complete these operations.

These operations they travel on are what gives the show its incredible actions scenes. The excitement and the suspense of what is happening and going to happen keeps me on the edge of my seat. The intrigue is never ending. The action scenes are mesmerizing. They way the fight their way through suspenseful situations, spinning around and kicking, blocking the punches and escaping with what they needed to complete the operation are powerfully executed and delivered.

Sydney's relationship with her father who is also a double agent has been strained for many years and they are slowly rebuilding the bridge. It is great to see Sydney with her friends Will and Francine during down time from all her spy work. They think she goes on business trips for the bank she works for Credit Dauphine which is a front for SD-6.

Along with those wonderful nail-biting action scenes are the fun scenes. Those wigs and disguises Sydney Bristow gets into and out of at least twice an episode. The photographic memory Sydney possesses and the usage of multiply languages is incredible. Also her relationship with CIA operative Michael Vaughn is interesting as well. Will they eventually get together or not remains to be seen. Or will it be Will who seems to really be in love with Sydney. Can't wait for seasons two, three, and four on DVD!!!!!",1111017600,3,2679,4.738197424892704
1500458,4,B00005JLF1,"Alias got me hooked because it's different from others shows of the genre like 24. In Alias there is a lot of mistery and some supernatural stuff that make the show much more interesting.

In this season I love the way Sidney works as a double agent, her relationship with Will and Francie, the Rambaldi prophecy and the cliffhangers. The action scenes are very good but sometimes I think Sidney is too strong for a woman, like she has super powers. It's kinda silly the way she takes down many big guys just with some punches!

This series is well done, fraught with peril and suspense. How long can our gal maintain the perilous tightrope of being a double agent? How long can SD6 survive? Is the CIA and her Dad really on top of all of this?

After watching all episodes on that CD she kicked me out of the house at 11:30 at night to go rent Season 1 Disk 2.  I want happily.  I'm a little ashamed to say that we spend almost every night for the next month or so watching the entire first, then second, then third season.

The truth is, it's kind of silly show that is obviously fictional filled with characters that are so much larger then life we know they could never really exist.  But who cares?!?

- at the beginning of each episode, we get a recap of the last episode (sometimes even with changing dialogue).

- each episode consists of (a) the (unsatisfactory) resolution of the last episode's cliff-hanger (b) the return of S.B. to home base  (c) some chitchat with friends to show the ""normal side"" of S.B. (d) the new mission (e) the final cliff-hanger.

- the foreign languages spoken by supposed native speakers or by people successfully posing as native speakers bear a *very distinctive* American accent - ridiculous and a shame, since with all the money spent on this production it would have been a small expense to get some native speakers' voices.

But the worst thing is that the characters and the overall plot remain flat, flat, flat. Watching this is like reading a novel by Follett or Grisham: Enjoyable and ""quite OK"" entertainment, but not really thrilling.",1106006400,6,1073,4.873626373626373

1500582,5,B00005JLF1,"It took some time for the general television viewing population to catch on to this show, but it is finally getting the recognition that it deserves. If you started watching this show after the first season, you absolutely need to buy this DVD set because the first season was easily the best. The intensity and suspense during the first season were at a much higher level than during any subsequent season so far. Plus, by watching the DVD's, you have the benefit of being able to watch the next episode right away after the cliffhanger ending of each show instead of having to wait a week like everybody else did (I really wish they'd bring the cliffhangers back, by the way).

If you have never watched Alias, you need to buy this DVD because you have missed out. If you like high-intensity action dramas like 24, you will absolutely love Alias. This show has a story line that keeps you guessing and one of the best casts of characters I've ever seen in a show.

Bottom line: This is one of the best television shows ever. I have watched every episode from Seasons 1-3 twice now and I still can't wait to have some free time so I can go back and watch them again.",1105747200,9,1167,4.423255813953489

Season one starts out with Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) working under cover as an agent in the world of espionage. In the first episode she is told something that rocks her world and it changes forever. Her closet friends don't even know her secrets. Season One tells the story of her struggle of living a normal life among a world of spies, by way of extraordinary disguises, amazing stunts and witty dialogue.

The double-agent aspect only made the show more enjoyable wondering every week if Sydney Bristow (the CIA agent) was going to get caught and killed or keep collecting sensitive intel trying to damage SD-6 (a secret organization of the CIA supposedly).  The premise of every episode would be sending Sydney on missions to collect artifacts or data and then receive a counter-mission from her handler Michael Vaughn.

The lead (Jennifer Garner) has no real redeeming features and lacks any believability in her role.  I also feel that the direction of this show is poor - the haphazard away the camera moves to the time shifting of scenes is ludicrous and creates a sense of frustration for the viewer.  I know many viewers here enjoy this show but I feel it's nowhere near as good as quality shows like Millennium and certain X-files seasons (3 & 4 mainly).",1102464000,9,718,4.492307692307692

Here's the scoop.  Sydney Bristow, played incredibly by Jennifer Garner, is a super spy for a subsidiary of the CIA.  Her cover is a banker at an establishment called 'Credit Dauphine'.  She must hide her identity from her best friends Will and Francie, but also her boyfriend turned fiance...  That is until she told him her identity that he got killed, and the attacks turned on her, when she learned that SD-6 is actually the enemy, and she's been working with them the whole time thinking she was doing good for the world.  Now she's a double-agent working for the CIA, along with a man she barely knows, her very own father (Victor Garber).

I'd love to give you more summary, but what fun would that be?  You all deserve to be on the edge of your living room couches with wide eyes and dropped jaws.  Be prepared.

The show stars Jennifer Garner (Sydney Bristow), Victor Garber (Jack Bristow, Syd's father), Ron Rifkin (the vindictive Arvin Sloane, head of SD-6), and Michael Vartan (Michael Vaughn, her CIA handler, and possible love interest?).  Enjoy twists, turns, excitement, lies, and entanglement as both sides fight to come ahead, as you watch and wait for the season's incredible cliff-hanger ending.

Recommended for anybody over the age of 13 with a need for excitement in their TV shows so you can get away from cheesy sitcoms and unrealistic reality TV.  Enjoy.",1101168000,4,1564,4.765799256505576
1500666,4,B00005JLF1,"If you've ever watched a James Bond movie and said to yourself: ""This flick is good an all, but it would REALLY be better if Bond was a girl, if he wore a bunch of wigs, if instead of killing his enemies he'd just beat them up so they could come back after him, and ESPECIALLY if he cried all the time,"" then Alias is the program for you!

Watching Alias just makes me realize how much I love the series ""24,"" because all the things Alias does wrong, 24 does right.  Both series debuted at the same time, with 24 the critical and ratings champ and Alias dubbed ""24 for teenagers.""  I still think that's funny, mostly because it's sort of true.  I've found that generally one is a fan of one series more than the other; rarely will you find someone who claims to like both shows equally.  It really comes down to a matter of taste in what you look for in your action programming.

Alias is sort of like a better-budgeted, WB-type, teenager-oriented show, i.e. ""Smallville"" and ""Buffy.""  Because, like those shows, Alias is a series afraid to take risks, one which instead chooses to string viewers along with empty threats and promises, only very occasionally delivering to its full potential.  This is why I consider 24 a better program; as any 24 fan well knows, that program is never afraid to take a risk.  You see, much like a comic book, death is rarely final in Alias, with characters previously considered dead returning to raise more mischief.  Villains are allowed to escape freely while our hero weeps uncontrollably.  Romantic tension arises and continues unchecked between what are supposed to be hard-bitten, world-weary spies.  Agents are able to go out on perilous missions and survive with nothing more than a wig and a stunt-doubled high-kick.  Yep, it's ""24 for teenagers,"" all right.

Season 1 is often considered the best yet of Alias, and I'll agree, though I found the first half of Season 3 to be more entertaining (probably because it was in some ways similar to the grimmer and tougher 24).  Melodrama is thick this first time out, but nowhere near the levels it would later reach.  The pace is also quicker in most episodes, which basically are constructed like a video game (basic outline for every episode: our hero Sydney receives her mission, gets a countermission from the CIA, goes out, gets in a fight, comes home, cries).  There's also more of a sense of fun this first season, something that was lost as the series progressed.

Most know the plot by now, but just for posterity: Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) is a super-agent for secret agency SD-6, which is controlled by the steely Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin, always a highlight).  After revealing her true profession to her fiance, Syd is horrified to discover that Sloane has him killed, as SD-6 protocol demands the death of any non-agent who discovers the agency's existence.  Soon Syd also discovers that SD-6 in fact has nothing to do with the US Government; instead, it's another arm of the evil Alliance organization, Bond's SPECTRE nemeses in everything but name.  She's shocked yet again to learn that her father (scene-stealing Victor Garber as Jack Bristow, probably the only character in this series who could survive in the world of 24) is also a member of SD-6, as well as a counter-agent who truly works for the CIA.  Syd continues the family tradition of counter-spying and also begins to covertly work for the CIA, where she provides intel to and receives counter-missions from the hawk-nosed and pinch-faced Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan, fresh from ""Never Been Kissed""), who soon develops non-espionage-related feelings toward her, and vice versa.

That's mostly the gist of Season 1: Syd receiving missions from SD-6 and the CIA, secretly transmitting data back to Vaughn, and maintaining her cover.  Soon however a secondary plot emerges, one that is at first engaging, but in later seasons becomes frustrating: the Rimbaldi riddle.  Sloane is enamored with this Renaissance-era inventor who created several devices which were centuries ahead of their time, and sends Syd on multiple missions to locate and retrieve many of these contraptions.  So even if spy stuff isn't your bag, there are some Indiana Jones-type hijinks as well.  Some ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" garbage, too, as Sydney unfortunately (for the intelligent viewer) discovers that she might be connected to a ""prophecy"" Rimbaldi devised.  Don't worry though, as this ridiculous element isn't really brought to the fore until the lame-brained second half of Season 3.

Unlike 24, Alias follows more of a compact structure, with only a few multiple-part episodes.  Usually plots are wrapped up in one episode, with minor subplots carrying over.  This means that the series has a frustrating knack for recapping what's been going on every few episodes, which is especially irritating when viewing on DVD.  There are also several episodes which serve as nothing more than an obvious gambit to gain new viewers, similar to those ""flashback episodes"" sitcoms like ""Family Ties"" would throw at you every few seasons.  But whereas those shows would resort to this only after having been on the air for a few years, Alias does it a mere handful of episodes in.

Much is made of the pilot episode, and it probably is one of the very best episodes in the show's history.  Paying tribute to ""Run Lola Run"" and the more recent Bond flicks, this extra-long episode looks and feels like a compact, well-done film.  The two-parter with Quentin Tarantino as rogue SD-6 agent McKenna Cole, later in the season, is also enjoyable.  A ""Die Hard"" tribute (the terrorists pull up to SD-6 headquarters in a van bearing the name ""McTiernan Air Conditioning,"" referencing that film's director), this story is harmed only by the fact that Syd has nothing to do in it; she spends the majority of the first part just trying to gain access to an elevator shaft.  Better yet is another two-parter, toward the end of the season, in which Syd encounters a former boyfriend, who's also an SD-6 agent.  However this story is also ruined, as it's totally obvious who the guy really is.

Anyway, Alias is a fun show with a strong cast, good production values, and at least for this season, solid writing.  It does drive me crazy how Sydney is able to get along on her missions by just punching out her enemies ""Buffy""-style, but if ""Charlie's Angels"" is your thing, you won't mind.  It's just that the occasional melodrama, goofy Rimbaldi junk, and incessant crying drags the show down.",1101168000,4,6528,4.8546931407942235

1500672,5,B00005JLF1,"Don't get me wrong -- ""Felicity"" was a decent show and definitely had its good points, but nothing I saw in that show would lead me to believe that J.J. Abrams, the creative mind behind both ""Felicity"" and ""Alias"" and now a new show called ""Lost,"" would be capable of this sort of work.

Well, consider my opinions revised. This first season of ""Alias"" represents some of the best television I've seen in quite some time. I'd heard of it, of course, and when I picked it up my wife and I started watching it late one Saturday night. We were both hooked, and I mean immediately. We stayed up watching the next episodes until we literally couldn't keep our eyes open any longer, and then we did the same the next night, and the next, until the season was done. Then we started on season two. I'm here to tell you that ""Alias"" is the crack cocaine of episodic television -- it's that addictive.

And with good reason... the story of Sydney Bristow, who at the beginning of the show appears to be just a struggling (possibly daydreaming) college student, then walks into a building and becomes a secret agent for a special ops division of the government, and THEN learns that even that part of her life is a falsehood (and we're still in the first episode here, folks) is positively gripping.

Jennifer Garner brings an astonishingly adept quality to her character. On the one hand Sydney has the sensitivity and the emotions we might expect of a young woman in college, but she also has a harder edge to her, an intelligence and a confidence which she brings to her work convincingly and unerringly. Garner balances both aspects of this role very well, and we get to see some of that balance almost every episode. The other actors surrounding her, such as Ron Rifkin and Victor Garber, bring their considerable talents to the table as well, and the combination is utterly believable. I find myself really enjoying Garber's acting in particular, and admiring his stoic, straightforward, no-bull attitude even though I know it's all an act (in more ways than one).

In terms of the episodes themselves, it should be evident almost right away that these are not stand-alone stories. Abrams is telling a broad story in ""Alias,"" one which we follow from one episode to another, to the point that if a viewer were to miss a few they would get quickly lost. Almost every episode in this first season is of a consistent quality that makes them all delightful to watch. Other than a couple episodes near the end of the first season, in which they seemed to stumble and lose their way a little, the writers and directors of this show keep it interesting through every episode. Even the brief lapse near the end is made up for by a bang-up season finale which will leave you clamoring for season two.

I would be remiss if I didn't mention my favorite part of the first season of ""Alias"" -- the two-part episode called ""The Box."" Though involving many elements from the preceding story, ""The Box"" is about as close to a stand-alone story as you get in ""Alias,"" as most of the major story elements of its two episodes are self-contained, with some story threads making their way in and out of it -- not necessarily the same threads, of course. Apart from featuring a prominent ""guest"" role for Quentin Tarantino (in which he proves yet again that he's not a great actor, but the show doesn't suffer for it), ""The Box"" is notable because its of good enough quality as it was made to hold its own against almost any big-budget blockbuster action film showing up on the silver screen, and in fact ""The Box"" comes out ahead of most action films in many ways. From the intelligence and complexity of the story to the high standard of production, these two episodes stood out for me in almost every way.

As a whole, the first season of ""Alias"" is everything you've probably heard it is. It's a complex, intelligent, high-octane thrill-ride of a story, and it's utterly addictive. The first episode is like the first few peaks and valleys of a roller coaster, but bear in mind that it's nothing compared to the loop-de-loops you're going to experience down the line. It might throw you around a bit, but you'll keep coming back for more, I'm sure.

Strap in, and enjoy the ride.",1099180800,5,4257,4.593421052631579

1500765,2,B00005JLF1,"After being exposed to several great TV shows (i.e. Angel, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, 24), Alias seemed like a guaranteed purchase.  Reading many reviews here at amazon.com (never caught the show on TV), I got the impression that Alias was the best of both worlds: character development a la Buffy/Angel and the intensity of 24.  What I've found is that it has neither.

I'm not trying to slag a show that so many people love, but the first season of Alias did nothing for me.  I never really found any of the major characters as ""interesting"" or cared too much about what happened to them.  They came across as flat for some reason and I'm sorry I cannot pinpoint why.  Then there was the whole ""scheme"" of Alias.  I know most (if not all) TV shows can be boiled down to a formula but Alias just seemed to bother me.  The majority of the episodes start with Sydney at one location or another, making an escape of some sort, coming back home for a bit and discussing her operation, and then getting flown out somewhere else to set up for a dramatic cliffhanger.  The cliffhangers were highly effective in getting me to watch the next episode for the first 7-8 shows.  After that, I realized that after each cliffhanger, the intensity that it left with seemed to vaporize with the start of the next show, giving Sydney what seemed to be an almost predictable escape out of harm's way.  After I picked up on this, the ""thrill"" of NEEDING to watch the next episode disappeared and so did my interest in Alias.

1500768,5,B00005JLF1,"ALIAS, in its first two years, is a damn great television show. Sydney Bristow, a special agent/grad student who uncovers that she works for an enemy of the government - rather than for the government itself - when her fiance is killed, is a layered, fascinating, funny, friendly and emotional heroine that you'll enjoy getting to know. Oh, and she's an AMAZING superspy capable of daring stunts, amazing disguises and narrow escapes. She masters languages, reads lips, breaks down complicated ancient codes in her head AND she kicks serious butt.

Every episode of ALIAS is layered both in deep emotional issues and international intrigue and suspense. It's incredibly well-written, terribly complicated, well-made by J.J. Abrams and very well-acted by the ensemble cast, headlined by Jennifer Garner, Ron Rifkin, Michael Vartan and the superb Victor Garber.

The highlight of the first season is watching Syd seriously try to function in her double life without getting caught by her friends Will and Francie or, worse, by SD-6, the horrible, villainous organization that she's working for and working against at the same time.

And the first season, as great and compelling as it is, is just the cliffhanger-filled opening act for the dazzling, twisted second season.

1500772,5,B00005JLF1,"As my review title indications, this fast-paced series comes across as a stylish blend of a James Bond spy flick, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER girl-powered heroine, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE capers, and PERILS OF PAULINE cliffhangers.  The latter is not peripheral to the series:  like old style film serials, almost every episode of Season One ends with a shock.  I have only recently discovered the series on DVD, which I believe is merciful.  Had I been watching it on TV as it first came out, I would have found the week-in, week-out cliffhanging endings to be exasperating.  The show is brilliant at breaking the action at precisely the most thrilling instant each week.  I know this:  if I had been watching this on TV, I would definitely have tuned in the next week.  As it is, I immediately pop in the next DVD just to see what happened next.  Like both MISSION IMPOSSIBLE and I SPY, the show features locales from all over the world, though obviously most of the scenes consist of a single remote shot to establish the country, with the rest of the scene most likely shot on a backlot or in a studio.  Nonetheless, even this gives the show a very cosmopolitan, exotic feel.

I'm one of those who thinks that the best thing that ever happened to TV is the long story arc TV show that was popularized by THE X-FILES, and carried on by such shows as BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, ANGEL, and FARSCAPE.  The one way that TV surpasses cinema is in its ability to tell a long, carefully detailed story in a lovingly nuanced and unrushed manner.  ALIAS has a host of storylines, but it isn't forced to develop any of them all at once.  One week might find a small development in Sydney's ongoing attempt to work as a double agent in SD6, a larger development in Will's investigation into the death of Sydney's fiance in the first episode, and a tiny bit on some non-espionage friendship.  Movies have to rush such things, or at most present the illusion of not having to rush.  TV can truly take its time, and the overall effect in the best shows can be exhilarating.

Everything about this show clicks.  It is visually as slick as anything that has ever been on TV.  The writing is absolutely brilliant.  The cast is rock solid, and features some great acting on the part of several performers.  Among my favorite are Victor Garber as Sydney's father, Kevin as Marshall J. Flinkman (basically SD6's equivalent of Q), and Ron Rifkin as Sloane.  But the heart of the show is Jennifer Garner as double agent Sydney Bristow.  Sydney is idealistic, brilliant, and enormously competent, but also haunted and conflicted by her family background and tragic events in her life.  I love the contrast between her professional competence and her emotional fragility.  A lesser actress wouldn't be able to sell that combination, but she makes it the key to her personality.

It is difficult to overpraise the writing on the show.  Even compared to shows like BUFFY it has almost completely avoided the episodic approach to television.  In fact, the episodes spill over into each other to such a degree that it is almost as if the entire season were a single story, except for the way it spills over as well.  Not every storyline gets equal attention, but overall the balance they achieve is astonishing.  Some reviewers decry the show as derivative, but I find the particular combination of familiar elements to be quite unique.  Other shows do some of the things that ALIAS does, but not all of them.",1092268800,17,3475,4.666118421052632

It took me a couple of months to get around to spinning it up on the DVD player, but once I did ... *WOW*, what a show!!  Jennifer Garner as agent Sydney Bristow (who becomes DOUBLE-agent Sydney Bristow in the premiere episode) and Victor Garber as her father (and also agent) Jack Bristow both provide stellar performances.

Jennifer Garner (Sydney) must show a huge emotional range -- from very reserved as an on-mission CIA agent to distraught due to personal tragedies.  Victor Garber (Jack) gets to play a much more subtle range ... initially as cold, hard, and calculating, but very gradually showing greater emotional range as the series progresses.  Each time he shows slightly more emotion, you notice because it's surprising.

The show is visually stunning ... the sets are elaborate, the special effects are extremely well done.  You know that effects MUST be in use at times, but they're subtle enough that you can't tell where the ""live"" shots end and the effects begin.

The Rimbaldi puzzle weaves another fascinating mystery throughout the series.

This show was not just thrown together -- the story through the whole first season (and into the second season) was VERY carefully woven, to maintain several story-line threads throughout.

This is pure ""TV heroin"" -- one dose and you will be completely hooked.  I planned to watch one episode per night, and usually watched two (sometimes three), then had to go in to work bleary-eyed the next morning.

The good news is, watching it on DVD is the way to go -- no commercials and you don't have to wait a week for the next episode (which would be pure torture).  We've bought the Second Season and ""have to"" pre-order the Third Season.",1086739200,4,1785,4.7752442996742674

The main character is Sydney Bristow, super hot spy chick for the SD-6 organization. Her fianc&eacute;e is killed in the first episode, and she finds out SD-6 is not really part of the CIA as she was led to believe. Vowing to take the organization down, Sydney goes to the real CIA and is put with handler Michael Vaughn as a double agent. Vaughn, with his cute, hangdog puppy eyes is obviously Sydney's next romantic attachment. Sydney soon finds that her father and her mother were both spies, as well, and everyone is trailing after artifacts from Milo Rambaldi, a 15th century cross between DaVinci and Nostradamus.

Radical shows like FOX's Dark Angel and CBS's Wolf Lake were quickly cancelled.  I don't know how this show wound up on the same schedule as the usual safe, clunky, family fare, but I'm glad it did.
Watching Alias is absolutely addictive.  It is like being trapped on a rollercoaster where once you think you will be able to disembark, the ride starts up again.  And each ride has new twists, turns, and tunnels.  Every aspect of this show is excellent.  And as good as the writing, the hypnotic throbbing score, the sets, photography, and characters are, the vehicle could not be carried without its star, Jennifer Garner.
Garner's athletic ability, intelligence, vulnerability, and sweetness make her character Sydney Bristow a TV legend.  Her angst-filled relationship with her father is what sets this series apart from any other.  Usually the only deep relationship a woman in a series is allowed to have is a romantic one.  Why they haven't done an Alias, the Movie is beyond me.  An important lesson from watching Alias is that nothing is what it seems - or is it?",1085443200,4,1202,4.708133971291866

The ongoing plot stays crisp adding many twists and turns until you finally hit the finally, which is a very good reflection and completion of the initial premiere episode.

  So what makes every DVD special is the bonus material. Alias Season one offers a nice range of extra's on the last disc of this six disc set. The outtakes (gag reel) and production notebooks are fun to watch and very informative and the stunt special is definitely a must see for all fans. The bonus materials also offer deleted scenes, which really don't add that much and previews of the coming season and the video game.

1500959,5,B00005JLF1,"""Alias"" is one of those television programs that I had no interest in watching when it first aired, but as there has been good buzz about the show I was able to give it a chance on DVD.  It's a good thing that I did because right from the first episode I was sucked into the story and each episode left me wanting to know the explanation for what just happened and what was going to happen next.
Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) is an agent for SD-6.  When she was recruited to SD-6 she was led to believe that it was a covert branch of the CIA.  Except for those at the highest levels of SD-6, all the agents believe that they are working for the CIA.  They are all wrong.  When Sydney told her fianc&eacute; that she worked as a spy for SD-6, they had him killed.  It was only then that she learned that SD-6 was the very enemy she thought she was fighting against.  She went directly to the CIA and now she works as a double agent to help bring down SD-6.  If this sounds a bit complicated, just remember that we learn all of this in the first episode of the series.  It gets even more complicated from there.
Sydney also learns that her father (Victor Garber), whom she has never been close to, is not only a member of SD-6 but also a double agent with the CIA.  Sydney is still given missions from Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin), but her CIA Handler Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan) gives her the CIA's counter-mission for her true objective.  So, Sydney is working both sides on her missions, but is also trying to keep the fact that she is working against SD-6 from her partner Marcus Dixon (Carl Lumbly), who believes that SD-6 is part of the CIA and is one of the good guys.  These missions gradually build the greater story arc of the season/series with something called the Rimbaldi artifact.  These artifacts are amazingly advanced and prescient for something designed and created over 500 years ago.  The major world powers (both official like CIA and the underworld like SD-6, K-Directorate) are looking for these artifacts because of the incredible potential to shift the balance of power one way or another.
While this is happening, Sydney's friend, Will Tippin (Bradley Cooper), a newspaper reporter, is investigating the death of Sydney's fianc&eacute;.  Since just learning about SD-6 was enough to get the fianc&eacute; killed we know that Will is treading into dangerous waters.  This storyline often takes a back seat, but it is interesting to see what he will be able to uncover and how this may affect his relationship with Sydney.
At many times this can be a confusing show because you are not quite sure how everything connects to the larger picture, but it is easy to stay interested in the show for that very reason: you want to know how it all comes out in the end.  To make matters worse, the ending of nearly episode is such a cliffhanger that even when I think I have watched my last episode of the day I just have to watch one more to find out how the cliffhanger is resolved.  It is the mark of good television that keeps me coming back for more.  I would put this show with ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" as a show that is really good but is not quite as serious as something like ""The Sopranos"" or ""The West Wing"".  It deals with serious subjects and has action and adventure, but it doesn't fit neatly into a genre.  All in all, I think this is an excellent show and I look forward to watching season two.",1078790400,,3432,4.4504792332268375

The script writers on Alias are pure genius and everybody involved with this show should be very, very proud of it, especially the actors.

Now my husband and I, who almost gave up on the series, watch 2 to 3 episodes every night.  Each episode is well plotted, and the ending just leaves you hanging....
I have not given the show the full 5 stars because some plot details should be perfected.  For example, what company keeps the same security code for 8 years? or how can you only dig 4 feet and find an underground cave which was built 500 years before?
But it is good entertainment, and the characters are well drawn.

Do not be fooled by thinking it is just a spy show with a pretty girl who dresses in exotic outfits...it is so much more.
  Alias will have you hooked already by watching it's first episode.  It is very fast-paced and keeps you very much interested throughout.

Or is she?  She was sworn to secrecy about the agency, but when she told her new fianc about SD-6, he was killed by SD-6 security officers.  Sydney then learned two things; the first is that her father, Jack Bristow (Victor Garber) is a senior officer of SD-6, and that she is not part of the CIA.  SD-6 is part of a group called the Alliance of 12, which is an enemy of the United States.  There are SD cells across the globe, and their goal is to destroy the U.S. and its allies and become ever more powerful.  So Syd goes to Langley to join the real CIA and become a double agent inside SD-6.  Finally, she realizes that Jack is another CIA double who has infiltrated SD-6.  And that's all in the pilot episode.  As the season goes on, Sydney reports her missions to her CIA handler, Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), who gives her counter-missions.  Many of these missions pit Sydney against the K-Directorate, a modern version of the KGB.  However, things begin to get complicated when a man named Milo Rambaldi, a sixteenth century prophet, comes into the picture.  Rambaldi has unfinished work, and he left artifacts all over the world so that someone in the future would.  Soon, a new organization emerges, led by the mysterious The Man, whose identity could mean trouble for Sydney, Jack, and Vaughn.

Exotic locales, over-the-top action and costumes, hair-raising torture, cool gadgets and a nail biting cliff-hanger at the end of just about every episode insure your waiting with baited breath until the next episode.
For neophyte fans like myself, the season 1 DVD set is invaluable to knowing the entire story of Sydney's adventures up until this season (many of the current episodes contain hints at events from earlier episodes).
There are some notable flaws to the show mixed in with the great moments.  Michael Vartan seems to always look like a whipped puppy, the ""Snowman"" sub-plot seemed to be something the writers tacked on so Jennifer Garner could have sex with someone and Ms. Garner cries way too much for a trained spy.  But these are relatively minor complaints given the fact that the show itself strikes an almost perfect balance between  action, drama and humor... and of course those dang cliff hangers that keep you longing for more.  If you watch Alias now, there is a serious chance that you may become an addicted couch potato.  You've been warned.",1073347200,3,1321,4.737991266375546
1501146,3,B00005JLF1,"Take the look/sound/tempo of ""Run, Lola, Run"" and apply it liberally to a James Bond -esque story. Add lots of eye candy. Add a bazillion plot twists that, after a while, don't make any sense at all and which exist only to give the sense of plot progression. Viola! You've got Alias!!!
Jennifer Garner dresses up in outrageous costumes and does a lot of kick-boxing and running. It's fun, but after a while the sheer repetition of the whole thing begins to wear you down. And, too, there's no sense of anything really happening, after a while. Compare this with ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer,"" for example. Each season of Buffy has an overall plot arc that moves the whole thing forward. Stuff actually happens. Characters evolve.
If you're looking for something pleasantly vapid with lots of action, you could do worse than getting this series. Jennifer Garner is absolutely gorgeous and does a fine job throughout. But take it in small doses, is my advice. Otherwise, you might quickly get bored with the formulaic nature of the program.",1073260800,10,1036,4.825842696629214
1501147,5,B00005JLF1,"What can I say about Alias that hasn't already been said? It's exhilarating, moving, heartbreaking, tragic and full of hope. The one thing I won't say about it, however, is that it's unrealistic. Yes, I realize that it sometimes slips over the line between fiction and fantasy, but calling it unrealistic is way too technical.
The truth is, no matter what the writers of Alias write, we (the fans) believe it. Can Sydney really beat up 5 men armed with only a broom? Of course. Because this show's writers and actors/actresses have talent that you rarely see in movies, and never see on television.
The dialogue, coupled with the intensity of emotion that Jennifer Garner and the rest of the cast bring to this show makes it completely believable, if not realistic.
Bottom Line: If you haven't seen this series, buy it immediately. I'm sure that 99 out of 100 people will treasure this box set!
If you have seen this series, buy the DVDs. Even if you already have the episodes on tape, the extras featured in this set are well worth it.
Happy watching!",1073174400,,1052,4.661290322580645
1501148,5,B00005JLF1,"Sure, I am already a fan of Alias, so this review is a bit biased. I bought the season one DVD of Alias for my husband for Christmas and he hasn't been able to watch it. I have been transfixed. The commentary is by far very fun. If you're a fan and want to pick up little tidbits, turn it on. For instance, the writers acknowledge that they never really revealed who was telling Will all the info about SD-6, but do have a backstory planned for a later season. Oooh. I cannot wait.  The gag reel is too much fun. I wish it was longer than the four minutes it plays.  Seeing the actors laughing, tripping, etc is just really fun.",1073088000,,628,4.139344262295082
1501149,3,B00005JLF1,"Always action packed and entertaining, the first season of Alias, like a lot of television shows, was hampered a bit by having to set up its premise and characters. All of this paid off with the second season but the first season is exceptional with a number of strong episodes. Sydney (the wonderful Jennifer Garner) discovers that, while she thought she was working for the CIA, she was, in fact, working for the bad guys in an organization called SD-6. Sydney finds out the hard way when her fiance is brutally murdered at the orders of Sloan ( the oily Ron Rifkin) her boss at SD-6. She discovers all of this from her father ( the exceptional Victor Garber). She had assumed her father was working for a company that makes airplane parts but he's an agent for SD-6 and there's more; he's a double agent spying on the organization for the CIA.
The plot twists like a modern rollercoaster. Sydney eventually agrees to become a double agent for the CIA as well to eventually get Sloan and SD-6 for the bad things they've done. Unfortunately, most of the people including her partner (the superb Carl Lumley)believe they're working for the good guys which creates quite a bit of conflict for Sydney.
Creator J. J. Abrams has created an unusual blend of The Prisoner, Mission: Impossible, The X-Files and Felicity. What's amazing is that the series works despite drawing on these varied sources. The writing is, for the most part, first class and the acting in his spy opera is exceptional. If some of the performances are a bit over-the-top, keep in mind it works within the genre and the format of the show.
The first six episodes are exceptional but when the series gets bogged down in the Rimbaldi Prophecy late in the season, the show loses some of its focus. Abrams tries a bit too hard to build up a mythology much like The X-Files by using this McGuffin to drive the stories. Unfortunately, it becomes a bit too much of a focus during the last part of season one. It's not bad, just a bit much to swallow.
The story arc of the first season will be, for the most part, resolved by the middle of season two allowing for fresh, interesting vistas to keep fans interested. One other unusual attribute of the series is the stunt casting. During season one and two we see a number of exceptional guest stars including Christian Slater, Rutger Hauer, Amy Irving and Ethan Hawke. The casting works because the actors play characters that lend themselves for instant identification and to their strengths.
The DVD transfer are quite good with some compression issues but nothing noteable. The sound is exceptional. There are a number of cool extras including the gag reel for the season and three featurettes plus commentary on a number of key episodes. My only complaint is that Touchstone doesn't have a chapter menu within individual episodes. If you forget to activate your memory on your DVD player and have to stop playing it, you'll have to skip around a bit. It wouldn't have been that big a deal to provide the additional chapter selections on the disc (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine is a great example of this).
While the kudos for the show is much deserved, the second season is really where the series pays off. I'd still recommend renting or purchasing the first season in order to follow the story arcs set up for season two (and later season three).",1072915200,11,3359,4.656565656565657
1501150,4,B00005JLF1,"My first experience with TV serials (after long break) was with '24', which I loved. This experince led me to rent dvd with 'Alias' and although this serial is a very good quality entertainment, it's one level below '24'. But, on the other hand, maybe the level was set too high. What makes 'Alias' worth watching is that its creators don't take what they are doing very seriously. It's just pure entertainment. I thought it started a little slow but it picked the tempo later. It is filled with action. Jennifer Garner is great. She is so natural in any surroundings. Other actors are good as well. I was especially impressed by Ron Rifkin: very convincing. All in all it is not a movie where you cannot wait to see the next episode, but still when you watch it you enjoy it.",1072051200,,776,4.471830985915493

I bought the season 1 dvds 2 weeks ago and had watched them twice over by the last week. I live in Australia and we are in a different region so we did not get all the bonus features. We didn't get Marshall's gadget gallery or the ""A Mission around the world"". I loved the cast commentaries, especially the one for the finale with the whole main cast.

1501152,5,B00005JLF1,"Alias is an amazing labyrinth of a television show:  overwrought, spellbinding, stunning, moving, engaging, puzzling, impenetrable, and, oh yeah, human.  Sydney Bristow is easy to root for, but for me it's her father Jack Bristow that is somehow the heart of the story:  so damaged, so interior, so pressured, it's a wonderful pleasure just to watch Garber's masterfully understated performance.  His impassive, nearly blank facade hides deep emotion:  hurt, fear, and love for his daughter.  Even Arvin Sloane, a truly evil, sometimes creepy, man, is consumed by love for his dying wife.  And Sydney, well, she's the star and deservedly:  gorgeous, bright, perfect for the role.  Wonderful stuff.  This is better than most movies because of the sheer amount of time available in a television season to develop plotlines, characters, ideas.  Whatever you pay for this set isn't enough.  Amazing.",1070668800,2,895,5.314285714285714
1501153,5,B00005JLF1,"Winston Churchill once said the Soviet Union was ""a mystery wrapped in an enigma,"" which is a good description of ""Alias: The Complete First Season.""  The initial premise is that Agent Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) is working for SD-6 (Section Disparue 6, as in the one that disappeared), which she believes to be part of the CIA.  Instead it turns out that she is working for the very people she thinks she has been fighting against.  After you get past the point in the first season when Sydney understands what is going on, the opening narration each week explains the situation and the cast of characters.  That is necessary because anyone who skipped an episode in the first season was going to be missing one or more pieces of the puzzle and be even more in the dark than they would otherwise.  Fortunately, when you have the entire first season on DVD that is not a problem.  You can even go back and try to piece together what is happening and try to connect the dots.
For those television viewers who have been looking for something more challenging that regular dramatic fare, ""Alias"" could well constitute an overdose.  The only thing really comparable on television is ""24,"" but ""Alias"" has more gadgets, better action sequences, and a whole lot better costumes (both quantitatively and qualitatively).  Beyond Churchill the other relevant quote would be with regards to tangled webs of deception, because this show gets really complicated.  Did Jack Bristow (Victor Garber) work for the KGB as an assassin?  Is Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin) Sydney's real father?  Is jouaanlist Will Tippin (Bradley Cooper) going to discover the truth about Syndey's ""real"" job?  Is Sydney going to tell Marcus Dixon (Carl Lumbly) that they are not working for CIA before he figures out that she is a double-agent?  When is Sydney's handler CIA Agent Michael C. Vaughn (Michael Vartan) finally going to make a move on her?  Will Sydney ever finish her degree?  And what is up with Sydney's mom?  Yes, things get a bit over the top with the whole Rambaldi bit and who knows if we will ever figure out the significant of the number 47 for the Pope's architect, but just hang on and enjoy the ride.
Not being able to follow all the action is not a problem because it becomes clear early on that we are not supposed to be able to do so, and after a while you become satisifed with being only a half-step behind Sydney.  I have only touched upon a few of the plotlines running rampant during season one, and that is without taking into account all the missions to exotic places around the world as Sydney gets in deeper and deeper.  My only really criticism is that Jennifer Garner cries a lot for a super spy, which seems especially strange since Daddy Dearest is wound so tight and mom has been out of the picture, so to speak, for a long time.  However, Garber's minimalist style (Look!  His right nostril flared!  Jack is really ticked off now!) is one of the true joys of the show which has an impressive cast where the likes of Amy Irving and Patricia Wettig have small but pivotal roles.
These six DVDs contain all 22 episodes from the first season, with all of the episodes being letterboxed and the transfers enhanced for 16 x 9 television sets.  Audio commentary is provided for four episodes: ""Truth be Told"" (The Pilot) by J.J. Abrams & Jennifer Garner, ""So It Begins"" by Michael Bonvillain, Sarah Caplan & Ken Olin, ""Q&A"" by John Eisendrath, Alex Kurtzman-Counter & Roberto Orci, and ""Almost Thirty Years"" by Jennifer Garner, Michael Vartan, Victor Garber, Bradley Cooper, Carl Lumbly, Ron Rifkin, Merrin Dungey, & Kevin Weisman. All four commentary tracks are above average, but the pilot track is the most informative in terms of providing insight into the show's origins and the way the visual style evolved.  All the other bonus material appears on the last disc, where there is a featurette narrated by series creator J.J. Abrams, one on stunts, six deleted scenes, television spots, and a gag reel.  Season Two has just become available on DVD as well, so those who want to catch up to what is happening can now be more than half way there.",1070668800,2,4149,4.698895027624309

1501265,5,B00005JLF1,"There has never been before, nor do I ever expect again, a season of any TV show as much fun as the first season of Alias.  Following season one, Alias is still one of my favorite TV shows, but season one easily takes the cake for my favorite season of any TV series, ever.
Alias is to spy thrillers what Star Wars is to science fiction: sheer escapist fun with enough underlying drama to give it some depth.  Since it's designed to be escapist entertainment, it's not intended to be realistic (there's even a little science fiction worked in), but it's no parody either -- the superb acting, which IS emotionally realistic, is a pleasure to watch.  Alias is a rich labyrinth of tense espionage, twists and turns, thrill-ride suspense, mysterious secrets, inter-organizational intrigue, character humor, and poignant drama performed by a top-notch cast.  It's wonderfully complex, as any great spy-thriller should be, and in this case, complexity has never been so much fun.
Alias is very serialized, so you must see it from the beginning!  If you haven't been watching and you want to give it a try, then I can't recommend the season one DVD set heartily enough.
If you've been avoiding trying Alias because you've assumed it's just another hot-chick action show, then, quite frankly, you have absolutely no idea what you've been missing.  Although it is true that Alias is part action show and that Jennifer Garner is ""hot,"" Alias is NOT just another hot-chick action show.  On the contrary, Alias is in fact richly entertaining at a great many levels.  This is reflected in the fact that season one was nominated for eleven Emmy Awards (of which it won two) and that Jennifer Garner won a Golden Globe Award for best dramatic actress for her role as Sydney Bristow in season one.  The wonderful thing about this show is how it can have depth and wonderful acting but not be afraid to be a whole lot of fun at the same time.

1501354,5,B00005JLF1,"""Alias"" is a great show.  It's also wildly implausible.  Jennifer Gardner stars as Sydney Bristow: grad student by day, spy by night, and double agent in her spare time.  She does all this while racking up a million frequent flyer miles a year.  It's not surprising that she's unlucky in love and often an emotional basket case.  But when she's in the middle of a mission Sydney's got cool that James Bond can't match (OK, maybe the Timothy Dalton Bond could keep up).
The ABC network has helped the series considerably with liberal deviation from the accepted hour show format.  This began with an uninterrupted showing of the pilot when the series debuted: 66 minutes without commercial or other interruption, a nearly unheard-of occurrence in American TV.  The following 21 episodes fit the standard 45 minutes of content for an ""hour"" show, but many ran for 15 or more minutes before the credits and first commercial break (in sharp contrast to the 2-3 minute convention before first ad break).
The star and special effects crew of ""Alias"" are constantly pushing the envelope.  Jennifer Garner had minimal action show work under her belt when she started on the series.  Garner could run and dance, but was keen to learn more.  It soon became apparent to the writers and stunt crew that she was adept at memorizing: not just scripts, but also stunt choreography and foreign language phonetics.  The foreign languages in ""Alias"" are much more compelling than the usual cheat of English with some phony foreign accent.  Garner has since studied kickboxing and wire stunts, and actually looks forward to jumping off 100' buildings as a regular part of her job.
""Alias"" is in many ways a very flawed show.  The flaws do not keep it from being remarkably entertaining.  There's lots of impossible spy gadgetry, but the Bond movies have made us come to expect that.  No real spy agency would keep on an agent as prone to emotional collapse as Sydney Bristow, yet both SD-6 and the CIA consider her a valuable asset.  The whole prophetic 15th century Milo Rambaldi technology schtick is WAY out there.  And many of the effects over-reach.  One particularly egregious example is the oft-shown exploding car sequence.  The hood pops off and the car pitches up while fire lights it from below/behind.  Since you can see through the engine compartment it's glaringly apparent that this stunt car did not, in fact, actually have an engine in it as it rolled down the road.
""Alias"" show honchos have hedged their bets by going with known quantities where possible.  Series creator J.J. Abrams worked with star Garner on ""Felicity"", and has known Greg Grunberg (a ""Felicity"" regular) since childhood.  Kevin Weisman played a recurring role on ""Felicity"".  (Amanda Foreman, another ""Felicity"" regular, shows up in seasons two and three.)  Executive producer Ken Olin appears in a small recurring role, and his wife and ""thirtysomething"" costar Patricia Wettig also plays a recurring character on ""Alias"".
In the first season notable guest stars include Gina Torres, Quentin Tarantino, Angus Scrimm, Amy Irving, Lindsay Crouse, Terry O'Quinn, and Peter Berg.
""Alias"" is written as a continuous story arc and few episodes end without leaving the viewer eager to see what comes next.  The first season has plot threads involving Sydney's graduate school studies, her secret agent work for SD-6, her double agent work for the CIA, clueless best friends Will and Francie, the thaw in her relationship with her distant father, the mysterious Alliance, the prophetic works of Milo Rambaldi, and the growing question of what happened to her mother.
As Sydney's view of her mother changes, so does the casting.  The character is played in the first season by Arabella Holzbog (in old photos), Natasha Pavlovich (in grainy surveillance footage), and April Webster in a quick backlit scene.  The character gains major importance in the second season when played by Lena Olin.
It's not surprising that the show's producers and writers spend considerable time worrying about ways to bring viewers up to speed if they've missed or forgotten plot points.  There's a lot going on in ""Alias"", and you don't want to blink sometimes for fear of being thrown off the roller-coaster.
The DVD first season collection of ""Alias"" is unremarkable for its packaging and extra content.  This is mostly a good thing.  The effort went into excellent video and audio transfer, and the menus are less annoying than most.  Extra content is largely what they had lying around in the editing room: a few deleted scenes, and the ABC promo spots for a few episodes.  Audio commentary was added in three of the 22 episodes, including the first and last.",1066780800,23,4705,4.969348659003831
1501355,5,B00005JLF1,Let's start by saying there is too many great things about this show to list them all here besides if i mentioned all of them it would ruin some of the fantastic suprises that await you on this show or should i say short movies. I have seen alot of action television shows and the reason i enjoyed this more than anything else is that it gets you away for an hour much like some of the movies do at the theatre for two i feel almost as if i have watched a motion picture after one of these episodes. The acting is so much better than anything i have seen now i look at these other shows and can't help noticing the poor acting going on. The entire cast is perfect and jennifer garner should win every emmy award until the show ends with the acting she has done on this show UNBELIEVABE not to mention the fantastic acting by the rest of the cast WOW.  give this show a beyond perfect score it deserves more than the maximum five stars allowed if you have not seen it this dvd is perfect each episode is presented in anamorphic widescreen ( those who have widescreen tv's will be in heavan) and fantastic 5.1 surround sound along with some fantastic special features including a great gag reel and a very cool look into season two. So i urge you who have not seen this show rent or better yet buy this season now you will be on the edge of your seat from the moment it starts. And if jennifer garner or the writers of alias are reading this i just have to say sydney needs to hook up with vaughn soon. five stars fantastic show.,1066262400,,1527,4.176271186440678
1501356,5,B00005JLF1,"Alias, is by far the best television show on prime time tv these days.  Watching the DVD of season one intensified my opinion of the show.  I found myself watching all six discs in a weekend.  The episodes are addicting!  The action, characters and plot are incredible.  I'm counting down the days until season two (which should be out by now-fans are waiting...)and grin and bare it watching season three-with commericals and having to wait a week:(...Jennifer Garner is amazing as well as her chemistry with Michael Vartan-it only increases the desire to watch more!  Victor Garber's character is fantastic! I watched season two last year and know what to expect, but can't wait!!!  Anyone who likes good, woth-while tv, watch Alias and be surprised by the standard JJ Abrams just rose!!!",1065916800,,790,4.9393939393939394

Not only do you get romance, international intrigue and great gagetry, but you get a show with a heart.  Sydney Bristow is a great female role model and played by one of Hollywoods up and coming.  Jennifer Garner is outstanding as is the rest of the cast.  Do yourself a favor and purchase this set...it will only leave you begging for Season 2 and 3...Enjoy",1065484800,,513,4.3125

There are so many twists and turns that would pretty much make you glued to your tv set and on the edge of your seat until the very end. The writing is very creative and the all the actors are excellent in portraying their parts. This show is simply-AWESOME!!!!!",1064966400,,408,4.602739726027397
1501359,5,B00005JLF1,"I am not a fan of any serial shows so understandably, I have missed Alias on its 1st season.  Good thing though my husband bought the entire Season 1 set & now, I am losing sleep several nights in a row trying to watch as many episodes as possible.  I have found my new idol in Sydney Bristow .... total girl power!  The shows may be too charged up- what with new venues, various costumes, new risky projects, etc. - but that only makes the spy world more alluring :)
Although you can watch the episodes separately, I strongly advise you watch them in their chronological order.  It makes more sense that way.  Besides, after watching one, I assure you, you would get hooked & wouldn't dare miss an episode.",1064448000,,707,4.407692307692308
1501360,5,B00005JLF1,"What do you get when you combine a gifted writer frustrated with coming up with new teenage angst with an actress who had a small but pivotal role in the first season of his show?  You get a hit show from J.J. Abrams featuring Jennifer Garner.
It took me a bit to warm up to this show (being the hard-nosed Femme Nikita that I am), but after catching a marathon run of the first few episodes, I was hooked.  Add to that the fact that one of the cast members is the excellent Victor Garber and another the magnificent Michael Vartan. Drama, action, exotic locations and actors who can act!
Buy this DVD, but please watch the show as well on ABC.  Even though Alias has legions of fans, new ones are always welcome.  Ignore the rumors that state the show is too *difficult* or *involved* to watch without having seen every previous episode. The writing is quick, intelligent and often self-explanatory.",1064275200,,900,4.537037037037037
1501478,5,B00005JLF1,"Not only were all the episodes in the first season completely puzzling and action-filled along with heart-pounding suspense that will make you sit at the edge of your seat biting your fingernails, but it has a lot of surprise events and drama mixed into it! It's an amazing series about a girl who is a CIA agent and still in college. She's a very talented girl and yet what did she do to get what she did? In the first episode, her fiancee already dies because she told him about her work as a CIA agent. Then she finds out her father isn't who she thought he was all along. Along with that, every other thing she thought was true turns out to be a lie. Throughout the whole season, she goes through the most dramatic things you can think of, the biggest shocks of her entire life, and crazy adventures! It's amazing. Drama...suspense...action...mystery... What more could you want?",1064188800,,883,4.559748427672956
1501479,5,B00005JLF1,"Sydney Bristow ( Jennifer Gardner) works for what she thinks is a group of the CIA known as SD-6. Then when her fiance is murdered for her telling him about it, she learns that SD-6 is not part of the CIA, and that it is actually a terrorist agency that works against the United States. Sydney then contacts the real CIA to become a double agent to help bring SD-6 down. The hard thing for Sydney is not to expose SD-6 for what it truly is to the rest of the SD-6 operatives. Everyone is still under the assumption that SD-6 is part of the CIA. Thrown into the mix is her father ( Victor Garber) who is also a double agent working for the CIA, her mission handler who gives her counter missions and who she must fight romantic feelings for Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), her SD-6 partner Marcus Dixon ( Carl Lumbly), and her two best friends who she must lie to - Will Tippin (Bradley Cooper) and Francie ( Merrin Dungey). Worst of all, there is Marvin Sloan (Ron Rifkin).  He was like a second father to Sydney; he recruited her into SD-6; he is the man who Sydney despises the most; and most importantly, he is the man who runs SD-6...
Alias is a sleek, sexy, and action packed spy thriller that is guaranteed to turn you into an instant fan. The missions themselves provide for endless action, numerous close calls, and awesome fight sequenes. I also like how the show goes all over the world with the missions. With each mission, comes a new disguise for Sydney, and she looks good no matter what she dresses in! The acting is top notch. Not only is Jennifer Gardner extremely sexy, but she also provides for great acting and fighting scenes. Victor Garber is amazing s Sydney's dad. He is cold, calculating, and always looks out for himself. Ron Rifkin is amazing as Arvin Sloan, because even though he will make you despise him, he can also be extremely charming and likeable. Michael Vartan is great as Michael Vaughn. The sexual chemistry between him and Sydney is outstanding, and watching them fight their feelings for each other is even better. I must say though, one of the funniest and underrated characters on the show is Marshall the tech guy played by Kevin Weisman. Each week we get to see him demonstrate a new invention. The way that he does it will make you laugh.
Alias is the most exciting and action packed show that is on right now. The acting and different missions both seperate Alias from the rest. I was absolutely thrilled that Alias was put out on DVD. There are some great extras, and each episode is shown without commercial interruption!",1064102400,2,2572,4.51931330472103
1501480,5,B00005JLF1,"I started watching Alias part-way through the airing of the first season and quickly became addicted.  This show truly has something for everyone--action, drama, suspense, romance, comedy, mystery.  You name it--Alias has got it!
I was ecstatic when these DVDs came out since I had never seen the pilot or a couple of the early episodes (and they truly are FABULOUS!).  I was amazed how much more I got out of even the episodes that I had seen, knowing the show so much better now.
Three of the episodes feature audio commentary.  The season finale has commentary by the entire cast, and it is hilarious!  I've watched that over and over.  They are soooo funny!  Additionally, the extras highlights include a gag reel, making of the pilot and info about the stunts.  I'm just enjoying the ease of navigation and convenience of the DVDs.
Even if you haven't gotten into Alias yet, I highly recommend these!  Basically, if you enjoy the movie ""The Bourne Identity,"" you'll enjoy Alias.  :)",1063843200,2,987,4.78698224852071
1501481,5,B00005JLF1,"I've heard many criticisms of ""Alias."" Most of them from people who never watched the show.
""It's a chick show.""
""The same guy did 'Felicity' right?""
""Hey, she's hot!""
This is definitely NOT a chick show. While Jennifer Garner is certainly the heart and soul of the show, the supporting cast deserves their bows as well. Plus, creator J.J. Abrams has made the show fun for all. It's a roller coaster ride which switches from Sydney (Garner) chatting with friends (and lying about her profession), to Bond-like stunts.
Victor Garber as Sydney's double agent father gives a stunning performance every time he hits the screen. He's given significantly more airtime as the season progresses. And justifiably so.
The groundwork here makes the concept shattering changes of the second season all the more meaningful.
Do yourself a major favor, if you've not seen this show from the beginning. Start all over again.",1063670400,5,908,5.0198675496688745
1501482,5,B00005JLF1,"I find it hard to say which is better Alias or 24. I think I might have to go with Alias. Although it has less viewers than 24 it deserves more. Here are reasons to watch this show 1.) Jennifer Garner is hot and looks good in any get up she has to wear, oh and she can act too. 2.) The show is full of non-stop twists and surprises. 3.) It has better stories and action than most summer movies.
  I never saw season one until I bought the dvd. I got into the show in the middle of Season 2 and caught my interest. After viewing Season 1 and I knowing the series a lot better now I love it.
  For those who don't know what the show is about. Jennifer Garner plays Sydney who finds out she doesn't actually work for the C.I.A when her b/f is killed because she told him what she does. She then goes to the real C.I.A and becomes a double agent. She wants out but not until she brings down the fake C.I.A. That's just a small example of  the plot, I don't want to ruin anything else for those who never saw it. As this show season will shock you and keep your attention until you have viewed the entire season.",1063670400,,1107,3.990950226244344
1501483,5,B00005JLF1,"Sydney Bristow's life is going along fine.  She's just become engaged to a wonderful guy and she's doing well in her graduate English classes.  There is her secret job, but it's not a problem working for SD-6, is it?
When she makes the mistake of telling her fiance, however, she learns the truth.  SD-6 is not part of the US Government but really deals in organized crime.  Now, she must join the CIA as a double agent to try to take down the people who have been lying to her for six years.
But life is not that simple.  She now must work closely with her father, someone she hardly knows and doesn't trust.  She must fight her attraction to her CIA handler.  And a friend is investigating a story that gets him closer to finding out her secret and putting his life in danger.
I absolutely love this show.  There are multiple stories going on all the time, but the writers keep all the balls going believably, balancing action with the stories of what's happening with her friends and giving us very real characters.  And you can't miss a moment.  All the actors are top notch, keeping what could be an over-the-top concept real.  Extra kudos must go to star Jennifer Garner who makes Sydney real as an action hero with a very vulnerable side.
When I got this set, I intended to watch just a few minutes and then dig it out when I'd have the time to really enjoy it.  Didn't happen.  Even though I'd seen every episode here twice, I got pulled right back into the story.  Of course, the cliffhangers at the end of every episode certainly help.
This set is any collectors dream.  It contains the pilot and the rest of the first season, and the episodes, presented in surround sound and widescreen, look and sound incredible.  Each episode is broken down into several chapters, mostly around commercials breaks, although they aren't listed anywhere.  There are four audio commentaries with various members of the cast and crew.  Especially fun was the commentary on the finale featuring the entire cast.  Since the commentaries were recorded as season two drew to a close, they provide some interesting insight into both seasons and helped me understand a little more about their choices this last year.  Also included are a few deleted scenes, bloopers from the season, looks at the stunts and the filming of the pilot, and more.  About my only complaint with the set was that no where did they tell you where to find these special features.  While most are on disc six, I had to put each disc in to make sure I wasn't missing anything.
I can't recommend this series highly enough.  It's highly addictive fun that you'll come back to time and time again.
Now if you'll excuse me, I think I hear the pilot calling me again.",1063152000,6,2723,4.55761316872428
1501484,5,B00005JLF1,"Alias is, simply put, one of the best shows currently on TV. Few shows (especially action series) are able to move at such a fast pace, yet retain a truly human element throughout. The mark of a good show is the ability to keep the viewer begging for more, and Alias is a master at this, with every Act and/or episode ending capable of making me groan simply because I have to wait for the conclusion.
Jennifer Garner leads a superb cast as Sydney Bristow, a double agent for the CIA who, until recently, had been working for SD6, which she thought was a secret unit of the CIA, but is really part of a shadowy organization known as the Alliance. In this first season, she has to keep her affiliation with the CIA a secret from both her friends and with her coworkers at SD6, while finding out about the details of her mother's death, and her father's role in both the CIA *and* SD6.
The DVD set is presented in widescreen, with some documentaries, a gag reel, a few deleted scenes, and a handful of commentaries (the best of which being the cast commentary for the season finale). Aided by good writing and direction and a few well-placed instances of ""stunt"" casting (Patricia Wettig, Roger Moore, and a delicious turn by Quentin Tarantino), Alias is not to be missed, and this DVD set should be a joy for fans (even if the special features are a tad too sparse).",1063152000,60,1365,4.442231075697211

From the various plot twists, up to and including the season cliffhanger, this series is well written, well edited, and well cast with Jennifer Gardner, et. al. Why more people don't watch each week is a mystery, since there are few shows that can sustain the action like ""Alias"". JJ and company continue to bring TV shows worth watching.

It contains everything you would want in a drama: great acting, action, martial arts, loveable characters (my fav is Marshall), supercool gadgets, plenty of plot twists and romantic/sexual tension.  It's one of those shows I love because after every new episode I have several friends and family members to call and talk to because many people I know watch the show, and basically every episode includes at least one major twist or development in the characters.

The producers go all out in paying attention to detail and set design, a scene set in a foreign country really does look a lot like the real thing (TV so often does not)and sets such as laboratories or other buildings also do really well.

I am so intrigued with each episode's plot and JJ Abrams the creator of the show said that the blank screen that changes the location which highlight a letter will have significance later on so if you're good in decoding it and try it it's going to be fun. I was hooked on Alias because of Jennifer Garner since I watched her performance as Elektra Natchios in Daredevil. I told my sister to look for Alias episodes and she found all of them and eversince all of our family are hooked from my dad, mom, sister and my brothers.

The stellar cast members of ""Alias"" and their respective fictional characters unfold a different spy thriller and action scenarios each week in one-hour episodes. Each episode storyline surrounds it plots with conspiracies, danger, trust, mystery, intrigue, personal pain, truth, deceptions, loyalty, suspicions, excitement, and passion. The main character, Sydney Bristow, is a strong-willed, undercover female agent who must lie to her friends about her dangerous life, while working for a secret CIA branch known as SD-6. Painfully, she uncovers the truth about SD-6 and makes the decision to become a double agent and work for the CIA receiving counter missions in order to destroy SD-6. Sydney Bristow is beautiful, intelligent and two-fisted, but as the female heroine she can hold her own in a man's world and look great while saving it. She is synonymous to a famous British spy and symbolizes that women can also make fantastic spies with many identities. The production team of writers and directors for ""Alias"" worked hard to create an imaginary program, which could explore the intelligence world of the CIA and the evil sinister SD-6, a pseudo CIA division with its own dark secret and hidden agendas. I thoroughly recommend the spy-genre ""Alias"" because ""Sometimes the Truth Hurts"", and without truth there can be no illusion.",1058572800,,1462,5.278969957081545

It does have a pretty cool style of its own (obviously borrowing from La Femme Nikita--film and TV, Run Lola Run--ok maybe just the red hair used in the first [Alias] episode, Buffy, etc.) which would grant it 3 to 4 stars, but, having watched it in HD most of the time, I must say to not even doing a widescreen transfer is rather pathetic (even Smallville will have that, and 24, which is not broadcast in HD gives the full widescreen picture too), you've got to hope they at least include the Dolby Digital soundtrack.

1501772,5,B00005JLF1,"I'm serious. I don't believe it when a lot of people haven't seen the show! Most of the tv promos for Alias are very, VERY tacky and stupid I have to say. They don't show that though Alias is high-paced action fun, it's also a compelling drama with very fine acting. Plus it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. I think season 1 is my favorite so far of all seasons. I started watching since the series premiere, and it had me then. I don't know why the Alias craze hasn't started like a wildfire. The character dynamics in this show are amazing, and the relationships seem almost real. I'd have to say this show is moving, fun, hilarious, on the edge of your seat greatness. It also combines long running themes and things such as the Rambaldi, and all the episodes sort of fit together, like a picture...and it all seems to come together at one point. I have never been as startled as I was during some of the scenes in this series. Definitely watch it!",1055289600,2,969,4.300546448087432

1501775,5,B00005JLF1,The intellectual content and fast pace with outstanding characters playing complex roles is an exquisite level spy chaser for TV.  Let it play on and on.,1053216000,2,153,4.884615384615385
1501776,5,B00005JLF1,"This show does what the most addictive shows do: it takes two genres and mixes them together, has serial story lines that take many shows to resolve so you always want to know how things are going to resolve, and it is excellently cast with supurb actors. The characters are written as complex people, no one is totally bad or good, or always smart or always dumb.
Not only is this show a spy thriller, it is also a family drama. there isn't just one spy, there's an entire rather dysfunctional family of spies! This really amps up the tension, humor, and other emotions, so much more so than the usual ""lone gunman"" type spy thriller, because everyone impacts everyone else, and they all have so much more to lose. After all, who's going to cry if James Bond dies? When he gets hurt, the only one who cares is his physician.
J.J. Abrams doesn't stop there - he also presents the show in a unique way. He isn't afraid to mess with linear time and gives us glimpses of Sydney in future peril cut in amidst a calm present, so we're left wondering how she got into trouble, why, and dreading it. We still worry about whether she'll get out of trouble, even though we know she must, because we care for her so much! He lets each show begin with a long segment before breaking in with the opening theme and credits. The pacing is really amazing. The audience never gets too comfortable, something major - or two or three or four major things - will happen each show, guaranteed.
The musical score is brilliant, increasing the tension with drumbeats that sound like doom ticking closer and closer, or the adrenaline surging our heart rate to danger levels. They also use many classical songs from the past and the best of the present to heighten poignancy and sadness.
ABC cannily offers a Website that explains the complex structure of the storyline, which includes conspiracies galore and strange artifacts from an ancient genius. This is one show that does not underestimate the intelligence of its audience and is obviously geared to give us as much fun, thrills and impact as possible.
The traditional frills of the genre are there in abundance - the spy toys which never get used twice, introduced by the lovable geek Marshall, great fight scenes, capers in exotic locations. We're also treated to great love stories, and every kind at that - forbidden love, unrequited love, betrayed love, you name it!
I am so looking forward to owning this collection, and every season at that!",1051142400,,2480,4.638636363636364

I couldn't wait to see the next episode every week(what sort of misadventures will Tony and the boys get into this week?) It was the only show I watched on television and it would've taken a miracle to pry my eyes from HBO while that show was on.
Well.....that miracle came in the form of ABC's Alias. I have never been as engulfed by any program. Ever. Needless to say, I haven't watched or cared about the Sopranos since.
The writing for the show is first rate, the acting is excellent, the action makes 'James Bond' look like 'The Bridges of Madison County', the plot is unbelievably engrossing, and the character development is brilliant. But I'm just repeating what everyone else, so eloquently, has written in previous reviews of a DVD that has sinfully not(yet) been released. I'll add just this: I'm sure that ABC has people scouring the net looking for interest in the show. Keep the reviews coming. The fact that there are 76(this will be 77) reviews of the show on Amazon without a product is unprecedented. The interest is there and I'm sure that if all Alias fans were to post reviews ABC will get wind and drop the DVD on us.
Surely, the most imaginative, exciting show on TV deserves just that. Rambaldi himself couldn't predict a better outcome.
ABC/Disney, if you are reading this: Please release the Alias first season DVD! There is so much interest in the show that it'd definitely sell out. You've produced what is simply the best television program around. So, please release this DVD. Appease the masses by spreading the Alias glee everywhere!

I also liked her Run Lola Run look with the red wig in the ads, and I was intrigued. After one episode, this show became appointment TV viewing for me (and I don't watch much TV). It is a perfect blend of subtle camp (and sometimes high camp - that episode with the rocket ship and the full red bodysuit - ??) and emotional honesty, thanks in no small part to Garner's believable groundedness in her portrayal of Sydney Bristow. Victor Garber is also addictively watchable as her shut-down father, and just when I thought the show couldn't get any better Lena Olin bumps it up a notch as her enigmatic mother. I just hope they find more for Olin to do than sit in a cell, but even in those physically limited scenes Olin is terrific. I am baffled by the lackluster ratings, and I sigh and roll my eyes when I read that people don't want to watch continuing story lines or spend the mental energy on trying to sort out the complex plot details. Forget about the details and just enjoy the ride!! Nobody can parachute to a landing, zip out of a jumpsuit exposing a cocktail dress underneath and sashay into a palace party like Jennifer Garner, and yet she keeps it from being groan-inducing by being totally committed to the character. Part of the fun of each episode is seeing what she'll be wearing, both clothes and wig, each week (loved the Russian officer!). I could go on, but I'll end by saying I will be buying the DVD the minute it comes out (hint hint). And if the show is, God forbid, cancelled - Alias movies?? Yes, I am an obsessive fan of this show, and I'm not usually like this...",1035504000,3,1872,4.305949008498583

How wrong I was!!  I spent the entire hour glued to my seat and refused to move until the end of the episode.  To this day, I have never missed an episode, and I still enjoy watching old ones.  I spent all summer recruiting people to tune into the second season, only to have them refuse, because they missed the first season.  Many more people would tune into Alias, if only they could see the first season.  This is the first show where I find myself looking forward to Sunday's.  I have found that if Alias is a rerun, my week is ruined, but if there is a new episode, the week will be fine.",1034985600,,767,4.141891891891892
1502356,5,B00005JLF1,"Alias should definitely come to DVD.  I think most major popular shows should.  If they can put a critically aclaimed, but not a huge ratings hit, show like 24 on DVD before it even has a chance to go into syndication, why not Alias, Witchblade, Tracker, Highlander, and so many others I've heard rumors about?  It would cost the companies pennies compared to what the fans would pay for DVD boxed sets, like they do the X-Files, Buffy, Friends, etc.
Alias is an excellent show, but since it can get a bit complicated, owning a boxed set would allow the viewer, me, for instance, to watch several episodes in a row, or over several nights, and the show would be even more thrilling with its action and intrigue.  Come on, guys, put this great show and others, too, on DVD real soon.",1034380800,,782,4.485915492957746

1502362,5,B00005JLF1,"ALIAS, in my opinion, was an instant classic from the moment it debuted in September 2001.  ALIAS is a spy-thriller staring Jennifer Garner as double-agent Sydney Bristow.
Agent Sydney Bristow leads a double life, triple even at times working for SD-6, an enemy spy operation working within the United States. SD-6 claims to be a black book division of the CIA to it's employees and supporters when in reality it acts in it's own interests.  Sydney Bristow, player by Garner (Felicity, Pear Harbor).  Bristow learns that her father (played by Victor Garber), who she doesn't know all that well, works within SD-6 as well.  They both work as double-agents and hand over top information about SD-6's missions to the CIA.
Sydney tries to lead a normal life as a university student and have friends but working as a double agent spy is no easy task.
Bristow at the end of Season One learns that her mother had faked her death and is still alive acting as an enemy operative in Europe.  The twists, turns and action packed episodes in this show will keep you on the edge of your seat.
You will fall in love with Alias immediately. X-Files is now off the air and you don't have to make the decision what to watch on Sundays at 9pm anymore.  ALIAS is your only choice!",1030406400,21,1261,4.582222222222223

Filled with twists and endings for each episode that left you hanging for a week , Alias is one of the best shows out there. I was very disappointed that Alias didn't get nominated for the 2002 Emmy for Best Drama but it got 11 EMMY NOMINATINS including BEST ACTRESS - JENNIFER GARNER , AND BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR - VICTOR GARBER.

This is a very well written, fast paced, and well cast show. Though it may not seem original from seeing a commercial, after you see one episode your hooked. The music while Sydney (Jennifer Garner) is on her missions is addictive, and makes you jump out of your seat cheering her on. The plot twists (Ex: When Dixon blows up the building which the US Police (or whatever) where in.).
Another thing I see that's different from other shows are the accuracy in the technology. You can actually see things like they have being invented/or already exist... and they way the explain them is done very well.
I've been very excited that my favorite TV shows are now being put onto DVD (well, some). Six Feet Under is now coming onto DVD. And now I'm excited to hear that Alias may come to DVD as well!

1502611,5,B00005JLF1,"This show is an amazing amalgamation of genera, with fantastic writing, intricate plot development, great acting, fantastic production values, and lets face it Jennifer Garner is hot.
On the surface this show might appear to be a rather generic spy show, but it is much more. Sure the show incorporates a lot of the classic spy genera cliches, like high tech gadgets, and secret missions, however this show manages to keep them fresh. The spy theme is at the core of the show, but the show is constantly meandering into or cross breeding different genera. At times it plays like Felicity, other times it feels like a story line right out of Indian Jones, or even the X-Files.
The entire cast is very strong, plus it benefits from some great guest stars, like Tarentino and Roger Moore. The performances also benefit from great dialogue. The dialogue is so good it allows you to suspend you disbelief.
The show has also struck a beautiful balance between, the self contained episode and the continuing story arc that runs through the season.
The continuing story arc is the reason to watch though. This first season alone takes its viewers through so many fantastic twist and turns.
After just one season, this show has already amassed a rather large cult following, and looks prime to explode into the mainstream much like the X-Files did years ago.
Given the nature of  of the continuing plot line that spanned over the first season, abc would be smart to release the first season on DVD before the second season airs.",1025740800,3,1519,4.775665399239544

Rather than having to constantly dig my DVD's out, I wanted to have the HD digital versions. I ASSUMED the music would be correct.

I was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO disappointed to discover that the music was replaced in the HD versions as well.

SCREW IT! I'll dig out my DVD's - and if I have to rip them illegally, I will. Because this is one show where the music MAKES the show. And the replacement's just make the scenes FLAT.",1500940800,10,787,4.376712328767123
