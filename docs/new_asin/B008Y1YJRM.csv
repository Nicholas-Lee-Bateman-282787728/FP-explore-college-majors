8532359,2,B008Y1YJRM,"Back in the 1960s I searched for this movie after its original release when one of its stars (Richard Chamberlain) became very popular as TV's ""Dr. Kildare"". I saw it in a double feature, in a second-run cinema, and ever since I have remembered it (maybe because of Chamberlain, Peter Falk or the location shooting in Puerto Rico) and longed to see it again. It is not a great movie, but one of those fast B-movies produced by Roger Corman's brother Gene, in San Juan where both seemed to enjoy shooting, probably for the low costs. But what a disappointment it was when I received this DVD issued by 20th Century-Fox Home Entertainment in its Cinema Archives series. What a mess this edition is... The image is dark, the CinemaScope format kept only for the Fox overture and main credits, and the rest of the motion picture is presented in full-screen. The full color poster has turned into an ugly black & white cover, made of cut-outs of maybe a lobby card or poster scan. Avoid this.",1347926400,9,987,4.581920903954802
