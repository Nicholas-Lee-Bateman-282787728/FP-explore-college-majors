8195311,5,B000QB4RNE,"An absolutely splendid story that involves the love of devoted children in a family that has known the death of their mother and the dismal remarriage of their father.  We experience illicit love affairs, crooked government, heart-wrenching deaths, and the corrupt byproducts of war.

There is one particular scene with the father and the young daughter who assumes the role of mother to the smaller children.  They are in the apple orchard and are discussing what lies ahead and the impact it will have on the family.  The tenderness and strengh of this father-daughter conversation could be deemed prayer-like.

The actress,Yoo Yeon Mi who played Keum-shil as a little girl won my heart so much that I have a small picture of her in my 2007 calendar. All of the child actors played their roles so beautifully.  A story is always enhanced when a decade or two passes.  The grown-up version of the children had some extraordinary twists and turns to their characters. And the physical resemblance of the little kid actors / grown up 'kid actors' was phenominal.

You will find humor, sadness, anger, failure and triumph as this story unfolds.  And finally, the original sound track that graced the entire story will be quietly applauded.",1193270400,,1237,4.93719806763285
