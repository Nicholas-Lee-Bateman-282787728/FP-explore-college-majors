I watched this Timex-sponsored program back in 1972 and taped it, what with a mono Sony cassette recorder perched near my little black and white tv. Well, here it is in full color and surprisingly good sound (I am watching the dvd transfer, which looks like a tape...) and must say it is a kicker, particularly for those of us who groove on swing and the kind of excitement a Lincoln Center Philharmonic Hall concert can create -- twenty years later I saw Sarah Vaughn there and will never forget it.

So, the video isn't oo hot, but here's Ellington and Krupa within two years of their passing and Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton. Basie band was kicking and Ella was, well, Ella. A great tribute to Louis Armstrong.

This is an 'end of an era' flick. Lets hope for more.

Go for it. Nuthin like this on tv today. Just those moonbeam groovers...",1169683200,,1000,4.601123595505618
