4137670,3,B003L77FY8,"The cover art for the fourth season has all the actors looking like they did in the first.  Perhaps an intelligent excuse could be made that SHOUT FACTORY! wanted to bookend the releases with a nostalgic pic of the group as we knew them, but I doubt the art department thought that deeply.  At the onset of releasing THIRTYSOMETHING, SHOUT FACTORY! treated it with a lot of TLC. Subsequent releases however, have suffered in quality - as is apparent with the lackluster image quality on the Season 3 DVD. The first two seasons were apparently transferred from the original film elements.  Still, one could just be grateful that the series now is complete and archived in a format that will not suffer future erosion by poor care of the original source elements. And dance by the light of the moon.",1276646400,7,797,4.678571428571429
4137671,5,B003L77FY8,"I've been waiting so long for this series to come out on DVD that, to be honest, I probably would have paid a lot more. I don't think the price is so unfair for a season's worth of hour-long episodes. The show lasted four full seasons. The 85th and final episode aired at the end of the traditional primetime television season on May 28, 1991. So you're getting 20-plus hours per season for $45. That's like getting 10 movies for $4.50 each. Not such a raw deal if you ask me.",1276473600,7,476,4.241758241758242

Great to see this series completely released on DVD! Also great to see that it is no longer an Amazon exclusive.

4137690,5,B003L77FY8,"I can't write much that hasn't already been written about the last season of - arguably the best show EVER! (Can you tell I'm a fan?) the only downside to the last season of thirtysomething is that it WAS the LAST season. It just kept getting better and having watched the DVD extras, I know what Marshall and Ed were thinking when they ended the series but.....if I ever meet one of them I am going to (kindly) let them know my disapproval and sadness! I know most fans agree.

As far as the DVD set itself, the episode ""The difference between men and women"" is missing. The menu does list the episode, but it will not play. I believe others stated this to be a problem. I think that Shout Factory has a responsibility to all who purchased the season to replace ATLEAST that particular disc. Clearly, it's a known problem.

Beyond that, I too would have liked more interviews with our old friends aka the cast. It would be a treat to have them reflect more---especially about the big moments. Like another reviewer said though, it was so many years we fans waited that I suppose we should be happy with what we received; and for the most part, I am very happy!",1425427200,,1161,4.395348837209302

This 4th season gives us the death the friends must deal with that the producers always promised would happen... though i never suspected it would be my personal favourite Gary .....  : o (  which is probably why it worked.

4137713,5,B003L77FY8,"As an avid television viewer, I dismissed 'Thirtysomething' during its initial airing on network tv.  But I connected with it immediately in the 90's during its rebroadcasts when I was becoming my own worst enemy.
What got my attention was Melanie Mayron (Melissa Steadman.)
'Thirtysomething', the final season episode 'Melissa In Wonderland' is quite simply a perfect episode.

4137715,5,B003L77FY8,"Many of you are too young to remember watching the series as it aired. I have never found this season anywhere, and despite your complaints, I loved it. You need to remember how times have changed, I thought this season was the best, and quite necessary. It is unavoidable to have lost music and other portions, MGM is now gone.
For a program to have coverage on the topics it did, in that time period was epic. They talked about AIDS, showed men in bed together, spoke about abortion. On network TV, then, this was just not allowed. I want to thank Amazon for even getting their hands on it. You just don't realize how different censorship was and copyright laws.
I absolutely loved every episode and, as a Prime member, could watch it for free. Being able to see it agin was wonderful for me. Did you know that the characters Michael and Nancy were married in real life?
Go ahead and complain about music that had to be changed or missing pats. I am so grateful to see it again. Thank you Amazon !",1400630400,,999,4.376344086021505

The DVDs arrived promptly, well-packaged. Thirtysomething is a late 80s made for TV ensemble drama about a group of bonded believable babyboomer yuppies in their 30s hence the title. The program lasted for only four years. The characters and story lines dealt with real life issues such as life, money, parents, friendship, marriage, death, idealism, searches for security, raising children, measuring success and how to survive failures as this group of believable characters spiral downward into mid-life.
Definitely worth the purchase to see these characters again.  But beware you will be watching them after you have aged 30-something-years.",1373500800,,655,5.616161616161616

4137812,5,B003L77FY8,"After viewing again after 20 years, it holds up well.  Most of the episodes are very well-written; I especially like the story lines of Melissa and Ellyn.  The under-rated Ken Olin anchors the show beautifully, with every scene pitch perfect.  I'd like to see him act again more.  The music is whimsical and memorable, a cut above most tv.  The characters are full of depth and humor, though Hope gets tiresome at the end, as does Nancy's illness.  I always enjoys the scenes with the serpentine Miles Drentel. I think the show accomplishes a realism seldom scene on tv. My guess is that the fourth (last) season was the best. I wish all of television were this good.",1357948800,,667,4.610169491525424

Michael learns of this great love that his wife had, that he knew nothing of, as the snow falls on Philadelphia.

4137858,3,B003L77FY8,"thirtysomething and Shout Factory are at very different ends of the quality spectrum, and it is very much too bad they ever had to get together. thirtysomething is an iconic classic tv series and Shout Factory is a low cost rip-off company.
The closed captions/subtitles don't work---the best you can get is a muddled jumble of letters that somewhat indicate what is being said. This is true for all four seasons.
This was not a problem for one of the episodes on disc 4, because that episode was NOT THERE. ""The Difference Between Men & Women"" was AWOL. It was supposed to be there, but the disc just ended after the three episodes.
thirtysomething was very fine entertainment, but I can't imagine after watching all four seasons why anyone would ever get married.",1312588800,3,765,4.7593984962406015

4137862,4,B003L77FY8,"I can't decide what annoys me more:  Gary's death, Gary's phony pony tails used in the flashbacks after he dies, or the fact that Shout Factory got so incredibly LAZY with this season of ""thirtysomething"" that they didn't even take the time to use the correct images for the packaging.

Van Halen's ""Brown M&Ms"" theory applies here.  Why would anyone (or company) who claims to be such a huge fan of this show (and who allegedly fought to have it produced for DVD) use images from Season 2 as the cover art for this final installment??! And this is only the beginning of the disappointment and indication that if they can't properly handle the minutia of this set, why would we be surprised that there are no commentaries for what would prove to be some of the most pivotal episodes of this show? Better planning would have been a great idea - all of the meaningful and in-depth interviews were used in the earlier season DVD releases, leaving fans scratching our heads as to why the ""extras"" on this final season are anorexic, at best.

That said, finally having all four seasons of un-butchered episodes is a long awaited dream come true for any fan of this amazing show.  We definitely see the evolution of the characters (in some cases, DEvolution - when and why did Ellyn become a baby-talking, silicone enhanced whiner when her character always had such a great mind and spine, despite her lousy choices in men?) and some truly terrific story lines. AND we get to see brilliant writer and story editor, Liberty Godshall, step away from her typewriter/computer as she appears on camera as one of the season's most memorable characters.

""thirtysomething"" is one of my Top 5 favorite tv shows of all time. I've loved it, admired it, defended it, and quoted it for the past twentysomething years. It's a must-buy for every fan but I want to smack Shout Factory for their ADD issues when it comes to the quality that has decreased with every season they've produced and released on DVD.

Tsk. Tsk.

P.S. Oh, and if you're hoping to hear ""Goin' to the Chapel"" in the episode ""A Wedding,"" stop hoping. It's been replaced with a cheesy, phony hybrid knock-off of the song, complete with really annoying vocals. I had faith that they'd figure out a way to keep the original soundtrack from the first airing, but I guess they spent their budget for music on the other seasons.",1290729600,,2373,4.660287081339713

4137877,2,B003L77FY8,"I paid the full pre-release price for this set.  I felt a little ripped off when I opened it and realized there were no features -- having enjoyed the first two seasons completely and having already noticed a drop-off of episode-specific commentary in Season 3.

The prior reviewers have nailed it.  It seems a lot of this was just recorded off whatever master there is and not digitized well.  Picture quality varies -- sometimes between cuts in the same scene!  This feels like a slapped together set.  Disc 4 cuts off before the ending of (what I assume is) the final scene of the last episode, and closing credits for that episode are therefore also omitted.

That said, the scenes cut out for syndication are returned to us here and the final episode is re-mastered beautifully (the only reason this review goes up to 2 stars).

I don't know the politics or the finances surrounding this project, but commentaries on the prior seasons' discs and opening credits on the Season 4 episodes indicate to me that Zwick and Herskovitz lost interest after 3 seasons and became involved again only for the final episode.  Maybe this has something to do with the Season 4 DVD Set quality.  Whatever the reason, this final offering is a disservice to the series and disappointment to those of us who now have a 4-Season DVD collection.",1285891200,12,1329,4.714285714285714
4137878,4,B003L77FY8,"If you loved thirtysomething, of course you need the 4th (and final) season on dvd and for the time being this is the only one available. This season had so many memorable moments (Spoilers removed: Billy in the elevator, Ellyn's wedding, Nancy's cancer resolution, that shocking thing that happened to Gary, Hope & Michael's relationship being challenged, Nancy & Elliot considering moving to California etc). It is worth buying despite some of the issues with this particular package. I note that a number of reviewers are blaming Shout! Factory for the limited extras on this release. I am wondering if we are lucky to have the season available at all.

For many years, the thirtysomething dvd release was delayed due to problems getting clearances for the music that was such an essential part of the show.  MGM, which owns the rights to thirtysomething is on the verge of bankruptcy. I noticed some changes in the ""pop"" music on the soundtrack, most notably that ""Chapel of Love"" was replaced on the wedding episode. This makes me wonder if the entire dvd had to be done ""on the cheap"" due to MGM's financial issues.  This would also explain why the package artwork is clearly taken from first-season promo materials. It is possible that if it weren't for this ""amazon exclusive,"" the 4th season might not have been released in any form whatsoever.

Creators Ed Zwick & Marshall Herskovitz taped a short introduction for Season 4 that basically rehashes material available on extras for the first season. Sadly, there are no commentaries from the actors, directors or writers.  I have a LOT of questions for Liberty Godshall who co-wrote and acted in the episode ""Advanced Beginners"" which will probably have to wait for a deluxe edition. Mel Harris directed one episode and according to IMDB, never directed anything else. I would love to hear stories about that. I also noticed some comments about Michelle Pfeiffer who was the reigning ""hottie"" in pop culture at the time-- and had recently divorced Peter Horton who played Gary. (Surely an ""inside"" joke in the days before IMDB.com.)

Extras aside, this season is such a great encapsulation of a particular period in time. There was a familiar-feeling recession that hit-- forcing DAA to cut staff and partner with a Dutch company (and throw the usually-unflappable Miles Drentell off his game.)  AIDS and AIDS-testing were new issues for heterosexual couples. One character deals with an HIV-positive test that felt like an immediate death sentence 20 years ago. Yet the stories and characters continue to feel like real people with real feelings and real challenges in relationships, in families, at work and in the greater society that are universal across time.

I love watching this show again and being reminded of who I was the first time I saw it. I was a little younger than the characters. Now, I am substantially older than thirtysomething and can see how this show influenced the way I understood my life in my 30s.  (A lot of wishing that Billy Sidel would come along, of course!)

I think it would be a really interesting show for people who are currently in their 30s to watch and compare their lives with since when it first ran, they were little kids. It is a brilliantly written, acted and directed slice of time full of the humor, sorrow, drama and melodrama of the minutia of life.",1284940800,29,3360,4.868651488616463
4137879,3,B003L77FY8,"I honestly expected more from the season four set, considering this was the final season of this epic drama.

-The quality in some of the episodes is shaky - at least on my Sony Blu Ray player. There are a fair share of pixilated scenes (like in the episode 'Distance,' for example) that almost appear as if they were transferred from a VHS master. I didn't notice this problem with the first two seasons.

-No extras was a cheap way to go out. If anything, Shout Factory should have saved a few of the extras from the first and second season and placed them on the Season Four discs. Also, they could have mustered a few commentaries. Hell, get Marshall and Edward to at least comment on the series finale! Their series introduction - albeit intriguing - was the only extra in this set and very brief at that.

-Artwork was dated on the outside box. I'm starting to think that they only had good stills from the first season. Or perhaps all of the program's publicity photos were done in season one.

Final take: Only buy if you're a die hard fan like I am, and want to complete your thirtysomething digital collection.",1284336000,21,1120,4.4754901960784315

4137883,5,B003L77FY8,I was a huge fan of thirtysomething...and I remember hoping it would be picked up on another network after the show was canceled...no such luck.

Do Michal and Hope solve their marital problems? I hope a commentary track will give me some insight into 'what might have been',1283817600,4,430,4.746666666666667
4137884,5,B003L77FY8,"I am so pleased the fourth and final season of Thirtysomething is being released.  I look forward to seeing Ellyn and Billy as a couple and Melissa and Lee together and the changes in Hope's and Michael's and Elliot's and Nancy's lives.  Some of the best episodes of Miles Drentell are on season four.  There is also an episode that features Melanie Mayron's sister, Gale in which they play sisters with Melissa visiting her sister, Jill Steadman in NYC when Melissa is offered a photography job for Vanity Fair; one of my favorites this season.  There are some emotionally powerful episodes in season four and the original music that was left intact in the episodes including Ray Charles, ""Come Rain or Come Shine.""  I hope there is commentary from Polly Draper on season four.  That would make it perfect.  Thank you so much for releasing to DVD!  :o)",1276905600,13,853,4.716216216216216
