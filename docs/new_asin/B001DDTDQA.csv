What were these dopes thinking? Rented this movie from redbox and it was a waste of one dollar. I would rather have listened to Barry Manilow than watch this waste(Had I known).

3528661,3,B001DDTDQA,"Its a film featuring The Insane Clown Posse... Dont go in expecting superb acting or a classic. Im a fan of ICP, don't get me wrong, and I even found myself hoping they win and hack up the bad guy. For what it is, its good. The camera is annoyingly wavey during the scenes in the ""Red Zone"". A few scenes can get irritating, with the camera replaying something about 10 times, and the cut from the camera just as someones head's getting splattered by a vehicle is a let down. It doesnt really live up to the ""Blood"" as it says on the cover, but its decent. Im sure theres going to be reviewing the film solely over being ICP fans... but the film gets a 3. And thats really all it is. Its worth a rental. A few laughs. And the promotion of ICP's The Calm album.",1224892800,,760,4.10738255033557

"" Don't Get Me Wrong, I Like Jason Statham !""
Butt, This is an awesome `car wars' type film like the Original `Death Race' with Carradine & Stallone.
The cast (which we can discuss later),writers and director DID there jobs amazingly.
The cars were great and by Sota FX, They  need to do those cars shows or go to the Las Vegas resort with Automobile Museum. There is a Scarface Car, Lesbo Web ? sports car, GI Joe-ish Jeep, and The ICP Clown Screamer...with Product Placement speakers.
  The plot, YES, The plot moves along...You have a bad guy who isn't all bad and HEROES who love to kill anyone in their way.
Cast: Insane Clown Posse are very likable in a PENNYWISE from ""IT"" kind of way, Again setting Clowndom back aways .
  Raven from WWE does a journeyman job as bad guy, Work more sir.
Dustin Fitzsimmons (guy with video camera) has the most to do  besides ICP and his character goes thru some `bad ju-ju'.
Robert Pike Daniel as governor is quite a character, Not changing any views in a election year.
 Damien Puckler (metal man) In a suit by Makeup Guru Joe Castro. Damien might have one  of the BEST non-speaking roles, YOU just plain rock-Sir !Kind of a riff on Vernon Wells Mohawked Baddy  from `Mad Max'.
  Stephen Blackehart (tv host) was one of my first interviews with my old site and Is finally getting the  meaty roles with Theasylum and Full Moon.
  Minor( but favorable) mention goes to :
  Jason Ellefson- He was great as a Scarface "" Tony Montana"" issued mess of a driver, This is a minor accolade, Because YOU WERE SO MEAN in ""Street Racer"" !
  ...  Also Ken Hall and his fabricators and Chris Watson for your editing prowess on trailer.",1221696000,3,1688,4.511551155115511

3528665,5,B001DDTDQA,"Okay i know some of you may be asking why did you give this a 5* rating? Three Words Insane Clown Posse.
If ICP wasn't in it i would have never seen it. But nonetheless ICP can make anything work naturally they are super funny. Why? Cuz they are clowns you dorks. They knew going in to this that the movie was going to be horrible so they had fun with it.

J and Shagz ad lib alot of their lines according to the director in the commentary. So of course you're going to have mad funny lines. If you have ever heard their CDs or seen their other cinematic endeavors you will know that these dudes can make anything entertaining. With the buckets of blood and cheap FX this movie is fun to watch with a homie so that you can cap on all the unrealities of this masterpiece.

There is one scene where ICP is driving a death machine Ice cream truck and they run over a guy and blood sprays everywhere, All over the windshield and the clowns themselves in fact theres so much blood they have the Wipers on to see where they are going. Hilarious! Who bout a half cyborg half strong man bent on full metal rape? Not as bad as it sounds and throw in some pro Wrestling actors like Raven who's goal is to spill deadly chemicals into the water supply and you have a very entertaining action flick.

Even though they are suppose to be in a race they don't get too far. Different teams of killers in killer cars are just in a competition to kill the scum run city's ruthless thugs. The Severed head Gang, ICP, Team VaginaMyte, and Team Homeland Securtiy duke it out with each other and The Reaper's foot soldiers.

Overall this film is guarranteed to make you laugh and will definantly have you talking about it for many days but not becuz its on the level of Kubrick or Spielburg but becuz its one of the worst movies ever put to film. So enjoy.",1365206400,2,1833,4.243553008595988
3528666,3,B001DDTDQA,So this movie features Insane Clown Possie (ICP) and has some of there best music in it. But the plot kinda sucks and they way the movie structures also serves no purpose then to take away from the movie.,1361232000,,204,4.256410256410256
3528667,1,B001DDTDQA,"this movie was horrible the only good thing was the background music (and yes its manly ICP and/or Psychopathic Records related type of music),please don't waste your money on this piece of low budget garbage movie just watch it on Netflix like i did!!!

by the way i am an ICP/Psychopathic Records fan but come on this was straight up garbage only a true loyal ""ICP4LIFE "" fan (I.E juggalo and/or juggalette) would like & buy this junk movie!!!",1341187200,,445,4.632911392405063
3528668,1,B001DDTDQA,"This movie plays like a movie that was created to star ICP, yet they fall flat in the performance either because they cannot act or, as it appears, the did not want to be there. This movie should be an action packed fast paced sci-fi, instead it is slow, tedious, weakly sci-fi. The cross-country race, an homage to the recent blockbuster Death Race and the original Death Race movies, takes a  slow motion approach to the race. While two of the cars appear to have the potential for speed the ""ice-cream"" truck driven by ICP appears to have the top end speed of a golf cart.

In a potentially interesting twist to the sci-fi race genre, the film makers have inserted news feeds ala reality TV which could satirize the blurring of news and entertainment. Unfortunately, because of the slow race speed, poor blocking of the action scenes, and painfully monosyllabic dialogue, not much is needs recapping. This mass media angle just becomes filler to pad out the 85 minute length of the movie.

Nothing about this movie is well executed. ICP seems to have trouble portraying themselves, acting more like ICP imitator instead of the actual ICP.  Sadly, they may give the best performances. The settings are poorly piked to be a dystopic future. The sound editing is poorly equalized. The soundtrack is rehashed and repeated to the detriment of the film. The action is slow and poorly executed. The cast of extras is small and they almost never run away from their predictable deaths.

Typically I am a fan of the mockbuster films from Asylum Films. I appreciate the low budget choices that are often needed to propel their tongue and cheek versions of blockbusters straight to video store shelves. At times they can be creative with their use of story and try to work within their own limits to watch a movie that is watchable at least once. That is not the case in Death Racers. This has the poor acting of Transmorphers without the story of Snakes of a Train. In this day and age of digital movie making weekend high school projects often look better than this film.",1310083200,,2065,4.677685950413223
3528669,3,B001DDTDQA,"CONSIDERING IT WAS an ASYLUM production it it one of their 5 star productions. The acting was still poor. The blood scenes were overdone and silly. And if you watch it for the ""rape scene"" the box claims it has, it would be a let down as the girl never really gets raped, just tied down and threatened from behind. The music background was hip-hop. The plot of the movie attempted to combine ""Death Race 2000"" with ""Escape from New York City"" with ""Groove Tube"" commentary. I believe this may be the best we can ever expect from Asylum. The title is misleading as there is not any actual racing as one might expect, rather the racers pretty much work together. And if you are an Insane Clown Posse fan, good news: They survive the whole movie, for what it is worth.",1275696000,4,765,4.394366197183099
3528670,5,B001DDTDQA,I found this dvd to be some what intertaining. There were a few dry humor spots but in all I got alot of hearty belly laughs out of it! Worth the buy.,1271635200,,150,3.71875
3528671,3,B001DDTDQA,"For starters this movie is poorly filmed and edited.  If you're excited about the gory scenes, don't be.  They only show something happening about 3 times during the movie otherwise they just turn the camera away and you are forced to use your imagination.  The story is pretty interesting and would be better if some more money had been put into it.  You constantly have to turn the volume up and down to understand what people are saying especially during scenes in the mayor's office.  I also noticed that a number of the driving scenes of hitting people and running them over were the same exact frames!  I was like, is this deja vu or are they really just plugging the same scenes back in later in the movie.  So I rewound and found that they were certainly the same frame.

Bottom line: If you're looking for a quality movie this definitely is not one.  If you want a movie that you can watch and laugh at while you get drunk or something then go nuts.  It's only 5 bucks.",1269907200,,978,4.383333333333334
3528672,5,B001DDTDQA,I have been tryin to find this movie everywhere and its always been ove $20 so i was excited when i found it.  Came in good time and worked and did not skip.  The dvd case did have a chunk missing from the bottom of it but I did not care.  I was just excited to watch it!,1267056000,,271,3.6379310344827585
3528673,1,B001DDTDQA,"For a laugh I rented this movie because it featured the Insane Clown Posse. I figured there would at least be a few laughs to get out of it. With a name like ""Death Racers"" you know it's going to be anything but cinematic gold. However I couldn't even bare to sit through the first 10 minutes of this film. I found myself skipping through chapters, looking for anything even sorta worth seeing. Nothing.

The acting by everyone in this film is horrible. The dialog scenes are full of awkward silences, as if people are either trying to remember their lines. That or whoever wrote the script wanted a lot of silence among a group of people while they stared at each other, posing (or in the case of Shaggy 2 Dope, bouncing around and throwing his hands in peoples faces).

The story itself leaves a lot to be desired. It's what I'd consider trailer park quality science fiction. A bunch of ""badasses"" (gangsters, hookers and independent rappers) go driving their ridiculous vehicles around a dusty set (over filtered to the point you can't stand staring at the gritty sepia screen), racking up points for killing people (awful special effects - fake body parts that spurt a gush of blood after being tapped by a meat cleaver) in search of some criminal who wants to poison the drinking water. If they kill him, they're granted freedom. The gangsters, ex-soldiers and hooker apparently have killed people so it makes sense they'd be in prison... BUT in this futuristic dirt world ICP are in prison because their music is violent.

The Insane Clown Posse end up being the main draw for this film, essentially the main characters, and while they can usually pull a few smiles or a chuckle when on-screen, they couldn't pull it off in this abomination. I'm sure many fans of the clowns will disagree in a fit of loyal rage but remember, I'm a fan and them being in it was the reason I even rented the damn thing. It's obviously a creation of friends of fans of the group, but leaves a lot to be desired, even for the most hardcore fans of their music.

Which reminds me, the entire soundtrack is a non-stop mix of clips from ICP songs. They're all horribly misplaced, they re-use the same songs over and over, and honestly the music didn't belong where they placed it and it added nothing. (If you've seen ICP's film ""Big Money Hustlas"", it was pretty much the same thing only it was the actual song instead of instrumentals.)

3528675,5,B001DDTDQA,"This is a movie similair to Death Race with Jason Straham but not quite.

If you don't already know, J and Shaggy are two wicked clowns from a psycho killin, hatchet swingin rap group called Insane Clown Posse. They also made their own movie called Big Money Hustlas, which I think is a great movie and everyone should check it out if you like this movie. This movie has some sweet body exploding, car crashing, just plain old messed up death scenes with sum pretty alright special effects for how low budget of a movie it is.

3528676,4,B001DDTDQA,"Very good, enjoyed it very much. I wish their was a little more special features but I am happy with what they did give. All in all any Juggalo or Juggalette would love this movie. MMFWCL.",1250208000,,188,4.25
3528677,1,B001DDTDQA,"If you are like me and wanted to check this out 'cause you thought it might be something like Death Race or Death Race 2000, then think again. What I predict happened here is Asylum Studios either saw the script for Death Race being handed around when it was in those stages and wanted to do it, but did not have the funding to make such a movie, or they found a script of it online and tried to out do it in there own cheesy little take on the idea.

It starts off much like that of Death Race; being that, it's the future, and the USA seems to have collapsed. But then this one dibbles into to some story about Raven wanting to poison the US Water Supply, so the president or Governor or whatever the heck he was bores you to death with a plot to kill Raven by sending in 4 teams to collect his head in what they call the Red Zone.

The rest of the movie is mindless killing for points, trying to survive and get to Raven before he poisons America. And believe me, it sounds more interesting then it really is.

Now, how on Earth can you take a movie where you use your cars to run down pedestrians for points and screw it up? Well, if you watch this movie, you will see how. There is nothing scary, funny, or even entertaining then two hacks in clown make-up running down people who can't get out of the way in time while driving a convertible ice-cream truck at 5 miles an hour. Had they been running over zombies after there brains, you might swallow it, but why drive so slowly in a film like this?

As a matter of fact, I don't think any of the cars in this film do much more then 10 miles an hour for something that is supposed to be a race. To give you an idea of the action packed kills and thrills of this movie, try to imagine that scene in Austin Powers where he runs over the henchmen in the steam roller.... thats what all the vehicle kills in this film are like.

The title of the movie does not belong, when driving scenes last no longer then 10 mins throughout the film. And then the 4 cars they use, what a joke... a convertible with spray painted flames and a plastic mini gun on the side, a 1940's army jeep equipped with two cardboard guns on the front, the stupid ICP van, and a sports car that I guess the idea was to try and rip off the chicks from Cannonball Run II but fail miserably.

It's not that the effects or editing or film quality is all that bad, but the acting is atrocious, even for a b-grade action movie.
The character development it pointless, not to mention how many pointless scenes are thrown in between Raven and his medicine man, the president or whoever and his men huddled into a small box, and ICP trying to be cool and funny, but only coming off as annoying and dumb.

I guess ICP thought they would look so cool slicing away at the camera in slow motion with knives and machetes and having fake blood squirt in there eyes, then smile like ""it's all good, homie"" but man, what a joke they are to see trying to be cool, let alone trying to act.

There is so many useless scenes put in as well that only add to the confusion of what the heck is going on in the film, and it just slows everything down. So many useless character development plots thrown in that are not needed, and again, so many useless scenes forced in just to make the movie longer... honestly, take this movie, cut it up, and make it the 20 minute short film it is without the most useless *&^%$ forced in to stretch it out.

And I really want to lay into ICP a bit more for the fact that I will never get the time back I wasted watching them in this. So they should be let known, that there acting in this was that bad, it made there WCW stints look fabulous... and, that is saying A LOT!

They have a song in this movie called F The World... nah, the world is ok, just F ICP and there Mexican sleazeball of a co-star who you can not wait to be offed in the movie... I don't wanna throw any spoilers out there for those stupid enough to want to see this garbage, but his death at 2 miles an hour is a real disappointment.

So, hopefully you have gotten the point that I really am slamming this movie for what it is... but can I say anything good about the movie? Well, as I said before, the quality isn't that bad, and the editing is ok, it's the acting that let's it all down. I suppose if you are into ICP music or rap music, you will enjoy the soundtrack. But for god sakes people, don't praise this crap just because your an ICP fan. You know damn well they can not act and this movie is a joke.

Some reviews I saw other places said if you liked Death Race, Death Race 2000, The Running Man or Grand Theft Auto you would love this movie... *COUGH* *VOMIT* NO YOU WILL NOT, I loved all those movies and still hated this one.

And I don't know about the American cover of the DVD, but the Australian one says, ""WWE's Raven"" as the star of the movie .... Raven hasn't been in the WWE for 100 years, so you know if there trying hard to make you think he is still in the WWE, you know they are REALLY trying to use any illusions they possibly can to get your attention to see this god awfull film.

I won't give it the perfect 1 star. I will give it 1 and a half stars, and extra half star for the name of the female team in this, and some of the smart Alec comments they make through the film, that was about the only thing worthy of this film... and before you say it, no I like bigger girls, So I really do mean there dialog, not there looks.

Do yourself a favor, if you really are curious to see this, don't pay for it, best bet, wait till it's on free TV at like 1am sometime.",1238198400,,5601,4.074477747502271

8292873,1,B001DDTDQA,"Even as a rip off of Death Race, this movie doesn't satisfy. The tone is off - it dips into black comedy at times (a la the original Robocop), when it needed to be a black campy comedy all the way through. Violent J turns in a decent performance, Shaggy 2 Dope seems 2 Drunk onscreen to do more than hatchet murdering some unfortunates (he is much better in BMH and BMR). I have seen several other Asylum movies, I know the deal with what they are about, but this could have been much more entertaining if done more over the top and silly with the same budget.",1466467200,,560,4.194444444444445
