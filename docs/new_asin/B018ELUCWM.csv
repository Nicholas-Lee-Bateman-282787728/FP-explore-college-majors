7545198,5,B018ELUCWM,"I'm definitely biased, but I can honestly say this is the best damned Bigfoot film I've ever seen!",1454976000,,98,4.5
7545199,5,B018ELUCWM,This movie was very well written with a captavating story line and excellent acting. The music in the movie was an added bonus to an already stellar movie. We loved Stomping Ground and we highly recommend it.,1453507200,6,208,4.648648648648648
7545200,5,B018ELUCWM,"I saw this movie at a release in Dayton, Ohio and it was great!  The script is well-written and the characters are interesting to the plot line.  Very well made!",1453420800,5,161,4.333333333333333
7545201,5,B018ELUCWM,Saw this at a Film festival in Wilmington NC. It was the most real looking bigfoot I have ever seen. Music and scenery were top notch. The girl who played Annie was amazing!,1453420800,3,173,4.2727272727272725
7545222,2,B018ELUCWM,"Even for a low budget indie movie about Bigfoot, it was very below expectations. The characters dialogue is almost entirely bickering or awkward flirting, and the ""Special Effects"" were pretty lousy execution of fake blood capsules and a deeply discounted dollar store brand Chewbacca costume. The banjo music was ok.",1509667200,,317,5.36
7545223,4,B018ELUCWM,"Actually, it was an enjoyable Bigfoot flick.  There is the conflict between rival lovers and the comedy of a friend.  Ultimately, there is a Bigfoot that has a love interest in one of the characters.",1502323200,2,199,4.6571428571428575
7545224,4,B018ELUCWM,Entertaining & well shot for an independent film!! If u don't mind a slower paced movie (like most bigfoot movies) I think you likely will enjoy this 1.  Nothing over the top but some decent gore & the bigfoots late arrival is worth the wait!!,1501372800,,243,4.4
7545225,4,B018ELUCWM,"The acting is almost always the worst thing about bigfoot movies, but this film is the exception.  It's actually a good film that just happens to feature bigfoot.  I wouldn't call this a horror movie, I'm actually not sure what genre it falls under, but it's worth your time in my opinion.",1499817600,3,289,4.538461538461538
7545226,4,B018ELUCWM,"This was actually a pretty good movie, better than I expected.",1498089600,,62,4.7272727272727275
7545227,3,B018ELUCWM,"It's a pretty good movie until the last 12 minutes or so and then it's totally ridiculous; hence, the comedy tag.
The big city guy wins out which makes this movie too farcical, but the beginning and tension are good.
Why do people have to ruin things. I could write a much better ending as could most anybody else.
I guess it is still worth watching. The ending is just too cringe-inducing for words.",1496016000,,400,4.418918918918919
7545228,5,B018ELUCWM,"Modest beginnings morph into a solid entertaining, dynamic movie because of excellent dialogue and very believable characters! A very well done piece of movie making!",1489708800,2,166,5.68
7545229,1,B018ELUCWM,Awful in every way.,1489536000,,19,4.0

7545231,1,B018ELUCWM,Hate it hute even give 1 star it's less,1486425600,,39,3.4444444444444446
7545252,3,B018ELUCWM,Not bad for a B Movie.,1485734400,,22,2.8333333333333335
7545253,3,B018ELUCWM,"it was ok, kinda drugged out",1484438400,,28,3.8333333333333335
7545254,5,B018ELUCWM,Crazy good. Well worth adding to any collection.,1483660800,,48,5.125
7545255,3,B018ELUCWM,"Needs more Bigfoot, less romantic tension.  Too much stereotyping of city boy vs country boy.  Scenery and locations are good, so is the mountain music.",1483056000,,152,5.04
7545256,2,B018ELUCWM,Ok not the best,1482883200,,15,3.0
7545257,5,B018ELUCWM,Hilariously Funny!,1482019200,,18,8.5
7545258,1,B018ELUCWM,A long boring love story with a little hokey bigfoot stuff at the end.,1481932800,,70,4.071428571428571

7545261,3,B018ELUCWM,"it was blah...very unmemorable, except for the main characters, I remember them being very annoying and cliche.",1477872000,,111,5.588235294117647
7545272,5,B018ELUCWM,Very good and funny,1476576000,,19,4.0
7545273,2,B018ELUCWM,"I don't know anything about this, but it seems like it was made by some college kids to fulfill a requirement for a course on film making. The woods they are walking around in are not intimidating, not expansive or wild enough to harbor a bigfoot. There's really no reason to waste time watching this movie.",1476403200,,307,4.5
7545274,1,B018ELUCWM,"No, it was really stupid",1475625600,,24,4.0
7545275,1,B018ELUCWM,"Not sure what this is, but it's sure not a comedy.  Frankly, it's not really much of a horror or suspense story, either.  Boyfriend and ex-boyfriend fight over girl as they wander around the woods.",1474761600,3,197,4.6
7545276,3,B018ELUCWM,Not the worst movie at 2 am when you can't sleep and are bored.  Clearly low budget.,1473984000,,84,3.9411764705882355
7545277,5,B018ELUCWM,Compared to some of the other ones I've seen on here this was actually good. Love Bigfoot and alien movies,1473465600,,106,4.35
7545278,4,B018ELUCWM,Nice B movie,1473292800,,12,3.3333333333333335
7545279,1,B018ELUCWM,I didn't like the bigfoot movie.,1472342400,,32,4.5
7545280,1,B018ELUCWM,Horrible....no other explanation. The one star is a gift.,1470787200,,57,5.444444444444445
7545281,3,B018ELUCWM,Enjoyed the movie.  The story was set in familiar territory in the Uwharrie Mountains.  I thought the story line and acting were ok.,1470009600,,132,4.695652173913044
7545282,3,B018ELUCWM,Enjoyed it!,1469318400,,11,5.0
7545283,1,B018ELUCWM,I really did not like this film because the acting was really bad and slow moving. It was awkward and laughable.,1467590400,,112,4.380952380952381
7545284,2,B018ELUCWM,Good for allow budget film.  Not terrible.,1467417600,,42,5.0
7545285,3,B018ELUCWM,Unbelievably awful,1467331200,,18,8.5
7545286,1,B018ELUCWM,"The acting is fine and the production quality is pretty high, but the writing and direction are horrid. This movie is neither a horror or a comedy. No laughs, no scares. Don't waste your time.",1467072000,,192,4.514285714285714
7545287,4,B018ELUCWM,"Interesting! Very organic and natural feel to the scenes, dialogue, and performances.",1466726400,,85,6.166666666666667
7545288,5,B018ELUCWM,Very Good Bigfoot Movie. The Bigfoot for once looked like a real Bigfoot,1465430400,,72,4.615384615384615
7545289,2,B018ELUCWM,Not memorable. Can't remember even the ending and watched it 2 nights ago.,1465430400,,74,4.769230769230769
7545290,5,B018ELUCWM,good story,1465344000,,10,4.5
7545291,1,B018ELUCWM,Very slow.......nothing going on forever.  This is not a comedy as much as it is a joke.  The musicians at the party are the very best part of this movie the rest is just bad.  The acting is not really as bad as it could have been but the poor kids had no direction or script to work with.,1465084800,2,289,3.864406779661017
7545302,5,B018ELUCWM,Good movie!,1464998400,,11,5.0
7545303,1,B018ELUCWM,Same old Bad !,1464566400,,14,2.75
7545304,5,B018ELUCWM,"I really dug this movie. Great cinematography, music, actors, story, and locations. People have knocked the bigfoot costume but it's better than most other b-movies. This is the best bigfoot movie i've seen in years and I highly recommend it. It's also not as expensive as some of the trash out there. Great stuff.",1463443200,,314,4.833333333333333
7545305,4,B018ELUCWM,"Stomping Ground is a lot of fun if you appreciate independent horror. Granted, the movie offers a lot of drama and humor instead of straight-up horror during its run-time. And, its scary elements are much more about the suspense from the unknown and unseen than they are about overt, graphic gore and weird sights. However, small-budget fllm-makers must sometimes take such an approach, and Stomping Ground takes such an approach excellently. I loved watching Stomping Ground during its entire run-time. The characters were engaging. The local color, music, and setting were interesting. I appreciate most Bigfoot movies (Six Million Dollar Man episodes started a fascination). Watch SG buzzed. You'll like it.",1461283200,7,710,5.405405405405405
7545306,1,B018ELUCWM,High School acting and script.,1459296000,,30,5.2
7545307,3,B018ELUCWM,This is more of a love story to a degree with Bigfoot undertones. I wanted to really like this movie more but it's to much of a slow burn for my taste. Funny moments at times and the Bigfoot creature was designed extremely well.,1459209600,7,228,4.204545454545454
7545308,3,B018ELUCWM,"The ""Bigfoot"" was kinda funny, literally a guy in a costume!",1459209600,,60,4.545454545454546
7545309,1,B018ELUCWM,Wow...very B rated movie.,1459209600,,25,5.5
7545310,4,B018ELUCWM,"Great cast and acting. Wasnt as full of jump scenes as I would have liked, but it is more of a character piece than a horror film. Worth checking out if you like Big Foot films!",1459209600,2,177,3.9444444444444446
7545311,2,B018ELUCWM,"One star for the acting, which wasn't terrible, and one for the scenery. The movie was more about a cock fight over a girl than Bigfoot.",1459209600,,136,4.269230769230769
7545322,5,B018ELUCWM,this is not a hollywood blockbuster. it's well-made movie.,1459036800,2,58,5.555555555555555
7545323,5,B018ELUCWM,"This is a movie that may not have a big budget or ""Hollywood big shot actors*"" but just works really well. It doesn't come off as cheap, just as a really good movie, created by talented people. The writing, directing, acting, all great. A couple million in studio magic production and this would be heralded as the best horror movies to hit theaters this year. Suspenseful unique and most of all, not some BS cop out a film student would make. Keep it up boys!

*exception is Daniel Day lewis in an uncredited performance as Big Foot",1458950400,,533,4.494845360824742
7545324,1,B018ELUCWM,"Horrible movie.  Dumb plot, worse acting, and you can't call it directing because nobody would direct that bad.",1458864000,,111,5.166666666666667
7545325,1,B018ELUCWM,"The ""actors"" and director and whoever wrote this kee-rap should be stomped into the ground.  The embodiment of talentless amateurism. Lots of terrible dialogue leading to five minutes of ""Bigfoot.""  Every hillbilly cliche known to humanity.",1458604800,,240,5.638888888888889
7545326,2,B018ELUCWM,"Did not care for it. Not sure what it was. The lead was likable enough, but the rest were trying a bit too hard. Not funny, not scary, just kinda blah. Nice seeing one of The Evil Dead ladies in a bit role.",1458432000,,206,3.813953488372093
7545327,1,B018ELUCWM,dreadfully boring movie about dreadfully boring people doing nothing. How did this get in any festivals?,1458172800,,104,5.5625
7545328,4,B018ELUCWM,"Much better than I anticipated.  Good character development and ""human conflict"" between the characters.  Movie both identiified sterotypes but then largely avoided the cliches.  Yes, there are some plot holes and the ending was a bit unsatisfying (mostly underdeveoped themes, as if they makers decided they had run out of time so run the credits) but still very much worth the watch.",1458086400,4,385,5.17741935483871
7545329,4,B018ELUCWM,Worth watching.,1458086400,,15,7.0

7545331,3,B018ELUCWM,Not bad. Only see creature at end with no true explanation.,1458000000,,59,4.454545454545454
7545349,1,B018ELUCWM,This movie is so stupid.  Don't waste your time.,1457827200,,48,4.333333333333333
7545350,5,B018ELUCWM,"This is the best Bigfoot I've ever seen. It's a rare feat to blend comedy with horror so well, and this movie manages to do just that.",1457827200,2,134,4.0
7545351,4,B018ELUCWM,An enjoyable well written and played movie that avoids negative stereotyping of southern country and northern city characters.,1457827200,6,126,6.055555555555555
7545352,3,B018ELUCWM,I guess you have to be a Bigfoot fan; I thought it was just OK.,1457740800,,63,3.2666666666666666
7545353,5,B018ELUCWM,I really liked this movie.  Not the best I've ever seen but I gave it 5 stars only because it was just so fun!,1457740800,2,110,3.5833333333333335
7545354,5,B018ELUCWM,Extremely impressed with this movie with the way it was shot and the awesome acting!,1457740800,2,84,4.666666666666667
7545355,5,B018ELUCWM,"Surprisingly well made, written, edited low budget film. This gem of the Uwharrire forest has some great up and coming actors, musicians, performers that you'll want to follow the careers of. Look up this one on imdb, you've probably seen many of the cast in TV, film and commercials.

 And then there's me but don't let that deter you from seeing this one. It turned out great. So, buy it, rent it, give it as gifts to your big foot loving friends, they'll thank you for it.

7545357,5,B018ELUCWM,Well acted and directed for a small budget movie. The music and scenery are both so beautiful and I was surprised how funny it was! Definitely worth a look.,1457395200,2,156,4.413793103448276
7545358,4,B018ELUCWM,"I really liked this movie. There isn't as much action/suspense as I expected, it's more like that movie ""Straw Dogs"" , a lot of tension between the current boyfriend and the ex-boyfriend over the girl, but very well acted for an indie. I took a gamble and bought it blind because I love everything about Bigfoot, and I don't regret it. It's worth a watch, check it out.",1457395200,14,369,4.4411764705882355
8742116,3,B018ELUCWM,"This movie was super slow and nothing exciting happened at all until the end when we finally get to see the Bigfoot creature, which was done well. The acting was pretty good for a low budget film. I did find it to be to much of a lovey dovey type film though with not nearly enough of the Bigfoot creature.",1534982400,,306,4.116666666666666

8742119,5,B018ELUCWM,Pretty good movie. Monster looked cool too. Actors/Actresses were great despite the low budget film. Music was very different but went with the movie.,1529712000,,150,5.291666666666667

8742121,5,B018ELUCWM,"This was an overall a fun movie with good acting and likable characters. If you like this genre, you'll probably enjoy this movie. I really enjoyed the unexpectedly excellent music throughout it as well (I even sat through all the credits just to hear the whole song at the end of the film!). Well done.  :)",1529280000,,307,4.482142857142857

The bigfoot suit looked good for the short amount of time we got to see it. I didn't really think the pace was too slow as others have said, but it certainly isn't an action packed movie by any means. To me it kind of plays like a drama with bigfoot mixed in.",1525046400,2,366,4.169014084507042
