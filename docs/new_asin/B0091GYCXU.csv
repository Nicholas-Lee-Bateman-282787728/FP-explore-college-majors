8534165,5,B0091GYCXU,"This is actually a follow up to a film from 1996 called `Jagarna' and this was originally called `Jagarna 2', but you don't have to see the first one to be able to follow this but it will help contextualise everything. It stars Rolf Lassgard as Detective Eric Backstrom, he is called to his familial town to investigate a suspected murder after a girl goes missing in very suspicious circumstances. The only suspect is the town's local human detritus and the cops hate him and are always trying to fix him up for crimes. So the objectivity of Stockholm CID is what they are looking for - enter Detective Backstrom.

Once Eric starts to do his investigation it soon appears that the local cops are probably not as dogged as he would like and things just do not add up on the evidence front. Soon he is at loggerheads with most of the police and some of the locals as he leaves no stone unturned to get to the truth and having to face up to the ghosts from the past and what he has both done and failed to do.

This is a great film, the cinematography is brilliant and the Swedish country side is amazing. A word to animal lovers there are hunting scenes in this and animal butchery which is completely real. Peter Stormare playing bad cop Torsten is actually brilliant and I discovered he was in `The Big Lebowski', so watch out for him. But the real star is Rolf Lassgard who pulls the whole thing along and balances the good cop routine with enough humanity to flesh out the character. There is a wide interest in Nordic films at the moment and if they keep making them like this then that interest is not going to wane any time soon.",1451088000,6,1635,4.357377049180328
