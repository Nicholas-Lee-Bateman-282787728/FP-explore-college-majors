Subtitles in portugues, spanish , english, good quality sound , color, video. Definitly recomend it.",1359936000,,377,5.732142857142857

3725964,5,B001O2HUO2,"I came across the series COMPLETELY by accident through HBO on demand.  I woke up at 2am one night and decided to give it a shot.  I was hooked like an addict from the first episode and couldn't wait to see more.  I called out of work the next day and continued to watch every available episode on demand until there were no more left.  It is one of the best series I have ever seen in my life and the suspense never dies down.  The script is genius, the sets are flawless, and casting couldn't have been more perfect.  The destruction of a perfect woman's perfect life and her progressive deterioration becoming a woman she'd never thought she'd be completely captivated me.  I fell in love with the characters as if they were my friends or sisters, wishing there was something I could do to help them.  It felt so real that it provokes those emotions out of you every step of the way.  The acting was great from top to bottom but stand out performances have to go to Cecilia Suarez and Ana De La Reguera because they both had me at hello.  I am watching Season 2 now and its just as great as the last.  I wait impatiently every week for the new episodes to arrive on demand with subtitles.  If you come across the opportunity to see this A-list show, don't miss out on it.",1317859200,5,1274,4.2625
3725965,5,B001O2HUO2,"This is an example of what talent lies south of the US border. With proper funding and artistic freedom these folks have put together a stellar TV series, period, in any language. If you are like me and just now discovering Spanish language drama and this seems like interesting subject matter give it a try, I am anxiously awaiting DVD release of season two and very glad there will be a third season.

In typical HBO fashion, they pick talented production teams and let em have enough room to breath!",1316995200,4,502,4.5777777777777775
3725966,5,B001O2HUO2,"True to HBO standards, this series is filled with terrific dialogue, intruiging plots,and a well deserved look at the private  prison system in latin-america. It asks questions about the justice system in Mexico as well as the price that injustice,corruption and trafficantes are costing the modern Mexican and their way of life. And the swift arrival  in a week) make me very happy.",1316736000,3,383,5.063492063492063
3725967,5,B001O2HUO2,"I recently came across the first season of this series and thought ""Female Mexican OZ... Sounds interesting.""  That was what led me to watch the first episode.  What led me to keep watching was the incredible cast, the polished cinematography and editing, and the great WRITING.  In my opinion great writing and interesting characters played by talented actors is what makes any television series memorable.  This series has it in spades.  Characters go on personal journeys that change them dramatically during the course of the season.

That said, the series is every bit as harsh as you would expect from a story set in a prison. It is not for the squeamish.  I am a fan of intensity in my entertainment (action, horror, etc.) however this is the first show in a long time that has caused me to flinch and turn away... and that's a good thing because my reaction was in response to the situation and character rather than gore.

I find myself eagerly, gleefully looking forward to watching season two, and I hear season 3 is already in the works.  If you have any interest in bold, hard-edged, emotionally gripping entertainment (or you're a fan of HBO original content) give this one a try.",1315440000,11,1194,4.729468599033816
3725968,4,B001O2HUO2,"Excellent spanish series, one of the best I have seen done in the last 5 years. The acting is just spectacular. The stories are amazing, and I am pretty sure most of them came out of real life. It is a sad but real encounter with society in Mexico City, very famous for corruption, drugs, gangs, etc, but it may also be the story of any other third world country.",1314316800,,363,4.2

Which is a shame, since all the people I've mentioned this show to or even had to let them borrow my DVD set has fallen in Love with this captivating, intense, and brutally honest series.
