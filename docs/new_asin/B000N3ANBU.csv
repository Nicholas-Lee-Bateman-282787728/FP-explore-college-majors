8174369,4,B000N3ANBU,"Guide Frank O'Reilly gives an excellent narrative of a relatively simple and small battlefield. This tour has very little walking around or panning around to see the people's heads right in front of the camera. In fact, there are very few park visitors on this tour & PCN does a great job when O'Reilly holds up a battlefield photo-PCN breaks away and actually shows a dedicated shot of just this photo on the screen. It is amazing that Burnside ordered seven futile (really suicidal)attacks against Marye's Hts. at this stone wall and was talked out of making another the next day. O'Reilly takes a small centralized subject and makes it interesting by discussing several  details about the battle without getting into any confusing  troop movements or troop positions (there's not much here). O'Reilly talks about the Confed. company stationed behind the stone wall also right behind the Innis House taking a lot of friendly fire from fellow Rebels stationed higher up on the hill directly behind. I wish someone would have asked or had he said how many friendly fire casualties were suffered. The lady of that house , a Mrs. Stevens, refused to leave that house during the entire battle-was interesting.  This DVD is just over one hour long and O'Reilly could have stayed in there with more small stories and quotes from or about veterans (many other PCN Gettysburg tours are nearly 2 hours long). However, O'Reilly makes a brief walk down the Sunken Lane very interesting, and worthwhile.",1294531200,,1492,4.936254980079681
