7938473,5,B00005J76M,The adorable girl with the bangs on the left makes this video. Only reason to buy it. Plus there's fun songs :D,1340150400,2,111,4.090909090909091
7938474,5,B00005J76M,"The songs included in this video:

Handlandia, I love to sign, Hands dance, Look in a book, Numba rhumba, friends make the world go round, human rainbow, confidence.

The songs are cute and catchy (a little too catchy).  The costumes and the camera work were a little hokey, but in the end it doesn't seem to matter to kids.  They *love* it.

Here is an example from song ""Confidence"".  First the words, and in brackets the ASL gloss:

A baby eagle tries, when he first leaves the nest

(baby eagle try leave home)

To head out toward the sky, and fly with all the rest

(go (point) sky fly, fly)

How can he dare to do

(how he dare do)

What he's never done before?

(he never do before)

He's got confidence, he's got confidence

(He have confidence, he have confidence)

Buy this!  You won't regret it!",1098316800,2,834,4.513513513513513

This is a great way to introduce sign-language. A study guide is included. Kids were enthusiastic and motivated even though they thought it was too fast. They commented: ""I wanted it to slow down so I could practice."" ""I loved all the magic ribbons and the songs."" ""I want to learn the ABC's in sign language."" ""The elf made dancing fun."" Best for ages 5 to 8.",1000425600,6,536,4.774193548387097
