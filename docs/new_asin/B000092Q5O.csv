Although this film is impossible to sum up in words, and if  i tried i might spoil your viewing pleasure.
This film is fantastic, you  will not get sick of watching it over and over again. I think that people  aged 16 to 24 will find it most enjoyable, however parents with teenage  children will probably find it useful.
Since i cant recommend that you  buy it, as it is unavailable i recommend that you hire it out at your local  video score

1876852,5,B000092Q5O,"It's begining to show it's age, but this satrical drama remains a topical dissection of the American facination with the cult of the non-celebrity.  Stephen Dorff is the angry young man who is amoung a group taken hostage by  camcorder-weilding anarchists. They force the networks to broadcast their  tapes, but it's the rebellious Dorff who soon becomes the star attraction.  Dorff is suitably surly as the man fighting against his 15 minutes of fame  and there's good suppourting work from a pre-fame Reese Witherspoon and  Jake Busey. Director Jefery Levy demonstrates a sympathetic understanding  of ninties teenage alienation. Overall and interesting and enthralling  movie that is well worth watching.",941328000,10,707,5.422018348623853
1876863,3,B000092Q5O,"An early example of a Reese Witherspoon romantic comedy (yes, it really is!) ""S.F.W."" is not without irony, random violence, a message, and a parade of truly irritating characters. But it's all good, you know? Not a great movie by any stretch, but certainly worth watching once.",1339804800,,278,4.9361702127659575
1876864,4,B000092Q5O,"A cult of personality arises when an individual uses mass media, propaganda, or other methods, to create an idealized and heroic public image. I had to state that first because that's just what this film is about. SFW peels back the layers of psychology to ask why people feel the need to follow or worship something as a group continuem. The film was ahead of its time upon release but it sure did foreshadow what was to come. If you look at culture today we as a society make celebrities out of anyone who does an outlandish act or simply associates with celebrities. Look at modern tv for example with shows like Jersey Shore and The Real Housewives series, celebrity worship is at an all time high, but did you ever ask yourself why are these people becoming celebrities or famous? I believe in today's age if you were to take anyone off the streets and clean them up. Put them in trendy clothes and plant them all over the television for a period of time, they would become famous for basically having achieved nothing. The movie does a very good job of showing what the media does and how easily they do it. Fame is a hard thing and often hard to deal with. Society along with the media love to build someone up just to watch them fall only to see if they can get better again. We have seen this with Britney Spears, Lindsey Lohan,and Robert Downey Jr and these are people with true talent. Unfortunetly some don't make it through like Corey Haim (RIP). It's sad that media makes disposable caricatures out of people, as fast as they put them up....they put them down. SFW is a very deep film and speaks volumes about pop culture and celebrity worship.",1320624000,,1658,4.475247524752476
1876865,4,B000092Q5O,"WOW! I'm always amazed and intrigued when I read such mixed reviews about a film.

I had no idea until now that this came out the same year as ""Natural Born Killers,"" but while I watched it I was reminded of the same satiric, brutal, over-the-top portrayal of the hype that fuels a media frenzy. If that type of movie offends or disappoints you, S.F.W. will probably probably have the same effect.

The story was purposefully exaggerated and for the most part darkly comical, but it was also violent and raw. Besides being thoroughly entertained, I was reminded why I have no desire to be famous - not even for 15 minutes. I'd rather be invisible than have my life examined under a microscope and judged by people who form their perception of me based on what they have been led to believe or by something I've done at a certain point that doesn't represent who I really am as a person. Then again, that's often what happens in reality.

Obviously there are countless individuals who have adopted the ""So F___ing What"" attitude throughout history. I have no trouble imagining a film today (17 years later) that makes a parody of ""W.T.F."" becoming a national mantra and the results that might transpire.",1298851200,2,1202,4.660377358490566

1876867,5,B000092Q5O,"I disagree this movie was ahead of its time. It was actually a little late. Sarcastic, campy, crude, trashy, and smart enough to play dumb. This probably should have been a Christian Slater movie in the ilk of Heathers, Gleaming the Cube, and Pump up the Volume. It also hearkens to the ultimate of all 80's teen angst cult classics: Suburbia. It basically took the 80's teen angst alt/punk flick and brought it to the mid-90's. It's a fun movie with a great sense of humor to those who get it, and completely vile and trashy to those who don't. Sadly, looking back, this was the last of it's kind. The era of the low budget smartass punk kid indie flick has been gone a long time, replaced by sparkling vampires, Hot Topic fashion, and soundtracks featuring top 40 music. To me, this movie is a time capsule of early to mid-90's alt culture, and a fun bit of nostalgia for those of us who were teenagers at the time, but other than the 30-40 age group, I have no idea who else it would appeal to.",1278979200,,997,4.336898395721925
1876868,1,B000092Q5O,"I'm sure fans who wrote four star reviews won't like this, but that's okay because I didn't like this movie. Stephen Dorff stars as Cliff Spab a onetime burger boy who finds himself thrust into the media spotlight after being taken hostage by a group of terrorists dubbed The Split Image. Spab was just going to get a sixer but found himself tied to a chair along with his best friend (Jack Noseworthy) and a cute blonde named Wendy (Reese Witherspoon). Spab becomes the group spokesman spouting such inspirational codas as ""So F'ing what. Everything is nothing and doesn't mean anything"". The media seize on the opportunity to turn him into an instant celeb and soon Spab's face is everywhere from T-shirts to CD covers. He's also broadcast 24-7 on every T.V. station. Spab finds it impossible to enjoy any kind of normal life since he's become so famous and all his friends want something from him. I agree with some reviewers who say the film is ahead of it's time but I also say it's all in the delivery. All of the characters, most of all Spab, are so tasteless and annoying. Witherspoon appears too young and naive to come down on her hard. Jake Busey is kind of entertaining as one of Spab's crazy friends but the best bits of casting are Joey Lauren Adams and Natasha Gregson Wagner. Adams is super cute and has about three seconds of nudity in the film. Gregson Wagner plays a Spab follower who doesn't go as far with her idol as Adams does. If this movie's message is ""So F'ing What"" than why the hell make it?",1244678400,5,1520,4.510869565217392
1876869,2,B000092Q5O,Save your money.  This is a terrible movie.  I don't know what else to say about it.  I can't believe that Reese Witherspoon agreed to do this movie.  This is a trashy movie and not fit for children of any age.,1238630400,,210,4.048780487804878
1876870,5,B000092Q5O,I received the movie in very good condition and it arrived within the time it said it would.  I was very pleased with the level of service I got and would definetly order from amazon again.,1238371200,,189,4.25
1876871,2,B000092Q5O,"Joey Lauren Adams, as Monica Dice, was the best thing about this movie. Her time onscreen was all too short.",1224547200,2,108,4.45
1876872,2,B000092Q5O,"SFW, shorthand for an expression of disdainful dismissal that I doubt Amazon would like me annotating, is one of those cult hits whose popularity defies all logic. While genuinely endearing movies languish in studio vaults, dry rotting and forgotten, films like SFW (and you really do understand the title, right?) ride the wave of acclaim and fond regard, and personally I have no idea why. This story of the aftermath in the lives of suddenly famous teens whose entire month-long ordeal of being held hostage in a convenience store is broadcast live before the world might be suitable for a short sketch or a brief student film, but to stretch it out to feature length and say it has artistic merit...? No. Not buying it. Of course it does feature Stephen Dorff and a pre-A list Reese Witherspoon, so maybe that's a clue as to why it's still fondly referred to today not only by those who sat through it in a decade ago but by those coming of age in this decade, long after the time when by all sanity it should be a '90's artifact. Much less a satire of celebrity and media feeding frenzy, SFW is more like an inside joke its makers have played on the general public.",1190073600,3,1170,4.523584905660377
1876883,5,B000092Q5O,I had seen this movie for the first time on TV. It was so much better without everything being cut out of it! I loved how the movie all tied together these two lives from their most intimate thoughts to their most ultimate betrayals. The ironic ending was a touch of perfection to an already awesome movie. This is a must see for everyone especially Stephen Dorff and Reese Witherspoon fans. They were simply amazing!,1180483200,,417,4.573333333333333
1876884,4,B000092Q5O,"I really liked this movie when i seen it for the first time back in the begining of 1994. Recently i saw this movie on sale in circuit city for 6 dollars and bought it. After siting down and watching it again. I was amazed at how ahead of its time this movie really was. For all you people who do not get this movie,i will break it down. Basicly in a nutshell it is about a group of nobodys kidnaped and held in a 7-11. There captors don't ask for nothing,but film them the whole time. REAL Reality tv you might say. One by one they are killed of and only two remain. They finally escape and find out they are stars,for doing nothing. This movie a commentaly on the sheep mentality of the people who watch ""reality TV"".The same people that make nobodys,like all the winners of american idol in to the flavor of the moment. In case you were wondering SFW stands for""So F**king What"".This is the conculsion Dorfman comes to at the end of the movie.",1157241600,4,946,4.261111111111111
1876885,1,B000092Q5O,"My impression watching this turkey was that it had to be the work of a film student desperately trying to impress some artsy instructor. It's all style, no substance. I got the vague impression that there was a story somewhere in this mess of flashbacks, long slow camara pans across Stephen Dorff's very trendy and stylish haircut, and yelling matches with side characters whose only function seems to be to have someone to yell with. Despite the very art-house feel of it, the story is lost, the viewer is never quite sure if the ""philosophy"" of the main character is meant to be taken seriously, and the style is nothing we haven't seen done better other places.

All in all, I found it pretty vapid, painfully slow, and incredibly frustrating, because there is a good movie in here SOMEWHERE, if only the script had gone to someone else to make.

On a side note, Toby Maguire shows up for a little while as a stoned out of his mind loser, which was a bit of a trip given where his career eventually went.",1137369600,8,1008,4.502732240437158
1876886,5,B000092Q5O,"This is greasy-haired, mid-90's, existentialist anti-drama at it's finest.  Cliff Spab walks the world, like Camus' Stranger, unaffected by the violence, sex and drugs that inundate him.  He stands, balanced on the edge of a knife, sometimes loathing the people around him for their foolishness and self-serving pretensions, and at other times loving them and embracing them for their helplessness and curiousity.

Not all people are capable of enjoying this movie.",1117843200,9,465,5.52112676056338
1876887,5,B000092Q5O,CULT OF PERSONALITY! How people are sheep and they follow anything and go along with the masses.. A MUST SEE..  A MUST HAVE SOUNDTRACK!! One of the best movies of this genre!,1109635200,5,174,4.4375
1876888,4,B000092Q5O,"To begin with, this movie is not for the dim witted. it's not for the shallow people who go through life just scratching the surface of things. There is a deeper meaning to this movie than the majority of the population can catch on to. Every word, every movement, every scene has an underlying meaning and message. thats why it's a cult classic, and why it was so hard to find for so many years (until MGM picked it up on dvd thank you!!!!!). This is one of my fav. movies, i've seen it a hundred times, and each time i find something new in it. But as i said this movie is not for the dim witted, if you can't read between the lines, your gonna be lost.

Also the only reason anyone below would compare this movie to pulp fiction is because in the beginning of the movie you learn the broad picture. But they use flashbacks and cut scenes to tell the story of the hostage situation, by showing specific scenes, while cutting in and out of the present and the past.",1094342400,6,966,4.221621621621622
1876889,2,B000092Q5O,"I really thought this was pretty lame movie, and in NO way a comparrison to Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction the way one reviewer described.  The attempt is to tell a story about some kid, played by Stephen Dorff, who becomes a pop-culture icon because he was held hostage and apparently didn't care.  At least thats what I got out of it.  I think what turned me off the most about this movie was Dorff's character--an ""uber-cool"" rebel type who's mean to his apparently oppresive father and cry-baby of a mother, slam dances and tears up his room (I guess to prove to us how cool he is), and who can get in front of an audience of high school kids and proudly cuss for no other reason then he'll know it'll get laughs.  In real life someone like that would be considered a slacker or an (...), but for the case of this movie I guess he's cool.  Anyway, my problems with the character aside, this movie just wasn't that good to begin with.  A REALLY weak script, and I swear each of these leading actors could have, and have done, about ten times better since, so I wonder why the only put in half the effort for this one.  Maybe they knew it wasn't going anywhere and needed the paycheck.  As cool and revolutionary it tries to be, S.F.W. doesn't really do anything all that spectacular. The gun battle at the end with the terrorists, as well as the movie's protrayal of the media are the best (and really only good) things about this movie.  But, most of you kiddies out there will probably like it because it has people cussing and drinking beer.  But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.",1012176000,11,1594,4.372881355932203
1876890,5,B000092Q5O,"This film was unreal.  It really captured the whole essence of media well.
The person below me fails to realise that this film has many characures.  Most of them aren't supposed to make sense.  And if you look at how he acted in the hostage situation you are missing the point.
He isn't supposed to be a hero.  He did nothing heroic of any sort.
>>what is the deal with the guys smashing the room up for no >>reason
They are doing it for no reason, for gratification.  That is the point, they don't care about the conseqences.  He just got out of a hostage room and he wanted to go crazy.  My friends have often talked about smashing TV's (ala 'Fight for your right to party' filmclip) and how cool it would be.  It's the same thing.
>>then stephen dorf is completely sober in the next scene?
Ummm, he never was drunk.
>>why does jake busey pull a gun out so fast?
Okay you got me.  I could never figure out why they were good friends with him, he didn't seem like a good guy at all.
>>what is the deal with the mayor? he woulda killed dorf for making a fool out of him.
Oh yeah, killed him in front of hundreds of people.  What do you mean by that exactly?  He wouldnt have wanted to draw any extra attention to himself.
Don't take the story or the charcters too seriously.  The message is what this film is about, once you understand that you can then see why the story and acting is what it is, to make this come accross.  The story is about the Media, America's obsession with celebrities and most importantly, the way that Cliff Spab doesn't have a love of his life, so he is free to enjoy it, and live it.
Every scene and everything has a purpose.  And as far as Dorff swearing too much that is ridiculous.  First of all they don't swear as much as in Clerks.  Second in private its not that bad, in public in front of the people he swears just as much, which is maybe what you are talking about.  But that is the point, he doesn't care.
And he swears a lot in the flashback scenes.  I would be too if I had a camera and a gun pointed at me for 36 days.",987724800,4,2059,4.117794486215539

7988606,5,B000092Q5O,"This movie gets mixed reviews and for good reason.  It's really a movie targeting a really specific audience.  If you're young, teens to mid-twenties, with a bit of an anarchy feel to your life, this movie is for you.  On top of that, it's largely a male targeted movie though I'm sure there's plenty of women out there who love it.

Personally, when I first watched it years and years ago, I was in love with the crazy attitudes of the movie.  A few years later, I started to have more of an appreciation for how it takes constant stabs at the media, at lawyers, and at hypocrites.

Though from the time I first saw it to even now, many years later, one of the aspects of this movie that always draws me back is that the main characters, Spab, really is just a guy who wants a relaxed and simple life.  Who really doesn't care about the crazy opinions and judgments of the people around him.  A guy who can feel the ridiculousness of society.

At this point, it's a nostalgic movie that I adore.  And I'll always come back to it.  Just wish Amazon had it for sale digitally.  I'm kind of done with DVDs/Blue Rays.",1348617600,,1114,4.302884615384615
