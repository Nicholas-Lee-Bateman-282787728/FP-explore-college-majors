16953,3,0767821807,I love Sinatra and Rita and Kim are right at the top with me but I have to be honest. I was a bit disappointed with this film. It left me rather cold and bored...,995155200,4,162,3.657142857142857
16954,4,0767821807,"PAL JOEY had two revivals before the movie was made, but that was not enough for producers who decided to remove many songs from the original production and made a singer out of JOEY who was a dancer. Still ,who can resist FRANK SINATRA singing THE LADY IS A TRAMP,I COULD WRITE A BOOK and I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TIME IT WAS in his own unique way?After all these years it remains a top movie enternainment, and like FRANK used to say when he changed a lyric to the consternation of mister RODGERS ,broads won't do the dishes in earmans and pearls or maybe i just made that up. It's fascinating how FRANK could get away with this, but let's not forget that the league of feminists wasn't too strong then.",972950400,4,699,4.343511450381679
16955,5,0767821807,"Sinatra is amazing in this movie about a nightclub singer and the ladies in his life. All the songs are first-rate and Sinatra's performances of  ""Lady Is A Tramp"" and ""I Didn't Know What Time It Was""  are classic. The plot is entertaining, and though admittedly tamer than the  story originally was, still has enough of a hint of naughtiness to stay  true to the swing of things. Hayworth gives a kick butt performance and  steals the show as the glamourous rich widow who helps Joey finance his  dreams. Novak is beautiful and does good, but what woman can compete with a  co-star like Ms. Hayowrth!  But the best thing about Pal Joey is that it's  Sinatra bring Sinatra and that's why I fell in love with this movie.",965088000,7,719,4.511627906976744
16956,5,0767821807,"Rita Hayworth and Frank Sinatra make this movie a 5-star success.  Rita completely outshines Kim Novak in not only looks, but class, poise and talent.  This movie-lover finds it hard to believe that Hollywood would  dare to even compare Kim Novak to the beautiful Rita Hayworth.  Rita is the  ultimate classic beauty.  She and Frank make this a movie definitely worth  seeing.  I totally enjoyed the storyline and the music is outstanding.",964569600,,439,5.0
16957,4,0767821807,"Sinatra at his hipster best. Kim Novak is stunning, Rita dos her dance provacatuer..and the songs are terrific.
Chez Joey is the nightclub that Rita will bankroll only if Joey is "" in line"" Look for Barbara  Nichols in the chorus line.
Just when you might think the plot drags a  bit here comes another Sinatra standard..and oh that 1957 Thunderbird.!",952646400,4,351,4.737704918032787
16958,2,0767821807,"Time was, we could find womanizers funny. But no longer. Frank Sinatra is a bit of a cad here, as he toys with the affections of 2 lovely women--Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak. The movie starts, in fact, as Frank (""Pal  Joey"") is being run out of town by the police, for trifling with the  affections of an underage girl. Settled in San Francisco, Frank uses Rita  to finance his new supper club, but cannot give up his star act, Kim Novak.  All very shallow, and a rather nice (sweetened up) ending.
Not to deny  the power of the songs--Rodgers and Hart at their best.
Not to deny the  beauty of the Cinematography--glorious limpid shots of 50's San  Francisco.
But that plot!",949276800,11,674,4.475409836065574
16959,5,0767821807,"If you are even remotely a Sinatra fan, or a fan of Rodgers & Hart, you will love this movie. The music is terrific, Sinatra is perfectly comfortable in the role of a womanizer!  The cinematography is excellent  (DVD highly recommended) and it was filmed on location in beautiful 1957  San Francisco.  It's also very romantic and Sinatra is truly seductive.  He  never looked better than in this film - this is the swingin' 50's Sinatra  with the tilted hat, at (one of) the height(s) of his career.  If choosing  between the VHS or DVD, definitely go with the DVD!  Not a masterpiece,  but again, if you like Sinatra and/or Rodgers & Hart, it IS a  masterpiece.  Novak & Hayworth are great, too. The only down side is it  had to be sanitized quite a bit from the stage play due to 1950's film  standards.  Still, it's very sexy for 1957. Includes the great  ""Bewitched"" & ""My Funny Valentine"".",946339200,16,894,4.522012578616352

A down-and-out  guy, a real loser, tries his luck with a supper club, thanks to the benevolent rich woman, played by Rita Hayworth. She's a former stripper who married a rich guy.

Unlike, for example, in ""From Here to Eternity"", Frank really doesn't have to act in this movie; just be himself. This is what makes it such an enjoyable flick. It's almost a documentary. It's also full of Rodgers and Hart (arranged by another genius, Nelson Riddle), which further propels it to 5 star status. I wish Sinatra had sung more of these American standards (which he owns like no other singer, except, perhaps, Ella) in this movie but this isn't really a musical. It defies categorization. It's just Sinatra between two beautiful bookends and a mid 50s Hollywood urban love story. It is a permanent part of my video library listed under ""Ring-a-ding-ding!""",1398297600,,775,5.0625

This is a good classic Sinatra vehicle with good chemistry between Sinatra and Kim Novak, catchy Rogers and Hart tunes impeccably arranged by Nelson Riddle with unpretentious choreography by Hermes Pan; and the sound quality is very good.  It's enjoyable enough to watch, with several chuckles along the way.  But unfortunately, this so-called Blu-Ray disc is little more than a regular DVD, superimposed onto a Blu-Ray format with no noticeable improvement in the quality of resolution, sold at a highly inflated price. The unwary consumer thinks he's getting something special, and he isn't.

It is a delightful jaunt through San Francisco club life that provides plenty of opportunites for Frank to show off his remarkable ablity to bring a song alive. Rita Hayworth's renditions of ""Zip"" and ""Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered"" remind us anew that this lovely lady could sing a song as well as she could dance and act. The score, written by Rodgers and Hart inlcludes such classics as ""The Lady is a Tramp,"" ""There's a Small Hotel,"" and my favorite, ""If They Asked Me I Could Write a Book."" What I like most about this delightful delightful flim is that Frank plays Frank.

17075,5,0767821807,"PAL JOEY [1957] [The Limited Edition Series] [Blu-ray] Frank Sinatra Sings and Falls in Love with Kim Novak!

Pal Joey is a 1957 American musical film, loosely adapted from the musical play of the same name, and starring Rita Hayworth, Frank Sinatra, and Kim Novak. Jo Ann Greer sang for Rita Hayworth, as she had done previously in Affair in Trinidad and Miss Sadie Thompson. Kim Novak's singing voice was dubbed by Trudy Erwin. The director is George Sidney and the choreographer is Hermes Pan.

Frank Sinatra stars as John OHaras caddish crooner in this 1957 film version of the Book by John O'Hara, the music by Richard Rodgers and the lyrics by Lorenz Hart for the hit musical Pal Joey. A fresh, very fresh arrival on the San Francisco nightclub scene, the amoral and ambitious Joey soon finds himself entangled with two mice: the rapacious stripper-turned-society dame Vera [Rita Hayworth] and the good-girl chorine Linda [Kim Novak]. Handsomely directed by George Sidney, the film features a double handful of Rodgers and Harts greatest tunes, including Zip, My Funny Valentine, The Lady Is a Tramp, and I Could Write a Book.

""Some guys have a system with horses, and I got a system with dames. It's a snap. You treat a dame like a lady, and you treat a lady like a dame."" Says Joey Evans [Frank Sinatra] on the subject of romance.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Seventeen years after its premiere on Broadway in 1940, Pal Joey [1957] finally made its way to the silver screen after numerous attempts by Columbia studio boss Harry Cohn to cast and produce it. Along the way, the central character, Joey Evans, evolved from an irredeemable, womanising heel that preys on chorus girls to a likable nightclub crooner torn between his love for a struggling singer and a chance to further his career with a rich, predatory club owner. The stage musical starred Gene Kelly and was based on a series of short stories by author John O'Hara.

Pal Joey initially sprang to life as a series of New Yorker short stories by John O'Hara, which were then stitched together as a novel, one which consisted entirely of letters supposedly written by Joey to his friend Ted. Joey was a down on his luck nightclub entertainer who had a somewhat cracked moral compass, but who was a likable guy nonetheless. John O'Hara himself brought the material to Rodgers and Hart and suggested a musical adaptation, offering to write the book (libretto) himself. The musical version saw Joey (played in the original Broadway version by a newcomer named Gene Kelly) on the make with a wealthy socialite, one he feels can set him up in business with his own nightclub, while he simultaneously woos a more innocent girl. Joey is a cad, a user who's constantly scheming to latch on to that next rung on the ladder of success, and as such he bears a certain similarity to another anti-hero whose story was musicalized some two decades later.

This is a colourful and brash musical entertainment, lifted miles above its kind of turgid elements due to the star power of its lead trio, as well as some knock your socks off arrangements by Sinatra's leading collaborator of that time, Nelson Riddle. Even though Frank Sinatra, Novak and Hayworth are all immensely winning in their roles, the music here is undoubtedly one of the chief allures of this film, and Nelson Riddle's inventive reimagining of these Rodgers and Hart classics are elegant showpieces not just for Frank Sinatra's mature vocalising, but for the art of orchestration itself (actual orchestration duties fell to Arthur Morton). (Neither Rita Hayworth nor Kim Novak did their own singing, not to state the obvious.) This may not be the ""real"" Pal Joey in any sense of the word, but it still remains one of Frank Sinatra's best screen outings. Frank Sinatra certainly could have played the character as originally written (albeit probably without the demanding dance elements), but even toned down here for this ""kinder, gentler"" approach, he manages to convey a bit of Joey's smarm lying just beneath the charming surface. The happy ending of the film contrasts with that of the stage musical, where Joey is left alone at the end.

Frank Sinatra was gracious enough to allow Rita Hayworth to take top billing over him on the marquee in honour of her long-standing relationship with the studio. Despite the fact that she didn't do her own singing (she was dubbed by Jo Ann Greer), her co-star Kim Novak didn't sing either (Kim Novak was dubbed by Trudi Erwin). Of course, the songs were always the best part about Pal Joey and the film version kept ten songs by Rodgers and Hart from the original musical score and added four new ones, also by Rodgers and Hart. The new additions were ""My Funny Valentine,"" ""There's a Small Hotel,"" ""I Didn't Know What Time It Was,"" and ""The Lady is a Tramp"" which is given the definite treatment by Frank Sinatra with a killer Nelson Riddle arrangement.

It's no secret that Pal Joey was cleaned up considerably for the screen after the Production Code office demanded numerous changes, but it survived the sanitation process and even made off with four Oscar nominations: Best Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Sound, and Best Art Direction. It also marks the end of Rita Hayworth's long relationship with Columbia Pictures.

In the biography, If This Was Happiness (Sphere Books Limited), writer Barbara Leaming observed that ""it was common knowledge that Harry Cohn had anointed Kim Novak to replace Rita Hayworth at Columbia and shortly thereafter, the creation of Kim Novak as Columbia's next 'big star' was widely thought to be Harry Cohn's revenge on Rita Hayworth, so that putting the two actresses together made the press and public expect fireworks. Still, according to George Sidney, on the set 'there was no friction between Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak.' Although Rita Hayworth did lament that she was actually younger than Frank Sinatra, she was really just anxious to fulfil her final obligations to the studio as quickly and as smoothly as possible.""

Blu-ray Video Quality  Pal Joey is presented on Blu-ray courtesy of Twilight Time with a 1080p transfer in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio. As has been mentioned before in other Twilight Time reviews, the niche label is at the mercy of the studios from which they license these titles, and this Columbia Pictures release, while incredibly colourful and vivid looking. There's nothing bad here, certainly nothing to be overly concerned about, but a lot of this film is just slightly gauzy, something increased exponentially in the optical, including (obviously) the credits sequence as well as the big fantasy sequence that caps the film. The pluses far outweigh the negatives here, with some incredibly lushly saturated colour, and excellent fine detail which brings out every nuance in the stunning Jean Louis costumes.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The Pal Joey soundtrack is offered in two mixes, English: 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and an Isolated Music: 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Mono. Fidelity here is quite good, but it must also be stated for the record that some of the dubbed singing sounds noticeably boxier than the bulk of the soundtrack and listen especially to the women in the opening ""Rainbow"" production number for a very good example. The 5.1 mix isn't overly immersive, but the music is opened up rather nicely in this mix, and occasionally some ambient environmental sound effects will dot the surrounds, adding a bit of spaciousness to the proceedings. The music sounds spectacular for the most part, and Sinatra's voice is magnificent, reproduced with its entire slightly aged lustre.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Kim Novak Backstage Documentary [9:28] This is a really interesting, albeit way too brief special feature, where we visit Kim Novak at her Oregon hideaway, where she reminisces about costume designer Jean Louis, as well as how the pressures of Hollywood actually helped her to continue working on her painting, something Kim Novak is still involved with. Kim Novak comes off as very charming and very down to earth, with absolutely no illusions or delusions of being a ""big star.""

Special Feature: Isolated Score Track: Presented in mono via a splendid sounding 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio mix. (Some online sites reported the isolated score as being released here in stereo, but I've confirmed with Twilight Time, and my own ears, that this is in mono.)

Original Theatrical Trailer [1957] [4:59] This is a Frank Sinatra hosted longer than usual trailer. It sports pretty ragged looking video but is fun to watch nonetheless.

BONUS: Special Booklet: Here we have a beautiful designed 8 page booklet with extensive liner notes by Julie Kirgo and film art packaged with the Blu-ray disc.

Finally, Pal Joey is it seems to me another superb example of the old studio system firing on all cylinders and the whole package of music design, art direction, costuming, choreography, and film editing, plus many Oscar-nominated for Pal Joey and all functioning seamlessly. With an incredible star package headed by Frank Sinatra on the screen, it is terrific entertainment that's hard to beat, especially for all you ""young 'uns"" out there who are only familiar with Rodgers and Hammerstein; you have a veritable universe of fantastic music to discover in the pairing of Rodgers and Hart. There's no finer film to start than this beautiful colourful musical. Frank Sinatra could have easily pulled off a less likable character. But this 1957 musical is brash, well-staged, and features three big ""movie star"" performances from Frank Sinatra, Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak. With good quality video and audio, and a really appealing, if sadly a short documentary, this release comes with highest praise indeed. So all in all, I am proud and honoured to have this in my classic musical film in my Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

17117,4,0767821807,"I dogged on Frank Sinatra before for his stilted performance in `Some Came Running' and was somewhat lambasted for it.  While settling in to watch `Pal Joey' I was envisioning a repeat.  What can I say?  I actually really liked his performance here.  He possessed a coolness and a well-rounded edge that elevated his character and created something believable.  He had those moments of restraint and introverted emotion and yet he balanced it out with a simple charm that was genuine and engaging.

In `Pal Joey', George Sidney's 1957 musical, Sinatra plays a crooner out of luck until he lucks into a gig that lands him a chance to charm a wealthy widow into giving him his own club.  The only problem is that that widow is jealous of his attention and tries to put a wedge between Joey and his budding romance with one of the showgirls.

Sinatra is great here.  He carries the film on his shoulders and delivers a fine performance.  Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak give him a run for his money though, especially Hayworth who ravishes in her last screen performance.  She is intoxicating and sensual and possesses a true sense of power.  Novak comes off a tad stiff in some scenes, especially the early ones, but as the film progresses she gets more comfortable in her performance and truly delivers.  Her take on `My Funny Valentine' is remarkable and possibly the best moment in the film.  The form a cohesive threesome and create some serious charm.  Novak is also a solidified knockout in the film and is, as she puts it, ""stacked"".

`Pal Joey' is predictable yet fun and it is pretty to look at with lavish sets and some great costume design (the use of color in particular is wonderful).  It's a nicely done musical with talent to spare.",1346284800,,1741,4.637254901960785
17138,5,0767821807,"For such a successful musical with a score by Richard Rodgers (music) and Lorenz Hart (lyrics), it's a bit surprising that it took seventeen years before Columbia Pictures brought it to the screen.

He is a shallow, down-and-out, womanizing hoofer but, for all that, radiates charm and wit. In the movie, he has to choose between two gorgeous ladies - Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak. Tough choice! Novak is a timid girl from the chorus line while Hayworth is a former stripper who has pretentions of being a society lady.
The film score has many tunes that have become popular standards: `Bewitched', `My funny valentine', `I didn't know what time it was', `I could write a book', `There's a small hotel', and `The lady is a tramp', superbly delivered by Sinatra to Hayworth.

17141,4,0767821807,"PAL JOEY is a slick 1957 Columbia production of a popular `40s Broadway musical featuring a great Richard Rodgers-Lorenz Hart score.

I saw the musical on-stage at Goodspeed Opera House (in beautiful East Haddam, Ct.) a few years back in a revival that approximated the original Broadway show. The lead character - an aspiring dancer - wasn't particularly pleasant or sympathetic, using women as a tool to climb the ladder to success, making for a show that was atypical for its time.

When it came time to produce the movie some years later, changes were understandably made to John O'Hara's original stories (first published in the New Yorker), especially once it became a vehicle for Frank Sinatra. Joey was now an aspiring singer instead of a hoofer, and while Sidney's film retains enough of its source material's feel so that Joey isn't exactly a kind soul to the opposite sex, it's been softened to a degree where its protagonist is more of a rascal than an unabashed jerk.

It's a change for the better in terms of this 1957 film, which isn't a classic (Joey's plight still isn't particularly compelling, despite the alterations), but nevertheless comes to life whenever one of Rodgers and Hart's songs appear on the soundtrack: ""The Lady is a Tramp,"" ""I Could Write a Book,"" and ""My Funny Valentine"" are just a few of the duo's classic songs crooned by Sinatra and the vocal stand-ins for co-stars Rita Hayworth (as a former stripper who enables Joey to run his own night club) and Kim Novak (as the ""good"" chorus girl who tries in vain to reform Joey's ways). As Julie Kirgo points out, some of the songs aren't from ""Pal Joey"" but other Rogers-Hart shows including ""On Your Toes"" and ""Babes in Arms"" among others, but they help to augment a film version, scripted by Dorothy Kingsley, that's dated in its own way.

In addition to a lovely AVC encoded 1080p transfer culled from the Sony vaults, Twilight Time's Blu-Ray offers a wonderful 5.1 DTS MA soundtrack that enhances the outstanding musical direction of Nelson Riddle and George Duning. The original trailer and a nice, albeit brief, ten-minute featurette on Novak off-screen circa 2010 round out another terrific TT release.",1337040000,4,2193,4.855614973262032

When I saw this movie in 1957 I fell head over heels for Frank and the sophisticated night club scene, but now Frank's Joey seems like a heartless sleaze, the clubs are cheap, and the movie is hopelessly dated.  It was made at the height of Frank's ring-a-ding-ding movie popularity, though, and he still charms despite playing a mean-spirited and selfish loser who is outweighed by both of his co-stars.  Poor Rita looks drab and tired, a far cry from her earlier glory days.  Kim is lovely (without those thick eyebrows from ""Vertigo""), but her singing voice is a disaster and she isn't much of a dancer.  A beatnik-style dance featuring both ladies is just embarrassing.

On the plus side, the songs are terrific.  The show is filled with memorable Rodgers and Hart tunes such as ""The Lady is a Tramp,"" ""Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered,"" ""I Could Write a Book,"" ""There's a Small Hotel,"" and ""My Funny Valentine.""

The movie is glossy and pretty with lavish gowns and furs and picturesque San Francisco as a location, but is definitely a product of its time.  What was once ultra-cool and sophisticated now seems tawdry and pathetic.  Good songs, though.",1309478400,,1370,4.836909871244635

Rita Hayworth is just lovely as the poor girl made good turned sugar momma.  The music carries the story along in a way that you just don't see anymore.

I'm not a fan of theatre and so I don't speak to the reviews of fans of the Broadway musical other than to say that they tend to go the route of the book people who never let films be just a film.

Frank Sinatra plays Joey as a cad with a heart of gold, who you know will do the right thing in the end. Getting to that point, you have to put up with Frank's 1950-ish hipster persona, which by todays standards produces quite a few cringes in his attitude towards women. Getting past that, the movie has widely added several great Rodgers and Hart songs from their other musicals, including one of Frank's signature numbers, ""The Lady is a Tramp."" The music alone makes it worthwhile to watch.
  The location has been moved to San Francisco, and the location footage is another pleasant change from the play's dreary Chicago setting. The characters have also been altered, becoming less caustic on the one side, as with Joey, and even sweeter on the other side, as with Kim Novak. Having seen the Broadway version, and concluding that the greatest fault of the show was the inability to like the main characters, the changes here work for the best.

I don't know if Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak did their own singing, but since most of the songs are performed by the incomparable Sinatra, you are sure to be humming several of the tunes for days afterwards.",1234828800,3,1314,4.67965367965368

Even though my favorite song comes from this movie, Frank Sinatra was much too old and didn't have Eddie Fisher's looks for an EF fanclub president like little old me.  I certainly thought he was taller (like Michael Feinstein, big talent comes in short people); after all, he was already a star in the entertainment business and movies, not just on television.  Though he was not 'bewitching,' he was a bundle of talent and versitility with lots of media attention and some gorgeous ex-wives.

To think that Hitch's blonde in ""Vertigo"" had music in her veins, Kim Novack was a good foil for Sinatra's antics on and off stage.  But it took Rita Hayworth to put him in his place.  She was the star from Knob Hill.

Watch and see how good the musicals were fifty years ago and see Sinatra at his best.  Thanks to Carlos (not Mark), it was later that I learned to appreciate Frank's perfect enunciation as I aided in his quest for perfect English.  No one since has come close to him with the exception of Feinstein, who so graciously sang 'But Not for Me,' a Gershwin song, to me in Nashville.  What a night!",1225843200,3,1172,4.533333333333333

17172,3,0767821807,"If Frank Sinatra had a signature role in his long movie career, this must be it because he plays one of his coolest cats in this fairly adult 1957 musical drama based on a book by John O'Hara. However, it's better remembered for the fourteen songs by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, many of which became Sinatra standards. Written by Dorothy Kingsley, the rather slight story has the crooner play womanizing nightclub singer Joey Evans who keeps losing jobs because cad that he is, he likes to fool around with married women. Joey lands in San Francisco and finagles his way into a job as singer and emcee at a dive called the Barbary Coast. There he meets innocent Linda English from Albuquerque, a chorine who refuses to strip and just wants to be a torch singer. In typical Sinatra swinging fashion, Joey flirts with her but plays hard-to-get. One night, both are recruited for a charity show held at a posh Nob Hill mansion. The hostess is Vera Simpson, a former striptease performer who has since become a wealthy society matron. Sparks fly between Joey and Vera but only after mutual acts of humiliation. He breezily moves in with her on her yacht, and she decides to fund his pipe dream, owning a sophisticated nightspot she dubs ""Chez Joey"". Never one to leave his cards on the table, Joey hires Linda to sing, and you can guess the rest as the inevitable romantic triangle takes the expected turns.

Directed by George Sidney (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anchors-Aweigh/dp/B00002E223/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anchors Aweigh</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Viva-Las-Vegas/dp/B000QUUD56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Viva Las Vegas</a>), it plays out rather lugubriously with nary a surprise, but the songs are mostly gems. Sinatra knows how to play heels, though Joey never gets hard-boiled enough to develop a true edge. On the upside, he sings ""There's a Small Hotel"", ""I Could Write a Book"" and best of all, ""The Lady Is a Tramp"" to a guardedly smitten Rita Hayworth well cast as Vera. Even though at 38, she was actually younger than Sinatra, she cuts a coolish (and shapely) figure as a jealous patroness despite the unflattering camera angles. It's just a shame that the story doesn't respect her character much, especially at the very end. However, when she literally lets her hair down, it's a relief to see her old seductive self in post-coital bliss as she lip-syncs ""Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"" (sung seductively by Jo Ann Greer). As Linda, Kim Novak - a year away from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vertigo/dp/0783226055/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vertigo</a>&nbsp;- fares less well as she looks tentative and oddly blank-faced during her big number, ""My Funny Valentine"" (sung sonorously by Trudy Erwin). But we all know it's really Sinatra we want to see perform, and from that respect, a lot of the movie plays out like one of his 1960's TV specials. The only extras on the 1999 DVD are a couple of trailers and talent files for the principals. An intermittent entertainment, it's definitely a product of a bygone era.",1212278400,8,3178,5.394366197183099
17173,4,0767821807,"As other reviewers have noted, Frank Sinatra was at the top of his form when he starred in PAL JOEY, the film version of the celebrated Rodgers and Hart musical (originally staged on Broadway in 1940 starring Gene Kelly).

Based around the cynical short stories of John O'Hara, PAL JOEY is the story of womanising nightclub entertainer Joey Evans (Sinatra) and his various affairs, most notably with Mrs Simpson (Rita Hayworth), a widowed millionairess trying to escape her past as a stripper; and Linda English (Kim Novak), a naive showgirl whose heart is stolen by the caddish Joey.

The main reason why PAL JOEY works so well is the delicious score, which includes ""Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"", ""I Could Write a Book"", ""Zip"", and ""That Terrific Rainbow"".  Orchestrated by Sinatra's frequent musical collaborator Nelson Riddle, the film version of PAL JOEY also interpolates several more Rodgers & Hart standards into the score (""My Funny Valentine"", ""There's a Small Hotel"", ""The Lady is a Tramp"").

Rita Hayworth (in what turned out to be the final movie under her Columbia contract) exudes lots of steamy, repressed sensuality with her performance as the widowed society dame taken in by Joey's charms; and in a rare musical role, Kim Novak dazzles.  Frank Sinatra, with trademark raincoat and jaunty hat, is his charming best as lady-killer Joey.  Look out for talented Barbara Nichols among the showgirls.

The DVD for PAL JOEY sadly doesn't have much in the way of bonus materials, just a trailer and some talent profiles for it's main stars and director George Sidney.  Still, for musical fans this is quite the treat.  (Single-sided, single-layer disc).",1205712000,3,1671,5.091575091575091
17174,5,0767821807,"""Pal Joey,"" (1957), a dramatic musical romance, is a product of Harry Cohn's Columbia Studio, a fact easily gleaned by a quick glance at the movie itself; while it's in Technicolor, the colors themselves are not nearly so saturated as is the signature palette of rival Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios.  The movie, as was common at the time, was based upon the 1940 Broadway hit of the same name that made a star of Gene Kelly.  That play was based upon a series of fictional letters from ""Your Pal Joey,"" written by noted American writer John O'Hara, and published in ""The New Yorker.""  O'Hara wrote the play's book; Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart provided the all-grown up music; George Abbott produced and directed.  The still knocking them dead Elaine Stritch created that nifty song ""Zip,"" on Broadway, where it was given to ""The Reporter,"" rather than the Vera Simpson character.

What was rather unusual about ""Pal Joey"" was that it took 15 years to get to the screen, owing to the fact that the play was more cynical, and risqu&eacute;, than was permissible in Hollywood at the time.  And a lot can change in 15 years.  Anyway, the witty screen adaptation, somewhat sanitized, given a Hollywood happy ending, but still sailing pretty close to the wind, was by Dorothy Kingsley, nimble direction was by the under-appreciated George Sidney.

But the hard-edged director Billy Wilder was said to be Cohn's first directorial choice; they say studio mogul and director went to lunch to discuss it - and at the end of lunch, Wilder was not only not given the job, but was given the bill.  Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth had impressed Cohn by their work together in the 1944 hit,""Covergirl,"" and the studio chief promised them another picture together, expected to be ""Pal Joey.""  But those 15 years went by, and Kelly was under contract to MGM.  So Cohn thought of Jack Lemmon.  Cohn initially thought of Marlene Dietrich for the Simpson role, characterized as an older woman, but Dietrich wouldn't take it.  However, she suggested Frank Sinatra for the title role, Joey Evans.  Meanwhile, Rita Hayworth, who was Columbia's reigning sex symbol at the time, and had expected to play Linda English, the ing&eacute;nue, aged rapidly, unfortunately.  She was just 39 at filming, actually three years younger than Sinatra, but had to take the Vera Simpson, older woman part. The younger woman's part was given to Kim Novak, the studio's rising sex symbol.  Barbara Nichols played Gladys Bump, chorus girl comic relief.

Setting of the movie was moved from Chicago to San Francisco, so much more picturesque, and Novak somehow looked so good there.  The movie picked up several great songs from the play: ""If They Asked Me, I Could Write a Book,"" and ""Bewitched, Bothered and ""Bewildered,"" the play's biggest hits.  Also, for sure, ""My Funny Valentine,"" and ""Zip,"" a homage to Gypsy Rose Lee. Several of the play's songs were considered still too risqu&eacute;, and were replaced by other works of Rodgers and Hart, ""There's a Small Hotel,"" ""I Didn't Know What Time It was,"" and ""The Lady Is a Tramp."" Some knowledgeable reviewers complain about the songs missing from the play; but these replacements each became at least as popular as the tunes written for that play.  Musical arrangements were by Sinatra's frequent collaborator, Nelson Riddle.  The part had to be somewhat rewritten for Sinatra, of course, emphasis changed from dancing to singing.  But he sang his own songs; he was at his peak, and the songs, as the part, might really have been tailored to him. Neither Hayworth nor Novak could sing: they were dubbed.

The plot's pretty well-known:  Joey's a womanizing nightclub singer.  When he ventures beyond no-fault chorines to mayor's daughters, he finds himself hurriedly leaving towns.  He finds himself in San Francisco, where he digs up an old friend who'll give him a job.  Also ambitious chorus girl Linda English, who initially wants nothing to do with him.  And Vera Simpson, retired stripper, married well, now rich older society dame.  Without a word, by sheer dint of good acting, a back-story romance between Evans and Simpson is implied.  Anyway, Evans becomes Simpson's prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, as the movie called it; she agrees to finance his own, ritzy nightclub.  But the lovers' triangle, Evans, Simpson, English, between the stars, creates great instability.

Hayworth, wrinkles and all, is still gorgeous; the young Novak, who would not be as much of a favorite with succeeding generations, is very beautiful.  In their last scene together, so brief as to be almost subliminal, Hayworth is just haunting. Sinatra won a Golden Globe for his work; the movie was nominated for four Oscars, and picked up four further awards.  It was undoubtedly sanitized, but it's still unusually grown-up for its time.  It has many memorable, evergreen musical numbers, and three outstanding actors.  They really don't come much better.",1200528000,15,4943,5.014705882352941
17175,4,0767821807,"Despite its Broadway success, Pal Joey took his time reaching the screen. Gene Kelly came to fame in the title role in the original Broadway production of Pal Joey and was the logical first choice for the screen version but when MGM would not lend him out the project sat on the backburner so long that his intended co-star Rita Hayworth swapped female roles to play the older woman who bankrolls Joey's club - on her terms - by the time the film finally reached the screen in 1957.

One of the few Columbia musicals that creates some of its own magic rather than trying to copy the RKO and MGM formula, Sinatra is so perfect as John O'Hara's heel that it is now impossible to imagine Kelly in the role. Not all of the Rodgers and Hart's songs are well served - some, such as I Didn't Know What Time It Was, are all but thrown away - but the score is a strong one (The Lady Is A Tramp, Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered, If They Asked Me I Could Write A Book ) and the film is one of the few successful Broadway-to-screen transfers of its day. Great dog too.

The only real extra on the DVD is the original five-minute trailer, but it's a gem. Filmed on the film's set, with Sinatra introducing us to Joey's vocabulary with the aid of a blackboard and ruler, it's terrific fun and a genuine collector's item! Thankfully that's included on Twilight Time's excellent limited edition Blu-ray release along with a featurette Backstage with Kim Novak, an isolated score track and a booklet, as well as superior picture quality.",1198886400,3,1523,4.474820143884892

17187,4,0767821807,"Having long been familiar with both theatrical and soundtrack recordings of ""Pal Joey"" I felt I was past due to view the movie. First and foremost pointing out that the film is dated would be a totally unwarranted and unjustified point. This film holds up well even after 50+ years. Some feel that Gene Kelly should have reprised his Broadway role in the movie but had Sinatra not been the force that he was it is highly likely that the movie itself would have never been made. Production values are maybe a bit below what I would have expected for a feature musical of the period but certainly there is nothing here to complain about. Sinatra is in fine voice with maybe the definative reading of ""Lady is a Tramp"", Hayworth for me was perfect, at least until the dream sequence just prior to the end of the film and Novak might have slighly unplayed her role but was quite beautiful and an excellent choice for the role. What others have failed to point out is that neither Hayworth nor Novak did their own singing. Jo Anne Greer was the wonderful singer of ""ZIP"" & ""Bewitched"" both credited to Hayworth's character while Judy Erwin handled Novak's vocals including ""My Funny Valentine"". (Trivia note: Rita Hayworth's ""Put the Blame on Mame"" from the movie ""Glida"" was actually song by Anita Ellis.) My only real complaint with the film was the dream sequence near the film's end. This sequence looks cheap in technique and quite honestly doesn't advance the story as I think was intended. All in all it's a very pleasant couple of hours with music most interested in this title will remember and a true star turn for all three of the headliners.",1189296000,,1648,4.6279863481228665
17188,3,0767821807,"This is a less than successful movie version of a hit 1940 Broadway musical Pal Joey, written by John O'Hara, with music and lyrics by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart. The musical is modified in several ways. Of the original 14 Rodgers and Hart songs, 8 remained with the movie. Sinatra sings classics such as; ""I Didn't Know What Time It was"" and ""I Could Write a Book,"" and ""The Lady Is a Tramp;"" and ""My Funny Valentine"" by Linda English is perhaps the best parts of the movie.

The story is about a singer named Joey Evans (Frank Sinatra), known for his womanizing ways is an out of work singer looking for a job in San Francisco. He meets a chorus girl named Linda English (Kim Novak), slowly, but steadily their friendship blossoms into love and romance. In the meantime, he develops a relationship with a wealthy widow named Vera Simpson (Rita Hayworth) to seek her help to finance his dream, ""Chez Joey"", a night club of his own. When the new night club is about to open, Vera finds about Joey and Linda, and she asks Joey to fire Linda, and he refuses, and Vera withdraws support for the night club. Joey and Vera use each other to the bitter end, ultimately Vera gives in, and Joey wins not only the club but also his prize, Linda. The movie has somewhat unrealistic ending; strong performance of Frank Sinatra overshadows the contributions of his costars Rita Hayworth and young Kim Novak.

The rest is not good..the script of the original Pal Joey has been completely re-written to accomodate Sinatra, and this means the thinnest of plots, the transposition of songs, elimination of numbers that make him look bad, and the suits and pants with football padding to disguise thinness and age.

This was the musical Sinatra wanted; he was sure he could carry a film, certainly a musical film. He had seen M Brando take the lead in Guys and Dolls,  and he reacted negatively toward Barndo all through the shoot of Guys and Dolls. Thank God Brando secured that lead!

Sinatra's voice in Pal Joey is very bad, his style of acting is no style at all, and his acting, even on its one note foundation,  is excruciating. He needed Gene Kelly and others to fill in when he made MGM musicals; he was never a star, and Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak eclipse him in every scene,proving that point.

Too bad, because this was a very good show, on Broadway, with Gene Kelly, who should have done this picture, or Marlon Brando, certainly Brando.

Rita is the fading star.  It was painful for me to watch the once dazzling love goddess reduced to playing the controlling widow.  The make up department probably had to work overtime trying to cover the circles under her eyes, and her hair and costumes are just bad.  Novak is the rising star, although I don't get the 50's obsession with bubble headed, busty, bleach blond bimbos.  It would help if she could act, but sadly her range is very limited. I truly believe they added the dog to help make her character sympathetic, since she was unable to convey it herself.  Then there is Frank just coasting on his charm and cool.  Doesn't seem plausible that a hep cat like him, who could bag any ""doll"", ""dame"" or ""mouse?"", would fall for either of these gals.

With that said, there is nothing wrong in having the cynic in us take a back burner for once, and watching a pretty decent feel-food movie with a fabulous cast, superb performances, and really excellent music.

  Perhaps the one downer in the film is Kim Novak who, even though she does a respectable job in ""My Funny Valentine"", still manages to irk. Reminiscent of a female Keanu Reeves (she was great in ""Vertigo"" for a reason: She just had to act doe-eyed and aloof. Perfect!) she is pretty annoying here. Oh, and lest we forget, the dream sequence is also burdensome, but it was almost a rite of passage before the ending of a whole lot of musicals, so we'll tolerate it here.

  As for the great aspects of the film, there are many: Rita Hayworth is excellent, with ""Zip"" as her defining moment in the film. Sinatra, of course, is simply fantastic, and elevates the ""Lady is the Tramp"" sequence to new heights of artistry.

Rita Hayworth does a sumptuous ""Zip"" (I love the way she uses her lavish Jean Louis gown in the number), and Kim Novak is absolutely stunning singing ""My Funny Valentine"". Novak was one of the loveliest and most underrated stars to ever grace the silver screen, and this was her second film with Sinatra, having done the dramatic ""The Man with the Golden Arm"" two years earlier.

The film only received some Oscar nominations (Art/Set Direction, Costume Design, Editing, Sound), but Sinatra did pick up a 1958 Golden Globe Best Actor/Musical-Comedy for his part as Joey, the womanizing, fast talking, con-man singer, who goes from town to town, leaving debts and broken hearts behind; Sinatra makes the most of the part, and one cannot imagine anyone else that could have played Joey to such perfection.

Also, before I drop the subject, the tune in this flick that floored all the other reviewers here (""The Lady Is A Tramp"") was written for a woman and has many more, and many cleverer choruses, and was written for ""Babes in Arms,"" not ""Pal Joey.""  Rita Hayworth (whose character, Vera Simpson, was just rich on the stage) plays a former stripper, not a former singer.  And her number, ""Zip!"" has words in it not even written by Hart!  The plot of the show (par for Hollywood) was bowdlerized, rewritten and destroyed for the flick, and left simplistic and with most of its songs gone.  Good ones too.  I've read O'Hara's libretto and I've heard the score.  The film is a colorful diversion (like the films of Porter's ""Can-Can"" and Loesser's ""Guys and Dolls,"" both also with Sinatra, both also eviscerated and abridged, though Loesser fared best of the three), it'll kill an hour and a half, Rodgers' tunes are done well (as well as non-singers can do them), O'Hara and Hart are rewritten with only the bare bones left, but in 2003, who really cares anymore.  Rodgers & Hart will be around when this shadow of one of their best shows (almost all their shows were their best shows, they were gems, but this one had a script by John O'Hara, sigh, what a waste) is forgotten.  Watch it, feel good (if you can stand Sinata; Novak and Hayworth are talented and beautiful), and then forget it.",1069113600,10,1681,4.514851485148514
17222,4,0767821807,"I've been trying to catch up on my old musicals lately.  It's a genre I didn't quite grow up with and have always been a little ambivalent about.  Never could get a handle of those ""walking down the street and bursting into song"" musicals.  But PAL JOEY is not of that particular mold.  Most of the songs are ""natural,"" in the sense that Joey is a nightclub singer.  Rita Hayworth's number, ""Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"" is the only number that doesn't take place in a club setting, but then again people in love have been known to sing to themselves in their boudoirs, so that's OK too.
Most of the reviews for this film stress the fact that the original Broadway play was considerably darker, and the main character much more of a louse than the cheeky nice guy Sinatra plays here.  Given the era (the late 50s), this is hardly surprising, and it's easy to guess how the edgier theatrical version actually played, even if you don't know the ""book.""
Sinatra is fine as the cheerful heel Joey.  Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak are lovely and sexy as rivals for Joey's affections.  Character actors like Barbara Nichols and Hank Henry milk their smallish roles for all they're worth.  Director George Sidney was a veteran of several classic musicals, including SHOW BOAT, TIL THE CLOUDS ROLL BY and THE HARVEY GIRLS, so he's on familiar turf here, and it shows.
The Rodgers and Hart score is great, but the numbers are not as many as you might hope.  Still there's ""My Funny Valentine,"" the aforementioned ""Bewitched...,"" and, the highlight, Sinatra's definitive take ""The Lady Is a Tramp.""  Well, worth 111 minutes of your time.",1053734400,33,1631,4.707746478873239
17223,4,0767821807,"Frank Sinatra is at his best in this film. He plays his own role, a singer in clubs. He starts out of money and everything and manages to get a position in a club in San Francisco. He has the opportunity to meet a lady-friend of his, an ex-singer who has become a very rich woman and he plays with the idea of a partnership with her. It will break on the simple fact that he is divided between this rich woman from his past and a new girl. The rich woman is jealous of the other and Joey is taken between the two without knowing how to choose or get out of the rivalry without being hurt. He will in the end make the good choice and move to Sacramento, leaving his past behind and going to new adventures. The film is brilliant, the actors and actresses are very good. It sure is not a deep film, but it is a very touching film where women are shown to be the real masters of the world.

7789057,3,0767821807,"The feature itself is of course great, but this DVD-ROM leaves quite a lot to be desired.  The image quality is poor, really looks like a streaming service and not one of the better ones -- maybe 480p at the most.  Fortunately, the sound is strong but I am not sure it is Stereo as stated on the pull-down menu, most likely only Mono 2.0.

This is a single-layer DVD-R and will not play on my Lenovo laptop.  Playing it in an Oppo BDP-95 gives a resolution that is mostly in the 3-4 Mbps bit rate range, only occasionally breaking into 5's.  Overall I would say that is very weak for a 2013 issue, I have several other discs that muster twice this, even on 2-for-1 DVDs.

I would recommend anyone considering this feature to get the 1999 manufactured DVD instead of this ""on demand"" rubbish.

7789058,2,0767821807,"Review of Pal Joey
Hot Toasty Rag, September 14, 2017

While this isn't my favorite musical, Pal Joey is definitely a must-see for fans of musicals or Frank Sinatra. Dozens of famous songsokay, not really dozenscame from this musical, including Bewitched, The Lady is a Tramp, My Funny Valentine, and I Could Write a Book. Although both Kim Novaks and Rita Hayworths singing voices were dubbed, the matches are pretty good. I didn't know Kim had been dubbed until I read the trivia.

Frankie plays Joey, a charmer with a bad reputation. Kim Novak, a chorus girl with a heart of gold, knows hes a player and tries to stay away. Rita Hayworth is a former chorus girl whose marriage has landed her in high society; an affair with the notorious playboy could damage her own reputation. While Frankie pursues both girls, all three sing the very memorable songs of Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart. If you like the songs, youll probably like the movie. I don't happen to like Rita Hayworth very much, but since I like the other two, the movie wasn't ruined for me.",1505347200,,1057,4.647058823529412
