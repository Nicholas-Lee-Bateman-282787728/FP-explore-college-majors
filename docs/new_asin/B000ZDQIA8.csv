I am using Amazons neat exchange program and have requested another copy.  The one workout we were able to do was a good workout and both my wife and I were challenged, even though I run 3 days a week.  The video and audio quality were good (only in stereo 2.0).  Jari mixes up the workout so you challenge yourself and there are 4 levels of difficulty for each workout.  It does not require equipment for the beginner level, but if you want a challenge you will need hand weights and a step.

3039754,5,B000ZDQIA8,"The Jari Love ""Get Ripped"" video package is awesome.  Several months ago, I purchased the single DVD called ""Slim & Lean"" and really liked it.  I have alot of exercise DVD's and have used them for years.  No other DVD has worked for me like this one did.  Now that I have the entire collection, I am getting in shape for this summer faster than I have ever done before.

3039755,5,B000ZDQIA8,"I have been doing the original Firm workout for years.  It is VERY effective but no longer available, and my VHS tape was on its last leg.  I tried several newer Firm programs, but found none of them were as good as the old ""yellow girl"".  I was looking for something similar to that original program.  A workout that used weights and focused lean bodies and muscle definition - no dancing, no gimmicks, no frills.  Get Ripped does exactly that!  I purchased the 4 pack and love that I can choose different workouts for different days.  They all are effective.  They all use weights.  They all focus on lean bodies with definition.  The instructor, Jari Love, is easy to follow and easy to listen to.  She doesn't fill the air with tons of annoying motivational bs.  This program can be easily tailored to suit a variety of fitness levels.  I have been using it for 3 weeks and have already increased my weight.  I have no doubt that I will be able to continue to increase weight to continue seeing results.  I highly recommend this series for those who want an effective hand-held weights or barbell workout at home.  I love it...I actually look forward to working out!",1238284800,6,1170,4.552884615384615

I use that one if I don't want to break a sweat and am a little tired that day.  Slim and Lean and Ripped to the Core are fairly good workouts.  The Get Ripped 1000 is the one I really have problems with.  First off there is no quick instruction on the exercise set coming up so by the time you watch it, you've lost a little time.  But the worst thing is this workout uses the step bench and is being turned from one way to the other for each use.  I don't have a lot of space and like I said it goes right into the set so I was constantly pausing the video to rearrange my step so I could see the TV to follow along.

Make sure you have some weights (I've been using 3 and 5 pounders because I'm a beginner)  They use a step  a lot too, but you don't have to have one.  It is not a high energy jumping around cardio workout.  The sets have A LOT of reps which get you sweating, your heart pumping and your muscles BURNING! There are always modifications and a short break between each set (nice to get a drink of water or stretch)  It's also set up so you can play the whole workout or pick and choose which set to do if you are short on time or want to focus on one area of your body.

8235377,5,B000ZDQIA8,"The product I received was great. I wanted to get back in shape and needed a DVD similar to body pump that I use to take YEARS ago in the gym. I only worked out with Get Ripped! (Phase 1 DVD). It's a great program, but if you are familiar with body pump, you should increase your weight. I started with 5lbs, however, I did feel the burn during the routine but no soreness the next day. So the second time I used 8 and 10lbs and immediately felt the difference. I can see how people can say its an easy workout routine, but I do more reps and often don't take breaks in between exercises. That will challenge anyone. In three months, I will review the second phase DVD (Slim and Lean).",1411948800,,685,4.157894736842105

Slim & Lean is my favorite.  You can purchase it separately.  All you need is free weights.  I use 2 10# for everything and am a moderately fit 49 yr. old female. She does alot of reps-like 40 or 50, but you choose the weight and you WILL see significant improvement in muscle development and toneness in your arms and legs.  She does almost no ab work, so I use a different dvd for that.  If you want simple, but feel the burn, get Slim & Lean.  If you also want cardio and a larger variety of moves for arms and abs, get the set.",1363824000,,692,4.119402985074627

I really love the 2 workouts ""Slim & Lean"" and and and ""To the Core"". Those 2 videos keep me challenged and always deliver. The cueing is fantastic and I love how they tell you what weights each person is using. The other 2 dvd's ""Ripped"" and ""Ripped 1000"" were not at all what I was expecting...""Ripped"" just wasn't very challenging for me and I found ""Ripped 1000"" to be very sporadic and the curing was horrible.
