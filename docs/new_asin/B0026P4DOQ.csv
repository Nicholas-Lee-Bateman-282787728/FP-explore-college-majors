3855655,5,B0026P4DOQ,"This is by far the best introduction to the family life of loons. You feel like you're right next to the nest. All the courtship activity, chick hatching and raising, and behavior of both the parents and chicks is beautifully shown. If you love seeing and hearing loons, or want to learn mor about them, this DVD is the one to have and watch, frequently.",1257897600,4,354,4.461538461538462
3855656,5,B0026P4DOQ,"Every film I've seen from Peter Roberts has opened my eyes to new wonders in the ""everyday"" world.  This film does it again around loons, birds you and I see on the pond near the bus stop, but rarely so deeply as through Peter's patient and insightful lens.",1257206400,4,257,4.354166666666667
3855657,5,B0026P4DOQ,I thought tis DVD was exceptional. The only thing I found dissapointing was that it was over so soon. I'll probably watch it weekly all winter!,1252972800,2,143,4.538461538461538
3855658,5,B0026P4DOQ,"I do not generally review items, however this was an exceptional video. Loons are so unique and this video depicted them in such a manner that I have not seen before. I have numerous collections of VHS & DVD, like Life on Earth, many National Geographic wildlife documentaries, etc. The beginning of the tape was an introduction, then the rest of the video was without commentary. It really was like sitting next to a Northern U.S.A. lake watching these birds with the only sounds that of their calls and other birds, with rain storms and other natural phenomena. The video included a small brochure, defining the various animal behavior activites being shown. I only wish there were more types of wildlife documentary by this group available.",1147392000,4,743,4.904761904761905
8353327,4,B0026P4DOQ,"While I understand the generous motives behind wanting to share with the public as many as possible of the rarely-viewed behaviors of a very reclusive and beautiful bird,  I always wish film makers would leave the animal mating scenes out of nature films--give the creatures some privacy and spare us all,  please.  This film puts it right at the beginning of the portion I first selected to watch.  Otherwise,  great photos,  great video,  great nature sounds,  and rarely seen footage of an exceptional and reclusive bird. Loons became a favorite of mine after taking a row boat in the black of night onto a cousin's small,  private northwoods lake,  where we sat in pitch blackness and listened to the loons.",1513296000,,711,4.85
8353328,2,B0026P4DOQ,"Content and audio are good but picture quality is poor in most of the footage. If you like high Def picture detail pass on this one. Disappointed, so will try to return to get my money back.",1454630400,,190,4.162162162162162

8353330,5,B0026P4DOQ,"Wonderful! Amazing video, really close views. As close to being there as you are going to get. Didn't want it to end.",1385251200,,117,4.363636363636363
8353331,5,B0026P4DOQ,I was looking for a recording of different types of loon calls and found that this was probably the best available.,1361059200,,115,4.523809523809524
8353332,5,B0026P4DOQ,Order arrived on time and am pleased with the video.  I will order more videos of this type in the future.  I watch them while exercising on staionary bikes and treadmills.  Helps the time go by faster.,1335398400,,202,4.405405405405405

8353334,5,B0026P4DOQ,Peter has created a nature film that is done in such a manner that one appreciates how extraodinary the everyday lives of loons can be.  The video is enchanting. Very calming in the midst of the hurley burley of everyday 21st century urbanlife. Refreshing.,1262217600,,256,4.818181818181818
8353335,5,B0026P4DOQ,Thanks to Peter Roberts for this beautiful and intimate look at a month in the life of these handsome birds as they mate and launch their offspring into world.  I would not have imagined ever seeing a fight between a loon and a beaver! The film maker's commentary is particularly interesting.,1260835200,2,292,4.7254901960784315
8353336,5,B0026P4DOQ,"A beautiful documentary account of one spring month in the lives of two common loons and their two offspring on a northern lake in the U.S. This vivid film brings the viewer cloer to the loons and some of their bird, reptile, and animal neighbors than a walker or boater is likely to get. Visions of light,sound, night, plants and weather. Perfect for all ages.",1258243200,3,361,4.569230769230769
