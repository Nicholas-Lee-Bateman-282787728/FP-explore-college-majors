8748910,5,B01AYLHSR2,"I have just spent a couple of hours enjoying a DVD of Tom Stevens offering master classes to some very fine musicians/trumpet players.  It was a treat to be reminded of the significance of fundamentals in our musical study, and to remember the voice of William Vacchiano talking to us about long notes, short notes, rhythm, phrasing and the importance of pacing and understanding where the phrases go.
Many of the trumpeters that studied with William Vacchiano in the later years (post 1975) were not exposed to these ""rules"", which dealt with those long and short notes along with pacing, spacing and phrasing as is pertinent to great musical collaboration.  I am personally thankful to Thomas Stevens for discussing these very important concepts, and helping the new generation of musicians to flourish more easily!

Bravo to Tom and to the production team!  I encourage all of you enthusiastic trumpeters, teachers, brass players to purchase this DVD!
The title of the DVD is Thomas Stevens On Musicianship, available on Amazon.

8748911,5,B01AYLHSR2,"An excellent DVD.  I am very glad to see that Thomas Stevens has found a way to preserve the essence of what William Vacchiano taught.
As a former student of Vacchiano,in the 1970s,  for me, there were rules, but they weren't spoken of as rules.  All the rhythmic inaccuracies, rushing, accents, note endings, etc., were corrected as I made them.
I think that because Vacchiano did not, at that time, define or tell us that there were rules.  Students from my generation, never thought that the corrections we were given or exercises we worked on, that were similar to examples on the DVD, were actually teaching us rules.  This was further confused because we had to sight read and transpose everything we played for him. If you were a student of his and you think back, you weren't only corrected for transposition and sight reading note errors.  Corrections were also for rhythmic inaccuracies, rushing, accents, note endings, phrasing, etc.  These corrections were the rules that Thomas Stevens is teaching. I do not think that anyone who wasn't taught the rules beforehand would have thought that what we were learning was a set of rules.
If you were a Vacchiano student and don't believe that there were rules, this is what I feel he stressed: playing musically within the context of rhythmic accuracy (while transposing and sight reading).  Mr. Stevens has found an amazing way to teach this.",1472515200,2,1399,4.8734177215189876
8748912,5,B01AYLHSR2,This video is a great resource for gaining a deeper understanding of how to interpret music correctly through the teachings of William Vacchiano. Now Thomas Stevens (one of Vacchiano's students) is passing this knowledge on to anyone willing to invest the time to study this recorded material. I found this video to be a thorough supplement to my doctoral studies with James Thompson at Eastman School of Music.,1471564800,2,411,5.0588235294117645

8748915,5,B01AYLHSR2,"In this DVD Thomas Stevens teaches the elements of musical style, invaluable to all musicians, not just trumpeters. He brings vast experience to seemingly-simple challenges of phrasing, extrapolating and developing Vacchiano's Rules (from the Paris Conservatoire via George Mager) in ways that inform the most advanced musiciansas well as any of us who teach, at whatever level. Besides holding the performer to account for his rendition of a composition, Stevens accomplishes this while  bringing out what the composer wanted, even when that composer didn't write clearly (i.e., Dukas' Sorcerer's Apprentice is really in 9/8not the written 3/8). Thomas Stevens' teaching is on a level of great literature at a time when most trumpet pedagogy is in what Herseth called ""the brass players' gutter.""",1459641600,12,797,5.479674796747967
8748916,5,B01AYLHSR2,"What an amazing DVD!  It might be arrogance or hubris on my part that I thought I knew the rules of musicianship that Roger Voisin taught us all when I was his student.  But this most excellent DVD, hosted by Thomas Stevens, has rebooted my knowledge.  Every trumpet player should see this DVD to remind us that we're musicians who play the trumpet. Mr. Stevens has much to say and demonstrate that is worth hearing. There's a lot packed into this DVD, so be prepared to take notes!!",1455580800,10,483,4.465909090909091
