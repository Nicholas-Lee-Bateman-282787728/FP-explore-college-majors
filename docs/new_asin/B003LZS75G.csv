4154204,5,B003LZS75G,"I gave this item as a Christmas gift to two of my work associates who are ""soccer fanatics"". Judging by their comments this is a DVD set that would satisfy the most hardened soccer enthusiast.",1294099200,,192,4.514285714285714
4154205,5,B003LZS75G,"This DVD set provides the only true definitive record of every World Cup Final ever played.

Since 1954, FIFA has hired a top-notch film crew to shoot the World Cup finals on 35mm film and create a documentary to tell the story of the Finals.  Not only do the films offer the best-looking footage of the football matches themselves but they do a nice job of capturing the feeling that surrounded each Finals, from the Brits in Hyde Park in 1966 to the Mexicans partying in the streets after escaping the group stage in 1970.

Sometimes the editing makes it tough to catch certain plays (there does seem to be the occasional goal that the cameras missed) and the narration sometimes makes it tough to follow the flow of group-stage games.  But nothing is perfect.

If you want to see a game from end-to-end, there are places on the internet that will supply full games on burned DVDs.  But if you want to educate yourself on the history of each World Cup, there is no better way to do it.

Also very cool, each of the 15 DVDs has a ""top 10 goals"" countdown special feature.  They break the countdowns into categories, so you can watch ""Top 10 Headed Goals"" or ""Top 10 Solo Goals"" and so on.  They are great fun.

Again, this collection may be less than ""complete,"" but it is absolutely definitive.  I look forward to adding the 2010 Official FIFA World Cup DVD to this collection when it's released in January.",1283126400,14,1409,4.486274509803922
4154206,3,B003LZS75G,"I just finished watching the movie covering the 1982 game. The director gives lots of camera shots to the dancing fans, players on the bus and in the change room, and long zoom shot of players running and falling.

After watching the opening 5 minutes, I have not seen a clear view of any goal! It makes me wonder, what story the director is trying to tell. It is obviously not for me, who want to see all the highlights of each key game including every goal.

I am not asking too much. The [...]'s highlight editing after each game of the 2010 World Cup is the perfect format. Unfortunately, you cannot find them in this series.",1280361600,12,629,4.367521367521367
4154207,5,B003LZS75G,A must for soccer fans.  So much content and all done right.  I loved watching the games from the 50's and 60's and seeing the stars that made the game at their best.,1279584000,3,166,4.0
8399941,4,B003LZS75G,"First of all, I should warn you that the DVDs in this collection don't contain the SportsCenter-style stream of highlights of every World Cup match throughout history. Many fellow reviewers have expressed disappointment about this. However, this type of storytelling about sporting events is a rather recent invention, so it's not surprising that it's absent on most of these discs. You might not get 100% of the game content you would want, but in most cases there are enough highlights (mainly goals, but near misses too) and descriptions of the tournament's progression to figure out what's happening.

What you get instead of SportsCenter-inspired stream of highlights, starting with the 1954 World Cup (the 1930, 1934, 1938, and 1950 World Cups are presented in short films), are full-length feature films made by directors hired by FIFA. Each director (and some do it better than others) tries to tell the story of their World Cup through the cinematic conventions of their time. This means that, for example, the film on the World Cup in 1954 will contain music from this era, a narrator from this era, a silly subplot reminiscent of 1950s films and early television programming, etc.

This, admittedly, can be quite annoying for the modern viewer, but from a certain perspective it can fascinating too. For example, besides the game content, you get the following ""bonuses"":

1954 - a corny story about a very young kid who has World Cup fever and is secretly given money by his mother, enabling him to run away from home to try to make it to the final game by boat, motor scooter, and what can only be described as some very risky hitchhiking

1958 - insights into a few of the countries' base camps (the contrast between the Mexican, the Brazilian, and the German camps is quite large) and clips of the German captain responding to lots and lots of fan mail back in the day when players were supposed to be gentlemen and role models (or at least project that image, because the scene was probably set up by the director)

1962 - revelations that even 50 years ago, FIFA was the master of product placement--there are scenes of people watching Philips televisions in the streets, fans taking a break from the action with ice cold Coca-Colas, and the Chilean national team being visited before their semifinal match with a representative from adidas who had some innovative new shoes for them to try on; also, lots and lots of casual sexism (Sepp Blatter would approve of this film)

1966 - shots of England during the 1960s during all the cultural upheaval, a film with psychedelic-influenced music and crazy 1960s sound effects, a view of the sport when it was played in the ""good ol' English manner"" with dirty tackles galore, injuries, and incessant fouling

1970 - a reprise of the trite ""little kid wants to make it to the final game by any means necessary storyline"" that featured so prominently in the 1954 film--it even looks like they hired a very similar child actor who looks much more Swiss (site of the 1954 WC) than Mexican (site of the 1970 WC)

...and so on...

If you can imagine a world where they aren't one-hour preview shows prior to every World Cup game that contain copious shots of the fans, the scenery, technical analysis of the games, extended features on each team's star players, and all that other stuff that borders on the obsessive-compulsive, then I think you'll understand a little better why the majority of the DVDs in the collection contain not only the game highlights, but also the atmosphere surrounding the games and the broader storylines that surrounded each World Cup. These DVDs are made for the common fan in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, who would be lucky to have the chance to watch the game on television and might only get to read about the tournament in the newspapers the next day.",1404777600,5,3849,4.784638554216867
8399942,5,B003LZS75G,This has been a gift for our son-in-law who is an American soccer lover. He appreciated this gift very much.,1377820800,,108,4.45
8399943,2,B003LZS75G,"First of all, these are Official World Cup Films that previously had been only available on VHS (except 2006 - on dvd). Films are not fantastic in their content, but still a great viewing, and a must for any football(soccer) fan. Rather than describe the films that some other reviewers already did, i'll talk about dvd quality. All these dvds (with exception of 2006) are poor VHS to DVD transfers. The content of the films is done in movie style and not sharp-image documentary. When it was transferred to DVDs it was done without any disire to create a decent product. Studio just scanned the tapes through digital filters, slapped a decent Main Menu, added tiny bonus features and named it a DVD. While watching these disks, the image gets blurry, then somewhat better, then you see very soft spots on the film, then sounds fluctuates from high to low... Every time there is high paced motion scene, you see shadows and blur..very frustrating...and i spent hours playing with dvd player(s) and tv settings. I had the whole collection on vhs with the quality much better than it is now; and when i personally transferred them disks they looked as good as those vhs. Off course stupidly enough i got rid of those disks when i bought this set. I have to say that these dvds look decent on old CRT tv sets, but look bad on 32""+ lcds. Price for the set (was $60 when i got it) could not be any better ($4 per disk), the physical set looks good (there are 4 dvd cases that hold 2,4,4,4 disks each) inside of a brief-case like paper container with a handle. It's not as good looking as European versions, but that's not so important as it's contents. Somehow, in the past month, all these sets disappeared from the market - either production company pulled them off shelves by planning to re-release it before World Cup 2014 with the inclsion of World Cup 2010 disk, or there are some rights issues and FIFA will look for another ditributor. I would recommend this set if you are not so picky about video quality. But if you are football dvd collector and looking for great quality product, wait for better version (if that will ever happen).",1375142400,2,2139,4.572916666666667

8399945,5,B003LZS75G,"i am a soccer player and a coach and this collection is a jewel for me,the great games are on it,happy to own it.",1338854400,,113,3.75
8399946,1,B003LZS75G,"Quite disappointing. Of the games (only some games), you see the goals and nothing else: no tricks, no dribbling, no tackles, no passes, no saves--a very superficial idea of what soccer is about. Moreover, a lot of the footage concerns what happened outside the pitch: but nothing interesting is shown or revealed. The narration is embarrassingly boring and banal, and the clips are cobbled together in a very uninventive, unattractive, amateurish way. Not to mention the elevator music that somebody chose as a soundtrack--it has no connection whatsoever with the images and does not express the spirit of soccer. With its resources, and even without them, FIFA should have produced something much much better. In these DVDs there is no creativity, no professionalism, no soul: just the intention of exploiting to the utmost our passion for soccer. Do not purchase this set.",1331769600,2,875,5.169014084507042
8399947,5,B003LZS75G,"I've only gotten through 1954, but so far it is quite good. They've opted to play up some of the charm of each era to complement replaying match highlights, and especially for the older tournaments, they do really well to show many of the goals, tell an interesting story, and impart historical context/information. A great purchase for any football fan!",1331424000,,354,4.916666666666667
8399948,5,B003LZS75G,My husband enjoys these videos of the all of the World Cup matches; I am very pleased with the price and with how much he likes these!,1299369600,,134,4.0
8399949,2,B003LZS75G,"I was disappointed by the content of this collection. Granted, I should have done more research into what was actually contained in the DVDs. I was looking for a recap of every goal, both in the group stage an in the playoffs (or, at least, a bit of every match). Instead, this series, for the most part, shows only highlights of the main games of each world cup. Team celebrations, arrivals at the airport, bus rides, fans partying, locker room talks, and, in some DVDs, even the personal stories of stadium workers are heavily covered in these documentaries. Nothing wrong with that if you are interested in the ""behind the scenes"" aspects of what goes on in these torunaments. In that case, you may find these DVDs interesting. If, like me, you want to see the goals and summaries of the matches, you probably do not want to purchase this product.",1298332800,40,850,4.635761589403973
8399950,4,B003LZS75G,A great compilation of FIFA history and a wonderful keepsake for soccer fans. The dvds come in a beautiful sturdy package complete with a plastic handle on the box.,1296086400,,164,4.689655172413793
