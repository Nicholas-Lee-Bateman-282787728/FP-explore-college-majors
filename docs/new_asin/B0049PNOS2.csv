4291895,1,B0049PNOS2,I bought 11 DVDs on ebay at the same time as I bought these. They only cost $20 for 11 and arrived before Xmas. These took 7 seven weeks longer to arrive and each DVD cost $20.- so expensive for such bad service.  I will never shop amazon again,1359936000,,244,3.979591836734694
4291896,1,B0049PNOS2,"Although Amazon posted the format as NTSC, the version of this DVD I received is PAL so would not play on (North American) standard DVD player.

My DVD and Blue Ray player don't play PAL format so I was not able to view the DVD, I am really mad.

I bought two as gifts, how is this possible? selling a European format in America? but now Amazon show for this produc: ""Imported and PAL Format"".

But is too late for me :'o(",1328832000,,422,4.121951219512195
4291897,5,B0049PNOS2,"OMG, I love this guy. I must have been Italian in a former life! Although I don't understand Italian, I love all of his songs.  I have googled translations on a few of the songs, my favorite being Un attimo di pace (the version in his album 9 is better, though), with Appunti e note being a very close second!  This album is my latest purchase and it's great. Can't recommend it enough.

I'm sending one to my nephew who visited Italy several times.  Hope he likes him as much as I do.",1319932800,,485,4.182795698924731
4291898,5,B0049PNOS2,"Although Amazon posted the format as NTSC, the version of this DVD I received is PAL so would not play on (North American) standard DVD player.
My Phillips DVD player plays both formats so I was able to view the DVD, but some customers may not have this option.  Many people in the USA have only NTSC format DVD players.

Other than that one issue, the performance, concert, audio and DVD quality is GREAT!",1300752000,3,406,4.472972972972973
4291899,5,B0049PNOS2,"I have been Eros's fan for almost 20 years, and it seems everything he does just has to be perfect, and every release is better than the previous. This concert is incredibly amazing, the visual effects, the sound, the crowd, the musicians is just great.  Just to give a better idea of how impressive are the visual effects in this concert, the director is the same one that the cirque du soleil used in Las Vegas for the Criss Angel's Believe show, the Canadian Serge Denoncourt.

Anyways, I recommend this DVD to anyone that wants to enjoy a couple of hours of great music and great stage and visual effects.",1300320000,4,609,4.527272727272727
4291900,4,B0049PNOS2,"I love Eros, he is the most talented singer I have ever heard... I would have loved the new DVD, had I been able to play it on any of my DVD players (have 3) in my home.  I was able to get it to play on my computer, which, I was able to connect to my TV, to see it on a larger screen, and get the surround sound.. Otherwise I would have rated it as 5 stars. The music and performance delivers!!! I felt like I was seeing him live once again.",1298764800,,441,3.6914893617021276

8419202,5,B0049PNOS2,An excellent concert  Live.  Very good presentation of songs with great musicians and back-up singers . Almost every song performed were ones I had hoped to hear.. Eros is a very good songwriter and singer. Many of the ballads  are very moving and speak  of his  life experences.  I highly recommend  either the CD or DVD  which has 1 or 2 more songs and additional material.,1379894400,,375,4.575757575757576
