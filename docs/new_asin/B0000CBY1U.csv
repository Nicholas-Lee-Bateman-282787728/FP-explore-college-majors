1918083,1,B0000CBY1U,"Listen up movie goers this movie has to be the absolute worst movie i've ever seen. And i truly mean that. When i say boring i mean it. For the few reviews that say there is some type of creative side to this movie,what are they smokin? This movie is nothin but two guys walkin around some harsh terrain lost,rarely saying anything, thats it!
Theres nothing else. Some people say you need alot of patience to watch this movie I've watched Godsford Park at least 5 times i know patience'this movie had to be made just to see what matt damom and the afflecks can get away with,example is myself i paid full price plus tax on this awful movie to see, well ""nothing"" i guess is the most appropriate word i can use on this website. Please lay off this one!!!!",1069632000,9,754,4.316901408450704
1918084,2,B0000CBY1U,"...comes the most pretentious film of 2002:  a movie about two guys walking.  No kidding.  I expected a little more from Matt Damon and Gus Van Sant, perhaps I shouldn't have.  One guy actually wrote a review here that is probably longer than the script.  Oh, I can see the pitch now...
Damon (on phone): Hey Gus, it's Matt, I've got another idea for a movie.
Van Sant (on phone): Great Matt, let's hear it.
Damon: Okay, Casey and I will get lost in the desert.
(pause)
Van Sant: Then what happens?
Damon: What do you mean?  That's it.
Van Sant: Brilliant.  When did you want to do it?
Damon: I'm not sure.  This will take a lot of planning and a large budget.
Well, it didn't have a large budget, but I couldn't help myself.  I just don't understand what they were going for here.  The shots last an eternity, the dialogue is stiff and pointless, and nothing happens.  This would have maybe (I stress maybe) been a good subject for a short film, but this thing is 103 minutes long.  In fact the only entertainment I got out of this film was writing this review.  Unless you have a fetish for Matt Damon and Casey Affleck or desert vistas...BEWARE!",1069459200,6,1148,4.38388625592417
1918085,1,B0000CBY1U,"This is possibly the longest, most boring movie I've ever seen.  It does not get any better after the LONG opening shots.  The scenery is gorgeous, but I rent movies to be entertained!  Neither Matt, nor Ben nor Casey (Ben-Casey, who chose these names?  What were they thinking?) can save this one.",1069113600,7,298,4.673076923076923
1918086,5,B0000CBY1U,"Love it or hate it, Gerry seems to be a movie that elicits lengthy pseudo-theoretical justification or excoriation.  Most of these explanations and deconstructions have more words than the movie itself.  (They certainly have more syllables.)  If you're looking for a movie you can love or hate very loudly to all your cinema-illiterate friends, this is it.
Director Gus Van Sant and Casey Affleck have mentioned video games as one idea/inspiration for Gerry. (90% of the film's dialogue is in one fireside conversation about a SimAthens-style game, Zeus: Master of Olympus.)  People spend hours trudging through a CG desert or signing virtual treaties with neighboring tribes or whatever without feeling any need to interpret or rationalize their actions afterward.
Why not try this approach with Gerry?  Then decide if a game-like film is as engrossing as playing a game yourself or as excruciatingly boring as standing by while _someone else_ plays.",1068681600,10,951,5.271523178807947
1918087,4,B0000CBY1U,"Gus Van Sant is not afraid to follow up a big Hollywood movie with a low budget indie production and ""Gerry"" is definitely unlike any movie I've ever seen before. Some directors, like Steven Soderbergh, will do something as commercially appealing and popular as ""Ocean's Eleven"" - then follow it up with something as commercially unappealing as ""Solaris"". Van Sant has done the same 180 degree turn here as well. Sure to incite anger from casual moviegoers expecting the ""new Matt Damon movie"", ""Gerry"" is a 103 minute long movie that has virtually no dialogue. And the only two characters on screen are Matt Damon and Casey Affleck - both named Gerry. The movie opens with a wordless scene featuring the two Gerrys driving in the desert until they stop at a rest area. Finally around ten minutes in we are witness to the first dialogue between the two Gerrys. They embark on foot down a wilderness trail where they anticipate finding ""the thing"". We never find out what that ""thing"" is because the pair end up getting lost before finding it. The next 90 or so minutes is a nearly dialogue free collection of scenes showing the two guys trying to find their way back to the car. The beauty of a film like ""Gerry"" is that its minimalism is the silent third character. Blended in with the environment and weather, the two Gerrys are faced with thirst and starvation. The ending is shocking, especially in context of the location where it occurs. This is not a film for everyone. In fact, over half of the people in the theatre abandoned the screening by the halfway point. Whole groups of people left the theatre at one time, unable to endure this movie. Don't go to ""Gerry"" expecting ""The Bourne Identity"" or ""Good Will Hunting"". This is not that kind of movie. The amazing acting from Damon and Affleck would be difficult for an actor to carry off but these guys did it. Damon really demonstrates his skills near the end in a wordless scene that relies solely on his face and body language. Van Sant deserves credit for even considering a project like this. Will you be able to appreciate it, however? That is the question...",1065398400,4,2125,4.639257294429708
1918088,4,B0000CBY1U,"...There is talk of little plot, but it seemed to me that the movie was about man vs. nature on different levels. There's Damon and Affleck's battle against the elements of desert; then there's their battle against human nature. I read a Gus Van Sant interview where he mentioned that the movie could be in part about the masculine/feminine battle within each person, with Damon representing the more aggressive (male) half and Affleck representing the more sensitive (female) half. That makes some sense considering both characters go by the name gerry (a word used in many ways in the film). Battling for survival in the desert, which part of human nature wins?
When I saw the movie there were eight people in the theater, and two walked out 20 minutes into it (they were definitely on a date, so one can only imagine the conversation in the car afterward... ""uh thanks. How about I give you a call instead next time...""). The movie was indeed hard to get through, but it had just enough movement to keep me involved. I think it was because we have been programmed by today's movie to have everything hit us over the head, either with music, dialogue or action. My two favorite scenes are: the beautiful opening sequence with the piano and cello and the camera on the hood of the car just showing them driving to the trail, both lost in their thoughts; and when they're walking for like 6-7 minutes and you just see their heads bob and hear their feet crunch... sometimes in unison and sometimes breaking apart. It came at, I think, a crucial time when the survival instinct of each person was starting to take over and Damon began distancing himself from Affleck.
The only reason this movie doesn't get five stars for me, is that you're supposed to believe right away that Damon and Affleck are good friends, yet I could never feel that between them. It made me wonder, why the heck are these two guys even hanging out, let along going for a walk in the desert? Perhaps that was intentional. In a movie like this, everything is left up for debate.
What else can be said? You've got to see this movie to believe it. Unfortunately, a big TV screen won't do the film's cinematography justice. Seeing the huge, wide-open shots in the theater definitely played a part in hypnotizing you. it's one of the more daring movies you'll ever see. If you're tired of action flicks that blitz your senses with techno music and CGI fight scene after fight scene, or are sick of cliche dialogue and storylines, consider Gerry. It was made to slow down your world and try to find meaning where there is hardly any noise or words. It's incredible this movie was financed by someone, but I'm glad it was. It's a movie that starts to make sense days after you've seen it and can process the experience.",1063324800,20,2785,4.594377510040161
1918090,5,B0000CBY1U,"One of my favorite films. If you like other Gus Van Sant films, then this will be a favorite. Otherwise, you'll likely hate it.

1918095,1,B0000CBY1U,"Before I met her, my wife saw this at Sundance and mentioned it a few times as a weird one. She said this movie was just two guys who called each other Gerry walking and talking while getting lost on a hike.

I said, ""that sounds terrible, I have to see it.""

And I ordered it up.

I would estimate I've seen around 1,500 films in my life and this has to rank as one of the ten worst I've ever seen. If I had seen in it in the (non-Sundance) theater, I would have walked out. Instead, I watched the first twenty minutes, then skipped ahead repeatedly until I got to the SALT FLATS scene near the end (as I currently live in Utah, I like to see anything filmed on that crazy part of the state).

According to IMDB, this film runs for about 100 minutes, and features exactly 100 shots, resulting in an average shot length of about 60 seconds. To me, that's the most interesting thing about it.

All I can figure is that Casey, Matt and Gus wanted a vacation to Jordan and Argentina and wanted someone else to pay for it. Otherwise, there was no need to film this totally tedious trek anywhere but the closest field + forest.",1400198400,3,1122,4.2
1918096,1,B0000CBY1U,"This is the worst movie (if thats what you want to call it) I have ever bought. There just isn't anything positive to say about it. No story, poor quality, no captions, no NOTHING.",1388448000,,180,4.323529411764706

The movie was done so poorly it was almost completely unwatchable. I am ashamed to say I had to attempt to watch it three times to see it all. I kept fast forwarding hoping it would get better. Come on! It's not that deep. It's not particularly intelligent and it sure isn't groundbreaking. And I think Matt Damon and Casey Affleck slept through the whole thing. The best I could do was get some good one liners out of it like, ""Make me a dirt mattress."" I may buy some of these to give away as gag gifts for Christmas.",1387411200,2,676,4.248062015503876
1918098,5,B0000CBY1U,"The title alone captures much of the essence of this movie and all the cinematic genius present therein. My favorite aspect is the sound and dialog. Make sure you watch it without distraction, perhaps with headphones or a good surround sound system...and make sure to crank it. The movie should play without interruption so you can get a full appreciation of the suspense in this masterpiece. The cinematography is as equally compelling as the sound. I believe it was shot at 3 locations (Europe, South America, and Utah) and each time I watch Gerry I'm inspired to visit the desolate and dynamic geography portrayed in the story. I have to be careful not to say too much about the movie, because I don't want to be a spoiler. Even a minor mention of dialog or a plot may give it away or ruin your enjoyment of the Gerry experience. Usually the mention of the title within movie dialog is a red flag for movie quality, and the earlier it is mentioned is inversely associated with quality.

1918106,1,B0000CBY1U,"Would you like to walk through the desert with Matt Damon and Casey Affleck for two hours while neither of them said a word?

Well, maybe you would.  Who knows, but watching this movie about Matt Damon and Casey Affleck walking through the desert for two hours without saying a word would be more like...walking through the desert by yourself for two weeks, while having enough wasps to weigh the same as Matt Damon and Casey Affleck stuffed into your shirt and pants.

I have the utmost respect for Ben Affleck for deciding not to play any substantial role in this nonsense when his buddy Matt and his brother Casey decided it would be a great idea to film their next nature hike and pass it off as a feature film.

The worst part is that this ""film"" created yet another opportunity for hipsters to see ""hidden artistic value and meaning"" in what I can only take as Matt Damon and Casey Affleck's practical joke on the moviegoing public.  It is the film equivalent of Guns n' Roses' ""The Spaghetti Incident.""

1918110,1,B0000CBY1U,"""Gerry"" is a deeply symbolic movie filled with meaning, depth, richness and a compelling directorial vision. Rarely does such a movie grace our eyes.

But none of that matters. Why?

Because this movie is so boring it will make you want to stab yourself in the head with a craft knife. Gus Van Sant's third ""death"" movie stretches out a five-minute plot to a full-length movie, filled with talking, walking, sitting, talking, walking, and... MORE WALKING. It's like watching home videos of two strangers backpacking.

In a sense, I have already described the plot. Two young men, both named Gerry (Matt Damon and Casey Affleck), drive out into the desert to look at a ""thing."" Then they decide they don't want to see the thing, and so instead of driving back to civilization and going to a bar like SANE people, they... keep walking.

And walking. And walking. They walk through a field. They follow animal tracks. They walk through more desert. And when they get lost, their desperation leads them to violence. Here's the abridged summary: ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZSNORESNOREZZZZZZZZZZZZ.

In a sense, I can understand what Gus Van Sant was doing -- ""Gerry"" has some intriguing ideas about how endless boredom, monotony and disorientation can warp our minds, and it is graced with eerie, almost otherworldly scenery with rolling clouds, pale soft skies and ethereally alien desertscapes. And since this is based on real life, it allows us to explore the darker facets of human nature.

But it's JUST. SO. BORING. It actually feels like you're lost in a desert... and that is BORING.

It's just ten-minute-long shots of Affleck and Damon shuffling slowly across the sand, driving the car, sitting on rocks, and watching the sun rise. Every time the monotony starts to bore you into a hypnotic stupor, something happens to jolt you out of it, reminding the viewers that they are watching a movie that is as interesting as watching paint dry. On grass. On top of a melting glacier.

And maybe that is what Van Sant was going for. Maybe he wanted us to feel bored, frustrated and empty... but he also gives viewers absolutely nothing else. It's just an endless, mindless trudge across the desert, which doesn't really make you think about anything deeper than ""PLEASE GOD, KILL THEM BOTH.""

In conclusion, ""Gerry"" is like watching someone's vacation videos... if they decided to do an endurance trek, and forgot to turn off the camera first. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.",1306886400,4,2450,4.95609756097561

1918114,2,B0000CBY1U,"Gerry is Gus Van Sant's first attempt to break into the art house style of creative and original storytelling and simplistic filmmaking. It tells a rather disturbing story of two young men who go out into the wilderness on a hiking trip for no particular reason it seems other than to perhaps see something interesting. Eventually their interest subsides and they both decide to head back home, but before long they slowly begin to realize that they are lost in the desert and cannot find their way out. Still, they continue to exchange small talk and they continue to keep their high hopes while their fears that they may likely die slowly becomes an inescapable possibility.

I really like what Gus Van Sant has done here. He has told a simple story about two young men who have, through their own simplistic mannerisms, gotten lost. Van Sant manages to hold the intensity of the idea together perfectly. However, the story and the context that this idea is put in is far from perfect. I hate to admit it, especially because Gus Van Sant is one of my favorite filmmakers, but this film really sucks in a way that made me remarkably angry. Don't listen to what the critics say about the man-vs-wild aspects or the hardship of friendship or the destruction of the human psyche under stress. I'm going to go on record by saying that this film doesn't have any of that in any form. There's no imagery to suggest that the film's characters are suffering from anymore than they should. There's no attempts at symbolism or developments or metaphysical storytelling. There is nothing. This film is a joke, and it's sad to say that because I think that Gus Van Sant actually does take this idea seriously. I think that he does believe that he has crafted something of prime genius here. The problem is that he is fooling himself even more than he is fooling the audience, at least from my standpoint. The film doesn't have celebrate joy of human existence. The film doesn't allow us any sort of hope for anything. The film isn't intense. The film isn't interesting. The film isn't the slightest bit emotional or original. Instead, it's just an hour and forty minute bore of horrible improvised dialogue, good cinematography, and no premise. The experimental nature of a film won't mean anything if there isn't any sort of ambition for plot, but this film lays it all on the absolute minimum of minimum storytelling and as a result, for me anyway, it is painful to watch.

So what did I like about it? Well, the opening shot is absolutely majestic. The shot of the car on the road with the beautiful piano music and the wide open sky is absolutely magnificent. There are also a handful of interesting shots of the desert and of the characters in the desert, two of which I have provided screenshots of in this review, that lingered in my mind after the film ended. I also really appreciate Van Sant's use of sound in this film. It's very subtle, but it really speaks for itself. The performances of Matt Damon and Casey Affleck are both very good. The mood that the early scenes in the film generate definitely help it grip the audience's attention. There are also a few scenes of dry comedy that help to generate some sort of energy to the film. All this definitely may trick the audience into thinking that there's more going on here than there ultimately really is.

Some have called the film a masterpiece, hailing it as a work of pure cinema and ambition. I can agree with that to some extent. Others call the film one of the worst independent films of the 2000s. I don't think I would go that far. There are a lot of horrible films that came out before and after Gerry that have been insufferable. Gerry is, however, a failure. It's a film in which it's ambitions are lost in the technicality of the sublime lack of energy, truth, storytelling, and art. It's not fascinating, challenging, entertaining, or even remotely abstract. It's just a dire piece of pointless nothingness that will only hold your attention if you are interested in unusual films about the desert, and even then I can think of films that work better. Gerry is a film that angered me and depressed me. I've seen it four times now and each time I feel even more and more robbed. I can't put this film down enough.

Pointless, postcard scenery, long, meaningless shots of driving, walking, more walking (like in Elephant) and sparse, boring, nutty dialog. And about as far away from reality as you can get (except, see Elephant).

Why would two modern, supposedly smart, educated guys go for a hike in the desert without water, a compass, hats, snacks and a map? They brought their ciggies and lighters though.  The scene where Affleck jumps off the rock into the ""dirt mattress"" was surely just to show off.

Van Sant manipulates on screen silence and long tracking shots the way Chopin fashioned a nocturne, stillness and space become as important as exposition and dialog.
 The film is a masterwork of minimalism and an acknowledgment of the thin veil hanging between the comforts of our everyday existence and the propinquity of abject loss and creeping torpor.

A lack of dialog that becomes oppressive in it's absence and often conveys great visceral meaning when coupled with the long, unobtrusive, tracking shots favored by Mister Van Sant.

Every single scene is 5-10 times longer than necessary. The videography is not good enough to sustain such a slow pace, and at times the visuals are so obvious that the film appears to be the project of an overly-ambitious film school freshman. The dialogue is inane, I kept thinking ""Dude, where's my car ?"" while listening to the excruciating meaningless banter between Affleck and Damon. Realism was severely lacking.

MATT DAMON and CASEY AFFLECK get out of their car and hike through the desert. That's the plot. We see endless close-ups of Damon and Affleck as they trudge in silence across sunlit landscapes, breathing hard, walking fast at the start, even playfully running before they realize they're lost. Fatigue soon sets in and we're treated to more close-ups and long shots of the two men as they trudge endlessly through barren desert without uttering more than a few words.

The story really has no resolution and what motivates Damon to put an end to Affleck in a sudden burst of energy is never probed or even hinted at. The final scene has Damon discovering a highway and riding off in a car. The End.

Nothing about the film could ever induce me to watch it again. It's almost as if the ghost of Andy Warhol is hanging over every foot of film, composed so often of endless shots of two men walking, walking and walking with nothing else in the frame but two solitary figures.

Well, not exactly ... but at least we have Matt Damon meets Casey Affleck in a stunningly gorgeous but darkly enigmatic existential wander piece.  Two guys named Gerry drive out to the desert for a hike, get lost and wander into the wastelands without water or food or any clear sense of who they are.  Are they the same person?  Is this an allegory about getting lost, torn between identities, finding oneself compelled to choose?  Is there significance to the fact that Gerry (Damon) ends up wearing a nomad's turban and Gerry (Affleck) wears a gold star pinned to his shirt?  why does Gerry (Affleck) explain to Gerry (Damon) how he sacked Thebes and then got his own army wasted for not having enough horses?  are they classics students and is this a game they're playing or is the filmmaker aiming to make this contemporary story timeless with classical allusions?  [EDIT: since writing this I've been told that they are discussing strategies for the video game&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prince-of-Persia/dp/B001ASJISG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prince of Persia</a>]  What is their relationship -- are they brothers, friends, associates, lovers, are they two sides of the same person?  Is it important that they not only call each other Gerry, but use ""gerry"" as a verb which seems to mean things like ""turning around"", ""messing up"", ""doing something"" -- as in ""we gerry'd off towards the animal tracks""?  I don't know and it's hard to say.  What I like about the enigmas in this film is that (in spite of the minimalist simplicity that pervades the film) there are so many of them and while it would be easy to ascribe symbolic and allegorical meaning to many aspects of the story, it would be hard to come up with a story that makes sense of everything.  One could equally say: ""this story has no meaning,"" and ""it is oversaturated with meanings.""

That leads me to think that the ""point"" of the film is not to ""mean something.""  Meaning is overrated, making sense is not the only thing a film can do.  Even where I can't pin down a satisfying interpretation to this film as a whole (which is not to say I don't have several ideas about what it might mean) I can definitely say it is full of feeling and beauty.  Tension, foreboding, confusion, levity, ennui, anger, celebration, humor, are all present in this film -- at least for the viewer who has the patience and good sense to dispense with the effort to make it all mean something.  There are some stunning and even shocking scenes here: I was jolted by a scene in the desert  where the Gerrys are walking along a sand dune just at dawn.  In the darkness you could only see their heads bobbing on the horizon that separates sky from sand, and they appeared to be walking towards the audience; slowly, imperceptably, as the sky brightened and the sand began to pick up light something didn't seem quite right, until suddenly it was clear that they were walking the opposite direction, away from the camera.  Directions become meaningless; the desert topology intermingles with the landscapes of dream and memory.  Not since Werner Herzog's Fata Morgana has the desert and its perceptual mystery been captured with such intensity.

This is, really, an experimental film -- and a brilliant one -- of the kind that rarely appears in theaters and much more often in museum installations: compare this with Andy Warhol's 12 hour long Empire (which features the Empire State Building over a 12 hour period) or his Sleep (featuring Warhol's lover sleeping over a period of five hours) and this film begins to look like ""Speed"".  Gus van Sant's stroke of brilliance is to make an experimental film with movie stars, so that it would actually be seen by a decent-sized audience.  It really deserves to be seen, even though it will bore many to tears, because it holds a number of surprises and mysteries and beauties -- some of the most enigmatic and powerful images of nature I've seen in film -- for those who have the patience.

It's simplicity, emotional music and long scenes which mostly comprise of just the two characters and the environment makes you the viewer, feel as though you are one of the characters. You are experiencing it, walking along side of them as it were.
The camera movements really generate a feeling of the vast terrain, at one point it rotates fully and completely around the character, taking its time. Through the eye of the camera we are in the center of the landscape and we see how truly overwhelming it is.
It is often quiet but this makes room for us to contemplate what they must be thinking, or what would we be thinking. We are directed into our own internal dialog. It's very psychological. The dialog between the two characters is exactly what you would expect from a couple of guys lost and struggling with physical/emotional meltdowns. It's not showy, it's thought provoking. I was impressed with it's honesty.
We watch them walk, as time passes, they are treading slower and slower, within timeframes that compared to a typical movie would be an eon, but this lends to our experiencing what it would be like to walk that long around the desert. It is quite incredible that such sparse content can exude such an overwhelming physical and emotional reaction from the audience. It is a skillful and powerful production. It takes real talent to make a movie that doesn't need a lot to say a lot.

It seemed that the director's only goal in shooting scenes was to do so in such a way that was opposite the conventions of any respectable film school. For example, there was a shot of Damon and Affleck just walking. And walking. And walking. And not a word of dialogue. It felt as if it went on for 10 minutes. As I was watching, I couldn't believe the trying-to-be-arty pretentiousness of this scene. It accomplished the exact opposite of what Van Sant was shooting for: it bored me and pissed me off - pissed me off because I realized immediately that there would be several Art School Confidential types who would have mini epiphanies over what they perceived to be ""radical"" direction.

And what was the deal with that scene early on in the movie in which either one or both actors, the foreground, the background and sometimes all of the aforementioned, are out of focus? Is this an arty experiment, bad camera work or just bad filmmaking? I was completely nonplussed. It seemed like the director did it purposefully to create some sort of mood but what mood exactly that was is anybody's guess. The scene didn't work. It hurt my eyes. You watch it and let me know what I missed.

And what can I say about Casey Affleck? He mumbled his lines, has no screen presence and not a shred of charisma. And his complete lack of talent is all the more amplified because the entire cast is comprised of only Damon and himself. Toward the end of the movie, I didn't care if he lived or died and was actually rooting for the latter - only to put him and myself out of our collective misery.

Ok, I'm not going to rail any further. I just needed to vent a little after wasting 1 1/2 hours of my life watching this glorified nature documentary last night on IFC. For the record, Drugstore Cowboy is one of my favorite movies and Van Sant was on top of his game with that film.

This film is just way too over the top and most viewers won't ""get it"" or even care to. But it does have some delicious work. It explores the bonding of two lost souls in the desert, bound together to die. If ever there was a friendship, this is the very defination of it.

It's intended to be only a character study - nothing more. Not a survial movie. If it was, it would have had them collecting dew in the morning to get water. But none of that is important to this film maker. It's all about character. Given that, it comes off good (but only good) for what it was intended to be.

I'm not sure at all but I bet that this has to be in the record books as one, if not the only, movie to have the least dialoge ever filmed.

If you have the patience (and you'll need a bundle) to suffer thru the long, long periods of inacction, you will see why it was done. Those long, long times represent those long, long moments drawn into days that the two men spent trying to get out. The minutes long silent march of the two together showing only their faces marching on is intended to demonstrate just what any two guys would do - march on trying to survive. It represents, to me, what any two guys would do.

I gave this movie 3 stars because I think it takes the chance to make a movie that only rests on it's characters. It does almost nothing dialoge wise to bring them to life. You simply have to watch them be together and find their love for one-another.

I think this movie, for most, will be a bust. But if ur a HARD CORE movie watcher, this one has it's merrits and if you lean back and watch how it goes, it can be an emotional experience that is interesting.

My complaints:

1) Two much piano when the strongest of the two is sitting in the desert and realizes that they're doomed. The opening theme is good. Especially the doom sounding bass key. The sound of death. Leave it there and finish filming around the guy in silence. Cuz, that's all that there is left. I think that would have been much better and make the hair stand up on ur back.

2) give them at least a little more intelligence. Dont's make them totally stupid even tho this is a character piece. Why don't they know that the valleys may have the best chance for water instead of going to mountain tops?

A lot of times the depth of field is lousy, sometimes the focus is blurry (the lens is trying to focus but can't settle), and the frames don't stay solid or still. As a result, I got motion sickness and had to quit watching for a while.  Then I came back and finished the last half (it was showing on TV).

I generally don't like HOllywood's noisy, fast-paced movies, so, even though this was a bit too slow, I didn't mind the pace and the quietness of this movie.  It was more like a documentary than a movie, and I thought it was more natural and real to life than pretentious.  There's no hero, no carefully planned happy ending, no usual battle between good and evil, etc.

1918141,5,B0000CBY1U,"It is perhaps time to address a few of the criticisms levelled at ""Gerry.""

1.  Nothing Happens.

In fact, there is an incredible richness of action.  No, I'm not kidding.  Every detail, from dialogue, landscape and sound to editing, music and even the opening blue screen is there to help the viewer immerse him/herself in the film.  The first line of the movie is ""Gerry, the path"" which one character says to another, foreshadowing everything that is to follow.  The way the characters are composed in the frame to viscerally demonstrate the futility of their march by having the horizon simply not move at all.  The long tracking shots, much maligned by many critics as being far too long and without meaning are packed with incident if you are engaged.  Which brings me to criticism number 2.

2.  There is no point to the movie.

That all depends on your point of view of course.  But I was utterly sucked in from the beginning.  The metaphor of two men wandering futilely in an indifferent landscape is to a die-hard existentialist what a pint of Guiness is to a parched Irishman.  As I watched the two nameless characters (they're not both called Gerry-more on that later) wander, I yearned to join them, for the wanderings of most mortals is not as beautiful as theirs seemed to be, in spite of its tragic end.  So what is the point?  That we are all wandering around, and all we have to hang on to is each other.  Or maybe it's that we live in an uncaring universe and we must hold fast to the boyscout's motto ""Be Prepared.""  Or maybe it's as another reviewer on IMDb said, sometimes we're rock marooned and need a friend to build us a dirt matress.  I don't know, but I know that every time I watch the film (and I am compelled to keep watching it), I find more to think about.  (I don't wish to preach, but maybe it's simply a matter of rethinking what you expect from a movie.  This movie doesn't spoonfeed, but I'm hardpressed to think of another movie that rewards a vigorously engaged viewer.  Maybe...Vertigo?""

3.  The Acting stinks.

Matt Damon's character wears new khakis because he is a callow young man who thinks it would be cool to go for a hike with his pal.  They talk about Wheel of Fortune and conquering Thebes to stave off the terror of being lost, in the dark with zero prospects of help, and no ability to help themselves.  Ditto the ""mannered"" phrases like ""Mountain-top Scout-about"" and ""rock-marooned"" and ""these animal tracks lead either to water or the mating ground.""  They are either trying to keep up the macho image of a man in touch with his environment, or else they are trying to keep the other from panicking or both.  It is probably also worth noting, that their incompetence is made obvious right from the start.  And Matt Damon's character's description of Wheel of Fortune's rules isn't even right.  In other words, he doesn't even know the rules of the game.  Although the dialogue is said to be improvised, I would argue that it was probably quite well-outlined before production began, because everything that either Matt Damon or Casey Affleck say comments directly on the heart of the matter, even things as mundane as ""I almost succumbed, but I turbanned up and I feel better now.""

4.  Both characters are named Gerry.

A small point, but one that baffles me.  I don't think that either of the characters is named Gerry.  Based on its usage throughout the film, a ""Gerry"" would seem to be a wrong move, a blunder or an idiot.  It's simply a slang term they both use.  They call each other Gerry when the other has done something foolish, like lose his way, or mistaken the rendez-vous point. Otherwise, they call each other ""dude.""

5.  It is impossible to care about the characters.

As you can see, I've given the characters a bit of back-story.  I may be wrong in my assumptions.  I probably don't see them the way the authors (Affleck, Damon and van Sant) did.  However, I believe that the characters are specifically designed to be ""everyboys"" that any young man can identify with.  They are universal archetypes.  I feel for them, because I can easily see myself in the same situation.  Perhaps not literally, but metaphorically in any case.

6.  The characters are stupid.

It is true that it is hard to imagine anyone getting so hopelessly lost in so short a time.  Look at your tracks and follow them back to the car.  It's a sandy trail after all.  However, the whole point is that these characters are out of their element.  The fact that vegetation disappears should clue them in to the possibility that they are going the wrong way, that they ""Gerried.""  That they don't doesn't mean that they're stupid or that the film is stupid or that we should feel stupid if none of this bothers us.  It means that the two protagonists, like us a lot of the time, are in over their heads.

This is a movie that rewards patience, attention and care of viewing.  Repeated viewings are probably a must.  This may be a form of torture to some.  But for those of you who were infuriated, frustrated or bored by the movie while you were watching it, but couldn't get it out of your heads after the fact, give it another chance.",1161302400,54,5181,4.5471289274106175
1918142,2,B0000CBY1U,"I bought this DVD because I thought it would be a survival story, showing the emotional turmoil of being lost in the desert.  I think it really fails on that account; The two men never seemed to get very angry at each other, or even at their situation, nor did the movie show any elation at finally finding civilization.  It was unclear to me if one man died, but if he did the other Gerry sure didn't show much emotion about it.

Another thing I found curious was that their beards didn't seem to grow much for being lost for days in the desert.  They did not seem show any desperation for water, either.

The best I can say about this movie is that it does show spectacular desert scenery.  One other thing I did appreciate about the movie is that I could do other things while the movie was playing and I wasn't afraid of missing anything.  In short, maybe this DVD is best played when one is alone. but doesn't want to feel alone, while they read a magazine or an Amazon.com book.",1157760000,8,984,4.286486486486487

One of the great things about this movie is how Natural it is.  The dialogue is natural in that it doesn't feel unpractical. What I mean by that is that it shows the natural in which we all speak: It doesn't feel like the Actors are reading a speech from a podium.  You really get a sense of how alone the actors are in the wilderness.  This sense of solitude is also created by the magnificent minimalist sountrack along with Beutiful Shots of Wilderness which seem to almost make the scenery the star of the movie instead of  an individual person.

Finaly, One of the reasons you don't get a backround of the characters is that they're not important. The story is important.  This movie explores the way Humans react to being put in this situation, not the way just a certain character might react.

P.S. A word of movie going advice: More Dialogue doesn't mean more meaning, Anyone can talk.  Few have any stories worth telling.

1918144,4,B0000CBY1U,"OK, it's easy to see why a lot of people would not like this film. Long stretches of simple, repetitive movement combined with no dialogue, or dialogue that doesn't mean anything. But I think if you look at this as a kind of update on the existentialist view of life (and stuff like that), it works.

See, I think van Sant is doing something in this film, Last Days, and Elephant that no other American filmmaker is doing, which is to give a down-to-the-bone unsparing view of what we do in our lives--what we actually do, not what filmmakers want us to believe we do. This kind of in-your-face realism doesn't sit too well with a lot of filmgoers and especially when this is combined with a truly bleak perspective on why we're here or what we're here for or how we spend our time while we're here, it could get very discouraging.

The story is simple--two guys with the same name get lost in a desert, but as they continue to wander, we realize the ""desert"" is actually a whole barrage of different landscapes, so symbolism is definitely being used here. And from my point of view, used really well.

In more than one scene, the angle at which we see the two Gerrys walking fused with the lighting used makes the two guys look like walking Giacometti sculptures--long and lean with dangling hands--in a kind of pointless march to oblivion. Beckett is echoed all over the place too in this minimalistic approach, but it's an American take on Beckett with an equally pointless talk on the game show Wheel of Fortune, for example. Is that dialogue inane? Sure. It's meant to be. That's the point--the point of pointlessness.

Is this review itself pretentious? Could be. I just think van Sant is a brave guy who actually does know what he's doing and, from my point of view, does it really well. There's even a trace of horror film here in a scene close to the end when one of the Gerrys talks to the other one then sees someone approaching from a distance....

The ending is tragic, but before that, vistas of passing clouds, vast landscapes shot in the Utah Salt Flats, Death Valley, and Argentina are blended with the music of Finnish composer Arvo Part to emphasize the smallness of man in the vastness of the world. (wow, another pretentious phrase. phew!!)

I like this film a lot. Yes, it's definitely an art film, no question. But an intriguing one that immerses you in existentialism you soak up like a sponge...

Mr. Van Sant, who has shown us brilliance at times in his career (most notably My Own Private Idaho), and at other times major stupidity (his remake of Pyscho), has made probably his worst film. He is paying ""homage"" (or ripping off, which is more appropriate) to the Hungarian filmmaker Bela Tarr.  Tarr's films are quite extraordinary, especially his later ones, like Damnation, Satantango, and Werckmeister Harmonies.  These films are very slow and meditative, with extremely long takes in them.  Werckmeister Harmonies, for example, has only 39 shots in a 145 minute running time.  The trouble is, Van Sant copies the technique of Tarr without the substance and depth. Watching Matt Damon and Casey Affleck wander around the desert improvising lame dialogue (including a sequence where Matt and Casey dissect the ""complexities"" of Wheel of Fortune) is not art, nor is it entertaining.  It's actually quite tortuous.  While Gus is a talented filmmaker, this film is a disaster.  Do yourself a favor...try to see Tarr's later work.

I like Matt Damon. He seems to harbor two polarized views. I'm in the camp that will see a movie because of him, not in spite of him. High marks for Good Will Hunting. Loved the scene on the chalkboard at Havaaaahd. He's the Jason Bourne I thought of when I read Ludlum as a kid, not the other guy.

So, if you have an idea of what Van Sant was trying to do, I need to know. Here's a thought. If he was in a time warp and it was the late 60's, probably there would be a school of thought that would say it touched the face of God or something like that. But it isn't.

I probably wouldn't have bothered if it knew it had ""no story, hardly any dialogue, and even less in the way of ""action"" or ""events."""" as the amazon.com editorial review accurately states. I found myself alternatingly bored, frustrated, and enchanted during the opening 5 minute scene of the car driving along a dirt road through a barren landscape with sparse piano and cello backing, and I continued cycling through those same three emotions for the length of the film, which is essentially an expanded take on the essence of that scene. Oh and it made me thirsty too. Maybe the characters should have had more conversations, about the situation they found themselves in and just life in general, but then that would have detracted from the atmosphere of the mood piece that the film basically was. On the other hand maybe the characters could have just been eliminated entirely, and more emphasis placed on the atmospheric landscape photography slideshow that the film basically was, but the characters journey was important in giving the film a sense of movement and progression. Ultimately I think the director was misguided if this film is supposed to be a refined artistic statement. It comes across more like a half-assed experiment. Maybe that's what it was approached as though. Maybe the director doesn't hold it in as much reverence as some viewers do. The rabid fans mostly come across as self-congratulatory apologists and propagandaists for the film, rarely offering any semblance of an honest explanation of why they enjoyed it.

1918151,5,B0000CBY1U,"I live in the American West.  ""Gerry"" is not set, or shot, in my state--portions of the film were shot as far away as South America--but the scenery is as sandy, as desiccated, as covered in sage brush and scrubby little plants as the view from my window.  Is it premature to say that ""Gerry"" is the great contemporary ""Western"" film?  When we think of the classical Western genre we almost always envision Clint Eastwood and John Wayne interpretating legendary or infamous characters in America's past.  ""Gerry"" does not belong to the classical Western genre; look at its stars.

""Gerry"" is a Western film by virtue of its setting, but it is emphatically in the present tense.  The shots tend to be long--so long that you could easily get up, go to the bathroom, and come back with the camera focused on exactly the same thing.  But if you were misguided enough to take your eyes off the screen for that long, you would miss something:  namely, the sheer duration of the shot, and everything you would notice during it.  The five- or six-minute opening shot of the car on the road is infamous, and it deserves to be.  But a five- or six-SECOND shot of that same car, which would have been the norm, would also have been a different kind of statement.  If you are looking at a shot of a car on the road for five or six minutes, that car becomes ""real"" for you in a way that a five- or six-second car does not.  You notice little things like the variable height of the fender, the uneven paint job, the way the distance between the car and the camera wavers.  (In fact, this film makes a certain kind of viewer frighteningly aware of what the camera is doing.)  I can't say that the film shows the director's technical skill, since it is not difficult, in a technical sense, to film a car for five or six minutes--anyone with a camera can do that.  What the film does show is the director's artistic sense, and it is impeccable.  He juxtaposes long shots intelligently and not gratuitously.

The humor is not subtle, but it works.  My favorite juxtaposition:  Gerry-Affleck suggests that they follow a set of animal tracks in search of water, and Gerry-Damon agrees.  The next shot shows them in a desert--hah!--after who knows how many hours of trudging, and the animal tracks have disappeared.  The irony is wonderful.  The sudden jump in scenery makes the viewer feel as lost as the Gerrys; but the viewer also gets to laugh at the situation in a way that the Gerrys never do.  (So is this a variation on the classical Western genre?  If you wanted to make a movie about people who live in the American West today, what would have to be your point?  Something about the harshness of nature, the aridity of human relations, the failure of humans to harmonize with the environment and the consequences of that failure.  Van Sant, who is not always a sure thing, has nevertheless managed to do this film beautifully.)

I only have two complaints about the film itself:  the ending veers toward a cruel kind of irony (as opposed to the amusing kind of irony I liked so much in the early parts of the film); and the occasional panning shot seems a failure of artistry.  Little quibbles.  The DVD version is superior to the VHS version, because the DVD version is wide-screen (and the real star of the movie is the scenery--the humans never had a chance).  The soundtrack is also superior in the DVD version (Van Sant joins T. Malick and other directors who have used the music of Arvo Part to great effect).

5 - I really liked/loved it
4 - I liked it
3 - Could've been better/worth a look
2 - Just didn't live up to the potential
1 - Simply awful

I Wrote this review years ago. It was among my earliest so I didn't express myself as much as I could have. Now I feel like coming back to it with a wise mindset. I'll show the original review still as well.

Then:
This is the most boring movie in the history of film. There's about five minutes of dialogue (and I'm talking all together) the the main characters are one dimensional. You learn nothing about them so it's impossible to feel sorry for the fact that they got lost in the desert. The cinematography is gorgeous but it's just too slow. Gus Van Sant could've easily made the same film but with more dialogue and a lot more going on.

Now:
I stand by what I said years ago. This is still the most boring film I've ever seen in my entire life. Normally dull films leave little to no impact on me. But this was different. Maybe because I felt like I wasted so much time watching it all. I was wrong about there only being 5 minutes of dialogue; it adds up to give or take half an hour. But the movie itself is over 1 hour and 40 minutes long. So we have extremely long takes of our two Gerrys (Casey Affleck and Matt Damon) just walking through the desert with no talking or music or anything. You could fall asleep for a few minutes, wake up and you'd miss nothing important.

The movie credits Director Gus Van Sant and the two leads as co-writers, but I highly doubt much writing went into this. The dialogue is clearly improvised by the way they both struggle to come up with things to say. While both are good actors, it's clear that improvising is not their strong area. It's also clear that neither the director or stars know how Wheel of Fortune work given the scene where Damon describes an episode he saw. There was one letter left on the puzzle and according to Damon you couldn't spin anymore for a letter. This is false: that only works if there are no vowels left or the vowel is your last letter. But if you still have a consonant left you can keep spinning. That could be considered a nit pick, and I admit it's a little thing, but when there isn't much else to say about the movie I have no real choice.

Again I'll say the cinematography was beautiful, but that's the only positive I can say. Gerry Affleck and Gerry Damon are the most uninteresting characters I can really think of. Besides Wheel of Fortune and some computer game they play, we know nothing about them. People seem to think if you just put characters in a bad situation that it's enough to tug at our heartstrings and feel bad for them. But this is a movie, it's fictional. These are two actors we've seen in many things, we know they're gonna be just fine. A good movie will have you learning about the characters. If a movie is compelling we will care for them. I don't mind slow moving films, but there has to be something there to build up or even some sort of entertainment.

People will talk about the ""symbolism"" of Gerry Affleck being the weak one and Gerry Damon being the strong one him having to take out the other to regain some strength. Neither Gerry comes off as being very smart, and in a way Damon does more damage during the hike. In one scene they come across tracks and Affleck figures it'll lead to water, but Damon is worried about making them self conscious and thus they won't mate. I'm sorry, but that's an idiotic thing to say. Animals don't tend to worry about that sort of thing. Also, if it comes to scaring some animals and making sure you live, I'm gonna choose live.

A commenter on here once told me to ""Stick with Jackie Chan movies. They're more your type."" That's such a jerky thing to say to someone. Yes I like Jackie Chan movies, they're exciting and funny and have great martial arts, but that's not all I like. Take a look at any of my reviews on here and you'll see I have what I think is an eclectic taste. I like most of the films by Jim Jarmusch and they're certainly known for being slow.

So there are my expanded thoughts on Gerry. I wouldn't call them new since I had these same thoughts more or less when I wrote this originally. But I feel I've explained my opinion better.",1120003200,4,4279,4.274074074074074
1918154,3,B0000CBY1U,"""Gerry"" is a film by Gus Van Sant, the director of ""Good Will Hunting"" and ""Elephant."" It stars Matt Damon and Casey Affleck as two friends who get lost in the desert; they spend the ENTIRE film (1 hour and 43 minutes) just walking around the beautiful landscapes trying to find a way out.

Needless to say, as a captivating piece of cinema, ""Gerry"" is a TOTAL failure. I say this without any reservation because my definition of a good film is one that simply maintains your interest. If the film fails to capture your interest, that is, it bores you, causes your thoughts to wander, puts you to sleep, etc. THEN IT'S NOT A GOOD FILM. Yet, even though this is true, I find there are a number of reasons why ""Gerry"" is a worthwhile piece of cinema:

1.) It gives a good laugh. Although it's a serious ""story"" and by no means a comedy, I found myself uproariously laughing on quite a few occasions. Why? I don't know, perhaps because I can't believe someone would actually blow the money on making such a ""film"" and actually think people would like it (well, beyond the art-geek community of Greenwich Village) [I'm kidding!].

2.) It makes the perfect joke movie. What I mean is, you can tell a friend or family member what a great movie you got for them to watch (do a lot of raving) and put ""Gerry"" in; then just kick back and wait for their inevitable negative reaction (e.g. ""This movie's a piece of sh*t"", etc.). In most cases it will only take between 15 and 20 minutes, and certainly no longer than 35 minutes, unless it's someone who has a romantic interest in you and doesn't want to hurt your feelings.

3.) If, like me, you enjoy watching beautiful landscapes, in this case desert landscapes filmed in America and Argentina, then ""Gerry"" is a great flick to kick back to and enjoy. Especially if you just want to relax and not have to THINK. The soothing piano/violin soundtrack nicely enhances the relaxing mood.

4.) It's a great sleep-aid. Seriously, if you're having trouble sleeping, pop in ""Gerry"" and it'll send you straight to la-la land. I'm serious here, the first time I watched ""Gerry"" I was ready to fall asleep after a mere 20 minutes, although I ended up lasting about a half hour. Because of this, it took me FOUR intervals to complete the film (and, yes, it put me to sleep each time).

Just so you know, the movie is titled ""Gerry"" because the two guys constantly refer to eachother as ""Gerry,"" a friendly nickname meaning ""loser"" or ""screw-up.""

Although the film itself is a bore I do enjoy the debates over its probable symbolism, e.g. life itself is a desert and the foolhardy side of your psyche must perish in order for you to survive, etc.

By the way, the Affleck character fits the name ""Gerry"" to a 'T.' You gotta listen REAL close when he speaks because he just sort of mumbles his lines (what few there are).

BOTTOM LINE: Although ""Gerry"" is an utter failure as far as captivating cinema goes, it's definitely worth picking up for the four reasons noted above, hence, my 3-Star rating. I also have to admit respecting ""Gerry"" because it's so unique; it brazenly rejects EVERY cinematic convention, and one can't help but admire such ""boldness."" Which prompts me to wonder: Maybe Gus Van Sant is pulling the ultimate Gerry on us -- and we're all Gerrys because we FELL for it!",1118707200,4,3317,4.542713567839196
1918155,5,B0000CBY1U,"This is a story about two  men ( Matt Damon and Chris Affleck) lost in the desert together.

The key to the movie is it's title ""Gerry"" and a name seemingly affectionately used between the men implying that each is a loser (to put in a nice way).

 They make fun of a woman on a game show who makes a stupid error while they themselves are marching into hell unknowingly. Affleck relates his story about coming up 1 horse short on a computer game and has the wherewithall to climb a huge rock but again does not have the cunning to find his own way down.

What you see is simple: two unnamed guys --  Matt Damon and Casey Affleck -- stray from the marked path somewhere in the wilderness, and wonder the deserted land for three days.  And ... and nothing more.  Surprisingly, according to one interview with Gus Van Sant, this film is loosely based on truth.

'Gerry' refuses the traditional rules of films based on our accepted concepts about characters, stories, etc.  So, you should know that to criticize the film according to these ideas is pointless.  Yes, I know very well.  But....

Can you really sit through this for more than 100 minutes?  Ask yourself.  Be honest.  Please, tell me.  And I watched it in theatre.  Yes, I confess, I slept during these long, continous scenes that show you two guys walking on and on and on ... and is that worth our money?  OK, let's not talk about money.  That's commercialism.

THE problem is, Gus Van Sant denies traditional way of filmmaking -- that's fine in itself -- but  does not show something new, something that can take the place of the good old traditions.  We need something, or anything, in the place of conventional ideas storytelling.  Instead, what we see is, two men wondering on and on, trapped in the land of nowhere.  Existential?  Maybe, but think about that they made (part of) the film on location in Argentina!  Is that worth that trouble?

Using the clout he got with 'Good Will Hunting,' Gus Van Sant made a silly remake (or copy) of 'Psycho.'  And he made this, with Matt Damon (why not use some unknown actors. then?).  With all respect to him, he should have learned that some kind of idea is valid only on paper.",1109030400,2,1878,4.555555555555555

1918161,5,B0000CBY1U,"Gus Van Sant is back, and with some serious style. After taking a long creativity snooze break with such mainstream pleasers as Good Will Hunting and Finding Forrester, and one that nobody seemed to like (Psycho), Sant was ready to return to the role of the risk taking filmmaker we all hoped he really was when he made the amazing My Own Private Idaho. 2003 brought two of the best Van Sant features in his line up, which were subsequently the two best films of the year.

Gerry, Sant's spare experimental film starring Matt Damon and Casey Affleck, divided audiences almost squarely down the center. I fell into the camp that was mesmerized by the film's daring long takes and striking cinematography (the former a homage to such film masters as Andrei Tarkovsky, and the latter a beautiful and original creation of gifted cinematographer Harris Savides). So much was I intrigued by what happens to these two unnamed men (they refer to one another as ""Gerry,"" a made-up and affectionate nickname for a ""royal-f--kup,"" explained Damon), that I find it incredibly hard to understand what so many viewers found so boring about what was happening on-screen. Not only was there plenty of eye candy to get lost in with the otherworldly desert settings (which were shot in three very separate locations to create this atmosphere), but some hilarious improvised dialogue, and a downright intense build to the seemingly inevitable doom of the ""Gerrys."" In addition, these characters were so completely real that I couldn't help but identify with them. They talked, they walked, they fell silent to their own thoughts, they cried. As Ebert pointed out in his review of the film, I can't imagine my getting lost in an expansive desert being much different then this.

Many critics have speculated as to what the purpose of Gerry really was, and there have been many very plausible and intriguing ideas about said purpose (solidifying in my mind the success of this art piece). Some I can see, others I feel are a stretch, but nonetheless the discussion is stimulating. What exactly was the relationship of the two men? Were they friends? Lovers? The exploration of the relationship between the ""Gerrys"" is probably the most intriguing aspect of the film. However, as I watched Gerry, I was increasingly interested by the way the film explored time. There was a hypnotizing long-take in which Afleck and Damon walked in step with one another . Then slowly but steadily, the two men begin separating their walking patterns (this was explored again in Elephant, creating an extremely menacing effect). Other great pieces included the 8 minute descent into night, and two clock-like revolutions around the film's subjects. This one is not to be missed!",1101945600,3,2739,4.952173913043478
1918162,1,B0000CBY1U,"""Gerry"" was made by the great American indie auteur - Gus Van Sant, who directed ""My Own Private Idaho"" and the film that established Matt Damon, ""Good Will Hunting.""  I have enjoyed many of Van Sant's films and generally like and admire indie films.  As for ""Gerry,"" I enjoyed the music and the cinematography is undeniably beautiful; however, the film is terrible.

The movie begins with a shot of an old car driving down a barren highway in the American southwest; for almost 6 minutes the camera fixates on the car.  This scene is the most action-packed of the film, so be prepared for some slow spots!  The car is piloted by Casey Affleck and Matt Damon, and the pair eventually stop for a short hike to see ""the thing.""  They see other tourists heading toward ""the thing"" so they decide to follow a different trail.  Although we find out that the men are friends and both of the men are named Gerry, little else is apparent.  Who they are or what ""the thing"" is are never explained.  The two are clearly slackers though; after about 5 minutes of hiking, they decide to give up searching for ""the thing"" and head back to their car.  Except they can't find the car, and they spend the remainder of the film wandering around.

The movie was shot without a script per se; instead, the dialogue was improvised.  The dialogue is minimal - a story about an episode or ""Wheel of Fortune"" is perhaps the longest section.  Unfortunately, Damon and Affleck are not believable as hikers, and they don't seem to be particularly talented at improvisation.  They try to throw in technical hiking terms, but it's fairly obvious that they never used these terms before, such as ""crow's-nesting,"" ""mountain-top scout about,"" and ""gerried the rendezvous.""  As a result, the dialogue feels more mannered than most formal scripts.  The two characters are also devoid of depth, which leads to a complete lack of emotion concerning their fate.

The movie was filmed in Death Valley area of California as well as Argentina; the leaps in scenery between Death Valley and Argentina are distracting.  The scenic panoramas are beautiful but as enjoyable to watch as slides from your Aunt Hilda's last vacation.  Worst of all, the film is filled with wide-screen shots of the men walking in the distant horizon - seemingly meant to emulate the grandeur of ""Lawrance of Arabia.""  Ultimately, the barren desert landscapes only emphasizes the characters' vapidity.

Your tolerance for ""Gerry"" will depend largely on how much you like the two actors. I dislike Matt Damon, so I found it dreadfully painful at times.  When there's nothing else to focus on in a film other than the actors, every little quirk is magnified, such as Damon's perfect khakis that make him look like a prototypical star who bought new gear to ""rough it.""  About the only satisfaction I received from the film was a certain twisted pleasure watching Damon look like a tool marching around the desert wearing a blue shirt as a turban.  Overall, ""Gerry"" is a self-important mess - a ""My Dinner with Andre"" for slackers.

How can two guys pull off the road with mountains on one side, and not have the sense to use the mountains as a point of reference to get back to the road?

Anyway, the long walking scenes with the crunching of shoes in the sand were great for helping me fall asleep, I almost saved it just for that.  However, the absurdity of it all made me cave in and delete it.

I am fascinated about human nature and how one chooses to survive in desperate times, but I'm sorry, the brilliant team of Van Sant, Damon and Affleck just do not get it.  There wasn't really any intense moments.  It takes you awhile (and the characters) to even realize that they are lost and probably won't find their way back.  And it just seems really bizarre that this has happened to them because they're on flat land.  And when they spot the mountains/hills, they think by climbing up them, they will be able to scout their surroundings.  Seems like a good idea, but why doesn't this work for them?

Okay, okay, admittedly, I've never been lost in the desert and in fact, I've never been to the desert, but I just see the whole thing as really bizarre.  Especially with both characters' determination to find the thing at the end of the trail, whatever that is (pay attention in the beginning).  If they're so determined, then they must at least know what they're doing, right?  Wrong.  It's like taking two guys from New York, plopping them in the desert while in good spirits, and then running off without them and leave them to figure it out for themselves.

There are some pointless but funny moments, like when Casey Affleck's character gets stuck on a high rock platform (for lack of a better word).  Somehow he got himself up there, but the only way down means possible broken bones.  My husband and I kept saying, just dangle yourself down; your feet would be half way to the ground and then drop (emphasis on then).  But instead, Matt Damon's character comes up with some brilliant dirt mattress plan that actually works somehow.

Ah, this could have been great.  There could have been wonderful, thought provoking dialogue, but alas, it was not meant to be.  One good thing I can say about this movie is that you can easily take care of things around the house while watching it.

1918168,3,B0000CBY1U,"As a penance for all the big-studio movies he has done recently, like GOOD WILL HUNTING and the underrated FINDING FORRESTER, Gus Van Sant has so far brought to the cinema two strange experimental films, this one and ELEPHANT. I saw ELEPHANT, admired it a lot, and thus was fairly interested in seeing GERRY.

GERRY is an odd film, to be sure. Starring Casey Affleck and Matt Damon as two characters named Gerry, the film follows these two characters lost in the California desert and try to find their way back. The thing is, not a whole lot happens to them as they are lost. There are no great astonishing dramatic adventures in this desert; the only incident that is really worth mentioning here is one in which one of the Gerrys gets on top of a rock and the film looks on for about ten whole minutes as the other Gerry tries to create a soft patch for the former Gerry to fall and land on. Otherwise, GERRY consists of wide open desert spaces (handsomely photographed by Harris Savides), long wordless stretches, and the hauntingly simple piano music of Arvo Part to fill in the silent gaps.

In the end, I cannot say that I really liked this movie a whole lot. The whole things rather smacks of pretentiousness---a flashy stunt, and not much more than that. And yet, this is hardly the terrible movie some people say it is. It might not be totally successful, but it does create a palpable sense of desolate atmosphere and doom that is quite appropriate to this ""plot,"" and there is actually a bit of poignancy, especially towards the end of the film, that cuts through the narrative aridity. The evocatively lonely mood of one particular shot---an extremely deliberate 360-degree tracking shot circling about the Casey Affleck Gerry as he desperately looks at the vast expanse of empty desert space in front of him and Arvo Part's softly haunting piano music playing in the background---still sticks with me now.

Still, all in all, I would not recommend seeing this movie over Van Sant's more effective ELEPHANT, an equally adventurous filmmaking venture that is perhaps the definitive cinematic treatment of the disturbing Columbine incident. GERRY deserves points for its bravery and isolated haunting moments, but otherwise the whole thing seems more like a pointless exercise rather than the radically effective minimalist film that Van Sant was hoping for.",1094256000,2,2369,4.844444444444444

1918173,3,B0000CBY1U,"Frustration.  To me the goal of art is to delve into a human emotion or feeling, to make the viewer of the art feel what the creator of the art is trying to visualize.  Unfortunately for this film, frustration is the emotion and feeling that is being portrayed.  The frustration of being lost in the desert, the frustration of being a run-of-the-mill person.  The two Gerrys know each other so well, you can't really tell what their relationship is, which adds to your confusion, but ah.... is this intended as well?  Two sides of the same psyche?  They barely even have to talk to each other.  But the one scene where one Gerry is stuck on a rock, and they try to figure out how he's going to get down is the whole point of the film.  Very memorable.
Through watching it, I found myself fidgeting, fastforwarding, losing interest, pausing... I felt like I was lost in the desert... oh!

1918174,5,B0000CBY1U,"I rented ""Elephant"" and ""Gerry"" in the same night.  ""Elephant"" was a let-down, great concept and experiment, but all in all a failure as far as I was concerned.  The first half of the film was brilliant, and probably the most authentic cinematic view of high school life since, well, Wiseman's ""High School"".  But the second half turned into what I can only describe as a school shooting on demerol--the actors portraying the shooters did not have the capabilities to pull off the dimensionality of character Van Sant was going for, and the ending flopped as a result.
So next, I popped in ""Gerry"".  Considering the reviews and media attention had been favoring ""Elephant"", I figured I wasn't in for much.  Instead, I was treated to one of the most daring and original films I've ever watched.
The film is slow, but intentionally so.  It portrays to the psyche of the viewer what a film like ""Cast-Away"" never could--the sheer monotony, hopelessness, solitude and fear of being lost or stranded.  The vistas are beautiful in widescreen and become a character themselves, playing the antagonist off of the two protagonists, Affleck & Damon.
I won't go into the big question in this film, because it's a spoiler.  But just keep in mind that certain characters in this film may not be characters at all, at least in the physical sense.  It's this metaphysical and existential play that makes this film so interesting; the only work in cinema I can think to compare it to is Antonioni's ""L'Avventura"", which it pays homage to, but actually exceeds in its purpose, in my opinion.

With that said, one knows some people will love it and some hate it, whether it be for their hipster pretentious flair or lack of attention span, either is debatable, which i shall not waste my time doing.
Listen-- if you want Gus Van Sant to get you into the mindset of a person who beleives they will die in the desert, this film accomplishes that with its sheer monotony and relentlessly slow pace.  The long shots, in my opinion, serve this effect, and this definatly isn't for one who enjoys and defends conventional film making.
This also isn't a revolutionary idea, as I've seen student films go something like this (of course, at a lower quality, since they don't have the funds of Gus Van Sant), and it is rather pretentious to hail this as revolutionary or profound, since it has been explored in other films as well as other forms of media.

1918180,4,B0000CBY1U,"Gus Van Sant's ""Gerry"" is a bit like ""The Blair Witch Project"" minus the sensationalistic, supernatural elements.  In this two-character film, Matt Damon and Casey Affleck (both of whom co-wrote the film with Van Sant) are buddies who decide to go hiking in the desert.  When Damon offhandedly suggests leaving the trail, the decision turns out to be a fateful one for the both of them.  The young men are both named Gerry, an appellation which turns out to have allegorical significance, since ""gerry,"" we are informed, is slang for ""mistake.""  And these guys sure come up with a beaut.
Like ""Blair Witch,"" ""Gerry"" taps into the almost primordial fear humans have of being lost in unfamiliar, hostile territory bereft of even the most rudimentary supplies necessary for survival.  It also shows how even the most seemingly insignificant decision a person makes can wind up having fatal ramifications in the end.  Despite the fact that the film runs a little over 100 minutes, the three screenwriters have opted to have the characters speak as little as possible, both before and after the fateful decision.  Although this does prevent us from really getting to know the men in any great depth, the purpose of the filmmakers seems to be not so much to craft a narrative-driven drama but to create a kind of lyrical tone-poem about fate and the ways in which people face the inevitability of impending death.  As director, Van Sant lingers long on both his images and his scenes, probably too long for many in the audience, who may well become restless and impatient long before the closing shot has faded from the screen.  Personally, I found the rhythm and the pacing of the film to be both hypnotic and entrancing.  There's an immense sadness that hangs over the film, enhanced by the starkness and bleakness of the setting and the grimness of the subject matter.  Damon and Affleck turn in subtle, taciturn performances, relying on body language and facial expressions rather than words to convey their thoughts and fears.  Arvo Parte has also provided a brooding, melancholic score that enhances the atmosphere of the film.

After the first 15 minutes, I started watching this DVD in 1.5x speed, in an attempt to stop the bleeding of my lost time. The ending was the most drawn out, unsatisfying piece of garbage I've ever seen. When I read that 3 people wrote this film, I figured it was when they were out in the desert spewing dialogue - 2 actors walking, the director holding the camera and the guy writing down what everone said while they were walking around. I truly cannot believe they convinced anyone to front the money for this film based on the script! Even the credits at the end were annoying - silent displays of blue screen white text - just being consistent with the boring theme of the film - probably the only thought that went into it.",1078531200,2,877,4.386503067484663

I could watch the tiny things that happened... pets coming in and jumping on the bed, endless changes of position, cadences of breathing, lighting changes outside my windows.
Gus Van Sant has really found a way to capture this sort of living, thinking, and being on film. I love him.
Tarkovsky did it well with Andrei Rublev and Nostalghia.
Bergman did it well with Wild Strawberries.
Documentaries do it well with nature as subjects.
The act of experience is a treasure to find on film. So many(in fact, most) films force feed their 7 courses of high fat fodder so rapidly down your soul that it's hard to exist along with them.
These kinds of films are rare.
They give you ample time to think about what's happening to you and the characters. It's a much richer, more haunting, and lasting excursion.
I actually think Gerry is better than Elephant. Mostly, this is because of the magnificent frames.
9.5/10*, and I have a new top 10 film.
Oh, how I wish Van Sant would attempt a Donner Party film. I'll take Gerry if he does not.
DVD notes: oh how a commentary would be appreciated, especially for this near-masterwork.  There is a rather interesting documentary, filmed in much the same style as the piece itself.
Of note is the actual true story of Raffi Kodikian that this is based loosely upon.  Avid fans of Gerry should pick up a copy of Journal of the Dead, the book of the two friends who ventured out into the desert, and were lost almost inexplicably.",1077840000,4,1525,4.541818181818182

It is filled with long and boring scenes of personal introspection as the lead characters, one of whom is Matt Damon, stare endlessly into the desert wherein which they find themselves hopelessly lost. The dialogue, when there is any, is stilted and chopped.  It is, or so the producers would have you believe, filled with alleged wisdom and insight, as only those who are hopelessly lost in the desert can enjoy.  The opening scene, a long and tedious view of the desert expanse as seen through the windshield of a car, should have been a significant hint to the unwary viewer.

What is even more tedious is the dialogue is probably the most insipid I have ever heard -- Wheel of Fortune? A mumbled rant about 'Conquering Thebes'?  Please.  Trying to make an artistic, intellectual film with absolutely nothing to stir up thought is a completely futile effort.  Rather than inspiring questions about the duo and their relationship under such strain the film makes you question why this film was ever made in the first place. It's as if the writers all read Waiting for Godot and got inspired to do an updated version (with meaningless dialogue). The main difference, however, is that this work has absolutely no social or political relevance whatsoever. What makes us care?  Why should we watch this?  Don't.  Fast forward and admire the beautiful cinematography that is this film's only saving grace; honestly, this film would have been good had there been no characters at all!",1075766400,8,1259,4.850467289719626

I showed it, lent it, & foist it upon, some of the brightest folks I know. Over and over, the opinions reflected mine. In short...
This film is as pointless as a mint suppository!
Two chaps who, if brains were nitroglycerine, wouldn't have enough to blow their noses; set off on a day hike into a desert wilderness (I said DESERT) armed with plenty of cigarettes but not a drop of water between them. They promptly get lost and haven't the wits to follow their own tracks back out or recognize the abundance of edible plants all around them. You see, along with not bringing water, or a compass, or a map, they also neglected to pack a brain!
The movie is boring. I don't mean your typical, ordinary boring, but profoundly and astonishingly boring. The premise is stupid, the characters idiotic and the dialog about as scintilating as you'd expect from patients at a coma clinic.
However, the scenery is nice.
Really, if you simply want to sqander 20 bucks, I'll give you my address. It will be better spent than purchasing this video goiter.
Key points: This movie is far less interesting than a flood at the Alka Seltzer factory, featuring two simps more banal than pay-toilets in a diahrrea ward, and as odious as flatulence in a space suit.

1918194,1,B0000CBY1U,"A few years ago there was a short news article in the ""Los Angeles Times"" about two guys who went hiking and then got lost and dehydrated and one of them apparently killed the other -- apparently to put him out of his misery.

Gus Van Sant was so inspired by that little news clip he made an entire feature film about the incident.  Casey Affleck and Matt Damon were unfortunately talked into this dreary, laughably inept, boring waste of perfectly good celluloid.

Here's the plot: two guys, both inexplicably named Gerry, decide to take a hike, they wander around and talk about nothing and then one of them collapses and the other guy strangles him.  The end.

In spite of Van Sant's outrageous pretentiousness, this is not an homage to Beckett's ""Waiting for Godot.""  No Godot here, just Godawful.

But it is a cautionary tale about what can happen when one wanders on a whim too far off the beaten path with a person who shares your name.

Two boring guys named GERRY get lost. One Gerry dies -- much like this empty film.

This very odd story raises numerous questions.  None are answered in this unimaginative film that literally goes nowhere and does it at a snail's pace.  No.  Slower than a snail.

This movie is so bad that the I heard the Geneva Convention actually outlawed its use in getting captured terrorists to talk.  Which gives me an idea:

Someone should make GERRY 2.  Here's the plot:  The perpetrators of this film scam (Gus, Matt and Casey) are kidnapped and tortured on camera (by being forced to watch ""Gerry"" until they explain why this alleged film was made, apologize and make a lifetime of payments for the emotional duress of everyone tricked into seeing this blackhole of existential, nihilistic miasma.

You feel as if you have hiked with these boys, and then when the powerful climax finally approaches, it hits you like a brick. There is hardly any dialogue in this film. It doesn't need it.

1918198,1,B0000CBY1U,"First of all, I can only say that the Cinematography was about the only part of this film that can even get the 1 star that I gave it.
You sit and search for a reason why you spent an hour and 40 some odd minutes watching a movie that has no plot, no real theme, and a poor ending.  Never thought I would see a movie with Matt Damon that was written and filmed so low budget in all aspects of what a motion picture should be.
Not that I don't think there was a twist of the usual motion pictures put out today on this film by the director and Damon, but there sure was hardly any real content.  I just didn't catch anything that made me want to go OOH or AHH.  Sitting for almost 2 hours watching 2 men walk through the desert, rarely talking, it was hard to see even character relationships evolve, or anything to that extent.  I never did figure out why the heck they went out walking in the desert anyways.  They were heading to ""the spot, the place"" where ever?  Didn't make much sense, since that was mentioned for a whole 2 seconds of the movie.
Putting the names Damon and Affleck doesn't justify forking out over $20.00 some odd dollars for a dvd that isn't worth .20 cents.
I'm a huge Damon fan, and I think he should come out with a public apology, or, have Affleck put this film along with his brothers loser with JLo of 2003 into the ""don't watch vault""
If you must watch just for the shear curiosity, be sure to watch it early in the day, and have a real film on cue to watch to make up for the dissapointment in this one.
Putting the directors credits of Goodwill Hunting, and other films that have merit, is a sucker draw in this critic's opinion.  They must have spent a whole $500.00 creating this film, and it's worth about that.  Even if I was given a free dvd of this movie, I'd remove the jacket, and replace it with a real movie.

But most importantly I agree 110% that this film and it's visuals will stick in your mind possibly forever. I watched it two days ago and can not stop thinking about it. The enchanting opening scene of Damon and Affleck driving down an empty road as the gentle and bittersweet piano plays on the soundtrack is astonishing. And the part that has stayed with me and taken over my thoughts is the haunting scene at the end when the characters are dragging their feet across the endless sand landscape as the eerie sound on the soundtrack predict certain doom.

The Beckett-ish lack of narrative and dialogue is... a little hard to take. I found myself wanting just a little more, if only to feel more about these people when I found out how it ended.

This film portrays God and Devil before the advent of mankind trudging through their divine live's and finally deciding to go different ways.  This can be seen (heard) in Affleck's fireside dialouge, and the long walk together where the devil ""falls out of step"" with god.  Also, presumed but never said, is all of the emotions one would associate with ""evil"" portrayed in Casey Affleck's mannerisms.

Runners-up were ""Dude, Where's My Plot,"" ""Pretentious Beyond Belief,"" and ""Waiting For Godot...Without the Nail-Biting Tension"". To say that this film is boring, plotless, a waste of time, but visually stunning would be simply parroting previous reviewers. So, I'll just say why I personally find this film so intolerable/insulting/unbearable. This so-called movie is the cinematic equivalent of those ""artworks"" in museums that are supposed to be acid tests for whether you have artistic sensitivity, taste and intellectual superiority. We've all seen them: the perfectly blank canvas that has snobs and pseudo-intellectuals oo-ing and ah-ing about it's stark minimalism and how it reflects the zeitgeist of our sterile society yadda yadda yadda.....If you disagree and say, ""It's not art, it's just a blank sheet of canvas!"", you will supposedly expose yourself as a low-brow Philistine from the shallow end of the gene pool. Have we forgot the story of the Emperor's New Clothes? Now, I am renowned among my friends for having the patience of a saint; I will stick with a long novel or movie long after everyone has given up on it. And I think I am no intellectual slouch; I do have a graduate degree and my IQ tests in the Superior range. So I think it is saying something when I say that this is the worst movie that I have seen all year. What makes it worse is that it isn't by some art school dropout; it's by Gus Van Sant. We all know he can do better.
