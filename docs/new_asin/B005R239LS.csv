8484006,5,B005R239LS,"This has been called the only Film Noir Western. This film has many levels and sub levels all of which blend into an neat little westerama. The camera work is exceptional and so well thought out. Every shot is set up like a painting. The plot saddles you up and sweeps you along with the rest of the odd balls hiding out in Mexico. The lure of lost gold, missing for a hundred years in the dunes, is a fascinating draw. I relate to this film
because my Dad loved the desert and we
would drive out by Yuma and explore the
sand dunes when I was a kid. The Mexico of this film is also just what I remember when I was little. Randolf Scott and a winning cast make this one of my favorite adventure stories. I guess you can tell I may be a little biased in favor of this sleeper from the late 40s. I recommend this one and if you enjoy it as much as I have, let me know.",1407369600,,865,3.9485714285714284
8484007,4,B005R239LS,"One of a number of sort-of-westerns that take place in contemporary times, this black and white (1949) piece was apparently made to capitalize on the success of ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" the previous year; like that film it's about a group of greedy prospectors, but that's where the main similarities end.  In ""The Walking Hills"" we have a much larger group (nine I think) and the ""prospecting"" is for a wagon train that was supposedly carrying millions of dollars worth of gold, lost and buried in some high dunes near the Mexican border a hundred years previously. De facto leader of the expedition is Jim Carey (Randolph Scott), whose background is unknown and mysterious, and among the diverse crew with him are the old prospector who has believed the legend all along (Edgar Buchanan), a woman he once loved (Ella Raines) who also has connections with other members of the group, a couple of bad-tempered sorts who might be convicts or cops (Arthur Kennedy and John Ireland), and a black singer (Josh White). All of the characters seem to have secret pasts; and one or more of them have secrets that will endanger all of their lives, as we soon start to find bodies....

""The Walking Hills"" is a pretty solid little thriller, a race against time, the elements, and the less savory elements in the little party, with Scott's grim Carey trying to hold it all together and not get too involved in the various internicine squabbles. It's refreshingly free of racism - there's also an Indian character, and neither his race nor the black man's is ever an issue at all - and the wonderful cast and Sturges' sure and quick way with keeping the narrative moving, and a couple of good action sequences, make this a memorable little piece of work, even if at the end it doesn't really add up to anything much and not all the characters or backgrounds are that well developed.  The location work I should point out is pretty terrific - the sandstorm at a climax in particular is quite powerful and clearly not done with effects; if you're a Scott fan you owe it to yourself to seek this out as it's rather different from his other post-war work which is otherwise exclusively period western-oriented.",1381795200,2,2204,4.704663212435233
