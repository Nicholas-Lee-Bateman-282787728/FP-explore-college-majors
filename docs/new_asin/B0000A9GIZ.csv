1903956,5,B0000A9GIZ,We stumbled across this movie on PBS first.  We enjoyed watching it so much it surprised me and I knew I had to find it!  It's very entertaining to see all the different sandwiches across the country and how loyal the locals are to certain restaurants and some sandwiches that have been a tradition at some places for a very long time.,1330041600,,335,4.387096774193548
1903957,5,B0000A9GIZ,"I got the hot dog program first.  Then I had to get this!  Dare I say this is even better!  I echo someone else's comment that this is great to play when you have dinner guests or parties.  Good ice breakers!  If this was played at doctor/dentist offices, elevators, hair dressers, bank lines, etc, it would make time go by much more pleasantly!  All my family loved this show.  If I am visiting a city, I check to see if a sandwich place is on it and make time to visit it.  (Which I have!)  I visited a place in Buffalo and the owners were delighted that I was from the west coast and made time to try their  ""beef on weck"".

The program is sorta of a fun documentary (its done with some humour).  I think kids will like it too!  They could easily make a part 2.  I wished they would!  It's definitely re-watchable.

As for filling or bun?  Dare I say bun!",1287014400,,858,4.1030303030303035
1903958,5,B0000A9GIZ,You should have by now read my review of 'A Hotdog Program'. This is the follow up to that documentary. Or maybe it came before? Again it makes me hungry just typing about. GET IT!,1280880000,,180,4.171428571428572
1903959,5,B0000A9GIZ,I love this documentary.  It makes you want to take a road trip around the United States and try every regional sandwich shown.  The interviews with the sandwich eating public definitely make the video what it is.,1209513600,,213,4.72972972972973
1903960,5,B0000A9GIZ,"I am NOT one to sit down and watch a movie, but while I was flipping through the television one day a long time ago this show was playing on PBS.  Not only was I enthralled enough to sit and watch it then, but several times over the next few weeks while it aired. Recently I just put it on my Netflix listing, watched it repeatedly until my husband made me mail it back so I had to breakdown and buy it.  You can eat a full four course meal, watch this DVD and find yourself craving one of the sandwiches.  My husband, the chef in the family, is constantly trying to recreate some of my favorites.  This DVD is absolutely wonderful!! Try ""A Hot Dog Program"" too!",1166486400,9,662,4.1484375
1903961,5,B0000A9GIZ,"Oh my gosh, the sandwiches are so scrumptuous and outrageous in this

DVD, it is a freaking gem!  Brilliant idea and well done in a fun way.

You betcha!",1163462400,2,153,4.206896551724138
1903962,5,B0000A9GIZ,"I've enjoyed all of Rick Sebak's documentaries, but this is one of his best.  I still think the hot dog one is the most interesting, and thematically coherent, but this one contains some nice discussion of the way that great sandwiches are true uniters.",1156118400,3,253,4.75
1903963,4,B0000A9GIZ,This is a great show if you like finding the hidden and unpretentious places real people go.  I should be accompanied with a recipe book.,1102032000,4,137,4.48
1903964,5,B0000A9GIZ,"Rick Sebak and crew have done it again. Its interesting,its Americana, it provides cultural and historical lessons and boy those sandwiches look great! From the Buffalo beef on week to the po boys in Norleans, they are snadwiches fir for a king (or queen). I intend to go to these places if I'm near them in my travels. Yum!",1090281600,4,324,4.508474576271187
1903965,5,B0000A9GIZ,"I've just finished watching this video and I am now far too hungry to write a long review.  Suffice it to say that after watching this piece of screaming genius you will be mapping out a route from sandwich to sandwich all across this vast nation.  These sandwich makers are the philosophers of our time.  Listen, learn and digest.",1089763200,12,331,4.576271186440678

7996223,5,B0000A9GIZ,"Unfortunately when I saw the show, I was in the hospital and after surgery you don't get to eat.  I am now making up for the loss by making some of these sandwiches or looking for them when I travel.",1464652800,,199,3.975
7996224,5,B0000A9GIZ,"OH MY GOD! This show makes me so hungry! Actually, all of Rick Sebak's food shows make me hungry... and they make me want to go on a road trip, which is quite a trick because I hate driving and/or travelling.",1433203200,,208,4.097560975609756
7996225,5,B0000A9GIZ,This might be one of the best DVDs I have ever seen.  I saw this late one night in Vegas on TV and caught the last 30 minutes.
