2200636,2,B000766XNK,"The barely-even-released George and the Dragon is better than its troubled post-production history implies, but despite being considerably more competent the best that can really be said of it is that it's harmless. Aside from some miscasting and weak performances - take a bow Michael Clarke Duncan, Joan `Pantomime Dame' Plowright and a WTF-are-you-doing-here Patrick Swayze looking like Medieval Texas trailer trash - the biggest problem is that there's too much George, too little dragon. James Purefoy's pleasant enough in a Pierce Brosnan TV-movie sort of way, but there's a notable lack of dragon slaying (he spends most of the time protecting an unhatched dragon's egg) and far too many ideas borrowed from other films, not least Val Kilmer's unbilled cameo as the Dread Pirate Roberts - sorry, El Cabillo - sporting another of his collection of bad Irish accents. The highlight is a horse defecating continually through a love scene in the end credits out-takes.

Unlike the fullframe US DVD, the German PAL DVD offers a good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer with optional English soundtrack, trailer, brief interview with director Tom Reeve and behind the scenes footage.",1178496000,,1175,5.283422459893048
2200637,3,B000766XNK,"OK, this is not what you'd call highbrow, or realistic, or historically factual or anything, but if you are in the mood for some light entertainment grab some popcorn, kick back and enjoy a few laughs while you watch this movie that kind of turns the St. George and the Dragon legend on its ear. Never liked the legend anyway since I've always rooted for the dragon so maybe that's why I kind of liked this movie. I gave it 3 stars which is how I rate a movie that entertained me but that I'll probably never watch again. Good to put in your ""queue"" for a lazy day.",1178409600,20,565,4.192660550458716
2200638,1,B000766XNK,"George and the Dragon was quite a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Patrick Swayze, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Val Kilmer among others.

There are no words to describe how AWFUL (!!!) this ""movie"" was from beginning to end, but let me try anyway so as to give people a fair chance to avoid it and thus try and prevent their day/evening from being ruined: the film deals with the return of an English Crusader, who decides to visit the king and ask him for an acre of land to live off. During their meeting, the king informs him of his missing daughter and the former crusader takes it upon himself to find her. Little does anyone know that the princess does not really wish to be found and that she is guarding something rather unusual...

It seems as though the actors/directors/producers went to the countryside on vacation separately, while there they met up with each other at the hotel lounge over hot chocolate, and then decided, on the spot, to make the best of their stay by doing a quick, impromptu, and easy film on the side for some extra cash/spending money. The word ""amateur"" in describing their work has to be the understatement of the year!

The major setback is in relation to the acting (or lack of it). The acting-oh my- the acting is beyond words... School plays (and pre-school for that matter) have better acting! It is truly sad... The big names are unrecognizable! It's as if they're just fooling around or are under the influence of illegal substances.

Another weakness is in relation to the very poor dialogues and the weak plot/storyline for which the writers and director are to blame.

To mention just a few of these ""beauties"":

1) A medieval priest making his escape from the gallows on a skateboard...

2) George the Crusader, relieving himself on the beach and then pulling up his zipper, which includes the sound of an actual zipper... I did not know how advanced people were in the Middle Ages...

3) George's elderly father (who by the way does not have legs) riding a straw horse into battle!

4) Tarik, the Moor, repeatedly snapping his fingers on people's foreheads as a joke...

5) Patrick Swayze's and Michael Clarke Duncan's heavy American accents in the midst of Medieval England...

6) PATHETIC special effects AND battle sequences! (One has to see it to believe it)

7) S L O W moving plot, characterized by unabated B O R E D O M...

The only positive aspects of the ""movie"" are the setting/location (with the scenery being beautiful!), and the costumes, which are pretty good (though nothing great).

So it's a weak plot, a great setting and a wonderful cast, which when put together fail miserably.

The potential for a great movie was definitely there.

In short, it could have been so much better if the actors had actually acted, and the writers/director had the ability to... write and direct! A shame really...

Rent or buy at your own risk. You have been warned!",1169942400,4,2935,4.678988326848249
2200639,5,B000766XNK,"I will admit, this movie has a few weaknesses, but those should not stand in the way of the strengths.

""George and the Dragon,"" which also appeared on the Sci-Fi channel under the title ""Dragon Sword,"" REALLY reminded me of the dragon stories I used to read and watch when I was a kid and young adult.  However, it's told in a way that appeals to adults as well.  It follows the quest of George (James Purefoy), a knight who just returned from the Crusades. George is the ideal crusade knight: battle savvy, honorable, and loyal.  After visiting his family, George's father sends him on a quest to find the dragon that George's father tangled with years before.  George, who believes dragons are extinct and his father was just telling a fairy tale, finds his own quest.  The king's daughter, Princess Lunna (Piper Parabo), has gone missing, and her father offers George a fortune to help find her. Despite the opportunity for wealth and fortune, George only wants an acre of land, two cows, and rest from over fifteen years spent fighting overseas. Meanwhile, the princess finds a quest of her own - to protect a dragon's egg.

The most important thing to realize is that this is very much about the characters instead of the dragons.  It's about the struggles of the characters and the way they handle those struggles.  It's also about honor and friendship.  The movie does have an amazing cast, and I'm not talking about the ""big names"" here like Val Kilmer and Patrick Swayze.  I'll admit, this definitely did not represent their best acting - at all.  I'm talking about an amazing cast, like James Purefoy and Piper Parabo, who are able to pull off their roles despite the weaknesses of the movie.  These characters have a wonderful on-screen relationship as they banter back and forth, and James Purefoy excels in this role.  It's not hard to see why he got the part as the Black Prince of Wales in ""A Knight's Tale.""  In fact, if you liked him in that role, definitely catch him in this movie (which was released three years after ""A Knight's Tale"").

Be warned, however: the beginning of this movie gets off to a bit of a slow start.  In fact, the beginning almost seems like a cross between ""Dragonheart"" and ""Monty Python"" thanks to the skateboarding monk and a few other . . . moments.  Some of the fight scenes were lacking, but others were actually impressive.  Despite the slow start and some of the low-budget fighting sequences, the film is completely worth it.  It takes off and manages to stand out as an awesome fantasy movie that comes from a genre notorious for ridiculous content.

This was a great popcorn movie.  It told an entertaining and touching tale of courage, friendship, and honor (despite some of the occasional . . . goofy moments).  Overlook those and the rest of the movie has a lot to offer!  It is a great movie that the entire family can enjoy.",1156636800,26,2884,4.620825147347741

I thought this would be like a Disney movie where it's aimed at kids but there are plenty of things thrown in for adults, but it's not.

2200708,2,B000766XNK,"George and the Dragon has an amazing cast of characters. James Purefoy. Piper Perabo. Patrick Swayze. Val Kilmer. You'd think, with this cast, and with a cool, medieval atmosphere, that it'd be a sure winner.

It is amazing to me that, with these amazing characters, and with a rich storyline to portray, that the movie falls flat. You could say this would be a great movie for kids - but even there I find it highly questionable. Here's why.

First, the movie has awful writing and acting. I know these actors can do far better. I've seen them in other movies where their scenes make your heart swell with emotion. Here it's as if they're getting through their lines as quickly as possible to get them over with. Sure, you can point to the dialogue which is about as awful as it come. The lines are about as cliche and cheezy as has been seen on screen. I imagine that can drag an actor down. But, that being said, I've seen movies like Disney's The Three Musketeers where the writing was atrocious and even so the stellar actors make it work. That's the job of a talented actor - to bring life into even the most inane sludge. These actors SHOULD have been able to pull it off. Why do they sound so bored? They talk over each other. They barely respond to each other. Swayze is supposed to be the ""bad guy"" but you barely feel like he cares at all about what he's doing. James is supposed to be an experienced knight back from the Crusades but he seems more a bored writer who has only written about these things - not experienced them. Look at James's acting in Ironclad - which is also about a crusader - to see the difference. James is STUNNING in Ironclad. Here he is barely present.

OK, but it's for kids. Maybe you say kids don't care about acting and dialogue. What?? Have you seen the amazing movies out for kids these days? Kids are treated to stunning, powerful action and dialogue. That's what we want to raise them on. Why would we have them expect that this drek is normal and worth watching?

And, furthermore, let's see what lesson we're teaching to kids here. This cast is 99% male. It's all about males out doing things and controlling things. They run into a princess who is treated like an inane, spoiled brat. Her sole interest is in protecting a dragon egg - ""because it's the last one."" That's it, period. When asked, well how about all the villages it will destroy and lives it will slay when it hatches, she doesn't know or care. She has no thoughts. She's obsessive to the point of inanity. The above image shows her wearing a sword which is what all the promo images show as well - as if she can take care of herself. Nope - she simply whines and complains and when she finally gets into combat it's a **ten year old boy** who has to go save her. What?? Is this the message we want to send to young girls? Or to young boys about how women behave? This is the exact OPPOSITE of what I would want children to be molded by.

Sure, it's fantasy. And fantasy teaches us what to aspire to. The fantasy male here is strong, brave, heroic, and does the right thing. Boys watching this want to be George. The fantasy female here is idiotic, self-centered, and obsessed. I would hope few girls would want to be like her and few boys would think this is how women act!

Also, many children are quite interested in medieval culture and know a lot about it. This would be a perfect vehicle for them to learn about the culture and expand their knowledge base, if done right. There are plenty of other movies which take this aspect of their layout seriously. They know that what they portray will impact a child's impression of the era they are portraying. But George and the Dragon is ATROCIOUS at the way it portrays medieval life, in just so many ways. A kid who watches and rewatches this will end up with a slew of incorrect impressions of medieval times that they might never realize are wrong. It's not even that this movie does a disservice - it's actively damaging kids' knowledge of a real period in our history. It would be like a movie about the civil rights getting everything wrong and kids watching it thinking they now understand what went on then. Why would a director even do that?? Why not do it correctly?

To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. Yes, we absolutely need kid-friendly movies which portray positive role models for boys AND girls in a healthy, interesting manner. This movie is absolutely not one of those movies. To waste a child's time watching this when they could be watching so many other movies that provide better messages with better acting and better environments makes no sense at all to me. If the parents don't bother to take the time to find those other movies, and give this movie to the child as an ""easy way out"" then I suppose I have to blame the parents. After all, the kids aren't the ones making the purchase or renting the video.

2200710,3,B000766XNK,"I enjoyed it. Not great. Good for all ages. Bought it because actor James Purfoy is very good looking.

James Purefoy plays a knight back from the crusades with a Moor he made friends with there. (Moors were neither black nor likely to make friends with any Christian for any reason. Hollywood gets ridiculous.)

Val Kilmer plays a small, uncredited role.

Perabo plays the king's daughter who is determined to save the last dragon egg to keep the species from becoming extinct after discovering the egg and disappearing. James must find her, then get her back to her father's castle without Patrick Swayze's character kidnapping her to force her to marry him.",1400803200,,660,4.875

What caught my attention (in addition to Patrick Swayze), was the first fight scene. Swords and axes everywhere, but not one bad guy felled by being stabbed. Very entertaining choreography.

I would definitely recommend this film to families who need a break from superheroes and princesses. Further, the moral lessons are not drilled then hammered, and the puns, one-liners, and fart jokes are scarce. It's a good break from some of the common movie formulas.

Still, I wouldn't categorize it as solely a ""family film""; you shouldn't feel ashamed to watch it without kids. It's a clever take on a familiar tale, a fun mixture of adventure, comedy, romanceand dragons.",1377734400,,787,4.946969696969697

If you are buying it to watch Swayze, you may be a bit disappointed, but his interview about his part is very nice and it's easy to see he enjoyed doing this movie. It is one that I would recommend for children (I am buying it to share with my grandkids) and, though it does have some violence of the time period, it is mild compared to most anything approved of for kids today. There is some death, one main good guy does die, but its not bloody and plays an importatnt part in the story. The ending it quite delightful.",1345593600,,586,4.1946902654867255

The language is clean, there is no sex and the violence is kept to a minimum. No blood and gore so your kids can still watch it. Yet, the scripting and acting are good enough to keep the adults entertained, too. It gives good life lessons about not letting fear cloud your judgement, working together for a common goal, and protecting threatened species (even the ones that aren't cute and cuddly!)",1328140800,,553,4.595959595959596
2200747,2,B000766XNK,The movie is so dedicated to not being stereotypical that has become stereotypical. The cg is horrible and the acting is meh. If you want a movie to watch on the couch with some popcorn perhaps it's worth the $1 rental fee at redbox.,1326326400,,233,4.318181818181818
2200748,5,B000766XNK,This movie is just a wonderful interpretation of the man who became St. George the dragon slayer. It is a good adventure and comedy mixture that is great.

2200749,4,B000766XNK,"I really liked this. It started out pretty cheesy, but here's the low down.

CONS: Patrick Swayze looked bloated. Not his best look. The Americans were using their American accent while the Brits were speaking British English. The effect was jarring and incongruent, but not enough to ruin things.

PROS: There is no sex, nudity, cursing or violence! There are funny little things interspersed throughout the movie that give it a Princess bride quality. The characters are likable- there is even a child hero for the kids. The bad guys are vanquished in the end making it a good movie for kids too. There is just a sense of overall goodness to the piece that well, leaves you feeling good. I liked it. I couldn't have imagined Purefoy in a fantasy type role, but he works! I think this will become a family favorite for my family.",1322870400,2,830,4.639455782312925

2200753,5,B000766XNK,With all the foul language and immorality coming out of Hollywood today you will appreciate movies like this one. I wish they made more of these type of movies today. You just have to go back in time to get the clean ones that don't run out of dialogue and start cussing and use sex to keep you watching. Its good to see the good guy is good all the way through. Usually a hero from our modern movies doesn't have any integrity to be a hero because of his character is worse than the villain.

You will laugh, I guarantee it, and you'll watch it more than just once.  You can tell that the actors and crew had a whale of a good time making it, and that really adds to the entertainment factor.

George heads to lands ruled by king edgar to find the kings daughter, princess lunna,(piper perabo)is missing, so he joins a knight named garth, (patrick swayze)to find her. Once george and some of his companions find her, she isn't alone, she's caring for a dragons egg, and she won't let anyone hurt it. Tarik searches to capture an outlaw name el cabillo, (val kilmer,who for some reason is uncredited) and they all meet up at the end. Not the best fantasy movie, but i found it enjoyable, and a good family picture, something the kids might like. limited violence, and i mean non bloody or graffic, there is plenty of fighting. The only negative thing i could say about this film (other than the skateboard scene) is the special fx, specificly the dragons. They could have done a better job with that, hell the movie dragonslayer came out in the mid 80's and there dragon was a hundred times better.",1296864000,,1182,4.6875
2200756,4,B000766XNK,"A funny, if predictable, take on the tale of St. George and the Dragon. The amusing characters more than make up for the predictable and slightly flat script. CGI is a bit low but it makes for an amusing Saturday afternoon movie.",1286150400,,229,4.476190476190476
2200757,4,B000766XNK,"I picked this up because I was looking for a decent fantasy movie I hadn't seen and, by heaven, I found one.  While a SyFy (SciFi) production, this lacks the usual required body count, and has more of a sense of humor to it.  It has some story problems, but the actors are uniformly good; many are excellent.  And though the CGI is dated, it's not the center of the movie, the characters are, and they're all interesting and fun.  The fights are fun as well, rollicking good fun, reminiscent of classic swashbucklers.  Not every joke or plot point lands, and this definitely isn't for people wanting grim and realistic fantasy.  But for those of us seeking a fun evening, for ourselves or our kids, with amusing characters and daring do, this flick is a pretty good choice.  I kinda wish they'd made a sequel.",1284595200,,809,4.537931034482758
2200758,4,B000766XNK,"Okay, I first saw this movie on SciFi, before it became SyFy.  Yes, it has some cheesy special effects, but not like most SciFi/SyFy movies.  It also has a fun cast, including Patrick Swayze (Come on, it's Patrick Swayze!  You know who he is), Michael Clarke Duncan (The Green Mile, Daredevil, among many voice acting roles), and the very attractive Piper Perabo (Who hasn't really been in much that I've seen).

Anyway, it's about a knight, who has returned from the Crusades, and just wants a place to settle down, and not have to kill anymore.  So, in order to get his plot of land, he has to go find the missing princess, and things go crazy because she's with a dragon!  It's definitely worth watching at least once.  Though, I would watch it many times, which is why I bought it!",1280534400,,785,4.485915492957746
2200759,3,B000766XNK,"GEORGE AND THE DRAGON, in reinterpreting the famous legend, isn't at all objectionable if you're viewing it with family, even if it's got the historical conviction of Michael Clarke Duncan - with his glaring American accent - playing a medieval Moor. There are a few touches I couldn't adjust to, such as Patrick Swayze - disinterested in his medieval mullet and muffled southern drawl - portraying an ambitious English lord or the aforementioned Duncan. At least the film doesn't take itself seriously. Within its confines it's a fun, modest adventure movie.

Sir George, newly returned from crusading in Jerusalem, has had enough of battle. The English knight longs for a small parcel of land to call home, and with the promise of such, he undertakes a quest to rescue a missing princess. But what if the princess doesn't want to be rescued?

Stirring the pot, the movie throws in a huge dragon egg in need of safeguarding and nasty brigands and savage Picts and even a cameo from an uncredited Val Kilmer. Sir George and the princess Lunna embark on one of those rocky romances, except that this doesn't sit too well with Swayze's shady noble since Lunna had been promised to him (er, No one puts Lunna in the corner?). Is it wrong that my favorite part is the outtakes reel during the closing credits? I pretty much knew the lay of the land once, early in the movie, that French monk careened his way on that makeshift skateboard. The CG is about what you'd expect from a low budget project.

James Purefoy, whom I last saw playing the disguised prince in A KNIGHT'S TALE, has got an English accent, and he is believable and appealing as the world-weary hero knight. The royal damsel in distress is played by an American, Piper Perabo, and her English accent comes and goes, but she's feisty and pretty and so deserves a mulligan. Her spunky princess regards dragons to be an endangered species and she actually gets the ball rolling by insisting that the dragon egg be protected. Sir George would rather just stab the egg a lot. One of the best things about this movie is the state of perplexity in which George falls into whenever he has to deal with the princess. Got to be love, right? GEORGE AND THE DRAGON isn't intended as an epic sword & sorcery story. The production values aren't really up to that scale. What this is, is a diverting family movie with unexpected anachronistic stabs at humor. For something that aired on that  shallow end of the pool we call the Sci-Fi Channel (when it comes to movies, anyway), this is pretty good stuff.",1275868800,,2553,4.666666666666667

2200762,3,B000766XNK,"The knight George comes home from crusade with a Moorish friend (shades of Prince of Thieves) and has to rescue a sassy Princess from a Dragon. But nothing is as it seems for the hapless band...

This film resembled Blackadder in terms of silliness, and comic content. George and his men have to fight 'picts'. Here they are blue painted neanderthals  with fuzzy red hair who communicate in grunts, and stand waiting for the knights to hit them.

The princess is the typical fiesty fantasy villian, who hits George over the head with a large bone, in an effort to stop him killing her cute little pet dragon that she has named Smyte.
She resembles and environmentalist, trying to save the endangered dragons.
George was rather a sappy wimp at the beginning, but develops towards the end, and everyone seems to be a pacifist.
The late Patrick Swayze stars as an arrogant and obnoxious knight, who spends much of his time swaggering about grinning. Yet he plays the part wonderfully.

I enjoyed it, in the way I often do these silly and far-fetched fantasy movies, but if you are looking for something realistic, and faintly accurate avoid this one.
Certainly one for the kids though, and grown ups who just want to relax.",1255046400,4,1220,4.713615023474178
2200763,4,B000766XNK,I really enjoyed this movie.  The only thing that could have used improvement was the special effects (the dragons).  James Purefoy was a sheer delight.

2200764,4,B000766XNK,"This fine bit of fluff starts with a war-weary knight returning to his homeland, wanting nothing more than to settle down into peaceful obscurity. The princess has gone mysteriously missing, however, and he takes on the quest to recover her.

That princess turns out to be the petite but spunky Lunna, played by Piper Perabo. She's doing quite nicely until some oafs started getting underfoot and trying to save her. The fact that she treats dragons as an endangered species and that the knights are the danger just adds to her problems. Throw in some bad guys, some good guys in surprising places, and a suit of chain mail tailored to Piper's compact and curvy form, and the story stands well away from the ordinary.

It's a great popcorn movie, kid-safe but with plenty to amuse a grown-up who's willing to be amused.

2200768,5,B000766XNK,"This movie didn't get a lot of publicity but it is a great family movie with values, responsibility and a little romance and fighting added.",1200182400,4,140,4.64
2200769,4,B000766XNK,"""George and the Dragon"" is a lighthearted adventure/comedy that brings to life one of Christianity's oldest legends- that of Saint George the dragon slayer. That may sound like a very serious matter, but the film, which gives the traditional story a whole new twist, is refreshingly light. It also has a wonderful variety of jokes and themes that make it amusing for the whole family.

Other than a great deal of swordplay, there is very little violence and I wouldn't think twice about allowing a young child to watch it. My only concern *SPOILER ALERT* would be the scene in which the priest appears to be sliced open. Even though they realize afterwards that, rather than blood, the red substance flowing from his side is burgundy, the scene paints a graphic picture at first and might upset a child. *END OF SPOILER*

I was thrilled to see James Purefoy playing the lead in something other than a horror flick and, thankfully, he didn't disappoint. He makes the perfect chivalrous knight. His scenes with Piper Perabo are absolutely hysterical; they played well opposite each other.

The whole movie is flippant and slightly irreverent, but it brings home a good message about tolerance without getting overly preachy. My only complaint was that the writing could have been a bit more original in places- There were a few instances in which I could almost speak along with the film the first time seeing it.

All in all, I found ""George and the Dragon"" to be an entertaining period film with an excellent cast. It's certainly a movie I'll watch again and again!",1199404800,,1565,4.806691449814126
2200770,4,B000766XNK,"The story revolves around a medieval knight fighting to restore a kingdom while saving a princess that is protecting a dragon. When our hero first returns from the crusades we see a muslim friend of his dispatched and the knight that did so invade England with Vikings. We then see the hero sent on a quest with another knight to kill a dragon and save the Kings daughter. Now what makes this story is the comedy and surprises thrown in. Loosely based on the George and the Dragon tale, this is one version the whole family is sure to enjoy.

As I watched this wonderfully entertaining Fantasy I wondered how did I miss this coming out in 2003? This is a fun movie for the whole family and I think it must of been in a tough crowd of releases in 2003. Otherwise we would have heard more before now. The whole cast is great and includes cameos from Patrick Swayze and Val Kilmer. I highly recommend if you enjoy  fantasy movies with comedy like ""Dragonheart"". Good quality DVD with no extras. I intend to get a copy because it has good replayability. - C. Luster",1198713600,2,1061,4.408163265306122

2200774,5,B000766XNK,"I loved this movie. It has everything you need for a great ""feelgood"" movie - an amazing cast, well done comedy, and an exciting plotline.

This is probably the only light-hearted fantasy I've seen in years. It was a much-needed vacation from constant death, gore, and overdone acting. In fact, this movie had basically no gore at all - in one scene when the priest is slashed the red liquid that pours out of the wound turns out to be wine from a satchel!

This movie made me feel like I was watching the great ""Dragonheart"" for the first time all over again. It had this great little tune to go along with it just like Dragonheart, as well.

I'd never really seen much of James Purefoy until now - and I'm surprised that he wasn't the star of all of those other great movies like ""A Knight's Tale."" He played this part very well, and I'm sure he could go really far with the role of a knight.

The comedy was great and by no means offensive or excessive in any way.

The acting in this movie wasn't notable - but by that I mean that it wasn't overdone. The actors didn't seem like they were full of themselves the whole time. In fact, they actually acted natural, as if they were actually trying to entertain the audience and not attempting to outdo Shakespeare.

Purefoy, as I stated above, was a joy to watch, and who doesn't like the beautiful and lovely Piper Perabo? The costumes in this movie, and especially hers - were refreshingly simple. You could really see the actors and not just their makeup. Now I admit that Patrick Swayze wasn't fit for the part and his accent seemed pretty heavily American, but the way he played the part still helped the audience identify more with the protagonists. I still appreciated Swayze's effort to play a fantasy role -he played the part as good as anyone, really. The other actors were actually really good - Duncan was funny and friendly, and the priest and nuns were just as funny and likeable as James and Piper.

I don't remember when was the last time I actually got all the way through a fantasy movie with a smile on my face (besides the Lord of the Rings). They're all so dark and overdone that it's a disgrace. A few laughs and friendly dragons isn't going to hurt anybody - I feel much happier after seeing that some people still appreciate the good things in literature and legend. Fantasy isn't about showing the most gore or making the most convoluted plot, but creating the most awe-inspiring environment around the viewer. This movie definitely did that. It was almost better than ""Dragonheart.""",1184457600,,2558,4.523809523809524

2200777,5,B000766XNK,"I am a grandfather, and I watched this movie with my three-year-old grandson, and we both really enjoyed the movie.  I found nothing in this movie that would be questionable for children.  Some might think the big fight near the end would be too violent for kids, but this grandson clearly understood that the bad guys were being beaten.  I have to say 'beaten' because I don't recall the  movie showing anyone being killed.  Even when the priest was struck, and 'blood' gushed out, it turned out to be his secret wineskin that was cut!  Then, even though the movie didn't show it actually happen, my grandson figured out that the dragon had eaten the final bad guy!  While, the movie was simple enough for a preschool boy to understand, it was entertaining enough for his grandpa to enjoy it as well.  And, Grandma, walking in and out of the room, said she wanted to watch it when she had time!  This is a very enjoyable family fantasy movie.",1181260800,103,943,4.5325443786982245
2200778,5,B000766XNK,"The other reviewer is correct, there is nothing historically correct about this movie. It's not a serious movie at all. I first saw this when it ran on the Sci-Fi network & after seeing it knew I would order it when it became available on DVD. It's a very cute movie. It's humorous, entertaining, has it's dramatic moments, good story line, memorable characters, etc... What I really like about this one is that it roots for the dragon rather than against it. It's also a movie that I think would be good for the family to watch together. I don't recall there being anything very questionable about it. There aren't alot of movies out there that I would feel comfortable watching with my nieces and nephews, but this would be one of them. So, those with kids would probably like this movie for a family movie night.",1181174400,14,815,4.551020408163265
