8079274,5,B000AS1KXS,"Well one of the movies had rather poor visual quality, Gothic. Overall I enjoyed these old, fun scary movies from back in the day. I'm in my fifties and thought I'd seen it all. But not so! Movies back then relied less on special effects and more on the actors and actresses ability to sell the story and draw the viewers into their world. Where you went from there could get kind of trippy. But that's cool.",1475107200,,408,4.311688311688312
8079275,3,B000AS1KXS,"I bought this 9 movies collection on 3 DVDs at my local Walmart for only five dollars. None of the movies have been restored, so the picture qualities are average at best.

The movies are:

Disc 1:

Gothic

The Devil's Nightmare

The House on the Edge of the Park

Disc 2:

Bloody Pit of Horror

Horrors of Spider Island

Sisters of Death

Disc 3:

Terror Creatures From the Grave

The Night She Arose from the Tomb

The Vampire's Niece

Gothic starring Gabriel Byrne, Julian Sands and Natasha Richardson, is the best movie from this DVD set. There are several European movies including the sick and twisted The House on the Edge of the Park.",1346457600,,642,4.517543859649122
8079276,2,B000AS1KXS,"This was an OK collection.  I had mainly purchased it because it was relatively cheap and I love horror flicks.  I think Gothic had its creepy moments and David Hess was brutal in House at the Edge of the Park, but not as much so, like he was in Last House on the Left.  Most of it was pretty cheesy, like The Horror of Spider Island, but over all I was entertained, and that's really what it is all about, right.  I wouldn't pay more than the ten I paid for it though.",1233360000,,469,4.010752688172043
8079277,1,B000AS1KXS,"Being a big MST3K fan, I bought this collection thinking that it would be a collection of chessy horror movies that I could watch with my bros, poke fun at, and have a good laugh. Sadly, that was not the case...
Horrorlicious is a collection of some of the dumbest, most graphic, and widely unfrightening horror collections available!
Most of the movie are just plain boring, or appear to be porno under the weak disguise of being a horror movie. 2 Good examples of this are on disc 1, ""The Devil's Nightmare"" & ""House on the Edge of the Park"" there's nothing really scary about them at all, they're just a bunch of torture scenes & gratuitous nudity. House on the Edge of the Park really disturbed me... It's literally packed with nudity, seriously, you can't go five minutes without seeing full frontal female nudity! However, it's not at all enjoyable since all but one of the nude scenes involves rape or torture!

I namely bought this collection for ""Horrors of Spider Island"" but it wasn't worth it... Without the cast of Mystery Science Theater 3000 making fun of it, it isn't at all amusing, just a long, boring, and bad movie...

If you're looking for a decent collection of horror movies, look elsewhere...
If you're a fan of MST3K or just enjoy watching cheesy horror movies with your friends, check out my other reviews, you'll find a fair amount there.
If you like terrible horror movies, look no further...",1206748800,4,1420,4.676
8079278,3,B000AS1KXS,"Did you ever stay up late and watch horror movies introduced by Elvira, or on some Monster Theater cheese fest?  If so this is a good collection for you.  Some of the movies like Gothic are genuinely creepy, and even have actors you might recognize, but the rest are pure and simple cheesy fun.  Watch them in a dark room with someone who spooks easily and enjoy!",1205366400,2,363,4.388059701492537
8079279,4,B000AS1KXS,"This dvd collection is a fantastic grouping of some rarely seen films from the 70's and 80's .There are some slight problems with picture clarity on some of the features, but nothing too terrible. I highly recommend ""Horrorlicius"" for genre fans looking for something different.

8079280,3,B000AS1KXS,"From fiction based on life to the most terrifying of nightmares, HORRORLICIOUS has enough gore to satisfy the heartiest of fright film fans. Vintage Euro-terror (including movies from Belgium and Yugoslavia) is featured almost exclusively here.

GOTHIC is loosely based on Mary Shelley's life. With her poet-husband Percy and their poet-friend Lord Byron, Mary indulges in sex, drugs and minuets. Their wanton behavior was the supposed fuel for her novel, ""Frankenstein.""

Castles figure prominently in three titles: DEVIL'S NIGHTMARE, BLOODY PIT and VAMPIRE'S NIECE. Along for the ride are Satan, the undead and a crazed executioner. (Heads will roll, as they say...)

Invite two maniacs to your party and what do you get? Find out in HOUSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK.

A vengeful army of zombies wreak havoc in TERROR CREATURES.

A class reunion of sorts is central to SISTERS OF DEATH.

BLOODY PIT features lovely models, and so does SPIDER ISLAND. (SPIDER ISLAND is considered a porno-bomb, for what it's worth.) There's also a group of gorgeous gals in VAMPIRE'S NIECE-- seems like a trend here, no?

Misplaced anger causes a nobleman to murder redheaded women in THE NIGHT SHE AROSE (guess what color his dead wife's hair was?).
