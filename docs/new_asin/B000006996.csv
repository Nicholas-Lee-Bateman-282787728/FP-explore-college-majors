7903918,1,B000006996,I'm a real Carrie fisher fan. So I look forward to this kind of obscure movie hoping that it would be another look at her talent. I can't really recall when this was made but I can only tell you that it was like something on a high school group would put together. No plot no dialogue I couldn't even make myself finish it.,1495670400,,323,4.0625
7903919,2,B000006996,"Sort of a ""B"" film. Not in a silly, fun or campy way, just ""B"".",1493424000,,63,3.2666666666666666
7903920,4,B000006996,"Dark humor, but very funny.  I wasn't sure what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised.  The acting performances are very good and they are a few laugh out loud moments. If you have a quirky sense of humor, you might enjoy this film.",1489968000,,235,4.318181818181818
7903921,5,B000006996,"I love a good ""B"" grade movie. A few years ago I started a new hobby of finding, collecting and watching movies that had some of my favorite actresses and actors in the cast. I love Star Wars, so naturally I had to have a copy of this film, with Carrie Fisher in the cast, how could I go wrong. The answer is that I did not.

Paul (Robert Joy) is a meek electrician who, with his nagging, dominating wife Beatrice, moves to a new house in a neighborhood stricken by a series of robberies. That night, the gang responsible breaks into their house, beats up Paul, murders Bea, and makes off with the valuables. As Paul is coming to terms with his wife's death, she appears as a ghost only he can see and hear. What is worse, she will not let her husband rest until he care of the only hurdle that stands between her and peace in the afterlife: revenge. Relentlessly Bea irritates him, nagging him into hitting the streets to seek revenge by killing all of the members of the gang that took her life. Paul, a repairman of what seems to be limitless skill devises more and more elaborate ways of disposing of the men who killed his wife. Early on in the film one of their new neighbors gets wind of Paul's dirty deeds and offers his services in helping him dispose of the bodies. With his new sidekick, a garbage man named Sherman Bloom (Matthew Cowles) adds his own brilliance to the mission of vengeance.

END OF SPOILERS.

This was a fun piece of work,and I endorse the watching of this film to anyone who wants to pass an afternoon with some good clean, harmless fun. The plot is silly, and it is a light film that is meant to be laughed at, not challenge to the intellect. If you are looking for a good time, check this little gem out.",1229385600,3,1901,4.301675977653631

She returns from the grave wanting her husband to kill all of the guys who were responsible for her death. I guess this is supposed to be a dark comedy, but its not funny, and the movie draggs on.",1134950400,,296,4.120689655172414
