8137976,5,B000HBL6U0,Charlie Rose is the man when it comes to cordial but indepth interviews.  To get the creator and cast of the West Wing around one table is a feat and a treat.  To have them interviewed by someone as  good as Charlie Rose is epic.  A true collector's item for a West Wing fan.,1414800000,,275,4.037037037037037
8137977,1,B000HBL6U0,"Consistent with the Charlie Rose brand, this is a DVD of a good quality conversation seen and heard around a table. No commercials; No flashing lights; No fancy sets; No rapid fire camera cuts. Just good conversation with the each speaker's face and voice being followed with straight cameras cuts and followed by the microphones, although this episode did have some microphone problems that occurred during the taping.
  The microphone issue is excusable because it appears that at some point in the show one of the guest may have lost his microphone entirely, placing the operator of the audio console at an extreme disadvantage because in a spontaneous conversation, which this one is, there is no going back! What you see and hear are what you get.
  HOWEVER.... Unfortunately, the DVD of this episode, which I purchased from Amazon dot com, is too painful to watch because of a needless defect that this DVD certainly suffered during the manufacturing process.
  The ENTIRE program on this DVD is out of lip sync by at least 2 frames, perhaps 3. It makes for good listening but watching is painful because of the annoying and needless error. The defect is made worse by the repeated perpetuation of the identical error; an error that causes the loss of lip sync. This error is correctable by the manufacturer.
  A digital video signal may be required to take various paths during the production, and subsequent post-production, of television programs. Sometimes a necessary path will introduce a 1 frame delay in the video signal. If the audio is not delay to compensate, the picture ends up out of lip sync by 1 frame. Do this same error several times or more and you get this DVD.
  During the production and post-production of this DVD titled ""Charlie Rose - An Conversation about THE WEST WING with its creative team"" a video delay occurred several times and each time the audio was NOT corrected to match.
  The result is the DVD virtually un-usable except for those who enjoy pain in one hour doses.
  WHEN the Charlie Rose people do pull these defective DVDs and issue corrected ones to the marketplace it is hoped and prayed that some one in his office will take the opportunity to correct the basic grammatical error that is presently printed on the DVD. The title reads ""Charlie Rose - An conversation about THE WEST WING with its creative team.""
  ""An conversation""? Come on! This is elementary school stuff for crying out loud.

8137978,4,B000HBL6U0,"This DVD is an interesting item to collect for lovers of The West Wing. It was recorded around the time of the end of Season 2. I was a bit surprised that Allison Janney wasn't more of a focus in the question and answers - she seemed content to be an observer most of the time. Or maybe that was the way it was edited. Also the sound quality is not great. It is often difficult to hear comments and funny asides the actors make when the microphone is not on them. Anyway, I enjoy having this among my collection and I think other people would too.",1197849600,7,547,4.121495327102804
