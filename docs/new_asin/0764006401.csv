The video is very true to the book, for instance, lines directly from Dicken's text are used throughout the movie, and it's all very well put together.

3459,4,0764006401,"Taking Charles Dickens' 521 page novel and turning it into a film is no easy matter, but this version seems to do a good job, following the life of Pip, the poor-turned-rich-turned-poor again young man who wants to become a gentleman.  Although this version doesn't offer many radical elements from the director, it does show chaos and darkness in the seeking of fortunes and offers a look into the neurotic behaviors lurking in our lives.  These expectations may not be great, but they certainly are worth watching.",977443200,2,516,4.919540229885057
3460,4,0764006401,"I enjoyed this movie very much.  After just finishing the novel I bought  this movie.  I was really happy to see how close they stayed to the actual  book.  Most other movies take advantage of it.  This is a must! The camera  work done in the film is also really great.  I especially loved the way  that they ended it.  Ioan is fabulous and Charlotte shines as  Miss. Havisham.  Orlick was amazing!!  In fact everything about this movie  was!

3461,4,0764006401,"I originally only watched this movie because Ioan Gruffudd, my favorite actor is in it.  I saw him in Horatio Hornblower (which I reccomend you see also) and he was breathtaking.  So I figured that Great Expectations would  be just as wonderful.  It was very good, but not as interesting as HH.  Ioan, again, played his part with an enormous amount of emotion.  But I can  see why Horatio Hornblower won and the Emmy and not Great Expectations.  Don't get me wrong, it certainly held my interest, I watched it both nights  on PBS that it was on.  But it was slightly strange.  I can't see why it  ended the way it did.  (You'll have to see it to understand what I'm  talking about!)  But I did enjoy it, and reccomend it to anyone who likes  Charles Dickons and period pieces.",956793600,4,776,4.397163120567376
3462,5,0764006401,"The entire production of ""Great Expectations"" is superb, with an outstanding cast, but the heart and soul of this movie is the actor, Ioan Gruffudd. He is heartbreakingly wonderful as this essentially good but  misguided young man.  I think his acting is some of the best I have ever  seen, particularly the prison scene with Joe, as well as his desperate  pleading to Estella as she leaves to wed another.  This is a beautifully  done work of art.",932601600,2,448,4.67948717948718
3463,4,0764006401,"This stripped down version might not please the purists, but it's compelling and gripping nonetheless.  Beautifully acted by a stellar cast.  Ioan Gruffudd shines as Pip.  Pip undergoes profound change throughout the  story, and there's not a false moment in Gruffudd's performance.  Ian  McDiarmid as Pip's creepy guardian Mr. Jaggers and Charlotte Rampling as  the creepy Miss Havisham also excel.  Another superb BBC production.",932428800,,431,5.625
3464,5,0764006401,Dickens has rarely been adapted better. The final scenes of Pip reconciled to his fate reciting Greek to the dying Magwitch is pure cinematic poetry.

3465,5,0764006401,"For some reason it seems fashionable to criticize this production, mainly because it carries old footage from Masterpiece Theatre, hosted by Russell Baker.  Further, this film was sponsored by Mobil Oil Co. and produced by the BBC.  In addition, some reviewers may see it competing with the classic starring John Mills and Alec Guinness from 1947.  Moreover, since this 1999 film was made, weve had the 2011 production starring Gillian Anderson and other versions, as well.  But viewers who fail to see this 3-hour epic from 1999 are really missing the best rendition of what may be Charles Dickens best novel.  The story is timeless and inspiring; the romance, touching and well-portrayed.  TV simply cant be better than this.

Casting is almost perfect with a young Ioan Gruffudd playing the grown up Pip and Gabriel Thomson the young Pip.  They look so much alike youd swear they're related in real life.  Beyond this, Charlotte Rampling seems an ideal choice for the quirky Miss Havisham, as does Justine Waddell playing the wounded Estella.  Other cast members, like those playing Magwich, Jaggers, Herbert Pocket, Joe, Wemmick, Molly, et al are equally well-chosen.

The ending of this story is not really a happy one.  Abel Magwich meets a grisly end, Miss Havisham is burned alive, and the romance between Pip and Estella seems to be in limbo.  One has to be reminded that Charles Dickens wrote the story and did two versions of the ending.  This is the happier of the two.

I don't know what other reviewers are talking about when they find fault with how dark and grim this production seems.  Im sure its exactly what Dickens would have wanted and exactly right for 1999.  No, I wouldnt object if the video were re-mastered into true HD-widescreen but I felt Id waited long enough to see this flim again.  No sign of a re-generation was found from BBC so I purchased it at a decent price on the secondary market.  If and when a re-mastered version of this classic appears I will want to buy it.

Summing up, those who haven't seen this version of Great Expectations shouldnt wait any longer.  Go and buy a copy from one of the Amazon re-sellers like I did.  This is the best version you will find and its production values are fine for now.  When a re-mastered version is released, Ill buy it.",1390694400,3,2303,4.716791979949875
3466,5,0764006401,"I love this novel and I know all its versions, even the ultra-rare Classics
comic, and this is by far the best adaptation. First of all, it's the closest
to the book, character by character, and it's also beautifully directed and
acted. It's true Personenregie: you really feel the relationships among the
people--the protagonist and his brother-in-law, his sister, Estella, Herbert
Pocket (here, Daniel Evans, looking really cute in the role Alec Guiness played
for David Lean in the famous film), Miss Havisham, and of course Abel Magwitch,
the convict who sets the story in motion. Dickens lovers: seek no more. This is

3467,4,0764006401,"My mother came to visit me recently and she wanted to know what movie I had for her to watch. I showed her and my aunt this movie and they were completely captivated. It is a good story especially if you are a romantic. However I was not so keen on the ending. It seemed like there should have been something more. Something more dramatic. Also at some points in the movie things got a little slow and it took patience to get past the scenes. I did think Charlotte Rampling was a perfect Miss Havisham and Justine Waddell was perfect as Estella. Ioan Gruffudd also expressed his emotions very well in each scene without being overly dramatic. This film portrays jealousy and love very well. It is a classic after all.

I never read the book so I can't say how faithful this adaption was. The beginning dragged for nearly an hour. Maybe another writer or director would have done better? There were a lot of close-up shots as you would expect from a movie made for television. Charles Dickens's story tells how riches can make an average man into a gentleman, and no one seems to care as to the origin of these riches. Could someone who becomes wealthy through illegal or unethical means become a respected gentleman? Yes, it has happened many times. There once was a book that told about the History of the Great American Fortunes. There may be comparable books today, if they could be published.",1360627200,3,3355,4.468189233278956

3473,5,0764006401,"I have loved this version ever since it was aired on PBS' Masterpiece Theatre. The production values are very high here, as the sets, costuming, and cinematography are top-notch. The acting is first-rate here as well. In my humble opinion, Charlotte Rampling IS MIss Havisham. She embodies the complicated, subtle malice of a woman gone mad and Hell-bent on wreaking slow vengeance on the world, and the male sex in particular. And while this doesn't have a ""happy ending"", per se, Dickens' felt it appropriate to leave us with an ambiguous ending (albeit after changing the original ending), and I think it suits the film after the rest of it is very dark and sad. It would have seemed foolish for a happy ending to pop up out of nowhere. This version comes HIGHLY recommended!

3475,5,0764006401,"One of the cruelest stories I know. Dickens is so cruel we cannot imagine he is a man, what's more a humane human being.

A poor orphan, Pip, is raised by a poor blacksmith. A life of rough and tough luck. Take it or leave it, but there is no way out, except the radical one. And he dreams of being a gentleman one day. An aberration of course, morally wrong and bad taste.

He is selected and invited by Miss Havisham, a deranged rich woman who is mourning in total decay and sorrow after the failure of her wedding when the bridegroom did not come, twenty years before. Her objective is to provide a male companion and eventually husband to her adopted daughter, Estella.

But one night on the moor Pip is ""accosted"" by an prison escapee of some kind who asks for food and the boy of six or seven, maybe eight provides in the night, including a file for him to get rid of his manacles. He will turn up as his benefactor.

Luck, luck and luck. But then systematically Dickens shatters every single opportunity and hope on the side of the boy, Pip, who ends up in prison for unpaid debts, on the side of his benefactor, Abel, who will die in prison holding Pip's hand after his final arrest, on the side of Miss Havisham who will achieve none of her plans, on the side of Estella who will marry the rich and noble young man, will be brutalized and will end up alone in Miss Havisham's house, on the side of Biddy who will marry Joe the Blacksmith when Pip finally realizes she had been his closest ever friend, and even on the side of Estella who will refuse to requite Pip's love, though she will accept to make him her platonic companion in Miss Havisham's.redecorated house.

That cruelty is so extreme that we just wonder if Dickens then is not going through a phase of complete social rejection, rejection of the upper classes, rejection of the lower classes, rejection of justice, rejection of any discourse about the possible improvement of individuals and society. Absolute resignation and pessimistic submission to a totally inhumane world that only has some small pockets of satisfaction, but never for yourself, always for some rare others. He did not even salvage the exiled criminal who became Pip's benefactor, as Victor Hugo did in Les Misrables, and makes him die a solitary, nearly solitary death in prison with the sole company of the young man he tried and failed to help, and unaware of his daughter's fate, which does not seem to be particularly brilliant anyway, since she is Estella, daughter of a female assassin and a male exiled criminal condemned to absolute reclusion for life.

I just wonder if here Dickens does not reach Zola's pessimism who considered that anyone born in a criminal circle could only be that and drag everyone around him down into that criminal circle. No salvation for those who are badly born. The belief in an elected people turned into a savage and wild social Darwinism: some have been elected to be crushed and powdered by life as slowly as possible for them to regret ever being born but absolutely unable to shorten the ordeal.

Sad and sad and sad.

3476,4,0764006401,"I agree with the previous reviewer that the preview is stupid; it's actually the first 2 mins and credits of the film.  However, I have seen the full movie several times and I think this is an outstanding version of ""Great Expectations.""

3480,5,0764006401,"Great expectations is a fine novel and is easier to get into than some of Dicken's longer tomes. This adaption is a fine one, which makes me recall the other fine BBC adaption of Bleak House in 2008(?). Both adaptions avoid sentimentality and are complemented by fine low key background music. I was particularly taken by the beauty of the marsh scenes. My one reservation was that perhaps Rampling is too fine a woman to be playing Havisham. Pip was done excellently as was stella and I was very much taken with the characther playing Joe. A fine adaption - well done BBC!",1251849600,,573,4.572815533980583
3481,3,0764006401,"I know many people seem to love this WGBH, Masterpiece Theatre 1999 production of Charles Dickens' novel ""Great Expectations."" However, I did not greatly enjoy this adaptation as many people have.

My reasons:

- The picture quality is not much better than the 1981 version. Therefore, my eyes are just as content to watch the 1981 version, which develops the characters much better (even if it drags on at times.)

- This production does not develop Orick's character, or Estella's character early in the production. In fact, Mr. Pumblechook and other characters are also not as developed as I would have wished.

- Dickens' novel drags on in the middle. This production greatly contracts the plot in the central half of the novel. For example, Bentley Drummel and Matthew Pocket's characters are not developed very well in the middle part of this work. Matthew's father is nearly eliminated.

- This words spoken in this production have been updated from the 1981 adaptation and the novel. In fact, the 1974 adaptation is more accurate than this 1999 production as pertains to including famous quotes from the novel.

One positive of this adaptation is that the mood (the psychology) of this adaptation is better than the 1981 version or any other version I have seen. A second positive is that the acting is this production is just as good as the 1981 adaptation.

In summary:
I prefer the 1981 version best (even though I would only give it a 4 star). However, this production is better than the 1974 Michael York/Sarah Miles adaptation, which completely eliminates the character of Orlick.

For people who want a film to watch for pleasure (rather than to prepare for a major content examination), this adaptation may be the most interesting and best choice. Otherwise, I would recommend the much longer 1981 adaptation.",1243468800,2,1825,4.9411764705882355
3482,3,0764006401,"This latest version of Dickens' sprawling novel of love, jealousy, betrayal, and redemption is a faithful (or as much as possible, even in a 3-hr production) rendering.  It is well cast, with Ioan Gruffudd as the most handsome Pip on film, and Charlotte Rampling giving her usual regal performance as Miss Havisham.

Production design is good, with grim revisionist views of 18th century London typical of modern adaptations.  Photography is first rate.

What is unacceptable is that the DVD is, apparently, recorded straight off the PBS broadcast -- just as if you recorded it yourself -- complete with all the ads for Mobil, lugubrious intoductions by the pedantic host of Masterpiece Theatre, and PBS icons lingering for 30 seconds at a time throughout the film.  Distracting, annoying, and unacceptable.

Order the Region 2 disc from the BBC if you can play it.  One should not pay a high price for a DVD that one could record off the air, and is little more than an ad for Mobil and PBS.",1230595200,2,992,4.8
3483,5,0764006401,"Julian Jarrold's adaptation shines not because of its faithfulness to the plot of the novel, but because of its effective use of character and mood. Both Abel Magwitch and Miss Havisham appear as ominous figures, much more so than in any other attempt to put Dickens' classic novel to film. Ioan Gruffuld's Pip, likewise, is more frightened as a child, more vulnerable as an adult, than we have ever seen him before. Estella is crueler and more beautiful. The mood throughout, from Pip's strange encounter in the graveyard, to his peculiar encounter with Orlick, to his final encounter with Estella, is often more grim, never more comic than the Dickens. A cloud seems to hang over everything, even its brightest comic moments, offered up in the movie by Wemmick and Herbert.

Often, what works well in a novel does not work well on screen. Jarrold understands this, and presents Dickens' characters as real human beings, establishes a setting that complements mood, and creates a version of 'Great Expectations' that is, in my opinion, one of the best every made.",1224979200,3,1064,4.944134078212291

3485,1,0764006401,"The 1947-version is the best version, with John Mills, father of Haley Mills. I give the 1947-version 4-stars. The 1947-version is good.

In this 2004-version; actress, Justine Waddell, who was great as the sweet and wonderful Molly in ""Wives and Daughters"", co-stars. Here she plays an attractive woman, who has been raised by her jilted, grandmother to intentionally misuse and abuse men, who are infatuated with her beauty. She plays this part effectively as you feel the young man's emptiness in the end. However, I could not get into this version

The 1981-version has a better first episode; but then drags.

The book's author, Charles Dickens, married his wife Catherine in 1836. They were together 21-years, and had ten children. During his marriage Dickens wrote his brilliant novels: ""Oliver Twist"" 1839, ""A Christmas Carol"" 1843, and ""David Copperfield"" 1850. Mr. Dickens divorced his wife in 1858. Mr. Dickens wrote the story ""Great Expectations"" after his divorce in 1861. Divorce affects everyone no matter the circumstances. The 1947-version of ""Great Expectations"" is a good movie, but I did not like the part about the jilted, bitter, wealthy, old, grandmother; living in the dark, big house; with the dining-room and food left untouched for 50-years. Yet, if you persist through these strange scenes; the 1947-version is interesting later on in the film. I realize this woman is a necessary part of the story, but the film should have been much briefer with her.

Charles Dickens's book ""Oliver Twist"" is wordy, long, and daunting, unless you are a strong and imaginative reader. The ""Oliver Twist"" DVD is great for the rest of us, because the story has been so polished and streamlined by so many people. Before TV and movies; before radio, every town had a theatre that performed plays. Every town in England and America performed the play ""Oliver Twist""; for 90-years, until sound movies. For 90-years; these towns kept polishing the story and improving upon each other. Today; on DVD, the polished story skips along without a bump. The story ""Great Expectations"" did not get this polishing in the theatre and has a few bumps. Yet, even with the bumps; the 1947-version is a good story.",1175731200,2,2207,5.038356164383561

As a British review on Amazon uk site indicated this DVD looks as if it was copied straight off the TV and also the commentary in the beginning and end of the movie telling us about the Great Expectations novel made the DVD worse.

Masterpiece Theatre has spoiled this Great BBC Production of Dickens Great Expectations with it's Commentary (even though they think they are being helpful- but are not) and poor DVD.

This excellent film adaptation of the masterpiece novel manages to be somewhat dark, gritty, and mysterious, and still maintain quirky memorable characters and a tangled web of plots in the typical Dickens way. Justine Waddell's performance as the icy Estella (a very different role from her warm character in ""Wives and Daughters"") is perfect, complimented by Ioan Gruffud's dramatic display as the hero of story, Pip. The movie is fairly true to the book, and likewise manages to be ambiguous, but satisfying.

Charlotte Rampling as Miss Havisham is younger, more beautiful and a bit more sane than she is usually portrayed but the part is well acted.  The actors playing Joe Gargory, Magwich, Remmick, Orlick and Jaggers are all well suited to their parts and do admirable jobs.  The movie has quite a dark and sinister mood and a lot of the characters that provide comic relief in the book including Pumblechook, Wopsle, the Pocket family, and Clara's father are eliminated or have the humorous aspect's of their characters trimmed leaving us nothing to laugh at.  A brooding musical score and lots of scenes of the desolate marshlands, dirty London and the decay of Miss Havisham's house also contribute to the somber mood.",1154476800,2,877,4.859060402684563
3491,4,0764006401,"There is a definitive modern flavor to this classic by Dickens, yet the handling of the story is very dignified and seems to translate to film almost perfect. Mobile Masterpiece Theatre's telling of Great Expectations accounts for many of the most important parts of the story, and those who have never read the book (or, those who chose not to read it in high school), will have an easy time understanding the story of Pip's rise and fall in both love and status. Certainly this is not some cheesy modern remake that tries to be hip and cool; instead it modernizes the tale in a way that is very ""Dickenseque.""

One of the greatest strengths of the film is characterization. Some may see Estella and Miss Havisham as being a little more ""sensitive and kind"" in this version compared to the novel, but overall they fit their roles well. Ioan Gruffudd does a superb job of Pip as an adult, who learns of his great expectations and tries to use these to gain a better status in life .Abel Magwitch, who is the convict who helps Pip earn a better life, is also played very similar to the character in the novel. I also felt that Joe was depicted essentially as the character in the book, and he really brings to life his love for Pip despite the fact that Pip at times resents him. Some of the other minor characters are also fun to watch: Mr. Jaggers, Mr. Wemmick, Mr. Pumblechook, Herbert Pocket, Biddy. The great thing about Dickens' characters is that they are unique and, at times, eccentric and, as a viewer, you can readily identify those characteristics as they come up in the film.

Another aspect of the film that was refreshing was just the scenery. The scene at the beginning with Pip encountering the convict in the cemetery, the grassland scene at the beginning and the end of the movie, and the dreariness of London (as Pip first arrives) all seem to be very illustrative of the attitude of the film.

One disappointing aspect of the film was that, at times, it was too obvious and blatant. It's almost as if the director decided that people were ""too lazy"" to understand certain parts, so they just thought they'd have a character ""fill in"" exactly what happened  rather than trying to let you decide on your own or show the scene the way it was intended. One example of this is the conflicts between Pip and Orlick.

Approximately 3 hours in length, this film still manages to cut quite a bit from the book and seem relatively short in length. I highly recommend this version, and it is much better than the Ethan Hawke/ Gwyneth Paltrow version of Great Expectations, which is very loose in its translation.

If you are looking for a modernized version of a great classic by Dickens, this is it. This film also works well for any teachers who want to do a comparison between the film and the book.

This IS the performance that aired here on Masterpiece Theatre in 1999 (it like other stuff on the WGBH label includes Russell Baker's openings and closing (singular as he did not do a closing for part 1).  There is another BBC release from 1981 also on DVD which I do not know anything about.  This version came out around the time the ""modern version"" shown on the big screen with Gwyneth Paltrow came out which takes place in modern Miami.  Suffice it to say, this is the second time Masterpiece Theatre aired a true representation of this classic while the big screen put out a flop (the first time was Moll Flanders in 1996 which sad to say the single disc copy I bought here at Amazon is no longer in print and who knows how the double disc rerelease is doing).  Ioan Gruffudd as Pip is as great as his performance in Hornblower.  It also tells most of the story which several of the big screen versions leave out.  If you are building a library of ""Masterpiece Theatre"" classics, then (even though it only aired in 99) this belongs in that library.",1132790400,39,1117,4.472906403940887

Havisham and Orlick's revenge on Pip, so I got on the internet and searched for about an hour or more to find THIS version and I do not regret it. There are SO many other versions out there but none compare, especially the one with Gwenith Paltrow (*tutts). The cover of that one implies that it's a porn! and the only simularity between the movie and book was the title. Anyways, this movie is the best! It was just so awesome, I cannot even put it into words. The actors were brilliant and the director - phenominal! I do admit that I was a bit dissapointed when I found out that Orlick merely met Pip on the street and decided to kill him rather than the clever kidnapping, and I was looking for at least a wince from Pip after being burned severely. But, I guess, the producers had to make it fit into at least two tapes. Anyways, I love this movie. Sure, there were some faults but I can count up a lot more in the Brad Pitt, Gary Oldman, and Leo DiCaprio movies. E-mail me to discuss more!

3494,1,0764006401,"Firstly I have to say that this is not a Mobile Masterpiece production it is a BBC production.  The production itself is excellent, my favorite adaption of the Charles Dickens novel.

Unfortunately the DVD has been put together as if you are watching the production on television.  There is an introduction by an American presenter who states that what you are watching is a Mobile production.  This is tolerable but once you start watching you find that little icons appear on the screen as would appear on television (I think they are to inform the viewer that wide screen is available).  Finally, before the end credits of the first part, you get to see what will be in next weeks episode.

It would have been a simple matter to take the original recording as supplied by the BBC and use this one for the DVD.  For some reason the DVD producer decided that is was better to have exactly the same recording as was shown on American television.

If you want to get a copy of this production I would recommend getting one that was made for the British market.",1114646400,41,1059,4.536842105263158
3495,2,0764006401,"I've never read Dickens, or watched any movies/tv series based on any his novels, so I don't know what is from the book and what is from the movie director. I really enjoy historical dramas, especially BBC tv series. In this Great Expectations, the acting was good, especially the heartless little Estella. However, what I didn't like about the movie:
1. Too much scenery, not enough interaction. Instead of 10 seconds of Pip walking on the moors, we get 30 seconds. The same goes for birds flying, waves on the water, Pip walking through dark tunnels, Pip walking through dark streets, Pip walking up stairs, Pip rowing a boat. Pip opening doors and walking down dark hallways. Lots of extended scenes of scenery and no character conversations. Also, there're lots of scenes of Pip and Miss Haversham, Joe and the convict. But, there's next to no scenes of Pip and the love of his life, the grown-up Estella. Which leads to the next point:
2. As a result of the lack of scenes with Pip and Estella, we hear secondhand that she's unhappy, and we only hear Pip say that he's in love. The editing/screenplay is so choppy that we never hear why or how. I guess we are to assume from 10 minutes of the movie that Pip loves her madly because she is pretty and treats him very cooly.
I mean, honestly, we get what's got to be a total of 30 minutes of boring scenery in the movie, and then almost none of the adult Pip falling in love with Estella, or what happens to Estella after marriage?
3. Discontinuity. I don't understand why Estella is so heartless and cruel as a child, then comes back as a soft mannered, kindly seeming lady. Is this a gentleman-trap of some sort?
I give this 2 stars because the acting was very good, but the storyline is super choppy, cryptic, and unbalanced.  It would have been better if more time had been spent on explaining the plot instead of long panoramas of the scenery.",1087344000,11,1901,4.510144927536232
3496,5,0764006401,"It's an unique adaptation of Charles Dickens' ""Great Expectations"", but still, it's not as good as John Mills' ""Great Expectations"" (1947).
In John Mills' ""Great Expectations"" the events are well-focused, and Miss Havisham is meaner and crueler than in this movie. So it's better to see John Mills' ""Great Expectations"", or to read the book before seeing this movie.
Two things I did not like in this movie, the ""WIDE"" logo which appear on the screen every 15 minutes, and the narrator who appears on the beginning of the movie. We want to have fun not a lecture.
Ioan Gruffudd (Horatio Hornblower) performance is excellent as always, he proved that he always conquer, in love and war.",1061769600,14,685,4.863247863247863
3497,4,0764006401,"First let me say that I adore Ioan Gruffud and Justine Waddell, and their work, in this and in other films. And therein lies my (mild) dissatisfaction with this movie: there really are not a lot of scenes with the two together, focussing on their thwarted love. In particular, there is not a lot of development of Estella, so that her actions seem a bit difficult to understand. Why is she marrying that thug of a suitor? Is it an act of will on her part, and is she really so desparate to get any from Miss. Havisham? And if so, why not marry Pip, or anyone else for that matter? Pip confronts Miss. Havisham with the stated fact that Estella is suffering badly; however, we don't SEE this. A cardinal sin in moviemaking is to TELL instead of SHOW. And there are disappointingly few scenes, as I said, developing the love story, which tends to distance the viewer from Pip's pain. In particular, there is a dearth of scenes with Justine Waddell in them, which is quite hard to take, if you are a fan of hers, like myself. I was a little appeased that Ioan Gruffud was in practically every scene, hence my decision to give it four stars. Bernard Hill also was impressively protean as the initially threatening, but ultimately paternal Maggwitch. Charlotte Rampling was her usual luminous self, creating a peculiarly attractive Miss. Havisham. One wonders how her fiance could ever have abandoned her. To conclude, I was a little disappointed, but the film was worth the time and money I spent. I would highly recommend that Waddell fans search out her other work. She has been much better used in other vehicles, such as Tess of the D'urbervilles and Wives and Daughters (both are Mobile Masterpiece Theater productions, I believe). She also starred in a movise made in the U.K., ""The One and Only"", unfortunately not available in the U.S. yet.",1047340800,4,1844,4.659509202453988
3498,3,0764006401,"This is a Master Theatre Version made in 1999, of Dickens' oft-filmed book which comes with stunningly beautiful photography and most strange decision about adapting the original book.  As if to resist the Americanized version starring Ethan Hawke made the year before, this film version, as far as I know, is the least romantic one ever made.  Whether or not you like the film solely depends on this aspect, so let me tell you about it first.
The story is comparatively faithfiul, spending about 3 hours to cover the story of Pip, an apprentice of blacksmith who unwisely perhaps, falls in love with cold-hearted Estella.  But the film, as I said, gives more stress on darker side of the book, so the love theme is not explored as deep as other versions such as David Lean's or Alfonso Cuaron's.  Rather, the newer version seems to give more emphasis on the Pip's guilty feelings deep rooted in his contact with the runaway convict Magwitch, and the film's way of shooting the famous opening of the book, which relates their encounter on the graveyard in the marshes, gives us no time for savoring Dickensian humor.  The film uses the technique of flash-back, in order to express Pip's fear, which, I am afraid, is overdone for its own sake.
I do not follow every details of the story (you probably have read the book), but I have to say this; like I said, this film is endowed with least amount of humor and romance.  Sure, you see Wemmick's most casual wedding; you see Biddy, Joe, Herbert (not all Pockets however), but you cannot expect to find any humorous scnes, one of Dickens' trademarks.  So, when Pip recounts how he met Miss Havisham before his sister and Pumblechook, he is literally forced to talk.  As you know, this is one of the humourous scenes of the original -- even though the humor is downplayed -- where we can see Pip makes up his own story, which gets more and more outrageous as he goes on.  But the director here didn't seem to see that way, depicting the whole incident as simply terrifying one for Pip, who must receive as much scolding and harsh words from them, as if in a tortune.
Justine Waddle, often cast in costume dramas, is good as grown-up Estella, but before she could show something, the film goes on to follow the story of Pip, who must face bravely several darker moments of life (you know what I mean -- Orlick and Themes River), thus making least use of romance between Pip and her.  Actually, the film shows more of mud (of London and Pip's village) and decay, so the first thing Pip sees in London is the butchered cattles hanging on the hook.  It is true that Dickens' original book tells how Pip, arriveing in London for the first time in his life, wanders around Smithfield, then an open-sir cattle market, but ... do we need to know that?
The portrayal of Gruffudd's grown-up Pip is so-so, but the most disappointed thing about the film is Charlotte Rampling's Miss Havisham.  Not that her acting is bad, but her Havisham simply does not convince me, being too weak in her gestures.  She should be more authentic as this witch-like woman often found in fairy tales, who commands people, not just talks.  If she does not follow the flamboyant acting of Anne Bancroft, that is OK.  I just need more enticing mystery in this enigmatic, willful woman, Havisham.
Overall not bad if you look for bleak atmosphere in Dickens.  But for those who seeks for humor and romance in him, this is not the one to see.",1045526400,7,3452,4.579545454545454
3499,2,0764006401,"I guess I'm the only one disappointed in the Masterpiece Theater adaptation of Great Expectations, but I was.  Ioan Gruffudd is a fine actor, but he is no Pip.  The only aspect of his portrayal I liked was his devotion to Estella.  Even his horror at discovering the identity of his real benefactor was too ""subtle"" and too short-lived.
I was even more disappointed in Charlotte Rampling's Miss Havisham.  She was too young, too soft-spoken, and too kindly -- not at all cold and distant -- and not at all manipulative.  And the scene of her incineration is terribly overdone.
From the beginning ... in which we are told of Pip's visit to the graveyard ... to the end ... which is not at all in keeping with the spirit of Dickens' ambiguous ending ... this was a true disappointment.
The Anthony Calf, Anthony Hopkins production for the Disney Channel is far superior.  I wish that one were offered for sale.",1027987200,10,908,4.608695652173913

3501,4,0764006401,"Great Expectations is easily my favorite of the Dickens classics.  With that being said, normally when you translate a book into a movie, something is lost in the shuffle.  Mobile Masterpiece Theater has done a marvelous job, though capturing the heart of the tale.
Iaon Gruffuddd, of A&E's spectacular Horatio Hornblower series, does a good job as an adult Pip, however in his days working as Joe's apprentice I did not really feel that he adequately conveyed Pip's disatisfaction at being there very well or appearing embarrassed once he does come into his fortune and Joe visits.
Joe, on the other hand, is portrayed perfectly, as is Pip's aunt Miss Havisham and Estella.  The plot is followed accurately, though at a breakneck speed, which causes the story to feel a bit rushed.  All in all, though, it is a fairly good interpretation that anyone who enjoys the story would do well to pick up.",1027123200,9,897,4.805194805194805
3502,3,0764006401,"We just got done watching this movie in my literature class because we read the book. I must say that when I started the book I didn`t have a very open mind; the very beginning of the story seems a little trivial and is certainly not the most exciting point of the story. When I`d been through about six chapters I wasn`t enjoying it, though I`d read worse. But we watched the first forty minutes of this movie and I was fascinated by the eerie, dark mood it portrayed. Watching this version definitely helped me to enjoy the book from then on. Dickens really did do an excellent job of setting the mood and the dark atmospere in ""Great Expectations"", and whoever made this movie knew the right way to show the same mood on film. I think the creators of this movie also knew the book genuinely inside and out, which is what I infer from the phenomenal choice of cast members. The actors chosen to play both the young and older Pip, Abel Magwitch, Miss Havisham, Jaggers, and Wemmick were all simply perfect for the roles. In fact, all the actors were extremely fitting, except the one actress who played Estella - she wasn`t neccesarily the way I`d imagined the grown-up Estella to be like, at least, but she did carry out the part well enough. There is some dialogue and a few scenes at the end that stray a little far from the book, but the ending was the one thing I wasn`t neccesarily satisfied with in the book anyway.
