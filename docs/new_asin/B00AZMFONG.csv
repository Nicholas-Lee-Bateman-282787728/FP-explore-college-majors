5533091,4,B00AZMFONG,"""I can't do what I said I would do."" Val (Pacino) has just been released from prison and his friend Doc (Walken) is there to pick him up. He want's to give Val everything he wants on his first day of freedom. Doc's problem is that he has until 10 a.m. to kill his friend or wind up dead himself. I was really looking forward to seeing this one. As you know I am a huge Pacino fan and am a little biased, but I really enjoyed this. It was both funny and a little moving at times. Pacino, Walken and Arkin are a great team and I would love to see them in a movie together again. There are some absolute hilarious parts to this mixed in with some great action scenes. There really is something in this for everyone and even those who are a little older will like this. Kind of like a Space Cowboys for criminals. Even though you can guess how the movie will end about a half hour in it still keeps you watching and is enjoyable the whole way through. Overall, a hugely entertaining movie that I highly recommend, funny and full of action and drama. Cast is great. I give it an A-.",1366416000,,1077,4.109004739336493
5533092,4,B00AZMFONG,"With Stand-up Guys we are given three great actors in three great performances. The fact that they are not necessarily great roles is really beside the point. The stars have enough personality and we enough affection for them to overcome most obstacles, let alone such a minor one.

Stand-up Guys is a movie that depends on so much on it's performers more than anything else, really. Directed by actor Fisher Stevens, it's easy enough to assume that he loves actors, but that he knows when to stay out of the way of these actors is a testament to his craft.

Stand-up Guys could be easily dismissed as a ""grump old gangsters"". However, that would be missing the point and the amusement to be found here. A funny movie, but not absurdly so, it's not a laugh riot. But it doesn't need to be, it's charming and humorous enough.

Working from a rather leaden script by Noah Halde. None of this matters because the talented cast knows how to rise above the material and thus carry the movie further than the material.

Unlike a lot of recent similar themed movies, Stand-up Guys does not feature aging actors acting as though time has stood still. In fact, much of Stand-up Guys depends upon their ages. It's able to be a mediation on death, friendship, loyalty and the inevitable passage of time. It's rather poignant in it's own way.

Watching these actors I realized just how important to me hey re, I've been watching them o decades. Now, Stand-up Guys makes us realize that we are watching them enter into their twilight, soon they will fade from our screens, but not our hearts. A movie like Stand-up Guys  is really more about us the audience re living something.

Pacino plays Val, who as the movie starts is just realized from prison. He served 28 years for the accidental killing of a mobster's son during a heist, h didn`t rat out his accomplices because he's a stand-up guy . There to meet him is one of his old cronies, Doc (Walken), who is possible his only friend.

Val wants to ""party"", Doc says he's retired, not just from being a thief from everything else. Of course, this doesn't stop from breaking into just about every place he goes, but it's mostly places like a pharmacy ""my co-pay on this one is insane"".

Val knows the gangster who's son he killed will have him killed. He knows that Doc has been ordered to it. But this isn't about him trying to out wit or out gun his old friend. He just wants to have one last good time. He knows if he doesn't do it, someone else will anyway.

So the two head into the night in a serious of unlikely events, but they are fun to watch none the less. They  spring their other buddy, they're former getaway driver, Hirsch (Arkin). Not from prison, but from the nursing home that he lives in. They need a driver to go into the night.

This leads to a lot of cute and funny situations. Like an improbable car chase on the freeway with the police. I am so burnt out on car chases, but this one is different. It's not about the getaway or the chase, but who's driving.

Stand-up Guys doesn't depend so much on it's story as it does on it's personalities. And there is personality to spare. This is Pacino and Walken's movie, both at the top of their form, the best I've seen them in years. Arkin adds support in a smaller role, but it is amazing how he lights up the screen, and has been doing so wonderfully lately in a serious of excellent films.

I also like that Stand-up Guys comes to it's logical conclusion, in an ending that is perfectly handled and fitting. So many fine movies are ruined by a third act that is forced or contrived. The dreaded third act problem, as I like to call it. But not here, the ending is most correct.

You will notice that I am giving Stand-up Guys four stars, despite some rather immense flaws. But the truth is that while I watched Stand-up Guys, I was never aware of them. The actors held my attention, I was so captivate by their mesmerizing work as to be lost to everything else.

The story may be obvious. The movie is predictable. But never once did I find myself actually thinking about it. I was to busy watching the people on screen, the actors make them flesh and blood.

The late George C. Scott said at  to judge a performance that he looks for the joy in it. If an actors is able to enjoy himself and convey it to a paying audience, he has done a good job. There is a lot of joy, it's easy to see. And we get into enjoy these stars once more before they slip into the night.

5533093,5,B00AZMFONG,"Three  criminals reunite to recapture the glory of their lawless youth, but find their celebrations interrupted when one is put into a difficult position by a vengeful mob boss. Nearly 20 years after refusing to inform on his partner-in-crime, Val (Al Pacino) emerges from prison a free man. Waiting for him at the gate is his old friend Doc (Christopher Walken), who quickly takes him out on the town with the mischievous Hirsh (Alan Arkin) to stir up some trouble.  Good movie well acted.  I enjoyed watching the forever young Al Pacino.",1359936000,32,539,4.836956521739131
5533094,4,B00AZMFONG,"""Stand Up Guys"" (2013 release; 94 min.) starts with Val (played by Al Pacino) being released from jail after a 28 year stint. He's awaited by his best friend Doc (played by Christopher Walken). We later find out that Val was in jail for the killing of the son of tough guy Claphands, and that Claphands has hired Doc to take out Val by 10 am the next morning. The movie plays out entirely in the 24 hrs. between Val's release from jail and the next morning. During that time we see the two old buddies ""liven it up"", leading to sometime funny (if at times predictable, as in: Viagra overdose consequences, etc.), and sometimes sentimential moments about the ""bad old days"" (when they get ready to take on some baddies, they look at each other and start humming: ""It's time to kick ass or time to chew gum! but I've run out of gum"", ha!).

Several comments: the only plot line that matters in the entire movie is whether at the end Doc takes out Val (I'm not going to tell you how it ends, you'll have to see for yourself how it all plays out). Far more important and enjoyable are the acting performances. Let's start with Al Pacino, who seems like he's having the time of his life and is feisty and fiery throughout. Christopher Walken brings a more restrained, but equally effective, performance. But the person who steals the movie is, once again, Alan Arkin in a fairly small role (he gets rescued/abducted from a seniors home by Val and Doc). Arkin seems to be everywhere these days (he's likely to win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role in Argo).

Bottom line: this movie was okay, but could've been even better with a better script and tighter direction. The theatre where I saw this at here in Cincinnati tonight (1st day of release) was very poorly attended, leading me to believe that it's doubtful this movie will find a large audience. So if you are interested in this movie, better hurry before it's gone (or simply wait for the DVD release later this year).",1359676800,69,1985,4.49584487534626
5533095,4,B00AZMFONG,"I was lucky to attend a screening of ,Stand Up Guys', a thriller-comedy with Al Pacino and Christopher Walken. The movie is hilarious with lots of funny scenes and dialogues. Especially Al Pacino shows method acting at its best. He doesn't play - he is the low rank veteran mobster Val, who - fresh out of prison - wants to make the best of his last hours on earth. Val's only friend Doc is the exact opposite. He looks like a living dead while he is following Val through the night. Doc has a job to do and his job is to kill Val until the next morning. He doesn't have a choice. The mafia don, who wants to see Val dead, has threatened to kill Doc's niece, if Doc spares his friend's life. The world seems to press on Doc's shoulders. Val, on the other hand, knows for whom the bell tolls, but he's a ,Stand Up Guy' and so is his friend.

Director Fisher Stephens arranged extremely funny and dramatic scenes in a quick succession, but his best decision was to step back and let these guys play. Fantastic - don't miss this gem!",1359676800,46,1030,4.255102040816326
5533156,5,B00AZMFONG,Al Pacino and Christoper Walken as well as Alan Arkin were awesome.  Old School type of film not the new drama that the young people think is great.  Real gut action and honest talent.  Seasoned actors that achieved perfection in their acting careers. Bravo.  I would definitely suggest this movie for anyone who wants to see real actors at their best.,1529020800,,352,4.721311475409836

5533159,4,B00AZMFONG,"Stand Up Guys is a surprisingly good film, with great acting all around, but it does take some time to get into it.  For me I find that when left to his own devices Al Pacino does nothing but go too far over the top, which he does, in my humble opinion, near the beginning of the film.  By the time Alan Arkin joins Pacino and Walken as a trio, Al's character becomes more subtle and thus tolerable (and not chewing scenery) and remains that way for the rest of the film.

For some laughs, good drama, action, and a heartwarming story to boot...I recommend this movie.",1528502400,2,568,4.289719626168225

5533172,3,B00AZMFONG,"I give it a very generous three stars out of respect for the caliber of actors in this film. The plot isn't very intricate nor does it try to be. It's just a film about a newly released mobster who reunites with his ""retired"" best friend to enjoy what may be his last day alive. The film is a weird mix of comedy and drama (weird because it doesn't quite flow like alot of other dramadies where each moment, comedy or drama has its own time to reflect on itself). Even the better comedic moments in this film don't seem to take full advantage of its potential because there's always a sense of impeding drama. And likewise with the dramatic moments, they also have a sense of humor to them.

You could describe this movie as ""Space Cowboys"" with guns, but it's far more than that.  It's actually a love story, the bond between lifelong friends that usually goes unspoken, except in times of utter desperation.  The fact that they're all criminals is just what they do for a living, beyond the bounds ""normal"" people.  The ties that bind go far beyond mere surface morals and definitions of ""good"" and ""bad,"" but to the very core of human emotions and existence.

And waiting, and waiting. What I got was a ludicrous Viagra-caused priapism joke. Two major plot points were visible miles away. A major disappointment at worst, mediocre at best. Walken was totally wasted in this with a character with the least amount of dialogue among the three major stars. And instead of should have been an action-filled climax is rendered cheaply off camera. This whole film reeks of production done on the cheap with characters you never warm up to.

Like many films by ageing actors, put together to entertain with no intention of enhancing any art form, you get the artistic level of performance obtained by the actor doing his usual thing without any intention of adding to their old performances. In this case you have 3 good actors who have difficulty making a bad movie, though Arkin was a bit below his usual standard.

If you like character dramas with a little humor thrown in it's a neat ride. Christopher Walken and Al Pacino play off each other perfectly. Alan Arkin is a nice though maybe too small an addition.

It was fun to watch Al Pacino and Christopher Walken flow through the plot like two guys being handed a old pair of shoes that felt good to them. The plot was mediocre but the actors brought some life to the story.  Both actors clearly had a great time at the end.  It was supposed to be a comedy, but it was not the one where you would fall on the floor laughing. It was one where there were chuckles and then fun just watching two masters work out a poor script.

The portrayal of an ex-con (Al Pacino) who did time, without dropping a dime on the other conspirators, because he was/is a stand up guy!  Christopher Walken depicts one of the ""gang"" that needs to do something he really doesn't want to do and shows a clever side...enough said, I don't want to spoil it for others who enjoys these actors, along with Alan Arkin and the others (too many to name).

They meet up with a third friend. They drive, eat, and talk. There's a brief gunfight, and the credits roll. There's a bit more, but not much. The movie is carried by the strength and history of the actors, and with other people, it would be almost unwatchable. I love these guys, but not for this.",1455580800,,474,4.21978021978022

5536436,5,B00AZMFONG,"I never heard of this movie! As a fan of all 3 actors I'm glad I found this gem. The movie is made so real life and raw with the great writing and
directing and of course the acting! Pacino and Walken and Arkin don't even try and act cool and younger and do some of their best acting in
years! The chemistry they have on screen should have been done years ago. I find this movie much better than the bigger movie Righteous
Kill with De Niro. It's rare from Hollyweird these days! The last great classic made was Appaloosa a few years ago which they should make
another one! If you haven't seen that movie get it now. This movie is great for anyone who are fans of these actors and real life movie making.
I wish I had seen in the theater but it's always great to discover some classic or new movie these days I've never seen and add to collection.",1451260800,,847,4.13939393939394

5536438,4,B00AZMFONG,"This is one of those small budget movies with big name stars that will definitely want make you want to stay put (at home) for a night glued to the big screen.  Al Pacino, Christopher Walken and Alan Alda  play three gangsters -- way past their prime.  One is fresh out of prison after spending 28 years there, another one is enjoying his humble retirement in not so appealing apartment and the third one is spending his last days in the retirement home sucking on oxygen.  These are wise guys with class.  They are old school.  But as their past is catching up with them, they have one night to make up for the years of loneliness and regret - before they can bail out with a bang, literally.

It is smart movie with actors who pull it off with their personalities and wit.  Not too heavy of a movie and just a simple pleasure watching these three extraordinary actors at work.",1450828800,,878,4.3765432098765435

5536913,5,B00AZMFONG,"If you like any of or all of the three main characters, then that is reason enough to watch this movie. I happen to like all three of these  oft brilliant actors. While not particularly brilliant, in my opinion, in this movie, they deliver a quirky tale of comic redemption of three aging gangsters. Now, I use the definition of the word comic which some dictionaries idiotically, authoritarianly and incorrectly claim is obsolete. That definition is the definition of comedy: a theatrical or literary piece portraying the life of the common man. In contrast, tragedy is a theatrical or literary  piece depicting the life and fate of the great and powerful. Comedy, therefore, contains funny or light hearted as well as dramatic moments. Tragedy, on the other hand, depicts only dramatic events, events which shape and ruin the lives of the great and powerful. So, this piece was a comedy. Common men who are gangsters, aging gangsters who comedically or comically go out with a bang. Thus, all three do this very well and the movie is worth watching if for no other reason than to see three great aging actors who are still making immensely watchable movies.",1429315200,7,1159,4.848484848484849

Breakdown: Assuming the movie would have been 5 stars - the final scene brings it down to 3, but the all-star cast bumps it back up to 4. It's a good watch if you like Pacino and Walken. Don't expect a novel tale.",1428019200,,535,4.245098039215686

5537079,5,B00AZMFONG,"An overlooked guy film with two experienced actors who are comfortable with themselves and with each other. It is a story designed for those of us who have followed these graduates of the Lee Strasburg school of method acting and love good writing, excellent acting and films which have no need for CG and violence to move a story along. I bought a copy  and sent them to a friend who I consider my brother and have known him since 1966. He and I can pick up the phone after having not spoken for six months and it seems liked we just talked last weekend. That is what this film is all about.",1424908800,,592,4.238938053097345

5537087,4,B00AZMFONG,"The story is a very good one and all three of the main actors Walken, Pacino, and Arkin do a great job in their acting.  All three are hard in their life and yet have a soft and vulnerable side that is makes you root for each of them.  The language is pretty intense (maybe unnecessarily) and some of the themes are definitely adult only, but despite those things the story of friendship, loyalty, family, and devotion make the story one that, like a good book, I didn't want to put down and didn't want to end.",1424390400,,511,4.257731958762887

I would have given this five stars but I wasn't too crazy about the ending.  I don't mind the heroes going out in a blaze of glory like Butch & Sundance, but since the villian was such an A**hole, I would like to have seen him take one in the forehead.

It has a few amusing moments and a half-way decent chase scene, but the rest of the movie is really quite boring and a lot of it feels forced.

5537388,4,B00AZMFONG,"Stand Up Guys is yet another example of a contemporary film sabotaged by its own marketing. The ads presented it as an action-comedy, when in fact it's a much more melancholy and pensive story about ageing, loyalty, and family. It's beautifully lit and shot by Michael Grady, and Fisher Stevens' direction interweaves comedic and dramatic pacing to good effect. And while the film has its flaws, the performances by Pacino and Walken, who are playing characters rather than caricatures, are worth your time. In some ways, Stand Up Guys reminds me of Scorcese's After Hours and Landis' Into the Night, and not only because it takes place over the course of 24 hours, but because of its quirky, original characters and its genre blending.",1409270400,,736,4.943548387096774

Alan Arkin is a master of subtlety, and Christopher Walken never fails to crack me up even in films where he not supposed to be funny.

5537519,4,B00AZMFONG,"What is it that makes ""Standup Guys"" work as a comedy? You might have noticed in the movie allusions to other movies -- ""Scent of a Woman"" was one I caught, and the aging Randolph Scott and Joel McCrea in ""Ride the High Country"" seemed to be alluded to at the end. There's even, I think, a perverse allusion to ""The Untouchables."" I'm sure people who have seen more movies than I have caught more. You'll remember the Shakespeare plots that are premised on an outrageous demand? -- ""Marry the man I want you to marry or you'll have to be put to death"" (""Midsummer Night's Dream""), for example. Here Doc (Christopher Walken) has been ordered by his former boss, Claphands (Mark Margolis, looking like Ron Paul!), to kill his old friend Val (Pacino) when he (Val) finishes up his 28 year prison sentence. Claphands believes Val to have been responsible for the death of his son during a shoot-out with police, and while it seems unlikely that Val really killed the young man, he took the fall and didn't rat out the others. In other words, he's a standup guy, and yet Claphands -- 28 years on, for heaven's sake -- wants him dead and wants his best friend to kill him. Premises don't get much more outrageous than that. The action of the movie takes place in the day, approximately, between Val's release and the time of Claphands's deadline. Val learns about his predicament early in the movie and accepts that Doc will have to kill him.

What clues us to the fact that we're not in the world of ""realism,"" however, is the fact that neither Doc nor Val spend the rest of the movie trying to solve the problem. There is no ""plot"" -- the sequence of events is just a piece of machinery that enables the main characters to get together and do a lot of talking. They spend a lot of time in a diner in which Doc's grand-daughter is a waitress who doesn't know that the old regular that she serves frequently is her grandfather. There are visits to a brothel that doesn't look like any brothel of the present day, the madam of which is young woman who looks like a stereotypical movie secretary and where Eastern-European prostitutes seem happy in their work. Val and Doc ""rescue"" their old buddy Hirsch (Alan Arkin) from an assisted-living facility. When they walk in, he's hooked up to an oxygen tank, and when he sees them, he just unhooks it, walks out, and takes them for a joyride in a stolen car that belongs to a couple of gangsters. Inside the trunk, after a bit of joyriding, they find a naked girl named Sylvia (Vanessa Ferlito), whom they free, feed, and then give a hilarious opportunity to get back at the gangsters who kidnapped her. Then they find Hirsch dead at the wheel. Then they bury him, with the help of his daughter Nina (Julianna Margulies), a nurse who had earlier helped Val when he had had to be hospitalized following a Viagra overdose. Then they steal some suits. Then they go to church, and Val tips the priest for trying to hear his confession . . . I think you might realize that we're in something like Coen Brothers or Bill Forsythe country. Of course, we realize that Claphands can't be avoided . . . but we notice too that nothing that Val and Doc actually DO seems to directed at solving the Claphands problem, even though they frequently discuss their predicament.

So what's the point? It is, I think, all about performance. It's clear fairly early that ""standup guy"" is a double-entendre. The comedy of Val's ""performance"", or lack thereof, in the brothel sets the tone, and on a later visit to the brothel with Hirsch, we see another kind of performance -- one of the most charming moments in the movie, in which we realize, if we think about it, that it's all about acting. And so is the movie -- the inconsequential actions that make up the ""plot"" exist solely to show us that two old actors can hold our attention in these moments. Whatever tone a scene requires, they're up for it, and they can seemingly shift at will. The dialogue is fresh: my favorite line might be ""Who made you the arbiter of who has to give away their pants?"" That could be right out of a Bill Forsythe movie. And Pacino and Walken (and Arkin when he's with them) are magical. The lighting does nothing to hide (in fact accentuates) the ravages of age, but whatever kind of performances might deteriorate with age, acting performances aren't necessarily among them. Although Walken goes through most of the movie looking like death warmed over, the movie is in fact a cheerful tribute to old movies, old actors, and absurd plots that we can be charmed in spite of. As for the ending, you can make of it (as Shakespeare might say) ""what you will.""",1404864000,,4658,4.517772511848341

5537570,5,B00AZMFONG,"Before ""discovering"" Stand Up Guys my most positive recollections of Fisher Stevens are of his inspired and genuinely comical character Ben Jabituya in the two ""Short Circuit"" movies.  He was the standout cast member in both the 1986 original film and the 1988 sequel.  Since then, I've only seen him in very brief, somewhat uninspired film appearances.  But, based upon his direction of Stand Up Guys, Mr. Stevens is worthy of very high accolades.  Ben Jabitua may have faded away, but Fisher Stevens, re-emerging as a film director, is orders of magnitude brighter than many who aspire to direct motion pictures.  The plot of Stand Up Guys deals with three likeable career criminals, ostensibly retired, re-connecting late in life.  The story is both touching and funny, reminiscent of the Disney classics of old, but never as over-the-top as the Disney classics tended to become at times.",1400716800,2,891,5.068493150684931

5537605,4,B00AZMFONG,"Stand up guys(released Oct/12)stars,among others, Al Pacino,Christopher Walken,Alan Arkin and Julianna Margulies. This film is a nice jaunt and pleasant journey with some old pros,making it all look effortless. I never thought I'd be calling the three main stars ""old"",but "" time waits for no man"",as Pacino says.
The story finds Pacino getting out of prison for a 28 year stretch he did for the accidental killing of his bosses son during a heist. The boss,Clap hands,doesn't quite remember it as an accident and has been waiting all those years for revenge on Pacino. Walken is there to greet his old pal who we find out,after they get back to Walken's place,is the one Clap hands has designated as the one to ice Pacino.
But Pacino wants to par-tay. Walken takes him to a local brothel the two frequented many years before. In fact the daughter of the original owner now runs it. Oops,but Pacino can't get the pipes working. Off the two go to the local drugstore to get some Viagra,and other sundries Walken needs. Pacino takes a slew  of the pills and not only gets things straight at the brothel but cannot ""relax"".They end up at a club and then back in the car where Pacino passes out. Walken tries but cannot bring himself to shoot his old buddy,He wakes him up and they go to the hospital to emerge where the daughter of an old friend, Hirsch,is tending to Pacino's problem. With that fixed they attend a restaurant Walken has frequented for years. They are served by a friendly waitress who Walken has obviously knows quite well. It is then Walken is forced to fess up that it is indeed HE that is the one that is supposed to kill Pacino;by 10AM that morning.
After their meal they steal a souped up car from some local scum bag hoodlums,""animals"" as Walken calls them,and they look up their old pal Hirsch(Arkin),who used to be their getaway driver. Hirsch is now on oxygen but is very glad to see his old pals. The two talk Hirsch into driving their newly acquired car for them. While out they get set on by the police. After a brief chase Hirsch easily loses them. Next they head to the brothel,where Hirsch wants to have a three some. With the deed done the three head back onto the road. Not soon after they hear a banging from the trunk. It turns out to be a naked girl. They take her to the diner and get her something to eat. She explains that she was kidnapped by this gang and raped at a warehouse, then put in the trunk. Pacino and Walken say there must be consequences for such despicable behaviour,so they drive back and find the place where it happened. The girl is determined to come in with them but they finally persuade her to stay out for about ten minutes until things are under control. The two storm in and subdue all five guys,most tied up, with one on the floor. The girl comes in with a baseball bat and Pacino and Walken leave her to do her thing.
Back at the car the two find their old friend dead at the wheel. They go back to the hospital and tell his daughter what has happened. She agrees to Pacino's request to bury him that night. After a brief ceremony the two return to the diner. There Pacino guesses that the waitress Walken is so fond of is his granddaughter. While Walken makes a call to Clap hands for some clemency,his granddaughter sits down to talk to Pacino about her friend. Needless to say Clap hands isn't in a forgiving mood and holds Walken to his job. Walken writes a note to his granddaughter and pins the note,along with his apartment keys,to the bulletin board next to the phone and both men leave.
Next the two stop off at a church where Pacino goes to confession. Their next stop is a clothing store,where they both pick up some new suits. Part way through two of Clap hands thugs enter and Walken and Pacino  subdue them both,leaving one wounded in the hand and the other to send back to their boss. Meanwhile the waitress is now in Walken's apartment and the phone rings. She picks it up and Walken tells her that he loves her,and to get a shoe box in his closet. It is filled with cash. Walken tells her the unit is now hers and that some very beautiful paintings of sunrises he had done over the years were all inspired by her. Asked  if she will see him soon,he replies he doesn't know and hangs up.
The two now head down to Clap hands warehouse where they start a fire fight with two thugs outside then train their fire on Clap hands upstairs. As the gun fight continues the camera pans upward and over the building to a beautiful sunset,which then solidifies into one of Walken's paintings.
The major element that binds this film together is the chemistry between the two main leads,and Walken and Pacino have it from start to finish. Walken is continually torn between the respect he has for his old partner and the terrible job that Clap hands is forcing him to do. You can see it in his face at all times. And Pacino knows that his time is limited and tries to enjoy what little time he has,knowing all along it is his buddy that has to do the job. At one point he even breaks down thinking about it, in a vulnerable moment. Every other actor that comes on and off screen are strong and match the vibes of of both men,from Hirsch,Hirsch's daughter,Walkens granddaughter,the thugs,etc. The film takes place over about a 20 hour arc,counting the time from which Pacino walks out of jail. It is a well paced but steady progression as we wonder what the ending will be to all of the circumstances before us. The ending will come as kind of a cheat to some,but in retrospect it is fitting and smart,leaving it to our imaginations.
Technically speaking the film is in its original a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp .Extras include deleted scenes,interviews with the cast,a look at the stunt driving,behind the scenes,two featurettes and a look at some of Bon Jovi's music.
All in all a delightful film with two pros doing what comes naturally. There is great chemistry all around and the film fits like an old sweater. Recommended. 4-4 1/2 stars.",1398556800,,6017,4.478142076502732

I purchased it based on the actors and the thought that with the 3 of them- Pacino,Walken& Arkin it was bound to be a goodie,well It is awful- I am yet to get thru the entire movie and believe me, I have tried- Many times! All I can say is,Pacino is ridiculous in the role he plays,which is made to over shadow the other 2 actors,when by far Walken is the better actor in the role he plays, Arkin just gets lost- because the main character and the bad acting by Pacino ruins it all. I learned a lesson in buying this movie without really knowing what it was about and just going on the  presumtion that Pacino is good in anything,and that it would be even better with the other 2 actors I like, Not true! actually was so bad I realized Pacino has lost his luster and really isn't nice to watch on screen anymore,and clearly doesn't pick roles with much challenge other than to try to out shine the other characters.",1397088000,,944,4.273743016759776

USUAL.  oddball.  self., Pacino and Arkin seemed less than present, almost as if their killer spirit was a tad bit lost. Julianne Marguiles' character was somewhat softer than the roles she usually plays.

The story line (three retired hit man type guys who are looking for one last hoorah) was interesting enough and is definitely worth adding to your watch list for some got-nothing-better-to-do Saturday night when you want to see a movie that won't induce a complete coma of boredom, but it's certainly no blockbuster hit, which is probably why I never heard of it until I was browsing my Amazon Prime app.",1397088000,,757,4.929133858267717

Not people you'd want to do business with but they'd give you their last penny if you needed it.  The movie pulls no punches. It's good.to the last drop.  You're left feeling good that these guys, friends, care about each other, despite their lives, their pasts and what one is currently being forced to do to the other. And that's what you're kept wondering as these two put that aside and have their reunion as if this fact is nothing at all.  It almost becomes incidental oddly enough.

5537657,2,B00AZMFONG,"When I see a new movie with the likes of a Pacino, Walken, or De Niro, I get the same feeling as when I watch a once-great athlete who is now in the twilight of his career. Sure, there are moments of greatness that remind you why you're watching a legend. However, those precious moments are inevitably weighed down by an overwhelming sense of fatigue.

So, it's perhaps befitting the characters in this movie are also in the final acts of their lives. Nevertheless, the fire and passion, to me anyway, is simply not there.

I'd recommend this movie if:

1) You're a dyed in the wool Pacino, Walken, or Arkin fan and you've seen all their earlier works (Serpico, Deer Hunter, etc.)

or

2) If you have a soft spot for the aging underdogs who show the world that old-school honor, that rare ability to steadfastly remain a stand-up guy, still means something.

Otherwise, be prepared for a trio of icons going through the motions of an unoriginal story.",1396224000,,952,4.570588235294117

5537661,5,B00AZMFONG,"As this heart-warming, tear-jerking, off-the-wall comedy picks up speed, you are drawn into an under-world of corruption, vengeance and remorse. The main characters, the antagonists, are more at war with time and aging than they are with each other. They are always striving for that elusive dream... To be relevant right up to the end.

Have always enjoyed Walken's work, it always seems to me that he is always thinking what he wants to say where it comes out fair and even. Pacino is always a treat as he can really be a loose cannon.

This movie mixes good clean action with humor and touching moments.  Both guys and chicks can dig this flick...if you are over 40.

5537691,1,B00AZMFONG,"I was actually looking forward to this movie because of the cast. A crime comedy with a legendary cast, how could this possibly go wrong? Unfortunately, Stand Up Guys is a disaster.

Al Pacino and Christopher Walken try their best, but they have nothing to work with here. The script is awful and the two characters are lifeless, undeveloped, and have absolutely no chemistry with one another. The writing is surprisingly bad too with more than a handful of awful jokes that become increasingly irritating to listen to. There is a Viagra joke early on in the movie that is not only not funny, but has been ton a million times in other movies. Even worse, they milk the joke dry by forcibly bringing it up constantly within the first 30 minutes of the film. Alan Arkin has a very small role in the film and one of the few scenes he's in was one of the few parts I actually enjoyed in the film. The whole film is pretty much 90 minutes of ""OH LOOK HOW OLD THESE ACTORS ARE HA HA HA"", except none of the jokes are well-written and the film has no build up or pay off. It just keeps going on and on until it leads up to one of the worst most anti-climatic endings I've ever seen. The worst part of it might be though is having to watch these legendary actors go to new lows to the point where it becomes embarrassing to watch them.

To be honest, they really should make movies in which the movie is solely about elderly.  It just makes it uninteresting.  The movie grossed only $3 million...you know this movie took a BIG hit.

Doc and Val were stickup men and now are old men. Val is blamed for mob boss Claphand's son death in a robbery gone wrong and spent 28 years doing time for the crime. He always expected he'd be offed in the pen. Now as his term is complete and he's a free man. His best friend, Doc picks him up...he has 24 hrs. The next 24 hrs are a hilarious and entertaining story!

Most of the show you will laugh yourself off the couch. But be prepared for a few moments of rather repetitively annoying dialog.

5537749,5,B00AZMFONG,"There are plenty of other reviews here that rehash the plot. Read them if you want the spoilers.  Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 38% by the pro reviewers and 48% by the ordinary viewers. So that's the numbers for you. And I would agree that the screenplay is occasionally trite, cliche-ridden, or just written for the guffaw (the hospital scene, or the women's implausible ecstasy over the mnage  trois). And the pacing is slow.
""Is slow..."" until you have given the three, Walken, Pacino, and Arkin, the time they need to ""sell"" you their characters, and you will be right there in the scene. If you want Plato's Republic on the meaning of life, go elsewhere, but these three actors show three different lives, portrayed within a time of 24 hours -- they present how each life was lived, and how they see themselves as having sometimes done right and sometimes having done what they now regret. The same words in another actor would sound like tin, but here you feel the weight and pain of each line. I cannot imagine the director nor the screen writer creating these characterizations, they had to come from the unique imagination of each of these fully-accomplished actors, no where else. It is this creation out of the ensemble which is breath-taking and unique; you can see how they reached beyond the dross that the director and screen writer gave them. Three other actors, even if accomplished, would have come up with a different movie.
Another review points out that these three are crooks, why should we care about lowlifes? Although the guys are criminals, and we never learn the depths of their criminality, Pacino's 'guy' lays out utterly clear, why life is a precious gift to each of us. How many of us forget that in the day-to-day?

5537768,2,B00AZMFONG,The movie had potential however it fell short in several areas. The plot was weak and predictable. The acting and script was horrible. The remarkable cast had seen far better days. We didn't bother to finish the movie. In fact my Wife picked up her IPad and started Facebooking within the first 15 minutes of the movie.,1393459200,,319,4.614035087719298

5537774,2,B00AZMFONG,Basically this was just a dumb movie with a cheezey story line that kept you interested for about ten seconds. The actors were all professionals and this movie was far below their capability. Surprised they would sign on to this embarrassment.,1393372800,,243,4.951219512195122

5537781,2,B00AZMFONG,OMG....What a waste of film. It was nothing more than a payday for two veteran actors for who sadly seem to not care anymore.,1393286400,,125,4.25
5537782,5,B00AZMFONG,Great acting.  Pacino and Walken did an icredible job of playing on each other.  This is actually a sleeper of a movie.  I thought it wasn't going to be good and it was great.,1393286400,,175,4.088235294117647

5537791,3,B00AZMFONG,"I am probably strange in that I am not an Al Pacino fan, but I do like Christopher Walken. Both men did a great job in this movie, and it was interesting to watch Christopher's struggle with what he had to do.

5537794,1,B00AZMFONG,"This was a torture to watch.  We shut it down after about 30 minutes.  You would think with a spectacular cast that it would be spellbinding, but it was a snooze periodically punctuated with gruesome violence.  If you can't hook the audience within the first 15 minutes, it isn't worth the time.

Awkward!  Premise was just plain stupid.  I don't know if this was based on a true story, but if it were these 3 didn't have lives worth living.  I don't know how a producer/director could possibly take three great actors and diminish their talent to the point of nonexistent.  This is truly a destructive use of talent.  Sorry, I don't get it.

This is basically an old guys romp. 40 plus will enjoy it, the story keeps you interested and there's not a lot of work keeping the plot in focus. Supporting cast such as Mark Margolis (Claphands) and Lucy Punch (Wendy) turn in some campy, fun, performances and Addison Timlin as Alex has real appeal, star quality along with good acting chops.

Yet it turns out to be a poignant depiction of aging, the duration of friendships, and loyalty to those we love. This was a much less funny movie than I expected, and a much more feel good movie than I anticipated. This isn't a macho Charles Bronson/ Clint Eastwood flick. This is closer to a sweet date flick you can surprise a special Lady with.

5537904,3,B00AZMFONG,"It is hard to dislike a film that stars Christopher Walken and Al Pacino. In addition to them, Stand Up Guys manages to have Alan Arkin (though his role is comparatively small). This means three Oscar winners in one movie. Filmmakers should be thankful for their luck.

There is not much plot in the film that unfolds like a stage play. In a nutshell, Stand Up Guys is about two aged former criminals: Doc (Walken), now retired, and Val (Pacino), who has just got out of prison after 28 years. But Doc is secretly ordered to kill his friend by his boss. This is going to be Vals last night, but what will Doc do when the time comes?

Acting is first-rate (as you expect) and dialogue is interesting, but we expect something more from these veterans, which director Fisher Stevens fails to deliver. Two main characters are believable thanks to the stars, but I didn't find them as interesting as some reviewers say probably because of some familiar elements (Viagra, dancing, etc.).

But there are some bigger problems about the film: its pace that is slack, and subplots that are weak. The film could have made better use of some episodes such as their old friend Hirch (Alan Arkin) or a naked woman in the truck. After all Stand Up Guys shows what these charismatic actors like Christopher Walken and Al Pacino can do, but most of us know that even before watching the film.",1391990400,,1375,4.58130081300813

I had just watched the recent buddy film, Last Vegas with DiNiro, Douglas, Freeman,& Kline and wanted to watch 'something' so had a free download and it's Pacino and Walken.  So, why not? Kind of sad, really. Pacino's character was off the chain with his snorting prescription drugs and gobbling Viagra. And burying their friend in the middle of the night, exactly how did that work? Everything about this movie felt dated ,dingy and sadly out of synch. It's an old film and pretty easy to rent so it's not like people will really need to read a review. But yeah? Why waste time when there are so many really good, well written, well-acted stories out there. In short, do yourself a favor and give it a pass.",1391990400,,740,4.522388059701493

5537909,5,B00AZMFONG,Theae two live up to their reputations in this comedic drama. When i read the description i thought it was your run of the mill action/gangster movie but it was anything but. The chemistry of Pacino and Walken and their fluid conversation adds to their funny lines. The supporting roles are uniquely played with the exception of the flat character 'bad guy' but his character developing wouldnt add to the story anyways. It starts out a little slow but once the plot gets moving and the lead characters start flowing it is really enjoyable.,1391904000,,540,4.75531914893617

Christopher Walken plays his best friend who has not done much other than wait for his his friend to get out.  Once out, we discover Walken's mission is to kill his best friend.  This is mostly dark comedy and done very well. There are a couple of surprises but for the most part, you know how it ends from the beginning. But the acting and the dialogue is outstanding. Alan Arkin is brilliant. There's just not enough of him in this movie. This is classic Pacino and classic Walken. It's just a fun movie.",1391817600,,623,4.4

three old friends reuniting later in life, for one final hurrah.  Except they are all criminals.  Oh of
course, there's some supposed justification for their final acts of mayhem.  But it felt somewhat
tired and neither ennobling nor particularly funny.  If you love these actors then you will probably
like the movie.  If on the other hand you only like these actors, you may feel neutral or less about
the film.  There are so many other, probably better choices....",1391558400,,562,4.742268041237113

Awful script.
Pacino phones it in. It's time to shave that scruffy beard, get another hair-cut, and finally break out of the look he's had in all his movies since the 'Heat'.
Walken plays the same role  he's been playing for years - a man who regrets what he'd done years ago, with a little crazy added to the mix.
Alan Arkin as a kick-ass runaway car driver in a threesome with a couple of hookers...really now.
I wonder if these guys really needed the money, or it was some kind of a charity project...there's really no other excuse for this film.",1391212800,,558,4.365384615384615

We are both mid 50's, so our lives have spanned the actors' careers (The Deer Hunter is still my favorite movie of all time), plus we have watched our parents age and pass, along with most of their generation.  The acting is excellent, even if it is overplayed at times.  You can tell these guys had a great time making this movie.  We especially liked the interaction between the generations; for all some people make about Gen X and Gen Y, there is less of a gap now than there was when I was in my 20's.  The story is fairly predictable and the ending typical Hollywood nonsense, but it was a fun watch.  We rented it, but we are going to buy it and watch it over at least once a year.",1391212800,,775,4.133333333333334

No it is not a modern crime or mobster movie, where everything is action packed, killing with digital enhancement. This is a movie like they used to make.  This movie is about friendship, and I thought Pacino and Walkin did use their acting skills and were very entertaining.",1390953600,,407,4.5479452054794525

Strong character development, the right amount of humor, the obligatory car chase, a nice assortment of subplots, and a competently twisted ending.  The casting was wonderful with three grand masters playing the roles they do best (and always seem to play, don't expect any surprises there).  That said, the student of screen writing can pretty much figure out the plot twists fairly quickly and watch the rest of the movie smugly thinking, ""I coulda done that.""  Too bad he didn't, huh? He wouldn't be writing movie reviews for Amazon.",1390953600,,617,4.951456310679611

5538021,4,B00AZMFONG,"I can give you my review in one sentence, then I'll provide some details:

""This one is going to be too subtle for a lot of people.""

It's hard to discuss this one in detail without dishing up spoilers.

But here's one. Alan Arkin has just finished a tryst with a working girl and the owner of a brothel...the ""menage a trois"" he's had on his bucket list for years.

The owner tells him ""You've ruined me for any other man.""

Arkin replies ""It's OK. You'll get over it.""

The movie DOES start a little slow, primarily an interaction between Walken and Pacino, and after they ""rescue"" Arkin from a rest home (in a stolen car), things get NUTS. It is VERY subtle, tongue-in-cheek humor. It gets progressively weirder. But if you're looking for ""Dumb and Dumber"" you WILL get bored.

Listen, this isn't Gone With The Wind or Citizen Kane. It's an extremely eccentric mash-up between three legends. If you're in the mood for rapid-fire story lines and acting, watch something else, and when you're feeling like kicking back and letting the weirdness of this one slowly unfold, do it. It's FUNNY. It's worth your time, as long as you take the caveats above into consideration. I loved it, I'll be watching it a second time (at minimum).",1390780800,,1231,4.593607305936073
5538022,4,B00AZMFONG,"Its probably time for some of the great actors to hang up their hats. This I think should be a swan song.
Entertaining enough.",1390694400,,126,4.291666666666667
5538023,3,B00AZMFONG,"You know those movies that are enjoyable, but they feel like they are building up to the end of the movie? That's how this movie is. It is enjoyable, but there is never that ""awesome"" moment. The awesome moment is cut off at the end of the movie, not leaving you with a feeling of ""hooray, their story is just beginning,"" which I think is really the only reason to end a movie the way they did; no, this movie leaves you at the end of the movie....and they just cut it off! You feel cheated at the end, not entertained or anything else.  It's a shame, too. I really liked the rest of the movie. The characters are interesting and likable, and I even thought the story was well-done up until the end. It was the perfect ""build up to an awesome end"" type of movie...but NOPE, you get half of an ending, one that leaves you scratching your head and wondering, ""What the heck were they thinking when they wrote this?""

TL;DR

A horrible ending invalidates an otherwise great movie. I think it's worth a watch (it's on Prime at the time of me writing this review, so you can maybe watch it), but there is no way I would buy this movie. I won't be watching it again.",1390694400,,1160,4.239819004524887

Although I love each actor's past work, this movie was just a time waster, their acting seemed amatuerish at best, I blame the director and the studio for this piece of crap.

Movies like anchor man 1 & 2 as well as this piece of crap, I file under ""new world order entertainment"" because you have to be a dumbed down & retarded to enjoy them, sadly that's most people out there.",1390521600,,568,4.349056603773585

5538054,5,B00AZMFONG,"I loved this film, I did not expect much action and that was fine by me.  Saw some negative reviews out there, and that seems to be because they were expecting less dialog and more action. This film was really all about the dialog and the beautiful ""brotherly love"" between the main characters. Walken and Pacino had such terrific chemistry, you could truly believe they had been through all the times and events they spoke of. I found humor and joy along with their shared regrets.  Typical human emotions, no matter what sort of life one leads. To me this was just a feel-good film. I have recommended it to all my family and many friends.

I found the ""Viagra"" scene hilarious, touching and vulgar at the same time.  While I could relate to Al's inability to perform, my senior sensibility about what were once ""taboo"" subjects embarassed me none the less. All said,  I enjoyed the film, but I definitely would not watch it with my grand daughter.  The film was perfectly acted, professionally produced and funny in a sad way.

5538093,2,B00AZMFONG,Christopher Walken and Al Pacino are two great actors but I don't even know why they did this movie.  Do they not care about their legacy?  Are they turning into Nicolas Cage?

However, it turned out to be funny and heartwarming, even though it really is about gangsters; there is some shoot-em-up, and revenge is the whole plot of the story. Al Pacino's part had to be written specifically for him, because he is perfect in it. I only gave it four stars because I am not a big Christopher Walken fan, but I did like him in this role.

5538114,3,B00AZMFONG,you see 4 very good actors/actress and think Wow!; so the movie itself was a little disappointing.  ?a different version of grumpy old men?,1390089600,,139,4.791666666666667
5538115,4,B00AZMFONG,Walken and Pacino both give a nice performance.....another movie that I don't remember seeing years ago but as always I see them come out and make a mental note to rent it later,1390089600,,177,4.393939393939394
5538116,5,B00AZMFONG,These guys are still awesome! They are so great on the big screen! I like the dialogue and interact the interaction between the ages..,1390089600,,134,4.625

5538118,3,B00AZMFONG,not bad but not htat funny either! Pachino and Walkin are ok Arkin was much better! liked the movie but did not LOVE it!,1390089600,,120,4.041666666666667

5538120,3,B00AZMFONG,You just expect more when two greats like Walken and Pacino get together. This movie is too slow...slower than Grandma's molasses.,1390089600,,130,5.238095238095238
5538121,4,B00AZMFONG,"Very good. I am never upset with Pacino. He is clearly older and is acting  his age with class  and his usual high talent ""talent"". His supporting cast ?  Oh so good.",1390003200,,166,4.125

5538124,1,B00AZMFONG,"Movie was not interesting.
Has a negative moral value - perhaps motivated by democrat party issues - and glorification of crime.",1390003200,,128,5.142857142857143
5538125,5,B00AZMFONG,Best movie I've seen in a long time stays true to the characters & you don't know what to expect. Great dialogue! Great acting!,1390003200,,127,4.333333333333333
5538126,2,B00AZMFONG,"Not great. A good enough premise but told in a rambling way that lacks all tension or suspense. Walken is great, as always, and Pacino is gratifyingly subdued (he might be over his ""shouting = acting"" phase). The movie has a terrible, unsatisfying ending. So be warned.",1390003200,,269,4.74468085106383
5538127,1,B00AZMFONG,"Maybe if I'd stayed with it I would have seen the point but I was bored out of my mind in the first 15 minutes.  Aging, gin-soaked, brain-damaged ex-thugs trying to get it up with prostitutes.  Not my idea of a fun evening.",1390003200,,223,4.162790697674419

5538129,5,B00AZMFONG,"Sweet, sentimental, ""kick ass"". If you've followed these actors and their careers (and really, what have you done with your life if you haven't), you'll love the nuanced characters. Shades of multiple roles they've played. There's a little piece of a lot of movies here.

Not a blockbuster, not a Saturday afternoon red wine movie either.

You get glimpses, not full flesh because you already know these guys. Massive respect for the ending.",1389916800,,441,5.027397260273973
5538130,4,B00AZMFONG,Its funny bad sad at the same time I love all the actors and seeing them getting older form scarface to this one how old they are just shows how fast time really passes you by but anyways a must see movie way better then grumpy old man,1389916800,,235,3.9166666666666665
5538131,5,B00AZMFONG,"This movie did a fantastic job of showing an aged ""WISE GUY"". It did it without extreme glorification of violence or making these screen legends look and act 20years old. Pacino and Walken STILL got it!!",1389916800,,203,4.666666666666667
5538132,3,B00AZMFONG,Not great ... But I did enjoy the veteran stars working together.  They seemed to be relaxed and enjoy working together. I would recommend it to friends.,1389916800,,153,4.666666666666667

5538134,4,B00AZMFONG,"Good at home movie for adults, on a weekend or just after dinner when you find nothing on TV. I love all the actors and they don't disappoint. Each adds his own humor as well.",1389916800,,175,4.0285714285714285
5538135,3,B00AZMFONG,"Lots of language, but they're old gangsters.  A bit more violence than I care for, but it fits the story.",1389916800,,105,4.25
5538136,5,B00AZMFONG,"Loved this movie, the actors are at the top of their game! The writing is hilarious. It is too bad that overblown movies like American Hustle get so much attention and little gems like this are overlooked.",1389916800,,205,4.5675675675675675
5538137,5,B00AZMFONG,"This is how you end a movie.  The classic ""old guys reuniting for one last _________"" trope has never been done better.",1389830400,,119,4.409090909090909
5538138,3,B00AZMFONG,"I expected more from a movie with this outstanding ensemble of actors. I can only assume that the director was trying to make me feel as old and feeble as these now senior citizen gangsters who once ruled the roost. The overall movie was excruciatingly slow with rare moments of witty dialogue. It's hard to build a compelling story around boner pills, a lack of enthusiasm for criminal activity, a failed fatherhood, and multiple trips to a whorehouse. The merciful thing to do would have been to allow this movie to die in its sleep. Alan Arkin was the standout here with too little screen time.",1389830400,,597,4.6415094339622645
5538139,4,B00AZMFONG,"It was a good movie and I would recommend it if you like these two stars.
It is funny and sad",1389830400,,93,3.4761904761904763
5538140,5,B00AZMFONG,"Take a look at the one and two star reviews. They say things like ""Banal,"" ""pointless,"" ""sentimental."" Check, check and check. Throw in predictable, unbelievable and hokey.  But do yourself a favor anyway and take a look. From opening to closing, if you love Walken being Walken, Pacino doing his own impersonation, and a script that gives you a little bite out of everything you ever loved about their quirkier movies, you will spend a great 90 minutes here.

You could call the film quirky too.  Mostly because of Mr. Pacino's whatchamacallit... I don't know if Amazon will let me use the correct word, so let's just call it Thingy. After an overdose of stolen Viagra, it's almost a co-star.  But salaciousness is just a tiny ingredient in this half-baked but still delicious souffle.  Sure the plot is pointless, serving just as an excuse for our two guys to do some of their favorite shtick, and it goes well beyond blocked vein priapism (in case you wanted to know the medical term).  Walken and Pacino are old time gangsters, from back in the day when being a gangster meant something. Pacino has spent the better part of 30 years in prison. His partner in crime and best friend picks him out outside the walls and they spend a day on the town. Turns out, this is going to be Pacino's last day because his former boss wants him whacked ASAP and it's Walken's job to be the triggerman.

Stand Up Guys doesn't miss a trick. We have the Hooker with the Heart of Gold, the Truly Evil Villian, a granddaughter and grandfather reunion, the Geezers who can outshoot, outfight and out (another word I think Ammy might object to) guys half their age.  We have justice and revenge, tables turning, romance and regret.  We have humor, heartbreak, lots of action, dialogue that's a little familiar but enjoyable all the more for that reason, and a car chase that is the only one I have ever loved.  Throw in some good little cameos by Alan Arkin and Juliette Margulies...who also served as director of the flick, and you just have something endearing if not memorable.  Arkin, by the way, is very good, with some great lines.

Don't be a critic, don't be picky. If you liked Walken in his latter day gangster flicks (or even better, ""$5 a day"" take a chance on Stand Up Guys. By the way, ""All out of gum"" refers to their catchphrase. When pacino says ""It's time to kick butt or chew gum,"" Walken provides the reply. Sometimes he even does a little dance.  That alone is worth a couple of stars.  Enjoy.",1389830400,,2496,4.554809843400448

This movie would be just as good (bad?) with up-and-coming or no name actors. Never really drew me in with the story line, the action scenes were lacking, the plot was under developed (would have loved to have seen the moments where Pacino's fate was decided), and the bad guy, Claphands, (Mark Margolis) could have have a larger presence in the film.

5538159,4,B00AZMFONG,Felt like old school Walken and Pacino. Arkin was great in it too. Dark yes (in a bittersweet way) but it should be. I didn't think it was slow at all. Some great one liners and memorable scenes. Surprised this is free on Amazon Prime.,1389830400,,235,4.2444444444444445

This had a good mix, it was also a little heartwarming. You felt bad for them. But then as Al Pacino does he kicks a$$ so i liked it. Enough action to keep me watching and it had a story.

This one is not too good.  The screen play sucks. There are too many loose threads, to much that the viewer has to 'come along on' to make it work.  The actors are all pro's,  they can be entertaining selling garbage bags, This movie is better than a garbage bag,  its OK.  But one would think that when one gets three top flight actors, and a long list of support people together, somebody could write a screen play worth the effort.

5538190,4,B00AZMFONG,"Stand Up Guys is a fun movie for let's face it, an older audience. I don't expect 20 something kids to enjoy it unless they like good acting. (My kids, not so much. Yours?) Pachino, Walken, and Arkin really are good. I was a bit surprised at the job Alan Arkin did. Pleasantly, by the way. Overall, the movie is worth the two hour investment. It does drag a bit, but not to the point of going to get popcorn, visit the bathroom, talk on the phone, come back and still know where the plot is going. It will keep your interest. So, if you know these guys from their earlier movies, and like them, you won't be disappointed. Grab the popcorn before it starts and enjoy.",1389657600,,666,4.251968503937008

5538192,2,B00AZMFONG,"I really, really wanted to like this movie, but I was disappointed.  I have noticed a trend, in my opinion,  that when actors or actresses age, they begin to over act.  Al Pacino was never an understated actor, but he is way over the top in this movie, to the point were his performance is a distraction whenever he is on screen.  I long for his performances in the Godfather-Serpico days.",1389657600,,389,4.436619718309859

This is a rolicking coming of retirement age flick packed with some seriously awesome action, and a lot of heart. I didn't shed a tear during the entire film, but there were moments. I could write at length about feelings, emotions, impressions, and thoughts I was left with from this film. But I think I'm going to summarize what I took from it, and leave it at that.

Live for this moment and be in it. Honor those close to your heart. Follow what you know is right, regardless if the world agrees.

5538245,5,B00AZMFONG,"First, I really loved this movie. It's a very fine piece of work, a good, entertaining movie that will keep you thinking. The writing is good, though the script doesn't deviate from the standard Hollywood canned meat that gets churned out. However, the acting is spellbinding, so strong and entrancing that the most mundane lines will have your riveted.

Second, though there are predictable Hollywood twists and turns that undermines the intellect of the film, the intelligence of the film still remains. There's layers of tension and mental conflict for the characters and the viewer.

My best endorsement, my wife and I went to bed talking about the film for 30 minutes. That seems to rarely happen these days. Watch and enjoy it!",1389225600,,733,4.951219512195122

5538251,1,B00AZMFONG,I would not recommend this movie. It was not funny and it seemed to drag on and on.  I really like Christopher Walken and Al Pacino but I feel their talents were not used in this movie. I watched the whole movie hoping it would get better but it didn't.

5538259,3,B00AZMFONG,"I thought this film was OK as a film about some very pathetic people who have wasted their lives.  I liked the character Walken played and thought his acting was excellent.  The story felt padded with some sleazy sexual references and devoid of any real wisdom gained.  What I did like about the film was the redemption that the Walken character found through his painting and that he finally made contact with his daughter.  I thought the heavy shoot out at the ending, as the only option, devoid of any strategy was totally unrealistic and looked like some Hollywood director's idea of ""what sells.""  So it was thin on story, wisdom, and classbut there were a few laughs.  Would I purchase it again - No.  I think if this is the last film these fine actors make it is a lousy way to end their careers.  Hopefully it won't be.  Do I recommend it?

5538265,4,B00AZMFONG,"Real pros. They are the only ones who could carry this off. Especially Al Pacino and Christopher Walken. They don't have quite the same cutes that Paul Newman and Robert Redford did, or the youth, but they do pretty well, and this movie packs a harder punch in old age than Butch and Sundance could manage. And Pacino got to dance with his eyes open this time. I wish that Alan Arkin could have hung around longer, but I suppose three's a crowd.",1388707200,,445,4.373493975903615
5538266,4,B00AZMFONG,"""They say we die twice. Once when the breath leaves our body, and once when the last person we know says our name.""--Valentino

The 2012 Fisher Stevens film, Stand Up Guys, has a strong cast. Bringing in $3 million at stand up guysthe box office, it was clearly something of a flop. Unfortunately, Al Pacino, Christopher Walken and Alan Arkin might not be the draw they once were. The 95 minute, Rated R mob-like movie was, if anything, consistent. Not great. Not horrible.

Valentino, ""Val"" to his friends -- Pacino to you and me, is just released from prison after 28 years locked away. ""Doc"" (Walken) meets him at the gate. Retired made-men, the two head back to Doc's, where a pull-out sofa bed is ready for Val. Having spent his retired days painting sunrises and sunsets, Doc is pretty set in his routine. A little frisky after decades behind bars, Val is hoping to party.

Nightclubs, and whore houses, some robbery and plenty of reminiscing is what unfolds. Doc was able to track down his daughter, but not his granddaughter. The regrets of his life apparent in his face, in his words, and even in his actions. Somewhat bitter, Val, was sent to prison and never talked. Never gave anyone up. Took the punishment all on his own.

Mark Margolis portrays the mob boss character, Claphands. He has not forgotten Val, or part of why Val was in prison. Claphands' only son was murdered by Val. The only fair thing is revenge. The clock is set. At 10:00 AM, Val will be dead. One way or the other.

Enter Alan Arkin as Hirsch. Doc and Val rescue their old time friend from a retirement home. They steal a Mustang, and they paint the town red. That is, until they find a surprise in the trunk of the vehicle. And then participate in serving up some serious justice.

Many scenes, I hate to admit are just over acted by Pacino. However, the story continues to move forward.  It is often touching and slightly emotional. It is often humorous and slightly compelling. Overall it is a solid rental, or Netflix kind of film. I did not play with my phone, or scroll statuses on Facebook. It's how I rate a film, people. For these reasons, and the simple respect for the cast, I am giving Stand Up Guys 4 out of 5 stars. Why 4? Because it really was a pretty good film. Not great. But Pretty good. (Lots of bad language, some violence, No Nudity).

I liked the humor as well as the underlying story of how and why the package must be delivered by Walkin. Al Pacino is a master in his role.",1388534400,2,315,4.096774193548387

5538275,2,B00AZMFONG,"While this movie was fun to watch in places it lacked chemistry between the three lead characters. I am a big fan of Walken and have missed Arkin for years, but Pacino has never really been one of my favorites. Pacino's place at the table seem's out of place for me and even Arkin doesn't quite fit at this table. Yes, I know Pacino has played bad/goodguy's foever, but for me he just didn't fit in. They just aren't the dream team of aged outlaws for this story for me and is what's so wrong with this movie along with the script. I think the director shares some of the blame for not getting better performances from the lead characters and working with the writer to induce some life into the story. Unlike the Dodge Hemi powered Challanger SR/T they steal this movie isn't running on all 8 cylinders instead it's running roughly on 3 cylinders. It spits, sputters, coughs and spews raw fuel at it crawls along trying to be funny, touching, tough and in the end needed, but dies alongside the road with it's flashers on waiting for a tow. The standout performance was by Alex (Addison Timlin) as Walken's granddaughter. As always Margulies puts her all into her character and is the only other standout performance in the movie.
The movie has a fair amount of cursing, violence, gunfights and sexual overtones with ladies of the night and the little blue pill, but it doesn't have any nudity nor does it show any torture scenes although there scenes that are a set-up for torture.

I just did not expect this, in the slightest.  The acting is superb, and it is hilarious, touching, sophisticated, and an ultimately heartbreaking and uplifting story about friendship, loss, old age, an ode to simpler times, and undying loyalty to your friends, and how you choose to go out in this world.  One of the all time great endings.  It is a film with so many beautiful little moments.  I cannot recommend it enough.

Definitely has that gritty '70s feel to it despite it being a modern-day tale of gangsters well past retirement age trying to make up for lost time.

The extras also make this DVD worthwhile viewing with a slew of stuff that's way more than the usual Making Of and Outtakes.",1386028800,,542,4.4646464646464645

5538287,3,B00AZMFONG,"You know, one beef I have with this movie is the inaccuracy in which the mafia is portrayed.  No matter how much mafia movies Hollywood creates, they always manage to get the facts wrong.  Two inaccuracies I caught in this movie was Al's character, Val, going into a confessional and confessing that he had committed crimes.  In real life, that wouldn't happen.  Another part was the fact that Christopher's character never killed Val.  In real life he would've whacked Val not matter how close of a friend he is.  Other than that, it's a descent movie.",1385510400,,553,4.708333333333333

5538289,3,B00AZMFONG,"I've gotten to the point in my life that I just can't get much sentimentality going for bad guys. ""Stand Up Guys"" was created with a good deal of material that drips with ill applied attempts at misty-eyed moments. Walken and Pacino play aged and ""washed up"" criminals well, but their internal struggles with family and age are more of a 'who cares' when it boils down to knowing that these mutts had a very immoral and illegal history.

The entertainment value is not in the characters losses or inner turmoils, but in who they ARE now. The comedy of errors is the key to liking this film.  The first half hour is drab with Pachino doing some weird stuff like snorting prescription meds and trying to turn on today's young girls with old school moves. It was bombing so bad I almost turned off the DVD player.

Eventually, a nice stride kicked in and the film became a strange fixation as the two stars street antics became funny and interesting. The arrival of Alan Arkin made for a chemistry fueled trio that increased the chuckle level, sustaining the film. I was also surprised by the solid action sequences and capable posturing by the main stars. It's all more than a bit stagey and full of itself , and from this you get a mediocre film that is unlikely to reach the broadest of audiences.",1384387200,3,1297,4.51063829787234

The only one missing from the lineup in what was apparently a rare act of commonsense was De Niro although it would be easy to fit him in here. Both Walken and Pacino have now become Hairclub Members GOld Star Class. Walken looks like he's wearing part of a sheep on his head and Pacino's hair is standing straight up as though he put his finger in an electric socket. His eyes, no longer exactly bulging from the multiple eye lifts he's had over the years, now gaze out of his skull with bleary eyed vacancy. In multiple scenes the stars seem to drift off, forgetting what lines they had, even what planet they're on. The scenes with the prostitute (Pacino has to run to a pharmacy and wolf down some Viagra then runs back holding his crotch) are simply embarrassing.",1380844800,2,838,4.4480519480519485

He not only rises to the occassion, he lifts everyone else in the movie. They say there are no small roles, only small actors... there are no small actors in this movie. Every line is delivered with perfection and every scene rolls off the screen with style and grace.

5538309,3,B00AZMFONG,"The Guys this movie centers around are old crime buddies reunited after one, Val, is released from a 28-year prison stay, so the plot comes across as an epilogue. Their most thrilling days are behind them, but still they manage to get into plenty of mischief in just a matter of hours. The gist is that Doc has been ordered by his crime boss to kill Val by 10-AM, something he's only reluctantly going along with in order to save his own life. Val killed the boss's son before going to prison, and the boss wants revenge, so if Doc backs out, he too will be killed.

That revelation brings with it a certain level of underlying tension, despite the fact that Doc immediately admits to Val what's going on the moment he gets suspicious enough to ask about it. And tension, however weak, in a movie is a good thing. The problem is that the plot, which often runs in real time, has nowhere to go from there. 10-AM is the deadline and Doc makes it obvious he's going to wait until then to do it, but the random things they do in the meanwhile; this flick is much better at drama than comedy; only strains the plausibility of the plot.

Don't expect a whole lot of murder and guns, there is some of that but it isn't a Quentin Tarantino type thing at all. I won't give away the plot, but it's basically about the lifelong friendship of two 'made guys' and their last day together. One did a long stretch in the joint because he took a fall for the mob; the other went into a regulated sort of retirement, trying to carve a somewhat normal life out of his former occupation. Related to some sins of the distant past, one is ordered to kill the other.

I guess that ""Stand Up Guys"" is intended to be Al Pacino and Christopher Walken's version of ""The Bucket List,"" since apparently every aging male movie star is required to have one before wrapping up his career. And true to the body of work of these two seminal actors, this outing takes the form of a crime comedy/drama, in which they portray geriatric gangsters, one (Walken) retired and the other (Pacino) just paroled after 28 years in the slammer (I use the word ""slammer"" intentionally in an attempt to capture at least some of the anachronistic flavor of this throwback to a bygone era of gangster-movie melodrama). It turns out that Walken has only been allowed to live all these years on the condition that he whack Pacino for killing the only son of an equally decrepit mob boss played by Mark Margolis.

The humor in Noah Haidle's screenplay consists mainly of jokes about the men's various ailments (with a special emphasis on impotence) and medications.  When they're not trying to procure Viagra, they're lamenting the good old days, banging hookers, or going off on little escapades like breaking their buddy (Alan Arkin) out of a retirement home for some just-for-old-times-sake ""tough guy"" fun-and-games on the road.

Directed by Fisher Stevens, the movie feels as wheezy and creaky as the characters it's depicting. The whole thing is based on the premise that there's nothing quite so amusing or heartwarming as watching an assortment of septuagenarians behaving as if they were still in their 20s. The result is patronizing and condescending to both the actors and the members of the audience regardless of their ages.

There's also a sequence at a cemetery (with a hapless Julianna Margulies bearing witness to it) that's a strong contender for Least Plausible Scene of the Year Award.

As to the performers themselves, Walken's effective underplaying is not sufficient to counteract Pacino's endless scenery-chewing.

And while it's nice to see actors of a certain age getting movie roles these days, does it have to be in a vehicle of roughly the same vintage?",1374624000,,2090,4.988505747126437

5538398,1,B00AZMFONG,"This movie proves, as if it needed to be proved, that you can corral the best actors but without a halfway decent script - you have garbage.  They repeat the same brothel scene not once but twice - and believe me, the joke is stale the first time.  There is an absolutely meaningless scene of the stars driving a car - there is no motivation for it other than the three want to see how fast the car can go.  And of course it pads the film out.  The script is witty enough to have been written by a fifteen year old with no imagination and even less intelligence.  No one wants to sit through a film about aging gangsters that could hav ebeen written by one in between hits of Alka-Seltzer and warm milk.  Pacino does his ""Scent of a Woman"" schtick in a seedy bar dancing with a young woman - again the scene goes nowhere.  Juliette Margolies is wasted here.  I think we are meant to laugh while Walken recites all the medications he is taking.  Too, the entire premise of the film - that Walken must kill Pacino or face death himself is silly.  Is it so difficult to kill Pacino's character?  Anybody could do it while the character sleepwalks through the streets of whatever godforsaken city the film is situated in.  Arkin's sole reason for being in the film is to get a laugh out of being able to satisfy two women sexually and to drive a car very fast.  Both of the lead characters lead lives that are so dead and empty that it is difficult to care much whether they kill themselves or not.  To both, death seems preferable to life - it is certainly preferable than sitting through this film more than once.  Please, save your time and money.

5538402,5,B00AZMFONG,"While I am sure many would downplay the film because they might expect a film full of gunfire, explosions, and so on... You should walk into it with an open mind.  It is not an ""action"" film, even though one might think that by the cast.

This film is about 3 old boys, going out one last night and doing what they used to do.  One last night on the town, while the old bones can still hold up.  While there is some action, some gun play.  It is more about the relationship between the main characters; the show of respect, subtle emotions, and honor.

I know this short review cannot explain the film properly.  So, I will end it quickly.  But, if you enjoy Walken and Pacino.  Not the characters they play, but the men themselves, and are curious to see how they play off each other.  This is a great film to see.  The way they feed each other's performance, the way their unique styles mesh, it is quite an interesting thing to see.

Best of all the movie was not based on short attention video game action that constitutes the majority of the screen time in all too many of todays movies.  Yes, there was violence but fortunately, it was not the how many bodies can we pile up, how much FX can we employ, and how can we include a few more explosions movie making that bores to tears after the first 10 minutes.  The violence was believable and the comic touches broad but never degenerating into slapsticks. It's true you don't get to know ""what's really in their souls"" but the two main characters are not the ""let me tell you my innermost secrets"" type guys.

There is a certain rhythm to this movie along with a kind of self-effacing sarcasm, if you are not picking up on the rhythm, you aren't going to get it. But if you do you will thoroughly enjoy the witty conversation which is mixed in with some very serious material. You will understand Christopher Walken's inability to smile, you will contrast this with Al Pacino's conscious decision to always joke around in spite of what he knows, it his way of standing up to fate. This isn't just a movie about a few ex gangsters, nor is it a ""bucket list"" movie, it is clearly a movie about the undercurrents and different sorts of elements in life that affect all people and how different people deal with them in different ways.

This overlooked gem is a must-see for anyone who's a fan of any of the principals (Pacino, Walken, Arken).  Julianna Margulies has a great turn as Arken's daughter and Addison Timlin perfectly played her part (not going to give that away...).

What really made this movie great for me was that it was all about the movie and the art of movie making.  No special effects, nothing that really made you suspend disbelief enough to question the authenticity of the story.  The characters suck you in and hold you until the bitter end.

And I highly recommend it on DVD because there are so many places I got to laughing that if I couldn't have hit the pause, I would have missed too much.

Val, played by Al Pacino, is released from prison after 28 long years, after taking one for the boys, so to speak. At the gate to meet him him, is Doc, played by Christopher Walken. They hug and talk and take off in Doc's old car. They have dinner, drink, go to a 'cat house', where Val discovers he can't get it up. Off to a pharmacy where thy steal needed drugs and back to the cat house. A hidden agenda in all of this is that one man has been hired to kill the other. Their other good friend, Hirsch, is in an old folk's home. Off they go, steal him out of bed, away from his oxygen. Several incidents later, including a stolen hot car, police chase, fight with some real toughs, they end up back at one of Doc's favorite restaurants.

These guys have fun. They all understand they have limited time, and use it artfully. I want these guys to be part of my bucket list. Come on, guys, let's go have fun!

We all understand that much of this can only really occur in our fantasy. You can't take a man from his oxygen out for a night and expect him to keep on breathing. We run into several well known actors through out this night, so exciting. Lost daughters, new clothes, more food than you can ever imagine, and, three old guys, life Long friends. What else could you ever want?

5538445,3,B00AZMFONG,"I suspect Fisher Stevens, not known for his film directing acumen, just lined up the actors, said go and got out of the way.  There's not much of a script or a story here, but it does have a cast of legendary actors doing their thing.  Val (Al Pacino) is getting out of prison for taking the rap during a heist that managed to kill the son of the mob king pin.  Val's ride from prison is an old compatriot known as Doc (Christopher Walken).  Doc is still under the employ of Claphands (Mark Margolis) and his assignment is to kill Val, his friend by the next day.  Claphands blames Val for his son's death.

Val has this figured out and seems OK with it.  He understands but wants to have a little fun first.  Straight laced (by comparison) Doc goes along with it.  They decide to go to the retirement home of their ""driver"" Hirsch (Alan Arkin).  He unhooks himself from his oxygen and away they go in a newly heisted Dodge Challenger SRT.  These guys are funny as hell, especially when they go to their favorite bordello, now run by the daughter (hilarious Lucy Punch) of their more familiar madam.

Doc is really conflicted as he doesn't want to kill Val.  He can't talk Claphands out of it but when his granddaughter's life is threatened, Doc and Val decide to go with plan B.  ""Stand Up Guys"" isn't a great film.  It's not well directed and meanders a lot, but come on.  With Pacino in full ""chatterbox"" mode and Walken providing classic nonverbal reactions and Arkin now so excited to ""live"" again, this film is just plain fun to watch.",1372291200,,1541,4.411347517730497

The one shining spot is Alan Arkin, who seems to make, in very limited roles, a huge impact. In fact, if not for his presence in this movie I would not have watched it to the end. If you are a fan of Pacino and/or Walken, this is NOT the movie you want to remember them by. In spite of Arkin's moments, I cannot recommend this movie in good conscience unless you are a fan that has to see everything done by any of these actors.",1371168000,,574,4.18018018018018

Stand Up Guys suffers from something pretty common, that being it's a typical run-of-the-mill slightly better than forgettable story. Aging gangster get's out of prison, get's picked up by his best friend at the gates, who he doesn't know is also hired to kill him. The story is simple. They ride along together, have some fun, meet up with another old gangster pal and go to a cat house, eat a diners, and drive around while one guy decides if he can kill his friend or not. Not much else else to be said about this movie. Walken, Pacino and Arkin are all fine, but their acting is spot-on average for their abilities, the script is somewhat basic and dull, there's really no action, mediocre comic moments, and not much drama.

The entire of movie was based on a guy spending his day out of prison and the other character was supposed to whack him at the end of the day. A third ""old"" friend is thrown into the mix and magically has all his medical problems live him to drive a chase scene, wear out a hooker, and then die behind the wheel of a stolen car while waiting for his other old friends.

Overall the acting was good, but the story was very weak. You would think with an actor like Pacino, whose voice is so commanding that it makes you want to buy a Jeep even though they are junk cars, the movie could have been built behind the power of his voice. But it wasn't.

As a rental, it was OK. I am glad I didn't spend $40 to go to the theater to see this and somewhat happy I didn't fork over $20 to buy the DVD.

The ending was so Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid, absent the leap, that it left you wondering if they had any real good writers typing out the script.

This just reinforces that actors are trained parrots. You put a good script in front of them and get a good director and they sound like people you would follow into battle.

5538525,4,B00AZMFONG,"I grew up watching Al Pacino and Christopher Walken from their early starts to their current films. I've loved almost every character they've played and every movie they've been in. So when I heard that they were going to be in a movie together playing old time mobsters I was delighted. I'm pleased to say that while this movie doesn't offer them at their extreme best, it is a wonderful film that I might find myself tempted to watch again in the future.

Pacino plays Val, a low level criminal who is just getting out of prison having served a 28 year sentence for an armed robbery where someone was killed. Walken plays Doc, his best friend, who shows to pick him up and take him back home. But things have changed in the old neighborhood not to mention with the two old cons that have aged over the years.

Enjoying his time outside Val doesn't want to go back to Doc's place, he wants to go out on the town and enjoy the life he once knew. He doesn't realize until things happen that he's not who he once was. A visit to the old whorehouse they used to go to finds the new Madame is the old one's grand daughter. An unsuccessful go round for Val leads the duo to break into a pharmacy to steal some Viagra. While there, Doc begins to lift a few other drugs that he now takes on a regular basis. The result of the Viagra lends itself to one of the funniest moments in the film.

Val later attempts to hit on a couple young girls at a club thinking he's still the young buck he once was only to get turned down. He's now an old man. As reality sits in he finds new ways to deal with it.

Unknown to Val is the fact that Doc, while his friend, has been given the unenviable task of killing him. It seems that the big boss, Claphands, wants Val dead. During the robbery that landed Val in jail, Claphands son was shot by Val in the crossfire. Even though Val took the fall for the whole group, even though he was a stand up guy, Claphands wants him dead.

Eventually Val realizes what is going to go down. Rather than fight it, he and Doc set off on a series of adventures in an attempt to live life to the fullest until the fateful hour that Doc has to sign off that he's been killed. Included in those adventures is the rescue from a nursing home of their old wheel man Hirsch (Alan Arkin) who has one of the funniest moments in the film when they return to the whorehouse.

What makes this movie so good is the interplay between Pacino and Walken as two friends who have grown old, one who realizes it and has learned to deal with it living on the outside and the other who doesn't at first having been in prison for 28 years. Living those years in a cell Val hasn't seen the world around him change but Doc has. The prescription scene is one that verifies that. But the camaraderie between these two friends and later Hirsch makes up for their differences and unites them as friends, as stand up guys, until the final moments of the film.

It's rare that either of the lead actors in this film offer a bad performance and here they once again show why they've always been at the top of the list in their profession. Both bring subtle nuances to their roles that many might not see at first but that bring their characters to life. It might be that the roles they play don't lend themselves to being larger than life parts that will become memorable but what they do with these parts makes them realistic and touching in so many ways.

The movie offers many laughs, a heartfelt look at growing old and performances by some of the best actors in the business. It entertains from start to finish and you couldn't ask much more of a movie these days. It may not be a slap in the face effects filled blockbuster of a film but it is one that can be enjoyed more than once.",1369958400,,3772,4.229166666666667

5538529,4,B00AZMFONG,"In Stand Up Guys - Al Pacino and Christopher Walken get together and nail it.  Unlike another legendary pair-up which fell flat (Pacino with Deniro in Heat & Righteous Kill), Pacino and Walken are really effortless in this.

Some critics bemoaned the lack of this or that - Pacino and Walken not dark enough; not enough depth; weak plot and such, but give the guys a break!  This is a minor classic that rises above what could have been just another typical gangster outing.  Most criminal / wiseguy films try too hard and take themselves way too seriously, which this film never does.

Stand up Guys endears itself by simply letting the two actors take centerstage with strong scenes and great dialogue.  (I remember when DeNiro and Pacino just didn't have enough screen time together in Heat - one scene and that was it.  It was like Michael Mann feared overkill or competition between the two men.)

The chemistry evokes Samuel Jackson and John Travolta in Pulp Fiction - there's an ease and swagger with Pacino wearing the ex-con mantle like his second skin, and Walken playing his faithful, troubled best friend.  Throw in some Alan Arkin (always playing a loony in the movies nowadays) for good measure, and this is about as good as it gets for our all-star 70s team.

Yeah, I thought about Pacino in Godfather 2 and how far he's evolved.  He still talks loud like he has for years, but at least it feels like an old comfortable shoe.  I've also never been much of a Walken fan myself but it's one of his best roles.  What more could you ask for?  Kinda like Ali and Frasier fighting for the 3rd time and giving it their best shot. I didn't expect too much from these guys but they surprised me and exceeded expectations.

Good direction from Fisher Stevens.  The film is more intelligent than it gets credit for and I loved the look and cinematography.  This film definitely deserves a bigger audience.",1369872000,,1909,4.617210682492582

Fischer Stevens' direction falls short of delivering a gritty action-drama-comedy essence, reminiscent of what many late-80's and early-90's movies were founded on (think True Romance, Reservoir Dogs, Die Hard, Raw Deal, etc). He was certainly near the ballpark, but was still parking his car and didn't quite make it in.
Alan Arkin completely livens up the movie with his short lived role; Walken and Pacino have recited better scripts, and certainly emoted better roles, but all in all, it wasn't a complete train wreck... it was mildly entertaining, and somewhat funny during some scenes.
However, with the running time coming in around one hour and a half, the monkeys helming the script certainly could have come up with a way BETTER way to end the movie.",1369785600,,860,4.897260273972603

Sounds pretty good doesn't it? Unfortunately an idea and the execution of that idea are two very different things. The first part of movie starts off pretty good but fairly quickly I found myself thinking ... uh oh. It started giving me the same feeling as if I went to Benihanas Japanese Steakhouse only to learn my favorite secret sauce was watered down that night. It's that type of disappointment.

Direction was ok, photography was ok, production values good but the storyline itself was somewhat corny and ridiculous. When you see older actors beating up on young mobsters ... it reminds me of watching Roger Moore as he aged and was paired up with very young and incredibly sexy leading ladies. I'm sorry, it just doesn't happen in real life and that's what you think watching this movie. So rather than capture perhaps the trials and tribulations aged of mobsters ... you get a ""candy version"".

This movie grossed only $3 million domestically at the box office which is to say it was a magnificent bomb. With better writing, me thinks it could have been much more. An idea popped into my head that the producers of this movie might owe Pacino and Walken an apology. Did they ever get one? Your guess is as good as mine.

Truth be told a lot of the dialogue feels improvised.  Pacino gets most of the laughs because he is in his ""Scent of a Woman"" mode.  Walken plays straight man by default.

5538558,3,B00AZMFONG,"I was really anticipating a great character movie here, the first time Pacino and Walken together in a movie. Unfortunately their styles just don't fit together or possibly overlap in some ways. I think Pacino's quick and rapid fire style dialogue in this movie just don't mesh well with Walken's more measured surprising style of dialogue. Walken capitalizes in most movies on moments of silence, storytelling and startled comments. Unfortunately Pacino's more frantic speed walking style of dialogue just don't seem to allow Walken to shine. Walken seems to get lost in a thinker role who doesn't say much of importance throughout the whole movie, almost passing as a kind of chauffeur. Arkin seems to bring much added spiciness later in the movie but even then there's not enough dialogue scenes to really allow them to shine as a group, I was really hoping Arkin would have more of a  'dwellings on his life' speech in this movie which would have added a necessary dynamic. I think this movie tried to rely too much on driving all over the place, visiting a kind of brothel on and on amongst other places which might have made sense but I just don't think it allowed for enough momentous dialogue opportunities, again with Walken hardly ever seeming in his element throughout this movie. This movie did put forth the idea of what it would be like if they were both opposing bosses or something in a movie, that would seem to be a better fit for these actors.",1369267200,2,1462,4.733333333333333
5538559,3,B00AZMFONG,"They had a chance to make a great drama. SPOILER ALERT: They could have built more intelligent dialogue regarding the quandry both Pacino's and Walken's characters are in, instead of mixing sensitive, intelligent dialogue with silly situations which press the viewer's ""suspension of disbelief:"" Old men reducing hookers to quivering groupies, ridiculous car-chase scenes (where the police cars just kind of give-up and go away), old-men beating-up-bad guys, walking mindlessly into a shootout at the end all had the effect of leaving one wondering what movie they're making.

I thought the chemistry and dialogue between Walken and Pacino - especially at the beginning, was EXCELLENT. There is a great dramatic moment as the characters and the viewers realize this is not a warm ""homecoming"" for recently released from prison Pacino. AND then something else takes over: it's every older man's dream: fast cars, faster women, saving imprisoned females and meting out justice for same and endearing oneself to one's grand-daughter before the credits role. Is there a store these ""cutouts"" are purchased from?  It was also somewhat awkward to watch the intelligent dialogue mix with one of the silliest car-chase scenes ever. It's almost like two directors. One picks up on the nuance involved in older tough-guys embracing after 28 years, and the other picks up ideas from ""Hangover"" and ""Frat-House"" movies, except in this case the vicarious thrills are all slanted for the geriatric audience.",1369267200,,1493,5.322033898305085

I should have listened to the other negative reviews, but I just thought to myself that there was no way a movie with Christopher Walken and Pacino could be that bad.  I was wrong.  Its not that the acting was bad, its just the characters were not at all cool.  They were trying to sell this old and still hip Pacino, but it just came off as cheesy and somewhat creepy.

Aside from the terrible characters, you would think it would have an entertaining plot.  You would be wrong.  The plot is so basic and really nothing happens.

5538563,4,B00AZMFONG,"A stand up guy is defined as someone who refuses to rat out the Family no matter what the pressure, offer, or threat. It is an apt title for this little film that decides at the onset to remain small. It does offer some of our favorite aging actors the opportunity to redefine friendship in a very tender and warm manner. Is it s a great movie? No, not really, but is it worth watching for the joy of seeing Al Pacino, Christopher Walken and Alan Arkin join talents - most definitely `yes.'

Valentino/'Val' (Al Pacino) is an old school, small time, two-bit crook who took the fall for a botched robbery 28 years prior. Being a ""Stand up guy"", Val did his time and kept his mouth shut, and never revealed any information with regards to the crime; he didn't cop a plea, rat out his friends, and he was tried and sentenced to the full extent of the law. Val's best friend and cohort in crime is Doc (Christopher Walken). While in prison and even now as Val prepares to be reintegrated back into society, Doc has always been there for Val. However, Doc has a heavy burden weighing on his conscious. It seems that during all the gunfire shot amid the botched robbery, Val inadvertently shot and killed the only son of the crime syndicates Boss, Claphands (Mark Margolis). Claphands has waited 28 long years for retribution; and Doc has been ordered to execute the hit on Val, and he only has 24 hours to complete the task or suffer repercussions himself for noncompliance.

In the interim 24 hours we meet the lovely waitress Alex (Addison Timlin) who happens to be Doc's granddaughter, the third member of the old gang Hirsch (Alan Arkin) whom Val and Doc rescue from a rest home to spend the night at a brothel run by Wendy (Lucy Punch), Val's experience with impotence at the brothel that leads him to overdose on Viagra he and Doc steal from a pharmacy and that leads to Val's priapism that requires aspiration in a hospital attended by Nina Hirsch (Julianna Margulies) who is Hirsh's daughter, and a final encounter with the thugs of Claphands and Claphands himself as the 24 hour deadline approaches.

It is all great fun and even more important is the expression of the bond of friendship between Val and Doc, and with Hirsch. Yes the script gets off key at times but this is not meant to be a major gangster film. This is a tale about friendship and loyalty in a crime setting that has just happened to age - not unlike the actors.  Grady Harp, May 13",1369008000,5,2456,4.475446428571429

This movie will give you some laughs and give you that ""hell yeah!"" feeling, but it's also about a friendship and how strong and difficult it can be.

It wasn't brilliant or exciting or innovative; it was comfortable. Watching Pacino, Walken and Arkin play off each other was like watching three old buddies get together for a reunion. It's wonderful to see three old pros doing what they do best - light up the screen.
It was a great length - long enough to hold a complete story, short enough to not scream for editors to come finish the job to get on with the story...
Synopses of the plot are everywhere so explaining it isn't necessary here. Let's just say this was so entertaining that I'd pay another time to see it on the big screen. The next day I was still thinking back on it and smiling.
Just a note: This is not a lighthearted comedy. There are some very dark elements. But the viewer who looks at this collaboration and doesn't expect violence and some rough scenes must have come from another planet..

5538577,5,B00AZMFONG,"This movie has Al Pacino, Christopher Walken, Alan Arkin, and as a small side note Julianna Margulies.  And no i don't include her as a legend actress. But it was great to see her in it, if only for a moment. Fist in my humble opinion, Once you see the first three actors I think you just order it as a must see. The plot is good.  Story line is great.  Acting is just fantastic.  TheY really cleaned up Walken for this role. Al Pacino's character looks a little beat up. And Arkin looks about the same. I won't give anything away. The story is basically this.  Al Pacino and his two friends were not the most law abiding men. Some events took place, Al Pacino's character took the fall for everyone and went to jail.  They are old school hence the title ""Stand Up Guys"".  These guys don't rat on anyone. Well During one of the events 25 years earlier at least i think, along with the illegal things they were doing, which they don't go into that much, but enough for you to get the point, something goes very wrong, and Al Pacino's character is blamed by a mob boss. Now, Walkens character is the only one who kept in touch, and sent care packages. Walkens also has issues, as in no contact with his daughter or granddaughter.  These things he is working on. Pacino while out tells walken to get a move on and get his family straight. But Walken is not thinking about that as much at the moment. Al Pacino just got out of jail and he is still a bit of a party animal and wants to have fun. So Walken is keeping an eye on his best friend, Pacino's Character. The mistake I mentioned earlier was that some big mob boss seemed fit to blame on Pacino's character, and this is really the main theme of the movie more so and the few that are left from the earlier crew, they are gone except the few you see. They add up to three?  Well these three that are left, their  involvement now that Pacino is out is also a big deal in keeping with the theme.

I cant go into anymore than that without giving anything away. What i can tell you is this.  It is first class acting for any generation, a story for any generation, and it does keep you on the edge of your seat or i should say suspenseful until the very end. There is no way you can go wrong. They also add dry humor, sarcastic humor in there at the exact moments you would want it. It was written perfectly in my eyes.  Even if you are not great fans of any of these people, and i cant see how you cant be, but even if your not, it is just a breath of fresh air in terms of movies that have been coming out over the last five years. Maybe decade.  These actors and actresses just work perfectly together and have great chemistry. I give it 5 stars and i say watch it.  You won't be disappointed in this movie. It brings out so many emotions as well up to the very end. I loved it. And i think you guys and gals will to.  Great Movie.....FYI...I AM HAVING TROUBLE WITH MY LAPTOP AND I CANT GET THE FONT ANY BIGGER. I AM VERY SORRY IF THIS PRINT IS TO SMALL.",1368316800,2,3005,4.111111111111111
