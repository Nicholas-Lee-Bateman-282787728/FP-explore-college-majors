4337096,2,B004EFN6K8,"A big deception, the content of this video is basically the same from earlier versions.  Not recommended.  She has so many CDs with so many great songs, is about time she includes new songs at her concerts.",1351641600,,206,4.54054054054054
4337097,3,B004EFN6K8,"This DVD, recorded in San Sebastian, Spain, in 2008, features only 10 tracks, and one of them is the band introduction.  Diana shines on the other nine selections, including two performances not found on her other concert DVDs, ""I'll String Along with You,"" and the title track.

This is not an authorized Diana Krall DVD.  The picture quality is not as good as her other concert DVDs, though the sound quality is fine.  The end credits are in Spanish; this may have been taped for Spanish TV.  This is probably one of those ""gray-market"" releases; not a bootleg, but not completely legal either.

4337098,1,B004EFN6K8,"Dear Diana,

you are amazing BUT it is time for you to move on to a label where the execs brains have not been fried by ""medical marijuana"".

The only format for this recording is Vinyl. Seriously VINYL.

Allow me to count the ways Vinyl is a useless piece of crap. Skips, static, dust, wow and flutter, warps, melts, scratches, erodes as you play it, can't play tracks from the ""other"" side, can't take it in your car, on a walk, on a bike, on your boat, anywhere, and it doesn't sound anything like DVD-A, and that is just for starters.

I will not buy this. Tell your producres to stop smoking crack.",1328572800,6,603,4.3097345132743365
4337099,3,B004EFN6K8,"Elvis Costello should stick to writing and composing songs for himself.  There are a couple of cuts that are ok.  I loaned this DVD to a friend and had the same reaction.  Also, my wife is an avid fan of Krall and she was disappointed.  Should have saved my money.",1322179200,2,264,4.22
4337100,5,B004EFN6K8,"Her Paris concert at the Olympia in 2001 is preserved as a music DVD, as her 2004 performance at the Montreal Jazz Festival, her 2008 performance at Rio de Janeiro, and her 2008 performance at the Jazzaldia Festival in San Sebastin, Spain, also are preserved, the last issued for the US market as In Concert Diana Krall Doing All Right. (As of this writing YouTube has her band's performance at the 2010 Montreaux Jazz Festival.)

Diana Krall is a treasure and a gift, born nine months after The Beatles' first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, and growing up to become a celebrated recording artist coincidentally in the same year the DVD was developed. These are accidents of fate, technology, destiny, and life. We are richer for having those early recordings of Louis Armstrong when recording and preserving music were the same age as Louis himself; and for the unplanned (and barely known) recording of Benny Goodman's 1938 Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert, which could not be accurately recreated until the LP record was developed in 1947 (in 1967: ""It was twenty years ago today/Sergeant Pepper taught the band to play...""). That Benny Goodman concert recording was issued in 1950 as the first double-LP and quickly became the first million-selling LP recording. It has never gone out of print, being upgraded through each developing format.

Watching and listening to Diana Krall and her band, I sometimes realize I haven't taken a breath for long stretches.

The wonderful paradox: Jazz interpretations are never the same, while watching and listening to a recorded performance again (and again) means seeing and hearing the identical performance. Love means never wanting to eject.

So anything Diana records is worth my purchase and devotion, she being Diana and me being me (twisting Paul Anka a little: ""You're so young, and I'm so old, this my 'darlin' I've been told, O please stay by me, Diana""). This music DVD, Doing All Right, is sloppy and with little to recommend, though I love it.

Amazon's product information identifies the video format as PAL (European TV standard), and the DVD as playable in Region 1 (US & Canada). However, the product itself identifies the video format as NTSC (North American TV standard) and lists ""ALL"" regions for the DVD codec. The product's case lists Dolby Digital Stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, and DTS 5.1 Surround; but the DVD has no menu, has no input selection choices for sound output and decoding. My AV receiver decodes all audio formats as of 2009, and it defaulted to Dolby Digital Surround but would not change (except for simulated effects like Rock Arena) or 'read' the DTS encoding if it exists.

The video quality is substandard, literally: it's not even DVD Standard Definition. It looks like pretty good VHS tape (but not S-VHS quality). It might look okay if the playback system doesn't upscale to 1080p, but I haven't tried a direct playback to find out. I will try a lower resolution since the guitar strings sometimes show dragon's teeth all over them, a sure sign of upscaled resolution from lower definition.

The audio is quite good, no better than quite good, and I suspect the microphones and recording equipment are merely quite good, unlike the state-of-art definition we're accustomed to expect. Robert Hurst's bass is not full, and Jeff Hamilton's bass drum is practically absent unless he kicks it. Or maybe the DVD product was manufactured and copied poorly. I don't mind, but others might demand better.

The performance and the music. Diana's Live In Rio DVD performance was recorded in early 2008, while this Doing All Right DVD was recorded in late July of 2008, a few months later. It's fun to see her doing exploratory things at this San Sebastin performance that she probably chose not to do for the Rio DVD. A marketing decision? This DVD is not listed (or mentioned) at her official (Verve) web site. (The credits at the end are in Spanish; it's a legal recording but apparently not a Diana Krall authorized product, as it were.) Plus, for Rio she guarded her voice before the performance (making a music DVD at the highest level is a very expensive process), while here in Spain in late July after a day at the beach with her 19-month-old twin boys, she sounds sandier than she sounds sultry.

The DVD begins with Let's Fall In Love followed by The Look Of Love, after which Diana introduces the band (Anthony Wilson, guitar; Robert Hurst, standup bass; Jeff Hamilton, drums) and says the first song was written by Peggy Lee (huh?) and this song just played, by Burt Bacharach. Hmm. Maybe she's so used to opening with I Love Being Here With You, was nervous or overcome with jet lag, or the band did play the Peggy Lee song but the DVD didn't include it. New to me is watching Diana listening closely to Anthony Wilson; it's clearly visible how she concentrates and thinks.

Wilson and Hamilton seem to be out of sorts. If you've had extreme west-to-east jet lag, you might recognize the symptoms in those two musicians. Perhaps they ate lunch together and are feeling ill. Krall and Hurst appear fine and always jolly. But Hamilton and Wilson look like they're having some difficulty concentrating. Hamilton misses strokes and fills, loses his count and rhythm several times, and you can plainly see his displeasure with himself. Wilson also displays his frustration, but unlike those instances at some other times when he attempts something impossible and just misses the mark, in this performance he is trying to keep up, trying to make no mistakes, and he spends a lot of stage time listening when he looks like he knows he should be playing. It's not as if he's lost any of his excellence since at Montreaux two years later he plays better than ever.

At one point after a song Diana calls Anthony ""the lovely Anthony Wilson"", he goes ""Hnn?"" and she clarifies that his playing is lovely (which is pretty much the highest praise from artist to artist). Also new on this DVD is a nice camera shot high above and in front of Diana of a key light with a huge swarm of gnats or moths (it's not HD, so I can't tell which). And this time it's never obvious that Diana is reading the lyrics laid flat atop her Steinway. She pulls at the hem part of her dress several times to adjust it over her knees, rising off the leather or vinyl bench, and appears slightly uncomfortable. I think she still has her bathing suit on underneath, and you know that damp feeling, right?

Do not buy this DVD of Diana Krall for your first DVD of her and her band's performance. It deserves no more than one star, but it also contains some five-star stuff, and often. And because she's Diana Krall and can play everything, and play it uniquely, exquisitely, and lovely, and I'm me, I gave it five stars.",1315267200,11,6779,4.76
