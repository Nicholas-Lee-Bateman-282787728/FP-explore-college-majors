3790761,1,B001TIGFCY,"I recently watched this on Netflix and was shocked to see that it was an hour long! It could have easily been a 30 minute show and still get to the point of fashion influencing film and vice versa. As a recent college graduate entering the costumes world of film, I greatly appreciated the input of the costume designers of the program...why not put more focus on them rather than talking heads like Jennifer Beals and Malin Akerman? Just because costume designers aren't as famous as actors doesn't mean that costume designers don't know what they are talking about! I mean, they mentioned Edith Head for about 5 seconds and then moved on...why not talk about her and her work! Her designs influenced fashion in her day!
My point is either lightly browse various subjects in a documentary of about 30 minutes or go more in depth with a 2 hour long special. History Channel does that all the time and I enjoy their programing. This documentary puts too much focus on the strangest things like Keira Knightley's gown in ""Atonement"" I didn't really see how it trumped other iconic dresses that the program failed to mention, like Marilyn Monroe in ""The Seven Year Itch"".
Also, I'm worried about the accuracy of this program. When the narrator mentioned ""Atonement"", she mentioned that it was nominated for several Academy Awards, including one for Keira Knightely. WRONG! Keira has been nominated for an Oscar...for ""Pride and Prejudice""! That's a very simple thing to check up on too...just go to imdb.com and look it up! So if these filmmakers screw up something as simple as someone being nominated for a particular film, it makes me consider what else in the program might be totally inaccurate.
Overall, like Brett Ratner (because he totally knows about fashion or costume design *sarcasm*) said about costumes/ fashion being eye candy, this ""documentary"" is nothing but eye candy, unfortunately without any substance. Watch this on mute!",1306368000,10,1941,4.920731707317073

3790763,2,B001TIGFCY,"This movie would be great if it were edited down to 15 minutes. Most of it is talking heads going on and on about this designer or that trend.  The blurb indicated that it would deal with Edith Head, costumes in film,etc.  That takes up about ten minutes, and it merely shows a photo of Ms. Head. It doesn't deal with the iconic elements of her designs.  The rest looks like those MTV fillers where actors and unrecognizable ""fasion experts"" give their preferences and opinions.  I showed it to my film class and was embarrassed by the lack of information and the vapid way in which it was delivered.  I wanted to fast forward through the first 30 minutes, but I kept hoping it would get better.  There have to be better movies about costumes and fashion in film.  I'm still searching.",1255737600,20,785,4.485915492957746
3790764,5,B001TIGFCY,"I teach fashion to high school students grades 10-12.  This was a great video to use.  It portrayed how much of an impact films/movies, actors and actresses have on what we wear, the current styles, trends, designs, etc.  The students really enjoyed it, especially since they use popular, well known actors and actresses that we can all relate to.",1244419200,27,347,4.8474576271186445

8341566,1,B001TIGFCY,"Was looking forward to an interesting documentary about fashion in film.  Instead, all I got was a disconnected series of soundbites and cliches from an endless string of minor players who really didn't have much to say.  Gave up after about 40 minutes.",1399420800,,253,4.8604651162790695
8341567,4,B001TIGFCY,This movie explores the symbiotic relationship between clothes and movies and how important the clothing designer is to a movie.,1372032000,,128,5.45
8341568,4,B001TIGFCY,this is a pretty good documentary about how fashion and film and vice versa influence each other. It is a light docu and i wish there were more comprehensive information about this subject.,1370304000,,189,4.757575757575758
8341569,1,B001TIGFCY,"So not memorable.  I was expecting something more thorough and well-researched, but it was entirely fluff.  I suppose if I had researched the film in advance, I would have figured out that it would have been a waste of time.  Just look at the people interviewed for this documentary!  Do any of them look like they have anything interesting to say about the long and interesting story of fashion in film, which goes back at least to the 1940s?  Amanda Bynes?!  Seriously?  If I hadn't paid for it, I would have stopped watching 15 minutes in.  Instead, I watched the whole thing and am now upset that I'll never get that part of my life back.",1364515200,,642,4.474137931034483
