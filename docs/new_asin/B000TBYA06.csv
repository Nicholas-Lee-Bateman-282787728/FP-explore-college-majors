8208551,2,B000TBYA06,"The truth about the Philadelphia experiment?  I watched this video and I still don't know what it is.  This is a very amateur production, editing, and cinema attempt.  It is more boot leg than anything else, with scenes from old 70's and 80's shows.  I guess the witnesses believe what they say, but presentation, it's going to be ugly.",1365984000,2,336,4.6440677966101696
8208552,4,B000TBYA06,"Invisibility, remote viewing, time travel - was the United States military involved in practical research and actual demonstrations of these theoretical capabilities during World War II? This film goes into great detail about the Navy's magnetic de-gaussing project whose ostensible aim was to make a ship de-magnetized against mines and invisible to radar, but whose real objective was actual physical invisibility of a warship. The project dove-tailed with the Montauk project which was using volunteer personnel to experiment with psychic research into remove viewing and time travel and with the Phoenix time travel project forty years later to the day, according to 1989 interviews with actual participants in these experiments. It's worth wading through much dry interview footage to gather some very convincing testimony about time travel and age regression experiments conducted during a forty-year period as the Rainbow project morphed into the Phoenix project with the original 1942 Philiadelphia Experiment as the starting point.",1275264000,4,1040,5.716129032258064
8208553,5,B000TBYA06,"I have never seen anything like this! It was the most informative presentation I have ever seen and explains so much about what most people do not understand when it comes to the possibility of time travel, remote viewing, UFOs, invisibility projects and the like. This DVD set is an education and it's an entertaining one. I could not be more satisfied!",1245542400,5,354,4.725806451612903
8208554,5,B000TBYA06,"This is a very mysterious dvd set.

The first disk talks about some very mysterious subjects such as the Bermuda Triangle and Atlantis.

Then the second disk is an actual interview with Al Bielek, his brother Duncan Cameron, and the mysterious Preston Nichols.

These three (if you believe them) have been through some very mysterious experiences.

I do believe them but I don't claim to understand the true nature of what they are talking about.  To me I believe it is satanic. Al hints at this himself sometimes and says that some of those alien creatures he knows about are evil.

Preston Nichols doesn't get into it in this particular dvd but he has travelled to the Pleiades star constellation at faster than light speeds with non human creatures.  He was almost killed when someone or something disabled him while he was driving a car.

They discuss the Philadelphia Experiment which later became the Montauk Project.

Personally I believe that things which for us today fall into the realm of rumors and conspiracies indicate ancient secrets that were known on Atlantis and very ancient Egypt and which have been gradually rediscovered starting around the time of World War 2.

So I agree that the first disk in this set is relevant to this subject.

This dvd set is highly recommended for anyone who's interested in mysterious subjects, alternative science / technology, or conspiracies.

8208555,1,B000TBYA06,"Remarkably this ""home-style"" video is being packaged and sold as a serious truth about the Philadelphia Experiment.  Now when I say home-style video, that's exactly what I mean.  The product that I received was recorded on two ""off the shelf"" 50 cent DVD's (not a good start).  I don't know what cheap DVD menu editing software program was used but my eight-year-old daughter could design something more professional with a box of crayons!  Frankly, its programs like these that will never give a serious subject quality airtime.  If the original intention was as an historic occasion for the participating cast (or mates), fine...leave it at that.  If it was intended as a viable commercial concern (and I don't think it was), at least hire some quality editing services and not just transfer a poor quality video (& sound) to a 50-cent DVD.  I was so disappointed with the quality production that I did not view the entire DVD and have returned the product to AMAZON.",1194134400,29,969,4.836363636363636
