934693,4,6304818262,"OK, so there are some goofy hillbilly types running around the swamp, getting bled dry by gigantic leeches. Yes, the leeches are grown men wearing plastic trash bags. The hero is a living Ken doll. So what?! The ONLY reason to watch this flick is to see Yvette Vickers (Attack Of The 50 Foot Woman) in her underwear! She dances! She prances! She applies body-lotion! She parades about like the free-spirit she is! Hallelujah! I remember seeing her in this movie 33 years ago. I was 9 years old. I never forgot her!

934694,3,6304818262,"Fans of fifties creature features should enjoy this smarmy swamp saga about vampirish predators that keep captives in caves to suffer lingering, sucked-dry deaths.  The monsters are fearsomely fun, the hero hairy-chested and handsome, the leading lady clingy and lovely, and the leading non-lady cleavaged and vampily luscious.  The scripting is tolerably sensible, and the acting and direction are above average for this sort of cinema.  In its day, this movie's gruesome mutants and waterborne dead bodies would have seemed more grisly than gleeful.

This is not a masterpiece like THEM or TARANTULA but it is a lot fun to watch.
Yvette Vickers is, to put it simply, gorgeous !  Tho it is uneven, there is a spooky mood over the movie. I have never been to Florida but there is something very creepy about the swamps and within the budget < which would get you a coffee and do nut today>, works well.
I can speculate and say it would be a minor classic had the leeches never been shown, but it was made fo r the drive in crowsd and the luckier ones were not interested in the movie by that point. :-)
Anyway, this i s a campy, fun film for the whole family <no real violence> and Yvette is certainly candy for the eye!

934697,2,6304818262,"These two films are from the Corman production mill.  Roger directed A Bucket of Blood, which is a very entertaining (and brief) satire on coffeehouse/beatnik art pretensions.  The Giant Leech movie has a couple of funny scenes with Bruno veSota and Yvette Vickers but otherwise falls flat.  The print of A Bucket of Blood used for this DVD starts off very badly; it's choppy and distracting from the wonderful opening monologue (""I will talk to you of art, for there is nothing else to talk about..."").  Worse, the sound quality is muffled, and it sounds like noise reduction was applied to a master tape that wasn't recorded with Dolby - instead of removing hiss, all the high and low tones are reduced to a flat middle-range.  Sometimes it's difficult to understand the dialogue for this reason.

934699,2,6304818262,"This is one of those movies that are so terrible that you have alot of fun watching it and making fun of it. The swamp natives are stereotypically ignorant backwater white trash, and the leading lady is ever so  stereotypically ready to faint and hide her face at every scene, and always  leaves the dreadful work up to the big strong men. That and make coffee  ofcourse. She always was making coffee for the men. The acting is  beautifully sub-par and almost seems as if it was shot while they were  rehearsing their lines (except for the believeable character of the  sheriff). You'll marvel at the scientific dialogue of the  ""doctor"" and his theories of the leeches origin (hokey fourth  grade science that is, almost as bad as the movie where the locals needed  ""SODIUM...WE NEED SODIUM!

934700,2,6304818262,"If you try hard, you can find both positive and negative things to say of this movie.  One definite plus is Yvette Vickers, who looks good in  leopard-skin underwear. The tawdry little plot is a combination of Erskine  Caldwell style southern lust and adultery portrayed against the background  of a 1950s/early 1960s low-budget sci-fi flick. Some of the supporting  characters resemble the ""gloom, despair, and misery"" guys from  TV's Hee Haw.  There are atomic-size leeches in the local swamp.  The  authorities are baffled when local-yocals mysteriously disappear.  As in  many of these old sci-fi flicks, the script wastes time having the various  characters dispute that anything unnatural is going on, and then arguing  over how to deal with the problem.
Ultimately, this movie can either be  totally disregarded, or taken as unintentional humor.  I usually have a  weakness for movies that are ""so-bad-they're-good,"" hence the 2  stars rating.  Others beware.",941068800,7,966,5.326666666666667

934871,4,6304818262,"Released in 1959, Attack of the Giant Leeches takes place in a small swamp community in Florida where giant leeches threaten the populace. Ken Clark stars as the ranger who investigates the strange happenings.

I didn't have much hope for this flick considering its dubious name, its short length (62 minutes) and the fact that its B&W, but the characters are decent and the story engrossing enough. The late 50s ambiance is worth the price of admission and the swamp atmospherics effective. Clark makes for a great masculine protagonist with his athletic build and meek disposition (sorta like a smaller Clint Walker). Jan Shepard plays his wife, the good girl, contrasted by Yvette Vickers bad girl. Vickers was the July 59 Playmate of the Month and the movie is sure to show off her body a little bit. While the leech monsters are rather lame, the sequences in the underwater cave where the leeches suck the blood of their captives is pretty nightmarish with the accompanying spooky music.

Despite these positives, critics lambaste the movie on the grounds that the leeches are laughable, essentially people covered in trash bags with suckers here & there where you can clearly see the actors' arms moving inside the bags. If you can overlook this shortcoming, this is worthwhile 50s swamp horror.

The film was shot in Los Angeles.

934928,5,6304818262,"A fabulously awful sci-fi flick featuring yokels besieged by humongous leeches residing in the Florida Everglades.  They have a taste for blood, and thankfully, enough yahoos willing to stray too close to the water to feed their need (yes, a couple were forced into their watery grave at gunpoint but that was adultery so it doesn't count).  Almost as soon as the residence are supposed missing, a search party is sent to look for them.  Led by intrepid game warden Steve Benton (Ken Clark), they search high and not low enough to find the delinquent corpses.  They are not helped by a contentious sheriff (Gene Roth) who'd rather scoff than do his due diligence.  It took them eight days to make this masterpiece.  One wonders what they could have done with ten or twelve days!

This movie is an odd mix of soap opera and vague horror confined to a cave and some underwater sequences.  The dialog is a hoot, the acting even more so.

Watch as she dances, prances, and parades about in skimpy outfits, like the free-spirit she is! Just the scene of her applying leg lotion is enough to guarantee her legendary status! Hell, I haven't even mentioned her leopard-print underwear! EEK!

Bruno VeSota (THE UNDEAD, WAR OF THE SATELLITES) is memorable as Liz's jealous husband. Gene Roth (ZOMBIES OF MORA TAU, EARTH VS.

935019,3,6304818262,"Now this is what I'm talking about. When I think ""Classic Horror"", I think of stuff like the 1959 cheesefest ATTACK OF THE GIANT LEECHES. It's got a silly premise, idiotic characters, and some of the dumbest-looking monsters I can recall ever seeing on film. I mean, let's face it, if you can't scare me, the least you can do is be entertaining in other ways. ATTACK OF THE GIANT LEECHES succeeds.

The story takes place in some unnamed backwoods swamp community where game warden Steve Benton (Ken Clark) is charged with the task of protecting the local wildlife. But when bodies start piling up, and all the evidence points to something in the swamp, Steve must choose between his duty to the animals and his desire to save the lives of his neighbors.

It starts when one of the poachers claims to have put five rounds of buckshot into a creature he spotted earlier one night. When he goes back to check on his traps, he finds out there was more than one.

Then the local store-owner Dave (Bruno VeSota) discovers his wife Liz (Yvette Vickers) and her lover Cal (Michael Emmet) and forces them into the swamp where the gators are. He only wanted to scare them, though, so he tells them to come out of the water. But he's too late and creatures Dave's never seen before rise up and pull Liz and Cal under. The police think Dave is using the old poacher's tale of a swamp creature to cover up his crime and he's put in jail where he later hangs himself.

Meanwhile, Steve and his girlfriend Nan (Jan Shepard) have been combing the swamps looking for anything out of the ordinary. Nan's father, Doc Greyson (Tyler McVey) tries to convince Steve they can use dynamite to blow any bodies that might be trapped underwater back to the surface, but Steve refuses, vowing to keep safe any innocent wildlife in the water.

When two more good old boys who've also gone looking for the bodies of Liz and Cal turn up missing, Doc Greyson takes matters into his own hands and sets off the dynamite anyway. Three bodies float to the surface--but they're looking for four. And these bodies, while having been missing for days, show signs of only having died a few hours ago. They think Liz may still be alive somewhere, perhaps trapped in an underwater air pocket.

Steve and a friend don their diving gear and go searching. When they run into the creatures, it's an underwater struggle with all the excitement of an afternoon nap.

This movie is hilarious--not in any real attempt at humor, but looking back at the behavior of the characters, and the stereotypes involved, you can't help but laugh. The times, they have certainly changed since 1959.

Steve, Nan, and Doc Greyson all sit around the Greyson house, smoking and drinking coffee while discussing the creatures that may or may not be in the water. When Steve and Nan are out on the boat, Nan offers Steve coffee, and later, when Steve is about to arrest Doc Greyson for using the dynamite, Doc asks, ""Do we have time for a cup of coffee first?""

The secondary characters have the thick southern accents, and dialogue that would be at home in any BEVERLY HILLBILLIES episode, while the main characters are strong, good-looking, well-educated. It's obvious from his interactions with the other characters that Steve isn't local--so obviously he's the only hope to save the day, because that's how it always works. The outsider comes to the rescue.

The budget was obviously small, and the creatures couldn't have cost more than $10 at most to put together. They looked like the actors playing them had been draped in black garbage bags, then had giant plastic suckers glued to their faces. Most of the characters are always covered in sweat, which lends a nice touch of reality to the swamp locale. You begin to feel the heat just watching them.

The sound is bad and in some places it's almost impossible to make out what the characters are saying, but none of it is anything that interrupts the story.

There's some excuse given toward the end that the proximity of Cape Canaveral may be to blame, since the rockets use atomic energy in take-off. I like how, when exposed to radiation, the animals don't just grow to enormous size, but they also grow legs and arms.

I had a lot of fun with ATTACK OF THE GIANT LEECHES. It's short (62 minutes) and entertaining without being preachy. The only message this movie wants to convey is ""There are giant leeches in the swamp, and they're going to drain your blood.""

This movie didn't gain the respect similar films like CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON did, and rightfully so, but it's still an enjoyable, goofy way to spend an afternoon. And at that length, you can easily make it a double-feature and not feel like you've lost too much of the day in front of the television.

935068,4,6304818262,"I have always been a fan of 'Attack of the Giant Leeches' with the (sadly departed) Yvette Vickers and two very unbelievable giant leeches.  It's cheap and tacky-looking, but never tacky.  It has a great script and some clever use of a non-existent budget. -- I recently discovered that this movie had originally been released as a double-bill with 'Bucket of Blood', starring Dick Miller (Joe Dante's go-to character actor), about a poor schlep who works at a coffee house where all the cool people hang out and read their poetry (ala late 1950s, early 1960).  He soon discovers that his sculptures make him the toast of the beat generation.  But if those crazy beats only new what went into Dick Miller's sculptures, heh heh heh. -- Now you can get both movies on one disc and pretend you're at a drive-in theater in 1959. -- This double feature is truly a ton of fun.  You have your monster feature with 'Attack of the Giant Leeches', where giant leeches are running amok in an everglade town.  Yvette Vickers is the gorgeous (and nasty) wife of the local general store owner and she's having an affair with the local guy who has the most muscles.  Soon the leeches put in an appearance and dynamite makes an appearance later on.  Lots of fun. -- The really nice surprise is 'Bucket.'  Roger Corman, himself, directed it (I would assume in 4 days with a budget of 800 dollars), and it has its toungue very much in its cheek.  And the movie really is funny.  The subject may be kind of gruesome -- man makes sculptures as people keep disappearing -- but it is done in a clever way and shows genuine wit.  Dick Miller -- who seems to have been born at the age of 39 -- puts in a great performance, as does everyone.  The stand out is Barboura Morris, a real beauty with deep-set eyes, who plays the coffee-house owner and champion of Dick Miller, even before he becomes a celebrity with his sculptures.  This really is one fun double feature.

A swamp hunter comes back from the swamp with the tale of a strange creature that took four slugs from his mighty gun to dispatch. However he brings back no proof. That night wayward wife Liz (Yvette Vickers) just happens to be wandering around in the swamp when she spots is very same hunter that appears to have been leehcie- aided. Even though the Hunter really never touched a wayward wife the local authorities don't believe in giant leeches so they attributed his death to misadventure. It is not until several other people seem to be disappearing under the same mysterious circumstances that the authorities are finally starting to get curious.

Fat slob Dave (Bruno VeSota) catches his wife Liz on the very edge of the swamp fooling around with his best friend Cal (Michael Emmet). So Dave scares them off into the swamp with a shotgun. And you guessed it. They too become leehcie- aided.

Against the advice of the local game warden (Ken Clark) the local Doc Greyson (Tyler McVey) decides to use dynamite to sort this out. What will he find?

Mean time through the whole movie Liz Walker (Yvette Vickers) keeps hanging around near the leeches and you just know she needs to be eaten or at least sucked.

The story is an amalgamation of every 1950s movie cliche you can imagine. Sultry Liz (Yvette Vickers) is a swamp siren and stepping out on unattractive hubby Dave (Bruno VeSoto), roaming the night and stumbling upon a dead poacher covered with hickeys from hell.  Does this give her pause?  Of course not, and when hubby catches Liz and her latest flame he drives them into the swap with a shotgun to teach them a lesson.  It's only to scare them, and boy is he sure surprised when a couple of guys rise up out of the water wearing black plastic.  When they carry off Liz and her beau, game warden Steve (Ken Clark) gets seriously involved, and pretty soon everybody in the swamp is worried, upset, and even downright concerned.

Vickers was a memorable beauty and the film shows her assets to good advantage; Ken Clark was a hairy-chested stud and the movie shows his skin as well.  The rest of the cast is merely adequate at best, but they are fun, and the script is classically silly.  Everybody drinks coffee.  A lot of coffee.  Everybody gasps in dismay.  A lot of dismay.  The men are butch and the women are femme.  And the leeches... well, when you get a good look at them, they're pretty silly looking, but even so the movie does manage a shock or two, what with victims writhing in the leeches' lair and open-eyed corpses floating in the water.

If you're into ""B"" horror movies from the 1950s, ATTACK OF THE GIANT LEECHES is right up there with ATTACK OF THE FIFTY FOOT WOMAN (which also featured Vickers), a popcorn classic of its kind.  Recommended for those who enjoy the genre.

For those that haven't seen these movies, if you like 1950s B movies with weird monsters and cult stories, I highly recommend this DVD - not just for the films but the transfers.
Attack of the Giant Leeches has Yvette Vickers, Bruno Ve Sota and a cast of Roger Corman regulars in swamp land getting the blood sucked from over-sized leeches. A very minor love triangle is thrown in and Yvette looks hot here. This movie is also one of the MST3K experiments, and it is a good pick, but I can watch this with or without the MST treatment. Its a harmless one hour cheesy movie that is entertaining.
A Bucket of Blood has the legendary Dick Miller as a man who kills people and makes 'art' out of them - sculptures basically.

935188,3,6304818262,"I am as unoriginal as the other reviewers of this movie.  Playboy Playmate Yvette Vickers (July 1959) is certainly one reason to watch this movie.  Actually, I watched the movie for the articles.  Oh, wait.  This is a movie, not a magazine.  Forget what I just said.  Yvette was certainly a lovely young lady in this movie (she is older than my mother, meaning she is a grandmother now), but the star attraction is the rubbery-looking leeches that look about as menacing as Barney the Dinosaur.  Well, Barney may be more threatening.  Anyway, the leeches are a lot of fun and this movie has some moments of genuine tension.

Our story takes place in a swamp (where else would you find giant leeches?).  There is a subplot involving a good-looking babe (Vickers) and her boyfriend and her hulkish husband.  Forget all that nonsense and fast forward to the leeches practically leaping out of the water to capture the people who foolishly go into the water.  Okay, maybe the leeches did not exactly LEAP, but they did float in a sinister fashion, slowly, I might add, and then pulled their victims under to be stored in a cave for leisurely blood sucking.

Nearly everyone else in this movie is clueless as to what is happening until almost the final minutes of the movie, when it suddenly becomes evident that GIANT LEECHES HAVE KIDNAPPED A BUNCH OF PEOPLE AND ARE SUCKING THEIR BLOOD OUT IN A CAVE.  Had these people only read the title of the movie they might have had a clue earlier.

This movie could be another Roger Corman film that has so much schlock that it begs to be put out of its misery.  However, with the exception of the lust...er...love story, this movie is played like a straight horror movie and turns out to be reasonably enjoyable.  Yes, the leeches are a bit humorous when you first see them.  Yes, you wonder how anything that moves as slow as these leeches could capture anyone.  Yes, the radiation turning the leeches into giant killer monsters is incredibly clich&eacute;.  Yet, this movie is a better than average mutated creature film.

I enjoyed watching this thing in the 1960's and being at the edge of my seat (I was very young then).  Though my perspective has changed a lot in several decades, I still found this movie occasionally humorous, tense for a few moments, and short enough to be eminently worthy of watching once again.  Yes, you have to like campy horror and science fiction movies from the late 50's and early 60's to like this movie, but if you do you have found a good addition to your collection.

'Attack of the Giant Leeches' is all about the very sexy, kittenish Yvette Vickers in the role of the town tramp Liz Walker. Yvette undoubtedly got the part based on her recent popularity as the July '59 ""Playmate of the Month"" and all the males out there who were in their adolescence back in the late fifties certainly appreciated her inclusion in the film. She certainly made it watchable for me.

Make no mistake, you're watching this movie for one reason and one reason only. Thanks for the memories Miss Vickers!

So goes Attack of the Giant Leeches. Underwater monsters that kill without warning from the swampy deep. Apparantly they have an underwater cavern under the swamp where they take their victims to feed on them later. The leeches themselves are a marvel of 1950's technology. They look more like starfish than leeches. Actually they look like men wearing large, unformed rubber suits. Our hero ends up blowing the swamp with dynamite. Of course he doesn't want to, he's an environmentalist (they had those in the 50's). Before he blows the swamp to hell though, he must show his physique and skin dive for a good ten minutes, giving female viewers a thrill. But to no avail, fighting leeches with spearguns is futile.

Now lets get to why anyone would really watch this movie...drum roll please......Yvette Vickers. Oh she is hotter than a firecracker this one. Beautiful legs, face, and a killer bod that she doesn't mind showing off at all. She's Betty Page and Mamie Van Doren rolled up into one. Look how beautiful as she runs through the swamp.

935194,4,6304818262,"The key thing to know about ""A Bucket of Blood,"" the first of this double feature DVD is that Roger Corman made it a year before he did ""Little Shop of Horror."" Both movies starred Dick Miller, both were made in less than a week on shoestring budgets (five days for $30,000), and both films constitute horror-comedy, although ""Little Shop"" is decidedly more over the top. But do not be surprised if you like this 1959 Corman film better.

The horror element is actually in vogue again with the release of a new version of ""House of Wax"" this week, since Miller plays Walter Paisley, a bus boy at The Yellow Door, an art house care that is the place to go for the Beat Generation. Paisley is a would-be-sculptor wants to be accepted by all of the cool cats, but he does not really have any talent. Then he accidentally kills his cat and when he covers it with clay he is suddenly proclaimed as having a ""talent"" for lifelike artwork. Another accident, of a sort, gives him the opportunity to move on to human figures, at which point Walter starts looking for new subjects. The ending strikes you as being something out of ""The Twilight Zone,"" but up to that point it works for the most part because of the performances by Miller, Barboura Morris as Carla, and most of the supporting roles.

The comedy part comes not from the killing and sculpting but from the movie's send up of the beatnik scene. The cafe is filled with Beat poets and folk singers. Part of the reason it works is that what is happening at the cafe is not really parody, but earnest attempts in the accepted Beat style. The babble coming out of the mouth of Maxwell (Julian Burton) has the appropriate sense of pseudo-profundity and the guy walking around playing the guitar and singing is Alex Hassilev, who was about to help form the Limeliters. This movie was remade in 1995 as one of the cable television movies presented under the umbrella title ""Roger Corman Presents,"" but that was not half the movie the original black & white, quick & dirty film is as far as I am concerned.

""Attack of the Giant Gila Monster"" is one of those films where you take a real animal and having it crawl through miniature sets. The tagline for this film was: ""Only Hell could breed such an enormous beast. Only God could destroy it!"" But this 1959 film from director Ray Kellogg (""The Killer Shrews,"" ""The Green Berets""--how is that for a credit combo?), filmed in north Texas for $138,000, is a lot more low-keyed than those lines would suggest. In fact, what is interesting given when this film is made is the key relationship between Sheriff Jeff (Fred Graham) and young Chase Winstead (Don Sullivan). The kid is working on his hot rod and instead of busting his chops the sheriff really functions as a mentor: he says he is concerned about the kids in town, and you actually believe it. The idea of having a movie in which a teenage hot rodder, who also sings like Pat Boone who is not a juvenile delinquent, or at least treated like one by the cops, is rather refreshing, although admittedly the character is a bit heavy on the saccharine. But Sullivan has a natural charm and the guy wrote his own songs, so give him some credit.

But since we are talking letting a Gila monster wander through miniatures in a film with teenage hot rodders, of course this movie received ""MST3K"" treatment (Season 4, when Joel turned Crow and Servo into ""The Thing With Two Heads"" as inspired by the movie of the same name""). My major complaint about this film is that the day for night shooting is so dark I have a hard time figuring out what is happening. Obviously the special effects budget is such that most of the ""horror"" is suggested by quick cuts rather than actually showing everything. Still, I like the way that everybody is pretty level headed in this film and deal with the giant Gila monster in a relatively intelligent manner without wasting a lot of time and effort. Yes, finding the monster, which is the size of several houses, should not take so long, but then the movie would be shorter and it is only 74 minutes anyway.",1122076800,,4085,4.5162162162162165
