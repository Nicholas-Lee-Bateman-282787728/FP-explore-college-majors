7886809,2,6305279853,"This review is for ""The Scorpio Factor"" released by Digital Versatile Disc Ltd.
Since this was a made for TV movie of no great achievement I was not expecting a great deal with the release. The transfer is sub-par for DVD but watchable. The audio is nothing to write home about but not so bad you can't hear words etc.  This is a bare bones release, no chapters, no subtitles etc. I would have given it a 3 star rating except for the price tag of $9-10. It is currently reduced to $5-6 which is still overpriced. I got mine for $1 second hand which is what I suggest any buyers do.
I give it 2 stars.",1424390400,,600,4.128205128205129
