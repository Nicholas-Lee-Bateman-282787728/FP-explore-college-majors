4286010,5,B0048EAYQE,"i gave this a 5 star based just on the show, not about the price.

the back of the box says it all

the good news - he just got into the pants of the hottest girl in school

the bad news - HE is the hottest girl in shool, and there are other girls out there who want to take her out.  he is SO not going to like being a girl

Natsuru is surprised when Kaede, the girl he loves, gives him a stuffed tiger from the Bowel Familiar series and the next morning finds out he is now a girl and wearing a blue bracelet, and then the Tiger talks telling him he is chosen to fight as a female warrior known as a Kampfer fighting in a secret war run by a group called the Moderators.  The next day as a guy he runs into Kaede, but then the bracelet glows turning him back into a girl.  He runs into a red haired girl wielding a large automatic pistol, who tries to kill him he protects Kaede using Zauber (magic projectile), but he also saves the mysterious girl from a street lamp falling on her, and when she see he has a blue bracelet she calls it off.  At school (which is co-ed but the guys go to one side, the girls to the other) a young lady named Akane meets him in the library.  she is also a Kampfer (the one with the gun) and explains there are three types of Kampfers, gunners, swordsmen, and Zauber (actually they use the german words for guns and sword.  Then the big surprise is when he finds out that the girl he loves, bats on the other side of the plate and actually prefers the girl Natsuru (big crush to his heart).  Amd when the student body president is found out to also be a Kampfer, one wearing a red bracelet and supposed to be their enemy, takes in interest his world gets turned upside down.  He is enrolled in both sides of the school, and there is a rumor that he is dating himself, not to mention he is still getting used to the fact he now has a very large chest and different plumbing.  But when a new group comes onto the scene, can the Reds and Blues join forces to combat this new threat, and who is behind them.

Overall it is a good series. The physical battles are few, but quick paced, as this is like harem comedies like Tenchi or Dual.  The battles are more towards the feelings of the girls (including Natsuru) as the girls try to get the attention of the thick headed hero (and heroine in Kaede's case).  It is mild to moderate Ecchi as while there is a good level of fan service, it does follow a tv-14 rating with steam or towels or other body parts blocking the naughty bits (especially during the pool resort/bathouse episodes).  the only down side is the price, i got it when it first came out so i got it cheaper than it is now  but if they were broken down into 3 disks, the collection is cheaper (would be 20/disc so 45 compared to 60) .  but it is a good series and how it ended gives a large opening and a lot of questions to still be answered.  and there is a second season coming down the pipe i will keep an eye out for it.  later",1297555200,23,2976,4.044368600682594
4286011,5,B0048EAYQE,"First of all, I must say this anime was one of the first that I have seen that left a lasting impression, and also one of the first I saw. It is a action-comedy that has a good amount of romance thrown in so if your not one for such then it might not be for you. That aside if you haven't seen it DO! and if you don't have it GET IT!! I loved it so much I had to have it, unfortunatly this site wouldn't have it so I literally scouted the web to get it. Getting off topic.

THE STORY: The main charactetr (Natsuru) one day wakes up from to find that he has suddenly been transformed into a girl. While freaking out a plushi tiger (who he got from some girl he likes) gets up and tells him that he is a KAMPFER. These beings are made to fight other KAMPFERS, WHY? dunno never really explains. So at one point he comes into contact with other KAMPFERS, unlike him who goes from boy to girl, they are all girls (becomes sort of a harem). Love eventually arises from these fueds and they all become friends and fight other KAMPFERS and have good times etc.

Fast action, extremely funny moments, sad moments, suspense and drama, and of coarse romance (4 girls going after one guy, one girl is actually going after the female him, LESBO). Anyways the price on this is worth it, if you like anime this is one you should at least check out online or something.",1294444800,9,1353,4.1603053435114505

4286013,4,B0048EAYQE,"For the most part, harem anime is a pretty predictable genre. Dorky guy, way too many girls who are way out of his league, some random occurrence that suddenly makes him appealing to these girls to the point that they lose all sense of themselves, everything ties up at the end with a silly multi-episode ending that 1.) doesn't actually end the series and 2.) doesn't actually tell you who the guy will choose even though its a forgone conclusion (it was the first girl he met in episode 1). Kampfer, while checking the boxes on most of these tropes, kept me watching because, for the first time that I could remember, the girl he picks wasn't a forgone conclusion! At the end of the series, you can't honestly tell what will happen. While this may be easily remedied by reading the manga, I found it refreshing to watch a trope-y anime and not actually know what was going to happen.",1453248000,,885,4.503105590062112

4286015,5,B0048EAYQE,A great series not a one of a kind nor is it the first time it has been done the only factor that their is to complain about would be that the last episode was not really related to the story line and was more like a joke and it did not have the most satisfactory ending not really an ending at all.,1441238400,,299,3.761904761904762

4286017,5,B0048EAYQE,"This is a great story base Anime with loads and loads of fan service as they call it. Lots of girl on girl action, of coarse that cant be helped they have to fight each other in this series. This anime series is well worth the price for the bluray version I just wish they had English dubbing also, don't get me wrong the Japanese with sub is great. But I am more of a dub watcher cause I tend to multi task a lot and miss some of the action.

The story is about a guy, who gets stuck in a fight I forget what its complete about but like a school competition basically. But it gets better, woah the guy who gets stuck in this competition turns into a girl against his will and tries everything to not have to. Great comedy in this one, So what happens to the young man forced to be in the fights. Does he manage to make his life work out as a girl. Even better someone spreads the roomer that His female persona is dating him his guy self. I'd have to watch the full season to get more in depth with the story but I don't want to spoil it.

If you like or don't mind such fan service type anime, and love comedy driven drama series with lots of action. You'll probably like this series. The part of a guy being turned into a girl and trying to make his way thru life as both just makes the comedy better. Also there is a lot of this Love triangle thing going on for him.

Even if this series didn't have all the fan service it would be a great series to watch, just cause of all the drama, comedy, and problems he has to face going thru life trying to be his boy self, but getting thrust head first into the female side of his school, as a new student, very popular, and pretty... LOL

This bluray set has all the episodes + 2 OVAs combined. Making it best value, I believe when I purchased this the dvds + ova both separate about the same price if you bought them both. But this bluray set has way better graphic quality and audio.",1430524800,2,1932,4.0365535248041775
4286018,2,B0048EAYQE,"You can read about the ""plot"" either from the other reviewers or from some other source. I myself found this anime incredibly disappointing, as I bought it hoping that the story would go somewhere when it never actually did. The whole plot consists of a red vs blue team that is made up of four people overall, with only one or two fights between them. After their brief fight scenes, it turns into a generic harem anime until the last two episodes where the story goes nowhere and nothing is really resolved.

The only reason why I even bother to give it two stars as opposed to one star is the fact that the supporting characters are pretty funny. The main hero/heroine is just here for no other reason than ""oh look, the other girls could be lesbian/straight depending on the situation.""

If you want to know some other specifics about the anime...
If you are coming into this anime hoping to find a watchable story, then just move along. There's only a bit of story that the anime throws out rather quickly after the first few episodes in favor of a different plot (if you can call it that) in the last four episodes. I personally was hoping that the super soldier fights would have taken priority over everything else, but alas it was not to be.

If you're coming into this anime hoping for fan-service, you'll more than likely be disappointed. The fan-service includes  a few fight scenes (where clothes are the only things really hurt), girl on girl kissing, a few undressing scenes, and of course the infamous steam covered nude scenes. The anime appears to ride the line between being a serious anime and being a fan-service filled harem, but in the end comes out as being the weak sauce of both sides.",1430438400,,1711,4.563517915309446

I wish they would have taken the time to watch how the boy learns about how to dress as a girl, and how to do the simple things like going to the bathroom. It could have made this one funnier than it was. This is one that depends on the sex changing all of the time an that makes it really fun to watch.

4286026,4,B0048EAYQE,"A few well placed patches of fog prevents outright nudity.  This along with some fan service makes this series not suitable for children.  Recommended 17+.

After reading the product description (back of the DVD) you'd expect this to be a wild show with the focus being girls running around scantily clad the entire time.  It's not.  It is a typical harem situation with the added twist that the main male character changes into a girl to do battle with other girls.  While this plot line has been done many time before, the execution of this series is great.  The animation is high quality, and while there is no English Dub, they Japanese cast is amazing.  The main characters are voiced by a few well known people who do a great job.  The girls are not only cute, but you become generally interested in their lives and drawn into the show.

There is a mild plot twist at the end that keeps things a little more interesting.  Each main character also has a stuffed animal mascot that adds to the comedic value.  I can't give this a 5 as the concept and material have been done before by various series and the season ends without a resolution.  I hear there is a season 2 and season 3 currently available though.  A solid and entertaining 4.",1403049600,,1243,4.491071428571429
4286027,4,B0048EAYQE,Story is about a boy who has a what I would guess is an encounter with UFO and is able to change between male and female.  Found the OVA really cute.  Series was fun to watch and funny.,1394841600,,185,3.8421052631578947
4286028,4,B0048EAYQE,"The idea of a guy being turned into a girl was not introduced with this anime.  That plot twist has been around for nearly 20 years in one form or another, and has been used for both dramatic and comedic effect.  Kampfer definitely plays more to the comedic side as the poor main character is another soft hearted and passive harem hero who can't stand up to anything at first.

The series does have its problems.  Like just about every harem anime out there it seems 80%+ of the humor requires that the ""hero"" be unable to tell any girl how he really feels.  Misinterpreted gestures and statements are constant and sometimes require that the watcher accept that these characters just aren't very intelligent.

Even with that the artwork is solid and the characters are fun and interesting even while they are acting in annoyingly mindless ways.  Kampfer is no classic, but if you love the genre it's a decent series.",1388016000,,917,4.658385093167702

4286030,5,B0048EAYQE,"I am a anime fan girl and I love gender benders like this anime. It was really good and a lot of fun to watch. It was actually really funny. It is Ecchi which I will admit I am not all that into as they usually go over board with the in your face sexy stuff. This didn't do that, this was a very nicely done Ecchi. I do feel that it kind of ended with out actually finishing the story and I would have liked to see it continue. Oh and the 12th episode is not really part of the story. It is just kind of a special episode that is added to the series. Some people I think actually called that episode pointless and for it not being part of the story I can not disagree but you can still watch it as you might enjoy it.

Oh and this is most defiantly not for kids. As I said it is Ecchi.",1374278400,,785,3.7865853658536586

4286032,5,B0048EAYQE,"I have often heard of Anime like Tenchi where you have several women interested in one man as being called a harem Anime.  This series is an a harem anime with the twist of the guy in question changing into a girl.

A mysterious unknown group has stopped their own suffering of war by choosing champions on other worlds known as Kampfers who happen to have to be women. Natsauru is chosen he finds he turns into a woman when his blue Kampfer powers activates during danger around a red Kampfer.  Natsauru is more different from other Kampfers than just being male part of the time. He has a way of making the other Kampfers fall in love with boy his male self and female self calling a truce between the blues and the red. That doesn't end the fighting or the fun as the girls fight for Natsuaru's attention and a group of white Kampfers being created to deal with their truce.",1370822400,,877,4.368098159509202

4286034,2,B0048EAYQE,The disc is Japanese only and they cut out some seances in the couple first episodes. So I was disappointed.,1363651200,,108,4.45
4286035,2,B0048EAYQE,"I was really excited when I heard that there was an anime where the main guy ended up with special powers that turned him into a girl while everyone around him either had their appearance or personality change to match the battle. I liked the idea of being a girl and having to live with it more times than not. I was loving the idea that the girl of his dreams was a lesbian and interested in his other gender bender.

The anime fails to execute what could have been a good series and here's why.

Natsuru is such an unlikable protagonists. He's one of the dumbest protagonists of all times up there with Makoto from School Days (but Makoto is at the top because he's a scumbag to boot) and Saito from The Familiar Zero. The novel does a good reason explaining why he's so dumb (and it's a spoiler) but the anime does not elaborate and makes him the stupidest guy on the planet. He has all the girls fighting for him and declaring his love and he can only think of staring at the moon thinking how beautiful it is...what?! To make matters worse, Natsuru is only there for being the eye candy of everyone in gender bender form. He cannot fight and while at the beginning of the anime, he's shown wanting to fight and help his comrades out the anime later makes him so incompetent to make him the damsel in distress only in female form and used purely for fanservice reasons. Why give him a gender bender with fire powers at all if he's just going to be used for breast close ups and panty shots and fanservice?

His other allies are either missed opportunities or badly written (in the anime anyway). His partner Akane is notorious for being a borderline complete monster that is ready to kill anyone in her way regardless if they have anything to do with the battle of Kampfer or not. She's written as a villain and it's nearly forgotten as the anime goes on and just makes her a tsundere. This is simply bad writing on the anime's part. Next is Sango is the only character done right but again the anime fails to elaborate on her backstory and is only brought up in the last episode just to cause shock value and make you hate the villain more (not like you hate her from the start given how obnoxious she is before the reveal). Mikoto, Natsuru's childhood friend is just there to give Sango a partner in the game and she's not even a threat in the harem given how Natsuru tends to dismiss her the majority of the series. Her battle form is very unique but she only turns into it a few times.

Finally Kaede. She is one of the worse characters in the series with Natsuru. Not only does she have nothing interested about her except being a psycho lesbian obsessed with getting laid with Natsuru (and this is exaggerated as the anime goes on to the point where it's not even cute or funny anymore and is just plain stalkerish). After all, she fell for female Natsuru because in female form, she was rescued by psycho Akane). And what they do with her character near the end does not save her anyway because it comes out of nowhere.

The anime only seems to focus on the fanservice, yuri moments and more fanservice instead of the action. The summary clearly makes it seem like it would be an action harem series but it just ends up being a fanservice disguised as an action to pull you in. We get a few fights that don't even last the whole episode and the fights in later episodes are rushed to fit in as much of shock value as possible. It's a shame because Natsuru and Akane's fight with Sango was amazing. And the worse thing is that the fights aren't really explained well in the anime and why the girls are fighting against each other in the first place. It just seems there to cause conflict which could easily be a romantic comedy.

Which leads to one last thing. Many characters that had important roles in the novel were cut out. Midori is a character in the novel that is part of the red team and is Sango's real partner but they cut her out and mention her twice and then she's never heard from again. She was a major character for Palutena's sake and they left her out for inconvenience.

Overall, I found this anime to be very poor and when they announce an OVA, it doesn't do justice because it's more fanservice and no action. The only reason I'm not giving this anime a 1 star is because I LOVE the artwork and I love the concept originally before it was executed incorrectly and finally the action scenes that were in the anime made it very cool. So 2 stars out of 5. -sigh- If only there wasn't that much fanservice it would be much higher rating, but there are better animes out there.",1361491200,4,4605,4.347674418604651

So when he needs to fight he turns into a girl. Not that he was ever very masculine to begin with. To add to his troubles, Sakura, the girl he loves develops feelings for the girl version of him. His partner, Akane, is in love with him as a guy. This sounds like a troubling situation, but Senou's life get even more complicated. You'll need to watch to find out the details.

I really liked this anime. It has great characters, a funny story, excellent animation, a good soundtrack, tons of action, drama, and romance. It's pretty loaded in the entertainment department. It has some heavy yuri stuff in it. Beware of that; I know lots of people don't like yuri. There is some nudity, but it's not very detailed. I think that stuff just makes it funnier. You're probably wondering why I give it 4 stars with all of that going for it. The answer is simple.

I have 2 issues with this anime. I really don't like the main character. Senou is probably the least appealing hero I've seen in an anime in a long time. He's a total wuss. He doesn't have much personality either. Fortunately, the other characters are awesome. They make up for the boring vibe he puts off. My 2nd complaint with this anime is that it's not English dubbed. The Japanese cast is really good, but I hate reading subtitles. I watch anime to kick back and relax. I can't relax if I have to constantly focus on reading subtitles. You can't turn your head away for more than a few seconds or you'll lose some of the story. I know that not everyone feels that way, but if you do, be warned that it's not in English.

Setting my 2 not so huge complaints aside, I enjoyed the heck out of Kampfer. If you don't mind reading subtitles you should probably find it very entertaining. It's not one of the better anime series out there, but it's lots of fun all the same. I highly recommend it.",1359331200,,2023,4.360742705570292

Well the story was nicely done and I was a little shocked at who the real bad girl was. Well that's about it. There's 2 discs which comes in a recyclable like case which didn't bother me none.

4286040,5,B0048EAYQE,"At first this seems to be a typical fantasy-action Japanese cartoon (anime), but it turns out to be mostly comedy! I enjoyed it quite a lot, however I must mention some issues. Their constant Japanese celebrities name-dropping will annoy anybody not familiar with anime, let alone the fact that the series is only spoken in Japanese. Well, the constant name dropping is part of the comedy, but it's meaningless to translate. This is a product mostly for long time anime fans or ""otaku"" to the point that they actually enjoy listening the shows in their original language (like me). The producers must have guessed it was not worth to pay American-voice actors for such reduced public and left it alone, good choice I think.

  Besides comedy, it has a bit of sex. The Japanese like to mix comedy and sex, but Americans do not so much (must be the puritan thing), too bad. Moreover, some others will have a problem with a central character (Natsuru) who is not the typical arrogant, stupid, macho, trouble-maker stereotype that both Hollywood and the much of American public revere. Natsuru is the Japanese stereotype instead, humble but with clear standards. The contrast with the American type is so sharp that many reviewers (possible otakus included) failed to understand him and even stated false comment about him, like saying he only follows orders without thinking. For once, he objected to the fights in the show, the first time that I see a character doing such a thing in any show ever. They always automatically go for the fight, not him.

It looks like you'll need to be a fan of Japanese culture beyond sushi and their typical sci-fi series in order to enjoy Kampfer. If you are, you'll love it.",1349740800,,1708,4.779661016949152

4286042,3,B0048EAYQE,"Saw the series -- I thought it was pretty funny . For my thoughts on the show - its to bad the main charector is not so bright- or maby so unwilling to see  the other girls as a possible  relationship but that would have changed the story line. Expect  nudity and strong desires to be near Natsue when he turns into a woman.
Natsue  changes from an ordinary  dense guy to  the hottest physical  looking woman in the school maby the state, ha, when he turns into a kempfer
Like others  have realized, its to bad the series ended so short they were supposed to make more episodes past the 12  so that the story  would be completed and they'd fight the moderators  or the red and blue would fight each other- though with everyone liking natsuru  in his hot woman body joining forces all the way to the end is to be expected. oh you get to see up to episode 14... though the last episode and other  episode  are just odd ""funny scripts""
 A high school guy is forced to be in a fight between the red and blue kempers..  they all where bracelets  that  are used to transform them into kempers when near  other kempers...  For the sake of fan service they concentrate on womans body appeal and  they don't always fight each other. In fact so many days  go by that the moderaters appear to try to force them into action. Could be a worthwhile show if the story gets more episodes. I signed a petition to get the creaters to continue making the anime and to finish the story.

4286046,2,B0048EAYQE,"Kampfer combines fast comedy with gender-bending, magical girls, and action/fan service-- that said, the premise is simple to understand, so there is no need for lengthy exposition. Several well-known voice actors are in the mix, and are part of the show's gag stuffed animals-- they are described in the original light novels as having voices ""similar to Yukari Tamura/Nana Mizuki/etc."", and there are several inside jokes that reference the actors' previous works.

The problem I had with the show was that despite its light-hearted intent, the show has serious moments that break up the pace a little too much. At times I would forget that I shouldn't take the show seriously, which was bad considering the next gag would pull the rug out from underneath me. Another weakness is that the plot would say ""this is how it is"" (particularly towards the end) despite the fact that (a) this is rather poor storytelling even for a comedy, and (b) it was about as convincing to me as it was to the other characters-- as in, not at all. Maybe the story was squeezed to fit 9-11 episodes, maybe the story was only supposed to seem serious intentionally, but either way, it didn't work for me, and seeing the hilarious ""back-breaking"" ending animation killed any drama the story suggested.

Be warned, also, that the anime does not tie up any loose ends at all-- not even in the 2-episode special aired this year-- so if that doesn't feel satisfying (and I personally detest productions that can't find a way to end the story), you can find better harem/ecchi works elsewhere. Some reviewers mentioned Tenchi Muyo, but others include Love Hina, Ranma, and Negima; these don't technically end the story either, but the plots are stronger, and they don't leave the viewer with the impression that there's going to be another season to make up for the lackluster finish on the first.

Also, this release only has subtitles, so fans of dubs may have to wait until Sentai decides to make an English track.",1316217600,12,1992,4.818713450292398
4286047,2,B0048EAYQE,"I love the short 13 episode series format - but was disappointed with how they can have a short series here, and STILL waste a lot of time with weak filler material. This could have been an interesting show that could have resolved nicely in 13 episodes. Instead we get filler material like beauty contest episodes & the like. The main character is basically a brain dead wimp throughout the series, just going with whatever stupid thing happens to him, never questioning anything. I mean seriously, he transforms into a woman, and just accpets it all, never even trieds to investigate what is going on here. By the time they get back to any plot or action, it is too late to develop it into anything interesting - because they used up too much time with a bunch of episodes on really dumb stuff. This show has a lot of fan service, and I have no complaints about fan service in anime if there is something interesting going on besides that. But when it is filler due to unsinspired writing, it seems to me they are hoping fan serevice alone will keep people watching. Sorry, but that isn't enough to keep my interest. I am not 15 anymore.",1312848000,,1139,4.480769230769231

4286049,3,B0048EAYQE,"Kampfer: is an excelent anime very funny but, I don't like the fact that i have to read the subtitles it's very dificult to keep up with the words & understand what's going on throughout the series, Like other anime's they have english & other languages which most of us understand for instance my children watch the anime's in english memorized it & listened to the japanese version & understood it were actually mimicking the language which was a good thing because I've always wanted them to learn another language besides english and spanish but i'll tell you one thing though it's better to entertain my kids with the english version & then switch to japanese & they will understand what they are saying it's like having a japanese english dictionary that kids like to wach, i just think that all anime should have those languages to choose from. And also the ones right now with only japanese languages if they were to add english to there movie as well i would purchese them in a heart beat for instance Princess Resurection 1&2, Samurai harem,Indian Summer & he is my master along with others like these only in japanese language wer to be redon with english aswell i wood be the first to get them thank you.",1301356800,,1216,4.608294930875576
4286050,2,B0048EAYQE,"Would rate it 5, but the price killed it.

Just wanted to write this real quick. Its one of my favs and Ive watched my bootleg version over and over again. However, this price is rediculous. Until the price goes down, plz, for ur own good, do not pay 50$ for this. However, when the price does lower, it is a very good series to have. Ending is horrible, however, because season 2 is comming out, it kinda makes sense.

Im waiting for the price to lower before I buy my R1 release. Again, DO NOT BUY THIS AS LONG AS ITS AROUND 40-50$. ITS A RIPOFF RETARDED PRICE!!!!",1299715200,,566,4.18348623853211
4286051,3,B0048EAYQE,"I love 13 episode anime.  I'll take a nice, concise 13 episode series that gets through the plot and hits all the right notes over any 26 or god forbid a long winded 52 ep series.

That said, I'm getting upset by 13 episode series that get through... half or less of the plot. Lots and lots of series have done this as of late, and there's nothing worse than getting into a series and having no ending of any sort.  Not even a vague one, some times it's as bad as there literally should be an episode after this one, but there's not, or a slight leaving off point that's an alright place to stop but without an conclusions.  Some series pick back up with a another season, which is nice, but not all of them are so lucky. DearS, Samurai Girls, Sekirei, Maria-Holic, and tons of other ones have been structured like this as of a late. Some like Sekirei get their second season (although now it needs a third season...) and others like DearS just die in the water (which is a shame because it was very fun).  Aside from teasing your audience, the pause in production schedules means the feeling is, at best, a bit off in the beginning of the second season. and depending on circumstance, different assets might not return.  Writers, director, composers, and worst of all animation studios can change in that interim.

That long exposition brings me to perhaps my only qualm at this point with Kampfer:  It literally stops in the middle of the show.  There's a battle, of sorts, but despite its assertions to the contrary, not very much about the show, to this point, has been about the battles.  The idea is that certain people are picked to be Kampfers, and they fight each other, and the results of those proxy battles determine a war in some other galaxy. But early in the show everyone stops fighting.  they start paling around.  It turns into a very interesting harem show, actually.

In fact, it turns into one of the less investigated and more interesting shows in the harem genre, that being the gender-bended harem.  You see, the protagonist is a man that's been picked to be a kampfer and since a kampfer has to be a woman, when he transformed he transforms into a... she.  this is sort of unique because all the other kampfer's in the show are already women when they are selected, so their transformations range from merely cosmetic to entire personalities, but they have the same bits and piece they started with, as it were.  Another flaw with the series cutting off so soon is that we have no idea why the people are picked, much less why specifically the male protagonist.  Anyway, back to the point, he's a girl and a boy, and he has girls falling in love with both sides of him, some knowing he has a male side others not. It's very ranma 1/2 except that this show manages to move along some of those romance thread in the brief time it has unlike that show. It's very interesting, and the way the romantic partners are developed is really well done.  Overall, the series has very well written characters.  Even the classic trope of the protagonist liking one girl who doesn't like him when there are literally other girls willing to screw him is addressed ""Why do you like her?""  ""why do I like her?  Does there have to be a reason  You like who you like.""

The fighting and the plot begins to move towards the end of the show, but is ultimately left unresolved.  Even though we get a battle that is won and we are all happy yaaaay, it's not thematically a good point to leave off on.  Until this point, the show has primarily rotated around the characters relationships, and without taking that into account in ending (or pausing it), we are left without much reason to not simply hope for a second season, or wish we hadn't watched the first.

Since much of it is Dependant on whether there is a second season, in anticipation of that I give it a B+, or assuming it DOESN'T get one, a C, based on a lack of any resolution.",1298332800,,3941,4.438888888888889

8418654,5,B0048EAYQE,"- Synopsis: A story that involves gender-bending. Mysteriously, the main character one day ends up as a female. The only problem is that he was male to begin with. This anime showcases his/her struggles to play his part as both genders due to various circumstances, all the while trying to find out the mastermind that created these awkward events to begin with; all with the help of his/her friends he/she meets along the way.

===========================================================================================================

- Comments: Our main character becomes part of the ""game"" that entices other different colored bracelet owners to fight each other. Some are simple-minded and would love to test out their powers, while others do not appreciate becoming like puppets.
The main character also ends up being teased due to his unique circumstances. Often, it is very awkward for him when confronted with various situations, like using the women's restroom; understandably so. Moreover, the cast is fairly diverse and likable.

- Analysis: An interesting addressed concept is to exercise caution as you may be manipulated without even knowing it. Such as being spoon-fed information from social media and the news. Essentially, there are times when being cynical is extremely recommended. Furthermore, the enemies in front of a person might not actually be one's true enemies. Some of the smarter villains in animes tend to not get their hands dirty, after all.

- Features: Japanese audio with English subtitles. Includes 12 episodes on 2 DVDs with a run-time of about 5 hours. Rated TV-14 due to violence and sexual content. There isn't any nudity to designate it with the TV-MA rating.

- Conclusion: Overall, this is a light-hearted anime with plenty of fan-service. No nudity, however. Plenty of silly situations and ecchi scenes that lead to awkward circumstances for the main character due to the ability to change genders; often subconsciously. Doesn't help when the other female characters tease him and develop feeling for him/her.
