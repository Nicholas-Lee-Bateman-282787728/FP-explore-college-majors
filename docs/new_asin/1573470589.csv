 What drew me to this series was accidentally  finding Subspecies II:Bloodstone on Sci-Fi Channel one afternoon. The  'shadow' effects were just incredible!!! Use of the gothic bulidings as  'walls' to create Radu's shadow when he was landing,flying, etc. And the  subtle creepiness and gothicness of these movies just stayed with me  through all 4 of them. I can't wait to see more!!

192036,5,1573470589,"Over six years ago I happened upon an unknown vampire series called Subspecies.  I was shocked at how much I enjoyed them and have missed em ever since.  Now, here is a way to revisit Romania and our favorite  vampires portrayed by Denice Duff and Anders Hove.
This DVD is equipped  with the Full Moon Pictures VideoZone (which accompanies almost all their  flicks).  It contains behind the scenes footage and interviews.
There are  two commentary tracks provided by Director Ted Nicolau and Denice Duff.  Mr. Nicolau's commentary is enjoyable.  He provides us with all the little  technical problems and enhancements that had to go into this movie.  Denice  Duff's commentary is hilarious.  Her stories of what happened with the  actors behind the scenes and how they felt was outstanding.
There are  also some Bio pages included on this DVD as well.
Overall a classic.  If  you like Full Moon Pictures, a must have.  If you've followed the  Subspecies movies, ditto.  If you are a fan of Vampire movies double ditto.",922147200,15,1018,4.876470588235295

192045,5,1573470589,Quite possibly the best Subspecies film! Watch the others before this though because it takes place right where the 3rd left off. Radu is the best vampire ever and I think he looks the most evil in this film. There is a videozone at the end of the VHS too. There are a couple things that I did not quite understand. Like in the credits the girl vampire named Serena is called Cassandra in the credits from the Vampire Journals film... Did anyone else notice this? It was a shame that the subspecies were never used in this film either. Those are my only complaints. There is plenty of blood in this one and lots of great lines .

192056,1,1573470589,"The first three ""Subspecies"" movies had their good points and bad points, but overall they were entertaining little vampire movies.

Not so with ""Subspecies IV: Bloodstorm.""

This is one of those movie sequels that does absolutely EVERYTHING wrong. Nothing about this story actually goes right, from Radu's makeup to continuity to the inclusion of new characters who are ABSOLUTELY POINTLESS. And what character development the main characters have experienced is literally tossed out the window within the first few minutes.

Having been burned alive and impaled on a tree, Radu (Anders Hove) falls into a convenient pond, which extinguishes him enough that he can creep back into a crypt. Meanwhile, Becky and her compatriots get into a fatal car accident mere seconds into the film, and everyone dies except Michelle (Denise Duff). Yay. At least Michelle survived. Because I like her character so much.

Michelle is rescued by a passing doctor, who takes her to the clinic of the crazy-eyed Dr. Nicolescu (Mihai Dinvale) WHO IS SO OBVIOUSLY A VAMPIRE. He recognizes Michelle's condition, and promises to cure her -- but he's especially interested in getting the Bloodstone. And Radu returns to Bucharest, taking over the holdings of his other fledgling, the refined and elegant Ash (Jonathon Morris) -- who also has plans to get rid of Radu.

""Bloodstorm"" does everything wrong -- continuity, makeup (Radu now looks like a paper-mache witch), pseudoscience, characterization, vampire lore, and the fact that all the established characters EXCEPT the ever-useless Michelle die ignominious, worthless deaths less than a minute into the story. There is nothing RIGHT about this movie.

Instead, most of the movie consists of Michelle lying around whining, Dr. Nicolescu making crazy eyes, and Ash making vague ""we should totally kill Radu, but for some reason we're not allowed to"" speeches. Occasionally something happens that seems like it should be significant (such as Dr. Nicolescu's trap for Radu), but it usually ends up being pointless. There's even a subplot about Inspector Marin becoming a comedy-relief vampire... and dying without having made any real impact on the plot.

And remember all that character development that Radu had in the previous movie, when he was starting to show regret and love? Well, forget about that, because he's now a 2-D baddie who now wants to live the high life in the big city. And Michelle is worse than useless -- when she isn't just lying around crying and whining, she's ACTIVELY saving Radu's life... because she wants to be free of him. STUPID.

The new characters have some potential, even if Dr. Nicolescu's buggy eyes will haunt my nightmares. Ash is the refined, gentlemanly vampire that Radu is not, and Dr. Nicolescu has found a substance that allows him to walk in the daylight. But neither of these characters really get fleshed out adequately -- Ash in particular contributes ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to the story.

""Subspecies IV: Bloodstorm"" is one of the worst sequels I have ever subjected myself to -- this is the vampire version of ""Troll 2.""",1362096000,2,3100,5.122772277227723
192057,2,1573470589,"After a fatal car accident kills her sister and prevents her escape from Romania, the struggling vampire Michele is taken in by a deranged doctor and his assistant, who claim that they can cure her. Her master, the evil Radu, is brought back to life once again by the Bloodstone, returning to his former coven to track down the woman who scorned him. Although it was made just a few years after the earlier entries, SUBSPECIES 4 feels like an entirely different film. The ugly opening gives an immediate sense of cheapness to the production, which is continues with the inferior make-up effects and Z-movie plot. SUBSPECIES has always been built on the growing sexual tension between Radu and Michele, yet here they share very little screen time. Only in the final moments are the two brought back together at last in one of the series' most powerful moments. Anders Hove and Denise Duff are subpar compared to before, but Dan Astileanu's obsessive and over-the-top professor drags the picture down. Regardless of its flaws, SUBSPECIES fans are sure to sink their teeth into this final entry, although it is easily the weakest in the series.

192062,5,1573470589,"SubSpecies 4 is the final  installment of the SubSpecies series.  Radus final time to try and control Michelle does he succeed or not?  you have to watch to find out..
We all so see the return of Ash the Music Loving Vampire who in this movie is clearly afraid of Radu since he is Ash's Master.  I enjoyed the Characer of Ash but he didn't play as big a part in the movies as I had wished and he didn't seem as strong as a character in this film as he did in  Vampire Journels. Ash's Fledgling is a diabolical vampire who wants nothing to destroy Radu and get the Bloodstone for her Master. Knowing she is no match against Radu face to face, she comes up with a plan to Get rid of him.

This was a well done movie had Michelle's continuing struggle of retaining her humanity and freeing herself of Radu once and for all.  I recommend this movie to vampire lovers every where.  I would like them  continue Michelle's  story and  see what has happens to her after this movie...by the end of the movie we learn the fates of Michelle and Radu. but you can never keep a good vampire down...

Remember  Radu's word....""you can't destroy me nothing can""",1250553600,,1146,4.299065420560748
192063,3,1573470589,"If you have not watched Subspecies One, Two, and Three yet, go pick those up first.  Whatever you do, don't let this be your first introduction to Radu.
Bloodstorm:Subspecies 4 starts out wrong and goes downhill from there.  I absolutely loved the first three movies, so I don't know what happened here for the writers and directers to wander so far off Radu's well loved trail of blood.
Where Bloodlust left off, Radu had fallen over the stone wall chasing the Bloodstone that Becky had tossed away, and wound out impaled on a dead tree and burning in the sunlight.  Bloodstorm picks up with Radu still burning, but the limb breaks and dumps him into a pool of water just as the sun sets, so Radu can grab up the Bloodstone and run into the castle.
We also left Michele wrapped in a body bag by her sister Becky, in order that she could flee the castle with her and Mel.  Here we pick up with a car wreck, and the only one left ""alive"" is Michele, who is picked up by a pretty blonde doctor named Anna and taken to a hospital.
Cheesier even still, we meet two new vampires in this installment; Dr. Nicolescu, an evil doctor-vampire with a horrible bowl haircut, and Ash, a minion of Radu's who has been looking after his holdings in Bucharest.  And speaking of hairdos, Ash looks like a pasty, older Peter Frampton.
The Dr. Nicolescu vampire wants Radu's bloodstone so that he can live without drinking blood any longer, whereas Ash and his fledgling Serena simply want to keep their home.
Everyone is against Radu in this movie, as usually they are, but the additional characters are horrid and the plotline is dumber and cheesier than even I can stomach.  Also missing is much of the scenery from Romania that we were treated to in the first movies, and the ""liveliness"" is gone, replaced a fouled attempt at going gothic instead of leaving the horror to Radu.
I was very disappointed in this last installment of the Subspecies series, but who knows?  Perhaps Radu could come back again, and make up for the mess he left with Bloodstorm.  If you are a rabid fan of the series like I am, then you will want your copy of Bloodstorm, otherwise just watch the first three.",1089244800,4,2171,4.506361323155216
192064,4,1573470589,"I like collecting DVDs of movies I liked as a kid for nostalgia, and I was really into Full Moon movies. The Puppet Master series, Dollman, Demonic toys, Pit & The Pendulum, Trancers, Crash and Burn and Subspecies. Most of these original DVDs are hard to find. For those that don't know a few years ago Full Moon sold their DVD rights to Paramount to market their movies. But Koch video released many official Full Moon movies on DVD illegally causing a big fall out between Full Moon and Paramount. The original Subspecies was released on R1 DVD (other movies released were Puppet Master I and II, Puppet Master boxed set, Crash and Burn, Pit & Pendulum and Demonic Toys.

I am still quite surprised at how much I enjoy them. There is really nothing to say about Bloodstorm that other reviewers haven't. If you are a fan of the series then by all means buy it. This brings some closure to the series but its very necessary to see the other 3 movies first.
This DVD comes with the usual Full Moon VideoZone. There are two commentary tracks provided by Director Ted Nicolau and Denise Duff. Mr. Nicolau's commentary is excellent.

The VHS versions of Subspecies 1-3 are even out-of-print, so there is no way to get the entire series anymore! This is terrible for fans just getting into the series and as a result they are forced to purchase bootlegged copies. What makes me wonder is if they will ever release the others again because Full Moon pictures has just folded and has gone out of business. This is a scary thought indeed.

Anyways, all I can say about this one is it's a brilliant movie. Anders Hove and Denise Duff did an awesome job as they reprised their roles for this movie. Too bad, it took some time for this one to come out as a followup to the others yet I'm glad to see it done. If any Vampire movies were true to the folklore, the Subspecies series has been it.

Wrong, in the time that he fell and they escaped Michele's sister and her boyfriend were in a fatal car wreak and they died.  Michele while still in a body bag was carted off to a guy who claimed to ahve a cure for Vampirism.  In all manner of truth he is just a pathetic bloodsucker who wanted the bloodstone.  Radu teams up with an apprentice/fledgling (the guy from vampire journals) and they try to reclaim Michele.

7798218,4,1573470589,"After a seizure inducing flash-fest for the opening credits, we pick up right where Radu ended up, hung like a blazing ornament on a dead Christmas tree.  Not wanting anyone to think this was the ultimate demise of poor misunderstood Radu, the writer placed a very convenient puddle under this tree where a toasty Radu could take a dip before the sun came up.  Sadly, the writer also saw fit to kill off the sister and the embassy guy in a car crash.  Naturally, deader than dead Michelle survives the crash and ends up in the clinic of a screwy doctor (of sorts).  Loath to let a good vampire go to waste, Dr. Nicolescu does a little experimenting on Michelle, who never had her wits about her in the best of times.  He tortures her with light because he knows it annoys her.  He teases her with the prospect of a cure.  But mostly, he just wants Radu and the Bloodstone.  Now if he only had some bait to lure the geezer vampire to his clinic..............

More of the same in this installment, with the addition of some new vampires best left dead.  Apparently, Radu had some financial holdings that he wants back from a fledgling heretofore never mentioned.  Theres the barest suggestion that the story could go on but instead they rush to wrap it up in a hasty fashion that proves entirely unsatisfying.  Pity.
Just when I had gotten used to Anders Hove (Radu) and his catalog of strange mannerisms, his bizarre speech impediment, and messy eating habits; Radu bites the dust.",1491868800,,1481,4.568181818181818

7798222,1,1573470589,"Parts 1 and 2 were great for direct-to-DVD, and part 3 lost some inertia but remained a fun franchise installment.  However, with no cool effects and a messy story, part 4 felt just plain lazy.  I wish they never made it.  And that's hard for me to say as an otherwise huge fan of the franchise.  <<apathetic shrug>>

After a major refresher montage of pretty much every scene and special effect of the franchise, we pick up right where Subspecies III: Bloodlust (1994) ended with a barbequed Radu not dead because Michelle (Denice Duff; Subspecies IIIV, Night of the Living Dead 3D: Re-Animation) and her rescuers had left the bloodstone behind.  So Radu (Anders Hove; Subspecies I-IV, Critters 4) scrambles away to regenerate as Michelle, now a fully initiated vampire, is taken to a hospital where a vampire-knowledgeable doctor (Mihai Dinvale; Blood and Chocolate, Dark Angel: The Ascent) claims he can cure her ancient malady!

I'm sorry to say that this fourth installment is far less interesting than its predecessors.  Lt. Marin (Ion Haiduc; Subspecies II-IV, Dark Angel: The Ascent, Mimic: Sentinel), my least favorite character from part 3, returns and contributes nothing of value as one of Radu's recent weak creations.

Adding to the needlessly complex plot, the doctors are more interested in researching the bloodstone than helping Michelle, another of Radu's fledglings and his protg conspire against Radu, the doctor is himself a vampire, Michelle suddenly has a soft spot for Raduit's just too much and it keeps us from getting into any one plot element.  There's too much going on for it to develop into anything.  This is all on top of the base storyline of Radu trying to reclaim Michelle under his wing.  Haven't we had enough of that yet with the last two films???  <<sigh>>

The special effects seem a less frequent (than parts I-III) as well.  We see lots of shadow walking (which is no longer interesting or impressive really), I still have a love-hate relationship with Radu's gangly fingers and there are a few blood feedings, but outside of the introductory footage from part 3 and a couple of beheadings there are no cool effects.  What the Hell?  Nothing comes even remotely close to the neat claymation of Radus minions or Radus head reattaching itself a la The Thing (1982) with arterial tendrils whipping from his detached head and affixing themselves to his body to drag his head into place as his spinal cord extends outward to receive itAWESOME EFFECT from Subspecies II. Where was all that?  It seems that both the writing and special effects were left behind on this one.

Parts 1 and 2 were pretty damn good--great, in fact, for direct-to-DVD releases.  Then with Subspecies III: Bloodlust (1994) director Ted Nicolaou (Subspecies I-III, Terror Vision, Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys) lost the inertia that started this franchise so powerfully--but part 3 was still a fun franchise installment.  However, part 4 felt just plain lazy.  No cool effects and a messy story.  I wish they never made it.
