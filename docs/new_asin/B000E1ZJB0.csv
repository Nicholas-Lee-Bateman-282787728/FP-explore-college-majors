8104486,1,B000E1ZJB0,"I pride myself on being able to make witty comments on things that are just so bad. However, this movie was beyond bad and the best thing I could come up with was nice mullet.  It is as if a bunch of middle school students got together, did a whole lot of meth, and wrote something would be funny.  Apparently one of the 6th graders was related to the producer.  I don't know that I have seen a worse movie ever.  The other 1-star reviewer was kind in comparison to my feelings.  One final word of advice - unless someone has paid you to watch it, and I mean paid you a lot, don't waste your time.

PS.  my wife wants to own this movie.  please help.",1250812800,,650,4.062992125984252
8104487,1,B000E1ZJB0,"Wow...how can I explain the utter mind-numbing power of this movie, (if you can call it a movie). I watched this on TV and I swear I was praying for commercials. BORING. Nearly zero plot, horrible acting, too many actors doing absolutely nothing for this ridiculous piece of crap. Just an overwhemingly STUPID movie. I hope the network didn't pay more than six cents to air this ""D"" film. I really should have been able to rate this zero stars.",1117324800,,444,4.5625
8104488,4,B000E1ZJB0,It's obvious that the cast and crew got together and had a terrific time giving us a terrific time. This movie ranks high in the genre of The Naked Gun and Police Academy movies.,939945600,3,178,4.264705882352941
