8343709,5,B001UHN8BA,"The box set with all 13 episodes and some extras just appeared in Germany. Go to amazon.de and search for the ASIN ""B003PQWIJC"". Languages English, German, French, Italian with optional subtitles in all 4 languages. An English-only box will be released in Britain on Sept. 13, 2010 (go to amazon.co.uk and search for the ASIN ""B003UTUYAO""). Both boxes are of course Region 2 and so you'll need a region-free DVD player, a Blueray player or a computer (on most you can toggle between regions about 10 times) to view the DVDs. It is a bit amazing to have the Canadian show first appear on DVD in Europe, usually it is the otherway round. Maybe it's because the series has just been shown on a major German channel, RTL.

The show is excellent. With its relaxed storytelling it reminded me a bit of Kyle XY. All very natural writing and acting. Only the last episode comes across a bit forced, as the writers provide a lot of material obviously to accomplish some resolution when they learned that there might not be a second season.",1282608000,2,1030,4.628415300546448
8343710,4,B001UHN8BA,"Toby Logan ( Craig Olejnik) is a paramedic who is also a telepathic. We slowly learn that he is an orphan with a mysterious past and that he learned to block his gift after watching it destroy his mother.
 Toby generally is able to block thoughts but suddenly he starts having trouble blocking strong thoughts and  with some he becomes obsessed with following them to unravel the mystery. As he starts to use his telepathic ability to help people he starts to see it as a gift instead of a curse. Because he's blocked this ability for so long he has to learn how to use it, because lets face it how often do people think horrible things that they have no intention of doing....so reading minds only gives Toby clues, the challenge is to put the pieces together to get the whole picture.

This show, like many shows like it needs time to develop and to find a following. While I see a lot of problems with the premise and still feel the show is finding it's feet I also think that is normal for psychic themed shows.

The acting and stories over all are  good. I really enjoy the comic relief of the Oz man (Ennis Esmer from Heros)  and Craig Olejnik is very believable in the lead. Then there is Detective Marks, the only positive comment on Detective Marks is that she's super hot but her character is painfully unbelievable. I know the writers were using her to try to create tension and conflict but it was way over the top, just bad writing. I also hope they take time to develop the character of Dr Olivia Fawcett because in the first season her character really doesn't serve any purpose.

While NBC has canceled ""The Listener"" it looks like it's been picked up by Canada's CTV network (like scyfi channel here).  So if you think season 1 shows promise and you'd like to see where they take it you'll have a chance to see season 2, even if it does end up being only on video it still means that a promising show is being given the time to find itself and I for one am looking forward to watching season 2.",1272153600,8,2011,4.344
