8470248,4,B005FLD2TA,"I have some reservations about giving this 4 as opposed to 3 stars, but in the end, I choose 4. Kinks Kollekted 1964-1983, is a nice collection of videos in view of the fact that their are not many legal collections of vids by The Kinks. On the other hand, this collection clocks in at only 62 minutes long. Also, I always find it irritating when dvd's do not display running times, as is the case with this one. The songs themselves are very strong, however, and essential fo true Kink fans. The videos are presented in chronological order from You Really Got Me from Beatroom BBC in 1966 to the promo video of Don't Forget To Dance from 1983, which was a staple on MTV. Other rare promo videos include Dead End Street(1966), Starstruck(1968), Apeman(1970), the very rare Sitting In The Midday Sun(1973), Come Dancing(1982), and Don't Forget To Dance(1983), the last two of which were MTV staples played in heavy rotation in the USA. It is also significant to note that this collection includes the rare videos by brother Dave Davies, Death Of A Clown(1967), as well as Susannah's Still Alive(1967). Clips are all lip synched and gathered from such sources as Beat Beat Beat, Beat Club, Beatroom, Pop Goes The 60's, Vibrato, Top Of The Pops, and the very rare Vjoew and Qoui De Neuf. So you get German, French, and British sources. As I said, the songs are quite stong, which also include Tired Of Waiting For You, A Well Respected Man, Till The End Of The Day, Sunny Afternoon, the quite rare Mr. Pleasant, Waterloo Sunset, Autumn Almanac, Wonderboy, Plastic Man and Lola. Six of the videos are in color and overall, the transfers are quite clear. In view of all of the union hassles that The Kinks had in the USA during the 60's, performance clips are virtually non-existant. Specifically from the states during the 60's. Only bootlegs exist during this period. It would be an improvement if the great Brit. Invasion series Reelin' In The Years by Eagle Rock Entertainment could gather enough footage to present a much needed Kinks set. Their recent sets by The Hollies, Small Faces, Dusty Springfield, Herman's Hermits, and Gerry And the Pacemakers are all excellent. For now Kinks Kollekted will have to suffice. It is an essential collection for Kink Kollectors! SMRZ!!!",1334534400,2,2276,4.764556962025316
8470249,3,B005FLD2TA,"Big Kinks fan.  But after purchasing the Hollies
DVD, I can only gather the Kinks package had little
of the group's input, as a great number of the performances were lip-synched, inferior quality and
a disappointment to me.  The color performances were fine, but there were no interviews or overview of the group, something the Hollies, as always, was of high quality and given a great deal of thought.",1332288000,,402,4.811594202898551
8470250,2,B005FLD2TA,"I purchased this DVD on the strength of the positive reviews and I may have been drinking , also.  For the hardcore Kinks' fan this may satisfy, for me not so much. It's really just a bunch of videos, none earth shattering. I have a bootleg DVD of the Kinks, Jan. 72, BBC broadcast from the Rainbow Theater in London.  That is the type of stuff I'm longing for. There must be that & more that could be released. As with all these groups from the 60's, they need to get the product out as their fan base with disposable income is dying or losing interest.  So it's bootlegs or youtube, check out Ray Davies singing Waterloo Sunset at the Roundhouse..... that's what I'm talking about.",1325116800,,683,4.404761904761905
8470251,4,B005FLD2TA,"Of course it could have been better but it is worth noting there are a few rarities on here.  Even on bootlegs, I have never seen the promo videos for ""Apeman"" and ""Sitting In The Midday Sun"" in their entirety.  It's also great to have the promo videos I have seen before, like ""Starstruck"", ""Sunny Afternoon"" and ""Dead End Street"" in better quality and without VH1 logos and such in the corner.  ""Dead End Street"" is an absolute classic video.

Besides the promo videos, about half of this are performances from TV shows.  To the reviewer complaining about the studio audio being dubbed over live footage.  In most of the cases seen here, the band was lip synching anyway.  The only songs that could have actually had the live audio are ""You Really Got Me"", ""Well Respected Man"" and ""Till The End Of The Day"".  It is disappointing that the audio on those were replaced, they are available on numerous bootlegs.

My biggest complaint is that there are only 3 videos from after 1970.  I know the 60s Kinks are considered their peak, but I think they stayed fairly consistent throughout their 30+ years.  The Kinks are one of the most underrated bands ever.  It would have been great to get a complete collection of promo videos.  And of course, actual live footage.  Hopefully there will be more quality Kinks DVD releases.",1322524800,11,1322,4.642241379310345
8470252,5,B005FLD2TA,"If you like the kinks at all and are looking for some great footage throughout their carear. This is for you. I took a chance on this,their wasn't any reviews and i couldn't of been happier. Most of the footage is black and white.their promos,english tv and a few videos.the picture quality is exellent considering your starting with the 60's and the sound quality is exellent. The first time I put it on it took about 10 seconds and i said to myself holy s..t this is worth it already. Hope this is helpful for you.",1320796800,19,516,4.385416666666667
8470253,2,B005FLD2TA,"While the picture and sound quality are very good, every so called live performance is lip synched.  There are a bunch of promos for the biggest of Kinks fans.  I'd say skip your money on this one.  I'd love to see some early Kinks in actual performance.",1320019200,10,254,4.361702127659575
8470254,5,B005FLD2TA,"GREAT KOLLECTION OF CLASSIC KINKS!
ORIGINAL AUDIO HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH GREAT REMASTERD SOUND!!!
MY ONLY QUESTION IS....WHERE'S ""SET ME FREE"" & ALL DAY AND ALL OF THE NIGHT?
DON'T LET THAT STOP YOU THOUGH...THIS IS A MUST HAVE DVD OF EARLY KINKS!!!",1318809600,7,249,4.813953488372093
8470255,5,B005FLD2TA,"As someone who grew up listening to the British Invasion I looked for a decent dvd of the Kinks but most out there had really poor reviews. Well, going on the one positive review here on Amazon I thought I would take a chance on this one and I am glad I did. I like everything about this dvd. It shows how creative and talented Ray Davies and the Kinks are. Pretty good for a band that has held together for all those years. A lot of garage bands back then almost always added You Really Got Me into their lineup including ones I played with. I had not heard Waterloo Sunset for years and I am glad it is included here. I would recommend this for anyone who likes The Kinks or British Invasion music. For me it was well worth the price.",1318464000,7,736,4.118055555555555
