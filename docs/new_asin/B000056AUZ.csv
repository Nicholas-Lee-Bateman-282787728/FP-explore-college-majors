1396700,4,B000056AUZ,"I especially like Roy Roger's movies when he has Bob Nolan and The Sons Of The Pioneers included in the film.  Roy Roger's has always been a role model for young children, clean, honest and his films were decent viewing for the entire family. His kind of clean type image in the movies will be greatly missed. As now most of what Hollywood puts out are R-rated. Is it because our mature Producers and Directors are replaced by Kids?",1056326400,3,432,4.468354430379747

1396704,5,B000056AUZ,"Roll on Texas Moon, 1946 film

It begins with a herd of sheep along a river. Gabby drives them away from his property. Then he sees a mans body! A woman and man ride up to accuse him of murder. [Presumption?] Gabby is arrested for killing Matthew Delany (who was killed by a rifle bullet). Will this cause a war between cattlemen and sheepmen? Roy is sent there to investigate by the Whirligig Cattle Syndicate. Kate rolls her own cigarettes and manages the sheep ranch. Someone is stampeding the sheep to kill them. A lamb follows Gabby (for comedy). Jill plans to return to San Francisco to avoid trouble, but Kate convinces her to stay. The lamb is used for jokes. Roy arrives and sings. His job is to investigate the source of the troubles. Roy tries to return Taffy the lamb to Ramshead Ranch.

Roy is stopped by a group of men and accused of trespassing on Delanys sheep ranch. Roy explains his visit and offers help. He invites Jill and Kate to the cantina. There is music. Roy returns Taffy to Jill. They learn that the prize ram Hampshire Prince was killed! A fight results. The Sheriff stops the fight. How was the ram killed when they had all those armed guards? [A clue?] Roy and Gabby investigate the site of Delanys killing. They see a car out of control (Jill is driving). It goes off the road into the river! Roy rescues Jill. There is an old-fashioned Victrola that plays tubes instead of discs for another song. Roy offers to work free as a guard on Jills sheep ranch. A private conversation tells about the guilty and the cause. Gabby dozes off. There is another song. Gabby awakes after a nightmare! Jill and Roy talk. At night Jills guards go on patrol. Gabby calls Jill to tell about his dream about her car. Cole tells his men to wreck that car completely. [Destroying evidence?]

Two men shoot at Roy, who falls off his horse. Another group of riders arrive to accuse Roy of the killing, but Roy rides away. [There is a difference between a pistol bullet and a rifle bullet.] When Jill hears this she says she wants to return to Frisco. Roy telephones Jill so they meet and exchange information. Would Cole have a reason for harming the owner of the sheep ranch? Roy discovers the sabotage on Jills car (before it can be destroyed). A gang of cattlemen ride to the Delany ranch. [Up to no good?] They chase Roy. Jill arrives to tell about Cole and Andrews. Those cattlemen ride up, there is shooting. Roy follows Cole into the barn. Will Cole shoot Roy in the back? Fortune favors Roy. There is another song to end this story. There should be a happy ending.

Sheep cropped the grass close to the ground so cattle couldn't graze afterwards. This is why cattlemen hated sheep. Sheep ranching had a lower capital investment (but were prey to coyotes). Their wool could be harvested without destroying the animal, unlike cowhides. Sheep required less water and ate coarser fodder. That is why sheep thrived in the arid southwest. [Wool makes the best fiber for clothes as it doesnt lose its insulating property when wet with water.] This story is more complex than the average Western. It has a murder mystery, singing, comedy, economic conflicts, and a lesson about double agents. And the hero gets the girl. Even Gabby winds up with Kate! What happened to Taffy? [Dennis Hoey played Inspector Lestrade in the Sherlock Holmes movies of Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce.]",1404777600,,3390,4.607615894039735

1396709,5,B000056AUZ,"The King of the Cowboys remains the King to this day in my opinion. I had the pleasure and honor to meet Roy Rogers and I was so impressed with my childhood hero he was as genteel and genuine as his screen persona. I purchased this gem and for Western fans it doesn't get any better. The great William Witney directs and the mix of music ,action and comedy relief, provided by Gabby Hayes make this a stand out. A note on Roy Roger films each one was different in theme not as formula as one would assume. The villains ran the gamut from Nazi spies to corrupt developers that remind us of the Fannie Mae corruption today. In some of Roys films even child abuse is discussed! Government bureacrats visit Roy's West as well and are often painted as Bernie Madoff thugs. Enjoy a piece of American pop history and for you NRA guntoters  in real life Roy could handle those six-shooters like a hellion! and his membership in the NRA ended only when he left this range for that big one in the sky.",1323993600,2,991,4.327956989247312
