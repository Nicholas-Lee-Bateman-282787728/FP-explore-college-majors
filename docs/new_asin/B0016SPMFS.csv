Finally, the patriot must do battle in the enemy stronghold in an epic fight to the finish, where our heroes encounter untold forms of Kung Fu.

Magnificent Kung Fu Warriors aka Magnificent Wanderers is another long lost classic from the Shaw brothers studios. The movie is dubbed about halfway while the other half consists of subtitle reading. I got this film to help finish up my Shaw Bros collection, and I was lucky to find a halfway decent dubbed version. Some Shaw films are out of print so the only versions left are those floating around on Amazon and other underground sites.",1399420800,,741,4.7
