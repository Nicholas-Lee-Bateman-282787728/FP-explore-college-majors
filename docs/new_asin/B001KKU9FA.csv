3665890,5,B001KKU9FA,"This movie is so funny that it had me and my family crying
from laughter, holding onto our sides and rocking
back & forth in our chairs!
This is a fitting tribute to the comic genius of the
late great Bernie Mac, who had such chrisma and that good ol'
down home humor like a crazy uncle who always comes to the
family reunions and lights it up!
He's in great form here and it seems to me, a bit reflective,
as if he knew that this would be his last statement to the world!
If you watch the special features, you'll see what I mean.
Samuel Jackson plays the grizzled world-weary sidekick with finesse!
He and Mac shared a great chemistry and comraderie and boy, it shows!
The supporting cast all pulled their weight too and delivered
funny moments as well. Also, this movie was the swan song for
one of the latter 20th Century's great musical minds...
The Black Moses...Issac Hayes!!
In the late 60's thru early 70's, he was a musical & cultural
force to be reckoned with!--Later he proved himself to be
a good actor, and of course the younger generations knew him
as the voice of ""Chef"" from the now iconic ""Southpark"".
It's uncanny that both he and Bernie Mac passed away right
after this movie was finished, on the exact same weekend!
Well, if ever there was a time capsule for these two..here it is!
Hayes' music is featured throughout as well.
This is definitely one to add to your collection.

RIP BERNIE MAC (1957-2008) and Issac Hayes (1942-2008)",1236643200,7,1453,4.483018867924528
3665891,5,B001KKU9FA,"this movie was very good, funny, and well written. it actually gets a four star but the blu ray quality on here gives it a five star. this is one of the best movies on blu ray as far as quality and sound. some movies look better on blu ray than others and this is def one of the best next to max payne, dark night, aliens vs predator, incredible hulk, and iron man.",1234742400,,365,3.945945945945946
3665892,4,B001KKU9FA,"""Soul Men,"" a 2008 release, is a musical comedy road picture, with a template of sadness behind it.  It stars more frequent action hero, Samuel L. Jackson, and the late Bernie Mac.  It was written by Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone, and directed by Malcolm Lee, noted American filmmaker Spike Lee's kid brother.  Jackson plays Louis Hinds; Mac, Floyd Henderson.  Together, they were once ""The Real Deal,"" popular soul singers, and released a single record album.  But it's been decades since they were together.  Then the death of the supposedly legendary Marcus Hooks (John Legend), once their lead singer, gives them a very good reason to reunite:  there's to be a memorial concert at New York's famous Apollo Theater, at which they've been invited to sing.  It might just jump start their fallow singing careers.

So, quick as you can say Jackie Robinson, it becomes a road picture, as the quarreling ex-colleagues jump into a Cadillac in California, with four days to reach New York.  There is lots of grumbling and fighting, and, be warned if it bothers you, a great deal of obscene language: with m-----f----- in almost every scene.  Along the road, they will bump up against Rosalee, played by Jennifer Coolidge, in a distasteful sexist interlude that I could have done without.  Also Cleo (Sharon Leal,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dreamgirls/dp/B000O1799U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dreamgirls </a>), who is supposedly the daughter of one of the leads; they're initially not sure which; Lester (Affion Crockett), Cleo's none too bright, abusive boyfriend; Danny Epstein (Sean Hayes), their new manager, and Philip, (Adam Herschman), Epstein's gofer.  Towards the end of the picture we meet the late great funk/soul musician Isaac Hayes, playing himself.

Hayes is very visibly ill and weak - he is used to do little more than walk across the screen.  And I wish the producers had spent more money on the actors playing Philip (Herschman) and Cleo (Leal): they appear in many scenes, and granted, Leal is certainly pretty enough and sings very well; but they don't bring much to the screen.

However, the charismatic leads do bring a lot to their parts.  Their comic timing is spot-on; Jackson's a good straight man, yet he can both pitch and catch: go know.  The singing is fine, and the movie boasts a nice sound track of 1970's funk/soul hits.  All in all, it's an enjoyable film. And, while it is the last film appearance of Mac and Hayes, I can recommend it as worth seeing for more than curiosity.  Nevertheless, at film's post script, as the final credits roll, the interviews with Mac and Hayes are likely to bring tears to your eyes: they did to mine.",1233619200,16,2714,5.0835214446952595
3665893,4,B001KKU9FA,"I was kind of skeptical about seeing this movie because usually when an actor or comic passes on their last movie is questionable but Soul Men is one of the few exceptions.

The story chronicles Lewis Hinds(Samuel L. Jackson) and Floyd Henderson(Bernie Mac)two members of the group ""Real Deal"". Floyd pays a visit to Lewis after the death of a soul singer legend Marcus Hooks(played by John Legend) to perform at an event at the Apollo because they believe they can get paid. Lewis is still bitter with Floyd about an incident involving his former wife. They reluctantly team up and go performing state to state before they reach the Apollo.

I won't say that I always laughed but there are plenty of times where I laughed especially with the interaction between Bernie Mac's character and Samuel Jackson's character. Cleo's bumbling, abusive boyfriend Lester(Affion Crockett) had some funny moments too. Both Floyd and Lewis's misadventures are humorous also. There are times when i laughed and times where I smiled. Lewis's interaction with Cleo(played by the attractive Sharon Leal who somewhat resembles Kerry Washington) was sweet. The songs Lewis and Floyd sung were cool and they seem to have a ball performing them and not phoning in their performances(like some entertainers tend to do). Its a shame that Bernie Mac passed before the release of this film. He would have been proud of the final product because the movie was pretty good.

REST IN PEACE BERNIE MAC, ISAAC HAYES and RUDY RAY MOORE!!!",1233014400,4,1506,4.968253968253968

3666145,4,B001KKU9FA,"Soul Men was a film that was racked with problems right from the start. Originally the film kept getting pushed back because of a law suit by the R&B group, Sam & David, which claimed it to be a farce on their life story. The group also accused the producers of copyright infringement for using their style and the title of one of their songs, ""Soul Man"". The law suit was finally settled and the movie was released in 2008. Then, days before the films release, two of it's stars, Bernie Mac and Issac Hayes, died on back to back days, a tragedy that created a public relations nightmare. For those reasons, this film wasn't widely distributed or advertised, which is a shame because it was one terrific film. The story starts 30 years after a legendary R&B group, Marcus Hooks & The Real Deal, broke up. We see the remaining members, Samuel L. Jackson in trouble with the law, and Bernie Mac, living in a retirement community, when they learn about the sudden death of Hooks. Record executives, quick to capitalize on his death, organize a tribute show at the Apollo in New York, and invite the Real Deal to participate. This means that two men who hate each other and haven't performed in almost 30 years, need to get their act together in a hurry if they want the big pay day and a chance at a come back. The film is an absolute riot, with Mac as the old lonely man and Jackson as the bitter forgotten convict. Their chemistry was nothing short of amazing and the big surprise was that both men can actually sing and dance! Even though they must have said mother f'er about a thousand times, I found the film to be very clever, funny, and original. If it wasn't for all the problems it had, this movie would have done much better than it did and it is without a doubt, worth watching.",1361836800,,1787,4.401812688821752

3666156,5,B001KKU9FA,"Marcus Hooks and the Real Deal ruled the R'N'B roost.  Hooks went solo and the Deal, Louis Hinds(Samuel L. Jackson) and Floyd Henderson(Bernie Mac), embarked on their own with varying degrees of success.  Eventually the group broke up through internal turmoil and Hinds was busted for armed robbery and Henderson became a successful auto dealer.  Flash forward Hooks has passed and they are organizing a tribute memorial for him at the Apollo and the Real Deal have been approached to participate.  Can these two throw away the festering grudges and mount a comeback?  There is a certain predictability to the plot where the two bicker on a cross-country trip from L.A. to New York.  The selling point here is the paring of Jackson and Mac.  These two have terrific chemistry as they verbally spar and one-up each other on the way to the Apollo stage.  The casting of the two is inspired and should have been thought of sooner.  It's a little bittersweet knowing that this film was released posthumously after Mac's death but we should be grateful that his final film was a terrific one.",1342310400,,1087,4.801075268817204

3666159,5,B001KKU9FA,"I'm a huge fan of Bernie Mac and this has got to be his best work ever! This movie is what you would call a real laugh out loud till your sides ache comedy!

Bernice Mac and Samuel L. Jackson are both ex-soul singers who only put out one record back in the seventies and went their separate ways there after. Due to the death of their previous lead singer they are asked to perform at his funeral and are therefore asked to reunite, even though they are not on the best of terms.

Even though I really enjoyed this movie greatly, I must warn everyone there is a considerable amount of adult scenes in the movie and a prolific use of abusive language (m*****f***er) in almost every scene... I think they would have even worked that word into the title if they could!

The movie does a great 70's soundtrack which I really enjoyed especially the one when they first hit the road!

3666166,4,B001KKU9FA,"In these days of Hollywood movies aimed at 12 to 14 year olds, this comes across as clever and not too formulaic.

Mac and Jackson are an updated black Hope and Crosby with street lingo comedic exchanges that actually had me laughing.

This is no minor feat, as I can't remember a recent comedy over the past couple of years that had me smiling (In Bruges did have its moments though).

Two of the more memorable scenes are:

1. Mac choking their dead band leader as he argues with Jackson about why they broke up. Oh yeah,they're in a piano shaped coffin,on stage at the Apollo theater.

2. Jackson jumping out of a shared bed in disgust, because Mac had mistakenly taken a Viagra(instead of a heart pill) with the obvious results, was another pretty classic moment.

It does. The first half hour is continual cursing. I understand that, but didn't care to go through another hour of it. The next hour was completely different.

Yes, there was cursing, and there was contention, but the musical episodes were great fun, as was the rebuilding of relationships, and living dreams. Seems they wanted to cram most of the cursing into the first part of the movie.

I wouldn't recommend it as a movie to watch with chidren, but it's worthwhile if you like a movie that is both comedy and soul-searching. Samuel L. Jackson is, as always, one of our best living actors.",1241308800,2,704,4.441860465116279

3666181,5,B001KKU9FA,I would recommend this movie for adults. If you want a good comedy and don't mind profanity then you would enjoy this movie. It was worth every penny I paid for it and more.,1238976000,,173,4.117647058823529

3666184,1,B001KKU9FA,"i don't think the ""F"" word is necessary to make this picture. i would never let my wife or daughters watch any kind of picture where the only word used is the ""F"" word. this is an example of poor judgement on the part of the producers and director. i do not recommend this movie, another piece of garbage.",1238457600,,305,4.186440677966102
3666185,5,B001KKU9FA,"This movie will be a lasting legacy for Bernie Mac! Whether you appreciate his sense of humor, or not, his facial expressions, when dealing with each episode that is thrown at him, is hysterical. I saw this at the theater and decided it was well worth the $ to buy the DVD, as it's certainly one that I will watch again somewhere down the road. I laughed out loud through most of the movie.. as well as the rest of the crowd, and regret I didn't bring tissues to wipe my eyes, as it was needed. Great music.. funny story and great writing. Just enjoy being entertained!",1237680000,2,569,4.327102803738318
3666186,4,B001KKU9FA,"When I think of 60's soul, I think of the black and white, pre-hippy, squeaky clean TV era. Well, this movie is anything but squeaky clean, but it's probably a more accurate portrayal of how things really were back then (in the heydey of the ""Real Deal""). Bernie Mac and Samuel Jackson actually make a great pair--the chemistry between them really shines onscreen.

The ending was a little tacky, I must say, but the music is good, even though there's not much of a market for that old-time soul music out there today. Perhaps this movie will revive it a little?--that would be cool. So, not a GREAT movie, but entertaining.",1236816000,2,624,4.621621621621622

Jackson and the late Bernie mac star as blues singers that were once a group which also included John Legend in the movie as the third man, who died early in the movie. overall great movie for anybody who loves comedy.
