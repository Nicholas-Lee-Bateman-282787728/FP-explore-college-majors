8390267,4,B00374G3M0,"Fun stuff, different cast from the original offerings. but I thing the Rev Mother is more authentic.",1407369600,,100,4.9411764705882355
8390268,4,B00374G3M0,"I don't know what these other reviewers were watching, but I found this to be one of my favorites of the 'Nunsense' series. The cast is stellar across the board, including the incredibly talented Deborah Del Maestro as Sister Robert Anne, and the music is fun. Like all the others, there really is no plot and if you are looking for one then you are watching it wrong. Honestly, if you didn't like any of the other shows in the series, you probably aren't going to like this one. But if you are a fan of the Little Sisters of Hoboken and their wacky brand of humor, then definitely give it a chance!",1360627200,,599,4.3097345132743365
8390269,2,B00374G3M0,"A big Nunsense fan, but this one kind of drug on and on. Sister Amnesia, as always, had the best lines and stole the show.",1312675200,2,122,3.92
8390270,1,B00374G3M0,"No excuse for charging pprofessional amount for this rather pathetic and lackluster homemade production.....if I were a relative, maybe it would be worth it - but sad and annoying to watch!!",1293753600,2,190,5.161290322580645
8390271,1,B00374G3M0,"What a waste - just a dumb, amateur stage show - couldn't get past the first few minutes.  Had to stop it, and find another DVD to watch.  DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS ONE!",1278201600,4,166,4.0
