5057145,3,B0075C6F8C,"Besides being from roughly the same time period, and loosely classified as being in the science fiction genre, The Crater Lake Monster (1977), and Galaxina (1980), are films that appear to share very little in common.  Still, Mill Creek Entertainment has combined this unlikely pair on a single Bluray disc.  Of the two, The Crater Lake Monster seems to stand the test of time a little better than Galaxina, a fantasy set far in the future.

The Crater Lake Monster (Rating: 3 stars)
Featuring stop-action special effects, The Crater Lake Monster (1977) is reminiscent of creature features from the late 50's.  The simplistic plot is far out, and the acting a bit stiff, but if you are in the right frame of mind, the film does have some entertainment value, with the stop action work being the most interesting aspect.

A meteor crashes into the bottom of Crater Lake, in Oregon, and begins emitting heat which warms up a lost plesiosaur egg, causing it to hatch.  The swimming dinosaur thrives in the lake, eating most of the fish and becoming huge.  Seeking food, the plesiosaur attacks boats and even crawls ashore to grab a bite to eat.  When human remains turn up at the lake, the local Sheriff (Richard Cardella) attempts to close it down, but has no idea what he is up against.

The special effects budget probably limits what we see of the dinosaur, who stays concealed until near the end.  With pedestrian special effects, The Crater Lake Monster is not a very well made film, but it will still have a certain charm for some.  It scores points mainly for nostalgia value, and for being half decent with very little to work with.  The print has some signs of dirt, but looks satisfactory in high definition.

Galaxina: (Rating: 2 stars)
Galaxina (1980) was a part of the wave of post Star Wars (1977) sci-fi films.  This very silly comedy/adventure borrows from Star Trek, Star Wars, and Alien.  With a kind of crude nostalgic charm, the film is probably most notable for the presence of Dorothy Stratten, Playboy Playmate of the Year for 1980, who was brutally murdered by her husband shortly after the film's release, at just twenty years of age.

Set in the 31st century, the Infinity is a police craft commanded by Captain Cornelius Butts (Avery Schreiber), and piloted by Sergeant Thor (Stephen Macht).  Stratten's role is as Galaxina, a shapely android who tends to the crew of five.  When the Infinity is dispatched to a faraway planet to find information about the ""Blue Star"", the crew goes into cryosleep for the journey which will take 27 years.

While the humans sleep, Galaxina successfully reprograms herself to speak and experience emotions.  The crew awakens at their destination, but The Infinity crash lands on the planet after being ambushed by the evil Ordric.  With the crew incapacitated, Galaxina sets out on what becomes a very bizarre adventure.  The planet has an old West motif, and the light from the sun makes everything look red during the daytime.  Galaxina recovers the Blue Star and has a shootout out with Ordric, before being captured by a gang of bikers.  Galaxina's rescue and subsequent escape, is the most exciting incident in the film.

The film is a smorgasbord of odd disjointed ideas, where hardly anything exciting happens.  The special effects are passable at best, the gags are weak, and the dialog is often terrible.  While nice to look at, unfortunately Dorothy Stratten's performance does not improve much after she begins speaking.  Stratten's tragically brief life was the subject of several movies, including Bob Fosse's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-80/dp/B000GAKBI0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star 80</a>&nbsp;(1983), with Mariel Hemmingway as Stratten.  Galaxina is not subtitled, and has no extras.  Image quality varies from decent to poor, and although in high definition, the transfer may not look very impressive.

If you are interested in either film, this Bluray probably features the best looking version of each film currently available.",1325376000,3,4060,5.096822995461422
5057146,4,B0075C6F8C,"I won't comment on Galaxina since I haven't watched it.

After watching ""The Crater Lake Monster"" on Blu-ray I was actually impressed how good it actually looked. This is a budget blu-ray and if you can get it for a good price go for it. A previous reviewer complained about the compression artifacts but it didn't bother me much at all. Maybe some of the artifacts are due to the stop motion photography but I didn't notice.

You can find screen shots at blu-ray.com to see for yourself.",1320796800,,488,4.534090909090909
5057147,2,B0075C6F8C,"Hands down the worst looking Blu-Ray I've seen so far.  Galaxina uses a faded/worn print, but the increased resolution makes it a winner over the DVD print - and I wasn't really disappointed with it like many others here.  What ruins this release for me, though, is the transfer of The Crater Lake Monster - the cheap ""underdog"" of this Blu-Ray set.  Riddled with compression artifacts and lacking fine background detail, TCLM looks terrible.  At first glance it looks great, with strikingly bright colors, but you will soon be taken completely out of the film as the fine details of the trees and water are contantly swimming with digital compression.  I thought the increased bitrate of HD would eliminate this issue that ruined so many DVD releases over the years...  Maybe they squeezed too much onto a single disc and TCLM suffers in the end?  Completely disappointing.

Yes, I know this is a budget release that can be had for less than $6, and the ""I wasn't expecting Criterion quality"" defense is often tossed around for budget releases like this when a defect is pointed out.  But, come on, this is 2011 and the fact that heavily visible compression is present on a Blu-Ray release is simply unacceptable.  I wanted to write this review because nowhere else online did I see anyone point out the image quality issues, and really wanted to warn people about what they're going to get before they purchase this.  I would definitely be weary of future Mill Creek Blu-Ray titles in the future.  If you're only a fan of Galaxina, I would say go for it, but if you're only buying this for TCLM, you've been warned.",1315612800,9,1617,4.695035460992908
5057148,3,B0075C6F8C,"galaxina is a great sci fi spoof and that's a fact. I would say it's a five star low budgeter, regular critics suck they don't have a seperate scale for horror and sci fi especially low budgeters!
I don't know what critic put this one down but they are bogus. People who hate low budget sci fi shouldn't watch it!  This is just alot of fun really. And dorothy stratten had real screen presence as  she  was just starting out and would have had a long career if her ex boyfriend hadn't murdered her. This story is told in the movie 'star 80' starring Eric Roberts. Anyways this movie is a cult classic by any means and it's got a lot going for it. ONE thing that ISN'T going for it is the print which has lots of dirt and scratches on it. NO attempt was made to fix the defects. The crater lake monsters print looks much better even though the movie is more shlocky for sure.  The crater lake monster is a low budget flick from the same era and it's ok. Actually it's not a classic but a true shlocker movie from the seventies made by locals etc, it's very much not like 'galaxina' which is kick butt ; but I don't care because those type of awkward flicks represented by 'crater lake' have a certain naive charm and they just aren't made anymore.  So that's a plus and it looks decent so grab this one on blu ray but remember the 'galaxina' print is not so hot at this point even though the movie is still a cool one imo. But mill creek should be ashamed of the sad condition of this print.  it's got so many scratches and such in it.  like I said the other movie looks not so bad, this one deserves to be restored too.",1305504000,2,1619,4.15335463258786
5057149,5,B0075C6F8C,"I remember back in the day of the laser disc. I watched Galxina, must have been a 100 times. Each time was something new that I didn't catch before. The reviewer's comments above are correct. The movie is very funny and for it to be a B movie there is more to be expected. I did see vase improvements over the quality of the blu ray compared to laser disc. The picture was sharp, the colors were bright and the audio had been cleaned up a lot.

I bought this movie on DVD format and there are two versions of the movie on DVD format. I have both and I can tell there is much improvement when it comes to blu ray.

This movie is for the people that like to chuckle while watching funny stuff on TV. One funny part comes to mind is when the biker gang praised the motorcycle, ""Harley David-son"". That was funny. I also like the part where Thor gets a shock when kissing the robot angel. I guess that would have fried my brains too. Too bad we lovers of this movie weren't born in that time period. We too, could enjoy the shocking flavors of lipstick if we kissed something like the beautiful robot.

Now, I'm not going to say too much about the uglies... there were plenty to go around at the hooker house.

If you haven't seen the movie, watch it. If you keep an open mind and keep it light; not be too serious, you'll enjoy it.",1302566400,5,1328,4.155642023346304
5057150,4,B0075C6F8C,"The first time many of us watched GALAXINA was on ""Showtime"" in the early 1980's, and for many years after, my taped VHS copy was the only way to see it, a treasured rarity indeed.  The pan & scan laserdisc (another rarity) improved the picture quality somewhat, as did the first edition pan & scan dvd.  The 2005 ""25th Anniversary Special Edition"" widescreen dvd was a real revelation, loaded with special features and finally affording a full widescreen look at this long-lost gem of a movie (even if the ""5.1 audio mix"" was frustratingly botched).  GALAXINA even appeared on the now-defunct HD-DVD format awhile back.

  With big-screen high definition blu-ray home theaters now commonplace, it's about time GALAXINA has finally arrived on blu-ray disc.  On the down side, this blu-ray edition contains none of the many ""Special Features"" included in the 25th Anniversary dvd package.  The plus side, however, more than makes up for it: the version of GALAXINA on this blu-ray is the longer ""International Cut"", previously unseen in the U.S.!  The picture quality looks (obviously) better than ever, and the original sound mix (no 5.1 here) does just fine.

  The 2nd feature, ""Crater Lake Monster"", is not worth reviewing; it will only appeal to fans of ""really bad monster movies"", although I imagine there are quite a few of those out there.  (A much better double-feature would have included VAN NUYS BLVD., the 1979 comedy by Galaxina's director.)

  When this blu-ray was first released, GALAXINA itself, as a movie, took quite a beating from internet critics, the so-called experts from various ""official"" blu-ray disc reviews sites.  I have read two ""bad reviews"" so far, and I have two comments for them, and my comments come straight from Avery Schreiber's immortal ""Captain Butt"":

  -""You got a bad habit, kid: you breathe...""
  -""If a jackass had both your brains, he would be a very dumb jackass!""

  Bottom line: GALAXINA, the best, funniest science fiction parody of them all, has finally arrived in high definition on blu-ray disc, featuring the longer ""International Cut"".  Get it while you can.",1302307200,22,2116,5.025936599423631

 This movie was great, silly funny spoof of outer space movies, too bad it was one of the very few movies that starred Dorothy Stratten, really well done considering its budget and the time it was made
I've always been a cult comedy and sci-fi movie buff, and this has some hilarious scenes, including the colony of space bikers who worship their Lord, ""Ha-Ley David San AH-OOM, AH-OOM."" Rock Eater utters his famous insult at the Captain, and don't forget THE BLUE STAR.
  Galaxina is always calm, cool, shockingly electric in more than just design, and of course there are the typical crew of space cowboys with one who wants to be more than a crewmate with Galaxina, just to mix it up with the hero/heroine approach. I think the director did a wonderful job at corny comedy sci-fi,

5057155,5,B0075C6F8C,"BOTTOM LINE: A seemingly strange pairing of movies that doesn't make much sense until you realize that both were released by Crown International Pictures, the sole link between these two titles. I will confess right up front that I bought this Blu-ray purely for a hi-def version of THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER, a long-time guilty pleasure of mine. (Getting Dorothy Stratten's silly space flick GALAXINA was just icing on an already delicious cake.) Mill Creek's double feature Blu-ray release of GALAXINA and THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER easily scores a rock solid 5 STARS from this B-flick aficionado.

GALAXINA:
This silly flick is a space adventure spoof, done several years before Mel Brooks gave us SPACEBALLS. Watching GALAXINA for the first time in literally decades, I found the laughs a little thin but genuine. The cast seemed to be enjoying themselves and given what looks to be a fairly constrictive budget, the F/X are pretty inventive and ambitious. The late Dorothy Stratten portrays the title android. She is about the most beautiful thing ever. So sad what happened to her. Avery Schreiber, a rotund, mop-topped comedian with a huge mustache who was fairly popular in the 1970's plays Capt. Cornelius Butt. He's probably the best 'actor' of the entire cast, but that's not saying much. The majority of the other actors debuted & disappeared with this one film, and deservedly so. There is some pretty harsh language in this, so be careful about letting the young 'uns screen it without an adult present, if that sort of thing concerns you. The picture & sound quality for GALAXINA are okay but nothing special. There's a noticeable amount of dirt & grit throughout and the sharpness is disappointingly soft. Colors are over-saturated in many scenes and there's heavy color bleeding in several others. Still, it's nice to have this goofy sci-fi parody in a respectable home video edition. Fans of GALAXINA who were hoping for a superior quality high-definition presentation may be somewhat disappointed but it's likely all you're gonna get given the obscurity of the title and the ever-dwindling market for physical home media. :-(

THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER:
Fans of bad cinema, stop-motion visual effects and 1950's type monster movies will find a healthy dose of comfort food with the Blu-ray release of THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER in gorgeous 1080p. Unlike GALAXINA, this film makes maximum use of the high-definition Blu-ray format. The focus throughout the majority of the film is razor-sharp. You can freeze frame and literally count the individual whiskers in actor Glenn Roberts' beard, (not that you'd want to)! Audio is solid and the soundmix is even & level, with no hissing, pops, crackles, fading or drop-outs. Video contains some occasional dirt a& debris, mostly during the opening & end credits. There are instances of pixelation & artifacting but they're infrequent and in no way affect the watchability of the film. The excellent stop-motion monster animation work by David Allen is top-notch and beautiful to behold here in hi-def. Too bad the rest of the film isn't as inventive, well done and interesting. Still, on a ""so bad it's good"" level, this movie rocks. I love the chemistry between Glenn Roberts' character Arnie Chabot and his best friend Mitch Kowalski, played by Mark Siegel. They come across like true lifelong friends and I find the interplay between them genuinely amusing. Lead actor Richard Cardella, (who also helped write the screenplay), makes a decent no-nonsense sheriff, although his biggest challenge in this film appears to be with his uncooperative comb over. The rest of the cast are strictly high school drama class-level actors, but that's okay. This is a low budget monster movie, not the sequel to Citizen Kane. The story is the same old ""prehistoric whatchamacallit runs amok after being awakened from suspended animation"" rubbish that monster movie fans have seen a zillion times before and there are plot holes big enough to jump an 18-wheeler through. But so what? This film is basically an 85 minute love letter to the hey days of the 1950's, when weird monsters ruled the movie screens, believable explanations were few and far between and the ones we did get were usually absurd pseudo science at its best. I love this flick and I've owned it in one form or another for 30+ years: an old VHS that I taped back in my high school days, a couple of DVDs (including a Riff-Trax version which I'll be hanging onto because it's so flippin' funny), and now this glorious Blu-ray. TCLM has a nifty stop-mo critter, some genuine laughs and some beautiful location photography, (the misty shots of the lake are stunning to behold here in hi-def!). Frankly this film looks amazing; better than it has any right to. Kudos to the techs at Mill Creek who oversaw the transfer!",1430784000,2,4824,4.976456009913259

Picture quality is rather variable with scenes inside the ship being soft and slightly blurry except for close-ups which have pretty sharp detail. All of the space scenes outside the ship are pretty sharp. The audio is in good shape with clear dialog that doesn't leave you wondering what was said. Colors range from soft and faded to rich. The best color is in the scenes with the most sharpness which makes sense, I suppose. This is not a film that would be considered for an Oscar, but it certainly has a dedicated following; helped along, I'm sure, by Dorothy Stratten's presence in it. If I were awarding stars purely based on physical beauty I would award the movie five stars for Dorothy; but I have to rate it on the whole package and it just doesn't rate that many stars in my judgment. Well I'm going to kick back and watch the rest of this film and I don't expect to find anything to alter my opinion. It doesn't look like a movie that I'd want to watch more than once.

Shortly after Galaxina was released or right before it was released I don't remember any way. If you enjoy old science fiction movies that are comical as well is having a little bit of suspense and you don't mind the fact that it's a B-movie you will love this and I recommend it to all that enjoy the older science fiction movies, as well as the new ones and just so that I stay consistent.

5057163,4,B0075C6F8C,"I first saw ""Galaxina"" on cable way back in 1980. I was just 13 at the time when she was killed by her insanely jealous husband. From the time I saw her, I have always liked her. To me, she is THE most beautiful playmate that ever graced the centerfold of Playboy. Here in this set, you get the ""International"" version of the movie. There are more scenes than the US Theatrical version. More of Dorothy is ok by me anyday. Although I thought the quality of the bluray could have been better, it is better than the dvd copy I had for a few years put out by Rhino. The US version with ""deleted scenes"" you could select to watch from the menu was the Rhino edition. I liked the movie, for Dorothy, of course, but for the Sci-Fi satire it included in it. The movie itself finds Galaxina and her ship crewmembers searching for a mysterious ""Blue Star"" (I hear the aah ahhh!) in my head right now! The crew get injured in a space battle with Mordrak and then it is up to Galaxina to find it. She does find it on the planet after a brief skirmish with Mordrak and the Harley Davidson gang. Two of the crewmembers venture out to search for Galaxina as she is captured by the Harley Davidson motorbike gang. They free Galaxina and ride out to the ship with the Blue Star in hand.  Galaxina and the Sergeant get together and find out that they CAN indeed have kids as they are in the catalog, too. lol  All is not well though as the Rockmonster slowly eats the Blue Star and then they are forced to return to get more ""where that came from"".

As far as the Crater Lake Monster, forget it. It thought it was boring. At least whenever I look back on Galaxina, I will be thinking of a time in my life when I didn't have any bills to pay or major responsibilities, just 3 month long summers to look forward to!

it has genuine comedy contrasted with the horror of the lake, as 2 types of sequences going on simultaneously. pretty cool, indeed.
the cinematography & scenery is very good also.
Good B movie acting too.....the kind where its not overacted, like some blockbusters, but how real people would act... and well done.
If you like a B flick that makes a serious attempt of being a top quality movie on a mediocre budget then you won't be disappointed here.

Galaxina.... is a good campy flick that isn't as low budget as say... Escape from Galaxy 3.
This film is more like Ice Pirates... a film that is intended to be a comedy, rather than a bad space film that is so ridiculous that you can't take it serious.... Therefore, Galaxina will actually keep your interest while your laughing and smiling, no doubt.

the only thing is that these film are badly paired. they are nothing alike... not even the same genre. i'd rather see Galaxina / Ice Pirates paired together, and The Monster of Crater Lake / The Giant Gila Monster paired together.

Autumn Born has no real dramatic value, but it is priceless for its complete focus on a woman of rare beauty, at once both sensual and lyrical.",1342051200,,518,4.797752808988764
5057179,5,B0075C6F8C,This was a fun few hours. I love bad movies and these did not disappoint. The quality of Galaxina is a bit rough at times but this is an old film and I was not expecting it to be great. As far as the Crater Lake Monster I thought the reproduction to BluRay was great. I'm not sure why the other reviewer had an issue with the compression. I did not see it at all. Great films for the price,1335571200,4,389,3.875
5057180,2,B0075C6F8C,"Galaxina is a strange film famous for its lead actress Dorothy Stratten the Playboy bunny murdered by her boyfriend as told in Star 80. IF not for her I doubt it would be remembered. It is a product of its time and worth watching on that level. Now the Crater Lake Monster is just one of those bad movies that is good for a laugh and makes you wonder why it ever got made in the first place. If you don't find a couple out on a lake in a boat in broad daylight talking about all the stars they see funny, don't watch this one. Makes you wonder why they didn't change the line. But I guess will all the lines like it that should have been changed they should have just don't a re-write. I can watch a bad movie and have fun with it but this one? Perhaps you will have to judge for yourself. Like the title of the review says, it is good for a laugh but you can find better laughs out there.

Galaxina could be an interesting film if you lead into it with Star 80 the movie about Dorothy, played by Mariel Hemingway. It will certainly make it more interesting and at least one of the two movies will be a good one.",1329436800,,1112,4.031674208144796
5057181,4,B0075C6F8C,"After all these years I've finally seen Galaxina--and it certainly has it's moments--some cute ideas, some good lines, halfway decent effects, and Ms. Stratton certainly was beautiful. But over the years I've heard so many glowing reviews of this film, how wonderful/sexy/etc. Dorothy Stratton was in it that, in contrast to all the hype I'd heard, I found it to be rather pedestrian. Some I'd talked to made it sound like a non-stop softcore porn orgy on the order of Flesh Gordon (what were _they_ watching?) rather than the mild-mannered fare it is. Still and all I did enjoy it. I think Mill Creek did the best they could with the print they had. It looks great for its age (obviously no one really took great care of the original elements). The Crater Lake Monster is one I'd seen at the drive-in way back when it came out. It was a guilty pleasure then & still is today. In terms of good goofy fun I place it right up there with The Giant Spider Invasion. I do love me some cheesy stop-motion dinosaur-rampage flicks--especially when the effects are provided by Dave Allen, Randall Cook, Phil Tippett & Jim Danforth! The film transfer looks great! I don't know about the folks who complained of problems with over-compression and pixilation artifacts, but the disc I received was sharp throughout. It is a bare-bones disc but I found it to be worth every penny. My opinion of the movies is: 3 stars for Galaxina. 4 stars for The Crater Lake Monster. And for the overall package: 4 stars.",1325635200,2,1493,4.637735849056604

8510550,5,B0075C6F8C,"Galaxina is notable for Playboy Playmate Dorothy Stratten, and that makes this movie a classic in my opinion, since this is her only major movie. Crater Lake Monster is enjoyable, as it has subtle comedic moments, and it really isn't a horror movie. Much more sci-fi than horror. I watched both movies multiple times within first weeks of owning it. As for HD format, it just makes the flaws of film more visible, the scratches or whatever, the snow, in old films.",1489104000,,464,4.670731707317073
8510551,4,B0075C6F8C,"Let me start out by stating that judging by the definition of what makes a good film, both ""Galaxina"" (1980) and ""The Crater Lake Monster"" (1977) are pretty bad. But judged as cheesy popcorn flicks they each have their own merits. You do have to have both an appreciation & tolerance for so bad it's great cinema to get any enjoyment out of this budget bluray double feature.

""Galaxina"" was intended to be a sexy send up of most sci-fi tropes up to that point including ""Star Wars"", ""Star Trek"", & even ""Alien"" while also mixing in some western elements too. It is most notable for starring gorgeous Playboy playmate Dorothy Stratten who was tragically murdered by her husband just a little over a month after the film's release in 1980. The humor is too obvious and it tries too hard to be edgy in terms of some of the sexual content as the film did have the luxury of being R rated. Scenes drag on for interminable lengths. However the cast does their best and it does feature some impressive at times model work. Most will check this movie out though to see Dorothy Stratten strut her stuff and in that respect it delivers. She looks amazing throughout in her skin tight and revealing outfits. I should also mention that this bluray release features the longer 95 minute international cut.

""The Crater Lake Monster"" is only remembered for featuring some impressive stop motion animation from David W. Allen. Outside of that it is pretty bad. However with the right frame of mind it can also be a lot of fun if you enjoy making fun of bad movies like Mystery Science Theater 3000.

As for the visual quality of this bluray, surprisingly there are no visible compression artifacts despite both films sharing a 25gb single layer bluray. ""Galaxina"" is presented in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio at 1080p while ""The Crater Lake Monster"" is at 1.78:1 but at 1080i. Both look good though ""Galaxina"" features some itermittent print damage throughout along with some slightly washed out black levels and colors here and there. The print used for ""The Crater Lake Monster"" was in better shape surprisingly. Detail is solid and skin tones look natural. For some reason each film gets 3 audio option with one being lossy and the other two being lossless 2 channel options. A bit too thin sounding but serviceable.

No extras are included for either film. There also are no English subtitles for the hearing impaired.

For a budget title from Mill Creek Entertainment, this is indeed a fun one. While both films are definitely subpar, they are still a lot of fun despite their many flaws. Video quality is surprisingly solid and the price is right.",1475280000,4,2643,4.712121212121212
