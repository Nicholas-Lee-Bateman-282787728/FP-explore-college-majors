8281931,5,B000AXEY54,I really like this tape it's a video but I still own a vcr. It is very through and it's very short. You can add this to one your short workout routines. It really works. It's like old school gym class. The exercise are simple and easy but they work. There are a couple that might be diffcult but with pactice even those get easier. It is really an excellent ab workout.,1361923200,,369,4.138888888888889
