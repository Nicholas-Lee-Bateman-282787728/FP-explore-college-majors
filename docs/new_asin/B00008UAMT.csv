It's still considered laughing at people's misfortions though, surprised these guys did atleast one good deed and that was in the trading boxes part.

If you've seen Bumfights, this is pretty much the same except it doesn't have any fights. Would not really recommend this to people who are easily offended.",1389571200,,449,4.907894736842105
8439393,3,B00008UAMT,"I was looking for bum fights and thought this was some kind of ""knock off"" off it but it wasnt. It is kinda funny, but just not what I was looking for.",1202428800,,151,3.75
8439394,1,B00008UAMT,"This isn't ""people's misfortunes"", this is criminal assault and a hate crime.  There is nothing funny about this at all and anyone who finds it funny is a sociopath.  For those who don't know, this video is about young teenage males going out and video taping themselves as they humiliate and physically injure other human beings who are no different than these teens other than the fact that they don't have Mommy and Daddy's house to move back into when they can't cut the real world.  Many of these people are the real ones working the jobs Americans don't want to do and don't want to pay enough to help them afford a place to live.  Others have no choice but to live on the street when their military pensions, their social security disability incomes, etc. won't help them cover a roof over their heads even though they may have given everything up for their country and their families.  Amazon shouldn't even be allowing this filth to be sold here and the feds should be looking for and prosecuting the human excrement who created this in the first place.",1184025600,4,1062,4.597883597883598
8439395,5,B00008UAMT,this was one of the funniest things i've ever seen!  from naming the bums species type to trading boxes. i couldn't stop laughing at the goofy stuff these guys do. bumhunts was great.  not recommended for people who can't laugh at other peoples misfortunes.  i guarantee if you buy it you won't regret it!,1078617600,4,305,4.611111111111111
