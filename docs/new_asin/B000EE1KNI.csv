2517305,5,B000EE1KNI,"As several other reviewers have mentioned, this is a harder workout than Art of Strength's Providence and Firepower workouts.  If you're new to KB training, you should probably start with Providence (which was re-filmed with soap opera star Beth Chamberlin as The Kettlebell Way, Vol. 1; Providence and The KB Way are the same workout) and eventually work your way up to this one.  While Anthony does break the moves down and there is an instructional segment that you can watch before doing the workout, it would be helpful to already know proper form for things like windmills, snatches, etc.

Whereas Providence doesn't get my heart rate up too much, this one does in most of the segments.  I also like how each round is followed by one minute of ab work.  By the time you finish this workout, you'll feel as if every muscle group has been worked!  This one kicks my rear end every time I do it, but I also feel so accomplished afterwards.  It's fun and has great music, and Anthony is a terrific instructor.  Highly recommended!",1227052800,10,1032,4.662983425414365
2517306,5,B000EE1KNI,"I purchased this DVD after falling in love with AOS Providence. This workout is by far much more difficult. I work up a major sweat! I love Anthony's style of training which involves both cardio and strength training, with a major focus on strengthening the core. I wouldn't recommend this DVD for first-time kettlebell users, but if you feel comfortable enough with AOS Providence and are looking for more of a challenge, this would logically be the next step. I prefer this to AOS Firepower (the filming on Firepower is much less professional and it kind of irritates me after seeing it over and over again).",1219363200,7,610,4.764150943396227
2517307,5,B000EE1KNI,"I train with kettlebells in conjunction with spinning and either running or using an Eliptical Trainer.  With Kettlebells I've noticed that even though I may be in good shape cardio-wise, I will still get out of breath doing Kettlebell exercises, whether it occurs midway or near the end, I normally always feel like I got a harder workout.

Between this DVD and the Providence series, I would pick Providence as the most beginner friendly, and Newport as the more difficult-advanced series.  Whereas I can do almost all the Providence exercises, other than the windmill squat, without too much difficulty, there were several Newport exercises that I found quite difficult.

I'll have to post a follow up in about 4-6 months to see how well I've progressed with my training, but as of now this DVD is something for me to aspire for.",1199750400,17,832,4.838028169014085
2517308,5,B000EE1KNI,"I will not do a thorough break down of this workout, because the previous poster did an excellent job breaking down this workout.

This workout is from a female's perspective:

Anthony's Art of Strength workouts are by far the best kettlebell workouts on the market to date.  The production, music, and format of his workouts are all excellent. The music options, practice chapter, and out takes, add to the quality of these DVDs.

I have all three of Anthony's workouts, and all of them have blown me away. I'll break them down from the easiest to the hardest.

Easiest-AOS Providence. For me personally, this is the near perfect workout.  I'm so glad that I did this workout first, because I fell in love with Anthony's training style.

AOS Firepower-I find this workout to be between Providence and Newport.  This workout does require two kettlebells during some of the exercises, so if you don't have pairs, this might not be doable for you.

AOS Newport-The first time I did this workout I was shocked at how hard this workout is.  I work out at home, and I have a VAST collection of workouts. This is by far the most difficult workout in my collection. I'm just happy that this wasn't my first workout by Anthony.  If it had been, I never would have done another workout, which would have been a shame, because I'm telling all of you, the AOS workouts are the best.

Kettlebell DVDs are extremely expensive, and I have a few that are not worth their price tag.  The AOS DVDs are worth every single penny!",1187049600,60,1510,4.58955223880597
2517309,5,B000EE1KNI,"I'm writing this is part to respond to the other review, but also because I really like this and the other Art of Strength video (Newport - check out the reviews of that video - I haven't gotten the AOS Firepower one yet).  Yes, Anthony doesn't do a lot of explaining how to do the exercises.  If you want more basic understanding, check out Pavel's Enter the Kettlebell book or his DVDs (Russian Kettlebell Challenge being a good one).  There are also a number of internet sources for exercise pointers.

That being said, after you've gotten instruction from a video, book and/or internet, some folks like me want a follow along video.  I did my share of swings, get ups, etc. but there's something about having to calibrate yourself to an advanced person's pace that helps me stick to a regieme.  This series is definitely one of the better ones I've come across that does that.  You can't watch the instructional kettlebell videos over and over and get a workout out of them.

Ther are a couple of good things about this video:

1) It's comprehensive.  There are a number of leg exercises and core exercises.  This video has more variation and core exercises than AOS Providence.  To give you an idea, the 5th set is side snatch/ overhead lunge/ side plank.  (Eventually, I'd like to see one that goes ""swings, specific exercise, swings or snatches, specific exercsise etc."")

2) He has a good idea of the time.  In some of these videos, it's meant to be 1 minute rest + 2 minutes exercise, but because of a long verbal introduction it becomes 1 minute rest + 1 minute explanation + 1 minute exercise.  Anthony seems to clip the rest period screen a little short if there's going to be a longer intro to the exercise, so the total equals what it's supposed to be.

3) The 4 section time counter on the left side of the screen and the 5-4-3-2-1 exercise sequence motivates me, keeps me going, and allows me to check my progress.  I have an Excel spreadsheet that tracks how much of an exercise I do if I poop out, how many exercises I do, etc.

4) I like the fact that my DVD's skip function brings me to the next exercise, not to the end of the workout.  So if I'm pressed for time, I can do all the leg exercises, for example.

5) It's a very structured exercise series, so if you want to substitute something similar, you can.  There's not an example on this disk, but on the AOS Providence, I do the chest press on the ball and do 1 minute of one side and 1 minute of the other rather than switching sides, but I still calbrate my pace to his.

6) Anthony is mindful of safety.  Again, the best example is from AOS Providence where some of the more 'accident prone' exercises like one-legged deadlift and Windmills are done slowly with Anthony reminding you to keep it at a reasonable pace.

There's nothing I can say that's truly negative about this video, but I can note some things for improvement or if they are important to a reader:

He could explain things a little better, even in a pithy way.  If you follow the recommendation and get familar with kettlebells from an instructiuonal video, book, or website, this won't be a problem.

He could use the ""rest period"" screens to note exercise pointers like other videos do.  Sometimes reminders help.

There are some 'rah rah' trainers, and Anthony's not one of them.  He says a number of encouraging things each exercise set, but don't expect a cheerleader.  I like things that way, some folks may not.

The other thing to mention is that, for me, the AOS Providence (his other video) is probably more basic and traditionally kettlebell-ish. I for one like the variety and core exercises, but some folks starting out might like the other video better as a starter video.

In conclusion, try kettlebells, using homemade equipment if you have to.  Once you get hooked on them like everyone else is, get this video or Anthony's other video.",1174348800,41,3900,4.530758226037196

8108757,5,B000EE1KNI,I own all three Art of Strength DVD workouts but this one is by far the most challenging. There are a total of 8 rounds in the workout with an optional bonus round at the end of the workout. The entire workout takes around 45 minutes to complete. There is no formal warm up or cool down but the first and last rounds include some warm up and cool down type exercises. The workout shows the time left in each exercise and the instructor completes the entire workout. The instructor isn't annoying or overbearing and the production is decent. This is the most difficult of the Art of Strength workouts. The Art of Strength Firepower falls somewhere in the middle as far as difficulty but its also the shortest and it requires 2 kettle bells. The Art of Strength Providence is the easiest of the three but it's also the longest at about 1 hour. I rotate this workout into my workout schedule every other week which I've done for around 1 year now. I can definitely tell that my strength and endurance have increased though I can't keep up with the instructor on every exercise and I rarely have enough energy to complete the bonus round at the end. It's a great workout that I would easily recommend.,1481500800,4,1197,4.470319634703197
8108758,5,B000EE1KNI,"Great workout dvd.  If you have a kettle bell and are looking for a tough, tough workout, this is the one to get.  (I have an adjustable kettle bell and use the 16 pound setting for this workout.

So, the guy is doing the workout outside on the street by a van and people are walking by.  Sounds hokey, right?  It's not.

The workout is broken into rounds and you can get a great workout, even if you don't go all the way through. There's a timer on the side of the screen, which shows where you are in the round.  I think almost each round is followed by a one-minute abs round and then a deserved one-minute rest.  The instructor's commentary is pretty basic.  But that's fine.

It's so difficult to find an intense kettle bell workout dvd, so I was happy to get this at a fair price.  Recommended but not for the faint of heart.",1429574400,,831,4.19620253164557
8108759,5,B000EE1KNI,This is a great DVD for people who have been using kettlebells for about a year and are looking to kick it up a bit.,1429488000,,116,3.68
8108760,5,B000EE1KNI,This workout is the hardest in my opinion.  But it is worth the effort.  Anthony is a master at kettlebell workouts. Just make sure you are rested before beginning this one and prepare to be throughly impressed!,1428883200,,211,4.675675675675675

8108762,2,B000EE1KNI,"The disc skipped during the 2nd phase of the workout, I have to skip almost all of the 2nd phase because it gets stuck and it's not playable. All in all the work out was great. The condition of the disc, not so much.",1369267200,2,216,3.9318181818181817
8108763,5,B000EE1KNI,"I have waited for over nine months to write this review because I wanted to ensure that I was able to provide feedback that was not based on the excitement of starting a new workout routine. I was first introduced to Anthony Diluglio's Firepower DVD by a coworker. I watched the DVD and wrote down the workout routine and started doing it once a week at my local gym. I worked for six months eventually building up to working the Firepower routine two to three times per week. I then branched out and purchased his Providence DVD. This shocked my system because it moved from working each exercise for one minute each, as in Firepower, to two minutes per exercise. However, I was able to get through it nonstop the first go around even though it was challenging; I attribute getting through Providence on day one to having taken six months to build a solid base with Firepower. After working Providence for three months I again branched out and purchased Newport. Newport is awesome! Talk about a shock to the system. Each workout set is four to five minutes including a one minute set of abs; thankfully I had that strong base built through Firepower. Getting through Newport is still a struggle and requires a little more mental toughness than Firepower and Providence. I do have to use a lighter KB for some of the Newport exercise but I know eventually I'll build to where I'm using the same weight KB for all of Newport.

The above method is what worked for me and I provide it to hopefully encourage others interested in pursuing KB workouts a good starting point. I cannot emphasize enough though the importance of starting out slowly, working at your own pace, and building a solid base focusing primarily on developing your core strength. Of note is that I also lost 35 pounds during that first six months (245 to 210; I'm 6 ft. 4 in. for height/weight reference purposes); I'm still dropping weight too. This is in part due to three major lifestyle changes: (1) I quit drinking alcohol; (2) I reduced my sugar intake, to include natural sugars, to less than 20 grams per day (if you think this is hard the book `The Belly Fat Cure: Discover the New Carb Swap System and Lose 4 to 9 lbs. Every Week' by Jorge Cruise can help); (3) I started working out five days per week (Mon - cardio, Tue - strength training, Wed - cardio, Thur - cross training, Fri - cardio).

As far as Anthony Diluglio is concerned, I could not ask for a better virtual personal trainer. He does go through some tutorials for some of his exercises which I do recommend watching as it will help with form and prevent injury; all-in-all though he expects that you will come with some sort of knowledge of KB strength training on how to do exercises properly. Even if you are just starting out, as long as you take it slow and at your own pace, you can easily follow along with him during each routine and the changing camera angles really help capture the nuances of each exercise. Again, start out slow and build that solid base focusing on keeping your core tight during each exercise!

Currently, my workout rhythm for strength training in general is on a monthly cycle with one hard strength training workout each week. Week one is the Providence followed up with a run through Firepower. Week two is the Newport routine again followed up with a run through Firepower. Week three is the Firepower routine walking up the five set pyramid and then working down through the same pyramid taking my rest at the pyramid's top. Week four is a rest from KBs and I do the CrossFit Filthy Fifty (or Dirty Thirty if I'm not feeling up to par; Dirty Thirty is the same thing as Filthy Fifty but just 30 sets of each exercise). Recall that I spent over six months building a solid base, focusing on core strength, before being able to get to this point of regular, injury free strength training. Take it slow folks and build that core!

I hope that Anthony Diluglio keeps making workout DVDs. I will buy them every time over any other workout DVD out there. They might be a little pricey but it is worth every penny if you are willing to invest your time in improving your physical fitness and your body in general.",1368489600,10,4186,4.525759577278732
8108764,5,B000EE1KNI,"This was different (better) than I expected. The instructor can make or break the workout in my opinion. Anthony Diluglio is super-friendly, his cueing is excellent. I prefer to work out with female instructors (I'm female) and have not found many DVDs with male instructors that motivate me, but this guy is just awesome. So pleasant and likeable, yet no nonsense at the same time. The music is good and the workout is actually fun to do. Because of some of the reviews I was hesitant to try it, thinking it would be impossibly hard. I was torn between getting Providence and Newport and finally decided I would get Newport. I'm so glad I did. This is an interesting circuit-style workout using one kettlebell. Each cycle goes through two kettlebell exercises, 1 minute each, then 1 minute of abdominals, then 1 minute rest (I sometimes do jumping jacks or kicks and jabs during the rest for extra cardio if I have the energy). It is fast paced but flows well and is pretty easy to follow. It is definitely challenging but if you have some kettlebell experience and you're used to the intensity of Cathe Friedrich or Angie Miller you can do this. If you're familiar with Ilaria Montagnani's Atletica, or Paul Katami's Kettlebell Kombos or Drills you will probably like this too. My only gripe is that there is no real warmup or stretch, but I just do it on my own. I definitely recommend this DVD!",1290297600,4,1398,4.641129032258065
8108765,5,B000EE1KNI,"I just got a kettelbell set for Christmas and got this DVD because all the other reviews said this is the most advanced.  I haven't done kettlebells before now, but have lifted heavy weights for several years and usually do advanced workouts.  I think this is great for anyone who is used to doing an advanced workout that likes to incorporate tough full body movements.

I've been using this now for a year every week and there is still one exercise that I cannot complete.  This is a fantastic workout and I hope Anthony comes out with one more advanced than this!",1265760000,2,566,4.519607843137255
8108766,5,B000EE1KNI,"All I can say is, if you haven't tried it you ought to.  It's not for the beginner but if you're a beginner who knows form and are daring...Go for it!  Great workout and I love the ab work (active rest) in between each set.",1264550400,4,223,3.933333333333333
