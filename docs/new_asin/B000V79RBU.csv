2931595,5,B000V79RBU,"Okay, this is where I admit I went into this movie with some mild trepidation due to the fact I'm not a fan of Mr. Khan at all. It isn't because of his controversy-filled life, his shattered love affairs, or even the fact he can't really dance well. It's just that he lacks sincerity and conviction in his acting style. I'm always struck with the impression that he's just showing off! Still, Mr. Bhansali is a true artist and I believed that if anyone could cut through the bravado of his leading man it would be him. After all, he's probably the only other man in Bollywood with a more fragile ego.

So half-way through the movie I realize that Mr. Bhansali didn't bother to curb the bravado at all, but he does manage to make it work for the movie. He turns it into a kind of ""Peter Pan"" quality. Sameer goes through life thinking that since he's a great guy, whatever makes him happy will eventually come to him without him having to do much for it. I don't mean that in a bad way, there are people who go through life like that, and it works. Some people don't have to grow up. But some people do, and that's where we get the REAL story.

Nandini: the role that took Aishwarya Rai from ""Miss World"" starlet, to top Bollywood heroine. She's what we call in my part of the world, 'A real Spitfire!' If Sameer is Peter Pan, she's Tinkerbelle. Tempestuous, stubborn joyful, with moods that shift like the wind she embodies that period of life where every joy is an extreme high, and every disappointment is a devastating low. Hey we all go through it... this is her story from a sheltered spoiled girl, to real womanhood. It's a painful journey, and a deceptively simple role.

Nothing about growing up, and learning that life and love isn't the paradise well-loved children perceive it as is simple. Acting that out onscreen for a director like Mr. Bhansali must be even harder. What makes it all work is that under all the opulence, melodrama, and sensory overload of a Bhansali film, is the fact that Miss Rai lives in the moment with her character, making even the most dramatic moments feel real. She's not concerned with presenting Nandini as an idealized woman. She lets the flaws out, making no apologies when Nanindi is rude, cruel, and downright unlikeable. Granted, those moments don't last long, but they also serve to highlight her goodness when she takes responsibility for them.

Granted, she's photographed exquisitely, given the best costumes and makeup, and never allowed to appear as anything less than ""the most beautiful woman in the world,"" but even with all that, and under the direction of a demanding artist, it's up to her to make the audience to root for Nandini, and in my opinion she does that. No, this isn't her greatest performance but it is fascinating to watch her evolution as an actress. Just taking her three movies with Bhansali and you can see the way she's worked to always move forward in her craft. Watch this film, and then watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guzaarish-English-Subtitles/dp/B004IM2M70/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guzaarish (English Subtitles)</a>&nbsp;I think you'll be amazed by what you find.

Unfortunately, due to real life getting a little too mixed up with art Mr. Ajay Devgn often gets the short-stick of praise for this film. I can't understand it, he's the most important character in the narrative. Without Vanraj, Nandini has no journey. Usually, the antagonist of a narrative is a villain, but the real function of an antagonist is simply to propel the protagonist, (Nandini) to their evolution. He's the heart of the film exemplifying the simple truth, love is truth, respect, and sacrifice! While Sameer is all flash and little substance, Vanraj is all substance and very little flash. That isn't to say Mr. Devgn lacks charisma, I personally feel he has more charisma than many actors, but his power comes through his ability to mold himself into a character. I cannot understand why he bothers with the inane Masala films at all! He should stick to roles like this and his amazing performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Satyagraha-DVD/dp/B00FVCNTTG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Satyagraha (DVD)</a>

As always the music and visuals of a Bhansali film will dazzle and bewitch you. Did I have an issue with substituting Hungry with Italy? Yeah I did. Why? I'm one-third Italian! Still, what bothered me more was the complete disregard for human anatomy that Bollywood insists on displaying whenever a character is ill or injured. Seriously, I'm utterly appalled by the disinterest in portraying any aliment with even a hint of accuracy. It's the one insanely glaring flaw in the film.

All in all, I still think Salman Khan is all flash NO substance as an actor, but with the right director it isn't UNBAREABLE. This movie is about the difference between first passion and true love and it does that justice.",1384905600,6,4976,4.9879518072289155

2931598,5,B000V79RBU,"These bollywood movies are so long that to even give a proper review you have to write a long review to make sense for a viewer.

Another well-respected family with many girls that have to be promised to another family in marriage. The promised husband was spell-bound with his intended wife, and at the time, he was like a nerd and shy. He was a lawyer who had lost all of his cases in court.  His Father was a well-known prominent attorney with a big lawfirm. He saw Nandini and he was spellbound, while she was dancing at her sister's wedding.

An Italian, Sameer came to them to learn how to sing and dance as they do. He was a guest in their house and took her bedroom and she did not like it. However, they eventually fell in love and she wanted to marry him and he, her. But it did not work out like that. A man can't touch a female in India unless they are married. They can't hug them, feel or put their hands on them, and he did all that. He broke all the rules and when they find out, he was band from the house and sent home to Italy.

Nandini was upset, crying, Sameer was upset, and leaving. They love from afar. But Father promised Nandini to Vanraj, son of the prominent lawyer. The marriage took place and she was very unhappy. Never consumated their marriage in sex and love, and they slept on opposite sides of the bed. She would not even talk to her new husband.

Finally, a servant of her family came with some letters from Sameer, her lover, and she read them. One blew around the room and when her husband came in, he saw one of them and read it.  Then the argument began, but she would not say or defend anything.  He told her in the beginning, that the one thing he hated more was a liar. Never to lie to him, so he was furious when he saw the letters.

He then decided to take her to her lover in Italy. If she did not love him, then she should not have a miserable life nor he. He told his Father, who disagreed with the plan but gave his blessings to him to do what he think best, and take her to her lover and make her happy.  That her being happy will make him happy.

His sister said to him and the wedding of her sister when Nandini danced, that he was a good man and had a good heart, and that maybe he could have her, but he disagreed, saying that she would not look at a man like him. He was withdrawn, and like a young boy at that wedding, and spellbound in her beauty, speechless he was.

They went to Italy looking for Sameer, and missing him at ever place by minutes. They found where he lived, went there, met his mother, and she told where he would be. Mom even knew who Nandini was, said Sameer talks about her all the time. She was getting glad to see him and it would be over, but it did not work out like that.

I was surprised at the ending of the movie, but I guess it was the right one. She finally got to be with and see Sameer at the Opera House where he was going to perform that night...however, the love of her husband to help her get to the man that she really loved changed her mind about her nerdy husband.  He was not such a nerd anymore.

You see, they tried to catch a bus Sameer was on and flagged a ride from some people and they got robbed, wife got shot, had to flag another ride down to get her to the hospital, the lost all their money, had no money to pay for hospital bills; he had to give up his wedding ring, and she gave her to pay the bills.

As he did all these things for his wife and was beaten by the robbers, and all he went thru to save her from dying, she began to realize that he was a really good man and love her so much that he did all these things for her to make her happy.

In the end....I can't tell you that.  You are going to have to see the movie to see this ending, because it is one to behold.  I was even shocked at this one.

But Sameer....was full of tears crying.  Was it of happy and joy to be with his beloved Nandini or was it for something else.  You have to see it to find out.

Truly a must see movie.  Such deep love.  They really love deep in India. Wish that was here in the USA.  Hard to find it these days.

Love it.",1341100800,3,4122,3.9841849148418493

2931601,5,B000V79RBU,"To be fair, this is the second Bollywood movie I've ever watched and one that I only bought because of one dance scene. I'm a big fan of Aishwarya Rai who stars as Nandiri, daughter of a well-respected singer. An Italian named Sameer comes to intern with him and falls heads over heels in love with Nandiri.

The dances scenes are reminiscent of Busby Berkley, with overhead shots, lots of color (not applicable to Berkeley, seeing as in his times, it was all in black and white) and great choreography. It's worth buying just for the dancing.

If you like a lot of soap opera-type drama (beautiful heroine, dashing leading man, lovers' plight in a tradition-laden world, complete with a bitter and evil auntie), this is a very entertaining option. Plus it comes with subtitles in five different languages, including Spanish and Japanese!",1266451200,16,838,4.853146853146853

Not only beyond belief beautiful sets, costumes, people, storyline, dancing and playfulness balanced with depth of the story; and the genius & incomparable excellence of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's movie creations, but it is such an unexpected love story. Don't give up 1/2 way through when she gets sad and things take a nose-dive. Believe me, this story is a watch-til-the-end masterpeice. Hope you enjoy it, too.",1425081600,,574,4.75
2931635,1,B000V79RBU,"The DVD by Eros is very disappointing.
Awful audio with hissing all over (none of the previous versions have this issue). Greenish pink tinges throughout the movie, which gives the colorful movie such a dull and ugly look you can't forgive.

As if all that is not bad, they have crammed in their hideous logo.

Their discs are sub-par, as horrendous as pirates.

So, people, please don't support Eros's crap work and don't buy their products (not Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, at least)

Look for the Digital Entertainment inc. (DEi) version, Bollywood Entertainment (BE or BEi) version, Video Sound (one with a black cover. Not white!) and even the English version ""Straight From The Heart"" and promote their quality work.

Avoid the Eros, Shemaroo, Video Sound (white cover) and Spark versions of this movie.

2931639,4,B000V79RBU,"This one is hard to put down in words.. i have a hard time with two heroes or two heroines in one film, because someone always loses out, this was no exception! And i already knew going in who it was, but then it's hard to get invested in the love story when you know that that's not who she ends up with! That being said this was a really good movie.. Aish plays a very fiesty spirited young woman who is her father's pride and joy. Salman's character comes to stay with her family to learn music from her father. She has a huge family and the scenes between everyone together makes you crave for a huge family like that.. but ofcourse no family is perfect!

Aish does not welcome his coming as this means she has to give up her room, but salman's sweet playful nature wins her over in the end. they soon become friends and friendship turns into love.....

Then enters Ajay's character who sees her singing at a wedding and is instantly smitten... this is where the story takes a turn... while salman is wooing her right under her family's nose, ajay comes to her family with a proposal... the correct indian way of doing things... This is when i started to not enjoy the movie as much because you see where the characters went wrong and where they could have made better choices and perhaps the outcome would have been different.... but it's bollywood there has to be a little drama and sadness!!

You can see as the story progresses her love at the beginning is a young first girl love and her love for ajay comes from maturity and wisdom..

When it ended i was not suprised and not really disapointed but was still left not quite sure how i really felt towards this movie... the chemistry between all three characters was not super strong either which also made it hard.... the idealist in me wanted her to stay true to her first love.. but the realistic logical side said that ajay was the kinder, caring, more mature choice.... again torn and confused!! So i guess if your a fan of salman's and aish than watch it and decide for yourself!!!",1398902400,,2046,4.404761904761905

8217031,5,B000V79RBU,"Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (Straight From the Heart) is a beautiful movie that draws you into a world of lush romance and bittersweet endings. I guess I'm a sucker for romance after all.  There are several scenes in this film that will flat out make women cry and the menfolk surreptitiously reach for a hanky or a dirty sleeve. Watching this film was truly a heady, eye-opening experience.

Skip this paragraph unless you're into being SPOILED. The plot revolves around the daughter of a classical singer named Nandini (the gorgeous Aishwarya Rai).  She falls for her father's carefree half-Italian student, Sameer (Salman Khan).  Vanraj (Ajay Devgan), son of a famous lawyer and a lawyer himself, sees and falls in love with Nandini and sends his proposal to Nandini's father, which is accepted. Nandini's father learns of her and Sameer's romance and demands that Sameer forget Nandini.  Vanraj marries Nandini and it's not until later in the marriage that he finds out that she still loves Sameer.  Vanraj, out of love for his wife, takes Nandini to Italy to reunite her with her Sameer.

Just now, having read what I'd written in the previous paragraph, I tell you my words fail to do justice to the actual movie. The plot description above is flat and cold and abrupt compared to the rich tapestry that make up the narrative.  It has so much heart and genuine emotions that, watching it, you feel you're breathing or soaking in every moment directly into your soul.  Very dramatic, I know, but, hey, it's how I feel.

That the movie is 3 hours long shouldn't detract anyone from watching it. Go ahead, it won't seem that long.  The song numbers are across-the-board great. My two personal favorites are ""Nimbooda"" (the sour lime) wherein Vanraj falls in love with Nandini and the title song, ""Hum Dil De Chuke"", a lovely, forlorn love ballad.  By the way, yes, the scenes in Italy were actually shot in Hungary and no one's really fooling anyone here but I beg you, don't let that be a deterrent.

The acting performances are superb, as they would have to be to elicit this kind of response from them viewers.  The three leads are very good. This is where Aishwarya Rai first flexed her acting muscles, as she goes thru a whole gamut of emotions, from the innocence and blithe happiness of a child to the mature, more subtle nuances that come with her acceptance of adulthood. She is, as ever, as luminous as the stars in the sky. This is my first sighting of Ajay Devgan and I'm sold on him as an actor. He may just make you cry.  Salman Khan is convincing as the free-spirited Sameer and you could see how a young girl could easily fall for this charming fella. He does a good job at the end of the movie when...well, I won't say.

Here in the states, where the emphasis is on box office instead of artistry, 90% of the films are shallow, crass and formulaic. I am rarely exposed to movies such as this, that resonates and transports you to an exotic, seemingly more meaningful place and draws out deeper, richer emotions than those elicited from viewing a buddy cop movie.  This movie achingly throbs with images and concepts of duty, self-sacrifice, quiet faithfulness, and the meaning of true love. Dear viewer, watch this movie, you may get swept away. You can thank me later.  Now, I'm back to watching Sportscenter because, while I am a sensitive guy, I do have an image to uphold.",1451952000,,3391,4.632721202003339
