7339818,5,B011PS51LI,"Boris Karloff made some of the greatest horror movies of all time during the early 1930's at Universal Studios. Timeless classics like Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and The Mummy. He was often paired with Bela Lugosi, the studios other great horror actor, in films like The Raven and The Black Cat.

Karloff however, also starred in some entertaining films for several other studios like Warner Brothers, Gaumont - British, Monogram, RKO, and Columbia Pictures.

This excellent set features six films he made for Columbia during the 30's and 40's. They are typically very short, running about 70 minutes each, but immensely entertaining and fun to watch.

The best of the bunch is the Black Room from 1935, he has a dual role as twin brothers, one good, one evil. This easily matches his best work at Universal and Boris delivers not one, but two great performances! Most of the other films have similar themes...

Karloff typically portrays a mild mannered doctor/scientist who has been wronged in some way. Karloff eventually transforms into a ""mad scientist"" seeking revenge on those who have scoffed at him, or perhaps he's trying to revive the dead or connect with the supernatural.

The final film, The Boogie Man Will Get You, is a comedy. Once again Karoff is an eccentric scientist with Peter Lorre as his side-kick giving him a helping hand with his experiments. Boogie Man reminded me a lot of Arsenic and Old Lace, which Lorre also starred in with Cary Grant.

The six movies are presented on two single sided discs, the image quality is great and there are no noticeable compression issues.
The entire running time is 6 hours 43 minutes.
This is an exceptional DVD presenting some of Boris Karloff's best work. Highly Recommended!",1447718400,33,1750,4.9353741496598635

7339844,4,B011PS51LI,"Great B pictures starring Boris usually as a demented scientist. The films span the thirties and early forties. The last one is a comedy. The Black Room is the darkest and best, with the great Karloff playing murderous twin brothers.

No special features unfortunately. Each film runs a little more than an hour, the longest at 75 minutes.",1509235200,2,339,4.844827586206897
7339845,5,B011PS51LI,"The Black Room is a supreme treat for Boris Karloff fans. In this film Karloff plays not one, not two, but three characters that aren't misunderstood monsters - sans makeup! - so his wonderful expressive face and peerless elocution are allowed to shine to the utmost.

The story entails twin brothers, one good, one not so, born beneath a family curse : the younger twin shall murder the elder within the confines of the mysterious Black Room hidden inside the family's baronial castle.

Gregor the elder is a despot who kidnaps and has his way, murderously, with the local peasantry's wives and daughters. Anton, one minute younger than his brother, is a kindly, cultured traveler and gentleman, afflicted at birth with a crippled arm.

Anton returns to the castle for a visit and refuses to believe the sordid tales told of his brother Gregor. Anton, the antithesis of Gregor, is quickly befriended by all. Including Thea Hassel (Marian Marsh) the lovely young niece of Col. Paul Hassel (Thurston Hall) of another prominent family in the area. Gregor desires Thea to be his Baroness. Thea loves dashing Lt. Albert Lussan (Robert Allen) and is repulsed by Gregor's unsavory advances.

Mashka (a darkly bewitching Katherine DeMille) wants Gregor for herself. She boldly follows him to his castle one evening and is never seen again. The locals mob the castle intent on wreaking vengeance upon the villainous Gregor once and for all. To save his skin, Gregor cleverly decides to pass authority to his younger brother Anton. However, Gregor takes on Anton's identity instead. Thus the third character undertaken by Boris Karloff. Gregor as Anton.

The Black Room was produced by Robert North with Karloff on lend from Universal. Too bad Universal didn't more readily utilize Karloff in a likewise manner, throwing off makeup and monsters in favor of psychological thrills. Here's is a truly worthy departure in the Karloff repertoire that mustn't be missed.",1503532800,,1955,5.059006211180124

It is as if they took the pressings from other Karloff compilations without bothering to include the extras or subtitles. Karloff, and his fans, deserve better. But the movies themselves are certainly worth owning. Just probably would be best to do so in a different compilation than this.

I was so thrilled to find this was the first film of the DVD pack - it is still scary, even through adult eyes now. The film quality is very good for such old films, and sound is excellent.

7339922,5,B011PS51LI,"I received this set for Christmas (purchased from here on Amazon), and I love it.  The six films showcased here show Karloff on top of his game. I particularly liked The Black Room, The Man They Could Not Hang, The Man with Nine Lives, and The Boogie Man Will Get You. The Boogie Man... became a fast favorite for me.  It was funny and really quite entertaining. Boris and Peter Lorre were superb together--great comic timing.  My least favorite (although I still enjoyed it) was The Devil Commands.  The concept of the film was good and it started out great, but became a little strange as it went on, as his experiments were a little too out there for my liking or understanding. Even so, it is still enjoyable and fits nicely with the others. The print quality on these is actually pretty decent--all films are completely watchable. There is the occasional tear or hole in the film but nothing major. The sound is pretty good, although I did have to turn the volume up pretty far to be able to hear it clearly (and no subtitles).
