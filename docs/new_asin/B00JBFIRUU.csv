8649599,5,B00JBFIRUU,"THE CANNONBALL RUN BLU-RAY by U.K. mediumrare
the new 1:78:1 HD transfer looks about the same as the U.S. HD transfer which is very good nice/sharp picture quality about 9/10
the sound mixes are 5.1 master mix & the 2.0 stereo mix, i found the 5.1 mix more superior sound quality than the 2.0
EXTRAS- tragically mediumrare didn't get the commentary track by Hal needham
but they did get a new interview with Roger moore filmed in early 2015
even thou the interview only goes for 10mins it's still worth watching, Roger talks about how he got the role
and also working with most of the cast members, also about how much fun he had during the whole production
Mediumrare also made the effort to add 2 Theatrical trailer's the U.S. Theatrical trailer & U.K. trailer aswell both in new HD quality
plus a stills Photo Gallery and a thick booklet about the films production and also lots of behind the scenes photos
i believe this U.K. blu-ray is the best reissue of the Cannonball run for sure worth the moeny all the way
there's also a DVD Disc included aswell which has the same extras content and DR quality of the film
the blu-ray is region B the DVD is region 2 so you'll need all regions player for sure, 5 stars for this U.K. blu-ray
Mediumrare also reissued the sequel CANNONBALL RUN II which also has an excellent 1:78:1 HD transfer with 5.1 master mix
plus only has few extras, the U.S. Theatrical trailer plus stills photo Gallery & making of booklet aswell
so best to buy both reissues worth the money",1531180800,,1508,4.507299270072993

8649606,4,B00JBFIRUU,"The quality of the packaging was awesome, especially the collection booklet included.  It came with both the Blue Ray and DVD versions of the movie.  The email verifying I received the moving and was pleased was very appreciative.  The only problem is I live in the United States, this is Region A, and the movie was created for Region B.  So I sent a reply email to the company to see if it can be exchanged for the correct Region movie.",1514246400,,438,4.37037037037037
