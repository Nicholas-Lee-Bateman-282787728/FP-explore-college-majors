3113997,4,B0013K2ZFY,"Okay, I have to admit that I was a little skeptical of another sequel to a movie which I love and watch over and over as though I'm going to find something that I missed the first million times I've seen it. But to be honest, after watching Chasing the Dream right after the Cutting Edge marathon on ABC Family, I have to say that I liked this one a lot better than I did the second one, Going for the Gold.

If you've seen the second one, you might agree with me when I say that it is a lot like the first via plot and character wise. Jackie has a temper similar to her mother from the first, and Alex plays the happy-go-lucky kid who's got nothing to lose much like Doug in the original.

However, in this third one, there seems to me much more going on with the characters - there's more history to them compared to the second movie. Zack is a bit of a risk-taker, which lands to his partners getting hurt, but he learns from his mistakes (meaning that you can't always takes risks all the time) in part because he falls in love. (Remember though he does admit to Celeste his mistake after her accident.)

Alex had the dream as a child, but due to her family's situation was never able to follow through with it, and is now determined to go for it, with or without Zack at her side at times. As a reference to the original, she plays hockey with her older brother and his friends, and unknowningly shows Zack moves from her figure skating days. She does like him from the beginning, but is able to put her feelings aside when he gives her the cold shoulder on the advice of Celeste.

Then there's Jackie, brought back to coach them after Zack's coach leaves to coach his rivals. Let me tell you up front that I didn't like the idea of Jackie being divorced in the film (we think from Alex though it's never said). I have to agree with other fan reviews when I say that it's not doing much to promote marriage (I'm an old fashion traditionalist who feels marriage is forever, I can't help it - sorry), and if the reason for her divorce was simply because they couldn't get the actor back to revive his character, there were other ways around it - not divorce. But underneath the hardcore, champion skating persona from the second film, we do see Jackie producing feelings for her skaters, particularly when Zack nails Alex in the head with his blade (which by the way was interesting, but not quite believable. I'll let it slide though.)

Overall, it was pretty good, and filled with more humor than the second one (though the best section in the second movie was when Jackie and Alex were tied together). The characters evolved during the film when they began to understand what was more important in life. And to be honest, being female, Matt Lanter is much better looking than Ross Thomas from the second sequel. :) Much better than the second one for me, and looking forward to getting it on DVD.",1205884800,21,2902,4.366666666666666
3113998,5,B0013K2ZFY,"I loved the original and thought the 2nd one was okay.  I just saw this one on TV and thought it was good enough to be released in the theatres first.  The couple had great chemistry, the story and acting were superb.  If you like romantic ice skating movies, this is the movie for you.",1205712000,,286,4.163636363636364
3113999,4,B0013K2ZFY,"The telefilm centers on ice skating's most eligible bachelor Zack Conroy (Matt Lanter), who suddenly becomes available when an accident causes his partner and ex-girlfriend to break her leg. He defies convention when he replaces her on the ice with newcomer Alejandra ""Alex"" Delgado (Francia Raisa), a comely hockey player whose fierce sportsmanship translates into fierce moves on the ice.

Zack's coach and choreographer can't deal with this new twist, however, and quits. Time is running out for the International Championships in Paris, so Zack turns to the once-famous skater Jackie Dorsey (Christy Carlson Romano) who mysteriously left the business for an early retirement. She takes on the challenge of mentoring this impossible team because she too once took a non-skater and made him an ice skating champ in ""The Cutting Edge 2.""

As with all ""Cutting Edge"" movies, the unlikely partners find that while training, they begin having feelings of the romantic variety for each other. Somehow, they must reconcile their moves on the ice with their relationship outside of the rink.",1205625600,11,1086,5.271676300578035

3114013,1,B0013K2ZFY,"This movie was atrocious. The plot was rushed with no character development of explanations, resulting in no personal investment in the lives of the characters on the viewer's part. At least half of the trailer happens in the first ten minutes of the movie. I am begging you to save your money and just watch the trailer- you'll get the exact same story, only better. Don't waste your time or money.",1490918400,,399,4.633802816901408
3114014,5,B0013K2ZFY,The only reason for the five stars was how it is not about the acting job of everyone but it shows  how love is strong force and in todays world of hatred and miss leading news this movie tells you have to listen to the Heart the heart that is now beating inside of you now ...The reason for my purchase was it included one of the previous characters From Cuttting Edge 2  Jackie Dorsey  that was played by Christy Carlson Ramano which if you remember here from Even Stevens children show  and movie . but She was the only one that I liked and the other two main one they have won it for me. Look you read this any way you want to but No spoilers here if you want to know what happens in the movie watch form an opinion then think about watch it again see what things you might of missed but I suggest you watch the first one Cutting Edge . then watch 2 then 3 you will get more out of it . Plus it shows a nice story arch where Jackie from Cutting Edge 2 is now a coach in this movie ....spoiler alert for that one thing ..,1490918400,,1024,3.9323671497584543

3114016,1,B0013K2ZFY,I should have only bought the first of the series of cutting edge which is the best by far to watch. The acting was suberb. The story line kept you glued to the screen. I can watch it over and over and not get bored. This one had poor acting tried to stay on the same story but with different actors. Very disappointed. I'm not buying anymore of the movie series.,1490486400,,363,4.126760563380282

3114030,4,B0013K2ZFY,"I don't know why Ive been a sucker for these Cutting Edge movies but I am. The third in the series follows the same formula as the first two so if youve seen either one of those then youve basically seen this one too. But what does this entry do differently? For one it switches the figure skating roles as the main figure skater who loses their partner is a guy this time (pretty boy Zack Conroy who is without family and has grown up in the sport, and wealthy to boot, but at least doesnt act like a spoiled brat). So he gets another hockey player to skate with him, the cutely adorable (those full pretty lips!) Alejandra Delgado, who used to figure skate when she was a little girl and dream of skating amidst the stars but her family was too poor to help her realize this. Another way this tries to add spice to the script is by including an ethnic (read: non-white) bent into the mix as Alejandra is from a Mexican background and helps her parents out at their taqueria. I liked this unlikely romance aspect especially as they didn't ever focus on it as a barrier to their romance. He helps her to chase her dream and this is of course complicated by their romance and then the usual misunderstandings that beset them. Actress Christy Carlson Romano reprises her role from the second film (as Jackie Dorsey) and is enlisted as their coach. Its all routine, but if you liked the first two (as did I) then youll eat this one up too!",1487203200,,1436,4.342007434944238

They both want to skate to skate, not for the fame and fortune that others search for. They support each other! Though the speed that the one skater learns the parts is a little hard to believe, they do have a ""backstory"" that makes the speed more believable.

We now have a new couple which add a lot more spice to the regime.  The main move from the first movie makes a comeback ""The Pichanco"".  They execute it beautifully at the end of the movie and we again think we have a couple both with fears of being hurt and figuring out in the end that they have what it takes to trust in the other.  The dynamic is a little old in this one after three movies of the same old same old but the girl being the underdog instead of the guy gives it a little bit of a new edge.

3114155,4,B0013K2ZFY,"I love skating movie and have seen all 4 movies. Would anyone had guess this title would get 3 sequel!?!?! I didn't. I honestly didn't know there was, but I just finished watching all 3 sequels today. Out of the 3 movie sequels, I felt this one is the best sequel!

Let me first start off by saying, I don't mind watching the same movie plot thrown at me. At least these movies were under the same name. Other movies will try to copy or steal other movies plot's, but these movies have the right to do so. That's why I watched all 3 sequels. I knew that they were going to just do the same thing as the original, but with different lead actors. I don't mind that. I watched this movie for the chemistry and see if the actors are believe able and the skating.

Now, the acting was good. I believed the main actors. But the coach, Jackie Dorsey, wasn't that good. I didn't feel she had the heart or the will power to be a believable coach. It was the skaters talent that saved the day, and not the words or teaching of the coach. The skating wasn't all good, but wasn't as good as the 2nd movie.

I felt that this movie was a role reverse form the original movie. The girl is now a hockey player turned figure skater. The boy is the desperate pair skater that needs a partner. The even learns how to do the Pamchenko! The Pamchenko was basically a CGI performance of Alex flying in the air and Zack catching her. I don't think it was as good as the first and the first made it looked way better.

I give this movie 4 stars because it was better than the 4th movie, but not as good as the 2nd movie. This movie is recommended that love these Cutting Edge movies.",1400284800,,1659,4.158878504672897
3114156,3,B0013K2ZFY,"The Cutting Edge 3: Chasing the Dream is a TV movie that follows the 2006 direct-to-video release movie,The Cutting Edge: Going for the Gold. It was shown on ABC.It stars Matt Lanter and Francia Raisa. Christy Carlson Romano,the star of the second The Cutting Edge,is among the supporting cast.

Zach Conroy and Celeste Mercier are the hottest couple on and off the ice. Then a nasty spill knocks Celeste out of competition. Zach has to quickly find another partner for the Paris championship meet. In glides Alejandra ""Alex"" Delgado, a beautiful,tough-talking hockey player with fierce moves and a fearless skating style.

Zach is willing to give her a chance, but his coach, Bryan, is hesitant. However after a fight almost erupts between Bryan and Alex's brother he quits in a huff to train Zach's biggest rivals, Cindy Halgyord and Jason Bright. This leaves Zach with a newbie partner and no coach. Then Jackie Dorsey steps in and puts Zach and Alex through their paces to remain focused on practice inspite of their continuous figthing and bickering. What is also bothering them is their growing attraction to one another. When Alex sees a photo with Zach kissing Celeste she feels hurt and leaves but with the help of her brother and Zach they get back together right in time for their performance. Right before they are about to get their turn at the competition,Zach profess his love for Alex and both give a flawless performance. The End.

Just like the The Cutting Edge 2 movie,this third film follows the same thematic plots and elements of the first film such as incompatible partners,constant fight between partners,one being a hockey player only this time the woman happens to be one instead of the male, and professing the partners love for one another that leads to winning performance in the first Cutting Edge. Do I need to even mention that Zack and Alex are going to do the same Pamchenko twist that Kate and Doug did after professing their love to one another?

Too bad that is is practically a blatant rehash for the Sweeney-Kelly starrer. The only good thing about it is that the leads,Matt Lanter and Francia Rais,have decent chemistry and more energy. Although it is a better film compared to The Cutting Edge 2,it still does not hold a candle to the first classic film. Only younger viewers or viewers who aren't familiar with classic Cutting Edge movie would probably appreciate it.",1399939200,,2409,4.854014598540146

3114216,2,B0013K2ZFY,"Complete unabashed ripoff of the original. But somehow, the two young stars upstage their own mediocre production to make this work, sort of.

Couldn't believe they actually made two sequels to the cult favorite. One day I might spend the time to watch the second version, but for this third installment, I was aghast at the complete lack of originality. I get that the basic ""fish out of water"" has to be the foundation of these stories - I get it. But c'mon, there has just got to be some semblance of crafting your own vision, cutting your own path. This was the movie equivalent of putting down tracing paper and copying another person's artwork. Sad.

Again, what saves this from a complete and utter disaster are the two young stars, Matt Lanter and Francia Raisa. In particular - the latter. Her infectious energy really carries this otherwise staid uninspired retread.

Without her - this is low two. With her - it's a high two. With her in an original screenplay - who knows?

And it would be wrong to not mention the only other valid actor I felt was in the film - Luis Oliva, who played the brother to Francia's character. Guy was very real and I completely bought his role. Hope someone in a position to notice - notices.

Finally, I was so depressed to see them resurrect the original 'illegal move'. Is there nothing else in skating that might be credibly drafted as something amazing? Really, that's it: Swinging your partner and tossing her up - that's the penultimate? Nothing else can be done?

Appreciate that it's dangerous, and I love the move. But I loved it *20 years ago* when the first team came up with it. Where was Anton (Roy Dotrice) when the production company came up with their cast?

Seriously, without any effort I can think of two, maybe three, different ways of addressing this critical plot point. And I don't skate. <shaking head in dismay>",1327968000,,1878,4.621621621621622

  It's the usual plot: star figure skater needs new partner after his established partner is injured. He plucks an unknown out of nowhere -- they train together, fall in love, have a romantic crisis and end up winning the gold.
  To make this enjoyable, the lead characters need to  have chemistry and the movie needs to make at least some minimal effort to avoid cliches.
  Unfortunately, almost every line in this script is a cliche -- my wife saw several coming before they were uttered -- and the leads, while attractive don't exactly melt the screen with their passion.

I think that Alejandra was cast perfectly, as the actress who plays her portrays the perfect amount of attitude needed for a hockey player, but also the slight timidness that is found only if you search beneath the surface.

One plus for this sequel is that it is more appropriate for younger viewers... there are no sex scenes, the beginning has a brief view of the male lead in his underwear partially covered by a sheet.  After watching it I felt that it is more of a PG than a PG-13 movie, whereas the original movie is definately a PG-13 movie. My sisters are 8 and 10 and take ice skating lessons and I have no reservations about allowing them to watch this movie.  Other than the brief underwear scene, there was nothing more than rare fully-clothed kissing and less than 5 bad words in the movie (there may have been more than 5 but I wasn't counting).  I also liked the fact that in the movie the female lead was driven to prove herself as a skater/athlete in competition with professionals... the message it sends to the younger kids is much better than the Mary-Kate and Ashley movies which are more focused on being boy-crazy and shopping.  Overall, it was a cute movie, I think the whole family could enjoy watching this movie (maybe not if you have pre-teen or teen aged boys).

To put this movie in a group of similar age-appropriate movies I would group it with:
Ice Princess (Michelle Trachtenberg- which was rated G)
Ella Enchanted (Anne Hathaway- rated PG)

Well, that just shot it all to heck for me.  What was even the point of the 2nd movie now?  Couldn't Alex have been recast or just not shown?  Arg...

Nope, the entire movie was ruined for me with 1 line.  ""They were all that kept me together after the divorce and injuries"" - Jackie Dorsey referencing the children she teaches to skate.  I had to rewind it to make sure she said divorce, I just couldn't believe it.

Well, there goes any use for the 2nd movie.  If I wanted to watch a drama instead of a comedy, I would.  I want happy endings in this series, darnit.  Is that really so much to ask?

And I wasn't even a big fan of the 2nd movie...  I just find the callousness disgusting.  I mean you spend a whole movie trying to get people involved in the central love story and then you throw that investment away in an off-the-cuff line that wasn't even needed in the 3rd?

The weirdest thing about all this is that they made the 2 leads from CE2 divorce - not what I would expect from a family values standpoint.",1206057600,5,1029,4.183673469387755
3114248,3,B0013K2ZFY,"The Cutting Edge: Chasing the Dream is the third and final installment in the Cutting Edge series that started with everyone's favorite 90s film about an ice skater and ex-hockey player who banter their way to the Olympics. The Cutting Edge: Chasing the Dream added an extra twist to the story by making the female lead a hockey player and the male lead is the one in need of a partner. The concept was cute, but there wasn't a lot of follow through.

The original movie The Cutting Edge was rated PG, but at a time when PG meant that you could include more adult themes. The character depth in the film was believable as you saw these characters evolve. In this film, because of the changed standards on movie ratings were limited on what could be discussed. Now, the film is meant for the family which means quite a bit is simplified for a younger audience and overall less believable.

Overall, fans of the original film will be glad to see references made to the original. The Pamchenko Twist makes another appearance along with an almost identical ending. However, like all sequels, the original will always be the best. The references to the original made the movie cute and worth watching once, but not good enough to stand on its own.

If you're a die hard fan looking for a cute movie, give this one a chance. However, if you're actually going to look at this movie with a realistic or slightly critical eye, you're not going to care for it one iota. If you're not sure - just stick to the original. It's the best by far.",1205971200,25,1530,4.476702508960574
3348494,4,B0013K2ZFY,"Okay, I have to admit that I was a little skeptical of another sequel to a movie which I love and watch over and over as though I'm going to find something that I missed the first million times I've seen it. But to be honest, after watching Chasing the Dream right after the Cutting Edge marathon on ABC Family, I have to say that I liked this one a lot better than I did the second one, Going for the Gold.

If you've seen the second one, you might agree with me when I say that it is a lot like the first via plot and character wise. Jackie has a temper similar to her mother from the first, and Alex plays the happy-go-lucky kid who's got nothing to lose much like Doug in the original.

However, in this third one, there seems to me much more going on with the characters - there's more history to them compared to the second movie. Zack is a bit of a risk-taker, which lands to his partners getting hurt, but he learns from his mistakes (meaning that you can't always takes risks all the time) in part because he falls in love. (Remember though he does admit to Celeste his mistake after her accident.)

Alex had the dream as a child, but due to her family's situation was never able to follow through with it, and is now determined to go for it, with or without Zack at her side at times. As a reference to the original, she plays hockey with her older brother and his friends, and unknowningly shows Zack moves from her figure skating days. She does like him from the beginning, but is able to put her feelings aside when he gives her the cold shoulder on the advice of Celeste.

Then there's Jackie, brought back to coach them after Zack's coach leaves to coach his rivals. Let me tell you up front that I didn't like the idea of Jackie being divorced in the film (we think from Alex though it's never said). I have to agree with other fan reviews when I say that it's not doing much to promote marriage (I'm an old fashion traditionalist who feels marriage is forever, I can't help it - sorry), and if the reason for her divorce was simply because they couldn't get the actor back to revive his character, there were other ways around it - not divorce. But underneath the hardcore, champion skating persona from the second film, we do see Jackie producing feelings for her skaters, particularly when Zack nails Alex in the head with his blade (which by the way was interesting, but not quite believable. I'll let it slide though.)

Overall, it was pretty good, and filled with more humor than the second one (though the best section in the second movie was when Jackie and Alex were tied together). The characters evolved during the film when they began to understand what was more important in life. And to be honest, being female, Matt Lanter is much better looking than Ross Thomas from the second sequel. :) Much better than the second one for me, and looking forward to getting it on DVD.",1205884800,21,2902,4.366666666666666

3348511,5,B0013K2ZFY,The only reason for the five stars was how it is not about the acting job of everyone but it shows  how love is strong force and in todays world of hatred and miss leading news this movie tells you have to listen to the Heart the heart that is now beating inside of you now ...The reason for my purchase was it included one of the previous characters From Cuttting Edge 2  Jackie Dorsey  that was played by Christy Carlson Ramano which if you remember here from Even Stevens children show  and movie . but She was the only one that I liked and the other two main one they have won it for me. Look you read this any way you want to but No spoilers here if you want to know what happens in the movie watch form an opinion then think about watch it again see what things you might of missed but I suggest you watch the first one Cutting Edge . then watch 2 then 3 you will get more out of it . Plus it shows a nice story arch where Jackie from Cutting Edge 2 is now a coach in this movie ....spoiler alert for that one thing ..,1490918400,,1024,3.9323671497584543

3348527,4,B0013K2ZFY,"I don't know why Ive been a sucker for these Cutting Edge movies but I am. The third in the series follows the same formula as the first two so if youve seen either one of those then youve basically seen this one too. But what does this entry do differently? For one it switches the figure skating roles as the main figure skater who loses their partner is a guy this time (pretty boy Zack Conroy who is without family and has grown up in the sport, and wealthy to boot, but at least doesnt act like a spoiled brat). So he gets another hockey player to skate with him, the cutely adorable (those full pretty lips!) Alejandra Delgado, who used to figure skate when she was a little girl and dream of skating amidst the stars but her family was too poor to help her realize this. Another way this tries to add spice to the script is by including an ethnic (read: non-white) bent into the mix as Alejandra is from a Mexican background and helps her parents out at their taqueria. I liked this unlikely romance aspect especially as they didn't ever focus on it as a barrier to their romance. He helps her to chase her dream and this is of course complicated by their romance and then the usual misunderstandings that beset them. Actress Christy Carlson Romano reprises her role from the second film (as Jackie Dorsey) and is enlisted as their coach. Its all routine, but if you liked the first two (as did I) then youll eat this one up too!",1487203200,,1436,4.342007434944238

Let me first start off by saying, I don't mind watching the same movie plot thrown at me. At least these movies were under the same name. Other movies will try to copy or steal other movies plot's, but these movies have the right to do so. That's why I watched all 3 sequels. I knew that they were going to just do the same thing as the original, but with different lead actors. I don't mind that. I watched this movie for the chemistry and see if the actors are believe able and the skating.

Now, the acting was good. I believed the main actors. But the coach, Jackie Dorsey, wasn't that good. I didn't feel she had the heart or the will power to be a believable coach. It was the skaters talent that saved the day, and not the words or teaching of the coach. The skating wasn't all good, but wasn't as good as the 2nd movie.

I felt that this movie was a role reverse form the original movie. The girl is now a hockey player turned figure skater. The boy is the desperate pair skater that needs a partner. The even learns how to do the Pamchenko! The Pamchenko was basically a CGI performance of Alex flying in the air and Zack catching her. I don't think it was as good as the first and the first made it looked way better.

I give this movie 4 stars because it was better than the 4th movie, but not as good as the 2nd movie. This movie is recommended that love these Cutting Edge movies.",1400284800,,1659,4.158878504672897
3348653,3,B0013K2ZFY,"The Cutting Edge 3: Chasing the Dream is a TV movie that follows the 2006 direct-to-video release movie,The Cutting Edge: Going for the Gold. It was shown on ABC.It stars Matt Lanter and Francia Raisa. Christy Carlson Romano,the star of the second The Cutting Edge,is among the supporting cast.

Zach Conroy and Celeste Mercier are the hottest couple on and off the ice. Then a nasty spill knocks Celeste out of competition. Zach has to quickly find another partner for the Paris championship meet. In glides Alejandra ""Alex"" Delgado, a beautiful,tough-talking hockey player with fierce moves and a fearless skating style.

Zach is willing to give her a chance, but his coach, Bryan, is hesitant. However after a fight almost erupts between Bryan and Alex's brother he quits in a huff to train Zach's biggest rivals, Cindy Halgyord and Jason Bright. This leaves Zach with a newbie partner and no coach. Then Jackie Dorsey steps in and puts Zach and Alex through their paces to remain focused on practice inspite of their continuous figthing and bickering. What is also bothering them is their growing attraction to one another. When Alex sees a photo with Zach kissing Celeste she feels hurt and leaves but with the help of her brother and Zach they get back together right in time for their performance. Right before they are about to get their turn at the competition,Zach profess his love for Alex and both give a flawless performance. The End.

Just like the The Cutting Edge 2 movie,this third film follows the same thematic plots and elements of the first film such as incompatible partners,constant fight between partners,one being a hockey player only this time the woman happens to be one instead of the male, and professing the partners love for one another that leads to winning performance in the first Cutting Edge. Do I need to even mention that Zack and Alex are going to do the same Pamchenko twist that Kate and Doug did after professing their love to one another?

Too bad that is is practically a blatant rehash for the Sweeney-Kelly starrer. The only good thing about it is that the leads,Matt Lanter and Francia Rais,have decent chemistry and more energy. Although it is a better film compared to The Cutting Edge 2,it still does not hold a candle to the first classic film.

I loved the first movie but I think they went to the well one too many times. While the actors are engaging, this is a repeat of the first movie; they even do the same Pamchenko move at the end.  The only difference this time? Instead of the male being a poor, hockey player and the female being rich, the female is a poor, hockey player and the male is rich. The pair even sneaks into the big contest by placing one out of the money and then an incident happens that lets them squeak in. If you saw the first one, you've seen this one (except the first one was better).",1328140800,3,589,4.157894736842105
3348713,2,B0013K2ZFY,"Complete unabashed ripoff of the original. But somehow, the two young stars upstage their own mediocre production to make this work, sort of.

Couldn't believe they actually made two sequels to the cult favorite. One day I might spend the time to watch the second version, but for this third installment, I was aghast at the complete lack of originality. I get that the basic ""fish out of water"" has to be the foundation of these stories - I get it. But c'mon, there has just got to be some semblance of crafting your own vision, cutting your own path. This was the movie equivalent of putting down tracing paper and copying another person's artwork. Sad.

Again, what saves this from a complete and utter disaster are the two young stars, Matt Lanter and Francia Raisa. In particular - the latter. Her infectious energy really carries this otherwise staid uninspired retread.

Without her - this is low two. With her - it's a high two. With her in an original screenplay - who knows?

And it would be wrong to not mention the only other valid actor I felt was in the film - Luis Oliva, who played the brother to Francia's character. Guy was very real and I completely bought his role. Hope someone in a position to notice - notices.

Finally, I was so depressed to see them resurrect the original 'illegal move'. Is there nothing else in skating that might be credibly drafted as something amazing? Really, that's it: Swinging your partner and tossing her up - that's the penultimate? Nothing else can be done?

Appreciate that it's dangerous, and I love the move. But I loved it *20 years ago* when the first team came up with it. Where was Anton (Roy Dotrice) when the production company came up with their cast?

Seriously, without any effort I can think of two, maybe three, different ways of addressing this critical plot point. And I don't skate. <shaking head in dismay>",1327968000,,1878,4.621621621621622

  It's the usual plot: star figure skater needs new partner after his established partner is injured. He plucks an unknown out of nowhere -- they train together, fall in love, have a romantic crisis and end up winning the gold.
  To make this enjoyable, the lead characters need to  have chemistry and the movie needs to make at least some minimal effort to avoid cliches.
  Unfortunately, almost every line in this script is a cliche -- my wife saw several coming before they were uttered -- and the leads, while attractive don't exactly melt the screen with their passion.

The acting was right on and the character development and depth was outstanding.  If you are a fan of the original this one is definitely worth a look, but stay away from Going for The gold.

3348741,4,B0013K2ZFY,"This movie was really good. I enjoyed watching it even though it was a little predictable. It was a bit of a role reversal compared to the previous 2 movies, with the skater in need of a new partner being a guy, and the new partner turns out to be an amateur hockey playing girl. I think that Alejandra was cast perfectly, as the actress who plays her portrays the perfect amount of attitude needed for a hockey player, but also the slight timidness that is found only if you search beneath the surface. My favourite is still the 1st, The Cutting Edge, with this coming in a close 2nd for me. I highly recommend it.",1209859200,,615,4.310344827586207

3348743,4,B0013K2ZFY,"Like most sequels, the basic plot is almost the same as the original, reversing the roles of the main characters (in this version the female lead is the 'poor' amateur hockey player and the male lead is the wealthy pretty boy).  One plus for this sequel is that it is more appropriate for younger viewers... there are no sex scenes, the beginning has a brief view of the male lead in his underwear partially covered by a sheet.  After watching it I felt that it is more of a PG than a PG-13 movie, whereas the original movie is definately a PG-13 movie. My sisters are 8 and 10 and take ice skating lessons and I have no reservations about allowing them to watch this movie.  Other than the brief underwear scene, there was nothing more than rare fully-clothed kissing and less than 5 bad words in the movie (there may have been more than 5 but I wasn't counting).  I also liked the fact that in the movie the female lead was driven to prove herself as a skater/athlete in competition with professionals... the message it sends to the younger kids is much better than the Mary-Kate and Ashley movies which are more focused on being boy-crazy and shopping.  Overall, it was a cute movie, I think the whole family could enjoy watching this movie (maybe not if you have pre-teen or teen aged boys).

To put this movie in a group of similar age-appropriate movies I would group it with:
Ice Princess (Michelle Trachtenberg- which was rated G)
Ella Enchanted (Anne Hathaway- rated PG)
Princess Diaries 1 & 2 (Anne Hathaway- rated G)",1207353600,2,1527,4.534545454545454

Well, that just shot it all to heck for me.  What was even the point of the 2nd movie now?  Couldn't Alex have been recast or just not shown?  Arg...

Nope, the entire movie was ruined for me with 1 line.  ""They were all that kept me together after the divorce and injuries"" - Jackie Dorsey referencing the children she teaches to skate.  I had to rewind it to make sure she said divorce, I just couldn't believe it.

Well, there goes any use for the 2nd movie.  If I wanted to watch a drama instead of a comedy, I would.  I want happy endings in this series, darnit.  Is that really so much to ask?

And I wasn't even a big fan of the 2nd movie...  I just find the callousness disgusting.  I mean you spend a whole movie trying to get people involved in the central love story and then you throw that investment away in an off-the-cuff line that wasn't even needed in the 3rd?

The weirdest thing about all this is that they made the 2 leads from CE2 divorce - not what I would expect from a family values standpoint.",1206057600,5,1029,4.183673469387755
3348745,3,B0013K2ZFY,"The Cutting Edge: Chasing the Dream is the third and final installment in the Cutting Edge series that started with everyone's favorite 90s film about an ice skater and ex-hockey player who banter their way to the Olympics. The Cutting Edge: Chasing the Dream added an extra twist to the story by making the female lead a hockey player and the male lead is the one in need of a partner. The concept was cute, but there wasn't a lot of follow through.

The original movie The Cutting Edge was rated PG, but at a time when PG meant that you could include more adult themes. The character depth in the film was believable as you saw these characters evolve. In this film, because of the changed standards on movie ratings were limited on what could be discussed. Now, the film is meant for the family which means quite a bit is simplified for a younger audience and overall less believable.

Overall, fans of the original film will be glad to see references made to the original. The Pamchenko Twist makes another appearance along with an almost identical ending. However, like all sequels, the original will always be the best. The references to the original made the movie cute and worth watching once, but not good enough to stand on its own.

If you're a die hard fan looking for a cute movie, give this one a chance. However, if you're actually going to look at this movie with a realistic or slightly critical eye, you're not going to care for it one iota. If you're not sure - just stick to the original. It's the best by far.",1205971200,25,1530,4.476702508960574
