4498646,5,B004Y9DF5A,"I identified ""Les Troyens"" not as a Grand Opera (which it is) but as Epic Opera to emphasize the Vergilian source of Berlioz's inspiration. Berlioz had a profound appreciation of Vergil's ""Aeneid"" as did the whole Western world until the twentieth century when his star dimmed as Homer's grew brighter. Very few people read the ""Aeneid"" today apparently, compared to the relative popularity of Homer's epics, despite its importance in the shaping of aspects of Western culture. Personally, I too prefer Homer to Vergil, but the Roman poet has unique qualities which would have been unthinkable to Homer.  For example, in Aeneas's account of the fall of Troy which makes up the first section of Berlioz's opera, Vergil emphasizes repeatedly the futility of violence. When Odysseus's descends into the Land of the Dead, he is shocked by the bleak, hopeless future for humans; when Aeneas descends, he encounters an after-life informed by the Orphic Mysteries, one of hope and bliss. Berlioz wisely ignores the second half of the ""Aeneid"" in which Vergil was reduced to writing propaganda for the Roman state. The much longer second of the opera dramatizes Book Four, the love affair of Dido and Aeneas. I admit to being overwhelmed by this production. Antonio Pappano is an amazing opera conductor, equally adept at intimate scenes and the huge crowd scenes. He unifies the many scenes into a coherent whole, thereby fulfilling Berlioz's epic scheme. I loved Anna Antonacci as Cassandra! She was so passionate, so poignant, so sensitive I was completely captivated. Eva-Maria Westbroek is a commanding Dido, but she is moving in revealing her doubts to Anna and tender in revealing her love to Aeneas. And what a powerful finale when she curses her faithless lover and his country an immolates herself. For me the role of Aeneas will always belong to the great heroic tenor, Jon Vickers. What a powerful voice! What a commanding presence! When he sings to his son, ""Garde en ta memoire et d'Enee et d'Hector les exemples de gloire"", I almost become a believer in those imperial Roman values. The surprise for me was how Bryan Hymel filled the role with his singing and acting, a very impressive achievement for this young tenor. And now the stage director, David McVicar: BRAVO, MAESTRO!! Yet another glorious production by this shining light among stage directors. I have been thrilled by his stagings of MEISTERSINGERS, SALOME, TROVATORE, ADRIANA LECOUVREUR. And now we can add this production of LES TROYENS to his achievements. I think I admire his restraint as much as his boldness, and he displays both qualities in virtually everything he directs. In this production, as in MEISTERSINGERS, he shows his ability to stage huge crowd scenes with excitement but also clarity; likewise, in the many intimate scenes in Berlioz's opera, he evokes both their stillness and tension. Berlioz never experienced his great work, which was not performed complete until the late 1950s. Now half a century later, we have this truly wonderful, thrilling, awesome production which shows Berlioz's faith in his genius and ability to write the Epic Opera of the ""Aeneid"" was fully justified.",1387584000,9,3176,5.072657743785851
4498647,2,B004Y9DF5A,"In principle, I'm all for the approach and the use of new technology that the experimental Catalan theatre group la Fura dels Baus bring to opera productions.  In practice however, I can never get past the dumb ideas that they sometimes base their concepts upon.  Although I have avoided it myself, a lot of people like their Valencia Ring cycle, and I can see how their approach to total music theatre would work with Wagner - much as it suits, in principle, the dramatic theatricality of Hector Berlioz (they've done&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Damnation-De-Faust/dp/B00004W5WL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Damnation De Faust</a>&nbsp;in the past).  In practice however, I'm afraid their production of Les Troyens just doesn't work for me.

Seriously.  What genius (that would be Carlus Padrissa) though it would be a great idea to take the metaphor of the Trojan Horse virus back to its source and make it literal?  The phrase, ""Beware of Greeks or other outside hostile agencies bearing gifts of laptops carrying viruses that may compromise the integrity of your system"", doesn't really have all that great a ring to it.  Even if you were to find this feeble concept worthy of more than a minute's consideration, there's little to support it in this staging, which is an impressive spectacle certainly (you are always guaranteed that at least from la Fura dels Baus), but it's also a complete hotchpotch of ideas and concepts that look a complete mess and don't come across particularly well on video.  Some of the scenes mixing projections and live action, hanging singers and acrobats from cables, are impressive, enhancing the nightmarish visions of Cassandra and representing the death of Laco'on well in the first half, but really, does this bring anything meaningful out of the work, or is it just half-baked concepts and Cirque du Soleil spectacle?

Conducted by Valery Gergiev, the Valencia production at least remains hugely entertaining from a musical viewpoint, although I wouldn't put it above the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-Eliot-Gardner-version/dp/B003757W1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John Eliot Gardner version</a>.  The singing is mostly of a good standard, particularly the two female leads Elisabete Martos (Cassandra) and Daniela Barcellona (Dido), but again, personally, I prefer the performances of Anna Caterina Antonacci and Susan Graham in the Chtelet production.  Gregory Kunde is however certainly a better Aeneas than Lance Ryan here, who I thought delivered everything in a dreary declamatory fashion and in a tone that becomes unpleasantly nasal on the high notes.  His poor diction moreover painfully murders the French libretto.

The quality of the Blu-ray itself - the entire opera on a single BD50 disc - is reasonably good, the image as clear as it can be on a dark stage that uses a lot of back and front-screen projections.  The audio tracks - PCM stereo and DTS 5.1 HD master audio - are both fine, if there is little to choose between them.  Overall, if you don't think too much about the terrible concept and are able to simply just enjoy the spectacle of the staging, this isn't a bad version of Les Troyens, and it's certainly well performed - but there is a much better version out there already on Blu-ray in terms of production values, spectacle and overall quality of the performance.",1310601600,2,3438,5.4
4498648,4,B004Y9DF5A,"Gergiev leads a propulsive, exciting account of this greatest of French operas, and he has some magnificent singers to work with. Elisabete Matos is a fine Cassandre--and I suppose I can accept the idea that she's in (and out) of a wheelchair as a symbol of her semi-disabled state. Certainly the poor woman has a big problem, being able to see the fall of Troy and unable to get anyone to believe her. As Chorebe, Gabriele Viviani partners her ably in their extended first act duet, without leaving a particularly vivid impression. Lance Ryan, a very busy tenor in Europe, seems to have all the notes and doesn't visibly tire, but I cannot warm up very much to the basic sound; I'll ascribe that to personal taste and go along with him here (I didn't much enjoy his Siegfried in the Fura del Baus' Ring cycle either, although we have heard much, much worse). Daniela Barcellona is a very fine Didon, but the designers have awarded her what may be the dumbest wig in opera history--which is saying a lot. About the production I have decidedly mixed feelings, but I'm sure in the theater it would be striking and provocative. The Trojan horse looks, for once, big enough for a lot of sweaty, claustrophobic Greeks to hide in. It's an ingenious object, if not particularly equine. And that might be the keynote of the whole production: ingenious, impressive, but often not obviously related to the story. Repeated viewings may improve this disc; unquestionably, there is a lot here.",1310342400,,1480,4.74031007751938
4498649,1,B004Y9DF5A,"This is, unfortunately, a disappointment, mainly because of staging. From the musical point of view, the performance is not bad, though less splendid performances than Gardiner 2003 from Paris. The Valencia Orchestra plays beautifully for Valery Gergiev. Elizabeth Matos is a good Cassandra; Danielle Barcelona is a good Dido. Lance Ryan who has a big voice, sings Aeneas, but his performance lacks subtlety and his diction in French is poor. Singers for the secondary roles are adequate to good.

The staging was made by La Fura dels Baus. I loved their ""Damnation de Faust"" for the Salzburg Festival 1999, and their staging for the Valencia Ring is impressive. But directing here is in my opinion a big missed opportunity. The opera takes place here in a futuristic world like ""Star Wars"". For my taste, it doesn't work. Costumes are ridiculous and ugly. Poor Danielle Barcelona. She is a wonderful singer. How they managed to disfigure her here. Dressed her in an awkward sort of kimono, and her head is covered with an ugly wig. She looks ridiculous, like a caricature of the Mikado in the famous Gilbert and Sullivan operetta... A sad joke

And the direction succeeds in spoiling all the great moments of opera. The mass suicide of Cassandra and the women, one of the highlights of the opera, then entirely not effective here, as it happens behind the heavy curtain and a strong red background, that barely lets see. Another highlight of the opera, the great duet for Dido and Aeneas at the end of the fourth act, is destroyed by the director that chooses to put the two singers on a basket suspended in the air as they sing a passionate love duet, when there is no eye contact between them at all... etc. ...

Not recommended

The Gardiner 2003 performance is currently the best available on DVD and Blu-ray.",1310169600,7,1814,4.785942492012779
4498650,5,B004Y9DF5A,"Do not let this great production of Les Trojans fall beneath the radar as it were, because of a few bad reviews on Amazon. Either because the individuals misunderstand the idea behind the staging,lack imagination, or have bias towards far out modern productions. First I will present the background to the composing of Les Troyens. Berlioz (1803-1869) studied Latin under his fathers tuition. The characters of Virgils Aeneid became very familar to him. ""So well do I know them, that I imagine that they know me,""he later wrote. So for 40 years he carried around the idea of Troy and the founding of Rome in his head. But as the music climate was mediocre, he knew it would be difficult to produce the opera at the Paris opera. On the urgings of Lizsts mistress Countess Sayn-Wittgenstein,he changed his mind. Beginning in 1856, he finished the libretto and score in two years. In form the libretto is influenced by Gluck. The opera is in five acts with ballet. Another influence is Shakespeare,not only in the love duet whose text is inspired by Lorenzo's and Jessicas,The Merchant of Venice,but elsewhere. He called Les Troyens ""Virgil Shakespeareanized."" He saw his music as revolutionary, an attempt to change the inane operas being seen at the Paris opera. His had depth and seriousness. He made two operas of it,La prise de Troy and Les troyens a Carthage. The only offer he got to put it on, was from Theatre Lyrique. He only heard the three Acts of Les Troyens a Carthage and that was massively cut. He never heard the first two acts. It was not until 1957 that a near complete Les Troyens was given at Covent garden. For further details about Berlioz's Life,obtain I, Berlioz,a DVD by Tony Palmer. Also,the Memoirs of Berlioz,translated by David Cairns. Panther Books 1970.

 This is myth staged for the era of the computer,and what it could do to the planet if we are not too careful. As the notes state""In the 1970's some computer programmers knowing the ruse of the ancient Greeks called a subtle kind of computer virus, a ""Trojans Horse"".Hense on stage, you see a horse with screens all over it. The production team turned the Trojan war, for war is common to all ages,to screens and all the technology of our age. The civilization is destroyed by viruses and computer worms. A system error causes the computer to crash,bringing to an end the World as we know it. Just as Cassandra's warnings  were ignored, so this world deaf and blind to its weaknesses,collapses. Leaving behind a bunch of electronic junk. Queen Dido ideal Nation State recalls a futuristic particle accelerator. As such, it can only represent only a transitional stage in mankind's belief in progress. Three millennia later,Aeneas's decision to set off to Italy, will acquire a Universal dimension,implying the exploration of new Worlds, including new Planets like Mars.""In simple terms, the Trojans take the Computers off the Horse and infect themselves. Carthage is an ideal society,using clean renewable energy. The refugees are taken in by Carthage. They infect the city with the virus and then leave for Mars.

This is Sci fi and Calus Padrissa production with his team, is very subtle,sophisticated, clever, imaginative, and witty. If you have no interest in Sc-fi you will not like it. It sticks to the plot and what Berlioz wanted like some modern productions of the Wagner Ring cycle. The opening is doom laiden. Cassendra is musing about the future which you see. The vultures eating the bodies. The priest Lacoon,throwing a spear at the horse. serpents kill him. That you do not see in the other three Versions I have of this opera. She sits in a wheel chair, saddened, aged, and gets out of it to sing and sits back in it. Which makes sense. depressed with what will come. The sporting outfits suit this society. A symbol of where its priorities lie. A city under siege by the Greeks. Carthage is lighter. Set in part of the particle accelerator, as in Geneva, Switzerland. Dido's dress would fit into a traditional production. The hair gives a futuristic touch. Some have commented on this. Well, if you do not like the production,you will point this out as a fault.  The costumes are brightly coloured and again traditional. Space suits do come into it as well. I like the part, where a singer is attached to a space craft above the Earth. Aeneas is camped below. When he leaves Carthage he flies to Mars in what looks like the Trojan Horse made into a craft. The virus is in a pod in Carthage, when Dido kills herself on top of it, blood and fire destroy it. It is brilliant and well thought out. If you like Kublicks 2001, Aviatar,The Dune Mini Series, etc you will love this. Opera staging is becoming experimental,breaking away from the idea that staging must remain the same. With the new technology imagine what can be done. naturally, as always happens the old guard will fight back. Opera is changing. I grew tired of the same old  100 year old stage rubbish. I gave up on watching opera, until these new productions came out. This is an opera for the young and the thinkers.

Now to the performance,this Les Troyens,is even better, then the Valencia Ring. The Orchestra of the Comunitat Valenciana is conducted by Valery Gergiev,passionately and with swift tempi, as this should be. Staged by the La Fura dels Baus. As good as ever. Staged in the palace of Arts, Reina Sofia,Valencia. The stage director is the marvellous imaginative,Carlus Parissa, who has done for Les Troyens, what Chereau did for the Ring. Costumes are very avant guarde. Very today,or tomorrow. The singers are extremely good. Elisabete Matos is Cassandre. I never knew she was such a fine singer, going on her performance in the Ring as Gutrune. Lance Ryan is a Siegfried and deals with the part of Enee better then you might think. Dido is Daniela Barcellona, a great mezzo, as good as Troyanos in the Met set. That is praise indeed. If you want more of Barcellona, there is a DVD with her on in the Rossini TDK opera called Tancredi. Traditionalists will love that set. Anna Dido's sister is Zlata Bulicheva. Their duet blew my mind. Stephen Milling is Narbal. What voices.  This is  how Les Troyens should be sung. Brava. This is a Blu ray I will keep coming back to.

Now to the other Les Troyens and how do they compare. I am fond of the  Traditional Mets Levine DVD, with Norman as Cassandra, what a voice. Domingo as Enee, and Troyanos. What passion. This is how Berlioz imagined  Dido to sound. He loved her you see. The  Camberling version, conducting the orchestra of Paris,is fine. The staging is modern,White Wall,minimalist staging, black costumes in the two parts of this opera. Deborah Polaski takes both parts of Cassendre and Dido. Very fine and strong voice. All the parts are well taken. The tempi are fast. No ballet. A relief to some I imagine. Now to the Gardiner Les trojans in DVD and Bluray. I got this copy when it first came out years ago. The Orchestra of the Revolutionnaire et Romantique playing original instruments is conducted by John Eliot Gardiner. The sound is different. The brass section actually snarls. The staging ,none better, so are most of the singers,including Gregory Kunde and Ludovic Tezier. The problem is the miscasting of Cassandre and Dido. The two light soprano's Antonacci and Graham are good singers,but are not suited to these parts, not because they voices are too light, but they lack passion. Hear Norman, Troyanos, Polaski, and Barcellona and you will see what I mean. For me Graham and Antonacci  ruined a good performance. I would award it only three stars. The other two are five stars",1309478400,11,7627,4.7681818181818185
4498651,1,B004Y9DF5A,"I had high hopes for this performance, given the same directorial team's production of Wagner's Ring cycle. My viewing experience got off to a bad start in being unable to access the subtitles. But this was the least of my worries. This magnificent, though sprawling opera is positively mangled in the Valencia production. There are so many horrors to be encountered on this DVD that a major essay would be required to detail their totality.

The first act has Cassandra being wheeled on in a wheelchair. It is not long before she miraculously proceeds to easily walk around the stage only to reposition herself in the wheelchair on occasions during the act. In the third act Didon is fitted out with a afro wig that makes her look like Minnie Mouse. The action seems to be taking place within a computer and there are suggestions of  Trojan viruses and so forth. The costuming is continually weird and incongruent; echoes of Star Wars,baseball uniforms and what have you. Lance Ryan appears to be wearing the same dreadlocks wig he utilised in the Ring cycle. Given the vast expense this production would have incurred, they must have needed to cut some corners!

The jewel of the opera, the ballet and love scene in act four is virtually a total failure, going down as the proverbial limp lettuce. The only redemption is encountered in some artful dancing where one encounters a rare episode of simplicity. The love duet has the two singers suspended and hardly making eye contact. Perhaps Lance Ryan is not really turned on by a Minnie Mouse lookalike! I could go on but I trust you are getting the message. If this issue has any merit, it would be for the laughs it might generate in viewing the absurdities of the production. To my eyes, this staging is a parody of Berlioz's masterwork.

Given the distractions of this production, the musical values are somewhat overwhelmed. As it is, the saving grace of this enterprise would be the orchestral playing under the estimable direction of Valery Gergiev. The singing is generally satisfactory but there are a number of singers with wide vibratos. To my ears there are no standout performances like those encountered in the Gardiner set. Lance Ryan's French diction is poor and I found his voice unattractive and strained on  occasions.

It was a relief to review the magisterial version from the Chatalet Theatre conducted by John Elliot Gardiner. In this production the sets, costumes and direction are simple, uncluttered and tasteful. The singing is far superior and consistently satisfying. Here one can experience the true majesty of Berlioz's great opera. I would avoid the Valecia issue unless you are after a good laugh at a ridiculous example of Eurotrash. As we would say in Australia, and I mean no disrespect to the noble canine species, this production is a real dog.",1308787200,17,2834,4.857142857142857
4498652,2,B004Y9DF5A,"Berlioz's Les Troyens is one of the greatest and most beautiful operas ever written.  Musically, it is very well served in this blu-ray from Valencia.  Valery Gergiev deserves plaudits for his marvelous conducting of this sprawling score. He has at his disposal a virtuoso orchestra, outstanding chorus and soloists and they serve him and Berlioz well. Pre-eminent is Italian mezzo Daniela Barcellona as Didon.  Her ample, lustruous voice fills the part in ways that reminds one of its previous big voiced great exponents such as Christa Ludwig and Jessye Norman.  One could think of more polished tenors as Aene than Lance Ryan, but he fits the part ably if shy of outstandingly.  Then there is the marvelous work by the Portuguese soprano Elisabete Matos as Cassandre, a strong dramatic voice I did not know until now; I hope to encounter it again.  In short, musically this is a splendid reading and were one watching with one's eyes closed, it would be a marvelous recording in vivid surround-sound.

I thoroughly admired the work that Carlus Padrissa and La Fura dels Baus did for Wagner's Ring also in Valencia.  Indeed, for me those performances constitute the most satisfying filmed Ring so far, musically and visually, and the production,even if unconventional, always illuminating text and music.  With Les Troyens, they totally missed the boat.  They set the opera in what perhaps can be considered mythical cyberspace.  Troy is dark, and the Trojans are dressed in what look like hockey uniforms (what is usually presented as dance, here becomes a boxing match with ropes and rounds cards).  When the opera shifts from tragic Troy to sunny, happy Carthage, what we are given is the claustrophobic insides of what looks like a cyclotron, and the costumes get even more nonsensical, incorporating computer screens.  All of this absurdity enlightens nothing, calls attention to itself, and fights some of the most beautiful music ever written for the operatic stage.  I felt like giving the disc only one star or none given how inimical to the work the staging feels.  I gave it two stars because the musical values are so strong.  I wound up repeating the second Carthage act from the Royal Hunt and Storm to the end just to hear the ecstatically beautiful music, this time with my eyes closed.  Yes, it is very well performed once you shut your eyes.

The worse aspect of the Valencia production is that for any lover of Les Troyens you sense a most disturbing tension: warfare between the mise-en-scene and the score it is supposed to serve. It's almost offensive in the disregard shown text and music.

So ... caveat emptor.  If you want a very well performed Troyens that does not visually offend, though with perhaps less of the musical, modern orchestra impact encountered here, I recommend the one from the Chatelet conducted by John Eliot Gardiner with a beautifully sung Didon: Susan Graham.

8448010,4,B004Y9DF5A,"Having seen this production live in San Francisco just recently (SF Opera is one of the producing companies) I can say that it is impressive and absorbing.  Any production of an opera of this length is going to be a mixture of compelling and puzzling choices.  However, David McVicar succeeds on the whole.  The Industrial Revolution setting (basically setting it in the period just before Berlioz wrote it) makes for arresting theatre.  Gone are the togas and garlands.  We get a stark and bleak Troy on the verge of destruction, a nightmare out of the drawings of Piranesi. The Trojan Horse itself is a coup de theatre and is truly menacing.  Acts I and II get the opera started off on very strong footing.

By contrast to Troy's oppressive mechanization, Carthage is all salmon colored stone, Moorish arches, and diaphanous lighting. Dido's realm comes off as a bit cartoonish in comparison to Troy.  While it works to portray Carthage as actually Northern African, there is still a nod to a certain Orientalism in how blankly pretty Carthage is.

Act IV is a model of economy, during which McVicar lets the action unfold--the great love duet is all the more arresting for its simplicity and lack of directorial fuss.  Berlioz's ballets (a must for French opera of the period) are integrated well enough.  Act V is when McVicar makes some egregious errors for my taste.  The set pieces become incoherent (the ship on which the sailor sings his glorious song is all but an afterthought) and Dido's immolation is completely botched as a robot threatens to eat Carthage.  This is the most disappointing of McVicar's choices.  He robs Dido of the spectacle she deserves at the end of what is essentially her opera.

But when you make strong choices you get failures.  And McVicar makes choices here.  As is his style, everything (except the robot) is tasteful and thoughtful and sometimes quite thrilling. This production will probably the definitive TROYENS of our time and will be around for many years.",1435536000,,2004,4.864306784660767

But, unlike a couple of more recent recordings of Troyens, eurotrash is held to a minimum. The role of Aeneas, which gave a couple of well known tenors at the Met fits, is well handled by Brian Hymel. The two female leads (Antonacci and Westbroek), are also standout.
