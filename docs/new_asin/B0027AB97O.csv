8354352,4,B0027AB97O,"Beauty In Trouble is a complex drama regarding what people do for love... Love of self, love of family, and love of children.  Everyone seems to have to sacrifice something.  Touching, but also gritty.

In Czech with English subtitles.",1364774400,,235,4.9743589743589745
8354353,4,B0027AB97O,"The ""evil"" step-father steals the show here, lecturing his stepdaughter's kids about behaviour and telling them their father is really in jail for stealing cars, not in India where the mother had told the kids he was. This is a family tale about a dysfunctional lot in Prague. We see scenes of the city where the tourists don't go. Then a white knight enters the picture and everything begins to change. The script and acting here are first rate. And the soundtrack matches the mood.",1277424000,2,483,4.694117647058824
8354354,4,B0027AB97O,"I was recently turned on to a brilliant Czech director, Jan Hrebejk, by a colleauge of mine. Since then I have become a Hrebejk-aholic. After watching some of his earlier, more popular films (Up and Down, Divided we Fall) I picked up ""Beauty in Trouble.""  Upon inspection of the cover I must admit, I was a bit skeptic (haunting images of ""How Stella got her Groove Back"" came to me all to quickly), but nevertheless I remained loyal to Hrebejk and proceeded optimisticly.

Within minutes I was hitting myself for my prior cover-judgements (that old addage, ""never judge a book by its cover"" seems to be much more applicable to films these days).

What unfolded before me was nothing less than cinematic poetry, which is appropriate due to the fact that it is adapted from a Robert Graves poem of the same title. The film takes place in a troubled part of Prague, both aesthetically and economically, just after the 2002 floods. It is here where we are introduced to our ""Beauty"", Marcela (the gourgeous Anna Geislerova). A young mother of two, her situation is thus: living in a shamble of a flat connected to her husband's illegal chop shop. However in all this ruin there is one saving factor in their relationship, the sex. Unfortunately, the sex won't keep their children healthy and happy. With this in mind Marcela takes them and moves into her mother's just after her husband, Jarda, is arrested for stealing a car from a wealthy vintner, Evzen Benes(Josef Abrham).

Upon moving in with her mother we are introduced to two of the more charismatic characters of the film, as well as Hrebejk's true talents as a director; his ability to make you both truly hate and love everyone in his films. What Marcela and her kids move into is nothing short of comedic justice, a loving yet overly-timid mother and an evil stepfather (think the grinch with a comedic streak) who's first question to Marcela's tween daughter is if ""she's been felt up by any boys lately"" and for an encore offers Marcela's even younger son a beer. His sharp tongue and backwards idea of generosity know no ends.

One day while visiting her husband in jail Marcela runs into Evzen, who not only provides Jarda with a lawyer but begins a strangely satisfying courtship with Marcela.  He houses them in his Czech residence, takes them on trips to his vineyard home in Tuscany, even going as far to inviting Richard, the stepfather, along as well.

The outcome, you must see for yourself. However it's not the plot that drives this movie, but everything else. From the soundtrack which is brilliantly incorporated into the movie, to the sheer beauty of locations (Prague, Tuscany, etc.)  But the real driving force in this film is Hrebejk's keen eye for detail as well as his truly unconditional love for every character in this film. He does this brilliantly by using humorous character flaws that somehow make each character seem even stronger.

Fans of single-dimensional movies beware, there is no black and white in this film. It is this sea of grey that causes you to hate to love the ""good guys"" and love to hate the ""bad guys."" Woody Allen fans and fans of intelligent humor alike, you know what im talking about, and will find yourself wondering whether or not Jan Hrebejk might be a long lost Czech cousin of his.",1255478400,15,3296,4.718260869565217
