Watching the film your head swims as much as the characters as they are pulled into a nightmarish kidnapping/violence game against each other.  It had a lot to say about how women are viewed as subjugated by ""traditional"" roleplay to the point where they turn against each other.  Each one starts out an independent person and gets kidnapped and forced to play and wear swimsuits- something which reminded me alot of the roughie style of the Ameros and Findlays more than the slasher films of today.  However, this could be the third film in ""Grindhouse"" while it also has an art house sensibility to it . One of the most suspenseful films I've ever seen, comparable to the original TCM or Last House on the Left.  See it see it see it before it becomes a cult classic!!!",1255478400,11,925,4.508982035928144

8336709,3,B001QWQJ38,"Thot I'd give this film a try - being the sucker I am for 'girls in chains' scenarios - the 'reviews' were certainly all over the map but it was cheap enuf...

On initial viewing - I found this to be a fairly engrossing, if somewhat confusing, ambitious amalgam of stock slasher concepts with a 'south of the border' spin. The 'engrossing/confusing' aspects were due in part to the Spanish language w/ English subtitles element that required a lot of fast reading to try to keep up with the characters and action in the plot - much of which was delivered in a creative, but often difficult to follow, style of time-shifting editing that jumped around between the present and past to try to give background to the various individuals in the storyline.

The plot was presented in an intriguing manner - beginning w/ a scene of two young dudes who are driving in the night - looking for a 'mythical' brothel - when they have a collision with a scantily clad young woman who leaps out in front of their vehicle.  This shocking incident is rapidly dispensed with, however, and the action turns to a 'mysterious' group of bikini clad cuties at a large villa who are enigmatically preparing for some sort of 'party'.  The duration of the plot focuses on this group, as it becomes apparent that they are being held captive by some very nasty/murderous folks, and the back-story of 'what it's all about'.is slowly introduced to the audience ..  culminating in a 'surprise ending' of sorts.

This movie has blatantly obvious ties to ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and relies upon the shock value of sudden/unexpected brutal attacks upon the captive girls to deliver its' thrills - as the 'viewer' is slowly introduced to what's going on.

For an inexpensively produced Mexican indie effort ""36 Pasos"" (36 Steps) has a fairly high quality professional feel to it. The most positive element (for those that appreciate such...) is that it provides a bevy of attractive young 'chicas' who spend the entire film dressed only in bikinis whilst they are being tormented and dispatched in various gruesome ways. The negative factor is that it STRUGGLES! to present its', somewhat complex, story, and develop sympathy for the characters - while presenting a cavalcade of horror cliches' that just don't 'pack the punch' they once did. Personally I found it hard to physically distinguish between the 6 actresses - many of whom looked pretty similar, and just when you thot you had them figgered out 'boom!' they were dead - and gone!  Lotsa 'skin' on display - thanks to the swim- suit wardrobe - but only VERY brief 'artsy' flashes of actual nudity - during a sequence that shows how the girls were 'conditioned'.

As another reviewer has noted - this is a film that bears watching more than once - primarily because it takes most of the first viewing just to keep up with the sub-titles and nebulous frantic action. On a second go-round one could sit back and, perhaps, more 'relish' the depravity of it all. As is often the case - much sloppiness of execution may be 'forgiven' if there's a goodly helping of attractive females in the mix - ""36 Pasos"" does provide 'muchas chicas bonitas' and scores nicely on that front. Worth a watch - if you enjoy such fare!",1437004800,,3244,4.73758865248227

8336712,1,B001QWQJ38,"From memory, this got an OK overall rating from the community.

If I could give this a big ZERO I would. I have watched a lot, and I mean a lot of horror films from many eras and countries and this for me was one of the most pointless films I have ever seen.

There was some strange religious imagery going on at one point - perhaps the writer/s and/or director have some issues on that score they tried (unsuccessfully) to commit to the big screen.

This was almost a genre-less film, to call it a film is doing the cinematic canon an injustice.

The scenario was populated by unattractive people who I would have been happy to see eviscerated but the film was so badly shot, and the dialogue so meaningless, the only person I ended up feeling sorry for was me (for buying this absolute crock).

It had not one original idea, not one interesting shot, nothing to say about anything, just full of unattractive Mexicans doing nothing in particular.

From the opening seconds, I knew it was going to be a stinker, and my intuition was spot on. It is a testament to the crappiness of this film that I could put the DVD at three times normal speed with no sound and keep track of what was happening (very little if anything).

Even the mounting body count was boring.

A complete and utter waste of time. One for the shredder. I wouldn't inflict this film on my worst enemy.",1385769600,9,1370,4.387351778656127

8336714,5,B001QWQJ38,"36 PASOS (36 STEPS) is an absolutely crazy movie w/ a disturbing story about abduction, torture, murder, and revenge. Mostly, it's about utter insanity! A gaggle of bikini-clad uber-hotties are getting ready for a birthday party. Unfortunately, nothing is as it initially appears, and these women are in for a vicious, blood-soaked nightmare! The disjointed, disorienting style of the film screams for repeat viewings! The first time through, I was almost lost in the whirlwind! Add this one to your collection.
