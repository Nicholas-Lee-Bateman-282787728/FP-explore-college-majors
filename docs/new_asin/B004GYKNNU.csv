8429087,3,B004GYKNNU,"If you're curious about the performances of Robert DeMayo and the Nedoslov Russian Deaf Theater, this is worth picking up. However, don't expect much footage from the other artists featured in ""See What I'm Saying."" There is only a short clip of CJ Jones' comedy routine and one performed song from TL Forsberg, with small clips from other performers (Michael Davis, Max-i-Mime, Megg Rose).

There was some cool stuff on this DVD; I really enjoyed the abc story & fingermime from DeMayo. However, the production values of the filming and editing were really poor. Also, the menu navigation was confusing and cumbersome. The shoddy way the DVD was put together was disappointing and made everything seem amateurish. I wish the filming, editing and presentation of content was given more attention, to make it easier to enjoy the material.",1383264000,,837,5.065217391304348
