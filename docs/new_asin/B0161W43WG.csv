7455836,5,B0161W43WG,"If David Lynch and John Waters had teamed up to make a porn flick in the 70s, this is what the end result would probably look like. Filmed in glorious black-and-white and possessing a weird dreamlike atmosphere and long-winded soliloquies mixed with full-on graphic intercourse, ""Thundercrack"" is like nothing you've seen before. It takes the old horror film cliche of disparate travellers becoming stranded in a mysterious old house and not only turns it on its' ear--it knocks it on its' a** and penetrates with everything it's got!! Horny gorillas, pickled bodyparts, blow-up dolls, vomit-encrusted wigs,  ""Thundercrack"" will blow your mind!!

For years, the copies being sold here were bootlegs and the quality is what you'd expect from 2nd or 3rd generation VHS dubs. Synapse Films has been working on a fully-restored, 180-minute director's cut for some time and its taken forever since (as one of their reps stated) ""this thing looks like it was shot on toilet paper"".

Finally, just scraping under the wire to be released in time for its 40th Anniversary, comes a restored BluRay release with the Bonus Features fans have been dreaming of for years including outtakes and audition footage. I ordered mine direct from their website it arrived early and Ive posted screen grabs and comparisons here. There is a disclaimer in the liner stating how difficult this project was since only a handful of usable prints were at their disposal and that the resulting DVD and Bluray is about as good as its going to get. There is a definite improvement but don't expect HD. Also, the dialogue was unintelligible through much of the film previously and this too has been improved although there are several instances where one must still strain to hear, so the English subtitles are most welcome. The best part about this release is that scenes and dialogue that were cut have been reinstated (including Gerts final monologue which is much longer on the new version).

The Bluray comes with a Bonus Disc of exclusive extras, the most interesting being a 1976 public access TV show that features Curt McDowell and Marion Eaton being interviewed shortly after the film was released. Ms. Eaton comes across as extremely articulate in discussing her role and the character of Gerts motivations (shes also a dead ringer for Carole King in this clip); this in stark contrast to McDowell who seems incoherent and out of his element while fielding questions. There are also outtakes and silent audition footage, in which hopefuls slouch into the same easy chair for their screen test before disrobing and displaying their naked fronts and back sides.

If you love offbeat cinema and weird 70s Exploitation flicks, this one is a MUST-HAVE--get it!! And don't forget to peel a nice cucumber to enjoy however you wish while watching.",1444089600,67,2817,4.997867803837953
7455837,4,B0161W43WG,"If porn offends you, don't watch or buy this movie.

Thundercrack! is a long movie.  It's filmed in black and white with a plot characteristic of the vintage porn era.  Considering the subject-matter, the cinematography wasn't bad, the music wasn't bad and the acting wasn't bad.  The movie alternates endlessly from one hard-core porn scene to the next.  Thundercrack! has it all, girls with girls, guys with guys, girls with guys, numerous sex-toys, porn scenes with a Gorilla, ... on and on.  I gave the movie 4 stars due to the Gorilla porn, which was ""over the top,"" even for this movie.",1454976000,,592,4.754901960784314
7455838,4,B0161W43WG,"Holy Moly, they really don't make them like this any more!  This is the absolute limit of 1970's film making, a brief period in history when hardcore might meld with mainstream and artistic experimentation was everywhere.  Keeping in mind that this was shot on film - having used film, I can personally attest to its difficult nature - and was done on a shoe string with mostly unprofessional talent except in a few key roles, this I an amazingly polished film with something to offend everyone.  Taking off on soap opera styled films like those directed by Douglas Sirk, this has explosive over-emoting in an old dark house on a dark and stormy night.  Every perversion - and I do mean every - rears its ugly head as a group of strangers get even stranger with each other.  The result is high camp and high art at the same time.

The film, which was made around 1975 and threatened with DVD release since 2004, really comes from the underground fringe of San Francisco.  Naturally, there is a gay bend to the end results, but there is plenty of hetero activity as well.  I guess mention should be made of the female gorilla escaped from the zoo as well, because that also goes in a explicit direction as well.  Nothing is played straight but it never devolves into farce.  It's nuts but camp, a reflection of the American emotional hysteria of the 1950s and 1960s.  That's what makes it art - challenging art, according to your sexual preferences and tastes, but powerful art.

I should give it five stars because the Blu-ray / DVD combo is lovingly done with many great extras and the quality of the film is impressive, but the viewer needs to be warned that this is serious Avant Guard territory.  Proceed with cautious, but for the right audience, this is a masterpiece of subversion.",1454716800,13,1788,4.6025236593059935

7455843,1,B0161W43WG,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

To say youve never seen anything like this movie is an understatement. Truly, there has never been a movie made prior to this one like it and even following its creation nothing compares. Whether you consider it art, exploitation or just plain crap will depend on your point of view. I was stunned by the number of favorable reviews to be found on imdb.com for this movie, so much that I had to assume they were either written by cast or production members or those that find things like elephant feces tossed on a canvas to be art. That being said I think you can tell where my mind is when talking about this movie. If you loved it Im glad that you enjoyed it. I think that the majority of people will be like myself, unaware of what exactly they're getting into and wondering why they bought or rented this disc.

The story, as much of one that there is, involves the stereotypical old dark house theme. Well at least to begin with. Various drivers find themselves stranded during a storm with only one nearby house to go to thats supposed to be a mansion. The hand drawn graphics used show a mansion, the interior screams someones house that could be used for this movie. The owner of the house is weird to say the least. While some whove reviewed her performance as Shakespearean it felt more like it like someone trying out for a junior high school play who was turned down. This character talks about her late husband, killed by locust and whose body parts she retains pickled in various jars around the house.

As the film progresses she tells her guests that they can change into dry clothes she has in the house in a different room. While they change she watches through a hole in the wall masturbating with a shaved cucumber the whole time. I told you this was weird. And this is where the movie changes from old dark house to possible art film to straight out porn. Each of the guests who enters becomes involved in various sex acts: masturbation, girl on girl, guy on girl, guy on guy, guy on blow up doll. Those are the few I can remember. Ive tried to block out most of this film and have been for the most part fairly successful.

Shot in black and white, my guess is to make it qualify for art status, the movie is filled with poorly shot, poorly lit and poorly acted segments. If there was directing involved Im not sure what it was. The script jumps from one thing to the next and is filled with various diatribes about things hard to decipher or that you won't want to decipher. For instance a guy in love with a gorilla, played by someone in what is perhaps the worst gorilla suit of all time. Think back to any gorilla seen on a show like GILLIGANS ISLAND. THAT gorilla looked real compared to this one.

If porn offends you, you will be offended by this film. If art films are not your thing, you will want to ignore this one. If you want to watch this movie for film historys sake then feel free; if you like that sort of thing youll be thrilled. For myself I don't find much artistic in films like this. It becomes a jumble of ideas, concepts, weird acting/directing/photographing and off the cuff items that it doesnt hold my interest for longer than a few minutes at best. Im admitting that Im more inclined to watch mainstream movies and favor those. But if this is your kind of thing then enjoy yourself while I watch something I consider more entertaining.",1453334400,5,3442,4.40566037735849
7455844,1,B0161W43WG,"I have no clue why this is getting such high reviews, which is the only reason I bought this film and as it turns out, I wasted my money.

First off, this does have ""hard core"" sex scenes, which doesn't bother me at all.

To sum it up...black and white, bad lighting, bad sound, bad sets, bad acting, bad camera work, bad editing, and finally, bad script.

This is a jumbled mess of a film that follows no real pattern and leaves one feeling like it was put together for about $5,000 by a bunch of high school dropouts who, while high, thought it would be a blast to make a pornographic movie. It is so poorly edited it cannot even be used for masturbatory purposes, and this isn't because it was filmed in 1975, it's because the guys who made this had no clue what they were doing. You go from a close up of a guys mustachioed face, then an out of focus guys butt pumping in and out, then a woman's breasts, then his mustachioed face, then the butt, then her stomach, then an out of focus close up of genitals, then his butt, then...you cut to a group of people sitting around a table and one guy is talking about falling in love with a gorilla while he worked at a circus. WTF!

This isn't an ""art film"" or a cult classic as claimed, unless you're in the cult of crap film making, this is a waste. If you enjoy extremely low budget porn than this might be up your alley.",1450742400,10,1372,4.166037735849057
7455845,5,B0161W43WG,"One of my earliest memories of San Francisco was being a student at the Art Institute and watching rushes of ""Thundercrack!"" with Curt McDowell.  My teacher, George Kuchar, had written the screenplay as well as had starred in it, and Marion Eaton was in the class watching the rushes with us.  It was the mid-70's, and I realized that absolutely anything was possible.  I've followed the film throughout the years, occasionally finding random screenings, but they had poor audio and the prints were terrible.  I'm really looking forward to this DVD release.  Melinda McDowell has been working on the project for years and it's great to see it's finally happened.  ""Thundercrack!"" is definitely one of the most original underground films of the '70's... it's not exactly porn, it's not exactly horror, it lives in its own world.  The film is a cross between Tennessee Williams, ""The Old Dark House"" and a 70's Mitchell Brothers film.  Don't miss it.",1448496000,17,948,4.955696202531645
7455846,5,B0161W43WG,"This film is truly an original. It has something for everyone, if you like the weird and kinky. The dialogue by George Kuchar is soap opera perfect. This DVD has some great extras with cast interviews and additional films.",1446422400,9,222,4.717948717948718
8735418,5,B0161W43WG,I loved seeing the full version. Better than the fuzzy recoded vcr tape version Ive had for 15 years.,1519171200,,101,4.368421052631579
8735419,4,B0161W43WG,"I first saw this at the wonderful Scala cinema club in London in the 1980s in a double bill with Pink Flamingos. I was a lamb to the slaughter! I knew nothing about Thundercrack! except it had a notorious MPAA X rating on the poster. Suffice to say that when Pink Flamingos came on it really didn't seem as outrageous as it should have. This was the two hour version of Thundercrack! that had about 30 minutes of dialogue cut. I thought that version was preferable to the massively long full version on this disc that also got shown at the Scala (it had two of only and handful of copies ever made shown there for years as a staple crowd pleaser).

It has taken years to bring this cult movie to a legal video release. This blu ray transfer is very good considering how low budget the film was. I can remember terrible sound in the cinema. Here it has been improved and has optional sub-titles but they are needed. Like the early films of John Waters this is classed as a trash movie. However, there is a big difference between trash and bad. It certainly is very low budget and lacking in all things technical. With the exception of the lead actress, performances vary from dodgy to appalling: some of the cast were from the porn industry. However, like John Waters movies, this transcends bad as it is made with real care and energy put into it. It is genuinely outrageous and witty and full of atmosphere: you can sense everyone pulling together to made this as good as they could. The film is heaving with hard-core scenes, though the objective is not the same as a porn movie and it certainly cant be described as one. However, it comes with a deserved warning!!

The release comes heaving with extras both on the blu ray and the DVD extras disc. These include documentaries, interviews, sex scenes out-takes (!!!!) and outrageous short features that would send most film censors scrambling for their scissors. An excellent release.",1500854400,,1937,4.579250720461095

8735423,4,B0161W43WG,"Well, about 7 years after they first announced it, Synapse Films finally issued their Blu-Ray at the zero hour of the 40th anniversary of the film.  There's been a bootleg of the ""uncut"" version in circulation for eons, but this premiere North American home video release puts it to shame.  The bootleg was transferred onto low-res VHS, it was improperly framed, and roughly four minutes worth of footage was missing (due to splicing from wonky projections).  It's clear that this transfer was predominantly sourced from the same negative - but there's a real night and day difference.  Details are remarkably sharp, a lot of the washed-out-picture problems have been rectified, missing footage has been reinstated, digital correction is subtle (but overwhelming when compared side-by-side to the bootleg) and, perhaps most importantly, the sound is no longer the muddy, garbled mess that it once was (still not perfect, but a tremendous upgrade - and there's accurate subtitles when in doubt).  They've also bloated the running time by restoring a 10 minute intermission in the middle, which I thought was weird at first but it sort of adds to the movie's bizarre, kitschy charm.

Okay, so now that I've rambled on about how impressive the transfer is, onto the annoyances.  The blu-ray itself includes virtually nothing in the way of extras directly related to the film; instead, they've tacked on a long interview with director Curt McDowell (which was recorded before the movie was conceived) as a commentary track and the feature-length documentary ""It Came from Kuchar"" (in which they dwell on Thundercrack for about 5 minutes).  The accompanying DVD, however, includes nearly a half-hour of outtakes, almost 20 minutes of alternate sex footage, and about 10 minutes of silent ""audition"" footage (everyone who auditioned had to get naked).  Clearly this near-hour's worth of material was newly-transferred, so it should've been on the blu-ray in 1080 clarity and the documentary (which is freely/legally available in HD on YouTube) should've been on the DVD.  I'm a little miffed about that.

Also included on the DVD are 2004 interviews with George Kuchar, Marion Eaton and composer Mark Ellinger (each roughly 10 minutes), a 1976 episode of ""San Francisco Bay Area Filmmakers"" with McDowell and Eaton, a trailer and five of McDowell's short films (along with a few others, four of them were on the VHS compilation&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Loads-of-McDowell/dp/B00HLSZ6OO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Loads of McDowell</a>, and these seem to be the same transfers).  Would've been nice to see some more shorts, but at least they included a few (and it's worth noting that the hilariously idiotic musical ""Boggy Depot"" sorta feels like a G-rated companion to ""Thundercrack!"").  Also included is a single-page folded booklet in which Synapse president Don May, Jr. discusses the long-delayed release and various technical problems they encountered.  The information in the booklet could've made a really interesting featurette (I would've loved to have seen some restoration comparisons), but they didn't bother.  I also find it completely bizarre that Melinda McDowell (sister of the late director) is nowhere to be found in the extras, since she appears in the film and is the one who spearheaded this release.  If you're hoping for insight into the making of the this cinematic oddity, the companion DVD offers a little - but not much.

Thundercrack! is sort of a no-budget Tennessee Williams horror-porno-epic on acid, meaning it's not for most tastes, but for those who've been seduced by its insane charms, this release is as good as it gets.  Realistically, my gripes regarding the extras are pretty minor considering Synapse's incredibly loving restoration of this completely one-of-a-kind film.",1456358400,13,3856,5.398333333333333
