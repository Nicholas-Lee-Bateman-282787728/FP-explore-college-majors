1920584,1,B0000D1FGC,"NASA mutates an ape and it crash lands in Satan's Hollow, a hang out for college teens who drive muscle machines and drink soda-pop. I enjoyed the retro aspect of the film, especially the diner with its cheap wood paneling, red and white Coca-Cola product placement, and orange Naugahyde booths. Note the pinky ring on Chris (Ralph baker jr.). He never worked in Hollywood again.

The mutated ape, which looked like someone got the wrong head for a Halloween costume, is also bullet proof. He is an acting and dance critic and kills bad ""B"" movie actors. Typical rift between Feds and local authorities. The film was fairly bad all around.

1920585,1,B0000D1FGC,"John Agar is a B film sci fi and horror legend from the 1950s. By the late 1960s, however, his once renowned B film career had sputtered to even sub-Tor Johnson depths. In the remaining decades of his life he was reduced from B film leading man to (ugh!) B film character actor. One of the last roles that Agar had, as a B film leading man was in 1967's Night Fright.

  Whereas the B films of the 1950s usually had a slight bit of professionalism left in them, as remnants from the days of studio control, by the late 1960s, B films had fallen into the hands of almost anyone with the will enough to make a film and had a few thousand bucks enough to make one. Sometimes the results could be masterful- think George Romero's Night Of The Living Dead. Most times, though, the results were not just bad, but bad in a haphazard way that showed the filmmaker didn't really give a damn about the film. Say what you will about the films of Ed Wood, but there was an attention to detail that, while poorly done, did exhibit some pride. The same cannot be said of James A. Sullivan's Night Fright.",1340236800,,1090,4.281553398058253
1920586,1,B0000D1FGC,"Okay, it's like this.  A super-secret government rocket experiment crashes, but the feds won't let the local sheriff see it.  Not long after there's a really nasty murder down on lover's lane.  Could the two things be connected?  In the meantime, and in spite of the sheriff's warnings, a group of teenagers decide to have a dance-and-make-out party down at the lake.  Have you ever tried to run from a monster while you are wearing go-go boots?

Released in 1967, NIGHT FRIGHT, also known as FRIGHT NIGHT, is the sort of movie where everybody gets in the car at night, and then we see car traveling in the daylight, and when they get out of the car its night again.  The teenagers aren't really teenagers, the actors aren't really actors, there's no script or plot to speak of, and the monster looks like a cast-off ape costume with a kinda-sorta lizard mask on top.  Sure, John Agar is in it, but his big claim to fame is that he was once Mr. Shirley Temple, and that's all you can say about him one way or another.

My thought: people who watch this movie have way too much time on their hands, and watching this movie will make that time seem way longer than it already does.  Skip it.

1920587,2,B0000D1FGC,"Alright, what can you expect from a movie that came out in the late 60's?  Not much.

Watching this movie was basically the same as watching an early episode of the Brady Bunch.  You know you used to watch that show.

My biggest problem with the movie is, of course, it wasn't scary at all.  What WAS scary was just how flat-out terrible the sound of the movie is.  I could barely understand anything the characters were saying.  Everyone's mumbling horribly.

The picture quality isn't much better.  Everything again looks like the year it came out, and nothing was done to improve the quality in any way.  Not that anyone would wanna come along and improve a DVD movie that's not any fun to watch in the first place.

I did like the variety of sound effects and music that was used throughout the movie.  Of course, it didn't match a ""scary bad guy hiding the woods"" because most of it was just early Pink Floyd-like sound effects and delicate King Crimson-sounding flutes.

I did like how the teenagers tried to act like rebels against the cops.  One of them threatened to ""play loud records and dance the night away"" haha.

However, that one song that kept playing during the scene where all the teenagers were laughably dancing outside in the woods was brilliant!  It sounded like the Beach Boys a little bit.  Really catchy song that one was.  You don't hear party music like that anymore.  Now it's all trashy unmemorable noise.

It really was hysterical watching the teens dance around in the woods in the dark listening to music.  I loved it.  They were taking it very seriously too, haha.

Overall, yeah, it's not scary, and not worth watching, unless for the great music of the late 60's.",1202342400,2,1699,4.59

1920589,3,B0000D1FGC,"John Agar is one of my favorite B-movie actors, and in this movie plays the heroic small town Sheriff struggling to overcome the horror of multiple monster attacks perpetrated on ""teenagers"" (who appear to be about 30 in actuality.)

The premise is boilerplate: a thing comes from space (it turns out to be man-made with radiation issues) bringing a horrifying monster which attacks young couples in their cars. It also finishes off the most cowardly Deputy since Barney Fife put a bullet in his service revolver. Most of the movie is spent running through the woods and watching some exceptionally bad lakeside dancing (in very laughable clothes and even worse hair) but we occasionally get glimpses of the monster which tend not to be especially terrifying as they were apparently filmed with black and black film: there is so little contrast and the print is so dark, you never really can see the monster. It appears to be a Bigfoot type creature with a Halloween mask on, but I can't really be sure. Eventually Agar and his enlistees (and obligatory love interest) fell the creature with supplies from a local contractor and the fright once again leaves the night.

This one is more boring than a typical Agar film, and pales compared to his masterwork ""Zontar, The Thing From Venus,"" but it's still enjoyable as a bit of camp.",1157846400,13,1331,4.807860262008734
1920590,2,B0000D1FGC,"John Agar has something of a fan following, but there's just no getting around the fact that he starred in a whole bucketful of terrible B-movies - including this snooze-fest.  Night Fright is about as boring a monster film as you'll ever find.  If all of the characters weren't so darned irritating, you could hardly sit through the whole thing without falling asleep.

It's a cookie-cutter script that was seemingly passed around like an unwanted fruit cake throughout the 1960s.  Something mysterious crashes out in the middle of nowhere, some young smoochers are killed (1960s monsters hated smoochers more than anything else in the world, you know), mysterious footprints are found near the scene, the local yokel sheriff tries to figure out what is happening to his peaceful little town, the local kids ignore all warnings and throw a big dance party out by the lake, a few more people die horrible, usually stupid, deaths (I would certainly call sitting in your patrol car, loaded weapon at your side, and doing nothing for a whole minute except watch the creature slowly stumble and bumble his way in your direction pretty stupid), a wooden scientist shows up with a laughable explanation for the murdering beast, and finally the hero comes up with an off-the-wall, cockamamie idea that goes horribly wrong yet manages to work out in the end.

All of this seems to take place in a Texas town, yet all of the local kids seem to be preppies (and let me tell you, it's not pretty when preppies fight) with really bad hairstyles.  We're apparently supposed to like a couple of them, but they are so goody-goody and constantly annoying that it's almost impossible to do so.  The monster, who is apparently some guy in a used gorilla suit and a Klingon mask, inspires nothing but ambivalence, although he does have more of a personality than the resident scientist.  John Agar is OK as the sheriff, but even he's not all that convincing.  I guess it's just hard to motivate yourself when you're working with such a dreadful script.

At times, you might think this were some kind of documentary, as so much of it consists of nothing more than people walking through the woods.  It could be worse, though - we could have been subjected to more torturous minutes of the kids dancing (if you can even call it dancing) to horrible music.  So, obviously, the film delivers nothing on the fright score.  What about the night part?  Well, it really doesn't deliver there, either, as half of the night scenes were apparently filmed in the middle of the day. Unless you're like me and enjoy watching terrible old monster B-movies, you'll want to steer clear of this turkey.",1142640000,2,2665,4.765217391304348
1920591,3,B0000D1FGC,"NIGHT FRIGHT stars John Agar as sheriff Clint Crawford. Life is good in his county until a flaming object (we never get to see it) crashes in the woods. A strange creature begins killing the local ""teenagers"" in their cool cars! Clint and his deputy are in hot pursuit, tracking the mutant when suddenly, the deputy is attacked and killed! We get lots of scenes of the beast lumbering through the trees, and a long ""teen"" (there's no one under 35 in this movie) dance sequence, showcasing the latest moves of 1967. Thankfully, the monster is only shown in darkness, thus avoiding total embarassment! Agar does his best to keep his dignity intact. Not a bad flick.

hear the crickets...but filmed during the day with the camera iris down a bit to make it look like night. Lots of running and more running. At least the script written for the tennagers is pretty funny as they use words no heard since the late 60's.  The creature is not too bad and looks a bit better than Robot Monster. Overhall the dvd is fun to watch up to a point because it has John Agar who appeared in so many interesting, bigger budget science fiction movies.",1075334400,19,534,4.235294117647059
7999898,5,B0000D1FGC,"NIGHT FRIGHT shares an eerie half-world with a handful of similarly modest but entertaining teen horror/sci-fi entries like GIANT GILA MONSTER, HORROR OF PARTY BEACH and DEATH CURSE OF TARTU. These are an uneasy mix of happily gyrating teens and skulking horror that are a guilty weakness of mine.

The storyline is standard stuff: a spaceship sent into the icy depths of Out There by dedicated scientists runs into unchecked radiation, and the test animals aboard are mutated. The largest and nastiest promptly goes on an eating binge. The film appears for be a rehash of themes already used in the obscure DEMON FROM DEVIL'S LAKE.

Granted, Texas isn't known for astounding advances in cinema. Larry Buchannan, the fevered brow at the helm of THE EYE CREATURES, IT'S ALIVE! and ZONTAR, THE THING FROM VENUS, hailed from Texas. THE GIANT GILA MONSTER was filmed in and around Cielo. Still...

John Agar, in one of his last ""earnest man with a job to do"" roles is a somewhat peeved lawman charged with finding out what exactly is killing the locals. He does well in the limited role, providing the film's one strong performance. The other characters are broadly written and almost painfully bland. The bizarrely named Roger Ready woodenly plays a scientist who knows more than he admits (and who is largely qualified as being a researcher by way of smoking a pipe). There's also a nerdy newshound, police resenting kids, and an extremely lackluster love interest.

That said, the overall film is actually fairly enjoyable. The monster, a hulking gorilla with facial spines and a Klingon head ridge, is reasonably impressive for a regional production. The isolated locales and dim photography add a certain appeal, though the latter occasionally flashes almost starkly bright (particularly during the climax where half the hunters seem to be waiting in the dead of night and the rest in some distant land where it's high noon). The government cover-up angle is expected, and should neatly justify the suspicions of any borderline paranoids in the audience.

Great film but, taken as a simple ""googly fiend run amok"" picture, it's more than passable.",1524787200,,2148,5.022471910112359
7999899,3,B0000D1FGC,"The movie itself was terrible. but what I liked about it was that it was so typical of the 60's movies and culture. Notice the girl's hairstyles, it was the age of ""big"" hair. The cars are the size of The Queen Mary, and can fit just about as many people. Dig the ""lingo"", ""Hey man, this is our bash, and if the fuzz don't like it, they should split.""  Lots of corny dialogue, and a public domain soundtrack. As with all 60's horror shows the creature doesn't show up until the end and it is very hokey, being a gatorgorillamammalreptilian wearing what looks like one of those 1940's-style leather football helmets.

7999906,2,B0000D1FGC,"from the 60's...made when I was just turning 8. I bought this as part of the Sci Fi 100. For 23 cents its a great movie for pre teens,no nudity or swearing.",1424908800,,156,3.90625
7999907,2,B0000D1FGC,"The opening scene of this incredible movie sets the stage for the next 75 minutes.  A young couple is necking in the woods when a radio announcement alerts listeners to a fiery object that fell from the sky.  Shortly thereafter, something approaches the car and then we cut to a laughing girl's face.

Then some really exciting stuff happens and another young couple frolics here and there, ending up - there is no way you could have seen this coming - in the SAME WOODS!  What an amazing coincidence that another young couple ends up in the same woods as the first young couple.  Sadly, the first young couple was a victim of ""something,"" and the second young couple discovers the first young couple.

Never fear, Sheriff Clint Crawford, played by veteran actor John Agar, is on the case.  Agar first came to fame as the husband of America's Sweetheart Shirley Temple.  While Agar appeared in a number of movies that are considered classics, including ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" and ""The Undefeated,"" many of Agar's films ended up as the third feature at drive-ins, including this extremely lightweight effort.

Speeding forward, much of the movie focuses on people running around in the woods, intermittently focusing on this horrible creature that looks like a mutant ape, but which the characters in the movie claim is some sort of mutant alligator.  Is it an ape?  Is it an alligator?  Maybe it is an apigator, or perhaps an alliape.  Call it what you will, it looks much like an ape costume with some sort of weird head on it, though the head is not all that reminiscent of an alligator.

This movie contains some classic moments.  The creature chases the sheriff in the woods.  The sheriff runs while the creature sort of shambles.  The sheriff climbs over fallen trees and through brush as he runs.  The creature, which hardly seems very agile, catches up.  In one of the funny moments of the movie, the creature knocks the sheriff down and knocks off the sheriff's hat.  The sheriff gets up and runs, but before he runs he stops to pick up his hat.

Since this movie is from the 1960's, we also have the obligatory party scene with mediocre rock and roll, girls in miniskirts or dresses, and an occasional go-go boot thrown in for good measure.  One of the funniest scenes is when the party in the woods breaks up and everybody leaves, but the obnoxious guy (these movies often have an obnoxious guy; being obnoxious in a cheesy horror film is like wearing a red shirt on the original ""Star Trek"") is not leaving.  Of course his girlfriend has to stay with him.  You know the creature is coming!

Sadly, we never get a really good look at the creature.  On the other hand, maybe it is better that the creature mostly appears in dim light or shadows, because I suspect the special effects budget of this movie was on the thin side.  So, you can expect very little gore and the primary special effect is a guy in a gorilla suit with some sort of head attached to the suit that is supposed to make the suit appear to be a mutant ""something.""

I did note with interest that the character ""Sue"" was played by Brenda Venus.  However, I watched this movie like four times and was unable to figure out which character was ""Sue.""  The reason I focus on Brenda Venus is because she played the character ""George"" in the Clint Eastwood movie ""The Eiger Sanction,"" and if you have seen the uncut version of this movie you will understand why she is so memorable.  Part of the problem in hearing the name ""Sue"" is that the sound quality leaves something to be desired.  There were places where I could barely make out what the characters were saying, and in some cases I could not understand what was being said.

This movie is watchable because it is often funny if you watch it in the right way.  Indeed, this movie is perfect for a parody night, particularly since the movie contains certain scenes that are already funny, though they were obviously not intended to be funny.  In fact, unless you make fun of the movie, it is boring and just kind of sad that anyone thought the plot of this dog was sufficient to turn into a movie.  The only saving grace of this movie is that it is only 75 minutes long.

Good luck!",1361836800,,4214,4.526455026455026
