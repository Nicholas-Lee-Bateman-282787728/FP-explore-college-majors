That said, the video could have and should have been re-mastered at the very least. I ordered these in anticipation that like the originals, they would be in the original language and someone would have simply added subtitles.
The videos start out in Japanese and then all of a sudden, there is the obviously overdubbed (and amateurishly done I might add), English information. It's like finger nails on a chalkboard! I have rarely been impressed with ANYTHING Rising Sun Productions put their hands on. Videos are generally of fair to poor quality with someone reciting information that most anyone could find on the internet.
I give these videos 4 stars only because of their historical value and that JKA has no plans to produce a newer updated set, AND that some of these JKA legends are now deceased.",1414972800,,935,4.886792452830188
