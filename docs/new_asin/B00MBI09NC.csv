6567419,3,B00MBI09NC,"This review is written for all 4 volumes of Gundam UC, since I ordered them all together. I've been meaning to get the series since last year with the final release, but wasn't going to pay almost $200. I got them on DVD as well to fit the rest of the collection (all of which are DVD as well).

I absolutely LOVE Mobile Suit Gundam UC. It's one of the best two Universal Century series out of them all, with the other being 0083 Stardust Memory. The animation & soundtrack are well beyond expectation, I only wish they would redo the other UC era series with the current-age tech to give them the same level of graphical beauty as Gundam Unicorn (Not to mention it would FINALLY give ZZ Gundam & Victory Gundam a dubbed release).

HOWEVER, the reason that I rated them at only 3 Stars out of 5...

2 Day Shipping.

When I get 2 DAY shipping, I expect the order to arrive 2 days later, not 4 days Amazon...

My order was placed on Saturday, July 18th with a GUARANTEED arrival of Monday, July 20th. Yet, when I access the tracking later on it says that the guaranteed arrival is now Wednesday, July 22nd. My question; Why?

Overall, I'm well beyond satisfied with the product. It's just the delay in shipping that bugs me a bit. However it's the first issue I've had with Amazon, so I'll let it slide.",1437523200,,1301,4.333333333333333
6567420,5,B00MBI09NC,wow! what an ending!,1436313600,,20,4.25
6567421,5,B00MBI09NC,Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn is one of the best Universal Century Gundam animes to come out. Episode seven is the best episode that I have ever watched. I recommend this to anyone who loves the universal centrury timeline or gundam in general. The Unicorn Gundam is one of my favorite gundams out of the universal century timeline.,1430956800,,329,4.7894736842105265
6567422,5,B00MBI09NC,"The culmination of years of translations and dedicated artists has resulted in the best Universal Century (UC) Gundam series I have ever had the pleasure of watching. Beginning in Episode 1 and finishing in Episode 7, this series is the best version of the Gundam UC Timeline. Without a doubt, it stands as a marvel of animation and cinematography.

Gundam enthusiasts and new fans will enjoy the captivating story line, mature character development, and excellent Mobile Suit combat animation. I highly recommend this series to those who wish to enjoy a good story with a *SPOILER* Happy ending befitting the new timeline established in the series.*END SPOILER*",1427760000,2,662,5.186915887850467

6567427,5,B00MBI09NC,"I've just been impressed with the Unicorn series, every time I watched an episode it feels like I'm watching a movie. The soundtracks are great and the mobile suits in this episode especially are beautifully animated. In the initial battle between the Nahel Argama and the Sleeves, you pretty much see the Banagher and Federation fight against a ""floating museum"" of Zeon/ Neo Zeon suits  spanning a 23 year period! Some of them I don't think have been animated since the 70s or 80s, or never at all, except in printed materials.

 The episode is about an hour and a half long and has about 30 minutes of some special features, made up mostly of some clips from the episode/ series overall.",1415836800,,690,4.639344262295082
6567428,5,B00MBI09NC,"Gundam UC is a fitting finale of the Universal Century's ""Zeon V Federation"" era, bringing the bitterness of the One Year War and Neo-Zeon era to a close. This is by far one of the best episodes of the OAV series and a grand conclusion it is. The animation is top-notch, the music is emotionally powerful and the voice acting is some of the best even by ""dubbed"" standards.",1414800000,4,373,4.420289855072464
8671418,5,B00MBI09NC,I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he was so excited because he didn't think that you could ever get the Unicorn series in the US. Thank you Amazon!,1517529600,,160,4.193548387096774

8671421,5,B00MBI09NC,"Thanks to RightStuf taking over for the late Bandai, we get the final movie-length conclusion to this show. Episode 7: Over the Rainbow finishes the show in one 90-minute episode. Again, we get a nice budget release DVD with a reversible cover on a single disc. Hopefully we'll get the Blurays remade in America in the future but until then, these will do fine!",1464825600,,361,4.65625

8671423,4,B00MBI09NC,"Really good ending. I just hate the New Type crap that UC Gundam pushes. I wish they made a new UC Gundam with just good ole pilot skills vs pilot skills like 08th MS Team, 0080, and 0083; without the new type crap.",1457481600,,215,4.023255813953488
8671424,4,B00MBI09NC,Pace picked up with more action and questions answered.  Too bad this series couldn't develop further.  But served well tying the events within the Universal Century.,1456099200,,166,5.346153846153846
8671425,5,B00MBI09NC,Dare i say the best Gundam series to date. Good series with a satisfying ending with cameos from certain characters. I highly recommend this if you're a Gundam fan.,1448841600,,164,4.689655172413793
