8360948,2,B002BAW66S,"The parts I could watch were great. However, the recording is bad. I returned the first DVD because one of the concerts wouldn't play well and then the 2nd DVD also had issues playing parts of the DVD.",1406073600,,201,4.315789473684211
8360949,3,B002BAW66S,"Act III of Death Angel is one of my favorite album and they also deliver one of the best performance I have ever seen one Sunday evening at the Key Club - Los Angeles.

Hence, I was expecting the DVD to recapture the feeling at experience few years before.  Unfortunately, the DVD was not as good probably because the live was recorded in big venue.  Too bad, but still enjoyable.",1391731200,2,380,4.4
8360950,5,B002BAW66S,"I give this a 5 star rating ,Becuz  The first part of the 2 shows rock .Man i wish I was there. These guys put on one hell of a show. Definitely one of my favorite video's. I recommend this to any heavy metal fan of Death angel. One word AWSOME!!!!!!!",1388016000,,251,3.9215686274509802
8360951,4,B002BAW66S,"This DVD is a great buy- two long concerts and two promo videos.  Why not 5-stars?  Well, DA, the band gets 5 stars, but the second (indoor) show knocks one off.

Oddly, the first concert at the Rock Hard Festival from 2007 (before the release of Killing Season) is the better of the two, even though it's a bigger venue and outdoor, to boot.  Sound and visuals are great, although Ted Aguilar definitely gets short shrift- I realize Rob Cavestany is the leader and all, but we don't see much of ole Theodore and his beloved ESP's.

The 2008 shoot is indoor, but the shoot, if it is professional, is grainy at times and the sound isn't as good as the older concert.  Sadly, this is probably the last time viewers will see Dennis Pepa (Bass) and Andy Galeon (Drums) who left the band recently.

The two promo videos are great songs, but really lame concept videos, with a sort of Blair Witch feel to them.  Some concert footage may have served the boys better.  Sadly, I'm sure it's not DA's fault but in this current music climate, I'm sure there's not much budget allotted.

If DA is in your area, go see 'em- they put on awesome live show!",1259539200,5,1141,4.390476190476191

8360953,5,B002BAW66S,Two nice long concerts. No goofy camera effects just good filming and serious jamming. If you are a Death Angel fan then you need this DVD! I've been a fan since the first album and this is a treat. These guys put everything into it. Great DVD!,1249862400,6,244,4.212765957446808
