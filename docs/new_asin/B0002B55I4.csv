2074105,5,B0002B55I4,"Gundam Seed is possibly the best Anime I have ever seen. The entire volume lasts for only 50 episodes, because of this the series moves pretty fast. The series, like all other Gundam series, show two diff. people with diff. values fighting. The real origin of the war is never revealed, or who started it. It show a young man, Kira Yamato, being forced to fight for the Earth forces in order to protect his friends. But he is a coordinator (the Earth forces enemy). Coordinators are genetically engineered people with inhanced mental and phtsical abbilities. As fate would have it, wiht him allying with the Earth forces, he is forced to fight about his childhood friend, who is with the Coordinators forces, Z.A.F.T. Because of this Kira is torn between being a traitor to his own, and being viewed as an enemy by those he is allied with. Note, the English voice astors really suck, they take away from the intensisty of the show. Stick to watching it in Japanese and reading suptitles.",1091577600,,987,4.67816091954023

The Chinese and Japanese version really expressed the feelings, emotions... of the characters. They put in tremendous effort... developing the theme, songs, symphony... Try the Japanese and Chinese. You will definitely understand better and appreciate better. But of course you need to understand the languages first.",1090627200,3,440,5.391304347826087
2074107,5,B0002B55I4,"Simply put, this is among the best anime series you are likely to ever see - I really cannot conceive of any anime fan not enjoying this series. As long as you like far-future sci-fi anime, you really can't go wrong with Gundam Seed. Why? Here's just a few of the reasons this is such a stunning series:
- Characters: The characters are likable; all of the primary characters have believable, fairly deep personalities, and even many of the secondary characters have received a fair amount of attention. No cookie-cutter characters or two-dimensional personalities here.
- Story: Admittedly, it's a lot like previous Gundam series in a lot of respects, but it's been done much better this time around than any previous Gundam series. You could perhaps say ""same general concept, utterly superior execution."" In addition to being interesting, multi-layered and complex, the pacing is excellent, being fast and action-packed enough to keep anyone's interest, but never overloading you with pointless action scenes and thus making it seem shallow.
- Visuals: The artwork and animation are incredible by absolutely any standard, spiced up with plenty of nice CG effects, and terrific character and mecha designs. Gundam Seed redefines the term ""eye candy.""
- Action scenes: If you enjoy a good space battle, you'll be hard pressed to find better intense mecha action than in Gundam Seed. Fast-paced, flashy, glitzy, smooth - all of these adjectives do a good job describing the action in this series. Each type of mobile suit or other combat weapon has distinctive attributes that come into play making the fights even more interesting.
- Audio: Not having seen the series airing on Cartoon Network (unfortunately), I couldn't comment on the quality of the English dub, but I have heard more positive remarks than negative regarding it from other people. The original Japanese voices are of course flawless (when are they not?), and the sound effects are all appropriate. The music really stands out; Gundam Seed has probably the best soundtrack I've heard of -any- anime, and I'm even including such terrific soundtracks as X in that assessment.
I could go on, but I think that covers the most important points. In a few words, as long as you enjoy sci-fi anime, I really could not conceive of someone not enjoying this series immensely. My personal favorite all time and highly recommended to all anime fans.",1089504000,8,2406,5.032581453634085
2074108,5,B0002B55I4,"I have seen the entire series around the time it originally came out in Japan and it is one of the most enthralling anime adventures I have watched.  At first I thought it was nothing more than the usual Gundam fare but as the episodes progressed the story became so deep, the characters were developed with a sense of reality, and the action made sense and not just combat for the sake of combat.  After the last episode I was anxious for this series to be released on dvd.  Finally I read that it began airing on Cartoon Network (which I've never seen so I can't comment on the English dubbing) as well as this upcoming dvd release.  It's drama and action at it's best.  I highly recommend this to any anime fan or as an awesome series to start getting into the genre.
This is the first series I recommend to others when discussing anime.  Pick up this dvd and then stick with the series.  In the end you won't be sorry.",1089072000,2,922,4.294797687861272
2074109,5,B0002B55I4,"I have seen most of the Gundam series form the original up to SEED. As with all Gundam series, the story starts out as average at best but it quickly turns into what I have heard ""one of the best anime series of all time"". As with most non-Universal Century Gundam series, the primary focus of SEED is bringing peace to the universe. However, in this series several of the growing concerns that we have now are brought to the forefront. With the primary conflicts for the series being the war between naturals and coordinators (genetically engineered humans), as well as the use of weapons of mass destruction, SEED is indeed the Gundam series for the new millennium.
Gundam SEED is extremely well animated with a visual style slightly different from any other Gundam series that I have ever seen. For many of the space and ship sequences computer generated animation is used instead of typical drawn animation. This style is new and takes a few episodes to get used to. I get the feeling that this was an experimental idea that is still being worked out. I would expect that CG animation will be used more often in Gundam series and indeed in Gundam SEED 2 which should be released in Japan later on this year.",1089072000,2,1211,4.585253456221198
2074110,5,B0002B55I4,"The Gundam franchise is something of a rarity.  It's longlevity (25 years) ranks it with the other great science fiction and fantasy franchises of the world such as Star Trek, Star Wars, and Doctor Who.  In fact, with it's legions of geeky otaku fans, tons of scale models, technical guides, and other tie-ins and merchandise, Gundam is aptly referred to as ""Japan's answer to Star Trek"".
Gundam Seed began airing in Japan in the fall of 2003, the latest entry in a franchise with 15 tv series and movies and it was billed as a Gundam series for the new century.  Following a plot whose first half is similar in many ways to the original 1979 TV series, Seed did exactly as it set out to do, remake the Gundam mythos for the 21st century.
Old issues and conflicts were now discussed with a distinctly modern flavor.  This is seen most prominently in one of the two main themes of the series.  Mirroring the rapid advances in biotechnology, genetics, and cloning in the real world as well as the underlying ethical and moral concerns of such technology, the original series' abstract and vague conflict of newtypes and oldtypes was now recast as a civil war between genetically engineered space colonists and their natural born, earth bound cousins.
While Gundam Seed was modernizing the Gundam saga thematically, it brought the franchise into the twenty first century in another way; by attracting a new generation of fans, many of them female, to the series and the franchise.  The series' popularity has even led to many recent rumours of a sequel, something of a first for an ""alternate universe"" Gundam story.
While the plot of Gundam Seed is very similar to that of the original series, especially in the first half of the series, the new themes, and the eventual resolution remains creative and fresh.  Gundam Seed's main protagonists Kira Yamato and Athrun Zala are also sketched out and portrayed very well, making the two of them some of the most sympathetic opponents in Gundam since the days of Amuro's rivalry with Char in Char's Counterattack.  A minor quible I have is that perhaps Kira and Athrun's characters have been fleshed out at the expense of many of the other secondary characters who remain mostly in the background after the first couple of episodes.
This box set comes with the first five episodes of the series that takes us directly into the center of the action, and it is indeed action packed.  They mostly deal with Kira's escape from the Heliopolis colony and his first battles.  Aside from the short monologue at the beginning of each episode, very little of the background of the war has been explained to us.  This is okay, as the history is slowly revealed to us as the series progresses.  Overall, these first five episodes provides a strong beginning for the series.  I highly recommend this series to fans of the Gundam franchise, of the mecha genre in general, and to military sci-fi fans",1088899200,19,2928,4.762845849802371

I have seen the other Gundam series since the original.  They are borring.  The White Base looks like a retarted floating box, and 008, and 0083 move too slow.
Gundam Seed has redeemed the series in general.  Adding the design elements from GW, the tactis from 8th MS, and the old school story line from the original series, Seed dominate it all!

2074134,5,B0002B55I4,"Ok, well..... I watched one of the Gundam series when i was seven. i saw those twice and i honestly thought it was the dumbest series I've ever seen and their machines were extremely ugly.

Then a few weeks ago, when i was realy bored i switched on the semi-kid chanel on my tv and stumbled upon Gundam Seed. The first few episodes I was really confused and had no idea what was happenning so i went back to my memories of a very dumb anime with ugly mechanics and decided not to watch it. However, it kept on popping up on the tv and i thought the animation was pretty good and well drawn (i'm an animation freak (have been one since i was 5)) so i decided to give it a go. Well, maybe it wasn't the best choice on my behalf, but..... i grew addicted to it. Every evening i'd sit down and watch it, or find some way of recording it. I honestly think it is one of the most deep and meaningful shows on the dumb tv these days. I don't watch it for the mechanics. I'm still trying to override the first impressions syndrome on them. I particularly enjoyed phase 14 (not on this dvd) when it all focuses on Le Creuset and his philosophy. Because i found them really deep and meaningful. Yeah, I know, it sounds like the only words i use are ""deep and meaningful"", but i really can't find any other words to describe about how i feel about Gundam Seed. I quite enjoy it because its honestly the first anime show i've ever seen that doesn't have the set in stone good and bad guys. In Gundam Seed it tends to all be gray. They're evil if you look at it one way, yet in another way, they're fighting for their own idea of justice. Also, they have a lot of very well developed characters that are constant throughout the series, so they don't pitch a one-time character at you. Ok, well, occasionally other people pop out here and there, but you don't even get to know their names.

This probably isn't the best show for watching mechanics. It's more emotional and meaningfull than that. I tend to think of it as more of a show for teenagers and young adults. Kids generally don't er.....understand it. And plus, there's got to be a reason why it's rated 14+. xD. i don't care if it's a remake of something. I love the characters, love the plot, and overall i think the animation is pretty good. I'd say, it's definitely something to watch, but.... only if you like dramatic sci-fi (not the corny hollywood playa stuff)",1122681600,3,2412,4.298901098901099
2074135,4,B0002B55I4,"Mobile Suit Gundam SEED is currently one of the most popular anime series both in Japan and around the world, with the sequal - Gundam SEED Destiny currently airing in Japan. However, the series has recieved mixed critical reviews, and I hope to reconcile them, and give you a clear picture of the quality of the show.
Firstly, I do recommend this show highly to young otakus, who as a rule have enjoyed fairly mainstream anime. SEED has a good, straitforward story which serves as a good introduction into the Gundam franchise. Animation quality and detail may be lacking, but it makes up for it with a very modern, flashy and contemporay style that many find appealing. It also boasts a if not wonderful, quite enjoyable musical score. Plenty of action, a little bit character development, and just enough plot. Gundam SEED will keep you interested, while not gaining any great depth. All in all it is enjoyable, but not intellectually stimulating.
The lack of depth has brought much criticism down on Gundam SEED, especially when compared to older Gundam works. Like many of the AUs, it has trouble measuring up against the UC universe, and sufferes from some of the same problems G Gundam, Gundam W, and Gundam X had in this regard. I still suggest this series even to a hardcore mecha fan, if they are looking for something enjoyable, but unchallenging. If you have not seen the rest of the Gundam franchise, or some of the other classic mecha shows, you may want to first spend your money elsewhere, then take a look at this series later.
As a last note of advice, try to avoid the words of both fanatic SEED fanboys/girls and diehard UC elitists when judging a series; they both look at the series in a slanted, heavily biased way. I",1120953600,3,1740,4.671009771986971

2074137,5,B0002B55I4,"This is a fine series that comes on Toonami, what's even better is this is the uncut version. This box set has 10 dvds limited edition art box and cd.",1117929600,,150,4.033333333333333
2074138,5,B0002B55I4,"Having been a Gundam fan for a long time, and having heard good things about this series, I decided ""What the heck?"" and splurged on this stupendous complement to the genre. Any Gundam fan, whether he or she be a Universal Century hardcore fan or adore the Alternate Universe types, should check this out. Great music, deep characters, deep and complex plot, excellent fight scenes, all culminate to bring you one hell of an anime.

Like most Gundam series, the story is about war, and about Earth vs. Space. Or rather, in this case, Naturals vs. Coordinators. Since the basic storyline has been explained, I won't go into too many details on it, but needless to say it takes some interesting turns towards the end.

What first struck me about this series was the music. Whether it was the catchy J-pop opening and closings (like Invoke, Believe, Realize, Moment, and the first ending) and some excellent and beautiful background music (like Akatsuki no Kuruma). Unfortunately, the CD that came with this box left out some of the better ones. This is forgiveable, since you can always find them if you know where to look. The music is just so appropriate and moving, and makes the story work.

This series is by far the best when it comes to presenting reasons NOT to fight a war. The tragedies of when characters die, the ever-escalating conflict brought on by terrorist organizations such as Blue Cosmos, the need to fight for what you want to protect, all culminate to make the story far more moving and deep than any of the other Gundam series. Both sides have a reason to fight, yet both realize that the end result might mean the elimination of each other (see the last DVD).

I've heard many complaints about the art style and character design, but I find it enjoyable. The gundam designs are exquisite (gotta love that Freedom Gundam). The fight scenes are executed in such a way as to make them unpredictable, and therefore quite enjoyable.

The ending, as others have described, is very open ended, and leads very well into the upcoming Destiny sequel series. Though I haven't seen it yet (I don't steal fansubs) I look forward to the continuation of the ever increasing struggle to end the war that could wipe out humanity in its entirety.

Content wise, this show is not for children. People die (sometimes quite graphically), foul language is used, some adult themes are present, and the overall theme is one of sadness and despair, balanced by the hope of a new beginning.

Bandai did a fairly decent job dubbing this series, though sometimes intentionally having the actors speeding up their voices to match the lips. Its good in both languages, though emotions are expressed better in the original Japanese.

This box set is a great way to start this series, though I warn you that after the first DVD, you'll want to see more. Its a nice sturdy box with some cool artwork on the sides, and conveniently seperates all 10 volumes from the rest of your collection. I give this product (and this series) 5 stars because it is so entertaining, more so than I've seen in the past few years of anime releases.",1117324800,20,3119,4.6996336996337
2074139,5,B0002B55I4,"Anyone who says Gundam Wing is better than Gundam Seed, must either be a clueless anime fan or a 14 yr old girl (because that's what Gundam Wing was catering too).

2074140,4,B0002B55I4,"I remember watching Mobile Suit Gundam 0079 or to you other people as ""The Original Gundam"". Then I watched 0083:Stardust Memory, 0080:War in the Pocket, and 8th Mobile Suit team and parts of F91.

Then came along this bishonen stuff known as Gundam Wing. Teens with power and anti-social behavior. Not one mentally unstable kid/teen with a Gundam as usual, but multiplied times 5!

Gundam Seed, I've only seen volume 1, but

Earth is Earth as usual

ZAFT=Zeon

Coordinator=Newtype

Kira=Amuro Rey

throw in a crew of cadets/conscripted children, and you got drama!

Well, it is a good looking series, its like a car, the newest model. Looking at all the other Gundam series whether A.C.,U.C.,etc. this works because it takes from the past mistakes and influences, and has presented it very well. Gundam has always been there to tell the drama/tale of youth in war, but after seeing so much, Gundam is just too damn melodramatic for me (directing to see the emotional states of people). I only watched for the mecha, but Mobile Suit based weapons are just cumbersome large targets.

The future of weaponry is more compact, not overtly and intimidatingly large. If you're looking for the usual Gundam, this is a great choice to introduce others to; please remember that its been done before and it celebrates Gundam's 25th Anniversary (2005) I believe as another reincarnation and the milking of this series' name.

The series has good depth, an excellent storyline, and awesome music. Gundam Seed has its own unique touch and true texture. Gundam Seed is a feast for the soul.

2074142,4,B0002B55I4,"Gundam Seed is much better than Gundam W or G Gundam. Why? Well, I'll get to that.  Let's start with the music first.  The Gundam W music I think was fairly good, but I don't really remember it.  The G Gundam music was catchy, but at least for Cartoon Network, they played essentially the same song. And it seemed a bit of an odd to play for a show about Mobile Suits, something about a Spell. Gundam Seed on the other hand, has clear opening and ending, and since the show is sort of shoujo the ending works, and the opening is upbeat enough for a show about Mobile Suits.  Then the general drawing, the art in G Gundam is just weird, it looks typical of 70s anime, with women having weird sideburn-like bangs.  Speaking of which, neither G Gundam nor Gundam W have enough women for a ""boys show"" and because of this, I'm inclined to think the target audience is really young girls with a mobile suit fetish. I think Gundam W is the worst in this respect, having very pretty guys like Hiro Yui, but only one real girl of mention (there were others, but as I remember, most of them got killed off or something).  Then there is the plot. Gundam W has a plot quite similar to Gundam Seed, but instead of emphasizing the human element, they choose to spend a great portion of their time talking about unmanned Mobile Dolls.  Yawn... Then there is G Gundam, which has this concept of the Dark Gundam, and is organized around a tournament atmosphere. Which brings me to the next part, sequence. Neither G Gundam nor Gundam W have a very clear sequence, unless you pay close attention to either the episode numbers. Did they start with the tournament and there was a rise of the Dark Gundam, or did they start under the thumb of the Dark Gundam and after defeating it have a tournament only to have it return? If you miss episodes from either one, it is difficult to pick up from the middle and make sense of.  Gundam Seed however, with similar plot focuses on similar elements of the Gundam W plot while eschewing the foolishness of Gundam W with its allegorical names (I think there was one that meant the peaceful empire, and the evil part is played by the Romefeller Foundation which is an alteration of something like Rockefeller), and the weird cards imprinted on the hand, along with magical powers of G Gundam. It sticks to the tried and true plot, and then adds much more romantic elements to the mix.

I do have one gripe though, which is why only 3-4 stars. The box is almost twice the price of the normal box single, just for including artwork. Normally the box is +$10 while this has +$18 to the price.  Also, they really should make a complete series set, as it dissuades people from buying when even at Used & New, they end up spending several hundred getting all the series.",1113609600,2,2784,4.419921875

2074160,2,B0002B55I4,"Currently Airing on TV, Gundam Seed is set in an alternate Universe but is too closely related to the other Gundam Series to be called original. That said, Gundam Seed is set in a timeline called the cosmic era.

The plotline is basic and sort of generic. A young Coordinator named Kira lives a sheltered life up in a space colony while a war is going on. But he and his friends are suddenly thrown into the war when an orignation known as ZAFT (Zeion) attacks their home to gain five prototype mobile suits (Taken from the first Gundam series).

Kira is suddenly thrown in the cokpit of a prototype mobile suit called ""Strike"" (Gundam 008: War in the pocket) and gets caught in the war between naturals and Coordnators (Earth federation vs. Zeion). Kira, like all naturals is gifted with abnormal abilities far beyond that of any average human and is able to bring out the full capastes of this prototype Gundam (His character [strength swise] borderlines too closely to Heero Yuy of Gundam Wing). However he finds himself at odds as to who to take sides with while aboard the ship the archangel.

The show is okay in someplaces but the series plays out like a teenagers soap-opera, the animation borderlines between poor and mostly CGI generated images, which makes me wonder what sort of attention to did they pay to the show's art at all. The animations for the characters are a bit stiff and cartoonish and the art is not imprssive.

Much like in 'Gundam Wing' the artists took the road of the so called 'pretty-boy' design probably to gain more female audiences, however it looks far too childish and there's not enough attention on the facial expressions or body proportions to even call it pretty. They even have a character who resembles Zechs Merquise and Char; blonde hair, a fancy military suit, and a white mask. Rau Le Creuset, however lacks depth and character compaired to those two. Espiecally compaired to Zechs Merquise.

The US voice acting caters the cartoonish look by giving you cartoonish voices, the Japanese Dub (no matter how well done it is) does nothing to redeem this show and the Gundams hauntingly resmble that of the first mobiles suits in the Gundam Series ""Mobile suit Gundam.""

The music can be repetive at times your most likely to hear the same tunes play over and over when they shift to ZAFT from the earth forces. All in all Gundam Seed isn't strong enough to keep your attention for very long, it barely focuses on the plot and the story feels disjointed in many places.

If your fan of the older Gundam series and don't mind the painstakingly obvious reacurring themes and more of a focus on the characters and their relationships instead of the so-called plot then this show's for you. If not your better off sticking to ""Gundam: 08TH MS Team"" and ""Mobile Suit: Gundam Wing"".",1104537600,4,2819,4.682828282828283

2074163,3,B0002B55I4,"After a year of prodding I finally gave in to pressure and sat through Gundam SEED.  The writers of the most recent ""Alternate Universe"" in the Gundam franchise had a difficult task ahead of them: to write a new series that could stand on its own outside of the Universal Century saga (the ""main"" Gundam storyline) while still incorporating the human drama that made the UC series great.  SEED meets with mixed results.

The storyline is standard Gundam fare: violent conflict has arisen between the Coordinators, genetically modified humans with superior strength and abilities, and their unmodified forebears, the Naturals.  This boils down to the classic ""earth vs. space"" motif, with the Coordinators' nation, ZAFT, living in spaceborne colonies and making strikes against the Earth Alliance.

Sound familiar?  Well... it is.  Gundam SEED feels like it was written by two different people, with control of the series changing hands about halfway through.  During the first half of the series the crew of the Archangel goes through an almost blow-by-blow retelling of the story of the original Gundam, but with ZAFT instead of Zeon and Kira Yamato instead of Amuro Ray.  That could be overlooked, but there's another, larger, problem: The first half of SEED is painfully slow, largely the fault of horrible writing.  Director Fukuda must love the use of flashbacks, because there's a number of them in most episodes.  These aren't just a couple of lines, though: some of them go on for entire minutes.  To make matters worse, many of them are repeated multiple times in individual episodes, giving the series a very heavyhanded feel.  We GOT it, already. Move on and show us something NEW.  A character's death is supposed to have emotional meaning - but when the entire scene is replayed multiple times in the following episode, it's all lost.  Either the writers thought we wouldn't notice that they're just spitting out flashbacks instead of moving the story forward, or they thought that our memories are so bad that we need to be constantly reminded of events that happened in the previous episode.  Neither assumption is true.  What we're left with instead is a story that moves at a glacial pace, containing entire episodes in which almost nothing new is said.

The series finally hits its stride about halfway through (starting with episode 28 - 26 and 27 are almost entirely flashbacks); the flashbacks are toned down considerably, and the series starts moving forward as the hostilities between ZAFT and the EA escalate out of control.  Unfortunately, the second half suffers due to having wasted the first; rather than feeling slow, the second half feels like it has to rush ahead far too quickly to compensate.  Characters make a big deal out of unexpected revelations that we know were intended to be important, but that don't really affect the story at all as it's written.  Characters undergo dramatic shifts in personality or maturity with little warning - but the actual development of said characters falls by the wayside.  Major characters are killed for no reason beyond the fact that the script called for their death.

The development of the Archangel's crew is largely weak and disorganized.  Kira is the standard whiny pilot that Gundam fans have come to expect.  Mu is the voice of experience.  Murrue is the captain who's too nice to command effectively (and who never does anything unless Mu suggests it first...)  Natarle is the rigid military type.  Miriallia is the nice, ""normal"" technician character.  Fllay is cast as a manipulative villain in the first half, then vanishes without trace for much of the second.  Cagalli, seemingly strong and capable at first, frustrated me by spending most of the remaining series yelling and crying.  Of the characters, only Mu, Natarle, and Miriallia come across as being done particularly well.

That's not to say it's all bad.  The ZAFT cast is executed far more effectively - particularly Athrun and Dearka, who are two of the only characters in the series who don't feel contrived in any way.  The internal turmoil in Athrun's mind as agonizes over his battles with Kira is very well done.  Rau le Creuset, the resident masked ace, manages NOT to be just another Char Aznable clone (a la Gundam Wing's Zechs) and is an effective villain, although he is also rushed.

The animation is fluid and the art is attractively rendered (and the disco guns are gone, Cartoon Network viewers).  Although I don't much like CG animation in anime, here it's pulled off well enough that I never really noticed.  The frequent fight scenes, unlike the story, are fast-paced and well choreographed.  The only downturn is the appearance of the overpowered Freedom and Justice Gundams, which turn most battles into Gundam Wing-style ""fire big guns and destroy an entire army in one shot!"" affairs.

So.  Is SEED better than the UC series?  By and large, no.  Is it better than Gundam Wing?  Definitely.  I did enjoy watching the series - but it could've been incredible, on par with the best of UC, if only the writing was better.  As it is, if I decide to buy the series I'll hold out for the box set instead of picking up individual DVDs.  Hopefully the sequel, SEED Destiny, will learn from the mistakes of its predecessor.",1102204800,2,5283,4.92420814479638

2074165,5,B0002B55I4,"In the tradition of previous ""Alternate Universe"" Gundam sagas like Gundam Wing, Gundam SEED has takes place in its own world, connected only thematically to the many other series. Fans of the original Gundam will no doubt experience some deja vu as a silver-masked man leads a raid on a colony where Earth's prototype mobile suits are being built, and most of the crew of a distinctive white battleship are killed, leaving junior officers and civilians to take command. But SEED is not a mere rehash, it has its own twists on the old formula.

This time, the war is between the genetically-modified ""Coordinators"" of ZAFT and Earth Alliance, dominated by un-modified ""Naturals"". Like Zeon in the original series, ZAFT is heavily outnumbered but make up the difference with their revolutionary mobile suits, which are far superior to Earth's mobile armors (unlike the mighty behemoths of previous series, SEED's ""mobile armors"" are merely small fighter craft). In response, Earth forces secretly develop advanced mobile suits on the supposedly neutral colony Heliopolis. But ZAFT discovers their effort, and masked ace Rau Le Creuset leads his team on a bold mission to steal the Gundams. While attempting to escape the attack, young student Kira Yamato (a Coordinator who's not part of ZAFT) and the mysterious Cagalli stumble into the mobile suit hanger. Kira unwittingly finds himself in the cockpit of the Strike Gundam, and discovers that the ZAFT pilot who stole one of the others, the Aegis Gundam, is his childhood friend Athrun Zala. Meanwhile, Rau is attacked by mobile armor ace Mwu La Flaga, who he has apparently fought many times before. And soon, the battle between Kira and the ZAFT forces results in the complete destruction of Heliopolis. Kira and his friends join with Mwu and the few remaining crew members of the battleship Archangel, attempting to evade Rau's fleet and escape to Earth.",1100044800,,1908,5.076433121019108

2074169,3,B0002B55I4,"The collector's box is nice and sturdy, able to contain all 10 DVDs that will make up the series. The front has a shot of our two main characters, Athrun and Kira, along with the Aile Strike Gundam. The sides show each of them with the respective standard mid-series upgrade Gundam. The top has a small group shot.

The soundtrack is from Tofu Records, one of the many labels cashing in on the success of anime and manga by releasing soundtracks. The CD is titled SEED Complete Best and is a compilation of the openings and endings for the series, along with some remixes. SEED has some great songs so there should be just about something for everyone here (truth be told, there are a few which have me reaching for the ""Next Track"" button). Sadly, one key song is missing. In Japan, there were two versions of Complete Best- a standard and a limited edition. The limited edition contained one extra song, the first ending. This is undoubtedly the most popular song from the series, but the group behind it (See-Saw) are signed to a different record label. It's not the greatest loss but without it, Complete Best doesn't feel so complete. The CD is in a standard case, with a pull out booklet. The booklet has a new cover of a POV shot of the Strike Gundam looming over you, whilst the other side of the case has the original Japanese cover of Kira and Athrun looking grim and angsty. The booklet contains the romanised lyrics for all the songs found on the album, as well as photos of the artists...quite a freaky bunch. The last page is a track listing with a group shot of the big four characters.

Bandai are using the Japanese cover art for the series, so the cover for volume 1 is Kira and his Strike Gundam. The insert gives a brief glossary of important terms used in the story.

The DVD menus use animation from the show eg a clip will play of Strike Gundam swinging a sword and then freeze, with the options appearing on the sword. It's reminiscent of what Bandai did with Endless Waltz and slightly confusing to navigate. Hopefully it will improve with later discs. From the main menu you can choose to play all 5 episodes, select a specific part of one of the episodes, change the settings or go to the extras.

The extras are the norm for this kind of release. We get a textless opening, mecha files (compiled by two very cool members of the fandom), three trailers (Ghost in the Shell : Stand Alone Complex, Infinite Ryvius and Dragon Drive) and credits.

Sound and video here is fine. Everything looks and sounds crisp and is helped by the casts of both languages doing a pretty solid job.

Starting in late 2002 in Japan, SEED is yet another of Bandai's attempts to draw in new fans with a series unconnected to those of the franchise's past. The last series to air was 1999's Turn A Gundam. Helmed by Gundam creator Tomino, the show took a very different approach and was only really successful with long time fans. With SEED, Bandai is clearly aiming for a younger demographic (especially females, which make up most of the show's fanbase). Whilst the AU series of the mid-90s had been piled out with little space or life, SEED was the result of alot of careful planning. The original series remains ever popular in Japan, so Bandai decided to see it lightning would strike twice. SEED takes the story of Mobile Suit Gundam and rewrites it for the modern generation. Gone are the goofy 1970s music, mecha and character designs replaced by catchy J-pop tunes, attractive bishounen and mecha which draw on the franchise's 25 years of experience.

The result is a series which, in this reviewer's opinion, is Gundam Wing done right. The story sticks to the tried and true formula- in the distant future, Earth is at war with the inhabitants of its orbiting space colonies. However the conflict here is not one of rights but race. Genetic engineering, an issue which in the real world is becoming more and more a complicated issue, is a reality. Parents willingly take advantage of this to 'improve' their children as they see fit, from anything as simple to a change of eye colour to enhanced strength and intelligence. This has split humanity in two- the Coordinators (the name given to those who have been altered) and the Naturals (the name for those who have remained untampered). The two sides each have their own share of loathing for the other for varying reasons, so war has broken out. The war had been expected to end quickly but after a massive loss of their own civillains to nuclear warheads, ZAFT (the name of the Coordinator army) developed the N-Jammer to disable any sort of nuclear power.

Both sides are forced to rely on non-nuclear power as a result. Another invention of the Coordinator's high intellect are mobile suits. Combined with the super fast reflexes of their pilots, these new weapons are giving ZAFT the advantage.

Not to be outdone, the Earth forces commence plans to build their own advanced MS. The 5 prototypes are nearly complete on the 'neutral' colony where they've been constructed when ZAFT make their play to steal them. A devistating attack is launched on the colony, forcing the civillains into shelters. It's here that our central character, Kira Yamato, gets involved. A 16 year old Coordinator, Kira and his family moved to the colony to escape the war. After saving the life of an Earth officer, Kira is forced into the cockpit with her of the the last remaining prototype. When the Natural officer struggles to control the thing, Kira is forced to step in and use his abilities to pilot. As the situation worsens, it's clear Kira is the only one who can pilot this Strike Gundam, a task he is forced into to protect himself and his friends as they flee with the Earth forces. Whilst this is frustrating enough for the peace loving Kira, he also has to deal with the fact that one of the Gundam thiefs is his childhood friend Athrun Zala. Can he kill one friend to protect others?

The characters are a likeable bunch but as should be expected we don't get to know them completly in these first 5 episodes. Kira is joined by his friends/fellow students, as well as a kind hearted rookie captain, a by-the-book second officer and a cool ace pilot who serves as his mentor. ZAFT also has some diversity, with the now-standard Char-clone (a mysterious masked blonde who's a capable commander and fearsome fighter) and their own Gundam pilots who at least partly fall into bishounen stereotypes (the quiet peacemaker, the moody gloryhog, etc).

Both casts do a fine job. In general I prefer the Japanese cast, but the English cast also have talent. There is the odd moment of flatness and silly ""we need to fit the flaps"" dialogue, but it never reaches the levels that have hampered my enjoyment of the Ocean Group's previous works. The Japanese version's major ace is Seki Tomokazu. The guy who played one of my favourite characters from past series (Domon Kasshu), Seki steps up to play Yzak Joule, a dedicated ZAFT Gundam pilot. Whilst alot of VAs restrain themselves, Seki becomes his character. He does a great job of channeling Yzak's arrogance and anger, as well as providing screaming battle cries like no one can

The animation is of a fine standard, but there is one annoying flaw- a high use of CGI. Computer screens are rendered this way and so ocassionly is the main ship of the show, the Archangel. Whilst it can work in small doses at times it just sticks out too much, especially for the ship animation. Archangel moves within the same physics as everything else, then becomes incredibly floaty and moveable once it switches to CGI (thankfully, this flaw seems to have been corrected for the sequel).

In general, I'd say this is the best series for someone who wants to give Gundam a shot to hop on with. It can appeal to both existing fans and new ones, especially females who may not be interested in the style of previous series. The show has some bishounen but doesn't over do it (in fact, the first episode has a scene that slightly parodies those kind of shows), instead trying to give us characters with...well, character. The mecha designs are appealing, the battles are well handled and the story is intriguing, offering the possibility of further discussion on the real world of the heart of the war (the morals of genetic engineering).

2074170,4,B0002B55I4,"I'll admit right off the bat that while I've been aware of the Gundum phenom this is the first Gundum anime I've ever seen. Unfortunately, I tried reading the Del Rey manga adaptation which came out some months before the anime and was completely lost. You couldn't tell who was who and even the difference between the boys and the girls. So I didn't have a good attitude coming into the viewing of this anime. After initial trepidation, I completely enjoyed Volume 1 of Gundum Seed.

In the future humanity has split into two factions. The first are the genetically modified Coordinators, who are superior to humans in every way. The majority of humans have not had these modifications and proudly call themselves the ""Naturals"" as though the Coordinators are some freakish abominations. A war starts (the anime isn't clear who starts it) due to the misunderstandings and suspicions between the two factions. Both sides field military armies, with the Earth Alliance representing the Naturals and ZAFT representing the space colonies of the Coordinators.

Not everybody has taken a side in the war. The nation of Aube and its research satellite colony named Heliopolis have declared neutrality in the hostilities. Known or unknown to the inhabitants, the Earth Alliance has been manufacturing 5 Mobile Suit G-weapons, humanoid-looking mecha piloted by humans, which are far in advance of even ZAFT's superior technology. Thus, Heliopolis is a target for a ZAFT raid to capture the new secret weapons.

Caught in the middle of this are two friends on opposite sides who are both opposed to the war in spirit, if not in reality. Kira Yamato, a young college student, finds himself as the reluctant pilot of one of the G-weapons as all its trained pilots are killed. He chooses not to fight for the Earth Alliance, but to guard the lives of his friends, and of his home. On the Coordinator side, his good friend from times past, Athrun, is one of the team sent in to hijack the new Gundum suits. You'll have to get the dvd to find out what happens when the two meet up again. They'll have to make some tough choices.

I was initially put off by the character designs in this anime. They just seemed a tad too Final Fantasy effeminate to me, what with all the wind through the hair blowing shots. Also, the animation itself seemed a little stiff and did not flow very smoothly. But I guess my eye adjusted to it because I didn't notice it after a while. The show doesn't really start until the first battle and then you start to see the brutality of war. This is not a touchy feely anime. Hundreds of people are killed in explosions as the Gundum have their own battles. The action sequences are very hard-hitting, not because they are graphic (you hardly see any blood), but there's all these massive explosions where a second before people were standing horrified and not knowing what to do. The Coordinators seem especially unconcerned about the death of civilians but there are allusions to an Earth Alliance atrocity known as ""The Bloody Valentine"" which seem to give them justification. I really enjoyed the characters once I got used to them. I was kinda put off by all the ponderous history of Gundum but I enjoyed this volume and will probably seek out the other countless series and manga.",1094428800,,3296,4.756993006993007
2074171,5,B0002B55I4,"Mobile Suit Gundam Seed is not just any anime. People should not really compare it to other Gundam animes, but compare it to other titles. Gundam Seed is not about its battle scenes like Gundam Wing and Gundam G emphasizes, but it is about the drama, hardships, and tragedy brought by war.
  The story is mainly about two friends parted from each other just to end up fighting each other in a seemly meaningless war, although most of wars are meaningless. War is such a terrible thing, that is if you were in the shoes of Kira Yamato, the main character in the series, but to us it is just another war story, this time in color.
 My summary on this is, yes, Gundam Seed is worth keeping. You might find most of the episodes quite short, this is perhaps to keep the series long. If you like sci-fi animes, you will probably like this series. It has a lot to offer, mentioning twisty storylines and excellent battle sequence.

My boyfriend has seen the fansubbed series at least 4 times, with episode 40 being our favorite, that of course has been seen more times than 4.

I love everything about the series...how it captures the audience, the characters.  The setting seems almost the same as the other Gundam series, but it's a little different.  The music is great as well! Too bad this box only comes with one of the many CDs...

I had high expectations for it due to my previous viewings of Gundam stories like War in the Pocket, Stardust Memories, 8th MS Team and of course the original movies introducing Amuro Rey and Cassoval Daikun (a.k.a. Char Aznable).  I know that within the anime world, storylines can be re-done repeatedly.  Some Japanese directors seem to have a penchant for refinement.  Gundam Seed, I think, does loosely classify as a re-make of the original series..but, man, what a re-make!  The story is ALWAYS the biggest lure for me along with serious character development.  Gundam Seed has both.  Add to that combination the highly refined mobile suits with Phase Shift armor and you have a dynamic new twist for the technology element of the war.  Besides all of that, when you step away from the screen, Gundam Seed really is animation for the thinking viewer.  Hey, say what you want, but genetic manipulation is much closer than we think!  Some of the huge social implications of that 'biological' technology could very well occur in a similar fashion.  If you've never given anime its due, take a chance with this one.

2074177,4,B0002B55I4,"First of all, most of the Gundam series (being Universal Century or the Alternate Continuity[Gundam Wing, Gundam Seed, Upturn A, and the lame Gundam G Fighter]), follows most of the same plot with some of the characters being almost the same as Amuro and Char. The stories are entertaining and at sometimes addicting.

 This series fits all of the expectations of a Gundam series. The characters are slow to be developed in the begining but once the 'fillers' are over with... the story and action is delivered at almost a fevered pace. It also includes the traditional moral/ethical dilema that the pilots go through in almost every series. Animation is great, the designs of the mobile suits are great (man, I wish I could design my own for a cartoon series), and the plot was very entertaining.

 I do agree that the english dubbing takes away some of the story. Watch it in Japanese with english subtitles. You will better enjoy the story of the whole series.

 Now in one of the reviews, they mention that they don't explain how the war started? The person that did the review is completely wrong. If I am not mistaken, on episode 13 or 14, they explain about the genetic manipulation that was done on a person that became a world ""progeny"". When the person left to space, he left a manuscript that explained how it was done and people began to ""genengineer"" their babies. Many of the ""naturals"" didn't like this and began the traditional racisim situation that occurs from people not accepting other people that are different. This escalated until the ""Bloody Valentine Incident"" that then continued to be played out as the war that has engulfed the ""neutral"" colony where the Gundams were stolen from and involving Keera and his friends.

 I still like the series and if you are a Gundam Fan, then watch and enjoy. I just hope they can complete the Universal Centuries with the missing series that haven't been translated yet (Gundam Z, ZZ, Victory, and F91). This will fill in the blanks to many questions left by the gap between Stardust Memories and Char's Counter Attack.",1091664000,5,2082,4.747922437673131

8025449,3,B0002B55I4,"Gundam SEED is the original Mobile Suit Gundam 0079 redone for a new generation.  This first volume starts off in much the same way as the original, with a peaceful colony housing a top secret prototype robot named Gundam being attacked.  A young boy named Kira finds himself in the Gundam and ends up fighting out of necessity and not choice and over time becomes an ace and person who grows up through war.

This series has a twist where instead of a war for independence between the Earth Federation and the Zeon, it is a war of revenge between Z.A.F.T. (Coordinators: humans genetically engineered at birth to unlock more of their potential)and the Earth Federation (Naturals: ordinary people who have not been genetically enhanced).  In Vol. 1 Kira and his friends are living in a neutral colony when Z.A.F.T. attacks looking to capture the 5 Gundam units and destroy the new Federation battleship, Archangel.  Things don't go as planned with Kira ending up in one of the Gundams and his childhood best friend appearing as one of the ace Z.A.F.T. pilots trying to steal them.  Eventually, him and his friends end up on the Archangel with one of the Gundams and what is left of the Federation crew and staff after a catastrophic Pearl Harbor like attack.  The Archangel attempts to escape from the enemy in a pretty decent fight between 3 ships and all 5 of the Gundams.

8025451,5,B0002B55I4,"When I first saw this volume of the show, I was lost for words. There is almost nothing that I can criticize about it.

On a scale of 1 to 10:

Animation: 10. The animation is almost flawless. The only downside is that because of the character detail, the farther away they get, the worse they look. Sometimes you also can tell when a different studio is doing the animation, but otherwise it's perfect. The CG animation of the battleship Archangel gives the ship such a breathtaking look that it's knocked the USS Enterprise to second place on my list of favorite spaceships!

Music: 10. The music in the show repeats certain themes, but the themes in themselves are so good that it doesn't matter if they're repeated or not. The opening song, Invoke, is an amazing dance theme that makes you want to dance without sounding too false or dumb. And the ending song, Anna ni issho datta no ni (We used to be so close to each other), is a ballad that's not too sappy or slow. Both the songs have a great melody and beautiful lyrics.

Story: 10. I am one of few people who haven't seen the original Mobile Suit Gundam, so I can't say that GS is a rehash of it. The story is realistic; in other words it makes you believe that the events in GS could actually happen someday. The characters are very believable, also.

Voice Acting: 9.5. The only reason this doesn't get a 10 is due to two very annoying English voice actors. The top two voice actors are: 2. Trevor Deval as Mu La Flaga, and 1. Mark Oliver as Rau Le Creuset. Mark Oliver, especially, is a very talented voice actor and does an amazing job bringing Creuset to life.

But the bottom two voice actors are: 2. Vanessa Morley as Cagalli Yula Athha, and 1. Matt Hill as Kira Yamato. For some reason, they chose a horribly annoying voice actor to do the main character's voice of all people.

Other than that small complaint, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this series. It is, at its core, a commentary on how two groups of people who aren't that different can still find enough differences between each other to go to war. If you like TV shows, movies, and anime that make you really think, this is for you.",1175644800,,2170,4.41
8025452,5,B0002B55I4,"Personally I thought this particular anime was absolutely fantastic, the best of the Gundam series of shows if you ask me, although I can't claim to have seen all of them. But I feel there are some things you should know before buying this and those are:

a) Don't bother watching the preview at the end of the episodes, they take away from the show as a whole.

b) always watch the retrospective at the beginning, at least enough to tell if it's just a ""this happened last time, let's go!"" or if it's actually part of the new episode.

c) don't start watching if you have something important to do very soon. They do an excellent job of making the end of each episode make you want, nay, need to watch the next one. Not that this is a bad thing, just something to be aware of...

d) Somewhat related, I seem to lose track of time while watching, I tend to get the ""one more episode"" syndrome (kind of like ""one more turn"" syndrome if you've ever played Civilization). I've gone through the series twice in full and several times starting somewhere in the middle and every time I find myself sitting down saying ""Oh, I'll just watch a few episodes..."" However, two discs later, ""Oh, darn, I spent HOW LONG watching?!""

So I would highly recomend you pick up Gundam SEED but just remember, if you pick this one up, you WILL end up with the entire series. However, you will end up with one of the best animes I have ever run into.",1160179200,,1428,4.333333333333333
8025453,4,B0002B55I4,"Mobile Suite Gundam Seed is the newest release in America, I have seen and own the entire anime. First things first the good; it has a pretty good soundtrack, it has crisp and clear animation, and  the mecha are  just plain awesome. Now the bad; most of the characters are really annoying because they won't shut up about not wanting to fight, yet they self detonate there Gundams in order to kill each other. And the ending Is probably the worst anime ending in history ( next to gundam seed destiny's). I recommend that you don't by the series, get the movies to hold you off until Gundam Seed Destiny comes to the US. But if you really want to by this you not going to regret it, you'll just get board after you see this series twice( trust me I've done it!) .",1132876800,,763,4.291666666666667
