7921510,5,B00004RU25,"After his sucess on the comedy stage, Andrew ""Dice"" clay decided to bridge his way to the big screen. His first movie, ""the adventures of ford fairlane""  has a decent following and a great soundtrack.  So how do you follow this up, simple, Brain Smasher's...a love story. Honestly, this movie is so bad its good.  Chinese Red Lotus monks chaising a supermodel, wow. To top that, A boncer that goes by the name Brain Smasher.  This is something you just have to watch, hard to explain, but you'll laugh at the action, as well as the jokes. And Teri Hatcher in one of her many B-films before making it on ABC's Lois & Clark Superman series, and Now desperate housewives.  I can only hope they take this to DVD like they did Ford Fairlane.  Note, one of the other reviewers is correct, the VHS quality is not great, it was recorded on EP mode, so it's not top notch, but still worth it to watch.",1160956800,2,892,4.375757575757576
