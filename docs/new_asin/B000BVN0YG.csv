8093279,4,B000BVN0YG,"These are 2 Xmas season films with Maureen O'Sullivan from TV.  The
Blessed Midnight is from the show ""Cavalcade of America"" and is complete, except for the Cavalcade opening.  The Gift is from ""Four Star Playhouse"" and possibly has a small amount of footage missing.  It also has no Four Star opening.
