This story begins with a man playing with a ball on the sidewalk. Mr. Collins kicked a cat! This is a boarding house, where people live in a room and eat watered soup. [Note their lives.] A man sees the new boarder ""Paul Collins"" coming down the stairs. One man can identify people by their footsteps. Mr. Otis was crippled in an accident. We see conflicts among people because of their behavior. A woman finds Otis stabbed to death in his room! Kay Abbot asks Haila Troy to wait before reporting this. Two men find items of their clothing missing. [Unlocked doors.] Fred Rogers arrives home after being absent for six years. A scream tells the maid found the body. The police lieutenant questions the people about their alibis. Mrs. Girard tells Professor Simons quarreled with Otis. Simons is wearing a different pair of shoes. Mr. Collins left the house.

Kay Abbot tells what Otis did to her; he took a valuable letter that she borrowed from her job. Jeff Troy and Haila visit Professor Simons and ask who could have impersonated him. Jeff Troy goes to question a man whose business card was found in Otis' room. Kay tells about her husband, who was trying to retrieve that letter. Haila screams when a strange man enters her room at night! Jeff returns and learns what happened. Otis was operating a scam to borrow money from people. They learn about Simons' past. The police learn about Girard's past. Mrs. Tory notices the Professor's rare shoes and gets away. The police know about Simons now.

This story tells about the lives of poor people who live in a boarding house and their problems. It exposes the scam of borrowing people from recent college graduates by pretending to have gone to school with them. Are there still people who request funds by claiming an affinity?",1342828800,,1819,4.678125
8290038,1,B001CUB9YI,I also ordered the DVD thinking I was getting the one starring Kirk Douglas and Henry Fonda. That's what was on the case and that's what was advertised by Amazon.com. It is not what I got at all. I got some black and white movie with the same title but starring Robert Sterling. I am in the process of returning it in hopes of getting the movie I ordered or a full refund. We'll see.,1230854400,,383,4.12
8290039,1,B001CUB9YI,"I was very disappointed in the particular DVD I receiwed. I am famular with the movie and was anticipting enjoying it but instead of Kirk Douglas and Henry Fonda, I was shown an old Studio 66 Playhouse Theater production of a mystery by the same name. It makes me very leery now of movies where there has been a remake or there is another recording with the same name.

I was not happy at all with this transaction. I will say that Newtown Video did refund my money, however it still cost me a rehandling fee.",1221696000,,509,4.302083333333333
