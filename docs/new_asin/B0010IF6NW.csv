3048983,5,B0010IF6NW,"I can't say enough good things about this incredibly moving and inspiring documentary. I have shown it to several of my community college classes, and it makes a profound impression on the students every time. It is impossible not to care about the courageous young men depicted. I also appreciate the film's honesty; not all of the young men go on to be successful in their new lives in the United States; one experiences a mental breakdown. (I wish there were details given about what happened to him after that, but I assume that in order to protect his privacy the filmmakers decided to be discreet about it.) In other words, coming to the US is not by any means shown as easy or a path to overnight success. The young men work hard--very hard--and have to overcome obstacles here like loneliness, cultural misunderstandings, etc. Still, there is a satisfying happy ending.",1431820800,,877,4.776315789473684

3049004,5,B0010IF6NW,"Very simple human movie on true character ! This is life.  This movie will make you come out of our boundaries or your own
prison. If you have not traveled counties in the world, you must watch this to understand and respect others situations.
America is great country in my feeling just because it has embarrassed so much of immigrants and modern day refugees from the world. Refugees are unwanted people for many that's why they become refugees. I am grateful for the nation of America and it's people for this act of humanity ! Your nation is blessed and much of your sins are forgiven for the act of accepting refugees in your nation! This is also Biblical blessing as you welcome stranger in your land ( surely you too have  paid a price for getting many of the enemies). I have known and lived with many refugees in America. I feel good to see them blessed. ""God grew Tired of Us"" movie is just a tiny story of how the love and acceptance of a nation can touch human spirit!",1401667200,,980,4.3791208791208796

3049006,4,B0010IF6NW,God Grew Tired of Us was just what we were looking for. My 7th grade class enjoyed the movie and it was a great asset to the book.,1399075200,,130,3.6785714285714284
3049007,4,B0010IF6NW,"This movie has all the hallmarks of a great story.  Its protagonists lose everything as children to the violent cruelty of a world they did not yet understand.  They underwent an epic journey of self discovery and survival as they trekked thousands of miles looking for a new life before ultimately winding up in America.  The characters are well developed and fully fleshed out- in particular the leader of the group who delivers the titular ""God Grew Tired of Us"" line.

However, the movie unfortunately fails to deliver its established promise.  Why are these men whiling away their time working minimum wage jobs in the northeastern United States?  Even more, why does the movie linger there for so long?  I suppose I can excuse the filmmakers because this WAS 2007, after all.  But still, why are these men not gathering resources in America, making connections, and then coming back to Sudan with millions of dollars, guns, and exacting revenge on all of their wrongdoers, preferably as they wave a tattered American flag?

This movie has all it needs except the ending: orphaned, misunderstood protagonists pursuing the American dream.  Where's the absurd amount of explosions, one-liners, scantily clad women, and overwhelming dubstep music?  I want to cram popcorn into my nervous mouth while I watch these men in mech-suits pummeling Sudanese warlords as black hawk helicopters spiral in plumes of colored smoke before crashing into skyscrapers under a rousing glitch-step rendition of jimi hendrix's version of the Star-Spangled Banner.  Is that so much to ask?

Sure, it's a good story.  I just wish it had an ending.",1397174400,,1629,5.075187969924812
3049008,5,B0010IF6NW,Bought this for the high school classroom.  Students should watch this to get an idea of the struggles so many people go through and the strength the find within to survive.  Great movie.,1396828800,,187,4.636363636363637

3049010,5,B0010IF6NW,"This was one of the most ""moving"" films I had seen in a while.  It follows the lives of three ""Lost Boys"" who survived their flight from the Sudan to Kenya as they are selected to go to America for re-settlement.
Their views of the excesses of our overly material society and their experience with racism brought tears to my eyes.  John Dau was mystified at American Christmas because in the refugee camp it would have been a day of dancing and singing, not feasting and gifts.  It was edifying to see that two of the three adjusted to life here and made successes of themselves.  One returned to Africa to continue to give back to his people.  John Dau was reunited with his family after many years of not even knowing if they were alive.",1386288000,,739,4.404411764705882

3049013,5,B0010IF6NW,"I'm a documentary fanatic and this rates eww I'd say in my top 30 or so list of favorites.  I have about 16,000 documentaries on my hard drive and seen even way more than that.  It's about this group of Kenyan boys that became refugees after a horridous civil war in Kenya.  It's follows their lives as they are given an opportunity to move to the U.S.A.  Keep in mind these are kids that have never known running water and only limited levels of electricity.  It really taught me about my own culture and how materialistic and isolated we have become.  It has given me a deep sense of appreciation for their culture, their values, their social structure, their emotions, and their humanity.  They learned alot in America, but I think I learned more from them.  This documentary should be required material for every child in the u.s.a.  I showed to all my classes when I taught school and kids were mentioning it years later.  I really got a sense that it deeply impacted their lives as well.  Selah.

From when they land in America, go to the grocery store for the first time and find jobs. The amount of new information that these refugees receive can be intimidating. Often, they deal with depression and loneliness because they miss their friends back home. For the most part it shows the boys accomplishing their goals and moving on in life. However, it also shows the boys who get sidetracked. The movie remains interesting the whole time because you see into a world you could have never understood before. It is a definite eye opener and a great movie to watch.",1355702400,,860,4.627450980392157
3049033,5,B0010IF6NW,"You tube review
This film ""God grew tired of us"" is a terrific eye opener in understanding life as a refugee in another country which has experienced war in Sudan, to cherish the gifts and resources that the United States contains as a developed Nation, and to follow the journey of Sudanese refugees as they seek liberty from the war in Sudan. In the late 1980's approximately 27,000 people fled Sudan after the Northern and Southern parts of Sudan broke out into a civil war over oil and its distribution of rights. These 27,000 people that decided to leave Sudan are referred as the ""Lost Boys"" and walked from Sudan to a Kenya refugee camp while only a portion of the 27,000 lost boys survived. This film helps Americans and Africans understand how the refugee act of the United States which was passed in 1980 helps refugees like the Lost Boys to seek a better living in the United States. This film shows how the lost boys Daniel, John Bul, and his friends adapt to life in America. The lost boys learn to use a bathroom, use telephones,live in an apartment, and find work in the United States. Overall the film is wonderful in helping any person to understand the life of a refugee and the transition of living in a new developed country. This film is an eye-opener for any American citizen in terms of cherishing the resources available in the United States especially after seeing the destruction of Sudan and poverty in Kenya.

But because of our corrupt government, the systems in different sectors of our society, and the mentality of ""the mass,"" I just had to leave my country and start anew--hard to admit, but true.  I miss home so much. There's no place like ""home."" But I am thankful to God that everywhere I go, I have a family.  I am grateful for the opportunity to grow and broaden my horizons in this country.  Each of us, immigrants, has a story to share.

3049035,5,B0010IF6NW,"Narrated by Nicole Kidman and produced by Brad Pitt, this documentary is about the thousands of male children who fled Sudan's civil war between the Muslim North and the Christian animist South in 1983.  This story of the the Lost Boys, as they came to be known, manages to be pleasant and uplifting.  It leaves you not with revulsion at the horrors the boys experienced, but with hope for their future.

The film follows three young men who are among 3,800 survivors handpicked by an international rescue committee to start a new life in the United States. They must leave behind friends and siblings in Kenya's Kakuma refugee camp for a cultural crash course in the U.S.

What impressed me most was the mature humanity of these very young boys in taking care of one another and creating community.  The lack of community in the U.S. is stark by comparison.  Some of those trained here are now using the gifts the U.S. does have to provide leadership in Africa to overcome the past destruction.",1348790400,,995,4.689655172413793
3049036,5,B0010IF6NW,"Many reviewers have already done an great job summarizing this excellent documentary about the lives of three men who fled war-torn Sudan as young boys, and after spending more than a decade in refugee camps in Ethiopia and Kenya, were among those chosen to come to America, aided by Catholic Charities International.

God Grew Tired Of Us is exceptional for several reasons.  First, it is an accurate portrayal of the plights of countless children who flee war-torn countries and grow up in refuge camps or settlements in Africa and in the Middle East.  Second, the documentary focuses on both the horrific conditions and atrocities of war, but also on the resourcefulness, ingenuity, and resolve of the children to adapt to their fate.  Third, while this documentary is at times heart-wrenching, it is also a poignant portrayal of the young boys humanity and spirit of community to act as caretakers for the other younger orphans among their groups.  Finally, their desire to survive and become empowered by education is what fires their determination to do well in their adopted country so that they can help the others left behind.  How admirable!  How honorable!

I've seen other movies about refugee children rescued by various organizations, which portrayed many of the challenges thousands of orphaned children face adapting to a new country and language.  Among the better movies was the Israeli-French film titled, LIVE AND BECOME, in which a young Christian boy living in a Sudanese refugee camp is disguised as a Jew and is sent with an Ethiopian Jewish mother [who recently lost her son], under the pretext that the boy is her child so that the two can escape in one of the first air lifts funded by Israel's 'Operation Moses'.

In both the documentary 'God Grew Tired Of Us' and the movie, 'Live And Become', the themes of cultural-ethnic heritage and the desire to maintain one's native country's cultural identity and customs is paramount.  Also, in the movie and the documentary the young adult men who achieve a level of success in their adoptive countries, while grateful, all have a strong desire and feelings of obligation to return to their native land, feeling compelled to help their fellow country men.

God Grew Tired Of Us, is definitely a 'must see' documentary to heighten our awareness of what life is like for hundreds of thousands of children domed to life in refugee camps.  Most importantly, it is a testament about survival and the power of the human heart to overcome seemingly hopeless challenges, if given an opportunity.

Buy this film. You won't be disappointed.

3049038,4,B0010IF6NW,"Have you ever heard of the Lost Boys of Sudan? Neither had I until I saw a blurb for this film. Since I know so little about the Sudan anyway, I thought a bunch of brave young men would be the best way to learn about it. In that, I was right.

Not really young men when they started out, however: the oldest was 11. There was a war between northern Sudan, which is Muslim, and southern Sudan, which is Christian and pagans -- animists, the film called them. The boys we are following are all Christians, and indeed, since it was a Christian organization that helped them, that's not too surprising.

But we're some five years ahead of our story. The Muslim soldiers had orders to kill all the males. All of them, right down to the babies. So those that could fled toward Ethiopia to the southeast. These were boys who had lived along the Nile, where there was plenty of water and green growing things. But once they were well away from the Nile, they crossed a great deal of arid land where there was no food or water. As one of the boys said later, they learned how to bury their dead. Burying little babies and toddlers who died of starvation and dehydration.

They made it to Ethiopia, where they lived in a rather meager refugee camp for about three years. Then the Ethiopian government changed, and they were forced to flee back through the southern tip of Sudan and into Kenya. There a refugee camp was set up, but the resources were very limited and what little they had was from donations. The one really good thing about this camp was a makeshift school where the boys learned English. They were there for some ten years. Finally a church organization arranged for some of them to come to America.

One of the really heart-wrenching scenes was where they explained to the interviewers what they expected. First of all, Pennsylvania is a country, right? So Philadelphia must be the capital. When told there is another large city, Pittsburgh, the young man said, ""Oh, yes, that's the city. I'm going to Pittsburgh."" They knew they would learn how to use electricity, go to school and get a job. Most of the rest of the differences they could scarcely imagine.

We follow three of the boys -- young men now -- as they go two to Pittsburgh and one to Syracuse. John Bul Dau went to Syracuse, and Daniel Abol Pach and Panther Bior went to Pittsburgh. Actually, there were more ""lost boys"" in each of these cities, but the film follows these three in detail.

Electric lights, indoor plumbing with running water whenever you need it, television and supermarkets were all new, and the social worker from the refugee organization had to explain everything to them. When they went to the supermarket, they were utterly amazed. That's one of my favorite scenes. What is this? Can you eat it? Is it for sale? Interestingly, one of them ends up working in Whole Foods later, and knows exactly how to describe things to the customers.

Actually, I was fascinated by how well they adapted to totally unfamiliar conditions. Some things they adapted to be more like back home, as when one of them crushed Ritz crackers and added milk (I think it was) and some other ingredients that made it something like what was familiar to them at home. They explained that Americans would probably think they were strange for eating with their fingers, but it helped them to keep in touch with their culture and not feel so homesick.

They were remarkably successful in a relatively short time, mostly because they were willing to work two or even three jobs so they could send money back to their families and the refugee camp back in Kenya. One (I think it was John) who believed his whole family was dead kept in touch with the Red Cross and eventually discovered that his mother and most of his sisters and brothers were still alive. Toward the end of the film, he brings his mother and one of his sisters to America. Another, Panther, I think, went back to Kenya and married his sweetheart and brought her back here. John created a non-profit organization that is building a medical center in Sudan, and Panther and his wife are returning to work with refugees.

They also attended a reunion of Lost Boys in Grand Rapid, Michigan, and later a conference in Texas, with the idea of forming an organization so they could not only keep in touch with one another, but help the others back in Africa.

All in all, a very inspiring story of three young men anyone would be proud to call friend.",1336780800,,4474,4.553482587064677
3049039,4,B0010IF6NW,"An emotionally-charged, unflinching look at the vast cultural gap between suburban America and war-ravaged central Africa. When a select few members of an impoverished clan of Sudanese expats are voluntarily selected for transplant to the United States, it seems like an act of charity. But after three months, these tall, eager, warm-hearted refugees - many of whom were fascinated by the electric lights above their seats on the flight over - are expected to come to terms with this brave new world, acclimate to the new social and temperate climates, find work and begin paying down the air fare Uncle Sam extended to them. Their passion to do so, and the extent of their successes over the ensuing years, is a source of deep inspiration. It's not without a political agenda, as is the case with most documentaries in this vein, but even after casting that aside there's a rich, poignant message waiting here.",1334016000,,912,4.928571428571429

3049049,4,B0010IF6NW,"The story of the thousands of Lost Boys who escaped the atrocities of the civil war in Sudan only to find themselves walking thousands of miles from one country to another is legendary.  There were so many deaths, and so much lost potential.

And some escaped the refuge camps.  This documentary, God Grew Tired of Us, is an extraordinarily intimate view of a few young men of the thousands who were resettled in the Untied States.  Their sincere amazement at tasting potato chips, or using a light switch, demonstrated the chasm of acclimation they needed for adjustment to their new home.  Some adjusted better than others, but all felt the gulf of separation from both their biological and their ""Lost Boys"" families.  To go from living near the richness of the Nile River to the desolation of a refuge camp to Syracuse, New York, is a truly remarkable journey.

John Bul Dau, Daniel Abol Pach and Panther Blor are featured in this documentary.  We experience their trials and tribulations, their loneliness, and their efforts to make a success of themselves while working to understand our culture.  ""Where is Santa Claus in the Bible?""

This is no ""rags to riches"" story.  If there is a theme, it is that education is the path out of minimum wage jobs, and that most people in the U.S. really don't appreciate what they have.  John Bul Dau can live here.  The majority of Americans would have an extraordinarily difficult time surviving in a Kenyan refugee camp.

This wonderfully done documentary reveals the reality these boys went through - from their journey 1000 across the desert into Ethiopia and Kenya, to their difficult adjustment and hard work in America and their road to a brighter future.

This documentary is so poignant and both heartwarming and heartwrenching, and made me more appreciative of my life here in America and more aware of the horrendous experiences of others hurt by war, conflict, and poverty.  And while I cried for the suffering of the Lost Boys, I also cried joyful tears for the good they achieved, and their determination, courage, and hard work of these men left me feeling hopeful - for despite the immense physical, mental, and spiritual pain they suffered, these men remained selfless, giving, kind, and never gave up.

3049064,5,B0010IF6NW,"God Grew Tired Of Us gives us a sensitive, human portrayal of the incredible strife the people of southern Sudan endured as they fled northern Sudanese troops entering their villages and killing their people. The footage of the Sudanese conflict does not pull any punches--it is quite graphic and I was truly upset by the needless suffering so many countless people faced. The characters in the United Nations refugee camp are easy to empathize with; and the plot of the documentary unfolds at a good pace that held my interest every step of the way. This is an outstanding documentary about a very long war in Sudan that received not enough attention from the United States and other world powers.

The documentary starts off showing the footage of the conflict and then we soon zone into a United Nations refugee camp in Kenya. It is touching to see these young men, now referred to as ""the lost boys of Sudan"" because they had nothing and no families left, forming makeshift families with deep interpersonal bonds. These young men also dream of finding their relatives who they lost when they had to flee their Sudanese villages very abruptly. Specifically, we meet three young men: Panther, John and Daniel. These young men are selected to live new lives in the USA; and the documentary follows them as they journey to America. We see them use an electric light switch for the very first time and they marvel at the ability of a refrigerator to keep food cold or even frozen. They need to be told how to use the restroom instead of a latrine and they receive much kindness and patience from the charities that help them acclimate to life in America.

Over time (this documentary covers a period of a little more than three years), we see them start to thrive. They can get jobs, go to school, buy cars--but they do complain that juggling all those jobs can be rough! However, they never seem to feel sorry for themselves; rather they display enormous personal strength and I truly admire John, Panther and Daniel.

In addition, with the passage of time the three young men begin to experience ever increasing separation anxiety from their homeland and those they left behind. It moved me greatly to see these young men sending so much money back to the refugee camp in Kenya so that the refugees there could have a better quality of life. One young man, John, finds his parents and his determination to help them financially when they can't even afford clothing is truly exemplary. The moment when he is reunited with his mother at an airport in America after at least twelve years of separation is one of the most emotional I've ever witnessed.

The DVD extras include a commentary and there's a very well done ""making of"" featurette as well.

Overall, I highly recommend this well done documentary. It greatly enhanced my understanding of the Sudanese War and on a human level it is very moving indeed.",1213228800,,2908,4.716535433070866

There is much more about the boys' lives in Sudan and especially their harrowing journey to the refugee camps in neighboring countries. The desert-crossing trek was a thousand miles on foot with almost no food and little water. One adolescent described his role in the long esacpe from war as almost an undertaker of sorts. He dug holes for the infants who died of malnutrition while their brothers, themselves children, carried them to a safe haven that came too late.

The most inspiring aspect of the documentary is watching the young Sudanese men develop in the U.S. Despite their many psychological scars, they make the most out of each opportunity. Some work two jobs and go to school. All send money back to African refugee camps. Whereabouts of mothers and siblings are unknown.

3049066,5,B0010IF6NW,"God Grew Tired of Us is a documentary tracing the experience of three young men -- from their war-torn Sudanese village as ""lost boys"" to their escape trek through hundreds of miles of dangerous terrain to their decade-long 'waiting' in Kenya's Kakuma refugee camp to their resettlement in the United States.

The story effectively shows the challenges facing these young men. While the US does offer opportunities,  the culture here is quite different from sunlit Africa. People in the refugee camps think everyone in the US is rich and has an easy life - learning the truth can be depressing. Also, thousands of lost boys had banded together when their families were killed. They did everything together.  But in the US - they are spread out across the country -- no longer close -- it can be quite lonely.  Additionally, with very few Sudanese women here, the opportunity to marry and continue their culture is challenged.

But, in spite of all this, the film is not depressing. These amazing young men find a way to adapt - yet be true to their heritage.",1204588800,,1058,4.759562841530054

If nothing else, watching ""God Grew Tired of Us"" will make Westerners realize just how much they take for granted in their daily lives.  For this is a wonderful and deeply moving documentary about three young men from Africa and their first, awe-inspiring encounter with the modern world.

John, Daniel and Panther are refugees who fled Sudan when war and genocide ravaged that once-beautiful country in the 1980`s.  They were part of a group of young boys who made an arduous and, for many, deadly trek from Southern Sudan to a refugee camp in Northern Kenya (those who survived the journey became known as ""The Lost Boys of Sudan"").  After living many years in substandard conditions at that site, 3,600 of the young men were given the opportunity to leave Kenya and start a new life in the United States.  John, Daniel and Panther were three of those individuals.

As written and directed by Christopher Dillon Quinn (and narrated by Nicole Kidman), ""God Grew Tired of Us"" begins in despair, relating a heartbreaking tale of harrowing mass murder and deadly privation, and ends in hope, showing how one changed life can positively affect the lives of so many others the world over.  For even though it vividly points out the bold line separating the haves from the have-nots in this world, the film also provides a great deal of optimism and humor, as the three young men explore the technological marvels of the strange new land in which they find themselves living:  food that comes prepackaged from a freezer, staircases that move up and down seemingly of their own accord, hot and cold water that comes flowing out of a tap, light that appears at the command of a switch.  One of the boys even admits to never having ""seen"" electricity before moving to America, and he worries over whether he will ever be able to master its use.  But all is not roses and soft mattresses for the three men when they arrive in the U.S., for they must also work hard, establish themselves as members of their communities, and adjust to some of the ""peculiarities"" of American culture, such as a marked tendency towards suspicion and a lack of friendliness on the part of some of the people they meet.  And, as with virtually all people who move to an alien yet economically advantaged society, they must cope not only with the loss of deeply-ingrained cultural traditions but a feeling of guilt for those they've left behind.

Yet, thanks to John, Daniel and Panther, ""God Grew Tired of Us"" becomes much more than a mere curiosity, a mere fish-out-of-water tale for the amusement of the Western elite.  Through lengthy interviews, the three men provide a rich and thoughtful commentary on their lives, their experiences, their values, their goals and their aspirations.  And though they struggle mightily with the psychic scars left by the traumas of their past, through their own inner strength and commitment - and never a hint of self-pity - they not only persevere to go on and make something of their own lives, but they are able to turn their personal tragedy into a force for Good, inspiring others in their neighborhoods to join them in raising America's consciousness about the atrocities still occurring in that corner of the globe.  And when, after three years in America, two of them are already making plans to go back to their homeland in the hope of bringing positive change to the region, we come to understand just how powerful a force commitment and caring can be in this world.

After immersing yourself in ""God Grew Tired of Us,"" you may never look at your own life - or the place you occupy in the world - in quite the same way again.

By all means, don't miss this one.",1198972800,,3689,4.710730948678072
3049071,5,B0010IF6NW,"I cannot believe I am the first person to review this movie.  An overwhelming story of hope in spite of unbelievable sufferering, and yet full of surprising humor. I was afraid it would be dull and heart-breaking, but I was surprised at the humor especially when the boys first come to the US.
Their perspective on the US culture is very sobering and still hopeful.  Everyone should see this movie especially young people.  What these men have been through is beyond inspiring.  It challenges me to make the most of my opportunities.",1198886400,,533,4.760869565217392
3049072,5,B0010IF6NW,"It is the rare movie which packs a powerful message without feeling strident or preachy.

3049074,5,B0010IF6NW,"I picked up this movie as an after thought at a video store.  To be honest I thought it was going to be a regular movie and was disappointed when I realized that it was a documentary.  But all of that changed after a couple of minutes of listening to these remarkable boys/men.  A very good friend of mine said that the best way to appreciate your country is to leave it for a while.

In this case we get the perspective of those that have never been here and come from such a tragic history.  It really brings perspective to yourself.

One thing that stuck in my mind was a lady's question to one of the men at a community pool.  She asked him if he noticed that he had more ""freedom"" here than there.  I think in America we are somewhat ignorant of what goes on ""out there"".  Not everything is about ""freedom"" like freedom of speech or fear of being wrongly prosecuted, or freedom of religion.  That is true with respect to communism or dictatorships.  These boys may have had greater ""freedom"" of opportunity, but they were not persecuted while living in Kenya.  Yet most Americans must think that everything out there is about freedom and it is not.  Most freedom people seek is freedom from poverty yet I bet you that is not what she meant.

That is not a criticism on the movie however.  The movie is fantastic and I highly recommend it.",1189382400,,1343,4.358870967741935
3049075,5,B0010IF6NW,"In America we keep being informed about what type of tragedies have happened and still do, in Africa, whether because of diamonds or religious disputes.  This documentary takes it much further, I think.  It portrays, what is possible, on top of the past, through help of others and through ones love for his own culture.  Positively educational.",1187913600,,345,5.017543859649122
3049076,5,B0010IF6NW,"The American experience takes on a whole new meaning when it is embraced by another culture.  If necessity is the mother of invention, then America is the modern inventor of the immigrant nation with open arms.  Immigrants have fled their countries out of want and persecution for nearly two centuries.  What makes `God Grew Tired of Us' so captivating is that it traces the footsteps of refugees fleeing war, poverty, and persecution ravaging Sudan since 1983.  Due to the keen editing of Johanna Giebelhaar and Geoffrey Richman, this nearly flawlessly paced documentary zeroes in on three male refugees who make their way to America and find a bewilderingly different life.  (""The good-hearted people of America asked us to be there."")

Using footage of the aftermath of the civil war between northern Muslim Arabs and the beleaguered southern Christians, we are shown long lines of refugees taking what little they have to Kenya where ghostly, emaciated figures wait warily in new lines for relief.  Displacement adds to their anxiety as relatives become unaccounted for.  Always concretely laying down the foundation of history, the film unflinchingly gives one a front seat to their predicament.

Enter Daniel Abol Pach, Panther Bior, and John Bul Dau.  They are the movie's central focus.  Like a few others, they are invited to the United States and offered the amenities of an apartment, a chance at employment, and the perks of our material benefits.  Daniel and Panther live in Pittsburgh; John lives in Syracuse.  It is a fascinating culture shock, one that shows their innocence in the face of our technology and their resolute determination to retain their culture.  (As one example we see almost quiet awe as their guide explains indoor plumbing.)  Always taking steps forward in opportunity, we see them work, experience bigotry, and come to terms with our way of life.  (""America is a very strange place...[but] if you can manage, it`s a land of opportunity."" --John Bul Dau)

While they thrive materially, they also experience separation anxiety.  Much of the time is spent showing their efforts to improve conditions for their relatives and countryman of Kenya.  Interviewing each man at key times is at the core of the movie.  Each man is articulate about his anxieties and aspirations throughout.  Visually the men's testimony is backed up by footage that is poignantly presented.

Writer/Director Christopher Quin has assembled a flowing presentation that lives up to `The National Geographic' name. 'God Grew Tired of Us' is profoundly titled for John's reflection of the Armageddon qualities of their native plight while he buried the dead at the tender age of ten.  It is also our ticket to a broader horizon and better understanding. (Nicole Kidman narrates.)  Fascinating.",1187481600,,2798,5.1529933481153

(I wish there were details given about what happened to him after that, but I assume that in order to protect his privacy the filmmakers decided to be discreet about it.)

3283504,4,B0010IF6NW,"This movie has all the hallmarks of a great story.  Its protagonists lose everything as children to the violent cruelty of a world they did not yet understand.  They underwent an epic journey of self discovery and survival as they trekked thousands of miles looking for a new life before ultimately winding up in America.  The characters are well developed and fully fleshed out- in particular the leader of the group who delivers the titular ""God Grew Tired of Us"" line.

However, the movie unfortunately fails to deliver its established promise.  Why are these men whiling away their time working minimum wage jobs in the northeastern United States?  Even more, why does the movie linger there for so long?  I suppose I can excuse the filmmakers because this WAS 2007, after all.  But still, why are these men not gathering resources in America, making connections, and then coming back to Sudan with millions of dollars, guns, and exacting revenge on all of their wrongdoers, preferably as they wave a tattered American flag?

This movie has all it needs except the ending: orphaned, misunderstood protagonists pursuing the American dream.  Where's the absurd amount of explosions, one-liners, scantily clad women, and overwhelming dubstep music?

Their views of the excesses of our overly material society and their experience with racism brought tears to my eyes.  John Dau was mystified at American Christmas because in the refugee camp it would have been a day of dancing and singing, not feasting and gifts.  It was edifying to see that two of the three adjusted to life here and made successes of themselves.  One returned to Africa to continue to give back to his people.

This film ""God grew tired of us"" is a terrific eye opener in understanding life as a refugee in another country which has experienced war in Sudan, to cherish the gifts and resources that the United States contains as a developed Nation, and to follow the journey of Sudanese refugees as they seek liberty from the war in Sudan. In the late 1980's approximately 27,000 people fled Sudan after the Northern and Southern parts of Sudan broke out into a civil war over oil and its distribution of rights. These 27,000 people that decided to leave Sudan are referred as the ""Lost Boys"" and walked from Sudan to a Kenya refugee camp while only a portion of the 27,000 lost boys survived. This film helps Americans and Africans understand how the refugee act of the United States which was passed in 1980 helps refugees like the Lost Boys to seek a better living in the United States. This film shows how the lost boys Daniel, John Bul, and his friends adapt to life in America. The lost boys learn to use a bathroom, use telephones,live in an apartment, and find work in the United States. Overall the film is wonderful in helping any person to understand the life of a refugee and the transition of living in a new developed country. This film is an eye-opener for any American citizen in terms of cherishing the resources available in the United States especially after seeing the destruction of Sudan and poverty in Kenya. Out of 5 stars, I give this film 5 stars.",1354924800,,1478,4.581132075471698

3283532,5,B0010IF6NW,"Narrated by Nicole Kidman and produced by Brad Pitt, this documentary is about the thousands of male children who fled Sudan's civil war between the Muslim North and the Christian animist South in 1983.  This story of the the Lost Boys, as they came to be known, manages to be pleasant and uplifting.  It leaves you not with revulsion at the horrors the boys experienced, but with hope for their future.

The film follows three young men who are among 3,800 survivors handpicked by an international rescue committee to start a new life in the United States. They must leave behind friends and siblings in Kenya's Kakuma refugee camp for a cultural crash course in the U.S.

What impressed me most was the mature humanity of these very young boys in taking care of one another and creating community.  The lack of community in the U.S. is stark by comparison.  Some of those trained here are now using the gifts the U.S. does have to provide leadership in Africa to overcome the past destruction.",1348790400,,995,4.689655172413793
3283533,5,B0010IF6NW,"Many reviewers have already done an great job summarizing this excellent documentary about the lives of three men who fled war-torn Sudan as young boys, and after spending more than a decade in refugee camps in Ethiopia and Kenya, were among those chosen to come to America, aided by Catholic Charities International.

God Grew Tired Of Us is exceptional for several reasons.  First, it is an accurate portrayal of the plights of countless children who flee war-torn countries and grow up in refuge camps or settlements in Africa and in the Middle East.  Second, the documentary focuses on both the horrific conditions and atrocities of war, but also on the resourcefulness, ingenuity, and resolve of the children to adapt to their fate.  Third, while this documentary is at times heart-wrenching, it is also a poignant portrayal of the young boys humanity and spirit of community to act as caretakers for the other younger orphans among their groups.  Finally, their desire to survive and become empowered by education is what fires their determination to do well in their adopted country so that they can help the others left behind.  How admirable!  How honorable!

I've seen other movies about refugee children rescued by various organizations, which portrayed many of the challenges thousands of orphaned children face adapting to a new country and language.  Among the better movies was the Israeli-French film titled, LIVE AND BECOME, in which a young Christian boy living in a Sudanese refugee camp is disguised as a Jew and is sent with an Ethiopian Jewish mother [who recently lost her son], under the pretext that the boy is her child so that the two can escape in one of the first air lifts funded by Israel's 'Operation Moses'.

In both the documentary 'God Grew Tired Of Us' and the movie, 'Live And Become', the themes of cultural-ethnic heritage and the desire to maintain one's native country's cultural identity and customs is paramount.  Also, in the movie and the documentary the young adult men who achieve a level of success in their adoptive countries, while grateful, all have a strong desire and feelings of obligation to return to their native land, feeling compelled to help their fellow country men.

God Grew Tired Of Us, is definitely a 'must see' documentary to heighten our awareness of what life is like for hundreds of thousands of children domed to life in refugee camps.  Most importantly, it is a testament about survival and the power of the human heart to overcome seemingly hopeless challenges, if given an opportunity.

Buy this film. You won't be disappointed.

3283535,4,B0010IF6NW,"Have you ever heard of the Lost Boys of Sudan? Neither had I until I saw a blurb for this film. Since I know so little about the Sudan anyway, I thought a bunch of brave young men would be the best way to learn about it. In that, I was right.

Not really young men when they started out, however: the oldest was 11. There was a war between northern Sudan, which is Muslim, and southern Sudan, which is Christian and pagans -- animists, the film called them. The boys we are following are all Christians, and indeed, since it was a Christian organization that helped them, that's not too surprising.

But we're some five years ahead of our story. The Muslim soldiers had orders to kill all the males. All of them, right down to the babies. So those that could fled toward Ethiopia to the southeast. These were boys who had lived along the Nile, where there was plenty of water and green growing things. But once they were well away from the Nile, they crossed a great deal of arid land where there was no food or water. As one of the boys said later, they learned how to bury their dead. Burying little babies and toddlers who died of starvation and dehydration.

They made it to Ethiopia, where they lived in a rather meager refugee camp for about three years. Then the Ethiopian government changed, and they were forced to flee back through the southern tip of Sudan and into Kenya. There a refugee camp was set up, but the resources were very limited and what little they had was from donations. The one really good thing about this camp was a makeshift school where the boys learned English. They were there for some ten years. Finally a church organization arranged for some of them to come to America.

One of the really heart-wrenching scenes was where they explained to the interviewers what they expected. First of all, Pennsylvania is a country, right? So Philadelphia must be the capital. When told there is another large city, Pittsburgh, the young man said, ""Oh, yes, that's the city. I'm going to Pittsburgh."" They knew they would learn how to use electricity, go to school and get a job. Most of the rest of the differences they could scarcely imagine.

We follow three of the boys -- young men now -- as they go two to Pittsburgh and one to Syracuse. John Bul Dau went to Syracuse, and Daniel Abol Pach and Panther Bior went to Pittsburgh. Actually, there were more ""lost boys"" in each of these cities, but the film follows these three in detail.

Electric lights, indoor plumbing with running water whenever you need it, television and supermarkets were all new, and the social worker from the refugee organization had to explain everything to them. When they went to the supermarket, they were utterly amazed. That's one of my favorite scenes. What is this? Can you eat it? Is it for sale? Interestingly, one of them ends up working in Whole Foods later, and knows exactly how to describe things to the customers.

Actually, I was fascinated by how well they adapted to totally unfamiliar conditions. Some things they adapted to be more like back home, as when one of them crushed Ritz crackers and added milk (I think it was) and some other ingredients that made it something like what was familiar to them at home. They explained that Americans would probably think they were strange for eating with their fingers, but it helped them to keep in touch with their culture and not feel so homesick.

They were remarkably successful in a relatively short time, mostly because they were willing to work two or even three jobs so they could send money back to their families and the refugee camp back in Kenya. One (I think it was John) who believed his whole family was dead kept in touch with the Red Cross and eventually discovered that his mother and most of his sisters and brothers were still alive. Toward the end of the film, he brings his mother and one of his sisters to America. Another, Panther, I think, went back to Kenya and married his sweetheart and brought her back here. John created a non-profit organization that is building a medical center in Sudan, and Panther and his wife are returning to work with refugees.

They also attended a reunion of Lost Boys in Grand Rapid, Michigan, and later a conference in Texas, with the idea of forming an organization so they could not only keep in touch with one another, but help the others back in Africa.

All in all, a very inspiring story of three young men anyone would be proud to call friend.",1336780800,,4474,4.553482587064677
3283536,4,B0010IF6NW,"An emotionally-charged, unflinching look at the vast cultural gap between suburban America and war-ravaged central Africa. When a select few members of an impoverished clan of Sudanese expats are voluntarily selected for transplant to the United States, it seems like an act of charity. But after three months, these tall, eager, warm-hearted refugees - many of whom were fascinated by the electric lights above their seats on the flight over - are expected to come to terms with this brave new world, acclimate to the new social and temperate climates, find work and begin paying down the air fare Uncle Sam extended to them. Their passion to do so, and the extent of their successes over the ensuing years, is a source of deep inspiration.

And some escaped the refuge camps.  This documentary, God Grew Tired of Us, is an extraordinarily intimate view of a few young men of the thousands who were resettled in the Untied States.  Their sincere amazement at tasting potato chips, or using a light switch, demonstrated the chasm of acclimation they needed for adjustment to their new home.  Some adjusted better than others, but all felt the gulf of separation from both their biological and their ""Lost Boys"" families.  To go from living near the richness of the Nile River to the desolation of a refuge camp to Syracuse, New York, is a truly remarkable journey.

John Bul Dau, Daniel Abol Pach and Panther Blor are featured in this documentary.  We experience their trials and tribulations, their loneliness, and their efforts to make a success of themselves while working to understand our culture.  ""Where is Santa Claus in the Bible?""

This is no ""rags to riches"" story.  If there is a theme, it is that education is the path out of minimum wage jobs, and that most people in the U.S. really don't appreciate what they have.  John Bul Dau can live here.  The majority of Americans would have an extraordinarily difficult time surviving in a Kenyan refugee camp.

This story will shock you, make you cry, make you laugh and mostly (I hope) move you to action. It's the story about the Sudanese (Lost)boys who walked thousands of miles to Kenya because in the early 1980's there was an order by the government to kill all boys no matter what their age. These 1000's of boys walked with the shirt (and sometimes no shirt) on their back, barefoot, starving, emanicipated and emotionally wiped out to a Kenya refugee camp. The things they experienced and witnessed are hard to imagine. It's a story where their is proof that suffering really brings strength to a person's spirit.

The docementary focuses on 3 of them (Panther, John & Daniel) who get selected to go to the USA after spending 15 years in the refugee camp. It's their story of struggles, their adaptation to American culture and their hopes and dreams. They are truly inspirational.

This wonderfully done documentary reveals the reality these boys went through - from their journey 1000 across the desert into Ethiopia and Kenya, to their difficult adjustment and hard work in America and their road to a brighter future.

This documentary is so poignant and both heartwarming and heartwrenching, and made me more appreciative of my life here in America and more aware of the horrendous experiences of others hurt by war, conflict, and poverty.  And while I cried for the suffering of the Lost Boys, I also cried joyful tears for the good they achieved, and their determination, courage, and hard work of these men left me feeling hopeful - for despite the immense physical, mental, and spiritual pain they suffered, these men remained selfless, giving, kind, and never gave up.

3283561,5,B0010IF6NW,"God Grew Tired Of Us gives us a sensitive, human portrayal of the incredible strife the people of southern Sudan endured as they fled northern Sudanese troops entering their villages and killing their people. The footage of the Sudanese conflict does not pull any punches--it is quite graphic and I was truly upset by the needless suffering so many countless people faced. The characters in the United Nations refugee camp are easy to empathize with; and the plot of the documentary unfolds at a good pace that held my interest every step of the way. This is an outstanding documentary about a very long war in Sudan that received not enough attention from the United States and other world powers.

The documentary starts off showing the footage of the conflict and then we soon zone into a United Nations refugee camp in Kenya. It is touching to see these young men, now referred to as ""the lost boys of Sudan"" because they had nothing and no families left, forming makeshift families with deep interpersonal bonds. These young men also dream of finding their relatives who they lost when they had to flee their Sudanese villages very abruptly. Specifically, we meet three young men: Panther, John and Daniel. These young men are selected to live new lives in the USA; and the documentary follows them as they journey to America. We see them use an electric light switch for the very first time and they marvel at the ability of a refrigerator to keep food cold or even frozen. They need to be told how to use the restroom instead of a latrine and they receive much kindness and patience from the charities that help them acclimate to life in America.

Over time (this documentary covers a period of a little more than three years), we see them start to thrive. They can get jobs, go to school, buy cars--but they do complain that juggling all those jobs can be rough! However, they never seem to feel sorry for themselves; rather they display enormous personal strength and I truly admire John, Panther and Daniel.

In addition, with the passage of time the three young men begin to experience ever increasing separation anxiety from their homeland and those they left behind. It moved me greatly to see these young men sending so much money back to the refugee camp in Kenya so that the refugees there could have a better quality of life. One young man, John, finds his parents and his determination to help them financially when they can't even afford clothing is truly exemplary. The moment when he is reunited with his mother at an airport in America after at least twelve years of separation is one of the most emotional I've ever witnessed.

The DVD extras include a commentary and there's a very well done ""making of"" featurette as well.

Overall, I highly recommend this well done documentary. It greatly enhanced my understanding of the Sudanese War and on a human level it is very moving indeed.",1213228800,,2908,4.716535433070866

There is much more about the boys' lives in Sudan and especially their harrowing journey to the refugee camps in neighboring countries. The desert-crossing trek was a thousand miles on foot with almost no food and little water. One adolescent described his role in the long esacpe from war as almost an undertaker of sorts. He dug holes for the infants who died of malnutrition while their brothers, themselves children, carried them to a safe haven that came too late.

The most inspiring aspect of the documentary is watching the young Sudanese men develop in the U.S. Despite their many psychological scars, they make the most out of each opportunity. Some work two jobs and go to school. All send money back to African refugee camps. Whereabouts of mothers and siblings are unknown. The fathers of Darfur are dead, victims of the ethnic cleansing which goes on to this very day.

We have done a terrible job since World War II of figuring out when to intervene in world affairs and when to keep out. Genocide, by definition, calls for immediate action.

The story effectively shows the challenges facing these young men. While the US does offer opportunities,  the culture here is quite different from sunlit Africa. People in the refugee camps think everyone in the US is rich and has an easy life - learning the truth can be depressing. Also, thousands of lost boys had banded together when their families were killed. They did everything together.  But in the US - they are spread out across the country -- no longer close -- it can be quite lonely.  Additionally, with very few Sudanese women here, the opportunity to marry and continue their culture is challenged.

But, in spite of all this, the film is not depressing. These amazing young men find a way to adapt - yet be true to their heritage.",1204588800,,1058,4.759562841530054

If nothing else, watching ""God Grew Tired of Us"" will make Westerners realize just how much they take for granted in their daily lives.  For this is a wonderful and deeply moving documentary about three young men from Africa and their first, awe-inspiring encounter with the modern world.

John, Daniel and Panther are refugees who fled Sudan when war and genocide ravaged that once-beautiful country in the 1980`s.  They were part of a group of young boys who made an arduous and, for many, deadly trek from Southern Sudan to a refugee camp in Northern Kenya (those who survived the journey became known as ""The Lost Boys of Sudan"").  After living many years in substandard conditions at that site, 3,600 of the young men were given the opportunity to leave Kenya and start a new life in the United States.  John, Daniel and Panther were three of those individuals.

As written and directed by Christopher Dillon Quinn (and narrated by Nicole Kidman), ""God Grew Tired of Us"" begins in despair, relating a heartbreaking tale of harrowing mass murder and deadly privation, and ends in hope, showing how one changed life can positively affect the lives of so many others the world over.  For even though it vividly points out the bold line separating the haves from the have-nots in this world, the film also provides a great deal of optimism and humor, as the three young men explore the technological marvels of the strange new land in which they find themselves living:  food that comes prepackaged from a freezer, staircases that move up and down seemingly of their own accord, hot and cold water that comes flowing out of a tap, light that appears at the command of a switch.  One of the boys even admits to never having ""seen"" electricity before moving to America, and he worries over whether he will ever be able to master its use.  But all is not roses and soft mattresses for the three men when they arrive in the U.S., for they must also work hard, establish themselves as members of their communities, and adjust to some of the ""peculiarities"" of American culture, such as a marked tendency towards suspicion and a lack of friendliness on the part of some of the people they meet.  And, as with virtually all people who move to an alien yet economically advantaged society, they must cope not only with the loss of deeply-ingrained cultural traditions but a feeling of guilt for those they've left behind.

Yet, thanks to John, Daniel and Panther, ""God Grew Tired of Us"" becomes much more than a mere curiosity, a mere fish-out-of-water tale for the amusement of the Western elite.  Through lengthy interviews, the three men provide a rich and thoughtful commentary on their lives, their experiences, their values, their goals and their aspirations.  And though they struggle mightily with the psychic scars left by the traumas of their past, through their own inner strength and commitment - and never a hint of self-pity - they not only persevere to go on and make something of their own lives, but they are able to turn their personal tragedy into a force for Good, inspiring others in their neighborhoods to join them in raising America's consciousness about the atrocities still occurring in that corner of the globe.  And when, after three years in America, two of them are already making plans to go back to their homeland in the hope of bringing positive change to the region, we come to understand just how powerful a force commitment and caring can be in this world.

After immersing yourself in ""God Grew Tired of Us,"" you may never look at your own life - or the place you occupy in the world - in quite the same way again.

By all means, don't miss this one.",1198972800,,3689,4.710730948678072

3283571,5,B0010IF6NW,"I picked up this movie as an after thought at a video store.  To be honest I thought it was going to be a regular movie and was disappointed when I realized that it was a documentary.  But all of that changed after a couple of minutes of listening to these remarkable boys/men.  A very good friend of mine said that the best way to appreciate your country is to leave it for a while.

In this case we get the perspective of those that have never been here and come from such a tragic history.  It really brings perspective to yourself.

One thing that stuck in my mind was a lady's question to one of the men at a community pool.  She asked him if he noticed that he had more ""freedom"" here than there.  I think in America we are somewhat ignorant of what goes on ""out there"".  Not everything is about ""freedom"" like freedom of speech or fear of being wrongly prosecuted, or freedom of religion.  That is true with respect to communism or dictatorships.  These boys may have had greater ""freedom"" of opportunity, but they were not persecuted while living in Kenya.  Yet most Americans must think that everything out there is about freedom and it is not.  Most freedom people seek is freedom from poverty yet I bet you that is not what she meant.

3283573,5,B0010IF6NW,"The American experience takes on a whole new meaning when it is embraced by another culture.  If necessity is the mother of invention, then America is the modern inventor of the immigrant nation with open arms.  Immigrants have fled their countries out of want and persecution for nearly two centuries.  What makes `God Grew Tired of Us' so captivating is that it traces the footsteps of refugees fleeing war, poverty, and persecution ravaging Sudan since 1983.  Due to the keen editing of Johanna Giebelhaar and Geoffrey Richman, this nearly flawlessly paced documentary zeroes in on three male refugees who make their way to America and find a bewilderingly different life.  (""The good-hearted people of America asked us to be there."")

Using footage of the aftermath of the civil war between northern Muslim Arabs and the beleaguered southern Christians, we are shown long lines of refugees taking what little they have to Kenya where ghostly, emaciated figures wait warily in new lines for relief.  Displacement adds to their anxiety as relatives become unaccounted for.  Always concretely laying down the foundation of history, the film unflinchingly gives one a front seat to their predicament.

Enter Daniel Abol Pach, Panther Bior, and John Bul Dau.  They are the movie's central focus.  Like a few others, they are invited to the United States and offered the amenities of an apartment, a chance at employment, and the perks of our material benefits.  Daniel and Panther live in Pittsburgh; John lives in Syracuse.  It is a fascinating culture shock, one that shows their innocence in the face of our technology and their resolute determination to retain their culture.  (As one example we see almost quiet awe as their guide explains indoor plumbing.)  Always taking steps forward in opportunity, we see them work, experience bigotry, and come to terms with our way of life.  (""America is a very strange place...[but] if you can manage, it`s a land of opportunity."" --John Bul Dau)

While they thrive materially, they also experience separation anxiety.  Much of the time is spent showing their efforts to improve conditions for their relatives and countryman of Kenya.  Interviewing each man at key times is at the core of the movie.  Each man is articulate about his anxieties and aspirations throughout.  Visually the men's testimony is backed up by footage that is poignantly presented.

Writer/Director Christopher Quin has assembled a flowing presentation that lives up to `The National Geographic' name. 'God Grew Tired of Us' is profoundly titled for John's reflection of the Armageddon qualities of their native plight while he buried the dead at the tender age of ten.  It is also our ticket to a broader horizon and better understanding. (Nicole Kidman narrates.)  Fascinating.",1187481600,,2798,5.1529933481153
