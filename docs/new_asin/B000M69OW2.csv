2725741,5,B000M69OW2,"I remember seeing this movie (& many other Charlie Chan's)
when they first came out. They were some of the best
mysteries ever made. Acting is fine and fast paced.
It,s fun to see Boris Karloff in this one. He is in
sanitarium and has no idea who he is. We can hear him
singing in beautiful baritone. One day he sees a newspaper
and a picture of a beautiful opera singer on it and
instantly becomes furious. Now he has realized who he is.
He escapes and is trying to find this singer and goes to
an opera in the city and hears her sing. He knocks out the
baritone who is singing with her and assumes his disguise
and goes on without the soprano guessing it is her ex
husband; she gradually realizes it as he continues to sing
in a much more beautiful baritone than the true one..as
she sings, she becomes more and more frightened and when
he is supposed to kill her, she screams and drops in a
dead faint but shortly they realize she is dead.
Boris Karloff is immediately jailed. Charlie and
#2 son feel he is not the guilty oneand set out to prove
it.  By the way, the opera that was performed was written
by Oscar Levant-the one and only.
Both Warner Oland and Sidney Tolar played Charlie at
different times and both were superb.",1333584000,,1231,4.260683760683761
2725742,4,B000M69OW2,"This 1936 black and white film stars Warner Oland, a non-Oriental, as Charlie Chan. A friend of Chan asks him to investigate a gambling ring that is fixing races by using quite a few devious means. The friend is then murdered. Chan decides to take the case and discover the gambling ring and the murderer. Chan discovers what the gamblers do to win. At one point he is kidnapped. Humor is added to the film by the stereotype antics of a black man who is unable to speak correctly and who is afraid of everything, a small monkey, and Chan's number one son who fumbles frequently as he tries to help his ""pop."" He also disguises himself as a stereotype Chinese man who speaks poor English.

 The film includes quite a few Can-ian witty epigrams, such as: Train of thought so broken, need wrecking crew to fix. Suspicion is often father of truth. Easy to criticize, more difficult to be correct. All forgotten like last year's bird nest. Hasty conclusion like toy balloon, easy to blow up and easy to pop. Man who plays with dynamite sometime fly with angels. Man with gun like lightning, never strike twice in same place. Baseless talk like boat without oar, gets no place.

2725743,5,B000M69OW2,"Charlie Chan vs. Boris Karloff is how this one is billed in the opening credits, but it is actually a tight little mystery with an opera setting that most Chan fans consider one of the best in the franchise. H. Bruce Humberstone returned as director while Scott Darling and Charles S. Belden adapted Fox's followup to Charlie Chan at the Race Track from a Bess Meredyth story. Thomas Beck made his final appearance in a Chan film here, having had parts in three of the Warner Oland films at Fox. He would be among the cast in two Mr. Moto entries as well. Those who remember William Demarest from My Three Sons on television will have a good time watching him here as a none too bright copper who can't keep up with the sharp mind of our most honorable Chinese detective from Hawaii.

A dark and rainy night at Rockland Sanitarium finds Boris Karloff playing the piano as he has every night for the past seven years. He has been unable to remember his name or past and is believed mad. Upon seeing a newspaper with a picture of Lilli Rochelle (Margaret Irving) this stormy night, however, he remembers being Gravelle, a great opera singer who supposedly burned up in a fire. He also remembers it was no accident, and the manhunt begins. Charlie is asked to assist in the hunt by the police, and son Lee (Keye Luke) forgets his romantic plans to help pop. As usual, Lee's help provides some humor, but also some clues. Lee dresses as a knight with his college pals and prowls the dark passageways beneath the opera house for clues at one point.

Gravelle wants revenge and soon the two leads are murdered, while the manhunt continues. Chan discovers marital jealousy present at the opera also, however, which points to other possible motives, and suspects other than Gravelle. Kitty (Charlotte Henry) and Phil (Thomas Beck) are a nice young couple seeking to meet with Rochelle on opening night and she proves to have a connection with the madman. Karloff is quite good here, never seeming over the top. A good cast and fun setting for Oland and Luke make this one a topflight entry in the Charlie Chan series.",1269561600,3,2109,4.591511936339523
2725744,5,B000M69OW2,"Charlie Chan at the Racetrack is one of the most exciting in this great series based on Earl Derr Biggers' Honolulu based sleuth. Warner Oland seemed to enjoy the lightning pace set by director H. Bruce Humberstone in this entry, as he and Keye Luke are obviously having a good time. Charlie actually slugs a guy in this one, vowing to apologise after same awakes from sleep! And Lee sets off a truck filled with fireworks while Charlie rectifies a wrong.

Charlie is revealing how to read blood spatter to other members of law enforcement when son Lee (Keye Luke) bursts in with a hot tip regarding a horse running in The Melbourne Cup in Australia. Even Charlie places a bet because he knows the owner. A jockey paid to throw the race lightens Lee's pockets, however, and soon leads to murder. Charlie hops onboard a Matson oceanliner and heads for the next race with a ship full of suspects and Lee, who has finagled a job onboard. Moving at a nice clip, a lot happens on the way to Santa Juanita, and even more once they arrive.

Charlie takes one in the leg onboard, and has Lee thrown in the brig to protect his foolish son! Keye Luke has a lot to do in this one, however, and the screenplay by Robert Ellis, Helen Logan, and Edward T. Lowe keeps us guessing till the end. Switched horses, a monkey, and a stylish 1930's look fashion this entry into a real winner. A nice little romance between Alice (Helen Wood) and Bruce (Thomas Beck) augment a tight and fast moving Charlie Chan fun for classic movie fans. Also available as part of a boxed set, Chan fans will be delighted watching this one.",1267315200,4,1602,4.464163822525597
2725745,4,B000M69OW2,"I always enjoy the byplay between Charlie Chan and his kids. Warner Oland was more loving to them in the early Chans while Sidney Toler was more insulting (but not in a mean-spirited way.)

In this episode, Oland lets Keye Luke get very involved in the case and Luke provides a number of laughs along the way.

This was an interesting script and had a decent number of action scenes along with it during the 70 minutes. There are some inventive twists to the story, regarding the crooks, too.

This is another Charlie Chan winner, and I am pleased to see is finally out on DVD.  It's part of the  Charlie Chan Collection Volume 2 set.",1233619200,4,634,4.431034482758621
2725746,2,B000M69OW2,"Most of the Charlie Chan films are notable for the dignity and respect that are shown to the Chinese-American ancestry of Charlie Chan. Only the missing articles in front of nouns, missing verbs, and tense slips mark the fictional Charlie as someone who isn't a native speaker of English. The accent is itself is not noticeably Chinese. Although Warner Oland was not of Chinese ancestry, his appearance is sufficiently oriental not to seem like ""black face"" makeup.

Those circumstances change, however, for the worse in Charlie Chan at the Race Track. Charlie doesn't change, but his son Lee (played by Keye Luke, who is a Chinese-American in reality) plays negative stereotype ""just off the boat"" roles (including Pidgin English) in undercover assignments for Charlie in this film. The story didn't need him to do this, so I felt it was gratuitous stereotyping.

That perception is reinforced by one of the most servile, cringing African-American stereotype Stepin-Fetchit roles I've ever seen by John H. Allen playing ""Streamline"" Jones. I felt disgusted to see this exploitation of an actor into reinforcing racial prejudices about laziness, drinking too much, and being a coward.

The story itself isn't much. A great race horse, Avalanche, has been born, bred, and trained in Australia. An American buys Avalanche to bring him to the U.S. to race at Santa Juanita (think Santa Anita).  An international gang of crooked gamblers is involved in sabotaging Avalanche so that they can collect on long shots.

Aboard a ship going to Honolulu, the horse's trainer is killed and mysterious notes float around making threats. It's obvious that Avalanche is switched with another horse, and Charlie sets out to reverse the switch while staying out of the gang's deadly clutches.

If you pay attention to the clues, you won't have any trouble identifying the murderer.  The rest is mostly Keystone Kops imitations involving Lee Chan.

As usual, the best parts of the movie come in Charlie's aphorisms: ""Record indicate most murder result from violence, and murder without bloodstain like Amos without Andy -- most unusual.""  That little gem leads into a lesson in how to interpret blood stains which turns out to be relevant to solving this mystery.

Unless you feel compelled to watch all the old Charlie Chan movies featuring Warner Oland, you can skip this one.",1203552000,,2360,5.090673575129534
2725747,4,B000M69OW2,"In Charlie Chan at the Opera, you'll see a combination of Phantom of the Opera and the Hunchback of Notre Dame displayed as a Charlie Chan mystery steeped in fine acting and good atmosphere.  As the movie opens, an unidentified amnesia patient (Boris Karloff) is compulsively playing the piano while singing opera at a sanitarium.  An attendant annoys him by interrupting, but offers the evening newspaper as solace.  The photograph of an opera singer, Lilli Rochelle (Margaret Irving), enrages the patient who knocks the attendant out and takes off wearing the attendant's uniform.

Later, Charlie Chan stops by to say good-bye to Inspector Regan before leaving on the night boat to Honolulu.  While there, Charlie ruffles Sergeant Kelly's feathers with deductions about the problems the police are having in finding the amnesia patient.  They are interrupted by Lilli Rochelle who drops in to report a death threat tied to that night's performance.  Charlie and the police agree to attend that performance to keep her safe.

At the opera, it becomes clear that Lilli has been seeing her baritone, Enrico Barelli, much to the annoyance of Madame Barelli and Lilli's husband, Mr. Whitely.  All of that turmoil is interrupted when the amnesia patient shows up in Madame Barelli's dressing room, and she identifies him as Gravelle, a baritone who had ""died"" in an opera house fire.  Gravelle claims that someone locked in his dressing room, but he escaped anyway and is just recovering his memory.

As the plot goes on, dead bodies begin to pile up and the police are at a loss to track down the unauthorized people who are wandering through the opera house.

A lot of the appeal of this film comes from the fine acting performances by Boris Karloff and Warner Oland who are supported well with some very funny scenes and gags by William Demarest as Sergeant Kelly and Keye Luke as Charlie's oldest son.  Charlie also shows himself to be advanced scientifically as he brings up finger prints with acid and arranges for a newspaper to send a photograph by the equivalent of a fax in the 1930s.

The film is fast moving.  It has to be.  Charlie wants to make that night boat back to Honolulu so he can see the rest of his family again.

The ""Chinese"" sayings of Charlie Chan also provide lots of humor.  Here is my favorite from the film:  ""Luck -- happy combination of small accidents"" which is offered by Charlie as a face-saving explanation why Sergeant Kelly wasn't able to figure out what was going on.",1203379200,,2503,4.80607476635514
8166719,4,B000M69OW2,"The story begins with Charlie Chan giving a lesson is blood stain pattern to the Honolulu police, but that is interrupted by news of a horse race which excites everybody, and the policemen all place their bets. Unfortunately the favored horse loses. But that horse, along with their fellow racehorses, are taken aboard a ship from Australia to Honolulu, and en route the favored horse's owner is murdered, supposedly by being kicked by a horse. Chan is called in and quickly proves otherwise, but this is only the beginning.

The ship goes to the U. S. mainland where the horses are to race, but there are some gambling racketeers behind the scenes-what do they plan to do, and can Chan foil them? Again the story keeps you guessing, and comic relief aplenty is provided by Number One Son and his antics. There is another stereotypical high-strung black person who plays a minor role in this movie. (The problem is less that such characters exist than the fact that black people never seem to be cast in any other roles in that era.)",1488153600,,1033,4.675824175824176
8166720,5,B000M69OW2,"A lunatic escapes from a mental asylum after seeing a newspaper article about an opera production at a nearby theater. The police fail to find him, and Charlie Chan happens to be nearby. The maniac is believed to be a former opera singer supposedly killed in a Chicago opera house fire years ago, with intentions of taking revenge on the opera stars who had locked him in the opera house. But there are feuds and intrigues among the opera cast and crew as well.

But the story is not so simple after all. The maniac is at the opera house, but why is he there? For revenge, or for some other reason? The story takes on very unexpected turns before it concludes.

Good performances by all, especially by Boris Karloff who plays the maniac without overdoing it, and it is not merely Number One Son who provides comic relief.",1488067200,,821,4.503355704697986
8166721,5,B000M69OW2,"Charlie Chan at the Race Track, 1936 film

Charlie Chan says most murders involve bloodstains, and this helps to recreate the crime. He demonstrates the differences of height and velocity. A radio relays the news of an Australian horse race. Did the jockey fix the race? The jockey is disciplined but gets his payoff. Is this a case for Charlie Chan? On the ship to America Major Bordon Kent was kicked to death by the horse Avalanche. Was it really an accident? One passenger stays in his cabin. Chan observes the blood spatter on the wall of the stall. A horse only kicks backwards. Chan explains the meaning of the bloodstains. The investigation will continue.

A threatening note warns against entering the Santa Anita race. Charlie observes the note. His son works as a cabin boy and finds a typewriter. There is another threatening note against entering a horse in the race. Is this a ruse? There is an emergency in the forward hold. Where was the guard? Will they take an extra precaution? There is a shot! Chan studies how a cigarette and a matchbook can set a fire. Cargo is unloaded in Los Angeles. Could someone switch horses? This would allow an unknown to win the race and the gamblers would profit! Goodbye, Collins.

Can a horse be held back to shift the odds? A photoelectric cell records the winner of a horse race. Can a drug affect performance? A prowler shoots at Chan! The gamblers plot their scheme, then kidnap Chan and his son. The jockeys refuse to ride Avalanche, except for one. The Chans escape! There is an distraction at the racetrack. Chan neutralizes a disguise. The police arrest the gamblers. [Watch the expressions of the bettors!] Then a horse falls! How did somebody shoot a dart? Chan deduces the murderer and explains how he did it. There is another surprise at the end.

This is a very good story about the sport of horse racing. It should educate you about the many ways of fixing races. The beginning reminds me of Conan Doyles story Silver Blaze. Would you bet on an event that might be rigged? What can be done to prevent these scams and tricks?",1482969600,,2089,4.622641509433962

8166725,5,B000M69OW2,"While some may consider that there is less mystery than usual in this Charlie Chan film, there is still enough of a twist along with the presence of Boris Karloff to make it satisfying enough. HOWEVER - what truly elevates this movie above the norm and makes it extremely worthwhile is the original operatic score by Oscar Levant for the opera CARNIVAL that serves as the centerpiece for this movie in more ways than one. Karloff plays the part of an incarcerated killer, wrongly convicted years ago, for the murder of someone who was a participant in the earlier version of CARNIVAL. Reading that it was about to return in a new performance, Karloff escapes with the determination to sing the lead role which was his originally as well as exposing the identity of the true murderer. After several minor mishaps, the opera is about to go on. An earlier humorous remark on the part of a stage manager/director is a delightful nod to Karloff's other famous role: ""This show will go on even if Frankenstein himself appears.""  In any event, Karloff does appear and the police are fully aware of his presence. But how to capture him, keep everyone safe, allow the opera to proceed, and - thanks to Chan - reveal who the real culprit was and still is constitutes the balance of the movie (NO SPOILERS HERE). Karloff, who knew no Italian, mouthed whatever came to mind as he plausibly pretended to do the actual singing while his own voice was dubbed by someone else for the finished product. It's a shame that this film couldn't have been filmed in color which would have been quite spectacular. As it was, the captivating music wedded to Karloff's appearance as well as Warner Oland's classic Chan and the antics of one of his many sidekick sons makes this a most rewarding movie. One final note: Levant's score for this movie has been separately recorded. He was also a gifted pianist in his own right and friends with the Gershwins. It was Levant's ""unending"" stay with the Gershwin's that gave rise to the play ""The Man Who Came to Dinner"".",1467504000,,2038,4.661111111111111
