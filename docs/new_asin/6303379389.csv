8615220,5,6303379389,"Covert communicates fitness theory in a fun, understandable fashion. This is the BEST video I have seen on exercise physiology. The information presented in this video can be used by all fitness levels - from couch potato to olympic athlete. I also recommend purchasing the book by the same name and author.",1146614400,2,307,4.923076923076923
8615221,1,6303379389,"This video is the worst waste of money I ever spent. I have the book ""Smart Exercise"" which is very informative and excellent coverage of the latest technical info on the subject. However, the video is  presented for idiots--few charts and some silly remarks! DON'T BUY THE  VIDEO!  I have called Covert and let him know what I think.",949795200,10,334,4.627118644067797
