The interview with the main star John Levy tells it all. You can see he was young and just wanted an income and a nice hotel to stay at. By his facial expression I could tell he was wondering why they are even trying to sell this movie. Its has NO budget and the acting is terrible. Please don't waste you money on this DVD,",1333929600,,455,4.241379310344827
4190394,3,B003THSXLE,"Cannibal Girls is sort of like an H.G. Lewis movie, only not near as gory or as entertaining. I was disappointed by this film because with a title like Cannibal Girls, you expect gory, trashy fun. What I got was about one minute of gore, and a couple of minutes of trashy fun. I almost gave this movie two stars instead of three, but the last ten minutes or so are what I expected the whole movie to be: bloody and disgusting. And this film has the hairiest men I've ever seen. There's one man who's arms and back are covered in hair. I'm sure if he would have taken his pants off, his butt would have been as well. Anyway, Cannibal Girls is only worth seeing for fans of 70's trash.",1294790400,2,683,4.181818181818182
4190395,3,B003THSXLE,"Cannibal Girls may well be a curiosity more than a ""must have"", but while it's not overly great, it has a certain strangeness about it that I found appealing.  Pre-SCTV actors Eugene Levy & Andrea Martin play a young couple who go to vacation in the small town of Farnhamville.  They check into a local hotel and, on the recommendation of the manager, they go to dine at a local restaurant that was once the scene of legendary horrors, being that there were three young women who lured men into their farmhouse, where they killed and ate them.  The restaurant is rather creepy and so are their hosts, and after getting a bit tipsy they decide to stay the night, with predictably dire results.  But is this all for real?  Seemingly not, but the nightmare is not quite over.

The humor in this is rather dry and will not be appreciated by some.  There are a couple pretty funny moments that were supposedly improvised, and one scene where I did laugh out loud.  Just the idea that our young couple keep going on about how ""beautiful"" the place is that they've chosen to stay in is rather funny in itself, since it's basically just some small dumpy town with lots of dirty snow piled everywhere.  The horror, well, it's nothing you've never seen before but there is also a ""horror horn"" to alert one to scenes where you need to look away if you're squeamish (and the sound of a doorbell, that I suppose is to alert one to when it's OK to look again).

There is also a special feature interview with Ivan Reitman & Daniel Goldberg, which gives some insight into the film and the trials and tribulations they went through to complete it.  Some of the interview is interesting but at some point it started feeling almost as long as the film itself.

I'd say this has rather limited appeal, it's not rollicking comedy nor is it particularly effective horror either, but it has a certain strangeness about it that I enjoyed.  If you enjoy horror films of early 70's vintage, you'll probably want to see this.  3.5 out of 5 stars.",1288051200,9,2021,4.501369863013698
4190396,3,B003THSXLE,"I've seen a lot worse with these types of cannibal exploitation movies. With these cannibal movies, it's easy to complain about the picture and sound quality, the acting, and the weak plots.

While this does have some of that late 70's exploitation nostalgia, it is just a disordered movie.  Cannibal Girls (1973) is absolutely absurd but surprisingly amusing as an exploitation movie, as Cliff and his girlfriend Gloria, depart for a weekend trip in Farnhamville, that is soon interrupted by three pesky cannibals.

4190397,1,B003THSXLE,"Cannibal Girls (Ivan Reitman, 1973)

Ivan Reitman produced and directed some of the most beloved films of the late seventies and early eighties, including Meatballs, Stripes, Ghostbusters, and Heavy Metal. What most people forget when thinking about this is that Reitman started out in horror and low-budget sex, including being the producer of record for David Cronenberg's first big north-of-the-border hits, Shivers and Rabid. So it probably shouldn't be a surprise that Reitman's first directorial efforts were exploitation films like this, an hysterically bad piece of silliness about a haunted restaurant where a young married couple (Eugene Levy and Andrea Martin, who would later become stalwarts of the Second City troupe) are convinced to spend the night. And you have to give Reitman an A for effort; obviously someone who saw this and his other early work found it decent enough to give him a job. (Thank you, Mr. Cronenberg.) But oh, my, this movie is terrible. The script is horrendous, the dialogue painful, the acting less interesting than the landscape (which is badly-shot throughout), the big plot twist, well, not much of a twist at all. Foreshadowing? Foreshadowing with a ballpeen hammer, perhaps.

Had it not been directed by Ivan Reitman, this movie would have faded into obscurity years ago. It certainly deserves to. *",1254268800,,1344,5.217592592592593
8405100,5,B003THSXLE,"This is one of the great, unsung grindhouse horror movies, a little flick from Canada, filled with some familiar faces.  It's equal parts horror and cheeky comedy, with some inspiration from Sweeney Todd.",1519776000,,204,5.181818181818182
8405101,5,B003THSXLE,"Spoiler Alert...Where to start...Well, this film had a very profound effect on me as a young teenager when I first saw it late at night around 1985. The effect is still the same to this day. I was so overwhelmed by the feel of this movie that I became obsessed with finding all the filming locations after I saw it again in 1988. I am also astonished at how under-rated this gem is.

I'm a big fan of classic 1970's Canadian cult films and this tops my list. Yes it even beats out other Canadian 1970's horrors gems like: Deranged, Black Christmas, Death Weekend and Rituals. There is just so much going on here: including the complex and eerie soundtrack which adds to the overall feel. This piece of music is an unknown masterpiece, that goes through minor and major chord sequences and changes key with each round. The camera used brings out that 1970's feel to its extreme. There is comedy interchanged within the dialogue and the horror, and the actor choices were spot on.

Eugene Levy (Clifford) and Andrea Martin (Gloria) of SCTV fame were cast well as the main characters. They start out driving in the snowy wilds of Ontario looking for a place to stay. The two come to Farnhamville (Beaverton) and are mystically controlled into staying there by the townsfolk. They end up staying at the old Oak Inn (Oak Ridges) and the hotel owner, May Jarvis, takes them back in time when she tells them a story of a legend involving three girls who methodically lure unsuspecting men to their century farm house (Aurora), in which each is systematically murdered and chopped up for feasting on. These feasts give the girls everlasting life. The scene involving one of the men being tied seductively to the bed by the girls is very effective (he is eaten alive after all). We soon learn who is really in control, however.

Enter Ronald Ulrich-- one must experience the work done by the consummate stage professional, who plays the Reverend St John. This was his second foray into the movie business (and sadly his last). This guy nails the character to a T. His look and his voice bring this character to life. He still terrifies me. Not only was he naturally mesmerizing, but also had a very comedic sense which he brought to the table (literally). His lines delivered to Clifford are priceless--humour done with a slight smirk. His power over the 3 girls is also intoxicating. They will do anything for him, including singing an eerie song in unison when he recites lines from Shakespeare. Had any other actor played this part it just would not have worked.

Eventually things become more and more confusing and horrific for the couple. Much has been said on the dream sequence and I personally don't buy it. Other films offer more confusing dream sequences (Nightmare on Elm Street for example) but no one seemed to ever complain about those. For me, the dream sequence adds to the overall mind game the Reverend is able to play. In fact, the Reverend has one more thing up his sleeve. He is going to make Gloria the 4th Cannibal Girl and he is going to get her to murder her own partner in the process. How does the Rev get her to do this and how does Gloria finish Clifford off? Watch the movie to find out. The girls will live forever on human flesh and its implied that the townsfolk of Farnhamville will too. Soon Gloria will be dining with her new family. The family table is covered in Clifford's flesh and organs- her initial moral judgment against such acts are overcome as she partakes at the feast.

Lastly, May Jarvis is seen back at her hotel where she welcomes a new couple with the same story she told Clifford and Gloria, confirming the assumption that the whole town is in on the Reverend's scheme.

Ps- I was quite upset at the cover art on the DVD. The Reverend and all three girls looked nothing like those pictured. The Reverend on the cover doesn't even suit the part.",1484352000,,3890,4.581896551724138
8405102,4,B003THSXLE,"It's great to see these familiar faces so early in their careers, and to see what they would do if given the chance to make a movie at the time. Scary, but with tongue planted firmly in cheek. Also, in the special features the story of trying to sell the movie to Sam Arkoff is priceless.",1472428800,,288,4.160714285714286
8405103,4,B003THSXLE,"Vacationing couple Cliff and Gloria (Second City vets Eugene Levy and Andrea Martin) are on their way to Farnhamville (""The Friendly City"") when their car breaks down in the middle of nowhere. They eventually get it started, but not before we spot someone spying on them through the trees in the snowy forest. Once they get to town, Cliff meets another out-of-town man who is looking for his missing sister (He's eventually murdered by two local garage mechanics). Cliff and Gloria get a motel room and the motel owner tells them the ""legend"" of the three sisters who lived in the area. They lured men to their house with the promise of sex, fatten them up with home-cooked meals and then kill them while in the sack. Their hunchback servant, Bunker, then chops up the bodies into manageable pieces and puts the dismembered parts in a freezer in the basement to be eaten later. Yes, the three girls were (are) cannibals and the motel owner tells Cliff and Gloria that the sisters' house is now a restaurant and they should have dinner there tonight. At the restaurant (which has only one dish on the menu), they are greeted and entertained by the Reverend (Ronald Ulrich), the tux and tophat-wearing owner who, with the three sisters, serves Cliff and Gloria a meal they will never forget. It becomes apparent that the Reverend is the leader of the town and all the citizens are cannibals. Cliff and Gloria spend the night at the Reverend's house (he scares them into staying by telling them that there's a maniac on the loose) and Cliff is hypnotized by the Reverend, but Gloria gets away. The next morning, Gloria tries to convince Cliff to leave, but he refuses to believe her story (he's still under the Reverend's power). With their car being repaired and all the outside phone lines down, Gloria must get Cliff to snap out of it before they both become a menu item in the Reverend's restaurant. It all ends back at the Reverend's house, where a shocking act of betrayal seals Cliff and Gloria's fate. Bon Appetite!  This bloody Canadian horror/comedy is an early directorial credit for Ivan Reitman, who would later produce David Cronenberg's SHIVERS (1975) and RABID (1977) and then graduate to the big leagues directing films like GHOSTBUSTERS (1984), KINDERGARTEN COP (1990), EVOLUTION (2001) and many others. Rough around the edges (the boom mike is visible in a few scenes, some of the acting is amateurish and parts of the film drag), CANNIBAL GIRLS is still an enjoyable low-budget gore romp that doesn't have as much comedy as you would expect, especially from the two main stars. Eugene Levy (nearly unrecognizable, he looks like Gene Shalit here) and Andrea Martin are rather subdued (a lot of the dialogue between Levy and Martin was improvised) and are nothing like the characters they played on SCTV. The comedy comes mostly from the absurdities of the situations and some of the townspeople's character traits. There's also funny little bits going on in the background of some scenes, such as when Cliff and Gloria are walking through town and we see the local barber cut off a patron's ear while giving him a shave. The film is full of nudity (none by Levy or Martin) and gore, including axe murders, stabbings, dismemberments, flesh eating and a nasty mace killing. This little-seen gem was originally shown in theaters (distributed by American International Pictures) with the gimmick of a ""Warning Bell"" that would ring every time a violent scene was about to happen. The print I viewed (supplied by a Canadian friend) was, thankfully, free of this annoyance. This film never got a home video release in the U.S. (it was distributed in Canada on VHS from the CIC label), on VHS or on DVD. Ivan Reitman (who owns the U.S. rights) is holding up the release and is known not to speak fondly of it. He really has nothing to be ashamed of. It's highly watchable and kind of twisted. Also starring Alan Gordon, Allan Price, Bob McHeady, May Jarvis and Randall Carpenter, Bonnie Nielson and Mira Pawluk as the Cannibal Girls. Finally available on DVD courtesy of Shout! Factory.

The little bit of skin action kind of makes up for the bad acting but the lame jokes are just that lame. In some parts this film try's to take itself too seriously and in others bad jokes and even bad banter make you roll your eye. It's worth a watch if you just need a B movie to fill the gap between A and C movies. Try to rent cheap are even better watch for free with a prime membership.

8405109,3,B003THSXLE,"Moving at a leisurely pace and told in a disjointed fashion, Cannibal Girls (1973) follows a young couple on vacation in Canada, who find themselves in the midst of great evil a small town.  Directed by Ivan Reitman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stripes/dp/B0008JIJ2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stripes</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghostbusters/dp/B000PEX1IE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghostbusters</a>), the movie features future SCTV members Andrea Martin and Eugene Levy, as an unsuspecting lovers who encounter a kooky reverend and three young women who practice cannibalism.

When their car breaks down in the town of Farningham, young lovers Clifford Sturges (Levy) and Gloria Wellaby (Martin), take lodging at a motel, where the owner informs them of the town's legendary cannibal women.  Three beautiful young ladies, who sometime in the past, made a practice of luring men to their farmhouse, where they were killed and eaten.

Cliff and Gloria go to dine a restaurant, located in the residence of Reverend Alex St. John (Ronald Ulrich), which has a rather macabre heritage, and is also the modern home of the three cannibal girls.  The travelers wind up spending the night as guests of St. John, and they experience a strange night of terror.  One of the film's few really scary moments features Gloria running through the snowy woods in the dead of night.  This effective scene apparently turns out to be a dream, however with many in the town aiding St. John, it is not long before the web of evil closes in, and envelops the couple.

Shot in Canada under mostly snowy conditions, this low budget production kind of crawls along, and also meanders off track at times, but the occasional instances of violence are pretty well done, and keep things lively.  The acting and dialog isn't particularly good, but Martin and Levy are kind of interesting to watch, at this early point in their careers.  Some decent gore and occasional nudity provides just enough, to make for a mild recommendation.  Rating 2.5 stars.",1343606400,,2108,5.576802507836991
