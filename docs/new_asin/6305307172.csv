1010866,1,6305307172,"I will put it clearly: it is the worst piece of crap I have ever seen. I really love this kind of flicks, I always defend the worth of horror trash movies, but Boogeyman lacks of gore, imagination, and suspense. Don't waste your time.",1074729600,6,234,4.340909090909091
1010867,4,6305307172,"To watch either of these Uli Lommel horror films is to enter a different world. One feels that if another director had tackled either of these films, they would have been nothing more than schlocky low budget horror. But there's an intangible creepiness to Lommel's horror that overcomes the silliness of some scenes (being killed by a swinging medicine chest mirror, for example). Perhaps the sheer oddness of scenes like that contribute to the eeriness. The stories in both of these films are something akin to a cinematic non sequitar. They somehow seem to be lacking your standard A plus B equals C logic of a script. And yet there is a strange continuity to the films, an odd, dreamlike logic to them. One does not easily forget either of these films. I first saw The Boogeyman many years ago and it was always a favorite of mine. After many years of not seeing it, I purchased the DVD. Watching it anew after all these years, I noticed for the first time its surreal quality. And then there's the Devonsville terror, which has no right to be as good as it is. It shouldn't be. It should be stupid and boring. But somehow it's not. I highly recommend these to open-minded horror fans and fans of weird cinema. These films are not easily forgotten.",1013385600,17,1252,4.59375
1010868,4,6305307172,"Okay where do I even begin reviewing these movies? I had always heard about ""dark"" horror movies before but had never actually seen any until just yesterday. I knew that these movies were that kind and I wanted to see what they were like. Well they are FAR different from Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, etc., both for different reasons. I guess one reason is that they aren't exactly modernized. These aren't the slasher-type movies that are so popular today.
The Boogey Man: I never really even notice how clear the image is or anything, but the first thing I noticed on this side of the disc was how perfect the picture was! The movie started off with a bang and then went downhill a little bit, but stayed interesting throughout. To me it was at times hard to understand what exactly was going on. This is one of those movies that actually makes you think! Even with its sometimes confusing plot, this was a pretty good movie. There is something about it that you can't quite place that is very creepy...
The Devonsville Terror: Had one of the best openings in a movie I have ever seen in my life. I agree with those who say they will never be able to get some of those images out of their heads! The idea of witchcraft in early days was a great idea and I wish the whole movie would have been about that. I grew really bored with the movie when it got to the ""300 years later"" part. Some parts were extremely unrealistic. I expected it to be great because of Donald Pleasence. He did outstanding performances in the Halloween films, but in this movie he couldn't because the character was so vaguely portrayed.
Get the DVD for the Boogeyman and the beginning of The Devonsville Terror, but not if you ONLY like Scream-type horror movies.",994377600,7,1751,4.457943925233645
1010869,3,6305307172,"I enjoyed this now dated cult horror classic. It was quite spooky and clever, with a lot of memorable scenes. In the U.K it is titled The Bogeyman although I can't understand the difference. And why oh why did the  BBFC see fit to ban this film?",955756800,4,245,4.212765957446808
1010870,4,6305307172,"This is only a review of The Boogeyman, as I have not seen The Devonsville Terror. It is a well-made and enjoyable film, even though John Carradine is only in it for about four minutes. It's not very scary, though. This film  got banned in the U.K. a few years ago, Which highlights how moronic the  British censors are.",951955200,3,320,4.406779661016949
1010871,5,6305307172,"I've seen the Devonsville Terror, I have it.  It is a great show about witches that are killed in that witch hunt thing where they killed everyone convicted of witch craft, and then the witches curse them.  Then a new  teacher moves to town and the curse comes.  It scared me, HORRIFYING! A  must have!",923529600,3,302,4.418181818181818
7887782,5,6305307172,GREAT to see The Devonsville Terror again I saw this movie in 1986 while I was living in Boston Mass . iT gave me a creepy feeling. The seller New Frontier Cinema did a great job sending it,1443657600,,189,4.0
7887783,4,6305307172,"I'll watch any genre of horror movie, from slashers, gorefests, cheap thrills, and psychological to terror.

These are okay horror films, but could have been a lot better. I have these both on The Boogeyman/Devonsville Terror DVD. The Boogeyman horror film is the superior.

Devonsville Terror - This overlooked horror entry boasts eerie color photography and an interesting story about small town fears and prejudices. Three progressive women arrive in a small town, and the locals fear they are the reincarnation of three witches destroyed by the townsfolk hundreds of years ago. Some shocking violence against the women guarantees some spectacular revenge.

An interesting, worthwhile horror film that offers both shocks and disturbing ideas.",1383004800,2,745,5.517543859649122
7887784,1,6305307172,"What a crap pair of movies these two are, a piece of mirror that contains the dead spirit of some bondage sicko who wants to kill for a change (oh well, I guess bondage does get boring) and a witch back for revenge on a town where the characters are so annoying, you'll be begging for the next murder to hurry up and take place. I can see now why they put these two movies together on this double sided disc as a form of flipping torture.",1301788800,2,438,4.045977011494253
7887785,4,6305307172,The 1st film of the boogeyman was pretty atmospheric and had a scary tone thru out and the 2nd film of the devonsville terror carried on in much the same manner. It was interesting to see suzana love starred in both films but she looked a little different in the 2nd film cuz her hair was different and she was 3 years older.,1297382400,3,325,4.174603174603175

7887787,2,6305307172,"""The Boogey Man"" is unforgivable...in its ripoff of John Carpenter a la ""Halloween"" from its shooting angles to the sets to the music...I didn't waste my time on that heap of crap.....BUT, ""The Devonsville Terror"" grew and grew on me: even though the visuals are grainy and at times unfocused the setting of New England in Autumn suckered me right in; the small town paranoia and creepiness; the plotting, wife-killing shop owner; even the dialogs around the table, as jilted as they are, have a low-budget charm about them.  Lommel utilizes the natural environment of New England quite well to build the unsettling atmosphere of the story...I wanted more.  The film suffers from uneven acting performances, cheesy make-up and special effects (the opening scene is disturbing, but not so indelible that I will be scarred forever...the latter witch trial sequence is carnivalesque in a bad way), and the unforgettable dream sequence where the lead actress and shop owner are walking by the creek then he....well, watch it and see how much laughter comes out of you!

Buy it for the second film....only!",1256256000,3,1101,5.038461538461538
7887788,3,6305307172,"I have to say while watching the Boogeyman, I did laugh at the murders. It is almost as if they were intended to be funny. However, I am not going to say this was terrible. The storyline was really unique. The broken mirror shining on the teens across the lake is way out there and over the top. Yes, it terribly acted and directed. But unique.
The Devonsville Terror was better acted and directed. I found this one intriguing and interesting to watch. A much better film. All in all, worthy of a purchase at least for the drive-in feel of the movies.",1197849600,3,551,4.359223300970874
7887789,1,6305307172,This movie had me rolling on the floor laughing at how bad it was (Boogeyman).  The story seems like it was made up by a 10 year old kid and the acting seems like it was directed by a 10 year old kid. A haunted mirror?!?! Sorry that would never put chills down my spine no matter how the story is spun.  In one scene some members of the family are walking through a barn in the middle of the night and see some of their relatives dead and hung. What do they do? scream? run? cry? nope they move deeper in the barn without even pausing.  HORRIBLE MOVIE!,1159833600,2,552,4.045871559633028
7887790,3,6305307172,"I watched this DVD because I wanted to see Boogey Man. When I saw that Devonsville Terror was on the same DVD I was like whatever. Well, to my surprise Devonsville Terror was much better than Boogey Man.

Boogey Man gets 1 star if any. Actually started out OK, but the whole possesed mirror was lame and ruined the movie. Also, the death scene of the teenagers in the car was stupid. A guy has a knife go through the back of his head and is sticking out of his mouth like 2 inches. That two inches of knife goes into his girlfriend's mouth and kills her? Made it look like a kiss. Very lame.

The Devonsville Terror I'd give 2 1/2 to 3 stars. Has an interesting story about witch trials and how they come back to haunt the townspeople 300 years later. Definitely some slowness in between, but I always like Donald Pleasence flicks for some reason. He makes them more entertaining. Some good gore in the end. Now I know where Raiders of the Lost Ark got the idea for melting faces - yuck!",1122854400,3,987,4.2727272727272725
7887791,3,6305307172,"This is a lame ripoff of ""Halloween"" but horror buffs should still enjoy it for the trademark late 70s-early 80s awfulness in the horror genre.",1092096000,4,143,4.76
