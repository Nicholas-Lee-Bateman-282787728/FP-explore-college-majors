6877248,5,B00QNUEZZC,"The orchestra adds so much to his show. So effing Rock is great, but this is his best. There are songs on here which don't appear on s.f.r., so good enough reason to get it, but once you listen to this one, you'll have a hard time going back to s.f.r.",1448150400,,251,3.9411764705882355

6877252,5,B00QNUEZZC,"...Finallly....I have owned a non USA region dvd of this show for years and although i have an altered player the sound and video have never quite synched up.....love, love, love that this is available.

6877255,5,B00QNUEZZC,"I saw the abbreviated version of this DVD on cable TV some months back and have been eagerly awaiting the release of this DVD.  If you like snarky humor coupled with music that doesn't get trapped in your head in a bad way, then you must see this performance.  We liked it so much, we purchased the CD in advance of the DVD.

6877256,5,B00QNUEZZC,There is no performer/song writer quite like Tim Minchin. This particular performance is exceptional. I adore him and his unusual humor.,1424217600,,136,5.523809523809524

6877258,5,B00QNUEZZC,"Tim minchin is fantastic. His and the orchestras performance were great. Amazon's captions were unusable. They were completely off by upwards of 15 seconds at times.

Also Amazon could not stream consistently. Going from Netflix to Amazon, it's really noticeable. It would stop to buffer constantly. We have crazy fast internet, so wasn't that",1467849600,,343,5.351851851851852
6877259,5,B00QNUEZZC,"Can't say enough about this concert. Minchin is on his game and plays well with the Heritage Orchestra. Lots of fun. If you're a Minchin fan, you'll get most of your faves. If you've never heard of him, you're in for a treat. Warning: Some adult content.",1466812800,,254,4.425531914893617
6877260,5,B00QNUEZZC,"Tim Minchin is hilarious, smart and witty in his comedy and his musical satire.  Definitely worth owning this piece of his performance art.",1464739200,,139,5.043478260869565

6877265,5,B00QNUEZZC,"This is not for the faint of heart or the easily offended, but if you love music, cleverness and fun, this is your show. I truly think Tim Minchin is some kind of genius from song-writing to showmanship, and to see him translate his shows into one big arena orchestra show is a wonderful culmination of his work so far.",1455753600,,319,4.333333333333333
6877266,5,B00QNUEZZC,"My daughter talked me to watching Californication.  I instantly fell in love with Atticus Fetch...that lead me to Tim Minchin.  This man is talented, funny, intelligent and takes snarky to a new level.  He is a rare gem in the entertainment world!  I also bought his other DVDs which are equally as amazing!",1450310400,,307,4.735849056603773
6877267,5,B00QNUEZZC,Tim Minchin has TALENT!,1449532800,,23,5.0
8692204,5,B00QNUEZZC,"Tim Minchin is wonderfully unique. He's utterly hilarious, irreverent and intelligent, and infinitely loaded with heart. He is also packed with energy and immensely talented as a pianist. In short, there is nothing not to like about this guy.

However, if you are overly sensitive to obscenities and vulgar indulgences, then you might not like Minchin at all. But he's worth giving a chance. Myself, I'm not crazy about comedians who gratuitously push the envelope on what's commonly considered ""decent""; but Minchin doesn't do that. There is always something meaningful behind his act, something deeper than mere shock value and comic veneer. This guy is very decent. Very very decent. In my view, he's a true artist, and mind-blowingly thought-provoking.

Of course, he's fun too! And a highly clever wordsmith.

I would love to see Rock n' Roll Nerd, a documentary on him that has been released in Australia, but isn't on Region 1. Please, somebody, release this to the States!",1528588800,,980,5.074534161490683
8692205,5,B00QNUEZZC,"What a nut job and very talented individual. I loved it. Be forewarned about the vulgar language in the lyrics of most of his songs. He is an awesome musician. He will offend christian conservatives with his religious views. If you can't overlook that fact , then this dvd is not for you.",1527379200,,288,4.452830188679245
8692206,5,B00QNUEZZC,What a show! Highly recommended.,1524873600,,32,5.6
8692207,5,B00QNUEZZC,"If you're a fan, this is wonderful. Not too much repeated from the Ready For This dvd.",1517270400,,86,4.117647058823529
8692208,5,B00QNUEZZC,"Tim Minchin is incredibly smart with amazing musical talent. He offers up a realistic approach to some serious, and some not so serious issues, in his musical comedy. Personally my husband and I loved this comedy. We frequently reference it, and think it's perfect for our political culture. However, Minchin has very particular views on religion and challenges several religious notions. If you're religious but open minded about criticism still a great special, if you're not completely on board with challenges to some of the shortcomings of religion this is not the special for you. However, I found this special to be a welcomed dose of critical thought that challenges the status quo.",1485734400,,690,5.115044247787611

8692210,5,B00QNUEZZC,"One of the funniest and most talented people I have ever seen.  I would highly recommend to anyone with an irreverent sense of humor, and advise anyone that can't laugh at taboo topics, specifically religion, to stay away.",1477699200,,222,4.842105263157895
