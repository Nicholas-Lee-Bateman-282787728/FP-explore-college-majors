2761599,5,B000N8UXXI,I ordered the DVD titled TRUCKS featuring Hard Hat Harry.  Also included was ALL ABOUT MONSTER TRUCKS.  My 3 year old grandson loves to watch the DVD especially  ALL ABOUT MONSTER TRUCKS!!!!  He watches it over and over every day...he will watch something else for awhile and soon he is asking for Monster Trucks again.,1320192000,,319,4.745454545454545
2761600,5,B000N8UXXI,"My nephew watch's it over and over and over, he can't get enough of it. He loves the Monster Trucks.",1316304000,,100,4.05
2761601,5,B000N8UXXI,My child loves this video.  Thanks for making a nice way for kids to learn about big trucks...,1256601600,,94,4.222222222222222
2761602,1,B000N8UXXI,By far one of the worst DVD for children I have ever watched.  The acting is horrible. There is way too much dialoge for a children under 3 years of age.,1250812800,2,153,3.935483870967742
2761603,5,B000N8UXXI,"My 18 month old has been watching this many times a week for 5 months now, (he's now 22 months old).  It's not entertaining for adults but the kids that have watched this with him seem to love it.  It's educational (about trucks and monster trucks at least).  It's very inexpensive for a video and because it has two to choose from, I think it's well worth it.",1247270400,,360,4.264705882352941
2761604,5,B000N8UXXI,"Even though it is cheesey, my grandson loves this dvd. I have to order another one as he wants a copy to keep in the car. I bought it for him when he was 2  1/2 and at 4 he still isn't tired of it. He loves the songs and knows all the words. I bought all the ""All About"" dvds and this is his favorite.  Would definately recommend this video.",1241136000,,341,3.788732394366197
2761605,1,B000N8UXXI,"Although my son loves this video, we watch it over and over and over, if left on the menu after the video has played, my dvd plays Hard Hat Harry pointing a hand gun at another man....  What can I do about this??",1229904000,,212,3.9302325581395348
2761606,4,B000N8UXXI,"I have to say that these are pretty cheesy videos, but my 2 year old loves them.  We have 3 different videos, but have since ordered 5 more because my little guy wants to watch the trucks trucks trucks.

The acting is horrible, but comical.  But the information is good and the amount of trucks shown is good too.  For the price, its a no-lose situation.",1216771200,,354,4.318181818181818
2761607,4,B000N8UXXI,"I got this video at Walmart and my two year old loves it!  Best $6 I ever spent!  I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't so cheesy and the Big Rig song wasn't so annoying.
Despite all of that, it is educational.  We're definitely asking Santa for a couple of ""all about"" videos for Xmas!",1196985600,,291,3.9827586206896552
2761608,3,B000N8UXXI,I've purchased six All About titles for my 2 1/2 year old. All but two are Hard Hat Harry episodes so my son is used to the silliness and bad acting. He enjoyed the Monster Truck episode and requests to watch it several times a week. He's only seen the Trucks episode once all the way through and did not like it.,1189468800,2,313,4.064516129032258
2761609,4,B000N8UXXI,"This is thebwors video I've ever seen... except for All about trains, All About Airplanes and the rest of them. But my kid loves them. So...",1396656000,,140,4.423076923076923
2761610,5,B000N8UXXI,"My son found these shows on Netflix and we watched them over and over and over...  Then they were removed.  For about a week, we listened to constant whining/complaining about wanting to watch ""Hard Hat Harry Music"".  Finally, we thought to look on Amazon.  We were hoping for instant video, but this works too.  Now he can still watch anytime he wants!",1387238400,,353,4.629032258064516
2761611,5,B000N8UXXI,"my sons love this, they have watched it many times, they ask for it over and over again, great movie",1383868800,,100,4.05
2761612,1,B000N8UXXI,"Every part of this video is amateur hour. While my two year old likes it, I don't want him to see this again.

Besides the terrible acting by Anthony Paul, the star of the show (some of the worst acting I have ever seen), and the horrible casting choices for the children co-stars, the scripting, music, lighting, locations, music, lyrics, musicians, directing, producing, sound -- is there anything left? Oh, right. The little girl playing a video game which is just a video. That just looked stupid.

OK, besides all that (I am still creeped out by Paul's mannerisms, reminding me of the stranger I never want my son to meet in a grocery store), what's wrong with the video?

I'll start with a few things:
* Kids in a massive truck without helmets
* Blindly trusting stranger
* Kids cleaning a hot truck's mufflers

Skip this even if you think your kid will like it.

2761614,4,B000N8UXXI,"My daughter is 2 and this is her favorite. The acting is horrible, the music is bad and the whole thing is very dated. But, she loves it and dances to the songs. Strangely awesome!",1369267200,2,180,4.171428571428572
2761615,5,B000N8UXXI,"My 2.5 year old son is riveted by this ghastly video. Horrible music/acting. Low budget etc. However, it gives me enough time to grab a shower so...great! It's circa 1996 (the clothing/hair indicates this, too) so very dated, too. Oh well.
Beats watching Yo Gabba Gabba 400 times.",1369267200,,280,4.854166666666667
2761616,5,B000N8UXXI,"My 3 old loves both, all about trucks and monster trucks. The trucks he loves dancing to the cheesy music in the beginning, he tells me it's time to dance and exercise. He does it also to monster trucks. I have these saved on netflix but decided to buy the video so I can send it to my in-laws for him to watch and dance. He does not know yet that my in-laws will have it but when he does he will be so excited. Lol, I don't want him to grow up yet. So I do give a five star because the videos entertain him and dances to it everytime.",1365552000,,535,3.828828828828829
2761617,4,B000N8UXXI,"Ugh, I don't even know where to start with this. My husband showed this to my little boy on Netflix one day-it was love at first site. Since then, my two year old asks to watch this multiple times a day! Sometimes 2 times in a row. Really? What does he see in this that I don't? This is sooo corny and just terrible, but my child absolutely loves it. And it isn't just the monster trucks that he loves-we've tried other monster truck shows, and they do not hold his interest like this one does. I just don't get it.",1365379200,2,515,4.108910891089109
2761618,1,B000N8UXXI,This dvd was ridiculous beyond description. It was nothing like the cover or description on the case. Old and corny,1363824000,,115,4.8
2761619,4,B000N8UXXI,"Desperate for truck dvds that would keep my little guys attention after mighty machines (too informational for these two right now) failed us, stumbled upon this.  Happy Accident!  Despite being 15 years old and a little cheesy my one little monster truck freak LOVES IT!  His brother likes it too, just doesnt love it.  Only reason I am not giving it five stars:  the DVD cover has new awesome trucks shown.  My son cant understand why ""those"" trucks aren't on the DVD.  That upsets him very much!",1358812800,,498,4.655172413793103
2761620,1,B000N8UXXI,"This video is educational, but it cannot hold my son's interest.  It needs more songs and things like that to keep kids interested.",1358640000,,131,4.695652173913044
2761621,5,B000N8UXXI,"If I bought this DVD for myself, I'd give it a one. The acting is terribly stilted, the filming is dated, the music is really cheesy.

But if my 2 1/2 year old son could type, he'd easily give it 5 stars; I'm defaulting to him. He loves this DVD because it goes well with his boyish fascination for all things truck-related ... especially monster trucks. Both videos are clean, family-friendly, and educational and provide great entertainment for the younger audience.",1352851200,2,468,4.777777777777778
2761622,3,B000N8UXXI,"Overall, my 3 year old loves these videos, and I think they are fairly educational, so I don't have a problem with that.  The one big disturbing problem that I do have with these videos is that they have young children going off with a strange adult without checking with their parents.  In this video, the young boy is looking for his father, finds hard hat harry instead and goes off with him.  Not a good message.  Otherwise, I like the videos just fine.",1347753600,8,457,4.404761904761905
2761623,1,B000N8UXXI,"Worst DVD we have ever purchased. Camera work is terrible, horrendous acting, dated, and just plain awful. We threw it out after the first 10 min.",1347321600,,146,4.653846153846154
2761624,4,B000N8UXXI,"My 2 1/2 yr old loves this movie. He got it for Christmas from his Great-Grandma. At first I rolled my eyes when we opened it, but after he was addicted to it and asks for it multiple times a week I can't thank her enough! I love that it IS slow paced. Studies show that young kids can't handle the crazy stimulation that many of the cartoons geared toward their age provide. He follows the storyline and has learned so much by watching it. He now knows so many different Trucks and is quick to point out ones he sees when we're out and about that he's seen in the movie.

His favorite is definitely the Monster Truck (mine too), but he likes them both. HHH is kind of annoying, and in the Trucks one seems a bit child-predator-ish (but at the time it was filmed it probably didn't create the red flags it does now). He is much more acceptable as a genie in the Monster Truck movie.

I plan to get a couple more of the ""All About"" movies for an upcoming plane ride. I figure they'll be at lease as entertaining as these two have been and since we're used to the goofiness of HHH that won't be anything new to overcome.",1340755200,,1118,4.171296296296297
2761625,4,B000N8UXXI,"I'm able to watch this on netflix and my 3yr old wants me to put this on daily. He loves this video but as for me I think it's awful. The acting is the worst and the filming is pretty terrible. Why give it 4 stars? Well the purpose is to keep my 3yr old entertained, and it does, he loves the monster trucks.",1340236800,,308,3.828125
2761626,4,B000N8UXXI,"My 2 1/2 year old son loves any videos with monster trucks.  So we bought this and of course he loves it.  So I really can't complain.  In the past we have bought the Real Wheels videos with Dave and Becky, ""There goes a Monster Truck"" and I like Dave and Becky much more than Hard Hat Harry BUT it's really not for me.  If your kiddo is young and loves trucks and monster trucks he/she will probably love this video.  But also try The Real Wheels version - they are cheap and well worth it:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Real-Wheels-Mega-Truck-Adventures/dp/B00008DZ7Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Real Wheels - Mega Truck Adventures</a>",1332633600,,681,5.509615384615385
2761627,5,B000N8UXXI,"This movie is so cheesy, however my 20 month old can't get enough! The acting is so bad that it actually makes it fun. I've read that ""live action"" is better for young children then animation, so I'm excited this is able to keep his attention; plus it's educational ... so it could be worse! We watch it every night while getting ready for bedtime; the more you watch it, the more you'll make fun of it, which makes it more fun!",1322784000,,428,4.2317073170731705
2761628,5,B000N8UXXI,"This is an excellent DVD! My 2 year old loves this, he goes back and forth between the truck show and monster trucks. This will keep him entertained ALL day!
