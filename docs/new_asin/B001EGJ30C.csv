3553989,5,B001EGJ30C,"My oldest watched this series as a child. It is no longer on TV for my younger childen to enjoy. It is the sweetest series teaching good wholesome values, as well as love and respect for nature. A welcome relief from all that violence and action packed nonsense which is so prevelent most TV stations today.",1231718400,8,307,4.5
3553990,5,B001EGJ30C,"This was a very well packaged and produced DVD set that includes all the episodes we may remember watching on Nickelodeon way back in the day.  I did not play with the language features, but the menus are easy, the sound and picture are crisp, and the packaging remarkably tough.  Recommend it for anybody who is looking to buy a copy of David the Gnome.",1230422400,8,354,4.430769230769231
3553991,5,B001EGJ30C,This product was great. It came well before the allotted time and in great condition. Would order from seller again.,1229385600,3,116,4.85
3553992,5,B001EGJ30C,"this is a great animated show i really enjoyed it as a kid, it had good plots and it was entertaining this is one of those shows that had been forgotten",1228003200,3,152,3.935483870967742
3553993,5,B001EGJ30C,Exactly what I wanted and ordered for my daughter and my grandsons. My daughter actually ordered this since she grew up watching it.,1373068800,,132,4.782608695652174
3553994,4,B001EGJ30C,"I bought this product for my brother because we both loved David the Gnome as children. I was so excited to finally find it on DVD. The cartoon quality was lower than I remember, and the shows a little cornier, but still a great choice for travelling down memory lane!",1361059200,,268,4.38
3553995,5,B001EGJ30C,"I saw this show on Nick Jr, while I was still a kid.  I was happy to see it on DVD.  So now, I can watch the episodes I've enjoyed again.",1357516800,,137,3.3870967741935485
3553996,5,B001EGJ30C,I miss this show I found it by accident and had to buy it for my sister brings back a lot of memories,1356393600,,101,3.4347826086956523
3553997,4,B001EGJ30C,"This came really quick! Great memories from when I was a child, hope the children like it as much as I did :)",1355702400,,109,3.782608695652174
3553998,5,B001EGJ30C,Good classic cartoon that I remembered as a child.  I bought this collection for my daughter to watch.  She loves it.,1354665600,,117,4.523809523809524
3553999,2,B001EGJ30C,"The DVDs are in a nice case and everything plays well, but I definitely did NOT enjoy the series as much as I thought I had back when my children were little.  It is wall to wall ecological sermonizing right down to the closing line about us being welcome to visit as long as we share their views.  It pretty much states that they (the writers, speaking through the gnomes) are trying to get to children while they are young (and innocent) to convince them that nature is good and man is bad - discussing air pollution and water pollution and ""noisy"" hunters shooting guns at every creature in the forest.

I am really disappointed - I had wanted to introduce this series to my grandchildren and wean them from Curious George, but after a couple of these episodes I would rather watch Curious George!  I wonder if the original book had that much ecological crap in it?  Gnomes are such a cute concept and it could have been a lovely series - which is the way I thought I remembered it - instead it's just more brainwashing.

I wish these tree-hugging programs came with a warning label.  And they need to get real instead of animated.  If nature needs protected then show it how it really is - show that animals don't worry about healthy trees or clean water, and they are perfectly happy to eat each other. Don't try to convince kiddies that foxes will give you a ride through the forest instead of trying to eat you (if you are small enough - like David the Gnome) or that geese could fly carrying a cast-iron cauldron. Show how poor and hungry people are in areas where there is little or no access to irrigation, farm equipment, or pesticides, and the wildlife are allowed to stampede in and tear up the meager fields the people had managed to plant.  Yes, there are extremes - places where people used too much fertilizer or pesticide - and places where people have starved from not having any fertilizer or pesticides. There are places were animals have died from pesticides and places where pests have killed many, many people and have virtually taken over and run the remaining people out. I'm not saying that the reality of our world would be a good children's program, but neither are these animated tree-hugging sermons.

Bottom line, don't buy it unless you are actually trying to brainwash the children in your life to fall in line with the hype that humans are bad and ""nature"" is perfect.",1343001600,,2403,4.541666666666667
3554000,1,B001EGJ30C,I agree with a previous review. These are not authentic. Just opening the box they came in I noticed how the photo insert for the DVD set was crooked. I decided to send them back before the plastic seal was even broken. Don't waste $50 on it.,1335312000,,242,4.170212765957447
3554001,5,B001EGJ30C,"Some of the above reviews have no idea what they are talking about because they are ignorant. The reason the titles are different is because nickelodeon did not produce this series, they just bought the rights to run it and changed the titles and intro. This series did not originate in America. Having said that, it's the same series we grew up with as kids in America. Enjoy

""In every wish and dream and happy home, you will find a kingdom of the Gnomes. """,1335052800,4,459,4.4
3554002,5,B001EGJ30C,"Not the same intro I remember, picture flickers a bit. However, good picture sharpness and sound; packaging seemed to be sturdy and sound quality was good. No audio options for other languages. But, I would buy this again.",1318809600,,222,4.868421052631579
3554003,5,B001EGJ30C,"The quality of the picture is about normal for when it aired, it's by no means true DVD quality for the picture. The packaging is excellent and the series is better than I remembered. It's a great show that teaches kids how important it is to respect nature. I'll admit I was worried that the theme song doesn't play at the start of each episode, as nothing brings back the memories of childhood better than a well thought out theme song, but the menu structure itself has the theme song playing so I didn't feel like I was missing it at all. All in all an excellent product.",1294358400,,575,4.333333333333333
3554004,4,B001EGJ30C,"I loved this show as a child, and I was ecstatic to find the series on DVD.  Though a little dated in one or two ideals, ""David the Gnome"" is a wonderful cartoon for children, and helps you teach them good morals.  The set even includes an episode of ""Dogtanian""!

My only complaints about this DVD set is that the song accompanying the end credits has been changed, and the montage accompanying the intro music has been changed.  Why was this necessary?  The song accompanying the end credits is supposed to be a musical version of the intro; I always loved listening to it.  If anyone wants to hear what the original sounded like, or what the original montage looked like, you can always find it on youtube.  This way you know what your children are missing out on.",1293926400,2,767,4.474820143884892
3554005,5,B001EGJ30C,"My children have loved this DVD.  I remember my sister watching it when we were younger and as I threw a gnome party for my youngest, this was perfect entertainment while we were getting the food set up.  Always good lessons to learn, bright colors and lots and lots of episodes.  I am letting my 4 year old watch it, but there are a few episodes I might deem ""scary"" that include witches and magic, but my 4 year old is pretty grounded and is a middle child so she's been fine...sometimes I just fast forward those episodes.  Anyway, great show, definitely give it 5 stars...just fast forward a couple episodes if your little one scares easily.",1288310400,,645,4.487179487179487
3554006,5,B001EGJ30C,"I love buying DVDs of shows I used to watch as a child.  I watch them with my kids and it brings me such good memories.  This was one of my favorite shows as a kid and it hasn't lost any of its charm over time.  It teaches good values, love for nature, and respect for the earth.  All the epesodes I remember are on this set.",1287360000,2,325,3.8059701492537314
3554007,5,B001EGJ30C,"I just ordered this set, and I'm super excited because I love David the Gnome!!  But I am skeptical that I will even receive this set.  Has anybody else ordered from LancerVision?  Have you received your set yet?

I'm sure this is a bootleg set, but I don't really care as long as I get to watch this awesome series.  :)

Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Excellent service, the packaging is gorgeous.  I am thrilled with my set.  :)

This is such a sweet series, I heartily recommend purchasing it.",1274227200,,514,4.549450549450549
3554008,1,B001EGJ30C,"This is not an official DVD collection. It is a fake. So if you enjoy the show enough to put up with the faults of a fake DVD (incorrect information, no episode select, etc.) the feel free to buy this set. But by buying this set you are further diminishing the chances of an official REAL DVD collection of this show coming into existence.",1273795200,21,339,4.3125
3554009,5,B001EGJ30C,"This was one of my favorite shows from when I was a kid. Now that I have the DVD, I can share the show with my niece. There are 3 DVD's and each is made to run with 9 episodes airing back to back as a movie. The quality is very good.",1272931200,3,233,3.5
3554010,5,B001EGJ30C,I got this for my two year old nephew to watch. I used to watch this as a kid and really enjoyed it. My nephew loves this almost as much as I did and still do. It makes you appreciate nature and animals and shows the damage that we have done throughout the years to nature and animals. But it also shows that humans and animals can live in harmony. The trolls in the show are pretty funny too. I would highly recommend this cartoon for any parent that is looking for a TV show with good strong values. Not like the TV shows of today which shows characters hitting each other left and right and making stupid comments that make no sense at all. I wish they would bring back more cartoons like David the Gnome for new generations to see and enjoy. Maybe if they had more of these kind of shows the world wouldn't be so crazy and scary to live in.,1260403200,3,844,4.121212121212121
3554011,4,B001EGJ30C,"There are 2 complaints I have with this set. One, the episode titles are not the same titles as what were originally aired on Nickelodeon, however they are the same episodes, just different titles for some reason. The other complaint I have is that the episodes only come in the movie format. Basically this means that the episodes play back to back without the show's introduction. When you hit play movie, it does show an into on the first episode of each disc with the original song, however the intro is NOT the same as it was on Nickelodeon, which bothers me a bit. You can watch the episodes individually as well, but when you select that option, no intro is shown at all.

However, the set does contain all the episodes I love and remember. The set does have good picture and sound, and my few complaints I have with the set are not enough to suggest not buying it.",1244332800,38,872,4.416149068322981
3554012,4,B001EGJ30C,"Reminds me of eating spagettios in front of the tv when I wasn't a crusty ol' 25 year old - I bought this for my future kids, but I'll admit I enjoy it too.

Actually, this series contains researched information about nature, and provides a look at a simpler life most children don't get to see very often.  If you're a little fed up with 7 year olds carrying cell phones and ipods, get them to watch this.

The dvd set is well packaged and sturdy.",1239840000,13,448,4.186046511627907
8298064,5,B001EGJ30C,I bought this for nostalgia purposes but found out that they have all the episodes for free on Amazon Prime. Sad Panda.,1461283200,,119,4.454545454545454
