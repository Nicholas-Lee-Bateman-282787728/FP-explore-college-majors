8289533,5,B001CU7XZC,"I don't have cable; I discoved this series through a certain red-envelope service.  I find the whole series eye-opening, informative, and entertaining.  I've seen several seasons now and this episode is one of my favorites.

John and all his family and friends have Boston accents.  So ""hard"" becomes ""hahd.""  ""Rather"" becomes ""ratha"" and ""sweetheart"" becomes ""sweethaht.""  If you liked ""Fargo"" due to the Minnesota accents, then you'll be entertained here.

This particular episode touches upon those who handle death poorly.  Several deaths, particularly in succession, is what feeds John's habits.  He especially mourns for his heterosexual life partner Paulie.  You can tell that John and Paulie were like Oprah and Gayle.  It's touching to see, really.

At one point, John starts fighting physically with a friend.  His friend has a nice hairy torso and nice upper arms.  John loses his shirt and you get to see his cuddly belly, porcelain skin, and lightly-sprinkled chest hair.  This thing about ""Intervention"" is: well, some of the addicts and their male relatives are hot!  Drugs and alcohol haven't deprived them of their pulchritude.  Watching John and his buddy in fisticuffs reminded me of the last scene in the Pet Shop Boys' video ""Domino Dancing.""

This has a positive ending too.  If you see any episode, make sure to peep this one.  I wish I could add John to my facebook list.  He's swell!",1293235200,,1408,5.034782608695652
