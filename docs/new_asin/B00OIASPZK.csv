6751704,5,B00OIASPZK,"(This review is 99.44 % spoiler free! for those who care.)

With The Big Driver we get an outstanding, well-made made for TV movie based on a short work from one of the Wicked Good State of Maine's favorite sons, Stephen King.

WG Behind the Camera Stuff:

Camera work excellent: All shots were perfectly placed, framed, and dramatically lit so our attention was always focused.  Edits kept a sense of flow smooth and moments of tension were cut to perfection.

""Come and Get It"" will never mean quite the same again after this movie.

And the word ""tasteful"" might actually precede  ""sexual assault"" to describe BD's muted depiction of a vile crime--a juxtaposition I previously thought, and that is in reality, impossible.

Soundtrack impressive and varied to capture different moods through both style and instrumentation. Bubble gum to edgy electronics--hear it here and hear it done well.

Direction thought out and assured. BD was impressively cast: all actors were engaging, clearly developed, and evidenced depth; some of the credit for that level of excellence must go to Mikael Salomon as the director.

The full dramatic arc of BD was clear in Salomon's mind because it was clearly on the screen.

WG Cast:

2001's HAL has a new friend, Tom the GPS. He/it was wise, chatty, tender, philosophic, and emotionally supportive.

Ann Dowd plays the perfect book circle organizer: When Tess tells her ""...Never criticize a writer..."" we know what will happen next and want to see it.

Joan Jett plays tough skinned deeply injured soul who perfectly voices a necessary and valid judgment at just the right time.  She expresses our feelings in her lines in that scene.

Olympia Dukakis plays the Sewing Circle Sleuths leader and is pitch perfect.  Affirming, consoling, motivating, warning and then wittily summing up the revenge, Dukakis is brilliant.

Will Harris is good. I mean if you stepped on his character, you'd scrape your shoes for five minutes good. Christoph Waltz is the go to actor to play a swine now. But Harris is good enough to pick up the slack since male rotters are much in vogue and Waltz can't play them all.

Maria Bello brings everything that could be in Tess out:

Happy and sunny.
Gracious and accommodating.
Fearful of being mocked as a victim.
Thirsting for vengeance.
Deeply afraid of being caught.

Adjectives alone are used because verbs would only lead to spoilers.

WG the Writers:

The screenplay of BD was that perfect dramatic pyramid we all learned about in high school.

Original Story: not read by this reviewer but it's by King who we'd agree knows a bit about psychological terror.

WG TV Series Recommendations:

One used delightful baddies, great dialogue, and a wonderful cast (Justified).

The other gave thrills beyond relief, fully visualized images from a monster's mind, and brilliant stylized and controlled performances the like we have never seen until now (Hannibal).

We only see a golden age in retrospect.

But we might be in a silver age of TV productions that match the best of the ""B"" movies that studios once cranked out because they had the casts, crews, scripts, directors, and producers there, all well skilled in their jobs and ready to work, and an audience ready to be entertained.

Big Driver, Justified, and Hannibal are outstanding entertainments that thanks to DVDs we won't rue missing,as we did silver screen pleasures.  Now we can enjoy them whenever we wish.

Enjoy.",1414454400,11,3444,4.956369982547993
6751705,4,B00OIASPZK,"Stephen King's stark revenge tale - first published in his 2010 collection FULL DARK, NO STARS - made itself at home on Lifetime last weekend, making this my earliest annual pilgrimage to the channel (usually, I drop by for Lifetime's batch of holiday movies). Except BIG DRIVER is no holiday movie. It presents seriously disturbing scenes, so steel yourself. After all, it's Stephen King, him what collects his jollies by making people squirm.

It's not the first time he's featured a writer as his protagonist. He's done this in MISERY, THE SHINING, THE DARK HALF, and in the novella ""Secret Window, Secret Garden"" (from FOUR PAST MIDNIGHT). Maria Bello - who co-starred in the film adaptation of ""Secret Window, Secret Garden"" - is front and center as Tess Thorne, author of a popular series of cozy mysteries revolving around an old lady quartet of knitters and crime solvers. Early on we do get a shade of foreshadowing that there's something just a bit off about Tess, a casual remark from her during a phone conversation about the voices in her head.

Tess Thorne is enroute to a library book club in Chicopee, Massachusetts for a speaking engagement. And while not for one second do I believe that Interstate 84 is as diabolical as the 405 Freeway, it's apparently aggravating enough that Tess, heading home, happily follows directions for an alternate route provided by the book club hostess (Ann Dowd).

But you know what happens when you take a shortcut. Debris strewn on a remote backroad impedes Tess's commute and what happens next leaves her horribly damaged and left for dead in a drainage ditch. BIG DRIVER is a harrowing exploitation film, and it's not for everyone. As mentioned, there are moments that are very hard to watch. What's undeniable is that Maria Bello turns in a stunning performance, I would even say a tour-de-force performance. Much of the film plays out like a one-character study. The movie adaptation can't dig as deeply as did its source material. Still, there's painful exploration into the horrors of violation and the shattering trauma inflicted on the victim's psyche. Maria Bello is unflinching in her portrayal of her character as brittle and unglamorous and, at times, unsympathetic.

As in the novella, after the horrifying gut punch and after Tess wrestles with what's happened and what she ought to now do - Should she alert the authorities? Okay, but what of the stigma and public shame sure to follow? - the film allows us this near visceral satisfaction as we see Tess finally go about getting even. And this is where Tess's imagination and capacity as a murder mystery writer come into play, and where the demarcation between fantasy and reality gets blurry. King's novella was so good and creepy at depicting Tess's inner world. In the movie, the voices in her head give her counsel and manifest as her fictional knitting sleuths, as various corpses, and as her Prius' caring GPS device (she calls her GPS ""Tom""). And apropos of King's macabre humor, at one point, Tom confesses to Tess: ""I'd be lost without you."" Heh. That's the most fascinating bit about this story, how Tess's subconscious helps her not get caught. To reiterate, BIG DRIVER isn't for everyone. You, dear viewer, will have to go thru hard-to-stomach stuff before you get to the pay off moments. But if you jump on, you're in for a remarkable, devastating turn from Maria Bello and fantastic support from Ann Dowd, Olympia Dukakis (as one of the knitting sleuths), and from rocker Joan Jett who's in for a moment as a bartender who points Tess in the right direction. If you can take it, see it.",1414281600,13,3618,4.840064620355412

During the summer time , I seldom can bring myself to mow the lawn. It's just not something I enjoy doing. Getting all sweaty and sun burnt.

But this movie, adapted from a Stephen King novella, cured me of my insatiable appetite to...uh...NOT mow the lawn.
After watching ""Big Driver"" once I said to myself ""Well, I may not be driving 14 miles just so I can pull into the parking lot of a furniture store, and abruptly exiting my vehicle so that I might awkwardly attempt purchasing 4 gumballs from the gumball machine in the lobby of said store while their employees try to steer me towards buying a new sofa and love seat. But...I am definitely going to keep this lawn mowed, from now on. ""

He's done it again with ""Big Driver"".  I loved it.  He seemingly moved into the revenge genre like Quentin Tarantino with this gem.  All 5 stars.  Great acting performances...a solid script...and the settings were perfect.  When it comes to King's written works being placed on film, it just gets better and better.  I never give away plots or twists and turns.  If you like to fasten your seat belts on a thrill ride, this one is for you...just like all of Stephen's offerings.  I'd love to meet this man for 5 seconds and just say...""Thank you!""  Nothing more.  He has filled hours of my life with novels and films and I still have so many more to read and watch.  ""Big Driver"" is intense and soul-searching...another one of those ""What would you do?"" films.  Thank you Mr. King!

Where monster's , ghost & other strange horror had been Stephen Kings bread & butter for many years we can easily disconnect  from the horror of unreal & imagined creature feature type horror. Mr. King has been moving more into the direction of the truly horrific world of the psychopath writing about murder & rape & serial killers this is the most horrifying of all because it is possible. No this type of horror is not just possible but has been a part of the human condition since recorded history!  Just imagine through the course of your life time how many times you have been only feet away from a real true life ""Big Driver"" in the grocery store or Wal-Mart? Stephen King is now writing story's that will fill the mind with monster's that are not so easily dismissed! The next stormy night you will not fear the fanged clown's , Werewolf's or Vampires, but a simple knock on your door & a stranger asking for help. Your mind will  ask is this a set up? do I dare let this person in? Are they going to kill me?",1426118400,5,1165,4.429906542056075

6751815,5,B00OIASPZK,"Just re-read the Stephen King story, then saw the movie.  Very good acting by everyone.  The movie faithfully follows the book, capturing the fear, anguish and suffering of the protagonist (like several of King's, a writer) and the revenge she exacts at the conclusion.",1424044800,,269,5.090909090909091
6751816,3,B00OIASPZK,"Pop mystery writer Tess Thorne (Maria Bello) gets set, raped and left for dead on a New England back road. With the help of her imaginary friends she enacts revenge.

The film was predictable. I kept waiting for a twist or that Stephen King moment and it wasn't there. The whole film was easy to figure out once she got the short cut. This was hack writing and the second King film (A Good Marriage) I have seen in a row that was not up to speed. Acting was okay, but the film didn't entertain me.  Lacked intensity. Overrated due to the Stephen King name.

Guide: Rape. No nudity or F-bombs.",1423699200,,592,4.315315315315315
6751817,4,B00OIASPZK,"Pretty good adaption from Kings short story. From what I remember, it all seems there from the book. The rape scene was pretty disturbing and in fact, very difficult to watch. I guess that's the point though of this revenge flick.",1423526400,,230,4.634146341463414
6751818,4,B00OIASPZK,"Thats not an outstanding film, but it is well-built and well-conducted. It is faithful to the original story and it reveals some of the worst evils ordinary people carry in their frightened souls, the dark sides of their souls. Just say, mister, what are these frightful and frightening things?

First of all our robotized cars. Before we were afraid, and Stephen King loved that fear of ours, of the car itself and the evil that could live in it, the way it lived in Christine. Now the car is nothing at all. The car is inhabited by a GPS, that simple and daily version of the mad computer of Stanley Kubricks 2001, the Space Odyssey and that GPS has a masculine identity, in this film, whereas the car is necessarily a female symbol since it can contain us the way a cocoon or a womb would. It is the voice of the father inside the mothers womb. That is reassuring up to a point, up to the point when someone from outside manipulates the GPS and turns it into a trap.

And that one is a woman. All evil comes from a woman, the eternal Eve, who manipulates a man, here the poor Tom the GPS. Thats already very frightening. This woman is the conspirator, the serial killer you imagine most of the time as being a man. But this woman is even worse than that because she is a mother.

The eternal Eve needs a serpent to put her on the road to evil, and that serpent is a two-headed one since it is a pair of brothers. That cuts deep into us, right through to the bone, or maybe even to the marrow in the bone. Two brothers unified in their crime. Thats really ugly, but two sons who, unified in their crime, are both manipulating their mother and manipulated by their mother, and they have to pay for the passage and give their mother some trinket, some trophy, some souvenir from the victims she sends them for their fun.

That is becoming blood curdling to anyone sane in their minds. But the film adds a few details that imply we are all living with a deep secret in our own memory, a big secret from infancy that is both motivating us and manipulating our own motivations. We are the puppet of the traumas, big or small, we experienced, then registered in our infancy and childhood, at times teenage, and that we yet buried deep in our unconscious or subconscious, and little is needed for it to come up and make us do the most horrific things or just fail in our most desired and dearest dreams.

The film then works very well even if it does not insist on the numerous details King gave us in this story, since he is such a meticulous writer. The reader then cannot ignore the most intimate details of the characters like the brand names of their underwear or the color of their bathrobes. And that is no metaphor at all. Some writers consider the truth of the story is in such details. I would agree for sure and at the same time agree to disagree: some details are at times there just to have some gross effect on us and I do not exactly appreciate grossness. I prefer horror and terror.

6751819,5,B00OIASPZK,this movie is great but dark if you know what I mean there were times when they talked a lot and I said omg.this is boring but I kept watching since I ordered it saying its a Stephen King film it has to be good and it was great you have to really pay attention.,1423353600,,261,3.7636363636363637

6751821,4,B00OIASPZK,"It's a made for TV Lifetime movie, so I was not expecting it to be very good at all, but being a big Stephen King fan I knew I had to check it out. It is much more graphic than anything ever shown on that network I'm sure, though the only other movie I've seen on Lifetime is Lizzie Borden. Maria Bello is great in this. Without her acting talents this would be decent at best. She really elevates the material. Big Driver is dark and disturbing and worth a watch for King or revenge thriller fans.",1422748800,9,498,4.144329896907217

6751824,1,B00OIASPZK,"OMG. Are you kidding me?! I rented it at Redbox but it reeked of ""Lifetime"". Except this Lifetime movie was so terrible it almost seemed like it was written, directed and produced by an intern at Lifetime. Is Stephen King is riding on the coattails of his name? Weak, contrived plot. Stupid plastic characters. The raped woman hears ""voices"". Her Tom-Tom speaks to her. Wow...Creepy...
Really...This raped woman, a famous author, buys a gun, I assume in HER name, kills 3 people responsible for her rape with said gun and thinks that running back to the rape scene for her cell phone will clean up all evidence of her murders?? WTF?
Please. Just watch an episode of DEXTER instead.
Or..watch this movie if you want to feel as raped as the main character.",1422489600,2,754,4.676691729323308
6751825,3,B00OIASPZK,"""I'll let the cops know but not tonight. All I know is if I see him again I'll kill him."" Tess Thorne (Bello) is a famous mystery writer who is invited to speak to a group of fans. On her way back home she blows a tire. When someone stops to help her she is relieved but that turns to fear. After she is knocked out she wakes up to him raping and beating her then he leaves her for dead. She manages to escape and return home. Rather than calling the cops she decides to investigate on her own. She starts off on her quest for revenge. First thing I have to say is that this movie actually wasn't that bad at all...for a Lifetime movie. I wasn't sure how they could convert a Stephen King book into a Lifetime movie and I will admit that they did a pretty good job and Maria Bello does a pretty good job. Much like the Lizze Borden movie they did with Christina Ricci it wasn't that bad...but again...not that bad for a Lifetime movie. Overall, defiantly felt like a made for TV movie but I have seen worse. I give it a B-.",1415145600,10,1023,4.069306930693069
