8134658,5,B000GUFC16,"This is one of my favorite childhood cartoons! I enjoyed every minute watching it. The cartoon DVD doesn't have English subtitles, but I don't think it makes a problem watching it, since there isn't much talk in the cartoon - like in ""Tom and Jerry"" you can guess what's happening without a translation. I used to always laugh at the two little mice in the cartoon who play tricks on a good friendly cat Leopold, but eventually get trapped themselves in their tricks, and sometimes felt bad for them though they're not pictured as positive characters. It's a good cartoon to watch for kids and for adults (who like cartoons) because though it's funny it has a morale in it that everyone should be friendly and live in peace!",1274054400,3,724,4.62015503875969
