. I regret spending money on this DVD junk. It gets a ZERO!",1519430400,,221,4.285714285714286

8388090,5,B0033W8C8Y,"Having been a fan of the local ren faire for years, seeing a documentary of the founding of the faire phenomenon and seeing the roots and people involved in creating my favorite pastime, it was a remarkable and very moving experience viewing this dvd. Seeing the highs and lows of the original group, the backstage camaraderie, and progression from single weekend event to the lifestyle it has become, I am even more proud of my decision for a more hands-on faire experience as my own character in a current cast. I plan to buy more copies for my faire family.",1400112000,,560,4.61
8388091,5,B0033W8C8Y,"A tremendous view into the magical world of Ren Faire.  Watching this doc, I felt like a true insider learning all about the colorful history of Renaissance Fairs.  The people, traditions and  beauty all unfold on screen in this amazing film.  This is the second documentary from Doug Jacobson and again (as in Journey to the Flames) he has gained unprecedented access to a unique event and brought it to life on screen for all to enjoy.",1313452800,,437,4.636363636363637
8388092,5,B0033W8C8Y,"How wonderful to hear the stories of the artists who created this popular, American-summer-pastime.  Mr. Jacobson does a great job of documenting and pulling all their tails together.  It's fun and entertaining.  I can smell the turkey-legs.  A must-see for any lover of the Renaissance Faire.",1312329600,,293,5.304347826086956
8388093,5,B0033W8C8Y,"This is not a topic that I knew that much about so I was surprised to find it so interesting.  Good music, well filmed and a told a real story.",1311638400,,143,3.7666666666666666
8388094,5,B0033W8C8Y,The Renfair is a magical place a person can go and be a part of a community that is outside of the realms of his or her day-to -day life.  I remember going when I was in high school and watching it transform slowly through the years I was in college and after.  Doug Jacobson has a rare inside look into the very center of this far reaching phenomenon and has captured it in a beautiful documentary.  For anyone who is interested in the transformation and history of a soul-inspiring spectacle I highly recommend this colorful film!,1310601600,,532,4.463917525773196
8388095,5,B0033W8C8Y,"I went to the faire in the 1970's and had no idea what was going on that made it all that it was.  This comprehensive documentary was awesome.  If you want to know the history, what is happening behind the curtain and where the Faire is now...see this documentary!",1310342400,,264,4.36734693877551
8388096,5,B0033W8C8Y,"Wow, i learned so much this was great and done so well. I have given this as a gift to several of my friends that attend the Renaissance Faire. I think this is the most insightful movie I have seen about this subject. Doug Jacobson is a master at capturing the essence of this event. I applaud Doug once again for an interesting and creative movie. Tony Ghiselli",1310169600,,362,4.338235294117647
