949561,4,630502118X,"""Hamsun"" (1996) is directed by Jan Troell (The Emigrants, The Flight of the Eagle). The film is about the later life of Norwegian  Nobel prize author Knut Hamsun (Max von Sydow) who supported the Nazi cause during World War II along with his wife Marie  (Ghita Norby). The strong love hate relationship between Knut and his wife play off of their growing isolation from their community in Norway given their unpopular support of Germany during the war. Explanations are given about how Knut's Norwegian nationalistic opinions and misinformed views would lead him to see Hitler and his cause as just in light of English Imperialism and the threat of Russian communism.

Knut Hamsun's view of the strong, almost mystical bond between mankind and nature, which are exemplified in his novels ""Pan"", and ""Growth of the Soil"", come through in the beautiful natural images that frequent the film. At times I was reminded of other directors, like the Russian film director Tarkovsky, or the American director Terrance Malick, and their filming of the relationship between humanity and nature. Combined with the often haunting film score of Arvo Part this solemn and tragic story still manages to pull through a positive message about human dignity, the bonds of family, while exploring the turns of fortune and legacy.

The dvd comes with a few special features, including cast, crew, and author biographies, and a photo gallery. The dvd itself is not the highest resolution one might expect, being closer to VHS quality as the image sometimes pixelates, and at times jumps ahead in spots. The movie is 5 out of 5, but the dvd is 3 out of 5.",1339632000,,1633,4.905797101449275
949562,5,630502118X,"My ignorance of Norwegian World War II history embarrasses me. I knew the term Quisling as an adjective for a traitor, and I had been aware of the heavy water project sabotage; however, I did not know who Knut Hamsun (1859-1952) was. As I watched this movie over a two day period, by coincidence, the LA Times had published a very readable book review about two recent Hamsun volumes (Tackling Knut Hamsun,<[...]) [1-2]  Thus in a very short period of 6 days I had come to realize what an important figure Hamsun was in Norwegian and world history -- and simultaneously, how shallow was my knowledge base.

This is a very sad and distressing movie about a 1920 Norwegian Nobel literature prize winner. His writings were revered in Norway and Germany. He was sympathetic to Hitler's cause, admired him and even met him in 1943. His antipathy towards Americans and the British was well known. He considered them imperialists. He felt that Norway and Germany had much in common, and that under the Nazis Norway would gain a degree of autonomous but peer status with Germany.  This was neither the case nor the intention of Hitler. Under Nazi hirelings Quisling and Terboven, Norway suffered much. There were executions and many injustices, a fate that befell all occupied citizens and their countries. In his post-war trials Hamsun alleged that he was unaware of all this, including the Holocaust, partly because this type of news was kept away from him. He also claimed that  his  deafness and blindness blocked most daily news input from him. It is also probable that he may have been just too stubborn to let in any alternative viewpoints, a protective ideological barrier he had built around him

This is a 159 minute long movie extremely well acted by Max von Sydow, and Ghita Norby as his wife. Norby's own character, Marie Hamsun, emerges as that of a suffering but loyal intellectual partner. It matches Sydow's dour, intransigent and cantankerous portrayal of Hamsun. The scenes are long, slow and brilliant. Conversations are pungent and sad. English subtitles are excellent and in perfect synchrony. Other characters, including their alcoholic daughter and party officials, are given sufficient time to develop their imprints.

There are a few remarkably deliberate, but poignant scenes - one where Hamsun meets Hitler with much rehearsed and eager boyish enthusiasm only to be rejected halfway through a truncated encounter. Hitler was patently malignant towards Hamsun's notion of ultimate Norwegian equity with Germany. Another is when, during post-War interviews, Marie Hamsun is  forced and cajoled to answer very disconcerting personal questions. She is then betrayed by her interviewing medical authorities by a public sharing of her replies. Still another is a neurologically accurate and repeated depiction of Hamsun trying to steady and restrain his tremoring right hand with the left. We do not escape the expected shock of viewing many quick contrasts of arrogance, opulence and indifference of German staff and their quarters with the stark cold and bare living conditions of ordinary Norwegians.

This is a distressing movie because of the way in which Hamsun starts losing his confidence and his physical prowess even as his intransigence strengthens. The portrayal of this insidious transition is the crowning glory of the movie.  It is also a disturbing movie because it is hard to separate the man of literary brilliance from the man of rage, dogmas and opinions.

It raises some messy questions. Can we ever unstitch the mosaic of a strong personality and choose to admire parts of it and condemn some of the rest of it? Do powerful personalities come as a complex package that is too uncomfortable for the rest of us to accept unless we fragment them to our preferred biases?

Finally it is also a sad movie simply because of the time when this takes place and the unrelenting heaviness of its theme. It is a movie to sober us into thinking about the meaning and consequences of our convictions.

I am giving this movie 5 stars because it exposed my ignorance of an aspect of history, and it stimulated dormant emotions and posed many unanswerable questions.

949563,5,630502118X,"An uneven viewing experience in which the good far outweighs the bad. Specifically, this film is alternately draggy, strange, weird and insightful. We see a revered poet and writer who tries to enhance the power and prestige of his Norwegian Homeland by allying himself with local national socialists and the German invaders preceding and following WW II.  At the same time, his wife becomes an ardent proponent of Hitler's philosophy.  The most interesting segment of the story deals with the end of the War and how the poet and his wife confront revelations of atrocities and charges of treason. In the final analyis, this is a niche film that will appeal primarily to history buffs and students of European literature.",1251763200,2,721,5.0
949564,5,630502118X,"Although I know this will strike some readers as extreme, my response to Jan Troell's ""Hamsun"" is that there's nothing in this film that isn't perfect.  Screenplay, cinematography, acting, historical authenticity, musical score:  everything is exactly as it should be.  It's a pity that the film isn't better known.  For that matter, it's a pity that Hamsun the author isn't better read these days.

The narrative begins in 1935, when Hamsun is already in his mid-70s.  Winner of the 1920 Nobel Prize for Literature, lionized as Norway's greatest son, Hamsun is a study in purposeless alienation.  He hasn't written a word in years, he's lost the respect of his jealous wife, his relationship with his children is distant, he's isolated himself from the public on his huge estate, and his growing deafness pushes him ever deeper into solitude.  Consequently, Hamsun is a man who lives in a world of abstract ideas.  He's lost contact with concrete reality--surely, by the way, one of the reasons for his writer's block.

All this makes him easy prey for the ""idealistic"" wave of National Socialism, which he quickly embraces and publicly supports.  It's only after the war that Hamsun, charged with collaboration, comes to understand the great and fatal divide between ideals and reality.  A New European Order sounds good on paper, perhaps.  But the reality of that New Order--a reality which Hamsun simply ignored for too long--was destruction, death camps, and genocide.

Troell's film is a sensitive examination of the artistic and moral decline and fall of a great man.  Max von Sydow's portrayal of the aged lion is, in my view, his very best performance.  Von Sydow resists the temptation to reduce Hamsun to either villain or victim, instead rendering him as a complex nexus of irascibility and tenderness, canniness and bewilderment, leonine strength and aged fragility, courage and timidity.  It's an utterly successful performance.

Highly recommended.",1213747200,6,1963,5.177777777777778
949565,3,630502118X,"Hamsun (Jan Troell, 1996)

Jan Troell, largely unknown to American audiences since he severed his troubled relationship with Hollywood in the late seventies, has here created an interesting, if flawed, portrait of Knut Hamsun, one of the twentieth century's great writers, and a man who found himself on the wrong end of the stick during World War II. Hamsun is portrayed by Max von Sydow, and truthfully, von Sydow-- a man capable of making anything watchable (well, okay, we'll overlook Exorcist II: The Heretic)-- is easily the best thing about this film. That is not to say he's the only good thing, but it is von Sydow's performance that carries the film beyond where it really should go.

The time is the early forties. Norway has been occupied by the Germans, and not all Norwegians are thrilled with the prospect. Hamsun is one of those who is, and he throws himself into writing pro-Hitler propaganda to get the Norse to like the guy better. His embittered wife, Marie (Ghita Norby, probably best known on this side of the pond for Lars von Trier's The Kingdom), is not overly fond of Hamsun, but, as she tells him during one unforgettable argument, the mores into which he has inculcated her have stuck; she will be his mouthpiece to the Nazi party (for Hamsun, ironically, never learned German). Norway's rank and file, who had once praised him as Norway's greatest son, now turn upon him and call him a traitor. Then comes Germany's defeat and Hitler's death, and it is revealed to Hamsun that he was not at all aware of much of what the Germans were doing during the war; this leads us into the final hour of the film, which deals with Hamsun's decline and, ultimately, death.

The film's main problem is its pace, which upon reflection is confusing more than anything; while the movie would seem to deal with Hamsun's possible Nazi affiliation, that doesn't answer for the final forty-five minutes of the film, especially after the trial, which simply deals with the end of Hamsun's life. But then, if the film is more about Hamsun's life and the possible Nazi affiliation is just a subplot, why does it take up so much of the first half of the film? The two are spliced together about as well as can be expected-- which unfortunately is not as well as it could have been. Much of the latter half of the film seems almost extraneous but for von Sydow's stunning performance; the weaker Hamsun gets, the stronger von Sydow's performance becomes. Von Sydow is surrounded by a stable of fine actors, but in the end he eclipses them all; I'm not sure any actor, no matter how fine, could have stood in the face of this performance and not had his light dimmed. I just wish everything else had worked as well as the acting here. ***",1199318400,2,2741,4.635802469135802
949566,3,630502118X,"As usual, Max Von Sydow is excellent in his role of the great Nobel Laureate and Norwegian novelist, Knut Hamsun.
To be sure, I would've liked to see the director and producer delve back deeper into Hamsun's history. I think his formative years and time in America would have been more than worthwhile to chronicle. Hamsun was an incredibly lucid and accomplished author and one of the more compelling figures of the 20th Century. The totality of his life is a lesson in perserverance, rugged individualism, and originality. A more complete representation of his life is required to give viewers what they deserve.",1060560000,8,614,4.970873786407767

The subject matter is, naturally, controversial but the film gracefully confronts the issue of the Hamsuns' Nazism and gives humanity to it.  This is the best Von Sydow performance I have ever seen, helped by a precision piece of scripting.  For those who are not familiar with Hamsun the film will not have the same power but will stand very strongly as a tragedy. The story does concern Nazism and literature, but its main focus is the estrangement and reconciliation of two powerful personalities. As a love story, it is impeccable.",978652800,22,660,4.672413793103448
949568,5,630502118X,"Max Von S&uuml;dow is a fabulous Knut Hamsun in this film about the life of the famous Norwegian writer. The charismatic Danish actress Ghita Nrby plays his manipulative wife.
Without truly knowing what he is getting into Knut Hamsun is attracted to the teachings of a certain man by the name of Adolf Hitler. Because the wife is the one truly devoted to the Fuehrer, Hamsun struggles between what she is trying to convince him is the true nature of Nazism and what he learns from other sources (not to mention from his encounter with Hitler himself, who wants Hamsun as a propaganda tool for the Nazi cause).
Obviously, the film is controversial. How much did Knut Hamsun actually know about the atrocities committed by the Nazis and how much was he lulled into it all by his wife?
The relationship between the arts and politics is made explicit and explored. How and why we chose and practise our ideologies is frightening and makes you wonder about your own convictions.

Knut Hamsun seemingly had everything: Norway's poet laureate and novelist par excellence who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1920. So how did this ""great man"" end up by betraying his country by supporting Hitler during World War II? Hamsun was no garden variety traitor and the story of his collaboration is complicated as was made clear by Jan Troell's absorbing but somewhat biased 1997 film.

The story begins in Norway at the time of Germany's surrender. We then flash back to 1936 at the time when Hamsun (brilliantly played by Max Von Sydow) was already 77 years old. He and his much younger second wife, Marie, can't stand each other and his four adult children resent their father for sending them off to boarding school when they were young and basically not expressing enough affection toward them when they were growing up.

Flash forward to 1940 and Hamsun openly calls for Norweigians not to resist the new Nazi occupiers but to cooperate with them. He supports Quisling, the puppet head of the newly installed Fascist government and is further resented by the general Norwegian population when Marie (who speaks German) goes on the lecture circuit, supporting the German cause.

Despite his pro-German leanings, Hamsun attempted to intervene on behalf on resisters scheduled to be executed by the Nazis. Hamsun met with Josef Terboven, the Reich Commissioner in Norway, but his appeals for mercy fell on deaf ears despite Terboven's soon to be realized false assurances. Hamsun rejected Nazi racial theories to Terboven's face and had Jewish friends. Hamsun even met with Hitler in Germany in 1943 (as most ably illustrated in the film) and alienated the cruel dictator by protesting Terboven's brutal policies in Norway. Upon leaving, Hitler was overheard remarking that he never wanted to see ""that man"" (Hamsun), ever again! Hamsun was quoted as saying that he still believed in Hitler but his ""wishes were being twisted"" by men like Terboven (this according to Jeffrey Frank in his excellent 2005 article in the New Yorker, ""In From the Cold-The return of Knut Hamsun"").

After the war Norway hardly was in a position to dispose of Hamsun as they did Quisling, who ended up in front of a firing squad. Hamsun, on the other hand, was an old man. His wife got three years in prison but Hamsun ended up being shuttled back and forth between a nursing home and a psychiatric institution. Hamsun resented being diagnosed as ""senile"" by the psychiatrists and demanded his proper day in court. Finally a civil action was brought against him and he was fined a substantial portion of his savings.

In his defense, Hamsun argued that due to his advanced age, deafness and isolation (he only had pro-German papers to read on his country estate), he was unaware of the atrocities the Nazis were committing. This same view appears to have been endorsed by Troell, who appears to have been influenced by the author of a book chronicling Hamsun's trial as well as a 1987 biography (according to Jeffrey Frank).

Troell only briefly touches on Hamsun's support of Germany during the war. Much of the support stemmed from Hamsun's anti-British attitude which dated back to the Boer War in 1900. In Hamsun's myopic world view, Britain was the devil incarnate, citing the excesses in its years as a colonial power. Hamsun could never admit that Britain had evolved much since those days and had a become a progressive force in world politics. Troell appears to argue that Hamsun found some measure of redemption in his last years, writing a new book after so many years, in an attempt to justify his behavior.

The bottom line is that Hamsun never was able to see the bigger picture. During the occupation of Norway during World War II, Hamsun was unable to draw the connection between the Reich Commissioner's brutal policies and Hitler himself. Somehow Hitler was not aware and not responsible for what his subordinates were doing in Hamsun's eyes.  Hamsun saw Norway as independent but part of a greater German Empire, with Great Britain as victimizer, not victim.

Hamsun is an excellent portrait of the curmudgeonly artist who turned a blind eye to what was going on in the world before the tragic occupation of his country. He had ample opportunity to observe what the Nazis were all about between the wars but chose to view the world only through an anti-British prism. Hamsun's failure was probably most due to a rigid personality that could see or hear no evil.",1446076800,,4518,4.886422976501305

He became an admirer of Hitler, partly due to his wife's influence, and at first welcomed the German invasion of Norway during World War II. (Ironically, his only foreign language was English, and when he toured Germany, his wife had to interpret for him.) He gradually became disillusioned with the Nazis, especially when he saw what they were doing to the Norwegian people and when his personal meeting with Hitler went sour, but by then it was too late.

7880804,5,630502118X,"A few evenings ago, being into the mood for a good movie, I happened to come across this 1997 film about the Norwegian writer Knut Hamsun (1859-1952), whom I'd never heard of before but who is apparently considered one of Scandinavia's greatest authors.  I decided to give the movie a try, since it starred Max Von Sydow, one of my favorites.

""Hamsun"" is long (2 hours and 40 mins.) and at times rather slow, but on the whole, I found it fascinating as a study of character, family dynamics, and politics.  It covers the period from the mid-1930s to Hamsun's death and focuses on his naive support of Hitler.  Fortunately, the director and screenwriter take a ""stay out of the way"" approach to the material, allowing us to feel what the characters (presumably) felt and draw our own conclusions.  Even the villains seem human.

The movie also features some beautiful scenery, including film that appear to have been shot around Hamsun's actual country home.  The historical recreations are mostly quite good, although sometimes (especially in portrayals of combat, which are few and brief) you can tell that the director was trying to make do with limited resources.

Von Sydow's performance is fantastic, as are those of Ghita Norby as his (much younger) wife, Sverre Ousdal as Vidkun Quisling, and Anette Hoff as Hamsun's alcoholic daughter.

I highly recommend it if you're in the mood for a deliberately paced, involving drama.",1388448000,,1432,4.933333333333334
7880805,4,630502118X,"Although lengthy, the film moves quickly. In Scandinavian and German, with English subtitles.

I read four of Hamsun's novels many years ago, starting with Hunger, and recommend this film, and his novels, highly. It centers on an examination of the political position of the Norwegian Nobel prize-winner during the Second World War.

Rather than look at Hamsun's position through the myopic American ""we were right, and they were wrong"" view, try to look through Hamsun's eyes-- Why did he feel as he did? Could his view have been justified, as of 1940? Do remember, as we hear him say, the British had the first concentration camps, the British subjugated peoples around the world, and so on. Remember that our own country (if you are USA) fought the British in two wars. Imagine that you hate the British more than anything else. That might help you appreciate his position.

On to a particular scene: His meeting with Hitler was particularly well-done. Not the shrieking madman as portrayed in your typical Hollywood film, but the thoughtful politician, making conversation about their shared artistic interests, and showing gentleness to a little girl (Albert Speer's daughter). We know little about Hitler's private life, and only a single tape recording exists of him speaking in everyday conversation (with another Scandinavian, the leader of Finland, recorded without Hitler's knowledge). So there is no real way to say the portrayal of Hitler was right or wrong, but it shows that a lot of thought went into it. Do note that Hitler threw him out at the end of the meeting.

It would have been a full-length and complete film halfway through, to where he collapses while chopping wood in April '45. See von Sydow in his other great films: The Seventh Seal, Three Days of the Condor, and so many more.",1369526400,,1808,4.9375
