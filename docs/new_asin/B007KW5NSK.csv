8519173,5,B007KW5NSK,"I never was interested in Sophia Loren until I watched this movie. It's actually not about her much after she obtains stardom, but more about her mother and sister and the dynamics of their relationship.  The movie does a superb job of bringing out the psychological aspects of their personalities and really fleshes them out as people.  It held my interest throughout, and the Italian location added to it. It does have English subtitles, which due to the intensity of the movie, do not detract. Sophia's mother is a fascinating character, played well by Sophia herself.  Well worth watching.",1393200000,2,593,4.96969696969697
8519174,5,B007KW5NSK,"Sophia is so wonderfully bitter and at the same time a loving mother, to the best of what she can be, given her circumstances, in this movie as she plays the role of her real life mother, Romilda that towards the end of Disc 1, you realize that you almost hate Sophia.
Towards the middle of Disc 2 of this movie, I had to remind myself that the role Sophia is playing is really not her but someone else....
I then had to watch a couple of her lovely movies found on  boccaccio '70 to rekindle my flame for this amazingly talented, beautiful, intelligent, sensitive actress.
The movie is lovely and is shown as seen from Sophia's sister Maria's eyes, based on Maria autobigraphical book.
It is well worth making the investment, if you are a true fan.
This movie surely helped me realize in a big way that the screen stars have all of the everyday challenges that we regular people are faced with.
Its just today's media that makes them out to be mere celluloid stars, minus all of the dramas of personal issues...",1361318400,,1012,4.440860215053763
8519175,2,B007KW5NSK,I hadn't realized it until I received the dvd that I had seen this on Italian television and had not been that impressed.  The performances are weak and the production seems stilted and very contrived.  The color and sound are good but it's just not a great piece of work for anyone.,1346457600,,283,4.423076923076923
