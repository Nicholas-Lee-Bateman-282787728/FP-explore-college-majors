4235576,5,B003ZU60F6,"Los Angeles-based yoga teacher Kelly Wood has taken her successful ""Hi Yoga!"" kids yoga program from the studio and onto the screen. I am fortunate to know Kelly personally, as she was the one who introduced me to yoga over 15 years ago. When I heard she had developed a DVD for parents and children to practice together, I was very excited because there are not many programs locally where I can take my 4 year old daughter for yoga. Most of the ""Mommy and Me"" programs are geared for younger age groups. I wanted something we could do together.

""Hi Yoga!"" is charming and easy-to-follow. The poses are given cute, catchy names to get kids engaged. They are designed to be done in tandem, but there is a section of the DVD for kids to practice on their own, if they want. (Great for older kids with some practice in the basics.) I also liked that there are sections on breathing, focus and calming down. While the poses are fun to practice together, the true benefit of yoga for children is learning how to be comfortable in stillness and healthy methods for handling stress and emotions. ""Hi Yoga!"" provides all of this in a playful, positive way.

I knew the DVD was a winner when I came home one Sunday afternoon to find my husband and daughter in the living room, practicing along with the DVD - and making up some new stuff as they went along.",1323043200,2,1350,4.439516129032258

8410975,1,B003ZU60F6,"I bought this thinking I could do some yoga with my 2.5 year old son. (Yes, I see that it's recommended for 3 and up. My review would be the same if he were 4... or 14.) After watching an incredibly long introduction with a bunch of cartoon stars and a smiling cat, the first exercise starts. It's over in a flash, and then more stars. There are only 3 exercises for parents with kids - 1) twist your upper body 2) stand on one leg and 3) breathe. Breathing is also part of the other 2.
This is far from relaxing. I kept waiting for some kind of instruction... and waiting... and waiting... and looking at the stars. My son meanwhile started dancing. I think he had the right idea. Save your money.",1391385600,3,698,4.2164179104477615
8410976,4,B003ZU60F6,"To see the expression on my 6yr old's face is worth the price of admission.  She loves to ""exercy"" and she looks forward to doing the poses, following along with the dvd.",1370995200,,170,4.3125
8410977,5,B003ZU60F6,"This is a GREAT DVD, filled with information, techniques and practical advice to get your little ones involved in yoga at a young age.  My kids seem to be bombarded with video games and so much stimuli, I have been trying to get them into Yoga for a while.  I popped this DVD in and they were interested, attentive and we had lots of fun participating.  Kelly is a great teacher that seems in tune and has an amazing ability to translate her practice from the screen, right to your living room! Two Thumbs up from my family!",1354492800,,524,4.326530612244898
8410978,1,B003ZU60F6,This was slow and boring.  I could not get my 4 and 7 yr olds to participate. A waste of money.,1349654400,2,95,3.5238095238095237
8410979,5,B003ZU60F6,My daughter and I have enjoyed the DVD and it has been a wonderful introduction for both of us to yoga.  It has also helped my daughter with attention and staying calm.  Thank you!,1343606400,3,180,4.264705882352941
8410980,5,B003ZU60F6,This video was a great introduction to yoga for kids. My daughter took to it immediately at the age of two and a half and has progressed into a complex practice at the age of four. I would highly recommend it.,1323043200,,209,4.121951219512195
8410981,5,B003ZU60F6,"This is a fun, easy-to-follow video. It's a great way to get kids interested in yoga and is so good for their brain development, flexibility and sense of calm.",1323043200,,159,4.517241379310345
