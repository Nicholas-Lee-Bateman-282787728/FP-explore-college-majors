7987078,5,B00008V60Z,"Aurelie Dupont (Kitri) is the best active Prima Ballerina in the world. This DVD is just perfect (video, sound, and camera work). Manuel Legris (Basile) is the perfect dancing partner of Aurelie Dupont. Marie Agnes Gillot is excellent as the street dancer and Jean Guillaume Bart as Espada is great!!! I was so impressed with this ballet performance that three months after I watched this video I traveled to Paris to see the Don Quixote ballet, the best experience of my life!!!",1207008000,7,479,4.853658536585366
7987079,5,B00008V60Z,This is an elegant visual delight and fun! The costuming lighting movement and precision of the company makes this another exceptional dvd from the POB with high production values and exceptional dancing. Dupont's smile illuminates the stage and I agree Legris certainly does dance his socks off - their final pas de deux is worth the price alone. The Don's role is only an underpinning to the Kitri and Basile show but works in context (as does the comedy) and the POB sets high standards in recording performances with such attention to detail. Long may it continue. As for something more earthy -the version Nureyev filmed with the Australian Ballet makes an interesting comparison.,1177891200,4,685,5.017543859649122
7987080,5,B00008V60Z,"The image and sound quality of this DVD is truly superb. sound. This is another masterful production of the Opera de Paris. Costumes and decor are beautiful. Aurlie Dupont is radiant, dances marvelously and is ever so elegant. Manuel Legris and Jean Guillaume Bart both give a great performance. This is a DVD to own or to offer.",1134777600,9,329,4.689655172413793
7987081,2,B00008V60Z,"The DVD I recently received had nothing recorded for the middle sound channel; otherwise the production, video and dancing  were excellent and worth 5 stars if the center sound channel had been present.

7987082,5,B00008V60Z,"Nureyev's ""Don Quichotte"" produced for the Paris Opera Ballet is a miracle of dancing and story-telling. Nureyev, we are told, was addicted to old Hollywood musicals and in this ballet it shows. The routines of the corps de ballet are amazing in their complexity and fluidity, clearly owing much to Busby Berkeley. The corps are as much stars of the show as are the etoiles, but the etoiles are magnificent. Jean-Guillaume Bart as Espada the toreador has a swaggering insolence and precision of line equalled only by Marie-Agnes Gillot, the ""street dancer"" who partners him.
However, it is the dancing of Manuel Legris and Aurelie Dupont, Basile and Kitri, that is a wonder to behold. They are perfectly matched and move in total harmony throughout. Legris who, we are told by one critic, ""is in the autumn of his career"" dances his socks off with a brio and perfection seldom seen anywhere. The total production is so funny it makes one laugh, and the dancing so close to the Platonic Ideal that it makes one want to cry at its beauty. Few productions ever lift the spirits as this one does. We should thank God for the Paris Opera Ballet and its dancers, and for Nureyev who lives on in this production. Buy it now. Buy it for your friends!",1088208000,26,1242,4.65
