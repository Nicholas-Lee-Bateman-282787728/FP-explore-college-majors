I watched this on tcm the other day, and I was disappointed when I came to Amazon to buy it - that it was no longer available.  Please re-release on dvd.  Thank you.",1454025600,3,262,3.980769230769231
8484236,1,B005REN72W,"I cannot imagine how Amazon does not exert a better control of the quality of the products sold through its site. Totally unwatchable, this movie deserves a much much better edition. Pixelled to the unbelievable, this Ivy is just a copy I could not bear watching for 5 minutes. I am totally antipiracy, but I have to admit that editions like this one may make you change your mind.",1401926400,4,381,4.536231884057971
8484237,5,B005REN72W,I am very excited to have the opportunity to purchase this movie as I could not find on any other websites.  Quality is not the best but it's ok as I really wanted to see this movie after having heard the radio version. Please keep providing these hard-to-find classic titles that can be played in the U.S.,1392681600,4,306,4.368421052631579
8484238,5,B005REN72W,"I am afraid that I haven't seen this movie in over thirty five years.  It is so crisp and clear in my memory,  why not bring it back; then we can enjoy it again.  Ms. Fontaine is enjoying a new look, well, with ""The constant nymph"", being available again, and such a success, it is difficult to see how a great talent, and her perfomances can be forgotten.  Forgotten?  look at "" A letter from an unknown woman"".  Max Ophuls American masterpiece........... why not have them bring ""Ivy"", the movie back?  To dvd.

  I know you will soon.  She is one of the last great stars of the 1930's etc.  MUST we wait until she has passed to honor the lady?  I have read that she is a bright intelligent woman, besides; being the only Hitchcock female lead to win an oscar.  Let us give the lady a big hand.  Make her movies available to us, please.

Please an addendum to the above review.  A year ago approximately the film ""Ivy"" was available. I bought it, and have enjoyed it so much.  Even more interesting than I had remembered.  More sinister, even more evil, in a sweet sort of way?  Miss Fontaine's mother has an interesting role in the film...see if you can find her.  Joan makes it look so easy, she had a way of just becomming the roles she played.  ""Strangers in the Night"", Fontaine is very clever here. I have wondered how close this portrayal might have come to the real Ms. Fontaine.  Not available!  Unless you make the film available, we can never decide or have a real opinion............... Let the artists shine.",1323475200,14,1523,4.415162454873646
