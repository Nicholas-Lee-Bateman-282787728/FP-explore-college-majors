8189843,4,6303696546,"I liked this video. It taught some mtions and junps, but i wish it focused more on teching the stunts and cheers. It teaches the words of a cheer, rather than working on the motions. It breezed through some stuff like the  speech and who to yell. I think those things are pretty important. Overall,  I enjoyed the video and would recommend it to a beginning cheerleader.",945993600,14,370,4.507462686567164
