2163731,4,B00063MCRA,"Starhunter was a B-level sci fi show aired at like 3AM in my area a while back.  I only caught a few episodes of it, and recently (because I liked this release so much) bought it on DVD.  I really am enjoying it.  Anyway, Starhunter 2300 may have been similarly aired in such vespertine hours, but if it was, I missed it altogether.  This show is a restructured version of the original.  Similar pretense, some different characters (Michael Pare is gone), more special effects, and some decent writing.  I have this box set and have watched about halfway through so far.  I will watch the rest and have enjoyed myself thus far.  It is an adventure show set in space, on a par writing-wise, quality-wise, enjoyment-level-wise with something like Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World tv series, though a little less silly and more somber in tone than that particular show.  Some of the characters are endearing, though I have to say Tanya Allen is not as fun this time around.  Her character is more dour than quirky sometimes, though it does fit her character's new situation.  This show has production similarities to a sci fi show like Lexx, as they are both products of Canada (you will see character actors from Lexx and other Canadian genre shows you may recognize appear from time to time).  This show is not as dark or sarcastic as Lexx (or as silly), though, but it is a darker show than a lot of other sci fi things that have ended up in syndication.  There are, as others have mentioned, certain similarities with Firefly, the short-lived Fox series of a few years ago (eventually resurrecting in movie Serenity) in the setting and crew of characters, but these are superficial.  It is not as well acted, written or directed as Firefly was.  It is not as engrossing as Firefly.  It is a fun indulgence, like watching Saturday afternoon episodes of syndicated action/adventure or sci fi.  It's better than Andromeda (more consistent, makes more sense, more hardcore sci fi ideas, less incoherent spiritual sidetrips, similar level of special effects).  No where near as epic as Babylon 5 or even Deep Space Nine (not that they are on the same level).  It's episodic sci fi and if you're into that, here's some more.  If you know you watch anything sci fi they put on the air because you're a rabid sci fi fan, then you should seek this out, because it's better than a bunch of shows you sat through already and told yourself were worth it.  This show should have gotten a better chance to be seen here in the states.  Anyway, here's a rabid sci fi fan who says it ain't your new favorite show, but it is a fun little trip into space each episode that's recommended.",1109548800,16,2672,4.604651162790698

2163733,4,B00063MCRA,"I thought the only sci-fi that would ever come out of the British Empire would be a spoof-show riddled with toilet humor.

But I did enjoy this whole series. Especially towards the end, however as the other reviewer stated, production does lack a little, but the stories make up for it in spades (along with the SCRUMPTIOUS Tanya Allen, she is so friggin cute).

Basically it's like watching a slightly less interesting Firefly with British accents. If you like Crusade, Firefly, B5 etc. this is a good addition to that genre drawer (fellow DVD compulsives). Any sci-fi fan would appreciate these stories on some level.",1102291200,59,619,4.885714285714286
2163734,3,B00063MCRA,"First of all, don't bother complaining about Image releasing the second season, the first season shows were licensed by a different company (Platinum) and are already on the market on DVD. Amazon and many other outlets carry the first season DVD releases; do a search. Take note: the Platinum DVD volumes contain the uncut versions of the shows not aired on US TV, which contain some nudity and run a bit longer.

The second season is a lot more expensive, but it is a higher quality presentation. The real trouble here is that both seasons are pretty dull and cheaply produced.

Fans will likley buy them, others won't find anything worth more than a rental when everything else is checked out.",1098057600,55,695,4.735537190082645

The lead actor and character really carries this series, the lead actor being Clive Robertson who plays Montana, the captain of the ship ""Trans Utopian"". The interaction between characters in this series is better than the original, and the resultant conclusions to each episode's plot fulfills itself more succinctly than the original.

2163749,4,B00063MCRA,"I saw the first season with Michael Pare and it was ok. Normally when TV execs come in and change a show I disagree with their changes, but I really liked what they did. They made it sexier, more artistic, and really improved the show. Although there are some continuity problems, the changes were good. The characters were starting to fill in and become more interesting, each show adds a new dimension to the story and the people.
It definitely has the best opening theme music of any sci-fi show with Peter Gabriel's Darker Star, combined with the futuristic views of Syn City and Clarke Station which are exceptional. If this had been allowed to continue I think they would have had some really good story arcs. They had already started more than a few threads that I could see weaving in and improving the storyline.
It is more realistic than most shows in that it is set in our own solar system, and you could see that it was headed quickly out into the stars. They obviously expected to do more shows by the way it ends, or rather doesn't end.
Then there's the science of it, this was much more believable than some. No shields, replicators, and transporters, just metal, lasers, torpedoes,and antimatter drive with time dilation. Although this is sci-fi so you do have to go along for the ride and suspend your disbelief when it comes to the Divinity Cluster and hyperspace, but to me that's the main reason I love sci-fi it's such a great escape from the everyday world we live in.
All in all I like the artistic look, and even though they didn't have a huge budget this manages to be an entertaining show.",1320451200,3,1615,4.534246575342466

However, the characters were pretty compelling.  Starhunter 2300 is the revamped final season with an entirely new cast save for two people.  Personally, though the final season had better graphics and more money for production, the story line didn't hold together as well as the earlier DVD set.

It was imagnative and well written,well acted,much better than the first season which did not hold my interest.

Clive Robertson is an excelent actor and was well suited for his role.

He is also very easy on the eyes,the man is hot in general and even hotter in leather pants & boots.

My only complaint is the last episode on the last disc was an unresolved story.

My guess is the story was supposed to finish out in the next season but since there was no next season we will never know what happened.

2163766,3,B00063MCRA,"I'm not a person that cares about extras or what nots on DVD's.  With the exception of the office I just don't watch them.

My review is more geared at someone like me that was looking for something cheap and maybe interesting and has no clue about the show.  I read one review that said this was like firefly...  This has spaceships and that's about where any similarity ends... well, i guess there are guns too and space.

The acting is terrible.  Seriously.  The plot has holes the size of... something that's really really really like mind blowing big, and then bigger than that.  I watched this and my response was ""hey!  That's like how a DnD group gets together!""  You give someone your horrible back story and suddenly you join up with a complete stranger for fun adventures.  That's how it starts.

It doesn't explain itself or the background very well.  It just moves you forward.  The onscreen chemistry it tries to develop (I'm pretty sure they were trying) is horrible.  Someone dies and you're just like ""thank goodness it wasn't the crazy hot one"")

I gave it three stars because I enjoy bad sci fi from time to time.  After i stopped trying to blow my brains out over the gigantic holes in plot and simply let my brain melt into a puddle of goo stupor, i enjoyed the nonsensical brain candy and horrible writing.  It's like those really sour candies, but for the brain.  Some people like them, and some don't and if you enjoy the sour there will be some sweet in the middle.

Not something I'd recommend, but some people will definitely like it.  If you tend to like shows that others think were dumb (like you were a fan of DnD the movie), you'll likely enjoy this and wonder what I'm talking about.  If you like bad sci fi, you'll likely suffer for a bit and then come around to enjoy it.  If you want a quality show.  Avoid this.  Quality it is not.  the writers should be shot.",1271808000,4,1897,4.426086956521739

2163768,3,B00063MCRA,"Being a Sci Fi junkie, I had to own a series called STARhunter 2300. Having seen it on YouTube, I was hoping to find the missing ending. It ain't there. What a let down. The story and characters moved along nicely throughout the whole series only to abruptly end on the cliffhanger meant to draw viewers to the next season. It's a shame corporate money hounds can't figure out that Science fiction sells. It seems, if they don't like it, you're not allowed to.
But I digress.
This was supposed to be the continuing story of Dante Montana, a bounty hunter and his niece, who live in space after Earth was decimated by man and rendered virtually uninhabitable.
Dante's family is tragically separated due to Raiders abducting his son Travis and killing his wife.
But the writers seem to think Travis Montana's character needed to be fundamentally changed from season to season.
Once the forced gear change is made, we find Percy (Dante Montana's niece) returned from hyperspace 15 years after disappearing and discovers that by salvage laws she has inherited the TULIP a luxury liner/spaceship her and her uncle were renting from Rudolpho DeLuna, their old boss, who is now broke and looking for a job.
Somehow neither Dante or Luc made it back from hyperspace and the family is still tragically fragmented.
For now, Travis Percy's cousin is plopped down into the story with his partner, Marcus.
Rudolpho with his new recruit, Callista, a rival hunter joins, reluctantly at first, and tada! We have a crew.
The bounty hunting gets underway with mysteries of the universe woven into the story.
A Sci Fi junkies dream.
I give this only 3 stars because of the gaping plot hole and unfinished state of the series.",1261699200,9,1706,4.786440677966102

You can watch season two without ever realizing there was a season one.  Just thought I'd make a note of it since I just found this out myself.

As to the show itself, I thought it was great.  the story is wonderful and I'm sorry there weren't more seasons to watch, but that's always the way.",1253664000,7,468,4.261363636363637

Why ""Prissy"" of course, the most annoying of teenagers. Now I'm not saying Tanya Allen is bad in the role, I'm saying the role is bad, she's just good at being annoying. The series is watchable but it's about what one might expect from a fancast rather than a studio backed tv-series. If you liked Starhunter (the first series) you'll probably enjoy this one, it's much in the same vain but do not look for anything extraordinary, like I said, only watchable.",1224892800,3,651,4.572649572649572

I didn't even mind the total lack of decent scenery. I really enjoyed the play between Dante and Percy.  I just wish they had continued with Pare`. I just don't think Percy could fit as well with anyone else so I have decided not to take the time to even bother with the continuation of the series.

*Good special effects and action; better than the first ""Star Hunter.""
*Still has good characters.
*Still has good stories; perhaps even better than ""Star Hunter"" because there's more action.

The Bad Things
*Some episodes still feel long.
*Characters have some issues that never get resolved.

With higher production value, the second season of ""Star Hunter"" looks much better, with fancier special effects, more action, better sets, better costumes, and a cleaner picture.  It is enjoyable for sci-fi fans, and would reccomend it as a compliment to the first ""Star Hunter"" season (or perhaps to fans of ""Firefly"").",1205884800,7,632,5.3

2163776,4,B00063MCRA,"I liked this second ""season"" of the Star Hunter series.  It was obviously better financed, has better writing, more polished production values, and so on.  I wasn't sure about the new cast, but I grew to like them and enjoyed both series a lot.  Overall, I preferred the original first series, because I found the story themes better and more engrossing (even if the writer's screenplay skills were sometimes lacking).  But I thoroughly enjoyed this installment, although at the end I felt it flagged a bit.

This DVD set is much better as far as polish, production and packaging than the first.  Worth the money.

P.S. I feel very sure Joss Whedon was familiar with this series, especially the first season, since there are many similarities and references in FireFly/Serenity that can only be homage to StarHunter.  Maybe one day someone will ask him.  Firefly was a much better series overall, one of the best Sci-Fi series ever (IMHO).  I'd give my left toe to be able to go back in time and see it get a nice 5 seasons or so run.  It's a tragedy that Fox execs were so incredibly stupid and mishandled it so badly.  Thankfully, they got to make the wonderful movie Serenity to wrap it all up.",1198800000,5,1197,4.59433962264151
2163777,5,B00063MCRA,"Starhunter 2300 has competent, interesting scripts, some quirky, likeable characters, and even some tense romantic undercurrents which begin to surface just before the series is abruptly cut short. Production values are reasonable, if you allow the spacecraft look like they escaped from a video game.

There are two carry-over characters from Starhunter (the original series) and they are more fully developed in this series. Percy in particular is a huge amount of fun as a character.

Scripts are tight and I feel with further updates to the special effects this TV series could easily outclass anything the Sci-Fi channel puts on the air these days. Another season was merited but denied and with the passage of time there is less and less chance of a resurection.

With appropriate promotion, better effects and some TLC this franchise could so easily be turned into a winner. Shame on the studios for their lack of vision.

Callista is simply wonderful; both the actress and the character deserve more screen time. Her character is three dimensional and develops over the series. I found myself caring, which is unusual since most sci-fi series are too cheesy to elicit that kind of response.",1189036800,6,1198,5.065989847715736
2163778,5,B00063MCRA,I had just finished watching this box set over 2 weekends and I must say I wish there could be more. This show is no firefly. If you like sci-fi tv shows about space bounty hunters this show is worth watching. It seems just as the show gets real good and the relationship between the crew from episode to episode is built up the show ends. Also if you a pc gamer and like games like freelancer or X3 reunion and ever woundered what a live action show would be like based off these games this tv series is worth watching. I enjoyed every episode of this show and if I can ever find the time to watch it again I would. If you add this show to your sci-fi collection of dvd's of firefly or babylon 5 you won't go wrong giving this show a try. I have not seen the first season of this show everyone is talking about.

It's too bad the episodes are mixed up on the DVDs! Also only a few episodes of season one are available on DVD. Why not put them all out and in the right order? The series is fun though.

Season one prompted me to try Starhunter 2300. Nice package! All of the episodes are included and in order. Wonderful image and sound. Fun episodes! Great show! Can we get a sequel? Maybe a direct to DVD ""Serenity""? A follow-up that unites father and son while introducing new fans to the previous two series?

2163781,4,B00063MCRA,"Having caught a few episodes of both the original Starhunter and Starhunter 2300 on grainy low power UHF, I kind of knew what to expect; still, I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this Starhunter 2300 set. The original season of Starhunter was strictly ""B"" level material; Starhunter 2300 is, just as others have pointed out, much much better.  Its not top level, this is definitely not Farscape or B5, but it is a really solid production that has a flavor all its own.

I thought there were a few things that made this series work well.  Its universe is interesting; its dark, gritty, and atmospheric, but not hopeless.  The interplay if the various planetary federations and factions provides enough scope that the setting of the solar system (well, mostly the solar system) doesn't feel confining.  The cast is quite likeable.  The performances may be on the low key side, but I thought they fit the milieu pretty well, for the most part.  Strangely enough, Percy Montana who may have been the best character in the original series, didn't come across too well for me - a little too catatonic and with a weird attraction to risky behavior.  The rest of the crew is great: Caravaggio the dry acerbic AI, the lively optimistic Marcus, the somewhat questionable Rudolpho, and the controlled uber competent Travis.  My favorite character, though, is Callie - tough as nails with a lot of depth and breadth.  Not to mention that Dawn Stern is a flat out goddess. Finally, there's the ongoing subtext of hyperspace and the ""Divinity Cluster"".  You really get the impression of impending breakthrough; that the human universe is on the verge of major changes - good and bad - and that the breakthrough has as much to do with genetic and emotional factors as with technology.

The episodes are consistently good for the most part.  I thought there was one real clunker, one borderline clunker, and two or three mediocre efforts.  These are more than balanced out by good or excellent episodes.  I'd say 75% of the episodes fall into the latter category; at least half a dozen, as well as the finale, are taut and gripping - close to the level of the best TV sci-fi.  I didn't think there were any glaring weaknesses with Starhunter 2300.  Sure the dialogue is not up to Firefly standards, there are better FX, and maybe there could have been more ""whoa"" factor and less repetitiveness in the storylines. With a little improvement in these areas this show could have been special.  I really got the impression that this was a first year type of series; one in which the universe was being defined, the characters were being established, and the foundations for the future were being set.

The DVD set is nicely put together; six DVDs in a streamlined book style box.  The package contains the episodes only; absolutely no extras.  The price is definitely right. Since the series was cancelled, you will be left hanging; I'd love to at least see a resolution to the two part finale, but I guess that's the lot of the sci-fi fan - you're left hanging as often as not.  Its too bad that this show didn't get more traction, but at least this set is available.  I actually had some withdrawal symptoms when I finished watching this; I think most sci-fi fans, casual to rabid, would enjoy this.",1113609600,37,3291,4.695121951219512
2163782,4,B00063MCRA,"I really liked the first season of Starhunter 2300.  At first I didn't know what to think so I just watched each show until the end.  OK so you could see it was on a very tight budget, but all-n-all I thought that it was really good!  The ending was good, now if someone can tell me where I can find Season 2 at I will be good to go!  The story line is well done the acting is not that bad, and the ship, need a space really bad, but other than that a good show!",1109721600,4,462,3.731958762886598
8037906,5,B00063MCRA,"I miss this show.  Found it super-cheap at a MovieStop and plunked it in with no expectations.  I was blown away.  Is it cutting-edge special effects?  Nope.  If anything, it reminds me of watching Blake's 7 or Doctor Who as a child ... well, maybe a little better than that.  The Tulip is an excellent space ship, but it is the cast that really did it for me ... I loved each and every character in the ensemble.  Sucks that it never caught on.  Not to be confused with the First Season, with Michael Pare, as that one was just okay-ish.  This one had creativity and heart and I still bust it out from time-to-time to re-watch it.  Would LOVE to see it available in the digital format.",1518912000,,686,4.2890625
