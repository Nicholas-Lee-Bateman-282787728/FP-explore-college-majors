1922295,5,B0000DC12Z,"Beyond Re-Animator, the second sequel to the 80s horror classic Re-Animator, blew away my expectations- brilliant in every sense, intelligent, fresh, funny, energetic, everything that made the first great. Jeffrey Combs is back as the witty mad scientist Herbert West (he puts in a great performance as usual)... the story picks up 13 years later where he's confined to the walls of a prison. He doesn't let that stop him from carrying out more experiments though and soon teams up with a young doctor (who by chance was a follower of West and his research).
 Now with advanced capabilities and improved ideas for re-animating the dead, the duo set out to perfect the process. Only problem is they get caught up in a prison break which escalates into an all out battle with the undead. Not only one of the bloodiest movies I've seen in a long time but very entertaining. This doesn't really feel like a horror movie, more like a sci fi freak fest and unique in that it takes place in a prison. Check this one out.",1065225600,7,1013,4.627777777777778

1922327,3,B0000DC12Z,"Not particularly well made sequel. If you thought the acting couldn't get any worse than Bride of Re-Animator, you gotta see this. Yes, it's a completely unnecessary movie with not much going for it, but still kinda riveting. Unique concept, but the creative gore from the original takes way too long to kick in here, and when it does, well..........it's pretty darn cool, actually. Whoever gave Jason Barry the idea that he had talent in the acting arena should probably be strangled. The humor is twisted as always, and a few decent one liners add to the demented fun, but the overall impression is one of just disappointment. Does have that old school feel though, and of course Elsa Pataky is compelling and gorgeous as always. Probably should pick it up for your collection, as the price here on amazon is definitely fair for the used dvd's.

1922334,5,B0000DC12Z,"Overall a nice film. Plenty of weird and grotesqueness though certain elements within the short stories that make up the original ""Herbert West : Reanimator"" still haven't been used. (Like that vat of ever living and growing reptile tissue over a Bunsen burner bubbling and moving and used by West to preserve certain tissues and organs for later use. He also created a means to indefinitely preserve a person still alive for at least 2 weeks. Plenty of fodder to use for any more movies.)

Some have stated that West's discovery of what essentially is the soul in a field of electrons contradicts his materialism as it is in the short stories of Lovecraft. It does but West is a scientist first and this fills a void he had in his biological reanimations and it is also science such as it is in the film.

The prison becomes a surreal place of horror as the demented warden uses the serum on prisoners as the end comes. I like it that we see Dr. West escape alive without any ambiguity.

The effects are excellent and if feels like it was filmed in the USA, not in Spain. I thirst for more Jeffery Combs!",1368057600,,1105,4.46039603960396

1922353,3,B0000DC12Z,"Dr. Herbert West has been imprisoned for his crimes against humanity, where he continues with his secret experiments on the inmates with the help of a prison doctor that shares his morbid curiosities. It isn't long before things get out of hand and heads begin to roll! Despite over a decade of separation and the departure of both Bruce Abbott and David Gale from the series, BEYOND RE-ANIMATOR does manage to garner some interest, but it is a far cry from Gordon's original. Jeffrey Combs feels bored with the role at this point, and while he is the one actor able to carry the film, only a shadow of the smarmy attitude and manic behavior that dressed his earlier performances remains. Director Brian Yuzna also tries to make the most out of the simple plot in a desperate attempt to recapture the same dark tone and sharp wit from before. Unfortunately, the uninspired writing and dialog lack both brains and heart. Where the film does deliver is in the gore department thanks to the special FX crew at Screaming Mad George, who bring back plenty of the gruesome make-up designs that have become synonymous with the series. BEYOND is not the shot of re-agent that most fans were hoping for, but it is a bloody escape that is more enjoyable than other late entries in film franchises like RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD.

1922354,5,B0000DC12Z,"Beyond Re-Animator: 8 out of 10: If you haven't seen the original Re-Animator drop what your doing and go see it. Re-Animator is simply one the best over the top horror/comedies in existence.

Okay now we got that out of the way, how does this second sequel stack up? While it is no great classic of cinema or even the horror/comedy oeuvre, Beyond Re-Animator is a fun chaotic romp. It contains one of the best prison riots ever filmed, (think Natural Born Killers mixed with Alien 3), the best performance by a severed penis since Street Trash, (I always wondered how severed penises stayed erect. I mean hydraulically speaking' well never mind), and another incredible over the top performance by Jeffery Combs.

Combs is simply the reason to see the film. His Dr Herbert West is older, wiser and as demented as ever. The movie, after a brief prologue, finds Dr. West doing time in one of those prisons Steven Segal is always trying to escape from. He is reanimating rats with homemade equipment in his cell. Soon another young protg comes along and it's time to continue his experiments on humans. West has found a way to stop his reanimated corpses from becoming flesh-eating zombies.

Does it work? Who are we kidding of course not. As a result severed limbs, heads, torsos, and other (see above) rule the day. Throw in gratuitous female nudity, scientific doublespeak, and day-glo green syringes and we have ourselves a Re-Animator movie. Now I can nitpick about the somewhat slow beginning, the bad dubbing, and the mishandling of the girlfriend/warden scenes. (The movie seems strangely halfhearted about the implicit sadism between the two characters. The director Brian Yunza needed the scenes to be firmer and more explicit.) But whom am I kidding. Beyond Re-Animator is surprisingly fun. Watching the severed limbs gambol about is a riot, and lead Jeffery Combs is so good one wonders why he doesn't make more movies.",1255910400,,1929,4.892966360856269

1922366,2,B0000DC12Z,"I had put off seeing Beyond Re-Animator for quite some time, combined by the fact I didn't want to see a neutered version on the Sci-Fi Channel and all the negative things I'd heard about it.  It's predecessor, Bride of Re-Animator, was in my opinion a solid sequel that maintained the heart of Stuart Gordon's original, but Beyond Re-Animator sadly doesn't echo that same feeling, even though Brian Yuzna is back at the helm here.  For starters, besides the great Jeffrey Combs returning as Herbert West, most of the rest of the cast is godawful.  Not to mention that the film's confusing script and moments where the low budget is ever apparent don't make things much better either.  Where Beyond Re-Animator shines however is with the makeup and gore effects by Screaming Mad George and his crew, who despite having such a low budget, manage to craft some effects work which actually look pretty good.  It's only too bad there aren't enough of them.  The effects, combined with a hysterical closing credits battle between a rat and a severed certain part of the male anatomy, are reason enough to see Beyond Re-Animator alone.  All in all, Beyond Re-Animator is certainly worth a look, but don't expect the same level of enjoyable depravity that came before it.",1220313600,,1264,4.824074074074074
1922367,4,B0000DC12Z,"Beyond Re-animater(2003) doesn't reach the classic status of the first two films in the series, but it's still a fun watch and worth the time of Re-animater fans. It definitley beats the heck out of the slew of horror remakes and sequels coming out of Hollywood that we've been subjected to in this decade. The plot pretty much follows the same path as the first two films, but this one takes place in a prison after Herbert West has been jailed after the Miscatonic Massacre instead os a hospital or cemetary which kinda takes a little of the atmosphere out of it. It does have flaws and sometimes the acting is a little wooden (with the exception of Jeff Combs), but like all Re-animater film's it's filled with interseting and gory special effects, nudity, more gore, and perverted jokes, so those minor complaints are forgiven. Recommended if you don't mind a little comedy in your horror.

*The music video on this disc is the most ridiculously hilarious thing I've ever seen in my life (see title^^), only Lions Gate would inlude such a thing as a special feature. Worth the price alone just for the laughs.",1207612800,2,1113,4.678571428571429

Okay, the acting may have not been Oscar worthy and the plot was kind of stupid, but it had Herbert West up to his experiments again.  If you want Gone With the Wind, why even bother reading reviews of this type of film.  If you want a camp culture classic with no social value and plenty of gore and pointless shots of the totally unsympathetic heroine's fishnets, this is it!

The original ""ReAnimator"" is a great flick to see if you want excellent and original gore effects as well as a creepy storyline, but this sequel just stinks.",1173744000,,384,4.202702702702703
1922370,1,B0000DC12Z,"What a mind-numbingly inept end chapter to a series that began with the greatest horror-comedy of all time, The Re-Animator.  Continuing in his deluded quest to claim the Re-Animator series for his own, and to convince us that he can direct, producer Brian Yuzna has managed the opposite.  Beyond Re-Animator merely confirms what was evident about the Yuzna-directed Bride of Re-Animator, that Yuzna knows nothing about directing actors and story.

As with Dagon, Yuzna seems to have secured financing from Spanish sources for this film.  Unfortunately, the problem is that they also tried to force in a mostly Spanish cast.  This is a story set in Massachusetts, for crying out loud -- why would the warden of the prison, the reporter coming to cover the story, the guards, and a good 90 per cent of the inmates all have Spanish accents?  It wouldn't be as howlingly horrible if these guys could act, but they can't.  Simon Andreu as Warden Brando and Elsa Pataky as love interest Laura Olney get the most screentime of anyone in the cast, but their acting is so bad, and their ADR-afflicted lines so glaringly off, that they manage to sink the film every time they open their mouths.  Yuzna seems to pick his leading ladies based on their willingness to take off their clothes (witness the gratuitous ""nurse nipple"" scene in this film, or Fabiana Udenio and Kathleen Kinmont in Bride of Re-Animator), and Pataky makes for one of the most unsympathetic love interests I can remember.

But even Pataky and Andreu pale in incompetence next to that blustery, seething mass of bad acting that is leading man Jason Barry.  Based on Yuzna's shoddy history with actors, one might be tempted to blame it on the director, but the fact is that in this film, Jason Barry is incapable of pulling off a single believable moment, basic elementary acting.  His every internal and external beat rings false, his dialogue delivery sounds like a cold reading, and even his basic body movements look like amateur theatre.  Most high-school students do better than this.  Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West, seasoned pro that he is, gamely plays along, but the script puts West's character so far off to the sideline in favour of the vomit-inducing Pataky-Andreu axis that Combs is unable to save this film.

On a strictly technical level, the cinematography looks good, the score is all right (though often too serious-minded for its own good), and the film doesn't look low-budget.  But when the ""story"" is such a mess and the actors so inept, no amount of slick lighting and camera moves can save a film.  Yuzna really should stick with producing, because on the Stuart Gordon-directed Dagon, at least there were some good moments.  But Beyond Re-Animator is beyond salvaging, possibly the worst film sequel I've ever seen, and way up there in the list of worst films I've ever subjected myself to.",1138406400,10,2877,4.862704918032787
1922371,5,B0000DC12Z,"Yes, the original Re-Animator and it's sequel, Bride of Re-Animator, are very cheesy and of course Beyond Re-Animator is probably the cheesiest by far, but I still love them! Jeffrey Combs was born to play Dr. Herbert West, forever on the quest of developing a re-animation agent.

We find Dr. West in prison in this chapter, for the atrocities that occurred in the last movie. He doesn't quite fit in with the other cell mates, he is too sophisticated and too strange a man. His dull prison life is soon interrupted when a new doctor, whose sister was killed by one of West's ""patients"", becomes part of the staff and wants Dr. West to assist him.

Together they assemble a lab and begin to develop the re-animation serum along with trying to perfect a new part of the process which transfers the missing essence of one's soul into the patient- hypothetically making them act more like people and less like zombies. Of course it doesn't quite work and chaos ensues.

Beyond Re-Animator is great fun, especially if you don't take it too seriously. It is easy to root for Dr. Herbert West as he tries once again to successfully re-animate the dead. Jeffrey Combs is brilliant and the prison makes for a great atmosphere. Rats are also featured quite hilariously in the movie, which is personally a favorite little creature of mine. There are a few extras on the DVD, including an awesomely bad music video called something like ""Re-Animate You Feet"" or ""Move Your Dead Bones"". If you like bad horror movies then this one is for you.",1138147200,4,1531,4.684014869888476
1922372,5,B0000DC12Z,"Being the third installment of the Re-Animator series, one would think this would either lack or not be as great as the first. Scary enough I thought it was better than the original, had better gore, and was a lot funnier. The movie had a lot of action, some nudity, alot of blood and some very well done humor, just like the rest.

Being what it is, the movie did lack logic, but hey-- it's Beyond Re-Animator. I particularly did not like the whole ""transferring of souls"" thing, it did give the franchise an ability to go a bit longer, and int he end end added alot of comedy-- particularly injecting a rat's soul into the warden.

After buying this I waited a long time to watch it, I really did not like Bride Of Re-Animator at all, and I figured this would be much worse. After the first 10-15 minutes of slowness the movie quickly picked up and was a riot until the very end. I really enjoyed it a lot, Jeffrey Combs, again does a great job as Herbert. His performance in Beyond Re-Animator reminds me alot of Bruce Campbell's Ash from The Evil Dead. From exploding bodies, decapitated heads, entrails, half-men half-rat hybrids, half bodies and cut-off penises the gore effects were great, I know I keep repeating that, but it's true.

West and Philip begin to experiment on animals including some prison inmates for both his re-agent and soul snatcher but unfortunately it becomes like old times in creating zombies.

Entertaining and enjoyable sequel to the 1985 horror comedy cult masterpiece!

Not as great as the original but just as fun as ""Bride of Re-Animator"", hopefully part 4 will be coming soon.

1922374,3,B0000DC12Z,"Sometimes utter silliness works, and you get a great cult film.  And other times it never quite clicks, and the result is a bemused, but not particularily enthralled viewer.  Hence, the original Re-animator was a delightful parody of the 60's horror film, as we followed young Dr. West (Jeffrey Combs) and his accomplice Dr. Howard Phillips (Jason Barry) through a trail of not quite failed resurrections.  While it would never be the equal of the Rocky Horror Picture Show it had that same madcap lack of good sense.

Beyond Re-Animator relies primarily on gory sight gags and less on any gesture at a meaningful plot.  There are only so many crazed-sadistic-prison-warden-beats-up-crazed-sadistic-psychotic-inmate scenes one can watch before one's eyes glaze over.  Dr. Wells has been (appropriately) locked up for his strange habits, one of which got loose from the morgue and killed Dr. Phillips' sister will trying to get a glass of milk.  Phillips, motivated by a desire to master life only surpassed by West, comes to the prison not to get even, but to pick West's brain.

Phillips falls for Laura Olney (Elsa Pataky) the inevitable gorgeous female and we are off to the prison riots.  Glowing green syringes fly one way, parts fly another, and soon just about everyone is either dead or er, dead.  Pataky is so good looking that you might actually miss the fact that she is otherwise as talented as a paperweight.  But who cares?  You are watching this for all the gore, violence, and hokey lines.  A little frontal nudity and soft core action are entirely appropriate for a film that makes no pretences at redeeming values.

There are some surprising special effects as various slices of people lock parts with other slices.  So be careful not to wince too often.  And the whole film becomes worth it as you watch the credits roll by as Ratty the Resurrected Rat enters a life or death struggle with the warden's willy.  This is definitely the silliest R rated film I've seen in years.",1126656000,2,1994,4.85207100591716

1922379,4,B0000DC12Z,"True, it doesn't attain the pinnacle that director Stuart Gordon reached with his RE-ANIMATOR (1985), but director Brian Yuzna's  second sequel, BEYOND RE-ANIMATOR (2003), is indeed way beyond his abysmal 1990 sequel BRIDE OF RE-ANIMATOR.

This time we catch up with the morbid Dr. Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs) at the prison in which he has been incarcerated for the criminal experiments in re-animating human corpses he conducted during his residency at the Miskatonic University Medical Center.  (The plot seems to ignore many events that occurred in BRIDE OF RE-ANIMATOR, especially the fact that West was killed during that film's climax.)  West has gained the confidence and the admiration of the prison doctor (Jason Barry), who agrees to let him use the prison infirmary to continue his morbid experiments.  At first the two only experiment on the literal prison vermin--the rats and mice and such.  But it isn't long before they start injecting West's dayglo-green juice into some of the human  denizens of the jail.

The plot of BEYOND RE-ANIMATOR is fairly tight and much more believable than the sequel that preceded it, and unlike that former film, the characters that populate this phase of perennial protagonist Herbert West's life are fairly interesting.  The acting in this flick is pretty good, too.  Jeffrey Combs is, as always, wonderful in the role of Herbert West, and Jason Barry does a pretty good job in filling the shoes of actor Dan Cain as West's new protg.  Elsa Pataky and Raquel Gribler--the only women around for most of the film--provide some eye candy for the males in the audience, though neither has the sex appeal of Barbara Crampton from the original RE-ANIMATOR.

Don't misunderstand--BEYOND RE-ANIMATOR certainly isn't Oscar material. But who cares?  Fans of these types of tongue-in-cheek horror and splatter films don't watch 'em to see Pulitzer-calibre scripts, great thespians, or high-art set design & special FX.  They watch flicks like this because they enjoy lots of fake blood and guts, topless or naked women, and black funeral-parlor humor, all without having to suspend their disbelief tooooo much.  And for the most part, this flick delivers.

The DVD from Lionsgate offers a fairly clean digital transfer of the print in anamorphic widescreen.  Bonus features include an audio commentary with director Brian Yuzna, a short making-of featurette containing interviews with the cast & crew, and a few other tidbits.  All in all, its worth the price of admission for those who enjoyed the original 1985 film.",1109203200,4,2557,5.165048543689321

It didn't have the same shock and atmosphere of the two earlier ones. Probably my biggest complaint was the character development.

1922382,3,B0000DC12Z,"This Halloween my boyfriend and I rented something seasonal -- *Beyond Reanimator.  We didn't get around to watching it right away; Blockbuster's newly lax late-regulations make our procrastination all the cheaper. And besides, what was the rush? How good could it possibly be?

Well, let's look at that small 4-letter word ""good"" for a minute, shall we? Traditionally-speaking, ""good"" tends to indicate something of quality, something of value -- or at least something of marginal usefulness. By this criteria, Beyond Reanimator hasn't really got much to offer. We were quite safe in assuming that it could gather dust on top of our DVD player for a week or two and we wouldn't be missing much.

However. If you were to redefine ""good"" to include such things as, ""features a kung-fu fight scene between a prison rat and a dismembered zombie erection,"" well then. Now you're talking. Never fear, because Beyond Reanimator has all your zombie genitalia  needs covered.

The ""Reanimator"" line is taken from H.P. Lovecraft's canon and centers around a mad scientist named Herbert West. Herbert sees death as a terminal illness, and in his own methodical, clinically-insane fashion, he seeks to cure it. He succeeds in restoring life to his unfortunate subjects, but he has a somewhat tougher time restoring them to rational behavior. Voila. Flesh-eating zombies, running amuck. In this third installment of the movie franchise, the flesh-eating, amuck-running zombies are largely confined to the prison where once again Dr. West is indulging his unholy experiments.

In addition to satisfying any mobile phallic curiosity you may harbor, Beyond Reanimator also fulfills your Recommended Daily Allowance of slutty nurses with visible granny panty-lines, orange-foam vomit, needles-the-size-of-railroad-spikes loaded with glowing green goo, the odd heaving nipple being bitten off, and nerdy mad scientists in jumpsuits.

Thank heavens this movie knows better than to take itself seriously. If you get hold of this DVD, be sure to watch the credits for a bonus shadow-puppet theater of prison rat karate taking on the free-range [organs]. Also, check the extras for the music video which (ostensibly) accompanies the film. Seriously. Watch it. I had to avert my eyes right about the time my boyfriend cried out, ""GAY FRENCH ZOMBIE MIMES! HAHAHAHAHAAH!""

Anyway, It's outrageously stupid, but kind-of fun. Don't expect too much of it and you won't be let down.",1099958400,25,2454,5.306701030927835

In fact, that (and the bad acting from most of the actors) keeps the movie from becoming truly great. Otherwise, it's a fun movie that never gets dull but never acheives greatness either.
The DVD itself is of good quality for such a movie. Good picture quality, sound is ok, there are a short making-of, a director commentary and trailers, and the music video is so bad it's a laugh.

  While as a standalone movie, it probably merits only a couple of stars, ""Beyond"" isn't targeted towards a generic audience, and such a rating would be inappropriate.

1922387,4,B0000DC12Z,"This movie had a very captivating plot and was overall a pleasure to view, however in the plot there were some pretty major holes and some of the acting was downright dreadful.
The plot is simple. A new doctor comes to work at the hospital where Dr. West is incarcerated. Howard the new doctor, and probably a new actor because his acting was downright dreadful and at times painful to watch (His reaction after the girl that he likes dies is just so fake); Dr. West and Howard then set up the lab again and chaos and misfortune ensues.
The gore is good. The reasons for the gore are not always good however. For example when Laura visits the one ressurected patient she walks up close and what not, knowing that he is dangerous. It just didn't make any sense. Another funny thing was that the nurse wore the old fashioned skirt, the kind you could rip off with a strong pull. Right...
However the violence was good and entertaining. The movie got straight to the point and never got off. From the very beginning there was murder, mayhem and chaos.

1922398,4,B0000DC12Z,"Ever since I began watching the original Re-Animator, I loved it.  Soon it became one of my favorite films, and I watched Bride of Re-Animator, which was a horrible sequel.  With average expectations I rented Beyond Re-Animator, and let me say I was blown away. It's been thirteen years since Herbert West's former assistant turned state's evidence against him, and sent the doctor to state prison.  Now, an eager young doctor wants West as his assistant in the prison after seeing West's work during the final Miskatonic misexperiment.  Soon, the doctor is the assistant and West is the doctor as he continues experimentation into re-animation of the dead: only this time, it's one step higher ... Jeffrey Combs is better than ever as the mad West, giving us a terrific performance.  The rest of the cast is very good as well; Brian Yuzna's direction has improved, and the script is great; there's also a cool score by Xavier Cappellas. Beyond Re-Animator is one of my favorite films, and one of the best horror films of 2003.  It features some quite funny comedy, mixed with great, gory horror in the tradition of the first film.  It is completely entertaining and features some very nice story ideas.  Think of it as Shawshank Redemption with re-animation and Dr. West - oh, forget it. I found that the film was almost as good as the first Re-Animator, and way above the Bride.  It's great to
have West back again.  And the ending is terrific - fans of the first film can sit back and smile with satisfaction ...I would highly recommend Beyond Re-Animator to any horror fan, and it is essential for fans of the firstfilm.  Easily one of my favorite horror films.  Be sure to stick around to see the hilarious end fight between a rat and the warden's severed limb.

Lightning and thunder materialize.  The mother (Barbara Elorrietta) in the house is killed by a jawless zombie (Angel Plana) as Howard watches in horror.  The zombie was another one of Dr. West's experiments, so Dr. West is arrested and put into the police car.  But before he leaves, the vital green luminous shot is left for the boy.  Thirteen years later, Howard (Jason Berry) is now a doctor and visis Dr. West in prison.  Dr. West still conducts his electrical shock experiments, but this time on rats.  When Howard shows Dr. West, the luminous shot he left behind thirteen years ago, he can't wait to see if the luminous serum still works.  Of course it does and so the campy zombie fun begins again.

1922401,3,B0000DC12Z,"Director Brian Yunza once again breathes life back into the Re-Animator series with this third installment, Beyond Re-Animator (2003).  Shot on location in Spain, the only character to make it from the original movies was Doctor Herbert West (Jeffery Combs).  While neither of the sequels was nearly as good as the first, this one, I thought, was a bit better than the last.

The film picks up where the last left off, with one of West's experiments attacking a young woman, which is witnessed by her younger brother.  The movie then fast-forwards 14 years, and we see West as an inmate in Arkham prison, performing strange experiments on rats, ones not involving bringing them back from the dead, but having something to do with removing strange energies from their bodies.  Seems West is trying to develop a means to not only re-animate the dead, but to also return the subjects back to their normal, mental states.  You see, the re-animation formula does work, but the subjects are usually mindless murder machines once brought back from the dead.  With his new research, West hopes to counteract this effect, and truly return his once dead subjects back to their normal, pre-par tem selves.  The young boy who so long ago saw his sister attacked by one of West's experiments is now a doctor, and has taken up residency at the prison where West is incarcerated, requesting that West be assigned to assist him.  This seemed like a set up so that the doctor could avenge his sister's death, but that wasn't how it was played out, which seemed weird to me.  Anyway, West, with the help of his new benefactor, begins his re-animation experiments anew, with a slight twist in his development of returning sentient consciousness to his subjects.

The movie does follow the format of previous films, with West blindly pushing forward with his experimentation, while his reluctant partner follows meekly along, and also a woman getting into the mix.  There were some new elements thrown in, but most of the movie stayed similar to the first two.  The script was a bit on the weak side, but director Yunza manages to keep things interesting with a copious amount of gore and splatter, but I am sure fans of the visceral would have wanted more.  West is always fun to watch, a man driven by his unrelenting desire for knowledge despite the consequences.  As the movie progresses, the inevitable prison riot breaks out, and various 're-animated' test subjects do many nasty things.  No big surprises in the end, but a suitable ending leaving the door open for another sequel.  There is some nice eye candy (women) to look at in this nearly all Spanish cast, but the acting skills in some of the cast members, men and women, are pretty poor.  The special effects, provided by Screaming Mad George, are nice and thoroughly grotesque, and the story does move along, so I would call this movie a successful sequel to the last one, especially since I really didn't have high hopes after seeing Bride of Re-Animator (1990) and hearing another sequel was on the way.

Special features include a director's commentary, a 'making of' featurette, a somewhat goofy music video featuring a techno song and some interesting visuals.  There are also a few trailers included, one for this movie and a couple more for other Lion's Gate releases.  All in all, not a bad follow up to the sequel, but still nowhere as good as the original film.  I do wish someone would release some of Brian Yunza's other films to DVD, like From Beyond (1986) or Crying Freeman (1995).

1922402,4,B0000DC12Z,"For fans of the Re-Animator series (and there are many) the wait is finally over.  13 years after directing Bride of Re-Animator Brian Yuzna returns with another satisfying sequel.  Beyond Re-Animator opens with an interesting 10-minute prologue that shows one of Herbert West's re-animated corpses getting loose and killing a teenage girl in the suburbs.  This sequel is set 13 years after those events where West is now in jail serving a sentence for conspiracy to commit murder.  A young doctor by the name of Howard becomes infatuated with West's work and wants to assist him to further his research which attempts to explain rational behaviour.
I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of this sequel especially considering the many negative reviews I read of this film.  Yes this was filmed in Spain on a limited budget and none of the same actors (except for Jeffrey Combs) return but what should we expect?  13 years had gone by since the last entry.  As long as Combs returns this series will do just fine.  He's great here as usual, in his trademark subdued style.  I marvel at his ability to play a role of someone who is stone-faced and dead serious but at the same time funny as hell.  Combs is surrounded by many other interesting characters including the young doctor, a pretty reporter and the requisite sadistic prison warden although none of them do nearly as good an acting job as he does.
Despite the lower budget he had to work with, Yuzna managed to make this film look very stylish (similarly to Stuart Gordon's Dagon).  Almost the entire movie takes place inside of a prison, lending the film a claustrophobic feel.  The last half hour is very fast paced and chaotic for as usual West's experiments go horribly wrong.  Re-Animated corpses are everywhere, inmates break loose of their cells as prison guards try to fight them off, the whole jail becomes a riot act.  Brian Yuzna certainly went all out with this finale.  This was a great film that is injected with all the right doses of gore, mayhem and humour that have been trademarks of the series.",1078272000,5,2081,4.741666666666666
1922403,3,B0000DC12Z,"This is a good movie in the good old 80's horror style with some hilarious episodes. It fits well to the two earlier Re-animator movies. But there's a big disadvantage that got it to loose two stars in my opinion. Either it is cut (god damn, are they really still cutting humour horror movies ? Greater horror !) or the great Brian Yuzna just put in less gore this time. Either case, this type of movies demands both much humour and much gore ! Brain Dead / Dead Alive is released uncut without problems. What's the f----n problem in doing the same with this movie ? Anyway, if you like re-animator 1 & 2 you must buy Beyond Re-animator and I thank Brian Y for doing it, but I sincerely hope that it will be released uncut very soon.

1922404,5,B0000DC12Z,"Herbert West is a man on the cutting edge of science. He's revolutionized thought as he's walked that fine line between experimentation and ""morality,"" bringing the dead back from the grave and all the while proving that demise is merely a disease and not a functional piece of punctuation added to the end of the living equation. He's taken that a step further, too, proving that life exists in every portion of the whole and that each specimen he collects can be introduced to his re-agent and returned from the grave. A combination of eyes and a few fingers, an organ stew with limbs; he's been there and he's done that with a type of ""morbid doodling"" that has been interesting to watch. And now, 13 years after he was imprisoned for his achievements, he's found the very thing that tells the cells of the body to grow.
While its not reflected here, this movie actually premiered on the Sci-Fi network months before it was released on VHS or on DVD, and many of these reviews are for it. I know that because I watched it myself, seeing the things that were cut out and left incomplete before checking this page for the DVD release date. When I did I also noticed the lack of gore in some places because it had been cut for television, the lack of a certain part of the male anatomy fighting a rat at the end because it could be considered tasteless, and I also noticed waves in the story. So, those were pitches for an incomplete viewing. Still, the negative reviews do have a point and that is that you might not enjoy this if you don't have the right mindset.
In order to actually enjoy yourself and what this brings to the table, you have to be able to do a few things, and one of those things is to tell yourself that this is the story of Herbert West. While many can't accept this fact, the first in the series has been done, is long gone, and its never going to be done again. Everything after-the-fact is going to seem like a sequel and you aren't going to find a carbon copy of the original. You also aren't going to get the same actors (save the most wondrous one, Jeffrey Combs, who is crucial to this series) and you are going to have some problems due to budget restraints. Still, if you liked the series itself, you should be happy if you've followed the story this far because the third chapter fits in rather well.
While the plot of the movie is a little sketchy if you catch bits and pieces of it and drifts a tad when you get toward the end, its actually not that bad of a theory when you get down to it. As Dr. West points out, the human body loses three to four grams of weight when it dies. According to him, this NPE, or Nano Plasmic Energy, is the very building block of what makes life ""alive."" It tells the cells to grow, making the byproduct who and what it is because it could very well be the component many dub a soul. Accordingly, NPE can overcome many of the problems Dr. West has had in the past with the reanimated monstrosities he's created, allowing him to endow true life to the things he's returning to this side of living. It works better than the Thorazine he's been using to sedate them, after all, or the straight jackets he's used to keep them in check. The only thing is that he gets excited and, as everyone knows, nothing works exactly as the scientist pictures it because this always has been an on-going process
As far the other portions of the movie goes, it goes from ""not that bad"" to ""impressive, considering the budget.""
As far as the gore, there are some good examples of prosthetic effects - considering the amount of gore has been stepped down. You have some blood that rushes out really well, some bodies stripping themselves down to base elements, and you have other ""portions"" popping up. You do have some cheaper CGI sometimes taking up residence, too, but those aren't really a bother because this is somewhat of a comedy founded in the science of slapstick horror. Besides, a male portion of the anatomy fighting off a rat at the end is pretty funny stuff.
As far as acting goes, you get what you expect. You have some people that are bad, the great Jeffrey Combs that is always on because he is Herbert West to everyone following the series, and you have some people in the middle. Still, your setting, a jailhouse, allows some of that to be overlooked because you aren't exactly expecting a drove of great people in that place.
And, as far as the little Lovecraft joke in the name Howard Phillips, I got a laugh.
Also, watching the commentary ""special feature"", I noticed that IT'S A CUT MOVIE. With some scenes missing that you are shown in the director's commentary, you know it was cut before having an American release That's always sad, too, and it also shows what a translation to English will often get you - despite the R rating.
If you want to gage whether or not you might like it, you should simply ask yourself what you thought of the last two as a whole and then go from there. You should also ask yourself what you want to see in the movie, what its all about, and if you're going to see the undead or something more try to take place. As I said before, it is the story of Herbert West thirteen years after he's gone to jail, his partner now turned state's evidence, so things are going to be different. Still, Jeffrey Combs is Jeffrey Combs and that, at the end of the day, that sells itself to me.",1075420800,45,5379,4.374625374625374

Plot: After the mess in Bride of Re-Animator, Dr. Herbert West is sent to jail for his  re-animation crimes, but that hasn't stopped him from continuing his experiments,which consist of rats and cochroaches. Enter a young doctor,Howard Phillips, from West's past who wants to help Herbert continue his re-animaton work. Of course, West jumps at this opportunity and soon the two are working secretly on new re-agent serums. But trouble begins when a female reporter named Laura, falls for Howard, but also has a secert agenda of her own, a sadistic warden, plus  prision inmates who have a grudge against West and would like nothing more then to see our favorite mad scientist dead. All this leads to a bloody climax.
Review: The first words that popped into my head when reviewing this movie is disappointing. I waited thirteen years just to see Herbert West in prision. It feels like a filler sequel ( a sequel inbetween sequels), they should have went with Joe Penny's original script that dealt with a serial killer and had Dan Cain returning ( another big disappointment,no Bruce Abbott),instead we get a rehash of the original.

  The romantic love triangle between Howard, Laura and the warden (he has the hots for the Laura)is nothing more then a third-rate photocopy of the love triangle between Dan Cain, Megan Halsey and Dr. Hill. The romance between Howard and Laura is laughable and forced,it also takes up too much time from the movie. Their's also other rehashes abound this stinker of a movie, Howard Phillips is nothing more then a bland Dan Cain carbon copy with a incestuous twist. His logic also made no sense what so ever, he wants to help Dr. West, but at same time he keeps screaming it's wrong what their doing and the  warden is nothing more then a cartoon version of Dr. Hill. The less said about Laura, the better.
  The only thing that's new in the movie is, West has found a way to control the re-animated experiments called NPE (Nano-Plasmic Engery), it puts the personality of one  person into a another ,so the re-animated subject isn't a raving thing. But even that dosen't make any sense. Dr. Hill or the detective in part two didn't need the NPE and they kept their personalities. Even some of zombies in this one never get the NPE, and yet they have their own personalties. So, basically, some of the Re-Animator rules are thrown out the window.
  If your expecting a huge zombie showdown in jail,look again it's not happening here. There are just so many opportunities blown here. Even the gore is toned down from first two movies. Nothing in this movie can top the suspensful cat attack in the basement, Melvin the re-animated's attack in the morgue,Dr Hill's head getting chopped off or in Bride of Re-Animator,the finger eyeball spider thing, a dog has a hand where his paw should be, or the mismatched human bodypart monsters that want revenge on Dr. West and those are just a few highlights from both movies.
  The only saving grace is Jeffrey Combs, he still has what it takes to play Herbert West. Too bad no one else in this movie is up to his standards. Jason Barry who plays Howard, like I was saying above is blander then can be and has zero chemstry with Combs. Simon Andreu is way too over the top as the warden,  How am I supposed to take a cartoon seriously? Elsa Pataky's acting is so bad,it's not even funny. The rest of acting by the Spanish extras (this is supposed to take place in America? Yeah, right) is godawful.

  Brian Yuzna's direction is slick and it looks better then your average direct-to-video but tone of the first two movies is gone. The atmosphere is hugely lacking until the last 25 minutes. Because of the prision setting,Photographer Andreu Reubes can't go crazy with any kind lighting until the finale. Believe me, this ruins the movie too.
  The only good thing about this movie besides Combs is the music. Xavier Cappellas does a good job with his Spanish orchestra. In fact, if Beyond has anything over Bride, it's the musical score. Don't get me wrong I think Richard Band's electronic score for Bride wasn't bad, but Cappellas's score for this one is better.
  The only reason to watch this turkey is for Combs, a couple gore scenes and  to listen to the music score. Other wise this isn't even worth watching. The series is now on life support. One more bad sequel and it will be D.O.A.
  The DVD contains a widescreen transfer, Dobly Digtial 5.1, a commentry by Director Brian Yuzna, a music video(which is knee-slappingly awful), a behind the scenes featurette(better turn on the subtitles unless you speak Spanish)and a trailer.

It basically picks up right where Re-Animator left off, so no real need to see Bride of Re-Animator if you haven't (which, by the way was horrible in my opinion).  Dr. West is sent to prison for his crimes, and in prison is where the story takes place.

After 13 years of passing time and years of hoping for some continuation, finally we have it! It's sad not to have David Gale (god rest his soul) or Bruce Abbot, but Brian Yuzna has made a better sequel than his own Bride of Re-Animator. There are flaws for sure. Example: Arkham Mass. has the electric chair on death row? And many limitations with shooting in Spain but, the wild tone and hilarious finale are not to be missed. Hopefully House of Re-Animator goes into production soon with the planned Bruce Abbot returning. Highly recommended!",1072569600,,639,4.663716814159292

1922413,4,B0000DC12Z,"This movie takes place 13 years after ""Bride of Re-animator"". The movie starts with a little boy's big sister being killed by one of West his re-animated corpses. West is arrested and we move on 13 years later. He is still experimenting in prison, but of course he doesn't have the necessary ingredients to make his famous green serum that re-animates the dead. In comes Dr. Howard Philips(the same person who's sister was killed,13 years ago) and he still happens to have the injection needle full with the green serum which he found 13 years ago, after West was arrested. West of course takes this opportunity to start experimenting anew. Howard becomes his new assistent. Those 13 years, West has been working on extracting the lifeforce out of several rats, and thinks he might have found the solution to stabilize the corpses after they have been re-animated(after which they always become very aggresive and lose almost all intelligence) with his special serum. Does it work? Yes and no... The movie starts slowly(but is never boring), but builds up to a terrific climax. I really enjoyed this one. I won't say much about the rest of the movie because I don't want to spoil all of the gory fun. Although not as good as the first re-animator, this is still an excellent sequel.

1922416,3,B0000DC12Z,"The original Re-Animator is deemed a classic of the genre, though to be honest, my admiration for it is only mild. Sure, it boasted a terrific performance from Jeffrey Combs, delivered tons of memorable gore, and featured a deliciously nude Barbara Crampton, but I always found the pacing a little off and I felt the movie took to long to get to the all-out carnage I expected. Is Beyond Re-Animator a ""better"" movie? Maybe not, but I enjoyed it more, and it's a rare sequel that actually remains true to its predecessor's roots.
Set thirteen years after the events of Bride of Re-Animator, Doctor Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs) is in prison for his crimes (makes you wonder what he was charged with, resuscitating the dead?), but the arrival of a new doctor, Howard Phillips (Jason Barry), proves interesting to West's studies. Apparently, Phillips was a first-hand witness to the results of West's re-agent years ago, and has arrived to work with him on perfecting the formula. Their studies further progress to the discovery of an electrical phenomenon that could restore a dead person back to its normal state, sans the rage that typically accompanies their revival. But not everything goes to plan, thanks to a nosy reporter (Elsa Pataky) Phillips is seeing and the sadistic prison warden (Simon Andreu) who's catching whiff of West's plans.
Like the previous movies, Beyond Re-Animator isn't plot driven, it's meant to play as a rollercoaster ride of extreme gore and dark comedy. The grue is even better than its predecessors and there are a couple of laughs to be had (even if they're also simultaneously wince-inducing). The f/x stand out, with loads of memorable gore effects; there's a jawless zombie in the opening, a prisoner who overdoses on the re-agent and literally explodes, and my personal favorite, a prisoner missing the lower half of his body who's lassoed around by West himself. Hilarious.
Brian Yuzna is confident at the helm, giving the movie a slick look and feel, while maintaining a fast pace that nicely builds and rarely lets up. That said, the film is still packed with flaws, a lot of it pertaining to the repetitive nature of the story, which is basically ""kill person, revive person, then kill person again,"" a cycle that endlessly repeats itself. The script brings up the topic of the electrical phenomenon, but doesn't really do anything with it. Are we supposed to assume that (spoiler) the reporter is somewhat possessed by the warden because she was given his NEE? There also aren't as many ""zombies"" as the first film, or at least not as many who are in any position to harm our protagonist (there's a scene where West discovers quite a few undead bodies hanging from the ceiling)
Jeffrey Combs-whose character actually starts to look a little normal compared to some of the nutsos here-is as delightful to watch as ever, and is really the one element that holds the film together in between the gore-soaked scenes. Jason Barry is flat and unconvincing as Phillips, whose decidedly complex character is clearly out of the actor's range. Elsa Pataky is very pretty, but has a hard time passing off as an American journalist (her Spanish accent slips through more than once). The only other worthy performer of note is the foxy Raquel Gribler, playing the prison nurse who reveals a LOT of cleavage and wears an almost see-through uniform. Pure eye candy, but a successful one at that.
Beyond Re-Animator works simply because it's a lot of fun, no more and no less, and whether or not you enjoy it depends on whether you mind (literally) eye-popping violence. The ending leaves things open for a sequel, but I'm actually looking forward to the further misadventures of Herbert West. Let's just hope the next sequel boasts a tad more plot and variety to go along with all the fun, gory mayhem.",1065225600,12,3829,4.865237366003063

8000433,5,B0000DC12Z,"The Re-Animator films have never been ones that are grounded in good taste, but still the quality of the story in HP

Lovecraft has been a great touchstone. Jeffrey Combs has essentially been the face of Herbert West, and Stuart Gordon has

been the directorial heart. Combs has read the  HPL stories on audiobooks, so I presume he knows the material well. The

other important factor is that Combs has the acting skill to convey West to and for the audience. Whilst the film directed

by Yuzna is mostly good, it is not up to Gordon's par, since Yuzna specifically goes outside of the HPL universe with only

Herbert West as the anchor. Combs delivers West as per usual. The only other big plus is the practical FX by screaming mad

George. The extras are revealing but in a not so great way. It is worth a watch for the Re-Animator fans , but the finesse

Gordon delivered is lost by Yuzna. The mostly spanish crew deliver a great body of material for a good director to work

with, unfortunately Yuzna is at the helm, and the so-called humour is ham-fisted when not delivered by Combs. I can only

look forward to the Original films re-worked forspecial editions. 5 Stars for Combs, the work by Yuzna barely goes above

8000438,4,B0000DC12Z,"i love the re-animator films, and have been on a huge jeffrey combs jag as of late, so i decided it was time to revisit beyond re-animator, a film i did not care for upon its' release. this time, however, older, wiser, i discovered how very, very wrong i was: beyond re-animator is an entertaining, suitably bizarre ride through the spook house that is herbert west's brilliant, demented mind. the movie is smart, and, save for a few minor issues, a more than worthy end cap to the re-animator series.

having loved the first movie, and been more than satisfied by bride, i especially appreciated herbert west's progressive arc in beyond. in re-animator, dr. west is simply trying to re-animate dead tissue, and in the second, he is trying to actually give life to something new, something he made from, um, ""scratch"" i guess would be the best way to put it. here, locked away in prison, herbert has an opportunity to really consider where his experiments have gone wrong (when will you realize you must always strap the corpses down before re-animating them, herbie, as you know they coming back violent and angry): everybody comes back without the inner spark of life that makes us truly alive. we need our souls, and herbert west has figured out how to give them to us, scientifically of course.

this element is clever and believable, and actually does provide a (semi)scientific explanation of the soul, a point that provides some humorous fodder for Herbert and his new apprentice, well-meaning, dan cain-ish doctor, howard phillips (get it?) to discuss while they resurrect someone important to the latter's heart. it's nice to see that in these movies, each installment advances us a a little further.

jeffrey combs is, of course, brilliant. he's a teensy bit more reserved and has less youtful arrogance, as is oft to happen to any of us we get older. but don't worry; jeffrey is still possessed of the dry wit and ultra confident air that allows dr. west to embrace his god complex, which he does and then some. it's obvious that he enjoys this role, and it's kind of criminal that we haven't seen him in it in over thirteen years. jeffrey needs dr. west, and visa versa. jason barry does a great job assuming the role of emotional assistant--just what west needs, someone who can be emotionally manipulated, but also who happens to be in a respected position as to be useful--and, like bruce abbott's dan cain before him, you just know it aint gonna end well for ole doc phillips. elsa pataky is absolutely wonderful as laura, a reporter investigating the prison, and she is a great sport, playing her character with wild variances, and getting into the gooey, grizzly, sexy spirit of this franchise. she, like many a brian yuzna heroine, is gorgeous and grotesque, and ultimately very sympathetic.

while this movie is certainly goofy, the spanish cast and crew do excellent wortk, and really, my only issue with it is the campy and overdone sadistic prison warden (wardens always suck), who, i feel, harms the credibility of many of his scenes. he's not quite david gale, if you know what i mean. this isn't to say the actor is bad, i just didn't think the character was very good.

yuzna, as always, acquits himself nicely, and directs another in a long line of heart-felt, macabre romantic horror (bride of reanimator, return of the living dead 3), and does so simultaneously with and without restraint, which is, imho, a delightful quality.

watch this movie; it's not getting any fresher;-)",1473638400,,3508,4.799668874172186
