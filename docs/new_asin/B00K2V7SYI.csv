8655470,4,B00K2V7SYI,"I was fortunate to see this play at the 2013 Boston International Film Festival.  The synopsis caught my eye and I made a point to see this.  Out of the films I had seen at that particular festival (I was a filmmaker/participant that year), this was the one I had the most fun watching.  I am very happy for Sloan Copeland and all involved that this film is finally available for all to see.

*Wet Behind the Ears* tells the story of Samantha Phelps, a recent college graduate who is trying to start her adult life and yet has trouble getting it started.  The biggest obstacle for her is obtaining a job.  Her age and lack of experience keeps her not only from what seems to be an ""ideal job"" but soon *any* job.  It gets to such a low point that she takes up a job working at a family friend's ice cream shop.  In the mean time, her friend Vicky, who does have a job and wants Samantha to join her as a roommate is dealing with her own work difficulties and finding a roommate to help pay for the apartment.

The young adult ennui has been covered before by other films such as *Clerks*, *Reality Bites* and *Kicking and Screaming* (a personal favorite ... and it's Noah Baumach 1995 film).  This is the first film - if not that, then amongst the first - to show that ennui in present times as the national economy is still malfunctioning and, for young people, it is increasingly difficult to get any kind of jump start on life.  It portrays this malaise with both good humor and sympathy.  Without giving too much way with the plot, the end lesson learned is that you and you alone are starting your life and no one else can do it for you.

For an independent feature and only a few to no film credits for all involved, it was a well-made effort.  The writing is quite good (a little shaky at times but nothing too glaring) and the performances were solid all around.  Considering the limited resources, it was presented in the best way possible.

For a home video release, there should be a bit more whether it is a commentary track or additional interviews to introduce us to everyone involved.  But also the film should speak for itself and it does it well.

I recommend this especially either to recent college graduates or even ""older"" recent graduates (from 2005 onward) as a reminder that you are not alone in the struggle and there can be a way to get through it.",1420588800,,2374,4.3690205011389525
