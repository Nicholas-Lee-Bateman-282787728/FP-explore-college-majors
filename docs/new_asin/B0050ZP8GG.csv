4518956,5,B0050ZP8GG,"This great American classic collection is an extraordinary find. All of the episodes are in Black and White and the picture is very clear. They look exactly as I remember them when I was growing up. One of the reasons why I purchased this set as opposed to the many others out there is that this set contains the 88th episode ""Scallawags"" which does not appear on any of the other sets. It is a great one and really makes the collection complete. If you enjoy watching The Little Rascals you will definitely enjoy this set. I highly recommend it.",1319241600,6,546,4.47
4518957,5,B0050ZP8GG,"This set has the best picture quality I have ever seen in a vintage film. The on-screen menus make it very easy to navigate from one episode to another. The packaging and artwork are very nice. It is exactly what is pictured in the ad along with three additional vintage photos on the back cover.
It brings back all the memories of the original films. You will not be disappointed. This set is, without a doubt, a true bargain.",1307750400,17,427,4.417721518987341
4518958,1,B0050ZP8GG,"With all the five star reviews, I was fooled into purchasing this 6 DVD set. First and foremost these Little Rascals episodes ARE NOT in any way restored or remastered. (The back of the box says they are ""rare and remastered"" which is total BS!) My old Little Rascals VHS tapes had far superior picture quality then these cheap ""bootleg"" quality DVDs. Most of the films look dark and blurry, and many show lots of scratches and film artifacts. It's hard for me to accurately describe how horrendous some of these episodes look! The sound quality is actually good, which is a bit surprising since the video quality is so awful. I bought this set to replace my worn out and scratched ""Cabin Fever"" DVD set, which may be the best version available. (now long out of print and hard to find) Save your money and wait for an authorized and properly remastered set to be released.",1456099200,7,873,4.56687898089172
4518959,5,B0050ZP8GG,"Haven't watched all of them yet, but ohhh the ones we have seen !  So many of them, finally in one collection. A must for any one who understands the significance of the word ""remarkable"" .",1454457600,,189,4.25

4518977,5,B0050ZP8GG,"The quality of these DVD are on par with any others from that time period. Others have said that the quality and sound are grainy and scratchy. I watched the reruns on TV in the 60's and 70's and I can tell you that the quality is a big improvement over what was broadcast back then. Of course I didn't go into this purchase with the expectation that these would be the same quality as the King of Queens DVD set. The technology simply was available when these were originally recorded. One other reviewer here said that they were looking to restore memories and that was my focus also. If you're looking for superior packaging, lot's of liner notes and interviews with the original stars you should look elsewhere. If your looking to break out the milk and cookies and remember simpler times, this DVD set delivers!",1441152000,,816,4.557823129251701

4518986,5,B0050ZP8GG,"This set is simply the best. I thought I would never see these movies in their entirety again.
While other sets I have viewed claim to be complete and uncut, there were many scenes that were edited out.
All of the movies in this set are complete. Nothing has been edited or cut out.
If you are looking for the original uncut and unedited black and white versions of these movies with great picture quality then this is the set to buy. Im sure that you will enjoy every minute of these priceless classics.",1424995200,13,504,4.372340425531915
