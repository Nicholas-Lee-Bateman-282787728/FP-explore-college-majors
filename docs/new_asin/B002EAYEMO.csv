3916615,2,B002EAYEMO,"This is the kind of thing you usually find on YouTube. YouTube is full of endless zombie short subjects and short films from all over the world, and they just keep on coming. Some have even worse production values than this effort and some are very professional productions. I've seen scores of them and make allowances for amateur vs professional capabilities (a common mistake in watching these is the way some viewers freak out when the usual cable TV and Hollywood production values are missing). As long as you take into consideration that the film probably has a low budget and is full of people who have never acted, they can be fun. I really enjoy many of the productions made by kids and teens because they have a naive and innocent charm to them mixed with a wild enthusiasm for the genre.

But I can't extend that to this group who are too old to make such allowances. The camera is always dim and dingy, but it was made in 2009, before everyone got their hands on HD equipment. Still, it's hard to look at for a long time. the acting is what you'd expect from young non actors. I've seen worse but it's not very convincing. The whole thing centers on a group of strangers making it to a ""safe room"" during a sudden zombie apocalypse. Now this leads you to expect a panic room equipped with food, water, cameras and vault-like security. But no, it's all mostly shot in a rec room of a church and school complex that is empty of everything one would need, has flimsy wooden doors and windows! One girl spends most of her time looking out a window. If you're going to portray this as a safe house at least put something in front of the windows.

And it's all like that. I'm giving it a very generous two stars because I know these people worked hard, learned lines and recruited a fair number of friends and siblings to be zombies. They even reportedly spent $1200 making it. But it just didn't work for me. See it if you must.",1475625600,2,1936,4.405027932960894

8367323,1,B002EAYEMO,"Kristan Jakubczyk you have failed your Acme High School Cinema final. If I were not on a personal quest to watch every zombie movie on Amazon, Netflix, and Hulu I would have turned it off after the first ten minutes which seemed like an hour. Seriously folks, nothing good to say about this one. Even for a super low budget this was a stinker. If you and your friends want to play Mystery Science Theater, then this is the movie to watch. There would be a laugh a minute.",1481760000,,471,4.303370786516854
