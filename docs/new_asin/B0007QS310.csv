2232301,3,B0007QS310,"I've heard of ""super happy funtime"" in some anime series before, but the Teen Titans series have really stretched the limit there.

This DVD features the second half of the Titans' first season.  The episodes that I liked include the one where Starfire and Raven get placed in each others' bodies, the one where Robin becomes a villan, and the two-parter where Robin becomes Slade's apprentice.  The others... eh, not so much.  The appearances of the others seem pretty out of whack, like any other cartoon show.

There's not much in bonus features in this volume compared to the first one.  Just an interview with J-pop band PuffyAmiYumi on the theme song, the ""Trident's Clone Challenge"" game, and some bonus webisodes that requires a DVD-ROM.

Plus, don't get me wrong here, I seem to have developed an ""inference"" here.  When you hear the theme song in Japanese(the band's native tongue), you'll know that something weird, wild, and wacky is going to happen in that episode.  A really good example is the ""Mad Mod"" episode(formerly ""Detention"") with the emphasis on the MAD.  Keep this in mind when you watch the series on TV.

And, hey, coming this fall the first half of the Titans' second season will be on DVD.  I think it's entitled ""Fear Itself"", which is based on the episode where Raven admits she is afraid of some things.",1117843200,3,1335,4.756521739130434
2232302,5,B0007QS310,"Vol 2, Switched features the second half of the original season, and most of the episodes on this disk are classic.

Raven fans will want to check out Switched, in which Raven and Starfire switch bodies, while the other members have their minds trapped inside puppets.  The girls must work together to save the boys despite being stuck in each other's form.  Although both get equal screen time, Raven noticeably has a bit more importance in the episode.  Props to both Hynden Walch and Tara Strong for delivering a great performance as Starfire and Raven, respectively.

Car Trouble has the return of annoying pest in Gizmo.  In it, Cyborg builds a hi-tech car, but it winds up getting stolen by some thieves... then Gizmo steals it from them.  Cyborg(with help from Raven) attempts to take it back.  Raven also shows a slightly lighter and friendlier side in this episode.  A cute show, especially if you're a fan of either character(me being a fan of both, I enjoyed it quite a bit).

Mad Mod has the Titans get captured by... Mad Mod.  They wind up having to deal with his psycadelic ""school"" of death.  The episode is pretty much an excuse to be crazy, and you'll either love or hate this one.

Deep Six has the Titans facing a new foe called trident.  Due to his underwater abilities Beast Boy has to face him alone, but luckily, there's also underwater ally Aqualad to help.  Shame I didn't care for this one.  Beast Boy was just too much of a jerk, and Aqualad was boring.

The other 3 episodes, Masks, and Apprentice, pts. 1 and 2, deal with the main plotline of season 1: Robin vs. Slade.  Masks sets the events of Apprentice up, as Robin must battle Slade(brilliantly voiced by Ron Perlman, who was also Clayface in both Batman: TAS and Justice League) as well as his own inner demons, especially when Slade reveals just what he wants.  These episodes are fantastic, and give the series some nice depth and even a bit of darkness, which may surprise a regular viewer who expects this just to be a regular ""kiddy"" show.

Sadly, I don't know of any special features confirmed yet.  The first disk had an excellent look behind the creation of the original 1980's comic, so I wonder if there will be anything along those lines for the second volume.  I wouldn't mind if there was an interview with the voice actors of the show.  However, in typical with the ""DC comics kids"" releases I won't be surprised if there is another ""interactive"" game for the kids.  Overall, these are some classic episodes from the series, and fans will likely enjoy this DVD.",1108857600,37,2560,4.600441501103753
2232303,5,B0007QS310,"As a ninteen year old male, I'm probably among the lowest demographic who watches this show.  Nonetheless, I can say this is one of the best animated series to be released in a long time.  This DVD perfectly shows everything that Teen Titans is... the dark, the funny, the middle of the line, and the bad filler.  I'm also happy to say that seven episodes are on this DVD, so you're not getting ripped off here (ahem, Trigun).

The pinnacle of this DVD is the last five episodes, which are simply among the best of the whole season.  They showcase everything that makes TT so good.  Let's get to it.

-Masks and Apprentice part 1/2 are the last three episodes of the main ""Slade"" story arc.  These are absolutely excelent episodes, with some grade A dialogue, a interesting little story, and a REALLY strong depiction of something called OBSESSION.  Robin really shows us what he's like, and the character development is top notch.  Nice music and action too.  This is the dark, and I love it.

-Mad Mod is totally silly.  I can't say much about it, but there are tons of in-jokes to go around that might slip by you the first time.  Anyways, it's one of the funnier things I've seen lately, and it's just so delightfully nonsensical.  If you want mindless humor, this is it.  Funny writing, once again.  This is the funny, and I love it.

-Car Trouble and Switched are right between.  They aren't silly, neither are they dark.  It's just two well done episodes that make a point.  They've got great writing, and some good character development.  Sadly, the villans are awful, but they don't bring down the episodes too much.  This is the middle of the line, and I like it.

-Deep six is awful.  Not funny, not interesting, not making a good point.  This is the bad filler, and I don't like it.  Thankfully, it's only one episode on a disc of seven (where many other anime DVD's have 3-5 eps) so it's no big deal.  The show as a whole as a few too many of these episodes, and these are what brings the show down the most.

So there it is.  If you could only buy one DVD of the whole series, this should be it.  Great DVD for a good series that anyone can enjoy, for a good price.",1108425600,8,2179,4.3725

8050618,3,B0007QS310,"Teen Titans: Season One: Vol. 2 - ""Switched"" contains seven full episodes and a lot of extras.  I only rate this DVD three stars because how much of Beast Boy's drool and Starfire's annoying chatter can you take?  Beast Boy drools so much, especially in Episode Four, it will make you sick.

And since when did Starfire become superstrong?  I thought she could fly and fire starbolts.  Isn't that power enough?

Episode One - ""Switched"" - The boys are captivated with little marionette versions of themselves mysteriously received in the mail.  Raven and Starfire have puppets too, but aren't as enthralled.  While they sleep, the Puppetmaster puts his plan into gear.  Robin, BeastBoy, and Cy's spirits are trapped in the marionettes, while the Puppetmaster controls their real bodies.

Only the girls are not trapped in the puppets - but they are trapped in each other's bodies.  Two very different girls must race to understand each others powers - and each other - before the Puppetmaster's switcheroo spell becomes permanent.

Episode Two - ""Deep Six"":  A new Titan is introduced: the dashing Aqualad.  The egoistic sea dweller must work closely with a team - something he has never done before - to defeat the sea-villian Trident, who has stolen some toxic waste.

Episode Three - ""Masks"": Compelling episode with an unusual twist.  Robin falls deeper and deeper into his obession with finding and unmasking the arch-villian Slade.  All this while the team needs his help contending with a new bad guy named Red X.

Episode Four - ""Mad Mod"": Some editor was really missing his sixties days.  The villian Mad Mod is one strange dude.  Foiling the Titans turns him on.  He thinks it's groovy to teach them a lesson to mind their own business.  In his copacetic house, things go from psychedelic to a bad trip for our heroes.

Adults might get a kick out of Mad Mod, but kids will not relate to him.  I felt very strange for a long time after seeing this episode.

Episode Five - ""Car Trouble"": Cyborg builds a car, and it is his baby - but it gets stolen.  Cy and Raven go after the thieves.  Kind of a boring episode, although it is cute to see Cy and Raven work together.

Episodes Six and Seven - ""The Apprentice"": Someone wants Robin for his apprentice - and it's not Donald Trump.  This two part episode is dark and compelling, like all Robin-Slade episodes.  We finally see what Slade's goal has been, and it is a horrifying one.  It seems Slade may win after all.

Starfire has never looked more beautiful than in one scene in ""The Apprentice"", when she is confronting Robin on the roof and telling him to stop.

One thing I love about this DVD is that there is dubbing in Spanish AND French.  Starfire is much less annoying en francais.  And Raven's voice in Spanish is a kick.  Here, her voice matches how weird she looks and is.  I like the voice!

Extras are bountiful.  There is a new cartoon you can watch and go online to rate.  I liked it - it was s'ok.  The best extra is an extended interview between Robin and Puffy Ami Yumi.  Robin asks them lots of questions, and the girls give great answers.  It is great when they say Robin looks like Christmas!",1127174400,5,3172,4.589285714285714
8050619,4,B0007QS310,"We had a long car trip to get to our vacation destination, so that gave us the excuse to buy this DVD.  We mainly bought it for our 5 year-old, but I enjoy it as much as he does.  Teen Titans is one of my favorite programs to watch.

My son enjoys the Switched episode best.  The best part about that episode is learning more about Raven and Starfire.  Their bodies get switched and they have to learn about each other in order to defeat the puppet master.  These characters are so opposite that it makes it interesting to see how they handle the challenge.

My favorites are the Slade episodes, and Red X. I think the villian Slade is a deeper and more challenging character than most.

Overall a good DVD.  Once you try one, you will want to get all the Teen Titans DVD's.  I know I do.",1126310400,,788,4.193333333333333
