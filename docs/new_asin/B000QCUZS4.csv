I bought this DVD 2 years ago and to this day, I haven't completed watching it. Not worth the money!",1286841600,,249,4.1020408163265305

8195787,3,B000QCUZS4,"Interesting, but still shallow. At no point during the film is it evident why the female love interest is in Cuba at all - possibly facing a huge fine on her return to the US for no apparent reason whatsoever, why she puts up with the guy rather than spending time exploring Cuba, presumably why she came.
And at the end of the film one still wonders who this Cuban-roots denying American is, why he is in Cuba in spite of his Cubaphobia, why his Cuban taxi-driver can understand his English without ever uttering a word in the tongue and most of all why on earth he wanted to commit suicide.
Having said that, on a surreal level the film works, but that there have been plenty (!) of film documents about the Malecon. Everyone who knows Havana will wonder why on earth he takes a taxi -after walking for hours on end - from one point at the Malecon to another, his hotel -  a mere two minutes walk. The film is remedy for Havana nostalgia, although only 2% of its territory  ever gets explored. Well, buy it, but do not expect too much. One annoying thing though, why is the English dialog not sub-titled into Spanish as it is the other way around. I had specifically bought the DVD with the intention of taking it to Cuba. It also annoys me that foreign film makers hardly ever bother to leave the comfort zone of the Cuban capital when 80% of the Cuban reality lies outside its boundaries.",1187136000,,1392,4.370656370656371
8195788,5,B000QCUZS4,"Obviously you see Cuba and it's absolutely stunning, but story is also amazing.  What a highly unusual romantic drama that takes really has you look at who and what you acknowledge in your life and what you let take control of you.  The pointless harboring of anger or loss is so palpable.  First all U.S. team to shoot a narrative fiction film in Cuba in like 47 years...Extraordinary. Stellar in look.  The cinematography is top notch.  Luis Moro is definitely the treat in this film. His performance is incrediblely impressive. I highly suggest picking it up :-)",1178841600,4,565,4.783505154639175
