8236594,3,B00101ZDKK,Strange film.  Saw both Yellow and Blue years ago.  A bit of a protest with sex thrown in.,1518393600,,90,3.9444444444444446
8236595,5,B00101ZDKK,"This subtitled 1967 Swedish movie, written and directed by the late Vilgot Sjoman and starring Lena Nyman, is worth taking a look at, especially if you want to understand the general ambiance of the nineteen sixties, and most especially if you want to acquire some insight on the historical roots of many of the self-inflicted wounds with which we white people of the west have decided to saddle ourselves.

If that isn't enough of a reason to induce you to watch this movie, let me also say it is funny, provocative, authentic, complex, nuanced, and, despite its reputation from fifty years ago, not really too much of a sex show.

One of my favorite scenes in the movie is a television news interview of a Swedish army officer, taking place during an exercise where his troops are, per government orders, practicing nonviolent resistance against a potential invader.

Other memorable clips include any scene (and there are quite a few) where Lena gets to do what she does best, which is to suddenly erupt into a magnificently impassioned paroxysm of rage.

Then there is the unfortunately prescient poster tacked onto a telephone pole:

  MESSAGE TO NON-WHITES:
  BE PREPARED!
  THE WHITES ARE TOTTERING!

Yellow also does a credible job of deconstructing the true nature of the sexual revolution, or free love The Bottom Line is, it does nothing to prevent the traditional, age-old rivalries, anxieties, and jealousies which have always existed between and among men and women as they compete against each other for love and attention.

It just means that everybody eventually ends up with the clap.

Highly recommended for the intelligent viewer.",1455926400,,1650,5.018382352941177
8236596,5,B00101ZDKK,"Excellent film fro the sexual revolution of the 1960's. This film documents the experiences of a young woman in late 1960's Sweden. It is very graphic and features English subtitles, Excellent view into that era!",1429747200,,212,5.085714285714285
8236597,2,B00101ZDKK,"Was ok, just slow at times. Foreign films are also different in how they approach things... Maybe a second look will be better.",1389052800,,127,4.565217391304348
8236598,4,B00101ZDKK,"It was shocking at the time I saw it in 1967. Pretty tame, almost a yawn, by today's standards Some of the attitudes are still disturbing.",1360281600,,138,4.346153846153846
8236599,1,B00101ZDKK,This films only saving grave is it's place in history.  I remember hearing about all the controversy when I was young so I though I'd find out what the big deal was.  I found nothing of interest.  It is slow and boring.  The only interesting part at all is the student leftists movement in Sweden in the 60's.,1349308800,,309,4.275862068965517
8236600,5,B00101ZDKK,"Produced in Sweden, this film was originally meant to be one long film but was cut into two versions:  I am curious (yellow), and I am curious (blue).  It was a docudrama.  Lena was in search of social issues and their answers.  She and her boyfriend/producer/director did street interviews about these issues.  Lena became interested in a car salesman and displayed full frontal nudity and implied intercourse in one or two brief scenes.  This made history for its time (1969/70).  The two movies are really not that great and the nudity compared to today's standards was negligible.  For their time, they caused national controversy on a scale never before experienced in the USA.  Look up the court case summary in Wikipedia or other sources. If you want to own a piece of film history, get these two, but don't expect to be too impressed.",1297036800,,842,4.791666666666667
8236601,5,B00101ZDKK,"there are certain films that you remember from when you were in high school.  I AM CURIOUS YELLOW, is one of those films.  just as its sister
film, I AM CURIOUS BLUE was a selfish pleasure.  both films were released
in the U.S., in the mid-late 60's, i was just graduating from H.S. and as
i was not old enough to go see them at the time, i kept the newspaper
clippings on them - when i got a few years older, looking for them on
VHS, and sitting down and watching them was a purlely selfish pleasure,
and still is.  not only for the politics in volved but also the girl is
still beautiful",1246838400,,589,4.095652173913043
8236602,3,B00101ZDKK,"In the sixties, the Swedish films were known to be the most sexually graphic, but this is the one that really rocked the world... It was shocking in its uninhibited portrayal of sex and in its fulminating piece of social democracy... It was a significant step forward in getting the adult film shown in the theaters...

The film comes in two editions, blue and yellow... The blue version focuses more on the political issues and the yellow concentrates on the emergence of sexual liberation...

The lead character is a young Swedish girl who attempts to hold fast to her philosophy of nonviolence, free love, and democratic socialism... But the realities of her life force her to adopt new and unrestrained ideologies...

Strangely enough, in Sweden, it was criticized more for its left-wing attitudes than for its audacious display of sex...",1232236800,,842,5.0
8236603,2,B00101ZDKK,"A very continental high-mindedness (especially in its ambitious attempt at political significance) drives this movie, but in terms of execution I Am Curious (Yellow) is characterized mostly by techniques much more akin to  exploitation film:  Dizzying zooms, lightning-fast cuts, awkward writing, a  very cheap look.
One can sense a fascinating and empathetic character  looming somewhere in lead character (also actress) Lena Nyman; the problem  is, she spends a good 2/3 of this film whining on and on about her beliefs  in a voice that could comfortably have fit into one of Federico Fellini's  hyper-annoying, narcissistic mockeries of femininity (see 8 1/2 and  especially Amarcord). In her moments of genuine catharsis Lena is very  interesting to watch:  When Boerje attacks her physical appearance and she  breaks down in anger, it's the closest this film comes to emotional  involvement.  That is all but lost in a sea of political banter, which  director Vilgot Sjoman never bothers to weave into the narrative (there  isn't much of one, actually).  So we get this -- a jumble of explicit  scenes of nudity and simulated sex, political messages, some funny moments  (""It's good if you didn't sleep with Madeleine..."") and more than  enough pretension to go around.
Irma Vep was a much better blend of  reality and fiction, narrative and technical innovation.  Still, I would be  lying if I said there wasn't a single moment of pleasure to be derived from  I Am Curious (Yellow).",916704000,,1488,5.133891213389122
