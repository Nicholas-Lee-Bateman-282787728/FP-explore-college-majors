8163145,1,B000LPS2S6,"Sorry, I know a bunch of folks here really loved this but, while I'm a HUGE horror fan, (though, admittedly, I don't have patience with direct-to-video horror) I just didn't feel like sitting through these guys running their mouths off and cursing (which I have no problem with but I do when I'd rather be hearing something useful and insightful). I guess this just appeals to a different crowd. I tried skipping around to see if it got better but it was just more of the same. And the in-and-out editing and sound design; more like one of those ""music videos"" some horror distributors stick at the front of their dvds for no good reason, with someone's girlfriend pouting in bondage gear- made it hard to hear the end of some people's sentences. I'm willing to admit that maybe I'm just out of touch. I don't go to conventions or Fangoria festivals, maybe that's it. Oh, well. Herschell Gordon Lewis had some smart stuff to say. and I did like the lo-fi clip of the guy in the amniotic sac crawling out from under the stall door. Otherwise, give me a good, solid, focused dvd commentary any day.",1449619200,,1096,4.540404040404041
8163146,5,B000LPS2S6,This was a great movie that I had heard about about the making of horror films from the a very gritty point of view. And I would recommend this to anyone who loves horror.,1443312000,2,171,4.0588235294117645
8163147,1,B000LPS2S6,"Credit must be given to anyone who can create a documentary film; especially one that tries to respect the perennially neglected genre of horror. I love horror documentaries. ""American Nightmare,"" ""Nightmares in red, white, and blue,"" and the works of Director Daniel Farrands has given franchises like ""Nightmare on Elm Street,"" and ""Friday the 13th,"" the attention they're due.

""Horror Business"" (2005) was a waste of 84 minutes and $3.00. I know, small potatoes right?
Just my opinion, but there was no narrative or real insight to be found in this documentary. Fine ""slices of life"" perspectives from a handful of ""DIY"" filmmakers across the country. Which can work, but the horrendous cinematography and camerawork of each interview subject is a large obstacle to overcome.

I would recommend the following from some of the fine contributors to ""Horror Business:""
Anthony Timpone's interviews from ""Cut to Pieces- The rise & fall of the Slasher genre"" (2006)
Sid Haig's interviews from ""The Movie Crypt"" podcast with Adam Green & Joe Lynch
The commentary tracks of Dave Parker's own films like ""The Dead Hate the Living,"" and ""Hills Run Red.""
Joe Bob Briggs commentaries to such genre fare as ""I Spit on your Grave.""

I wanted to really like and appreciate this documentary. Even some of the filmmakers profiled make some vaild points. (i.e.  the 2000s being one of the lowest points in pop culture memory, especially in film and music)

I would recommend skipping this and renting ""American Movie"" (1999) instead. Rating 1/5",1394409600,2,1531,5.083665338645418
8163148,1,B000LPS2S6,"Alright, I'm still a film student so I can't rate this on an expert level. On the other hand, I know bad filmmaking when I see it. It's a really armature documentary about armature filmmaking. A lot of flashy effects, a lot of complaining, and a lot of nothing. The guys making it spend the majority of the time complaining about the hardships of filmmaking and how awesome they are... and one guy mentions many times that his mom helps pay his rent (he has a wife and kids!! Time to leave film for a more secure job). Trust me, I get its rough out there, especially for indies, but making a barely watchable doc about it isn't benefitting anyone. All in all, it didn't help me so buy at your own risk. To the filmmakers: Sorry guys, just my opinion :-(",1329955200,,753,4.309859154929577
8163149,3,B000LPS2S6,"After careful consideration, I realized that while I took issue with the style and views of the filmmakers portrayed in Horror Business, the documentary itself certainly contained valuable information regarding a particular genre within the horror industry. Christopher P. Garetano clearly knew his subject matter. Horror Business was a reflection of the struggling filmmaker trying desperately to get his/her projects to an industry dominated by the tired formulas of Hollywood.",1300924800,3,479,5.857142857142857
8163150,3,B000LPS2S6,"Well, befitting the fact that most of the filmmakers interviewed are making extremely low-budget movies, this documentary has a very low-budget feel. Essentially, the person or folks putting this documentary together went and interviewed a bunch of people working on horror movies with tiny budgets to find out about what drives them to make films, especially such low-budget fare then switches off back and forth between different parts of their interviews.

In the end, it's pretty okay. Maybe made more for the hardcore horror fan or for fans of extremely low-budget horror directors more so than mainstream fans or the general public?

For what it was, it was alright. I don't know if there were any awe-inspiring insights gained by the end of the documentary, but the various stories and anecdotes seemingly add up to slightly more than the sum of their parts.",1276992000,,865,5.041958041958042
8163151,3,B000LPS2S6,"This is an entertaining look at some of the makers of Lo or No Budget Horror Films. The Title says Horror Business but the Movie is not a look at the business end of movie making or Horror movie making for that matter. What it is is a loose look at the trials and tribs of making movies. It was very good to see Mark Borchardt from ""American Movie"" fame and what he is doing lately but I miss his friend Mike Schank, who I could watch for hours and is not in this movie. But getting back to business, if you are looking for some insight to the business of movie making, it isn't in here. Maybe all you can learn is that it is hard and you have to love it to do it. Great advice indeed but not enough to help you get your movie to market or even how to get the funds and how best to spend the funds. This would be helpful. Still I liked what was there.",1223942400,2,851,3.896551724137931
8163152,5,B000LPS2S6,"I applaud Chris Garetano for hanging in through all the ups-and-downs to complete his documentary on these hell-bent dreamers. Are these folks obsessed? Sure. You have to be. It's that simple. Just as Garetano was--if you want to make a dream or two happen. How heavy is the toll paid along the way? Very. Still, life is short--and you only get one shot at it--so follow your heart, man: win, lose or draw.

It was also great to see the incomperable Mr. Ed Neal (Hitchiker from the original TCM) do a cameo here.

Check out the extras.

Can't wait for Son of Horror Business, as well as South Texas Blues. I truly hope you can pull it off--because it's about time someone, anyone, did a film about the hellish experience making the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre was.",1174176000,6,769,4.598540145985401
8163153,5,B000LPS2S6,"Chris Garretano is a genius filmmaker who has a real gift for documentary direction.  I love horror films and am always interested in the behind the scenes info.  This great showcase captures the hopes, dreams and challenges of a handful of some really colorful filmmakers as they break into the mainstream market.  There is some great commentary by well known horror actors and industry people.  A few of the subject filmmakers are just wacky and funny to watch, and then there are some who are definitely serious and obviously very talented, like David Stagnari.  The clips from his film are visually stunning and he is compelling to watch.  I can't wait to see more from him and from the director of this documentary.  I'm buying copies of this for all my horror fan friends as gifts this year for birthdays and the holidays!",1173744000,3,828,4.748251748251748
8163154,5,B000LPS2S6,"HORROR BUSINESS REVIEW BY GEORGE A. ROMERO , POSTED BY CHRIS

""[Horror Business] is a terrific flick.  Christopher Garetano has completely succeeded in describing the passions, the adventures- and the misadventures- of crazy people like me who, somewhere along the way, decided they... needed to make movies.  Anyone who wants to write or direct should see this film.  Those who have never dreamed of being filmmakers should see it for its humor and its pure entertainment value.  Two thumbs up- both of them mine because, like the others Garetano has portraited, I basically work alone.""
