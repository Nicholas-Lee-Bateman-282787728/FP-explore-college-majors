2123054,3,B0002V7O2Y,"I have really mixed feelings about this movie. The design of the ships, suits, rockets, and planet-scapes is really beautiful. The matte art by Chesley Bonestell really shines in this distinctly 50's view of the future. The script, however, is simply an abomination. The astronaut crew is filled with the sort of personality mix you would expect on a battleship - from the well spoken officer to the uneducated guy with a mop and Brooklyn accent.  These characters are used to introduce silly ""color"" that might have worked well in a WWII movie. The worst of it is the gratuitous introduction of religion -  the idea that ""maybe god doesn't want us to explore space"", and the extended character conflicts based on irrationality - these simply have no place in a sci-fi move.
Overall, I'd say this movie is worth watching just for looks. Very unfortunate that it was done in EP mode. A widescreen DVD would be very nice, but the sorry excuse for a script will probably doom this movie to obscurity.",1002758400,,997,4.724137931034483
2123055,5,B0002V7O2Y,"As far as the film goes, its as good as any other 1950's film.  I bought the video to keep with my Eric Fleming collection.  To me he made RAWHIDE the success it was, and, as far as I'm concerned he was good actor, and the handsomest man, I've ever seen!  Such a tragedy, he died so young.",988934400,2,289,3.9482758620689653
2123056,4,B0002V7O2Y,"If you saw this movie when it was brand-new and you were a 10-year-old  boy, it'll always have a special place in your heart.
This is actually  two movies. The first half is the pedestrian, uninspired one as  preparations are made inside an orbiting space station -- nicknamed the  ""Wheel"" because of its shape -- for man's first flight to Mars.  The situations and dialog here are laced with that oafish humor which  George Pal apparently felt was necessary to sugar-coat the movie's more  technical aspects.
Once the ship is launched, however, things markedly  improve and the movie's second half contains scene after scene which still  linger in the memory even after more than 40 years: the encounter with an  asteroid, the burial in space, the landing on Mars, the snowfall during a  Martian Christmas, etc.
Three members of the cast went on to greater  renown. Eric Fleming soon starred in TV's ""Rawhide"" series with  Clint Eastwood. William Redfield piloted a miniature submarine through the  human body in ""Fantastic Voyage."" And Walter Brooke later said  one word in ""The Graduate"" to Dustin Hoffman --  ""Plastics.""",968198400,17,1124,4.994594594594594
2123057,4,B0002V7O2Y,"This is a very interesting film, although frought with annoyances.
First, the special effects are really very well done for the day. The starfields, Mars seen from orbit, and other opticals are classic.  The models are not bad. Make no mistake, this is not to say the film is on  a par with ""Forbidden Planet"", but the effects are quite  serviceable.
As for the sets, I found them to be pretty good, considering  the time the movie was made. The spaceship cabin seems to rotate after the  ship lands, and as it does, the crew's seats stay level. Not a radically  new idea, but not an easy undertaking either.
The music, what there is of  it, fits the film nicely. Actually the lack of music underscores several  scenes and produces some intensity.
As for the acting, the worst travesty  is the character from New York. The dialogue is terrible, and he's pretty  annoying as the comic relief. The General's son is a Leslie Neilson  lookalike, but kind of stiff and uninteresting. The other actors are  believeable, at least.
Two characters will stay with you at the end of  the picture.
One, the Japanese crewman who makes a stirring speech about  why he wants to go on the mission. His is one of the more interesting  characters throughout the picture.
Second is a young crewman who washes  out of the program. He has two scenes that were rather impressive. In one,  he suspects he won't make it, and appears very edgy, trying to master his  fear of both the mission and his failure. Then later in the mess hall, he  gets the bad news that he didn't make the cut, and again he almost loses  it.
The cast is rather dull and stiff, but at least in these scenes these  actors shined through.
The religious angle does seem to come out of  nowhere. The foundation is laid before the ship leaves, as we see the  General looking over his bible. He begins suffering from space sickness,  and it becomes obvious something will go wrong. Unfortunately, the plot  element isn't well developed, and you have to watch the film very closely  or at least twice to pick up on the genesis of the problem.
The film has  a spooky overtone, somewhat similar to ""When Worlds Collide"",  another George Pal effort. The sets and lighting seem similar in style,  too.
The best scenes are in the first half of the picture, before the  crew lands on Mars. The space travel segments are very good, even the  obligitory encounter with an asteroid.
While no ""Forbidden  Planet"", the film is worth viewing. At the low price, even in EP mode,  it does deserve a spot in your collection. After two or three viewings, you  may begin to appreciate the film's subtlety, and the broad questions it  asks about Man's place in the universe.",964396800,3,2701,4.579497907949791
2123058,3,B0002V7O2Y,"In this follow-up to ""Destination Moon"" producer George Pal wanted to show how, possibly, our life in space would look. He used the book THE CONQUEST OF SPACE by Willy Ley and Chesley Bonestell as his basis and created a story of the first manned expedition to Mars. While the technology is deeply rooted in the 1950's, it interesting to note that the rotating space station that figures so prominently in the first half of the film is built as a combined project of the US, UK, Germany, Japan, Russia, etc., the same as the soon-to-be-launched ISS. While the film is not nearly as good as some of Pal's other works, such as ""War of the Worlds"" or ""When Worlds Collide,"" it's still definitely worth a look.
Sadly, the producers of the video decided to release the tape in the EP/SLP format, resulting in a picture that is OK, but very grainy and sometimes hard to keep on track. It does have Hi-Fi sound, which is nice and clear.  END",900892800,13,934,4.4941176470588236

2123080,1,B0002V7O2Y,"At some point in the future (from the perspective of 1955 anyway), humankind has succeeded in building a large, wheel-shaped space station in orbit around Earth. People are ready to take the next step as the construction of a spaceship, with an uncertain mission, is near completion. While this new spaceship is originally intended to head to the Moon, the crew is shocked to learn that authorities have changed their mind and instead is going to Mars instead. With a multinational crew, the spaceship heads off for the journey of a lifetime.

Overall, this movie is a great disappointment. Although often considered to be a ""classic"" science fiction film, that does not necessarily make it a good one. The special effects in this are rather poor. I am not sure what other reviewers are talking about when they say good special effects. Considering the work that was done in previous George Pal productions, such as Destination Moon (1950), When Worlds Collide (1951), and The War of the Worlds (1953), the work in this movie is pitiful by comparison. Poorly done matte work is all over the place in this film. Probably my favorite example is the meteor that appears to materialize out of nothing.

The next big problem is the plot holes and sometimes egregious inaccuracies. First of all, the spaceship has a pair of giant wings and yet crew-members are apparently stupid enough to think that such a ship would head to the Moon which has no atmosphere thus rendering wings useless. This is the kind of science that even grade school children know. A plot point that comes into play shortly after they leave Earth involves fixing a communications antenna, and yet that equipment is jettisoned along with the spaceship's boosters as they approach Mars. The zero-gravity effects are horribly done and inconsistent. Apparently you do not even need pressurized space suits on Mars, either, as characters seem fine without gloves on.

Finally, there is the dumb characters and lousy story. The spaceship basically seems to be manned by five people who seem to be more qualified to work as auto mechanics all led by a lunatic commander. One astronaut even comments that he could not go outside the ship on a spacewalk because it is travelling at 20,000 MPH. That is just one example of the often ridiculous dialogue that pervades this movie. The story itself was not well written and had poorly handled religious overtones.

This film tried to be a version of hard science fiction that attempted to realistically portray what spaceflight might be like one day. In fact, the designs of the space station and spaceship are loosely based on proposals once considered by the legendary rocket scientist Wernher von Braun. But the movie has too many problems and so many inaccuracies that their attempts to be realistic seem almost laughable.

In conclusion, this is rather disappointing film and certainly the worst George Pal film I have seen. It might be interesting to check out if you are a completionist, but others can skip it.",1421625600,,3022,4.9060665362035225

2123087,2,B0002V7O2Y,"I watched George Pal's CONQUEST OF SPACE ('55), which is based on writings by futurists Willy Ley and Chesley Bonestell. Ley mostly designed space ships and Bonestell made paintings of extraterrestrial worlds. Both were awesome. I actually paid $3 to watch this on Amazon Instant. With a pedigree like that, and the 4 star rating, I figured I must see it.

Familiar actors included Ross Martin (Artemus Gordon from Wild Wild West TV SHOW), William Hopper (Paul Drake from Perry Mason) and Rosemary Clooney (aunt of George) preforming in a dance routine shown on the big-screen TV aboard ""The Wheel"" -- the orbiting space station. It's called ""The Wheel"" because it look like one (as in 2001).

Another recognizable face was that of Benson Fong. Fong, a Chinese, was playing Sergeant Yamoto, a Japanese. In his speech to the Colonel that the planned trip to Mars was NOT an insane waste of time, he offered up some rare tid-bits of information: Japanese houses are made of paper and they use chopsticks because the Japanese people are too poor for wooden houses and knives and forks. We also learn that Japanese are short because they don't have enough food.

Going into some of these old sci-fi movies I understand that they were expecting to wow the audience with ultra-cool spaceships and such and the stress seemed to be on educating the masses about the mechanics of spaceflight. So the story gets second consideration.

But this story... Good grief. I'll try to encapsulate it.

There's a space station orbiting the earth, and then for a year the station's crew has been building a spaceship (in orbit) that is supposed to go to the moon. Everyone up there's been there too long. The whole project is the baby of Colonel Samuel T. Merritt, the commander of ""The Wheel."" It's his brainchild. But when it comes time to take the spaceship to Mars (change of plans), he gets religion and starts babbling about how it's an abomination for man to visit other planets. Apparently this was brought on by ""space sickness,"" which we find out early on can mess with you in any way shape or form.

The part that really got me was how the crew were modeled after enlisted army ""grunts"" instead of highly qualified officers. There was constant grumbling about the project and the duration. One of the main characters had a thick Brooklyn accent and talked like he was a plumber or taxi driver. I think his role was so that the others could explain to him (and thereby to the audience) that, no, you won't get blown away if you go for a spacewalk even though the ship is going 20,000 mph.

Compare Conquest of Space, made in '55 to Forbidden Planet, made a year later. Well, there IS no comparison. Forbidden Planet is still highly entertaining and watchable with barely any groans.

2123091,1,B0002V7O2Y,"This is a film for students of the genre and also those with an interest in film making.

I watched it first when I was 10 years old and sat transfixed- immersed in a grand adventure. Like many kids my age, I was always crazy about anything that had to do with space travel. At the time, we were half a decade from launching our first satellite.

So....... It's 2014 and on a whim, I pull it down the internet; something they never dreamed of in 1955. Sadly, with adult eyes, this has to be one of the all time worst science fiction movies ever made. Reading up on it informs me that it is said to have damaged George Pal's career. Easy to see why. It's hard to believe Willy Ley had anything to do with the story... Hopefully, he didn't. Bogged down with ham handed acting and a plot infested with misapplied religious baloney it was doomed by that alone, but wait! there's more! Even with the great Chesley Bonestell helping with the mat paintings, they are so poor you can see the boundaries. Not a good effort, even by the standards of the time.

Now.... A serious bone to pick with Amazon downloads- I can see the point of a limited time to view a rental but jeez, folks... 24 hours? Ridiculous. A week would be proper. We all have lives and I had to pause at the halfway point and pick it up the next day. With 15 minutes to go before the end it simply deleted itself, leaving me stunned at the stupidity. There is no reason the software couldn't detect it was being played and run to the end. Dumb! For this I paid more than a 3 day rental at the local video store.

It has its goofy parts, like when it snows on Christmas day on Mars, but it tries hard to look technically realistic.  Finally, it is produced by George Pal, which to me is a hard combination to beat. But the characters in this movie are just awful. Two in particular were incredibly annoying. There is the ever present and painfully stereotypical New Yorker. He causes the movie to grind to a halt. But the crash and burn is caused by the horrible character of the captain. Supposedly a great scientific visionary, he has some kind of weird religious conversion/mental breakdown about halfway through the movie and does his best to sabotage the mission. Why? What purpose does this serve? There is quite a bit made of the long term negative effects of being in space. But why put together such an interesting technical movie only to ruin it with such a pointless plot device?

2123105,5,B0002V7O2Y,"I received three classic Sci-Fi space travel movies from Amazon for my birthday:  Conquest of Space, Rocketship X-M and Destination Moon.  All three movies have a few similar traits that reflect the time-frame when they were made:  1) All astronauts wore WWII military type clothes in space and only needed a space helmet with oxygen, 2) Interiors of the rocket ships all reflect WWII military technology, 3) All crews seem to have one wise-cracking smart guy who played the harmonica, and  4) When a rocket ship needed to land, they all spun around backwards and landed on their fins.  Now that's technological nostalgia!  I loved all three of these movies.  I think Destination Moon had the best FX and showed what weightlessness in space was like much better.  But for those Sci-Fans like me who love the old classic (but sometimes silly) space movies, you need to have Conquest of Space, Rocketship X-M and Destination Moon!",1372291200,5,928,4.903846153846154

2123108,3,B0002V7O2Y,"This was a sci-fi movie from the 50s that had somehow escaped my attention until now.  I had no expectations when I started watching it, only the distant warnings that this was George Pal's folly and flop.  To be sure, it is a little dated and not a little silly at times.  But, it did manage to hold my interest throughout and I found that I liked it well enough to keep it in my collection for future viewings.
The plot is basic; a space station is orbiting the Earth, enabling a crew to construct a spaceship that will take them to the moon.  These plans however, are abruptly discarded for a trip to Mars instead.  The news is not taken well by several members of the space station, not surprising given their fearless leader's penchant for drafting volunteers.  It also doesn't help that several members of the space station are suffering `space fatigue.'  Add to the mix a disgruntled son (Eric Fleming) who wants to go home to his wife.  Unfortunately, their fearless leader (Walter Brooke) is also his father.  The father is followed around by a lap dog, Sgt Mahoney (Mickey Shaughnessy) who feels the General can do no wrong, even when proven that he is clearly deranged.  When it comes to insanity, rank does have its privileges.
There are more than a few laughable sequences in this film, such as when Benson Fong's character takes off the gloves of his spacesuit so that he can play with the Martian soil.  Also amusing is the notion that space travel always requires that at least one person brings a revolver!
I must add that I was a bit taken aback by the abrupt addition of religion by a character (the general) whose own son was confused by his sudden interest in the Bible and there being no mention in it of man going into space.  Obviously, both men had been living in space for quite some time and the trip to the moon was eagerly anticipated by the general who suddenly decided, very late in the game, that it was a curse and an abomination to God!  I felt the religious aspect a bit arbitrary and not a little disconcerting.  Not everyone who reads the Bible turns into a homicidal maniac.  To make that a form of dementia is insulting to say the least.  And without a proper setup, a bit confusing that they would resort to something so clich to explain the general's sudden trip into insanity.

Still, it had its moments.",1363046400,3,2346,4.495283018867925
2123109,3,B0002V7O2Y,"In the 1950s, there was a lot of discussion about the coning Space Age.  An ambitious concept of an orbiting spsce station from which a spacecraft would be assembled to explore the Moon and beyond.  The film tries to show the idea being realized, but the result is flawed, even for the time it was produced.
A crew aboard the space station works while the ship is assembled for a trip to the Moon.  The ship could be seen next to the ststion, in final stages of assembly, including vast wings that would be totally useless on a lunar expedition.  The astronsuts who are supposed to go to the Moon are given a strict diet of ""food pills,"" which were known to be impractical even in the 1950s, and one person who's cut from the mission is served a dinner with steak, lertting him know that he's been cut.
The ship's commander, Colonel (promoted to General) Merrit, gets orders that change the ship's destination from the Moon to Mars, which is worse than telling a ship's captain that his route from Miami to Cuba has been changed to from Miami to Australia (only more so).
En route to Mars, some of the crew have to make a spacewalk on the outside of the hull, and a huge, glowing asteroid overtakes them, with an attendant series of meteoroids killing a crewmember.  The dead astronaut receives a ""burial in Space,"" with General Merritt conducting the service, giving the remins in their spacesuit a gentle push in the direction of the Sun (orbital mechanics being what they are, the corpse wouldn't get within 90 million miles of the Sun).
The ship eventually lands on Mars.  The astrinauts debark, and things are interesting, in that the sky is blue, has clouds in it, and later in the film has snow fall from it.  The Martian environment enables the astronauts to work with their bare hands, even though they wear space suits.
Thrpoughout the film, things are blithely ignored, as cconservation of propellants, no alteration in the mission profile, even though an extra crewmember stows away, and needing a bubble level to have the ship launch straight uo (in a real rocketship, that would mean the ship's incapable of course correction).  Such things as a different Martian gravity (roughly one-third the Earth's), momentum (a ferry rocket slows to reach a space station), and usimg the rocket engines to facilitate collapse of the Martian surface for ship alignment blithely ignore physics and chemistry,  The whole concept of getting raw materials from other planrts  was known to be impractical, even back then.
Any rocket engineer, astronomer, physicist, or chemist of the time would wince at what was shown; viewing it now is worth a laugh to anyone who's familiar with Space technology.",1359763200,,2696,4.778494623655914
2123110,3,B0002V7O2Y,"This was perhaps George Pal's greatest failure ... and a setback to his career. It is not hard to see why. Pal apparently wanted to duplicate his success, Destination Moon ... by creating a kind of clone. He therefore duplicates many of the plot elements: a) the Brooklyn comic relief; b) the magnetic shoes to counter weightlessness; c) the stuck antenna necessitating a spacewalk; d) tragedy during the space walk; and d) technical difficulties threatening to prevent a return to Earth. But somehow these come off as crude. The same is true of many of the special effects. For example when the space wheel is hit by a meteor it develops a serious wobble (as well as some kind of mysterious lightning along its side). But the wobble not only looks crude, but is much too fast in relation to the wheel's spin. One of the would-be contributions of the movie is a peculiar space psychosis termed (in the movie) ""space fatigue."" This is heavily relied upon to create drama ... but ultimately comes across as overdone and silly, and hurts the film.
So isn't there anything good about it? Yes, there is: a) depicting Mars as a lifeless desert (at a time when many still held  hopes of exotic life); b) chemical propulsion and staging (Destination Moon used nuclear propulsion ... which turned out much harder than expected); and finally the movie predicts good television communication with Earth ... including hootchy-kootchy girls (entertaining, even if now very politically incorrect). And, oh yes, there is that wonderful von Braun space wheel. Why haven't we done that yet? Probably because it is too heavy and would necessitate too many launches using heavy boosters.

So what caused Pal to lower his standards for this movie? I have no idea!",1358985600,,1743,4.865319865319865

2123114,2,B0002V7O2Y,"As a lifelong fan of 1950's style science fiction, I was eagerly anticipating watching this film for the first time. Haskin, Pal, Martin, Fong, etc., how could one go wrong?

I'm sad to report that this film has not aged very well at all. It is in poor comparison to its contemporaries, both high and low budget. The egregious dialog, forced philosophies, and corny humor soon grow so stale, it frankly was a struggle to finish watching. No wonder this was a flop at the box office when released, and ended up being a stain on George Pal's career.

I thought perhaps when they landed on the red planet things would improve, but it was just more of the same (i.e., one embarrassing scene after another). How quaint, it snows on Mars on December 25th for a Christmas miracle. Hey fellas, let's start a garden! And don't forget the rockslide (at least we didn't have to endure yet another meteor shower). No worries, everything can be fixed in 14 minutes!

The scene where the men are strained in their departure for Mars is a classic, but it's not nearly enough to save this boring soap opera-ish production. The viewer draws no attachment to any of the characters whatsoever; indeed, they're mostly obnoxious in the overly-melodramatic script. Suspension of disbelief is virtually non-existant. The anti-climatic (hokey) ending doesn't help things, either.

Special effects left me feeling rather bland, so a neutral in that department.

I'd have to rank CONQUEST OF SPACE right near the bottom of the plethora of science fiction movies that I've ever seen. It's not completely without merit, however. Children may enjoy this, I'm not sure. Praise is also due for including a ""Japanese"" crewmember, and for showing other minorities in the mess hall too. But that's pretty much where any forward-thinking stops - what's left is bad science and bad fiction.

I hate to be so critical, but this preposterous motion picture has so few redeeming moments that I know with certainty that I will *never* watch it again. ""Mars or Hell"" - well, I know the answer now after watching. What a huge letdown.

Finally, to quote the Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, CONQUEST OF SPACE is ""A truly awful film... probably George Pal's worst production"". And I couldn't agree more.",1354665600,,2260,4.869791666666667

The two perennial favourites of filmdom, human drama and excitement are blended in a satisfying way. It was a real pleasure to see Eric Fleming from TV's Rawhide in what I presume was an early role.

  This particular version (in widescreen and with the ""blue background / yellow title"" original theatrical poster  artwork on the DVD cover) is fabulous but I do have one overwhelming critique concerning this particular version which is that THIS version comes with sub-titles that can NOT be turned off.  Yipes!! Otherwise, this version is pretty decent.
Fortunately, I only bought this version to simply get the cover art. I then bought the official Paramount video version (different DVD cover and NO undeleteable sub-titles!); then switched disks so that I wound up with the Paramount disk along with the original poster art cover). Am I a ""Conquest of Space"" addict or what?  So beware ... if you don't like sub-titles, then do NOT buy  >THIS< DVD; buy the official Paramount disk instead.
HISTORICAL NOTES : In the film, Mars is depicted as having craters & volcanoes.  The Martian surface shots are equally eye-popping as the ground is reddish with dark rocks everywhere.  Why is this amazing?  Well, this was filmed in 1955, 10 long years or so BEFORE anyone really knew what Mars actually looked like.  Are some of the other Martian planetary approach shots perfect?  No! Because we now know there are actually no surface lakes or green areas on the planet.  Nevertheless, most of the Martian landscape shots were fairly accurate and far ahead of their time.  In 1955 no one knew about the craters & volcanoes which exist on Mars.
  Otherwise, the spaceship and the Space Station (AKA ""The Wheel"") were fairly well depicted.  The religious motif is a bit heavy handed yet tolerable within the framework of the story. And last, but not least, one wishes that the International Space Station was actually more ""wheel-like"" as in COS & 2001:ASO.  Anyway: a well made, fun film.",1339200000,3,1955,4.840361445783133

Spaceship One has three components: a large sweptback wing, an Earth-return rocket mounted on top, and an Earth-to-Mars booster attached to its end.  Crew capacity: 5.

Mission: Fire Earth-to-Mars booster to obtain a Mars intercept trajectory.  Before entering atmosphere, eject booster, brake with wing rockets, glide to a landing, erect the return rocket, and begin a resource survey.  On return day, launch into Earth intercept trajectory.  Upon nearing Earth, brake into the station's orbit.

General Merritt: command pilot.  Responsible for the construction of the space station and the spaceship.

Captain Merritt: copilot.  The general's son wanted to go back to Earth, but the Mars mission changed his mind.

Sergeants Imoto (geologist), Siegle (electronics specialist), and Fodor (medical specialist) complete the crew.

Sergeant Major Mahoney: responsible for crew selectees.  Devoted to General Merritt.  Concerned about dental hygiene.

Warning!  Do not float from the shuttle to the station; you will probably miss.  Do not remove gloves on Mars; you will lose consciousness.  Do not fill a water tank with Martian snow; it may be carbon dioxide.  And, most importantly, do not board a Mars bound spaceship if anyone shows signs of space fatigue.  Such a person could be a grave risk to ship and crew.

In summary, Conquest of Space is an excellent movie.  It is pure science fiction with reasonable extrapolations of science and technology into the future of 1954.  The sets, special effects, and acting are excellent.

The film reunited Pal with WAR director Byron Haskin.  As a lifelong fan of these types of films, I've never understood why CONQUEST is rarely mentioned in the literature or discussions among other fans.  Perhaps the film wasn't well received at the time, as radiation-fueled giant insects, etc. were a mainstay of mid-fifties sci-fi.  And, in much the vein of DESTINATION MOON, the film is an earnest attempt to depict Mankind's future in space.

CONQUEST OF SPACE [Spoilers ahead] deals with the first manned flight to Mars, which is launched from an Earth-orbiting space station simply called ""The Wheel.""  But even as the human race boldly forges ahead into the future, human weaknesses remain.  The general in charge of the mission goes a bit nuts, endangering the crew.  It seems he has gotten religion, and decides that Man ought not to be leaving Paradise for the blasphemous attempt to explore other worlds.  It falls to the general's son, also a member of the crew, to save everyone from his zealous father.

The most striking aspect of James O'Hanlon's script (from a book by rocket pioneer Willy Ley and astronomical artist Chesley Bonestell) is how the film's attitude toward religion differs from Pal's previous films.  In both WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE and WAR OF THE WORLDS, Man's faith in God basically either saves the day, or gives us hope for tomorrow.  In CONQUEST, the general's beliefs threaten not only to destroy the crew, but jeopardize the future of space travel.  At one point, the general describes their situation thusly: ""Our destination is Mars. . .or Hell.""

The real star of the film, though, is its amazing special effects.  I know other people have pointed out the similarities between CONQUEST and Stanley Kubrick's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2001-A-Space-Odyssey/dp/B00005ASUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2001 - A Space Odyssey</a>.  And whether either ever admitted it publicly, you'll never convince me that Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke didn't see this movie prior to writing 2001.  Anyway, the composite shots of the always-spinning Wheel and various ships, spacemen, etc. are first-rate.  Also impressive are the bird's eye (uh...""Wheel's eye"", I guess) views of rockets being launched from Earth.  Many modern viewers seem to have little patience for pre-CGI effects; but I think CONQUEST's space scenes are probably the best of any fifites science fiction film.

And while it's true some of the dialogue dates the film, it doesn't completely ruin the experience.  The lone Japanese crew member's lengthy justification for volunteering for the mission--in which he apologizes for World War II and offers a ludicrous explanation regarding his countrymen's reduced size--is especially grating in these politically-correct times.  And no early space-exploration film would be complete without the obligatory comic-relief character, who, unfortunately, is neither very comic or relieving in any way.

Even if you're a fan of 1950's sci-fi, it's possible you may have missed this rarely-seen film.  In the final analysis, it doesn't quite measure up to the other three George Pal films mentioned above.  But it certainly deserves more notice than it has been given.",1174780800,,3897,6.1589648798521255
2123134,5,B0002V7O2Y,"I just got finished watching Conquest of Space while eating my one meal of the day.  I've got to tell you, it brought back old memories of the fifties and sixties movies where you have a lot of soldiers and no women.

It is a fun movie.  There is no doubt who the bad guys are and who the good guys are--there were no bad guys.  No, there are no aliens or anything like what we usually see now adays--nary a one.  Instead this movie takes a shot at space exploration in the same vein as the Robert A. Heinlein did in his earlier works, hard science (at least for the day).

The acting is there, I found really no short comings.  An attempt at special effects was made using some logic and physics, and the idea of the movie (going to mars) was/is a great idea.

I think Heinlein would have busted a gut at the inaccuracies in the movie but I'm sure he would have liked it.  I feel he would have given it a three star rating and maybe one more star for the acting.  So I give it five because I'm not as sharp as Heinlein and am a little more easily swayed.

Finally, I feel all of you who watch and collect these older science fiction movies will have to get this one--so few of our science fiction movies were done with a serious outlook--those of you who have to have naked women and exploding heads in a movie need not apply.

So, to the cast and crew, writer/director of this movie...and all movies like it, and Robert A. Heinlein-for all you did, for all you do-this Buds for you.",1170460800,4,1484,4.168421052631579

I was quite pleased to get a good copy to replace the beat up non-letterboxed videotape I had. This film was an obvious influence on Kubrick for 2001, though not one book on Stanley or 2001 has ever mentioned this. The plots in both films are quite similar, down to a death in space, a crewmember going mad, and the space station. I think this speaks more to film critics ignorance of pop culture than anything else. For some reason, this film gets short shrift even in books on sf or George Pal, and personally, I think it's one of his best films. Lovely sound track too.",1167436800,,670,4.161538461538462
2123136,3,B0002V7O2Y,"George Pal made some good science fiction movies in the 50s. This is not one of them. It is merely watchable.

The story is of an international mission to Mars sent to try and get information about exploiting the resources of that planet. The mission that gest sent was intended to be a moon mission but had its objective changed at the last minute.

The crew is led by a visionary general who helped to make space travel a reality. He is a no nonsense type of CO who wants everything to be just perfect. That includes his son who is assigned to the mission even though he does not want to be there.

The problem with the mission besides primitive technology is that the general goes mad on the way to Mars. He jeopardizes the mission and the lives of his crew. It is left to the son to salvage things.

Most elements are very predictable. The effects were good for the 50s but are laughable now. The show was worth watching for fans of the genre just to see how much has changed but I have no desire to ever watch it again.",1156032000,4,1024,4.235897435897436

2123145,4,B0002V7O2Y,"Translating ones imagination effectively to the silver screen can be tricky, especially during a time when special effects were not created through the use of computers, and, in the 50s, few did it better than George Pal (Destination Moon, When Worlds Collide, The War of the Worlds).  While Conquest of Space (1955) isn't necessarily his best work, there felt, to me at least, just as much effort put forth as in any of his other films, that's to say a whole lot more than most.  Produced by George Pal and directed by Byron Haskin (Treasure Island, The War of the Worlds, Robinson Crusoe on Mars...I'd like to see this last one released onto DVD), the film stars Walter Brooke (""The Green Hornet"", Tora! Tora! Tora!), Eric Fleming (Queen of Outer Space, ""Rawhide""), and comedian turned actor Phil `Frank DeFazio' Foster (""Laverne & Shirley"").  Also appearing is Mickey Shaughnessy (From Here to Eternity), Benson Fong (Our Man Flint, The Love Bug), Ross Martin (The Colossus of New York, The Great Race), William `No relation to Dennis' Hopper (The Bad Seed, 20 Million Miles to Earth), Vito Scotti (The Boatniks, The Godfather), William `Harding' Redfield (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest), and Joan Shawlee (Prehistoric Women, The Wild Angels).

The film begins with a voice over monologue telling us that `This is a story of tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow...', okay, I know this is meant to put the viewer in the proper frame of mind, but my cynical side immediately started making jokes...perhaps it's the day after the day after tomorrow, sometime around 4 PM?  Don't mind me...anyway, we soon witness the majesty of what may be one of man's greatest achievements, a giant, circular space station orbiting the Earth, the brainchild of Colonel Samuel T. Merritt (Brooke), a driven man seemingly hell bent on conquering space (hence the title of the film).  The station serves a two-fold purpose, the first being an observatory, and the second, and more importantly, a launching pad for future missions into the great, inky void we know as outer space.  As the story proceeds we meet various individuals and learn the crew on the station is basically a melting pot of ethnicities (although I didn't see any African Americans) and also the world of tomorrow is comprised of not a multitude of little gooberments, but one, large monolithic entity that rules all.  Some stuff happens, then some more stuff, and then we get the word from the Supreme International Space Authority (SISA)...Mars is a go!  There's some trepidation as this wasn't part of the original plans, but apparently mankind's need for exploitable resources is worsening by the day, so, with a hand picked crew (including his son...how's that for nepotism?), General Merritt (the new mission came with a promotion), board a specially designed rocket and begin a perilous mission...but a lengthy tenure in orbit has begun to take its toll on the General, developing into a form of the `space madness' that could threaten all...are we explorers on the verge of one of the last, great frontiers, or are we trespassers within God's domain, venturing into areas not meant for us?

All right, there is some real hokum in this film, like the notion that a man can remove the glove of his spacesuit and sift through alien soil with his hand (they did make it to Mars, by the way...it's getting back that turns out to be the real pain), but one would do well to keep in mind this film was made about 50 years ago.  I was really amazed at the level of achievement in this film in terms of special effects and wonder how many minds were blown at the time (did anyone notice how much the rocketship looked like our current stealth bomber?).  The space station, the rocketship, space walks, Martian landscapes...all were created with a real eye for detail and geared towards fostering the belief that we were in space...which I accepted easily, but the one aspect I found very difficult to buy off on, one which came up a few times, was the notion that the crew on the space station, and specifically on the rocketship, were the very best of the best the Earth had to offer, especially in terms of the wisecracking, comic relief/electrician Jackie Siegle (with thick, Brooklyn accent), played by Phil Foster...don't get me wrong, his was one of the more interesting characters in the movie, and I've always assumed the distant future would be one without distinctive, somewhat exaggerated stereotypes (too much Star Trek, I suppose)...but again, given the age of the film, one should make for allowances.  The script is a little weak, but the story does move along at a fairly good clip, wasting little time and certainly not overstaying its welcome with a roughly 80 minute running time.  This isn't really a character driven story, but focuses more so on occurrences, settings, and the problems incurred (the space station, the mission to Mars, etc.), although I did like the speech the Japanese astronaut made with regards to the importance of making the venture to Mars.  I also thought the theory put forth by the General's son, played by Fleming, was a well presented in that, basically, we are where we in terms of development as being a part of some great plan (Earth's resources are nearly depleted around the same time we begin to venture into space).  There are a number of noteworthy scenes and sequences...some of my favorites include the scene where two of the Mars mission crewmembers, prior to leaving, receive televised messages from their loved ones back on Earth...my thoughts immediately turned to `Oh yeah, one of these two guys ain't coming back from the trip'...and I was right...here's a tip...if you're ever flying in a spaceship traveling 20,000 mph and ordered to go outside and fix a video receptor, you might want to think twice...another sequence, and perhaps the funniest (unintentionally) is in the rocketship as it is blasting off towards Mars...all of the crewmembers faces are shown as being mashed due to extreme gravitational forces...pulling a few G's, I think is what they say, the being people who get to ride in machines that go really, really fast.  All in all a strong, albeit dated, effort that falls just shy of being a sci-fi classic, but still worthy of attention, if you enjoy imaginative movie making and getting a glimpse at some amazing special effects artistry of the day.

The widescreen (1.85:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs looks really sharp and clean, and the Dolby Digital mono audio comes though very clearly.  There are no special features, not even a trailer, so if that's your bag, you're going to be disappointed.  Some extras would have been nice, but I'm happy with what's here.

2123146,4,B0002V7O2Y,"This film is worth seeing and getting for the ambitious realisation of the incredible Chesley Bonestell and his paintings. This is the way man might have gone to space given an unlimited budget and a ten year head start on Sputnik and Gagarin. The film is a little corny even by 1950's standards, and having the Commander of the expedition go a little loony AND ultra-religious is somewhat jarring. But I do like this film, for it is visually well-done and it is what it is: a product of it's time.",1107216000,5,498,4.483516483516484
2123147,5,B0002V7O2Y,"For me this was the great unseen film that I had seen stills from since childhood.  After avoiding the VHS tape I had heard so many bad things about, I got the DVD the day it went on sale.  I had heard that this was one of the many many science fiction films Stanley Kubrick watched with Arthur C. Clarke during preproduction of ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" but I was unprepared for some eerie similarities that I cannot write off as mere coincidence.  ""Conquest of Space"" is a film in which a civilian scientist arrives by transport on a wheel-shaped space station orbiting Earth, astronauts watch TV from Earth and watch one-way messages from their loved ones, a spacecraft's mission is prepared in secrecy and its destination changed just before launch, an astronaut is killed while making a repair to a spacecraft antenna and his body must be retrieved, and the crewmember in charge of a space mission goes insane and tries to kill other crew and sabotage the mission...

...and this was in 1955, not 1968.

But I don't want to build this up too much for those of you unaccustomed to 1950's science fiction movies.  This isn't as good as ""Forbidden Planet,"" but if you've enjoyed George Pal's other '50's films such as ""Destination Moon,"" ""War of the Worlds,"" and ""When Worlds Collide,"" then you will probably see a great deal of the charm in this admittedly lesser though perhaps more ambitious work.",1102896000,9,1401,4.697959183673469
2123148,4,B0002V7O2Y,"I'm delighted that George Pal's ""Conquest of Space"" has been released on DVD. Of course, I am a ""baby boomer"" who loves science fiction movies from the 50s--in fact, I have an interest in the whole history of sci-fi/fantasy films. It's possible that younger viewers, used to the current technological wizardry in film, will find ""Conquest"" dated and slow. If they give it a chance, though, there is much to enjoy.

After the spectacular ""When Worlds Collide"" and ""War of the Worlds"", George Pal returned to the almost ""semi-documentary"" style of his first big feature, which heralded the 50s sci-fi boom, ""Destination Moon"". Stationed above the earth in a huge, wheel-shaped space station, a group of astronauts prepare to fly a spaceship to the moon. They are then notified of a change in plan--the moon is no longer the target--they are to undertake a much longer, and more perilous journey to the planet Mars.

There are no big stars in this film--clearly most of the budget went on special effects. Most of the actors are quite stoic, including faces familiar to fans of vintage television--actors like Eric Fleming, William Hopper and Ross Martin. The leader of the expedition, General Merritt, is played by Walter Brooke, a no-nonsense commander who goes by the book, although he actually finds himself turning to the ""good book"". He finds strength in the Bible, although it creates doubts in his mind about Man's right to invade new worlds. Mickey Shaughnessy over-acts outrageously as Sergeant Mahoney, a stereotypical, emotional Irish American--although his performance is actually a welcome contrast to that of most of the other actors.

One other performance of note--Benson Fong plays Imoto, the Japanese member of the crew. With just ten short years since the end of the war between the United States and Japan, it is interesting and refreshing that George Pal decided on a Japanese character in this film. The message is obvious--we should put aside our past earthly squabbles--if we are to explore the vast unknown of space, we must all pull together. This is a theme that the Star Trek series was to champion later. I should add that Fong has a compelling speech about Japan's interest, and pride, in being part of the great adventure.

The theme of science and religion not necessarily being incompatible is raised here, perhaps not entirely successfully. It is a debate that continues to this day.

For 1955, the special effects are excellent--the space station--the interstellar vehicles--the astronauts going for ""space walks""--you cannot help but wonder how much this film influenced the Kubrick masterpiece, ""2001"". Two renowned experts were on hand to add to the film's authenticity--Willy Ley was one of the world's foremost pioneers in rocketry--Chesley Bonestell was a writer and artist, famous for his paintings of other worlds and ""spacescapes"". His work enhanced ""Destination Moon"", and it is a major plus here. George Pal's frequent collaborator, Byron Haskin, directs with his usual professionalism.

The DVD is gorgeous--this is a very colourful film, and the quality here, except for the occasional strident flesh-tone, is excellent. There are no extras, except a trailer.

""Conquest of Space"" is now some fifty years old, but it still captures our sense of wonder about the future, and the exploration of our solar system and beyond. If your idea of a sci-fi movie is loads of action, and plenty of aliens to battle, this film may not be for you. On the other hand, if--as I said earlier--you have a more serious interest in the history of the sci-fi film, ""Conquest of Space"" deserves a place in your DVD collection.",1099353600,141,3651,5.054817275747508
2123149,5,B0002V7O2Y,"This DVD version of CONQUEST OF SPACE finally treats the movie with the respect it deserves and gets FIVE stars.  The anamorphic 1:1.85 widescreen image is so great, crisp, and clean it's like watching the film in the theater for the first time.  Three cheers for the technicians who did the transfer!

Never has the screen shown--before or since!--a better starscape than this picture (no, not even FORBIDDEN PLANET, 2001, or STAR WARS).  The opening moments show a classic round von Braun space station hanging and spinning in space with an interplanetary vehicle parked nearby. Space has never been so black, nor the stars so scintillating.  The score by Van Cleave underscores the sense of wonder--both eerie and majestic--inherent in these scenes.

I first saw CONQUEST OF SPACE when I was ten.  This was at a time when our local theater ran Saturday ""Kiddie Mantinees"" for 25 cents admission during the '50s when the feature was almost always a science-fiction movie.  That's how I saw INVADERS FROM MARS, EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS, 20 MILLION MILES TO EARTH and others for the first time.  As much as I was thrilled by these movies, the one that touched me the most was CONQUEST OF SPACE.

Fast forward to the '80s and '90s.  The only VHS version of the film that I'm aware of could not be more terrible.  The blacks are washed out due to the positively poor resolution of the tape.  Even more disappointing, when the opening title sequence begins a few minutes after the start of the film, the image on the pan-and-scan VHS suddenly and unaccountably reduces in size so that the titles run in a foreshortened box surrounded by black bars on all sides.  As soon as ""Directed By"" finishes, the movie jumps back to fill the standard TV screen.  Since this sequence is one of the more dramatic moments in the film, this VHS version completely destroys the film makers' intent.  Fast forward again. A couple of years ago, I discovered a Japanese Laserdisc version of the movie on E-Bay.  I bought the disc hoping against hope that the Laserdisc would be an improvement over the VHS. Unfortunately it is the exact same poor resolution pan-and scan version as the VHS.  But all that is in the past now thanks to this practically perfect DVD, which has restored the title sequence to its original widescreen glory.

Since this is a George Pal film, the special visual effects are as good as they could get for their time. The story about a trip to Mars has many moments of spine-tingling wonder.  But, due to studio interference and pressure, the script was rushed and could have been better. The depiction of the surface of Mars was dramatic and cinematically wondrous in 1954 and knocked my socks off, but has little to do with the photographs of martian landscapes that we are familiar with today from the various NASA Mars missions.

But now I'm quibbling.  This DVD is a dream come true and is the best rendering of this film since its original theatrical release in 1954.

If you were born later, then it gives you a window into the minds of the visionaries of space flight. Both Chesley Bonestell and Willey Ley were advisors on this project, so you know that both the visual design and the technical background must be first rate. In fact, it is absolutely amazing how non-dated much of the film is after all these years. Plus, you get that indefinable positive spirit from the Age of Optimism. This is the sort of film that fueled the dreams of many a young scientist and engineer.
A pleasant additional aspect is seeing all those great old familiar faces in the cast that would later go on to television fame: Eric Fleming in ""Rawhide"", William Hopper in ""Perry Mason"", Ross Martin in ""Wild, Wild West"", and even Vitto Scotti in ""Laverne and Shirley.""

2123151,5,B0002V7O2Y,"UPDATE: I first reviewed this movie in 2003, when it was only available on DVD. Since that time a DVD has been produced, and while it is lacking extras, the conversion to Widescreen was worth it to me to upgrade my copy. The print is clean, good color, sound is crisp. Now on to my original review.

This film is an example of great 50's sci-fi from special effects wizard and producer George Pal. The space scenes hold up well for me and are not corny at all 50 years later. I still get excited watching the space wheel over a decade before Kubricks 2001 version. There are no hokey monsters or aliens in rubber suits here, man is his own worst enemy. This movie goes far beyond most sci-fi films of its time, exploring many issues of the human spirit for exploration in the face of danger. For one thing, it has an international cast to people the space station and the mission that it launches to Mars. There is discussion of the danger ahead, disagreements, accusations, forgiveness, and sacrifice. Lots of suspenseful moments, and someone is trying to sabotage the journey.

The trip is fraught with danger including a realistic tethered spacewalk. This is the first film I know of that showed a space burial. There are some minor glitches here and there, like the gloves that are not sealed to the spacesuits, but other touches like loss of gravity are well done. Lots of great gadgets, and neat spaceships that ""transform"" without looking cartoonish. While the special effects are fun and look eye-popping for their time, the gift of this movie is in its most subtle moments. This is one to see more than once. The desperation when they are stranded without water is carried off very well, and when they are near death and denying that there is any higher power in the universe a miracle occurs in a scene straight out of ""It's a Wonderful Life"".  The crew is very human, and has interesting interaction with each other.

The scenes of the crew preparing for the journey are comical, and light-hearted so that the film is not always weighed down with danger.  The character actors are a fresh contrast to the usual cookie cutter crew in a movie of this type. I recommend this movie for its sincere efforts at realism for tis time, while never failing to entertain with a solid script, good actors, and terrific special effects. I heartily recommend to my fellow Sci-Fi buffs.",1045267200,42,2382,4.6350710900473935
2123152,2,B0002V7O2Y,"This 1955 epic was a commendable effort by producer George Pal to give the public a more-or-less realistic look at what space travel might be like a few decades ahead, with no monsters and aliens and all that.  But the result is a film that is MORE dated, and less enjoyable, than SF films made even earlier which DID have monsters and aliens and all that.  Almost every character is a corny stereotype, including the inevitable crude -but-basically-smart funny guy from Brooklyn.

2123154,4,B0002V7O2Y,"On so many levels this is the quintessential gee-whiz 50's sci-fi movie, and the corny characters, dopey dialog and absurd plot angles are all a part of that.
When you think about it, all the characters in this movie behave like little boys. Check out especially the belligerent Irish Sergeant. He's a classic bully's henchman. Loyal beyond reason, and always shooting off his mouth. This movie was intended to be a boy's adventure. The only women in it at all are seen at a distance in broadcasts from earth. One is a cartoonish girlfriend played entirely for laughs, and the other is somebody's mom. These guys are like boy scouts going off to summer camp.
That's what I liked best about it. The over the top juvenile nature of all the characters. It's all about absurd performances! Check out the dive across the table that the Sergeant takes when the ""Wheel"" gets shaken up... I think he sweeps the whole thing clean! Or that horrible condescending speech they put in the mouth of the Japanese character. Even the religious nuttiness of the General fits this film perfectly. And it just wouldn't be complete without the wisecracking Brooklyn guy who is a whiz at electronics. That's like a 50's stock character almost. They don't even give him a name here, they just call him ""Brooklyn"".
The effects are almost surreal in their simpleness. They and the story and the acting all fit perfectly. Sure it's unlikely that a guy who is smart enough to lead the space program wouldn't be dumb enough not to guess that the rocket plans he's been given are more appropriate for Mars than the moon. Sure the Japanese guy takes his glove off to plant a seed in Martian soil with his BARE HAND!!! You can't look to this movie for sceitific accuracy or Oscar Nominated Acting. Look to it for what it does have:
An unexplained space station shake-up!
The obligitory Asteroid!
Neato toys based on classic Bonestel/Von Braun/Ley rocket dreams!
The obligitory face stretching scene!
MST3K ready dialog!
The obligitory accidental weightlessness scene!
The first ever (I think) astronaut killed by a micrometeorite in film!
The first ever burial in space!
The first ever snowfall on Mars! (Later used in the classic Star Blazers animated series, and I'll bet it's a conscious nod there.)
A cast of international steriotypes, ie. a loud obnoxious Irish guy, a louder, more obnoxious Brooklynite, a momma's boy German (or could be Austrian I guess) guy, a dignified Japanese guy who, despite the fact that the filmmakers were obviously trying to be enlightened about, still manage to give the most uncomfortable speech to, the overbearing whitebread American and his oppressed but dutiful son.
If all of that sounds like alot of retro flavored fun to you, then you won't even mind so much that this tape is cruddy EP. It's cheap, it's a gas, and you should get it.
I for one would love it if there ever is a great DVD version made. Something on par with the awesome ""Destination Moon"" disc. Until then, if you want a little better glimpse at what the effects in this film really look like, check out the DVD of ""The Fantasy Film Worlds of GEORGE PAL"", track 15. They've got the scene where the astronauts jump off the shuttle rocket to float toward the Wheel, the ENTIRE asteroid sequence, including the German (or Austrian) guy taking a fragment to the gut, AND the famous burial in space. The image quality on these clips is top notch, and it'll make you weep in comparison to the miserable EP video tape.
I'd have given this tape 5 stars if it hadn't been in EP mode. But don't wait for the DVD, we may never get one. If it sounds like fun, and you like 50's sci-fi, get this tape AND the fabulous ""The Fantasy Worlds of GEORGE PAL"" DVD, and have a good old fashioned Space Blast!",1005523200,9,3766,4.673192771084337
