5063734,5,B0079057F2,"For people who enjoy watching Keeping Up, I would highly recommend it. I don't have cable, so watching it through Amazon is a great idea. The quality is good, and I never have any problems running the shows.
Of the seasons I've seen, season 4 was likely my favorite. My favorite episodes include Kim getting her new dog off the street, the family going to Vegas and Scott getting drunk and causing problems, and the episode where they did the charity boxing. Good entertainment compared to what's out there. For those who enjoy the show, highly recommended!",1402876800,,557,4.752577319587629

5063736,5,B0079057F2,"I absolutely love this show and am glad to have it on DVD. The only problem I have with it is that Disc 1 won't work which happens to be Khloe's wedding which luckily I already own that episode from Kourtney and Khloe Take Miami. But other than that, the other discs work.",1388534400,,272,4.150943396226415
5063737,5,B0079057F2,These girls are very smart.  Also having your mom as a momager is great!  Kris really knows what she is doing and for everything they have out there you can't tell me that these girls are stupid.  Look where they are and then look where we are.  We are not on dvd's like them and that would be because they might be just a little smarter.  Good looks and brains can go a long way.,1387152000,,380,4.013333333333334

5063744,3,B0079057F2,"Hummm. What can I say. These seem like very nice people, but I am not sure why watching their life is so much more entertaining than living my own life. I'd recommend doing something more important like cleaning out a closet or swiffering under the bed.",1444435200,,253,4.521739130434782

8512458,4,B0079057F2,"I like the Kardashians. Even with all the drudgery, arguments and conceitedness, they are a family. They teach us that no matter what life throws at you, family always comes first.

8512461,5,B0079057F2,Pretty good deal for the amount of episodes you get for the money you spend.  The earlier seasons are only $8 is you get the SD instead of HD and to me there's not enough of a difference in the quality of video to pay extra.,1466899200,,224,3.869565217391304
