2648939,4,B000HXDEXU,"I Liked It!  Good ol' B&W movie, silly premise, happy ending.  It's not a screwball comedy per se, no real physical humor, but the story line kept my interest without taxing my brain.  The print is not perfect, nor should I expect it to be.",1408320000,,240,4.288888888888889
2648940,1,B000HXDEXU,Even for a classic this did not hold my attention.  Sound quality is poor.  Typical of this era - stilted acting and stereotypes throughout.,1385769600,,140,4.791666666666667
2648941,1,B000HXDEXU,This  picture was of such poor quality we were unable to view it. We have experienced this with other films on Prime as well.,1364601600,,125,4.208333333333333
2648942,3,B000HXDEXU,"This is a good and amusing B picture with a fine cast that can carry this kind of comedy well. But, and it is a big BUT:

But it ends abruptly and is missing five minutes. It is not 90 min long, it is 57 min long - 5 short of the 62 min that it is supposed to run.

Amazon should correct the length of this version. If there is any truth to the 90 min claim, it is the length of this cut film, plus the length of a ton of advertising that Alpha always puts on their DVDs.",1330214400,2,471,3.6534653465346536

8142517,2,B000HXDEXU,I did not watch the entire movie. It moved too slow and the acting was so-so,1484870400,,76,3.8125

8142520,3,B000HXDEXU,This little film had an incredibly small budget.  But the part where the thieves are reformed at church is moving.  Good ending too,1461715200,,131,4.6521739130434785
