I might be ignorant to the editing, framing and narrative flow but may
be someday when I revisit them I will see.",1362096000,2,355,4.144927536231884

8117165,5,B000F48DAK,"No Shame is a recent label which has sought to bring Italian classics to the DVD format. These two films, ""Violent Summer"" and ""Girl With a Suitcase"", are two of the finest films made by the director Valerio Zurlini, and the transfers are crisp, with good English subtitles. The films are fascinating as studies of young men involved in complex situations, in the former, trying to discern the proper political action during the Fascist regime, in the latter, trying to help a girl abandoned by his older brother. These films are distinguished by exceptional performances and by lovely compositions. For those who enjoy Italian cinema, No Shame has been a wonderful addition to the DVD universe, and this is one of their best packages.",1168300800,20,735,4.935483870967742
