2145955,4,B0002YLD4Q,"I saw the film this past summer at the Otakon premiere in Baltimore. Having previously seen Yoshiyuki Tomino's original Gundam movies, I didn't quite know what to expect with this new film. Boy was I surprised. Unlike the other Gundam movies like Char's Counterattack, I was able to enjoy F91 without having any predisposition on the background or the world. It was a nice self-contained story with albeit 1990's animation, the action sequences of the mobile suits are top notch. Gundam F91 follows a young man caught up in a conflict between his home colony and a group known as the Crossbone Vanguard. With several twists and turns, relationships are key to a very fun movie. I hear that Bandai will be releasing this film as a Special Edition with remixed audio and a commentary track, its not out yet, but just based on the movie itself, I highly recommend it",1095379200,2,863,4.7218543046357615
2146101,2,B0002YLD4Q,"It seems like Gundam: F91 has something of a poor reputation in the Gundam community, a reputation that seems completely deserved after spending some quality time with this film.

The plot of F91 comprises the first thirteen episodes of a TV series that never was. As might be expected, cramming over 300 hours of story into a two hour film inevitably chops out a lot of backstory and character development. The vast amount of editing is made worse by a script that does a poor job of bridging between the major events of the film. The result is a movie with so many plot holes that the experience feels like watching every other episode of a TV series. The characters come across as wooden and undeveloped; certainly due in part to the editing but further dragged down by some heinously melodramatic dialogue.

On the upside, the action sequences are executed well, especially the final battle. The visuals overall are generally top notch, on a par with 1988's Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack. There are a few patches of sloppiness (disproportioned mecha, poor frame rates, etc., but the movie looks good overall. That said, there are plenty of animes (and Gundam animes at that) out there that won't make you sit through bad dialogue, awkward story progression and a convoluted plot to see a couple of decent fight scenes. If you're new to Gundam, there are better entries in the franchise to cut your teeth on. I'd approve this one for completionists only.

*Side note: Upon occasion, F91 gets a bit graphic in the depiction of death. A mother lies dead in the street, eyes wide open in a blank stare as her baby attempts to wake her up. Dead children, people and animals sucked out of the colony through an air leak. While these types of scenes aren't anywhere near the morbidity of say, Alien or Saving Private Ryan, they are probably too graphic for small children to see. F91 is definitely PG-13, or a bit above.",1313971200,,1928,4.71513353115727
2146102,4,B0002YLD4Q,thank you for the movie though the first disk has a scrach and skips a chapter the second disk can also play the movie aswell and no scraches i also bought used though as well but over all i am very glad. the order got here a day early than expected so 4 stars all the way,1309132800,,272,3.789473684210526
2146103,2,B0002YLD4Q,"I remember back in 1990 when the japanese anime magazines gave preview articles for an upcoming anime film, Gundam Formula 91, to be released in...surprise, 1991.  When I saw it I was dazzled by the new mecha designs, gorgeous animation quality and the fact a new entry to the Gundam franchise was being released on the big screen.  However looking back I had to admit the story seemed to be a bit of a retread of the original MSG and frankly, the editing and story pacing were a bit off, and I didn't understand why.

Well now after some reading and research I finally know why that was.  Gundam F-91 was intended to be the start of a new Gundam franchise for a new generation of mecha fans and planned to be a 50 ep tv series.  They managed to write scripts and produce animation for the first 13 eps when, unfortunately, the project collapsed.  To salvage what work they had done, this aborted series was recompiled into a 2 hr theatrical release.  Because of this, you're actually watching a condensed first third of a tv series story which helps explain why the story doesn't make sense at times, feels rushed, and introduces characters out of nowhere without any real explanation.

Also what is depicted in the film appears really (pun intended) formulaic and really a rehash of MSG with one of the worst villains everywhere (Iron mask).  Also the soundtrack is very derivative with some echoes of John Williams and Star Wars, but not in a good way.

The only pluses are the cool new MS designs including the revolutionary F-91 whose superweapon backpack design would continue to influence gundam design for the next 20 years or so.

For hardcore gundam fans, I would recommend watching this for completeness sake (it takes place in UC 0123 where Gundam Char's Counterattack took place 30 years earlier), but to be honest, if you miss it, it won't make a huge difference if you watch any later Gundam series.

For those who aren't fans of the UC Gundam series, I'd save my money on pass on this.

It's a shame to think, if this had only been able to become to the series it was meant to be, what direction it could have taken the Gundam franchise.",1298160000,,2153,4.561038961038961
2146104,4,B0002YLD4Q,"F91 is not perfect. But it is epic, and it is awesome. The final battle alone makes the movie worth watching, but all throughout the film there is great animation, characters, mecha designs, and stellar battles. If you like a fast paced action mecha movie, look no further then F91 Gundam.",1293494400,2,289,4.686274509803922
2146105,5,B0002YLD4Q,"F91 was suppose to be a full length tv series, and it shows in the movie.  Its pace is the same as the gundam 0079 compilation movies, you get the story, but you know that you are missing out on things. That is the only negative thing I have to saw about this movie.  I thought it compressed the story meant for 50 episodes very well.  the pacing is good, though maybe a little fast for some people in certain spots.  This movie could definatley been a little longer to give more depth to some of the characters, but what you get in F91 is still very enjoyable and worth owning.",1287014400,,578,4.18018018018018
2146106,3,B0002YLD4Q,"I read this original.
Compared with it, I thought the human relations of the character was not described.
At this point I was terriblely sorry.",1276732800,,143,4.76
2146107,4,B0002YLD4Q,"Well first off I'd like to say that one of the main things from this movie that I liked was the combat coordination the animators used for the mobile suit action, which is one of the main reasons I watch Gundam. I also found the English dubbing to be reasonably decent. And the story itself wasn't pretty good

However this storyline probably would have been better if it was done in the 50 episode TV format as originally intended. That would have given the writer more time to flesh out the personalities of the characters, because as it is now it leaves the impression that just about everyone is a little immature (with the exception of one engineer that works on the protagonists' ship. Also if it was longer it would give the viewer a better look at the politics of the world and the characters opinion of it, because as it is it can be confusing. For instance halfway through the movie after Seabook discovers that Cecily is a member of the Crossbone Vanguard, his friends seriously consider defecting to the Crossbone Vanguard and present them with the Gundam as a bargaining token. Yet in the next scene they are seen preparing to evacuate to the moon which is Federation territory.

Another thing I at least found annoying was how it was hard to root for either the Federation or the Crossbone Vanguard. Usually with the early Gundam series the faction the series protagonist sides with is usually designed so that the viewer will wish to root for them, while the enemy is clearly seen as evil because of how they are usually willing to initiate WMD attacks that kill thousands to millions of people. In this movie the only truly evil character is Iron Mask with his plan to use the Bug weapon to kill any human not part of the Crossbone Vanguard. Other than that its quite easy to root for the Crossbone Vanguard to win because during the battles they specifically tried to avoid civilian deaths while the Federation's soldiers were only to willing to overlook civilians caught in the crossfire, use kids as shields, or try to for teenagers to fight simply because they had a damaged mobile suit they were using to escape.

Well I suppose that ultimately if your looking for good mobile suit action than you may want to check this out. However if you want something with a complex and deep story than this probably isn't for you.",1271203200,4,2340,4.606714628297362
2146108,2,B0002YLD4Q,"I'll keep it simple as I'm watching the movie while I type.... I am a huge fan of the Gundam series, I thought this would be a rare treasure but it isn't. I opened the case and the disc was marked as disc one but where in the hell is disc two? I then put it into my blu-ray player and began the movie, and right off from the start the plot just moves way too quickly to stay interested as you usually do in most of the Gundam series. I just didn't get the same feeling as I did with every other Gundam DVD I have seen. I would describe it as more of a feeling of disgust. This puts the franchise to shame. I do not recommend this to any Gundam fan.",1267315200,2,648,3.843283582089552
2146109,4,B0002YLD4Q,"Overall a great attempt, F91 was supposed to be a show. It got canceled though and was turned into a movie, so the cost of production could be recovered [attempted anyways]. The movie is rushed to the point that many of the characters seem to be important (if that) for only a period of maybe a minute, and then they fade to obscurity. The animation and sfx are good, and its worth adding to a collection just because of the name it falls under (for hardcore fans mind you), but in saying that - it is also a huge flop from the gundam metaseries and shouldn't be on EVERYONE's shelf. If I had to give it a pass/fail score, my opinion is 4/5 stars, just because of the rushedness of it. If they added maybe an additional 40 minutes, this could have been one of the greats. I would recommend it if one could get it at a decent price.

ALSO, DO NOT GET RIPPED OFF. THE SINGLE DISC SET IS JUST THE FIRST DISC OF THE 2 DISC SET! FOR ABOUT THE SAME PRICE, GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR (even though disc 2 isn't anything really that great/commentary and the like).

Note: the disc case these come in doesn't hold the discs in well. When I had mine arrive, the discs were kinda flopping around in there. I was lucky, my mail carriers are good about not roughhousing my stuff so it wasn't scratched to death. Just a fair warning!  :D",1259712000,,1316,4.214285714285714
2146110,3,B0002YLD4Q,"During the early 1990's, with the success of ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" and the films, Mobile Suit Gundam creator Yoshiyuki Tomino was literally itching to start a new Gundam saga.  Since 1979, there has been a stable release of ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" series or films  (with the exception of 1983-1984 which Tomino went on to create ""Aura Battler Dunbine"" and ""Heavy Metal L-Gaim"") and with the last film ""Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack"" in 1988, many fans were anticipating a new MS Gundam series.

So, Tomino immediately began on plans to create the usual 50+ episodes for a animated TV series called ""Mobile Suit Gundam F91'.  Unfortunately, after a dozen screenplays, the project was terminated due to production problems due to staff disputes.  So, what was originally planned for a television series became a theatrical feature film.

And for those who are familiar with ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" Universal Century storylines, seeing a series that is intended to be span over 25 hours receives a 2 hour film and thus many important details are literally lost and thus ""Mobile Suit Gundam F91' didn't receive the true treatment that Tomino would have liked.  Needless to say, for those who want to know more backstory would have to wait for Tomino's two -part novels.

The film featured Tomino as a director, screenwriter and storyboard artist.  Joining him for the screenplay was Tsunehisa Ito (""Zillion"", ""Nazca"", ""Sherlock Hound"", etc.), well-known MS Gundam character designer Yoshikazu Yasuhiko (who also worked on the ""Crusher Joe"" series, ""Venus Wars"" and ""Arion"") and well-known Gundam mechanical designer Kunio Okawara (who also worked on ""Armor Trooper Votoms"", ""Yatterman"" and the ""Gravion"" series).

Universal Century 0123.  The story of ""Mobile Suit Gundam F91' takes place 30 years after the 2nd Neo Zeon War (Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack).  There has been peace on Earth and the population growth is quite strong, so strong that the Federation has worked on creating space colonies to house the growing population.

But the peace has been shaken when a group known as the Crossguard Vanguard starts a war against the Earth Federation in the Frontier IV colony.  Unfortunately, the Earth Federation is unprepared for battle and are getting slaughtered by the Crossbone Vanguard.  Meanwhile, fighting takes place inside the colony, a group of teenagers and kids try to escape from all the destruction and make it to shelter or an escape pod before they are killed.

The film focuses on a group of youngsters (teenagers and kids) which include the main character Seabook Arno and his friend Cecily Fairchild.  The two and their friends and young family members and other kids that join them try to escape the colony and while they try to make their escape, Cecily's father is seen having an argument with his daughter and trying to prevent her from joining her friends by aiming a gun at her.  Seabook tries to rescue her to no avail.  The group escape without Cecily.

It is learned that Cecily Fairchild is really Berah Ronah, a daughter of royalty and the daughter of Carozzo ""Iron Mask"" Ronah who leads the aristocratic Crossbone Vanguard (a private army of the Ronah family), responsible for the war against the Earth Federation.  Needless to say that Cecily doesn't trust her father and moreso, because he wears an ""Iron Mask"" and never reveals his trueself to her.

Iron Mask wants to establish an aristocracy i the new Frontier colonies at Side 4 (aka Cosmo Babylonia) and because Berah is his daughter, he wants her to be the Crossbone Vanguard's political figurehead.

With so much death and destruction, Seabook, his friends and the kids managed to find safety with what's left of the Earth Federation on one colony and the fact is that the don't have enough mobile suits to fight against the Crossbone Vanguard.  But they do have a Mobile Suit that has not yet been used known as the F91.  Because of situations in which the Earth Federation is ill-prepared, they need a pilot immediately and thus everyone puts their faith in Seabook to piloting the F91.

But what surprises everyone is his ability to learn the machine quickly.  Is it possible that Seabook is a ""Newtype"" (a person who has heightened mental awareness)?  If he is a Newtype, will he be able to use his skills to fight the Crossbone Vanguard?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

It's important to note that ""Mobile Suit Gundam F91' is an older anime that came out in theaters in 1991.  But because it came after the main ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" series and films featuring Amuro Ray and Char Aznable, the animation quality is much better than it's 1970's and 1980's counterparts.  More detail and more shading is quite evident and the film is presented via anamorphic widescreen with an aspect ration of 1:78:1.  But because the popular original MS Gundam character designer Yoshikazu Yasuhiko and mechanical designer Kunio Okawara returned for this film, character designs were consistent and for me, that is important.  So, overall, for a 1991 film, ""Mobile Suit Gundam F91' looked great for an animated film created at that time.

As for audio, the audio is presented in English 2.0 and Japanese 2.0.  I watched both audio tracks and for the most part, both were quite solid and are well done.  So, for English dub or Japanese dub fans, the voice acting is well done.  Also, the music by Satoshi Kadokura is awesome (and you may even pick up some ""Star Wars"" style of music in the film).  As for the audio, it is in 2.0 (my receiver shows the audio as Dolby Digital 2.0) and for the most part, for those with a good receiver, my selection for audio is selecting all channels on Stereo.  One thing that I did notice in comparison is that the English dub track is slightly louder compared to the Japanese audio.  But again, both audio tracks are quite solid.

As for subtitles, the film is presented with optional English subtitles.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Mobile Suit Gundam F91: The Motion Picture"" comes with the following special features:

  * Gundam F-91 Mechanical Files - Using your remote (or arrow keys on your computer), you can view technical data and information on the mobile suits such as the F91, Heavygun, Jegan, Guntank R-44, Den'an Zon, Den'an Gei, Ebirhu S, Berga Dalas, Dahgi Iris, Berga Giros, G-Cannon and many more.
  * Trailers - Bandai Entertainment trailers for ""Wolf's Rain"", ""Ghost in the Shell"" and ""Kaze no Yojimbo"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

Watching ""Mobile Suit Gundam F91: The Motion Picture"", at first glance, my first time watching the film, I thought it would have potential like the first ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" film but where there was four films to help in plot creation and character development, ""Mobile Suit Gundam F91' felt rushed.

With Yoshiyuki Tomino originally wanting the series to be over 50-episodes, you can imagine how much storyline was lost in the creation of this film.  So, the film felt rushed and I just felt there was a chunk of storyline missing.  You don't feel anything for Seabook or Cecily as you did with the characters from the previous Mobile Suit Gundam films (or television series).  The character development of Seabook and Cecily was just too rushed and for a ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" film, it just didn't seem right.

Another thing that surprised me is that this 2009 release of ""Mobile Suit Gundam F91: The Motion Picture"" under the Anime Movie Classics moniker is inferior to the 2004 Special Edition release.  The 5.1 Dolby Digital English track was not used for some reason, nor were the inclusions of the special features that were used in the Special Edition.  But granted, the SE 2004 version had two discs and I reckon to get this DVD out for a low price, they opted for the cheapest alternative and that is the single disc release.

The story of F91 doesn't end with this film.  The good news is that in 1994, ""Mobile Suit Crossbone Gundam"" manga series written by Yoshiyuki Tomino was created and takes place ten years after F91 and brings back a few characters from the film.  And two manga sequels were created in 2003 (""Mobile Suit Crossbone Gundam: Skull Heart"") and in 2006 (""Mobile Suit Crossbone Gundam: The Steel Seven""). The bad news is that the manga has so far been released only in Japan and neither of the three manga series have been released in English in America yet.

Overall, ""Mobile Suit Gundam F91' is a good Gundam movie but could have been even greater if it was released as a television series.  There is so much backstory that is not on this film and its easy to feel that the storyline seemed rushed in order to get from Point A to Point B.  But there is quite a bit of mecha action is this series and there are times which I found quite entertaining.

If you are an anime fan who has been collecting ""Universal Century"", then of course you will want ""Mobile Suit Gundam F91: The Motion Picture"" in your collection but in terms of MS Gundam Universal Century-related storylines, ""F91' is not as captivating as I was hoping for it to be.",1250726400,,9011,4.8286644951140065
2146156,5,B0002YLD4Q,"I really enjoyed this movie. I found it somewhat humorous in the fact that they literally crammed an ENTIRE series into one movie. and it worked! haha

but the movie came in a very timely manner and in fantastic condition. yay :)",1237420800,,229,4.4523809523809526
2146157,5,B0002YLD4Q,I always get really excited when they bring over old gundam stories to America.  This was no exception.  I loved this movie.  Especially the sound track.  Every gundam fan should add this to their collection.,1207353600,,208,4.857142857142857
2146158,4,B0002YLD4Q,"Best part of the movie was towards the beginning when they run into this Museum of War and in the background you can see both a Zaku and a Gelgoog collecting dust(but I'll bet still operational), that was worth the entire movie right there.",1206662400,,240,4.4772727272727275
2146159,2,B0002YLD4Q,"Originally intended as a TV series, Gundam F91 is the last of the original Universal Century movies (the rest being compilations of earlier series). 30 years have passed since Amuro and Char had their final climactic duel and things have only gotten worse for humanity. The corrupt Earth Federation have continued to let their power slip and are ill equipped to face a new spacenoid rebellion known as the Crossbone Vanguard. Waving the banner of spacenoid peace and supremacy, many colony citizens wonder if accepting them would be a good thing. But for every idealist there must be a greedy tyrant. Hope lies with a ragtag group of civillains and trainees and the prototype MS known as the F91...

Gundam F91 follows the classic Gundam plot structure- war comes into the mostly peaceful life of a young man and his friends and fate sees him as the pilot of the weapon which could end the conflict. By the time of it's appearance here, the structure is certainly showing some faults. The film perhaps even hurts itself by pointing out more than once that this isn't the first time this has happened in the Gundam world (This is an ongoing theme with the film- early on we see a war museum displaying old Zeon MS and the F91 receives it's 'Gundam' designation in honour of the suits which came before it).Whilst the basics are ok, the formula could really use some livening up.

Not helping things is the erratic pacing- due to being based off of half complete ideas for a TV series, F91 is a dissapointing mix of too many plot points and little resolution. Many times through the film I could see how certain elements would have been expanded in a full length series. Characters seem to be brought in just to be killed and 'develop' the main character.

Our lead is Seabook Arno, a 17 year old student who bears resemblance to Amuro and Kamille before him. Seabook has Tomino's trademark rough family life with a one parent family due to a mother who threw herself into her work, though the Arno's are perhaps one of the closer families in Gundam. Seabook's crush is beauty queen and tomboy Cecily Fairchild, who's past is somehow linked to the Vanguard's leaders. The connection is one of the key plot points and the source of much conflict between the two starstruck youths. Their ragtag group of refugees is rounded up by a bunch of fellow kids, mostly useless and annoying. Seabook's friends basically do nothing for the film and I'm constantly befuddled as to why Tomino seems to think it's a good idea including babies and toddlers in these groups. It does show that war picks on everyone, but their placement serves no real purpose and their comic relief moments fall flat.

On the other side of the cast we have the personalities of the Crossbone Vanguard, mostly the slightly deluded Ronah family. Having made their fortune by various spacenoid commodities, the Ronah's form a private army with the apparent intent of joining all humanity under one space nation ruled by themselves. The one Ronah who sticks out the most is the mysterious and creepy 'Iron Mask'. A hulk of a man with a full metal mask covering his head, Iron Mask is seemingly supporting the elder Ronah's vision but is in fact plotting something much more sinister...

On the DVD side of things, Bandai do an ok job. The release is hyped as a 'Special Edition' due to it being a 2 disc set. There's a big difference in content-

Disc 1 contains the film itself, with a stereo English and Japanese track and optional subtitles. The menus are well designed using animation of Seabook's home colony from the film. Extras consist of the always well researched Gundam Encylopedia from Keith Rhee and Mark Simmons, with technical and history information on the various mobile suits seen throughout the film.

Disc 2 is where a drop in content comes. Whilst low on extras, it's clear to see that disc 1 was at some point considered all there was to the release. The secondary disc feels rushed so Bandai could jack up the price. Gone are the well designed in-universe menus, replaced with a colour inverted image of the F91's head whilst the most annoying dialogue from the dub loops.

Disc 2 is an extras disc, but there's not much to get excited about. The best part is the audio commentary for the film between the dub's producer, one of the dub actors and a representative of Sunrise. Whilst things take a while to get going, by the end we learn some interesting anecdotes and trivia on the production of the dub and Gundam as a whole. There's also a 5.1 Dolby Digital English track for the film.

The rest of the extras are rather low- we get a brief character guide, a gallery of random shots from the film, shots of life-size F91 and Zaku heads and a brief timeline of the key events leading up to the events of the film. I really feel Bandai could have done more with this disc, such as the Gundam Evolve CGI shorts or Crossbone Gundam, the sequel manga to F91. Some of the content IS good, but as a whole it just feels rushed and unthought out.

Both casts do a great job. Bandai wisely hired Animaze/BangZoom for the project, leading to the cast being full of many talented voice actors. All the roles are perfectly cast and handled, unlike the hodge podge efforts from the Ocean Studios.

I wanted to like F91, really. This release (both the film itself and the DVD content) had alot of potential but it just comes short of the mark which is a shame because otherwise this could of been a good release. As is, I can only reccomend Gundam F91 to hardcore Gundam fans. Anyone else will likely not be interested.",1110499200,14,5591,4.609045226130653
2146160,4,B0002YLD4Q,"After having seen Gundam F-91, I have to wonder why it wasn't released as a series. It easily holds its own as a movie, but it would have been nice to see it as a series. The Crossbone Vanguard made excellent foes and I wanted to see more of them. Further, I would have liked to see more of Seabook, Cecily and their friends. Perhaps Tomino can now go back and make Gundam F-91 as a proper series.",1107388800,2,397,4.102564102564102
2146161,4,B0002YLD4Q,"F91 is one of Bandai's next Gundam releases to finally make it overseas. Bandai has mostly been releasing their Alternate Reality Gundam shows (Such as Gundam Wing, G-Gundam, Gundam SEED), so having a little Universal Century doesn't hurt anyone.
Taking place many years later after Char's Counter Attack, the Federation is at war with the Crossbone Vanguard. At a colony, young Arno Seabook just wants to live a normal life, until the Crossbone invade his home. Now finding himself cornered, and now the pilot of the experimental F91 Gundam, Arno must save his friends and those he cares about, or die trying.
This movie was technically supposed to be a series, but for some unknown reasons, Tomino (The creator of Gundam), had a change of plans and had this become a movie. Why this choice, is still unclear. The plot may seem rushed and compact at times, but it's trying to tell alot, even though it's around a 2 plus hour movie. However, that doesn't stop the story from shining.
The animation quality for a movie of it's calibre is VERY decent. I couldn't see any animation errors or faults, so there is nothing to complain about. The english dubbing is above average, as I didn't mind it. Musical score is fairly good too. This DVD also has lots of extras, and has a second DVD to boot.
Gundam F91 still isn't the last Universal Century story to be released, we still have a little ways to go. Zeta Gundam is now out, and hopefully soon, ZZ(Double Zeta) Gundam will follow. And hopefully after that, the other UC stories and AUs to boot. Until then, enjoy this movie, as I know I enjoyed it.",1106092800,10,1597,4.626760563380282

At the heart of the movie is a love story.  Two lovers torn apart by family and war, reunited by their special bond.  Unfortunatly the lovers are part of the ""new-type"" story line from the original series.

  While the movie itself is great, the dvd is not.  The dvd will not play on either of my dvd players.  My first copy I had to return because the coding on the disc was so bad.  The new copy played better, but died about half way through the presentation.  I can only watch the dvd on my p.c.'s rw-dvd drive.  The timeline of the gundam series in the special features section was littered with errors.  It had wrong dates and even skipped major portions of the gundam history.  I may sound a little skeptical, but this dvd just did not have the same quality as any of the other Bandai products that I own.

Gundam F91 makes it's ground in history because it is the first (and possibly only) Gundam title to be shown in U.S. theatres.  F91 made it's debut at Otakon and is now making it's way across the states to New York (at the ImaginAsia Film Theater), Los Angeles, Boston, Dallas, Chicago, Houston, and San Fransisco at the Festival of Anime Screening.  If you live in or by any of these citys I strongly urge you to go see it!  Be a part of Gundam history!

8034925,4,B0002YLD4Q,Overshadowed by the release of Gundam 0083 in 1991 this movie has not gotten the hype nor respect it deserves. This was supposed to be a 49 episode tv series and to have it replaced by a movie is almost insulting since the story line is good but just so rushed and crammed. I still give this 4 stars since I am a huge MSG fan,1395360000,,325,3.9393939393939394
8034926,5,B0002YLD4Q,This is a very action pack Gundam movie that is for the mech lovers who like to see mechs fight it out with their human pilots controlling their movements.,1379808000,,155,4.379310344827586
8034927,4,B0002YLD4Q,"Everybody knows about the executive meddling which lead to the creation of this movie, how it was originally stated to be another 50-episode long series with Tomino at the helm. Even so, it's still good and enjoyable. In spite of this handicap, the ""dream team"", Tomino, Yasuhiko, and Okawara, somehow managed to create a nice addition to the Gundam Universe, introducing the later period of the classic Universal Century. The character designs are great, but the mechs are the reason I say this movie is worth it. Those ""grunt mechs"" of the Crossbone Vanguard are simply stunning! The film, however, does suffer from many of the standard Gundam cliches we've all seen a hundred times, but the biggest flaw is the pacing and my God, does it feel rushed. At the very least, the final ""boss"" battle feels epic and satisfying. A must-have for any U.C. fan.",1375142400,,853,4.809523809523809
8034928,4,B0002YLD4Q,"The movie was as expected. Though I didn't realize how jumpy it was. I say if you want to understand the story better, read the manga as well.",1369440000,,142,4.107142857142857
8034929,5,B0002YLD4Q,I loved the movie and the animation was superb. The beginning of the movie had a real-life chaotic vibe to it. I would highly recommend it to anyone that is also interested in the mysterious Crossbone Vanguard. I also felt the movie explained things I was curious about in the Gundam universe.,1359072000,,293,4.653846153846154
8034930,4,B0002YLD4Q,"Between the two-disc and one-disc versions available for F91, purchase the two-disc if you can. Prices of these products and similar products by Bandai are doomed to shoot up because of Bandai's decision to cease shipping new products to North America (tragic, but inevitable). As for Gundam F91's content, the two disc set actually includes the feature film on both discs, one with English and Japanese dialogue and the other with English 5.1 Dolby Digital audio, as wells as standard Character Files, a Mobile Suit Encyclopedia, and a Gundam Timeline. Originally intended as a fifty-episode series, Gundam F91 DOES feel rushed in terms of story and editing. There are definitely a few jarring cuts, but at least the story hits the bullet points. It feels more like watching the Gundam SEED Special Edition movies (The Empty Battlefield, The Far-Away Dawn etc.) then an intended movie like Char's Counterattack or A-wakening of the Trailblazer. However, like most of his Gundam works, Tomino also novelizes his original story ideas that got cut for the final product for those of you that are interested.
  Gundam F91's story is extremely familiar to anyone who has seen any Universal Century Gundam story before. Seabook Arno and his friends are thrust into the horrors of war when fighting between the Federation and Crossbone Vanguard enters their home colony of Frontier-4. Seabook and his friends eventually meet up with a rookie team of Federation soldiers and together with the experimental Gundam F91, he is forced to fight against the Vanguard and their enigmatic leader, Iron Mask. As with any Gundam story, the story's main conflict is between political ideologies and turmoil within the Federation. Like the original Mobile Suit Gundam, neither the Federation nor the Crossbone are inherently evil, but rather there are likeable and dislikable characters on both sides. The brutality of mobile suit combat is expressed very graphically in a chilling yet logical way, and though the plot seems rushed at times, the conclusion is nevertheless satisfying.",1358294400,,2065,5.216867469879518
8034931,3,B0002YLD4Q,"A little stand alone spin off from the Gundam universe.  Doesn't really start anywhere, or go anywhere...not bad if you like Gundams it just doesn't play any role in anyway.  Steals a little story here and there from the other series.",1344643200,,234,4.682926829268292
8034932,5,B0002YLD4Q,very mature the pure drama is amazing i never even knew this movie was made but i loved it when i bought it and i actually got 2 copy's in the same disk so that was cool amazing story line definitely one for the DVD rack,1327276800,2,220,3.8043478260869565
8034933,5,B0002YLD4Q,"I used to own The VHS version of the Gundam F91, having a DVD version is awesome.
I've watched it in Japanese and English, it's like watching 2 different movies, translation is only about 30% accurate but that's average for any anime. If you really want to enjoy the movie, you'll need to learn Japanese and watch the movie.",1315267200,,324,4.508474576271187
