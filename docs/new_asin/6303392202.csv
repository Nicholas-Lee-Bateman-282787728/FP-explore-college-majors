The prime reason I watched this series.
It was a fun, all-too-short-run series (summer replacement, I think) that grabbed your attention, if you happened onto it.
'Gritty' and humorous in the vein of Bladerunner.
People always want to compare shows like this to Firefly... I never 'got into' that series. I feel Space Rangers will stand on its own for sci-fi affectionados just for the fun of it.
Definitely worth checking out.
I only wish there was a reasonably priced region 1 DVD release.
Enjoy!

The characters are quirky, always getting by--barely--by the seats of their pants, honorable, and the good guys (and gals) always win. This is not a heavy show and there are always several laughs along the way.",1218931200,,486,4.282608695652174
